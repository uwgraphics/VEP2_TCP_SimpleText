TO The Right Honorable, the Lords and Commons In PARLIAMENT Assembled.
YOUR HONORS earnest desires expressed in the premised Order, inevitably
engaging me to compile and publish to the World, A complete History of the
famous Trial, of the late decapitated Archbishop of Canterbury; I have,
without other motives, in Obedience thereunto (with as much Expedition as my
many other distracting Occasions, and the Vastness of the Work would permit)
finished the First Part thereof; (which I here humbly tender to Your Honorable
Patronage and Acceptance) comprising, The several Orders, Articles, and
Parliamentary Proceedings against him, from his Original Impeachment till his
Trial; together with, the Commons Various Evidence; his several Answers to
it; and their Replies upon them, in maintenance of the First General Branch of
their Charge of High Treason against him: to wit; His Traiterous Endeavors to
alter, and subvert Gods true Religion by Law established among us; to introduce
Popish Superstition and Idolatry in liew thereof; and to reconcile the Church
of England to the Church of Rome, by sundry Jesuiticall Stratagems: The guilt
of which black Execrable Charge (wherein he most of all protested, and
endeavored to clear his pretended Innocence, both during his Trial at the
Bar, and at his Death on the Scaffold, as that which did most nearly concern
him in his function as an Arch-Prelate, and in his Religion as a Protestant,)
was so abundantly evidenced, so firmly fixed upon his White Rochet by a various
multiplicity of unavoydable proofs, impregnable Demonstrations, (which all his
Sophistry, Oratory, Subtilty, Protestations, could no ways enervate or evade,)
that it will stick fast upon him for Eternity, maugre all his own verbal
Apologies, during his life, or the Malignant Panegyricks, the scandalous
Relations of any Anti-parliamentall, or Prelaticall Sycophants since his death:
Who in open affront of Your most memorable Exemplary Justice, upon this
Arch-Traytor, (the very Sourse and Compendium of all our late miseries) have
proclaimed him to Posterity, in their late lying Legends of his death, A most
Glorious Martyr, (as the Papists did his most Traiterous Predecessor, Joannis
de Aton. Constit. fol 149. 150. Antiquicates Ecclesiae Brit. and Godwin in his
life, M. Fox Act, and Monuments, p 2. 205.

Saint Williams day, the Popish Archbishop of Bourges in France; as great a
disturber in his time, of that Kingdoms public peace, and course of Justice;
yea, as grand an Incendiary of the bloody Wars against the Albigenses and
French Protestants, as this Archbishop was of our Kingdoms tranquillity, its
public Justice; and stirrer up of the War against the Scots; yet for all this
enrolled in the Red Calender of Romish Saints.

There have lately come unto my hands two Oxford Pamphlets; the one entitled:
A true Relation of the Death of the most Reverend Father in God, William Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, upon Tower hill, January, 10. 1644. (First Printed at
Oxford, and since at Bristol, Anno 1644.) Which begins thus:

On Friday, Jan. 10. THE REBELS MARTYRED the most Reverend Father in God,
William Lord Archbishop of Canterbury upon Tower hill, after they had kept him
prisoner above four years: And then relating his speech and Prayer on the
Scaffold, it concludes in these words: Thus dyed the KINGS, and the CHURCHES
Note.
MARTYR; a man of such Integrity, Learning, Devotion, and Courage, as had he
lived in the Primitive times, they would have given him another name: whom
though the cheated multitude were taught to misconceive, (for these honored
him) yet impartial posterity will know how to value him, when they hear the
Rebels sentenced him the very same hour that they voted down the Liturgy of
the Church of England; whose innocence cries to heaven for Vengeance, upon the
heads of these destroyers, who pile MURDER upon Murder to fortify their
Covenant, that upon this generation may come all the RIGHTEOUS BLOOD, from him
whose blood was first shed, to the pulling down this great Pillar of our
Church; which if you consider, is THE MOST GROUNDLES, MALICIOUS, SOLEMN
STUDIED MURDER THAT EVER WAS COMMITTED IN THIS WRETCHED Note.
ISLAND.

The later Pamphlet Imprinted at Oxford, of the same Subject, dated as the
former, (inscribed; A brief Relation of the Death, and Sufferings of the most
Reverend and Renouned Prelate, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, with a more
perfect Copy of his Speech and other passages ^n the Scaffold, than has been
hitherto Imprinted;) thus blazons this Archtraytors Innocence, merits,
sufferings. Page 14. 15. 25.
He that had so long lived a Confesser (a Popish Confessor if he please to the
Duke of Buckingham and others) could not but think it release of misery to be
made a MARTYR. He ascended the Scaffold with so brave a courage, such a
cheerful countenance, as if he had mounted rather to behold a Triumph than to
be made a Sacrifice, and came not there to dye, but to be translated; and to
say truth, it was no Scaffold but a Throne; a Throne whereon he was shortly to
receive a Crown, even the most glorious Crown of MARTYRDOM: After which he
styles him, A glorious Martyr; his blood, Innocent blood; yea, thou extols his
Innocence, and Canonizeth him for a Saint in a Poetical Elegy, especially in
these ensuing lines.

-- Through the hand
Of base detraction practice to defame
Thy spotless Virtues, yet impartial fame
Shall do thee all just honor, and set forth
To all succeeding times thy matchless worth;
No Annalls shall be writ, but what relate
Thy happy influence, both on Church and State;
Thy zeal to public Order, thy great parts
For all affairs of weight; thy love to Arts;
And to our shame and his great glory tell,
For whose dear sake, by whose vile hands he fell.
A death so full of Merits, of such price,
To God and man so sweet a sacrifice,
As by good Church-Law may his name prefer,
To a fixed Rubric in the Calender.
And let this silence the pure Sects complaint, Note.

If they make Martyrs, we may make a SAINT, etc.
And not only these Anonymous Pamphleters, but King Charles himself, who not
long before had given him an ample Pardon, as a Traitor, under his great Seal
of England, forgetting what he had done herein, does in his own See the Kings
Cabinet opened.
Letter to the Queen, dated Jan. 14. 1644. cry up this headless Archbishop
for a Martyr; yea, deems his blood so meritorious, so Innocent; that being
totally the Parliaments, he believes it no presumption, hereafter to hope that
Gods hand of Justice, (for the Parliaments just effusion of his blood) must be
(thence-forth) heavier upon them and lighter upon him and his
Anti-parliamentary Party, looking now upon their cause having passed by their
faults. If his blood so lately shed by the axe of Justice be already become so
meritorious, as to balance the scales of Gods Justice in this manner; we may
justly fear it will in few years more grow into as great esteem at Court, as
Thomas of Beckets his Trayterly predecessors blood, did in former times among
the Prelatical Popish party; who attributed more efficacy to it then to
Christ's, and therefore presumed most blasphemously to pray to Christ himself to
save them, by his own, but this Arch-Traytors blood, in this distick.

Tu per Thomae Sanguinem quem prote impendit

But as the manifold glorious Victories, miraculous Successes of the
Parliaments Forces since his Execution, have experimentally frustrated this his
Majesty's groundless Hope and Presumption, that Gods hand of Justice would be
heavier upon the Parliaments Party, but lighter upon him and his, by reason of
his crying blood, it being never lifted up so extraordinarily, so visibly for
the Parliament before, nor falling so heavily upon the King and his Partisans;
as since his beheading, and the Kings overconfident relying on the Merits of
the Blood of such a Traytot for success in his wars against the Parliament;
So, I presume, the setting forth of this History of his Trial, will soon
Un-Martyr, Un-Saint, Uncrown this Arch-Imposter, by presenting him in his
Proper Colors, stripped of all Disguises, and render him so desperately
criminal, so transcendently Traiterous in all respects, especially in point of
undermining the Protestant Religion, wherein himself and his Parasites have
endeavored most of all to vindicate his Innocence, that all Generations will
unaminously pronounce him, the Archest Enemy to, the most active universal
Underminer of the Protestant Religion established among us, that ever breathed
in English air; and readily acknowledge, that no Ecclesiastical Annalls ever
recorded his Parallel, for multiplicity of desperate cunning Jesuiticall
Stratagems secretly to subvert that Orthodox Reformed Religion which himself
pretended to profess; nay, propagate and patronize.

It is far below the Magnanimity of my Spirit in the least measure maliciously
to blast the Fame, or revengefully to triumph over, to trample upon the Ashes
of a Vanquished Enemy, whom I never dreaded, or slandered all his life, forgave
and pitied both before and at his death; the Memory of whose Capital crimes
should have expired with his breath, and been eternally buried in oblivion with
his Corpse, by me, had not Your Honors superior Commands necessitated me to
revive, record them to Posterity since his death (as well as to give them in
evidence at his Trial,) for Vindication of Your untainted Justice, and the
Common Good, to deter all others in future Ages from the like Traiterous
Practices. If any therefore deem my Expressions, concerning him or his actions,
over-lavish, malicious, or revengefull, let them impartially compare them with
his Criminal Offenses here recorded, (which they hardly equalize, or fall far
short of) and then if they warrant not the harshest Epithites, the blackest
Characters here bestowed on him, let me eternally bear the blame and shame: but
if they be scarce proportionate to his Treasons, his grand Misdemeanors, (which
must be blazoned and set forth in language suitable to their transcendent
Heinousness, not minced, not extenuated by over-diminutive expressions) I hope
none will or can be so injurious, as to charge me with Calumny, much less
Scurrility or Revenge, who never yet particularly demanded, received the least
farthing Recompense from him or any of his, for all the barbarous Cruelties,
Oppressions, Imprisonments great Losses, Damages I sustained, eight years
space together, only for discovering, opposing, countermining (to the utmost
of my skill and power) all Popish Plots, Innovations, Proceedings of this
Arch-Prelate and his confederates to undermine our Religion, re-establish
Popery among us by degrees, and set up an arbitrary Papal power, the better to
effect the same: the only real cause of all my former sufferings.

Yet three things there are, I foresee may possibly be objected against me by
his accomplices, which need some Answer to prevent their causeless Calumnies.

The first is, That in this History of his Trial, I have at large inserted
some particular papers, passages, (especially in the Catalogue of the Arminian,
Object. 1.
Popish Errors, vented in, and of the clauses against them purged out of late
new Printed Books) which were not actually, or at least fully read at the Lords
Bar; Therefore I am guilty of partiality and unfaithfulness in relating the
Evidence given in against him at the Bar, by these additions to it.

To which I answer. First, that all the Evidence, Passages here at large
recited (with many more) were prepared and ready by me at the Bar; yea Answ. 1.
the effect of every Paper, passage here recorded, was in general terms
opened, pressed at the trial, though not all fully read and particularly urged
for want of time: which I have here more largely inserted for clearing the
truth, and satisfying the Reader, the most material passages being only read
at large, the rest of like nature but briefly referred to in general to avoid
prolixity, and husband time.

Secondly, that I have largely recorded none of these Passages here by way of
New Additionall Evidence, requiring answer, but only for illustration or
corroboration of the old, fully given in and read.

Thirdly, the Catalogue of new licensed Popish Doctrines, and of the Purgations
of Passages against Popery, Arminianisme, arbytrary government, Profaneness,
etc. wherein most of the new Additions, not fully read, are inserted, make but
one entire charge, not diverse; and had but one general Answer, defense given
to them by the Archbishop; to wit, that they were not licensed nor purged out
by himself, but only by his and the Bishop of Londons Chaplains, who must
answer for them, and that they concerned not him: therefore these Additions
making no new charge, and receiving all the self same Answer and defense, no
indifferent persons can justly tax me with partiality or injustice for
inserting them into this History, for the fuller discovery of his Popish
intentions in this kind, (which want of time prevented us to display so fully
at the Bar, as was desired, where we had each particular ready in writing
proved upon oath) it being not only excusable, but justifiable, yea necessary
in a History of this nature, which so much concerns Religion and the public.

The second thing, which perchance will be alleged against me, is; Object. 2.
That I have not so fully, so punctually related the Archbishops several
Answers and Replies to all the particulars of his charge as he uttered them
viva voce at the Bar in his particular and general Defenses (who spoke as much
for himself as the wit of man could invent, in so bad a cause) and that I have
made some few Additions to the Commons sudden Replications to his Answers.

To this I answer: First, that I used all possible diligence, both by friendly
Answ. 1.
entreaty and the power of Authory, to procure the Archbishops own Notes of his
Answers and Defenses to the Commons charge, or authentic Coppies of them, from
Mr. Dell his Secretary and others; that so I might Print them verbatim to avoid
all calumnies; but I could obtain neither from them; M Dell protesting, that
neither he, nor any other to his knowledge, had the originalls nor any coppyes
of them; and that he believed, his Lord did burn all the Notes of his answers
and defense before his death, of purpose to prevent their publication after it.
So that if I have casually omitted or mistaken any part of his Answers or
Defense, himself or his own creatures must bear the blame, not I; who have as
faithfully, as exactly as I could supplied this defect of his own Papers, out
of the Notes of others and mind own fragill memory, relating all his Answers,
Defenses, as near as possible in his own terms, and pressing them fully for
his best advantage, without the least wilful omission or diminution of any one
particular of moment.

Secondly, For the Commons subitane Replies to his Answers, I have rehearsed
them as near as I could in their own terms; and made no Additions thereunto,
but only of some Authors testimonies concerning the unlawfulness of Images,
Crucifixes, Altars, the placing and railing in Altars and Lords Ta^l^s
altarwise against the Eastwall, and the consecration of Churches and Chapples;
wherein the Archbishop much abused his Auditory with empty flashes and
confident pretenses of antiquity, which Mr Sergeant Wild at large refuted by
the Testimony of Fathers and other orthodox Writers, and Mr Nicholus too, as
far as the shortness of time permitted; to the substance of whose replies in
these particulars I have added very little, but only for learning sake and the
fuller clearing of the truth.

If any shall further object, that J have related his Charge entirely together
in one continued Discourse, but his Answers and the Commons Replies Object. 3.
thereto in fractions; not in one continued Discourse, as they were delivered
each day severally at the Bar, and summed up at last in the Lords and Commons
House.

I answer, it is truth: and I did it for these Reasons. First, to avoyde
Prolixity, and tedious Repetitions of the self-samethings: For had I recited
Answ.
his several Answers, Defenses and the Commons Replies to them as they were
made at the Bar each day by themselves; and then repeated his general Answers,
Defenses in the Lords and Commons House, and Mr Brownes Reply thereto
distinctly by themselves, I should have repeated the selfe-samethings, with
very little variation, three or four times over to no purpose; whereas now I
have contracted the sum of all his Answers, Defenses to each particular Charg
and Proof with the Commons Replies thereto into one, to eschew Prolixity and
Tautologies: 2ly, I did it to prevent confusion; and for clearer Discovery of
the truth, the pertinency of the evidence given in against him in each
Particular: For had I contracted all his Answers, Defenses into one, and
represented them in one entire continued Discourse by themselves; and then have
subjoyned the Commons Replies unto them entirely together, the Reader could
never have clearly discovered the frivilousnes, falsenes, or impertinency of
his several Answers to each particular charge, or the strength of the Commons
Replies thereto; nor yet so well have observed, to what particulars he gave
answer, to what not; whereas now by this Perspicuous Method I have followed, in
reciting his Particular Answers and Defense distinctly to each Branch of his
Charge and the Evidence brought to prove it, and then annexing the Commons
Replies thereunto; the Readers may with ease and delight (by comparing the
Charge, Proofs, Answers, Defense and Replies together) most clearly discover
the truth, weight of each Charge and Proof; the weakness, falsenesse, defects,
and insufficiency of all his Answers; the satisfactorines of the Commons
Replies, and his undoubted Guiltiness of all the particulars charged on him.
Thirdly, the Archbishop alleged sundry things in his particular Answers and
Defenses each day, which he omitted in his general Defenses in both Houses;
and added some things in his General Defenses, which he omitted in his
particular; by reason whereof I was necessitated to collect all his scattered
Answers, Defenses to each particular Charge into one, for his better advantage,
and the Commons Replies thereto. Which being thus compacted together, without
interposition of any heterogenius matter in their proper places, for the
premised reasons necessitating me to this method; no rational man can justly
tax me for it, as being no ways injurious to the Archbishops cause, nor
tending to his disadvantage.

These Objections from the Archbishops Prelaticall party being removed, there
are two things more, wherein Your Honors and the World may justly demand some
satisfaction, to exempt me from all causlesse censures.

First, you may justly inquire the Reasons; why this History of the
Archbishops Trial, has stuck so long in my hands before its publication,
seeing it was expected many months since?

Secondly, why it comes forth by parcels only, not complete and entire, after
so long an expectation of the whole trial and proceedings?

To the former demand, I answer: First, that this task was by special Order,
originally imposed upon those Members of the Commons House, that managed the
Evidence, not on me: who totally declining it, some four Months after the
Trial and above 2 Months after the Execution, this work was delegated by the
Commons unto me; at which time most of the Papers, Notes, Books, Evidences,
used at his trial, were laid aside and dispersed into several men's hands:
whereby much time was spent before I could recollect and marshall them into
Order, to digest this History out of them. Secondly, since the assignment of
this task unto my care, I have been almost every day taken up with public
employments for the State, at the Committee of Accounts, and elsewhere, besides
the daily avocations of my particular calling (my only support since our
unhappy Wars) so as I have had few vacant hours to compile it, but those I have
borrowed from my natural rest, whiles others have bin sleeping. Thirdly, I
have since this undertaking, been necessitated to write and publish sundry
other Impressions (incapable of delay) in defense of the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction of Parliaments, Civil Magistrates; and concerning Ecclesiastical
Censures and Church Government, against Independents, Anabaptists, others; yea
to Vindicate the Parliaments just Proceedings, with mine own Innocence, against
the seditious Anti-parliamentary Libels, of that notorious impudent Libeller
and Lyat, L. Col. Lilburn, who still See his late Libell entitled, Innocence
and Truth Justified.
persevers in his trespasses, to the dishonor and scandal of public justice.
All which considered, I suppose Your Honors and others will easily believe, I
wanted no diligence, but leisure only for the speedier accomplishment of this
work: wherein notwithstanding I have not been negligent, witness my
publication of the Breviate of the Archbishops life, and of A necessary
Introduction of his Trial, (amounting to a large Volume) sufficient to assoyle
me from the least imputation of idleness or negligence in this very subject.
Fourthly, Add hereunto the voluminousnesse of this First Part of the
Archbishops Trial only, with the variety of the matter, charges therein
contained; the trouble I had in digesting, the Labor in compiling, writing,
reveiwing, fitting it for and Correcting, Revising it at the Press, with the
coldness of this last winters Vacation, when neither pen, nor Press could
work, for sundry weeks together: and compare this with the former reasons
(and the Printers slacknesse which has delayed it very much) and then I doubt
not but your Honors and all others will rather wonder, how I could possibly
complete this Voluminous Part so speedily, then question or quarrel with me,
why it comes forth so slowly? it being work enough to have swallowed up all my
time since the Order, had I had no other employments to divert me.

To the second demand, I must return this Answer: First, that I Answ. 2.
published this History thus in parcells, for want of time to complete and
print it all together in due season. Secondly, that the long expectation of
this Trial, and men's calling for it every day, induced me to satisfy their
longing appetites, with these First Fruits of it, concerning Religion; (the
thing most looked, most inquired after, both at home and abroad) till the full
crop be ripened for the harvest, which will require some warmer months to
concoct it, ere it can attain to maturity. Thirdly, The great Charge of the
Stationer in Printing this first Part, (the voluminousnesse and price whereof
has, I fear, out-swelled most Chapments purses in these Indegent times) with
the serious consideration of the incertainty of my life and future opportunity,
in these days of War and mortality, to finish the remainder of this Work
(which God willing I intend to complete and publish with all convenient speed)
have induced me, rather to gratify your Honors and the World with these First
fruits for the present, then to hazard the depriving you of it, or the whole
History, if deferred till all were completed.

Having answered these demands, I shall now crave liberty and your Noble
Patience to raise some profitable Observations from the Subject matter of this
History, not unworthy your Honors saddest thoughts.

If you consider the mean obscure Parentage of this Arch-Prelate, his grand
Preferments, the great mischiefs he did in Church, State, and his Execution
after all; it may suggest these profitable contemplations to your minds.

First, That God by his power and all-disposing providence can raise up Persons
of the lowest place or Parentage, to the highest Pinacles of worldly Honor:
according to that in the 1 Samuel 2. 8. and Psalm. 118. 7, 8. He raises up the
Poor out of the dust, and lifts up the Beggar from the dunghill, to set them
among the Princes, and make them inherit the Throne of glory.

2. That God can make the most vile and despicable persons in the world, grand
Pests or Punishments to whole Kingdoms, Nations, when he pleases; Dan. 11.
21, 22. 1 Kings 11. 26. c. 12. 2. etc. c. 13. and 14. (even as he made Frogs,
Lice, Caterpillars (the vilest creatures) a very sore plague to King Pharaoh
and the whole Kingdom of Egypt, Exodus c. 7. 8. and 9.

3. That persons suddenly advanced from the lowest degree of men, to the
highest pitch of honor, prove commonly the most insolent, violent,
domineering, imperious, tyrannical, and mischievous of all such preferments,
being unable to weld or manage the greatness of their fortune. See Mat. 24.
48. to the end, 2 Chro. 10. 8. to 16. Eccles. 10. 1. 6, 7. Psalm. 73. 6. to 13.
Job. 21. 7. to 20.

Fourthly, That grand preferments without great grace to manage, improve them
to Gods glory, and the common good, are greater judgments than blessings, and
for the most part, the immediate occasions of men's greatest ruin by their evil
Counsels, or ill managing of their greatness to the public prejudice, Ps.
73. 3. to 21. Job 21. 7. etc. Psalm. 37. 1. 2. Ester c. 3. to 8.

Fifthly, That mischievous Councillors and wicked Instruments in Church,
State; though never so great in power or Favor with their Princes for a
season, seldom escape condign exemplary punishment at the last: and that no
greatness whatsoever is able finally to protect mischevous Grandees, from the
hand of public justice: Ester 7. 1 Kings 2. 28. to 35.

Let all great ones then seriously consider this, and remember Canterbury, lest
they dye and fall like him.

If we again observe his Preferments, Actions, Proceedings and miserable end as
a Clergy man, we may raise these profitable observations from this History of
his Trial, which all Prelates, Clergy men may do well to consider, is often as
they think of Canterbury.

First, that when Clergy men cast aside or neglect their callings, and turn
mere Statesmen, they commonly prove the very worst and most oppressive Persons
of all others. Matthew. 5. 13. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 3.

Secondly, That one over potent Prelate backed with a Kings Royal power and
favor, is able to unsetleReligion where it is best established, and embroyle,
ruin the most flourishing Churches, Kingdoms in few years space. 2 Thessalonians. 2.
4. 9, 10, 11, 12. Revel. 13. 2. to 18.

Thirdly, That there are no such desperate underminers, persecutors,
suppressors of Gods true Religion, Saints, people, as over potent wicked
Prelates: And that dissembling Potent Protestant Prelates, Clergymen are
greater Enemies to the Protestant Religion for the most part, then professed
Papists: 2 Thessalonians. 2. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12. Revel. 13. Matthew. 24. 5. 11. 24. Acts
20. 22. 30. John 6. 70, 71.

Fourthly, That the foulest Practices, Conspiracies against the Protestant
Religion may be and usually are gilded over with the most specious pretenses
for its Advancement. And therefore it concerns us always to weigh and judge
of men by their Actions, not their Protestations: Matthew. 7. 15. Rev. 13. 2. to
18.

Fifthly, That the most hopeful designs, the most successful Plots,
Proceedings against the true Religion and Saints of God, do always prove
abortive in conclusion; and that the prevailing contrivances, successes of many
years travel in this kind are usually, by a divine overruling providence,
often times, like so many Cobwebs, swept down, dashed in pieces, and wholly
disappointed in a moment, when they are nearest accomplishment in all humane
probability Ps. 73. 18, 19, 20. Psalm. 21. 11, 12. Genesis 11. 3. etc. Exodus 14. 19
to 31. Esaias. 8. 9. 10.

Sixthly, That God in his infinite wisdom and justice can turn all the Plots,
Coutrivances of wicked men to ruin his truth, Church, people, to be the proper
immediate instruments of their contrivers ruin. (He takes the wise in their
own craftiness, etc. Job. 5. 12, 13, 14.) and to the advancement of his
Gospel, Cause, people, as he did in the cases of Joseph, and Mordecay.

Seventhly, That great Ecclesiastical or temporal Preferments and Court
Favors, seldom make men better but worser then before: Deuteronomy. 6. 10, 11, 12.
c. 8. 10. 19. 2 Chronicles. 26. 16. c. 31. 25, 26.

Eighthly, That those who are Superstitious or Presumptuous in their life time,
are seldom penitent, but for the most part obstinate, senseless or desperate
at their deaths; and have commonly a greater care to support their cracked
credits, by justifying or denying their evil actions, then to save their
souls, by confessing or bewailing their guilt.

This was the condition of this Arch-Prelate who lived to survive and behold
the downfall of all his Popish Plots, Innovations, Superstitions, Canons, the
High Commission and Prelacy it self, the grand Idols he endeavored to set up
and perpetuate among us; Yet all the Superstitions, Idolatries, Romish Errors,
Tyrannous oppressions he had maintained, practiced in his life, he most
obstinately justified, without the least remorse, or acknowledgment of guilt,
of error, both at his Trial and Death. Yea though he were so conscious to
himself of all the crimes wherewith he was charged, that he procured a Pardon
from Oxford under the Kings own hand and great Seal, soon after the beginning
of his Trial (which made him so bold, so peremptory at the Bar;) yet lest it
should imply or argue a guiltiness in him, he chose rather to conceal this
Pardon, and stand upon his plenary justification, till after his condemnation,
then produce or plead it; not sending it to your Honors till he was ordered to
be hanged at Tyburne: upon which occasion he acquainted both Houses with it, to
deprecate and exchange that punishment for a more Honorable kind of execution
on the Scaffold at Tower hill, where his head was chopped off, instead of a
Hanging at Tyburne. And although all ingenious men would have imagined, that
the blood of the many Souls he had starved, seduced, destroyed all his time by
suppressing preaching, suspending, silencing, censuring, banishing godly
Ministers, Lecturers without any real Cause, pressing the Book of Sports,
introducing Popish, Arminian Soul-destroying Errors, Superstitions,
Innovations, Prophanations; with the blood of the bodies of diverse thousands
shed in England, Scotland, Ireland, by our unhappy Wars (originally occasioned
and stirred up by him) might have been prevalent enough to relent his
Adamantine heart, and draw forth tears of repentance, of compunction from his
eyes and soul, yet such was his desperate Obstinacy and Impenitency on the
scaffold, that he never so much as confessed or bewailed at his death these
bloody crimes, nor any of those Traiterous Offenses for which he was justly
condemned; but with a brow of brass and heart of stone, impudently justified
his Innocence, nay Crimes to the utmost, without demanding Pardon of them from
God or Man, though he took this ensuing Pardon from the King (a sufficient
evidence of his guilt) which I have Verbatim transcribed out of the Original
passed under the Great Seal at Oxford.

By this Arch-Prelates embracing and the Kings granting of this large Universal
Pardon, of all Treasons etc. himself his Prelaticall Party, together with his
Majesty and his Adherents of all sorts, are eternally concluded to plead his
Innocence, proclaim him a Martyr, or Canonize him for a meritorious Saint, as
they have done. Yea, his Majesty's Royal care and serious endeavor to rescue
such an Arch Traitor as He (impeached of High Treason and other grand Crimes by
two whole Kingdoms) from the hands of common Justice, and the Supremest
Judicatory in Parliament, by this Regal Charter of Pardon, when as he could
not effect it by his Army Royal and force of Arms, discovers both His own
unhappiness and our Kingdoms too in this, that he has hitherto affected not
only Treason, but Traitors to our Church and State, more then his faithfulest
Parliament, or most loyal Subjects: which dangerous Error, I pray God his
Majesty after all his various miscarriages, disappointments, losses, by such
mischevous persons, may now at last discern, reject, and never henceforth
favourany such Traitors, ill Counselors, Prelates, or Archbishops more, whose
extirpation root and branch, your Honors have already voted. And that no doubt
upon just reasons, since the very best and learnedest in all the whole pack of
Prelates, even the Primate of Armagh, Bishop Usher, (of whom most men have
hitherto had a very honorable opinion, though a great servant and Instrument of
Canterburies in Ireland, as appears by sundry original Letters to him under
his hand) has extremely degenerated in his Christian zeal for the Protestant
Religion, even in his own bleeding Country since he turned Royalist and
Cavalier; as appears by this testimony under the handwriting of that valiant
Noble Knight Sir Charles Coote; which for Poor dying Irelands sake ( See the
Irish Cabinet.
to corroborate the late admirable discoveries from thence by the Popish
Archbishop of Tuams Papers and others, surprised by this Sir Charles) I dare
not conceal.

I SIR Charles Coote do hereby testify, that being at Oxford the last Summer
as one of the Agents for the Protestants of Ireland, and finding the Irish
Popish Agents then to be very prevalent there, and the Archbishop of Armagh to
be often present at the Debates concerning the business of Ireland, and
conceiving him to have some power with his Majesty, I addressed my self to the
said Archbishop, and besought him, that he would interpose his power with his
Majesty in the behalf of the Protestants; for if the Irish Agents obtained
their desires, the Protestants in Ireland were destroyed and Popery would be
introduced: to which the Archbishop replied; That was the intention, which he
knew better then I did, and said, Note.
WE MUST SUBMIT: Dated this 14. of April. 1645.

CHARLES COOTE.

A very strange speech of a Saint-seeming Protestant Arch-Prelate. What? must
we submit to the destruction of the Protestants in Ireland, and the
introduction of Popery there, and not once oppose it? and will such an
Arch-Prelate as he refuse to use his utmost interest in the Kings favor to
withstand it, when desired? If this be the Doctrine of the zealous Lord Primate
of Ireland, that we must submit to the introducing of Popery there, (the
projected design of the Primate and Metropolitan of all England and Ireland
too, the better to accomplish it in England, as we have here and elsewhere
manifested) the God of heaven for ever deliver us from such an hypocritical
false Archiepiscopall generation of Vipers, whose heads and hopes of succession
in both Kingdoms, we trust Your Honors have for ever cut off in the
decapitation of this Archbishop of Canterbury, the very worst of al his
Traiterous Predecessors, their crimes being all concentred in him; whose famous
Trial, Judgment, Execution, shall eternize Your memorable Justice to
posterity, and deter all other ambitious pragmaticall Clergy men, from treading
in his fatal footsteps: the sign of the Archbishops head, when seriously
beheld, being as good, a Memento for wicked Prelates, Counselors, to scare
them from his traiterous practices, as the sight of a corrupt Judges skin in
Herodotus, nailed to the Tribunal, was to his successors, to deter them from
bribery and injustice.

If I have done any acceptable service for Your Honorable Assembly and the
Church of God, in pubilshing these first Fruits of my Obedience to Your just
Desires, the favorable Acceptance of what I have already composed with much
difficulty and less exactness then I desired, will be an encouragement to me
(if God send life and leisure) to present Your Honors in due season with the
remainder of this History. In the mean time I shall become a daily Orator to
the Throne of Grace, to make and continue Your Honorable Houses and
Committees, a Jer. 31. 23. c. 50. 7.
mountain of holiness, an habitation of Justice; to Deuteronomy. 33. 21.
execute the Justice of the Lord, Psalm. 82. 3.
to do Justice to the afflicted and needy, in ridding them out of the hands of
the wicked; and to distribute equal speedy judgment to all oppressed ones who
complain unto, and on all Delinquents justly convicted before Your Honors,
without any respect of persons, or byasse of interest or affections, according
to the old inflexible rules of Law and Justice; that so no person whatsoever
may have any occasion to take up the Prophets complaint against You, (as John
Lilburn in his late Libels; Englands Birthright, with others.
some have causlesly done) That Isa. 59. 4. 9. 14
Judgment is turned away backward, justice stands a far off, and equity
cannot enter, there is no judgment in their goings. I say 5. 7.
We looked for judgment but behold oppression; for righteousness but behold a
cry: Eccl 3. 16.
Moreover we saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was
there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there: Isa. 1 21.
It was full of Judgment, righteousness lodged in it heretofore, but now
murderers and oppressers: Ier. 9. 22.
Is there no Balm in Gilead? is there no Physician there? why then is not the
health of the daughter of our people recovered? But that al such falls clamours
being wholly silenced by Your care and justice, our whole Nation may
unanimously trumpet forth these worthy praises of your Houses, Committees, that
Justice and Judgment are the Habitation of Your Throne (as they are of Ier. 9.
22.
Gods) and that, like good King David, you all 2 Samuel 8. 15.
do execute justice and judgment to all the people; judging them with just
judgment, without wresting, perverting justice or respect of persons, and that
which is altogether just do you (r) Deuteronomy. 16. 18. 19. 20.
follow, Which will be Your Honors brightest Crown of glory, our Kingdoms
greatest security, our peoples most desirable Felicity; yea, is and shall be
the Vote, the Prayer of

Your Honors most devoted Servant, WILLIAM PRYNNE.
Lincolns Inn, April 20, 1646.
To the Christian Reader.
CHristian Reader, that experimental Observation of the natural Historian,
Plin. Not. Hist. lib. 10. c. 63.
Quo majus est animal, tanto diutius formatur in utero, etc. Singulos gignunt
Elephanti, Acanthis (auis minima) duodenas. Ocyssime pariunt qui plurimos
gignunt: may be a satisfactory Apology for the Slownesse, the Singleness of
this long-expected Birth: Elephants are much longer forming, ripening in the
Womb, then Mice: and Cathedral Histories, as well as Churches, require more
time to finish them, then Petty Relations. We read John 2. 20. that the later
Temple of Jerusalem was 46. years in building yet this large folio Edifice
has been compiled, completed within the compass of so many Weeks,
notwithstanding my many other daily interruptions, Avocations, public and
private; in so much that none can justly tax me with Sloathfulnesse or
Negligence in this public Service; the toylesomnesse whereof has deterred all
others from undertaking it, and devolved it wholly upon me; who in regard of my
few Vacant Minutes for such a vast Undertaking, must humbly crave thy pardon
for all Defects, Errataes, Oversights either in the penning or printing.

In this part of the Archbishops Trial, thou may clearly discern, not
only his Popish Spirit, together with his Activity, and Jesuiticall Practices
to undermine our established Religion, introduce Popery among us by degrees,
and reduce us back to our ancient Vassallage to Rome; but likewise read over a
true Ecclesiastical History of our Church during all the time of his
domination: and from the result of all; I shall desire thee, like the
industrious sagacious Be, which extracts honey out of poisonous Herbs, to
collect some profitable Meditations for thy spiritual advantage: Some whereof
I have already hinted in the Epistle Dedicatory, and shall here but lightly
touch.

First, here thou may see, that of the Psalmist so experimentally verified,
that thou may take up his very words Ps. 37. 35, 36, 38. I have seen the
wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree: Yet he
passed away and lo he was not; yea I sought him but he could not be found. The
transgressors shall be destroyed together, the end of the wicked shall be cut
off. And though for a time, they are not in trouble neither are they plagued
like other men; Therefore pride compasses them about as a chain, violence
covers them as a garment etc. Yet if thou observe their ends, thou must
needs conclude with the same Psalmist Ps. 73. 18. 19 20, Surely thou did set
them in slippery places, thou castedst them down into destruction: How are they
brought into desolation, as in a moment? they are utterly consumed with
Terrors: As a dream when one awaketh, so O Lord, when thou awakest thou shall
despise their image. That of Zophar being really verified in this Arch Prelate
Job. 20. 5. to 10. The triumphing of the Wicked is short, and the joy of an
hypocrite but for a moment: Though his excellency mount unto the Heavens, and
his head reach unto the clouds; Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung;
they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? He shall fly away as a dream
and shall not be found; The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither
shall his place any more behold him.

Secondly, hence thou may learn the truth of Solomon's Observation, Prove.
21. 30. There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord.
Certainly all such wisdom, counsel as this employed against God, his
Ordinances, Gospel, people, though never so accurately managed, so politickly
contrived, so powerfully backed, so successefully advanced for a time will in
conclusion be brought to naught, and made of none effect, Ps. 33. 10. Acts 5.
38. Isay 19. 11, 12, 13. c. 8, 9. 10. Job 9. 4. Whereas the counsel cause, and
Church of God, maugre all opposition, shall stand for ever, and cannot be
overthrown. Ps. 33. 11. Acts 5. 39. Isay 46. 10.

Thirdly, Let all Gods people learn from hence, never to fear the force,
threats or power of the greatest Persecutors breathing, since they are but
mortal men, who shall themselves be trodden down and brought to Judgment in
Gods due time: During my many years heavy pressures under this Arch-Prelates
Tyranny, my spirit was exceedingly elevated even to a magnanimous contempt, and
holy slighting of all his overswaying power, menaces, proceedings, as most
despicable, with the consideration of these two Scriptures, which were ever
fresh in my thoughts. Isay. 51. 12. 13. I, even I am he that comfort you,
who art thou that thou should be afraid of a man that shall dye, or of the
son of man that shall be made as grass? And forgettest the Lord thy maker,
who stretched forth the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the Earth: and
have feared continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if
he were ready to destroy; and where is the fury of the oppressor? And Ps. 92.
7 8, 9. When the wicked spring as the grass, and all the Workers of iniquity
do flourish: it is, that they shall be destroyed for ever. But thou O Lord art
most high for evermore: For lo thine enemies, O Lord, lo thine enemies shall
perish: and all the Workers of iniquity shall be scattered. Certainly he who
believes these sacred Texts and meditates seriously on them, will never dread
the potency, t^ra^ny, or menaces of any mortal, in a good cause or quarrel.

Fourthly, Meditate from hence, the vanity, instability and danger of greatness
without goodness: the impotency of the greatest humane power, honor, favor,
to exempt or secure evil Counselors, or public Malefactors from the sword of
Justice; The unhappy fatal ends of Wicked Royal Favorites, who by humouring
their Princes in unjust oppressive courses, usually in the conclusion, do but
destroy themselves, and prejudice their Princes most of any, as this
Arch-Prelate has done: The certain ruin of all bloody Persecutors of Gods
people: together with the infinite wisdom and power of Almighty God, who can
wisely order, overrule the mischievous Plots, and malicious contrivances of his
most desperate Enemies to advance his own Honor, Cause, Gospel, People; to
effect the quite contrary to what they intended, and to bring about his own
ends and their downfalls.

Many such cordial meditations, and sweet contemplations will this History
afford thee for thy comfort, thy encouragement in thy constant Christian
profession in times of greatest danger and hottest persecution. The good Lord
so sanctify it and them to thy Soul, that this Archbishop, who by his Life and
Doctrine wrought so much mischief and sorrow to our Church for a season, but
no present good at all; may bring much consolation, Edification to it, and
thee, by this his Trial and Death:

Farewell.

Monopolies, projects to raise moneys without a Parliament, and as the chief

by consequence most Courts of Justice, Civil, or Ecclesiastical, at his
devotion, did extremely ^e^, persecute and trample upon both the Laity and
Clergy that opposed any of his Innovations or Projects at his pleasure, and
those whom he could not conquer by his Episcopal, he would be sure to
overtop and crush by his temporal Authority; So as the Laity upon all
occasions found him more then a King, and the Clergy more then a Pope, both of
them (except his own Creatures and Confederates only) an into ^^eiable, yea

hundreds in the Star Chamber, High Commission, and Councell-Chamber
oppressed, close imprisoned, fined, banished, pillored, stigmatized, spoiled of
their ears, freeholds, callings, liberties, deprived, degraded and quite
undone by his oppreson, he being commonly more excessive, extravagant,
violent, in his public Censures, and Speeches, then any other whatsoever;
having quite forgotten these Divine qualifications which the Apostle requires
in an EVANGELICALL BISHOP; 1 Timothy 3. ^ir. 1. 7, 8.
A Bishop must be blameless, as the Steward of God; not selfe-willed, not
soon angry, no striker, not a brawler, not lifted up with pride; but, a lover
of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate, gentle unto all men, apt to teach,
patient, in m^^kenesse instructing those that oppose themselves; And utterly
abhorred that memorable precept of our most mild Savior, as Apocryphan, or
unmeer for his imitation: Luke 6. 36. Be you therefore merciful, as your
heavenly Father is merciful.

This ambitious Ovid Metam. l. 2.
Phaeton having thus mounted himself aloft in Phoebus Chariot did drive it on
with such fury and violence, for sundry years that at last he set all our
Churches and Realms in a flaming fire, which could not be quenched by any
other means but by wresting the reins of Government out of his usurping hand,
through the power and justice of our present Parliament (which he held fast for
sundry years in despite of all former Parliamentary or popular oppositions)
and precipitating him from his Chariot, with a breake-neck blow, by that Axe of
public Justice, which lately severed his head from his shoulders, in the view
of thousands: with which spectacle of justice Phoebus himself was so well
pleased that his clouded rays immediately brake out most gloriously upon the
place of execution, and his radiant smiles expressed his well-pleasednes with
this laudable Act of his execution, for the several high Treasons and capital
Crimes not only objected, but proved against him at his Trial; the History
whereof and all proceedings relating thereunto, I shall here represent unto the
world with as much brevity and sincerity as possible; not in the self same
manner and method (according to the order of the Articles) as the Commons
proceeded against him at the bar, being more (...) intricare; but in that more
methodicall way, as the first Breviate of the proofs against him was
contrived, and his evidence repeated and summed up at last both in the Lords
and Commons House by Master Samuel Brown, under those distinct general heads,
to which all his charge and the proofs thereof were reduced.

I shall begin ab ovo, with the very first proceedings against him in
Parliament, next proceed in order to his Trial then to his Judgment and
Execution.

On the Sea the Breviate of his life, page 22. and Diurnall Occurrences, page
13. and 14. the Commons Journall
16. of December. 1640. Upon the condemnation of the New Canons in the House of
Commons, as being against the Kings Prerogative, the fundamental Laws of the
Realm, the liberty and property of the Subject and containing diverse things
tending to sedition, and of dangerous consequence; The Archbishop of
Canterbury was there accused to be the Author of, the chief Actor in them and
impeached likewise of High Treason: whereupon a special Committee was
appointed to inquire into all his actions, and prepare a charge against him;
which I find thus expressed in the Commons Journall.

16. December 1640.

THis Committee is to prepare the several Votes concerning the New-Canons and
to make them ready for this House to present the same to the Lords, and to
consider and examine who were the promoters of these new Canons, and who the
principle Actors, and what execution has been made upon them and by whom; and
to consider how far the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, has been an Actor
in all the proceedings of them, and further to examine how far he has been
an Actor in the great design of the subvertion of the Laws of the Realm, and
of the Religion, and to prepare and draw up a charge against him and such
others as shall appear offenders in these particulars, and have power to send
for parties, witnesses, Papers, Books, Records, and to do any other act,
which they in their judgments shall think fit to conduce to the business,
and are to meet at four a Clock this afternoon in the Star Chamber.

The very same morning in the Lords House, He was accused by the Scottish
Commissioners for an Incendiary between both Kingdoms who promised to draw up
and exhibit a complaint in writing against him the next morning, which they
accordingly performed. Whereupon at a Conference of both Houses the Scots
charge against him (hereafter registered) was the same morning read by the Lord
Paget, and after that reported to the Commons House.

On Friday the 18. of the same December, the Archbishop was impeached in the
house of Commons of high Treason, and Voted by the whole house to be a Traitor,
thus entered in their Iournall.

18. December 1640.

REsolved upon the Question, that a Message shall be sent from this House to
the Lords to accuse William Land Archbishop of Canterbury of High Treason in
name of this House, and of all the Commons of England, and to desire, that he
may be forthwith sequestered from Parliament and be committed, and that within
some convenient time, this House will resort to their Lordships with particular
acsations and Articles against him.

Mr. Hollis is appointed to go up to the Lords with this Message:

Upon this his accusation, diverse notable Speeches were made against him in
the Commons House; among others, one by Master Grymstone, published soon after
in print, which I shall here subjoyne.

Master Grymstones Speech IN PARLIAMENT, Upon the Accusation and Impeachment of
William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, of High TREASON.
Mr. Speaker;

THere has been presented to the House, a most faithful and exact Report of
the conference we had with the Lords Yesterday, together with the opinion of
the Committees, that were employed in that service.

That they conceived it fit, the Archbishop of Canterbury should he
sequestered.

I must second the motion, and with the favor of the House, I shall be hold
to offer my reasons, why I conceive it most necessary, we should proceed a
little further, than the desire of above sequestration. Master Speaker, long
introductions are not suitable to weighty businesses, we are fallen upon the
great man, the Archbishop of Canterbury; Look upon him as he is in his
Highness, and he is the stye of all pestilent filth, that has infected the
State, and Government of the Church and Common Wealth: look upon him in his
dependanties, and he is the man, the only man that has raised and advanced
all those (that together with himself) have been the Authors and causers of
all the NOTE.
raines, miseries and calemities, we now groan under.

Who is it but he only, that has brought the Earl of Strafford to all his
great place and employments, a fit instrument and spirit to act and execute all
his blouay designs in these Kingdoms?

Who is it but he only that brought in Secretary Windebanke into the place of
Secretary and trust, the very Broker and Pander to the Whore of Babylon?

Who is it, Master Speaker, but he only that has advanced all Popish
Bishops? I shall name some of them, Bishop Manwaring, the Bishop of Bath and
Wells, the Bishop of Oxford, and Bishop Wren, the least of all, but the most
unclean one.

These are men that should have sed Christ's Flock, but they are the Wolves
that devoured them; the Sheep should have fed upon the Mountains, but the
Mountains have eaten up the Sheep. It was the happiness of the Church, when
the zeal of Gods House did eat up the Bishops, glorious and brave Martyrs,
that went to the flaks, in defense of the Protestant Religion; but the zeal of
these Bishops has been to eat up and persecute the Church.

Who is it Master Speaker, but the great Archbishop of Canterbury, that has
set at the Helm to guide and steer them to all the managing of their Projects
that have been sit on foot in this Kingdom these ten years last past, and
rather than he would stand out, he has most unworthily trucked and chaffered
in the meanest of them? As for instance, that of Tobacco, wherein thousands of
poor people have been stripped and turned out of their Trades, for which they
have served as Apprentises; we all know he was the Compounder, and contractor
with them for the Licenses, putting them to pay Fines, and Fee-Farme rents to
use their Trades.

Certainly, Master Speaker, he might have spent his time better (and more for
his Grace, in the Pulpit; then thus sharking and raking in the Tobacco shop.

Mr. Speaker, we all know what he has been charged withal here in this
House, Crimes of a dangerous consequence, and of transcendent nature, no less
than the subversion of the Government of this Kingdom, and the alteration of
the Protestant Religion, and this not upon bare information only, but much of
it comes before us already, upon clear and manifest proofs, and there is
scarce any business, Grievance, or Complaint, come before us in this place,
wherein we do not find him intermingled and as it were twisted into it, like
a busy and angry Waspe, his sting is in the tail of every thing.

We have this day heard the report of the Conference yesterday; and in it the
Accusations which the Scottish Nation has charged him with all: And we do all
know he is guilty of the same (if not more) in this Kingdom.

Mr. Speaker, he has been, and is the common enemy to all goodness and good
men, and it is not safe, that such a Viper shall be near to his Majesty's
person, to distill his poison into his sacred ears, nor is it safe for the
Commonwealth that he should sit in so eminent place of government being thus
accused; We know what we did in the Earl of Straffords case. This man is the
corrupt Fountain that has infected all the streams, and till the Fountain
be purged, we cannot expect to have any clear Channels. I shall be bold
therefore to offer my opinion, and if I err, it is the error of my Judgment,
and not my want of zeal and affection to the public good.

I conceive it most necessary and fit, that we should now take up a Resolution
to do somewhat, to strike whilst the Iron is hot; And go up to the Lords in
the name of this House, and in the, name of the Commons of England, and to
accuse him of high Treason, and to desire their Lordships his person may be
sequestered, and that in convenient time we may bring up the Charge.

After the House had this day voted the Arch Bishop a Traitor, Mr. Hollis the
same day was sent up to the Lords to accuse him of High Treason, which he did
immediately, in the general, without any particular charge, assuring the Lords,
that in convenient time there should be a particular charge exhibited against
him by the Commons to make good the accusation: Wherefore he desired the Lords,
that the Arch Bishop might be sequestered from the House and committed; hereupon
he was forthwith committed to the Gentleman Usher, but yet permitted to go in
his company to Lambeth for some books to read in, and such Papers as pertained
to his defense against the Scotts charge; And what papers of greatest
consequence he then conveyed away thence, burned, or defaced, is worthy inquiry.

Master Hollis his report from the Lords I find thus entered in the Commons
Iournall.

18. December 1640.

Master Hollis reported, that according to the command of this House, he had
delivered to their Lordships the Message; that my Lord Keeper said, Their
Lordships had considered of the Message, and accordingly they had sequestered
the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury from Parliament, and had committed him in
safe custody to the Gentleman Usher of their House.

The Lords Order for his commitment is thus entered in their Journall.

18. December 1640.

It is this day Ordered, that the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury (being accused
of high Treason by the house of Commons in their own names, and in the name of
the whole Kingdom of England) be committed to the safe custody of the
Gentleman Usher attending this high Court, and that he be sequestered from the
said House, until his Grace shall clear himself of the Accusations that
shall be laid against him by the said House.

This proud imperious Arch-Prelate, who had close-imprisoned others for sundry
years in remote Castles in foreign Islands, merely for opposing his Tyranny
and Innovations, excluding not only their Friends, but Wives, Children from the
least access unto their Prisons, or the Isles wherein they were exiled, for
their comfort or relief; was yet so impatient of restraint himself, that
immediately after his Commitment to Master Maxwels house at Chearing, Cross,
though he had convenient lodgings, more liberty by far then he demerited, and
all his friends free access to visit him, yet he became an humble suitor to
the House of Peers (even in the wet cold winter season, when a warm lodging in
most men's judgment was more wholesome for him, then cold moist walks, that he
might have liberty to go abroad with his Keeper to take the Air, which
liberty himself would never indulge to any Prisoner committed by him, for the
least offense, especially under the Notion of a Puritan: O strange impatience,
worthy admiration that he who had close Imprisoned many Godly Christians,
Ministers, mobscure holes and Dungeons, without the least pity or indulgence,
diverse years; even for well doing, or petty offenses against himself, should
not be able to endure a few weeks imprisonment, (when charged with high
Treason it self, against the King and Kingdom,) without Petitioning for
liberty to take the Air. A request so unseasonable, that no wise Man in his
condition would have demanded it, and the Parliament in Justice or Honor could
not condescend to it. But this suit of his being deemed unseasonable, was
rejected.

And here behold the common Genius of Tyrannical domineering spirits, none so
inexorable, merciless, insensible of others unjust oppressions as they in the
ruff of their prosperity, none more degenerous, pusilanimous, querulous,
impatient, or sordidly base then they in the storms of adversity. Let this
Arch-Prelates sudden downe-fall from the Pinnacle of Honor, Power, into a
restrained despicable condition, and his impatience under it, be a future
admonition to all Lording Prelates, and Tyr^nizing Grandees, to carry
themselves with all moderation in their places, and to learn this good lesson
from an heathen Poet, which most men in the hight of their felicity are
over-apt to forget.

What occurrences happened between the Archbishops restraint and his
commitment to the Tower, you may read in his Diary, and in the Page 23. 24.
^roviat of his life.

On the 22. of February 1640. the House of Commons Ordered, that to morrow
morning, the Report concerning the Articles against the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, be first read if it be ready.

On February 23. they further Ordered Mr. Pym to make the report of the
Articles against the Archbishop of Cant. the next morning.

February 24. Mr. Pym presented from the Committee appointed for that purpose
the Articles against the Archbishop of Canterbury, The Title to the Articles,
the Articles themselves, and the conclusion to them were all severally twice
read, and all severally voted, and past upon the question, and afterward by
resolution upon the Question, it was ordered that these Articles so read and
voted should be engrossed.

February 26. The Articles against the Archbishop of Canterbury which were
formerly ordered to be engrossed, were now read, and it was resolved upon the
question, that the Articles thus engrossed and read should be sent up to the
Lords in maintenance of the Charge against the Archbishop of Canterbury,
whereby he stands charged of high Treason, Mr. Pymme, Mr. Hampden, and Mr.
Maynard, went up with the Articles according to the former Order.

Upon the reading of these Articles the Lords made this Order for his the
Archbishops commitment to the Tower.

26. February 1640.

ORdered by the Lords in Parliament, that the Lord Archbishop of Cant. his
Grace, shall stand committed to the Tower of London. But the pleasure of this
house is, that he continue still in the safe custody of the Gentleman Usher of
this House till M^nday the first of March 1640 and then that the Letutenant
receive his Grace into his safe Custody, until the pleasure of this House he
further known, and in the mean time Mr. Maxwell is to be responsible for him,
and not to permit him to go abroad, and that the Archbishop os Canterbury, and
the Earl of Strafford shall not come together.

Mr. Pym returns and acquaints the House, that according to his Abilities he
had performed their commands, and it was ordered, that thanks should be given
him for the good service he had therein done this House.

Thus the Commons Iournall relates the times and manner of these proceedings
and Articles against Canterbury, unanimously voted by all when both Houses were
fullest, with the concurring suffrages of all those Members who have since
deserted the Parliament, and repaired, to Oxford, some of whom made bitter
Invectives against him, whose mouths must be for ever stopped, by their own
suffrages in full Parliament, from uttering any thing in lustification of this
Arch-Traitor, or in derogation of the Judgment and execution passed against him
upon the several Articles of his Impeachment, which I shall here Present you
with altogether, beginning with the Original Articles of the House of Commons,
(carried up by Master Pym and others, whose speech at their delivery I have
here annexed to them as they were printed by order of the house long since,
next adjoining the Scottish Commissioners Charge against him, and then the
Commons Additionall Articles.

ARTICLES OF The COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT: In maintenance of their
Accusation against WJLLJAM LAVD, Archbishop of CANTERBVRY: whereby he stands
Charged with High Treason, Presented and carried up to the LORDS, by Mr. John
Pym, Febr. 26. 1640.
Mr. Pym coming to the Lords bar to present the Articles, spoke as follows,

My LORDS;

I Am commanded by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses now assembled for the
Master Pyme Speech.
Commons in Parliament; to deliver to your Lordships these Articles, in
maintenance of their Charge against the Archbishop of Canterbury. Their desire
is, that first your Lordships would be pleased to hear the Articles read, and
then I shall endeavor to present to you the sense of the Commons, concerning
the nature of the Charge, and the order of their proceedings.

FIRST;

THat he has traitorously endeavored to subvert the Fundamental Laws, and
government of this Kingdom of England, and instead thereof to introduce an
Arbitrary, and tyrannical Government against law; and to that end, has
wickedly and traitorously advised His Majesty, that he might at his own will
and pleasure, leavie, and take money of his Subjects, without their consent in
Parliament; and this he affirmed was warrantable by the Law of God.

2. He has for the better accomplishment of that his traitorous design,
advised and procured Sermons, and other discourses to be preached, printed, and
published, in which the Authority of Parliaments, and the force of the Laws
of this Kingdom, have been denied; and absolute and unlimited power over the
persons and estates of His Majesty's subjects maintained and defended, not
only in the King, but in himself, and other Bishops, against the Law: And he
has been a great protector, savourer, and promoter of the publishers of such
false and pernicious opinions.

3. He has by Letters, Messages, Threats, and promises, and by diverse other
ways to Judges, and other Ministers of justice, interrupted and perverted, and
at other times by means aforesaid, has endeavored to interrupt, and pervert
the course of Justice in His Majesty's Courts at Westminster, and other Courts,
to the subversion of the Laws of this Kingdom, whereby sundry of His
Majesty's Subjects have been stopped in their just suits, deprived of their
lawful right, and subjected to his tyrannical will to their ruin, and
destruction.

4. That the said Archbishop has traitorously and corruptly told ustice to
those who have had causes depending before him, by color of his
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, as Archbishop, High Commissioner, Referree, or
otherwise, and has taken unlawful gifts, and bribes of His Majesty's
Subjects, (and has as much as in him lies) endeavored to corrupt the other
Courts of justice, by advising and procuring His Majesty to sell places of
Judicature, and other Offices contrary to the Laws and Statutes in that behalf.

5. He has traitorously caused a book of Canons to be composed, and published
without any lawful warrant, and authority in that behalf; in which pretended
Canons, many matters are contained contrary to the Kings Prerogative, to the
fundamental Laws, and Statutes of this Realm, to the right of Parliament, to
the propriety, and liberty of the Subject, and matters tending to sedition,
and of dangerous consequence, and to the establishment of a past, unlawful,
and presumptuous power in himself, and his successors: many of which Canons,
by the practice of the said Archbishop were surreptitiously passed in the late
Convocation, without due consideration and debate: others by fear and
compulsion were subscribed by the Prelates, and Clerks there assembled, which
had never been voted, and passed in the Convocation as they ought to have
been. And the said Archbishop has contrived, and endeavored to assure and
confirm the unlawful and exorbitant power, which he has usurped and
exercised over His Majesty's Subjects, by a wicked and ungodly oath in one of
the said pretended Canons, enjoined to be taken by all the Clergy, and many of
the Laity of this Kingdom.

6. He has traitorously assumed to himself a papal and tyrannical power,
both in Ecclesiastical, and Temporal matters, over his Majesty's Subjects in
this Realm of England, and in other places, to the disherison of the Crown,
dishonor of His Majesty, and derogation of his supreme authority in
Ecclesiastical matters; And the said Archbishop claims the Kings
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, as incident to his Episcopal Office, and
Archiepiscopall in this Kingdom and does deny the same to be derived from the
Crown of England, which he has accordingly exercised, to the high contempt of
his Royal Majesty, and to the destruction of diverse of the Kings liege
people, in their persons, and estates.

7. That he has traitorously endeavored to alter and subvert Gods true
Religion, by Law established in this Realm, and in stead thereof to set up
Popish superstition, and Idolatry. And to that end, has declared and
maintained in Speeches, and printed books, diverse popish doctrines, and
opinions contrary to the Articles of Religion established by Law. He has
urged and enjoined diverse popish, and superstitious Ceremonies without any
warrant of Law, and has cruelly persecuted those who have opposed the same, by
corporal punishments, and Imprisonments; and most unjustly vexed others, who
refused to conform thereunto, by Ecclesiastical censures of Excommunication,
Suspension, Deprivation and Degradation, contrary to the Laws of this Kingdom.

8. That for the better advancing of his traitorous purpose and design, he did
abuse the great power, and trust His Majesty reposed in him, and did intrude
upon the places of diverse great Officers, and upon the right of other His
Majesty's Subjects, whereby he did procure to himself the nomination of sundry
persons to Ecclesiastical Dignities, Promotions, and benefices, belonging to
His Majesty, and diverse of the Nobility, Clergy, and others; and has taken
upon him the commendation of Chaplains to the King; by which means he has
preferred to His Majesty's service, and to other great promotions in the
Church, such as have been Popishly affected, or otherwise unsound, and corrupt
both in doctrine and manners.

9. He has for the same traiterous, and wicked intent, chosen and employed,
such men to be his own Domestical Chaplains, whom he knew to be notoriously
disaffected to the reformed Religion, grossly addicted to popish superstition,
and erroneous, and unsound both in judgment and practice, and to them or some
of them has he committed the Licensing of Books to be printed, by which
means diverse false and superstitious books have been published, to the great
scandal of Religion, and to the seducing of many His Majesty's Subjects.

10. He has traitorously and wickedly endeavored to reconcile the Church of
England with the Church of Rome; and for the effecting thereof has consorted,
and confederated with diverse Popish Priests, and Jesuits; and has kept
secret intelligence with the Pope of Rome, and by himself his Agents and
instruments, treated with such as have from thence received authority, and
instruction, he has permitted, and countenanced a Popish Hierarchy, or
Ecclesiastical government to be established in this Kingdom: by all which
traiterous and malicious practices this Church and Kingdom has been
exceedingly endangered, and like to fall under the Tyranny of the Roman See.

11. He in his own person, and his Suffragans, Visitors, Surrogates,
Chancellors and other Officers, by his command, have caused diverse learned
pious, and Orthodox Ministers of Gods Word to be silenced, suspended, deprived,
degraded, excommunicated, and otherwise grieved, without any just and lawful
cause: and by diverse other means he has hindered the preaching of Gods Word,
caused diverse of His Majesty's loyal Subjects to forsake the Kingdom, and
increased, and cherished Ignorance, and profaneness amongst the people, that
so he might the better facilitate the way to the effecting of his own wicked
and traitorous design, of altering, and corrupting the true religion here
established.

12. He has traitorously endeavored to cause division, and discord betwixt
the Church of England, and other reformed Churches; and to that end has
suppressed, See the Charge of the Scottish Commissioners against Canterbury.
and abrogated the Privileges, and Jmmunities, which have been by His
Majesty and his Royal Ancesters granted to the Dutch, and French Churches, in
this kingdom: And diverse other ways has expressed his malice, and
disaffection to these Churches, that so by such disunion, the Papists might
have more advantage for the overthrow, and extirpation of both.

13. He has maliciously and traitorously plotted, and endeavored to stir
up war and enmity betwixt his Majesty's two Kingdoms of England and
Scotland, and to that purpose has labored to introduce into the Kingdom of
Scotland diverse Innovations both in Religion, and Government all or the most
part of them tending to Popery, and superstition, to the great grievance, and
discontent of his Majesty's Subjects of that Nation: and for their refusing to
submit to such Innovations, he did traitorously advise his Majesty to subdue
them by force of Arms, and by his own Authority and Power contrary to Law did
procure sundry of his Majestyes, Subjects and enforced the Clergy of this
Kingdom to contribute toward the maintenance of Which Doctor Pierce Bishop of
Bath and Wels in his speech to his Clergy to set on this contribution, styled
Bellum Episcopale; adding, that what ever his Majesty had expressed in his
Declarations to be the cause of this war, yet in truth this war is FOR US,
Bishops.
that war: And when his Majesty with much wisdom and Justice had made a
Pacification betwixt the two Kingdoms, the said Archbishop did presumptuously
censure that pacification, as dishonorable to his Majesty, and by his
counsels and endeavors, so incensed his Majesty against his said Subjects of
Scotland, that he did thereupon (by advice of the said Archbishop) enter into
an offensive war against them, to the great hazard of his Majesty's person,
and his Subjects of both Kingdoms.

14. That to preserve himself from being questioned for these, and other his
traiterous courses, he has labored to subvert the rights of Parliament and
the ancient course of Parliamentary proceeding, and by false and malicious
slanders to incense his Majesty against Parliaments.

By which words, counsels and actions, he has traitorously, and contrary to
his allegiance labored to alienate the hearts of the Kings liege people from
his Majesty, and to set a devision between them, and to ruin and destroy his
Majesty's Kingdoms; for which they do impeach him of High Treason, against
our Sovereign Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.

The said Commons do further aver, that the said William Archbishop of
Canterbury, during the times that the crimes aforementioned were done, and
committed has been a Bishop or Archbishop of this Realm of England, one of
the Kings Commissioners for Ecclesiastical matters; and one of his Majesty's
most honorable Privy Council, and has taken an oath for his faithful
discharge of the said Office of Councellor, and has likewise taken an oath of
supremacy and Allegiance.

And the said Commons by protestation, saving to themselves the liberty of
exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other accusation or impeachment against
the said Archbishop, and also of replying to the Answers, that the said
Archbishop shall make unto the said Articles, or to any of them, and of
offering further proof also of the Premises or any of them, or of any other
impeachment, or accusation that shall be exhibited by them, as the cause shall,
according to the course of Parliament require, do pray, that the said
Archbishop may be put to answer to all and every the premises, and that such
proceedings, examination, trial, and Judgment may be upon every of them had
and used, as is agreeable to Law and Justice.

The Articles being read Mr. PYMME proceeded in his Specch as follows.

My Lords,

THere is an expression in the Scripture, which I will not presume either to
understand, or to interpret; yet to a vulgar eye it seems to have an aspect
something suitable to the Person and Cause before you: It is a description of
the evil Spirits, wherein they are said to be spiritual wickednesses in high
places. Crimes acted by the spiritual faculties of the Soul, the Will and the
Understanding, exercised about spiritual matters, concerning Gods Worship, and
the Salvation of Man; seconded with power, authority learning, and many other
advantages, do make the party who commits them, very suitable to that
description, Spiritual wickednesses in high places.

These crimes (My Lords) are various in their Nature, heinous in their quality,
and universal in their extent. If you examine them Theologically, as they
stand in opposition to the truth of God, they will be found to be against the
rule of Faith, against the power of godliness, against the means of Salvation.

If you examine them Morally, as they stand in opposition to the light of
Nature, to right reason, and the principles of humane society, you will then
perceive pride without any moderation: such a Pride as that is which exalts it
self above all that is called God. Malice without any provocation; Malice
against virtue, against innocence, against piety, injustice without any means
of restitution, even such injustice as does rob the present times of their
possessions; the future, of their possibilities.

If they be examined (My Lords) by Legal Rules in a Civil way, as they stand
in opposition to the Public Good, and to the Laws of the Land; He will be
found to be a Traitor against his Majesty's Crown, an Incendiary against the
Peace of the State; he will be found to be the highest, the boldest, the most
impudent Oppressor, that ever was; an Oppressor both of King and People.

This Charge (my Lords) is distributed and conveyed into 14. several Articles,
as you have heard; and those Articles are only general: It being the intention
of the House of Commons (which they have commanded me to declare) to make them
more certain and particular by preparatory Examinations to be taken with the
help of your Lordships house, as in the Case of my Lord of Strafford.

I shall now run through them with a light touch, only marking in every of
them some special point of venom, virulency and malignity.

1. The first Article (my Lords) does contain his endeavor to introduce into
this Kingdom an Arbitrary power of Government, without any limitations or
Rules of Law. This (my Lords) is against the safety of the Kings Person, the
honor of his Crown, and most destructive to his people.

Those Causes which are most perfect have not only a power to produce effects,
but to conserve and cherish them. The Seminary virtue, and the Nutritive virtue
in vegetables, do produce from the same principles. It was the defect of
justice, the restraining of oppression and violence that first brought
Government into the World, and set up Kings, the most excellent way of
Government. And by the maintenance of justice all kinds of Government receive a
sure foundation and establishment. It is this that has in it an ability to
preserve, and secure the Royal power of Kings, yea, to adorn and increase it.

2. In the second Article, your Lordships may observe, absolute and unlimited
power, defended by Preaching, by Sermons, and other discourses, printed and
published upon that subject. And truly (my Lords) it seems to be a prodigious
crime, that the truth of God, and his holy Law should be perverted to defend
the lawlesnesse of men. That the holy and sacred function of the Ministry,
which was ordained for instruction of men's souls in the ways of God, should
be so abused, that the Ministers are become the Trumpets of Sedition, the
promoters and defenders of violence and oppression.

3. In the third Article (my Lords) you have the Judges, who under his Majesty
are the dispersers and distributers of Justice, frequently corrupted by fear,
and solicitation; you have the course of Justice in the execution of it,
shamefully obstructed And if a wilful Act of in justice in a Judge be so high
a crime in the estimate of the Law, as to deserve death, under what burden of
guilt does this man lie, who has been the cause of great numbers of such
voluntary and wilful acts of injustice?

4. In the fourth Article, he will be found in his own person to have sold
justice in Causes depending before him. And by his wicked council endeavoring
to make his Majesty a Merchant of the same commodity, only with this
difference, that the King by taking money for places of judicature, should sell
it in gross; whereas the Archbishop sold it by retaile.

5. In the fifth Article there appears a power usurped of making Canons, of
laying obligations on the Subjects in the nature of Law, and this power abused
to the making of such Canons as are in the matter of them very pernicious,
being directly contrary to the prerogative of the King, and the liberty of the
people. In the manner of pressing of them, may be found fraud and shuffling, in
the conclusion violence and constraint; men being forced by terror and
threatening to subscribe to all: which power thus wickedly gotten, they labor
to establish by perjury, injoyning such an Oath for the maintenance of it, as
can neither be taken nor kept with a good conscience.

6. In the sixth Article, you have the King robbed of his Supremacy: you have a
Papal power exercised over his Majesty's Subjects in their consciences, and in
their persons: You have Ecclesiastical jurisdiction claimed by an Incident
right, which the Law declares to proceed from the Crown.

And herein your Lordships may observe that those who labor in civil matters
to set up the King above the Laws of the Kingdom, do yet in Ecclesiastical
matters endeavor to set up themselves above the King. This was first procured
by the Archbishop to be extrajudicially declared by the Judges, and then to be
published in a Proclamation. In doing whereof he has made the Kings Throne but
a footstool for his own and their pride.

7. You have (my Lords) in the seventh Article, Religion undermined and
subverted: you have Popery cherished and defended: you have this seconded with
power and violence, by severe punishment upon those which have opposed this
mischievous intention: and by the subtle and eager prosecution of these men,
has the power of Ecclesiastical Commissioners, of the Star Chamber and
Council Table been often made subservient to his wicked design.

My Lords,

8. You may observe in the eighth Article, great care taken to get into his
own hand the power of nominating to Ecclesiastical Livings and promotions:
you have as much mischeivous, as much wicked care taken in the disposing of
these preferments, to the hinderance and corruption of Religion. And by this
means (my Lords) the Kings sacred Majesty, instead of Sermons, fit for
spiritual instructours, has often had invectives against his people,
encouragement to injustice, or to the overthrow of the Laws. Such Chaplains
have been brought into his service, as have as much as may be, labored to
corrupt his own household and been eminent examples of corruption to others,
which has so far prevailed, as that it has exceedingly tainted the
Universities, and been generally dispersed to all the chief Cities, the
greatest Towns and Auditories of the Kingdom. The grievous effects whereof is
most manifest to the Commons House, there being diverse hundred complaints
there depending in the House against scandalous Ministers, and yet (I believe)
the hundred part of them is not yet brought in.

9. The ninth Article sets out the like care to have Chaplains of his own,
that might be promoters of this wicked and traiterous design: Men of corrupt
judgments, of corrupt practice, extremely addicted to superstition: and to
such men's cares has been committed the Licencing of Books to the Press; by
means whereof many have been published that are full of falsehood, of
scandals; such as have been more worthy to be burnt by the hand of the Hangman
in Smithfield (as I think one of them was) than to be admitted to come into
the hands of the Kings people.

10. In the tenth Article it will appear, how he having made these approaches
to Popery, comes now to close and join more nearly with it; he confederates
with Priests and Jesuits. He, by his instruments negotiates with the Pope at
Rome, and has correspondence with them that he authorized from Rome here. He
has permitted a Roman Hierachie to be set up in this Kingdom. And though he
has bin so careful that a poor man could not go to the neighbor Parish to
hear a Sermon, when he had none at home, could not have a Sermon repeated, nor
prayer used in his own Family, but he was a fit subject for the High Commission
Court; yet the other has been done in all parts of the Realm and no notice
taken of it, by any Ecclesiastical Judges or Courts.

My Lords;

11. You may perceive preaching suppressed in the eleventh, diverse godly and
Orthodox Ministers oppressed in their persons and Estates; you have the Kings
loyal subjects banished out of the Kingdom, not as Elimelecke to seek for
bread in foreign Countries, by reason of the great scarcity which was in
Jsrael; but traveling abroad for the bread of life, because they could not
have it at home, by reason of the spiritual Famine of Gods Word, caused by
this man and his partakers. And by this means you have had the trade, the
Manufactury, the industry of many thousands of his Majesty's subjects carried
out of the Land.

It is a miserable abuse of the spiritual Keys to shut up the doors of
heaven, and to open the gates of Hell, to let in profaneness, ignorance,
superstition, and error. I shall need say no more: These things are evident,
and abundantly known to all.

12. In the twelfth Article (my Lords) you have a division endeavored between
this and the foreign reformed Churches. The Church of Christ is one body, and
the Members of Christ have a mutual relation, as members of the same body,
Unity with Gods true Church every where is not only the beauty, but the
strength of Religion: of which beauty and strength he has sought to deprive
this Church by his manifold attempts to break this union. To which purpose he
has suppressed the privileges granted to the Dutch and French Churches. He
has denied them to be of the same Faith and Religion with us, and many other
ways has he declared his malice to those Churches.

13. In the thirteenth Article, as he has sought to make an Ecclesiastical
division or religious difference between us and foreign Nations, so he has
sought to make a Civil difference between us and his Majesty's subjects of
the Kingdom of Scotland. And these he has promoted by many innovations, there
pressed, by himself and his own authority, when they were incapable of such
alterations, He advised his Majesty to use violence. He has made private and
public Collections toward the maintenance of the War, which he might
justly call his own war. And with all impudent boldness, has struck
Tallies in the Exchequer for diverse sums of money procured by himself, Pro
defensione Regni; when by his Counsels the King was drawn to undertake not a
Defensive, but an Offensive War.

14. He has lastly, thought to secure himself and his party by seeking to
undermine Parliaments, and thereby has labored to bereave this Kingdom of
the Legislative power, which can only be used in Parliaments: and that we
should be left a Kingdom without that which indeed makes and constitutes a
Kingdom; and is the only Means to preserve and restore it from distempers and
decays. He has hereby endeavored to bereave us of the highest Judicatory,
such a Judicatory, as is necessary and essential to our government. Some Cases
of Treason, and others concerning the Prerogative of the Crown, and liberty of
the People. It is the supreme Judicatory to which all difficult Cases resort
from other Courts. He has fought to deprive the King of the Love and Counsel
of his People, of that assistance which he might have from them, and likewise
to deprive the People of that relief of grievances which they most humbly
expect from his Majesty.

My Lords,

The Parliament is the Cabinet wherein the chiefest Jewels both of the Crown
and Kingdom are deposited. The great Prerogative of the King, and liberty of
the People are most effectually exercised and maintained by Parliaments. Here
(my Lords) you cannot pass by this occasion of great thanks to God and His
Majesty for passing the Bill, whereby the frequent course of Parliaments is
established; which I assure my self, he will by experience find to be a
strong foundation both of his honor, and of his Crown.

This is all (my Lords) I have to say to the particulars of the Charge. The
Commons desire your Lordships that they may have the same way of Examination
that they had in the case of the Earl of Strafford: That is, to examine
members of all kinds, of your Lordships House and their own, and others, as
they shall see cause. And those examinations to be kept secret and private,
that they may with more advantage be made use of when the matter comes to
trial.

They have declared that they reserve to themselves the power of making
Additionall Articles, by which they intend to reduce his Charge to be more
particular and certain, in respect of the several times, occasion, and other
circumstances of the offenses therein Charged. And that your Lordships would
be pleased to put this cause in such a quick way of proceeding, that these
great and dangerous crimes together with the offenders may be brought to a just
judgment.

The Charge of the Scottish Commissioners against the Prelate of Canterbury.
NOvations in Religion, which are Universally acknowledged to be the maine
cause of commotions in Kingdoms and states, and are known to be the true
cause of our present troubles, were many and great, beside the books of
Ordination, and Homilies, 1. Some particular alterations in matters of
Religion, pressed upon us without order and against Law, contrary to the form
established in our Kirk. 2. A new book of Canons and Constitutions
Ecclesiastical. 3. A Liturgy or book of Common Prayer, which did also carry
with them many dangerous errors in matters of Doctrine. Of all which we
challenge the Prelate of Canterbury, as the prime cause on earth.

And first, that this Prelate was the Author and urger of some particular
changes, which made great disturbance amongst us, we make manifest: 1. By
fourteen letters subscribed, William Cant. in the space of two years, to one
of our pretended Bishops, Bannatine, wherein he often enjoyneth him and other
pretended Bishops, to appear in the Chapel in their Whites, contrary to the
custom of our Kirk, and to his promise made to the pretended Bishop of
Edinburgh, at the Coronation, that none of them after that time, should be
pressed to wear these garments, there, by moving him against his will to put
them on for that time, wherein he directs him to give order for saying the
English Service in the Chapel twice a day, for his neglect, showing him that
he was disappointed of the Bishopric of Edinburgh, promising him upon the
greater care of these novations, advancement to a better Bishopric, taxing
him for his boldness in preaching the sound Doctrine of the reformed Kirkes,
against Master Mitchell, who had taught the errors of Arminius in the point of
the extent of the merit of Christ, bidding him send up a list of the names of
Councillors and Senators of the College of Justice, who did not communicate
in the Chapel in a form which was not received in our Kirk, commending him
when he found him obsequious to these his commands, telling him that he had
moved the King the second time for the punishment of such as had not received
in the Chapel: and wherein he upbraideth him bitterly, that in his first
Synod at Aberdein, he had only disputed against our Custom of Scotland, of
fasting sometimes on the Lords Day, and presumptuously censuring our Kirk,
that in this we were opposite to Christianity it self; and that amongst us
there were no Canons at all. More of this stuff may be seen in the Letters
themselves.

Secondly, by two papers of memoirs and instructions from the pretended Bishop
of Saint Androis, to the pretended Bishop of Rosse, coming to this Prelate,
for ordering the affairs of the Kirk and Kingdom of Scotland, as not only to
obtain Warrants, to order the Exchequer, the Privy Counsel, the great
Commission of Surrenders, the matter of Balmerino's process, as might please
our Prelates, but warrants also for sitting of the High Commission Court once a
week in Edinburgh, and to gain from the Noblemen, for the benefit of
Prelates, and their adherents, the Abbacies of Kelso, Arbroith, St. Androis,
and Lindors, and in the smallest matters to receive his Commands, as for taking
down Galleries, and stone-walls, in the Kirks of Edinburgh and Saint Androis,
for no other end but to make way for Altars, and adoration toward the East:
which besides other evils made no small noise, and disturbance amongst the
people deprived hereby of their ordinary accommodation for public worship.

The second Novation which troubled our peace, was a book of Canons, and
constitutions Ecclesiastical, obtruded upon our Kirk, found by our General
Assembly to be devised for establishing a tyrannical power, in the persons of
our Prelates, over the Worship of God, over the Consciences, Liberties, and
goods of the People, and for abolishing the whole discipline and government of
our Kirk, by general and provincial Assemblies, Presbyteries, and Kirk
Sessions, which was settled by Law, and in continual practice since the time of
Reformation; that Canterbury was Master of this Work is manifest.

By a Book of Canons sent to him, written upon the one side only, with the
other side blank, for corrections additions, and putting all in better Order at
his pleasure, which accordingly was done, as may appear by interlinings,
marginalls, and filling up of the blanke page with directions sent to our
Prelates; and that it was don by no other than Canterbury, is evident by his
Magisteriall way of prescribing, and by a new copy of these Canons all written
with Saint Androis own hand, precisely to a Letter, according to the former
castigations sent back for procuring the Kings warrant unto it, which
accordingly was obtained, but with an addition of some other Canons, and a
Paper of some other corrections: According to which the Book of Canons thus
composed, was published in Print, the inspection of the Books, Instructions;
and his Letters of joy, for the success of the work and of others Letters of
the Prelate of London, and the Lord Sterling, to the same purpose, all which we
are ready to exhibit, will put the matter out of all debate.

Besides this general, there be some things more special worthy to be
adverted unto, for discovering his Spirit. 1. The fourth Canon of Cap. 8.
Forasmuch as no Reformation in Doctrine or Discipline can be made perfect at
once in any Church; therefore it shall, and may be lawful for the Church of
Scotland at any time to make remonstrance to his Majesty, or his successors,
etc. Because this Canon holds the door open to more Innovations, he writes
to the Prelate of Rosse his privy Agent in all this Work, of his great
gladness, that this Canon did stand behind the Curtain, and his great
desire, that this Canon may be Printed fully, as one that was to be most
useful. Secondly, The title prefixed to these Canons by our Prelates, Canons
agreed upon to be proponed to the several Synods of the Kirk of Scotland, is
thus changed by Canterbury; Canons and Constitutions Ecclesiastical, etc.
ordained to be observed by the Clergy. He will not have Canons come from the
Authority of Synods, but from the power of Prelates, or from the Kings
Prerogative. Thirdly, the formidable Canon, Cap. 1. 3. threatening no less than
Excommunication against all such persons, whosoever shall open their mouths
against any of these Books, proceeded not from our Prelates, nor is to be
found in the Copy sent from them, but is a thunderbolt forged in Canterburies
own fire. Our Prelates in diverse places witness their dislike of Papists. A
Minister shall be deposed, if he be found negligent to convert Papists, Chap.
18. 15. The adoration of the Bread is a superstition to be condemned, Cap. 6.
6. They call the absolute necessity of Baptism an error of Popery. Cap. 6. 2.
But in Canterburies Edition, the name of Papists and Popery is not so much as
mentioned. 5. Our Prelates have not the boldness to trouble us in their
Canons, with Altars, Fonts, Chancels, reading of a long Liturgy before Sermon,
etc. But Canterbury is punctual, and peremptory in all these. Although the
words of the tenth Canon Chap. 3. be fair. yet the wicked intentions of
Canterbury and Rosse, may be seen in the point of justification of a sinner
before God, by comparing the Canon as it came from the Prelates, and as it was
returned from Canterbury, and Printed; our Prelates say thus: It is manifest,
that the superstition of former ages, has turned into a great profaneness,
and that people are grown cold for the most part in doing any good, thinking
there is no place to good works, because they are excluded from justification.
Therefore shall all Ministere, as their Text gives occasion, urge the
necessity of good works, as they would be saved, and remember that they are
Via Regni, the way to the Kingdom of Heaven, though not causa regnandi, how be
it they be not the cause of Salvation. Here Rosse gives his judgment, that he
would have this Canon simply commanding good works, to be Preached, and no
mention made, what place they have, or have not in justification. Upon this
motion, so agreeable to Canterburies mind, the Canon is set down as it
stands, without the distinction of Via Regni, or causa Regnandi, or any word
sounding that way, urging only the necessity of good works. 7. By comparing
Canterbury 9. Cap. 18. As it was sent in writing from our Prelates, and as it
is Printed at Canterburies command, may be also manifest, that he went about to
establish Auricular confession, and Popish Absolution. 8. Our Prelates were not
acquainted with Canons for afflicting of Arbritrary penalties: But in
Canterburies Book wheresoever there is no penalty expressly set down, it is
provided that it shall be arbitrary, as the ordinary shall think fittest By
these and many other the like, it is apparent, that tyranicall power he went
about to establish in the hands, of our Prelates, over the worship, and the
souls and goods of men, overturning from the foundation, the whole order of
our Kirk, what seeds of Popery he did sow in our Kirk, and how large an entry
he did make for the grossest novations afterward, which has been a maine
cause of all their combustion.

The third and great novation was the Book of Common Prayer, Administration of
the Sacraments, and other parts of Divine service, brought in without warrant
from our Kirk, to be universally received, as the only form of divine
Service, under all highest pains both civil and Ecclesiastical; which is
found by our national assembly, besides the Popish freme, and forms in divine
worship, to contain many Popish errors, and ceremonies, and the seeds of
manifold and gross superstitions, and Idolatries, and to be repugnant to the
Doctrine, Discipline, and order of our reformation, to the confession of Faith,
constitutions of general Assemblies, and Acts of Parliament, establishing the
true Religion: that this also was Canterburies work we make manifest.

By the memories, and instruction sent unto him from our Prelates; wherein they
gave a special account of the diligence they had used, to do all which herein
they were enjoined, by the approbation of the Service Book sent to them; and
of all the marginall correction, wherein it varieth from the English Book,
showing their desire to have some few things changed in it, which
notwithstanding was not granted: This we find written by Saint Androis own
hand, and subscribed by him, and nine other of our Prelates.

By Canterburies own Letters, witnesses of his joy, when the Book was ready
for the Press, of his prayers that God would speed the work, of the hope to
see that service set up in Scotland, of his diligence to send for the Printer,
and directing him to prepare a black letter, and to send it to his servants at
Edinburgh, for Printing this book. Of his approbation of his proofs sent from
the Press. Of his fear of delay, in bringing the work speedily to an end,
for the great good, (not of that Church,) but of the Church. Of his encouraging
Rosse, who was entrusted with the Press, to go on in this piece of Service
without fear of Enemies, All which may be seen in the Autographs; and by
letters, sent from the Prelate of London, to Rosse, wherein as he rejoices at
the sight of the Scottish Canons; which although they should make some noise at
the beginning, yet they would be more for the good of the Kirk, than the
Canons of Edinburgh, for the good of the Kingdom. So concerning the Liturgy he
shows, that Rosse had sent to him, to have an explanation from Canterbury, of
some passage of the Service Book, and that the Press behoved to stand till
the explanation come to Edinburgh, which therefore he had in have, obtained
from his Grace, and sent the dispatch away by Canterburies own conueyance.

But the Book it self, as it stands interlined, margined, and patcht up, is
much more than all that is expressed in his Letters, and the changes and
supplements themselves, taken from the Mass Book, and other Romish Ritualls
by which he makes it to vary from the Book of England, and are pregnant
testimonies of his Popish spirit, and wicked intentions which he would have put
in execution upon us, then can be denied. The large declaration professes,
that all the variation of our Book, from the Book of England, that ever the
King understood, was in such things as the Scottish humor would better comply
with, than with that which stood in the English service. These Popish
innovasions therefore have been surreptitiously inserted by him without the
Kings knowledge, and against his purpose. Our Scottish Prelates do petition
that, something may be abated of the English ceremonies, as the Cross in
Baptism, the Ring in marriage, and some other things. But Canterbury will not
only have these kept, but a great many more, and worse superadded, which was
nothing else, but the adding of fuel to the fire. To express and discover
all, would require a whole book, we shall only touch some few in the matter of
the Communion.

This Book inverteth the order of the Communion in the Book of England, as
may be seen by the numbers, setting down the orders of this new Communion, 1.
5. 2. 6. 7. 3. 4. 8. 9. 10. 15. Of the diverse secret reasons of this change, we
mention one only; In joining the spiritual praise and thanksgiving, which is
in the Book of England, pertinently after the Communion, with the Prayer of
Consecration before the Communion, and that under the name of Memorial, or
Oblation, for no other end, but that the memorial and Sacrifice of Praise
mentioned in it, may be understood according to the Popish meaning. Bellar. de
Missa, lib. 2. cap. 21. Not of the spiritual sacrifice, but of the oblation of
the body of the Lord.

It seems to be no great matter, that without warrant of the Book of
England, the Presbyter going from the North-end of the Table, shall stand
during the time of consecration, at such a part of the Table, where he may with
the more ease and decency use both hands; yet being tried, it imports much,
as, that he must stand with his hinder parts to the People, representing (says
Durand) that which the Lord said of Moses, Thou shall see my hinder parts. He
must have the use of both his hands, not for any thing he has to do about the
Bread and Wine, for that may be done at the North end of the Table, and be
better seen of the people: but (as we are taught by the Rationalists) that he
may by stretching forth his Arms, to represent the extension of Christ on the
Cross, and that he may the more conveniently lift up the Bread and Wine above
his head, to be seen and adored of the people: who in the Rubricke of the
general confession, a little before, are directed to kneel humbly on their
knees, that the Priests elevation so magnified in the Mass, and the peoples
adoration may go together. That in this posture, speaking with a low voice,
and muttering (for sometimes he is commanded to speak with a loud voice, and
distinctly) he be not heard by the people, which is no less a mocking of God,
and his people, then if the words were spoken in an unknown language. As there
is no word of all this in the English Service; so does the Book in King
Edwards time give to every Presbyter his liberty of gesture, which yet gave
such offense to Bucer, (the censurer of the Book and even in Cassanders own
judgment, a man of great moderation in matters of this kind) that he calls
them, Nunquam satis execrandos Missa gestus, and would have them to be
abhorred, because they confirm to the simple and superstitious ter impiam and
exitialem Missae fiduciam.

The corporal presence of Christ's body in the Sacrament is also to be found
here: for the words of the Masse-booke serving to this purpose, which are
sharply censured by Bucer, in King Edwards Liturgy, and are not to be found in
the Book of England, are taken in here; Almighty God is in called, that of his
Almighty Goodness he may vouchsafe so to bless and sanctify with his Word
and Spirit, these gifts of Bread and Wine, that they may be unto us the body
and blood of Christ.

The change here is made a work of Gods Omnipotency: the words of the Mass,
ut fiant nobis, are translated in King Edwards Book, That they be unto us,
which are again turned into Latin by Alesius, Vt fiant nobis On the other
part, the expressions of the Book of England, at the delivery of the Elements
of feeding on Christ by faith, and of Eating and drinking in remembrance that
Christ dyed for thee, are utterly deleared. Many evidences there be in this
part of the Communion, of the bodily Presence of Christ, very agreeable to the
Doctrines taught by his Sectaries, which this paper cannot contain. They teach
us that Christ is received in the Sacrament, Corporaliter, both objective and
subjective, Corpus Christi est objectum quod recipitur, and corpus nostrum
subjectum quo recipitur.

The Book of England abolisheth all that may import the oblation of any
unbloody Sacrifice, but here we have besides the preparatory oblation of the
Elements, which is neither to be found in the Book of England now, nor in King
Edwards Book of old the oblation of the body and blood of Christ, which
Bellarmine calls, Sacrificium Laudis, quia Deus per illud magnopere laudatur.
This also agrees well with their late doctrine. We are ready when it shall be
judged convenient and we shall be desired, to discover much more matters of
this kind as grounds laid for missa sicca, or the half Mess, the private Mess
without the people of communicating in one kind, of the consumption by the
Priest, and consummation of the Sacrifice, of receiving the Sacrament in the
mouth, and not in the hand, etc.

Our supplications were many against these Books, but Canterbury procured them
to be answered with terrible Proclamations. We were constrained to use the
remedy of Protestation; but for our Protestations, and other lawful means,
which we used for our deliverance, Canterbury procured us to be declared
Rebels and Traitors, in all Parish Kirkes of England: when we were seeking to
possess our Religion in peace, against these devices, and novations Canterbury
kindles war against us. In all these it is known that he was, although not
the sole, yet the principal Agent and adviser.

When by the Pacification at Barwicke, both Kingdoms looked for Peace and
quietness, he spared not openly in the hearing of many, often before the
King, and privately at the Counsel Table, and the Privy Jointo, to speak of
us as Rebels and Traitors, and to speak against the Pacification as
dishonorable, and mere to be broken. Neither did his malignancy and
bitterness ever suffer him to rest, till a new war was entered upon, and all
things prepared for our destruction.

By him was it that our Covenant, approven by National Assemblies, subscribed
by His Majesty's Commissioner, and by the Lords of his Majesty's Counsel, and
by them commanded to be subscribed by all the Subjects of the Kingdom, as a
Testimony of our duty to God, and the King, by him was it still called ungodly,
damnable, Treasonable; by him were Oaths invented, and pressed upon diverse of
our poor Country men, upon the pain of imprisonment, and many miseries, which
were unwarrantable by Law, and contrary to their National Oath.

When our Commissioners did appear to render the reasons of our demands, he
spared not in the presence of the King, and Committee, to rail against our
National Assembly, as not daring to appear before the World, and Kirkes
abroad; where himself and his actions were able to endure trial; and against
our just and necessary defense, as the most malicious and Treasonable Contempt
of Monarchical Government that any bygone age heard of: His hand also was at
the Warrant for the restraint and imprisonment of Our Commissioners, sent from
the Parliament, warranted by the King, and seeking the peace of the Kingdoms.

When we had by our Declarations, Remonstrances, and Representations,
manifested the truth of our intentions, and lawfulness of our actions, to all
the good Subjects of the Kingdom of England, when the late Parliament could
not be moved to assist, or enter in War against us, maintaining our Religion,
and Liberties, Canterbury did not only advise the breaking up of that high and
honorable Court, to the great grief and hazard of the Kingdom, but (which is
without example) did sit still in the Convocation, and make Canons and
Constitutions against us, and our just and necessary defense; ordaining under
all highest pains, that hereafter the Clergy shall preach four times in the
year, such doctrine as is contrary not only to our proceedings, but to the
doctrine and proceedings of other Reformed Kirkes, to the judgment of all sound
Divines, and Politiques, and tending to the utter slavery and ruining of all
Estates and Kingdoms, and to the dishonor of Kings and Monarchs. And as if
this had not been sufficient, he procured, six Subsedies to be lifted of the
Clergy, under pair of deprivation to all that should refuse. And which is yet
worse, and above which Malice it self cannot ascend, by his means a Prayer is
framed, Printed, and sent through all Paroches of England, to be said in all
Churches in time of Divine Service, next after the Prayer for the Queen, and
Royal Progeny, against our Nation by name of traiterous Subjects, having cast
off all Obedience to Our Anointed Sovereign, and coming in all rebellious
manner to invade England, that shame may cover our faces, as Enemies to God and
the King.

Whosoever shall impartially examine what has proceeded from himself, in
these Books of Canons and common Prayer, what Doctrine has been published and
printed these years bypast in England, by his Disciples and Emissaries, what
gross Popery in the most material points we have found, and are ready to show
in the posthume writings of the Prelate at Edinburgh, and Dublane, his own
creatures, his nearest familiars, and most willing instruments to advance his
counsels, and projects, shall perceive, that his intentions were deep and
large against all the reformed Kirkes, and Reformation of Religion, which in
his Majesty's dominions was panting, and by this time had rendered up the Ghost,
if God had not in a wonderful way of mercy prevented us; And that if the Pope
himself had been in his place, he could not have been more Popish, nor could
he more zealously have negotiated for Rome, against the Reformed Kirkes, to
reduce them to the Heresies in doctrine; the Superstitions and Idolatty in
worship, and the tyranny in Government, which are in that See, and for which
the Reformed Kirkes did separate from it, and come forth of Babell. From him
certainly has issued all this deluge, which almost has overturned all. We are
therefore confident that your Lordships will by your means deal effectually
with the Parliament, that this great firebrand be presently removed from his
Majesty's presence, and that he may be put to trial, and put to his deserved
censure, according to the Laws of the Kingdom; which shall be good service to
God, honor to the King and Parliament, terror to the wicked, and comfort to
all good men, and to us in special who by his means principally, have been
put to so many and grievous aflictions, wherein we had perished, if God had not
been with us.

We do indeed confess that the Prelates of England have been of very
different humors, some of them of a more moderate temper, some of them more,
and some of them less inclinable to Popery: yet what known truth, and
constant experience has made undeniable, we must at this opportunity profess,
that from the first time of Reformation of the Kirk of Scotland, not only
after the coming of King James of happy memory into England, but before, the
Prelates of England have bin by all means uncessantly working the overthrow of
our discipline and Government. And it has come to pass of late, that the
Prelates of England having prevailed, and brought us to subjection in the point
of Government, and finding their long waited for opportunity and a rare
congruitie of many spirits and powers, ready to cooperate for their ends, have
made a strong assault upon the whole external worship, and doctrine of our
Kirk. By which their doing they did not aim to make us conform to England,
but to make Scotland first (whose weakness in resisting they had before
experienced, in the Novations of Government, and of some points of worship) and
thereafter England conform to Rome, even in these matters, wherein England had
separated from Rome, ever since the time of Reformatior. An evil therefore
which has issued, not so much from the personal disposition of the Prelates
themselves, as from the innate quality and nature of their Office, and
Prelaticall Hierarchy, which did bring forth the Pope in Ancient times, and
never cease till it brings forth popish Doctrine and worship, where it is
once rooted, and the Principles thereof somented and constantly followed. And
from that antipathy and inconsistency, of the two forms of Ecclesiastical
Government, which they conceived, and not without cause, that one Island united
also under one head, and Monarch, was not able to bear: the one being the same
in all the parts and powers, which it was in times of Popery, and now is in the
Roman Church: The other being the form of Government, received, maintained and
practiced by all the Reformed Kirks wherein by their own testimonies, and
confessions, the Kirks of Scotland had amongst them no small eminency. This
also we represent to Your Lordships most serious consideration, that not only
the firebrarnds may be removed, but that the fire may be provided against, that
there be no more combustion after this.

This charge of the Scots against the Archbishop was usherd in with this
Introduction, in the Scottish Treaty, which clearly manifests him to be
excepted by name out of the Act of Pacification, and Oblivion; by the fourth
clause thereof.

An Introduction to the accusation against Canterbury, and the Leiutenant. of
IRELAND.
SEeing His Majesty has been Graciously pleased concerning out fourth demand
to declare, that all his subjects shall be liable to the trial and sentence of
the Parhament respective; And seeing the Incendiaries are of two sorts, either
of the English or Scottish Nation, to be tried here or there, of the Scottish
we shall speak afterward, And for the present we shall deliver to your
Lordships, the grounds of our complaint against the Prelate of Canterbury, and
the Leiutenant of Ireland, whom the Kingdom of Scotland have conceived and
expressed to have been prime Incendiaries, that they may be fully presented to
your Lordshipps, to the Kings Majesty and to the Parliament, without prejudice
always unto us to add hereafter what we shall find necessary. And although
we do not presently verefie every point therein, yet our present proofs of some
principal points and our probable presumptions of the rest, which are annexed
therewith, are sufficient ground, cum constat de incendio, to one Nation, to
desire another to put them, per viam transitionis, to a trial, and to examine
all the Counselors, and others here, who may be conceived to have been eye or
ear witnesses, of any of the Counsels, speeches or Actions liable to the
Charge, and for saving unnecessarie charges and travel to the subjects to
direct Commissions and all other Warrants, requisite to such as his Majesty and
the Parliament shall think fit, for examining all such persons, as may be
apprehended to have knowledge of any of these Counsels, Speeches or Actions,
which are alleged to have been in Ireland, and that upon such
Interrogatories as we shall give unto the Parliament, and shall be pleased to
add for trial. All which we earnestly crave of his Majesty, and the
Parliament, as we desire that his Majesty may be pleased to send Warrant to the
Committee of at Esr: like, or to the Sheriffs of Shires for examining witness
anent the oath pressed upon any of our Country men, and other wrongs contained
in the complaint if they be not sufficiently proved here. 14. December. 1640.

After these Original Articles exhibited against the Archbishop, both by the
Scottish Commissioners and House of Commons to the House of Peers, the
Archbishop delaying to plead unto them; and the Parliament being taken up with
many emergent weighty affairs for their own and the Kingdoms necessary
preservation, by reason of the unnatural bloody Rebellion in Ireland, and
Wars in England so reploted, and raised by the popish party, the proceedings
against him were respited near two years space: And then the Commons
intending to bring him to a speedy trial, exhibited these ensuing. Additionall
Articles against him, not much different from the Original, except in some
particulars.

Further Articles of Impeachment by the Commons assembled in Parliament against
William Laud Archbishop of CANTERBVRY, of high Treason and diverse high Crimes
and Misdemeanors, as follows.
1. THat the said Archbishop of Canterbury, to introduce an Arbitrary
Government within this Realm, and to destroy Parliaments, in the third and
fourth years of his Majesty's reign that now is, a Parliament being then
called, and sitting at Westminster, traitorously and maliciously caused the
said Parliament to be dissolved, to the great grievance of his Majesty's
subjects, and prejudice of this Commonwealth: And soon after the dissolution
thereof, gave diverse Propositions under his hand, to George then Duke of
Buckingham, casting therein many false aspersions upon the said Parliament,
calling it a factious Parliament, and falsely affirming, that it had cast many
scandalls upon his Majesty, and had used him like a child in his minority,
stiling them Puritans, and commending the Papists for harmless and peaceable
subjects.

2. That within the space of ten years last past, the said Archbishop has
treacherously endeavored to subvert the fundamental Laws of this Realm; and
to that end has in like manner endeavored, to advance the power of the
Council Table, the Canons of the Church, and the Kings Prerogative, above the
Laws and Statutes of the Realm. And for manifestation thereof, about six
years last past, being then a Privy Councellor to his Majesty, and sitting at
the Council Table, he said, that as long as he sat there, they should know,
that an Order of that Board should be of equal force with a law or Act of
Parliament. And at another time used these words, That he hoped ere long that
the Canons of the Church, and the Kings Prerogative should be of as great power
as an Act of Parliament. And at another time said, that those that would not
yield to the Kings power, he would crush them to pieces.

3. That the said Archbishop, to advance the Canons of the Church, and power
Ecclesiastical above the law of the Land, and to pervert and hinder the course
of Justice, has at diverse times within the said time, by his letters, and
other undue means and solicitations, used to Judges, opposed and stopped the
granting of his Majesty's Writs of Prohibition, where the same ought to have
been granted, for stay of proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Court, whereby
justice has been delayed and hindered, and the Judges diverted from doing
their duties.

4. That for the end and purpose aforesaid, about seven years last past, a
Judgment being given in his Majesty's Court of Kings Bench against one Burley a
Person, being a man of bad life and conversation, in an Information upon the
Statute of 21. Hen. 8. for wilful Non-residency the said Archbishop by
solicitations and other undue means used to the Judges of that Court, caused
Execution upon the satd Judgment to be stayed: and being moved therein, and
made acquainted with the bad life and conversation of the said Person, he said,
that he had spoken to the Judges for him, and that he would never suffer a
Judgment to pass against any Clergyman by nihil dicit.

5. That the said Archbishop, about eight years last past, being then also a
privy Councellor to his Majesty, for the end and purpose aforesaid, caused Sir
John Corbet of Stoak in the County of Salop Baronet, then a Justice of peace of
the said County, to be committed to the Prison of the Fleet, where he continued
Prisoner for the space of half a year, or more for no other cause, but for
calling for the Petition of Right, and causing it to be read at the Sessions of
the peace for that County, upon a just and necessary occasion. And during the
time of his said imprisonment the said Archbishop, without any color of right,
by a writing under the Seal of his Archbishopricke, granted a way parcel of
the Glebe land of the Church of Adderly in the said County, whereof the said
Sir John Corbet was then patron, unto Robert Vscount Kilmurrey, without the
consent of the said Sir John, or then the incumbent of the said Church, which
said Viscount Kilmurrey built a Chapel upon the said parcel of Glebe land, to
the great prejudice of the said Sir John Corbet, which has caused great suits
and dissentions between them. And whereas the said Sir John Corbet had a
judgment against Sir James Stonehouse Knight, in an action of Waste, in his
Majesty's Court of Common Pleas at Westminster, which was afterward affirmed
in a writ of Error in the Kings Bench, and Execution thereupon awarded: yet the
said Sir John, by means of the said Archbishop could not have the effect
thereof, but was committed to Prison by the said Archbishop and others at the
Council Table, until he had submitted himself unto the order of the said
Table, whereby he lost the benefit of the said Judgment and Execution.

6. That whereas diverse gifts and dispositions of diverse sums of money were
heretofore made by diverse charitable and well disposed persons, for the buying
in of diverse Impropriations for the maintenance of preaching the word of God in
several Churches, the said Archbishop about eight years last past, wilfully
and maliciously caused the said gifts, feoffements and conveyances made to the
uses aforefaid, to be overthrown in his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, contrary
to Law, as things dangerous to the Church and State, under the specious
pretense of buying in Appropriations: whereby that pious work was suppressed
and trodden down, to the great dishonor of God, and scandal of Religion.

7. That the said Archbishop at several times, within these ten years last
past, at Westminster and else where within this Realm, contrary to the known
Laws of this Land, has endeavored to advance Popery and Superstition within
the Realm: And for that end and purpose has wittingly and willingly received,
harbored and relieved diverse popish Priests and Jesuits, namely one called
Sancta Clara, alias Damport, a dangerous Person, and Franciscan Friar, who
having written a Popish and seditious Book, entitled Deus natura gratia,
wherein the thirty nine Articles of the Church of England, established by Act
of Parliament, were much traduced and scandalized: The said Archbishop had
diverse conferences with him, while he was in writing the said Book; and did
also provide maintenance and entertainment for one Mounsieur St. Giles a Popish
Priest at Oxford, knowing him to be a Popish Priest.

8. That the said Archbishop, about four years last past, ut Westminster
aforesaid said that there must be a blow given to the Church, such as has not
been yet given, before it could be brought to conformity; declaring thereby
his intention to be, to shake and alter the true Protestant Religion
established in the Church of England.

9. That in, or about the month of May, 1641. presently after the dissolution
of the last Parliament, the said Archbishop for the ends and purposes
aforesaid, caused a Synod or Convocation of the Clergy, to be held for the
several Provinces of Canterbury and York; wherein were made and established
by his means and procurement, diverse Canons and Constitutions
Ecclesiastical; contrary to the Laws of this Realm, the Rights and
Privileges of Parliament, the Liberty and propriety of the Subject, tending
also to seditior, and of dangerous consequence: And amongst other things, the
said Archbishop caused a most dangerous and illegal Oath to be therein made
and contrived, the tenor whereof follows in these words. That I A. B. do
swear that I do approve the Doctrine and Discipline or Government established
in the Church of England, as containing all things necessary to salvation; And
that I will not endeavor by my self or any other, directly or indirectly to
bring in any Popish Doctrine, contrary to that which is so established: Nor
will I ever give my consent to alter the Government of this Church by
Archbishops, Bishops, Deanes, and Archdeacons, etc. as it stands now
established, and as by right it ought to stand: Nor yet ever to subject it to
the usurpations and superstitions of the Sea of Rome. And all these things I
do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear, according to the plain and
common sense, and understanding of the same words, without any equivocation, or
mental evasion, or secret reservation whatsoever. And this I do heartily,
willing and truly, upon the says of a Christian: So help me God in Jesus
Christ. Which Oath the said Archbishop himself did take, and caused diverse
other Ministers of the Church to take the same, upon pain of suspension and
deprivation of their livings, and other severe penalties: And did also cause
Godfrey, then Bishop of Gloucester, to be committed to prison for refusing to
subscribe to the said Canons, and to take the said Oath: and afterward, the
said Bishop submitting himself to take the said Oath, he was set at liberty.

10. That a little before the calling of the last Parliament, Anro 1640. a Vote
being then passed, and a resolution taken at the Council Table, by the advice
of the said Archbishop, for assisting of the King in extraordinary ways, if
the said Parliament should prove peevish, and refuse to supply His Majesty:
the said Archbishop wickedly and maliciously advised His Majesty to dissolve
the said Parliament, and accordingly the same was dissolved: And presently
after, the said Archbishop told his Majesty, that now he was absolved from all
rules of Government, and left free to use extraordinary ways for his supply.

For all which matters and things the said Commons assembled in Parliament, in
the name of themselves, and of all the Commons of England do impeach the said
Archbishop of Canterbury of high Treason, and other crimes and misdemeanors
tending to the subversion of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and to the
utter ruin of this Church and Commonwealth.

And the said Commons, by Protestation saving to themselves the liberty of
exhibiting at any time hereafter, any further, or other accusation or
impeachment against the said Will. Laud Archbishop of Canterbury, and also of
replying to the answer that he shall make unto the said Articles, or any of
them: Or offering proof of the premises, or any other impeachments or
accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the cause shall (according to
the course of Parliaments) require; do pray that he, the said Will. Laud
Archbishop of Canterbury, may be called to answer the said several crimes and
misdemeanors, and receive such condign punishment as the same shall deserve:
and that such further proceedings may be upon every of them had, and used
against him as is agreeable to Law and Justice.

These additionall Articles were sent up from the Commons to the Lords House by
Master Sergeant Wild the 23. of October. 1643. Whereupon the Lords made this
ensuing Order.

Die Luna 23. October. 1643.
ORdered, etc. That the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury shall put in his Answer
in writing into this House by the thirtieth day of this instant October, unto

16. January 1643.
A Message from the Lords by Sir Robert Rich, and Mr. Page, to acquaint the
House, that they are ready to hear the Charge upon the impeachment against the
Bishop of Canterbury.

Upon this Message the Committee of the House of Commons appointed to manage
the evidence against him, went up to the Lords House, and then the Archbishop
being brought to the Bar, after he had there kneeled a little space, was
commanded to stand up: which ceremony ended, Mr, Maynard, one of the Committee,
desired the Lords: that the original and additional Articles of impeachment
against the Archbishop might be read: Which being read accordingly by the
Clerk, he then prayed, that the Archbishops several Answers, to these Articles
might likewise be read; whereupon the Speaker of the Lords House commanding
them to be read, the Clerk read only his forementioned Answer to the
Additionall Articles, but noe answer at all to the Original, there being never
any Answer put in unto them; the Archbishop having not in all the time of his
restraint from the 26. of Feb. 1640. till that hour, so much as tendered or
put in any Answer to his Original Articles (which was his own mere default)
and never so much as once Petitioned in all that space to be brought to his
Trial, notwithstanding his frequent complaints of his long Imprisonment, and
the delay of his hearing, occasioned by his own neglect, and by his
Petitioning for longer time when the Commons hastened his Trial.

Hereupon Mr. Maynard spoke to the Lords to this effect.

My Lords, it new appears to your Lordships, how unwilling the Archbishop is
(out of a consciousnesse of his own guilt) to come to his Trial, that in all
this space from his first impeachment, he has not so much as put in any Answer
to the Original Articles, though he had long since Council assigned him for
that purpose: My Lords, this is none of the Commons fault, but his own; for
your Lordships well know, that the Commons can take no notice what is done in
the House of Peers in a Parliamentary way, but by a Messag from your
Lordships, who after our Articls exhibited, were to call upon the Archbishop for
an answer to them; and your Lordships sending us several Messages heretofore
that the Archbishop had put in his Answer to the Articls, and that you were
ready to hear our Charge against him, and appointing this day for his Trial,
the Commons thereupon conceived that he had formerly put in his Plea and
answer, in due form to all (...) Articles, but the contrary now appearing both
to your Lordships and as it is impossible for us to proceed at this time in his
trial, there being no issue Joined upon the Original Articles for want of an
answer to them and to (...) upon the Additionalls before my answer given, to
the originalls will be very preposterous^ therefore ^e humbly prey your
Lordships to Order, that the Archbishop may forthwith put in his Answer ^^th to
the Original, and Additionall Articles by the advice of his Council, or
otherwise, in such sort as he will stand to it; and then he shall without any
delay join (...) with him, proceed on in his Trial, and evidence against him
when your Lordships shall appoint.

The Archbishop having little to reply hereunto, desire the Lords, that he
might advise with his Council, whether the Articles were certain and
particular enough to be answered unto; and that if their Lordships should
overruled him to put in his Answer to them, he might have convenient time to do
it.

Upon this all being commanded to withdraw, the Lords after some short debate
among themselves, and upon reading the Archbishops Petition to have Mr. Gor^^rd
of Grayes-Inne assigned for his Council, to join with those formerly assigned
him, made this ensuing Order.

Die Martis 16. Ian. 1643.
Upon the reading the Petition of William Archbishop of Cant. It is this day
Ordered by the Lords in Parliament, that Mr. Richard Gerrard of Grayes-Inne, be
added to the former Council Assigned to the said Archbishop, to be likewise of
his Council.

Cant. shall put in his Answer in writing into this House, to the first and
further Articles of Impeachment brought up from the House of Commons against
him by Monday morning next peremptorily, and that the same Council formerly
Assigned him shall be of Council with him.

On the 19. of January, the Archbishop sent this Petition to the Lords.

To the Right Honorable the Lords assembled in PARLIAMENT.
The humble Petition of William, Archbishop of Cant; Prisoner in the T^wer.
Shows,
THat whereas your Petitioner having formerly answered the particular Articles
exhibited against him by the Honorable House of Commons, and now by your
Lordships Order of the 16th. of this instant is commanded to put in his Answer
to the first and further Articles of Impeachment brought up against him by
Monday morning next, for doing whereof his former Council is assigned him.

That your Petitioner having advised with his Council concerning the first
Articles, which were exhibited new almost three years sithence, finding upon
perusal and debate of the same that the said former Articles are such, that no
answer can be made thereunto, nor your Petitioner in my wise enabled to prepare
for his defense to the same, as they now stand.

That for as much as the said Articles of Impeachment import no less than a
Charge of High treason, and for as much as your Petitioner is by his Council
(...) that especially in Cases of life, the Defendant is allowed to offer to
the Court where the same depends his exceptions by his Council before any Plea
pleaded.

Your Petitioner most humbly beseeches your Lordships, to appoint a day for
the hearing of your Petitioners Council concerning the same

And your Petitioner shall pray, etc. VV. CANT.

The humble Answer of William Archbishop of Cant. to the first and farther

conceived to arise upon the coming of any English Army against Scotland, or
the coming of the Scottish Army into England or upon any Action, attempt,
assistance, Council or devise having relation thereunto, and falling out by
the occasion of the late troubles proceeding the late Conclusion of the Treaty,
and return of the Scottish Army into Scotland, this Defendant says, that it
is enacted by an Act made during the sitting of this present Parliament, that
the same, and whatsoever has ensued thereupon, whether treuching upon the
Laws, and Liberties of the Church and Kingdom, or upon his Majesty's Honor
and Authority, in no time hereafter may be called in Question, or resented as a
wrong, National or Personal, and that no mention be made thereof in time
coming, neither in Judgment nor out of Judgment, but that it be held and
reputed as though never such things had been thought or wrought, as by the
said Act may more at large appear, with this that this Defendant does aver,
that he is none of the persons excepted by the said Act; or the said offenses
charged upon this Defendant any of the offenses excepted by the said Act.

And as to all the rest of the said first and further Articles, this Defendant,
saving to himself all advantages of exception to the said Articles, humbly
says, he is not Guilty of all or any the matters by the said Articles charged,
in such manner and form us the same are by the said Articles charged against
him.

VV. Cant.

The same day I find this entry in the Commons Iournall; to wit, on the 22.
Jan. 1643.

The Lords by Sir Robert Rich and Mr. Page, sent down the Answer of William
Archbishop of Cant. to the first and further Articles of impeachment brought up
by this House against him, which was read and ordered to be referred to the
Commitmittee appointed to manage the evidence against the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and accordingly delivered to Sergeant Wild.

After this the House of Commons to expedite his Trial on the 22. February
1643.

ORdered, that the Committee appointed to manage the evidence at the Trial of
the Archbishop of Canterbury, do peremptorily meet this afternoon, at three
of the Clock in the Court of Wards, upon the distribution of the parts of the
evidence.

The Commons and Lords being all ready for his Trial, and having given him as
much convenient time to prepare himself and his witnesses as he could desire,
to prevent all clamours of the Prelaticall and Canterburian party, began now to
think of a peremptory day for his Trial; and thereupon I find this Order
entered in the Commons Journall.

4. Marcii 1643.
A Message to be sent to the Lords, to desire them to appoint a day for the
Trial of the Bishop of Canterbury: Master Sergeant Wild, went up to the Lords
to appoint a day for the Trial of the Archbishop of Canterbury: Sergeant
Wild brings answer, that the Lords have appointed to morrow senight for the
trial of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

For which purpose the Lords made this following Order.

Die Lunae 4. Marcii 1644.
Ordered, that the Archbishop of Canterbury shall appear before their
Lordships on Tuesday the 12th of this instant March at nine of the Clock in the
morning, At which time this House will proceed against the Archbishop, upon
the first and further Articles of Impeachment brought up from the house of
Commons against him, for high Treason, and high Crimes and misdemeanors;
whereof the said Archbishop is hereby to take notice and provide himself
accordingly.

After this the Archbishop Petitioning the Commons House, that Sir Henry
Midmay a Member thereof might be examined as a witness for him at his trial,
this Order was thereupon conceived.

9. Marcii 1644.
The humble Petition of William Archbishop of Canterbury, desiring that Sir
Henry Mildmay may be examined as a witness, in his business, he being to come
to his trial on Tuesday next, was this day read, And it is Ordered according to
his Petition, that he shall be examined as a witness at the trial of the said
Bishop accordingly. It was likewise then ordered that diverse Members of the
House of Commons shall be examined as witnesses against him, And that the Lords
be moved by Sergeant Wild, that some Members and Attendants of the Lords House
be examined at the Archbishops Trial. And that it be referred to the
Committee of Sequestrations, to consider of some convenient recompense, for
such Clerks, Sollicitors and others as have been or shall be employed in the
transscribing of breviats and other services done by them to the Committee for
the Bishop of Canterbury his trial.

On the 12. of March his Trial, according to the former Order, was entered
upon, of which I shall give you this summary account.

Never was there in any age such a deliberate, solemn, patient, impartial
hearing of any case in the High Court of Parliament (nor in any Court of
Justice else in our own or any other Kingdom whatsoever) as there was of this
Archbishops; The first day of his Trial began the twelfth of March, 1643.
wherein the whole time was spent in reading the Articles of Impeachment, his
answers to them, and introductory Speeches to the charge and evidence against
him, made by Sergeant Wild, and the Archbishop himself: The first part of
the evidence upon the 1, 2, 3, 4. Original, and 2, 3, 4, 10. Additionall
Articles, was managed by John Maynard Esquire, one of the Commons House,
wherein four whole days (namely March 13. 16. 18. Anno 1643. and March 28.
1644.) were spent; the forenoons of them in the evidence and proofs, the
after-noons in the Archbishops Answers, and Master Maynards replies unto them.
The second part of the evidence, was prosecuted by Robert Nicholas Esquire, a
Member of the House of Commons; which took up three whole days, viz. April
16. and May 4. 16. morning and evening in proof of the fifth and sixth
Original, and ninth Additionall Articles; and in the Answers and replies upon
them. The third part touching Religion, (contained in the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
Original, and 6, and 7, Additionall Articles) was carried on and managed by
John Wild Sergeant at Law, of the Commons House, for 4 whole days, (to wit,
May 20, 27. June 6. 11.) and then by reason of Mr. Sergeants sickness and
infirmity, pursued by Master Nicholas 5 entire days more, (viz. June 17. 20,
27. July 20, 24.) The fourth and last part of the evidence, (in proof of the 14
Original and 1 and 10 Additionall Articles) was given in by Master Nicholas,
on the 29 of July, and concluded the same day. So as the very evidence it self
(which was excellently well pressed by these learned Gentlemen) took up
seventeen whole days, morning and evening: besides 12 days attendance more,
whereon other pressing public affairs enforced the Lords to adjorn the
trial, when both the Committee of Commons were ready with their witnesses, and
the Archbishop present with his Council, ready to receive his charge.

After all the evidence answers and replies thereto fully given, the
Archbishop had liberty granted to make a Recapitulation of his whole defense
before the Lords, which accordingly performed on the second of September 1644.
To which Samuel Brown Esquire, a member of the House of Commons, replied, on
the 11 of September, summing up the principal parts of the evidence given
against him at the Lords Bar. On the 11 of October. 1644. the Archbishops
Council were heard at the Lords Bar, on this point of Law, to which they were
formerly directed to speak; Whether in all or any of the Articles charged
against him, there were any Treason contained? Which Mr. John Hern only argued
as the mouth of the rest of his Council. Soon after the Commons having drawn
an Ordnance of Attainder of high Treason against the Archbishop, upon the
Evidence given in against him: on the second of November. following the
Archbishop (after its second reading) was brought to the Commons Bar, where
Mr. Sam. Brown in his presence summed up the evidence given in against him
before the Lords: to which the Archbishop by order gave his answer Viva voce at
the Commons Bar, Nov. 11th: whereunto Mr Brown replied, the 13th. of the same
November. after which the very same day the Ordinance for his attainder of High
Treason passed the Commons House, without any dissenting voice but one, and
that not upon the matter of his charge High Treason, of which all Voted him
guilty, but manner of proceeding only. This Ordinance being transmitted to the
House of Peers, because some of the Lords were not present at all the evidence
given in against him during his long Trial, thereupon December. 4. 1644. they
Ordered, That all Books, Writings, Docquets, and evidences concerning the
Archbishop of Canterbury his trial before the Lords in Parliament, should be
brought in to the Clerk of the Parliament by 9 of the Clock in the morning, on
Saturday next: which being done accordingly, the Lords among themselves,
seriously re-examined all the heads and principal parts of the evidence
formerly urged against him at the Bar, debating, weighing, and then voting each
particular as they went; after this most serious review, their Lordships upon
most mature deliberation voted him guilty of all the Articles and matters of
fact charged against him, and also that of High Treason to (notwithstanding the
argument of the Archbishops Council) upon a conference with the House of
Commons, which satisfied them in the point of Law. Whereupon they passed the
Ordinance for his Attainder of high Treason; by virtue whereof he was soon
after executed, whereof more fully in its due place. Thus you have the sum of
the Lords and Commons most deliberate, fair, moderate just, (though tedious)
proceedings against this Arch-Traytor, (not to be presidented in any preceding
Age, nor fit to be imitated for the future in regard of length and expense of
time) against which calumny and malice it self can take no just exceptions on
his behalf; the rather, because himself would have tried, condemned, executed
above an hundred Paritans in half the time wherein he was but trying, without
the least mercy or moderation, had they been brought before his Tribunal, for
far more petty Treasons then those of which he was attainted and voted
guilty, upon most full and pregnant evidence. Having given the world this
brief account of the fairenes and deliberatenesse of his Trial so long
delayed, partly by his own neglect in not pleading to his Articles of
impeachment, and not once petitioning to be brought to Trial during all the
time of his restrain; partly by his own forementioned Petitions to the Lords
for longer time, when the Commons pressed to expedite his hearing; partly by
the death of Mr John Pym, and some other Members of the Commons House, who were
trusted to prepare and manage the evidence against him, part whereof
miscarryed by their decease; but principally by reason of the great intervening
urgent affairs, distractions, and bloody Wars in the Kingdoms of Ireland and
England, occasioned by his Majesty's deserting the Parliament, and this
Arch-Prelates plots to set up Popery; not through any neglect or default in the
Lords or Commons: We shall next endeavor to yield you a full, satisfactory,
true account of the proceedings and evidence given in against him at his
Trial, which will really render him the Archest Traitor, the most pestilent
Malefactor in all kinds of Villainy, Tyranny, Oppression, Mischief, that was
ever arraigned, condemned in any Parliament; Pierce Gravestons, Archbishop
Arundles, Cardinal Wolses, Empsons, Dudlies, and the Earl of Straffords
Treasons, Conspiracies, Oppressions and grand Misdemeanors, laid together,
being far inferior to his, both in he inousnesse, multiplicity, and variety,
as shall be undeniably demonstrated to all the world, by substantial proofs.

On Thursday the 12. of March, 1643. (the day designed for the comencement of
this great Trial) about three of the Clock in the afternoon, the Archbishop
was brought Prisoner by the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, and Usher of the
black Rod, to the Bar in the Lords House: where, after he had kneeled down on
his knees for a little space, the Lord Gray of Warke, then Speaker of that
honorable House, commanded him to rise up; which done, the Committee of the
House of Commons appointed to manage the evidence at his Trial demanded, that
the several Articles of their Impeachment against him might be read: whereupon
one of the Clerks of the Lords House, read both the Original and Additionall
Articles forementioned; and after that his Answer, Plea, and Demurrer to them.

All which being read, the Archbishop then desired the Lords, that the House of
Commons might give in all their Charge and Evidence to all the Articles against
him together, before he should be put to give his Answer to any particular
Charge, because he was ancient, his memory very short, and the Articles
General; and that he might answer all his Charge together, not each days
Evidence by Peece-meale.

To which Master Maynard, in the behalf of the Commons, answered: 1. That if
the Archbishops memory were so bad as he pretended, it would be far worse for
him to charge it with answering many particulars and the whole evidence against
him together, then to answer every particular Charge each day, as it should be
given in against him whiles it was fresh in memory. 2ly. That it might and
would be a great inconvenience to have witnesses crosse-examined, upon other
days then those, whereon they gave in their testimony against the Prisoner.
3ly. That the Lords themselves would find it difficult to pass their
judgments upon all the Charge together without hearing his punctual answer to
every particular proof as it should be given in evidence, whiles it was fresh
in their memories. 4ly. Because else all the witnesses, which were very many,
must of necessity attend, and be kept in Town from the first to the last day of
his Trial; which would be a very great Charge and inconvenience. 5ly. In the
Earl of Straffords case, this very Parliament, he was put to answer every day,
to the particular Evidence given against him on the same day; Upon which reasons
the House of Peers ordered, that the Archbishop should make his particular
Answer to every particular Charge on the same day it was given in against him.

Then the Archbishop desired, that the House of Commons would sever the
Articles which were Treason, from those other Articles which were matters of
crime, and Misdemeanour only, but not Treason; that so he might know which of
them were Treason and which not.

To which Master Maynard answered, That this they might not do, because they
were now only to try the matters of fact, not Law, and because all the
Articles taken together, not each or any particular Article by it self made up
the Treason, wherewith he was charged; to wit, his endeavors to subvert and
destroy Religion, the fundamental Laws of the Land and government of the
Realm, and to bring in Popery, and an arbitrary tyrannical Government against
Law.

After which Master Sergeant Wild (by way of Introduction to the Archbishops
charge) with abundance of elegancy and zeal, related the Heads of his Offenses
to the House of Peers in these ensuing strains.

My LORDS;
THis great cause of the Archbishop of Canterbury, after a long and painful
tra^aise, is now come to the Birth: of which it may be truly said, as it was in
a like case: R^pertum est hodierno die facinus, quod nec Poeta fingere, nec
Histrio sonare, nec Mimus imitare potuerit.

For if all the oppressions, all the pernicious practices and machinations,
which have been in each time to ruinate our Religion, Laws and Liberties were
lost; I think here they might be found and drawn out again to the life. So
that your Lordships who have been the great Assertors of our Liberties, and
stood so fast to the rules and principles of your Noble Progenitors (which
others have ignobly deserted) may after a long conflict with so many great and
marchiesse difficulties, say now as a great Commander once did upon an
extraordinary danger, Tandem par animo meo periculum video. Here is a cause
proportionable to your selves, apt and proper for the justice and power of this
honorable Court.

Had they been faults of common frailty, error or incogitancy, which this man
has committed, we should gladly have stepped back, and cast a Cloak over
them; but being so wilful, so universal, so distructive to the Laws of God
and man, so comprehensive of all the evils and miseries which now we suffer;
the sin would lie upon our own heads, if we should not call for justice:
which that it has been so long uncalled for, (not deferred or delayed) I
suppose no man will think strange who considers the present distractions, the
death and dispersion of our witnesses, the loss of some of our Members who
have been employed and taken pains in this business; the multitude of
diversions which we have had, and have daily occasioned by the Acts and
influences of this Meteor.

But the truth survives, and matter enough survives, so copious and so full of
variety, that if all the particulars should be examined, for his three years
imprisonment which he complains off there would be three years time of trial
and hearing of the heavy charge that lies against him. A charge of High
Treason: Treason in all and every part: Treason in the highest pitch and
altitude: for what greater Treason can there be then to betray the whole
Realm, and to subvert the very foundations, leaving nothing for posterity, but
a curse upon him that shall go about to build again?

That which of it self is so heinous, is much more enhanced and aggravated by
the quality of the person: A Churchman; a great Prelate; a man in great trust,
place and Authority in Church and Commonwealth.

A man endued with so great gifts of nature, and so many of grace and favor
from His Majesty, and for all these to be perverted to a contrary end, even to
the destruction of the public, and the ruin of the Womb that bare him, how
deep a dye, do these impose upon this foul crime?

How Churchmen in all ages (as has been often observed) should come to be:
the Archest Seedsmen of mischief, and principal Actors in all the great
distractions and alterations that have happened, is a destiny that may seem
strange. But the reason is, (ex bono Thealogo, malus Medicus) their
intermedling with temporal things, and matters hererogeneall to their calling;
wherein God is pleased to finite them with blindness, and to infatuate their
Council; whereof a perfect pattern we have in this great Prelate; who by
abusing his profession, and making the business of State the customary subject
of all his endeavors, became the Author of all the illegal and Tyrannical
proceedings in the Star Chamber, High Commission Court, and other Courts; of
all the Innovations in Doctrine and Discipline, of the suppressing of godly
Ministers and preaching; of the advancing of others who were the promoters of
Popery and Arbitrary power, and indeed of all the concussions and distractions
in Church and State, whereby Religion has been jus^ed out, Laws and
Parliaments trodden down with contempt.

For matter of Religion, surely those times were happy when by the magnanimity
of Princes, and the wisdom and piety of our Predecessors, that Antichristian
Yoke of Popery was shaken off.

And now after so many bloody Massacres in France, such fiery persecutions here
in Queen Mary's days, so many treacherous conspiracies in time of Queen
Elizabeth, that execrable and horrid Powder Plot in the late time of King
James, such streams and Rivers of blood in Germany and Ireland, and other
parts of the Christian world ever since, by those restless and cruel
firebrarnds of all mischief, for any man now to go about to rebuild these
walls of Jericho, and to reduce us to those rotten principells of Error and
Darkness, how can it be expected better, then that the people should be even
ready to stone him, as they did him that did but Act the part of Bellerophon in
Rome? But to avoyde this danger, he conveyes in this poison in a gilded Pill,
with baits and pretenses of Reconciliation; a pleasing snare, Laqueus Diaboli
ad miserorum animas ad infernum detrudendas.

A beade Roll of particulars might be recited, wherein this Reconcilement was
to be wrought in points of Free Will, Merits, Justification, Universal grace,
Purgatory, and in effect, all the rest.

To draw on these, there must be an introducing of Popish Ceremonies in all the
particulars contained in the Masse-Bookes, and Pontificalls themselves: and to
make way for these, the Book of Sports must be published and pressed beyond
the Kings intention or Declaration, which was but a civil Command: but he
subjoynes Ecclesiastical penalties, even the sharpest; suspention, deprivation
and the like, these executed on diverse good and godly men with a high hand;
Thus a liberty proclaimed not to Captives, but to profane Caitifes; this day
set a part by God, ab eterno, exposed and prostituted to all looseness and
irreligion, and that by a Law: This Lamb taken out of his bosom.

Iehosaphat sends Priests and Levites into all the Cities and Tribes to
instruct them; This Prelate sends Declarations and Injunctions to corrupt them,
and to extinguish the Lamp and light of Religion: in the former Acts he
destroys the Protestant, in this Religion it self: In the one, he leaves
Superstition; in the other, nothing but Atheism, and Profaneness: in the one
he destroys Presbyteros, as did Dioclesian, in the other Presbyterium, as did
the Apostate Julian; Yet to show his love to Religion, (the Popes only.) he
holds correspondency with those of Rome, Cardinal Barbarino, Panzani, Con,
Rosetti, the Popes Nuntioes, Sir Toby Mathewes, Saint Clara, Saint Gyles, the
most dangerous and desperate Jesuits, and many others ejusdem farina. And by
all these steps and rounds he makes a Ladder for himself to clime up to the
Papal dignity, in example of Anselme, whom (though famous, for his Contumacy
and Rebellion) yet he calls him, His worthy Predecessor, (as was Becket also,)
and is contented to take upon him the Plenitude of power, the title of
holiness, of Arch-Angell of this Church, the lineall Successor of Gregory the
first (rather of Gregory the seventh;) and for all this was well worthy to have
those two great offers made him, recorded in his own Memorialls, by these that
had ability to perform it, viz. A Cardinals Capp; but such was his modesty to
forbear it, because though Rome be a true visible Church in his opinion, yet
something dwelt with him, that hindered it, for a time, to wit, I suppose, his
dwelling here.

For his attempts against the Laws, the Subjects birthright, and the rights of
Parliaments, their chief support, and refuge, how little regard he had to
them, how much he did despise and abhor them, making it his Ambition to
prefer the contemners and abusers of them, and to set up his own Canons and
Constitutions above them, imposing of unjust and unlawful Oaths, Exactions,
Monopolies, all sorts of oppressions, stopping of Prohibitions and course of
Justice, rescinding of Acts of Parliament, advancing of Proclamations, and all
kind of Arbitrary power above the Laws of God or man, is fully expressed in
the Articles, and will more fully appear in the evidence. To conclude, Naaman
was a great man, but he was a Leaper. This man's Leaprosy has so infectted all,
as there remains no other cure but the sword of Justice; which we doubt not
but your Lordship will so apply, that the Commonwealth shall yet live again
and flourish.

When Sergeant Wild, had concluded his speech, the Archbishop humbly desired
the Lords, that he might have liberty to speak a few words to wipe of that
dirt which had injuriously bin cast upon him, that so he might not depart
thence so foul a person as he had been rendered to their Lordships by the
Articles. Which liberty being granted, he made a long premeditated Oration,
which he held written in his hand. A true extract whereof (communicated by him
in writing to diverse of his friends) you have here subjoyned.

My Lords;
MY being in this place in this condition, recalls to my memory that which I long
since read in Seneca, Tormentum est, etiamsi absolutus quis fuerit causam
dixisse (6 de Benef. c. 28.) It Is not a grief, only, no; it is no less than a
torment, for an ingenuous man to plead Capitally or Criminally, though it
should so fall out that he be absolved. The great truth of this I find at
present in my self; and so much the more, because I am a Christian; and not
that only, but in Holy-orders; and not so only, but by Gods Grace and goodness,
preferred to the greatest place this Church affords; and yet brought Causam
dicere, to plead for my self at this great Bar.

And whatsoever the world think of me (and they have bin taught to think much
more ill of me, then, I humbly thank Christ for it, I was ever acquainted
with,) yet, my Lords, this I find, Tormentum est, it is no less than a torment
to me, to appear in this place

Nay my Lords, give me leave to speak plain truth; No senrence that can justly
pass upon me (and other I will never fear from your Lordships) can go so
near me, as Causam dicere, to plead for my self upon this occasion, and in
this place.

For as for the Sentence, be it what it shall, I thank God for it; I am for it
at Saint Paul's ward (Acts 25. 11.) If I have committed any thing worthy of
death, I refuse not to dye: For I thank God, I have so lived, as that I am
neither afraid to dye not ashamed to live. But seeing the Malignity which has
been raised against me by some men, I have carried my very life in my hands
these diverse years past, But yet, my Lords, if there be none of these things
whereof they accuse me, though I may not in this Case, and from this Bar
appeal unto Caesar, yet to your Lordships Justice and Integrity, I both may,
and do; not doubting, but that God of his goodness will preserve my innocence.

And as Job in the midst of his affliction said to his mistaken Friends, so
shall I to my Accusers; God forbid I should justify you; till I die I will not
remove my Integrity from me, I will hold it fast and not let it go, my heart
shall not reproach me as long as I live, Job 22. 5.

My Lords, the Charge against me is brought up in ten Articles, but, the maine
heads are two: An endeavor to subvert the Laws of the Land, and the Religion
established; Six Articles, (the five, first and the last) concern the Laws,
and the other 4. Religion.

For the Laws, first, I think I may safely say, I have been, to my
understanding, as strict an observer of them all the days of my life, so far
as they concern me as any man has; and since I came into place, I have
followed them, and been as much guided by them as any man that sat where I had
the honor to sit. And of this I am sorry I have lost the testimony of the
Lord Keeper Coventry, and other Persons of Honor since dead.

And the Council which attended at the Council Board can witness, some of
them here present, that in all references to the Board, or debates arising at
the Board, I was for that part of the cause, where I found Law to be: and if
the Council desired to have the cause left to the Law, well I might move in
some cases, Charity or Conscience to them; but I left them to the Law, if
thither they would go; And how such a carriage as this through the whole
course of my life in private and public, can stand, with an intention to
overthrow the Laws, I cannot yet see.

Nay more, I have ever been of opinion, That Laws bind the conscience, and
have accordingly made conscience of observing them: and this doctrine I have
constantly preached as occasion has been offered me; and how is it possible,
I should seek to overthrow those Laws which I held my self bound in
conscience to keep and observe?

As for Religion I was borne and bred up in and under the Church of England as
it stands established by Law; I have, by Gods blessing, grown up in it to the
years which are now upon me, and to the place of preferment which I now bear.

I have ever since I have understood ought in my profession, kept one constant
tenor in this my profession, with out variation or shifting from one opinion to
another, for any worldly ends: And if my conscience would have suffered me to
do so, I could easily have slid through all the difficulties which I have
pressed upon me in this kind, But of all diseases I have ever held a Palsy in
Religion most dangerous; well knowing and remembering, that disease often ends
in a dead Palsy.

Ever since I came in place, I have labored nothing more then that the
external public worship of God (so much slighted in diverse parts of this
Kingdom) might be preserved and that with as much decency and uniformity as
might be: for I evidently saw, that the public neglect of Gods service in the
outward face of it, and the nasty lyeing of many places dedicated to that
service, had almost cast a dampe upon the true and inward worship of God, which
while we live in the body needs exteriall helps, and all little enough to keep
it in any vigor. And this I did to the uttermost of my knowledge, according
both to Law and Canon, and with the consent and likeing of the people; nor did
any command issue out from me against the one, or without the other.

Further my Lords, give me leave, I beseech you, to acquaint you with this
also, that I have as little acquaintance with Recusants, as I believe, any man
of my place of England has, or ever had sithence the Reformation; and for my
kindred, no one of them was ever a Recusant, but Sir William Web, grandchild to
my Uncle Sir William Web, sometimes Lord Major of London, and since which
some of his Children I reduced back again to the Church of England.

On this, one thing more I humbly desire may be thought on, That I am fallen
into a great deal of obloquie in matter of Religion, and that so far (as
appears by the Articles against me) that I have indeavored to advance and
bring in Popery: Perhaps my Lords, I am not ignorant what party of men have
raised these scandalls upon me, nor for what end, nor perhapps by whom set on;
but howsoever, I would feign have a good reason given me, if my conscience
stood that way and that with my conscience I could subscribe to the Church of
Rome, what should have kept me here before my imprisonment to endure the
libelling, and the slander, and the base usage that has been put upon me,
and these to end in this question for my life? I say, I would know a good
reason for this.

First, my Lords, is it because of any pledges I have in the world to sway me
against my conscience? No sure, for I have neither Therefore the fitter to make
a Popish Priest, Prelate, Cardinal.
Wife nor Children to cry out upon me to stay with them; And if I had, I hope
the calling of my conscience should be heard above them.

Is it because I was loath to leave the honor and profit of the place I was
risen too? Surely no, for I desire your Lordships and all the world should
know, I do much scorn the one and the other, in comparison of my conscience.
Besides, it cannot be imagined by any man, but that if I should have gone He
knew he could not have done them half the service by going over from hence to
Rome as by staying here to promote their designs; and that made him stay.
over to them, I should not have wanted both honor and profit; and suppose not
so great as this I have here, yet sure would my conscience have served my self
of either, less with my conscience would have prevailed with me, more than
greater against my conscience.

Is it, because I lived here at ease, and was loath to venture the loss of
that? not so neither; for whatsoever the world may be pleased to think of me, I
have led a very In secular employments inconsistent with, not in preaching and
pains in his Calling. Note this impudent asseveration here abundantly refuted.
painful life, and such as I would have been content to change, had I well
known how; and would my conscience have served me that way, I am sure I might
have lived at far more ease, and either have avoided the barbarous Libelling
and other bitter grievous scorns which have been put upon me, or at least been
out of the hearing of them.

Not to trouble your Lordships too long, I am so innocent in the business of
Religion, so free from all practice, or so much as thought of practice for any
alteration unto Popery, or any blemishing the true Protestant Religion
established in England, as I was when my In secular employments inconsistent

asseveration here abundantly refuted.
mother first bore me into the world; And let nothing be spoken but truth, and
I do here challenge whatsoever is between Heaven or Hell, that can be said
against me in point of my Religion, in which I have ever hated dissimulation.
And had I not hated it, perhaps I might have been better for worldly safety
then now I am: but it can no way become a Christian Bishop to halt with God.

Lastly, if I had any purpose to blast the true Religion established in the
Church of England, and to introduce Popery, sure I took a wrong way to it; for,
my Lords, I have staid more Belike he was born a Popeling.

Bishop or Divine in this Kingdom has done; and It was only by bringing Rome
home to them; or meeting them more then half way in their journey thither.
some of them, men of great abilities, and some persons of great place; and is
this the way to introduce Popery? My Lords, if I had blemished the true
Protestant Religion, how could I have brought these men to it? And if I had
promised to introduce Popery, I would never have reduced these men from it.

And that it may appear unto Your Lordships how many, and of what condition the
persons are, which by Gods blessing upon my labors, I have settled in the true
Protestant Religion established in England: I shall briefly name some of them,
though I cannot do it in order of time, as I converted them.

Henry Berkinstead of Trinity College Oxon, seduced by a Jesuit and brought
to London. (The Lords and others conceiving him to be Berchinhead the Author of
all the Libellous Popish Oxford Aulicusses, against the Parliament, at the
naming of him smiled: which the Archbishop perceiving, said, My Lords I mean
not Berchinhead the Author of Oxford Aulicus, but another.)

Two Daughters of Sir Richard Lechford, in Surry, sent toward a NVNNERIE.

Two Scholars of Saint John's College Cambridge, Toppin and Ashton; who had
got the French Ambassadors pass, and after this I allowed means to Toppin, and
then procured him a fellowship in Saint John's: And he is at this present as
hopeful a young man as any of his time, and a Divine.

Sir William Web, my kinsman, and two of his Daughters; And his son I took
from him, and his Father being utterly decayed, I bred him at my own charge,
and he is a very good Protestant.

A Gentleman brought to me by Master Chesford, his Majesty's servant, but I
cannot recall his name.

The Lord A great Actor in the late Irish Rebellion against the Protestants.
Mayo of Ireland, brought to me also by Master Chesford.

The Right Honorable the Lord. All know what a good Protestant he lived and
died.
Duke of Buckingham, almost quite gone between the Lady his Mother, and Sister.

The Lady Marquess Hamilton; was settled by my direction, and she dyed very
religiously and a Protestant.

Master Digby, who was a Priest.

Master James, a Gentleman brought to me by a Minister in Buckinghamshire, as
I remember.

Doctor Heart the Civilian, my neighbors son at Fulham.

Master Christopher Seaburne, a Gentleman of an ancient family in Herefordshire.

The Right Honorable the Countess of Buckingham.

Sir William Spencer of Parnton.

Master Both desperate Apostate Papists.
Shillingworth.

The sons and heirs of Master Winchcombe, and Master Wollescott, whom I sent
with their friends liking to Wadham College, Oxford; and received a
Certificate Anno 1638. of their continuing in conformity to the Church of
England. Nor did Mr Chainels Sermon at his Funeral, inform us, how good a
Protestant he lived and dyed.
ever any one of these named relapse again, but only the Countess of
Buckingham, and Sir William Spencer; it being only in Gods power, not mine, to
preserve them from relapse.

And now let any Clergy man of England come forth, and give a better account of
his zeal to the Church.

This speech being ended, all were commanded to withdraw: In the withdrawing
Master Hugh Peter's, who stood near the Archbishop, demanded of him, whether he
was not ashamed to make such a bold challenge in so honorable an Auditory, as
he had made in the close of his Speech, In bidding any Clergy man of the Church
of England to come forth, and give a better account of his zeal to the Church,
and conversion of Papists to our Religion then he had done? Adding, that
himself the unworthiest of many hundred Ministers in England was there ready to
answer his challenge, and to produce a Catalogue not of 22. but of above 120.
Papists, which he (through Gods blessing) had converted to our Religion, and
brought home to God besides, making them other manner of Converts then any in
his recited Bead-Rol, who were made neither good Protestants, nor good
Christians by him: Adding, that he and many other Ministers in England were
able to produce hundreds of real Converts to Christ, for every of his
pretended ones, some whereof by his own confession soon turned Apostates, and
the rest but little better. At which speech of his, the Archbishop seemed much
offended, and some of his friends there present taxing Master Peter's as an
unmannerly saucy fellow for using such language to him in this his afflicted
condition, desired him to trouble his Grace no further with such rude
discourse; whereupon they parted without more words.

If we survey this Oration of the Archbishop with an impartial eye, we may
discover abundance of shameless Impudency, and Pharisaicall
selfe-justification, beyond all bounds of Modesty, or Verity, broached in it;
so apparently contradicted by his manifold, unjust oppressive violent actions,
and Popish Innovations of all sorts, visible to the eyes of all men, and so
diametrally refuted by the subsequent evidence produced against him during his
seventeen days trial, that had not his brow been made of brass, and his face
of Adamant, he could not have justified so many gross untruths of him self,
before such an honorable public Auditory, and the supreme Judicatory of the
Realm, with so much shameless impudency as he did: But it is the common
practice of obdurate sinners, and cauterized Delinquents.

This Evening, the Lords Ordered the Archbishop to appear at their Bar the
next morning by 9 of the Clock, at which time they would proceed in his
Trial; Whereupon all departing for that time appeared the next day at the
appointed hour in the Lords House, where the Commons entering upon their
evidence, proved the Articles in their Order. I shall present you with the
sum and several branches of his charge; and then prosecute them in the
ensuing method.

The General Charge against the Archbishop, with the several branches thereof.
THe Charge against this Arch-Malefactor, consisting of many various particular
Crimes of high nature, is reducible to one general head, to wit, High Treason
against the King and Kingdom, thus expressed in the 1. Original, and 2.
Additionall Articles.

That he has Traitorously endeavored to subvert the fundamental Laws and
Government of the Kingdom of England, and instead thereof to introduce an
Arbitrary and Tyranicall Government.

This General is distributed into four Special branches in the Articles of
his Impeachment, under which all the particular Capital Offenses, and grand
Misdemenours given in evidence against him, at his Trial, are comprehensible.

1. His Traiterous endeavors and practices to alter and subvert Gods true
Religion by Law established in this Realm, and instead thereof, to set up
Popish Superstition and Idolatry, and reconcile us to the Church of Rome, the
particulars whereof are specified in the 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13.
Original, and 6. 7. 8. 9. Additionall Articles.

2. His Traiterous usurpation of a Papal and Tyranicall power in the Church of
England, in all Ecclesiastical affairs, in prejudice, and derogation of his
Majesty's Royal Prerogative and the Subjects liberties: comprised in the sixth
original Article.

3. His Traiterous attempts and endeavors to subvert the fundamental
temporal Laws, Government and Liberties of the Realm and Subjects of
England, and instead thereof to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyranicall
Government against the Law and Subjects liberties; expressed in the 1. 2. 3. 4.
5. 6. 13: Original, and 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 10. Additionall Articles.

4. His Traiterous endeavors to subvert the rights of Parliament, and ancient
Course of Parliamentary proceedings, and by false and malicious slanders to
incense his Majesty against Parliaments; contained in the 14. Original, and 1.
9. 10. Additionall Articles.

The first Specificall branch of the Charge against the Archbishop, touching
his Traiterous endeavors to alter and subvert Gods true Religion by Law
established among us, to introduce Popish Superstition and Idolatry in liew
thereof, and to reconcile the Church of England, with the Church of Rome, by
several stepps and practices; with the copious evidences produced to manifest
the same at his Trial.
THE true Religion by Law established, being that which is most precious,
claiming proceedency of all other sublunary things in respect of its own
intrinsicall Excellency, that which is nearest and dearest to every
conscientious Christian, the undermining and alterations where of, does most
concern and reflect upon the Archbishop in respect of his calling, as a
Minister, of his Ecclesiastical dignity, as an Archbishop of Canterbury, and
Primate and Metropolitan of all England, and of the special trust reposed in
him by his Majesty (who wholly committed the care of Religion, of all Church
affairs within his Dominions to this Arch-Prelates Care, mannaging,) and his
Charge concerning the Alteration and subversion of it, being that which he most
of all openly protested against, both in the beginning, proceeding, conclusion
of his long Trial, and on the very Scaffold at his death, we shall begin with
the Commons evidence given in against him concerning his endeavors, practices
to alter and subvert the same, and introduce Popish superstition and Idolatry
into our Church. Wherein notwithstanding all his specious pretenses, confident
Protestations, reiterated deep Asseverations of his Innocence, and of his
cordial syncerity to the true Protstant Religion, (wherewith he has deceived
many over-credulous people) we doubt not but upon the perusal of the various
evidences against him in this particular, he will appear the most desperate,
cunning, violent, palpable underminer, corrupter, alterer, subverter of the
true reformed Religion by Law established in our Churches, of one who professed
himself a real Protestant, and zealous maintainer of the same, that ever was
yet heard of in the Christian world.

He alone by his policies and power corrupting, undermining our Religion,
advancing Popery more in the few years of his Predominency, then the Pope with
all his Consederates both at home and abroad could do in almost fourscore
years before, by all their Plots and Potency, as shall be irrefragaly
demonstrated by his Actions, which cry louder and give in stronger evidence
against him, then all his fraudulent verbal protestations, or printed,
funeral Orations can do for him.

His Charge concerning the Alteration and subvertion of Religion, laid down in
the Articles, consists of these two general Members.

First, Artit Orig. 7. Additionall. 7.
That he has Traitorously endeavored to subvert Gods true Religion by Law
Established in this Realm, and instead thereof to set up Popish Superstition
and Jdolatry.

Secondly, Artit Orig. 210.
That he has Traitorously and wickedly endeavored to reconcile the Church of
England with the Church of Rome.

The latter of these is but the issue of the former, the first in projection,
but the last in execution, and the proof of the one, an indubitable evidence
of the other; which shall be prosecuted in their Order.

The evidence to prove the first general branch of his Charge, concerning the
alteration, ub version of Religion.
THe Archbishop in his Speech in Justification of his Innocence and sincerity
in matters of Religion, made at the Lords Bar at the entrance of his Trial,
most peremptorily, challenged all that was between Heaven and Hell justly to
tax him in any one particular, savoring either of Popish superstition or
Idolatry; But on the contrary, the Committee of the House of Commons might more
justly have challenged him in their entering upon his Charge, to nominate any
person, whether Prelate, Minister, or Laick in any age, professing himself a
Protestant, who during his abode on earth twixt Heaven and Hell, was so guilty,
so peccant in this nature as they should undeniably manifest him to be:
wherefore if they allotted him any place at or after his death, but Hell it
self, it must be either a Popish Purgatory, or such a middle place as some
Papists assign to that Newter Erasmus, betwixt Heaven and Hell, perchance some
losty Gibbet or Pinnacle in the Air, whereon his Head and Quarters might be
hanged up for a lasting Monument of his Treason in this kind: which they
manifested him to be guilty of by these ensuing particular evidences.

First, by his endeavors to set up and introduce all kind of Popish
superstitious Idolatrous ornaments, furniture, ceremonies in our church
formerly cast out of it upon the reformation: 1.
In pursuit whereof, they first trailed this Romish Fox to his own Kennel at
Lambeth, where having unkenneled, they chased him from thence by his hot Popish
sent, to the Kings own royal Chapel at Whitehal and Westminster Abbey, from
thence to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; from thence to Canterbury,
Winchester, and most other Cathedralls in England; and from them to our Parish
Churches and Chapels, all which he miserably defiled, corrupted with Popish
superstitious Crucifixes, Altars, Bowings, Ceremonies, Tapers, Copes, and other
Innovations.

To begin with his own Kennel at Lambeth: We shall first lead you by the hand

Innovations he there introduced, and constantly practiced since his instalment
in the Archbishopricke of Canterbury, never heard off in any his Predecessors
days since the beginning of reformation in King Edward the 6th. and Queen
Elizabeth's reigns.

First, we shall manifest what Idolatrous, superstitious Popish Pictures were
there newly repaired, furbished, erected by him in this Chapel, to the great
scandal of our Religion, and encouragement of Papists in their Idolatry,

to be utterly extinct, removed, abolished and distroyed, so that there remain
no memory of the same in Walls, Glassewindows, or else where within any
Churches or Houses: the Idolatrous superstitious Pictures set up in times of
Popery in the Glassewindowes of the Chapel at Lambeth house, were among others
defaced, demolished in such sort, that naught but a few broken imperfect
fragments of them remained, peeced up with white incoherent Glass, and so
continued altogether unrepaired, unfurbished, and utterly neglected, till this
superstitious Arch Prelate was translated to the Sea of Canterbury after the
death of Dr. Georg Abbot, as was attested by Sir Nathaniel Brent, Vicar
General, Dr. Daniel Featly household Chaplin to Archbishop Abbot, and Mr.
Pryn, who had been out in that Chapel, and exactly viewed it in Abbots days
and since: But no sooner was the Prisouer at the Bar, W. Laud translated from
London to Lambeth, but with all expedition and care, to his great cost [as
appears by the Glasiers Bills] he caused these demolished superstitious
Pictures in the Glassewindowes to be repaired, furbished, beautified, and made
more complete and accurate with new painted Glass, then ever before, setting
them up again in fresh lively colors, according to the very Pattern in the
great Roman Missall, or Mass Book (which he had diligently noted with his own
hand almost in every Page) so as no Chapel in Rome could be more Idolatrous,
Popish, superstitious in regard of such offensive Pictures, then his at
Lambeth, the particulars whereof, after (a late double serious view) were thus
attested before the Lords upon Oath, by Mr. William Pryn, Mr. Pember (the
Glasier who helped to repair and set them up) Mr. Dell the Archbishops own
secretary: Mr. Brown (his Ioyner) Sir Nathaniel Brent, and Dr. Featley.

That in the East Window of the Archbishops Chapel at Lambheth just over the
high Altar (there newly erected) consisting of five several Panes, there was
in the middle pane in painted Glass, a large Crucifix, or Picture of our
Savior Christ hanging on the Cross, under which were the Picturs of a Scul,
and of dead men's bones, with a Baskit full of Tools, Nails, and Round about
the Crucifix were the High Priests with their Officers an horseback, and some
Soldiers with others who crucified Christ, and the 2. thieves standing on
foot; which portrature was taken out of the very express pattern thereof in
the Archbishops own Roman Missall printed Salamanticae 1589. p. 304. Under
this Pane there were these latin verses in the Glass.

Ecce Pater Mystes, ubi Natus victimatristis,
Certaque mer^orum Serpens Medicina Delorum,
Defignant Iesum mundi pro crimine casum.
In the two next panes, were the two Thieves hanging on two Crosses on either
side of the Crucifix, standing in the midst: Under one was written in the
Glass, Domine memento mei, 1634. Under the other: Descendat de Cruce, 1634.
signifying the year when the Window was repaired; to wit, the very first year
after his translation from London to Canterbury: In the two outtermost panes of
this Window, there were the pictures of Abraham offering up his Son Isaac,
and of the Brazen Serpent elevated on a Pole in the Wilderness.

In the uppermost Window on the South Side of the Chapel, consisting of three
panes of painted Glass newly repaired, there was the picture of Christ rising
out of his grave, in the middle Pane, directly taken out of the portraiture of
it in his forementioned Roman Missall, p. 326. with the Picture of Jonah,
coming forth of the Whales belly, and of Sampson carrying away the Gates of
Gaza, in the other Panes.

In the second Window on the South side having three panes, there was in the
middlemost of them, the Picture of Christ, in fresh glorious Colors, ascending
up into Heaven, with his Disciples and others kneeling down on their knees and
praying to him: the pattern whereof was borrowed from this Missale Romanum,
page 352. where you may view it to the life. In the two other panes was the
picture of Enoch translated, and of Elias ascending up into Heaven in a fiery
Chariot.

In the third Window on the South side, consisting of three panes, in the
midlemost was a glorious radiant Picture of the Holy Ghost in form of a Dove,
descending on the Apostles in cloven tongues; the exact Idaea whereof you may
view at your leisure in his foresaid Roman Missall, page 360. whence he took
this pattern. In the other two adjoining Panes were the Pictures of Gods
giving the Law to Moses in Mount Sinai; and of fire descending from Heaven, at
the prayer of Elisha.

In the fourth Southern Window of three Panes, standing without the Skreene of
the Chapel (for no seats of Civil Judicature, and so not Christ's tribunal,
but only Ecclesiastical baudy Courts by this Arch-Prelates Canons must be
kept within the body of any Church, under pain of an High Commission Censure)
was the Picture of Christ, with his twelve Apostles, sitting on his judgment
seat, and judging the world, with sundry persons kneeling and adoring before
him, at the Papists use to paint the same; under which there were these latin
verses written.

Munde miser, plora, Iudex est Christus, odora,
Serve Dei gaude, Christo sub Iudice plaude.
In the two outward panes were the Picture of King Solomon in his throne,
disciding the controversy between the two Harlots, who was the true Mother of
the living Child; and of David passing sentence against the Amalekite, who
brought him tidings that he had slain King Saul.

In the uppermost window on the North side of the Chapel, having three Panes,
there was the Picture of Christ raising up Lazarus out of his Grave, and of God
Himself raining down Manna from Heaven: Extracted out of the Popish Book of
Pictures found in the Archbishops private study, entitled, Imagines Vitae,
Passionis and Mortis, D. N. Jesus Christi, Printed by Boethius a Bolswert: Anno
1623. With the Picture and story of Elias raising the Widows, and Elisha the
Shunamites Son.

In the second North Window, was the Picture of the Virgin Mary, with Christ a
sucking Babe in her Arms, and the Wisemen coming to and adoring Christ;
borrowed from the Roman Missall, page 39. under which was this Inscription in
the Glass, Omnes genetes quascunque fecisti venicut and adorabunt: In the
outward panes were the Portraictures of the Queen of Sheba coming to visit
Solomon, and of the Tribes of Israel coming up to Hebron to Crown David King
with the Picture of Christ administering his last Supper to his Disciples,
(which portraiture was derived from the Roman Missall, p. 181.) And the picture
of an old man, with a glory round about his head, representing God the Father,
striking Miriam with Leprosy.

In the third North window, there was the History of the Annuntiation,
gloriously painted, the Picture of the Virgin Mary, and of the Holy Ghost,
overshadowing her, and the Angel saluting her, together with the History and
Picture of the birth of Christ, both taken out of the Roman Missall; page 16.
36, 39. Wherein were likewise the Pictures of the burning-bush, and of Gedeons
Fleece. All these Idolatrous superstitious Popish Pictures, (lately broken and
defaced by the Soldiers placed in Garrison in Lambeth House by reason of the
great scandal they gave unto them,) were thus repaired and set up as new by
the Archbishops own special direction, at his proper charges, in his
Chapel at Lambeth in the Year 1634. as appears by the Glasiers Bills found
in his own Study at Lambeth, indorsed with the word, Paid. Master Pember the
Glasier deposed, that the Archbishop caused his Master to repair the said
Chapel Windows, and set up all those Pictures, paying him for that work:
Mr. Dell the Archbishops Secretary at tested, that the Archbishop thought fit
to repair them, they being formerly defaced, and thereupon gave order for
their reparation; And the Archbish. himself in answering this charge,
confessed and justified the fact; alleging, that the Chapel at his coming
to Lambeth lay so nastily, and the Windows were so peeced, and quite out of
Order and reparation, that it grieved his very heart to see it in such a
condition, so as he could not resort unto it to worship God with any comfort;
whereupon he gave Order for repairing, renewing these Glassewindowes, and out
of his fragments of the old painted Glass remaining in them, (not by the help
of the Pictures in his printed Masse-Booke) he made a shift as well as he
could, to make up the stories and representations formerly defaced, without any
addition, but only of New-Glasse in leiu of the old that was demolished.

Besides, Brown his Joyner being examined at the Lords Bar against his will,
confessed upon his Oath, that in the Chapel at Croyden, there was an old
broken Crucifix in the Window, which he by the Archbishops direction caused to
be repaired, and made complete; which Picture was there remaining very
lately; for which work Master Pryn found the Glafiers Bill discharged by the
Archbishop himself among other of his Papers.

Now that this Archbishop being by his place Primate and Metropolitan of all
Engl. principally entrusted with the care of Religion, who should of all other
men be most vigilant against all Popish Idolatrous Innovations, even in his
own principal Chapel at Lambeth, (whether many of the Nobility, Judges,
Clergy, and persons of all sorts, as well strangers as Natives, usually
resorted, and where most of our New Bishop^ were commonly Consecrated,) should
thus studuously and professedly repair, adore, and set up a fresh those
Idolatrous, Superstitious, Blasphemous Romish Pictures, which were by virtue of
our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions purposly defaced and broken down, as
Monuments of Popish Superstition and Idolatry, contrary to the Word of God, and
the established Doctrine of our Church in the very beginning of Reformation,
which had thus continued defaced during all his Protestant Predecessors times
without the least renovation, restoration, and that by the help and president
of the very Masse-Booke, making the Pictures in it the very Pattern to shape
his Chapel windows by, (even after sundry complaints against such practices
in and by sundry late Parliaments, and one Remonstrance in Parliament of this
kind against himself, Anno 1628.) in open affront of our Laws, Homilies,
Articles, Injunctions, Parliaments, Writers, to the great encouragement of
Papists, the infinite scandal of all sincere Protestants, and ill example of
diverse others, both Clergy and Laity, (who generally imitated his example in
repairing or new erecting in their Churches, Chappells, Colleges, Houses, the
like unlawful Popish Idolatrous Images,) it can doubtless proceed from no
other root, but a rotten Idolatrous Romish heart, and Traitorous endeavor to
alter or subvert oun establishd Protestant Religion in a more audacious open
way, then ever any Protestant Prelate before him durst attempt.

But was this all the Popish superstition and furniture in this Archbishops
Chapel? Truly no, all other parts of it must be suitable to the windows,
else there would neither be uniformity nor decency in it, according to his
corrupt opinion; Wherefore,

2ly. As he new molded his Chapel Windows; so he likewise altered the
ancient Communion Table; standing with the ends East and West, some distance
from the Wall Table-wise, even from the beginning of Reformation till his
coming to the Arch-Bishopricke without any Rail about it, into a New Altar
placed Altarwise against the Wall, with the ends North and South, hedged in
with a new costly Rail. Attested by Doctor Featly, Sir Nathaniell Brent, and
Master Pryn.

3ly. Upon this new Altar he had much superstitious Romish furniture never used
in his Predecessors days, as namely, two great Silver Candlestickes, with
Tapers in them, besides Basins and other Silver Vessels (with a costly Common
Prayer-Bocke, standing on the Altar, which as some say had a Crucifixe on the
bosses) with the Picture of Christ receiving his last Supper with his Disciples
in a piece of Arras, hanging just behind the midst of the Altar, and a Crucifix
in the Window directly over it; expressly taken out of the very Caremoniale
Romanum (found in the Archbishops study, who was very well versed in it,)
reformed by Pope Clement the 8. Parisijs 1633. l. 1. c. 12. p. 69. 60. which
prescribes thus; Supra vero in planitie Altaris adsunt Candelabra argentea, si
haberi possunt, sin minus ex Aurichalco, aut Cupro aurato pulchre fabricata,
etc. Et super illis Cerei albi, in quorum medio locabitur Crux ex eodem
Metallo, and opere praealta, ita ut pes Crucis aequet altitudinem vicinorum
candelabrarum, and Crux ipsa tota Candelabris superemineat cum imagine
sanctissimi Crucifixi, versa ad anteriorem Altaris faciem. Quod si Altar
parieti adhareat, applicari poterit ipsi Parieti supra Altar pannus aliquis
caeteris nobilior and speciosior, ubi intextae sint DOMINI NOSTRI JESU CHRISTI,
aut gloriosae Virginis, vel Sanctorum IMAGINES, nisi jam in ipso pariete essent
depictae, and decenter ornatae, Page 71. Habeant quaelibet Altaria DUO
CANDELABRA CUM CEREIS, and in medio, CRUCEM, CUM IMAGINE CRUCIFIXI, etc. Out of
Pontificale Romanum: set forth by Pope Clement the 8. Antuerpiae, 1626. page
57. In the Rubricke, De Consecratione Electi in Episcopum. Paratur Altar cum
Cruce, and duobus Candelabris, and super illud Missale, and Pontificale, and
pluviale album, etc. Page 280. 281. Vestiunt Altar tobaleis, and ornamentis
benedictis, ponentes desuper Crucem and alia Ornamenta. And out of the Canons
of the Popish Council of Aix, An 1583. (The only Canon I have met with for
railing in Altars, from which the Archbishop borrowed both the Railes and
furniturne of his Newerected Altar) which prescribes thus, ( Bochellus Decreta
Ecclesiae Gallicanae, lib. 4. Tit. 1. c. 80. p. 556. 557
) Unumquoaque Altar, ubi Commode Episcopus fieri posse judicarit, SEPI ATUR
OMNINO septo ferreo, vel lapideo, vel saltem LIGNEO, Quod septum ab Altari
distet saltem polices septem. Nec vero septum illud Laicus ingrediatur, dum
Missae sacrificium fit. Habeat unumquodque Altar propriam superlectilem, and
ornamenta decentia, tum ad ejus cultum and usum, tum ad Missae sacrificium in
eo Religiose decenterque peragendum: Altaria singula ornata sint Cruce in medio
collocata, nisi aliquae sit Imago, and CANDELABRIS DUOBUS AD MINUS, uno a
dextra, Altero a sinistra part posito. He who would thus regulate and adorn
his Altar, Chapel by the very Roman Ceremonial. Pontifical, and this Popish
Council, contrary to our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Canons, Writers,
condemning Altars, Tapers Crucifixes, must certainly be a Papist, both in
judgment, and practice, yea, a professed introducer of Popish superstition and
Idolatry. This new Altar furniture of his, was proved and attested upon Oath by
Sir Nathaniell Brent, Doctor Featly, Doctor Haywood (his own Popish Chaplain)
who justified his Lord, that he did it in imitation of the Kings Chapel at
White Hall, where he had seen not only Tapers and Candlestickes standding,
but likewise burnnig (in the day time) on the Altar.

Fourthly, As this Archbishop introduced an Altar, so likewise, a Credentia, or
side-Table into his Chapel, covered with a large Towel or Linnin Cloth, never
seen, nor heard of there before his time, whereon the bread and wine intended
to be consecrated at the Sacrament were first placed with a great deal of
solemnity, before they were brought up to the Altar: After which the
Archbishops Chaplains being about to Consecrate the Elements usually repaired
to this Credentia, and taking them from thence into their hands, made three low
bowings or Genuflections to the Altar, and coming up unto it, offered up the
Bread and Wine thereat upon their knees, and then laid them on the Altar; which
Ceremonies were there used in the Archbishops presence sundry times when the
Sacrament was administered if not by his special Direction, yet certainly with
his approbation, and without the least reprehension, as was proved by the
several Oaths of Sir Nathaniell Brent, Dr. Featley, Mr. Cordwell (once
servant to the Archbishop) Dr. Haywood also confessing he used this form of
celebrating the Communion, and Consecrating the Elements in the Archbishops
presence. Now this Credentia (the very Name his own Chaplains gave it) or
diminutive preparatory Altar, whereon the Bread, wine, Paten and Chalice must
first be solemnly placed, and from thence removed advanced to and offerred up
at the high Altar, is a mere Popish Vtensill, never heard of in any Protestant
Church, nor in the Church of England since reformation; the very Name and Thing
being prescribed and frequently mentioned in the Roman Caeremoniall,
Pontifical, and Missall, but seldom or never in any other Authors; Witness this
description of it. Caeremoniale Episcoporum l. 1. c. 12. p. 72. 73. 74. Restat

own Chapel here, and that by direction of the Roman Ceremonial, Pontifical,
Missall?

5ly. This Archbishop not content to introduce these former innovations,
himself and his Chaplains in their ingresse and egres used very low
incurvations to the Altar, and at their approaches to it to Celebrate the holy
Sacrament, or Consecrate Bishops, and in their returns down from it, they used
three very low bowings or duckings of their heads and bodies to the Altar,
never used in his Predecessors days, as was proved by the Oaths of Sir
Nathaniell Brent, Dr. Peatl^y, Mr. Cordwell, and acknowledged by D. Haywood,
the Archbishops Popish Household Chapline, a constant practisser of these
Ceremonious incurvations; directly derived from Popish Bishops, Priests Munks,
Missalls Ceremonials. Pontificalls as is most apparent.

practitioners of these ( Apud Bochellum Decreta Eccles, Gal. l. 4, Tit. 1. c.

These, with the Sea the Archbishops speech in Star chamber. p. 47. 48, 49.
Black Book of Windfor, made in the darkest time of Popish superstition and
Idolatry, were the several presidents and Authorities whence this Arch-Prelate
borrowed this Idolatrous Ceremony of bowing to his New erected Altar, and the
Crucifix on, or over it in the Glass window, never used nor enjoined before
his time in any Protestant Church, nor approved by any ancient Protestant
Author that can be produced, ( De Hey Iyns Cole from the Altar and Antidonum
Lincolniense. Dr. Pocklington, Reeue, Shelford and others.
) but some late Creatures of his own, whom he set on work to justify it in
Print, though condemned by many as Popish and Idolatrous.

7ly. He likewise introduced Gaudy Romish Copes into his Chapel (never used
in any his Protestant Prodecessors times,) wherein his Chaplins usual
Consecrated and Celebrated the Sacrament there, wearing them likewise at the
solemn consecration of Bishops, as was witnessed upon Oath, by Sir Nathaniell
Brent, Dr. Featley, and Master Cordwell; Dr. Haywood the Archbishops Chaplin
confessing at the Lords Bar, that himself did usually celebrate the
Sacrament in Lambheth Chapel in a Cope; Now these Gaudy Copes were directly
derived from the Papists Wardrobes as well as his other Chapel furniture,
witness Caeremoniale Romanum, l. 1. c. 16. p. 85. 87. Pontificale Romanum, p.
357. 358. De Benedictione sacerdotalium Iudumentorum and Thomas Beacons
Relics of Rome.

8ly. This Archbishop brought in Standing up, at every recital of, Glory be to
the Father, etc. after every Psalm and repetition of it, together with, Very
lowly bowing of the head and knee at every recital of the name of Jesus, never
there practiced in his Predecessors days, as Dr Featley, and Sir Nathaniel
Brent deposed. The first of these was derived from Ordo Romanus, de Officio
Missae: apud Georgij Cassandri Opera Parisijs 1616. p. 98. The latter ( See
Lame. Giles his Haultings: Anti-Armianisme p. 191, Appendix, and Queeres
concerning Bowing at the name of Jesus.
) of bowing at the name of Jesus from, Pope Gregory the tenth. who first
introduced and prescribed it, Sexti Decretalia lib. 2. Tit. 3. c. 2. from the
Popish Laurentius Surius council Tom. 3 p. 6. 741. 810.
Councils of Basil, Sennes, Augusta, with others, which enjoyne the use of it,
and from Caeremoniale Romanum, l. 2. c. 8. p. 206. which directs and prescribes
thus, Diaconus prosequitur Evangelim, and cum profert Nomen Jesus, vel Mariae
INCLINAT SE, sed profundius cum dicit, Jesus; quod ET OMNES FACIVNT.

8ly. He erected a new beautiful pair of Organs in this Chapel, which had
none before: attested by Dr. Featley, and Mr. Pryune, (now Organs were first
brought into Churches by ( Platina in vita ejus, Volateran Thomas Beacons
Relics of Rome, chapter Of the Ornaments of the Church: Of plain-song,
Prick-song, Organs, and singing in Churches. Histriomastix p. 283. to 287.
) Pope Vitalian, and promoted by other Popish Prelates;) and withal he brought
in such chaunting to them as is expressly prescribed is Caeremoniale
Episcoporum, set forth by Pope Clement the 8. lib. 1. c 28. De Organo,
Organistis, and Musicis seu Cantoribus, and omnia per eos servandain divinis;
the only Directory by which his Chapel with all our Cathedral Organ-playing
and Chaunting were regulated; as those who will peruse that Chapter, and
compare it, with our late Cathedral Music, will at first acknowledge.

Finally this Arch Prelate brought in all manner of Popish Consecrations into
his Chapel, never heard off, nor used in his Predecessors days; as
Consecrations of all sorts of Altar-furniture, Vestments, Flagons, Chalices,
which himself (arrayed in a Gaudy Cope) there solemnly Consecrated; attested
upon Oath by Mr. Samuel Bordman a reverend Minister; who deposed at the Bar to
this effect. That he having private intelligence of an extraordinary solemn
Consecration of some Flagons and Chalices brought from other Churches, intended
to be Consecrated by the Archbishop at Lambheth Chapel, repaired thither to
see the manner of it, being new and strange to him, which was performed in this
manner. Jn the midest of divine service the Archbishop and his two Chaplines in
their Surplices, coming out of their seats, and bowing very low, several
times one after another to the Altar, went up unto it; where the Archbishop
putting on a very gorgeous rich Cope, and bowing several times with his
Chaplains to the Altar, read thereat a parcel of scripture, used at the
Consecration of the Temple; which done, there were diverse Flagons and Cups
delivered to the Archbishop; who setting them down upon the Altar, used a
form of prayer, wherein he desired God to bless and accept of these Vessels;
which he severally touched, and elevated, offering them up to God. Now this
form of Consecrating Chalices, Flagons, Altar-clothes, and other furniture of
the Altar, is expressly prescribed, in and taken out of the Missale Paruum pro
Sacerdotibus in Anglia Jtinerantibus, p. 145. to 152. and Pontificale Romanum
p. 355. to 376. in both which there are particular Chapters and setformes, De
Benedictione sacrorum vasorum, and aliorum Ornamentorum in genere; De Patenae
and Calicis Consecratione: with sundry solemn consecration prayers, and these
two special Collects among others for that purpose, which it is likely the
Archbishop then used at this consecration.

Exaude, Domine Pater clementissime, precos nostras, and haec purificanda vasa
and Ornamenta sacri Altaris, atque Ecclesiae tuae sacri ministerij usui
praeparata, benedicere and sanctificare digneris; Per Christum Dominum nostrum,
Amen.

Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, I quo omnia immunda purgantur, and in quo omnia
purgata clare scunt, supplices Omnipotentiam tuam invocamus, ut ab his vasis
and ornamentis quae tibi offerunt famuli tui, omnis spiritus immundus confusus
long discedat, and per tuam benedictionem ad usum and ministerium sancti
Altaris, and Ecclesiae tua, sanctificata permaneant, per Christum Dominum
nostrum, Amen.

All these most palpable Idolatrous, Romish superstitions, Innovations, did
this Archbishop publicly introduce and practice in his own Chapel at
Lambheth, to the great triumphing of the Popish, the vexation, scandal of the
Protestant party, though all directly taken out of the Roman Missall,
Caremoniall, Pontifical, the Decrees of Popes, of Popish Counsels; and how
soon he would have there introduced the very Mass it self, had not the
Scottish troubles interrupted his designs, his own Notes of approbation
written in the Mass book, his framing the Scottish See A Necessary
Introduction to his Trial. p. 15^. to 164.
new Liturgy by it, with the ensuing particulars, will abundantly evidence un
to all the world, to his most just condemnation and eternal infamy.

At how great cost he was to make these Innovations and Alterations in his
Chapel, will be most clearly evident by the Glasiers, Ioyners, Painters,
several Bills, seized, in his Study al Lambeth; It appearing by Mr. Butler,
the Glasiers Bil that the mending and new painted Glatte of the East window
wherein the Crucifix was, amounted to 40. l. 8. s. 6. d. the mending and
repairing of two other Windows in the North and South side of the Chapel, to
72. l. 7. s. 6. d. and of two other Windows 35. l. 11. ^. By Mr. Brownes the
Ioyners Bill, that the Altar Table in the Chapel cost him 1. l. and the Rail
about it, 15. l. By Mr. Bab the Painters Bill, that the Guilding and Painting
of his new Organs there, and of the ledg over the Altar, cost him no less then
17. l. 15. s. besides all the rest of his Altar Furniture, Copes, Hangings,
Organ-pipes; so devoted was he to his superstitions, that he would spare no
Costs to promote them.

2ly. We shall pursue and trace this Romish Fox from his Chapel and public,
to his Study and private devotions: Mr. William Pryn, and Mr. William Bendy of
Lincolnes-Inne deposed, that they being employed to search the Archbishops
study, and private Closet at Lambeth; found these observable particulars
therein.

First, An English Bible of the last translation in Quarto, with a rich
embroydered Coverlying on his Study Table; having a goodly embroydered
Crucifixe on the Cover thereof; a fit object for his superstitious eyes, but
very incongruously fixed on this sacred Book, which so frequently in the * Old
and New Testament condemns all Exodus 20, 4, 5 Lev. 26. 1. Deuteronomy 4. 14. to 25.
1. 5. 8, 9. Isay 2. 20, etc. 30. 27. c. 31. 7. c. 44. 9. etc. Hoses 14. 8. Romans
1. 23. 24, 25. 1 John 5. 21.
Images and Crutifixes.

Secondly, A Popish Book neatly bound up in Turkey Leather with guilt leaves,
entitled, Imagines Vitae, Passionis and Mortis, D. N. Jesu Christi, printed by
Boethius a Bolswert, 1623. Cum gratia and Privilegio: beginning with the Picture
of the Annuntiation, and concluding with the Assumption of the blessed Virgin
containing in all 74. Idolatrous superstitious Pictures of Christ, and the
Virgin Mary (all which were licensed by the Archbishops Chaplain, yea bound up
in our English Bible, and New Testaments by this Archbishops privity and
consent, as shall be hereafter attested in its place:) Between the leaves of
this Book, there were 12. several loose Pictures in fine Vellom, about the
bigness of playing Cards of the largest size, gloriously and curiously
gilded, and set forth with most exquisite colors, some having one, others,
two or three Pictures a piece in them of Christ and the Virgin Mary in several
shapes and forms, with glories about their heads, and sometimes Crosses on
their backs, and the Holy Ghost in form of a Dove; pretty Babies for young
children to play with, but most insufferable Puppets, for an Old childish
superstitious Archbishop seriously to dote on, if not to reverence, adore, and
kindle his private devotions by.

Thirdly, two great Folio Roman Missalls, or Masse-Bookes of the largest size
neatly guilt and bound up: the one of them printed Antuerpiae 1630. having two
gilded Crucifixes on the outside of the Cover, with many Idolatrous Pictures
of Christ, Crucifixes, etc. printed within it accurately cut, in Copper pieces;
The other printed Salamanticae: 1589. with a Gregorian Calendar. Which Calendar
of this Roman Missall, the Archbishop had much noted with his own hand, adding
diverse new Saints-days unto each month out of Caluifius his Chronicle; to
which he likewise referred the times of his own advancement, of King Charles
his voyage into Spain, and his return from thence: Noting almost every page of
his Roman Missall with his own hand, and quoting Micrologus to it by way of
approbation, observing wherein they accorded or varied; no Book in his Study,
being so diligently noted with his own hand as it; A sufficient manifestation
of his good affection to and approbation of it. A grand Encomium for a
Protestant Archbishop.

Fourthly, A Pontificale Romanum, in a large Folio Volume, Clementis 8.
Pontificis Maxims jussu restitutum at que editam, Antuerpiae 1627. curiously
guilt and bound up in Turkey Leather: and a Caremoniale Episcoporum, Jussu
Clementis 8. Pontificis Maximi reformatum, in a large Folio, neatly bound,
printed Parisijs 1633. out of which two Books and Missalls the Archbishop
borrowed all his late Popish superstitious Pictures, Ceremonies, Innovations,
imitating their directions to an hairs breadth, as his principal Canons and
directories.

Fifthly, twenty two small Popish Hours of our Lady, Breviaries, Manualls,
and Prayer Books, standing all together in a blind corner of his study, many
of them curiously bo^d and guilt with Crucifixes on their Covers: answering the
exact number of h^ 22. pretended Converts to our Religion, who for their own
private advantage could easily close with such a Romish Prelate; who came so
near unto them ^n all the forementioned and subsequent particulars.

Sixthly, A B^^ of his own private prayers and devotions, all writ with his
own hand, many of them extracted out of the Roman Missall; Breviary and Hours
of our Lady, all of ^^em reduced under Canonical Hours of Prayer, after the
Romish Garb, witness ^^ge 1. to 8. thus entitled over head: Officium
quotidianum; and Hora prima; ^ra tertia, Hora sexta, Horanona, Vespers,
Completorium, Bedtime, and Nocte si Vig^s, page 8. to 104. (seven times over
a piece, for every day of the week:) his p^yer for the sick, p. 210. 114.
Noted by him to be In missa pro infirmis, page 88. His prayer at the laying of
the first stone in a Chapel, page 220. His prayer at the Altar when he
Consecrated Priests, page 155. Another prayer, Dum Altari adsto, a^ the
Sacrament; and whiles he fell down and lay prostrate before it, with others
o^ this nature.

All these compared together are a sufficient demonstration that this
Archbishop Studies, affections, intentions, devotions, were altogether
superstitious, Romish, Idolatrous, f^^ly symbolizing with the Church of Rome,
but wholly discrepant from out own a^^ all other reformed Churches.

Thirdly We shall follow him from his study and private Closet unto his public
Gallery, wherein, among others, there were these three superstitious Pictures,
seized and brought into the Lords House, attested by Mr. Pryn, and Master
Vaughan, who found them in his Gallery. First, a glorious costly Picture in a
very large frame of the four Fathers of the Church, Saint Ambrose, Saint
Chrysostom, Saint Austin and St. Herom, all in their Pontificalibus, with the
Picture of the Holy Ghost in form of a Love, hovering over their heads, and
from his beak distilling the rays streams, and influences of his graces
severally upon them.

Secondly, The Picture of the Cross, and of our Savior Christ all bloody,
newly taken down from his Cross, with many shaven-Crowne Friars, and Nuns
in their Habits standing and kneeling round about him.

Thirdly, Another Picture of Christ on a Ladder, with Priests, Munkes and
Popish Prelates about him.

In few words, He who had so much Popish Idolatry and Superstition of all sorts
in his Chapel, Study, Gallery, as all these forementioned particulars amount
unto, must doubtless have not only some sparks but flames of Popery, and
Romish affections, intentions in his heart.

2. His Popish Innovations in his Majesty's Chapel at White Hall.
Secondly, Having hunted this Popish Vermin from place to place in his own
Kennell, and bolted him out thence, we shall next pursue him from Lamb cross
the Thames, to the Kings own Royal Chapel at White Hall; where upon his
coming to be D^^e of his Majesty's Chapel, and after that Archb. of
Canterbury, he introduced, bowing to the Altar, himself there constantly
practicing this Ceremony, at his ingresse, egresse, (a Lane being made for him
to see the Altar, and do his Reverence to it) and at all his approaches toward
or to the Altar; which bowing and Veneration his Majesty's Chaplains were
there likewise enjoined by him to practice: and by his means in Passion week in
the years 1636. 1637. etc. a rich large Crucifix, imbroydered with Gold and
Silver, in a fair piece of Arras, was hung up in his Majesty's Chapel over
the Altar, to the great scandal and offense of many. For proof whereof (so
experimentally known to most of the Lords and Courtiers, who were eyewitnesses
of and disliked it,) Sir Henry Mildmay, Knight, a Member of the House of
Commons, and Master of the Jouell House, was produced; who deposed as follows.

That before the Archbishop came to be Deane of his Majesty's Chapel, there
was little or no bowing at all used by any to or toward the Altar, except only
at St. George his Peast, when the Knights of the Gartor, going up to offer at
it, made a civil kind of obeisance toward it, not out of any religious
respect, but at a (...) Ceremony anciently used by them only at this solemnity,
and by those of the Garter (...): But after he came to be Deane of the
Chapel, he constantly used bowing to the (...) at his ingresse, egresse, and
approaches to the Altar, causing his own and His Masties Chaplains to do the
like: That after he become Deane of the Chapel, for two three years
togegether or more, there was in Passim work a piece of Arras with a (...)
embroidered Crucifixe, the full length of a man, hanged over the Altar on (...)
Chapel at White Hall, which was never done before in his memory, nor in the
memory of any Courtier that he could hear of which Crucifixe he believed was
never ther^ used since King H. the 8. his Reign, till of late, That this
gross notorious Innovation ^ave great scandull and general offense to many
well-affected Courtiers, who spoke mu^^ against it, and to himself in
particular, who openly complained of it to the King, and sp^ke to the
Archbishop himself about it; yet it continued there sundry Passion weeks. And
to manifest the truth hereof more clearly to all the world, the very Crucifixe
it self was by special order sent for, and brought into the Lords House by
the ^erjeant of the Vestry at White Hall; who likewise attested the hanging of
it up ^ver the Altar in His Majesty's Chapel in the Passion Weeks; It was
very large rich, naked, scandalous, offensive, never used since the
Reformation, but only in ti^es of Popery; yet this most scandalous Idol did
this Arch-Prelate cause to be tha^ hanged up in His Majesty's Chapel as a
pattern of imitation for all others, well nowing the ancient Proverb to bean
experimental truth.

Claudian.
Regis ad exemplum (...) componitur orbis, etc. When he has thus introduced
these Romish Innovations into hs Majesty's Chapel; then the Altar, Crucifix,
and other Innovations in his Royal Cha^^el must be made the Canon whereby to
regulate all Cathedral and Parochial Churches, and so declared publicly in
print, by himself and his Confederates both in an Order made at the Council
Table concerning the placing of the Table in Saint Gregonies Church Altarwise,
3. Novemberis 1633. by this Archbishops own procurement, (published by Doctor
Heylen his Greature, in his C^ale from the Altar, page 62. and Antidotum
Lincolniense, cap. 2. page 62, 63.) by Peter Heylyn in his Coal p. 27.
Antidotum Lincolni: cap. 2. p. 29. to 67. his Moderate answer to Henry Burton
p. 57. 176. by Christopher Dew in his answer to Mr. Henry Burton cap 20. p.
191. and the New Canons 1640. can. 7. Now what a capital transcendent offense
this was in this Arch-Prelate (principally entrusted with the care of
Religion,) contrary to his trust and duty to introduce these scandalous
Innovations into His Majesty's own Royal Chapel will appear by these
particulare. First, that hereby he made the world believe. His Majesty was a
public countenancer of these Popish Innovations and (...), making him a Royal
open Patron of them, as much as in him lay: contrary to his own printed
Declarations to all his loyal Subjects before the 39. Articles, and after the
dissolution of the Parliament, Anno 16^8, Wherein he professed, he would never
(...) in the least degree to Popery, or superstition. Secondly, That he hereby
give just occasion both to Protestants and Papists at home and in foreign
parts, openly to report and believe that we were now relapsing to those
ancient Romish superstitions, Idolatries, corruptions we had formerly spired
one. 3ly. That hereby he endeavored to corrupt his Majesty; his Nobles,
Courtiers, Chaplain, and by consequence all his dominions in their Religion,
Fourthly, That by this means he perverted, seduced many thousands of His
Majesty's subjects, who from this pattern fell to a studious practice of
bowing to Altars. ^^erecting; Altari (...) in most Chappells Churches by
degrees. Fifthly, That hereby he scandalited, discouraged, grieved the well
affected Protestants, both at home and abroad; encouraged, hardened Papists in
their superstitions, and gave them great hopes of a speedy alteration of
religion, (...) they seconded with all their power and policy: Sixthly, That by
this practice he engendered great discontents, (...) misunderstanding (...) ^is
Majesty and his subjects; which could never yet be, cordially reconciled since
that time, but have grown wider every day almost to the utter ruin of our
three whole kingdoms.

To the former evidence, this further memorable testimony was subjoyned by way
of corroboration and aggravation.

Mistres Charnock (a Gentlewoman of good quality) and her Daughter jointly
deposed before the Lords, that on Maundy Thursday, about 6. years since, they
being at Whitehall with some other of their friends, whereof one was a Papist,
went into the Kings Chapel there to see it, where they saw an Altar with
Tapers, and other Furniture, on it, and a Crucifix over it: whiles they were in
the Chapel Dr. Brown of Saint Faiths Church under Paul's, (then a Deane, and
one of the King's Chaplains,) with his Curate came together into the Chapel,
and bowed three several times almost to the ground, to the Altar and Crucifix,
as they all conceived, and then kneeled down on their knees before them. A
little after there came two Semenary Priests into the Chapel, and bowed down
very low three several times to the Altar and Crucifix over it (as they
apprehended) just in the very same manner as Dr. Brown and his Curate did, and
then kneeled down before the Altar and Crucifix, for a little space, as they
had done. At which strange sight, Mistress Charnocke very much admiring, said
to those in her company; J never thought to have seen such a sight, that our
own Ministers and Popish Priests should thus repair one after another into
the Kings Chapel, and use the selfsame bowings, gestures to the Altar and
Crucifix, as if they were both agreed: Whereunto the Papist presently answered,
there is no such odds and difference between you and us as is conceived; which
one of the Semenary Priests over-hearing, used the like words; adding further,
Gentlewoman, you need not wonder at our bowing and kuteling, (to the Altar and
Crucifix) for you see that Ministers of your own Coat and Religion do the
like: and so they departed.

Now what a Capital Crime, and Treason this is for an Archbishop, entrusted
with the care of Religion, to bring in such Crucifixes, Ceremonies, Innovations
into his Majesty's own royal Chapel, as should invite even his Majesty's
Chaplains, and Popish Semenary Priests thus openly and promiscously to resort
into it to commit Idolatry with them; and there to use the very self same
bowings, adorations to the Altar, Crucifix, as Priests themselves usually
exercised, and openly upbraid us with, to the great offense and scandal of his
Majesty's Protestant Subjects, was humbly submitted to the saddest
consideration of his Judges, and all that heard this evidence,

3. ly. We shall next follow this Romish Fox from White Hall to Westminster
Abbey; where in January 1625. he exercised the Office of Doane of Westminster at
his Majesty's Coronation His Popists Innovations at Westminster Abbey at his
Majesty's Coronation.
putting Bishop Williams (then real Dean thereof) from this Royal service
incident to his place. In this solemnity of high concernment, we shall give you
a short information what he did with reference only to Popish superstition and
Innovation: In general, he compiled the form of his Majesty's Coronation
different from that of K. Edward the 6th. and King James: inserting some
prayers and Ceremonies into it out of the Roman Pontifical. That himself
compiled it, appears by See the Breviat of his life p. 7.
his own Diary, and the original Copy corrected with his own hand, of which
hereafter in its proper place: In particular.

First, he caused all the R^brickes in this New form of Coronation to be
written in red Letters, as they are in the Roman Pontifical para 1. p. 163.
etc. whereas all formet, manuscripts of Coronations, found in his Study, were
written only with black Ink, as appeared by the Books themselves, (writ in
times of Popery and since) and by Master Prynnes attestation, who perused them
all.

2ly. He specially inserted this Note into the Margin of the Coronation Book.
All this Unction was performed IN FORMA CRVCIS, AND THE OLD CRVCIFIX among the
Regalia, STOOD ON THE ALTAR of which no mention ^^ made in the Coronation of K.
Edward the 6th. or King James: Which form of anointing the King after the
form of a Cross, is directly taken out of the Roman Pontifical. parts. De
Benedictione and Coronatione Regis: p. 167. Post hoc Metropolitanus intinget
pollic ^^^ dextrea manus in (...) and INVNGIT IN MODVM CRVCIS illius brachium
dexterum, etc. And that the old Cross, used only in times of Popery, should it
this royal solemnity be placed on the high Altar, among the Kings Regalia (as
its usual in foreign Popish Cathedralls and Altars if we may credit, Page
69. 70. 9. 43. 78. 110. 157, 162. 165.
Ceremoniale Episcoporum, and the several Portraitures in it) was a sad Omen
at the consecration of a Protestant King, to inure, if not enamor him with such
Popish superstitions in the very beginning of his reign.

3ly. The Oil wherewith he was anointed (as appears by the marginall Notes)
was solemnly consecrated by a Bishop: which Consecration of the Oil is a mere
Popish Relic, as appears by Pontificale Roman^ de Benedictione and
Coronatione Pegis; Thomas Beacons, Relics of Rome, Bochellus, Decreta,
Eccles. Gal. l. 5. Tit. 2. and l. 2. Tit. 6.

4ly. He inserted diverse Prayers into the form of the Kings Coronation taken
verbatim out of the Roman Pontifical; Among others, this ensuing Prayer (which
you shall find in Latin in the Roman Pontifical. p. 171.) used at the Kings
inthronization after his unction, tending to the advancing of the Bishops and
Clergy above the Laity.

Stand and hold fast from henceforth, the place to which you have been heir
by the succession of your Forefathers, being now delivered unto you by the
Authority of the Almighty God, and by the hands of us, and all the Bishops and
servants of God; and as you see the Clergy to come nearer to the Altar then
others, so remember that in places convenient you give them greater Honor;
That the mediator of God and man, may establish you in the Kingly Throne, to
be the mediator betwixt the Clergy and the Laity and that you may reign for
ever, with Jesus Christ the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who with the
Father and the holy Ghost lives and reigns for ever, Amen.

4ly. Popish Master John Cosens (as appears by the Marginall Notes) when the
Prayers appointed for the Coronation, were there read, kneeled behind the
Bishops, giving direction to the Quire when to answer: acting the Office of the
Master of Ecclesiastical Ceremonies; whose Office you may read at large
described in Caeremeniale Epescoporum: Lib. 1. c. 5. p. 19. De Officio
Magistrarum Caremoniarum.

5ly. After the Coronation ended, this Archbishop voluntarily of his own accord
offered the Kings Regalia on the Altar in a Popish manne, without any Rubricke
or direction, as appears by this passage in his Diary written with his own
hand Feb. 2. 1625. Solemnbus fiuitis in ^^ield magis West^con. quum tradidit
mihi in manus Regalia quae in Ecclesia B. Petri West^^on servantur: de novo
dedis Gladium Cortanam dictum, and duos alos qui coram Ree^ eo die deferbantur
ut servar^utur cum reliquis infignibus; in Ecclesiam Redij, ET, AD ALTAR
SOLENNITER O^TVLI NOMINE REGIS, and cum alijs reposui.

Certainly had this Archprelate been inflamed with any such extraordinary
reale to the Protestant Religion, as he pretended, he would not have introduced
so many Popish Caeremonies out of the Roman Pontifical, into his Majesty's
solemn Coronation, but utterly excluded them out of the form of Coronation he
then compiled: Ex Cauda Draconem you may take a scanding of this Dragon by his
Tail, who endeavored to poison his Majesty as much as in him lay, with Romish
superstitions in his very Inauguration to his Crown the sad effects whereof,
we have since experimentally discerned to our sorrow and greatest grief.

4ly. We shall in the next place follow this little Fox in his Romish
Procession, 4 His Popish Innovations in the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge.
from Westminster, to our two famous Universities of Oxford and Cambridge,
whose Crystal Fountains he extraordinarily poisoned with Popish
superstitions, Innovations, Caeremonies of all (...), and in them our Church
and State.

Before this pragmaticall Arch-Prelates advancement to be a Prime Favorite in
Court and supreme, Comptroller of all Ecclesiastical affairs in our Church,
our Universities had neither Crucifixes, nor Jmages, nor Altars, nor bowing to
Altars, nor Copes, nor Latin service, nor any such Relics of Rome to pollute
them, or corupt young Scholars with the superstitious Rites and Caeremonies of
the Babilonish Strumpet; but no sooner was he become a Royal favorite, Privy
Councellor of state, and Dominus factetum in Church and Republik, but by his
pestiferous influence, practices, and example these Popish weeds sprung up a
pace by degrees in these choycest Seminaries of Piety and literature, till they
quite overspread them at the last.

We shall begin with the University of Oxford, whereof by indirect means this
Prelate procured himself to be elected Chancellor, upon the death of the
Right Honorable Will. Earl of Pembrooke, in Apr. 1630. whose Noble brother
(now Chancellor thereof) was then really elected by most voices, though
miscalculated by practice in the scrutiny by this Prelates Creatures. What
alterations were there made upon his advancement, and Chancellorship, will
appear by these subsequent depositions given viva voce against him at the
Lords Bar.

Sir Nathaniell Brent deposed; that before this Archbishop came to have power
in this Universitie and to be Chancellor thereof, there were no Copes,
Altars, nor Communion Tables turned and rayled about Altarwise in Churches or
Colleges, nor any bowing to or toward the Altar, nor any Crucifixes but such
as were either defaced, or covered over with dust, and quite neglected; but
since his being Chancellor the Tables in all or most Churches, Colleges were
turned into Altars, or rayled in Altarwise, and usually bowed unto; the old
Crucifixes repaired, adored, and new Crucifixes set up where there were none
before; yet he never heard that the Archb. disliked or reproved the same,
though he was Chancellor, and saw these Innovations, but liked them very well:
That since the Archb. was Chancellor there was a New Church Porch built to St.
Mary's Church, (at the charge of Dr. Owen, since made a Bishop;) where was none
before, standing in the very heart of the University toward the street, to
which Church all the University resorted; in the front of which Porch was a
statue of the Virgin Mary cut in stone, with the Picture of a child in her
Arms, commonly taken to be the Picture of Christ.

Master Corbet, a Fellow of Merton College deposed; that in the Year 1638.
the Archbishop being Visitor of that College began his Visitation there, by
Sir John Lamb his Deputy that one Article propounded to the Warden and Fellows
was this; Whether they made due Reverence (by bowing toward the Altar or
Communion Table,) when they came into the Chapel? That himself and Master
Channel were enjoined by the Visitors and Commissioners to use this Ceremony;
but they refused to do it: Whereupon Sir John Lamb pressed them very much to
practice it; but they still refused, propounding their reasons against it; then
he threatened him for it in particular. After this Dr. Frewin Vice Chancellor
of the University told him, that he was sent to him from the Archb. he being
then Proctor, pressing and requiring him as from the Archb. to use this
Ceremony in regard of his place else it would be ill taken. Afterward the
Archb. sent injunctions to Merton College whereof this was one: Habeant
debitam Reverentiam ad mensam Domini; where by he meant this bowing to the
Altar, as the Visitors and common practice expounded it: the Visitors
afterward questioning those who bowed not; That this course continued till
this present Parliament, and was generally practiced at Saint Mary's, and
throughout the University. He further testified, that in Magdalen College,
there was a Crucifix placed over the Communion Table, and Pictures in the
Windows; and a new Crucifixe set up in Christ-Church; none of which
Innovations were there heard of before this Archbishops time.

Master William Bendy, witnessed upon Oath, that in the Year 1637. Since the
Archbishop was Chancellor of Oxford, there was a statue of the Virgin Mary
With a Child in her Arms, set up in the front of Saint Mary's Church Porch
toward the open street; which gave great offense to many: That there was a
Crucifix set up in Lincoln College and a Picture of the Holy Ghost another
Crucifixe in Christ-Church; another in New-Colledge, and the like in diverse
other Colleges, That Latin Prayers were enjoined to be used in Lent, and
Studients to be present at them: That the Tables in most Churches, Colleges
were turned into Altars railed in Altarwise and bowed to: That in some
Colleges they used Copes, and he heard a stranger who had bin a Travailer
say, that one of the Copes he saw at Oxford was just like that he had seen at
ROME on the POPES back.

Master Nixon one of the Aldermen of Oxford deposed viva voce, that there was a
Picture of Stone set up in the New-Church porch at Saint Mary's Church toward
the high Street, of a Woman holding a Babe in her Arms, which they called the
Picture of the Virgin Mary and Christ, (standing almost opposite to his House)
which was very scandalous, offensive both to him and others: that himself had
seen some passengers as they rode along by it, to bow very low to their Horses
manes, and put off their Hats unto it: that he observed one Passenger, both
going and returning to bow thus unto it, and put off his Hat, who (as he heard)
belonged to the Portugal Ambassador, and was a Papist; that there was one who
kneeled down before this Image, and held up his hands as if he prayed unto it.
He further deposed, that not only in sundry Colleges, but in the Parish Church
of Carfolks. (the principal Church for the City, whether the Major and
Aldermen resorted;) there was a great large Crucifix with the Picture of Christ
upon it, set up in the Window by Giles Widows who was Parson there, and one
whom the Archbishop countenanced.

That this Archbishop was both the Author, and encourager of all these
innovations not heard of there since the Reformation; is evident: because they
sprung up there in the time of his Chancellorship, and were introduced, by
those who were his greatest Creatures, enjoined by his Visiters (as you heard
before) and most of them prescribed in the University Statutes, made by
himself, which all were bound by Oath to observe. To clear this we shall
produce this Memorable passage. Sect 1. paragr. 2. De Precibus solennibus, and
Oblationibus in Die Comitiorum. (which you may find in the select Statutes of
Oxford, there printed in a small volume, Anno 1638. p. 79.) In die Comitiorum
Moris est, ut post pulsationem parvae campanae, circa hor am nonam matutinam,
omnes Inceptores in qualibet facultate, per Bedellos suae Facultatis a
Collegijs and Aulis deducti, in Capella orientali Ecclesiae B. Mariae Virginis
una conveniant, ijsque sic congregatis, preces Divinae ab ejusdem Ecclesiae
paraecialis Vicario aut illius Deputato solenniter habeautur. Quibus peractis,
primum Vice-Cancellarius, postea singuli Inceptores in Facultatibus, deinde
Procuratores, Bedellis praecuntibus, ad Mensam Eucharistiae sacram, CVM DEBITA
REVERENTIA (which they by words and practice interpreted to be a lowly bowing
to, or toward it) OBLATIONES FACIANT. Quod si quis I Precibus sole nuibus and
OBLATIONIBVS absens fuerit, aut praesens CUM DEBIT A REUERENTIA AD MEN'S AM
EUCHARISTIAAE SACRAM accedere recusaverit, puniatur pro arbitrio
Vice-Cancellarij, ac insuper mulctetur. 5s.

Here we have bowing to the Table or Altar prescribed by a Law, as a REVERENC
DVE UNTO IT, AND OBLATIONS at it enjoined to all Graduates whatsoever of any
kind of faculty, to be acted solemnly in the University Church of St. Mary's in
the Act time under pain of such arbittary punishments, as the Vice Chancellor
should inflict, and 5. s. Fine, upon such who refused or neglected this solemn
oblation at or bowing to the Altar, both which they were bound by Oath, to
perform and observe, being one of the Statutes of the University, to which (
Dabis fidem ad observandum statuta istius Vniversitatis, etc. Statuta selectae
Corpore statutum Vniversitatis Oxon Tit. 9. Sect. 6. Paragr. 1. p. 114.
) all Graduates swore obedience: Yea this their ceremony of bowing to, and
prostration before the Altar, was so well pleasing, and well known to the
Archbishop himself, that in one of his letters sent to the University of
Oxford, (Dated at Lambheth 28. January 1639. recorded in their Public
Register: f. 166.) he importunes them to pray for him, as often as they should
prostrate themselves before the Altar, in these very terms, Quoties CORAM
ALTAR DEI and Christi ejus PROCIDATIS, videte sitis inter orandum memores mei
Peccatoris: sed and Amici and Cancellarij vestri, W. Cant. Whence the
Archbishop took his Pattern for enjoining Graduates thus by new University
Statutes, and the Fellows, Scholars of Merton College, by his Visiters, to
bow, and yield due Reverence to the Altar, is worthy special observation:
doubtless it was from none other but his own Popish Predecessor. Cardinal
Poole, Archbishop of Canterbury in Queen Mary's days, who reduced reconciled
our Kingdoms of England and Ireland to the Popes obedience and superstitions
which they had formerly cast off in King Edwards days. For this Cardinal
Archbishop. Visiting the University of Cambridg by his substitutes [whereof
Ormanet the Popes Datary was one] among other Laws and Injunctions, (as Mr.
Acts and Monuments Edit. 16. 40. ^ vol. 3. p. 773. Edit. 1610. p. 1781.
Jo. Fox Records) prescribed every Scholar there AFTER WHAT SORT HE SHOULD BOW
HIMSELF TO THE ALTAR: there being no other ancient president extant in any of
our own Universities Statutes (nor for ought I find in foreign Academies)
prescribing bowing to the Altar, unto any Academians, but this of Cardinal
Poole alone. And must not he be a mere Popish Prelat, and Chancellor in good
earnest, who thus makes his Popish Cardinal Predecessors Injunctions in Queen
Mary's bloody Reign, the sole Rule whereby to reform the University of Oxford
in King Charles his days?

Finally, this Archbishop, in hope that solemn Popish Processions might in
short time creep up into use again, in our Universities, as well as
Crucifixes, Copes, Latin service, and bowing to Altars, among other his new
Oxford Statutes, continued, and revived this, whereby all Regent Masters were
bound to read and sing in solemn Processions, as the Proctors should assign
them, be it right or wrong: witness this Clause in the large Ledger Parchment
Book of this Universities new Statutes. Tit. 9. Sect. 1. paragr. 5. Iurabis,
quod Leges and Cantabis IN SOLENNIBVS PROCESSIONIBVS secundum assignationem and
dispositionem Procuratorum, vel si recusaveris, solves Us. in usum
Vniversitatis, per Procuratores exigendos: Resp. Iuro. which was read.

Now thus to oblige men by Oath to read and Chaunt in Processions, what the
Proctors should appoint, (be it the very Mass it self, or a Popish hymme or
prayer taken out of the Roman Missall, Caeremoniall or Pontifical) how far
it trencheth upon the liberty of men's consciences, extends to the Alteration of
Religion, and conduced to corrupt the University, was humbly submitted to the
serious considerations of the Lords, and all others.

We have thus given you a brief account of this Arch-Prelates, Popish
Innovations in the University of Oxford, where he was then a real Chancellor,
and ought in duty to have suppressed them; the sum whereof is this; that in
most Churches Colleges, Chappells both in this University and City, during the
time of his Government, Communion Tables were turned, railed in Altarwise,
changed into Altars; scholars of all sorts and degrees enjoined by Statutes
and Oaths, (especically in the puplique Act solemnities) to bow themselves
down and yield due reverence to the Altar, to present their oblations thereat,
which they must neither refuse nor neglect under pain of 5. s. fine and other
Arbitrary punishments; Latin service with the Chaunting of it, and solemn
Precessions, introduced, enjoined; Copes used, Crucifixes repaired, beautified
where formerly defaced, and new erected where none were before: a New Statue of
the Virgin Mary with Christ a babe in her Arms set up in the most public
noted place of all the University, where all passengers might behold it; yea
public adoration, Capping, bowing, kneeling yielded to it, without the least
check, dislike, yea with the highest approbation of this pretended zealous
Protestant Chauncellor, to the poisoning of many Graduates, Students in this
most famous Academy. What Romish Alterations, Innovations of like nature he by
his Instruments, Favorites, Chaplins brought into the University of Cambridge,
(of which he was more then half Chauncellor in reality, though the Earl of
Holland had the Title, and afterward sole Visitor by a Decree at Council
Table, as mere Archbishop of Canterbury;) we shall in the next place evidence
by substantial Proofs.

In the University of Cambridge, the Archbishop since his greatness by his
extraordinary His Popish Innovations in the University of Cambridge.
power brought in diverse of his Creatures, Chaplains to be heads of houses and
Vice-Chauncellors (as Dr. Martin, Dr. Cosins, Dr. Beale, Dr. Laney, with others
Popishly affected) who within the space of ten years introduced the several
Popish Innovations, Ceremonies, specified in the following depositions

Mr. Wallis a Scholar and Graduate of this University, deposed: That Altars,
Pictures, Crucifixes were there of late set up in most College Chappells, and
in some Churches; particularly, that in Peter house Chapel there was a
glorious new Altar set up, and mounted on steps, to which the Master, Fellows,
Scholars bowed, and were enjoined to bow by Doctor Cosens the Master, who set
it up; that there were Basins. Candlestickes, Tapers standing on it, and a
great Crucifix hanging over it. That in the University Church of St. Mary's
there was an Altar raised in, to which the Doctors, Scholars and others
usually bowed: That these Altars, Crucifixes, Candlestickes, Tapers, and bowing
to Altars, continued till after this Parliament, and were brought in since the
Archbishops time by means of Bishop Wren, Doctor Cosens, Dr. Martin and
others, all Canterburies great favorites.

Master Nicholas le Greise, (late Student in Cambridge) witnessed upon Oath^
that in St John's College, Kings College, Trinity College, and Peter house
there were Altars, Candlestickes, Tapers, and Crucifixes, newly set up: That in
St. John's, and Peter House Chappells, there were Pictures of the Holy Ghost in
form of a Dove; that in Peter House there was likewise a carved Cross at the
end of every seat, and on the Altar a Pot, which they usually called the
incense pot: that the Master, Fellows, and Scholars of that house at their
entering into, and going out of the Chapel, made a low obeisance to the Altar,
being enjoined by Doctor Cosens under a penalty (as they reported) to do it;
and none of them might tume their backs toward the Altar going in nor out of
the Chapel: That diverse Scholars of other houses usually resorted thither,
some out of Curiosity only to behold, others to learn and practice the Popish
Ceremonies and Orders used in that Chapel: and the common report both among
the Scholars of that House and others, was, that none might approach to the
Altar in Peter house but in Sandalls and that there was a special consecrated
Knife there kept upon the Altar, to cut the sacramental bread that was to be
consecrated.

Master Lazarus Seman deposed, that he left the University of Cambridge about
ten years since, and that in his time none of the forementioned Innovations
were so much as known or used there; but of late times they have all been
introduced.

Many more witnesses were ready to depose the like, and more then this, but the
Innovations of this kind were so notoriously known to all, and so fully
proved before the Parliament in Master Peter Smarts Articles against Doctor
Cosins, that the Commons thought to produce more witnesses herein, would be a
mere mispence of time to no purpose, but to tire out the Lords and Auditory.

But perchance the Archbishop will object; what are these Innovations in the
University Object.
of Cambridge unto me, who was neither Chancellor there to council, or
countenance them, nor immediately introduced them? Answer.


To which was Answered, 1. That his public example and practice in his own
Chapel at Lambheth (formerly manifested) was both a president, precept for
this their imitation and one chief cause of these Innovations. It was a true
rule of De summo Bono, l. 2. c. 20.
Isiodor Hispalensis; Dupliciter reus est qui aperte delinquit quia and agit
and docet. And a just verdict of the Roman Orator Cicero de legibus. l. 3.
Perniciosius de Republica merentur vitiofi Rectores, quod non solum vitia
concipiunt ipsi, sed ea infundunt in Civitatem; neque solum obsunt quod illi
ipsi corumpuntur sed etiam quod corumpunt. Since then his own preceding
Innovations, were the occasions of these Corruptions in this University, they
must be laid upon his score. 2ly. His own Introduction of the selfsame Popish
Innovations into the University of Oxford, by Laws and Injunctions, at the
selfsame time, or a little before these sprung up in Cambridge is a strong
presumption, that both of them issued from the very same root. 3ly. His own
chief Favorites, Chaplains, Creatures, who were most intimate, frequent with
him at London, and advanced to Headships in Colleges by his means, were the
only active Instruments to bring in and promote these Corruptions; therefore
questionless they had directions, at least incouragment from him for their
proceedings in this kind. 4ly. His not being Chauncellor of this University,
was rather an obstacle to the speedy Introduction of these Innovations then
otherwise, as appears by Oxford where he prescribed them by public Laws and
Injunctions, which was not done in Cambridge, because he was not Chauncellor;
yet he would needs be their Immediate Visitor, as Archbishop of Canterbury,
contesting with them for this Authority before his Majestic and Privy
Council, where he obtained a Decree and Patent to him and his Successors to
be their Visitors; in regard of which Jurisdiction over this University as
their Visitor, and likewise as an High Commissioner, he wanted no authority
but only will to prohibit, suppress these Popish Novelties, and punish the
promotors of them; but this, for certain, he never did, but countenanced,
advanced them all he could (as shall be manifested in due place:) Therefore,
if the old Maxim of Law may take place: Gratian distinct. 86.
Qui non vetat peccare cum posset, jubet, he must be really guilty of all
these Antichristian Innovations in both our Universities, whom he thus
miserably corrupted to the unspeakeable prejudice of Church and State, since
from these two Fountains these Popish superstitions, corruptions, diffused
themselves over all our Dominions, like a most contagious Leprosy. Foutes
venero inficere, est non tantum contra morem Majorum, sed etiam contra fas
Deorum. Florus Historiae lib. 1. Grotius de Iure Belli. lib. 3. c. 4. Sect. 16.

It has always been a Capital crime, and an offense against the Law of God,
of Nations, to poison common Natural fountains; how much more then these two
public Fountains of more transcendent, use and excellency.

From our Universities we shall in the next place pursue this Romish Reinold
5. His Popish Innovations and superstitions in Cathedral Churches.
unto our Cathedral Churches, where he began his Popish Innovations very
early.

Master John Laugly, late Schoolmasters of the City Gloucester, but now of
Paul's School, deposed, that in the year 1616. the now Archb. being made Deane
of Gloucester, and coming down to the Cathedral there, intended to turn the
Communion Table into an Altar; and place it Altarwise at the East end of the
Quire, removing it from its former station in the midst; Doctor Smith then
Bishop of GLOUCESTER opposed it with much earnestness; and seriously protested
to the DEANE and the Prebends, that if the Communion Table were removed, or any
such Innovations brought into that Cathedral as this Deane intended to
introduce, he would never come within the Walls of the Cathedral more: yet
notwithstanding the Deane was then so violent, that in despite of the Bishops
direction and opposition, he caused the Lords Table to be removed, and placed
Altarwise at the East end of the Quire close under the Wall, with the ends
North and South, with Popish furniture upon it, bowed toward it himself, and
commanded the singing-men, Choristers, and other Officers of the Church to make
like obeisance to it: Whereat the Bishop was so much offended, that he made
good his protestation, and never came more within the Cathedral till his dying
day; This single testimony of Mr. Langlies we find seconded with a Letter of
this Bishops Chaplain to the Chancellor at Gloucester; thus indorsed with the
Archbishops own hand, and found at Lambeth among his Papers by Master Prynne.

Febr. 12. 1616. A Copy of the Libell against the removing of the Communion
Table in the Church of Gloucester.
MAster Chancellor, I pray you certify me how things stand at Gloucester, we
hear strange things of late here with us, that seem almost incredible. It is
reported here for a truth, that the Communion Table in your Cathedral Church
is removed by your new Deane, and put up close at the upper end in the place
where the high Altar heretofore stood, and that they make low obeisance to it
with great Reverence, as NOTE.
if Christ were there upon it, and that this has much offended the whole City
almost, And yet that not any one of the Prebends did so much as offer by word
or deed to resist him, or to tell him what harm this example might do, and
how much hereby, the secret Papists would be stirred up to rejoice, hoping for
that which they have long looked for now to be near at hand. Was there no man
had any spark of Elias spirit to speak a word in Gods behalf? O lamenrable
times in which we live, that these things are swallowed down by your Preachers
in silence: I forbear to say much till I be certified from you the truth of
all matters. I hope it is not so, for I cannot think your Prebends would be so
fainte hearted (having also the Law of the Land on their side, that it ought
not to stand there where the Altar stood) as to shrink at the first wetting
without any pressing. Speedily send me word I pray you, and so with my hearty
commendations I end.

Your loving Friend John White.
Winchcombe 12th of Feb. 1616.

A Copy of this Letter (which this Archbishop styled a Lible) was soon after
found in the Pulpit of Saint Michaels Church, and sent up to the Deanes own
hands; who made much stir at Gloucester, and the Court about it as appears by
these three Letters, sound in his Study by Master Prynne, and endorsed with his
own hand.

The first is a Letter sent by two of the Prehends to the Now Archbishop when
he was Deane of Gloucester, upon this occasion:

Right Worshipful;
OUr dutiful love remembered. We have heard somewhat within these two or three
days, and this day more certainly, of a certain Libell or scandalous writing
found in the Pulpit of Saint Michaells within the City of Gloucester upon the
14th of this instant February, about seven of the Clock in the morning; when
the Parish Clarke there did lay the Pulpit Cloth for Master Prior, who was then
to preach: this scandalous writing was taken up by John Wells Curate there, and
by Thomas Smith the Clarke, and by them read, and by their means divulged, so
that all in the City well near do new speak of it: The effect of the
writing was, as we learn, a dislike for the Removing of the Communion Table
within our Cathedral Church, affirming untruly, that it tended NOTE.
to the animating of the Papists, that it savoured of superstition, that it was
translated from a Communion Table to an High Altar, and that Worship and
obeisance were made unto it: The Libeller marveileth that it is suffered as now
it stands, and that there is not one Elias amongst us to reform it; Master
John Jones one of our Aldermen and Justice of Peace has examined some of them,
and they answer, that they are advised by their Counsel not to confess the
effect of that Libell; if they give not this day a better answer, he says his
purpose is to binds them ever to answer before the Judges at the next Assizes:
Master Jones his opinion is, that it is very fit that there be a Commission
speedily procured from His Majesty's High Commissioners for the examining of
this matter, and directed to some of the Clergy here, and to sense Justies
NOTE.
of Peace here, provided always that there be none such in that Commission (of
what degree or dignity so ever they be) that favor that schismatic faction
of the Puritans. But now we learn that this Libell was presently delivered by
the Curate or Clark unto our now Master Sub-Deane, and therefore we assure our
selves you are informed of it by him and Master Robinson, 5. or 6. days before
this day. If there be not a speedy course taken for the supressing of this
their malicious and scandalous dealing, it will in short time breed no small
inconvenience within this pl^^^, etc. Assuredly these zealous people are our
Precisians, the number whereof is great in this place. Thus being bold to
manifest unto you our love and duty (as we take it) in this behalf, We humbly
take our leave, with our prayers unto God for Your health and welfare, and rest,

Your Worships assuredly at Command, Henry Aisgill. Elias Wrench.
Gloucester Febr 21. 1616.

The second is a Letter writ by him on this occasion, to the Bishop of
Gloucester, to this effect.

My Lord,
MY love and service remembered unto your Lordship: when I came to do my duty
to his Majesty at Christmas, it seemed by the speech he uttered to me, that
some body had done the poor Church of Gloucester, no very good office. For his
Majesty was graciously pleased to tell me, He was informed, that there was
scarce ever a Church in England so ill governed, and so much out of order; And
withal required me in general, to reform and set in order what I there found
amiss. Hereupon at my being at Gloucester, I acquainted the Chapter with that
which his Majesty had said to me, and required at my hands: And took as good

edifice of the Church and for redress of other things amiss. Among the rest,
not rashly and of my self, but by a Chapter -Act, I removed the Communion
Table, from the middle of the Quier to the upper end, the place appointed to
it, both by the Injunctions of this Church, and by the practice of all the
Kings Majesty's Chappells, and This was then a gross untruth, for it then
stood not so in any Cathedralls.

since my coming thence (as I am by letters informed) is very much traduced by
some in the City; and a libell against it laid in the Pulpit of St. Michaells
where Master Subdeane preaches, to the great scandal of the Church and the
Laws established. Good my Lord, let me desire this favor in enquity at your
Lordships hands, that these things may be ordered, and that your Lordship will
join to reform such tongues and penns as know not how to submit to any Law

the entertainment which it has found among turbulent Spirits. And I presume
his Majesty will be well pleased to hear, that your Lordship as in other

Church. Thus not doubting but your Lordship will be careful to rectify what
is amiss, I for this time (being full of my business for Scotland) humbly
take my leave, and shall ever rest.

The third was a letter writ by him to the Bishop of Lincoln (Dr. Neale) his
great Patron, then at Court.

MY humble duty and service remembered unto your Lordship, etc. When I was at
London at Christmas to do my duty unto his Majesty, he was pleased very
graciously to tell me, that the Church of Gloucester (as his Majesty had been
informed) was more, or as much out of order as any Church in England, and to
require me to order such things as I there found amiss; upon this admonition
of his gracious Majesty to me, when I came to Gloucester, I passed with the
consent of the Chapter two Acts; One for the repair of the Edifice of the
Church, which is extremely decayed in the fairest places. The other for the
remove of the Communion Table, which stood almost in the midest of the Quier,
and I with the general consent of all the Prebends present, after the Act made

there has been a letter or Lybell found in a Pulpit of one of the Churches in
the City, against both me and that Act, in which the Author (as yet not known)
wonders that the Prebends would not resist me, and complains, that there was
in none of them the spirit of Elias, etc. To prevent further stir in the City,
some think it very fit that the High Commission would take some speedy order
about it, to send a NOTE.

Circumstances because they are many I will omit, and instead of them, I have

Copy of so much of a letter as concerns this business sent by Master Pryor,
now Sub-Deane, that so your Lordship may see the whole sum of the business. Upon
the receipt of these letters, I writ unto my Lord of Gloucester, but what
course for redress of these things his Lordship will take I know not. I
beseech your Lordship let me have your lawful assistance, that so long as I do
nothing but that which is established and practiced in our Church, I may not be
brought in contempt at my first entrace upon that place, by any turbulent

St. John's College, upon March 3. 1616.

So soon did this Prelate begin to introduce these Popish Innovations into our
Cathedralls only at first, against Law, to the great scandal of well affected
Protestants, and encouragment of Papists.

In the Years 1626: and 1627. Master John Cosens a great acquaintance and
Camrade of this Archbishops, set up a goodly stone Altar (rayled in Altarwise,
adorned with Pictures, Candlesticks, Tapers, Basins, Altarcloths having
superstitious Images upon them) instead of a Communion Table, and bowed
constantly to it; repaiting and erecting diverse unlawful Images (some of
Christ Himself) in that Cathedral; where the likewise introduced Copes and
Chalices (having Crucifixes and Pictures of the HOLY GHOST upon them,) together
with many other Popish trinkets, setting up a multitude of Candles and Tapers
in that Church on Candlemasseday, after the Popish manner. Against which
Innovations Master Peter Smart, (the ancientest Prebend of that Church)
preaching openly in the Cathedral, and then complaining in Parliament, Anno
1628. after the dissolution of that Parliament, by this Arch-Innovators means
(as appears by sundry Letters concerning this business between Dr. Coseus and
him found in the Archbishops Study) he was successively brought into the High
Commission Courts, both a Durham, Lambeth, and Luke, for vexation; and at last
there most unjustly deprived of all his Ecclesiastical livings, fined
imprisoned diverse years, and his livings conferred upon others by this
Arch-Prelates means, as his own Letters manifest. All which particulars
having been lately heard, proved by sundry depositions before the Commons and
Lords; and published in See Master Francis Rouse his printed Speech at the
Transmission of Master Smarts cause to the Lords.
Print to the World by Master Smart himself, in his Catalogue of Superstitious
Innovations brought into Durham Cathedral. London 1642. and in his Cantus
Epithalamicus) were only mentioned not insisted on, by the Commons; as were
his several Innovations in the Cathedral of Paul's whiles he was Bishop of
London as notoriously visible to most, as his very repairing of Paul's, at other
men's costs.

These Innovations in these 3. Cathedralls were introduced, somented by him,
before his advancement to the Archi-Episcopal Sea of Canterbury, after which
he became more bold and violent, enforcing them by new Injunctions, Statutes,
Oaths, upon all or most Cathedralls; of which the ensuing Instances were
produced, instead of many more.

No sooner was this active Prelate promoted to the Archbishop ricke of
Canterbury, but presently he began to pollute the Cathedral of Canterbury
with his popish Innovations in Canterbury Cathedral.
Innovations; First he caused an Altar to be there erected by the Deane and
Chapter, and much moneys to be expended by them upon Basins, Candlesticks,
Altar-Cloaths, and other furniture to adorn it, as appears by a Letter
written to him from the Deane and Chapter of Canterbury (found in his study by
Master Prynne) under their hand and Seal, dated the 4. July 1634. wherein
among other things they write thus:

5ly. We have obeyed Your Graces directions in pulling down the exorbitant
States within our Quire, whereby the Church is very much beautified. Lastly,
we most humbly beseech Your Grace to take notice, that many and most necessary
have been the occasions of extraordinary expenses this Year, FOR ORNAMENTS OF
THE ALTAR, etc.

Your Graces most humble SERVANTS, Isaue Bargrave, John Warner, Thomas Iackson,
Thomas Paske, Merry Cas^u^on, John Iefferay, Humfrey Peake, Thomas Blechonden,

Christ-Church Canterb: 8, July 1634.

After this new Altar was thus erected, and furnished, some of the Prebends and
other Officers belonging to this Church, had private instructions given them to
how unto it: but this not sufficing, that this Ceremony might be there
perpetually observed under pain of Perjury, in the Year 1634 the Archbishop
compiled New Statutes for the Government of that Cathedral, which were sent
thither under the Great Seal, with his own hand subscribed to every leaf,
wherein there was this Statute among others, which the Prebends, Chapter and
Officers there were bound by Oath to observe, that they should, SUMMA
REVERENTIA ADORARE DEUM VERSVS ALTAR: as was manifest by the Statutes
themselves; and attested upon Oath by Doctor Thomas Blechenden one of the
Prebends there, at the Lords Bar; who confessed he was sworn to observe all
the statutes of that Cathedral, and this among the rest; that himself used
this kind of Adoration, which he said was practiced there before these Statutes.

Doctor Thomas Jackson, the ancientest Prebend of this Cathedral, witnessed
upon Oath, viva Voce, That this Archbishop of Canterbury sent down Statutes to
their Cathedral, subscribed with his own hand, to the observation of which
they were all sworn; that by one of these Statutes they were enjoined to bow
unto the Altar at their coming in, and going out of the Quite, and approaches
to the Altar; the words were, that they should ADORARE VERSVS ALTAR: That this
bowing was there of late constantly practiced by the Prebends, among others by
himself; which he has left since better information, it being a great grief to
his soul, and giving much scandal; for which he was heartily sorrowful, and
desired God to forgive him; That these Statutes were made about seven years
since and that before this Archbishops time, there was no such bowing to the
Altar used in that Cathedral.

What a Glorious Altar-Cloth with other furniture was provided for this New
Altar of late times by Doctor Brayes (the Archbishops Chaplains) direction,
what Popish Images, Crucifixes, and Relics of Superstition, were lately
standing in Canterbury Cathedral, till demolished by Order of Parliament (not
given in evidence to husband time,) is at large related by Master Culmer, in
his Cathedral news from Canterbury; to which the Reader may repair for
satisfaction.

From Canterbury, we shall next hunt this Romish Fox to the Cathedral of
Winchester, where keeping a Visitation in the Year 1635. by Sir Nathaniell
Brent, his Innovations in Winchester Cathedral.,
Vicar General; he did by his Injunctions under Seal, enjoyne them to provide
four Copes, to Rail in the Communion Table, and place it Altarwise, to bow
unto it, and daily to read the Epistles and Gospells at it: This was attested
by Sir Nathaniell Brent himself; manifested by his own Injunctions to that
Church, and by his Articles proposed to the College of Winchester, produced
and read in the Lords House.

The Injunctions were these, Iniunctiones in Visitatione Metropolitica

In this Cathedral these Injunctions were not only obeyed, Copes provided, an
Altar with all Popish furniture erected, bowed to, and second service read
thereat, but likewise a large naked Crucifixe set up over it, to the great
scandal of many, by Doctor Lewis Master of Saint Cross, and a Prebend there,
the Arch-Prelates Minion and Creature. The like was done at the Cathedral at
Litchfield, where a very large Crucifixe, with a Picture of Christ on it almost
as big as a Giant, was hanged Innovations in Litchfield Cathedral.
over the High-Altar, with the Pictures of men and women kneeling down before
it and praying to it: attested by Master Prynne, for speaking and writing
against which most scandalous Idol, the Lady Davis was committed to prison
diverse year, and ordered to be sent to Bedlam.

In 12. Caroli new Statutes made by the Archbishop of Canterbury subscribed
with his own hand in every page, were sent down by him under the Kings broad
seal, Innovations at Hereford.
to the Cathedral Church at Hereford to be there sworn to and observed, which
enjoined these following Ceremonies, not required by the old Statutes, nor
there practiced till the receiving of these new ones and then strictly put in
use.

1. Every Residentiary is bound to officiate twice every year himself under
the pain of paying 40s. to be laid out upon the Ornaments of the Church: Cap.
7. qui vero.

2. That they shall officiate on Sundays and Holidays in their Copes Cap.
eodem praecipue.

3. That they are to stand no at the Creeds, and the Gospel, and doxologies,
and to bow so as often as the name of Jesus is mentioned, and that no man be
covered in the Church, cap. eodem, Litania.

4. That every one is to bow versus Altar, Cap. eodem, singuli vero.

5. Prayer before Sermons enjoined according to the 55th. Can. Cap. 9. Huic
autem.

The like Statutes were sent to most other Cathedralls, and put in practice
with all diligence by this Archbishops means.

What Innovations were made in the Cathedral Church of Worcester, and by whom,
will appear by this account of Doctor Manwaring, Dean thereof, under his hand,
given to the Archbishop, of the alterations there made, endorsed with the
Archbishops own hand thus, Recepi September 24. 1635. Concerning the Church
of Worcester; from Doctor Manwaring Deane there; and his SERVICES done there,
(found in his study, and attested by Master Prynne.)

1635. An account given of what service the Deane of Worcester, did at his
Majesty's Cathedral there, what time he first came thither, in NOVEMBER last,

1. AN Altar-stone of Marbell erected and set upon four Columns. NOTE.


2. The wall behind the Altar covered with Azure colored stuff with a white
silk lace down each seame.

3. The Altar it self adorned with a pall, an upper, and lower front.

5. A perfect Inventory taken of all Ornaments, Vestments and implements of the
Church, as well sacra, as focalia.

Diverse vestments and other Ornaments of the Church, as Copes, Carpets, and
fronts, NOTE.
being turned into Players Capps, Coats, and employed to that use by the
direction of Mr. Nath. Tompkins, I caused to be burned, and the Silver
extrasted put into the Treasury of the Church.

14. The Kings Scholars being 40. usually coming tumultuously into the Chore,
ordered NOTE.
to come in bimatim, and to do reverence toward the Altar.

Moreover the Archbishop in his Injunctions to the Dean and Chapter of the
Cathedral Church of Chicester, made in his Metropoliticall Visitation there,
An. 1635. orders thus in his 6. Injunction; Item, That you provide Copes
fitting for the service of your Cathedral, by one a year, until you be
sufficiently furnished with them, as was proved by the Injunctions found in his
own Study, attested by Mr. Prynne, an Altar with all its furniture and
adorations toward it, being there likewise provided and used.

The like Innovations were introduced and prescribed by his Injunctions, and
new statutes in all or most Cathedralls in England and Wales, to the great
rejoicing of the Popish Party, and scandal of all true zealous Protestants,
and any default in them was reputed a crime presentable, as appeared by this
Passage of an Abstract of the Abuses in the Diocese of Lincoln, 1634. in my
Metropoliticall visitation, endorsed with the Archbishops hand and found in his
study. Lincoln August 9. 1634. The Communion Table is not very decent, and the
Rail before it is worse: the Organs old and naught, The Copes and Vestments
are embeselled, and none remain, etc. And in another Abstract concerning his
Metropoliticall Visitation in other Diocesses, and particulars concerning the
same, indorsed likewise with his own hand, there are these passages. Norwich,
the hangings of the Quire are naught, the Copes are fair, but want mending. In
the Cathedral as Worcester they have no Copes, but are ordered to buy some
before the feast of the Annuntiation. In the Cathedral at Gloucester many
things amiss. No Copes etc. in Winchester Cathedral they have no Copes: some
do not bow when they come into the Quire, nor at the blessed name of Jesus.
Litchfield, the furniture of the Altar etc. very mean; Therefore care must be
taken for more costly furniture.

Whence this Archbishop took his Commission and president for adorning our
Cathedral and Collegeat Churches thus above others with these Romish
Ornaments, and superstitious Innovations, which in truth defiled them, is
worthy our special observation, it being in taken from the very Roman
Ceremonial set forth and reformed by the Command of Pope Clement the 8. lib.
1. cap. 12. De ornatu Ecclesiae, p. 64. which prescribes thus: Sic MAJOR ETIAM
^VRA adhibenda erit IN ORNATV ECCLESIAE CATHEDRALJS, AVT COLLEGJATAE, quae and
numerosum clerum habeat, and supellectilem amplam, que congrue situata, and
suis partibus apt distincta COMMODJOREM ORNANDI PRAE^EAT FACVLTATEM: after
which it prescribes Altars, Altar-clothes, Candlestickes, Tapers, Crucifixes,
Jmages, Copes, Rich hangings for the Altar and Quire, with Jmages of Christ,
our Lady, and Saints; bowing to the Altar and Crucifix; and that all Altars
should have at least two Candlestickes with Tapers, and a Cross of Silver, or
of some other metal placed on the midst of the Altar, with the Image of
Christ crucified on it, as you may there read at large.

This Arch Prelate not content to propagate these Innovations in England, like
an Universal Patriarch over all his Majesty's Realms endeavored the
introducing of them with an high hand into all the Cathedralls, Churches and
Chappells in Ireland, by the then Lord Deputy Wentworthes power, (his great
Creature) of which we shall give you this brief account.

Dr. Bramhall Chaplain to this Lord Deputy, by his Command, August 10. 1633.
sent over an Account of the state of the Church of Jreland to this Prelate, as
he found it, and what Alterations he had already made in it (seized in the
Archbishops study by Mr. Prynne) wherein are these observable clauses.

RIght Reverend Father,
My most honored Lord, presuming partly upon your license, but especially
directed by my Lord Deputies commandes, I am to give your Father-hood a brief
account of the present state of the poor Church of Ireland, such as our short
Intelligence here, and your Lordship: weightier employments there will permit,
etc. In Christ Church, the principal Church in Ireland, withor the Lord Deputy
and Council repair every Sunday, the Table used for administration of the
blessed Sacrament in the MIDST OF THE QVIRE, is made an ordinary seat for
Maidons, and Apprentices. J cannot omit the glorious Tomb in the other
Cathedral Church NOTE.
of saint Patrike in the proper place of the Altar, just opposite to his
Majesty's seat, having his Fathers name subscribed upon it, as if it were
contrived on purpose to gain that worship and reverence which the Chapter and
whole Church are bound by special statute to give toward the East, and either
the soil it self, or a License to build, and bury, NOTE.
and make a Vault, in the place of the Altar, under Sealetant, which is
tantamount, is passed to the Earl and his heirs (Credimus esse Deos.) This
being the case in Dublin, your Lordship will Judge what we may expect in the
Country.

The Earl of Cork holds the whole Bishopric of Lismore, at the Rate of
forty shillings or five marks by the year.

For the remedying of these evils, next to God and his sacred Majesty, I know
my Lord depends upon your Fatherhoods wisdom and zeal for the Church; my duty
binds me to pray for a blessing upon both your good endeavors: for the
present, my Lord has pulled down the Deputies seat in his own Chapel, and
restored the Altar (...) ancient place, NOTE.
which was thrust out of doors, the like is done in Christ's Church.

This testimony I must give of his care, that it is not possible for the
intentions of a mortal man, to be more serious and sincere then his, in those
things that concern the good of this poor Church.

Your Lordships* daily ^^^dsman and devoted servant. John Bramhall.
Dublin Castle, Aug. 10. 1643. NOTE.


Upon this Information, the Archbishop signified his dislike of erecting this
Monument by the Earl of Cork, in the place where the High Altar (as was
misinformed) anciently stood, and gave some directions for removing it:
Whereupon the Earl of Corks, and Archbishop of Dublin writ these ensuing
Letters to satisfy his Grace in this particular, (which were seconded with
other Letters from Archbishop Usher, and the Deane and Prebends of Saint
Patrickes Church, to like effect, overtedious to recite.)

My Gracious Lord.
I Understand that upon suggestions made unto your Grace, you conceive that a
Tomb which I have lately caused to be erected in Saint Patrickes Church near
Dublin, is prejuditiall to the lights of the Chancell, and seated in the place
where the NOTE.
High Altar stood; And as I have always by my best desires and actions
endeavored to invest my self in your Graces good opinion, and have not
willingly done any act that might prejudice me therein; So in this particular I
make humbly bold to deliver my justification to your Grace as follows, which
I beseech you take into your Religious consideration, and vouchsafe me such a
favorable resolution, as the meritts of the cause requires.

It is so that Doctor Robert Weston, sometimes one of the Lords Justices for
the Government of Ireland, and Lord Chancellor of the same Realm, Grandfather
to my deceased Wife, and great Uncle to the now Lord Treasurer of England,
whose memory yet lives by being styled the good Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was
buried in the upper end of the Chancell in Saint Patrickes Church, whose
Daughter Sir Iefferey Fenton married, he having been principal Secretary of
State to Queen Elizabeth and King James for many years, and lived and died in
great honor, whose only Daughter I took to Wife, and he was buried in the
same grave; My Wife drawing toward her end, made her last request unto me,
that her Grandfather, her Father, and her self might be buried together, and
that I would be at the charge to erect some Monument in memorial of them all;
Whereupon in accomplishment of her dying desire, who was the Mother of my
fifteen Children, I propounded unto the Lord Archbishop of Dublin, and to the
Deane and Chapter of Saint Patricks, to purchase a place where I might erect a
Tomb over them, And they assigned me the ground under an Arch to make a Seller
or Vault in, to receive dead bodies, and three foot of the Chancell adjoining
to the Grave where the Lord Chancellor, and Sir Iefferey Fenton had been
buried, for which I paid them a Fine, with Rent and other reservations toward
the reparation of the Church, and by their unanimous consent have a Deed in due
form of Law, perfected under their Chapter Seal, and so being by general
consent legally interested therein, I made a Vault of hewed stone under ground,
with conveighances therein, to free the Church from the waters, with which
floods, and great raynes it was before often anoyed withal, and where there
was then but an earthen flower at the upper end of the Chancell, which was
often overflowne, I raised the same three steps higher, making the Stairs of
hewn stone, and paving the same through out of the same, whereon the Communion
Table now stands very dry and gracefully. In that Seller I have placed the
Corpse of my Wives Grandfather, her Father, and her self with a Daughter of
mine since deceased, that was married to the Lord Digbie, and over the Vault I
have caused a Tomb of four stories to be erected, which reaches two and
thirty foot from the ground, which has cost me a thousand pounds at the
least, and is the greatest ornament and beauty to that Church that ever was
placed therein, that being seated under an Arch, that in former time was only a
passage into the Saint Mary Chapel, at the East end of which Chapel the
high Altar stood; and when that Chapel (which has two other ways into it,
the one on the right hand, the other on the left) fell into ruin, that Arch
wherein the Tomb is placed to keep the wind and weather out of the Chancell,
was made up with slight timber and lathes, and plaistred with Clay white lymed
over, whereon the Commandments were lately written. It is three years since
this my work was finished, and neither during the time of the work, nor
since, till now of late, did I ever hear of any mouth opened against it, but
many in commendations of it, as a great beauty and ornament to that Chancell,
neither does it take away, or hide any of the lights of the Chancell, for they
are all above this Fabric, Neither is there any remembrance, nor can the
oldest man living say, that there ever was any Altar placed near this passage:
Yet of late it has pleased my honorable Lord, the Lord Deputy, to command me
to give Your Grace satisfaction herein, or else to declare, that the Tomb must
be defaced, which to have done, would be the greatest dishonor and affliction
that could be laid upon me. And the more, for that before I heard any thing
of Your Graces distant thereof. I had in the presence of the Lord Prymate,
given order to the Deane at my own charges for a stately Skrene to be erected
within the Quire, and upon the pavement raised by my self, upon which the
ten Commandments are to be engraven, to the great beautifying of Gods
House; Upon that notice from the Lord Deputy, I made suite to the Lord Prymate,
and the Lord Archbishop of Dublin to view the place, which they vouchsafed
together with the Deane and Chapter to do. And do humbly offer to your Grace
their opinions herein, which I beseech Your pious consideration of, and that
you will be pleased to return me such an answer, as may encourage me to
proceed herein, and in other like building and charitable works, wherein I
spend a great part of my estate and time, as all that know me and my actions,
^an testify. The great God of Heaven bless Your Grace with a long and happy
life in this world, and everlasting glory in the world to come, which is, and
ever shall be the prayer of

Your Graces most humble and faithful Servant, R. Ca^he.
Dublin 20. Febr. 1633.

May is please Your Grace;
Understanding from the Earl of Cork, that Your Grace has intimated unto the
Right Honorable the Lord Deputy your offense taken against a Tomb, lately
built by his Lordship in the quire of Saint Patrikes Church near this City
NOTE.
of Dublin, being informed that it should be situate in the place, where the
High-Altar anciently stood, and that it should darken the East Window of the
Quire: upon his Lordships earnest request unto me, I have made bold to declare
unto your Grace my knowledge thereabouts: which is, that the place where the
Tomb is erected, is a spacious Arch, which in former times, as I conceive,
served for a passage into the Marie Chapel adjoining, at the East end
whereof the High Altar stood. This Arch was closed up and plastered, to keep
the wind, as I imagine, out of the Quire, Saint Marie Chapel being somevvhat
decayed: upon the plaistering the Declalogue was fairly painted: these were
done before my promotion to this See, or coming into this Kingdom. The
windovves, which were of old somevvhat high over the Arch, are no way darkened
by his Lordships monument, but remain as they were formerly; and the monument
is so wrought and contrived what in the Arch and the Wall, that with the grate
before it, it does not much diminish the length of the Quire. The Earl has
raised that end of the Quire three-steppes higher then it was, and has paved
it with fair hevven stones, being formerly a floor of earth, many times upon
a fresh drowned with water, where now the Communion Table i^ placed with
more decency then in former times: And his Lordship is in hand to set up a
fair skrine of timber, somewhat distant from the monument, so that it may take
in some other monuments heretofore erected on either side in the which skrine
the Decalogue shall befairely painted, and the Communion Table shall be placed
close to the same, more decently then it has been: which being performed, the
Quire will be much beautified, and the celebration of divine service for sight
and audience better accommodated then heretofore: That Quire, (to omit the
example of Christ-Church, the other Cathedral Church in this City, and of
Saint Paul,in London, if I be not mistaken) representing in a lesser model
the pattern of Westminster Abbey, where there is a skrine enclosing some
monuments, and a way on each hand to the Chapel adjoying. Your Grace may be
pleased also to understand, that the Earl obtained License to erect his
Monument in that place by the unanimous consent of the Deane and Chapter of
that Church; and that they are Honorable personages whose memory is preserved
in that monument, the one being Lord Justice, and Lord Chancellor of this
Kingdom, the other principal Secretary of State, both Ancestors to his most
pious and Virtuous Lady lately deceased. And finally, Your Grace is entreated
to take Your consideration the meritts of this Noble Earl, his zeal for the
advancement of true Religion, declared by his suppressing foreign
jurisdictions and presumptions, by building of Churches in several places, and
erecting Schoole-houses, and Almeshouses at his own charge, besides his
public works for the Commonwealth, raising structures of great strength and
expense in places of importance, and planting of English Colonyes, to the great
security and settlement of Peace and civility within those parts; all which
considered he may be justly deemed worthy of Honorable memory in the Church.
Thus much, by opening the truth, I have written at the Earls request, who is
exceeding desirous to purge himself to Your Grace from giving any scandal to
the Church, whereupon he hops to gain Your Graces approbation of his
blameless carriage, which I also humbly beseech on his behalf, ever remaining,

To do Your Grace Service La: Dubline.

To which Letter of the Archbishop of Dublin, this Arch-Prelate returned this
waspish insolent answer, writ with Master Dells, but endorsed with his own
hand, found in his Study with the former Originalls, in the very beginning
whereof you may discern his most palpable dissimulation and falsehood.

S. in Christo:
My very good Lord;
IT is most true, that I have taken offense at a Tomb erected by the Earl of
Cork, in the Cathedral of Saint Patrick, but I did not take that Offense A
notorious untruth of an Arch-Prelate.
lately only, but before ever my Lord Deputy that now is, was named to the
place, And I took that offense by a complaint thence sent unto me (for I was
never there) though I cannot recall who it was that complaind. And I am sure
the complaint came then unto me with a full cry, that it was built in the
place where the High-Altar first NOTE.
stood, and the Communion Table afterward.

Your Lordship at the Earls entreaty has signified to me your knowledge (for
so you say) that the Tomb stands in a great Arch at the end of the Quire,
which was plaistered up to keep out the Wind, and that the High Altar stood
at the end of the Lady Mary's Chapel, which is beyond it, and that the East
Window is at the top of the Arch, and not darkened. My Lord it will be hard for
me to speak any thing contrary to Your Lordship, who has been so often upon
that place where I never was; yet I shall deal freely, and tell Your Lordship
what I think.

And first my Lord, I am satisfied that the Tomb darkens none of the
East-Window. But I am no way satisfied that the Altar stood at the upper end of
the Lady Mary's Chapel. That an Altar stood there I easily grant, for in
those times, there were NOTE.
diverse Altars in one Cathedral, and every by Chapel had one at least. But
that the High-Altar did ever stand in any Cathedral in other place then the
East end of the Quire, is quite out of my knowledge, nor did I ever hear it
till now by Your Lordships Letters.

That the place before the Arch was an earthen Floor, and often troubled with
a fresh, I do again really believe Your Lordship. And the Earl has done
very well to raise it, and pave it with stone. But that the swelling of the
Tomb: The Iron Grate before it: The taking in of some ancient Monuments on
either side: The erecting of a Skrine, before which you say the Communion Table
should stand, would take off little or no Room from the Quire; that I must
confess, I do not very well understand.

Your Lordship adds, that when the Skrine is built, and the Communion Table
placed before it, it will much beautify the Quire, and be like other
Cathedralls. To that I can say nothing, but must leave it to their eyesight
and judgment that are upon the place. And whereas Your Lordship says that my
Lord had leave of the Deane and Chapter, with their unanimous consent to erect
a Monument in that place, if the place be fit for a Monument; the consent was
very well asked, and given. But if it appear the place were inconvenient, then
my Lord of Cork did not very well to ask a consent, and the Deane and Chapter
did very ill to grant it; and the more unanimous the consent was, the worse.
And whereas you write that there are other Honorable Personages whose memory
is preserved in that Monument; to that I say, if the Monument stand where it
ought, God forbid it should be touched. If it stand where it ought not, it may
be fairly and decently removed, and set up in some convenient place upon the
side of the Quire, or elsewhere, where it will as well preserve the memory of
those Honorable Personages which you mention, as now it does, And God forbid
any violence should be offered to that, in any kind.

And last of all, whereas Your Lordship desires I should take into
consideration the merits of that Noble Earl, I am very willing to do that,
And first I am very glad to hear from Your Lordship his zeal for the
advancement of true Religion: but I may not conceal from Your Lordship, that I
have likewise heard from others and that some years since, that he has
gotten into his hands no small proportion of the Churches means. And if that
be so, any man may see his end in advancing true Religion, But such a Zeal
that poor Church has little need of, and God bless every part of the Church
from it. As for his Lordships building of Churches, Schools, and Hospitalls, I
know nothing of that, and can say as little to it. Only this I can say, that if
he take from the Church in one place, to build Church, School, or Hospital in
another, it is no zeal, nor the way which Christian bounty uses to tread. And if
his Lordship has done any Public work for strength and fortification to the
Kingdom, I pray God that be not done with the Churches money too. But
howsoever his Lordship has get a very full estate in that Kingdom and he
does very wisely to fortify it as well as he can. But besides these I have
long since heard, though you now mention it not, that his Lordship has done
greater service to the Church in some other particulars; as namely to the
Bishopric of Lismore, and the College of Yong-Hall, for which it is great
pity, but that his Lordships memory, should be preserved in the Church.

Thus I have given Your Grace a distinct answer to all the Particulars in Your
Letter. But for the Tomb which occasioned all the rest, I will not take upon
me to judge (unless I were upon the place) how fitly, or unfitly it stands
there, but shall wholly leave it to the view, and resolution which shall
thereupon be taken in that place. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest,

Your Lordships very loving friend and Brother. Will: Cant.
Lamb. March. 1633.

But some may perchance inquire, what was the ground of this Archbishops
introduction of these Innovations first of all into Cathedral Churches?
Certainly one principal cause of this his method was to make these Mother
Churches (as he styled them) patterns of imitation for all Daughter Churches
and Chapells within the the whole Diocese, that so the Proverb in Ezech. 16.
v. 44. 45. might be verified of them: Behold every one tht uses Proverbes,
shall use this Proverb against thee, saying, AS IS THE MOTHER, SO IS HER
DAVGHTER: Thou art thy Mothers Daughter.

That this was one chief end of his, to corrupt all Parish Churches and
Chappells by these Cathedralls examples; was infallibly manifested; First by
the very words of the Order, made at the Council Table at White Hall the third
of November, 1633 concerning the standing of the Communion Table in Saint
Gregory's Church near Paul's, printed in Dr. Heylins, Coal from the Altar,
and in his Antidotum Lincolniense. Sect. 1. c. 2. p. 62. (which order was thus
printed by the Archbishops direction, the chief stickler in the procuring and
prime Clerk in the penning of it;) wherein it is positively resolved; That all
other Churches ought to be guided by the Cathedral Mother Church, whereon they
depend, and that the Communion Table in Saint Gregory's Church, removed from
the middle of the Chancell to the upper end, and there placed Altar-wise, in
such manner as it stands in the Cathedral and Mother Church of St. Paul,
should so continue, that so there might be no difference between it and the
said Cathedral Mother Church. Secondly, by diverse books published in print
by the Archbishops special direction and app obation, expressly averring
Doctor Heylyns Antidotum Lincolniense: page 37. 39. 65. etc. his Coal from the
Altar, p. 26 27. with Pocklington, Dow, Reeve, Shelford, Bishop Pierce and
others.

Innovations in Parish Churches and Chappells.

The case of St. Gregory's Church.


That all Parochial Churches ought to be guided by the pattern of the Mother
Church, upon the which they do depend: The Archbishop himself in his
discourses, and these creatures of his in their Books, applying and urging
this leaden rule of theirs in particular, for the railing in of Communion
Tables, placing them Altarwise against the East end of the Quire, and bowing
unto them, in all Parish Churches because this was done and practiced in all
Cathedral Churches, by virtue of his New Statutes and Injunctions, though not
in former times.

This foundation being laid in our Cathedralls, for the like Popish
Innovations, in all Parochial Churches, we shall in the next place prosecute
this pursuit of his Innovations, from our Cathedralls to Parochial Churches
and Chappells. We shall begin with Saint Gregory's Church near Paul's; where
the case was thus.

About ten years since, this Church was repaired by the Parishoners to their
great cost, at which time the Deane and Chapter of Paul's under whose
jurisdiction it is caused the Picture of Saint Gregory to be set up in the
Church, and the Communion Table to be removed, rayled about and set Altarwise
against the East End of the Chancell, Whereupon Master Wyan, and diverse of the
Parishioners being offended at it, appealed from the Deans and Chapters Order,
as being against Law, to the Arches; upon which by the Archbishops means, an
Order came from Secretary Windebank, to call the Parishioners to the Council
Table concernning this Appeal and the removing of the Table; where they
appeared at the appointed time with their Council: The King himself, the
Archbishop and many of the Lords were then present, where the business being
debated before them, the Archbishop stood up, and with great earnestness (more
like an Advocate then Judge) justified, maintained this removing and railing in
the Table, reading Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions to warrant it; but left out
this most material clause, NOTE.
that made quite against him: Saving when the Communion of the Sacrament is to
be administered: at which time the same shall be so placed in good sort within
the Chancell as whereby the Minister may be more conveniently heard of the
Communicants, in his prayer and ministration, and the Communicants also more
conveniently, and in greater number communicate with the said Minister, And
after the Communion done, from time to time, the said holy Table to be placed
where it stood before, The King said, he liked it well, that the Table should
stand as it used to do heretofore: to which the Archbishop answered, that if it
stood so, the Minister could not so well see who kneeled at the Sacrament, and
who kneeled not: To which the King replied, then let the seats be pulled
down, Then the Council for the Parish alleged, that Bishop Jewel in his
Reply to Harding, Artic. 3. Diuis. 26. and Artic. 13. Diuis. 6. and Master John
Fox in his Acts and Monuments, Edit. 1610. page 1211. 1212. (both which Books
were enjoined to be kept in every Church for the people to read in as
containing the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England, and naught
repugnant thereunto) maintained and asserted, That the Communion Table ought to
stand in the MIDST OF THE CHVRCH AMONG THE PEOPLE, and not Altar-wise against
the wall. Hereupon the Archbishop stood up in an angry manner, and said, If
this be the use they make of these Books Jewel and Fox, I desire they may be
taken out of Churches; and Sir Henry Martin saying merrily, that this Table
NOTE.
placed close along the wall, would make a good Court-cupboord: The Archbishop
thereupon replied, that Sir Henry was a stigmaticall Puritan in his bosom. All
which particulars were proved upon oath by Master Wyan, Mr. Clearke, and
Captain Stackhouse. Whereupon by the Archbishops violence this Order was then
made against the Parishioners for the standing of that Table Altar-wise, as it
was situated by the Deanes and Chapters Order and appointment.

At Whitehall the third day of November: 1633.
Present, the KINGS most Excellent Majesty. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury,
Lord Keeper, Lord Archbishop of York, Lord Treasurer, Lord Privy Seal, Lord
Duke of Lenox, Lord Chamberlain, Earl of Bridgwater, Earl of Carlisle, Lord
Cottington, Master Treasurer, Master Comptroller, Lord High Chamberlain, Earl
Marshall, Master Secretary Cook, Master Secretary Windebanke.


THis Day was Debated before His Majesty sitting in Council, the question and
difference which grew about the removing of the Communion Table in St.
Gregory's Church, near the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, from the middle NOTE.
of the Chancell to the upper end, and there placed Altar-wise, in such manner
as it stands in the said Cathedral and Mother Church (as also in all other
Cathedralls, and in His Majesty's own Chapel) and as it is consonant to the
practice of approved Antiquity: which removal and placing of it in that sort,
was done by order from the Deane and Chapter of St. Paul's, who are Ordinaries
thereof, as was avowed before His Majesty by Doctor King, and Doctor Montfort,
two of the Prebends there; yet some few of the Parishioners, being but five in
number, did complain of this Act, by Appeal to the Court of Arches,
pretending, that the Book of Common Prayer, and the 82 Canon, do give
permission to place the Communion Table where it may stand with most fitness
and couveniencie. Now His Majesty having heard a particular Relation made by
the Counsel of both parties, of all the carriage and proceedings in this
Cause, was pleased to declare His dislike of all Innovation and receding NOTE.
from ancient Constitutions, grounded upon just and warrantable Reasons,
especially in matters concerning Ecclesiastical order and Government, knowing
how easily men are drawn to affect Novelties, and how soon weak judgments in
such cases may be overtaken and abused. And He was also pleased to observe,
that if these few Parishioners might have their wills, the difference thereby
from the foresaid Cathedral Mother Church, by which all other Churches
depending thereon, ought to be guided, would be the more notorious, and give
more subject of Discourse and Disputes NOTE.
that might be spared, by reason of S. Gregory's standing close to the wall
thereof. And likewise for so much as concerns the liberty given by the said
Communion Book or Canon, for placing the Communion Table in any Church or
Chapel with most convenience; that liberty is not so to be understood, as if
it were ever left to the discretion of the Parish, much less to the particular
fancy of any humorous Person, but to the Judgment of the Ordinary to whose
place and function it does properly belong to give direction in that point,
both for the thing it self, and for the time, when and how long, as he may
find cause. Upon which consideration his Majesty deciared himself, That he
well approved and confirmed the Act, of the said Ordinary, and also gave
Command that if those few Perishioners before mentioned, do proceed in their
said Appeal, then the Deane of the Arches (who was then attending at the
hearing of the cause) shall confirm the said Order of the aforesaid Deane and
Chapter.

This Order being thus obtained, and afterward published in Print by Doctor
Heylyn in his Coal from the Altar, and Antidotum Lincolniense; the design of
removing, railing in and turning Communion Tables into Altars in Parcohiall
Churches, Chappells, was much promoted by coulor of it, and of the reason of
conformity to Cathedral Mother Churches expressed in it: And to hasten this
work the more (to which the people and Churchwardens in many places were very
averse) the Archbishop being to keep a Metropoliticall Visitation in all
Diocesses and places exempt, and not exempt with in the Province of Canterbury,
by Sir Nathaniell Brent his Vicar General and others his Commissioners, though
he made no mention in his printed Visitation Articles of removing and railing
in Communion Tables Altar wise, to avoid the peoples clamours against him, yet
he writ a private Letter to Sir Nathaniell Brent after his departure hence, to
enjoyne him to remove and rail in the Communion Tables in all Parish Churches,
and gave him order to see it executed. With which practice the Archbishop being
charged at the Lords Bar by Sergeant Wild, who managed this part of the
evidence; he peremptorily denied it, and protested solemnly before the Lords,
that he never gave Sir Nathaniell Brent any such order or directions by letter
or otherwise; and that he could prove by sufficient testimonies, Sir Nathaniell
had openly acknowledged, that this Alteration was made by Sir Nath. himself of
his own head, without any order from him; adding that he cold not be so
unworthy as to deny it. Whereupon he desired Sir Nath. might be called to
testify the truth upon his Oath: who appearing at the Lords Bar for this
purpose, the Archbishop demanded of him; whether ever he gave him any command
or direction, by word or writing in his Metropoliticall Visitation, to remove
or rail in Communion Tables at the East end of the Chauncell, telling him, he
was now upon his Oath, and wishing him to speak nothing but the truth herein:
whereunto Sir Nathaniell answered: My Lords upon the Oath I have taken, I
received an express direction and command from the Archbishop himself to do
what ever I did in this or any other kind, else I durst not have don it; To
which the Archbishop confidently replied; My Lords, I protest I never gave him
any such command or directions, and I wonder Sir Nathaniell dares be so bold
and unworthy as to affirm it here upon Oath since I can prove he has formerly
denied it: To which Sir Nathaniell replied: My Lords, since the Archbishop so
confidently denies that he ever gave me any such command and directions, I
shall humbly desire that this Letter of his sent unto me when I was visiting at
Maidstonin Kent, signed with his own hand, may be read; which will end the
controversy, and manifest by whose Authority and command I did it; whereupon a
Letter under the Arch Bishops own hand, directed to Sir Nathaniell was
delivered to the Clarke and openly read, to the Archbishops great shame, and
disparagment of all his Protestations, which after this (and some other
passages wherein he was taken tripping in like manner) were reputed mere
vaporing impostures, to delude the vulgar, void of truth and credit. The Letter
was to this effect. Sir, I require you to command the Communion Table at
Maidston to be placed at the East or upper end of the Chauncell, and there
railed in, and that the Communicants there shall come up to the Rail, to
receive the blessed Sacrament, and the like you are required to do in all
Churches, in all other placse where you are to visit Metropolitically, etc. W.
Cant.

This letter being read, much daunted, discredited the Archbishop in the
opinion of all the Auditors, he having nothing to reply, but that he had
forgotten he writ him any such letter. Upon the receipt whereof Sir Nathaniell
Brent confessed he did give order throughout his Metropoliticall Visitation,
that all the Communion Tables should be removed, and railed in at the upper end
of the Chauncell in all Parish Churches, and all seats above the Table, or
equal with it in any Chancell pulled down, and that the Communicants should
go up to the Rail and there receive the Sacrament kneeling; which he pressed
as spatingly as he might, it being against his own judgment; and thereupon
obedience was yielded in most places, and such as refused to Rail in their
Tables, were questioned and proceeded against by others, but as for himself he
never troubled any for it.

That the Archbishop himself gave both command and approbation for these
Innovations, was proved by this ensuing Petition, to which an Answer was
underwriten by Master Dell, subscribed with the Archbishops own hand, found
among Sir John Lambs sequested Papers, by Master Prynne.

To the right Reverend Father in God William Lord Archbishop of Cant. his
Grace, Primate of all England and Metropolitan.
The Petition of Philip Davies Clerk, Hunry Demery, and Abrah am Cobb,
Churchwardens of the Parish Church of Hill, alias Hull, in the Dioces of
Gloucester.
Humbly shows,
THat your Petitioners in obedience to your Graces special directions in your
Graces Metropolitan Visitation, did take care and order for the raising of the
Chancell NOTE.
and Railing in the High Altar or Communion Table in the said Church, for the
doing of which with the necessary beautifying of the said Church, there were
diverse rates made by the Churchwardens for the time being and major part of the
Inhabitants of that Church for to defray the Charge thereof. In which
assesements one Henry Heathfield who was, and is commonly reputed and taken to
be of that Parish, was rated after the usual manner as he and his Predecessors
had always been, his diverse rates amounting to 28. shillings six pence. To
avoid the payment of which the said. Henry Heathfield appealed to your Graces
Court of the Arches, where the cause has depended for these eleven Months
last past, to your Petitioners great Charge and hinderance.

May it therefore please your Grace (for the better encouragement of your
Petitioners in performing your Graces Commands, which we have hitherto done in
preserving the decency and ornaments of the said Church as much as in us lies)
to give order, that the said Cause may be speedily determined, and that your
Petitioners may not be unnecessarily vexed and molested for endeavoring to
perform what in your Graces Visitation was publicly enjoined, but so far as
truth shall appears, we may shroud our selves under your Graces Protection.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.

I desire Sir John Lamb, in case he find the Suggestions true, to take care
that this Cause may come to hearing with all convenient speed possible.

Febr. 9. 1637. W. CANT.

By answering of which Petition, the Archbishop acknowledges, that the railing
in of Communion Tables, and imposing illegal Rates for the same, was done by
HIS GRACES SPECIAL DIRECTION in his Metropoliticall Visitation; and thereupon
he thus desired Sir John Lamb, to expedite the hearing of the Cause; yet he
had so Little Grace as openly to deny it with solemn protestations: The
falsity whereof was further evidenced by this Copy of Injunctions given in his
Metropoliticall Visitation to the Cathedral Church of Winchester, 19. July An.
1635. by Sir Nathaniell Brent his Vicar General; found in his own Study at
Lambheth, (so as he could not be ignorant of them) and attested by Master
Prynne; the last whereof was this. Deinde Dominus injuaxit Gardianis Ecclesiae
parochialis sancti Mauritij infra Civitatem Wintoniae, quod duo sedilia ex
utraque part Cancellorum ibidem removeantur; and quod nullum sedile ibidem
collocatur aut erigatur. Distuque Dominus ad Petitionem Willielmi Newton, unius
Parochianorum praefatae Ecclesiae Parochialis decrevit Mensam sacram
Eucharistiae decenter circum-sepiendam, viz. TO BE RAYLED ABOUT IN DECENT
MANNER, citra festum Omnium Sanctorum proxime sequens.

Moreover, A paper of Informations of diverse Abuses in the City and Diocese of
London, was found in the Archbishops Study, attested by Master Prynne, whereof
this was one. There are many Communion Tables in several Churches of the City
of London that are not rayled in, and some of them are placed in the middle of
the Church, when as they may be placed more conveniently at the East end
thereof. At the Chapel at Highgate, the Boys use to lean on the Communion
Table in the time of Divine service: under which Mr. Dell the Archbishops
Secretary Writ this direction to Sir Nathaniel Brent, his Visiter, subscribed
with the Archbishops own hand.

I require you that (besides my other Instructions) you give me an account of
all particulars within named. Whereupon an Account was given to him in writing
accordingly, thus entitled. An Account of the Metropoliticall Visitation of
the Diocese of London, Aano. 1636. found in his Study with the foresaid
Informations, and indorsed thus with his own hand: 1636. March, The Course of
my Visitation in London Diocese: Wherein are these Particular Passage, touching
the railing in of Communion Tables. Mr. Rogers of Massing (mentioned in your
Graces Paper) came not to me for an order for the setting up of a Rail about
his Communion Table: But I GAVE A GENERAL ORDER FOR IT BOTH THERE AND IN ALL
OTHER PLACES WHERE I PASSED. The Communion Table in the Chapel of Highgate
(mentioned in your Graces paper) is already placed at the upper end of the
Quire, and a decent Rail made about it, as J am informed by diverse, (To which
the Archbishop with his own hand adds this Note in the Margin; See it be don:)
In the Parish Church of Edmonton, a fair Monument is set at the upper end of
the Chancell, which I have ordered to be taken down without delay, and the
Communion Table to be set in the place of it, with a comely rail about it. Yet
had this Archbishop the Impudency to protest to the Lords he never gave any
order to Sir Nathaniell Brent, for removing or railing in Communion Tables;
that it was done without his Privity or direction. O portet mendacem esse
memorem. Add to this, that in an Abstract of this Archbishops Metropoliticall
Visitation endorsed by himself and found among his papers; there were these
observable informations given to him by his Visitor, Sir Nathaniel Brent July
16. 1635. At Lyn in the principal Church called St. Margarets, the Communion
Table wanted a rail, which I have ordered. At Northampton, no man boweth at
the pronouncing of the name of Jesus; in all the Churches in Shrewsbury many
things were out of Order, especially about the Communion Table: But the
Officers in every Parish Church most willingly submitted to what I ordered Mr.
Speed of Saint Pancrosse in Chicester is very willing the Gallery in his Church
should be pulled down which was built to receive strangers, as also to remove
the seats which stand even with the Altar. Besides, it appears by a letter of
Will. Kingsley Archdeacon of Cant. to this Archbishop, dated April 13 16 6.
that he gave him order to survay all the Churches in Canterbury, and to certine
him, what Monuments placed the Eastland Galleres were in them, to the end they
might be removed; who gave him this account thereof in writing, found among the
Archbishops Papers.

To the most Reverend Father in God, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, His
Grace, Primate of all England, and Metropolitan, one of His Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Council, My very good Lord.
May it please Your Grace;
I Have according to Your Graces direction survayed the Churches of Your Graces
Arch-Deaconry in the City of Canterbury, In some of which I find Galleries and
seats raised from the ground three or four ascents; as likewise monuments
with diverse Inscriptions, erected without authority at the East End of the
Chancells, And in Saint Gregory's Church of the same City, one other Monument
in which is described the Gunpowder Treason, with this Motto or Inscription in
Capital letters, IN PERPETVAM PAPISTARVM INFAMIAM. This he held him self in
all humility bound to acquaint Your Grace withal, who is ready to execute what
Your Grace shall Command for the ordering of these particulars, or any other
thing Your Grace shall be pleased to enjoyne him, and never cease to pray for
Your Graces prosperity and welfare, Resting,

Your Graces most humble Servant, William Kingsley.
April 13. 1636.

To which Letter the Archbishop returned this answer, sound in his study thus
endorsed, The Copy of my Letters to the Archdeacon of Canterbury, April 29.
1636. concerning the taking down of Galleries, and Monuments in some Churches
of Canterbury, etc.

S. in Christo.
SIR;
YOur Letters of April 13. I have received, and I thank you for your care and
pains in Visiting the Churches of your Arch-Deaconry within the City of
Canterbury, in which I have often heard there are some things amiss, and find
by your report, that the Information given me was true. And because you
certify me of some things of greater moment then ordinary, I thought it very
fit to acquaint His Majesty with all the contents of your Letter, and did so:
By which NOTE.
means, I shall with more freedom give you the fuller answer to the three
particulars mentioned by you.

For the first, which is the raising of Galleries and Seats from the ground
three or four ascents, His Majesty has commanded me to write unto you, that
they be taken down, and the Seats left orderly in the Church. But you are to
take care to acquaint the Minister and Churchwardens with it, and to see it
done, in a fair, and peaceable manner. The like Course you are to take with
the second, for it is no way fit that any Monument whatsoever, should be set up
at the East end of the Chancell, thereby, standing equal at least, if not
above the Communion Table, and fit for nothing but to cast it out of its proper
place. Therefore if any such be in any Church within your jurisdiction, you are
to speak with them that are next of Kin, or NOTE.
whom such Monuments may most concern. And if they will remove them, and set
them up in any other place, on the sides of the Church, you are to give them
leave so to do; but if they will not, you are then to take them down, in an
orderly way, and not to suffer any to stand at the East end of the Chancell.

Your third business, is of greater consequence, it is, that there is another
Monument in Saint Georges Church, in which there is described in Capital
Letters, the GUN-POUDER TREASON, with this motto, In perpetuam Papistarum
infamiam, etc. I hope this stands not at the East end of the Chancell, for if
it do, you must see it removed to some other place, but if it stand upon any
side of either Chancell, or Church, then you are with the knowledge of the
Minister and the Churchwardens, or any other whom that Monument may concern,
to take some Painter to you and cause him to put out of the Monument, all that
NOTE.
concerns the Fleet in 88. because that belongs to a Foreign Nation: And
though your Letters make no mention of 88. yet the Picture of the Monument,
which you sent me up does, which I showed His Majesty as well as Your Letter.
So having here given you a clear direction in all your three particulars, I
shall expect your care in the execution of them according to it, So I leave you
to the grace of God, and rest,

Your very loving Friend. Will: Cant,


By these two Letters it is apparent, that the Archbishop gave special
directions not only to Sir Nathaniell Brent, but to the Archdeacon of
Canterbury to take down Galleries and Monuments at the East end of Chancells
near the Communeon-Tables; and to place the Tables there, at in their proper
place; as likewise to obliterate the memorial of our happy deliverance from
the Spanish Armado in 88. out of that Church, where it had long continued.

Finally, it was proved by the testimony of Master Sutton, Master Brown, and
others, that in the year 1640. in the new Chapel at WEST MINSTER, the Kings
Arms were set up in the East Window, which was first glased with white Glass;
afterward the Archbishop promising to bestow a new window instead of it, the
Kings Arms were thereupon taken down by direction of Doctor Haywood, the
Archbishops Chaplain, and Brown this Joyner, and placed in another obscure
window, and the Archbishops Arms (supported by Seraphins) put up in its place
to signify, that he was the sole donor of this new Window, where instead of
the white Glass, there was set up in colored glass, the Picture of the Holy
Ghost in form of a Dove, with the Images of the Virgin Mary, Christ, Angels,
and Ceraphins, for which the Glasier was paid since the Archbishops commitment
to the Tower by the Archbishops direction (as the Glasier verily believed,)
this new painted Window being set up about the beginning of this Parliament,
but since demolished by order of Parliament; which manifests the Archbishops
perseverance in his Popish Innovations notwithstanding the Scottish troubles,
and the many late complaints against them in the last dissolved and present
Parliament.

When this Arch-Prelate had in his Metropoliticall Visitation by private
instructions only to his Vicar General and other Agents, set on these
Innovations, and introduced them into many Parish-Churches in most Diocese,
he then by his subordinate Suffragans and Creatures, began to enforce them
universally upon all Ministers Churchwardens, Parishes, by Visitation Oaths
and Articles, upon which such Ministers, Churchwardens and others who opposed
them were presented yea prosecuted as Delinquents. Among others Dr. Pierce
Bish. of Bath and Wells, Matthew Wren, Bish. of Norwich, Bish. Lindsy of
Peterborough, Bish. Mountague of Chichester and Skinner, Bishop of Bristall,
were the chief promoters of his Innovations especially of railing in Communion
Tables Altarwise, bowing to and toward them, saying second service at them,
and coming up to the new rayles to receive the Sacrament, prescribing these
particulars in their several Visitation Articles: Witness Rich: Mountague
Bishop of Chichester, his printed Visitation Articles there, 1635. which after
his translation to Norwich, he enlarged with some printed additions for that
Diocese Anno 1638. of which there were two impressions.

IS your Chancell divided from the Nave or body of your Church, with a
partition of Stone, Boards, Wainscot, Grates, or otherwise? wherein is there a
strong door, to open and shut, (as occasion ferveth) with locks and keys, to
keep out boys, and girls, or unreverent men and women? and are dogs kept
from coming to be soil or profane the Lords Table?

9. Is your Chancell well paved, etc? does it altogether lie upon a flat, or
has NOTE.
it ascents up unto the ALTAR?

10. Is your Church scaffolded every where or in part? do these scaffolds so
made annoy any man's feat, or hinder the lights of any Window in the Church? Is
your Chancell surrounded with seats, wherein your Parishioners commonly use to
sit, which take up the room to much, and encroach upon the propriety of the
Minister?

Tit. 3. Of sacred Utensills, Church-ornaments, etc. Sect. 4. Have you two
fair large Surplesses for your Minister to Officiate Divine Service in, that
the one may be for change, when the other is at washing? and also serve for
him, that at Communion assisteth the chief Minister, that no point of Divine
service may be done, but with and in Ministerial vestments?

5. Of what assise be the Surplices, large or scantting? Of what Cloth, course
or fine? What are they worth if they were to be sold? for not cheapnesse, but
decentnesse, is to respected in the service of God.

7. Is your Communion Table, OR ALTAR of Stone, Wainscot, Joyners work strong,
fair and decent? What is it worth in your opinion were it to NOTE.
be sold?

8. Have you a covering or Carpet of Silk, Satin, Damask, or some more then
ordinary stuff, to cover the Table with at all times, and a fair, clean, and
fine linen covering at time of administering the Sacrament?

9. Have you a Chalice or Communion-Cup with a cover, of silver, and a Flagon
or Silver or Pe^ter, (but rather of silver) to put the Wine in? which is to be
consecrated, and not to be brought into the Church, and set on the Table in
Leather or Wicker-bottles, or Tavern wine-potts, which being of vulgar, common
and profane employments, ought not to be presented in the Church, or at the
LORDS TABLE.

10. Have you a plate or patten fair and deep, of the same materials, for
the bread? As also a Corporas Cloth or Napkin of fine Linen, to cover the
Bread consecuted, (which cannot all at once be contained in the Patten) and to
fold up what is not used at Communions? are all these sacred Vtensills, clean
kept, washed, scowred, as often as need or convenience requires?

11. Is your Communion Table, enclosed and ranged about with a rail of Joyners
and Turners work, close enough to keep out dogs from going in and
profaning NOTE.
that holy place, from pissing against it, or worse? and is there a door of the
same work to open and shut? do any persons presume to enter thereinto, except
such as be in holy orders?

12 Is the Communion Table fixedly set, in such convenient sort and place
within the Chancell, as has been appointed by authority, according to the
practice of the Ancient Church; that is, at the East end of the Chancell, close
unto the Wall, upon an asscent or higher ground, that the officiating Priest,
may be best seen and NOTE.
heard of the Communicants, in that sacred action?

13. Whether is the Communion Table removed down at any time, either for or
without Communion, into the lower part of the Chancell, or body of the Church?
by whom, at whose instance, direction or command is it done?

Do your Parishoners at their entrance within the Church doors use that
comely and decent deportment which is fitting for Gods house, where God, whom
Heaven and earth cannot contain, is said to dwell, and does manifest his
goodness and mercy to man out of his word? do they uncover their heads, sit
bare all service time, kneel down in their seats, bowing toward NOTE.
the Chancell, and Communion Table, and use those several postures which fit
the several acts and parts of Divine Service?

14. That is, Do they reverently kneel at Confession, Absolution, the
Lords-Prayer, the Church Prayers and Petitions or Collects, as becomes suitors
unto God? Do they stand at the Creed, as avowing their belief in the face of
Heaven and earth, men and Angels; at the Hymns and Doxologie, or Glory be to
the Father, etc. against the oppugners of the Trinity, (which in the Primitive
Church was repeated at the end of every Psalm, and ought so to be in ours.) Do
they stand also at the reading of the Gospel, and bend or bow at the glorious
sacred and sweet name of Jesus, pronounced out NOTE.
of the Gospel read?

20. Does he upon Wednesdayes and Fridayes ordinarily and at other
extraordinary times appointed by the Ordinary, read and pray the Letanie? and
does he especially on Sundays, read the second or latter Service at the
Communion Table (as the ancient tradition of the Church was to do, after the
dismission or missa of the Catechumoni, Euergumeni and Paenitentes) and not
NOTE.
in his Pewe, or Reading-seate, though there be no Communion, and this as well
before as after the Sermon?

Tit. 6. Sect. 27. Is the Grave made East and West? Is the body buried with the
head to the West? NOTE.


Tit. 7. Sect. 12. And whereas it offends many, that we sometimes call the
Lords-Table an Altar, and dispose of it Altar-wise, that we use the phrase of
Sacrament of the Altar, in oppugning whereof, it has been charged with Popery,
and constantly (but ignorantly) affirmed, that in the Primitive NOTE.
Church it was not named an Altar for three hundred years after Christ: to
give satisfaction herein, and hereabout, both to Priests and people, I avow
upon certain knowledge out of my poor reading, That for all the time
articulate, the word Table is not above thrice used, but ever Altar, and of
Ecclesiastical Writers within that time, only Dionysius Areopagita has it,
and that but once, and occasionally; which assertion (I am sure) cannot be
refelled: and therefore if we will (as we profess to do) follow the course
and practice of the Ancient Primitive, Apostolical Church, we ought not NOTE.
to traduce or be offended at the name, thing, or use of Altar, whereat a
manifold Sacrifice is offered to God.

Tit. 8. Sect. 9. Touching Parishioners. Does any married woman within your
Parish after childbirth neglect to come to Church, according to the book of
Common Prayer, to give thanks to God for her safe deliverance, vayled in a
decent manner, as has been anciently accustomed? and does she then kneel in
some convenient place nigh to the Communion Table, while the Priest (standing
by her) gives thanks to God for her; and if there be a Communion does she
then offer her accustomed offerings, and receive the holy Communion?

11. Do all your Parishioners of what sort soever, according as the Church
expressly them commands, draw near, and with all Christian humility and
reverence come to the Lords-Table, when they are to receive the Holy Communion;
and not (after the most contemptuous and un-holy usage of some, if men do
rightly consider) sit still in their Seats or Pewes, to have the blessed Body
and Blood of our Savior, go up and down to seek them all the Church over.

Tit. 9. Of Clerks, Sextons, Churchwardens, and Sidemen.

5. Do you, or have any of you meddled with setting, placing, displacing,
removing the Communion Table up and down, of your own heads, without NOTE.
the Minister, or with him, not by order from the Bishop?

6. Do you know of any Parishioner or Forreiner, who has committed or
attempted such an Act? If you can learn them, Present their names.

Tit. Sect. 10. Distinct and punctual Answer must be made to every one of
these Articles.

On all which Articles Churchwardens and Sidemen were obliged to present
Non-conformists to them, by this strict ensuing Oath.

The Tenor of the Oath to be administered unto, and taken by the
Churchwardens, and Sidemen.
Swear you shall, that you shall duly consider, and diligently enquire of all
and every one of these Articles given you in charge, and tendered unto you; and
that all affection, favor, malice, hatred, hope of reward, gain, displeasure
of great men, malice, or other sinister respect set aside; you shall faithfully
discharge your duty, and truly present all and every such person of and in your
Parish, as has made any default, or committed any offense in or NOTE.
against these ensuing Acticles, or that be vehemently suspected, or defamed of
any such offense, or crime; wherein you shall deal uprightly, truly, and
fully, presenting all the truth, and nothing but the truth, without partiality,
having God before your eyes, and an earnest Christian zeal to maintain truth,
order, and Religion, and to suppress the contrary: So help you God, and the
holy contents of this Book.

Matthew Wren Bishop of Norwich, in his first Visitation of that Diocese among
other Articles to be enquired of within that Diocese, prescribed these ensuing
Articles upon Oath, printed by Richard Baiger 1636. concurring in substance
with Bishop Mountagues.

Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Have you in your Church or Chapel a Font of stone set in
the ancient usual place, whole and clean, and fit to hold water? a convenient
and decent Communion Table, with a Carpet of silk, or some other decent stuff
continually laid upon the Table, at the time of Divine Service, and a fair
linen cloth thereon laid, at the time of Administering the Communion? and is
the same Table placed conveniently so as the Minister may best be heard in his
Administration, and the greatest number may reverently communicate? to that
end, does it ordinarily stand up at the East end of the Chancell, where the
Altar in former times stood, the ends thereof being placed NOTE.
North and South? is it any time used unreverently,, by leaving or sitting on
it, throwing hats or any thing else upon it, or writing on it? or is it abused
to any other profane or common use? and are the Ten Commandments set up in
your Church or Chapel, where the people may see and read them, and other
chosen sentences also written upon the walls in your said Church or Chapel,
in places convenient for the same purpose?

Sect. 12. Are all the Pewes and Seats in the Church so ordered, that they
which are in them, may all conveniently kneel down in the time of Prayer, and
have their faces up Eastward toward the holy Table? Are there also any kind
of Seats at the East End of the Chancell, above the Communion Table, NOTE.
or on either side even with it?

Sect. 14. Has any in your Parish defaced, or caused to be defaced, or
purloined any Monumen^s, (that is Crucifixes and old Images) or Ornaments in
the Church.

Chap. 4. Sect. 7. Does every Priest and Deacon in your Parish daily say the
Morning and Evening Prayer, either privately, or openly? Does the Curate say
the same daily in the Church or Chapel, with the tolling of a Bell before he
begins? At the end of every Psalm, do they stand and say, Glory be to the
Father, etc.

Chap. 4. Sect. 8. Does your Minister and Curate at all times, as well in
Preaching or Reading the Homilies, as in reading the Prayers and Lerany, in
Administering the holy Sacraments, Solemnization of Marriage, Burying the Dead,
Churching of Women, and all other Offices of the Church, duly observe the Rites
prescribed, without omission, alteration, or addition of any thing? And does he
in performing all and every of these, wear the Surplice duly, and NEVER OMIT
THE WEARING OF THE SAME nor of his Hood, if he be a Graduate?

Chap. 7. Sect. 4. Have you in your Parish, that do not reverently behave
themselves, entering into the Church? (that is, by bowing toward the Altar) Do
all use due and lowly reverence, when the blessed name of the Lord Jesus is
mentioned, and stand up when the Articles of the Creed are read?

Sect. 17. Do all your Parishioners of what sort soever, according as the
Church expressly them commands, draw near, and with all Christian humility
and reverence, come to the Lords-Table, when they are to receive the holy
Communion? and not (after the most contemptuous and unholy usage of some, if
men did rightly consider) sit still in their Seats or Pewes, to have the
blessed Body and blood of our Savior, go up and down to seek them all the
Church over.

Chap. 9. Sect. 11. Were there any particular or special Injunctions given (as
you know, or have heard) by the Vicar General, or any other Commissioner, at
the last Metropoliticall Visitation of the most Reverend the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury his Grace? and how have the same been performed or observed by the
Minister, or any other of the Parish, whom they concern?

Sect. 12. Lastly, have you, and every of you, by your selves read, or have
caused to be read to you all these Articles? have you well examined and
inquired into every particular therein intended? have you sincerely, uprightly,
and without any partial affection or concealment, presented and made known
all and every of the offenders, in any of the particulars, either as they are
taken in truth, to be, or by common fame reported?

To these Articles, this Bishop annexed diverse particular Injunctions,
prescribing, Railing in of Communion-Tables Altar-wise, bowing toward them,
reading second Service at them, that every Combination Lecturer, should in his
Surplice and Hood, begin the second Service at the Communion Table before he
went up into the Pulpit, into which he should ascend, after the reading of the
Nicene Creed, using no other prayer than that prescribed in the 55. Canon, nor
Preaching above one hour; that he should not give the blessing out of the
Pulpit, but should descend again to the Table, and read the Prayer for the
universal Church, and so dismiss the Congregation with the Peace of God, etc.
That all Communicants should come up by files, and receive the Sacrament at the
new Rayles, kneeling, etc. As appears by his Injunctions, annexed to his
Articles in writing, and his Account to the Archbishop, for the year 1636.
both found in the Archbishops study, and attested by Mr. Prynne.

In this Diocese of Norwich (by means of these Visitation Articles.) Bishop
Mountague, in his Account to the Archbishop for the year, 1638. informs him
under his own hand, That all Courches were furnished with the ALTAR, standing
close to the East-wall, all Rayled about the Altar: But withal he certifies
him, that many of the people complained they were troubled, and Excommunicated
by his Predecessor (Bishop Wren) for not coming up to receive at the Rayls,
about the Altar, in this manner. 19.
As many as can well kneel close unto the Rayles, come up out of the Church,
and then upon their knees receive from the Priest standing within the Rayles,
the Bread and Wine, who being thus Communicated, rise and depart into the
Church, and as many more as can likewise kneel, succeed, and being
Communicated, likewise depart, which course is observed till all have received.
Against this, they say, it is a new, un-necessary troublesome course, not
enjoined by Law, not required by Canon, nor imposed by His Majesty, or my Lord
of Canterbury, whose Injunctions they profess they will obey; nor in the
Articles or Injunctions of any Bishop.

20.
This, as it perplexeth them, so I must profess, it troubles me, wherein I
desire resolution and direction. For if this be the case as they pretend, in my
poor opinion, it is inter minutiora Legis, to make the best of it, and happily
in these times of opposition; it were not amiss to follow that wise direction
of the greatest Council of Christendom, the first of Nice, Let ancient customs
be observed.

21.
If I may be bold to deliver my own poor private opinion concerning this case,
as they relate it, not otherwise; I hold it a mere un-necessary, inconvenient,
combersome, or irregular course. I know it has no velam nor vestigum NOTE.
in Antiquity, who as it appears by Saint Chrysostom, communicated
Communicants kneeling in the Chancell in their distinct ranks, the doors
shut, none permitted to depart till the blessing pronounced, and Ite in peace.

22.
I know of no Law, Articles, Advertisements, Canons, Injunctions, that require
it; I cannot tell where, when, by whom it came up: This I know, it is NOTE.
the practice of the Roman Church; at least in Italy and Rome, and yet draws
near upon the Lees of the Geneva Discipline, in their running Banquet, as it
is rightly named.

23.
I humbly crave pardon, for this my free, but private opinion of that course
upon which so many in my Diocese do stand, 24.
who otherwise do profess all obedience to the Church orders; and I doubt not
but to bring them thereto, and settle them therein, almost I durst undertake it.

This Account of Bishop Mountague being showed Bishop Wren, by the Archbishop,
he returned this Answer in writing thereunto, which he delivered to the
Archbishop, in whose Study Mr. Prynne seized it.

18.
The number of them that stood excommunicated for this which is alleged, were
not 13, in above 1300. Parishes.

19.
When they had received both the bread and wine (two ranks of them) they
quietly withdrew, and remained in the Chancell (if it would hold them) and
others kneeled down in their rooms.

20.
No marvel if it like not those, that will pronounce it new, unnecessary and
troublesome. The Service book enjoynes it, by requiring all to draw near. The
King Himself does it, and His whole Household in effect.

21.
It had bin neither perplexity nor trouble in that Diocese ere now, if it had
not (unawares) bin declaimed against by his Lordship, before he came into the
Diocese. Many of his Faction pricked up their ears at that, and then his
Lordship had plunged himself to openly to get back hansomely. Now he is come
into the Diocese, and finds it so generally practiced and desired by the best
of all sorts; It is hoped that upon this private narration, either my Lords
Grace, of the King will gainsay it. 21.


It were fit, that what he reputed an irregular custom had bin expressed, And
whether to carry the holy Sacrament up and down to their Seats be it? Where the
Chancells will not receive all the Communicants, what more trouble, of
successive coming before the Rail, then into the Chancell? Many Chancells are
so seated, that it cannot appear how the Communicants kneels and for this (in
truth) the Faction has the greatest stick at it: Many Parishes are populous,
and the Chancels large, but the Chalices very small, while the Priest then goes
to and again, so far to renew the Cup, much time and labor is lost.

22.
This supposition holds not, for very many Chancells will not hold all the
Communicants, much less to kneel conveniently all at once: To come before the
Rail has more analogy with Antiquity, then some men have seen, or others
will. In England they came but to the Chancell doors, till our Laws brought
them into the Chancell. So now the Rail serves to distinguish the Presbyterian
from the Chorus, and that place in Saint Chrysostom, (I believe) will
otherwise prove to be mistaken.

23.
That it is like the practice of the Roman Church, I suppose is the better,
seeing NOTE.
we never found fault with them for it till now. As for Geneva, it is not so like
to theirs, or theirs to it, as an Ape is to a man; and yet is far enough from
being a man.

This is spoken unto in the precedents. 24.


After which, Bishop Mountague in a Synod at Ipswitch, October. 8. 1639. gave
these ensuing directions to his Clergy, concerning the peoples coming up to
the Rayles to receive. A Copy whereof he sent to the Archbishop, who received
it the 21th. of the same Month, as appears by his endorsement thereof.

When I came first into this Diocese, I was much and often troubled by many in
many parts thereof, about coming up to the Rayles, as they called it, in time
of the holy Communion.

This was a novelty unto me as it seemed it was in it self; for I had never
NOTE.
heard of it, nor did I know what it meant. But I understood at length it was
this; Those that intend to receive the holy Sacrament, are to come up out of
the Church, and to draw near unto the Rayles, which enclose the Altar, or
Communion Table, and there to kneel as many as can, and to receive in both
kinds at the Ministers hands; when this company at the Rayles have received in
both kinds, they are to rise up, to withdraw, and another company to succeed
in their places; and after them, a third, and so till all be in that sort
Communicated.

In this course thus observed, I do not understand whether all at once that
intend to Communicate, do together come up out of the Church into the Chancell,
and being there disposed, sitting or standing, do in course repair unto the
Rayles, and return from thence; Or whether only so many do together come up
out of the Church, as can kneel at the Rayles, the other remaining in the
Church behind, until their course come to go up? Nor do I know, whether they
repair, being risen from the Rayles, whether into some place in the Chancell,
or out of the Chancell into the Church, which may be combersome, and is
inconvenient, it being for any thing I know to the contrary, an ancient
Tradition of the Church, for no man to go out of the Chancel, or from his
place, having received it until the Ite missa or dismissive blessing upon
them, which we call the Peace of God. Therefore to give that satisfaction which
I can in this cause; because yet never any Recusant of coming up to the
Rayles, did unto me refuse to come into the Chancell, to receive upon their
knees, to observe the Service Book in all points, only they cannot digest the
going up, and coming down, and disquieting the Assembly, which neither do I
my self approve of, until His Majesty, or my Lords Grace of Canterbury
appoint otherwise; to whom I NOTE.
do, and they must, and I hope will submit themselves. These orders I have
thought good for quiet, peace and conformity to direct.

First, after the words or Exhortation pronounced aloud by the Minister,
standing at the Communion Table, to the Parishioners as yet in the Church, draw
near, etc.

All intending to Communicate, are to come up out of the Church into the
Chancell; and as in course of Civility and good order, it is seemly the best
in the Parish to come up first.

All being come in, the Chancell door is to be shut, and not to be opened till
the Communion is done; that no Communicant departtill the dimission, no
non-Communicant come in amongst them, no Boys, Girls or gasers be suffered to
look in as to a Play.

The Communicants being entered, to be disposed into several stations, ranks,
or forms; the first rank to stand, sit, or kneel, near or close unto the
Rayles, which being the most eminent place, the best in the Parish may fitly be
disposed there.

And for order and decency though all be Communicants alike, in that holy
Communion, yet confusion is to be avoided.

The first rank being thus disposed, behind them a second, behind them a
third rank may be disposed, leaving a sufficient space for the Priest to go
between, in giving first the Bread to all the several Communicants, and then
the Wine afterward, if he be sole, and if he have an assistant, the chief
Minister to give the Bread, and the Assistant to follow him with the Cup, or
Challice, both going out from the Altar, when the first rank is served; and
whereas in many Chancells, if not in all, there be Seats built up, the more is
the pity, to pester the Chancell; it is not fit that any should go into them,
until the several ranks have filled the whole Chancell.

But because peradventure some out of zeal without knowledge or discretion,
have stubbornly refused to come unto the Rayles near them, as if it were
impious, at least superstitious to come there, as by name one Mr. Day of
Ipswich; I do require him to receive at the Rayles, the next Communion, sub
paena juris, and for the rest of the refusers, who have promised conformity in
all things, but in rising up, and going up and down, which I neither will, nor
do require of them; let them manifest their conformity by once coming up, and
afterward as it happens, dispose themselves in the Chancell.

As these Popish Innovations, Ceremonies were thus set on and prescribed in the
Diocese of Chichester, and Norwich, by Mountague, and Wren: so were they by
Doctor Divenant Bishop of Salisbury, (of whose direction and determination
concerning the placing of the Communion Table, the Archbishop took much
advantage in his Star Chamber speech, page 13, 14.) by the Bishop of Lincoln,
Williams, and his Officers in his Diocese, notwithstanding he seemed
afterward to oppose them, and Canterburies proceedings herein, in his Holy
Table, name, and thing.

This is undeniably evident by the ensuing Acts, for railing in all Lords
Tables in every Church and Chapel made, in his Visitation, 1635.

And by Articles to be enquired of within the Archdeaconry of Buckingham, (in
the Diocese of Lincoln) at the Visitation of the Archdeacon there, this
present year 1637. Printed at London 1637.

Artic. 5. Have you ad^cent Table, on a frame for the holy Communion, placed at
the Note.
East end of the Chancell? Is it rayled in or enclosed, so as Men or Boys
cannot sit upon it, or throw their hats upon it? Is the said rail or (...)
with s^ttles or kneeling h^nches, at (...) or bottom thereof, no the
Communicants way fitly kneel there at the receiving of the holy Communion?

Artic. 38. Whether any in your Parish have covered his head in time of Divine
Service, contrary to the ^^ Canon; any that do not kneel at the saying of the
general Confession, Letany, ten Commandments, and other prayers read in the
said Church ^ any that do not stand up at the saying the Belief, or not how or
use reverenc^ when (in time of Divine service) the name of Jesus is read or
(...)? etc.

Moreover Dr. Pierce Bishop of Bath and Wels, not only prescribes the railing
in of Communion Tables Altarwise, under penalties and fines in his Visitation
Articles and Courts, but likewise appoints Ministers in every Division to see
it executed, and presents these reasons for it to the Archbishop, who endorsed
them thus with his own hand. Recepi. March 9. 1633. L. Bishop of Bath and Wels
about placing the Communion Table.

Reasons why the Communion Table in every Church should be set close under the
East-window or wall, with the ends North and South, and be rayled in.

1. It was ordered in Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions, That the Communion Table
should stand where the Altar did.

2. There should be some difference between the placing of the Lords Table in
the Church, and the placing of a man's Table in his house.

3. It is not sit the people should sit above Gods Table, or he above the
Priest when he consecrateth.

4. If it stand not thus, and he not rayled in, it will be subject to many
prophanations and abuses; Churchwardens will keep their accounts at the Lords
Table, Parishioners will sit round about it, and talk of their Parish
businesses (whereas the Lords Table is for no other use but only for the
Communion; and the service and prayers of the Church) Schoolmasters will teach
their Boys to write upon this Table, and the Boys will ^ay their Hats,
Sachels, and Books upon it, and in their Masters absence sit upon the same; and
many will sit or learn irreverently against the Lords Table in Sermon time.
Glasiers will knock it full of mile holes (as it is found by experience they
have done in many places) and Dogs will defile the Lords Table.

5. When the Communion Table stands thus, the Chancell is the fairer, and there
^^ more (...) for the Communicants.

6. Where the Communion Table stands thus, the face of the Priest is seen of
all, and his voice is (...) heard of all which sit on the North side of the
Chancel.

7. It is sit the Daughters should be like their Mother, the Patochiall
Churches should be (...) the C^thedrall Churches, that so there may be an
uniformity in this respect Note.

Henry Archbold, Registers.

After which, this Bishop in a better mood, Ordering the Communion Table only
at the time of administering the Sacrament to be brought into the midst of the
Chancell (being large) without the precincts of its impounding rayles,
thereupon the Archbishops Creatures gave present secret notice thereof by way
of complaint to Sir John Lamb, and he to the Archbishop in these ensuing
Letters (found among Sir John Lambs papers by Mr. Prynne) endorsed with Mr.
Dels, the Archbishops Secretaries hand upon the Archbishops perusal of them.
The first was this Letter from Mr. Bird to Mr. Latham.

Good Master Latham,
Being at Mr. Lessons my Lord Bishops accustomed Inn, I was there called and
sent for to a private room before Mr. Major, and some others of the Fraternity;
the business was concerning the removal of the Communion Table fromits ascent
of 3 steps, Note.
unto the body of the Chancel, during the administration of that blessed
Sacrament: and they fearing me and my thwarting it, moved my Lord to command me
from either troubling them, or altering that. But how this can be effected,
without a great deal of inconveniency both to Minister and people, I know not;
the Table and all other ceremonies necessary then to be used, being by this
means obscured, and taken away from the ears and eyes of the people. This is
all (except his Sermon) that his Lordship has done here, and so much I thought
good to certify you; desiring you to make what use you can of it, provided you
ever conceal the name of

Your assured loving friend Tho. Byrd.
Covent. 21 March. juxta count. Aug. 1636.

The second, this Letter from Mr. Latham to Sir John Lamb.

Most worthy Sir,
Our Lord Bishop at his departure from hence left such a terrible noise behind
him of threatening, against his Chancelour, Mr. Ieffraye Archdeacon of Salop,
and my Self, as would make men that were any thing obnoxious, much afraid; but
for mine own part I thank God I fear him not, but will and shall be ready to
justify my self in any thing I have done, and whatsoever has passed betwixt
your worship and my self concerning his Lordship, can well prove if need
require, with much more; which upon the least notice, I will be ready to wait
upon my Lords Grace and yourselfe to Note.
perform. S. Michaels in Coventry have raised their steps up to the Altar with
curious workmanship and stone, and have been at great charge in making a Septum
about the Table; yet has his Lordship, as you may perceive by this enclosed
Letter, commanded the Table to be brought down into the middle of the Chancel
for this holy time; perhaps his Lordship will say, the Cancels are not fully
finished, but they were so much up at his being at Coventry, as that they might
well come up and receive the holy Communion, and are now finished, and the
Table has been at the upper end ever since his Majesty's commands. Mr. Byrd
would not be known of this if it may be, yet he will justify it, and others
also if it must be.

Your Worships to be commanded ever, Edward Latham.
Lichf. 27 Martii 1637.

By this it appears, the Archbishop had his Spies and Informers in all places
to certify him of the very least oppositions against his Innovations, by
Bishops or others: which will be further manifested by three other Letters. The
first is a Copy of the Bishop of Lincolns Letter to his Surrogate Mr. Burdin,
about S. Martins Communion Table in Leicester, and the placing of it; the copy
whereof was presently sent to Sir John Lamb, and by him conveyed to the
Archbishop, who endorsed it with his own hand.

After my very heartiest commendations unto you,

Whereas I have appointed the parishioners of S. Martins in Leicester to remove
their common Library from the Quire of their Church into another room, provided
by the Major, Aldermen, and Corporation of Leicester for that purpose, and have
persuaded them to trim up and prepare their foresaid Quire with Railes and
other ornaments to place therein their Communion Table, all the which they have
accordingly performed. And whereas upon a Certificate made unto me by the
Vicar, the Churchwardens, diverse of the Aldermen, and others the better sort of
that Parish, That the place where their Table stood before is far more fit, by
the reason of the more capacity to receive the Communicants, and the more
audiblenesse of the Ministers voice, and the proximity to that place where
Morning and Evening prayer are appointed to be said, then this Chancell is. I
have therefore, according to the Lyturgie confirmed by Act of Parliament, the
several Injunctions of our Princes heretofore, and the 82 Canon now Note
in force (as I hope I should as rightly understand them as any of my said
subordinate Officers can do) given the said Vicar, Churchwardens, and
parishioners, leave to remove the said Communion Table to the aforesaid place
where it formerly stood, at such times as they are to receive the Communion.
These are to require you not to be troublesome or molestfull to the said
parties in any thing concerning the premises, until you shall legally disprove
unto me the truth of the aforesaid Certificate; and so I commend you to God,
and am

Your very loving friend and Bishop, Ioh. Lincoln.
Buckden this 19 of December, 1633.

The second, is a clause in Dr. Aylets Letter to Sir John Lamb, about railing
in Communion Tables.

Good Sir, etc. I have caused many of the Communion Tables within my Officiary
to be rayled in, and the people to come up and kneel and receive at the Rail,
(though with much opposition, especially in great clothing Towns, because they
see no such thing, as they say in the Churches of London;) but since our
Article Books for the Metropoliticall visitation were delivered, they have
found an Article, which as they conceive, gives them leave to remove their
Table at the time of celebration, and place it as it may be most convenient for
the parishioners to come about it and receive; with in some places where the
Minister is willing to please his people, undoes all which I have done, and
lays on me an imputation, as if it were mine own invention, crossing that
Article delivered by his Graces Visitor in his several Visitations: Note.
for this I humbly desire to know his Graces pleasure and your best direction.
You will be pleased to excuse the length of my seldom Letters, and to remember
my humble service to his Grace.

Your ever obliged servant and affectionate Kinsman, Robert Aylet.
Farly 29 June 1636.

Here we see the Archbishop made the only common rule and directory of all
these Innovations.

The third is a clause in D. Clerks Letter to Sir John Lamb concerning the
removal of the Rail and Communion Table at Northampton during the plague
there.

Worthy Sir, etc. They now do what they list in the Church service at
All Saints in Northampton, and some very lately have (as I am informed) cut the
Rail or Cancel that was about the Lords Board in Pieces, and have brought down
the Lords Table into the middle of the Church: I long since advised the Mayor
and some of his discreet Brethren, that the Tuesday Lecture and Sermon on
Sundays in the afternoon should be forborne in these infections and dangerous
times; they then raised a report of me, that I went about to starve their
souls: you may do well to acquaint my Lords Grace with so much of this as you
please. The schismatic Puritans now Note.
bring their Appeals from the Audience, as namely the Churchwardens of
Towcester, who are questioned for not presenting some 80 or an hundred of their
Parish who refused to receive the blessed Sacrament at the CANCEL at Easter
last, etc.

Yours unfeined to love and serve you, Sam. Clerk.
Kingsth 17 June 1638.

This Archbishop having thus introduced by successive degrees these several
popish Innovations, so far as to enforce them generally upon all Ministers,
Churchwardens, Parishioners, Cathedrals, Parish-Churches, Chapels, and to
receive Informations against those who were opposite to his designs herein;
proceeded at last to the highest pitch of tyranny and arbitrary government in
this kind, even to question, persecute, censure, ruin Ministers,
Churchwardens, and others in the High Commission, Star Chamber, and elsewhere;
who out of conscience refused to submit, or adventured to oppose these his
illegal Romish Innovations; for proof whereof were produced several sad and
tragical instances, not to be paralleld in any age. We shall begin with
Presidents in the High Commission.

The first in this kind, which we shall but name (because so publicly known
and fully proved before both Houses this present Parliament) is the case of
Master Peter Smart, the ancientest Prebend in the Cathedral at Durham; who for
preaching a Sermon in that Cathedral against the several popish Innovations
brought into that Church by Dr. Cosens and his confederates, as Images, Copes,
Tapers, Crucifixes, bowing to the Altar, praying toward the East, turning the
Communion Table of wood standing in the midst of the Quire into an Altar of
stone, rayled in at the East end of the Quire Altarwise, and adorned after the
popish manner with all kind of Romish furniture, was by this Archbishops means
(as appears by diverse letters between D. Cosens and him found in his Study at
Lambeth) first questioned in the High Commission Court at Durham, then brought
into the High Commission Court at Lambeth; after that transmitted thence to the
High Commission at York; and there for this Sermon of his alone against these
illegal Innovations, though a reverend grave Divine, every way conformable to
the established doctrine and ceremonies of the Church, deprived of his
Prebendary Benefice in Durham, and all his Ecclesiastical preferments,
degraded from his Ministry, fined 500 li. and imprisoned diverse years, till
this present Parliament, to his utter ruin, and above ten thousand pound
damage, the Archbishop disposing of his Livings to his own Creatures.

This sentence of his in the High Commission at York, was seconded with another
(though not of so high a nature) in the High Commission at Lambeth.

Mr. Charles Chaucy, Minister of Ware in Hertfordshire, within the Diocese of
London, was articled against in the High Commission by the Archbishops
procurement (when Bishop of London) together with one Humphrey Parker, only for
opposing the railing in of the Communion Table at Ware, and speaking against it
as an innovation. Mr. Gellibrand testified upon his oath, that at the hearing
of this cause, Doctor Merick of council with Mr. Chaucy, endeavored to excuse
and justify this his opposition, and dislike of the new Rail, because it was
first set up by some few of the parishioners without any warrant from the
Bishop of the Dioces or his Chancellor, as was proved: whereupon the
Archbishop grew exceeding angry, and threatened to suspend the Doctor from his
practice, for pleading thus in his Cliants behalf: whereupon the Doctor not
daring to make any further defense, Mr. Chaucey was suspended from his
Ministry, and both he and Parker sentenced to make a public submission and
recantation in open Court, condemned in costs of suit (taxed at 40 li.) which
they were enforced to pay, and imprisoned till they had performed the order of
the Court, or put in bond to do it. This was further manifested by the sentence
and recantation it self, 4 Ian. 1635. recorded in the High Commission
Register, Lib. A. f. 264. 266. 331. and lib. C. which sentence was read at the
Lords Bar, in form ensuing.

Officium Dominoru^ cont. Carolum Chauncy Clericum, nuper Vicarium de Ware in
Com. Hertford. and Humphridum Parker Y^oman. Do. Ryves.
Die Iovis viz. 26 November. 1635 aoram Commis. Regis apud Lambeth.
At which day and place, the said Chauncy and Parker being publicly called
for, appeared personally, in whose presence the proofs taken and made in this
cause against them, were there publicly read; which done, Dr. Ryves his
Majesty's Advocate, and Dr. Parry of council for the Office, enforced the
proofs made against them; and after that Dr. Zouch, Dr. Merrick, and D. Lewyu,
being of Counsel for the defendants, enforced the proofs made for their
defense: upon consideration whereof it evidently appeared to the Court out of
the proofs had and made in this cause, that for three or two years next before
the year of our Lord 1633. the said Charles Chauncy was Vicar of Ware,
articulate within which time the Church wardens of the Parish of Ware, for the
avoiding of confusion and disorder, at the time of administration of the holy
Communion (because some were conceived to receive it sitting or leaning in
their seats) at a general meeting of the parishioners; and with the consent of
the greater part of them, agreed that the Communion Table should be placed in
the Chancell of the Parish Church of Ware, and a Rail set round about it with
a bench thereunto affixed, whereon the communicants might kneel: that
accordingly a Rail with such a bench was set afterward about the Communion
Table in the middle of the Chancell of the said Church of Ware; and the same
was approved of and confirmed by the Lord Bishop of London, Ordinary of the
place, and M. Doct. Duck his Chancelour: but the foresaid rail and bench was
not set up, until an Order came from the Ordinary for the erecting thereof.
That M. Chauncey strongly opposed the setting up of the rail and bench about
the Communion Table, and professed thereupon that he would leave the place, or
to that effect; and further gave out in speeches, that the parishioners had set
up that rail and bench of purpose to drive him away; with many other
indiscreet speeches, expressing his great dislike thereof. That the said M.
Chauncey and Humphry Parker labored to divert the parishioners of Ware, from
making and setting up of a rail and bench about the Communion Table. And that
the said H. Parker for his part, when the rail and bench were set up about the
Communion Table, and the Communion there celebrated by M. Craven, the now
Minister; and when as M. Craven had persuaded the communicants there to come up
to the Chancell to receive the holy Communion, refused so to do; that the said
Humphry Parker made a journey the time articulate from Ware to Marsten Lawrence
in Northamptonshire, to the dwellinghouse of M. Chauncey, being near fifty
miles distant from Ware, to speak with M. Chauncey; at which time M. Chauncey
upon conference had with Humphry Parker, promised to come to Ware, and
accordingly did so, and lodged at the house of the said Humphry Parker. That
the said M. Chauncey as well at his return to Ware, in the said Parkers house,
as at other times in other places, in presence of diverse of the parishioners of
Ware, used many reproachful speeches against the setting up of the said rail
and bench, in contempt of the just proceedings of his Ordinary, and the
lawfulness thereof, as the Court conceived and pronounced, (viz.) the said M.
Parker then and there speaking of the setting up of the said rail and bench,
affirmed, Note
that it was an Innovation, a snare to men's consciences, superstitious, a
breach of the second Commandment, an addition to Gods worship, and a block in
M. Cravens way, meaning and speaking of M. Craven now Vicar of Ware, who is a
learned and conformable Minister: and that the said M. Chauncey after the
setting up of the said rail and bench, took it in such ill part, that he never
ministered the holy Communion more there. That M. Parker derided the same rail
and kneeling bench thereunto affixed, and scoffed at the setting up thereof,
saying, it would serve far better purpose in his Garden, or to be set up in his
Garden, or to such like effect. All which the premises being well weighed and
considered of; and after mature the liberation had of all that was there said,
and enforced by the counsel of either side; the said M. Chauncey and Humphry
Parker were both of them pronounced guilty of a contempt against their Ordinary
and jurisdiction Ecclesiastical, and of raising a Schism and distraction in
the Parish of Ware, being a great and populous parish, by their opposition of
the laudable gesture of receiving the holy Communion kneeling, and their
envying against the Rail and bench, set up by sufficient authority for that
purpose about the Communion Table in the Chancel, for maintaining of good order
and conformity in the Church there, as may well appear, by M. Chaunceys
inveighing against the same, and his refusing to administer the holy Communion
there whilst he continued Vicar of Ware; for the which the said M. Chauncey in
partem p^nae, was by the Court suspended from the execution of his Ministerial
function, and every part thereof, and ordered so to stand, until by his
submission and acknowledgement Note.
of his error, in broaching the said opinions tending to schism and faction,
this Court shall see cause to release him: which his submission and his
acknowledgement is to be set down prescriptis verbis, by the Commissioners at
Informations, and to be delivered unto him under the Registers hand of this
Court, and to be by him read and performed here in open Court, and then to be
intimated and made known in the parish Church of Ware, where he has given such
cause of scandal and offense. He was further condemned in expenses or costs of
fuit which are to be moderately taxed by the Commissioners at Informations. And
the said Humphry Parker was likewise condemned in moderate charges or expenses,
and to make his submission in like manner, conceptis verbis, as this Court
shall appoint. Lastly, they were both ordered to stand committed till they
shall give sufficient bond in a 100 li. a piece to his Majesty's use, for the
performance of the order of the Court. And because it was alleged and
pretended on M. Chauncies behalf, that since his coming to be Person of
Marsten-Lawrence in Northamptonshire, he had in testofocation of his
conformity, set up, or caused to be set up such a Rail about the Communion
Table in the Chancell of his parish Church there, the Court decreed Letters to
be sent from this Court to the Lord Bishop of Peterborough, to desire his
Lordship to enquire of the truth of this allegation, and to certify this Court
of the truth thereof, the second Session of the next Term: As also how the
said Master Chauncey has otherwise conformed himself there to the orders of
the Church of England, here by law established.

The manner and form of M. Chauncies recantation the next court-day, for
speaking against the rail, is thus recorded in the High Commission Register.

This day the said Mr. Chauncey appeared personally, and with bended knees read
his submission in Court, which follows.

Whereas I Charles Chauncey Clerk, late Vicar of Ware, in the County of
Hertford, stand by sentence of this honorable Court legally convicted, for
opposing the Note.
setting of a rail about the Communion Table in the Chancell of the
Parish Church of Ware, with a bench thereunto affixed, for the Communicants to
resort unto, and to receive the blessed Sacrament there, kneeling upon their
knees, and for using invective speeches against the said rail and bench,
saying it was an Innovation, ^ snare to men's consciences, and a breach of the
second Commandment, an addition to the Lords worship, and that which has
driven me out of Town. I the said Charles Chauncey do here before this
honorable Court, acknowledge my great offense in using the said invective
words, and am heartily sorry for the same. I protest, Note.
and am ready to declare by virtue of mine Oath, that I now hold and am
persuaded in my conscience, that kneeling at the receiving of the holy
Communion is a lawful and commendable gesture; and that a rail set up in the
Chancell of any Church by the authority of the Ordinary, with a bench thereunto
affixed for the communicants, to repair unto to receive the holy Communion
kneeling, is a decent and convenient ornament for that purpose, and this Court
conceives, that the rail set up lately in the Parish Church of Ware, with the
bench affixed, is such an one. And I do further confess, that I was much to
blame for opposing the same, and do promise from henceforth, never by word or
deed to oppose either that or any other the laudable rites and ceremonies
prescribed and commanded to be used in the Church of England.

Charles Chauncey.

Which submission being thus as aforesaid read and subscribed by the said
Master Chauncey, his Counsel moved that he might be dismissed; but the
Counsel for the Office desired, that the said M. Chauncey might here receive w
judicial admonition, which the Court conceiving very fit and requisite, the
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, in the name of the whole Court, did now
judicially admonish the said Charles Note
Chauncey, from henceforth to carry himself peaceably and conformably to the
doctrine and discipline, rites and ceremonies established and commanded to be
used in the Church of England; and neither by word nor deed to oppose or bring
into disesteem any of them, with this intimation; That in case he were
convented again for any opposition or refractorinesse touching the premises,
that the Court intended to proceed against him with all severity, and with this
admonition the Court dismissed him the said M. Chauncey from any further
attendance touching this cause, he first paying the charges of suit taxed
against him, and the fees of his dismission.

These two leading cases and censures in the High-commissions, at York and
Lambeth, seconded with this enforced submission, struck such a terror into most
Ministers and Churchwardens in those parts, that few or none durst oppose those
Innovations; and gave such encouragement to the Prelates and popish Clergy,
that they proceeded vigorously in the pressing, introducing of them every
where; and if any man durst oppose or vary from their injunctions, they were
presently brought into the High Commission, and there proceeded against with
utmost rigor.

This was manifested by the case of Mr. Miles Burkitt, one of the Vicars of
Pateshall M. Burdits case.
in Northamptonshire; who for delivering the Sacrament only to some who refused
out of conscience to come up to the new Rail, and removing the Communion Table
at the Sacrament time into the midst of the Chancell without the rail,
according to the very Letter of Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions and the 82 Canon,
was apprehended by a Pursevant in the Year 1638, and thus Articled against in
the High Commission at Lambeth, by Sir John Lambs and the Archbishops means,
among whose papers his Articles were found, and read at the Lords Bar, being
attested by Master Prynne.

Inprimis, we Article and object to you the said Miles Burkitt, that you do
not bow at the Name of JESUS in time of Divine Service.

Item, we Article and object, that you the said Miles Burkitt, being enjoined
by the Ordinary or his Surrogates officiate for him, to keep within the rayles
at the ministering of the Sacrament, and to give the Sacrament to none that will
not come Note.
up to the rayles; he the said Miles Burkitt in contempt of his said Ordinary,
does come forth out of the said rayles, and does administer the Sacrament to
many that will not come up to the said rayles; Hocque fuit and est verum, etc.

Item, we Article and object, that you the said Miles Burkite, did consent,
procure, and abet Paul Gardner one of the Churchwardens of Pateshall in the
County of Northampton aforesaid, to remove and carry down forth of the rayles
the Communion Table into the body of the Chancell, and there did minister the
holy Sacrament Note.
on Easterday last past, and other times, notwithstanding the Articles of your
Diocesan to the contrary. Hocque fuit and est verum, etc.

Upon which Articles, this good Minister was for a long time vexed in the
Highcommission, and almost ruined.

From Ministers thus persecuted for opposing these Innovations of railing in
Communion Tables Altarwise, and administering the Sacrament at the Rayles, we
shall proceed to Churchwardens severally prosecuted, excommunicated, and
undone, for not railing in Communion Tables only, or removing them out of the
rayles.

We shall begin with the Churchwardens of Beckington in the County of Somerset,
whose case, by the testimonies of Mr. John Ash (a Member of the House of
Commons, The Churchwardens of Beckingtons case.
and Lord of that Parish) of M. William Long, and M. George Long (who solicited
the cause in the Churchwardens behalf) was manifested to be thus. The
Communion Table in the Parish Church of Beckington had for 70 years and more
stood in the midst of the Chancell, enclosed with a very decent
Wainscot-border, and a door, with seats for the Communicants to receive in,
round about it: In the year 1633. D. Pierce Bishop of Bath and Wels (a great
creature of Canterburies) appointed certain Commissioners to view the Churches
within his Diocese, and certify to him the defects thereof: who viewing the
Church of Beckington certified among other things, that there was not a decent
Communion Table in it, neither was it placed under the East window, nor railed
in otherwise then with a Border about it, where Nota.
the communicants kneel at the holy Communion, and that there were seats above
the Communion Table. To which Certificate the Churchwardens and Sidemen of
Beckington were ordered by the Bishop to return an answer under their hands
before Ascension-day 1634. which they did accordingly. After which the
Churchwardens were enjoined by the Bishop by word of mouth, to remove and rail
in their Communion Table Altarwise, against the East end of the Chancel: which
they refusing to do, conceiving it to be against the Rubric, Q. Elizabeth's
Injunctions, and the 82 Canon: thereupon James Wheeler, and John Fry,
Churchwardens, were on the 9 of June 1635. cited into the Bishops Court at
Wels, before William Hunt the Bishops Surrogate, and D. Duck his Chancelour;
for that the Communion Table in the Chancell of Beckington was not placed under
the East window of the Chancel, nor rayled in otherwise then with a Border
about it, and that there were seats above the said Table; who admonished them
to repair the said defects, and to place the Lords Table against the East wall
of the Chancell, with the ends of it North and South, as it stood in the
Cathedral Church at Wels, with a rail about it; and to certify that they had
done all this by the 6 of October following; At which day they were
excommunicated in open Court by the Bishop himself, for refusing to remove and
rail in the Table and pull down the said seats. Whereupon the Churchwardens
appealed to the Arches for relief, where after much waiting and solicitation,
they procured from Sir John Lamb, Dean of the Arches, a Letter to the Bishop
to absolve them for a time, which he did only for 27 days, admonishing them to
submit to what he had formerly enjoined them; for not doing whereof he
excommunicated them again in open Court on the 12 of January following.
Hereupon the Churchwardens appealed to the Arches the second time, and
petitioned the Archbishop for relief, to which Petition this Certificat under
the hands of about one hundred of the Parishioners was annexed.

To the most Reverend Father in God, and Right Honorable, William by Gods
providence, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate and Metropolitan ever all England.
We the Inhabitants and parishioners of Beckington in the County of Somerset,
do humbly certify, that the Communion Table of our Church of Beckington, has
and does stand in the midst of the Chancel, being the most convenientest place
(time out of mind) and beyond the remembrance of any of our parishioners now
living. And that near threescore years since the pavement of the said Chancel,
upon which the Communion Table stands, was new made, and in the new making
thereof, raised about a foot above the rest of the ground of the said Chancell,
and then also compassed about with a fair Wainscot border, in which there is
only one Wainscot door to come into the said Table, which door is kept fast,
and none does enter in thereat, but the Minister and such as he does require;
which said Communion Table does at the day of the date hereof, stand so
conveniently and decently as aforesaid. And we the said parishioners, with an
unanimous consent do humbly pray, That it may so continue freed from all
Innovation.

And so do humbly take our leaves, dated this 19 day of December, Anno Dom,
1635.
But notwithstanding this Petition and Certificate, the Archbishop refused to
admit of their Appeal, threatened them with the High Commission, and to lay
their Solicitour by the heels, commanding them to submit to and obey their
Diocaesan, who sent up all the proceedings in this cause to the Archbishop,
with several reasons why this Table should be removed, (found in the
Archbishops study by Mr. Prynne, endorsed with his own hand:) Whereupon they
were enforced to petition the King himself for relief; informing his Majesty,
That the Communion Table had continued as then it stood, by the approbation of
all the Archbishops and Bishops of that Diocese, during the reigns of Queen
Elizabeth, King James, and even eleven years in his Majesty's reign, as
appeared by a Certificate under the hands of almost an hundred of the
parishioners hands annexed to the Petition; desiring the Table might not be
removed: but the Archbishop by his power hindered them from receiving any relief
from his Majesty: upon what grounds and reasons, this Letter of the Bishop of
Bath and Wels to Sir John Lamb, will best discover.

Good Master Deane,
According to my promise in my Letter to you the last week, I have now sent
unto you a copy of all my proceedings in the cause, concerning the Chancel of
the Parishchurch of Beckington, and the placing of the Communion Table therein,
together with my reasons for the same, which I hope will give you full
satisfaction in this business; I have sent likewise a copy to my Lords Grace
of Canterbury; not that I think it worthy of his reading, or that he has
leisure to peruse it, but that it may lie by him; that when you speak with his
Grace about this, among other businesses, his Grace may have recourse to my
papers, if he think fit.

There are in my Diocese 469 Churches and Chapels, or thereabout, and the
Communion Tables are placed already in above 140 of them, as the Communion
Table is placed in our Cathedral Church here: I have begun and proceeded
herein Note.
in a persuasive way; some parishes were no sooner spoken to, but they obeyed;
other Parishes refused at the first, but they were quickly satisfied, and then
submitted; only the Churchwardens of Beckington, being encouraged and backed by
diverse of the parish, not so well affected to the government and rites of the
Church as they should be, are become obstinate, and will have the Chancell
ordered, and the Communion Table there placed as the parishioners shall think
fit, who also bear the charges of these Churchwardens, as they have confessed
unto me; which was the cause why they hasted so speedily to London, and stayed
so long there, about this business.

If these men have their wills, the example will do a great deal of harm, for
then many of the Parishes which have already conformed themselves to the
Cathedral Note.
will fall back, and other Parishes will never come on to this conformity, who
are now at a stand to see what will be done in the Chancell of Beckington. I
know your judgment and affection to the Church concurres with mine, and
therefore I am assured you will do nothing herein, but that which shall be for
the good of the Church and preservation of authority in all things just and

I pray, If D. Duck desire to read the copy of the proceedings and reasons
which I have sent you, let him borrow it of you, for it is fit my Chancelour
should be acquainted with these things, whose counsel and assistance must be
used therein. And so with remembrance of my true love, and best wishes to you,
I commend you to the grace of God, and rest

Wels 2 Ian. 1635.

Hereupon the poor Churchwardens being destitute of all relief, continued
excommunicated about a whole year, after which they were taken and imprisoned
in the common Jail, a long time, upon a Capias Excommunicatum: from whence at
last they were released by the Bishop, upon this ensuing submission and
penance, worse then any imprisonment.

A true Copy of the Penance that James Wheeler and John Frye were enjoined
unto by my Lord Bishop of Bath and Wels, examined by those whose names are
underwritten; Thomas Isles, John Bailly, George Long, William Webb.

Whereas the right reverend Father in God, William by Gods permission Lord
Bishop of Bathe and Wels, has heretofore lawfully required and commanded James
Wheeler and John Frye, late Churchwardens of the Parish Church of Beckington,
within the Dioces of Bathe and Wels aforesaid, to remove the Communion Table in
the Chancell of their said Parish Church; and to place it close under the East
wall of the said Chancell, in the same manner and form as the Communion Table
stands in the Cathedral Church in Wells aforesaid, and to remove the seats
placed above the said Table. And Note.
likewise whereas they the said James Wheeler and John Frye, contemned and
wilfully disobeyed the command of the said Reverend Father, and have in most
contemptuous manner stood excommunicated for their said contempt, for the space
of one whole year now last past, or there abouts, not regarding nor fearing
the dreadful Censure of the Church. And have likewise some days last past
stood aggravated, and have been signified unto the Kings most excellent Majesty
for the apprehending their bodies, and committing them to the Common-gaole of
the County of Somerset, the rather to compel them to their due obedience to
the lawful command of the Church: now upon the earnest request and submission
of the said Wheeler and Fry, the said Reverend Father has absolved them from
the said sentences, and enjoined unto them, that upon Sunday the 25 day of
June, in the year of our Lord God, one thousand six hundred thirty seven, they
in their usual apparel shall stand, first in the middle Ally in the
Parish Church of Beckington aforesaid, and there immediately after the reading
of the Gospel, shall openly and penitently with an audible voice, make this
acknowledgement following, repeating the same after the Minister, viz.

We James Wheeler and John Fry, do here before this Congregation assembled,
acknowledge and confess, that we have grievously offended the Divine Majesty
of Almighty Note
God, and the laws Ecelesiasticall of this Realm of England, in that we have
in contemptuous manner refused to remove the Communion Table in the Chancell of
the Parish Church of Beckington, and to place it close under the East wall of
the said Chancell, in the same manner and form as the Communion Table stands
in the Cathedral Church in Wels, and to remove the seats placed above the said
Table, being thereunto lawfully and judicially monished, and warned, by the
right reverend Father in God the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wels. And in that for
our contempts and disobediences, in not performing the said lawful command of
the said reverend Father, we have suffered our selves to be lawfully
excommunicated, and so to stand for the space of one whole year last past, or
thereabouts, not fearing nor regarding the dreadful censure of the Church. And
in like or rather more contemptuous manner have suffered our selves to be
lawfully aggravated and signified according to the laudable laws ^ statutes of
this Realm, thereby in a legal manner to compel us to our due obedience to
the lawful command of the Church. And we do hereby protest, that we are right
heartily sorry for the same, and we do faithfully promise, never from
henceforth to offend in the like again, but to demean our selves as shall
become good Christians and dutiful subjects: and we do ask God forgiveness
for this our sin and offense, and you all here present, for our evil example.

And we do desire you all to pray for us and with us to Almighty God, that it
may please him of his infinite goodness to forgive us of this our offense.

And then humbly and penitently kneeling down, must devoutly rehearse the
Lords Prayer, and they must certify hereof at Wels in writing, subscribed to
these presents, under the hands of the Minister and Churchwardens of Beckington
aforesaid, on Tuesday the 27 day of June aforesaid, together with this Schedule.

And the like penance is to be performed by the within named James Wheeler and
John Fry for the same offense in the Parish Church of Froom-felwood, within the
Dioces aforesaid, before the Pulpit or Ministers seat there, in manner and
form prescribed, on Sunday the 2 day of July Anno predict. And certificate
must be made of the due performance thereof as abovesaid, under the hands of
the Minister and Churchwardens there, upon Tuesday the fourth day of July
aforesaid, subscribed to these presents.

And the like penance is further to be performed by the said James Wheeler and
John Fry for the same offense in the Parish Church of S. Peter and Paul's in
Bathe, within the Dioces above mentioned, upon Sunday the ninth day of July
above written, and certificate is to be made accordingly, the 11 day of July
aforesaid.

The (...) submission made against these poor men's consciences did so afflict
them, that they never enjoyed themselves afterward, James Wheeler falling
presently after sick and dying, professing often on his death bed, that this
penance and submisson, so much against his conscience, had broken his heart,
and was the only cause of his sickness and death. The Bishop of Bathe and Wels
pretested, that he did nothing herein but by the Archbishops direction, with
which Mr. John Ash acquainting the Archbishop since his commitment to the
Tower, heacknowledged it to be (...), and that ^e did herein like an obedient
Dioces^^ to his Metropolitan.

What further tyrannical and (...) of proceedings were afterward used by this
(...) the Churchwardens and some of other Parishioners of Beckington for
opposing Mr. Huish their Minister in railing in the Communion Table, and
raising a new Mount at the East end of the Chancel, in a peaceable manner, we
shall further give in evidence in a more proper charge.

The next example we shall instance in, is the case of Ferdinando Adams, one of
the Churchwardens of S. Mary Tower Church in Ipswich, who together with his
fellow Ferdinando Adams his case.
Churchwarden Titus Camplin, was excommunicated by Henry Dade (one of the
Archbishops Substitutes in his Metropoliticall Visitation, and Surrogate to Sir
Nathaniel Brent) in the Archbishops own name, For not taking down the seats
standing above the Communion Table in this Church, and railing in the Table
Altarwise against the wall, as he was enjoined, by Sir Nathaniel Brent the
Archbishops Vicargenerall, Note,
in his Metropoliticall Visitation. This was proved by the Excommunication it
self, read in the Lords House in these following words.

Ferdinando Adams being thus excommunicated, sought to avoid this
Excommunication by an Appeal, but could procure no release; and being laid in
wait for by Pursevants out of the High Commission for suing Dade in the
Star Chamber, where this Excommunication was pleaded in Bar against him, he was
enforced to leave the Kingdom, and fly into New England till this Parliament,
almost to his utter undoing, as he attested upon oath, and shall be hereafter
more fully proved in another charge.

To this we shall subjoyne the case of John Premly one of the Churchwardens of
Ioh. Premly his case.
Lewis in Sussex, who was prosecuted in the High Commission Court, and there on
the 8 of May 1638. censured fined, imprisoned, condemned in costs of suit, and
ordered to make a submission, for that when as Sir Nathaniel Brent in the
Archbishops Metropoliticall Visitation, by injunction from the said Archbishop,
had ordered the Communion Table in the Church of Lewis to be placed North and
South at the upper end of the Chancel, and there rayled in, which was done
accordingly, Premly in a contemptuous manner had removed it from thence, unto
the place where it formerly stood; whereupon Dr. Nevel himself replacing it at
the East end of the Chancell North and South, according to the said Archbishops
Injunction, he presumed again to remove and bring it down to its ancient
place, to the great affront of his Graces Injunctions, and the ill example of
others. All which was manifested by the very sentence it self recorded in the
High Commission Register-book, which was read in the House of Peers to the
effect aforesaid.

The Committee of the Commons house alleged, that sundry other examples of
like nature, and of excommunicating hundreds of conscientious people for
refusing to receive the Sacrament at the new rayles, might be produced in most
Diocese of Englsand, but they would content themselves with these alone, and
that of Mr. Samuel Burrough^ of Colchester, which they should make use of upon
another occasion; and proceed to such who had been grievously censured in the
Star Chamber and High Commission by the Archbishops means for opposing,
defacing, or preaching against the use or setting up idolatrous Pictures of God
the Father, and Christ, and Saints in Churches, in direct opposition to our
Homilies against the peril of idolatry, (confirmed by the 39 Articles) and
contrary to our Statutes, Injunctions, Canons, and the current of all our
Orthodox writers.

The first president of this nature instanced in, was the case of Mr. Henry
Sherfield a Bencher of Lincolns-Inne, the true state whereof was briefly this.
M. Sherfield M. Hen. Sherfields case.
being Recorder of Sarum, a Justice of peace within that City, and an
inhabitant of S. Edmonds Parish there, took just offense at some pictures in
one of the glasse-windows in that Church, near unto his seat, and ever in his
eye: in which window was contained in old, rude, rusty painted glass, the
History of the Creation, not as it is related by Moses in the first Chapter of
Genesis, but after the Painters fancy; who in this window (consisting only of
four panes) had made no less then seven picturs of God the Father, in form of
a little old man clad in a blew and red coat, with a pouch by his side, about
the bigness of a Puppet; and preposterously placed the fourth days work of
creation before the third, and made that to be done on the fifth day, which was
created on the sixth: and in one place he had represented God the Father
creating the Sun and Moon, and squaring them out with a pair of compasses in
his hand, as if he had formed them by some Geometrical rules, and the help of
a Compass. To these pictures M. Sherfield and others had seen Ema Brown and
other old women make low courtesies, who being demanded why they made such
courtesies? answered, that they made them to their Lord God, and to God the
Father in the Glassewindow, which was proved by diverse Mr. Peter Thatcher
Minister of the Parish, and three others.
witnesses upon oath: Whereupon M. Sherfield being persuaded in point of
conscience, that these Idolatrous Pictures were directly forbidden by the
second Commandment, and many express Texts of Scripture, prohibiting any
representations of God the Father, condemned thus by the Homilies of our Church
against the Peril of idolatry, Part. 3. ^. 40. which determine that. The Image
of God the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghost, either severally, or the images
of the Trinity, be by the Scriptures expressly forbidden and condemned, as
appears by these places, Deuteronomy. 4. Isay 40. Acts 17. Romans 1. (there cited at
large) By these and many other places of Scripture, it is evident, that no
Image either ought or can be made to God. For how can God a most pure spirit,
whom man never saw, he expressed by a gross body, or visible similitude? or
how can the infinite Majesty and greatness of God incomprehensible to man's
mind, much more not able to be compassed with the sense, be expressed in a
SMALL and LITTLE IMAGE? (as this of God the Father was:) How can a dead and
dumb Image express the living God? etc. Wherefore an Image of God is not only
a lie, but a double lie also. But the Devil is a liar, and the Father of lies.
Wherefore the lying Images which he made of God, to his great dishonor and
horrible danger of his people, came from the Devil. Wherefore they be convict
of foolishness and wickedness in making of Images of God or the Trinity; for
no Image of God ought or can be made, yea, and once to desire an Image of God,
comes of infidelity, thinking not God here present, except they see some
sign or Image of him. And to be abolished out of Churches, by the resolution
of Queen Elizabethe Injunctions, the Canons, and Oxthodox Writers of our
Church, the Statutes of our Realm, and King James his own resolution in sundry
of his Works, moved the Parish at a Vestry where were six Justices of Peace
present, that he might have liberty to take down this offensive scandalous
Window, being a burden to his conscience, an occasion of much superstition and
idolatry to ignorant people, and the Church it self a Donative (as they
conceived) belonging to the parishioners, and to set up a new window of white
glass in its place; whereupon it was unanimously ordered by the Vestry, about
January 1629. and the Order entered, that if M. Sherfield thought fit he might
take down the painted old glass of this Window, and set up new. Whereupon not
long after, he did with his staff break or pick out some of those pieces of
glass representing God the Father, which amounted not to above the value of
six pence (the whole glass window not being worth forty shillings when it was
new) intending to new glaze the same. Whereupon by the Archbishops means and
instigation, an Information was exhibited against him in the Star Chamber, by
the Kings Attorney General, for breaking these idolatrous pictures, and that
in opposition of the Church Government established by law among us. This cause
was prosecuted with all rigor, and at last brought to a hearing on the 8 of
February 1632. where this Archbishop, then Bishop of London, (as was proved by
the Oaths of Master Tomlins, a Barrister of the Temple, M. Joseph Caryll,
Lecturer at Lincolnes Inn, and the testimony of M. Robert Nicholas a Member of
the Commons House, and a Commissioner in that cause) showed himself very
violent against M. Sherfield, made a long speech in defense of Images in
Churches, contrary to our Homilies, justified the picturing of God the Father
in form of an old man, out of that place of Daniel, where God is called, Dan.
9.
The ancient of days, which the Earl of Dorset refuted (being an expression
only of Gods eternity, declaring him to be before all times) and notwitstanding
it was proved by four witnesses, that those pictures were adored by diverse
persons, yet the Archbishop was so violent against Mr. Sherfield, that for
breaking of these idolatrous pictures (according to the doctrine of our Church
in the Homilies against the peril of Idolatry, Queen Elizabeth Injunctions,
and the statute of 3 and 4 E. 6. ca. 10. which were pleaded for his
justification) he agravated his offense to the utmost, from his Office, his
Age, his profession, and diverse other circumstances, instead of mittigating it,
fined him a thousand pound to the King, sentenced him to be removed from his
Recordership in that City, to make a public acknowledgement of his great fault
in the Parish Church where this was done, and in the Cathedral at Salisbury,
and to be bound to his good behavior; some of the Temporal Lords excused his
fact, spoke much against Images; and thought it fit to impose no fine upon him.
This Archbishop then concluded his speech against M. Sherfield, in
justification of Images, with these words, I have been the willinger to render
this ancount at this time, because some are ready to slander Us, as maintainers
of POPISH SVPERSTITION, and I know not what. This sentence gave great
encouragement to the setting up of superstitious idolatrous Pictures, Images,
and Crucifixes in our Churches, and discouraged most men from opposing the
intended introducing of them, which followed thereupon in sundry places.

To this we shall add the Archbishops tyrannical sentence and proceedings
against M. John Workman a godly painful Minister, Lecturer in the City of
Gloucester, for M. John Workmans case.
preaching against Images in Churches. This pious Minister being Lecturer in S.
Stephens Church in that City, was prosecuted for preaching publicly in a
Sermon there, That Pictures or Images were no more ornaments to a Church, then
Stews to a Common wealth: That for a man to have any Image of any Saint,
especially of our Savior in his house, is unlawful; and that if any man kept
such pictures in his house, if it were not flat Idolatry, yet it was little
better. This was the maine charge against him: to which was added, that he used
some harsh expressions against lacivious mixed dancing, especially on the Lords
day, citing only the words of the Hist. of the Waldens. par. 3. l. 2. c. 9.
Waldenses in their censure against Dancing, (borrowed from Speculum morale, l.
3. p. 9. did. 9.
Vincentius Belvacensis, and Summa virtutum and vitiorum. tom 2. Tit. de
luxuria. c. 3.
Gulielmus Peraldus, two Popish Writers of great note; and justified by Bishop
Babington in his exposition upon the seventh Commandment) and that he prayed
for the States of Holland the King of Sweden, and other Generals beyond the
seas in his prayer, before he prayed for the King that now is over us; which
was but according to the usual course of all or most Ministers, who first
prayed for the whole Catholic Church in general, next for the Protestant
Churches and Princes beyond the seas, and then for the Church and King of
England, and agreeable to the form of the very Common Prayer Book, in the
prayer for the whole state of Christ's Church, etc. which runs thus, We beseech
thee also to save and defend all Christian Kings, Princes and Governors,
(which comprehends all foreine Princes in the first place) and especially thy
servant Charles our King, etc. who is remembered last of all, but yet in a more
special manner. But these two last particulars, though mentioned in his
sentence, were no inducements to it, but only the first passage against Images,
which M. Workman justified out of diverse of our own English Authors, and the
very Homilies against the peril of Idolatry, Part. 3. p. 41. to 631. which
determine thus: That no Jmage of God, or the Trinity, or of Christ, may or
ought to be made; that such Images are not only defects but lies, and teach
nothing of God or Christ, but lies and errors. That Images placed publicly in
Temples, cannot possibly be without danger of worshipping and idolatry:
wherefore they are not publicly to be, or suffered in Temples and Churches,
etc.

We infer and say for the Adversative, that all our Images of God, our Savior
Christ, and his Saints, publicly set up in Temples and Churches, places
peculiarly appointed to the true worship of God, be not things indifferent nor
tolerable, but against Gods law and commandment, taking their own
interpretation and exposition of it. First, for that all Images so set up
publicly, have bin worshipped of the unlearned and simple sort, shortly after
they had been publicly so set up, and in conclusion of the wise and learned
also. Secondly, for that they are worshipped in sundry places now in our time
also. And thirdly, for that it is impossible that Images of God, Christ, or his
Saints, can be suffered (especially in Temples and Churches) any while or space
without worshipping of them, and that Idolatry which is most abominable before
God, cannot possibly be escaped and avoided, without the abolishing and
destruction of Images and Pictures in Temples and Churches, for that Idolatry
is to Images, specially in Temples and Churches an inseparable accident (as
they term it) so that Images in Churches, and Idolatry, go always both
together, and that therefore the one cannot be avoided except the other
(specially in all public places) be destroyed. Wherefore to make Images, and
publicly to set them up in the Temples and Churches, places appointed
peculiarly to the service of God, is to make Images to the use of Religion, and
not only against this precept, Thou shall make us manner of Images, but against
this also, Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them: for they being
set up, have been, be, and ever will be worshipped, etc. That it is not
possible if Images be suffered in Churches and Temples, either by the preaching
of Gods Word or by any other means to keep the people from worshipping of them,
and so to avoid idolatry, etc. What can we do, I say, or bring to pass to the
stay of Idolatry, or worshipping of Images, if they be allowed to stand
publicly in Temples and Churches? And if so many, so mighty Emperors, by so
severe Laws and Proclamations, so rigorous and extreme punishments and
executions, could not stay the people from setting up and worshipping of
Images, what will ensue think you, when men shall commend them as necessary
books of the Laymen? Let us therefore of these latter days learn this lesson
of the experience of ancient Antiquity, That Idolatry cannot possibly be
separated from Images any long time, but that as an unseparable accident, or as
a shadow follows the body when the Sun shines, so Idolatry follows and
cleaves to the public having of Images in Temples and Churches. And finally,
as Idolatry is to be abhorred and avoided, so are Images which cannot be long
without Idolatry, to be put away and destroyed. Besides the which experiments
and proof of time before, the very nature and origin of Images themselves
draws to Idolatry most violently, and men's nature and inclination also is
bent to Idolatry so vehemently, that it is not possible to sever or part
Images, nor keep men from Idolatry, if Images he suffered publicly, etc. For
if the origin of Images and worshipping of them, as it is recorded in the
eight Chap. of the Book of Wisdom, began of a blind love of a fond father,
framing for his comfort an Image of his Son being dead; and so at the last
men fell to the worshipping of him whom they did know to be dead: how much more
will men and women fall to the worshipping of the Image of God, our Savior
Christ, and his Saints, if they be suffered to stand in Churches and Temples
publicly. For the greater the opinion is of the majesty and holiness of the
person to whom an Image is made, the sooner will the people fall to the
worshipping of the said Image. Wherefore the Images of God, our Savior Christ
the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Apostles, Martyrs, and other of notable holiness,
are of all other Images most dangerous for the peril of Idolatry, and
therefore greatest heed to be taken, that none of them be suffered Note.
to stand publicly in Churches and Temples. For there is no great dread least
any should fall to the worshipping of Images of Annas, Caiphas, Pilate, or
Judas the Traitor, if they were set up.

But to the other, it is already at full proved, That Idolatry has been, is,
and is most like continually to be committed. Now as the Nature of mari is none
otherwise bent to worshipping of Images (if he may have them and see them) then
it 1 Cor. 6. 1 Cor. 4. Heb. 13.
is bent to whordome and Idolatry in the company of an harlot. And as a man
given to the lust of the flesh, seeing a wanton harlot, sitting by her, and
embracing her, it profitteth little for one to say beware of fornication, God
will condemn fornicators and adulterers: for neither will he, being overcome
with greater intisements of the strumpet, give ear or take heed to such godly
admonition, and when he is left afterward alone with the harlot, nothing can
follow but wickedness: Even so, suffer Images to be set in Churches and
Temples, ye shall in 1 John 5. 21. 1. Cor. 10. 14.
vain bid them beware of Images, as Saint John does; and flee Idolatry as the
Scriptures warn us: ye shall in vain preach and teach against Idolatry. For a
number will notwithstanding fall headlong unto it, what by the nature of
Images, and what by the Inclination of their own corrupt Nature.

Wherefore as for a man given to lust, to sit down by a strumpet, is to tempt
God. So is it likewise to erect an Idol in this pronesse of man's nature to
Idolatry, nothing but a tempting. Now if any will say, that this similitude
proves nothing, yet I pray them let the Word of God, out of the which the
similitude is taken, prove something. Does not the Word of God call Idolatry
spiritual fornication? Does it not call a gilt or a painted Idol or Image, A
strumpet with a painted face? Levit. 17. and 10. Numb. 25. Deuteronomy. 31. Barach 6.
Be not the Spiritual wickednesses of an Idols enticing, like the flatteries
of a wanton Harlot? Be not men and women as prone to spiritual fornication (I
mean Idolatry) as to carnal Fornication? If this be denied let all Nations
upon the earth which have been Idolaters (as by all stories appears) prove it
true. Let the Jews and the people of God, which were so often and so earnestly
warned, so dreadfully threatened, concerning Images and Idolatry, and so
extremely punished therefore, (and yet fell unto it) prove it to be true, as in
almost all the books of the Old Testament, namely, the Kings, and the
Chronicles and the Prophets, it appears most evidently. Let all Ages and
times, and men of all ages and times, of all degrees and conditions, Wisemen,
Learned-men, Princes, Idiots, unlearned and Commonalty prove it to be true. If
you require Examples; for wise men you have the Egyptians, and the Indian
Gymnosophistes, for the wisest men of the world, you have Solomon the wisest of
all other. For learned men the Greeks and namely the Athenians, exceeding all
other Nations in superstition and Idolatry, Acts 17. Romans 1.
as in the History of the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Paul charge them. For
the Princes and Governors, you have the Romans the rulers of the roast, (as
they say) you have the same sornamed King Solomon, and all the Kings of Israel
and Judah after him, saving David, Ezechias, and Josiah, and one or two more.
All these (I say) and infinite others, wise learned Princes and Governors,
being all Idolaters, have you for examples and a proof of men's inclination to
Idolatry. That I may pass over with silence in the mean time, infinite
multitudes and millions of Idiots and unlearned, the ignorant and gross
people, like unto horses and mules, Psalm. 32.
in whom is no understanding, whose peril and danger to fall on heaps to
Idolatry by occasion of Images, the Scriptures specially fore-shew and give
warning of. And indeed how should the unlearned, simple, and foolish, escape the
nets and snares of Idols and Images; in the which the wisest and best learned
have been so Wisd. 13. 14.
entangled, trapped and wrapped? Wherefore the Argument holds this ground
sure, that men be as inclined of their corrupt nature to spiritual
fornication, as to carnal, which the wisdom of God foreseeing, to the
General prohibition, that none should make to themselves any Image or
similitude; adds a cause, depending of man's corrupt nature, lest (says God)
thou being deceived with error, honor Deuteronomy. 4,
and worship them.

And of this ground of man's corrupt inclination, as well to spiritual
fornication Deuteronomy. 4.
as to carnal, it must needs follow, that as it is the duty of the godly
Magistrate, loving honesty and hating whoredom, to remove all Strumpets and
Harlots, specially out of places notoriously suspected or resorted unto of
naughty persons for the avoiding of carnal fornication; so it is the duty of
the same godly Magistrate, after the example of the godly Kings, Ezekias and
Josias, to drive away all spiritual Harlots (I mean Idols and Images)
especially out of suspected places, Churches, Aug. in Ps. 36. and 113. and l.
4. c. 3. De ci vitate Dei.
and Temples, dangerous for idolatry to be committed to Images placed there, as
it were in the appointed place and height of honor and worship (as S.
Augustine says) where the living God only (and no dead stones and stocks) is
to be worshipped. It is (I say) the office of godly Magistrates likewise to
avoid Images and Idols out of Churches and Temples, as spiritual Harlots out
of suspected places, for the avoiding of idolatry, which is spiritual
fornication. And as he were the enemy to all honesty that should bring
Strumpets and Harlots out of their secret corners into the public Market
place, there freely to dwell and practice their filthy merchandise; So is he
the enemy of the true worshipping of God, that brings Idols and Images into
the Temple and Church, the House of God, there openly to be worshipped, and to
rob the jealous God of his honor, who will not give it to any other, nor his
glory to carved Images; who is as much forsaken, and the bond of love between
man and him as much broken by Idolatry, which is spiritual Isay 42. 8.
fornication, as is the knot and bond of marriage broken by carnal fornication.
Let all this be taken as a lie, if the Word of God enforce it not to be true;
Cursed be the man says God in Deuteronomy, That makes a carved or molten
Image, and places it in a secret corner. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Thus Deuteronomy. 27.
says God, for at that time no man durst have or worship Images openly, but in
corners only: and the whole World being the great Temple of God, he that in any
corner thereof robs God of his glory and gives it to stocks and stones, is
pronounced by Gods Word accursed. Now he that will bring these spiritual
Harlots out of their lurking corners into public Churches and Temples, that
spiritual fornication may there openly of all men and women without shame be
committed with them, no doubt that person is accursed of God, and twice cursed;
and all good and godly men and women will say, Amen, and their Amen will take
effect also. Which is thus seconded in the second part of the Homily of the
place and time of prayer, p. 130, 131. The Jews in their time provoked justly
the vengeance of God, for that partly they abused his holy Temple with the
detestable idolatry of the Heathen, and superstitious vanities of their own
inventions, contrary to Gods Commandment, etc. And have not the Christians of
late days, and even in our days also, in like manner, provoked the
displeasure and indignation of Almighty God? Partly because they have profaned
and defiled their Churches with Heathenish and Jewish abuses, with Images and
Idols, with numbers of Altars too too superstitiously and intollerably abused,
etc. Finally Gods vengeance has been and is daily provoked, because much
wicked people pass nothing to resort to the Church, either for that they are
so sore blinded that they understand nothing of God and godliness; and care
not with divelish example to offend their neighbors; or else for that they see
the Church altogether scowred of such gay-gazing sights, as their gross
fantasy was greatly delighted with; because they see the false religion
abandoned, and the true restored; which seems an unsavory thing to their
unsavory taste, as may appear by this that a woman said to her neighbor: Alas
Gossip, what should we now do at Church, since all the Saints are taken away,
since all the goodly sights we were wont to have are gone, since we cannot
hear the like piping, singing, chaunting, and playing upon the Organs that we
could before? But (dearly beloved) we ought greatly to rejoice and give God
thanks, that our Churches are delivered out of all those things which
displeased God so sore, and filthily defiled his holy House, and his place of
prayer, for the which he has justly destroyed many Nations, according to the
saying of Saint Paul, 1 Cor. 3.
If any man defile the Temple of God, God will him destroy. And this ought we
greatly to praise God for, that such superstitious and idolatious manners as
were utterly naught, and defaced Gods glory, are utterly abolished; as they
most justly deserved: and yet those things that either God was honored with,
or his people edified are decently retained, and in our Churches comely
practiced, etc.

Mr. Workman, by all these and such other passages in our Homilies (ratified
and subscribed unto by all our Ministers in the 35 Article of our Church, as
containing a godly and wholesome doctrine necessary for these times; and
established by the statute of 13 Eliz. ca. 12. which confirms the Articles)
justified every syllable in his Sermons against Images (in which he used only
the words of our Homilies) yet notwithstanding by the Archbishops violence
against him (who went highest in his sentence) on the 25 of April 1635. in the
High Commission held at Lambeth, was Suspended from the execution of his office
and function in the Ministry, excommunicated, ordered to make his submission
and recantation of his eronious and scandalous doctrine, at Lambeth the next
Court day, in such manner and form as should be set down by the Commissioners,
and delivered to him in writing under the Registers hand of the Court; and
after this submission made publicly in Court, the same to be sent down to
Gloucester, and there openly published in the Cathedral Church of Gloucester,
and in the Church of S. Michaels immediately after Divine Service ended, when
as the Congregation shall be then and there assembled; and condemned in costs
of suit to be taxed the next Court day, and likewise imprisoned. Which sentence
of his for the cause a foresaid, was proved by the Register-Book of the High
Commission, out of which it was read at the Lords Bar; by the testimonies of
Mr. Thomas Pury, a Member of the House of Commons, and of Mr. John Langley,
late School master of Gloucester, and now of Pauls-Schoole in London; who
further witnessed upon oath, That Mr. Workman having been a most painful
diligent Preacher of Gods Word in the City of Gloucester for above 15 years, and
a man of singular piety, learning, wisdom, and moderation (as the Archbishop
himself confessed) the Corporation of Gloucester to help support his great
charge of children, in consideration of his great pains in preaching and
visiting the sick, about September, 1633. granted him an Annuity of 20 l. per
annum, under their Common Seal with one unanimous consent, a little before his
troubles in the High Commission. For which act of justice and charity, John
Buckston the then Mayor, Master Wise the Town Clerk, and some other of the
Aldermen of that City, were by the Archbishops procurement sent for by a
Pursevant, to appear before the Counsel Table as Delinquents; where they
appearing, were fully heard concerning the granting of this Annuity, before the
King himself and his Council, who seemed fully satisfied, approving of their
grant, and were ready to dismiss them from thence, as seeing no just cause for
their molestation: Whereupon the Archbishop moved, that they might be
transmitted from thence to the High Commission, which by his means was ordered
accordingly. After which, in January following, Mr. Pury himself, together with
M. Henry Brown, Mr. William Prise, Aldermen, Mr. Anthony Edwards, and others
were arrested by a Messenger out of the High Commission, who exacted and
received 20 Marks in Fees from them, to whom they gave bonds to appear in that
Court the Term following, which they did: Where they were then articled
against, for consenting to the grant of the said Annuity to Mr. Workman, to
which Articles they answered; and the cause being brought to hearing not long
after their Counsel alleged: That the said grant of 20 l. per annu^ to M.
Workman ought first to be proved illegal, or obtained by illegal practice, and
the whole Corporation, whose act it was, and under whose Seal it was granted to
be made parties to the suit, before these Defendants, sued only as private men,
ought, as they conceived, to be censured for consenting thereunto; or the said
deed, made void, and cancelled: yet notwithstanding the said Mr. Edwards and
one M. Nelme for consenting to this grant only, were fined 10 l. a piece, and
the grant ordered to be cancelled, which was done accordingly; and thereupon a
100. l. expense the rest were dismissed the Court, and M. Workman deprived of
his Annuity. After which M. Workman himself being censured and put from his
Ministry, and imprisoned by the High Commission, for Preaching against making
and setting up the Images of the Trinity, and of Christ and Saints in Churches;
having after some months Imprisonment, with much solicitation obtained his
Liberty, to support himself his wife and many small children from perishing,
was necessitated to teach children in private, having no other livelihood left
him after his former Annuity, granted him by the City of Gloucester, was by the
Archbishops potency, unjustly wrested from him; of which the Archbishop being
informed, inhibited him to teach any children at all in public or private, as
he would answer the contrary at his peril; whereupon he fell to practice
Physic for his necessary support: which being informed of to the Archbishop,
he thereupon prohibited him likewise to practice Physic: Whereupon he having
no means of subsistence left; and being debarred to Preach, teach School, or
administer Physic to maintain himself and his charge, was so afflicted with
these tyrannical and unjust pressures (of which he often complained to Master
Langley and others,) that they drew on crasinesse and sickness of body upon
him; and as his most intimate friends were verily persuaded, shortened his
days, and precured his death, to the great grief and loss of that City. So
zealous was this Arch-Prelate in defense of Idolatrous Images; as thus most
unjustly and tyrannically to ruin a most godly painful Minister with his
family, and destroy this living speaking Image of God and Christ, for preaching
against dead, false, unlawful, Images, and representations of them according
to our Homilies, and the established Doctrine of our Church.

Moreover it was then fully proved at the Lords Bar, by the oaths of Doctor
Featly, and Master Bourne, that the Archbishop was so mad upon Images,
Pictures, and their worship; That Doctor Featly having Printed by license, 70.
Sormons of his, preached upon several occasions, in one whereof he had cited a
passage against worshipping Images, out of the Homily against the Peril of
Idolatry, in refutation of the Papists; the Archbishop sending for the Doctor
commanded him to carry his said Sermons to Doctor Bray his Chaplain to peruse,
before they were published, least there should beany offensive passages vented
in them; which he doing accordingly, the said Doctor purged out of the 788.
page thereof, this ensuing clause therein cited out of the very Homely against
the peril of Idolatry, as scandalous, and heterodox, causing the whole sheet
to be new Printed, which expunction was openly read at the Bar by Doctor Featly
himself in these following words.

And howsoever some of late mince the matter, and bear us in hand that the
framing, drawing, carving, melting, gilding, erecting, clothing, and censing,
bowing down, and praying before Images and Pictures, is but the excrescencie of
Romish devotion, and no proper fruit of Idolatry and superstition: yet they who
laid the first stone in the happy Reformation of our Church of England and
penned the Homilies appointed by Authority to be read in all Churches condemn
these practices of the Roman Church, as no less idolatrous than the like of
the Heathen. Homily against the peril of Idolatry. Part. 3.
The full proof of that which in the beginning in the first part of this
Treatise was touched is here to be made good and performed, to wit, that our
Images and the Idols of the Gentiles be all one, as well in the things
themselves, as also in that our Images have been before, be now, and ever will
be worshipped in like form and manner, as the Idols of the Gentiles were, so
long as they be suffered in Churches and Temples: whereupon it follows, that
our Images in Churches have been, he, and ever will be, no other but abominable
Idols. And every of these parts shall be proved in order, as hereafter
follows. And first that our Images and the Idols of the Gentiles are all one
concerning themselves it is most evident, the matter of them being gold,
silver, or other mettle, stone, wood, clay or plaster, as were the Idols of
the Gentiles: and so being either melten or cast, either carved, graven, hewer
or otherwise formed and fashioned, after the similitude or likeness of man or
woman, they be dead and dumb works of men's hands; having mouths and speak not,
eyes and see not, hands and feel not, feet and go not, and so as well in form
as matter, be altogether like the Idols of the Gentiles: insomuch that all the
titles that be given to the Idols in the Scripture, may be verified of our
Images. Wherefore no doubt but the like curses which are mentioned in
Scriptures, will light upon the makers and worshippers of them both. Secondly,
that they have been and be worshipped in our time, in like form and manner as
were the Idols of the Gentiles, is now to be proved: and for that idolatry
stands chiefly in the mind, (which shall in this part first be proved) that
our Image-maintainers have had and have the same opinion and judgment of
Saints, whose Images they have made and worshipped, as the Gentile idolaters
had of their Gods. And afterward it shall be declared that our
Imagemaintainers and worshippers, have used and use the same outward rites and
manner of honoring and worshipping their Images, as the Gentiles did use
before their Idols: and that therefore they commit idolatry, as well inwardly
as outwardly, as did the wicked Gentile idolaters.

By these two evidences of the Archbishops persecuting Master Workman, for Nota.
using the very words and expressions of our established Homilies against
Images; and his Chaplains purging out of Doctor Featlies printed authorized
Sermons, this passage of our Homilies, against the worshipping of Images (no
doubt by his direction) it is most apparent, that his designs and intentions
were to subvert the established doctrine of our Church, against the setting up
and adoration of Images, and to defile our Churches again, not only with these
Romish Idols, and Paganish inventions, but to make us all Idolaters in
worshipping and adoring them, as the Popish or Gentile Idolaters did their
Idol-gods.

To put this out of question, we shall only add one irrefragable evidence more
concerning Images and Pictures. We have proved formerly that the Archbishop had
in his own private Study a Book of Popish pictures of the Life, Passion, and
Death of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Virgin Mary, printed by Boethius a
Bolswert in foreign parts, Anno 1623. These very Pictures were all licensed by
the Archbishops own Chaplain Doctor Bray; printed by his own printer and
Kinsman Badger, in the year 1638. for one Peake a Stationer (now in arms
against the Parliament) and publicly sold and bound up in Bibles; as was
testified by Mr. Walley Clerk of Stationers Hall, and Michael Spark Senior.
Master Willingham likewise attested upon oath concerning these Pictures and
Crucifixes put into the Bibles: that Captain Peak at Holborne Cundit,
Bookseller, who printed these pictures for Bibles, did affirm, that he printed
them with the good liking, and by the special direction of the Archbishop, and
his Chaplain Dr. Bray: which Dr. Bray, as he said, carried him diverse times to
the Archbishop, to show him the prints thereof, as they were cut and finished,
who liked them all well, and gave his consent for the binding them up in
Bibles; saying, Note.
That the Bibles wherein these pictures were bound up, they should be called
THE BISHOP OF CANTERBVRIES BIBLES; (stiling them after his own name, so much
did he own this fact, not the Bibles and Book of God, who abhorres such
Images:) and further deposed, That he found two Bibles bound up with these
Pictures in them, the one among Secretary Windebanks, the other among Sir John
Lambs and Dr. Ducks chief papers and treasure (two of the Archbishops bosom
friends and favorites) who highly esteemed them: both of which Bibles seized
by Mr. Willingham, and richly bound up with these pictures in them, were then
Note.
produced and showed to the Lords. Master Walley further deposed, that these
pictures bound up in Bibles giving great offense and scandal to many well
affected people, himself with some other Stationers repaired to Lambeth to the
Archbishop and complained against these pictures, and the binding of them up in
Bibles, demanding his Graces direction therein; whether they should seize such
Bibles with pictures which gave offense, or suffer them to be sold? To which
the Archbishop answered, That they might do well not to lay them out publicly
upon their stals to be sold as yet, lest they should give offense; but if any
come to ask for them or to buy them in your shops, in Gods name sell them
freely to them, without any scrupple; adding the second time, sell them to such
in Gods name, but lay them not upon your stals in public view. Upon which
testimony the Archbishop demanded of Mr. Walley, who it was that gave him this
direction concerning the sale of those Bibles with pictures? To which he
readily replied; Your Grace with your own mouth, as you may well remember.
Whereunto the Archbishop answered, it was true, he did so; but the pictures
were printed and bound up with Bibles before he knew of it; and that the first
time he saw one of these Bibles, was in a Ladies hand in the Chapel at
Whitehall; which he looking upon, when he came to Lambeth, sent for one of
those Bibles himself; after which, the Stationers coming unto him about the
sale of them, he gave them such directions as aforesaid, not to sell them
openly for fear of giving offense, but only privately in their shops to such as
asked for them: As most evident confession of guiltiness. For if such pictures
in Bibles were good and useful, why should they not be exposed to open sale,
and the view of all men? if ill and unlawful, why should any of them be
printed, or sold to any in private, and not totally suppressed, demolished,
burnt? being contrary to our Statutes, Homilies, Writers, and the received
Doctrine of our Church? These directions then of his, shows his good affection
to popish and idolatrous pictures: he had polluted his own English Bible with
an embroydred Crucifix on its cover, before these Pictures printed; and now he
would corrupt, pollute all our Bibles and New Testaments with these Romish
Images bound up in them, to which they are most repugnant. He would suffer no
English Bibles to be printed or sold with marginall Notes to instruct the
people, all such must be seized and burnt, as we shall prove anon: but himself
gives special approbation for the venting of Bibles with Popish pictures taken
out of the very Mass book, to seduce the people to popery and idolatry.

The last case we shall instance in touching the Archbishops persecuting of
such who opposed his Popish Innovations, is the cases of Dr. John Bastwick a
Physician, Dr. Bastwicks, Mr. Prynnes, and Mr. Burtons Cases.
and Mr. William Prynne a Lawyer, Mr. Henry Burton a Divine: who were all
brought into the Star Chamber by this Archbishops prosecution, and there most
inhumanely censured for opposing his popish Innovations, in Trinity Term 1637.
In which case all the injustice, oppression, and cruelty that could be
imagined, were combined both in the proceedings, sentence, and execution, not
to be paralleled in any age, as will appear by the ensuing particulars,
attested by the several oaths of M. Prynne, M. Burton, Sir William Belfore,
M. Tomlins, M. Sap, M. Wickins, Mistress Bastwick and others; backed with
the Orders and Decree of the Court it self. First M. Burtons house was broken
open by force by a Sergeant at Arms, his Study ransaked, his person
appreheaded and committed close Prisoners long before any in formation against
him, contrary to Magna Charta, and the Petition of Right, and so continued
without Bail, during all the time of the prosecution against him. Secondly,
though the information against them three was joint, and license granted them
to repair to Counsel with their Keepers, by an Order of the whole Court; yet
they were denied liberty to confer one with another, even with their Counsel
themselves, or to make a joint answer or defense, and soon after restrained all
access to Counsel by a verbal Order. Thirdly, the Counsel assigned to them
were so terrified and threatened, that they durst not draw or sign any answer
for them: who thereupon petitioning the Court for liberty in their Counsels
default to put in their answers under their own hands, according to former
presidents and orders of that Court, they were absolutely denied this right and
justice, contrary to law and presidents. Dr. Bastwicks answer under his own
hand left at the Office, and another copy of it tendered and left in open Court
rejected, and he taken pro confesso, for a pretended contempt in not putting in
his answer under Counsels hand. Fourthly, Mr. Prynnes Chamber in the Tower, by
a special direction from the Archbishop, was searched by Mr. Nicholas Clerk of
the Council, and a Pursevant of the Archbishops, who supervised Mr. Nicholas,
and was more active, peremptory then he, not leaving the very Close-stoole
unsearched; his instructions for his answer seized and carried away by them,
himself shut up close prisoner; pen, ink, and paper to draw either his answer
or new instructions for his Counsel denied him; his Clerk that solicited his
business seized on by a Messenger, and kept close prisoner, of purpose to
hinder him from following his Masters business; examined frequently by the
Kings Attorney and Sollicitour to pick out some crime or accusation against his
Master, and never admitted to return unto him (though he tendered sufficient
bail for his forth-comming, and no accusation was then pending against him) no
not to attend him during his sores after execution of the sentence on him.
Fifthly, M. Prynne was denied all access to Counsel; liberty to draw up and
sign his own answer (though a Counselor at Law) in default of Counsel;
albeit he twice petitioned the Court to have leave to do it, producing sundry
reasons and presidents in that Court to warrant it; yea the very Clerk that
writ but a Petition from his mouth by the Lieutenants permission, that he might
put in his answer under his own hand, was for this very cause seized on by a
Pursevant, and molested diverse weeks after. Sixthly, when Mr. Holt, (Mr.
Prynnes assigned Counsel) had by direction of the Court taken his fee, drawn
his answer, and given order for the engrossing of it, promising to sign it the
next morning, he was privately commanded not to sign it; and thereupon refused
the signing of it, contrary to promise, alleging that he had order given him
to the contrary, and that he durst not do it for an hundred pieces: After which
M. Tomlins another of M. Prynnes Counsel signing his answer, it was refused
both at the Star Chamber office and in open Court, where it was tendered, upon
pretense it came too late, and Mr. Prynne taken pro confesso, for a supposed
contemptuous refusal to answer; when as they would neither permit him to put
in an answer under his own hand; and ordered one of his assigned Counsel not
to sign his answer when engrossed contrary to his promise, nor accept it, when
signed by another of his Counsel, and twice tendered. Seventhly, Mr. Burtons
Answer, when drawn, engrossed, and subscribed by M. Holt (his assigned
Counsel) by order of the Court, and accepted at the Office without any
exception against it, was after nine days space, when perused by the
Archbishop, pretended to be scandalous, and thereupon referred to the two
chief Justices, Sir John Bramston and Sir John Finch, who gave it such a
purgation without calling M. Burton to it, or suffering his Counsel to defend
it (whom Sir John Finch threatened with pulling his Gown over his head and
putting him from the Bar) as was never heard of in any Age; expunging no
less then 64 whole sheets (containing his justification and defense) out of
it, as scandalous, leaving only some three lines in the beginning of it, and
two in the end, amounting to a general not guilty, when as he confessed and
justified all he was charged with: And because Mr. Burton would not acknowledge
this purged answer, directly contrary to that he put in upon oath, and answer
to Interrogatories grounded on it, quite contrary to his answer as they had
altered it, whereby he must of necessity have been perjured: therefore he was
likewise taken pro confesso, and censured for a contempt in not answering,
though he had an answer in Court. What the scandalous matter contained in, and
expunged out of his answer by the Judges was, is very observable: truly it was
no other then the very Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, prescribed by
several Acts of Parliament; (engaging the Defendants and others who had taken
them against popery and popish Innovations;) his Majesty's Declarations before
the 39 Articles, and to all his loving Subjects, printed Anno 1628. prohibiting
all backsliding to Popery, or any Innovations or alterations in the Religion
by law established among us: The Petition of Right, and his Majesty's Answer
thereunto, for preservation of the Subjects rights and liberties; (extending as
well to secure them against these illegal popish Innovations which the Bishops
by an Arbitrary power would obtrude upon them and their consciences by
Suspensions, Excommunications, Fines, Imprisonments, and other vexatious
courses; as to the liberty of their persons and estates of which they were
deprived for opposing their Innovations): the statute of 3 Iac. c. 1.
entitled, An Act for a public thanksgiving to Almighty God every year on the
5 of November, for the great deliverance of the King, Kingdom, State and
Parliament, from the horrid Gunpowder Treason, (on which day Mr. Burton
preached these two Sermons, against the several Popish Innovations and
Doctrines mentioned in it, lately brought into the Church by the Archbishop and
his confederates, for which he was questioned in the Star Chamber.) The statute
of 3 Jac. cap. 4. entitled, An Act for the better discovering and repressing
of Popish Recusants. The statute of 1 Eliz. cap. 2. entitled, An Act for the
uniformity of Common Prayer, and administration of the Sacraments; which
excludes all new Ceremonies and Innovations in Gods service, introduced by the
Bishops, not comprised in the Book of Common prayer; with an enumeration of
those several Innovations, in point of doctrine and ceremonies, (as setting up
Altars instead of Communion Tables, removing Lords Tables from their ancient
stations, and railing them in Altarwise against the wall, bowing down to them,
reading second Service at them; licensing, printing Popish and Arminian Books,
altering and purging the Books for the Gunpowder Treason, for the public Fast,
Coronation, and Book of Common prayer, etc.) with other particulars specified
at large in his printed Sermons. All this was totally expunged as scandalous
out of Mr. Burtons Answer, for fear the proof thereof should have made the
Bishops scandalous. Eighthly, these Defendants, when they perceived they should
not have liberty to defend themselves, nor to prove or justify the Archbishops
and his Confederates popish Innovations by their Answers, exhibited a cross
Bill against them under their hands, which they offered to make good at their
uttermost perils, Mr. Prynne tendering the same both to the Lord Keeper, and in
open Court, defiring it might be admitted, being both for their own just
defense, the honor of his Majesty, and preservation of our Religion, and that
a Court of public justice which ought to be as open for, as against them: yet
this their Bill was twice refused without cause, and delivered over to Mr.
Attorney General to draw up a Charge against the defendants out of it, if
possible, and to question them for their lives for exhibiting it. Ninthly, at
the hearing, the Archbishop and Bishop of London though chief prosecutions of
this cause, in which they were specially concerned, professed enemies to the
Defendants, and challenged in open Court by Mr. Prynne as unfit to sit Judges
there in their own cause, contrary to all law and presidents, were yet admitted
to sit in Court as Judges; where the Archbishop himself in a tedious Oration of
two hours long (larger then ever any Sermon he preached in the Pulpit)
professedly justified all the forementioned Innovations wherewith he was
charged; as Setting up Altars, railing in Communion Tables Altar-wise, reading
second-Service at them, bowing down toward them, as the Monks and Popish
Friars did of old, because there it is Hoc est corpus meum, etc. standing up at
Glory be to the Father, bowing at the Name of Jesus, altering and purging the
Books for the Gunpowder Treason and the public Fast, in favor of Papists, the
licensing of Popish and Arminian Books, charged against him, etc. And yet
reviled, condemned these Defendants, as Libellers, and thanked the Lords for
their justice against them for falsely objecting these very Innovations to him,
which himself in his Speech confessed himself guilty of, justified in open
Court, and after that in print to all the World; dedicating this his Speech to
his Majesty, and making him the Patron of all these Innovations, contrary to
his own royal Protestations. Tenthly, these Defendants, for opposing those
very popish Innovations which himself thus publicly confessed, defended, being
deprived of their proof and just defense by taking them all pro confesso, for
a pretended contempt, in not answering the Information, (which they would not
permit them to put in their Answers to, as you heard before) were without any
proof or testimony at all produced to prove them guilty of ought objected
against them, fined 5000 li. a piece unto his Majesty, adjudged to stand in the
Pillory at Westminster, and there to lose their Ears, which was accordingly
executed, Mr. Burton was after deprived of his Living. degraded from his
Ministry, Mr. Prynne stigmatized on both cheeks, though nothing at all was
charged against him; and all of them deprived the liberty of pen, ink and
paper; and before their wounds were healed, they were sent away close prisoners
to the 3 remote Castles of Lanceston, Lancaster, and Carnarvan, and there shut
up close prisoners, neither Wife, nor Child, nor Brother, nor any other but
their Keepers having any access unto them: and soon after by extraordinary
Letters from the Council Table (to which the Archbishops hand was first) sent
close prisoners by Sea in the Winter-season, to the hazard of their lives into
the Islands of Sylly, Garnesey and Iarsey, and there mued up close prisoners
without pen, ink, paper, or allowance of necessaries, their friends being
prohibited al access unto them, and D. Bastwicks and M. Burtons Wives
especially restrained so much as to set footing in the Islands where they were
close imprisoned, under pain of imprisonment: so penal and fatal was it for
them to oppose the Archbishop in these his Innovations, who detained them thus
close prisoners in exile till they were released by this present Parliament.
That this prosecution was by the Archbishops instigation, was evidenced. First,
by the Testimony of Mr. John Cockshute, then servant to Sir John Banks, his
Majesty's Attorney General, to whom he committed the prosecution of all
Star Chamber businesses; who attested upon oath; that the Archbishop gave him
direction, for drawing the Information against Doctor Bastwick, Mr. Burton, and
Mr. Prynne, and that he was commanded to give an account to him of all the
proceedings therein, which he did from time to time, either to himself in
person, or to his Chaplains, by his direction. Secondly, by the Copies of
Doctor Bastwicks and Mr. Burtons Answers found in his study by Mr. Prynne, the
first whereof was disalowed and would not be admitted though twice tendered; the
second expunged by the Archbishops direction, who had drawn a line with black
lead under all that which should stand in Mr. Burtons Answer, as appeared by
the Copy it self produced at the Bar, giving Order to expunge the residue,
which was done accordingly. Thirdly, by the whole Tenor of his speech in
Star Chamber, especially this latter clause thereof, page 77. I humbly crave
pardon of your Lordships, for this my necessary length, and give You hearty
thanks for Your noble patience, and your just and honorable censure upon these
men, and your unanimous dislike of them, and defense of the Church. But because
the business has some reflection upon my self, I shall for bear to censure
them, and leave them to Gods mercy, and the Kings Justice. And by his ensuing
Epistle to his Majesty prefixed to this Speech. Fourthly by Subsequent Motions
and Warrants under his hand, for their Exile and close Imprisonment, in which
he was only active and inexorable.

What great encouragement and hope of a relapse to Popery; the Archbishops
introducing of Altars, Crucifixes, and other forementioned Innovations gave to
Jesuits, Papists, and what was his real design in promoting them, we shall
evidence by two notable passages, in two late English Jesuits printed books.

The first, entitled, A Paraphrasticall and devout Discourse upon the Psalm,
Miserere, written by Chapter M. (an English Jesuit, as appears by the Jesuits
Badge in the Frontispiece of it) printed and licensed at Doway 30 Maii 1635.
wherein there is this passage in the Epistle to the Reader, Thesemy
Paraphrasticall, Discourses and pitiful lamentations of King David, I intend
for all sinners in England, as well Catholics as not Catholics, of what
religion soever, I being a debtor to all: and because I would have them all
peruse these Discourses, I abstain from controversies in religion, lest I
should avert any from the reading of them: only in paraphrasing the two last
verses of this Psalm, occasion being offered, I speak of the unbloody and
daily Sacrifice of the Altar, but so, that I rather touch it then handle it,
mention it, then treat of it, suppose it, then prove it in that manner as I
might; hoping that this doctrine NOW will not be distasteful (mark the Reason:)
For seeing now in England in very many Churches, Altars, which heretofore were
thrown down, are again erected, according to the laudable example and pious
use and custom of the Note.
Catholic and even Primitive Church, to aver a true Sacrifice will not be
ill taken; because to allow of Altars, is to allow of a true Sacrifice which
uses to be offered on them; an Altar and a true proper Sacrifice being
Co-Relatives, of which the one infers the other; and so the one cannot be
averred without the other, nor the one denied without the other. Lo here we
have the true reason why the Archbishop was so zealous for Altars; even to
bring in the Papists unbloody and daily sacrifice of the Mass.

The second book was inscribed, A direction to be observed by N. N. written by
an English Jesuit, and printed secretly by him in London (as was supposed) An.
1636. wherein, after some applauses of the Archbishop, whom he propounded as a
Pattern of imitation for all others in England, in prohibiting the sale of
books tending to Socinianisme, p. 14. (which he p. 16. interprets to be
Protestantisme,) p. 20. 22. he proceeds thus: And to speak the truth what
learned judicious man can after unpartiall examination embrace Protestantisme:
Which now waxes weary of it self? Its professors, (they especially of
greatest worth, learning, and authority,) declare themselves to love temper and
moderation; allow of many things which some years ago were usually condemned
as Superstitious and Antichristian: and are at this time more unresolved where
to fasten, then in the infancy of their Church: For do not the Protestant
Churches begin to look with another face? their walls to speak (by Images,
Crucifixes, Laymens books,) with another language: their Preachers to use a
sweeter tone? their annual public Tenants in the Universities to be of
another style and matter? their books to appear with Titles and Arguments which
once would have caused much scandal among the Brethren? their Doctrine to be
altered in many things, and even in those very points for which their
progenitors forsook the then visible Church of Christ? their 39 Articles, the
Sum, the Confession, and almost the Creed of their faith are patient:
patient! that is they are ambitious of some sense wherein they may seem to be
Catholic, (that is of that Romish sense which Franciscus a Sancta Clara, thrice
printed in England, and presented by the Archbishop to his Majesty, has put
upon them in his Commentary on them:) to allege wife, and children in these
days, is but a weak plea for a married Minister to compass a Benefice: Fiery
Calviaisme, once a Darling in England, is at length accounted Heresy, yea, and
little less then Treason (by the Archbishop and his Brethren, in their censure
of Dr. Bastwick in the High Commission:) Men in word and writing willingly use
the once fearful names of Priests and Altars: nay if one do but mutter against
the placing of the Altar after the old fashion, for a warning he shall be well
warned with a Cole from the Altar; (over against which there is this marginall
note, A little book so entitled, printed 1636.) English Protestants are now

Canon, they are bound to follow the ancient Fathers: And to conclude all in
one main point, The Protestant Church in England pofesseth so small antiquity,
and so weak subsistence in it self, that they acknowledge no other visible

Churches and Chapels after the Popishmanner.
Rome. These were the advantages the Papists, Jesuits, and Popish party made of
the Archbishops Romish Innovations, formerly proved.

We shall next proceed to other Innovations of this nature, somewhat different
from the former, to wit, to his Consecrating of Churches and Chapels after the
popish manner, wherein the case stands briefly thus. The Pope and his Romish
Prelates had in times of ignorance and superstition, for their own proper
lucre, introduced solemn consecrations of Churches, Chapels, with all
furniture belonging to them, and appropriated these Fopperies to Bishops, as a
jurisdiction peculiar to them alone; though we read in Scripture, that the
Tabernacle and all the furniture thereto belonging was consecrated only by
Moses, and the Temple at Jerusalem by King Solomon, the chief temporal
Magistrates; not by Aaron or the High Priests, as they were among the Romans by
the Senate. These forms of consecrations, full of Ethnicall ridiculous
superstitions, exorcismes, and conjurations, were contained only in Roman
Pontificals, Missals, Ceremonials, which were wholly abolished upon the
reformation of Religion in King Edwards days, by the express statutes of 3
and 4 E. 6. cap. 1. 5. 5 and 6 E. 6. cap. 1. and after that by the statute of 1
Eliz. cap. 2. 8 Eliz. cap. 1. which abrogited all rites, ceremonies, and
consecrations whatsoever, but those comprised in the Books of Common Prayer and
Ordination of Ministers; where there is not one syllable to be found touching
consecration of Churches or Chapels, or Churchyards, nor any form of such
consecrations retained or prescribed, which by these Acts were wholly
discontinued and abolished in our Church, till this Papish Prelate to renew
them, and to assume a Papal power of making Churches, Chapels, Altars, and
their furniture, holier then other places, by his solemn consecrations of
them; as if the mere sequestring of them from a common or profane, to a
sacred use, were not a sufficient consecration of them without a Bishops
Benediction, and exercising of those creatures suspended thereunto. The
Archbishops Innovations in consecrating Churches and Chapels.


We shall begin first with his consecration of Churches, next of Chapels, Anno
1630. St. Katherines Creed-church in London being repaired only by the
parishioners, not new built from the ground, when Mountain was Bishop of
London, and the Church thought holy enough by him without any new consecration,
not requisite in such a case by the very Canon law; this popish Prelate
succeeding Mountaiue in the Bishopric of London suspended this new repaired
Church for a time from all Divine service, Sermons, and Sacraments, till it was
re-consecrated by himself; of which he writ down this special memorial with
his own hand in his Diary, read in the Lords House in manner following; January
16. 1630. Sunday I consecrated S. Katherine Creed-church in London: In what a
popish, ridiculous, bedlam manner, was thus attested upon oath by M. Willingham
a parishioner there, who then took special Notes of all the passages in
short-writing, thinking some good use might be made thereof in aftertimes, the
particulars whereof he thus expressed.

That the Archbishop (then of London) on the 16 of January 1630. being the
Lords day, came in the morning about nine of the clock in a pompous manner to
Creedchurch, accompanied with Sir Henry Martin, Dr. Rive, Dr. Duck, and many
His manner of consecrating Creed-Church.
other High-commissioners and Civillians, there being a very great concourse of
people to behold this novelty: the Church doors were guarded with many
Halberders; at the Bishops approaching near the West door of the Church, the
hangbies of the Bishop cried out with a loud voice, Open, open, ye everlasting
doors, that the King of glory may enter in; and presently (as by miracle) the
doors flew open, and the Bishop with three or four great Doctors and many
other principal men entered in; and as soon as they were in the Church, the
Bishop fell down upon his knees with his eyes lifted up, and his hands and
arms spread abroad, uttering many words, and saying, This place is holy, and
this ground is holy: In the Note.
name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost I pronounce it holy; and
then he took up some of the earth or dust and threw it up into the air (as the
frantic perseenting Jews did, when they were raging mad against Paul): this
was done in the great middle Isle several times as they came up Eastwards
toward the Chancel, which Chancel was then paved: when they approached near to
the Rail and Lords Table, unto which was an ascent of two or three steps, the
Bishop lowly ducked and bowed toward it some five or six times; and returning,
went round about the Church in Procession on the inside thereof, they saying
the 100 Psalm, and after that the 90 Psalm, (prescribed in the Roman
Pontifical for this purpose, p. 262.) and then this Prayer.

Lord Jesu Christ, who art the eternal Word, of thy eternal Father, God
Almighty to be blessed for ever, and did at first in the beginning of time
create man out of the dust of the earth, to restore and repair in him the ruin
and fall of Angels: and when as he by transgression had lost his original
state, did according to thy threatening return him again unto his dust,
but so, that he should not perish everlastingly, but should in due time by an
omnipotent power be raised again out of the earth; and therefore in assurance
of the resurrection, the bodies of men, the work of thine own hands, are in
this place to be deposited in their sepulchers, graves, or vaults, as in a
repository or resting place until the end of all things, when that mighty
Arch-angell shall sound his last Trumpet, with, Rise ye dead and come to
judgment; accept we beseech thee this our holy service, who do give and
consecrate this beautiful Church unto thee; and we separate it unto thee and
thy Church AS HOLY GROUND, not to be profaned any more to common use; this we
beseech thee to accept at our hands for Christ Jesus sake, etc.

Then was read aloud the 23 chapter of Genesis; which being read, then followed
another prayer, taken almost verbatim out of the Roman Pontifical, beginning
thus.

Merciful God, the resurrection and the life of all that trust in thee, we
most humbly entreat thee, to vouchsafe us of thy grace, that all those thy
servants who from hence forth shall come into, or be intered within the Circuit
of this holy and sacred place, now by our service HALLOWED unto thee, may so
lead their lives in thy fear, that they may leave them in thy favor; and that
their bodies resting in their Sepulchers in this Church in peace, until thy
coming unto Judgment, may rise again unto immortal life, and live with thee
for ever in those glorious mantions of eternity: Hear us O Savior for thy
passion sake; hear us O Father for thy Christ's sake; hear us O Sanctifying
Spirit for thy comforts sake, who live and reignest one God: etc. Then, The
peace of God followed. etc.

After all this, the Bishop betook himself, to sit under a cloth of State in
an Isle of the chancell near the Communion Table, and taking a written book in
his hand, (in imitation of the Roman Pontifical and the Council of Trents
Decrees therein cited page 247, etc.) He pronounced many curses upon all those
which should hereafter any way profane that holy and sacred place, by any
Musters of Soldiers, or keeping any Were not their spiritual Bawdy-courts
commonly kept in Churches such.
profane Law-courts, or carrying burdens through it; At the end of every curse
(which were some 20.: or 30. in number,) he bowed himself lowly toward the
East or Table (saying, Let all the people say, Amen). When the Curses were
ended, he then pronounced the like number of Blessings to all those that had
any hand in the culture, framing and building of that holy, sacred and
beautiful Church, and pronounced Blessings to all those that had given any
Challices, Plate, Ornaments, or Vtensills, and that should here-after give any.
At the end of every Blessing he also bowed down himself toward the East,
Saying; Let all the people say, Amen.

After this followed the Sermon, which was worthily performed by Dr. Stephen
Dennyson, he taking for his theme the 19 of Luke 46. wherein he bitterly
inveighed against setting up Pictures and Images in Churches; saying, it was
Popish and heathenish Superstition and Idolatry Which Sermon after-wards when
Bishop Laud came to the high chair of Canterbury he remembered at Dr. Dennysons
censure in the high Commission upon another occasion, and passed a heavy
Censure upon the said Dr. under which he has ever since groaned.

After the Sermon which was but short, the Bishop and two fat Doctors
consecrated and administered the Sacrament, with a number of bowings, duckings
and cringeings; in manner following.

(As first) when the Bishop approached near the Communion Table, he bowed with
his nose very near the ground some six or seven times; Then he came to one of
the corners of the Table, and there bowed himself three times; then to the
second, third and fourth corners, bowing at each corner three times; but, when
he came to the side of the Table where the bread and wine was, he bowed
himself seven times, and then, after the reading of many prayers by himself
and his two fat chaplins (which were with him, and all this while were upon
their knees by him, in their Sirplisses, Hoods and Tippits) he himself came
near the Bread, which was cut and laid in a fine napkin, and then he gently
lifted up one of the corners of the said napkin, and peeped into it till he
saw the bread, (like a boy that peeped after a bird-nest in a bush) and
presently clapped it down again, and flew back a step or two, and then bowed
very low three times toward it and the Table: when he beheld the bread, then
he came near and opened the napkin again, and bowed as before; then he laid
his hand upon the gilt Cup which was full of wine, with a cover upon it; so
soon as he had pulled the Cupp a little nearer to him, he let the Cupp go,
flew back, and bowed again three times toward it: then he came near
again, and lifting up the cover of the Cupp peeped into it, and seeing the
wine, he let fall the cover on it again, and flew nimbly back and bowed as
before: After these and many other Apish Anticke Gesturs he himself received,
and then gave the Sacrament to some principal men only they devoutly kneeling
near the Table, after which more prayers being said, this Scene and Interlude
ended.

Mr. Hope likewise deposed the same that Mr. Willingham did, in all particulars
touching the manner of the Archbishops consecrating Creed-Church; at which
consecration he was present, and took special notice thereof.

Upon which evidence the Committee of the house of Commons observed and urged
before the Lords. First, that it appeared by the prayers used by the
Archbishop, that he consecrated this Church rather for a Churchyard or a
burying place, then for an Oratory or place of prayer and preaching using the
same prayers in substance as are prescribed in the Roman Pontifical, at the
consecration of a Churchyard to inter dead bodies in. Secondly, that the
consecration of Churches after this sort, is a mere Popish and Superstitious
Ceremony, prescribed only by Popes and Popish Councels, Canonists, for their
own gains and luchre, and not by any Protestant Canons, Synodes, Authors:
witness Gratian, De Consecratione Distinct. 1. and the Glosses on it, Summa
Hostiensis. lib. 3. Tit. De Consecratione Ecclesiae et Altaris; Angelus De
Clavasio, his Summa Angelica. Tit. Consecratio Ecclesiae. Summa Rosella. Tit.
Consecratio. Iuo Carnotensis Decretalium. pars. 3. De Ecclesia. C. 8. to. 38.
Bochellus Decreta Ecclesiae Gallicanae. lib. 4. Tit. 1. Iohannis De Aton:
Constitutiones Ecclesiasticae. Tit. 1. De Consecratione Ecclesiarum: with
diverse other Popish Canonists. Thirdly, that the form and manner of
consecrating Churches, was no where to be found but in the Roman Pontifical,
set out by the Popes authority, wherein it is at large described: P. 209. to
280. Cap. De Ecclesiae Dedicatione, seu Consecratione; and not extant in the
Book of Common-praier, or of the Ordinition of Ministers, or in any other
Records or Rituals of our Church; which abollished the Roman Pontifical, and
Ceremony of consecrating Churches by the Statutes of 2. and 3. E. 6. C. 1. 3.
and 4. E. 6. C. 10. 1. Eliz. C. 1. 8. Eliz. C. 1. Fourthly, That the very form
the Archbishop used in consecrating Creed-Church, was taken from the Roman
Pontifical published by command of Pope Clement the eight, (found in this
study:) P. 214. 217. 219. where the Bishop coming to the door of the Church
he is to consecrate Percutit illud semel cum inferiori part baculi pastoralis
super luminare, dicens intelligibili voce. Attollite portas, Principes,
vestras, et apperiamini portae aeternales, et introibit Rex gloriae etc. The
very words the Archbishop now used: and then entering the Church pronouneeth it
holy and blessed, in the name of the Father, Son and holy ghost. After which
he uses many Prayers, Psalms, bowings, Ceremonies; and Vnus ex Ministris
spargit cinerem per pavimentum, in modum crucis; as this Archbishop did; who
followed the Roman Pontifical in all the particulars he there practiced;
exceeding it in his blessings and cursings (which are not so fully expressed in
the Pontifical) and in his reconsecration of this Church, upon the repairing
only of the walls, in which case the forecited Canonists all accord, it is not
to be reconsecrated but the wall only to be exorcised and sprinkled with holy
water. Fifthly, That our own Protestant Bishops and writers condemn the
consecration of Churches, Chapels and Churchyards by Bishops, to make them
holier then other places, as a mere Popish, Jewish, ridiculous, and absurd
practice.

The first, they instanced in, was reverend Dr. Pilkington (a fugitive for
Religion in Queen Mary's, and Bishop of Durham in he beginning of Queen
Elizabeth reign) in his Exposition of Aggens c. 1. v. 7. 8. and cap. 2. v. 2.
3. where he determines thus. IT IS POPISH TO BELIEVE that which the Bishops do
teach: That place to be more holy then the rest which they have hallowed, as
they say, with their conjured water, Crossings, Censings, Processions, etc. But
blessed be that God our Lord which by the light of his Word does confound all
such wicked and fond fantasies, which they devise to fill their bellies and
maintain their Authority by. Although these Ceremonies in the old Law were
given by Moses, for the hardness of the peoples hearts, and to keep the^
exercised, that they fall not to the Idolatry, of the Gentiles, yet is there no
mention of them in the New Testament, nor yet commanded now, either to us or
them, but forbidden to be used of all both of us and them. We be no longer
under shadows, but under the truth, Christ has fulfilled all, and taken away
all such dark kind of Ceremonies and has placed the clear light of his
Gospel, in the Church, to continue to the end.

The Popes Church, has all things pleasant in it to delight the people, but
where the Gospel is preached, they knowing that God is not pleased but only
with a pure heart, they are content with an honest place, appointed to resort
together in, though it were never hallowed by Bishops at all. It is written;
that God dwells not Note. Acts 17. 24. John 4. 23, 24.
in Temples made with hands; nor is worshipped with any work of men's hands;
but he is a spirit an invisible substance, and will be worshipped in spirit and
truth; not in outward words only of the lips, but with the deep sighs and
groans of the heart, and the whole power of the mind, and earnest hearty
calling on him in prayer, by faith. And therefore he does not so much require
of us to build him an house of stone and timber, but has willed us, to pray in
all places; and has taken 1 Timothy 2. 8.
away the Jewish, and Popish holiness, which is thought to be more in one
place then another. All the earth is the Lords and he is present in all places,
hearing the Petitions of them that call upon him in faith. Therefore those
Bishops, which think with their conjured water, to make one place more holy
then the rest, are no better then the Note.
Jews, deceiving the people and teaching that only to be holy, which they
have censed, crossed, oyled, and breathed upon; for as Christ said to the
woman; thinking one place to be more holy to pray in then another, Woman,
believe me, the time is come when ye shall worship neither at Jerusalem, nor
in this Hill; but the true worshippers John 4.
shall worship God in spirit and truth: So it is now said, the place makes not
the man holy, but the man makes the place holy: and ye shall not worship your
Idols, Stocks, and Stones, neither at Wilsingham, Ipswich, Canterbury, nor
Sheen; for God chooses not the people, for the places sake, but the place for
the people sake; But if ye be in the midst of the field God is as ready to
hear your faithful prayers, as in any Abbey, or Priory; yea, a thousand times
more, for the one place he hates, as defiled with Idolatry; and the other he
loves, as undefiled and clean. If the good man lie in prison, tied in Chains,
or at the stake burned, for Gods cause, That place is holy, for the holiness
of the man, and the presence of the holy Ghost in him; as Tertullian says; yet
there should be common places appointed for the people to Assemble and come
together therein, to praise our God etc. Those who in the Apostles times were
buried in no Church or Churchyard, nor Christen-moldes, (as they be called)
when it is not better then other earth, but rather worse, for the conjuring
that Bishops use about it. It appears in the Gospel by the Legion living in
graves, the Widows son going to burial, Christ buried without the City,
etc. That they buried not in hallowed Churches by Bishops, but in a several
place appointed for the same purpose, without the City, which custom
remains to this day in many godly places, etc. A most express Authority
against Bishops Popish consecrations of Churches and Churchyards, to make them
holyer then other places.

The second Authority they produced was, Matthew Parker, Archbishop of
Canterbury in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign; who was of a quite
contrary judgment to this his Popish Successor, condemning this manner of
consecrating Churches, Altars, etc. as Superstitious, Paganish, childish,
ridiculous, in his Antiquitates Ecclesiae Brittannicae. p. 85. 86. 87. in these
terms; Legate enim qui volet recentiores et nostro praesertim avo editos

Quanto modernis Pontificibus aequior fuit Gregorius, qui scribit. Quomodo
regulae sanctorum Patrum pro tempore, loco, and persona and negotio instante
necessitate traditae sunt. Hi autem nulla neque temporis, neque loci, neque
negotii, neque personae, neque cujusquam rei quam suae voluntatis atque
gloriolae rationem habentes, ne pusillis in rebus veritate cedere volunt. A
very good character of the Prisoner at the bar, and his proceedings in this
kind. To these two Prelates might be added M. William Tyndal, a learned
Martyr, his Obedience of a Christian man, p. 136. 152. William Wraughton, his
Hunting and rescuing of the Romish Fox; John Bale, Bishop of Osyris in Ireland,
in his Image of both Churches; Thomas Beacon, a Prebend of Canterbury, in his
Relics of Rome; M. Calfhill, in his book against Marshal, f. 61, 92. 93. M.
Fox his Acts and monuments, Edit. 1610. p. 210. 414. with sundry other of our
learned Writers, who expressly censure the Consecration of Churches and
Churchyards, as superstitious, Jewish, Popish, Antichristian, ridiculous,
stiling them rather a conjuration then a consecration; invented only by and
reserved to Bishops for lucre sake alone. And the Homily for repairing and
keeping clean Churches, page 78, 79. resolves thus, The Church or Temple is
counted and called holy, yet not of it self, but because Gods people resorting
thereunto are holy, and exercise themselves in holy and heavenly things: Not
because it is hallowed by a Bishop, of which the Homilies make no mention.

From these Authorities they concluded; the Archbishops consecration of
Churches (especially of this but newly repaired) to be both Popish and
Superstitious, by the received Doctrine, Writers of our Church, and Statutes of
our Realm, which abandon and condemn the same.

Yet notwithstanding this Archbishop was so zealously bent upon it, that he
rested not in the consecration of Creed-Church, but proceeded further to
consecrate Saint Giles Church in the fields; where the case stood thus:

The Church of Saint Giles being in decay, was re-edified and part of it new
built and finished in Bishop Mountains time, Divine Service, Preaching, and
Administration His Consecration of Saint Giles Church.
of the Sacraments after its repair having been used therein for 3. or 4.
years space together without any exceptions: After which Bishop Laud being
advanced to the Bishopric of London, by a solemn process under his Episcopal
seal interdicted this Church, and suspended Divine Service, Sermons, and
Sacraments in it for 2. or 3. weeks together, so as the Church doors were shut
up even on Lords Days, and the Parishoners forced to repair to other Churches,
only because the Church had not been re-consecrated after its reparation: some
of the Parish opposed the consecration of it in respect of the charge and Fees,
but at last they were enforced by the Bishop to submit, else they must have no
Divine Service, Sermons, nor Sacraments in it, after all their costs bestowed
thereon: Whereupon the Bishop the very next Lords Day after he had consecrated
Creed Church, repaired to Saint Giles Church, and there consecrated it in the
self-same manner, with the self-same gestures, bowings, prayers, ceremonies, as
he consecrated Creed Church: After which he likewise consecrated the
Churchyard, and a piece of ground which was bought and added to it; for
consecration whereof the Parish paid ten pound fees to the Bishop himself, to
wit, 5 l. for consecrating the Church, and 5 l. for hallowing the Churchyard,
besides fees to his Officers, and a Dinner which cost the Parish near 30 l.
more; all which was attested upon oath, by Master Hope, and some others: and
likewise proved by the Archbishops own Diary, wherein he registered this
special memorial of this Consecration with his own hand, Sunday January 20.
1630. I consecrated the Church of S. Gyles in the Fields.

Upon which evidence the Committee of the Commons made these Observations.
First, That this Church was used three or four years together in B. Mountains
time after its repair without any new Consecration, and thought holy enough by
him: but this Popish Prelate after all this space was of another judgment, and
must needs suspend and re-consecrate it, contrary to the very Canon law, and
the resolution of the forecited Canonists. Secondly, that he and his Officers
extorted unreasonable excessive fees from the Parish besides their costly
Dinner, for this pious work on the Lords day; himself taking no less then 10
l. fees for consecrating the Church and Churchyard, which is direct Symonie by
the Sea Summa Angelica and Rosella. Tit. Symonia.
Canon Law, and extortion by the Commonlaw, there being no fees due by either
law for such a Consecration. Thirdly, that this Prelate was so wilful and
superstitious in this Innovation, that God must lose his public worship in
this Church, and the whole Parish the use of it for the benefit of their
souls, for two or three whole weeks during its interdiction, rather then this
Prelate not enjoy his popish ends and exorbitant fees for the re-consecration
of it.

After this, July 17. 1632. he consecrated another Church in Middlesex, in the
same manner as he had done the former two: of which he makes this special
Memento in his own Diary: July 17. 1632. I consecrated the Church at Stanmore
Magna, in Middlesex, built by Sir John Wolstenham.

As this Arch-prelate was thus superstitiously and popishly active in
consecrating Churches, so likewise in consecrating Chapels, for which these
instances were produced.

The first Chapel he consecrated, was a Chapel built by himself at
Aberguilla in Wales, whiles he was Bishop of S. David's, dedicated by him to S.
John Baptist, concerning which he registers this passage in his own Diary.

August 28. 1625. Dies erat Solis: consecravi Capellam sine Oratorium propriis
sumptibus extructum, in demo me a communiter vocata Aberguille-House. Nomen
indidi, Capella S. Joh. Baptistae, in gratam memoriam Collegii S. Joh.
Baptistae, Oxon cujus primo socius, and dein Praeses fui. Et hoc consulto feci.
Intervenit autem aliud non mali ominis spero (it seems he then little dreamed
of his own beheading, or that the decollation of the Baptist, to whose memory
he dedicated this Chapel could be any ill Omen of his own decapilation
afterward) de quo nunquam cogitavi, hoc fuit. Die Sabbati vesperi, immediate
praecedente consecrationem celebrandam, dum procibus eram intentus, nescio quam
violenter in mientem me am irruit, adesse diem DECOLLATIONIS S. JOHANNIS
BAPTISTAE. Finitis precibus fasta consului; reperio diem illum in diem Lunae,
29 scilicet Augusti, non in diem Solis incidere. Optassem, diem ipsum; sed

Nam illa die Serenissimus Rex Jacobus, causam meam circa electionem in

audivit, and me e manu inimicorum potentum justissime liberavit; No doubt to
preserve him to a^ar other doom and censure.

Mr. Prynne deposed, that he found in the Archbishops Study this paper indorsed
and corrected with his own hand, concerning the consecration of this his
Chapel.

With this Instrument, he likewise found a note of the dimensions of this
Chapel, written with the Bishops own hand,

My Chapel at Aberguilly is 5. yards and a half broad at the East end. MY
ALTAR FRAME, besides the thickness of the Table, is a yard and 3. inches high.
And the Table is a yard and three quarters long; and in breadth it wants three
inches of a yard; the foot-pace is two yards broad.

This note was enclosed and wrapped up within these two following Papers found
together with it, thus indorsed with the Archbishops own hand. 1643. Chapel

Popish furniture both of Bishop Andrews and this Archbishops Chapels at
Aberguilly, London-house, and Lambeth, will most evidently appear to all the

To which I shall only add this Passage of like nature of Doctor Wrens
Proposalls found in the Archbishops studdy, thus indorsed with his own hand,
and presented by him to his Majesty, touching the furnishing of the Altar at
Windsor Chapel.

September. 22. 1628. Doctor Wren Deane of Windsor, his Proposalls to his Sacred
Majesty, concerning that Church, and the Order of the Garter.

Touching the Divine Service in his Majesty's Chapel of Windsor.

Whereas also the Altar of the Chapel is not furnished according to the State
and Magnificence of so great a Majesty; May it please his Sacred Majesty to
call to mind that at a Chapter of the Order held, April 23. 1618. by King
James of Blessed memory, It was decreed, Quod quilibet Militum offerret ac
donaret pro Altari capellae ordinis in Windsor vas aliquod argenteum valoris
(ad minimum) 20. l. And again at the Chapter held, November. 24. 1625. Under his
Sacred Majesty that now is, it is thus Ordered; Primum proposuit supremus, ut
unusquisque Ordinis donaret aliquod vas Argenteum valoris, 20. l. in usum
capellae. Hic acclamatum est ab omnibus. The fulfilling of which Decrees would
make a magnificent and worthy supply of all things necessary unto the service
of the said Altar,

To which the Archbishop writ this Answer in the Margin with his own hand:
These and all that concern the Order are to be remembered at the next Chapter.

Certainly were there no other Evidence to prove this Archbishop a direct
Papist in heart and practice, but the consecration and Popish furniture of his
Chapel with that forementioned in the windows at Lambeth it were abundantly
sufficient to satisfy all the world, and the greatest Patriots of his
sincerity to the Protestant Religion; but we shall proceed to further proofs.

The next Chapel we find the Archbishop consecrated, was the Chapel at
Hamer-Smith; of which there was this memorial read out of his Dairy June. 7.
1631. Tuesday J consecrated the Chapel of Hamer-Smith; It was done with like
Popish Ceremonies as he used at Creed-Church; and Sr. Nicholas Crispe setting
two great silver Flagons with wine on the Communion Table when the Chapel was
consecrated, without any intent to bestow them on the Chapel; the Archbishop
told him after the consecration they were now dedicated unto God, and it would
be Sacrilege for him to commit them to his private use again: and so enforced
him to bestow them on the Chapel.

There was great suite made to the Bishop, and a composition with Dr. Cluet
Minister of Fulham and his successors, before way would be given by him, for
the building of this Chapel of case. At last all parties being agreed, and
provisions made to build the Chapel; the Archbishop solemnly laid and
consecrated the first stone thereof, using the ensuing prayer at its
consecration; as was proved by his Book of Prayers written with his own hand
(seized by Mr. Prynne in his Chamber at the Tower) where page 220. was written
in the Margent. Hamer-Smith Chapel March 11. 1629. with this superscription
and Prayer.

At the laying of the first stone in A Chapel. O Lord Merciful and gracious,
these thy people are preparing to build a place Hammer-Smith Chapel. March
11. 1629.
for thy service. Accept I humbly beseech thee, their present devotion, and
make them perfect both in their present and future duty: That while thou give
them case to honor thee, they may with the greater Alacrity go on in thy
service. And now O Lord I have by thy mercy and goodness put to my hand to lay
the first stone in this building. It Is a Corner stone, make it I beseech thee a
happy foundation, a durable building; Let it rise up and be made and continue a
house of prayer and devotion through allages, that thy people may be taught to
believe in Jesus Chapter the true Corner stone, upon whom they and their souls may
be built safe for ever. Grant this for the same Jesus Christ our most blessed
Lord and Savior. To whom with the Father; and the Holy Spirit be ascribed, all
power majesty and dominion this day and for ever, Amen.

Now this Ceremony of consecrating and laying the first stone of a Chapel or
Church by the Bishop, is expressly taken out of the Roman Pontifical, pars 2.
cap. De Benedictione and impositione primarij lapidis pro Ecclesia edificanda.
p. 199. etc. Where all the solemnity of this consecration is at large
prescribed, and the substance of the Prayer the Bishop used upon this occasion,
thence derived.

This ceremony of consecrating and laying the first stone of a Church or
Chapel is severely censured as ridiculous, Popish, Superstitions, by Matthew
Parker, his predecessor Archbishop of Canterbury, in his Antiquitates Ecclesia
Britannicae, p. 85. Quibus enim non dicam verbis sed portentis, haec and
hujusmodi a Pontificiis adorantur Q. Primarius lapis and caementum per Ecclesia
aedificanda: Lapis cum caemento Episcopi manibus primum aqua benedicta sparsus
insculpto Gracis signo his sententiis in fundamento positus est, lapidem quem
reprobaverunt aedifieantes, hic factus est in caput Anguli Devide, tu es
Petrus, and super hanc Petram, etc. postea precabantur, ut qui ad perficiendam,
Ecclesiam auxilium dederunt, corporis and animae salutem consequantur, etc. Yet
notwithstanding the Popish Prelate, in contempt of his Predecessors Judgment,
needs must introduce this Popish Innovation, not only at Hammersmith, but even
at the Cathedral of Paul's it self; where he consecrated and laid the first
stone at its reparation, with many prayers and Ceremonies: And not content
herewith caused a second Edition of Sir Tho. Ridlyes View of the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Law to be reprinted at Oxford, Anno 1634. Cum Privilegio, with
some Marginall Additions added to it by J. G. Master of Arts p. 51. 52, 191,
192, 193. Wherein he justifies the consecrating of Churches, Chapels, and the
foundation-stone thereof, by the Bishop in these words: The Bishop with Prayer
is to lay the first stone of a Church or Monastary, and lift up his hands to
heaven, and consecrate the place to God by prayer, and there erect the symbol
of our Salvation, we mean the venerable and truly precious Rood. That this
Ceremony of laying the first stone, has been of ancient use in the Greek
Church, may be observed out of their Euchologue, where it is said, That the
Bishop after some other Rites performed, standing in the place where the holy
Altar shall be set, says a prayer, which being ended he gives the Ita missa
est, and then taking up one of the stones, and having cut a cross upon it
himself with his own hands lays it upon the groundworke; then he pronounces
the, etc. and so the workmen begin the building. That which follows in the
Euchologue, discovers the form and manner of setting up the Crucifix which
the Law calls (...). The like ceremonies are used in the Latin Church as
this day, as may be seen in their Pontifical page 281. of that which Clement
the 8. set out at Rome in the year 1565. The crucifix must be sent to the
place where the Church is to be erected; and there the Bishop uses certain
prayers, fumeth the ground with his Incense circular-wise, crosses the corner
stone, which he lays for the foundation, and when he makes the consecration,
the cross must he set up behind the holy Altar, there being prepared for it
some lofty structure, etc. Which addition was patched to Doctor Ridley, merely
to countenance and justify the Archbishops consecrations of this kind; of
which we shall produce some other Instances.

We read in his Diary under his own hand this Memorial following, May 26.
1632. Saturday, Trinity Sunday Eve, I consecrated the Lord Treasurers Chapel
at Roe-hampton: And in an Abstract of the Archbishops Metropoliticall
Visitation, Anno 1635. (found in his studdy) we find his Visitor and Vicar
General interdicted the Chapel of Buckston and of Down in Derbyshire.
(though long used) for want of consecration, and in some Articles to be
inquired of in the Visitation of the Archdeacon of Buckingham Anno 1625.
Artic. 27. touching the Ministry.
Visitation Articles this inquiry made, Whether any Chaplains did Preach or
administer the Sacrament in any Chapel not consecrated?

In the year 1636. there was a great contestation between the Archbishop and
the University of Cambridge, heard before his Majesty and his Privy Council at
Hampton Court, whether the Archbishop merely as Metropolitan, or the King alone
as King and founder of the University should have the Visitation thereof: where
it was ruled for the Archbishop, against the King and University. At which
time the Archbishop declared, that one principal cause why he desired to
visit the University of Cambridge was, because there were some Chapels
belonging to Colleges where Divine Service had been used, and the Sacrament
administered diverse years, though they were never consecrated by any Bishop; as
namely See Speeds Hist. of Great Britain. p. 1067 1068.
Emanuel College Chapel, built in the year, 1584. And Sidney Sussex College
Chapel built in the year, 1598. And ever since used as Chapels without any
Bishops consecration, no Archbishop or Bishop, of the Diocese taking any
exceptions at it; yet now forsooth, the Archbishop as Metropolitan must become
Visitor to the University of Cambridge to consecrate these Chapels; as if they
were profane before, and the holy Ordinances used in them not sufficient to
hallow them, without his Popish Episcopal consecration-ceremonies, Expos. in
Aggeus, c 1. and 2.
Bishop Pilkington, De Vita and Ob tu. Mar. Buceri.
Walter Haddon, Acts and Monuments, Edit. 1610. p. 1777. to 1788.
Mr. Fox, and others, much jeer and deride the madness, folly, and
superstition of Cardinal Poole, and his Deputy Visitors of this very
University of Cambridge, for digging up Mr. Bucers, and Paulus Fagius bones,
out of S. Mary's Church in Cambridge, 3. years after they were interred, and
interdicting and new consecrating the Church again, as profaned by them for
fear their Masses and Divine Service there used, should be nothing worth, the
place being made profane and unholy by these heretics funerals as they
judged them, when as the Church was holy enough to say Mass in for three
years space before; and all that would not hear it must be imprisoned,
burned, although the parties lay there buried.

And is it not then a far greater madness, superstition, and ridiculous
frenzy for this domineering Arch-Prelate to deem these two Chapels profane
places, unfit to administer the Sacraments, and celebrate divine Service in,
because never yet consecrated by a Bishop, not only after three, but almost
threescore years use and practice of divine Service, Sermons, Sacraments in
them? When as neither his predecessors Whitgift, Bancroft, and Abbot (men very
ceremonious, and two of them much addicted to superstition) ever so much as
moved any such question concerning the necessity of their consecration:
Especially since there is no such Canon, Law, to enforce the consecration of
them now, as was to justify the re-hallowing of S. Mary's Church in Queen
Mary's time, which the Sea Summa Angelica and Rosella. Tit. Consecratio
Ecclesiae.
Popish Canon Law then approved, in the case of Bucer and Fagius. We read in
the Ecclesiastical Constitutions of Otho, the Popes Legate, made in an English
Synod in the Reign of King Henry the third, that even in those dark times of
Popery, there were not only diverse Parish Churches, but some Cathedrals in
England, which were used as such for many years, yet never consecrated by a
Bishop, as appears by these words of the Constitution it self; Joan. de Aten
Constit. Dom. Othonis. De consec^. Ecclesia. f. 5.
Multas invenimus Ecclesias, and aliquas Cathedrales, quae licet fuer unt ab
antiquo constructae, nondum tamen sunt sanctificationis Oleo consecrate:
Whereupon this Popish Legate for his own lucher, Enjoined all Churches then
built or to be built, to be consecrated within two years space, under pain of
interdiction, from having Mass said in them; unless some reasonable cause
were showed to the contrary. By color of which Popish constitution, this
Prelate (it seems) urged the consecration of these ancient Chapels; there
being no other shadow of reason, Canon, or authority for it.

After this Archbishop had thus procured a power to himself to visit the
University of Cambridge; Matthew Wren Bishop of Ely, December. 1. 1639. Sent him
up an account signed with his own hand, of some things amiss within his
Diocese and that University, which he left to his Graces consideration to
amend: which account was seized by Master Prynne in his study at Lambeth, and
thus indorsed with the Archbishops own hand. My Lord of Elyes Account: 1639.
In which there were these two Passages, concerning consecration of Chapels.
The first concerning a Chapel in Sir John Cuts house, in the town of
Childerley; which Chapel the Knight said, was consecrated by Bishop Heton,
producing an Instrument under seal, purporting that on such a day, at
Childersly, Bishop Heton did consecrate a Chapel, by saying Service there
himself, and having a Sermon: (this was all the Solemnity of its Consecration)
I questioning the whole matter have required him to waiteupon your Grace, to
see whether that consecration must be allowed of? The second concerning some
Chapels in Colleges never yet consecrated; which is thus expressed in this
Account: It was presented unto me, That in the Colleges of Emanuel, Sidney,
and Corpus Christi, there have been Rooms built within the memory of man,
which are used for common Chapels, wherein they have daily prayers and do
Preach there, without any faculty or license granted unto them so to do; And
wherein also they ordinarily celebrate the holy Communion, The said places
never having been consecrated thereunto.

Ma. Elie.

The Scottish troubles, it seems, prevented his consecration of these Chapels,
which were sufficiently hallowed before by the Divine Duties exercised in them.
The last Chapel we find consecrated, was that in Covent Garden, which was
hallowed or rather profaned with all Popish Ceremonies expressed in the Roman
Pontifical, and far more than were used at Creed-Church.

The Archbishop having thus far advanced his Popish designs in consecrating
Churches, Chapels, and Churchyards, proceeded one step further, even to set
up the exploded Annual Baccanalian feasts of Dedication, whereon Churches were
hallowed, prescribed at first only by the Decrees of (...) Council. Tom. 2. p.
382.
Pope Felix, and Pope Gregory recorded by Gratian, De Consecratione, Distinct
1. who Decreed thus: Solennitates Ecclesiarum dedicationem per singulos annos
solemniter sunt celebrandae. Those Feasts of Dedication, turned by the people
into mere Bacchanals, were exceedingly declaimed against, as necessary to be
suppressed by Nicholaus de Clemangiis in his Tract, De Novis Celebritatibus non
instituendis; suppressed by the Injunctions of King Henry the S. An. 1536. As
the occasion of much idleness, excess, riot, Fox Acts and Monuments.
and pernicious to the Souls of men; Whereupon they were all of them restrained
to the first Sunday in the month of October, not to be kept on any other day;
and afterward totally abolished by the statute of 5. and 6. E. 6. c. 3. Of
holy days. Which being revived again by degrees, with their Baccanalian
disorders in sundry places of this Realm, under the names of Wakes or Revels,
and suppressed by some Judges in their Circuits and Justices of Peace in
Sessions: this Archbishop in the year of our Lord 1633. by a Declaration
compiled by himself, but published in his Majesty's Name, entitled; The Kings
Majesty's Declaration concerning Lawful Sports to be used; revived and
enjoined the Observation of these Wakes and Feasts of Dedication, never
formerly established by any Christian Prince; together with the use of diverse
Sports and pastimes on the Lords own Sacred day, after Divine Service ended; to
the great Dishonor of God, of his Majesty, of our Religion, the disturbance of
the Civil Government, increase of all Licensiousnesse, profaneness, impiety,
and great grief of all godly peoples Souls. This Book he enjoined all
Ministers to read and publish openly in the Church, in time of Divine Service,
though not commanded by the King; and those who out of conscience refused to
read it in this kind, were by his means suspended, excommunicated, prosecuted
in the High Commission, Sequestered from their Livings, yea many of them
enforced to desert their Cures and depart the Kingdom; this book being made a
snare only to entrap or suppress most of the painful, godly, preaching
Ministers throughout the Realm, who were all more or less prosecuted about it:
Yet such was this Arch-Prelates unparalled impiety, transcending all examples
in former Ages, that he not only caused his Instruments His Communion Book
Chatechisme expounded.

by Master Edward Richardson, and Master Prynne.

Sir Thomas Richardson Lord chief Justice of England and Baron Denham, riding
the Western Circuit in the Lent Vacation, 7o Caroli, there being at the Assizes
in the County of Sommerset, many persons indicted for murdering Bastard
children begotten at Wakes and Revels, with sundry other grand disorders
occasioned by these intemperate meetings, the Justices of that County earnestly
importuned the Judges to make a severe Order for the suppression of these
disorderly Wakes and Revels, as diverse of their Predecessors had done, without
which they could never keep the Country in good Order, nor prevent the
multitude of Bastards, murders, bloodsheds, drunkenness, quarrels, and other
disorders occasioned by them; whereupon these Judges made this ensuing Order in
the public Assizes.

An Order made by the Judges of the Assizes for the suppressing of all Ales and
Revels, the nineteenth day of March, Anno Regis Caroli nunc Ang. etc. Sept.
WHereas diverse Orders have been made heretofore by the Judges of the Assise
for the suppressing of all Ales and Revels, the same Order is now confirmed at
this Assizes, and again Ordered by the Court, In regard of the infinite number
of inconveniences daily arising by means of Revels. That such Revels,
Church-Ales, Clerks-Ales, and all other public Ales, be henceforth utterly
suppressed; and if hereafter it shall be known to the Justices of the Peace
within this County of such to be set up hereafter to be used, That then the
Justices of Peace within their several divisions take course, as well for the
speedy apprehending and punishing of Idle and lewd persons, drawing together at
such places, as also for the binding over of such persons using tippling,
inflicting such punishment upon all offenders in such places as the Law does
inflict. And to the end this Order may be the better observed, it is further
Ordered, That the Clerk of the Assizes shall leave Coppies hereof with the
under-Sheriffe, and from the under-Sheriffe every Constable of the hundred
shall take a Copy for his several Hundred and Liberty, and shall deliver a
Copy to the Minister of every Parish within his several Hundred and Liberty,
and shall take a note of every Minister under his hand the day when he received
it; and shall publish it yearly within the Parish Church, the first Sunday in
February, and likewise the two Sundays before Easter, yearly. And it is
further Ordered, That every Constable every Lent-Assises, present unto the
Judges of the Circuit, a note of the same Order under the hands of the said
Ministers: And for the avoiding the concourse of idle people, it is further
Ordered, That Minstrels, and such other persons as usually carry up and down
Bulls and Bears to bate (being Rogues by the Statute) shall be punished as
Rogues, for the further preventing of such inconveniences as usually happens at
such meetings.

This is a Copyy of the Order.
To Lawrence Musgrave Constable.
The now Archbishop being informed of this good Order, was very much netled at
it, both in regard of the subject matter of it, (the suppression of
Church-Ales, Wakes, Revels, commonly kept on the Lords Day) and likewise of the
manner of publishing it, by the Ministers in the Church, which he conceived to
be an Usurpation upon the Bishops Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and an injury
to the Church. Upon which grounds he had formerly quarrelled with Sir Nicholas
Rainton when he was Lord Mayor of London, for prohibiting an Apple-woman to
sell Apples on the Lords Day within Paul's Churchyard, threatening to complain
of him to the King and his Council for usurping on his Jurisdiction; and
telling him she should sell Apples there on the Sunday, notwithstanding his
Command to the contrary, and let him punish her if he durst; as he likewise
excepted against this pious Order of Richard Deane, Lord Mayor of London, Anno
1629. (found in his study by Master Prynne) thus endorsed with his own hand,
April 20. 1629. The Lord Mayor of London his Warrant against breakers of the
Sabbath, MY JVRISDICTION INTERESSED.

WHereas J am credibly informed that notwithstanding diverse good Laws provided
Land. ss
for the keeping of the Sabbath day holy, according to the express
Commandment of Almighty God, diverse Jnhabitants and other persons of this City
and other places, having no respect of duty toward God, and his Majesty, or
his Laws, but in contempt of them all, do commonly and of custom greatly
profane the Sabbath day, in buying, selling, uttering, and venting their Wares
and Commodities, upon that day for their private gain. Also Jnholders suffering
Markets to be kept by Carriers in most rude and profane manner, in selling
Victuals to Hucsters, Chandlers, and all other comers: also Carriers, Carmen,
Clothworkers, Water-bearers, and Porters carrying of burdens, and Watermen
plying their Fares, and diverse others working in their ordinary callings. And
likewise that J am further informed that Vintners, Alehousekeepers, Tobacco,
and strong Water sellers, greatly profane the Sabbath day, by suffering
Company to sit drinking and bibbing in their houses on that day; And likewise
diverse by cursing and swearing and such like behavior, contrary to the
express Commandment of Almighty God, his Majesty's Laws in that behalf and
all good Government. For the Reformation whereof, J do hereby require, and in
his Majesty's name straightly Command all his Majesty's loving subjects
whatsoever, and also all Constables, Headboroughs, Beadles, and all other
Officers whatsoever to be ayding and assisting to (I. S.) the bearer hereof, in
finding out and apprehending all and every such person and persons, as shall be
found to offend in any of these kinds; and them and every of them to bring
before me or some other of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace, to answer to
all such matters as shall be objected against them, and to put in good
security, for their good behavior: whereof fail you not, as you or any of you
will answer at your peril.

Dated April 20. 1629. To all Constables and other his Majesty's Officers and
Ministers whatsoever within the City of London and liberties thereof, and to
every of them. Rich. Deane Major.

The Archbishop much vexed at the Judges forementioned Order against Ales and
Revels, complained of the Judges and it to his Majesty (as he had formerly
done of the Lord Mayor of London) and procured a Commission to some Divines of
that County, and Bishop Pierce, to enquire of the manner of publishing this
Order in Churches, and what was done therein, and of the Lord Chief Justice
Richardsons carriage in this business. Notwithstanding which Commission this
chief Justice the next Assizes gave a strict charge against these Ales, and
Revels, required an Account of the publication and execution of the foresaid
Order, and punished some disorderly persons for breach thereof: Wherewith the
Archbishop (then of London) being acquainted by Sir Robert Philips and others,
he thereupon complained again to the King of the Judges, and writ the ensuing
letter to the Bishop of Bath and Wels, to make the better way for the public
authorizing of Wakes and Revels, even on the Lords own Day, and his Majesty's
subsequent Declaration for sports and Ales to be kept thereon: of which
Christopher Dowe his Champion, in his Innovations unjustly charged upon the
present Church and State, or, An Answer to the most material passages of a
Libellous Pamphlet made by Mr. Henry Burton, and Entitled, An Apology of an
Appeal, etc. London, 1637. chap. 5. p. 75. writes thus: I believe his Grace
holds it no dishonor to be the means of procuring or urging obedience, to any
Act, that so just, and religious a King shall avow to be His. Propounding and
justifying these five Propositions at at large concerning this Declaration, and
the urging of it, p. 77. etc.

1. That the Declaration is no inlet to prophannesse, or irreligion, or
hinderance of the due Sanctification of the Lords Day.

2. That ehe sports permitted by it to be used, are Lawful, and are not
prohibited either by Gods Law, or the Law of the Land.

3. That it is no means of breaking the fifth Commandment, nor does allow any
contempt of Parents, or Masters Authority over their children and servants.

4. That the reading of it by Ministers, in their several Congregations, was
enjoined and intended by his Majesty, and that it is a thing that may lawfully
be done by them.

5. That such as refuse to publish it accordingly, are justly punished, and
their punishment no cruelty or unjust persecution.

The Extract of the Letter sent to the Bishop of Bath and Wels, was as
follows.

S. in Christo.
My very good Lord, etc.
MY Businesses concerning my Translation are now almost over, and those of
Term ready to begin. And in the interim I am commanded by His Majesty to put
you to a little pains. There has been of late some noise in Somersetshire
about the Feasts NOTE.
of the Dedications of Churches, commonly called the Wakes; and it seems the
Judges of Assiize formerly made an Order to prohibit them, and caused it to be
published in some or most of the Churches there by the Minister, without my
Lord the Bishops consent or privity. The pretense of this has been, that some
disorders derogatory from Gods service and the Government of the Commonwealth
are committed at those times: by which argument, any thing that is abused may
be quite taken away. It seems there has been some heat struck in the
Country about this, by the carriage of the Lord Chief Justice Richardson, at
the two last Assizes, especially the last, with which His Majesty is not well
pleased. And for the preventing of outrages, or disorders at those Feasts, no
man can be more careful than His Majesty; but He conceives, and that very
rightly, that all these may and ought to be prevented by the care of the
Justices of Peace, and not leave the Feasts themselves to be kept, for the
Neighbourly meetings and Recreations of the people, of which he would not have
them debarred under any frivilous pretenses. And farther, His Majesty has been
lately informed by men of good place in that Country, that the Humourists
increase much in those parts, and unite NOTE.
themselves by banding against the Feasts; which course, as His Majesty no way
likes, so He has been informed also for this last year, since warning was
given, there have not been any noted disorders at any of those Feasts kept in
those parts. Yet for His better satisfaction, He has commanded me to require
you (which I here do by these Letters) to send for some of the gravest of your
Clergy, and such as stand best affected to the Church and Government in the
several parts of your Diocese, and by them to inform your self, how these
Feasts havs been ordered for this last year, and how free they have been from
disorders, and to send me up an account of it, such as I may show to His
Majesty, of which you must not fail. And He doubts not, but that you will
perform the same like a wise and a prvdent Governor. Thus leaving this
business to your care, and NOTE.
desiring you to make as much convenient haste with it as you can I commend you
to Gods Grace, and rest,

Your Lordships very loving Friend, and Brother W. Cant.
Lambeth, October. 4. 1633.

To which Letter, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, made this return, thus
endorsed with the Archbishops own hand. Rece November 11: 1633. My Lord of
Bathes Certificate, about the Wakes and other Feasts in Somersetshire, etc.
found in his Study with his own forecited Letter.

MOst Reverend Father in God, and my very Honorable good Lord, my humble
service presented to your Grace. I received upon the 12th of October last, a
Letter from your Grace, dated the 4th of the same Month; wherein your Grace
has required me by a commandment from His Majesty, to send for some of the
gravest of my Clergy, and such as stand best affected to the Church and
Government, out of the several parts of my Diocese, and by them to inform my
self, how the annual Feasts of the Dedications of their Churches have been
kept within their several Parishes this last year, and how free they have
been from disorders. Now according to His Majesty's pleasure and Commandment
herein, presently after receipt of your Graces Letter, I sent forth my Letters
into all the several Deaneries within my Diocese, for some of the better* sort
of Clergy out of every Division, part and corner of Somersetshire to come unto
me, and so They were the deboystest and worst in the Country;
they did upon certain days appointed by me; And I find by the several
Answers of threescore and twelve Ministers, Benificed men, in whose Parishes
these Feasts are kept, as follows. First, that they have been kept not only
this last year, but also for many years before, as long as they have lived in
their several Parishes, without any disorders. Secondly, that upon the Feast
days, (which are for the most part every where upon Sundays) the Service of
the Church has bin more solemnly performed, and the Church has bin better
frequented, both in the Forenoons, and in the Afternoons, than upon any Sunday
in the year. Thirdly, that they have not known or heard of any disorders in
the Neighboring Towns, where the like Feasts are kept. Fourthly, that the
people do very much desire the continuance of those Feasts. Lastly, that all
these Ministers are of opinion, that it is fit and convenient these Feast days
should be continued, for a memorial of the Dedications of their several
Churches, for the civilizing of people, for their lawful Recreations, for the
composing of differences by occasion of the meeting of friends, for the
increase of love and unity, as being Feasts of Charity, for the relief of the
poor, the richer sort keeping then in a manner open house, and for many other
reasons.

This is the sum of their several free and voluntary Answers, which I have
in writing under their own hands, and will be ready to show if they be
required: which course I took, because it might not be given our hereafter by
those who condemn these Feasts, that I did mistake either their words, or
their meaning. And I do verily believe, that if I had sent for an hundred more
of the Clergy within my Diocese, I should have received the same Answer from
them all; because not one of those Ministers who appeared before me (although
they are almost all of them as yet strangers unto me, and most of them
strangers one to another) varied in the substance of his Answer from the rest;
nay most of them agree in their very phrases and words, and yet all of them
gave their Answers severally. So that I may liken these seventy and two
Ministers in this matter, unto the Septuag^nt, or seventy two Interpreters, who
agreed so soon in the Translation NOTE.
of the old Testament.

Now as I have made a true report of the Answers of these Ministers, so I
desire to set down some observations of mine own, which I have collected out
of their Answers.

I find that throughout Somersesshire, there are not only Feasts of
Dedication, but also in many places Church-ales, Clerkes-ales, and Bid-ales.
The Feasts of Dedications are more general and generally they are called
Feast-dayes, but in diverse places they are called Revell-dayes, they are not
known amongst the ignorant people by the name of Feasts of Dedication; but all
Scholars acknowledge them to be in the memory of their several Dedications,
and some Ministers of late have taught them so: Diverse Churches here are
Dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and they are kept upon Trinity Sunday; but
almost all those Feasts which are kept in memory of the Dedication of Churches
unto Saints, are kept upon some Sundays, either before or after the Saints
days; because (as I conceive) on the week days the people have not had
leisure to celebrate these Feasts. And I find that almost all the Feasts of
Dedication are kept in the Summer time, between our Lady Day and Michaelmas,
because that time of the year is most convenient for the meeting of Friends
from all places; in some places they have solemn Sermons Preached by Divines
of good note, and also Communions upon their Feast days; and in one place in
this County, the Parish holds Land by their Feast: And one Minister (who has
been a great Travailer) has inserted in his answer, that in some reformed
Churches, namely in Switzerland, these Feasts of Dedication are observed.

I find also that the people generally would by no means have these Feasts
taken away, for when the Constables of some Parishes came from the Assizes
about two years ago, and told their neighbors that the Judges would put down
these Feasts, they answered, that it was very hard if they could not entertain
their kindred and friends once in a year, to praise God for his Blessings, and
to pray for the Kings Majesty, under whose happy Government they enjoyed peace
and quietness; and they said, they would endure the Judges penalties, father
than they would break off their Feast days. It is found also true by
experience, that many Suits in Law have bin taken up at these Feasts by
mediation of friends, which could not have bin so soon ended in Westminster
Hall.

Moreover, I find that the chiefest cause of the dislike of these Feasts
amongst the Preciser sort is, becaose they are kept upon Sundays, which they
never call but Sabbath days, upon which they would have no manner of
Recreation, nay, NOTE.
neither Roast, nor Sod: And some of the Ministers who were with me have
ingenuously confessed, that if the people should not have their honest and
lawful Recreations upon Sundays after evening Prayer, they would go either
into tippling houses, and there upon their Ale-benches talk of matters of the
Church or State, or else into Conventicles.

Concerning Church-ales, I find, that in some places the people have bin
persuaded to leave them off, in other places they have bin put down by the
Judges NOTE.
and Justices, so that now there are very few of them left: but yet I find,
that by Church-ales heretofore many poor Parishes have cast their Bells,
repaired their Towers, beautified their Churches, and raised stocks for the
poor; and not by the sins of the people (as some Humourists have said:) but by
the Benevolence of people at their honest and harmless sports and pastimes; at
which there has not bin observed so much disorder, as is commonly at Fairs and
Markets.

Touching Clerke-ales (which are lesser Church-ales) for the better maintenance
of Parish Clerks, they have bin used (until of late) in diverse places, and
there was great reason for them; for in poor Country Parishes, where the
wages of the Clerk is very small, the people thinking it unfit that the Clerk
should duly attend at Church, and lose by his office, were wont to send him in
Provision, and then feast with him, and give him more liberality then their
quarterly payments would amount unto in many years. And since these have bin
put down, some Ministers have complained unto me, that they are afraid they
shall have no Parish Clerks for want of maintenance for them.

There is another kind of public meeting called a Bid-ale, when an honest
man decayed in his estate, is set up again by the liberal Benevolence and
Contribution of friends at a Feast, but this is laid aside almost in every
place.

But I fear I have wearied your Grace with this impertinent discourse of
Country Feasts: yet while I am in this discourse of Feasts, I may not forget
one thing wherein I have bin desired by a grave and learned Divine dwelling
near Taunton to move your Grace, and that is, that your Grace would be a means
that the Judges in their Lent Circuit might not sit and condemn people on that
great Feast day of the Annunciation.

And so having carefully endeavored to perform His Majesty's Commandment; I
cast my self down at His Majesty's feet, humbly begging His gracious pardon if
I have erred in any point: And I desire no longer to live, than I may be able
to do God, and His Majesty service in the Church; which although other Bishops
can perform with greater abilities than my self, yet none shall perform the
same with more readiness, diligence, and fidelity than I will do: And so
praying for the continance of your Graces health and happiness, I leave your
Grace to Gods blessed Protection, and humbly rest,

Your Graces ever to be Commanded, Guil. Bath and Wells.
Wells 5th November. 1633.

The next Assizes after this Certificate, the Archbishop sent for Chief
Justice Richardson, and commanded him to revoke the former Order made at the
Assizes, against Wakes, telling him, it was His Majesty's pleasure he should
reverse it: But he having no such command from the King Himself, neglected to
do it; whereupon the Archbishop made a new complaint to His Majesty against the
Judge; who thereupon sent for the Judge, and commanded him publicly to Reverse
that Order the next Assizes, as he would answer the controay at his peril;
notwithstanding he alleged, he had done it at the request of the Justices of
Peace in the County, with the general consent of the whole Bench, and upon
view of diverse ancient presidents in that kind: Whereupon Judge Richardson
the next Summer Assizes 1634. in his charge, informed the Justices, Grand Jury,
and Country; That he at their Request, together with his Brother Denham, had
made a very good Order for suppressing unruly Wakes, and Revells, wherein he
thought he had done God, the King and Country good service; but some ill
affected persons had misinformed His Majesty concerning this Order, who had
given him an express command to reverse it; which he conceived was hardly in
his power to do because it was no Order made by himself, but by the joint
consent of the whole Bench, and a mere confirmation and enlargment of diverse
Orders made by the Judges and Justices in that Circuit, in Queen Elizabeth's,
King James, and King Charles their Reigns, before ever he came into those
parts: for which he produced these following Presidents.

The first was an Order made at a Sessions in Somersetshire in the 38. of
Queen Elizabeth.

Orders made by the Justices Assembled at Bridgwater Sessions the 10th of
September, Anno Reg: Elizabetica 38. etc.
THat no Church Ale, Clerks Ale, Bid Ale, or tippling be suffered, And that
such only be suffered to tipple as be or shall be lawfully licensed according to
the Order made in this Sessions.

SIGNED; John Popham Alexander Popham John Court Henry Waldron Edward Hext.
George Sydenham, Thomas Horner, John Colles, John May, John ^odney.


The second was this Order of Sessions made at the same place, whereto he found
the name of one Thomas Philips, subscribed; but he knew not who he was (at
which Sir Robert Philips, his Son, who sticled for these Wakes, was much
incensed, as conceiving it a mere jeare against him.)

At the Sessions at Bridgwater, the 28th of September 1594.
IT is is Ordered and agreed, that no Church-Ale be admitted to be kept within
any part of this shiere. And that by the Justices of the Peace of the Lymits,
notice thereof be given to the several parishes within their Lymits, and that
such as shall offend in keeping any such be duly punished.

John Popham, Lord ^hiefe Justice. George Sidnam Knight, Henry Barkley Knight.
George Speak Henry Waldron, Alexander Colles, John Frances, Alexander Popham
John Lancaster, Edward Hext, Thomas Phillips.


The third was an Order of Sessions made in the County of Devon, Anno 1599.

This Order was agreed on by all the Queens Majesty's Justices of the Peace at
the Chapter House Assembled the 10th day of January, 1599. Anno 41. Elizabethae.
ANd for as much as it appears that many enormities [that with modesty
cannot be expressed] heretofore have happened by Church Ales and Revells in this
County of Devon: It is therefore Ordered that Church-Ales and Revells shall be
hence forth utterly suppressed. And if contrary wise in contempt of this Order
preparation be made for any to be kept, any Justices of this County forthwith
send for such as make preparation, to admonish them to make stay thereof, and
upon their refusal in that behalf, or proceeding therein, to bind them that
make such preparation to the good behavior, and to appear at the next
Sessions of the Peace to be holden within this County of Devon, then and there
to endure such punishment as either by the Laws of the Realm or Order of this
Court shall be inflicted upon them for their contempt and disobeying this
Order.

The fourth was this following Order made at the Assizes in Devonshire, Anno
1615.

From the Assizes held at the Castle of Exeter, July 24. 1615. Anno 13. Jacobi,
etc. Sir Laurence Tanneld, and Sergeant Mountague, Justices of Assize, etc.
THe several Manslaughters committed at two Church-ales within this County,
since the beginning of this present Month of July, and further advertisements
given now unto the Court of the continual profanation of Gods Sabbath, at
these and other such like unlawful meetings, ministers unto this Court just
occasion NOTE.
to recite an Order formerly set down by the Reverend Judges of Assize, at the
Assizes holden for this County, the 19th day of July, in the year of the
Reign of our Sovereign Lord King James, by the Grace of God of England,
France, and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, etc. the 11th, and of Scotland
the 46th, that Order being as follows, viz. It is Ordered by the Court, in
regard of the infinite number of inconveniences daily arising, by means of
Revells, Church-Ales, and Bull-baitings, that all such Revells, Church-ales,
and Bull-baitings be from henceforth utterly suppressed; and if hereafter it
shall be made known unto the Justices of the Peace of this County, of any such
to be set up, or hereafter used, that then the Justices of the Peace within
their several Divisions, take course, as well for the speedy apprehending and
punishment of idle and lewd people drawn together to such places, as for the
binding over of the Persons using tippling, and for the inflicting of further
punishment upon all offenders in such places, as in their discretion shall be
thought fit. And to the end that this Order may be the better observed; NOTE.
It is Ordered, that this be speedily published in every Parish Church within
this County.

The fifth was an Order made in the same County, Anno 1627.

An Order made by Sir John Walter Knight, Chief Baron of his Majesty's
Exchequer and Sir John Denham Knight Justices of Assize for, etc. at the Castle
of Exon the XXIII. of July 1627.
WHereas diverse Orders have bin heretofore made by the Judges of Assize for
the suppression of all Ales and Revels, those same Orders are now confirmed at
this Assize, and again Ordered by the Court in regard of the infinite number of
inconveniences NOTE.
daily arising by means of Revels, Church-Ales, Clerks-Ales and public Ales
that they be from henceforth utterly suppressed. And if hereafter it shall be
made known to the Justices of Peace of this County of any such to be kept or
hereafter used, that then the Justices of the Peace within their several
divisions take course as well for the speedy apprehending and punishment of
idle vagrant people, drawn together to such places, as for the binding over of
the persons using such tippling, and for inflicting of such punishment upon all
Offenders in such places as the Law does inflict. And to the end that this
Order may be the better observed, it is further Ordered that the Clerk of
Assize shall leave a Copy hereof with the Clerk of the Peace, and the under
Sherriffe, and from them or one of them, every Constable shall take a Copy for
his several hundred and liberty, and shall particularly NOTE.
deliver a Copy to the Minister of every Parish within his several hundred and
liberty, and shall take a note of every Minister under his hand, of the day
upon which he received it from him; and that every Minister which so receives
it shall publish it yearly in his Parish Church the first Sunday in February.
And it is likewise further Ordered, that every Constable shall at every Lent
Assize present to the Judges of this Circuit, a note of the receipt of the said
Order under the hands of the said Ministers. And for the further avoiding of
the concourse of idle people, it is further Ordered, that such persons as
usually carry up and down Bulls and Bears to bait [being Rogues by Statute]
shall be punished as Rogues, for the further prevention of such inconveniences
as usually happen upon such meetings.

Per me Simon Spatchurst Clericum Asiisor.

The 6. an Order made by Baron Denham at the Assizes in Somersetshire, Anno
1627. upon a Petition of diverse Ministers.

To the Honorable Sir John Denham Knight, one of the Barons of His Majesty's
Exchequor, and Justice of Assize for the County of SOMERSET.
The humble Petition of the Ministers, whose names are subscribed.

Shows;

THat whereas at the last Summer Assizes held for the County of Dorset; there
was an Order made for the suppressing of all Revells, Church-Ales, and other
public Ales [amongst other things] as by the Copy of the said Order hereunto
annexed appears.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly desire that Your Lordship would be pleased
to grant the like Order at this Assizes for the suppressing of the like Ales
and disorders in this County of Somerset.

So they shall always pray for Your Lordships long health and prosperity, Adam
Abraham John Ford. William ^yllet. John Fathers. Ralph Turner. George Drake.

15. Marcii 1627.
Let the Clerk of the Assizes draw up the like (...) for his County. John
Denham.

Which former Order being warranted by so many Presidents, Judge Richardson
said, he conceived he had no power absolutely to reverse; but being commanded
to do it, by His Majesty, he did as much as in him lay revoke it; but yet
doubted not, that if the Justices of Peace would truly inform His Majesty of
the grounds of the former Order, and of the great disorders occasioned by
Wakes, and Churchales His Majesty would give Order to revive it; but how ever,
he must make this Order for the present, which he caused he Clerk of Assizes to
enter.

Whereas diverse Orders have been heretofore made by the Judges of Assize, for
the suppressing of Church-ales, Clerks-ales, Wakes, Revells and such like
within this County of Somerset, which were formerly made by the Judges, by
reason of many disorders and misdemeanors arising upon the meeting of
multitudes of people out of other Parishes. It is now Ordered by his Lordship,
that all former Orders heretofore made by any Judges or Justices, for the
suppressing of Church-ales, Clerks-ales, Wakes and Revells be revoked [as much
as in him lyeth] and made utterly void. And that it may be lawful for all
persons freely to use any lawful Recreation or Exercise at such meetings, but
with this advice, that they be careful that no outrages or misdemeanors
commonly arising at such Church-ales, Clerk-ales, Wakes and Revells be done or
committed.

Hereupon, all the Justices of Peace then present, immediately after they had
dined, drew up this Petition to His Majesty, which they Signed with all their
hands, and then sent it up to London by John Harrington Esquier, then Custos
Rotulorum in that County, with order to deliver it to the Right Honorable
Earl of Pembrook, Lord Lieutenant of the County, to present it to His Majesty.
Who repairing to London accordingly, showed the Petition to Master Prynne, and
the Earl being then in the Country, whence he would not return in twelve
days space, he advised with him what course to take for presenting the
Petition to His Majesty in the mean time, lest the Archbishop hearing of it,
should prevent the same: The Archbishop having notice of this Petition from Sir
Robert Philips and Bishop Pierce, to prevent the delivery and expected good
effect thereof; presently caused the Declaration for Sports published by King
James, with some additions of his own at the end concerning Wakes, and Feasts
of Dedication, relating the Order of Judge Richardson for suppressing them, to
be reprinted and published in His Majesty's Name, before the Petition
delivered, the Copy whereof, is here subjoyned.

To the KINGS most Excellent Majesty.
The most humble Petition of the Justices of the Peace, of the County of
Somerset.

MOst humbly Showing; That whereas heretofore there have bin from time to ^e
several good Orders made by the Justices of Assize, and Justices of the Peace,
for the County of Somerset, for the restraining and suppressing of certain
disordered Assemblies in that County, called Church-ales, Clerkes-ales,
Bid-ales, Wakes, and Revells, by reason of many disorders inseperably
accompanying the same; whereby the said Assemblies have for the most part for a
long time been forborne and not used, to the great good and quiet of the said
County.

Now so it is may please Your Majesty, that by occasion of a Declaration
published the last Assizes by the Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, for
restoring of Wakes and Revells, and Revering of all Orders made against them,
and by reason of a rumor thereof spread in the Country since the last Lent
Assizes, not only all the disorders aforesaid of Profanation of the Lords
Day, riotous tippling, contempt of NOTE.
Authority, Quarrels, Murders, etc. frequently overflowing the said
Assemblies, have increased this Summer, but even the other disorderly
Assembliss of Church-Ales, Bid-Ales, Clerkes-Ales, condemned by the Laws, have
again been set up to the great prejudice of the Peace, plenty, and good
Government of the County.

May it therefore please Your most Excellent Majesty, to grant us some more
particular Declaration herein, That Your Majesty's Command concerning Revells
may not be thought to extend farther then to the upholding of Civil Feasting
between Neighbor and Neighbor in their Houses, and the orderly and
seasonable use of manly Exercises and Activities, which we all shall be most
ready to maintain: And that we may have Your Majesty's Favor and Allowance to
suppress all the forementioned unlawful Assemblies of Church-Ales,
Clerks-Ales, and Bid-Ales, and to punish all the forementioned disorders as
heretofore we have done, Wherein Your Petitioners have no other end, than to do
Your Majesty faithful service, and to preserve the good Government of the
County.

By all these Premised evidences, it is most apparent, that the Archbishop was
the principal Actor in the publication of this Licentious Book, to Gods, and
his Majesty's dishonor, which we shall further evidence by this writing under
his own hand.

The Declaration concerning Lawful sports on the Lords day, His Majesty
Commanded me to se it Printed. The motives to it were, 1. A general and
superstitious opinion conceived of that day. 2. A Book set out by Theophilus
Brabourne, 1628. Iudaisme upon Christian principles, and perverted many. 3. A
great distemper in Somersetshire, upon the forbiding of the wakes, in the
sowernesse of this opinion; an Act of a Judge that rid that Circuit, March. 15.
1627. And followed by another. 1630. And his Majesty troubled with Petitions,
and motions by some chief men of that county on both sides. 4. His Royal
Fathers example upon the like occasions in Lancashire

After the publishing of this Declaration, the Lord Richardson returning from
his Circuit, was by the Archbishops means convented before the King and Lords
at the Council Table, about the forementioned Passages in his Charge, in
justification of the order against Wakes, according to his duty, and for
revoking it in such a slight manner, as much as in him lay; for which he was so
shaken up by the Archbishop, that coming very dejectedly with tears in his
eyes out of the Council Chamber, the Earl of Derset seeing him in such a sad
condition, and demanding him how he did? he answered, Very ill my Lord for I
am like to be choked with the Archbishops Lawn-sleeves. And for this cause
alone, (as he and others conceived) he was by the Archbishops means (to his
great grief and loss) put from Riding the Western, and enforced to Ride the
Essex Circuit, reputed the meanest of all others, which no Chief Justice, but
the puny Judge, or Sergeants only used to Ride; notwithstanding the Lord
Cottington and others earnestly moved His Majesty, that he might ride some
other Circuit.

After this, the Archbishop intending to make this Declaration for Sports, an
Engine to ensnare; suspend silence, and root out all conscientious, preaching
Ministers throughout the Realm, by degrees the better to usher in Popery,
Ignorance, and profaneness; enjoined all Ministers to read this Declaration
personally in their Churches, in time of Divine Service; and such who out of
conscience refused to read it were by the Archbishops own special direction
suspended from their office and Benefice, Excommunicated, vexed in the
High Commission and some of them there sentenced and deprived of their livings
for this pretended crime, though against no Law or Canon of God or man; for
proof whereof, these ensuing testimonies were produced.

First, Sir Nathaniell Brent attested upon Oath, that when he was appointed by
the Archbishop as his Vicar General, to Visit within the Diocese of
Canterbury, the Archbishop himself gave him a special charge to convent all
Ministers before him, who would not read the Book for sports on the Lords day,
and to suspend them for it; and that he gave them particular order, by name to
suspend, Mr. Culmer, Master Player, and Mr. Hieron, three eminent preaching
Ministers in Kent, for not Mr. Culmers. Mr. Players, and Mr. Hierons cases.
reading the said Book of Sports: Whereupon, he did (much against his will and
judgment) suspend them all ab Officio, and Beneficio, and forced some of them
to allow twenty pound a piece or more, to Officiate the Cure during their
suspension. After which, he received another special command from the
Archbishop, to suspend Mr. Wilson, for the selfsame cause, whereupon he did
accordingly suspend him.

Master Richard Culmer, deposed at the Lords Bar upon oath, that he being
Minister of Goodneston in the County of Kent, Mr. John Player Minister of
Kennington, and Mr. Thomas Hieron Minister of Hornhill in the said County, they
were all three convented by the Archbishops direction before Sir Nathaniell
Brent, for not reading the Book for Lord's Day sports, and after that, all
three of them suspended from their Ministry and Livings in the Archbishops
Consistory, for the same. Whereupon, they soon after repaired to Lambeth to
the Archbishop, and there jointly Petitioned him for Absolution from this
unjust Suspension; who reading their Petition, and understanding the cause of
their suspension, for not reading that unwarrantable Declaration, the
Archbishop gave them this peremptory Answer; If you know not how to obey, I
know not how to grant; whereupon they continued thus suspended about three
whole years and seven Months, not being permitted to preach or instruct their
people, to their great grief, and the profits of their Livings were sequestered
toward the maintenance of Deboist unedifying Curates, who seldom preached.
And though this Deponent did diverse times afterward Petition the said
Archbishop to take off his suspension, yet he refused to do it, calling him
refractory fellow, and saying, it should continue; and so it did, he being not
only deprived of his Ministry, but also of all the profits of his Living,
having himself, his Wife, and 7. small Children to provide for; which
suspension and sequestration continued upon him till the Scotts coming in, and
then the Archbishop Absolved him, more out of fear of the Scots, than good
will; so as he might justly say, Gramercy good Scott, for his liberty.

Master Thomas Wilson a godly learned Minister (now of the Assembly) deposed
Mr. Thomas VVilsons case.
at the Bar; that the Archbishop himself sent for him to Lambeth, and
demanded of him, whether he had publicly read the Book of Sports in the
Church? to which he answered, no; whereupon the Archbishop replied; I Suspend
you for ever from your office and Benefice till you read it: whereupon he was
suspended, and his Living sequestered for four years space. After which, he was
brought into the High Commission at Lambeth, by the Archbishops means, and
there Articled against for not reading the said Book, to his great cost and
vexation.

Master Prynne attested, that Mr. Wrath, and M. Erbery, were brought up out of
Wales, Mr. William Jones out of Glocestershire, and diverse others from other Mr
VVraths. Mr. Erberies. and Mr. Jones cases.
parts into the High Commission at Lambeth, for not reading this Declaration
for Pastimes on the Lords day, and the keeping of Wakes, and Church-ales; and
that he found this following Petition concerning the same subject among Sir
John Lambs sequestered papers, with an Answer to it under the Archbishops own
hand, manifesting his own direction for prosecuting of one Henry Page, a godly
Vicar, in the High Commission, for refusing to read this Declaration, and
expressing his dislike thereof.

To the most Reverend Father in God, William, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his
Grace, Primate, etc.
The humble Petition of Francis Thompson, Gent.

IN all Duty shows, That whereas one Henry Page Vicar of Sedbury in the
County of Hereford, having taken upon him the Cure of Souls, there has many
times used diverse and sundry scandalous and ignominious speeches in the Pulpit
and elsewhere, and more especially upon the fourth Commandment: both by
preaching, and otherwise, he has in contempt of the Kings most Excellent
Majestis Declaration, concerning the lawfulness of Recreations upon Sundays
and holy days after time of Divine Service, and in derision and scorn of the
Book set forth by His Majesty to that purpose, often amongst other his
opprobrious and disgraceful speeches, uttered these words following concerning
the same, viz. Is it not as lawful to pluck at a Cartrope upon the Sabbath
day, as at a Bell-rope? Is it not as lawful for a Weaver to shoot his shuttle
in the Sabbath day, as for a man to take his Bow to shoot? And is it not as
lawful for a Woman to spinne at her wheel, or for a man to go to Plough or
Cart, as for a man in the Sabbath day to dance that devilish round? All which
words, and diverse other of the like kind, your Petitioner will be bound to
prove unto your Grace, and the honorable Court of high Commisiion. May it
therefore please your Grace for the Reformation of the said Mr. Page, and
satisfaction of his Parishioners consciences, and other inhabitants there
abouts, who daily flock unto him, by reason of inveigling them with such his
Doctrine, to grant an Attachment or Letters Missive to issue out against him
the said Page, to bring him to Answer to such Articles as shall be exhibited
into the said Court against him. And your Petitioner as in duty, shall daily
pray for your Graces long life and happiness.

NOTE.
I desire Dr. Merrick to consider of the suggestions of this Petition, and take
order for Letters Missive if he see cause.

Among which Papers he likewise met with this Certificate, manifesting that not
only Sir Nathaniell Brent, but Sir John Lamb in the Archbishops
Metropoliticall Visitation, did peremptorily enjoyne all ministers in the
Archbishops name to read this Declaration for sports on the Lords Day to the
people in Churches, to animate them to prophan it, though not prescribed in his
printed visitation Articles.

To the Right Worshipful Sir John Lamb, Knight, Doctor of Law, Commissary to
the Lords Grace of Canterbury, for the Archdeaconry of Huntington, etc.
THese are to certify, that Thomas Gibbs Master of Art, and Curate of Hitchin
in Hartfordshire, within the Archdeaconry of Huntington, according to your
Injunction at the Visitation there holden, did distinctly and treatably read
upon the 29th of April, being Sunday at Morning Prayer, after the reading of
the first Lesson, appointed for the day (most of the Parish then being present)
the Book entitled, The Kings Majesty's Declaration to His Subjects, concerning
lawful sports to be used.

And with 3. Petitions of Mr. Valentines to the Archbishop, suspended for not
reading the Book of sports, referred to Sir John Lamb, who endorsed on one of
them with his own hand, that he had received enclosed therein A Bribe of five
pound.

Besides, in the Abstract of the Archbishops Metropoliticall Visitation, in the
year 1635. found in his Study by Master Prynne, there are these Passages
concerning the Book of sports. Master Fairfax Curate of Rumborough, Charged
with inconformity, has faithfully promised to read the Declaration for lawful
sports. I suspended NOTE.
one Master Pegges of VVeeford, ex nunc pro ut ex tunc, in case he did not read
the Kings Declaration for sports on Sunday seven-night following. There are
diverse in Surrey that refuse to read the Kings Declaration for lawful sports
on Sundays, besides those that stand suspended for the fault. Doctor Howell a
very worthy Divine, gave me a note of their Names; they are Master Whitfield of
Ockly, Mr. Garth. of Wouersh, Mr. Ward of Pepper-harrow, and Mr. Farroll of
Purbright, all of them of the Lecture of Guilford, and some of them of the
Lecture of Darking, who were afterward prosecuted for it. All these are
unfallible Evidences, that the Archbishop was the original principal Author
and enforcer of this Declaration upon Godly Ministers against both Law and
conscience, himself and his Servants playing some times at Boules upon the
Lords own day, to give good example unto others, and persecuting those with
infinite severity to the ruing of their Flocks, Families, who out of conscience
durst not publish it: Of which we shall produce one signal example more in the
case of Mr. Lawrence Snelling a reverend, Godly, learned Minister deprived in
the High Commission, for not reading this Declaration. Mr. Snelling himself

restified upon Oath, that he was suspended from his Ministry, Living,
excommunicated, and soon after that brought into the High Commission at
Lambheth, and there sentenced to be deprived from his benefice, loosing the
profits thereof, full four years space, only for refusing to read this
Declaration for sports. That He there pleaded in his own defense the Law of
God and of the Realm, the Authorities of Counsels, Fathers, and late Writers
of all sorts: That the Declaration it self appeared not to be his Majesty's,
though published in his name, it being not enrolled in any Court, nor published
under his great Seal as all Proclamations, and Briefes to be read in Churches
are: that there was no command at all of the Kings it should be read by any in
Churches, much less by Ministers; no punishment threatened nor prescribed for
not reading it no authority given to Archbishops, Bishops, High Commissioners,
or any other persons to question, suspend or punish any Minister for not
reading it; and being a mere civil, not Ecclesiastical Declaration, not
enjoined by any Ecclesiastical Canon or Authority, but temporal only, no
Ecclesiastical Judges could take cognisans of it, much less inflict any
ecclesiastical censure for it, especially in the high Commission, it being no
offense with in the Statute of 1. Eliz. chapter 1. or the Kings Commission
Ecclesiastical, whereby the High Commissioners sit, and so not questionabl by
them. Al which particulars he put into his answer and defense, but the
Archbishop gave order not to accept his Answer or defense as he tendered them,
saying openly in Court, That whosoever should make such a Defense as he had
don, it should be burnt before his face, and he laid by the heels for his
pains; whereupon the Commissioners expunged what they pleased out of his
Answer and defense, and then censured him: Mr. Gellibrand, deposed the same
with Mr. Snelling, whose censure was there produced out of the High Commission
records, and here subjoyned.

The Cause is to be informed in, and finally sentenced out of the said Master
Snellings answer, and he is to appear this day to hear and receive the final
order and judgment of the Court. at which day and place the said Lawrence
Snelling being publicly called for, appeared personally in whose presence the
Articles in this cause exhibited against him with his answers made thereunto,
were publicly read, and then Mr. Doctor Ryues his Majesty's Advocate pressed
and enforced the proofs against the said Master Snelling according as they
appeared confessed out of his answers, and after that the said Mr. Snelling was
heard what he could say in his own defense, and after a mature and deliberat
hearing of this cause, it appeared to the Court;

That the said Mr. Snelling was here charged, for that he being a Minister in
holy orders of Priesthood, constituted by the Authority of the Church for these
20. years last past and upwards, Rector of Paulscray aforesaid for all that
time and upwards, was within these four or five years last past made
acquainted that a certain Book entitled, The Kings Majesty's Declaration for
lawful recreations after Evening Prayers on Sundays and Holy days, was come
forth and There was no such command of his Majesty's.
commanded by NOTE.
his Majesty to be read by all Ministers in their respective Parish Churches,
and presented to Mr. Doctor Wood Chauncellor of Rochester, his Ordinary, on the
20th. of November 1643. for refusing to read and publish the same in his Parish
Church of Paulscray.

That upon the said presentment, he was by his said Ordinary personally
monished to read the same within three weeks following, That on the eleventh
of December, 1634. aforesaid, he the said Laurence Snelling being again
Convented before his said ordinary, was primo, secundo, and tertio, personally
and Judicially monished in Court to read and publish the said Book in manner
aforesaid, which he refusing, was suspended ob officio and beneficio, and has
so continued until this present, and does so still continue unreleased, that
on the third of April 1635. the said Laurence Snelling being present in Court
before his Ordinary was 10. 20. and 30. Judicially admonished to read and
publish the said Book for Lawful recreations as aforesaid, but did again
utterly refuse to publish or read the same, and was thereupon then
excommunicated by his said Ordinary, and has so continued NOTE.
ever since and does so still continue excommunicated: that within the time

parts of Divine service, and to wear the Surplice, and further, that he has
not bowed his body, nor made any corporal obeisance at the reading or hearing
read the Blessed name of our Savior Jesus.

All which the premises appearing to be true in Substance and in effect out of
the said Mr. Snellings answers, the Court proceeded to the giving of their
sentence in this Cause, and for the present, did order, that unless the said
Mr. Snelling shall conform himself to the aforesaid requisitions of his
Ordinary, and read and publish the said Book for lawful recreations, etc. and
do all due obeisance and Reverence at the blessed name of our Savior Jesus,
betwixt this and the second Court day of the next Term, he should be ex nunc,
pro ut extunc, etc. deprived of his Rectory of Paulscray aforesaid, but pay no
costs of suit in case he be deprived; and to this end and purpose, he the said
Mr. Snelling being present in Court, was Juditially admonished NOTE.
to read and publish the said Book, and to make corporal reverence at the
name of our Savior Jesus sub pena Iuris, and deprivationis. And to the end
that he may safely repair to his Parish Church to practice, and certify of
his conformity in the premises in case he shall be willing to conform
accordingly, it was by the Court referred to the foresaid Ordinary Mr. Doctor
Wood to absolve the said Master Snelling from the said sentence of
Excommunication, under which he now stands, in case he shall come and desire it
of his said Ordinary, and take his oath de parendo Iuri, and stando mandatis
Ecclesia, etc. according to the form in this case provided.

For not doing whereof, he was accordingly deprived; and continued sequestered
excommunicated, and deprived of his living diverse years, to his intolerable
oppression and prejudice.

When the Archbishop had thus privily by secret Instructions to his Visitors
enjoined the reading of this Book of sports to Ministers, and suspended,
censured, molested diverse of them for not reading it, he then conspiring
together with many other popish Prelates, to suppress all painful preaching
Orthodox Ministers by color of it, encouraged, directed, if not enjoined them
and their Archdeacons to insert this clause into their printed Visitation
Articles, to be inquired of, and presented by Churchwardens upon Oath, Whether
the Kings Declaration for sports had been read and published among them by the
Minister? To prove this we shall instance only in the Visitation Articles of
Matthew Wren Bishop of Norwich, printed at London, 1636. and in Richard
Mountague his successors Visitation Articles for the same Diocese, printed at
Cambridg, 1638. both which prescribe this following Interrogatory to be
inquired of upon oath, the later clause whereof, contradictes the former, Sect
7. Do any in your Parishprophane any Sunday or holy day by any unlawful
gaming, drinking or Tippling in Taverns, Innes, or Alehouses, in the time of
Common Prayer or Sermon, or by Working or doing the work of their Trades and
occupations? Do any in your Parish buy or sell, or keep open their Shops, or
set out any Wares to be sold on Sundays or holy days by themselves, their
Servants or Apprentises, or have they any other ways Profaned the said days?
And has the Kings Declaration concerning the use of lawful sports and
recreations been published among you, yea, or no? If so, when was it don, NOTE.
in what manner, and by whom?

The like Interrogatories in effect, if not in terminis, we find in Bishop
Pierces, Bishop Curles, Bishop Skinners, the Archdeacons of Middlesex, with
other Visitation Articles, which for brevity we pretermit: How many hundred
Godly Ministers in these and other Bishops Diocese were suspended from their
Ministry, sequestered driven from their Livings, excommunicated, Prosecuted in
the High Commission, and forced to leave the Kingdom upon these Articles, for
not publishing this Declaration, is so experimentaly known to all, that We shall
pretermit it without any enumeration of their names or cases. Only we shall
discover what hand and influence the Archbishop had in their several
suspentions, persecutions, by these ensuing Accounts, given up to him by other
Bishops of their proceedings herein, found in his Study endorsed with his own
hand and witnessed by Mr. Prynne who seized them. In Bishop Wrens account to
the Archbishop December 17. 1636. (which begin thus. In the name of God, Amen:
An account touching the Royal Instructions given by the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, to the most Reverend Father in God William Laud Archbishop of Cant.
his Grace, Primat and Metropolitan of all England, concerning Orders to be
observed by all the Bishops of that Province. To the several Articles of which
Jnstructions, I Matthew Lord Bishop of Norwich thus humbly make Answer and in
Order,) We find this observable Answer given.

To the 12. Article. That upon enquiry at my Visitation, whether the Kings
Majesty's Declaration for lawful sports had been published? I found it had
not been done in NOTE.
very many places of the Diocese, having therefore about 60. Books at hand, I
caused them to be proposed to such persons, as I had most doubt of, but many
of them refused to publish the same, and were suspended for their refusal: yet
diverse of them presently promised conformity, and so were absolved. So that now
in the whole Diocese (consisting of about 1500. Clergy men) there are not
passing twice 15. Excommunicated or suspended; whereof, some so stand for
contumacie in not appearing at the Visitation and Synod, and still refuse to
submit, some for obstinate denying to publish the Kings Declaration.

By the Title and answer of which it is most evident; That the Archbish. sent
several Articles of Instructions in his Majesty's name, though made by
himself, to all the Bishops of his Province, who were to return an Annual
account of them unto him in writing; whereof this was one: That they should
inquire, whether the Declaration for sports had been published in every parish
Church by the Minister? and directed them to excommunicate or suspend all such
who refused to read it. Which how barbarously and unchristianly* it was
executed in most places, needs no further evidence then that already produced,
and what all men know.

Now we appeal to all Ecclesiastical Histories, from Christ's Nativity till
this instant, whether there was ever such a monstrous impiety or persecution as
this heard of in the Christian world, that Archbishops, and Bishops (who
profess themselves the very Fathers of the Church, and Pillars of Religion,)
should thus impiously: First of all abuse a Christian Prince so far, as to
publish a Declaration for the free use and encouragement of such sports and
Pastimes on the Lord's Day, as are (some of them) unlawful on any day, and
constantly prohibited, condemned by Fathers, Counsels, Imperial Laws, Edicts
of most Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes, States, and the whole torrent of
Christian Writers, as altogether unsufferable on the Lords Day. Secondly, to
injoyne Books expressly tending to the profanation of the Lords day, by sports
and pastimes, to be publicly read in Churches by the Ministers to their
Congregations on this very day, to encourage, authorize them (though over-prone
thereto without any such instigation) to profane it. 3. To suspend, sequester,
excommunicate, censure, persecute, deprive, even hundreds of Godly Ministers as
capital Offenders, for refusing (merely out of Conscience toward God, and
love to their own and peoples souls,) to contribute their voices or personal
assistances to such a publication, and against all Law, Justice, Piety, to
silence Ministers three or four years together from preaching Gods Word to
their people, for the salvation of their souls according to their duties
because they durst not publish this Declaration for Lord's Day sports unto them
to further the damnation of their souls, both against their duties and
consciences. Such a Monster of most desperate unparalled impiety, profaneness,
persecution as this, was never borne in the Christian world till this Ghostly
Father, Archbishop Laud, begot and nourished it in our Church: for which how
well he demerited the Popes Titles, of YOUR HOLINESS and MOST HOLY FATHER, let
the University of Oxford, and Mr. Croxton seriously consider, who bestowed them
on him several times. Doubtless his more then Popish superstition in
Consecrating Churches, Churchyards, Chappells, and prohibiting all
prophannations of them by Enterludes, Dancing, Musters, Leets, teaching of
Scholars, and the like, might have lessoned In his Metropoliticall Visitation
Articles
him to have been as zealous against profaning Sacred days as places, with
unholie Pastimes, or secular Negotiations: But because the Lord's Day Sabbath
was not hallowed by Bishops themselves (as Churches, Chappells, or Churchyards
were according to the Model of the Roman Pontifical) but by Christ and his
Apostles, who never authorized Bishops or any else to Consecrate Churches, or
other places in this sort; they presume to authorize men thus openly to
profane the one without check or punishment, but not the other, under the
severest Anathema Maranatha. Enough eternally to stigmatize this Arch-Prelate
with the blackest brand of Arrogance and Impiety, who made but a mere sport of
profaning Gods own day with sports, and silencing Godly Ministers for not
being so profane in this kind as himself was, (who used to play at bowls on
this very day, a pretty Archipiscopall Sabbath Recreation) or so profane as he
would have them to be, against the dictate of their own Consciences.

We have given you in a very full and copious evidence of the Archbishops
endeavors, practices to subvert our established Protestant Religion, and usher
in Popery among us, by introducing several Popish Innovations, superstitious
Ceremonies, Idolatrous impieties, practices and prophanations into our Church,
being all mere matters of fact notoriously visible to the world, and eyes of
all men.

We shall now proceed in the second place to discover his atempts, and manifest
his proceedings in this kind by bringing in Popish Tenants and doctrines by
degrees; The Archbishops proceedings to subvert Religion, by introducing
Doctrinall Points of Popery.
wherein we shall so fully uncase this Romish Fox, as notwithstanding all his
shifts and subterfuges) to evidence him the most Pestilent Jesuiticall
underminer, subverter of the established doctrines of the Church of England,
the Archest advancer of the Erroneous Positions of the Church of Rome, that
ever breathed in our English Air. And here we meet not only with a Narrow
Episcopal See, but vast boundless Ocean of evidence to sail in.

That there has bin for many years last past, a secret plotted Conspiracy,
and serious endeavor between sundry pretended members of the Church of
England, and real Sons of the Church of Rome, to extirpate the Protestant
Religion, and instead thereof to set up Popish superstition and Idolatry; has
been already abundantly manifested to the World, in A necessary Introduction
to the History of the Archbishop of Canterbury his Trial, by sundry foreign
and domestic evidences: how far this Archbishop was an Arch-agent in
promoting this conspiracy in point of Doctrinall Popery, and by what
Jesuiticall Policies and degrees he proceeded in it, comes now in Order to be
proved; wherein we shall steare the course of our evidence, according to the
compass and method of his proceedings.

It is the common Policy of all wise experienced Commanders, when they intend
to undermine any strong well-fortified defensible Fortress, not desperately to
begin their Mines at the very foundation of the Works at first, for fear of
discovery, danger, prevention, but at a competent distance, and then to make
their approaches by insensible degrees, till at last they have undermined, or
blown up the very Walls and Works themselves; The selfsame Policy was used
by this Arch-Roman Ingineer to undermine and blow up our established Religion:
He had learnt from Abbot Bernard: A minimis incipiunt, qui in maxima proruunt;
and from De Ordine Vitae lib.
Chrysostom: Id certe moris est apud haereticos, ut adumbrant seipsos and
occultent in principijs, quousque majorem fiduciam capeant, and quodam favore
multitudinis juventur: and tunc contagiosa * Homil. 47. in Matthew.
sua venena intrepide effundunt. Wherefore he began his mines at some seeming
distance, and set blindes before them, to prevent discovery. To this purpose
combining with the Jesuits, and prosecuting their very method to ruin our
Religion, he first bent all his force and industry to introduce Arminianisme
(the most plausible less discernible NOTE.
Doctrinall part of Popery, yet a ready Jesuiticall Posterne to let in all the
rest) and that under a specious pretense of opposing Puritanisme and Puritans
only, against whom he labored to engage some Prelates, and the Duke of
Buckingham first, then next His Majesty. This practice of his he began in
Oxford in a Sermon preached by him on Shrove-Sunday, Anno 1614. for which he
was then publicly (though not * Thus endorsed by him: April 18. 1615 The Copy
of a Letter which I sent to the Lord Bishop of Lincoln, concerning a Sermon,
in which Dr. Abbots had wronged me in the University.
by name) taxed by Learned Dr. Robert Abbot, Dr. of the Chair in Oxford, in
his Sermon all Saint Peter's, on Easter day, 1615. as appears by a Letter, and
Notes of this Sermon under his own hand, sent by him to the then Bishop of
Lincoln his great Patron: viz. That men under pretense of truth, and preaching
against the Puritans, strike at the heart and root of Faith and Religion now
established among us. That this preaching against the Puritans, was but the
practice of Persons, and Campions Council, when they came into England to
seduce young Students. And when many of them were afraid to loose their places,
if they should professedly be thus, the council they then gave them was, that
they should speak freely against the Puritans, and that should suffice. And
they cannot intend that they are accounted Papists, because they speak against
the Puritans, but because THEY INDEED ARE PAPISTS, they speak nothing against
them. If they do at any time speak against NOTE.
the Papists they do beat a little upon the bush, and that softly too for fear
of troubling or disquieting the Birds which are in it. They speak of nothing,
but that in which one Papist will speak against another; as against
Aequivocation, the Popes temporal Authority, and the like: and perhaps against
some of their Blasphemous speeches: But in the point of Free Will,
Justification, Concupiscens being sin after Baptism, Inhaerent
Righteousness, and certainty of Salvation, etc. (wherein Papists and Arminians
concur) the Papists beyond the Seas, can say; They ARE WHOLLY THEIRS, and the
Recusants at home make their braggs of them. And in all things they keep
themselves so near the brinke, that upon any occasion they may step over to
them: etc. From this Passage of Doctor Abbot (which Laud then confessed in his
Letter, the whole University applied unto him, as himself did too) you may
readily guess both at his Popish Innovations and practices in the University
of Oxf. in those days, which he has continued ever since. After this we find
him taking special notice of Dr. Prideaux his questions against the Arminiaus,
found in his Study thus endorsed with his own hand. An. 1617. Questions given

These questione, it seems did much displease him, as crossing his Jesuiticall
design of propagating Arminianisme.

Besides, we find in his own Diary these Passages under his own hand in
pursuance of this design, Dec. 23. 1624. The same day I delivered my L. Duke
of Bucking a little tract ABOUT DOCTRINALL PVRJTANISME, in some ten Heads,
which his Grace had spoken to me that I would draw for him, that he might be
acquainted with them; in which he branded the Anti-Arminian Tenets, for
Doctrinall Puritanisme, that so the Arminian might be embraced, as Orthodox.

Immediately after King James his death (a bitter Eenemy to the Arminians, whom
he branded with the titles of Declaration against Vorstins.
Atheistical Sectaries, and pestilent Heriticks, who dare take upon them that
Licentious Liberty, to fetch again from Hell the ancient Heresies long since
condemned, or else to invent new of their own brain, contrary to the belief
of the true Catholic Church, Bishop Laud to engage the King and Duke against
the Anti-Arminians, under the title of Putitans, and ingratiate the Arminians
in their favor under the Title of Orkthodox Divines, presented the Duke with a
Catalogne of the names of Clergy men, who were Orthodox, (to wit Arminians,)
and who Putitans, which he thus expresses in his Diary.

April 5. 1625. Die Martis, Schedulam exhibui Duci Buckinghamiae, in qua
Nomina er ant omnium Ecclesiasticorum sub literis O. and P. (that is Orthodox
and Puritans.) Nomina ut sic digererem, jussit ipse Dux Buckinghamiae,
traditurus ea (ut dixit) Regi Carolo.

Within four days after, the Duke of Buckingham sent this Prelate to Bishop
Andrews to consult about the 5. Arminian Articles condemned in the Synod of
Dort, to promote, and propagate them in our Church, and to return his Answer
to him, as is clear by these Passages in his Diary, written with his own hand.

April 9. 1625. Eodem die in mandatis accepiut Rever. Episc. Winton: adirem,
and quid velit in causa Ecclesiae sciscitarem: Responsum referem: PRAECIPVE IN
5. ARTICVLIS, etc. April 10. die Solis, post concionem finitam adij Episcopum,
que tum Camera sua in Aula Regia erat; protuli qua accipi in mandatis;
responsum dedit April 13. die Mercurij. Retuli ad Ducem Buck quid responderit
Episcopus Winton.

These Bishops of the Arminian and Popish party, after serious consultation
among themselves, concluded, that for the better introducing, advancing of the
Arminian and Popish Errors in our Church, Richard Mountague then Bachelor of
Divinity, having the Repute of a great Scholar (being formerly engaged in this
Quarrel by the complaints of Mr. Ward, and Mr. Yates against him for the
Arminian and Popish Tenets broached in his Gagge,) should in a new Book of his,
entitled Appello Caesarem (compiled by all their consents, as appeared by
their subscriptions to it, which they afterward cunningly withdrew when they
had procured, Dr. Francis Whites approbation of it leaving him in the sudds
alone) as he often complained, publicly broach, justify, maintain all the
Arminian Tenets condemned in the Synod of Dort, as the received Doctrines of
the Church of England, and impair the Reputation of that Synods
determinations, as the private opinions only of some few illiterate Puritans.
This book of his was disallowed by Dr. Abbot then Archbishop of Canterbury and
his Chaplines, who stopped it at the Press: but the now Archbishop by his own
and the Dukes power, procured it notwithstanding, to be printed, and dedicated
to his Majesty in the very beginning of his Reign, thereby to engage him in
the Actual Patronage of the Arminian Points, and party, which Mountague
impetrated at his hands in his Epistle Dedicatory.

This Book giving great and just offense to most men, Dr. Prideaux soon after
upon a fit occasion, spoke somewhat against it in the Schools at Oxford;
admonishing young Scholars, to be cautelous in reading it: of which there was
present notice sent to the Prisoner (then Bishop of St. David's) by way of
complaint, as these two letters (found in his Study by Mr. Prynne) most clearly
manifest.

My very good Lord.
I Received your Letter, The Copy of the consecration of the Chapel shall be
sent, according to your Lordships appointment. We had Disputations in Divinity
Schools Wednesday: one Mr. Damport, a great Preacher in London, but no
Graduat, was Respondent. One of his Questions, this,

His Opponent (one Mr. Palmer of Lincoln College:) urged, out of Mr. Mountague
his Appeal, the Article of our Church, The Homilies; The Book of
Common Prayer. The Doctor of the Chair handled the Appellator (so they termed
Him) very coursly: putting it upon Him, that he is Merus Grammaticus; a Fellow
that studies Phrases, more then matter: That He understands neither the
Articles nor Homilies; or, at least, perverts NOTE.

So (quoth He) He attributes I know not what virtue to the external sign of the
Cross, Dignus cruce, qui asserat. He concluded with an admonition to the
Juniors (whereof there come good store to that Exercise, and well furnished
with Tablebookes, and to the Seniors too; That they would be cautelous in

your Lordship.




My very good Lord,
WHat I wrote to your Lordship concerning Mr. Mountague, I have it by me; and
before I sent it, I consulted with my Cosen Walker, who was present at the
Exercise as well as I; and we both agree, that I wrote nothing but what is true
in the substance; the very Terms we cannot recall. For my part, as I desire
not to be produced, so I am not afraid of it, if it might do: Mr. Mountague any
pleasure. Doctor Radcliffe was present NOTE.
at the Disputations, what other Doctors there were I know not. Thus wishing
your health and happiness, I humbly take my leave, and remain.

Your Lordships in all dutiful obligement Thomas Turner.
St. Io. Oxon. May 30. 1625.

This last letter intimates an intention to question Dr. Prideaux for these
Passages; but the Parliament following soon after, this Book was publikly
complained of in the Commons House, and Mountague himself there questioned for
it, of which this Archbishop took special notice, and thereupon gave all in
couragment and protection he could to Mountagu, as his own Diary manifests in
these following clauses, Iulij. 7. 1625. Die Iovis R. Mount. inductus est in
Domu^ Parliament inferiorem, etc. Iulij 9. Die Saturni, placuit Serenissimo
Regi CAROLO, intimare domui illi, SIBI NON PLACERE que de Montacutio, dicta ibi
vel statuta fuere Se inconsulto, Iulij 13. Iter mihi eo facienti obviam casu
factus est R Montacutius; PRIMVS FVI qui cum certiorem fecide REGIS ERGA IPSVM
GRATIA, etc. NOTE.
A pregnant evidence under his own hand. First that himself was a principal
Patriot of Mountague and his Book. 2. That he was the first that acquainted
him of the Kings Royal favor toward him, for writing this Book,
notwithstanding the complaints against it in the Parliament, if not a procurer
of the King to intimate his dislike to the Commons House of their proceedings
against him; which being discontinued by the dissolution of that Parliament at
Oxford; were again revived in the next Parliament; at which time the Bishop
procured the Duke to sound his Majesty's opinion concerning Mountagues Cause
and Book; which to please the Parliament the King then seemed willing to leave
to their censure, whereat the Bishop was very much troubled, as this Passage in
his Diary manifests.

January 29. 1625. Dies solis erat, intellexi quid D. Buck: collegit de Causa,
Libro and opinionibus, Rich. Montacutij R. C. (King Charles) apud se
statuisset. Videor videre nubem surgentem and minantem Ecclesia Anglicana.
Dissipet pro Misericordia NOTE.
sua Deus.

Soon after there were two Conferences held at York house, before the Duke, and
diverse Nobles about Mountagues Books and opinions, which were there oposed, by
Dr. Preston, and Bishop Morton, but defended by Doctor White, and Bishop Laud,
who records this memorial of these Conferences in his Diary, Feb. 11. 1625 Die
Sabbati ad instantiam Comitis Warwicensis Colloquium fuit in causa R.
Mountacutij in adibus Ducis Buckinghamia, etc. Febr. 17. Die Veueris,
Colloquium praedictum secundum habitum est, non paucis e Proceribus Regni
praesentibus, loco pradicto.

On the 18. of April 1626. Mr. Pyne made a Report in the Commons House from
the Commitee of Religion concerning Mountagues Appeal, and his Arminian and
Popish Tenants therein comprised: whereupon it was voted in the House.

1. That he had disturbed the Peace of the Church by publishing Doctrine,
contrary to the Articles of the Church of England, and the Book of Homilies.

2. That there are diverse Passages in his Book (especially against those he
terms Puritans,) apt to move sedition betwixt the King and his Subjects, and
between Subject and Subject.

3. That the whole frame and scope of his Book is, to discourage the
wellaffected in Religion NOTE.
from the true Religion Established in the Church, and to incline them, and as
much as in him lay TO RECONCILE THEM TO POPERY.

This Report was no sooner made, but this Bishop (Mountagues great Patron who
engaged him in this Popish service) had a Copy thereof, and of all other
proceedings therein delivered to him, which he endorsed with his own hand: but
the Parliament being soon after disolved, Mountague instead of a severe
censure for the Arminian Popish Assertions in his book was punished with the
Bishopric of Chichester, to which he was advanced by this Prelates means, to
affront the Parliament and his Predecessor Bishop Carleton, who answered
Mountagues Book in print, during the Parl. which book was then likewise
answered by Francis Rouse Esquier in a Book called King James his Religion; No
sooner was the Parliament ended, but both these Books were suppressed by this
Bishops means, though recommended to the Press by the House of Commons order,
and Mountagues offensive Book publikly sold without restraint. Michaell Spark
the Elder deposed, that Bishop Carlton sent for him, sitting the Parliament,
and desired him to print his Book against Mountague; and to encourage him the
more, granted him a protection under his own hand; whereupon he printed it:
After which Doctor Goad, Archbishop Abbots Chapline, Doctor Ward, and Dr.
Belcankwell licenced it for the Press, with a special recommendation,
whereupon he reprinted it: yet notwithstanding immediately after the Parliament
ended, by Bishop Lauds means, this Licensed book was called in, seized on,
and burned in private, and he questioned in the High Commission for printing
it. After which this Book of Mountagues, and his Arminian Popish Tenants were
severally answered by Dr. Featley and Doctor Goad (Chaplines to Archbishop
Abbot) in their Paralells; by Mr. Henry Burton in his Plea, by M. Ward, Mr.
Yates and Master Wotton, in several Tracts by Master Prynne in his Perpetuity,
and by Doctor Sutclife; But these Books of theirs, though licenced by
Archbishop Abbots Chaplines, were called in and suppressed by this Bishops
mere Arbitrary Power, and the Authors, Printers, sellers of most of them,
brought into the High Commission (as Mr. Prynne, Mr. Burton, Mr. Sparks, Mr.
Jones, Mr. Bowler Mr. Bourn, with others, as was attested by the three first of
them upon Oath, and manifested by the Articles in the High Commission;) yet
these their authorized orthodox books were all seized on, and some of them
burnt in private, and Dr. Sutcliffes Book against Mountague suppressed in the
Press, when four sheets thereof were printed, which printed sheets Mr. Prynne
found in this Archbishops Study, with this endorsment under his own hand, read
at the Lords Bar, The beginning of Dr. Sutcliffes Censure upon Mr. Mountagues
Appeal: It was prohibited in the Press.

Here upon the Arminian party both in Court, our Universities, and else where,
grew very great bold, insolent, and their opinions spread themselves like a
dangerous Leprosy, over the whole body of our Church, to the grand exultation
and advantage of the Jesuits, who first planted this sovereign drugge of
Arminianisme among us, to reduce us back to Rome, as appears by these
Passages in a See a necessary Introduction to the Archbishops trial, p. 89. 90.
Jesuits letter sent to the Rector at Bruxels, a little before the Parliament
which begun at Westminster the 17. of Mar. 1627. The Copy of which Letter,
endorsed with the Archbishops own hand, was seized on in his Study at Lambheth,
and attested before the Lords by M. Prynne.

Father Rector, etc. We have now many strings to our Bow, and have strongly
fortified our faction; and have added two Bulworkes more; For when King James
lived (we know) he was very violent against Arminianisme; and interrupted with
his Pestilent wit, and deep learning our strong designs in Holland, etc. NOW
WE HAVE PLANTED THE SOVEREIGN DRVGGE ARMINIANISME, which we hope will Note.
purge the Protestants from their Heresy: and it flourishes and bears fruit
in due season, etc. For the better prevention of the Puritans, the Arminians
have already locked up the Dukes ears, and we have those of our Religion which
stand continually at the Dukes Chamber to see who goes in and out. We cannot be
too circumspect and careful in this regard. I cannot choose but laugh to see
how some of our own rank have encountered themselves; you would scarce know them
if you saw them; and it is admirable, how in speech and gesture they Act the
Puritans. The Cambridge Scholars to their woeful experience shall see we can
act the Puritan a little better then they have don the Jesuits, I am at this
time transported with joy to see how happily all instruments and means as well
great a lesser, cooperate unto our purposes, But to return unto the maine
Fabric, OUR FOUNDATION IS ARMINIANISME: The Arminians affect mutation, this
we second and enforce by probable arguments, etc.

From which Letter was observed; NOTE.


1. That the Jesuits were the Original planters of Arminianisme among us:

2. That they reputed it the foundation of their Romish Fabric intended to
be here erected among Us: the chief instrument to effect their Jesuiticall
purpose, and to purge out the Protestant Religion.

3. That the Arminians were but the Jesuits Agents to promote their ends, and
that both of them were very intimate with the Duke of Buckingham, at whose
lodgings they usually met.

4. That this Archbishop knew all this, he receiving the Copy of this Letter
upon the 27. of Mar. 1628. as appears by his own endorsment of it; yet
notwithstanding he promoted Arminians and propagated Arminianisme all he
could; but in a most cunning Jesuiticall way: for perceiving the whole
Parliament generally bent against Arminianisme and Mountagues Book, hereupon
this Jesuiticall Prelate abusing both the Parliament and His Majesty, to set up
Arminianisme more securely projected a new way of advancing it, under a
specious pretense of silencing both sides: by which policy he inhibited all
writing, preaching and disputes against it, and quelled the opposite
Anti-Arminian party. To which end he procured His Majesty by a printed
Declaration prefixed to the 39. Articles, compiled by himself and other
Bishops, of which the most part were Arminians (pretended principally to
suppress Arminianisme, but intended really for advancing it) to prohibit all
unnecessarie disputations, altercations, or questions to be raised, which might
nourish faction both in Church and Commonwealth. That in these both curious
and unhappy differences, which had for so many hundred years, in different
times and places, exercised the Church of Christ, all further curious search
should be laid aside, and these disputes shut up in Gods promises, as they be
generally set forth to Us, in the holy Scriptures, and the General meaning of
the Articles of the Church of England according to them. And that no man
hereafter shall either print or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but
shall submit to it in the plain and full meaning thereof: and shall not put
his own sense or Comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it
in the litterall and Grammatical sense: That if any public Reader in either
our Universities, or any Head or Master of a College, or any other person
respectively in either of them, shall affix any new sense to any Article, or
shall publicly read, determine, or hold any public disputation, or suffer any
such to be held EITHER WAY, in either the Universities or Colleges
respectively: or if any Divine in the NOTE.
Universities shall preach or print any thing EITHER WAY, other then is already
established in Convocation with our Royal Assent; He, or they the Offenders,
shall be liable to Our displeasure, and the Churches censure in our Commission
Ecclesiastical, as well as any other; and We will see there shall be due
execution upon them, etc.

That this Declaration was made by this Bishops instigation, procurement, and
so generally reputed not only at home but abroad, is evident by this passage of
Doctor Barons Letter of Aberdean; concerning the pacifying of the 5. Articles,
sent to this Archbishop, and found in his Study endorsed with his own hand,
dated the 20. of April 1634. Piam hanc Ampl: tuae de Pace Ecclesiae tuenda and
conservanda, sollicitudinem, illustri specimine JAMPRIDEM NOTAMOMNIBVSET
TESTATAM fecisti, cum Majestas Regia TE AVTHORE ET, SVASORE exitialiisti
dissidio de Praedestinatione and annexis Articulis, quo or bis hic Britannicus
fere collidebatur, sua authoritate finem imposuit, and impetuosas NOTE.
exulceratorum animorum motus ita compescuit, ut dispersis and dissipatis
rixarum indies gliscentium nebulis, nunc optato pacis sudo fruamur. etc.

By color of this Declaration and pretended Amnestie, of silencing both sides
the Anti-Arminian truths and received Doctrines of our Church came to be
totally silenced, suppressed in Press, Pulpit, Schools, Universities, and the
Arminian Errors found free passage in them all without any or very little
opposition; this being the highest conquest the Arminian faction could aspire
to, yea more then they could hope for in so short a space. Hereupon their
prevailing party having greatest power at Court, and in the High Commission,
(Archbishop Abbot being then by their power and policy sequestered from both,
and from his Archiepiscopall authority, delegated to Bishop Land, and others of
the Arminian combination) by color and abuse of this Declaration all Books
against the Arminians were suppressed, the Authors prosecuted in the High
Commission, those who preached or disputed against them in the Universities,
City, Court or Country, silenced, suspended, banished, imprisoned enforced to
recant or ruined, at least kept from all preferments: on the contrary those of
the Arminian confederacy were advanced, applauded, countenanced, protected, and
freely tolerated to vent their Erroneous Tenets every where in Press, Pulpit,
Court, both Universities, without any real convention or suspention, as we
shall prove anon.

And to set on this design with greater advantage to the Arminian party, His
Majesty being pressed to publish a Proclamation for the calling in of Bishop
Mountagues Book, (no less than three years after its publication, upon
sundry complaints made against it in 3. successive Parliaments, after all the
books dispersed, vented and out of all danger of seizure) he so ordered the
matter, that there was no execution of it in regard of the Book, this
Proclamation was so cunningly and partially penned, that Mountagues Popish and
Arminians opinions were no ways censured, nor his Books condemned to the fire
by it (for fear of hindering the project then in hand) so that all intelligent
men might at first view discern the main end of it, was not to suppress and
call in the Book, or discredit the Author (who was then advanced to a
Bishopric for his pains by Lauds recommendations) but merely to suppress
all Books in answer of it, and silence all preaching, writing, disputes
against the Arminian Errors, as unnecessary questions, and needless
controversies; which appears by the Proclamation it self, thus endorsed with
the Archbishops own hand (who had the penning or correcting of it) Janu. 17.
1628. A Proclamation for calling in Bishop Mountagues Book.

A Proclamation, for the suppressing of a Book, INTITVLED, Appello Caesarem,
or, An Appeal to Caesar.
WHereas We, out of Our care to conserve and maintain the Church, committed
to Our Charge, in the unity of true Religion and the bond of Peace and not to
suffer unnecessary disputes, which may trouble the quiet both of Church and
State, have lately caused the Articles of Religion to be reprinted, as a rule
for avoiding of diversities of opinion and for the establishing of consent in
true Religion; We continuing Our desire to compass this wished effect, and
considering that the Book written by Richard Mountague, It was a very sore
punishment, to advance him from a Batche^lor of Divinity to be a Bishop for
Writing so ill a Book.
now Bishop of Chichester, then but Batechelor of Divinity, entitled, (Appello
Caesarem, or, an Appeal to Caesar,) and published in the Year (1625.) was the
first cause of those disputes and differences, which have sithence much
troubled the quiet of the Church; have thought it fitting to take away the
occasion by calling in the said Book: And therefore, We do hereby will and
straightly command all and singular persons whatsoever. who have, or shall have
any of them in their hands or custody, that upon pain of Our high displeasure,
and the consequence thereof, they do deliver the same presently upon this
publication, to the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, or his Chancellor, if it be
out of the Universities; or if it be in either of the two Universities, to the
Chancellor or Vice Chancellor there, whom We straightly command to suppress
the same; hoping thereby, that men will no more trouble themselves with these
unnecessary questions, the first occasion being taken away: But if We shall be
deceived in this Our expectation, and that by reading, preaching, or making
Books, either pro or contra, concerning these differences, men begin a new to
dispute, We shall take NOTE.
such Order with them, and those Books, that they shall with they had never
thought upon these needless Controversies.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, The seventeenth day of January, in the
fourth Year of Our Reign, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
The Commons then Assembled in Parliament discovering both the sinister end and
abuse of this His Majesty's Declaration and Proclamation, in favor of the
Arminians, drew up a notable Declaration to His Majesty concerning the
increase of Popery and spreading of Arminianisme, etc. concerning the latter
whereof, they made this following complaint, wherein they charged this Prelate,
then Bishop of Bath and Wells with favoring Arminians and their opinions:

As our fear concerning Change or Subversion of RELIGION is grounded upon the
daily increase of Papists, the only professed Enemies thereof, for See a
necessary Introduction to the Archbishops Trial, page 90 to 94.
the reasons formerly mentioned; so are the hearts of Your Subjects no less
perplexed, when with sorrow they behold a daily growth and spreading of the
faction of the Arminians, that being, (as Your Majesty well knows) but a
cunning way to bring in Popery and the professors of those opinions, the common
disturbers of the Protestant Churches NOTE.
and Incendiaries of those States wherein they have gotten any head, being
Protestants in show, but Jesuits in Opinion and practice: which caused Your
Royal Father (with so much pious wisdom and ardent zeal) to endeavor the
suppressing of them as well at home as in our Neighboring Countries: and Your
Gracious Majesty inimating his most worthy example, have openly and by your
Proclamations, declared your mislike of those persons and of their opinions;
who notwithstanding are much favored and advanced, not NOTE.
wanting friends even of the Clergy near to Your Majesty, namely Doctor
Neale, Bishop of Winchester, and Doctor Laud Bishop of Bath and Wells, who are
justly suspected to be unsound in their opinions that way; And it being now
generally the way to preferment, and promotion in the Church, many Scholars do
bend their Studies to maintain these Errors; their Books and opinions are
suffered to be printed and published, and on the other side the impressions of
such as are written against them, and in defense of the Orthodox Religion, are
hindered, and prohibited, and (which is a boldness most incredible) NOTE.
this restraint of Orthodox Books is made under color of Your Majesty's
(formerly mentioned) Proclamation, the intent and meaning whereof we know was
quite contrary, etc.

To which Declaration Bishop Laud returned a Peremptory answer in His Majesty's
Name, written and endorsed with his own hand, the Original whereof (attested
by Master Prynne) was read at the LORDS Bar in these following words, so
far as concerned the charge of Arminianisme. See a necessary Introduction to
the Archbishops Trial, page 93 94, 95.


THe next fear is the daily growth and spreading of the Arminian faction,
called, a cunning way to bring in Popery. But We hold this charge as great a
wrong to Our self and Our Government, as the former: For our People must not
be taught by a Parliament Remonstrance, or any other way, that We are so
ignorant of Truth, or so careless of the profession of it, that any opinion,
or faction, or what NOTE.
ever it be called, should thrust it self so far and so fast into Our
Kingdoms, without Our knowledge of it: This is a mere dream of them that
wake, and would make Our Loyal and loving People think, We sleep the while.
In this charge there is great wrong done to two eminent Prelates, that attend
Our Person; for they are accused without producing any the least show or
shadow of proof against them; and should they or any other attempt Innovation
of Religion, either by that open or any cunning way, we should quickly take
other order with them, and not stay for Your Remonstrance.

To help on this, Our People are made believe there is a restraint of Books,
Orthodoxall. But we are sure since the late Parliament began, some whom the
Remonstrance calls Orthodox, have assumed to themselves an unsufferable liberty
in printing. Our Proclamation commanded a restraint on both sides, till the
passions NOTE.
of men might subside and calm, and had this been obeyed as it ought, we had
not now been tossed in this tempest, As for any distressing or discountenancing
of good Preachers, We know there is none, if they be, as they are called good:
But Our good people shall never want that spiritual comfort which is due unto
them, And for the preferments which We bestow, We have ever made it our
great care to give them as rewards of desert and pains: but as the preferments
are ours so will we be Judge of the desert our self, and not be taught by a
Remonstrance.

After which the Commons in pursuance of their Opposition against the growing
Arminian Faction, On the 28. of January 1628. (but 11. days after the
forementioned Proclamation concerning Mountagues Book, and prohibiting books
against it) passed this notable Vote in Parliament after a large debate; which
the Archbishop in his indorsment on it styles; The Challenge of the lower House
in matters of Religion.

An Order made by the lower House of PARLIAMENT the 28th. of IANVARY 1628.
WE the Commons now Assembled in Parliament do claim, profess and avow for
Truth, the sense of the Articles of Religion, which were established NOTE.
in Parliament the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, which by the public
Acts of the Church of England, and the general and current exposition of the
Writers of our Church have been delivered unto Us; and we reject the sense of
the Jesuits, Arminians, and all others wherein they do differ from Us.

To which Challenge of theirs this pragmaticall Bishop then returned this bold
peremptory answer, written with his own hand, produced, attested by Master
Pryn, and read at the Lords Bar in Evidence against him.

1. The public Acts of the Church in matters of Doctrine are Canons and Acts
of Counsels, as well for expounding as determining; the Acts of the High
Commission are not in this sense public Acts of the Church not the meeting of
few or more Bishops Extra Concilium, unless they be by lawful Authority
called to that work, and their decision approved by the Church.

2. The Current exposition of writers is a strong probable Argument de sensu
Can^nis Ecclesiae, vel Articuli, yet but probable: The Current exposition of
the Fathers themselves has sometimes missed sensum Ecclesiae.

3. Will ye reject all sense of lesuit, or Arminian? may not some be true? may
not some be agreeable to our writers, and yet in a way that is stronger then
ours to NOTE.
confirm the Article?

4. Is there by this Act any Interpretation made or declared of the Articles,
or not? If none, to what end the Act? If a sense or Interpretation be declared,
what authority have laymen to make it? for Interpretation of an Article
belongs to NOTE.
them only that have power to make it.

5. It Is manifest there is a sense declared by the House of Commons, the Act
says it, (we avow the Article, and in that sense, and all other that agree
not with us in the aforesaid sense, we reject; (these and these, go about
misinterpretation of a sense, Ergo there is a Declaration of a sense, yea: but
it is not a new sense declared by them, but they avow the old sense declared by
the Church.) The public authenticke Acts of the Church, etc. yea; but if there
be no such public authenticke Acts of the Church, then here is a sense of their
own declared under pretense of it.

6. It seems against the Kings Declaration, 1. That says, we shall take the
general NOTE.
meaning of the Articles; this Act restraines them to consent of VVrighters. 2.
That says, the Article shall not be drawn aside any way, but that we shall
take it in the Litterall and Gramaticall sense: This Act ties to consent of
VVrighters, which may; and perhaps do go against the Litterall sense; for
here is no exception; so we shall be perplexed and our consent required to
things contrary.

7. All consent in all Ages, as far as I have observed, to an Article or
Canon, is to it self, as it is laid down in the body of it, and if it bear
more senses then one, it is lawful for any man to choose what sense his
judgment directs him to, so that it be a sense, secundum analogiam fidei, and
that he hold it peaceably without distracting the Church, and this till the
Church which made the Article determine a sense: And the wisdom of the Church
has been in all ages or the most, to require consent to Articles in general
as much as may be, because that's the way of unity, and the Church in high
points requiring assent to particulars, has been rent, As de
Transubstantiatione, etc. So he, in affront of the Commons.

This Parliament also being soon after broken up in discontent by this Bishops
power and policy, the Arminian and Popish party grew more bold numerous,
potent, and prevalent every where, so as the Pulpits at Whice-hall, Paul's
Cross, Oxford, Cambridge, and else where, ecchoed again with Arminian
Paradoxes, without restraint, and none could or durst oppose them without
exemplary punishment, if not all most certain ruin: Books in defense of
Arminianisme, and Semi-plagianisme were published, printed with public
allowance, and all impressions against them most diligently suppressed; the
Recantations of Arminian Tenets in former times made in our Universities, were
embesled as Barrets Recantation in Cambridge, May 10. 1595.) and new
Recantations enjoined to and registered against their opposites, of all which we
shall produce some remarkable instances.

The Ministers in and about London, being restrained by Color of His Majesty's
forementioned Declaration and Proclamation, to Preach any thing concerning
Election, Predestination, Perserverance, or any thing opposite to the Arminian
Errors thereupon framed this ensuing Petition to his Majesty (about the end of
the Parliament, 1628.) for liberty to Preach against the Arminian errors in
point of Predestination etc. which this Bishop being informed off, anticipated,
and frustrated, two of the Copies, of which Petition were found in his Study by
Mr. Pryn, thus endorsed with his own hand. The Copy of the intended Petition
about liberty of Preaching Predestination, etc.

To the Kings most Excellent Majesty, The humble Petition of diverse Ministers
of Gods Word, in and about the City of London, and else where.
Most Humbly shows,
THat whereas your royal Majesty out of your Religious zeal for the
conserving of the Church committed to your Charge in Peace, and for the
confirming of the Doctrine of the same agreeable to Gods word, and contained in
the Articles established; did publish both a Proclamation, and a Declaration,
therein prohibiting all opinions either against or besides the Orthodoxall
grounds of Religion expressed in the said Articles, as also all raising of
doubts and disputatios which may nourish faction in Church and Common wealth.
And yet your Majesty's said edicts are so interpreted, and pressed upon us, as
we are not a little discouraged and deterred, from preaching those saving
Doctrines of Gods free Grace in Election, and predestination which greatly
confirm our faith of eternal salvation, and fervently kindle our Love to God,
as the 17th. Article expressly mentions. So as we are brought into a great
strayt either of incurring Gods heavy displeasure if we do not faithfully
discharge our Embassage, in declaring the whole Council of God, or the danger
of being censured for violators of your Majesty's said Acts, if we preach these
constant Doctrines of our Church, and confute the opposite Pelagian and
Arminian Heresies, both preached and printed boldly without fear of Censure.
As if the saving Doctrines of Christ were prohibited, and these impious
Heresies privileged, which Counsels both old and new have condemned, and the
admired NOTE.
judgment of our late Sovereign your Royal Father K. James, of blessed
memory, has for ever branded, calling the maintainers thereof, Arrogant and
Atheistical Sectaries, who are not ashamed to lie so grossly, as to avow that
their Heresies are agreeable with the Religion, and profession of the Church of
England, which corrupt seeds of Heresy and Faction, (if not the more speedily
rooted out) the wise King tell's the neighbor States, will of necessity bring
utter ruin to their state by the too bold, and frequent Disciples, and
followers of that enemy of God, Arminius.

We therefore your Majesty's faithful, obedient, peaceable and conformable
Subjects to all your Majesty's Laws, being most tenderly sensible of the
dishonor of Christ, and of your Majesty his Vicegerent over us, infinitely
more dear unto us then our lives, most humbly on our bended knees, beseech
your Gracious Majesty to take into your Princely consideration the forenamed
Evils and Greivances under which we groan; and as a wise Physician to
prescribe and apply such speedy Remedies, as may both care the present
Maladies, and secure the Peace of Church and Commonwealth, from all those
Plagues which our neighbors have not a little felt, and more may fear if the
Council of the most juditious King be not the bettter followed.

And according to our bounden duty we shall daily pray for the continuance of
your Majesty's peaceable, prosperous, and religious Reign over us.

About March: 1628. Dr. Hall then Bishop of Exceter published a Book called
the Reconciler, in the close whereof, he inserted two Letters, to vindicate
himself from the imputation of Arminianisme, wherewith some had then aspersed
him; to wit, his own letter to Dr. Davenant, then Bishop of Salisbury, and
his Answer thereunto; which Letters coming to be licenced, Doctor Thomas
Turner the Bishops Chaplain, who authorized it (no doubt by the Bishops
directions and command) expunged, these two Passages out of the Letters,
against the Arminian Tenets, and in approbation of the Synod of Dort.
containing the principle Subject matter of the Letters, and the end for which
they were written, the Copy of which Purgations was seized in the Archbishops
Study by Mr. Prynne who attested it, thus endorsed with his own hand. That
which my Chapline Mr. Turner left out of the letters of the Bishop of Exceter,
and Sarum ABOUT ARMINIANISME.

In my Lord Bishop of EXONS Letter, to the Lord Bishop os SARVM, there was this
Passage oblitcrated.
YEA, as if this calumny were not enough, there want not those whose secret
whisperings cast upon me the foul aspertions of an other Sect, whose name is
as much hated, as little understood: My Lord, you know I had a place with you,
though unworthy) in that famous Synod of Dort, where (however sickness
^ereaved me) of the honor of a conclusive subscription) yet your Lordship
heard me with equal vehemence to the rest, crying down the unreasonablenesse
of that way. I am still the same man, and shall live and die in the suffrage of
that Reverend Synod, and do confidently a vow; that those other opposed
opinions cannot stand with the Doctrine NOTE.
of the Church of England. But if for the composing of our differences at home
(which your Lordship knows to be far different from the Netherlandish) there
could have been tendered any such fair propositons of accordance, as might be
no prejudice to Gods Truth, I should have thought it an holy and happy project;
wherein if it be not a fault to have wished a safe peace, I am innocent.

In my Lord Bishops of SARVMS Answer. Dated January 30. 1628.
This passage was expunged.

AS for the aspertions of Arminianisme, I can testify, that in our joint
employment at the Synod of Dort, you were as far from it, as my self. And I
know that no man can embrace it, in the Doctrine of Pradestination and Grace,
but he must first NOTE
desert the Articles agreed upon by the Church of England: nor in the Point of
Perseverance, but he must vary from the common Tenet, and received opinion of
our best approved Doctors in the English Church. I am assured, that you neither
have deserted the one, nor will vary from the other; and therefore be no more
troubled with other men's groundless suspirions then you would be in like case
with their idle Dreams. Thus I have, etc.

Nathaniell Butter, the Stationer, perceiving these two letters not only
extremely mutilated, but made altogether useless, and his Book less vendible
by these Purgations of the Licencer, adventured to print these expunged
passages in them, whereupon he was apprehended and brought before Bishop Laud
by a Pursevant, committed Prisoner by him to the Fleet, without Bail or
maineprize, contrary to the Petition of Right, though he tendered bail, his
Books seized, and afterward Articled against in the High Commission, and
there almost ruined, only for printing those deleted Passages in two of our
own Bishops Letters; as was proved by the Testimony of Master Henry Burton and
Michaell Sparks senior, committed to the Fleet by the Bishop at the same time;
by the Warrant of his commitment, under the Bishops own hand, the Articles in
the High Commission against Butter, Artic. 4. 5. and his Answer thereunto,
produced in Court.

About the same time Nathaniell Carpenter Chapline to Archbishop Usher,
published a Book entitled Achitophel, or the Picture of a wicked Politician.
printed at Oxford by License, wherein were diverse passages against
Arminianisme, averring it to be planted among us by Jesuitical Politicians to
undermine our Religion by degrees, and covertly to introduce Popery it self:
which Book was presently called in, and all the Passages against Arminianisme
expunged by this Bishops Agents, which done, it was reprinted at London without
them, Anno 1629. to the great injury both of the truth and Author: as was
attested by Mr. Prynne, and Michaell Spark Senior and evident to all who will
compare these two Editions. What other passages against the Arminians and their
Tenet have been expunged in other Authors; shall be given in evidence
elsewhere.

We shall next produce some memorable Instances what countenance was given to
Arminian Books and Sermons, notwithstanding his Majesty's Declarations and
Proclamations to the contrary, by this Archbishops means. Doctor Thomas
Jackson, Chapline in Ordinary to his Majesty, even sitting the Parliament,
soon after the Kings Declaration and Proclamation, published, A Treatise of
divine Essence, and Attributes: part first, printed at London, 1628. for John
Clerk Licensed by this Prelates Chaplain, dedicated to the Right honorable
William Earl of Pembrooke in the very Epistle Dedicatory, to this Noble Peer,
he professes himself AN ARMINIAN, and Patron of their Tenets: And Chap. 8.
to 20. he professedly maintains: A mutability in Gods eternal Decrees of
Election and Reprobation, depending upon the actions, and wills of men;
Universal Grace and Redemption; with other Arminian Errors. This Book though
publicly complained of, was never called in by the Bishop; but the second part
thereof printed by License, An. 1629. and the Author of it advanced to the
Presidentship of Corpus Christi College in Oxford, by this Bishop, yea by him
designed to be Doctor of the Chair (though he missed that preferment) to
poison the University of OXFORD with his Arminian Drugges.

An. 1630. Doctor Brooks of Trinity College in Cambridge Writ an Arminian
Treatise of Predestination, with which he acquainted Bishop Laud, who
encouraged him in the work, recommending it to the perusal of Doctor Lindsey,
and Doctor Beale (two great Arminians,) promising to peruse it himself, as
appears by sundry Letters. Whereupon Doctor Brooks returned this answer to
him concerning it, in Answer of this Bishops Letter to him, seized in his Study
by Mr. Prynne; dated from Cambridge, Dece. 15. 1630. wherein there is this
desperate passage worthy Observation.

MY LORD, etc.
I Dare say: That their doctrine of Predestination is the root of Paritanisme,
and Puritanisme the root of all rebellions and disobedient intractablenesse in
Parliament, NOTE.
etc and of all Schism and Sauciness in the Country, nay in the Church it
self: this has made many thousands of our people, and to great a part of the
Gentlemen of the Land Laytons in their hearts. Besides, where nothing is done
the weeds will over-grow the Corn, as they do. For last Parliament they left
their word, Religion, and the cause of Religion, and began to use the name of
Church, and our Articles of the Church of England, etc. and wounded our Church
at the very heart, with her own name, And by pretense of putting down
Arminianisme and defense of that Church, against which indeed they took up
Arms: so that now they that hold the very opinions of Penry and W^gington, of
Hacket and Coppinger in their beginning and others, of whom some were hanged,
most imprisoned, many deprived, and some censured in the Star Chamber for
seditious persons, and Enemies to the Church of England, they, I say that hold
the same opinions, cry out now the Church of England, and will have the Church
of England to be theirs. I could justify this and much more, but your Lordship
knows these things to be so better then I, etc.


What gross aspersions he here casts upon the Parliament and Anti-Arminians is
so apparent, as needs no explanatory or aggravating Commentary.

On the 27. of Novem. 1630. Doctor Martin this Bishops household Chaplain, a
professed Arminian, licensed a Book for the Press, entitled, An Historical
Narration of the judgment of some must learned and Godly English Bishops, holy
Martyrs and others, concerning Gods Election, and the Merits of Christ's death;
set forth by I. A. of Ailward (a late Seminary Priest) and printed for Samuel
Nealand, 1631. The whole scope of this Book was to prove, the Martyrs and first
Reformers of our Church in K. Ed. the 6. and Q. Mary's days, and the beginning
of Q. Elizabeth's Reign, to be Arminians, and Arminianisme the established
Doctrine of our Church: The first 66 pages of this Book, contain, The Copy
of an Answer unto a certain Letter; wherein the Answerer purges himself and
others from Pelagius Errors, and from the Error of Free Will, or Justification
of Works, wherewith he seemed to be charged by the said Letter. And further,
he shows wherein he differs in judgment from certain English Writers and
Preachers whom he charge with teaching false doctrine, under the name of
Predestination. This Treatise, writes he, was published about the second or
third year of Queen Elizabeth, by a Protestant Divine, who flourished both in
the time of King Edward, and Queen Elizabeth, and in the time of Queen Mary
for his Conscience endured voluntary exil; but he names not the Author in
particular, nor produces any warrant for this Encomium of him: The residue of
the Book are some mistaken and perverted fragments called out of Bishop
Hoopers Preface upon the Commandments; and Father Latymers Sermons; concerning
which Book Master Prynne gave in this evidence upon his Oath; That it was the
greatest affront and imposture ever offered to, or put upon the Church of
England in any age, deserving the highest Censure; of the first discovery
whereof God made him the only Instrument: For as soon as this Book was
printed, one Copy of it was brought him by a Friend; who informed him, that it
was licensed by Master Martin. the Bishops Arminian Chaplain; that the Bishop
himself had given order, the Book should not be published, till he had
presented one of them to the King, and gained his Royal approbation thereunto:
That a day or two after the Book was published by the Bishops direction; One
Copy whereof coming to the late learned Sir Humfrey Linds hands, he was very
much troubled thereat upon its perusal; whereupon he repaired to Master
Prynne at Lincolnes-Iaue with the Book; desiring him to take some pains to
give a speedy answer to it, being (as he averred) a most dangerous Book, making
more for the spreading and justifying of Arminianisme, then any Book formerly
published. To which Master Prynne replied, that he had no leisure, and less
encouragement to answer it, being then and just before vexed in the High
Commission for his Perpetuity, and other of his Books written against
Arminians; Wherefore Sir Humfrey himself who had more leisure, friends and
abilities then himself might do well to return an answer to it. Who
thereupon replied to Master Prynne, that none was so fit to answer it as
himself, who had perused more ancient English Writers, and was better versed
in them then any man he knew; Whereunto Master Prynne rejoyned, That he
conceaved there was no need at all for himself or any man else to answer this
book, for that there were two answers to it already in print; To which Sir
Humfrey replied, it was impossible, for that this Book came forth but that
morning; unto which Mr. Pryn answered, that the greatest part and maine
substance of this Narration was answered Verbatim in two printed Books, long
before either of them was born, and to give him fall satisfaction therein, he
showed him two printed answers thereunto, and discovered the whole Imposture to
him in that manner as he related it at the Lords Bar.

First he produced to him, and now to the Lords, the Original printed Copy of
the foresaid answer, made unto a certain Letter, etc. which had all the
symptoms of an unlicensed Pamphlet; there being neither Authors, nor Printers
name, nor place where, nor year when it was printed to be found in the Title,
or any other part of the Book, nor the least mention where, or by whom it was
to be sold. Therefore it was doubtless printed by stealth in a Corner, and not
by any public allowance, its entry not being extant in the Stationers' Hall.
Next he produced two ancient answers in print to this pernicious Pamphlet: The
first of them written by John Veron, a very learned man, Chaplain to Queen
Elizabeth, and Divinity Lecturer in the Cathedral of Paul's in the beginning of
her Reign, to whom he Dedicated his answer to this Pamphlet, Imprinted at
London by John Tysdale by public authority. In which answer, (entitled. An
Apology or Defense of the Doctrine of Predestination, set fort by the Queens
Highness her most humble and obedient servant John Veron, and Dedicated to her
Majesty,) we have the name of the namelesse Author of this Arminian Pamphlet,
the occasion of compiling it, and the quality of the Author, expressed to the
full, together with a complete answer thereunto. The Authors name is therein
averred to be one Champeneyes, f. 20. 31. 37. 40. 41. 42. His condition and
quality is therein thus expressed, f. 16. But in this I comfort my self, that
his tongue is known to be no slander, For the like did he most proudly attempt
in your most Gracious Brother good King Edward the sixths days, AGAINST ALL
THE GODLY PREACHERS OF THAT TIME calling them marked Monsters of Antichrist,
NOTE.
and men void of the Spirit of God, (for none be they never so Godly, never so
earnest and faithful laborers in the Lords Vineyard, have the Spirit of God,
or do know the efficacy of it, but he only) as many godly persons be able to
testify to his face: that he did therefore, and for MANT OTHER ABOMINABLE
ERRORS which he then stoutly maintained, BEAR AT THAT TIME A FAGGOT AT PAVLS
CROSS, Father Coverdale making then the Sermon there. Belike fearing now the
like punishment, and that he should be compelled to revoke his Pelagian-like
opinion, he NOTE.
durst not, for all his proud boast, set his own name to his railing and
venomous books, nor yet suffer them to be sold openly or publikly in the
Booke-binders shops, but cowardously suppressing both his own name and the
name of the unwise and foolish Printer, got the whole Impression into his
hands, that so he might in hugger-mugger send them unto his NOTE.
privy friends abroad, whom be like he suspected to be of his Affinity and
damnable opinion. How be it, this could not be wrought so privily, but that
within a while, some of his books came into my hands, whereby shortly after,
the Printer was known and brought to his Answer; whom this stout Champion of
Pelagius has left in the briars, and least he himself should be feign to show
a reason of his Doctrine, does keep himself out of the way still, and dares
not once show his face. If he be able to maintain his Doctrine against my
book to, let him come forth and play the man, I am ready at all times to yield
unto the truth, and unto the sincere teachers thereof.

After this, f. 20. he styles Champenyes; The blind guide of the freewill men:
f. 37. Champenyes a very Pelagian and consequently a rank Papist: p. 40. he
suffers the Devil by such Sectaries as Champenyes is, to sow his lies
abroad, etc. And f. 41. Champenyes is the Standard Bearer of the freewill men.
What an abominable Imposture was it then for this new Pamphleter to style him;
A Protestant Divine who flourished in the time of K. Edward and Q. Elizabeth,
and in the time of Q. Mary for his conscience endured voluntary exile; And to
place him in the front of the most learned and Godly English Bishops, holy
Martyrs and others that suffered Martyrdom in the days of Q. Mary, for the
truth and Gospel of Christ Jesus, in which number he is Registered in the Title
Page, and placed before Bishop Hooper, and Father Latymer in the Book it self,

The occasion of writing this unlicenced obscure Pamphlet, was as follows,
John Veron being Divinity Lecturer in Paul's Cathedral, in the first year of
Queen Elizabeth, handled the Doctrine of Predestination, and other incident
Points thereto belonging in direct opposition the Popish, Pelagian, and now
Arminian Tenets; which Lectures he soon after published in Print, and
dedicated to Q. Elizabeth, in a book entitled, A Fruitful Treatise of
Predestination, etc. Printed at London for JOHN TYLDALE about the second year
of Queen Elizabeth's Reign: against which Lectures, this Champnyes taking some
exceptions, published this Anonimous Answer, by way of a Letter: which Veron
soon after answered, almost verbatim, in his authorized Apology, dedicated to
the Queen, whereto Champeneys never replied. After which, this Letter was
largly answered, word for word, from the very Title page to the end thereof, in
a Book Entitled, An Apology or Defense of the English Writers and Preachers,
with Cerberus the Three-Headed Dog of Hell, charge with false Doctrine,
under the name of Predestination: written by Robert Crowley Clerk,) a fugitive
for Religion in Queen Mary's days and an eminent laborious Preacher in those
times) Vicar of Saint Giles without Criplegate in London: Imprinted at London
in Pater-Noster-Rowe, at the sign of the Star, by Henry Denham, Anno 1566.
October. 14. Seen and allowed according to the order appointed. In which book
this Pamphlet which the Bishop and his Agents now obtrude upon us, as the
received Doctrine of our prime Martyrs and of the Church of England in King
Edward the 6th. and Queen Elizabeth's Reigns, was by public Authority, in
the name of all the Orthodox Writers, and Preachers of England, refuted, as
directly contrary to the received Doctrine of our Martyrs, Writers, Preachers,
Church, and censured as Pelagiau and Popish in both these ancient printed
Answers. It must needs therefore be an inexpiable, insufferable abuse in this
Archbishop and his Instruments, thus to revive, reprint this exploded Erroneous
Arminian Treatise, in the year, 1631 and obtrude it on us as the received
Doctrine of our Martyrs and Church of England in the beginning of Reformation,
whereas there was nothing less, on purpose to propagate his Arminian Errors,
and strengthen that lesuiticall faction. After this Mr. Prynne produced Bishop
Hoopers Confession and Protestation of his faith, made to the whole Parliament,
An. 1550. in King Edwards days. His comfortable Exposition upon the Psalms
(London, 1580.) his Articles upon the Creed, London, 1584. Artic. 3. to 15. 17.
21. 25. 29. 30. 33. 36. 38. to 56 62. 67. 68. 91. to 99. wherein he expressly in
terminis refutes, those Arminian opinions, which this our Author would wrest out
of the words of his Preface to the Commandments, contrary to his intention;
together with diverse Passages in Father Latimers Sermons, expressly against the
Arminian Tenets, which explicate his other misapplyed Clauses in the
Hystoricall Naration, All which Mr. Pryn then showed to Sir Humfry Lynde to his
great satisfaction; and then desired him to repair to Bishop Laud in his name,
to acquaint him with the premises, and this desperate Imposture he had obtruded
on our Church to his eternal Infamy, and thereupon to advise him, speedily to
call in and burn this dangerous seducing book or else he would prosecute him
to the uttermost for this abuse. Sir Humfry accordingly acquainted the Bishop
and his Chaplin Martin herewith, but yet they took no course to suppress the
Book; whereupon Mr Prynne repaired to Lambheth to Archbishop Abbot acquainted
him with the execrablenesse of this imposture, showed him the several old
Answers to this new printed Pamphlet with the express positions of Bishop
Hooper, and Bishop Latymer, contrary to those imputed to them in this
Narration; desiring him to call in this dangerous Historical Narration with
all severity, and to cause it to be publicly burnt, to reprint the old Answers
to it; and withal to give him leave to prosecute Bishop Laud his Chaplain
Martin, with the publisher of this book in the high Commission for this
insufferable abuse. To which Archb. Abbot gave this answer that this book did
very much trouble him, that he had sent to Bishop Laud about it, who at first
denied that his Chaplain licensed it, but afterward acknowledged it; that he
gave order to call it in (but it was in a private manner after most of the
books v^nded) that he never saw nor knew of these 2. old Answers to it, and
therefore desired Mr. Pryn to leave them with him for a time, promising
faithfully to restore them, and to give him an account of this business on the
Saturday following. In the mean time Mr. Prynne (because this book had done
much harm in both the Universities) sent down some of these Answers of Veron,
and Crowly, with some of Bishop Hoopers books to Oxf. and Cambridg to some of
his acquaintance there; and to the University Lybrary at Oxford whither many
resorted to peruse them to their great satisfaction, and the Bishops dishonor,
by discovering this imposture to them. On Saturday being Easter Eve. Master
Prynne repaired to Archbishop Ahbot for an Answer; who told him that he had
called in this offencive book, seized on some of the copies, which were carried
into Stationers' Hall; that Bishop Laud had since been with him, that he had
showed him the books there left, who confessed his Chaplin Martyn had licenced
this Narration in which he had done very ill, but he had given him such a
rattling for his pains, that he would warrant His Grace he should never
meddle with Arminian Books or Opinions more. To which Mr. Prynne replied; that
indeed he had ratled him to very great purpose, for no longer then yesterday in
the afternoon his Chapline Martin Preaching the Passion Sermon at Paul's
Cross, publikly broached, maintained, Universal grace and Redemption, with
all the Arminian Errors contained in this Book, and condemned in the Synol of
Dort to the great offense of the Auditors, as his own Chaplains Dr. Buckner,
Master Austen and Dr. Featley could at large inform him; and therefore the
Bishop did most grossly abuse his Grace herein, who should do well to proceed
against both of them and publikly censure them in the High Commission, or this
gross practice, to the end the whole Kingdom might take notice of it: and the
Arminian party, be thereby discouraged: That the Books they had seized were
but few, the greatest part of the Impression being vented, and they were called
in so slighty and in so private a manner, that few or none took notice thereof:
and therefore some public censure ought to pass upon them, and the Books thus
seized to be openly burnt, else they would in a few months be sold openly
again to corrupt the people, and no satisfaction at all given for this foul
offense to the Church of England; which Archbishop Abbot confessed to be true,
and said, he would take some Order in it: but by this Bishops power there was
nothing more done against the Licenser, Compiler or Book, which soon after
was as publicly sold, as if it had neverbeene called in, to the perverting of
many in their judgments, who knew not of this grand Imposture; now publikly
discovered at the Lords Bar, by all the forementioned books themselves there
produced, and the testimony of Master Prynne upon Oath: seconded by the
Stationers book of entries, and the testimonies of Master Spark, and Master
Walley. Doctor Martin for this good service was presently after by this Bishop
advanced to a great living, and likewise to the headship of Queens College in
Cambridge, instead of other punishment, Master Prynne for his pains, in
derecting this fraudulent dealing of the Bishop and his Chaplain, by way of
revenge was soon after by this Bishops means imprisoned in the Tower, and
most severely censured in the Star Chamber, for his Book called
Histrianastix (though Licensed by Authority) in which he made some mention of
this imposture concealed from the Fol. 531. 532.
most: so fatal was it in those times for any man out of Conscience, or
public ends, to oppose the Bishops Arminian designs, such a Stirrup to mount
up to preferments to advance them.

After this the Archbishops Chaplain Doctor Haywood on the 26. of August 1634
licensed Book entitled, Collectiones Theologica, writ by Thomas Chune, and
Dedicated to the Archbishop of Canterbury himself, in which he justified the
Arminian Errors, and the Church of Rome to be a true Church, whereof there were
two Impressions in one year, yet neither the Author nor Book once questioned,
though publicly complained of by Doctor Bastwicke, at his Censure in the
High Commission, where the Archb. openly justified it. In the years 1636. and
1639. the Arminian Errors were defended by Bishop Mountague in print, in his
Pars. 1. and. 2. Originum Ecclesiasticarum; Gods Love to mankind, and by
sundry others without control.

On the contrary; Doctor Twisse his Book in answer of Arminius, though writ in
Latin, was refused License by the Bishop and his Arminian Chaplains, Bray,
and Baker, and his answers to Doctor Jackson and the Arminian Pamphlet
entitled, Gods love to Mankind, suppressed; some Lectures of Bish. Davenant,
and Sermons of Doctor Clerk against the Arminians were likewise stopped at the
Press, and not suffered to be printed with their other Lectures and Sermons.
What Books against Mountague and the Arminians were called in, suppressed, and
the Authors, Printers, Dispersers of them severely prosecuted in the
High Commission, in the Years 1628. and 1629 We have already evidenced; Only
we shall inform you or one or two Presidents more of later date. Doctor
George Downham Bishop of Derry in Ireland publishing a Book in that Kingdom,
against the Arminians, and the Total and final Apostacy of the Saints from
Grace, about the Year 1630. Some of them coming over into England, Bishop
Laud caused a strict Letter to be written in his Majesty's name to Abbot
Archbishop of Canterbury, for the calling in and suppressing it within the
Realm of England, where it was accordingly seized on; and another Letter to
Doctor Usher, Archbishop of Armagh, for the suppressing and seizing thereof in
the Realm of Ireland; Which was manifested by the Docket Book in the signet
Office where entreyes of those Letters are made in Aug. 1631. and by this
Letter of Bishop, Usher to Bishop Laud, (found in his study at Lambheth
indorsed with his own hand, and arrested by Master Prynne) which fully
discovers, that he was the sole or principal occasion of his Majestices
Letters for calling in this Book; which he seconded with his own Letter to
Bishop Usher for that purpose, who returned this answer to him.

My most honored Lord;
THe 8th of October, I received your Letters of the 22. of August, etc. The
last part of your Lordships Letter concerns the Bishop of Derryes Book, for
the calling in whereof the 15th day of October I received His Majesty's
Letters, dated at Woodstocke NOTE.
the 24. of August, whereupon I presently sent out warrants, and caused all the
Books that were left unsent into England to be seized upon; What did pass
heretofore in the Press at Dublin, I had no eye unto, because it was out of my
province, and the care J supposed did more properly belong unto my brother of
Dublin. But seeing His Majestic has been pleased to impose that charge upon
me: I will (God willing) take order that nothing hereafter shall be published
contrary unto His Majesty's sacred direction. It seems Your Lordship did
conceive, that my Lord of Derryes book came out since the NOTE.
History of Gotteschalchus, whereas it was published above half a year
before, whereby it came to pass, that all the Coppies almost both in Ireland
and England were dispersed before the Prohibition came forth, The matter is not
new (as Your Lordship has rightly observed) but was long since preached in
Saint Paul's Church, when Doctor Bancroft was your Lordships Predecessor in
that See, at which time the Treatise of Perseverance was to have been
published, with Doctor Downams Lectures upon the 15th Psalm, at as the very
end of that Book is partly intimated. And in the History of Gotteschalchus,
Your Lordship may see your own observation fully verefied, that after Prelates
had written against Prelates, and Synods against Synods, these things could
have no end, until both sides became weary of contending, But sure I am I have
made Your Lordship weary longere this: and therefore it is high time now to
end. Therefore craving pardon for that prolixitie. I humbly take leave and rest,

Your Honors faithful Servant, Iace Armachanus.
Droghe da November. 8. 1631.

By this Letter it is apparent, that this Prelate, whiles Bishop of London,
exercised a kind of Patriarchicall Jurisdiction, for suppressing all Orthodox
Books against the Arminians both in England and Ireland; and that his commands
in this kind were punctually executed by those Archbishops in both Kingdoms,
who should have most stoutly opposed his Arminian Innovations.

About the Palsgraves first coming into Engl. An. 1635. there was a Book
printed, entitled the Palsgraves Religion, containing the sum of the Religion
professed in the Palatinate Churches, translated out of a printed Latin Copy;
which Archbishop Laud caused to be strictly called in and suppressed, only
because it glanced at the Arminian Errors: and bowing at the Name of JESUS, as
not warranted by Phil. 29. 10. which was proved by the testimonies of Master
Prynne, Michaell Spark Senior and others.

What policies (besides the forementioned Royal Declaration and Proclamation)
this Arch-Prelate contrived and practiced to suppress all preaching against
Armianisme in the Universities and elsewhere, we shall next discover and make
good by evidences under his own hand.

In the year 1629. soon after the dissolution of the Parliament Bishop Laud
presents to His Majesty a Paper written with his own hand (the original
whereof was seized on in his Study at Lambeth by Master Prynne, and produced at
the Bar) thus entitled by him. Considerations for the better settling of the
Church Government: whereof the third consideration was this.

That His Majesty would be Graciously pleased to command the Lords the Bishops
that they give charge in their Trieniall Visitations and at other times, both
by themselves and by the Archdeacons, that the Declaration for settling the
Questions in difference be strictly observed. And that His Majesty would be
Graciously pleased once in half a NOTE.
year, to call for an account of all or so many of these, as in Wisdom shall
think fit. These considerations were immediately after published, and sent to
every Archbishop and Bishops to be strictly put in execution as his Majesty's
own Instructions; when as in truth they were no other, but the Bishops,
contrived by him alone, as the original Coppie, written, and another Coppie
corrected afterward with his own hand together with the Bishop of Bristolls
Letter to him, dated Febr. 9. 1629. to resolve some Queries touching these
Instructions concerning the Lecturers in Bristoll, infallibly manifest. So that
His Majesty was here the Bishops mere Instrument to promote his Arminian and
popish designs.

These Instructions were published in most Diocese by the Bishops, but more
solemnly in London-Diocesse by this Bishop, who summoning all the Ministers and
Lecturers about the City of London, to London house, made a solemn Oration to
them wherein he pressed the necessity of these Instructions of his Majesty for
the good of the Church, and their cheerful obedience to them, and withal
sent letters to every Archdeacon in his Diocese to publish them to all the
Clergy, and to give an exact account to him how they were observed at the end
of their several Visitations; especially the third Instruction: For keeping
the Kings Declaration, that so differences and questions may cease, inserted
into these Letters with his own hand, as appeared by the Original Copy found
in his Study.

Soon after this Mr. Mady the Lecturer at Christ-Church in London, delivering
this Doctrine in a Sermon there. That Election was not Universal and Common,
but Mr. Madyes case.
special and peculiar, belonging to some: And, That the Principal and
efficient cause of Election was the will and Love of God, and not any merit, or
foreseen faith or works of man, which he manifested by some Scriptures and
Fathers, this Bishop upon information hereof, convented him before him for this
Orthodox Doctrine the 10. of March 1630. for that contrary to the Kings
Proclamation, he had treated of Predestination and the forementioned points:
Whereupon the Bishop by an Act of Court (found among his other Papers by Mr.
Prynne) prohibited him to Preach any more within his Diocese, and admonished
him to obey this his Lordships Order. And Doctor Cornelius Burges, about the
same time, for using only this Passage in a Sermon on Col. 2. 7. Jf your
Minister preach Popery or ARMINIANISME you may change your dwellings and not
trouble the Peace and Order of the Church, was convented before the Bishop,
enforced to deliver in the Copy of his Sermon, and much molested: and Mr.
White, with sundry others suspended, for lightly touching upon some points
relating to Arminianisme, though agreeable to the Scriptures, and 17. Article
of our Church.

As he thus proceeded in his Diocese, so he was far more violent in this
kind in our Universities, especially in Oxford where he was Chauncellor, of
which we shall give you these few instances.

One Mr. Thomas Hill of Hart-hall in Oxford on the 24. of May 1631. Preaching
at Saint Maryes Church there on James 1. 16. let fall these Passages in his
Sermon: And Mr. Hill^ Case.
here were my time and learning parallel to my Zeal, what a tempting does
present it self, to show how rashly (that I say not cruelly) our Pelagian
Votaries, have handled the Decrees and Statutes of the King of Heaven: But they
are to be mischieved into honor (but no matter how) which tempts them to
disrelish sound Doctrine on no other ground then did David because the Lords
do not favor it. 1. Sam. 29. 6. Scriptures they use worse then the Turks do
Christians at Tunis, enslave it to the vassallage of the foulest error, and
according to their most current garb employ it to defend Popery, or as bad,

deep. and without speedy succor will prove mortal. I am persuaded these late
transmarine T^nets had not been so jolly and brief among us, nor the opposite
truth so Diametrally condemned by many, had they first made proof of these
points in their own retired and serious contemplations.

For these slight glances against the Arminians (the Copy whereof was sent up
to Bishop Laud, seized among his Papers, and endorsed with his hand;) by his
procurement Mr. Hill was conuented before the Vice Chancellor and heads of
Houses, and enforced to make a public submissive Recantation upon his knees,
in a full Convocation held the 16. of July 1631. recorded in the University
Register. f. 35. to this effect I Thomas Hill do freely and sincerely
acknowledge before this Venerable Assembly of Convocation, that in a Sermon
lately by me Preached in Saint Mary's, I did let fall diverse scandalous
speeches, partly in opposition to his Majesty's Jnjunctions, by odious justling
together of certain factions in the Church, and imputing Pelagianisme and
Popery to the one side, Partly in disparagement of the present Government of
State and Church, by making foul and erroneous Opinions, the rediest way now
adays, to preferment etc. All NOTE.
which passages in my Sermon I confess to have given just offense to the
University, and to deserve the sharpest of Censures. Wherefore with all humble
submission, I beseech the whole University represented in this Venerable
House, to pass by this my woeful error, undiscreet and misguided zeal, And
do faithfully promise hence forward to abstain from all such scandalous
aspertions and intimations, as tending only to the disparagment of our Church,
and the distraction and detrement of the University. And this my submission I
humbly crave may be accepted, which I do here make willingly, and from my heart
with true sorrow for what is past.

Thomas Hill.

Upon this submission and Recantation, the Arminian faction in Oxford grew very

bold, and having the both Chauncellor and Vice-Chauncellor of their party,
vented their errors publikly both in the Pulpit and Schools without any
public check; whereupon one Mr. Thomas Forde of Magdalen Hall, Mr. Giles
Thorn of Bailioll College, and Mr. Giles Hodges of Exeter College, moved
with a pious zeal and indignation against their insolences, in June and July,
1631. in their Sermons at Sr. Maryes used some bold expressions against the
Arminians and their errors, under the Titles of Pelagians and Demi-Pelagians;
for which being convented before the Vice Chancellor, Doctor Smith, and others
of the Arminian party, as Offenders against the Kings Instructions; and being
ordered to bring in the Copies of their Sermons to him, when those who preached
Arminianisme, were neither questioned nor reproved, but applauded, advanced for
it, they thereupon perceiving the Vice-Chancellors partiality and Injustice,
appealed from him to the Proctors (as they might do by the University Statutes)
who received their appeals. Hereupon Bishop Laud complains of their Appeals
to the King, who on the 23. day of August following, heard the whole business
at Woodstocke, where, (by the Bishops procurement there present) these three
young hopeful Divines were ordered to be expelled the University, and the two
Proctors for receiving their Appeal, deprived of their places (a President with
out parallel in any former Age) whereupon they were all three in full
Convocation on the 26. of August, accordingly banished and expelled the
University as was evidenced by the sentence of their Banishment and
deprivation, recorded in the University Register. fol. 32. to 39.

That this sentence of theirs was the Bishops own Act, was manifested by the
Copies of their Accusations, by transcripts of their Sermons found in his
Study, endorsed with his own hand, by their several Petitions to him for
restitution to the University and likewise by these Passages in his Diary:
Days of observation to me, The great hearing of the Oxford disorders at
Woodstocke by King Charles August 23. 1631. (A sentence so grateful to him, so
advantageous to the Arminian faction, that both in his Diary, and Book of
private Devotions, he make; the day on which it was given, a kind of
Anniversary holy day, of special observation to him) After which it thus
follows in his Diary.

August 23. 1631. In this June and July, were the great disorders by appealing
from Doctor Smith, then Vice Chancellor, the chief ringleaders were Mr. Ford
of Magdalen Hall, and Mr. Thorn of Baylioll College: The Proctors Mr.
Atherton Burch and Mr. John Doughty received their Appeals, as if it had not
been Parturbatio pacis, etc. The Vice Chancellor was forced in a Statutable
way to appeal to the King. The King with all the Lords of his Council then
present, heard the Cause at Woodstocke, Aug. 23. 1631. being Tuesday in the
afternoon, The sentence upon the hearing was, That Ford, Thorn, and Hodges of
Exeter Coll: should be banished the University: And both the Proctors were
commanded to come into the Convocation House and there resign their Office,
that two others might be named out of the same Colleges, Doctor Prideaux
Rector of Exeter College, and Doctor Wiskinson Principal of Magdelen-Hall,
received a sharp Admonition for their misbehaviours in this business, (viz.
for opposing the Arminian party, and favoring these Orthodox Scholars, being
of their own Houses.)

True it is, that after this sentence of Banishment pronounced and executed
against these parties, one of them, to wit, Master Hodges, upon his most humble
Petition to His Majesty, and submission to the Archbishop, with promise to be
his faithful obsequious Votary for the future, was restored to the University
for one years space, only as a Probationer, to bewail his offense and learn
obedience, yet upon these two harsh conditions.

First, That he should make a public Recantation Sermon in Saint Mary's Church
in Oxford before the University, confessing his great offense in preaching
contrary to His Majesty's Declaration; which he did accordingly on the first
of January following, the Copy of which Sermon he sent up to the Bishop, in
whose Study it was seized:

Secondly, That he should make this ensuing submission and Recantation in the
Convocation House before the whole Assembly of the Doctors, Procters, Regent,
and non-regent Masters, on his bended Knees, and with a mind officiously
devoted; which he did accordingly; 15. December. 1631. as is manifest by the
University Register, where his submission is recorded in these words, Fol. 42.

I William Hodges do freely and sincerely acknowledge before this venerable
Assembly of Convocation, that in a Sermon by me preached in Saint Mary's upon
the 26. of June last past, I fell upon the delivery of those points which by
His Majesty's Royal Injunctions were forbidden me to meddle withal, and
therein I with hearty sorrow confess, that I did let fall some passages which
might be taken to the disparagement of the Government of the Church, in making
Erroneous and heretical opinions, the way to preferment. All which with the
maine current of my discourse might sound to sedition in the ears of the
present Assembly. By this my great and unexcusable offense, I do freely
acknowledge, that I have deserved the sharpest of censures and severest of
punishments. And therefore that his Royal Majesty has justly rewarded me
for-the same, it being an offense of so high a nature. And I have nothing at
all to plead, but the Royal Mercy of my Gracious Sovereign for my
restitution to this famous University. This my confession and submission, I do
most humbly tender to the favorable acceptance of this venerable house,
craving the pardon, as of the University in general, so more specially of our
most Honorable Chancellor, whom with all humility, I beseech to present this
my acknowledgement unto his Majesty's sacred hand, as the pledge and engagement
both in present, and for the future, of my readiest obedience.

William Hodges.

This done, after a full years probation and bewayling of his disobedience, he
was upon his Petition to His Majesty fully restored, and his censure at
Woodstocke discharged, as the University Register manifests, which records both
his Petition, and Restitution. page 50. 51.

Master Thorn likewise made a most submissive Petition to the Archbishop,
desiring his favor pardon, and readmission to the University, but yet he found
no fruits thereof. As for Mr. Ford; he refused to make any addresses to him and
returning into Devonshire, some friends of his intended to elect him for their
Lecturer, or Vicar it, the Town of Plymouth; of which the Bishop being
informed presently procured a Letter from His Majesty, to the Major and
Corporation of Plymouth not to choose Mr. Ford for their Lecturer or Vicar upon
any terms, under pain of his Royal displeasure; and another Letter to the
Bishop of Exeter, not to admit him to be their Lecturer or Vicar, in case they
should elect him, notwithstanding His Majesty's Letter; as appears by the
Docquet Book in the Privy signet Office, September 1631. Wherein we find these
two Entries.

A Letter to the Major and Aldermen of Plymouth, requiring them to forbear,
either to make any election of one Thomas Foard unto the Lectureship of that
Town, or any ways to assist him in procuring the Advowson of the Vicarage
there; be being lately expelled the University of Oxford, for a notable
disobedience by him showed, procured by (the Bishop of London) dated 12. Sep.
1631.

A like to the Lord Bishop of Exeter, signifying His Majesty's pleasure, that
in case the said Thomas Foard should be elected to the said Lectureship, or
procure the said Advowson, he do not give any approbation thereof; procured,
ut supra, dated 12. Septem. 1631.

These Letters were drawn by the Bishops own direction, not by the Secretary
of State, or Clerks of the Signet, being not entered at large in the Letter
Signet Book, but only this note of them entered in the Docquet Book, by which
his implacable transcendent malice appeared against the opposites to
Arminianisme, that not satisfied with their unjust banishment out of Oxford, he
endeavored by indirect means to hinder them from Ecclesiastical preferments
in the Church, whereas he advanced those of the Arminian faction to places of
highest eminency in the Church, as we shall manifest in due season.

After these severe proceedings against these Anti-Arminians in the
University, the Arminians there grew very numerous, insolent, few or none
dating to oppose them but Doctor Prideaux, with two or three more in some
passages in their Sermons, for which they were presently questioned by the
Arminian Faction, and enjoined public Recantations; witness the Recantation
of William Hobbes Fellow of Trinitio College, the 25. of January 1632. for
preaching against falling from Grace, contrary to the intent and purpose of His
Majesty's Declaration, in a Sermon on a Tuesday at St. Mary's; Recorded in the
Oxford Register f. 54 The Recantation of Master Thomas Cook of Brase-Nose the
19th of July 1634. for using some passages in a Latin Sermon in Saint Mary's,
which by consequence might imply connivency and partiality in the
Vice Chancellor (Doctor Duppa) toward some of the Arminian party, that had

violated the Kings Edicts, concerning such points of controversy as are
forbidden; Registered in the University Register, page 90. with the convention
and submission of Master Kichard Kilby, of Lincoln College, before Doctor
Bayley, Vice Chancellor and others, March 13. 1637. for reviving some
controversies concerning Arminianisme, contrary to His Majesty's Declaration;
entered in the University Register, fol. 152.

About September 1632. there were some Satyricall Verses scattered abroad in
Oxford against the Arminians, thus entitled. The Academicall Army of
Epidemicall Arminians: To the tune of the Souldieur; wherein Doctor Corbet
Doctor Duppa, Doctor Iackeson, Doctor Marsh, Doctor Turner with others, of the
Arminian faction were mentioned, and Bishop Laud as their General, who
receiving a Coppie of them, December 19. 1632. writ this endorsment on it.
Oxford Libell against such as they will needs call Arminians; Who were all
backed by Bishop Laud their grand Patron, and preferred to the highest
Ecclesiastical preferments.

How the Arminian party prevailed in the University of Cambridge, by this
Arch-Prelates abetment, so far as to procure Barrets Recantation of the
Arminian Tenets (solemnly made in that University, in 37. of Q. Elizabeth's
Reign, and then printed) to be rased out of the University Register, where it
was Recorded, and to prosecute Mr. Bernard whom he caused to be censured and
ruined in the High Commission for preaching against the increase of Popery and
Arminianisme (of which hereafter) is so well known to most, that we shall not
insist upon it, most of the heads of Houses there (as Doctor Brooks, Doctor
Beale, Doctor Martin, Doctor Paske, Doctor Cosens, Doctor Lany, etc) being
professed Arminians, and this Archbishops Creatures to prosecute his designs.

How diligent the Bishops were, by color of His Majesty's Declarations, and
Instructions, to suppress all preaching against all Arminianisme in their
Diocese by this Arch-Prelates instigation, will appear by their printed
Visitation Articles, for this purpose; particularly, by the Articles of
enquiry, and direction for the Diocese of Norwich, in the first Visitation of
Rich. Mountague, Bishop of that Diocese, An. Dom. 1638 Tit. 5. Artic. 22. in
Churchwardens. Does your Minister commonly or of set purpose in his populer
Sermons full upon those much disputed and little understood doctrines, of Gods
eternal Predestination, of Election antecedaneous, of Reprobation irrespective
without sin foreseen, of Freewill, of Perseverance, and not falling from
Grace, points obscure, unfoldable, unfoordable, untractable, at which that
great Apostle stood at gaze with, Oh the height and depth of the riches of the
Wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways
past finding out? Romans 11. 33. By the Archbishops Injunctions prescribed to
them in His Majesty's Name, whereof this was one. That they should take
special care that no Minister nor Lecturer in their Diocese should preach
upon the prohibited controverted points, contrary to His Majesty's Declarations
and Instructions; and that they should give an yearly account to the
Archbishop of their proceedings herein, which they did accordingly; By means
whereof the Arminian Errors were freely vented in all Diocesses, without any
public opposition, and those who out of zeal to truth durst open their
mouths to refuse them, were silenced, suspended, and brought into the High
Commission by this Archbishops practice, to their undoing; whiles the
Arminians, on the contrary, had free liberty to broach their Erroneous Tenets,
without control, and were advanced to the greatest benefices, and
Ecclesiastical Dignities.

Besides this Arch-prelate not satisfied with propagating these dangerous
Arminian Novelties throughout the Realm of England, endeavored to infect by
degrees the whole Church of Irel, therewith. To which end he not only caused
Bishop Downehams book, of perseverance; there printed against the Arminians to
be suppressed (as you heard before) but the very Articles of the Church of
Ireland made in a full National Synod and Convocation held at Dubline, 1615.
and ratified by King James (wherein all the Arminian Errors are terminis
terminantibus condemned as Erroneous,) to be repealed; the L. Deputy Wentworth,
by high hand (being but the Archbishops instrument herein) enforcing the
Convocation at Dublin. An, 1634. by sundry threatening Messages full fore
against their wills, to condescend to the repealing of them under pretext of
establishing the 39. Articles of the Church of England, (comprised in the
former) for the only Articles of that Church for Unity and Uniformity sake; as
was attested by Dr. Hoyle, a Member of that Irish Convocation at the Lords Ear,
and long since published in print with the Archbishops privity, if not command,
by Dr. Heylin, in his History of the Sabbath, Part. 2. chap. 8. sect. 9. page
259. in these very terms. And here unto they were encouraged a great deal
the rather: because in Ireland, what time his Majesty's Commissioners were
employed, about the settling of that Church, Anno 1615. there passed an Article
which much confirmed them in their courses, and has been often since alleged
to justify both them and their proceedings: the Article is this; The first day
of the week which is the Lords Day, is wholly to be dedicated to the service of
God, and therefore we are bound therein to rest from our common and daily
business, and to bestow that leisure upon holy exercises, both private and
public. What moved His Majesty's Commissioners to this strict authority, that
J cannot say, but sure J am, that till that time, the Lords day never had
attained such credit, as to be thought an Article of the faith, though of some
men's fancies. Nor was it like to be of long continuance, it was so violently
followed; THE WHOLE BOOK BEING NOW CALLED IN, and in the place thereof, the
Articles of the Church of England confirmed by Parliament in that Kingdom,
Anno 1634.

Uniformity with the Church of England was the pretense for revoking these
Articles, but the real cause was, because they defined in terminis, The Pope
to be Antichrist; the Church of Rome to be no true Church, the Lords day to be
totally sanctfied, and all the Arminian Tenets to be erroneous, contrary to the
established Doctrine both of the Church of England and Ireland. Grand obstacles
to this Arch-Preltats Popish NOTE.
designs, and therefore necessary to be set aside. These Articles being
thus repealed, the Archbishop soon after sent over Master Chapple (the most
notorius seducing Arminian in the whole University of Cambridge) into Jreland,
to be President of the College of Dublin there, to poison that University with
his Arminian Drugs, which he there publicly vented, as Dr. Hoyle (Divinity
Reader in that University) attested upon Oath, who had frequent contestations
with him concerning the same: This Chapple joining with Dr. Bramhall Chaplain
to the Lord Deputy Wentworth (a professed Arminian who managed all the
Ecclesiastical affairs of that Church under the Archbishop and Lord Deputy)
raised a great party there to oppose and suppress the truth.

What influence this Arch-Prelate likewise had upon the Prelates and Clergy of
Scotland, and how far he proceeded in introducing Arminianisme and by it
Popery into the Church of Scotland, is so largely demonstrated by M. Baily, in
his Canterburians selfe-conviction, the last Edition, that we shall not here
insist upon it.

And thus we have given you a true and Copious Evidence of this Arch-Prelates
endeavors to undermine our established Religion by introducing fomenting
dangerous Arminian Errors in all our three Kingdoms, of purpose to Usher
Popery into them by insensible degrees through this Jesuitical devise.

We shall now proceed to his varius attemps and endeavors to undermine the
established The Archbishops various Attempts and Endeavors to undermine our
established Protestant Religion, and introduce Doctrinall Popery into our
Church.
Protestant and advance the Romish Religion in our Churches, by introducing,
broaching maintaining printing, publishing all kind of Doctrinall points of
Popery, by suppressing Books and purging out Passages against them in old and
new writers; by promoting protecting the Propugners, discouraging, persecuting
the oppugners of Popish Assertions, Sermons, Pamphlets, and sundry other
practices.

The Authorizing Printing dispersing Popish Books Doctrines and prohibiting
contrary Impressions to refute them, being the most pernicious destructive
prevalent project of all others to undermine Religion seduce corrupt both the
present and future Generations with Popish Errors and set up Popery in its full
vigor, we shall begin with this Archbishops various practices, concerning the
Authorizing, printing, dispersing of Popish, prohibiting, suppressing purging
corrupting Orthodox Books, against Popery; wherein he directly traced the
Popish Prelates and Jesuits footsteps.

The Pope with Popish Prelates and Jesuits being Masters of the printing
Presses in most parts, had four principal ways to advance Popery, and
suppress the Protestant Religion, in relation only to printing.

The first was to License and print sundry Books and Discourses from time to
time upon al occasions in defense of their Erroneous Popish Tenets against the
Protestants.

The second, to prohibit sundry special Treatises against Popery to be
printed, reprinted, dispersed, or read; and to seize on and suppress them in
all places with greatest diligence when printed.

The third, to purge out the principal Passages, Motives, Invectives against
Popery and its abuses in all old printed Books, ere they should be reprinted;
and out of all new Books tendered to the Press, before they could gain
License to pass it.

The fourth, to punish the Authors, Printers, dispersers of any prohibited or
unlicensed Books against Popery, with the severest censures: all which is
abundantly evident, by their several Indices Librorum Prohibitorum, and
Librorum Expurgandorum by the Provincial Council of Sennes, Anno 1528. Apud
Surium Council: Tom. 4. p. 718. to 723. Laurentius Bochellius, Decreta Ecclesia
Gall, lib. 1. Tit. 10. De Libris vetitis, cap. 1. to 29. The Statute of 34, and
35. H. 8. c. 1. Master Fox his Acts and Monuments, the old Edition, page 536.

Pontifieijs, etc. Oxon 1627. Antonij Posse^ini Bibliothesa selecta, with sundry
others;

The Archbishop in imitation of this their policy, first of all engrossed the
sole power of licensing all new Books of Divinity into his own, his
Chaplains and Creatures hands, so as nothing could pass the Press with
public approbation but by his or their precedent approbation, without danger
of ruin to the Authors, Printers, Stationers, Venders, Dispersers. And because
he feared and experimentally discerned that when Stationers or Printers were
restrained to print new Books against Popery, they would presently fall to
reprint old ones formerly licenced by Authority; to prevent this inconvenience
to the Popish party, he procured this ensuing Decree of his own contriving, to
be ratified by the Lords in the Star Chamber, then sent it to the Stationers
to print, and commanded them punctually to observe it, whereby he Monopolized
the sole power of authorizing Divinity Books for the Press to himself and
his Agents; and restrained the reprinting of all Books, though formerly printed
by Authority, without a special review, and relicencing of them, by him and
his Chaplains.

This Decree was entitled.

A Decree of Star Chamber concerning Printing, made the first day of July,
1637. Imprinted at LONDON by Robert Barker, etc. 1637.

This Decree in the Printed Order of Star Chamber prefixed thereunto, is
Expressly alleged, to be drawn, and Penned by the advice of the most Reverend
Father in God the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, the Right Honorable
and Right Reverend Father in God the Lord Bishop of London, Lord High Treasurer
of ENGLAND, and of the Lord Keeper, the Lord chief Justices, and Lord chief
Barron, when it was the Archbishops project only, who sent it to the Press,
the others names being used only for conformity, as M. Walley and others
attested upon Oath: We shall rehearse only such clauses thereof as are most
observable and pertinent to our purpose.

2. Jtem. That no person or persons whatsoever, shall at any time print or
cause to be imprinted, any Book or Pamphlet whatsoever, unless the same Book

respectively, as the several causes shall require, shall be thought fitting.

That all other Books, whether of Divinity, Physic, Philosophy, Poetry, or
what soever, shall be allowed by the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, or Bishop
of London for the time being, or by their appointment, or the Chancellours, or

being.

Always provided, that the Chancellor or Vice Chancellor of either of the
Universities shall License only such Book or Books that are to be printed

writing of all and every such book and books unto the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, or Lord Bishop of London for the time being, upon pain to have and
suffer such punishment for offending herein as by this Court or by the said
high Commission Court respectively, as the several causes shall require, shall
be thought fitting.

6. Item, That no Merchant or other person or persons whatsoever, which shall
import, or bring any book or books into the Kingdom, from any parts beyond

Bishop of London, or one of them for the time being, have appointed one of
their Chaplains, or some other Learned man, with the Master and Wardens of the
Company of Stationers, or one of them, and such others as they shall call to
their assistance, to be present at the opening thereof, and to view the same:
And if there shall happen to be found any seditious, schismatic or offensive
Book or Books, they shall forthwith be brought unto the said Lord Archbishop
of Canterbury, Lord Bishop of London for the time being, or one of them, or to
the High Commission Office, to the end that as well the Offender or Offenders
may be punished by the Court of Star Chamber, or the High Commission Court
respectively, as the several causes shall require, according to his or their
demerit; as also that such further course may be taken concerning the same
Book or Books, as shall be thought fitting.

It is further Ordered and Decreed, that no Merchant, Bookseller, or other
person or persons whatsoever, shall imprint, or cause to be imprinted, in the
parts beyond the Seas, or elsewhere, nor shall import or bring, nor willingly
assist or consent to the importation or bringing from beyond the Seas into this
Realm, any English Books, or part of books, or books whatsoever, which are
or shall be, or the greater, or more part whereof is or shall be English, or of
the English tongue, whether the same Book or Books have been here formerly
printed, or not, upon pain of the forfeiture of all such English Books so
imprinted or imported, and such further censure and punishment, as by this
Court, or the said High Commission Court respectively, as the several causes
shall require, shall be thought meet.

18. Item, That no person or Persons, do hereafter reprint, or cause to
reprinted, any book or books whatsoever (THOUGH FORMERLY PRINTED WITH
LICENSE) without being revived; and a new License obtained for the reprinting
thereof. Always provided, that the Stationer or Printer be put to NOTE.
no other charge hereby, but the bringing and leaving of two printed Copies of
the Book to be printed, as is before expressed of written Copies, with all
such additions as the Author has made.

XXIV. Item, The Court does hereby declare their firm resolution, that if any
person or persons, that is not allowed Printer, shall hereater presume to set
up any Press for printing or shall work at any such Press, or set, or
Compose any Letters to be wrought by any such Press; he, or they so offending,
shall from time to time, by the Order of this Court, be set in the Pillory, and
Whipped through the City of London, and suffer such other punishment, as this
Court shall Order or think fit to NOTE.
inflict upon them, upon Complaint or proof of such offense or offenses, or
shall be otherwise punished, as the Court of High Commission shall think fit,
and is agreeable to their Commission.

XXV. Item, That for the better discovery of printing in Corners without
License: The Master and Wardens of the Company of Stationers for the time being
or any two Licensed Master Printers, which shall be appointed by the Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, or Lord Bishop of London for the time being shall
have power and Authority, to take unto themselves such assistance as they shall
think needful, and to search what Houses and Shoppes (and at what time shall
think fit) especially Printing Houses, and to view what is in Printing, and to
call for the License to see whether it be Licensed or no and if not, to seize
upon so much as is printed, together with the several Offenders, and to bring
them before the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Lord Bishop of London
for the time being, that they or either of them may take such further Order
therein as shall appertain to Justice.

The Archbishop and his Confederates having accroached by color of this
Decree the sole power of the Press into their hands, which they usurped,
without any such pretext of Authority, long before the passing thereof, began
after the Popish guife, in imitation of the Pope and Popish Inquisitors.

First, to prohibit the re-printing and sale of sundry Orthodox Books formerly
printed and sold by Authority, of which we shall give you sundry notable
instances. One of the first Books we find prohibited by the Popish Prelates in
England, in King Henry the 8. his Reign; was the Bible and New Testament in
English of Tyndall^ translation, and all other English Bibles and Testaments
having any Annotations or Preambles, which were ordered to be out and blotted
out of the said Bibles and Testaments in such sort, as they could not be
perceived or read, under pain of forfeiting 40s. for every such Bible with
Annotations, or preambles, as you may read in the Statute of 34. and 35. H. 8.
cap. 1. and in Master Fox his Acts and Monuments, page: 635. 621. Whereupon
those Annotations and Preambles were cut and blotted out accordingly in sundry
old Bibles yet extant. Yea the first Book in the Roman Indices, Librorum
prohibitorum, in Foreign parts, is the Bible of some Translations (especially
Bibles in the Vulgar Tongue with Notes, and Prologues, the Bibles of Rob.
Stephanus, Vatablas, ^agnine, and others, (though Papists) with the Arguments
of Raynerius upon the Psalms expressly ordered to be expunged, as you may read
in the Index Librorum Expurgatorum, set forth by Gaspar Quiroga Archbish. of
Toledo, General Inquisitor of Spain, Salmuri 1601. p. 7. to 18. 151. to 152.
in Bochellus Decreta Ecclesia Gal. l. 1. Tit. 10. Delibris vetitis, c. 1. 11.
Dr. James his Index Generalis Librorum prohibitorum, with others. So one of the
first Books most strictly prohibited to be printed, imported or sold, by this
Archb: was the English Geneva Bible with Marginal Notes and Prefaces, though
printed here in Engl. not only without the least restraint, but Cum Privilegio
NOTE.
Regia Majestatis, during all Q. Elizabeth's and K. James their Reigns, by the
Queens and Kings Printers, and since our Printers have neglected to reprint
them for fear of hundering the sale of Bibles of the last Translation without
Notes, they have been sold without any contradiction till this Archbishop began
to domineere; yet no sooner was he advanced to his Papal See, but the
printing, importing and sale of all these Bibles with Notes was most strictly
inhibited, the Bibles searched for, seized, confiscated, the importers and
Sellers of them imprisoned, vexed, and some of them ruined in the
High Commission Court. Michaell Spark Senior, deposed, that himself, and
sundry other Stationers had diverse of their English Bibles with Notes seized
and taken from them by the Archbishops means, which were commonly sold before
his time, without restraint, but contradicted and suppressed by him; and that
himself with diverse others had been prosecuted in the High Commission for
selling of Bibles with Notes, and some imprisoned and fined for this cause. Mr.
Prynne, produced an Abstract of a Letter dated Septem. 30. 1633. from Sir
William Boswell, (His Majesty's Agent in the Low Countries,) endorsed with Mr.
Dells hand, and found in the Archbishops Study, wherein among other accounts of
his good services for the Archbishop, he certified His Grace, that there had
been two Impressions of English Bibles at Delfe, and Amsterdam, with the
Geneva Notes, etc. Whereof he might be pleased to make such use as seems best
for suppressing the abuse at home, whether they are likewise NOTE.
transported under pretense of White-paper, And April 14. 1638. he received
another Information out of Holland from I. S. endorsed with Master Dells hand,
concerning the Printing of English Bibles there in Quarto and Folio, with Notes
in the Margent, intended to be transported thence into England. A clear
Evidence, that his Grace was the Original cause of suppressing these Bibles,
not only at home but in fortaigne parts, and all for fear the Notes in them
should overmuch instruct the people in the knowledge of the Scriptures; which
Notes though highly esteemed of in all reformed Churches, and printed not only
with their Latin Bibles, but with the English, French, Dutch, German, and
Italian Bibles in vulgar use among them, and in the Folio Bible printed in
Scot. 1610; yet now they must be totally prohibited, NOTE.
suppressed only in England, by this Popish Prelate, though here formerly
printed Cum Privilegio, and freely vended, read, approved, used in our Church
for above 60. years space together. How much Impiety, and Popery lies coucked
in this notorious fact of his (not to be paralleld by any Protestant Prelates,
but Popes and Popish Prelates only whom he imitated herein) we must humbly
submit to Your Lordships and all Protestants considerations.

In the Year 1631. William Beale, Servant to Master Henry Gellibrand,
Professor of the Mathematickes at Gresham College London, set forth an
Almanacke for that Year, by His Masters Approbation, printed for the Company
of Stationers, agreeing with the Calendar before Master Fox his Acts and
Monuments printed often times by public Authority, without the least exceptions
both in Queen Elizabeth's. King James, and King Charles Reigns, in which
Almanacke the names of the Popish Saints Canonized by Popes and thrust into our
Kalendars were omitted, and the names of real Saints and Martyrs mentioned in
the Book of Martyrs, inserted, just as they are in Master Foxes his Calendar:
This Prelate being then Bishop of London taking great exceptions against this
Almanac, brought both Mr. Gellibrand and his man into the High Commission for
compiling and publishing it, where he prosecuted them with great violence. At
the hearing of the cause, it appearing to the Court, that it was Verbatim the
same with Mr. Fox his authorized Calendar, and that some Almanackes of this
kind had formerly bin printed, as tending only to the honor of our own real
Martyrs, and the disparagment only of false Popish Saints, Master Gellibrand
was acquitted by Archbishop Abbot, and the General Vote of the High Commission
Court, none censuring him but this Bishop: who perceiving Master Gellibrand to
be acquitted, He thereupon stood up in a great passion, and publicly informed
the Court, That the Queen her self sent for him, and specially complained to
him against this Almanacke, which gave great offense to those of her Religion;
and desired NOTE.
him to prosecute the Author of it, and suppress the Book; and therefore he
hoped he should not pass unpunished in this Court; yet notwithstanding the
Court acquitted him: Hereupon the Bishop stood up again in a fury, and said to
Mr. Gellibrand, Sir, Remember you have made a Faction in this Court, for which
you ought to be punished; and know that you are not yet discharged hence, I
will sit in your Skirts, for I hear you keep Conventicles at G^esham-Colledge
after your Lectures there. Whereupon he gave Order for a second prosecution
against him in the High Commission, which so afflicted this good man, that it
put him into a Fever fit, whereof he died. And because the Bishop could not
procure Master Gellibrand to be censured, and this Almanacke burned as he
desired, the Papists thereupon bought up most of them and made them Martyrs, by
burning them in the fire. All which was deposed at the Lords Bar by Mr.
Gellibrand of Bread-street London, and ready to be attested by sundry others,
had not the Bishop himself acknowledged the truth thereof.

In this Evidence there are four things very remarkable.

FIrst, That this Bishop was so shameless as to profess in open Court, that
in this, Prosecution of Master Gellibrand, he was but the Queens and Papists
Agent NOTE.
proceeding thus against him at their special request.

Secondly, That he was extraordinary violent, if not extremely irregular and
unjust in this prosecution, making no Conscience to ruin a Learned Pious
Protestant, without any just Cause, to pleasure the Papists, notwithstanding
he was generally acquitted by the Court.

3ly. That when he could not have his will of this innocent Gentleman one way,
he meditared present revenge another way and proclaimed it in open Court,
charging him with raising a Faction in the High Commission Court, when as his
fellow Commissioners would not concur with him in his Factious prosecution to
gratify the Papists.

4ly. That he bare an extraordinary affection to Popish, but an extreme
inveterate malice to true Protestant Saints and Martyers, because he was so
far incensed against Mr. Gillibrand and his Almanacke only for omitting the
names of false Popish Saints and Martyrs, and placing the names of our real
Protestant Martyrs in their stead: the truth whereof was then further
manifested at the Bar by a memorable Passage in Doctor John Pocklingtons Altar
Christianum, licenced by Doctor Bray, the Archbishops own household Chaplain
(as appears by the printed Approbation prefixed to it, and perused by the
Archbishop himself, who ordered it to be printed) of which book there being
two editions, Mr Pryn found both of them curiously gilded, and bound up in the
Archbishops Study at Lambheth, in both of which this Passage remained
uncorrected, unexpunged, wherein the Calender before the Book of Martyrs
(which Mr. Gellibrand imitated) with our Godly Martyrs are most grossly railed
against, censured, traduced as Traitors, Murderers, Rebels, Heretics, and
the Popish Saints, in whose places they were inserted, proclaimed to be, the
holy Martyrs and Confessors of Jesus Christ, whose names are written in
heaven, in these very terms, which you may find in the first Edition, Page
92. and Edit. 2. Page 114. This was the holy and profitable use of these
Diptickes, much like the List of persons CENSVRED BY HOLY CHVRCH, called WITH
SOME REPROACH OF TRVTH AND NOTE.
CHRISTIAN RELIGION, Catalogus testium Veritatis (collected into one volume by
Flacius, Illericus, and enlarged since by others:) And as unlike a CALENDAR
that I have seen, (to wit, that before Mr. Fox his Acts and Monuments) wherein
THE HOLY MARTYRS, AND CONFESSORS OF JESUS CHRJST (who had not only place
sometimes in these Dipticks, but WHOSE NAMES ARE WRITTEN IN HEAVEN) ARE RASED
OVT, AND TRAITORS, MVRDERERS, REBELS, AND HERETICS SET IN THEIR ROOMS; so as
if Penry, Hacket, or Legate had come in time, they might have challenged as
orient and scarlet a dye as some of them; Certainly more venom and malice
could never have been couched or Vented in fewer words against Mr. Fox his
authorized Calendar to his Acts and Monuments, against our own English
Martyrs, the Professors of the Protestant Religion in all ages and so by
consequence against our Religion it self, then is comprised and vented in
these lines, twice published in print in these Editions by this Arch-Prelates,
and his Chaplains special approbation without the least retractation, of
purpose to please the Popish party, offended with Mr. Gellebrands Almanacke,
which this Bishop would have Martyred and burned for an Heretic (as our
Martyrs were) to gratify the Popish party much offended at it: by which the
whole World may clearly discern his strong inclination, his cordial
affection to them and their, his palpable disaffection to us, and our Religion.

We shall now proceed to other evidence. About the latter end of the year
1636. Master Prynne being certainly informed of the Archbishops intention to
procure a Decree in Starchamber prohibiting the reprinting of all old Books of
Divinity unless they were first reviewed, purged, new Licenced by his
Chaplains, or Agents, before this Decree was ratified, sent for Michael Spark
Senior and persuaded him to reprint some three or four old Books, of special
use, against Popery, ere this Decree should pass; by name, Thomas Beacons
Display of the Popish Mass, and his Relics of Rome (as being then most
seasonable and opposite to the Archbishops Romish designs) formerly printed
cum privilegio, in Queen Elizabeth's Reign, An. 1560. yea dedicated to all the
Bishops of England, and highly approved by them, Hereupon he caused Mistress
Anne Griffin to beg leave of the Company of Stationers (who were owners of
those Coppies) to reprint these Books, which being granted; she printed off
his Display of the Popish Mass, and began to Print his Relics of Rome. No
sooner was the first of them published abroad, but a Papist seeing one of them
newly printed, lying to be sold in a Booksellers shop in Paul's Churchyeard,
reading the Title thereof, grew very angry at the Book (being a very solid
learned Treatise against the Popish Mass, with the Ceremonies accompaning it)
and said; he wondered much that the Archbishop would suffer such Books to be
Printed in this Age: adding, that perchance he knew not of it, and therefore he
would go NOTE.
over to Lambheth and inform him thereof, to the end it might be suddenly
called in, ere it were dispersed: which it seems he performed accordingly, for
the very next morning the Archbishop called in this Book very strictly,
sending his Pursevants and Officers to seize on all of them they could meet
with, and understanding that Mistress Griffin printed it, he sent for her to
Lambheth, where he in a very angry manner demanded of her, why she did reprint
this book against the Mass NOW, above all other times, and whether she could
find no other time but this to print it? To which she answered, she did it for
want of other work to employ her servants, who else must sit still, seeing they
could get no good New books Licenced. Then he demanded of her, how she durst
reprint it without a new License? she answered, She did it by leave of the
Company of Stationers, and knew of no order to the contrary. After which he
threatened her with the high Commission, and told her, that if she printed any
more old Books though formerly licensed, without a review and new licensing of
them by his Chaplains, he would put down her printing House, and she should
never print again, though there was then no Order to the contrary; whereupon
she durst not proceed to print his Relics of Rome, but gave it over. All
which was fully proved by the several Oaths of Mr. Prynne, Michaell Spark
senior, and Anne Griffin: such an Arch-favourer of Popery was this Prelate then
grown, that he would not permit this Treatise against the verry Popish Mass it
self to be reprinted, though formerly often printed cum Privilegio, grows angry
at the printing of it, causes it presently to be suppressed upon a Papiste
Information, and thus checks the Printer. Was not Popery grown to a strong head
among us, when not so much as one small old Book against the Mass and
Idolatry of it, might pass the Press, but it must presently be suppressed by
this Arch bishops special command, and the Printer thus threatened for it? Yet
he forsooth (if we dare believe his Protestations) was then as averse from, as
great an Enemy to Popery, as any mortal breathing.

About the same time, a Book entitled, The Palsegraves Religion, containing
the Faith and Confession of the Churches of the Palatinate, (formerly printed,
in Latin, and then reprinted in English,) was called in and suppressed by this
Archbishops order, because it over-boldly refuted some points of Popery and
Arminianisme as was Attested by the Oaths of Master Pryune and Michaell Spark
Senior.

Master Walley, Clerk of Stationers Hall and Master Downs deposed, that after
the Decree for printing was made, there were diverse old Books against Popery
formerly Licenced, (as the Book of Martyrs, Bishop Jewels Works, some parts
of Doctor Willets Works and others) which the Archbishops and Bishop of
Londons Chaplains refused to new License; where upon they repaired to Sir John
Bramston then Lord chief Justice, and desired leave from him, that good Books
formerly licenced and printed, might be reprinted without new License, else
they should be undone for want of Books, seeing they could not procure these
Chaplains to License any good Books whether old or new. Who answered them,
that he could do nothing in it but they must go and attend the Archbishop, who
had the chief hand in making this Decree.

Mr. John Vicars Schoolmasters of Christ-Church soon after this Decree,
repaired to Doctor Baker (the Archbishops great Creature, Household Chaplain
to the Bishop of London,) for a New license of his History of the Gunpouder
Treason, formerly printed by License, which he had since enlarged with some
pertinent Additions: But Doctor Baker absolutely refused to License it: Master
Vicars admiring at it; demanded of him the reason why he would not license a
Book of such a subject as this against the Gun-pouder Treason, an act so
odious and detestable? who answered him, that we were not so angry with the
Papists now, as we were about 20. years since, and that there was no need of
any such Books as these to exasperate them, there being NOTE.
now an endeavor to win them to us by fairness and mildness.

By these (with sundry other instances of this kind which we pretermit) we
conceive it is most apparent; that one principal end of the Archbishops
usurping the power of Licensing Books and publishing this Decree concerning
the restraint of reprinting any Old Licensed books against Popery, and the
grossest errors in it, was, that Popery might again creep in among us by
degrees without the least opposition or impeachment.

Secondly, As he and his instruments prohibited the reprinting of old Orthodox
Books, so they refused to License sundry new ones, especially against Popery
and Arminianisme, suppressing them when printed by License of others: This was
evidenced, by the forecited Remonstrance of the Commons in Parliament, Anno
1628 by the forementioned Books against the Arminians, suppressed and called
in by this Archbishops means; and by these ensuing Depositions. Master Prynne
deposed, that in the Year 1627. Doctor Cosens published a Book entitled, A
Collection of private Devotions, Or, the hours of Prayer, fraught with Popery,
and Popish Superstitions, which gave great offense; whereupon, at the
importunity of diverse well'-affected persons, he Writ a Refutation thereof,
entitled; A Brief Survey and Censure of Master Cosens his Cosening Devotions;
which by this Bishops means and his Confederates was refused License, at
London House; but afterward licenced at Lambeth House by Doctor Featly, and
printed sitting the Parliament, in the Year 1628. for writing which Book only
against Doctor Cosens his Popery, he was immediately after the Parliament
ended, questioned in the High Commission by this Bishops procurement, and
thence delivered by a Prohibition, to the Bishops great grief.

Master Henry Burton deposed; That he writ a Book against Cosens his Devotions,
which was called in by the Bishops means: after which he compiled and
published another Book entitled, The Bayting of the Popes Bull, licensed by
Doctor Goade, for which he was called before the Council Table by this
Archbishops instigation who was then present spoke much against the Book, and
called it a Libell, although penned and written only against the Pope and his
seditious dangerous Bull. That he printed by license, a Book called A Plea to
an Appeal, in refutation of diverse Popish and Arminian Errors broached by
Mountague in his Appello Casarem, which Book though licensed was yet called in
and suppressed by this Bishops procurement: After which he writ another Book
against Popery, Entitled, The pouring out of the 7. Vialls, for which he was
called into the High Commission Court by the Bishop, and the Book suppressed,
That he likewise writ another Book called, Babell no Bethell wherein he proved
the Church of Rome no true visible Church; for which book this Prelate, being
then Bishop of London, sent for him by a Pursevant; committed him immediately
to prison in the Fleet, contrary to the Petition of Right then newly passed,
refusing to accept any bail, which he tendered, suspended him from his living,
prosecuted him in the High Commission, and suppressed the Book.

Michaell Spark Senior, deposed; That himself, together with William Jones,
Nathantell Butter, Mr. Bowler and others were committed to prison and vexed
several times in the High Commission by this Archbishops means, only for
printing Books against the Papists and Arminians, that the Bishop and his
Chaplains refused to License diverse Books against Popery tendered to them,
and purged sundry others of the chief Passages against Popery, (as we shall
prove anon) in so much that the Stationers, and Printers generally complained,
that they could get no good Orthodox Books, but only Popish and Superstitious
ones licensed, so as they were like to be undone for want of trading, and that
this was the general complaint of the whole Company; which other Stationers
likewise affirmed. Particularly, the Bishop though he pretended much friendship
to Sir Humfrey Linde, that learned Knight, the Author of Via Tuta, and Via
Deuia, which were answered by a Jesuit in a scurrilous railing manner; yet he
absolutely refused to license his elaborate Reply thereunto, Entitled, A Case
for the Spectacles, upon no other pretense, but that Sir Humfrey was a Layman;
but in verity, because he was unwilling to have him vindicate himself and the
truth against a railing Jesuit; of which Injustice, Sir Humfrey often complained
to Mr. Pryn, Dr. Featly, and others of his friends: Yet his Chaplain could
license Chunaeus his Collectiones Theologicae, Dedicated to the Archbishop
himself, though compiled by a Layman of much instriot parts and learning to
Sir Humfrey, in justification of Popery, A minianisme and the Church of Rome.

Thirdly, He with his Chaplains Agents, by his instigation or command,
compiled Authorized, imprinted, published diverse Books, Treatises, Sermons in
defense of Popish Errors, Superstitious, Ceremonies, practices, almost to the
total corruption and subversion of our Religion; Of which we shall give you a
brief Catalogue and then proceed to the Popish Passages, errors broached,
justified, authorized in, and propagated by them.

Before we proceed any further in this subject, we must acquaint Your
Lordships with one memorable Passage concerning the Licencing and printing of
Francis Sales his Introduction to a devout life; and Christ's Epistle to a
devout Soul.

The first of these Books being written by a Popish Prelate, having many
Doctrinall and Practical points of Popery interlarded with good meditations
and Devotions comprised in it was translated into English by J. Y. (a Priest,
and Jesuit) dedicated by him to Mistres Anne Roper a Popish Recusant: and
twice printed by Papists in foreign parts, in the years 1617. and 1622. with
all the Popery in it: about which time it was likewise translated into English
by a Protestant, who lest out all the Popery and superstition couched therein,
reteining only what was Orthodox and Pious; which was licenced for the Press,
and printed by Nicholas Oaks. On the 3. of February 1636. Doctor Hayward the
Archbishops Chaplain, at the instigation of some Popish persons, licensed the
very Popish Translation of this Book by (I Y) the Jesuit, for the Press,
(most likely by the Archbishops approbation, who had one of these Books
formerly printed in his Study produced by Master Prynne, endorsed with his own
hand:) which was forthwith entered in Stationers Hall for one W. Brooks a
Popish Stationer, and presently sent to the Press to be printed: One part of
it coming to Nicholas Oaks his House to be printed, he perceiving diverse
dangerous Popish Passages in it, and among others, one touching the Popes
supremacy, repaired to Doctor Hayward who licensed it, and acquainted him
therewith, desiring him to purg out these Popish Passages, else he durst not
proceed to print it. Whereupon the Doctor checking him for making such a
scruple, bid him go on and say nothing, and he would bear him out, and save
him harmless NOTE.
from any danger that might befall him for printing it; adding that he himself
would preach as much [as that he complained off] before the King, and therefore
he needed not fear to proceed: Whereupon Oaks went on, and the Book (with the
Epistle Dedicatory to Mrs. Anne Roper a Papist) was printed and published about
Easter. 1637. near the time the Archbishop caused an Information to be
Exhibited in Star Chamber by Sir John Banks his Majesty's Attorney General,
against D. Bastwick, Mr. Burton and Mr. Prynne, one of the Copies whereof
coming to Mr. Pryns hands he finding it full of Popery, superstition, and the
very same with the old English Popish Edition, and being informed by Oaks and
others, of Dr. Haywards words to Oaks when he complained to him of it, he
inserted the Licensing and printing of this Popish Book among others, into his
Cross Bill in Star Chamber, against the Archbishop, his Chaplains and
others his Popish Confederates; which Bill he tendering to the Lord KEEPER
Coventry to admit, the Archbishop getting possession of it, upon view thereof
and some complaints at Court against this Popish Book, by the Right honorable
Earl of Pembrook, and other well-affected Courteours; thereupon to color his
own and his Chaplains practical knavery, in Licensing and promoting this
Book, by laying all the blame and punishment upon others, and the poor Printer
Ooaks, (who complained against it, and would have stopped it at the Press) and
to give some show of satisfaction to the people much offended at the printing of
this Popish Book, especially in that nick of time, when he had brought Dr.
Bastwick Mr. Burton, and Mr. Pryn into the Star Chamber for charging him with
introducing Popish Doctrines and Innovations into our Church; caused his
Majesty to publish this following Proclamation, for calling in and burning the
said book; wherein he falsely suggested to his Majesty, and his Subjects; that
his Chaplain purged out diverse Passages therein tending to Popery, which the
Stationer and Translater afterward inserted again, when as there was no such
thing: but his Chaplain licensed all of them at first, and would not purge
them out at last; when Oaks complained of them; The Proclamation was this.

By the King. A Proclamation for calling in a Book, entitled, An Introduction
to a Devout life, and that the same be publicly burnt.
Whereas a Book, entitled, AN INTRODVCTION TO A DEVOVT LIFE, was lately
printed by Nicholas Oaks of London., and many of them published and dispersed
throughout the Realm, the Copy of which Book being brought to the Chaplain
of the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury for License and allowance, was by him,
upon diligens perusal, in sundry places expunged and purged of diverse passages
therein tending to Popery: Nevertheless the same Book after it was so amended
and allowed to be printed, was corrupted and falsified by the Translater and
Stationer, who between them inserted again the same Popish and unsound
passages: And the Stationer is now apprehended, and the Translator sought for
to be proceeded against according to Justice.

His Majesty, out of His pious and constant care, to uphold and maintain the
Religion prefessed in the Church of England in its purity, without Error or
Corruption, Does therefore hereby declare His Royal Will and pleasure to be,
and does straightly Charge and Command all persons, of what degree, quality, or
condition soever, to whose hands any of the said Books are, or shall come,
that without delay they deliver or send them to the Bishop, or Chancellor of
the Diocese, whom His Majesty requires to cause the same to be publikly
burnt, (as such of them as have been already seized on, have been by His
Majesty's express Command) And to this His Majesty's Royal Pleasure, he
requires all his loving Subjects to yield all do Conformity and Obedience, as
they will avoid the censure of high Contempt.

God save the KING.
Given at Our Court at White Hall, the fourteenth year of Our Reign.
Upon this Proclamation, some few of these Books were seized, and publicly
burnt in Smithfield; the poor Printer Oaks imprisoned diverse Months almost
to his utter undoing, though he proved, he complained of it to Doctor Haywood
who commanded him to proceed: but the Stationer was brought Ore tenus to the
Star Chamber, and charged with the insertion of the Popish Passages after the
Doctor had expunged them, which he denied; where the Archbishop made a Speech
to clear himself and his Chaplain, in which there was not one word of truth;
after which the Stationer was ordered to be committed to Prison, and to find
out the Translator, which he affirming he could not do if he were imprisoned,
thereupon his imprisonment was respited, and no further examination had of this
foul business, then to clear the Archbishop and his Chaplain by this
devise: in the mean time Mr. Prynnes Cross Bill, which truly related all the
carriage of the business, was suppressed, that so the truth of it (which he
thou could and would have manifested by sundry punctual witnesses had he been
permitted) might never come to public knowledge to the Archbishops and his
Chaplains shame, who abused his Majesty and the People with false
representations of this business: which was now charged, proved and testified
against him at the Bar by Mr. Prynne, Mistress Oaks, Michaell Spark
Senior, and others to his shame.

The Epistle to a devout Soul, written by a John* Lanspergius a Carthu sign.
Friar and then newly translated into English, was licenced, the self same day
for the same Stationer, that Sales book was, being as full of Popery as it;
which Mr. Prynne likewise charging in his Cross Bill; thereupon some of the
Books were seized by the Stationers and the rest vented in private. But Sales,
to make the Papists ammends, was soon after reprinted here withal the Popery
in it, and sold publicly without restraint, notwithstanding his Majesty's
Proclamation, which was but a mere Page^^^, and devise of the Archbishops, to
clear himself and his Chaplain.

Having thus given you a summary Catalogue of the Popish Books, Sermons
licenced and published by him, his Chaplains and Agents, we shall next present
you A Catalogue of Popish Doctrines, Positions, Errors, licensed and Printed,
by the Archbishops and his Chaplaince means.
with a List or Extract of the several Popish Errors, Doctrines, Positions,
Paradoxes authorized and maintained in them, most of them so gross, so
execrable, that they never durst appear in any of our Impressions from the
infancy of Reformation, till this Arch-Prelate became their Patriot. We shall
begin with Auricular Confession, and the power of Priests to remit sins, the
sum whereof is this.

1. That Priests have not only a Ministerial, but an Authoritative and
Juditiall Power to r^mit sine confessed; And that we ought frequently, to
confess our sins to our Priests and Confessors, at least once every Month,
especially in Lent.
We read in the Popes Nuntio, compiled by the Venetian Ambassador (concerning
the Negotiation of Signior Panzanioes p. 12.) That an English Doctor told
Panzanioes friend, that the King did approve of Auricular Confession, was
willing to introduce it: and would use force to make it received, were it not
for fear of Sedition amongst the people. Certainly all who shall read these
ensuing authorized passages touching Auricular confession of Sins to Priests,
Confessors, and of Priests not only Ministerial, but Iuditiall Power to remit
sins; will undoubtedly believe, that at least our Popish Priests, Prelates,
and this Archbishop in particular, had a plotted resolution, to introduce
Auricular confession, and set up an Authoritative Iuditiall power in Priests to
receive confessions and remit sins confessed in all his Majesty's Dominions.
The Passages to this purpose are these.

Mountagues Gagge, p. 78. 83. 84. It is confessed, that all Priests, and none
but Priests have power to forgive sins. It is confessed, that private
confession unto a Priest is of very ancient practice in the Church, we urge it
and persuade it in extremis ut supra: we require it in case of perplexity, and
likewise before the receiving of NOTE.
the Lords Supper, according to which Doctrine and Injunction our Bishops do,
or should enquire of it in their Visitations, touching the use and neglect of
this so good an order.

Which he thus seconds in his Appeal: p. 299. My words are, It is confessed
that private confession unto a Priest is of very Ancient practice in the
Church, of excellent use and benefit being discrectly handled. We refuse it to
none if men require it, if need be to have it, we urge and persuade it in
extremis. We require it in case of perplexity, for the quieting of men
disturbed in their consciences; This is my Popery per parts, for wariant
whereof I bring my witness and authority, the Injunction, direction and
practice of the Church, and of the Bishops accordingly in the Church, that
which their Mother holy Church, has commanded in that sort, and case to be
observed, page 312. Priests have power not only to pronounce, but to give
remission of sins, which seems to be the Doctrine of the Communion Book in
the Visitation of the sick where the Priest says, And by his Authority
committed unto me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, It is Justifiable, it is
the Doctrine and practice of the Church of England.

Page 315. 316. (Informers) it is confessed that all Priests and none but
Priests, have power to forgive sins. And is it not so confessed, when by
public warrant in ordination that power is given unto all Priests to do so
in those solemn words of Ordination, whose sins you forgive, they are
forgiven, etc. But with you Puritans, this Doctrine and practice of the Church
is held to be Popery. And here you infer, that Priests have no more power to
do this than Laymen, here you cast confession upon both one and other; and
Laymen may hear it as well as a Priest, and therefore it is probable, you will
not be very precise for Absolution to confer it on a Layman as well as on a
Priest, But such absolution is a part of that Priestly power which could not be
given by men or Angels, but only and immediately by Almighty God himself; a
part of that Paramount power which the God of Glory has invested mortal men
withal, in which respect it has been said and not otherwise, the head of the
Emperor has been subjected to the Priests hands. Priests only have this
Commission from Christ unto whom he said, As my father sent me, so send I you,
and receive you the Holy Ghost; whose sins you remit, they are remitted. And
in his Originum Ecclesiasticarum, Tomi prioris, Pars posterior, p. 464. to 470.
Printed at London. 640. he largely asserts, Sacerdotes remittunt peccata:
quomodo? Non annunciative tantum, aut optative, SED AVTHORITATIVE, as he
briefly expresses himself in his Index thereunto.

This Popish Doctrine of his, with some additions, touching confession of sins
to Priests and their power to remit them, was publikly justified by M. Sparow,
in a Sermon preached by him in St. Mary's church in Cambridg, for which he
being questioned by the Vice-Chanceller, Posted up to London, to the Archbishop
and his Chaplains for sanctuary, and procuring his Sermon to be there
forthwith Licensed and printed, he hereupon turned in triumph to Cambridge, to
the great grief and discouragement of the Protestant, but extraordinary
encouragement of the Popish party there: In which Sermon of his touching
Confession, we find these Popish passages.

Page. 10. Our Confession must be integra and perfecta, not by half, All our
sins must be confessed, omnia venialia, omnia mortalia, page 14. 15. Thus have
we seen the NOTE.
nature of Confession, and by that learn how to confess, sed ubi Confessarius?
where is a Confessor all this while? where is any to take our Confessions? here
is none in the Text to confess to, if we had a mind to it: None indeed
expressly named, but here is one plainly enough described: here is one that
can pardon our sins, would you know who this he is: I even I says God, am he
who blotteth out all your iniquities, to him even to him let us confess: be
sure this is necessary, and no pardon to be hoped for, unles we confess to him
at least; But there is another Confessor that would not be neglected, Qui
confiteri vult ut inveniat gratiam, quaerat Sacerdotem says St. Augustine: He
that would be sure of pardon, let him seek out a Priest, and make his humble
confession to him: for God who alone has the prime and original right of
forgiving sins has delegated the Priests his Judges here on earth, and given
them the power of absolution, so that they can in his name forgive the Sins
of those that humbly confess unto them, but is not this blaspemy, said the
Scribes once; is it not Popery say some with us now? Take the Council that is
given in Job: cap. 8. v. 8. enquier of the former Generations, ask the Fathers
and they shall tell thee, Heaven waits and expects the Priests sentence here
on earth, for the Priest sits Judge on earth, the Lord follows the servant,
and what the servant binds or loses here on earth, clave non errante, that
the Lord confirms in Heaven: Words so clear for the Juditiary formal
absolution, of the Priest, as nothing can be said more plain. Please you next
to enquire of Saint Jerome, who is said to be the Patron of that opinion, that
holds the Priests power barely declarative, and so indeed none at all, yet he
speaks home in his Epistle ad Heliodorum, etc. page 16. Hear what St. Gregory
the great says. The Apostles and in them all Priests were made Gods
vicegerents on earth, in his name to retain and forgive sins, not
declaratively only but juditially; Animarum Iudices fiunt, as he goes on, they
are made the judges of the Souls of men, casting the obstinate down to the
gates of Hell, by the fearful power of Excommunication, and lifting the
penitent into Heaven by the blessed power of absolution, whatsoever sins ye
remit, etc. here is plainly a power of remitting sins not by preaching, as some
expound it, nor by Baptizing as others guess, etc. page 18. Confess also to
the Priest, if not in private in the eat, since that is out of use; male
aboletur, says a devout Bishop, it is almost quite lost, the more the pity:
yet however, confess as the Church appointed, publicly etc. NOTE.


Doctor Pocklington (who among other Popish Errors which he maintained long
since in Cambridge, justified, Auricular Confession to Priests) has diverse
short passages tending to the same effect in his late published Popish
scandalous book entitled, Altar Christianum, (set forth by the Archbishops
Command and licenced by Dr. Bray his househould Chaplain) page 24. To the
Chancell belonged the Vestry, Lavatory, Repository; and Relcinatories for
hearing of Confessions. How prone those who confessed their sins to Priests
were to receive absolution from them, he thus expresses in the same Book
page 143. Their Penitents used adgeniculari, to fall down upon their knees;
taking absolution before the Altars.

Old doting Shelford, who in the Title of his Treatises (which he presented to
the Archbishop) styles himself a Priest, to make himself more fit to say
Mass and hear Confession, writes thus page 71. 119. Then they confessed
their sins to God and their Minister; for spiritual comfort and Council. etc.
Confession and absolution is flat Popery with such, and all is superstition
save a Sermon from the spirit, etc.

Christopher Dow a great favorite of the Archbishops; in his late Authorized
book against Mr. Burton, entitled. Innovations unjustly charged, determines
thus: Page 55.

To advise and urge the use and profit of private Confession to the Priest, is
no Popish Innovation, but agreeable to the Constant, and resolved Doctrine of
this Church. And if any shall call it Auricular, because it is done in private,
and in the ear of the Priest, I know not why he should therefore be condemned
of Popery.

But this Doctrinall Popery is more clearly and fully expressed in a Book
written in Latin by John Lanspergius, a Carthusian Friar, translated into
English, Licensed for the Press, by Dr. Baker and printed at London for Will.
Brooks, 1637. entitled, Christ's Epistle to a Devoute soul, p. 237. Thou shall
do well every month, (once at least) to confess thy sins Sacramentally, and to
receive the Sacrament of my blessed body, and this thou may do also upon
special festival days, as upon the feast of my Resurrection, at Penticost
also, and at the Assumption of my blessed Mother; and at the joyful Feast of
all my Saints, etc.

P. 246. Promise thy Obedience herein to thy Confessor, or to some other man,
that fears me, etc. Page 251. Thou must confess thy sins often to an
approved Confessor.

Page 252. Say some devoute prayer, or do some greater penance, as thou and
thy spiritual Director shall think fit, etc.

This was seconded by another Book licensed by Doctor Haywood the Archbishops
Popish Chaplain, the self same day that Christ's Epistle was, by Doctor Baker,
and for the same party (Books) compiled by a Popish Bishop of Geneva, called
Francis Sales, translated into English by a Jesuit, and entitled, An
Introduction to a devout life, where thus we read.

them hereafter.

Page 215. We must then confess the particular fact, the motive and
continuance of our sins.

the quality of thine offense, as the cause, subject or occasion.

Page 218. Change not lightly or easily thy Confessor, but having made choice
of a sufficient one, continue constantly rendering him account of thy Conscience
on the days and times appointed, opening to him freely and plainly the sins

months: tell him likewise of the State of thy Inclinations though thou have
not sinned by them, whether thou be given to overmuch mirth, or desirous of
gain, or such like inclinations.

Here we have Confession and Confessors served up to the highest pitch of
Popery by Popish Authors, printed in Land. with public Authority by the
Archbishops and his Chaplains special License.

We shall conclude with Dr. Cosons Devotions, Entitled the Hours of Prayer:
printed at London 1627. The precepts of the Church: Fifth to receive the
blessed Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, with frequent Devotion, and
three times a year at least of which times Easter, to be always one. And for
better preparation thereunto, as occasion is, to disburden and quiet our
Consciences of those sins that may grieve us, or scruples, that may trouble
us, to a Learned and discreet Priest and from him to receive advice, and the
benefit of absolution. And Page 25. A devout manner of preparing our selves to
receive Absolution.

How stiffly this Doctrine of Auricular Confession and Priests power of
absolution, was maintained, not only in print and Pulpit, but in private
Conferences by the Archbishops Creatures, and Heads of Houses in the University
of Cambridge, will appear by this memorable instance. On Sunday the 25. of
June 1637. one Master Adams preaching publicly in Saint Mary's Church in
Cambridge before the University Master Adams Case.
on John 20. 23. Whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted, etc. used these
exorbitant Popish assertions touching Confession of sins to Priests. That a
special Confession unto a Priest (actually where time or opportunity presents
it self, or otherwise in explicit intention, and resolution) of all our
sins committed after Baptism, so far forth as we do remember, is
necessary unto salvation, in the judgment of Fathers, Schoolmen, and almost all
Antiquity, not only Necessitate pracepti, but also necessitate medij, so that
according to the ordinary, or revealed means appointed by Christ, there can be
no salvation without the aforesaid Confession. That Christ intended this
Confession of our sins in special before the Priest, for a necessary mean
to bring us to salvation; and to frustrate his intention or will though
misconceits, what were it but an argument no less of indiscretion, then of
madness and impiety? That God being an Enemy to all sin, will not pardon
any, if we willingly conceal but one in our Confession to the Priest. That
Confession is as necessary to salvation, as the Ministry of Baptism; as
necessary to salvation as meat is to the Body. That since Christ ordained a
Tribunal seat of Judgment, where sins should be remitted or retained at the
discretion of a lawful Minister, (as was evident by the Text he did) then
WITHOUT DOUBT, it was his intention that the faithful should necessarily
confess all their sins before the Priest, so far forth as they remember, for
the purchasing of his pardon and remission. This he averred to be (as he
conceived) the Doctrine of the Church of England contained in our Lyturgie.
That Confession is a duty of far more antiquity and extent then ever Popery
was, in regard it was instituted by our Savior, practiced by the Apostles, the
Holy Fathers and all succeeding Ages; and therefore though the Papists use it,
it is not, it cannot be, as some would have it, A point of Popery. What, shall
their Errors in some Tenets prejudice the Truth in this? What shall we refuse
the Grape because the stalk is withered? This were a Puritanicall, a Novatian
nicity. I never heard of any thing but a foolish Cock that ever refused a
Gemme, though in a Dunghill: and surely those that reject so special a means
of their salvation, as Confession is, merely because it is practiced by the
Papists, may not unfit, but very properly be said to wear his badge. The whole
Sermon was to this effect. Dr. Ward, Doctor Love, Dr. Brownrig, and Doctor
Holdsworth, took exceptions against this Sermon, as scandalous and Popish;
Whereupon Master Adams was convented for it before the Vice Chancellor and
Heads, who both required and perused the Copy of his Sermon: which done, the
Vice Chancellor, Doctor Brownrig, drew up this ensuing Recantation, which he
enjoined him to make in public, to give satisfaction to those his Sermon had
scandalized.

Whereas, etc. On Sunday the 25. of June last, in my public Sermon on these
words (St. John 20. 23. whose sins ye remit, they are remitted, and whose sins
ye retain they are retained;) I delivered this doctrine, That a special
Confession unto a Priest (actually, where time or opportunity presents it
self, or otherwise in explicit intention and resolution) of all our sins
committed after Baptism, so far forth, as we do remember, is necessary unto
salvation, not only necessitate praecepti, but also necessitate medii; so that
according to the Ordinance, or revealed means appointed by Christ, there can
be no salvation without the aforesaid Confession; upon more mature thoughts,
and better information, I do find that this Doctrine then delivered, was both
erroneous, and dangerous, having not warrant from the Word of God, and crossing
the doctrine of our Church, as may appear by her Lyturgie in the second
exhortation at the Communion, and in the Visitation of the sick, and in the
second part in the Homily of Repentance: As therefore in general, I do
acknowledge in the words of the aforesaid Homily, that it is most evident, and
plain, that this Auricular Confession has not his warrant of Gods Word, and
that therefore being not led with the conscience thereof, if we with fear and
trembling, and with a true contrite heart, use that kind of confession, which
God does command in his word, (namely an unfeighned confession unto Almighty
God himself) then doubtless (as he is faithful and true) he will forgive us
our sins, and make us clean from all our wickedness, so in the case of a
troubled, or doubtful conscience, I do conform my opinion unto the direction
of our Church, which in her Liturgy does exhort, and require those whose
Consciences are troubled with any weighty matter to a special confession, so
that they who cannot quiet their own Consciences, are to repair to their
own, or some other discreet and learned Minister of Gods word, to open to them
their grief, that so they may receive such ghostly Counsel, advise and
comsort, as their consciences may be relieved, and by the ministry of Gods
word, they may receive comfort, and the benefit of absolution, to the quieting
of their Conscience, and the avoiding of all scruple and doubtfullnesse. But it
is against true Christian liberty, that any man should be bound to the numbering
of his Sins, as it has been used heretofore in times of Ignorance and
blindness: This I do acknowledge to be the Doctrine of the Church of England
concerning Confession, and to it I do ex animo, subscribe, and am heartily sorry
for what ever I have de-livered to the contrary.

Mr. Adams being backedby the Popish Heads refused to make this Recantation,
though just and fair; professing he was not conscious to himself of any thing
he had said in his Sermon contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of England:
Whereupon at a full meeting of the Doctors, it was put to the Vote, Whether
this Recantation should be enjoined him or no? Dr. Ward, Dr. Bambridge, Dr.
Bacheroft, Dr. Love, Dr. Holdsworth: and the Vicechancellor, voted, he should
make this Recantation, but Dr. Collins, Dr. Smith, Dr. Cumber, Dr. Cousin, Dr.
Lany, Dr. Martin, Dr. Stern, and Dr. EDEN Voted, that he should not make it,
justifying even the use and necessity of Confession, to a Priest, necessitate
medij, to obtain absolution; and affirming, that they would not Vote, Master
Adams had delivered any thing contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of
England, in this point of Confession; and thereupon acquitted him: But the
Vice Chancellor adjourning the business till another day, when 12. Doctors
only were present, and Dr. Smith, Dr. Cumber, Dr. Martin, and Dr. Eden (who
formerly acquitted him) absent, by the help of Dr. Paske his voice, with much
opposition, voted that Mr. Adams should make the forementioned Recantation; to
which he and those who Voted with him subscribed their hands; Dr. Cousin, Dr.
Lany, Dr. Beale, Dr. Stern, and one more, subscribed likewise their dissents
thereunto. When this was done all was done, and Mr. Adams without making any
submission or Recantation at all, was dismissed, and so encouraged, that he
resolved to maintain this his opinion in his Act questions. The whole
proceedings in this business together with the Copy of Mr. Adams his Sermon,
and the Recantation NOTE.
forementioned, were sent up to London by Dr. Cousin, and found by Mr. Prynne in
the Archbishops Study, endorsed with his own hand thus, Received Match 16.
1637. Doctor Cosins his Letter about the proceedings of Brownrig Vicechancellor
of Cambridge against Mr. Adams for his Sermon about Confession, January 25.
1637. etc. Who instead of censuring, concurred with Dr. Cosins, and the other
Popish Doctors in protecting and justifying Mr. Adams in his gross Popish
Doctrines of Auricular Confession and Absolution, which he endeavored with all
his might to introduce. And no wonder, for in his own Diary, he writ this
memorial with his own hand. June 15. 1622 I became CONFESSOR to the Lord of
Buckingham, and June 16. being Trinity Sunday, he received the Sacrament at
Greenwitch. And all Courtiers know, that he was since for many years, not
only a privy Councellor, but Confessor to his Majesty; at least Commonly so
reputed; which made him so earnest to bring all others under the yoke of
Confession, since he had brought these Grandees under it, Yea so far had this
Popish Tenet of the necessity, of Confession and absolution by Priests,
prevailed among us by these authorized Books and Sermons generally preached
for them; that Bishop Mountague in his Printed Visitation Articles for the
Diocese of Norwich, Anno 1638. made it a crime presentable in Ministers, not
to press the Doctrine and practice of it upon the people, at leastwise in the
holy time of Lent; as appears by this memorable Article of his.

Tit. 7. Artic. 4. Does the Minister especially exhort the Parishoners TO MAKE
CONFESSJON OF THEIR SINS TO HIMSELF, or some other learned grave and
discreet Minister, ESPECIALLY IN LENT, against the holy time of NOTE.
Easter, that they may receive comfort and ABSOLVTION, so to become worthy
receivers of such holy mysteries?

How far the Archbishops Agents and Emissaries urged, exercised Popish
Auricular Confession, not only in England, but Jreland too, we shall instance
but in one memorable example. The Archbishop in his Paper of Remembrances to
the Lord Deputy of Ireland, when he first went over thither, (a Copy whereof
Master Prynne met with in his Study) made this special request to him, in
behalf of one Mr. Croxton, a young Minister and Creature of his: I heartily
pray your Lordship to take notice of one Mr. Croxton, whom J send over with
your letters to my Lord Mount Norris. I hope he will prove so honest and so
able a man, as may do good service in those parts, if God bless him with life,
And I doubt not but as it shall fall in your way, Your Lordship will bestow
some preferment upon him, for his maintenance, for which I shall thank you.
This Croxton arriving in Ireland, the Lord Deputy upon this recommendation of
the Archbishop, received him with all due respect, and promoted him to several
Ecclesiastical preferments there, as appears by his Letters of thanks to the
Archbishop; wherein he gives him the Popes Titles (Holiness, and most holy
Father) as if he were a Pope: This Croxton being thus advanced, to promote the
Archbishops designs, at Easter, in the Year, 1638. caused all his
Parishioners to come up to the High-Altar at Goran, where he was Incumbent,
and there Sacramentally to make their Confessions to him; which the Protestants
in those parts deemed a most strange and scandalous act, declaming much against
it: Yet this audacious Popel in knowing how acceptable this Popish Innovation
was to the Archbishop, the more to ingratiate himself in his favor in a
vaunting manner, certified His Grace by a special Letter of all his
proceedings herein, wherein he thanks God, for enabling him in some good
measure, to effect that there, which other able men had only sufficiently
spoken of (but not accomplished) elsewhere: and likewise boasts of his solitary
opposition of the Archbishop of Armagh, and the whole Convocation at Dublin, in
the points of Election and Gods Decree, when the Articles of Ireland were in a
violent manner suppressed, and called in by his Graces procurement; making the
sign of the Cross in the frontispeece of his Letter as the Popish Priests and
Jesuits use to do in all their Letters one to another: Which Letter (sound in
this Archbishops Study at Lambeth, and attested by Master Prynne,) was openly
read at the Lords Bar in form ensuing.

My LORD.
IN humblest manner I beg your gracious acceptance of this just as necessary
duty; whillst I make an unquestionable relation of that which so nearely
concerns my self. To provide the best J could for the more worthy receiving
of the holy Communion this last Easter, J have (I thank God for it) been able
in some measure, to NOTE
do that here which able men have sufficiently spoken of elsewhere, I have
Sacramentally heard the Confessions of the people Committed to my Charge in
Goran, (a certain through-fare town in the County of Kilkenye, in the
Chancell, they kneeling before the Altar.

This is every where now counted a most strange Act, without all warrant: says
bold ignorance, there is no president for it; says the Divill, Envy, and
double blinded malice, it is as void of Law as full of singularity, So unbidden,
so unled did I once protest against that horrible decree obtruded (as it was
received from Calvine) by the Archbishop of Armagh, and the whole body of this
Kingdoms Clergy then Assembled in the Convocation at Dubline, that I stood
then alone, that no man then stood by me, when I made that Protestation; I
appeal to the not yet forgotten so eloquent, so godly, so very leaud, railing,
cursing Censure upon that occasion publicly delivered, by one that was then
called Chancelllor Sing, since Deane of Drummore, the Lord Bishop of Derrie and
Master of the Rolls were not many hours ignorant of the very words by the then
Chancellor and now Deane, then and there uttered.

The luckie opportunity of a trusty Messenger, a servant to the Earl of
Ormond and Chirurgian to his Troop, by name Michaell Oxenbridge, with the just
conscience of my duty on this behalf, emboldens me thus humbly to pray for
such acceptance in a Cause most acceptable, as may yet make the person of the
poor receiver, NOTE.
more worthy to be accepted.

Goran, April 18. 1638. Your Graces most devoted. James Croxton.
To the most Reverend Father in God, William by the Divine providence, Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Primate and Metropolitan of all England.

This Letter was thus endorsed with the Archbishops own hand: Received July 6.
1638. Mr. Croxton his receiving of Confession.

BY which it is most apparent, that the introducing of Auricular Confession was
a special design of the Archbishops, prosecuted by his Emissaries and
Creatures in all places; who gave him exact accounts of their proceedings
herein, the more to endeare themselves in his favor. To what end these
Doctrines and practices of Auricular Confession and Priests absolution were
thus urged, Master William Tyndall, in his Practice of Popish Prelates, and
Obedience of a Christian man, (with other Protestant VVriters) will inform us,
to wit; to enslave the Laity to the Clergy; to advance the Priest above the
King, the Myter above the Scepter; the Ecclesiastical Tribunal above the
Secular; to fish out all men's secrets, to awe and keep them under bondage, and
accomplish all their own designs upon them with more facility, as they do in
Popish Kingdoms, where such Confessions and Absolutions are in use. Having
thus done with this Arch-Priests Masterpiece, Confession, and the power of
Priests to remit sins confessed, we shall proceed to that which depends upon
it, and must have necessarily followed on it, to the great oppression of the
ignorant seduced people; that is,

2. The use of Popish Penances, as wearing of haire-cloth, and such like
corporal punishments enjoined by Priests for sins Confessed, NOTE.
with intention to satisfy God thereby for the sins confessed; lately
pressed, as lawful, profitable, commendable.
THe use and lawfulness hereof (never heard of nor maintained in our Church
since Reformation till this Archbishops Domination) is thus pressed, justified,
commended in these ensuing authorized books.

Christ's Epistls to a Devout soul, page 252. Enjoyne thy self for thy
Penance to say some devout prayer, or to do some greater Penance, as thou
and thy spiritual Director shall think fit.

Franeis Sales his Introduction to a Devout Life, page 131. Recompense (this
loss) at least by multiplying Jaculatory prayers, and by reading some books of
Devotion with some voluntary Penance or other, for committing this fault.

Page 209. The sovereign balsome of Confession or penance.

Page 428. Disciplying the body likewise has a mavelous efficacy to stir up
in us desire of devotion, when it is moderately used: Haire-Cloath tameth the
flesh very much: upon the principal days of penance, one may well use it
with the advice of a discreet Confessor.

Dr. Pocklingtons Altar Christianum, p. 42. writes thus, The first Room is
called the Church Porch where penitents used to stand, or rather to cast
themselves down, and in humble manner to desire the faithful to pray for them
as they went NOTE.
into the Church: after Delinquents had perfectly fulfilled their penance, they
were reconciled to the Sacraments, and communicated: This distinction of places
in the Church is very ancient and observed even from the Apostles times.

Page 44. This man after penance done for this fault was admitted into the
Church again.

Page 52. Cap. 10. Of days of penance and absolution, Citizens penance.

P. 54. None that had fallen into any notorious crime were admitted again into
the Church before they had done open penance in Sackcloth and Ashes: Cerdon
was not received into the Church before he had performed his penance:
Exomologesin faciens.

Page 55. In what sort penitents performed their penance and made Confession,
the Act it self will discover.

This Exomologesis gives law both to our food and raiment, sacco and cinere
incubare; and orders men to lie in Sackcloth and Ashes to humble your selves
before the Priest, and to fall down upon the knees before Gods Altars, to sue
unto all Brethren for their prayers in their behalf, Haec omnia exomologesis:
penance works all this.

P. 56. Feeling nothing but rough Sackcloth, galling the sides, seeing nothing
but head, hands, face, clothes, covered over with ashes; have nothing to be
seen but a pale face, thin cheeks and a meagre look, and this continued
two, three, sometimes four years together, before perfectionem suam
reciperent.

P. 57. Hereupon the Bishops made an addition to the Ecclesiastcall Canon, that
in every Church a Penitentiary should be appointed to admit penitents into the
Church, after they had done public penance: A solemn day was set a part for
taking of public penance for open faults, by imposition of hands, and
sprinkling of ashes, namely, Ashwednesday, by the Canon of the Council of
Agatha in Gratian, This is the godly Discipline whereof our Church speaks in
the Commination, of putting notorious sinners to open penance in the beginning
of Lent, and wishes that it might be restored again: And as Ashwednesday was
appointed for putting notorious sinners to open penance, so was MAUNDAY
Thursday set a part for their absolutions.

P. 59. The godly discipline constantly practiced in Churches and at Altars and
the sad and malencholly mention of Penance, Fasting and Prayer, with other
Austerities, which the piety of the times have but just cause to think of.

P. 63. This was done 40. days before Easter namely on Ashwednesday in
Sackcloth and Ashes: And for 8. days together before Easter they were to do
penance, to fast, to refrain all manner of pleasures though never so lawful,
to stand bare foot upon Sackcloth, and to watch on Good Friday all night, or
at least till two a Clock in the morning. NOTE


Shelfords five Treatises, Page 71. Then they confessed their sins to God and
their Minister for spiritual comfort and Council, then they endeavored to
make the best temporal satisfaction they could by Alms, Prayer and Fastings,
and other works of humiliation.

The Scots New Service Book in the Commination against sinners, with certain
prayers to be used diverse times in the year, and especially on the first day
of Lent, commonly called Ashwednesday: To which there is this addition in
justification of Popish penance, made with the Archbishops own hand.

Brethren in the Primitive Church, there was a godly discipline used, that at
the beginning of Lent notorious sinners were put to open Penance, and did
humbly submit themselves to undergo punishment in this world, that their
souls might be saved in the day of the Lord.

All which is thus closed up by Bishop Mountague; who after a long discourse in
Justification, of Confession and Penance, concludes thus, out of Pope Leo.

Originum Ecclesiasticarum, Tomi Prioris pars posterior, Londini, 1640. Page
467. Sect. 33. Christus enim (ut cum B. Leone loquar) Ecclesia Prapositis
potestatem dedit, ut and Confitentibus actionem paenitentiae darent, and cosdem
SALUBRI SATISFACTIONE PVRGARENT: and sic ad communionem Sacramentorum, per
januam reconciliationis admitterent.

3. That we ought necessarily to give blind Obedience to the Ecclesiastical
commands and directions of our Priests, Confessors, and spiritual Superiors.
THis desperate Popish Assertion was published and justified in these
Authorized printed passages, worthy our special observation.

Christ's Epistle to a Devout Soul, page 112. 113. 114. 116. Respect not the
man who by my Ordinance is thy superior, whether he be learned or unlearned:
but have regard to this only that he is thy superior, by whom I will govern
thee, and in whom thou ought to obey me; Wherefore I would have thee subject
thy self unto him without any servile fear, or scruple of thy Conscience, and
dispraising thine own wisdom and Council submit thy self to be governd by
his judgment, and opinion whatsoever he shall determine or appoint thee. Walk
in the path of Obedience, and do nothing at all without the Counsel of thy
Pastor, or Ghostly Father, or Superior, esteeming that always best which thy
Superior shall think fittest, do all things according to the council of thy
Superior, and submit thy self wholly to his will and discretion: And Page 192.
my inspirations never disagree from the Obedience that thou must carry to thy
superiors: therefore if thou submittest thy self to them, and reliest in no
respect upon thy own self, thou art sure to walk in simplicity and purity of
heart.

Francis Sales his Introduction to a Devout Life, page 334. 335. Obedience,
Charity, and Poverty, are three excellent justruments unto perfection: There
are two sorts of Obedience, the one necessary, the other voluntary, by
necessary obedience, thou must obey thy Ecclesiastical Superiors, as the
supreme head, etc.

Which is thus seconded by Christopher Dow, in his Book against Master Burton
page 136. 137. Secondly, I say, that being done by the same Authority that
first set them forth, it is neither for him, nor me, nor any other of inferior
rank to question them, but with humble Reverence to submit to their
judgments, and to think them wiser and far more fit to order those things
that belong to their places, than we, whom neither it concerns, nor indeed
can know the reasons that move them either to do or alter any thing, etc.

With whom Doctor Heylyn in his Coal from the Altar, p. 2. Thus complyes in
judgment; Should we all be so affected as to demurre on the commands of our
Superior in matters of exterior Order and Public Government, till we are
satisfied in the grounds and reasons of their commandments, or should we fly
off from our duty at sight of every new devise that is offered to us, we should
find a speedy dissolution in Church and State.

Which Doctor Pocklington thus closes in his Altar Christianum, page 180.
What floodgates this man sets wide open to let in a whole deluge of
confusions, impiety, and Sacrilege into the Church, if the Contents of his
Letter in this particular might obtain, viz. That the Constitutions, Orders,
Decrees appointed by Cannon or renewed by TRADITION of holy Church, be not of
absolute authority and require full obedience, but are to be scanned and
disputed.

4. That Christians here must have Altars; that these ought to be rayled in
Altarwise, at the East end of the Chancell, and there bowed to and toward as
to Gods mercy seat, and the place of Christ's chief real presence upon earth,
and that there can be no true Sacrament or Consecration of it where there is no
Altar.
THis is the Subject matter of many whole Books lately published, authorized
by the Archbishops Creatures and Chaplains, as Doctor Heylyns Coal from the
Altar; his Antidotum Lincolniense, His Moderate answer to Master Henry Burton,
page 132. to 140. yea a thing expressly enjoined by the Archbishop and others in
the new Statutes for the University of Oxford, in the new Statutes of diverse
Cathedrals, the new Cannons and by diverse Bishops in their Visitation
Articles, already mentioned. We shall therefore insist only on some other
authorized Books and passages to this purpose.

We shall begin with Doctor John Pocklington, his Sunday no Sabbath, printed
by the Archbishops approbation, and his Chaplains license, p. 43. 44. 50.

Habemus Altar, we under the Gospel have an Altar, Heb. 15. 10. and so is the
Word Altar, and Lords Table indifferently and alike anciently used: these were
some Tables or Altars of stone, quia Christus est lapis angularis: some were of
Wood, the better to express his death on the Tree: these wooden Altars or
Tables, the furious Circumceflions brake down in Saint Augustines time: And if
we do not only bend or bow our body to this blessed Board, or holy Altar, but
fall flat on our faces before his Footstool so soon as ever we approach in
sight thereof, what Patriarch, or Apostle would condemn us for it?

Which he thus further prosecutes in his Altar Christianum, page 108. Humble
and lowly Reverence toward the holy and most Sacred Altar, where Christ is
most truly and really present in the blessed Sacrament; page 142. Was not the
Altar set in Sacrario, or Sancto Sanctorum, whereunto the Priest ascended by
certain steps and degrees, and when they did so ascend, were there not Psalms
of degrees sang, called for that cause Gradualls? durst the Priests themselves
ascend thither without doing lowly Reverence three several times? Veneration
toward the Altar was then required and practiced, page 145. Priests in our
Church at the Ordination kneell upon their knees before the holy Altar then is
given imposition of hands before the holy Altar, then the Bishop takes the holy
Gospells from the holy Altar, etc. no Bishop was authorized before his Altar
was consecrated, page 153. To warrant and justify the bringing them in and due
honoring of them because they are the seats and Chairs of estate, where the
Lord vouchsafes to place himself amongst us. Quid est enim Altar nisi seeds
corporis and sanguinis Christi? p. 159. To come home to our Country, when the
Author sees the Kings most Sacred Majesty, and the honorable Lords of the
most Noble order of the Garter perform most low and humble Reverence to
Almighty God before the most holy Altar, the Throne in earth of that great Lord
from whom their honor proceeds, page 160. Deo atque Altari reverentiam
exhibuisse visi sunt. Domino Deo and ejus Altari proni facti debitum
impenderent honorem, Summum Altar in honorem Dei debita genu-flexione
reverentiaque consalutabit, p. 175. Honor and Reverence of right belongs unto
it in regard of the presence of our Savior whose Chair of State it is upon
earth. Nay he proceeds yet further, p. 75.

The Eucharist cannot be received among Heretics, for the Elements must be
consecrated before they become partakers of that Eucharist: this Heretics
could not then do, quia nec Altar nec Ecclesiam, because they had neither
Altar nor Church, for of necessity says St. Cyprian, Eucharistia in Altari
sanctificatur, the Eucharist is consecrated upon the Altar: If then this were
true, which this unadvised man would make the Vicar believe, that there were no
Altars nor Churches within 20. years after Christ, it must needs follow that
the holy Eucharist was not received by any of the holy Martyrs and blessed
Saints of God in all the primitive Church, or else that they did receive some
kind of Sacrament, that was not consecrated, for Eucharistia in Altari
sanctificatur is a ground in which he sets his rest, as the Fathers before him,
and his successors ever did, P. 174. Saint Cyprian tells you, that the use of
Altars is to sanctify the Eucharist upon, and that without an Altar, it cannot
be consecrated, and that therefore Heretics have no Sacraments among them,
because they have no Altars.

Edmond Reeve in his Christian Divinity, contained in the Divine Service of the
Church of England, seconds him in these words p. 132 to 137. Unto the due
honoring of Gods holy name the place where Gods name is put is to be honored
also, now also ought every one being come into Gods House to prostrate
himself, i. e. to make low obeisance toward Gods mercy-seat being in the
uppermost part of the Temple page 133. A great Divine in our Church (Mr. Dr.
Laurence in his most weighty Sermons) thus writes. We are no more Idolatrous
by our prostration toward the Table of the Lord, than the Jews were by theirs
toward the Tabernacle of the Lord or the mercy-seat, page 134 Gods Board is to
be accounted the peculiar seat of God within the Temple, and therefore toward
it unto God, there we are to make low obeisance whenever we come into Gods
House for to pray. Gods board is ever to have due reverence, and God who is
there perpetually, is always to be prostrated unto: Should not Christianity
teach us that no seat of any Person, much less of any of the Layty should be
above Gods mercy-seat, the sacred Communion Table: The sacred Communion Table
is called an Altar, and it is also called Gods mercyseat. Gods Board is ever to
have due Reverence, and God who is there perpetually is always to be
prostrated unto; yea, when as the Body and Blood of Christ in the blessed
Sacrament, is not upon the same.

Robert Shelford Priest in his Five learned and pious discourses, printed at
Cambridge 1635. determines thus, p. 4. To this day all our Churches are called
sanctuaties, as in many other Regards, so especially in regard of the Lords
Table or high Altar at the upper end of them, which is Jesus Christ's mercy
seat, because there the memory of the everlasting sacrifice, is made and
presented to the holy Trinity, page 15. See thou not the Son of Gods seat
here, the holy Altar at the upper end of this House? Page 17. The 5. sort of
Reverence beseeming Gods House, is at the entering in before we take our seats
to bend the Knee, and to bow our Body to him toward the more usual and
special place of his residence or resemblance, which is the high Altar or the
Lords Table, usually standing at the East end of Gods House, Idque propter
Christum qui est Lux Mundi, and Oriens nominatur, Zach. 6. 12. and ab orient
etiam expectatur venturus, page 19. 20. The first reverence that you make,
because the house is Gods and not man's, direct your aspect to Gods Table, which
Saint Paul calls the Lords Altar, saying, We have An altar whereof they have no
right to eat which serve the Tabernacle: this is the great sign of Gods
residence in this holy place, as the Arck was the sign of hs presence in his
Tabernacle: here the great sacrifice of Christ's death for our salvation, is in
Remembrance represented to God the Father: and can we remember so great a
benefit, and not reverence the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost for it? I do not
exhort you to give Divine worship to Gods Table, but to worship God toward it,
for Gods Altar is not terminativum cultus, but motivum only; as Daniel being in
Captivity turned his face toward Jerusalem when he prayed, but prayed not to
it; thus if we come before God in his house with due reverence, then will he
hold out his Golden Scepter of grace to us, as the great King Ahasuerus held
out his to Queen Ester, but if we slight God in his own place, and he hold
out his Iron Scepter to us, then let us be wise and learned.

Let us learn of our Mother Churches, for there our Reverend Fathers the
Prelates and others make their reverence to God on this wise, both at their
entry and return: wherefore to follow their good and holy Pattern, we also are
to do the like both at our first coming into Gods house and at our going out,
etc.

Sundry such Passages are to be found in many other new printed Pamphlets.

These Popish impious Innovations and practices being complained against by Mr.
Burton and others in their Writings; this Archbishop not only justifies them in
private, but in open Court in a premeditated printed Speech, at the censure of
Doctor Bastwick, Mr. Burton, and Mr. Prynu in Star Chamber the 14. of June,
1637. there Number. 26. Moses and ^aron fell upon their sa^^s atthe door ^f the
Tabernacle only for ^^ pray, not ^^ Worship: Er^, we must always bow ^o the
Altar at our approaches ^oit, is no good consequence: out rather, Ergo, we must

sequens.

The Altar stood without the Door of the Tabernacle, and the Laver between it
and the Tent, Exodus 40. 7. 8. 29. 30. Therefore if Moses fell on his face at the
Tabernacle door, his worship was not with his face to, but from the Altar, and
his bowing not toward, but fromwards it, quite cross to your bowing.


most inhumanly censured, only for opposing these and other Popish Innovasions,
In which Speech of his, P. 34. etc. he writes thus.

One thing sticks much in their Stomachs, and they call it an Jnnovation too:
And that is, bowing, or doing Reverence at our first coming in to the Church,
or at our nearer approaches to the holy table, or the ALTAR call it whether you
will) In which they will needs have it, that we worship the Holy Table, or God
knows what. To this I answer, that if to worship God, when we enter into his
House, or approach his Altar, be an Innovation, it is a very Oldone, For This
solemnity and the bowing used in it is only civil, not Religious. 2ly.
Peculiar to the Knights of this Order. Therefore no rule for others in matter
of their worship.
Moses did Reverence at the very Door of the Tabernacle, etc. For my own part,
I take my self bound to Worship with Body, as well as in Soul, when ever I
come where God is worshipped. And were this Kingdom such as would allow no Holy
Table standing in its proper place, (and such places some there are) yet I
would worship God when I came into his House. And were the Times such, as
should beat down Churches, and all the curious carved work thereof, with Axes
and Hammers as in Psalm. 74. (and such times have been) yet would I Worship in
what place soever I came to pray, though there was not so much as a stone laid
for Bethell, but this is the misery, it is Superstition, now adays for any man
to come with more Reverence into a Church than a Tinker and his Bitch come into
an Alehouse: the Comparison is too homely, but my just indignation at the
Profaneness of the times makes me speak it.

And you my Honorable Lords of the Garter, in your greater solemnities you do
your (*) Reverence unto Almighty God, I doubt not; but yet it is versus Altar,
toward his Altar as the This is a mere groundless fall^^i^, God and Christ
being most present in the midst of his peoples hearts and souls not on the
Altar. Mat. 18. 20. c. 28. 20. Ephesians. 4. 17. Gal. 2. 20. 1 Cor. 6. 19. 20.
greatest place of Gods Residence upon earth; I say the greatest, yea greater
then the Pulpit: For, there it is, Hoc est Corpusmenm, this is my Body but in the
Pulpit it is at most but, Hoc est verbum meum, this is my Word, And a Christ's
body is not God: nor his natural body on the Altar: but only the Elements
which represent it Now Christ's word makes the Bread his representative, not
real body, and the word, expresses his Divinity, Ioha 1. 1. the Consecrated
Bread, his Body and humanity only: Therefore our reverence is no doubt more due
to his word than to his body. And so St. Augustine expressly resolves it to be
as due to it HOMIL 26. Jnterrogo vos sratres vel sarores, dicite mib^, quid
vobis plus esse videtur, verbum Dei, an corpus Christi^si verumvultis
respondere, hoc utique dicere debetis, quod non sit minus Verbum, quam corpus
Christi, et ideo quanta solicitudone observamus, quando nobis corpus Christi
ministratur, ut nihil ex ipso de nostris manibus in terram cadat, tanta
solicitudinc observamus, ne verbum Dei quod nobis erogatur, dum aliquid out
cogitamus out loquimur de cord nostro pereat, quia non minus reus erit, qui
Verbum Dei negligente raudierit, quam ille qui corpus Christi in terram cadere
negligentia sua permiserit.
greater Reverence (no doubt) is Not so because not commended. True we agree it.
due to the Body, than to the word of our Lord and so i^ Relation Answerable to
the Throne where his body is usually present, than to the Seat, where his Word
uses to be proclaimed: and God hold it there, at his word, for as too many men
use the matter, it is Hocest verbum Diabolt, this is the word of the Devil, in
too many places. Witness sedition and the like to it. And this Reverence ye
do, when ye enter the Chapel, and when you approach nearer to offer, and this
is no Innovation, for you are bound to it by your order, and that's not new. And
Idolatry it is not to worship God toward his holy Table, for if it had been
Idolatry, I presume Queen Elizabeth and King James would not have practiced
it, no not in those solemnities: and being not Idolatry, but true Divine
worship, you will, I hope give a poor Prjest leave to worship God as your
selves do; for, if it be Gods worship, I ought to do it as well as you, and if
it be Idolatry, * you ought not to do it more then I. I say again, I hope a
You are no such, but a rich Arch-Prelate
poor Priest may worship God with as lowly Reverence as you do, since you are
bound by your Order, and by your Oaths, according to a constitution of Hen.
the 5. (as appears) to give due honor and Reverence This is in the
Copulative, you give one and the same adoration, at the same time both to God
and the Altar in one Act of bowing, without any distinction, Therefore you
adore both alike with one and the same worship, and so give Divine (...) to the
Altar as well as to God, which is Idolatry; or but civil worship to God, not
exceeding that you give
Domino Deo, and Altari ejus, in modum virorum Ecclesiasticorum: that is, to
the Lord your God, and to his Altar, (for there is a Reverence You say but no
ways prove it.
due to that too, though such as comes far short of Divine Worship) and this
in that manner, as Ecclesiastical persons both worship and do reverence: The
story which led in this Decree is this: King Hen: the 5th. that Noble and
Victorius Prince, returning gloriously out of France, sat at this solemnity,
and finding the Knights of the Order scarce bow to God, or but slightly, and
then bow toward him and his seat, startled at it (being a Prince then grown
as Religious as he was before Victorious) and after asking the Reason (for till
then the Knights of the Order never bowed toward the King or his Seat) the
Duke of Bedford Answered, it was settled by a Chapter Act three years before:
hereupon the great King replied, No, I Will none of this, till you the Knights do
it, satis been, welenough, and with due performance to Almighty God. And
hereupon the forenamed Act, proceeded, that they should do this duty to
Almighty God, not slightly, but ad modum virorum Ecclesiasticorum, as low, as
well, as decently as Popish Monks and Friars adoring the hostia and Altar in
those blind times, were clearly both the ground and Pattern of this
Altar-adoration, which this Arch-pre late would obtrude on us in these days of
the Gospel. But theirs was Idolatrous, superstitious, Popish. Therefore this
is such.
Clergymen use to do it.

Now if you will turn this off and say, it was the superstition of that age so
to do, Reply to Hardings Answer, Art. 3. Diu. 29.
Bishop Jewel will come in to help me there: for where Harding names diverse
Ceremonies, and particularly, bowing themselves, and adoring at the Sacrament:
I say Adoring at the Sacrament, not adoring the Sacrament; there Bishop Jewel,
that learned painful and Reverend Prelate approves all, both the kneeling and
the bowing, and the standing up at the Gospel (which as ancient as it is in
the Church; and a common Custom, is yet fondly made another of their
Jnnovations,) And further, the Bishop adds, That they are all Commendable
gestnres and tokens of Devotion, so long as the people understand what they
mean and apply them unto God Now with us, the People did ever understand them
fully and Your self and yours apply them tothe Altar. Deo et Altari ejus, not
to God only.

Ergo in this you contradict your self.


apply them to God; and to none but God; till these factious Spirits and their
like to the great disservice of God, and his Church, went about to persuade
them, that they are Superstitious, if not Idolatrous gestures, as they make
every thing else to be where God is not served slovenly.

This raliacious ridiculous discourse and practice of Altar Bowing, being fully
answered resuted in the Quench-Cole in a Pleasant purge for a Roman Catholic,
in the Marginall Annotations and here formerly proved to be derived from the
Papists (page 63. 64.) we shall proceed to other Doctrines of this Nature.

5. That Jesus Christ and his Passion are offered up to God as a sacrifice in
the Not the adoring which he mentions not.
Sacrament of the Altar; and that it is a Sacrifice, as well as a Sacrament.
WE shall begin with Bishop Mountagnos Visitation Articles; printed both at
London and Cambridge, Anno 1638. Tit. 7. Number. 12. If we will follow the course
of the Ancient primitive Apostolical Church, we ought not to traduce or be
offended at the name, thing or use of Altar, whereat A MANIFOLD SACRIFICE is
offered to God.

What kind of Sacrifice this is, Francis Sales thus declares, in his
Introduction to a Devout Life, P. 191. 194. Use then all diligence to be
present often at this Heavenly Feast, that with the Priest and other devout
assistants thou may jointly offer up the fruit thereof, Christ Jesus, to God
his Father, for they self and all the necessities of holy Church.

The death and passion of our Redeemer which are actually and essentially
represented in this holy Sacrifice, with the Priest and the rest of the
faithful people, thou shall offer unto God the Father for his eternal honor
and thine own salvation.

Robert Shelford in his five Treatises, seconds him in these terms, Page 2.
The Sacrament of the Altar in which the sacrifice of our Lord Christ is
remembered, and represented unto his Father, P. g. 4. There the memory of the
everlasting sacrifice is made and presented unto the holy Trinity, Page 19.
Here the great sacrifice of Christ's death for our Salvation, is in rememberance
represented to God the Father, etc.

Doctor Pocklington is very copious in this Theme, in his Altar Christianum,
P. 130 Bishop Mountague says thus: I believe no such sacrifice of the Altar as
the Church of Rome does, I fancy no such Altars as they imply, though I
profess a Sacrifice and an Altar: And a little after speaking of his
Adversaries, he says thus; I have so good opinion of your understanding,
though weak, that you will confess the blessed Sacrament of the Altar (or
Communion Table) whether you please, to be a Sacrifice, etc. Page 135. Abuses
of Altars and sacrifices condemned not the things themselves: Priests,
Sacrifices, Oblations, Altars. The Sacrament of the Altar is not abolished, P.
122. The Prophet Malachi says Saint Justin Martyr did prophecy de Sacrificiis
Gentium, id est de paue Eucharistia and poculo Eucharistiae. It appears that
St. Justin that holy Martyr did call the Eucharist, a sacrifice, and has the
Prophet for his warrant. Saint Ireneus also says, that when Christ took the
Bread and the Wine, Gratias eget, he gave thanks, and said the bread was his
body, and confessed the wine to be his blood, et novi Testamenti novam docuit
oblationem, and taught a new oblation of the New Testament; which the Church
receiving from the Apostles, in universo mundo offert deo, does offer unto God
in all the world. This, says he, is that pure sacrifice offered unto God in
every place which the Prophet Malachi spoke of, before, Page 124. Saint
Chrysostom. How shall we receive this sacred host? How shall we partake the Lords
body with a defiled tongue? For this sacrifice, Domini sacrificium est. This
sacrifice, the Priest standing at the Altar, offers to God for all the world,
for Bishops, for the church etc. according to our Collect on Good Friday, Page
126. When the sacrifice of our Mediator is offered it cannot be denied, but
the faithful are hereby eased. This oblation the same Father calls summum and
verissimum Sacrificium, and says, that at the memories of Martyrs, Deo
offertur sacrificium Christianorum, ipsum vero sacrificium corpus est Christi,
which is not offered to them (for themselves are the body of Christ) but unto
God, Page 127. It appears by that which has been said that there were
Altars, and oblations, and sacrifices which the Fathers allowed. To conclude,
this constant Doctrine of the holy Fathers concerning Altars, Oblations, and
Sacrifices, is confirmed by the Canons of sundry Counsels, Page 128. Altars,
Oblations, and sacrifices were in Common use amongst the most holy Saints of
God that ever lived, Page 136. If there be no Christian Altar, there is no
Christian Sacrifice, if no Christian Sacrifice, there is no Christian Priest,
if there be no Christian Priest, away with the Book of Ordination of Priests
and Deacons.

We shall close up this with Doctor Peter Heylins words in his Antidotum
Lincolniense. P. 6. 17. and 26. A Sacrifice it was in figure, a sacrifice in
fact, and so by consequence, a sacrifice in the Commemorations, or upon the
Post-fact. A sacrifice there was among the Jews, showing forth Christ's death
unto them, before his coming in the flesh, a sacrifice there must be amongst
the Christians, to show forth the Lords Death till he come in Judgment; and if
a sacrifice must be, there must be also Priests to do, and Altars whereupon to
do it, because without a Priest and Altar, there can be no sacrifice, yet so
that the precedent sacrifice was of a different nature from the subsequent, and
so are also both the Priest and Altar from those before; a bloody sacrifice
then, an unbloody now: a Priest derived from Aaron then, from Melchisedech now,
an Altar for Mosaicall Sacrifices: then for Evangelicall now: for visible and
external sacrifices, though none for bloody and external sacrifices: Not an
improper Altar, and an improper sacrifice, as you idly dream of; for
sacrifices, Priests, and Altars being relatives, as your self confesses, the
sacrifice and the Altar being improper must needs infer that even our
Priesthood is improper also.

No Jesuit can or does say more then this amounts to:

6. That the body and blood of Christ are really, and substantially present in
the Eucharist, and the Bread and Wine transubstantiated into them.
FRancis Sales, in his Introduction to a devout life, determines thus. P. 194.
219. The death and passion of our Redeemer, are actually and essentially
represented in this holy sacrince: Our blessed Savior has instituted the
venerable Sacrament of the Eucharist which contains really and verily his
flesh and blood.

Christ's Epistle to a devout Soul thus seconds him, Page. 77. 78. Because thou
may be inflamed with a greater reverence, love and desire toward this
blessed Sacrament, I assure thee, that without all doubt my body is there
Sacramentally delivered unto thee, to be received, under the form of Bread.
Wherefore seeing it is the same body which I carry now glorified in Heaven,
seeing it is no other, nor any like unto it, but even the very same, and seeing
I carry not a body which is dead, nor with out blood it follows of necessity
that together in the same body, there must be also contained my soul, my
blood, my graces, and my virtues: To all which since the word is united it must
also follow, that the whole Trinity is present in this Sacrament, as truly and
as verily as they are in Heaven, though in another kind, id est, under a
Sacramental form. The same opinion thou must in like sort have of the
Chalice, the new testament in my blood, consider therefore that thou have me
really and perfectly there, Page 238. Make also every day to me in the honor
of the holy Sacrament of my blessed body two reverent adorations.

Doctor Laurence in his Sermon before the King resolves thus Page 17. 18. As I
like not those that say, he is bodily there, so I like not those that say, his
body is not there; because Christ says, it is there, and Saint Paul says it is
there, and the Church of England says it is there, and the Church of God ever
said it is there; and that truly and substantially and essentially: and that not
only by way of representation or Commemoration; and yet without either con,
sub, or trans, which the ancient Church said not: by a real, and nevertheless
a spiritual and mystical and supernatural presentation and exhibition. For
why should our Savior bid us take what he would not have us receive? We must
believe it is there; we must not know what is there: our faith may see it, our
sense cannot; it is a mystery, they all say, and twere no mystery if twere
known; his presence they determined, the manner of his presence they
determined not: they say he is there, end they say the Lord knows how. For why
should we seek him naturally in the Communion, whom naturally we cannot find
in the Womb of the Virgin.

Doctor Pocklington in his Altar Christianum, writes thus. Page. 108. 153. The
people were not so profane and unchristian not to perform their most humble
and lowly reverence toward the most holy and sacred Altar, where Christ is
most truly and really present in the blessed Sacrament, etc. Altars because
they are the seats and Chaires of estate, where the Lord vouchsafes to place
himself amongst us, (quid est enim Altar, nisi seeds corporis et sanguinis
Christi as Optatus speaks?) have bin in all ages so greatly honored, and
regarded of the most wise learned and most blessed Saints of God.

Doctor Heylin in his Cole from the Altar affirms Page 15. Bishop Ridley does
not only call it the Sacrament of the Altar, affirming thus, that in the
Sacrament of the Altar is the natural body and blood of Christ, etc.

The Archbishop of Canterbury in his Speech in Star Chamber, has this strange
Passage which did much amuse the World, Page 47. To Almighty God, I doubt not,
but yet it is, versus Altar, toward his Altar, as the greatest place of Gods
residence on earth: I say the greatest; yea, greater than the Pulpit, For there
it is Hoc est corpus meum, This is my Body; But in the Pulpit, it is at most, but
Hoc est verbum meum: This is my word, (and as many men use the matter, Hoc est
verbum Diaboli, This is the word of the Devil). And a greater reverence, no
doubt, is due to the Body than to the Word of the Lord: and so in relation
answerably to the Throne where his Body is usually present than to the Seat
whence his Word uses to be proclaimed, etc.

These words do necessarily imply, a real presence of Christ's Natural Body
on the Altar, not of his Sacramental only. For this sentence; The greatest
place of Gods residence on earth, I say the greatest; yea greater than the
Pulpit, for there it is, Hoc est corpus meum: andC. But in the Pulpit it is at
most, but hoc est verbum meum: clearly demonstrates that he means this only
of Christ's very natural body. For first he speaks of that Body of Christ, to
which the Deity is hypostatically united, and ever present with:

Secondly, of that body which draws along with it the greatest presence and
residence of God Himself on earth.

Thirdly of that body of Christ, which is far more worthy and honorable than
the word of Christ.

Fourthly, of that body to which a greater reverence no doubt is due, than to
the word of the Lord: and so by relation, to the Throne wherein his body is
usually present, then to the Seat where his word uses to be proclaimed. Now
all these cannot be intended of any representative or Sacramental Body of
Christ, but only of his Natural body, Therefore his clear meaning can be no
other, but that Christ's very natural body is really present on the Altar in the
consecrated bread, when the Sacrament is there administered. And to put this out
of doubt, these passages in his Conference with Fisher, p. 286. 293, 294, 295,
296. intimate, or rather clearly express as much.

All sides agree in the truth with the Church of England, That in the most
blessed Sacrament, the worthy Receiver is by his Faith, made spiritually
partaker of the true and real body and blood of Christ, TRVLY and REALLY. I
would have no man troubled at the words, TRVLY and REALLY, etc. Bellarmine
says, Protestants do often grant, That the TRVE and REAL BODY OF CHRIST IS
IN THE EVCHARIST, and IT IS MOST TRAVE. For the Calvinists, at least they which
follow Calvin himself, do not only believe, that the TRVE and REAL BODY of
Christ is received in the Eucharist, but THAT IT IS THERE; and that we partake
of it VERE ET REALITER: Nor can that place by any art be shifted, or by any
violence wrested from Calvines true meaning of the presence of Christ, IN and
AT the blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist. And for the Church of Engl. nothing
is more plain than that it believes and teaches The true and real presence of
Christ in the Eucharist; unless A. C. can make a body no body, and blood no
blood. Nay Bishop Ridley adds yet further, That in the Sacrament IS THE VERY
TRVE and NATVRALL BODY and BLOOD OF CHRIST, that which was borne of the Virgin
Mary; which ascendod into Heaven, which sits at the Right hand of God the
Father, which shall come from thence to judge the quick and the dead, etc. All
which compared with his Alterations and Additions made with his own hand in
the Book of Common Prayer, which he would have obtruded on the Church of
Scotland [recited at large in A Necessary Introduction to his Trial, page 158.
to 164.] so grossly Popish, that he durst not hazard the giving of them in
evidence to this particular point, but pleaded the Act of Pacification and
Oblivion in bar thereof as soon as ever they were but mentioned; will
undoubtedly manifest him a mere Papist in this particular, and a professed
Patron of the Real presence Transubstantiation, and the Mass it self.

7. That Crucifixes, Images, and Pictures of Christ, God, Saints, may be
lawfully, profitably used, set up in Churches, and ^ught not to be demolished,
or removed thence.
HOw zealous the Archbishop with his Confederates were in defense of Images and
Crucifixes in Churches, how forward to introduce and set them up in their
Chappells, Churches, Cathedralls Houses (confirming this Popish position by
their practice contrary to our Homilies, Statutes, Writers) and how extremely
violent he was against such who did by word or deed oppose them, has been
already at large demonstrated in the premises, especially in the cases of
Master Sherfield, and Mr. Workman: We shall therefore proceed to late
authorized Books in justification of Images, Crucifixes lawfulness and use in
Churches, or elsewhere.

Bishop Mountague in his Gagge p. 300. Writes thus of Images; Images have three
uses assigned by your Schools; stay there, go no further, and we charge you
not with Idolatry; Institutionem rudium: comme^orationem Historiae; and
excitationem de votionis: you and WE also give unto them. P. 317. Images in
his time were much improved, yet not unto Adoration; Honor, Reverence, and
respect, was given them to be books to the simple and ignorant people. Page
318. 319. The Pictures of Christ, the blessed Virgin, and Saints may be made,
had in houses, set up in Churches; Respect and honor may be given unto them;
The Protestants do it, and use them for helps of Piety, in rememoration, and
more effectual representing of the Prototipe: but quatenus? You say they must
not have Latria, so we; you give them Dulia: I quarrel not the term though I
could; there is a respect due to the Picture, sign, resemblance, monument of
great men, friends, good men, Saints, Christ: If this you call Dulia, we give
it too: Let practice and doctrine go together, we agree.

Which he thus prosecutes in his Appeal, page 250. Saint Gregory's doctrine
concerning Images far from Popery; now had the Church of Rome gone no further
in practice or precept, then that which Saint Gregory recommendeth, our Church
I suppose [for so our Doctrine is] would not blame them, not have departed from
them about that point: happily furious ones in our Church would proceed, but
they are singular Illuminates. Page 253. Nor are they utterly and absolutely
unlawful for any Religious employment. Our strictest Writers do not condemn or
censure St. Gregory for putting upon them that Historical use of suggesting
unto, moving or affecting the mind even in Pious and Religious affections. For
instance, in remembering more feelingly, and so being empassioned more
effectually with the Death and bloodshed, and bitter Passion of our SAVIOVR,
when we see that story fully and lively represented unto us in colors or work
by a skillful hand. And I know not the man that is made of humane would, but
when he reads in this book his Tragical indurance for man, will reflect
upon himself, and his own Soul and Conscience, with a lively reprehension of
man's Sin; GODS love CHRIST'S endeared charity, in undergoing these unknown
sufferings for our sake.

Page 254. But it has distasted some that respect and honor should be given
unto them: Strange, etc. unless men would have them pulled down in all
places, demolished, stamped to powder. The setting of them up suffering them to
stand, using them for Ornaments, for help of memory, of affection, of
rememoration, cannot be abstracted to my understanding from reverence and
honor simply in due kind. P. 257. Give them no Latria and we agree. p. 258.
The Church of Eng. condemns not the Historical use of Images: The Homily
that seems to condemn all making of Images, is to be understood with a NOTE.
restriction, of making them to an unlawful end. Many passages therein were
fitted to the present times, and the condition of the people that then were,
etc.

In his Orig: Ecclesiasticarum, Pars Posterior, Londini 1639. page 102. he
writes more boldly and plainly, concerning Images in these words.

Intuitum enim and Invitationem Imaginum non est cur quispiam, ut mihi videtur,
improbet, aut condemnet, nos certe non obloquimur, non obmurmuramus. Ping^te,
sequemur, sculpite suspicimus, Abrahami sacrificaturientis Imaginem, Christi in
Cruce pendentis Passionem, Typum illum, hoc complementum [quis negat] nos
imitamur in Ecclesiis nostris, intuemur libenter, and usurpamus oculis, ex
intuitu ad (...) commouemur, and ad detestationi conjunctam, (...) de peccatis
nostris in Judaeos vehementius inflamamur, Christi passionem tormentis
compatimur, and simul in memoriam revocamus, non fuisse dolorem sicut dolorem
ejus: cujus illa, ut Graeci in suis Liturgicis loqunntur (...), vocem illam
dolorificam expresserunt; Deus meus, Deus meus ut quid me dereliquisti? Atque
hinc ab intuitu isto inuitati, ad Amandum amore nostro, amorem illius
excitamur, qui propter amorem nostri, ut Augustinus loquitur, semetipsum (...),
exinanivit, cum in Plenitudine existens Deitatis, quod habet sanctus Leo,
plenitudinem accepit naturae humanae. Et factus obediens ad mortem, mortem
autem Crucis, (...) tantopere (...): Haec and hujusmodi nemo nostrum negat,
saltem negare nemo potest, ex intuitu efficacius ad animum and intimos cordium
affectus descendere: eoque magis commendantur, in usu posita quotidiana, quo,
tardiores cum simus, ad haec magnalia Dei recolenda pluribus indigemus and
efficacissimis adjumentis.

Ibid, p. 104. 105. He proceeds thus. Christianis licet fabricare omne genus
Imaginum, and simulachrorum; Spiritum sanctum sub specie linguae dispertitae;
in figura Columbae depingi, potuisse; de mente Patrum: Christum quoque hominem
vel in Agni (...) etc. tam certo liquet, quam solemn meridie lucere. Dei autem
Patris (...) fingi possit Image, non perinde liquet, cum non nulli velint,
nusquam illum sub ulla fig^ra apparuisse apud saeculum prius: quod ab alijs
tamen contra asseritur, ut verosimilit ere Daniele: ubi Antiquus diorum, and
Edius hominis destincti commemorantur: antur: Civilem autem usum, as moralem
statno ad intuitum, ac Iavitationem. Successerunt tempora cum frequentius in
Templis locaremur: sed tantum ad intuitum and invitationem. Tempora illa
laudamus and imitamur. Permittimus Sanctorum Imagines quicunqueeas formare
voluerit, tam in Ecclesia quam extra, propter amorem Dei and Sanctorum ejus;
adorare prohibemus frangere vel destruere eas non permittimus: haec illi, ITAET
NOS: And p. 103. Si quis Sancts alicujus expressam Imaginem, beatae puta
Virginis, Petri, Pauli dedecore afficiat, illum ego (...) optaverim, ac suae
impudentia, ac temeritatis paenas dare, quod OPTIMONOS EXEMPLO aliquoties
vidimus in Puritanos quosdam animadversum. He proceeds thus, Page 174. Sub
pretextit reformata pretatis Deum, Ecclesiam, pietatem, per nefandissima
sacrilegia eversis ub^cunque Monasterijs, Templis, Sacrarijs, and redactes in
fiscum maximis reditibus emunxerunt constanter religosi Nebulones, etc. And in
his Antidiatrib: Page 24. 27. 30. Haeretici nequaquam a te censeri debemus
(...), asseramus enim diligenter and cum cura Petri, Pauli, beatae Virginis,
Sanctorum aliorum innumeras imagines, praesertim vero Jesus Christ's Redemptoris
Crucifixi, etiam in Templorum criptis and lararijs, in perietibus and
fenestris, quas tamen non a loramus. Tantummodo taxamus in imaginibus (...),
usum and utilitatem non sollicitamus ullo pacto: Christiani omnes adoramus
Christum Imagine and Simulacro. An vero ad intuitum and Invitationem
constituerentur in lccis Sacris, and Sacratis conventibus destinatis, sunt qui
negant ex Origin, Arnobio, Minutio Faelice, sed non persuadent.

Sir Tho. Ridley in his View of the Civil Law, printed at Oxf. with
Annotations, 1634 p. 52. and 192. Has these passages added in the Margin
concerning the erecting of Crucifixes in Churches, That which follows in the
Euchologe discovers the form and manner of setting up the Crucifix which the
Law called (...). Then the Crucifix must be sent to the place where the Church
is to be erected, and there the Bishop by whom it is conveied says the
forenamed service, and when he makes the Consecration, the Cross must be set
up behind the holy Altar, etc.

Doctor John Pocklington in his Altar Christianum, licensed by the Archbishops
Chaplain by his own special direction, has these passages, justifying the
placing of Crucifixes upon the Altar, and against demolishing Images, page 143.
The Cross of Christ always used to stand upon the Altar. Christians had no
other Images in their Churches, Preter quam Crucis signum super Aram, ad
Ortentem versum; erigerent ut mentem oculosque in caelum, ubi Pater est omnium
expinsis manibus: but only the Cross of Christ which stood upon the Altar. And
it is not also said, that the Altar which stood in former Princes times
continued in Q. Elizabeth's Chapel with the Cross upon it?

Page 87. Besides the Altar so furnished, there are to be seen, many goodly
Pictures, which cannot but strike the beholders with thoughts of Piety and
devotion at their entrance into so holy a place; as the Picture of the Passion,
and likewise of the holy Apostles, together with a fair Crucifix, and our
blessed Lady and St. John, set up in painted Glass in the East Window, just
over the holy Table or sacred Altar: so that I must needs say as I think all
good men besides will, that who so lives in his Lordships Diocese must be
condemned of great impiety that will desert his Lord and not follow him usque ad
Aras, Page 139. The Magistrate may proceed against Delinquents that Violate the
Lords Table standing Altarwise, or break or deface the Picture of Christ, or
of the Saints in Church-Windowes or Crosses, and the like, upon the Statute, if
any should so offend (which God forbid.)

I shall close up this with Francis Sales, his Introduction to a devout life;
where he intimates to us what use we ought to make of Pictures and Crucifixes,
P. 158. Sometimes kiss reverently his blessed Image, and say unto him, these
words of Jacob, I will not leave thee, until thou give me thy blessing, Page
159. Stir up thy heart with corporal gestures of outward devotion and
prostrating thy self upon the ground, laying thy Arms a Cross before thy
breast, Embracing his Image, etc.

8. That the Pope, or Papacy is not Antichrist, nor Antichrist yet come.
BIshop Mountague in his Appello Caesarem determines thus, Page 140. 141. That
he (the Pope) is Magnus ille Antichristus, is neither determined by the
public Doctrine of the Church, nor proceed by any good Argument of private
men. I profess ingeniously, I am not of opinion that the Bishop of Rome
personally is that Antichrist, nor yet the Bishops of Rome successively are
that Antichrist.

Doctor Heylyn in his Moderat answer to Henry Burton thus seconds him page 126.
The Pope not Antichrist, for any thing resolved by the Church of England, Page
127. 128. 129. You tell us that by the Doctrine of our Church in the Homilies
and else where it is resolved, that the Pope is Antichrist: Your elsewhere, I
am sure is no where. Saint John has given it for a Rule, that every spirit
that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God, but
is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have heard, etc. So that unless you
can make it good, as I think you cannot, that the Pope of Rome confesses not
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, you have no reason to conclude that he
is Antichrist.

Christopher Dowe, in his Jnnovations unjustly charged, writes thus, Page 53.
To the third, That the Pope is not Antichrist: I answer, that though many of
the learned of our Church (especially at the beginning of our Reformation, when
the greatest heat was stricken between us and Rome) have affirmed the Pope to
be Antichrist, and his whole Religion to be Antichristian, and that some Books
exceeding the bounds of Moderation in this point have passed a broad, and that
with the license of Authority, yet to them that calmely and seriously consider
it, it may not without good reason be disputed as doubtful, whether the Popes
or any of them in his Person; or the Papal Hierarchy, be that great Antichrist
which is so much spoken of.

Robert Shelford in his five Treatises resolves thus, Page 284. That Rome at
this day is not the Beast is manifest, because the Pope there now sheddeth no
blood, Page 293. That the Pope is not to beheld for Antichrist, I prove from
Saint John's description. Whosoever is not of Antichrists spirit, cannot be
Antichrist, But the Pope is not of Antichrists Spirit, therefore he cannot
be Antichrist, Page. 297. The Church hitherto has neither declared the Pope
nor any other to be the great Antichrist. Therefore as yet he is to come: 299.
And were there no other Argument to free the Pope from being the Antichrist
among the Fathers, this is sufficient, for that he maintains Images. Yea the
very subject matter of his largest Treatise is this, and thus entitled. That
the Pope is not Antichrist, and that Antichrist is not yet come. One of his
Books of this Subject he presented to the Archhishop, who received, yea
reserved it in his Study, without check or contradiction; and was so far from
disliking this Opinion, that he gave special Command to purge all passages out
of old and new printed Books, which either directly J termed or intimated the
Pope to be Antichrist, or that man of sin, and repealed the Articles of
Reland, for defining him to be so, as we shall hereafter manifest.

9. That there is a Purgatory, and Limbus Patrum.
Christ's Epistle to a Devout Soul, P. 130. But when thou art come to
perfection, and prayest, lying prostrate at the feet of my Majesty, thou shall
desire to satisfy my Justice with that small ability which rests in thee,
and shall offer thy self for my Glory unto PVRGATORY, and to suffer for the
fulfilling of my will, whatsoever it shall be my will to lay upon thee, and the
fulfilling of my will, shall please thee more then the escape of Pudgatory.

Mountague his Gagge Page 176. They Quarter out Hell into four Regions Hell of
the damned, Purgatory, Limbus Jnfantum; et Limbus Patrum, This division, be it
granted them, page 278. Gods Kingdom is not so narrowed, but that he might
well have more places then one, Recepracles, Repositories, resting places for
the Righteous. Which he thus prosecutes in his Appeal, page 236. Heaven so
spacious, extended, so capations, is not, nor has been so narrowed in,
wherewith that there cannot be diverse Designations, Regions, Habitations,
Mansions, or Quarterings there page 237. They (the Fathers) were not in Hell,
but as they were not there, so were they not likewise in Heaven, strictly taken
for the third Heaven that receptacle of the Righteous now together with the
glorified body of our Savior, page 238. For that place was not then stantibus
ac tunc fitting or accruing to them, such a Royal habitation the Nonesuch of
God, did not befit their then inferior states and conditions.

And in his Appar. P. 476. Communem esse Patrum sententiam aliorumque
doctissimorum Scriptorum nostrae aetatis et Confessions, sanctorum aminas ante
Christi resurrectionem non fuisse in Caelo. Hieronimi testimoniae sunt
innumera, ante adventum Christiomnes and inferos ducebanturunde Jacob ad
inferos discensurum se dicit; et Evangelium docet magnum Chaos interpositum
apud inferos: Nota quoque ut Samuelem vere quoque in inferno fuisse credas et
ante adventum Christi quamvis sanctos infernt lege detentos, locum esse ait qui
lacus vocatur, et abissus, in qua non erant aquae; in qua animae recluduntur,
sive ad paenas P. 135. Obijciunt, nullus tertius locus indicatur in Scriptura
preter infernum dimnatorum et Caelum: Resp. Licet non indicaretur in scripturis
alium esse locum tertium, non tamen inde sequeretur non fuisse tertium, quia
multa sunt quae non indican tur in scripturis.

Many other passages of like nature might be added, but these shall suffer.

10. That there are Canonical hours of Prayer, which ought to be observed
THis is the subject matter of Doctor Cozens his private Devotions, or HOURS OF
PRAYER printed three or four several times one after another, and digested
into Canonical hours; the practice whereof he not only there pleaded for, but
(...) wise afterward introduced in Peter House in the University of Cambridge
(...) mong other his Popish Innovasions) as was attested upon Oath by Mr. (...)
and others.

The Archbishops own private Manuscript Devotions under his own (...) seized
by Mr. Prynne in his Chamber at the Tower, were all digested into Canonical
houers, in Imitation of the Hours of our Lady and other Popish Treatises of
Devotion, as was manifested by the Book it self, from Page 1. to 75.

Doctor William Watts, in his Mortification Apostolical, printed at London,
1637. Page 47. thus Justifies the use of Canonical hours. For this purpose
the night was divided into Canonical houers, or certain times of rising, to
Prayers: At midnight will I arise to give thanks unto the, said the man after
Gods own heart. Mark here that he praised not God lying, but used to rise and
do it, at other houers the Saints may sing a loud upon their Beds, and the
spouse may seek her Christ in the Bed by night, but when a Canonical houer
comes (of which midnight was one) David will rise to his devotions: thus did
the Apostles 100. At midnight Paul and Sylas prayed and sung praises unto God,
The morning watch was another Canonical houer, and this David was so careful
to observe, that he often times waked before it, etc.

11. That men have Free Will in Actions of Piety.
BIshop Mountague in his Gagge determines thus, Page 109. Man has freewill in
Actions of Piety, and such as belong unto his salvation. For the concurrence
of grace assisting with freewill: The correspondency of freewill with
Prescience, Providence and predestination, is much debated in your own
Schools, Page 116. Our conclusion and yours is beth one, we cannot deny
freedom of will; which who so does, is no Cathelique no nor Protestant. Which
he thus seconds in his Appeal, Page 75. 76. The Question of freewill is a
point of very great obscurity, fitting rather Schools then popular ears, or
auditories, if not, what mean those many divisions amongst men touching
freewill, the nature, state, Condition of it since Adams fall, the Concurrence
and Cooperation thereof with Grace, Page 99. There is freewill, Man prevented
by grace, assisted puts to his hand to procure Augmentation of that Grace,
as also continuance unto the end in that grace, Page 95. Thus having with as
great diligence as I could examined this Question, inter parts, of freewill, I
do ingeniously confess, that I cannot find any such material difference
between the Pontificians, at least of better temper and our Church. So he.

Shelford in his five Treatises Page 203. writes thus. The order for freewill,
is for man; to which because it is the Highest, God added his special grace,
And by this man travelleth, either to his home of happiness, or to his home of
heaviness. He proceeds thus. Page 211. Herein stands his liberty and freedom
to do what he can, and will what he will in the way of Grace and goodness,
wherein God will aid him to go beyond himself, page 105. O blessed Charity if
thou have this root in thee, thou shall comprehend this breadth and length,
heigh and depth, and thou shall with these holy Saints say, If I had been in
their Coats or had their occasions, I would have done as they did.

I shall conclude with Index Biblicus, printed at London. 1640. Liberum
arbitrium etiam post lapsus in homini mansit, etc.

12. That we are justified before God by Charity and good workers not by faith
alone.
SHelford in his 5. Treatisies, page 109. resolves thus, The fulfilling of the
Law justifies: but Charity is the fulfilling of the Law, Ergo it justifies:
Where the Abostle prefers Charity to justifying faith, he compares them in
the most excellentway, and it is most manifest, that the most exeellent way is
in the way of our justification page 120. Bona opera sunt efficienter necessaria
ad salutem.

Gredere Iustitia est omnis et una salus.
At non sit olim tam malis semita nunquam.
Heroum lassos duxitad astra gradus.
Sed labor et virtus.
Christopher Dowe, in his Innovations unjustly charged, page 124. We must put
all that we can, we must not fly to naked imputation, not by faith only, etc.
page 127. Fr. 4 Sancta Clara, that good works are effectively necessary to
salvation, which position was intended and maintained in opposition to the
Enemies of good works, of whom some deny their necessity, others allowing
their presence as requisite, deny that they conduce any thing to the
furtherance of salvation.

Sancta Clara, his Deus, Natura, Gratia page 158. Hic pax facillime ineunda;
sic etiam D. Montacutius articulum be fide recte explicat, page 159. Ecce
igitur plane and plene convenimus: Doctiores Protestants tribuunt
justificationem nostram habitui justi^ae non ergo fidei Jmmo haec nostra
positio solemniter Cantahrigiae in Com tijs anniversarijs pro actu doctor ali
hoc anno currente mense Iulio agitata est, page 181. Sane nulla hodie reperi
etur differentia in Confessione Anglica, and sanctissima Confessione Trid.
nihil in Articulis Hamptoni ensibus in oppositum ordinatur, ut patet Art. 9. de
Iustificatione iunde Montacutius in suo Appello, Caesar^m Cap. 6. express
probat, Doctrinam nostra ^^saltem secundum gradum hujus latitudinis, ab ipsis
teneri, etc.

13. That there are Merits, works of Supererogation, and Evangelicall
Counsels.
BIshop Mountague his Gagge page 153 Good works therefore said to be
meritorious are soon understood to be ex cord^gno: which that a work may so he
these conditions are required, That it be morally good, freely wrought by man
in this life, in the state of Grace and friendship with God, which has annexed
Gods promise of reward: all which conditions I cannot conceive that any
Protestant does deny unto good works.

Which he thus backs in his Appeal, page 203. The sense of the word, which
was but to procure, to incur, to purchase, major est mea iniquitas quam ut
veniam Merear, than that I may purchase or procure pardon, page 214. Touching
Evangelicall Counsels, I know no doctrine of our Church against them, page
215. So I say still I know none: I do believe there are and ever were
Evangelicall Counsels, such as Saint Paul mentions in his Concilium autem
do: such as our Savior poinred at, and directed unto in his. Qui potest capere
capiat, such as a man may do or not do without guilt of sin or breach of
Law.

Shelfords five Treatises, page 120. Virtutum sancta and speciosa caterva
salutem: Divino ex pacto, quam meruere, dabunt, p. 130. And to this belong the
Counsels of the Gospel which go beyond the precepts of the Law, of which
Saint Chrysostom. speaks, etc. CHRIST commanded nothing impossible insomuch that
many go beyond the very Commandments, who ever did this: he forth with
answers? Saint Paul, Saint Peter, even all the quire of Saints. Lastly as
Christ's spirit and grace gives such power to go beyond the precepts, etc. page
189. By his Counsels which go beyond his precepts, (because God has given
man free will to do what he can in the state of Grace for the state of Glory)
he shows him some exceeding means to grow to this life's perfection and to
improve the common reward of glory for the next life; as, sell that thou have,
etc. These are Gods Counsels, which of the Primitive Church were put in
practice, but in our times they are put off with a non placet, page 146.
Object. The very best works of the Saints are unclean impure menstruous and
mortal sins, therefore it is impossible for any man to keep the Law. Ans.
They that say so cannot be excused from extreme blasphemy.

Francis Sales, page 7. 8. Devotion then provokes us to do with joy and
delight all manner of good works, although they be not in any sort commanded
by Gods Law, but only commended unto our free will, by his Counsels and holy
inspirations, Page 375. Thy poverty (Philotheus) has two great privileges, by
which she can make thee rich in merits and deserts.

14. That the Law is possible to be fulfilled, and Perfection attainable in
this life.
SHelford Page 141. A Treatise showing that Gods Law now qualified by the
Gosspell of Christ, is possible, and ought to be fulfilled by us in this life.
p. 122. That there is a fulfilling of Gods Law in this life, James 2. 10.
whosoever shall keep the whole Law, etc. here therefore is a general and
absolute fulfilling spoken of p. 127. Christ has merited that the
righteousness of the Law should be fulfilled in us: therefore the Law is not
impossible to be fulfilled for us, page 130. Christ's spirit and grace gives
power to go beyond the precepts, page 139. If God should command things
impossible, he should be more cruel then a Tyrant, page 147. The unregenerate
cannot possibly fulfill the Law, page 149. But Gods Sons and servants are
able to fulfill it, p. 189. By his Counsels which go beyond his precepts, he
shows him some exceeding means to grow to this life's perfection.

Christ's Epistle to a devout Soul, page 240. A Rule for such as labor to
attain to Perfection, etc.

Francis Sales His Introduction to a devout Life, page 19. There are many
degrees and exercises of devotion which easily lead secular persons to
Perfection, St. Lydia and Saint Chrispin were perfectly devoute in their open
shops, etc. page 334. Charity only places us in the hight of Perfection.

15. That there are Venial sins.
Christ's Epistle to a Devout Soul, p. 57. Although in this conflict there are
many venial sins wont to be committed. That pain which is endured by
resisting of mortal sins does take away all that pain which the Venial
sins do deserve.

Page 32. Venial sins do not take from us the life of Grace.

Francis Sales in His Introduction to a Devout life, writes in this manner.

Page 110. That we must purify our selves from affections to Venial sins.
Thou shall discover in thy self, that besides mortal sins, from which by the
forementioned exercises thou have been purged, there remain yet in thy soul
diverse inclinations and affections to Venial sins.

Page 111. We can never be free from Venial sins in this life: I say then
that one must purge his soul from all the affections and inclinations that he
feels to Venial sins.

Page 112. A Venial sin be it never so little displeases God, though not so
hainously that he will damn us, or cast us away for ever for the same.

Page 114. Venial sins kill not our souls, but yet mar the honey of our
devotion.

It is no heinous sin (my Philotheus) to tell some little lie in pastime, to
exceed somewhat in needless talk, in careless looks, etc.

Page 119. Certain Inclinations are not properly sins neither mortal nor
Venial, but only imperfections.

Page 214. Think it not enough to confess thy Venial sins.

Page 227. To communicate every 8. days it is requisite, neither to be guilty
of mortal sins, not any affection to Venial.

Shelfords five Treatises, p. 130. Lastly, A^ Christ's Spirit and Grace gives
power to go beyond the precepts, so it is not incongruent that it should so
molifie sins in his members, as to make them Venial and not killing.

Sparrowes Sermon of Confession. All our sins therefore must be confessed;
Omnia Venialia, omnia mortalia, so say the Casuists.

16: That Relics of Saints are to be preserved and reverenced,
BIshop Mountague, Orig: Ecclesiast: Pars prior. Page 39. De qua re, quid nos
Angle sentiamus breviter exponemus. Nos Martyrs, etc. qu memorias ipsorum
anniversartas in orbem redeuntes in Sancto Stephano, Proto-Martyre honoramus,

poterimus genuiua, non fucata, libenter suscipimus, and veneratione sua debita,
congrua honeramus. Imprimis autem de Martyribus, ubi non constat veritas,
disquisitionem censemus instituendam.

Page 40. Repraesenta mihi fase as illas Seruatoris; D^ce certissimo illas

intuebor, vel in apothecas condam and recludam inter preciocissima cemelia
censendas.

17. That vowed Poverty, Virginity, a Monastical life, and Monasteries, are
lawful, useful: Popish Votaries, Saints, Orders to be imitated, applauded.
Christ's Epistle to a Devout soul, p. 86. 87. 88. 89. brings in Christ thus
speaking to Christians: I Was driven into banishment, brought up by the labor
of my mother, and fed by Alms at other Folks cost, having neither house nor
lodging of mine own: withered often in the mountains: how was I spoiled of
all my garments at the time of my passion? etc. Look therefore upon my poverty
and leave to be sad, why art thou not grieved like a good Emulatresse if thou
see any man poorer then thy self (as Saint Francis was;) if thou perceivest
any man more agreeable to my life and poverty then thy self: this indeed
should be a kind of emulation. Embrace with me the cross of Poverty, etc.
Determine therefore now, and make a firm resolution from the bottom of thy
heart, to contemn all things for the love of me, and be unwilling to possess
any thing but even such as of necessity thou art enforced to use, delighting in
all Poverty, contempt and penury, that thou may be worthy to enjoy me.

Francis Sales, His Introduction to a devout life, page 19. True it is that the
Devotion altogether contemplative, Monastical, and Religious, cannot be
exercised in these Vocations (of Artificers, etc.) yet are there many other
degrees of devotions.

Page 200. The solitarines of Saint Paul the first Hermit, is imitated in some
sort by the spiritual retreates of which we have spoken, and the extreme
poverty of St. Francis, may be imitated by those practices and exercises of
spiritual poverty which we will hereafter set down.

Page 354 Charity only places us in the height of perfection, but Obedience,
Chastity, and Poverty are excellent Instruments to attain unto it. I will not
say any thing of these three virtues, as they are vowed solemnly, for so they
appertain to Religious persons.

Page 335. When they are vowed solemnly, they place a man in the way and state
of perfection.

Henry Stafford his Female Glory page 23. Let us then imagine that this holy
Recluise confined her body to this sacred solitude, etc.

Page 28. The bonds of her Matrimony were asked in heaven, and no impediment
found why she might not wed God himself; yet at the earnest solicitation of
the Reverend Priests, says Mantuan, she was content to be betrothed to
Joseph, not that he should do the Office of an Husband, but serve as a bar
to the importuninity of other suitors, that so she might the more freely enjoy
the inconceivable pleasure she took in her Vowed Virginity.

18. That there are written Traditions, which we must observe, and are of
equal Authority with the word.
BIshop Mountague in his Gagge page. 30. There are Traditions written and
unwritten, you mean not here Traditions written I know it, no more do we.

Page 31. Traditions instituted by our Savior even in points of belief and
Faith have divine Authority, as his written word has. Traditions derived from
the Apostles, have equal authority with their preachings and their writings,
Traditions of the Church have such authority, as the Church has, all bind and
oblige as they were intended, and as their extent is. For they must be
considered not only from the Author, but from the end: some were intended to be
permanent, others only to be transient for a time only, or else for ever: some
Universal, some only Partial: for the Catholic or else a private Church:
such variety and difference is in Traditions.

We do grant it in every kind that either there are or have been Traditions
of Christ, his Apostles, the Church private men.

Page 37. Quae universa tenet Ecclesia, ab Apostolis praecepta been traduntur,
quanquam scripta non reperiantur, said Saint Augustine, and I subscribe unto
it. Omni modo bind they unto Obedience so long, in such sort, so far forth as
the Authors did intend, till the same Authority disavow them which gave unto
them being at the first. In the 34. Articie to this purpose, we read of and
concerning Ecclesiastical Traditions.

Lo Traditions not only avowed but maintained.

Page 41. No Protestant living in his right wit will deny this, that the
Apostles spoke much more then is written. Therefore the Traditions of the
Apostles and of the Church is without all question of good credit and esteem,
and so much we profess, Art. 34. I grant, it has displeased some which is said

It is Tradition which avoweth it, seek no further. I see no reason why any
should be displeased therewith.

Doctor Pocklintons Altar Christianum, Page 48. None of all these Heretics
can derive their succession from the Apostles, nor show how their Doctrines
were received by Tradition from them.

Page 49. According to Apostolical Tradition.

Page 50. Those that deprive us of the benefit of this Apostolical Tradition.

Page 180. Traditions of holy Church, of absolute Authority.

The Archbishop himself in his Reply to Fisher, determines thus page 44. Some
Traditions I deny not true, and firm and of great both Authority and use in
the Church as being Apostolical.

Doctor Heylins Antid. Lincolniense page 86. Sect. 2. Many things came into our
mind by a successionall Tradition, for which we cannot find an express
command, which yet we ought to entertain, ex vi Catholicae consuetudinis, of
which Traditions there are many which still retain their force among us in
England. This Church (the Lord bethanked for it) has stood more firm for
Apostolical Traditions, then any other whatsoever of the Reformation.

19. That Ave Mary's are to be now said to the Virgin Mary: That she and other
Saints; and our Angels Gardians are to be invoked and prayed to, as our
Patrons; Popish Saints to be imitated: and the Virgin Mary, extolled, deisied,
by Protestants as she is by Papists.
Christ's Epistle to a devout Soul, Page 237. Say with the same intention, the
prayer at least which I taught my Disciples, and the Salutation of the Angel,
to my blessed Mother; and offer me up to my Father in thy heart, and with me
all those good works which I and my servants either do or have done for thee,
and the universal Church, page 252. Do not omit every night to entreat my
glorious Mother to pray unto me to pardon thee (at her request) all such
negligences as thou have ignorantly committed, and which thou do not
remember: She has performed the office of a tender Mother NOTE.
to me, I have received nourishment from her blessed Duggs, and therefore I
cannot nor will not (my love to Her is so great) deny any Petition that she
presents: and therefore entreat me daily by her intercession for the amendment
of thy life, perseverance in virtue and obtaining of my grace, page 253. Thou
shall further entreat me by her Intercession, that the worshipping and honoring
of me may be daily amplified, enlarged, augmented and increased, either by this
rule and instruction which I have now prescribed and commended to thee, or by
what other means soever that shall seem best unto thee, p. 262. By the
compassion of thy Mother etc. What can be more Popish then this?

Francis Sales in his Introduction to a devout life, writes thus page 19. Saint
Lydia and Saint Chrispian were perfectly devout in their open shopps; Saint
Anne, Saint Martha, Saint Monicha amongst their families, etc. page 89. Thou
being placed upon thy knees before thy good Angel, Consider, that God desires
thou would make choice of Paradise, and thy good Angel also urges expressly
thee with all his power, offering thee on Gods behalf a thousand succors,
page 91. In like manner accept the favors which all the blessed Saints present
unto thee; promise them that thou will make toward them, and give thy hand to
the good Angel that he may guide thee thither, and encourage thy soul to make
this choice, page 97. O sacred Virgin and all you blessed Saints of Heaven, I
choose you for my guides and Patrons, I render my self under your colors. O my
Guide and Guardian in heaven unite me unto this glorious and sacred assembly:
Page 194. We must pray for the whole Church NOTE.
of God, employing and imploring to that end the intercession of our blessed
Lady, Page 165. O Father of Goodness, etc. Then think upon our blessed Lady,
upon the good Angels and the Saints that are gone before thee, to the end that
thou may insist in their steps, and be partaker of their happy intercessions:
page 197. The holy Souls of the Saints in Heaven, in company of the blessed
Angels, they likewise do good Oshces and help to assistus by their sacred
intercession. Honor, Reverence and respect the sacred and glorious Virgin Mary
with an especial Love: she is the Mother NOTE.
of our Sovereign Lord and heavenly Father Christ Jesus, and consequently our
Grandmother. page 198. Choose some particular Saints amongst the rest whose
lives thou may more particularly read, taste and imitate, page 200. Read also
the lives of the Saints in which as in a mirror, thou may see the
pon^traiture of Christian perfectison. The solitariness of Saint Paul, the
first Hermit, is imitated in some sorts, by the spiritual retreates of which
we have spoken; and the extreme poverty of Saint Francis may be imitated, etc.
There be some Saints which more directly serve to guide and order our lives
then others do; as that of Saint Gregory our Apostle of England, as the life
of the blessed Martyer Teressa, the lives of Saint Thomas of Aquine, Saint
Francis, Saint Benuet, and such like, page 201. Other Saints lives there are
which contain more matter of admiration then of imitation, as the life of
Saint Mary of Egypt, of Saint Simeon Stilites, of the two St. Katherins of
Sienna and of Genua, and Saint Angla, and which never the less do minister
unto us great occasions to taste the sweetness of the love of God.

Bishop Mountague his Amid. page 20. Non abnuerim, Sanctos esse Orationis and
Intercessionis (ut loqui soletis) Mediatores, sed universim universos praecibus
suis apud Deum interveniunt, and orationibus mediantur, page 22. Meminerunt
amicorum suorum et rerum a si quondam in terris gestarum quocirca ad Christum
in caelo recollecti, poterint de viae ordinaria per Jesum Christum apud deum
Patrem amicos familiares (...) praecibus commendare, et adjuvare. Which he
thus further prosecutes in his Gagge, page 203. Now the case of Angel keepers
in point of advocation and invocation is much different from other Angels, not
Guardians; as being continually attendant, always at hand though invisible, and
therefore though we might say; Sancte Angele Custes Ora pro me, it follows
not, we may say Sancte Gabriell ora pro m^, page 207. Angels are to be
beseeched who are deputed our Gardians, therefore not all Angels but only
Guardian, Page 214. The Saints pray for us in particular, some particular Saint
for some particular man, in some special case, some time. And to come more
particularly to it. The question is not, whether Saints departed do pray unto
God that is confessed on both sides, etc.

Anthony Stafford in his Femall Glory, (in the Front whereof there is the
Picture of the Virgin Mary encompassed with a Glory holding Christ a little
Infant in her Arms) thus extolls, nay justifies the Invocation of the Virgin,
and saying Aves to her, Med: Poetica. Ave Maria. Tu gaudi verbum peperisti, and
dicit Avete Omnibus: atque omnis terra revibrat Ave. He proceeds thus in the
Reverse. The House of Gold, the gate of heavens power, great Queen of Queens
most mild, most meek, most wise, most venerable, cause of all our joy, etc.
In the Panegyric of her he adds, To whom do bow -- The Souls of all the
just, whose place is next to God.

Page 2. 3. He styles her. Most Excellent Princess; The Virgin Mother of God:
Empress of the lower world: The alone fair, the alone lovely, P. 32. Glorious
Empress Page 21. White spotless Soul, illuminated with Revelations by the
divine Object of her chaste vows. Page 150. Woman's dearest Mistress. Page 197.
Our sweetest Lady. P. 158. In all things the very figure and resemblance of
Sanctity it self, P. 148. 149. he thus approves of Nunneries, and prayers on
Beads to the Virgin, before her Image with Christ in her Arms. You who have
lived spiritual Amourists, whose spirits have triumphed over the flesh, on
whose cheeks solitude, prayers, fasts, and austerity have left an amiable
pale: you who ply your sacred Arithmeticke, and have thoughts cold and clear
as the Crystal Beads you pray by: you who have voud Virginity mental, and
corporal, you shall not only have ingresse here, but welcome. Approach with
comfort, and kneel down before the Grand Immaculate Abbess of your Snowy
Nunneries, and present the all-saving Babe in her Arms with due veneration.
Never think more of the Faecunditie of Wedlock, since you see here that God
himself is the fruit of Virginity. P. 153, 154. He thus commends the burning
of Tapers, and saying Masses on Candlemasse day, in honor of the Virgin Mary:
This day is called Candlemasse, as much to say, the day of lights, on which
(while Mass was singing) very many Tapers were burning in the Church.
Innocentius thus propounds and solves the Question.

What is the reason that on this day we use so many lights in the Church? The
cause of this institution is twofold. The first is, that a heathenish custom
may be converted into a Christian Right or Ordinance, and that which was
performed by superstitious Idolaters, in honor of Ceres and Proserpina, may be
turned into the praise and glory of the Virgin Mary. The second is, that they
who by Grace are purified, by this Ceremony may be admonished to imitate those
prudent Virgins, who (as the Evangelicall parable testifies) came not without
their Tapers lighted to the Nuptials of Christ their Spouse. Page 209. There
is the Picture of her fabulous assumption into heaven, cut in Brass after the
popish form, with men and women devoutly kneeling and praying to her, and
these verses written under the same. What Honor could to this GREAT QVEENE be
done,
More then be taken up to Heaven high.
And there have God for Father, Spouse, and Son,
The Angels wait, the world stand wondering by?


After which, he spends many pages to prove the Verity, or probability at
least of her Assumption into Heaven, Soul and Body; which (says he) by many
of the Fathers, all of the Romish Church, and some of the Reformd is held for
an undoubted truth: (when as indeed it is a mere Popish ridiculous false
Legend.) And to prove this, he makes her to be borne without sin.

Page 212. Dammianus argues, That as conceiving without sin, she brought
forth her son, without pain, a curse laid on all, other women: so might it
well be that she who was without sin, might overcome death, the reward of it;
P. 119. 120. he writes. That the Virgin is not to be considered as a mere
Woman, but as a Type or Idaea of an accomplished piety. Adding: They err not so
much, in my judgment, in the adoring extreme as some too severe maintains of
the former, do in the neglecting. They are so far from praising her
themselves, that they most unjustly deprive her of the praise given her by
others. They reject all testimonies of her worth; as Hail Mary full of Grace,
etc. They abhor to hear her called Domina etc. Concluding this point in these
terms, page 223. Of one thing I will assure them, till they are GOOD MARIANS,
they shall never be good Christians: while they derogate from the dignity of
the Mother, they cannot truly honor the Son, page 228. 229. Erasmus styles
her, His SAVIORESSE, which NOTE.
he cites with approbation p. 230. to 237. He proceeds thus in her praises. All
parts of the world have produced admirers of her worth; Syria has brought
forth Eph^aim; Antiochia, Saint Chrysostom, Capadocia, Saint Basil, and Saint
Nazianzen; Constantinople, Germanus, and Proclus; Dalmatia, Saint Hierome;
Germany, Rupertus, Albertus, and Agrippa; England Beda, France, Bernard,
Spain, Alphonsus; Italy, Aquinas, and Bonaventure; Afric, Saint Cyprian, and
Saint Austine; Greece, Dionisius Areopagita, etc. To these succeed famous
Christian Poets, ancient and modern, who have written Pannegrricks upon her;
as Beda Gregorius Nazianzenus, Innocentius Pontifex, Actius Sanazarius* Adam de
Sancto Victore, Alcimus A^tus, Antonius Muretus. Aurelius Prudentius, Baptista
Mantuanus, Clandiarus, Franciscus Petrarcha, Godfridus Viterbiensis, Hieronymus
Vide, Paulinus; D. Philippus Menzelins, Rudolphus Agricola, Sedulius, Venantius
Fortunatus.

To these I add many Emperors, Princes and Princesses and a world of devoute
great ones, who have been her prosessed admirers; as Constantine the Great,
Charles, the Great Pulcheria Augusta, Henry the second Emperor, Alphonsus the
Chaste in SPAIN, Edwardus in Hungaria, Bolislaus in Polonia. Venceslaus in
Bohemia.

All which are Canonized for Saints, and have erected and dedicated Temples to
her memory: Neither have the Princes of this our I Will bin defective in doing her
all possible honor, and in consecrating Chappells and Tempells to her memory:
Frederick the third Emperor made the contemplation of her almost his only
food. Stephanus, King of Hungary, called his Kingdom, the Marian Family: In
this glorious Family, whole Kingdoms and Commonwealths have NOTE.
enrolled themselves. My Arithmeticke will not serve me to number all those who
have registered their names in the Sodalitie of the Rosary of this our Blessed
Lady the Original of which is derived from the battle of Naupactun, gained
by John of Austria, and the Christians, which Victory was attributed to her
intercession with her son. The Colonian Sodallity first Instituted, had out
of Lovaine, 4000. of Brabant, 30000. out of Gueldria, 4000. out of Holland and
Zeland 7000. etc. Many holy Orders also are of this Sodallity, as the
Benedictines, the Franciscans and Carthusians and many others. If all these
Testimonies and examples of great worthy people will not move us to honor her,
we shall be judged, both unworthy of this life, and ignorant of that better to
come. For shame let not us alone deny NOTE.
her that honor, and praise with all the world allows her. Page 247. He
Invocates her saying: O pardon Gracious Princess, my weak endeavors to sum
up thy value, etc. And Page 248. Thou deservest a quire of Queens here, and
another of Angels, in Heaven, to sing thy praise, etc. And I confess my
sweetest Lady. Page 249. To give thee an estimation answerable to thy merit, is
a thing impossible: I must therefore be content to do by thee, as the Ancient
Heathen did by the Images of the gods; when by reason of their height they
could not place the Crowns on their heads they humbly laid them at their feet.
In his Epistle to his Feminine Reader, speaking of the Virgin Mary: This is she
who was on earth a confirmer of the good, and a reformer of the Reprobate; all
her visitants were but so many converts, whose bad affections and erroneous
opinions, the sweetness of her discourse had rectefied: the Leprosy of sin was
her daily cure, and they, whom vice had blinded, were by her restored to their
inward light, and their prostrate Souls adored Divine, Majesticall virtue
residing in this sacred Temple: the knowledge of her humbled the most (...)
Natures, for the luster of her merits rendered their own obscure, And in his
Epistle to the Masculine Reader: But this I will say, that though I impute not
the late troubles and afflictions of the Protestant party in Germany to the
small Reverence there paid her (many of Gods judgments according to Saint
Augustine, being secret, none unjust) yet truly I believe, that the
under-valuing of one so great and dear in Christ's esteem, (as his Mother;
cannot but be displeasing to him; and that the more we ascribe to her,
(setting Invocation a part) the more gracious we appear in his sight. He
concludes it thus; I will only add this, that since the finishing of this
story, I have read a Book of the now Bishop of Chicester, entitled Apparacus,
etc. And I am glad to find that I have not digressed from him in any one
particular: So he, Lo therefore what a Metomorphosis of our Religion is here.
Here is a new Goddess, brought in among us, the Virgin Mary adorned extolled
deified with Titles, Courtships, Encomium, Hymns: taken out of Popish
Missalis, Hours, Breviaries, Poems. The Author glories, that he is the first
who has written, (as he says) in our Vulgar tongue, on this our blessed
Virgin: And God grant he be the last: But he bears himself in all this upon
the Church of England: where we pray you? at last we perceive this Church of
England is the (then) Bishop of Chihester (Mountague) in his Apparatus, from
whom he has not digressed in any particular.

This Book of Staffords giving very great scandal to Protestants, and
encouragement to Papists, Mr. Henry Burton, in his Sermon entitled: For God
and the King, page 123. 124. 125. discovered, censured these extravagant Popish
Passages in it, advising the people to beware of it. For which, among other
things, he was brought into the Star Chamber and there censured: But on the
contrary, this Popish Book of Staffords with the forementioned scandalous
Passages in it, were by the Archbishops special direction professedly
justified, both by Doctor Heylin in his Moderate Answer to Mr. Burton (licensed
by the Archbishops own Chaplain, and written by his command) page 123. 124.
and by Christopher Dow, in his Innovations unjustly charged, page 51. 54. and
this Book neither called in nor corrected, so audatiously Popishwas he grown,
in this particular, among many others.

20. That the Church is always Visible:
Bishop Mountague his Appeal: Page 139. The Church of Rome has ever been
visible. The Church of Rome is and ever was a true Church since it was a
Church. Therefore the true Church has ever bin visible. Which he thus seconds
Orig. Ecclesiasticarum Tomi prio: pars poster. page 463. Sancte credimus,
defendimus, etc. Ecclesiam nullis interceptam, intercisam intercapedinibus,
perpetuo extantem, alicubi visibilem, oculis usurpandam, in eum finem et eo
modo ut intelligere possint quibus curae illud est apud quos habeatur verbum
vitae, etc.

21. That Churches, Altars, Chalices, Churchyards, etc. ought to be
Consecrated by the Bishop, and that his Consecration puts an inherent holiness
into them That one part of the Church or Chapel, is holier then another: That
the place within the new Railes where the Altar stands is Sanctum Sanctorum,
into which none but Priests ought to enter, yea, Christ's Throne and Mercy seat.
DOctor Pocklingtons, Altar Christianum, page 51. Dedication and Consecration
of Churches used by Godly Bishops, and taxed by the Centurists for the mystery
of Iniquity: I will pass from the placing of the Bishops Chair to the
dedication of his Church where it was set. The dedication of Churches within
two hundred years after Christ shows clearly (...) were Churches: Saint
Clemens his Command both for building and Consecrating of Churches makes it
apparent, page 80. At the upper end of the Chancell, was a place enclosed and
Railed in from the rest of the Chancell, whereunto none, neither Priests that
were Penitents nor Deacons were permitted to enter, and there to communicate
and officiat in the Consecration of the Eucharist, or in the administration
thereof unto Priests, but they themselves: This place was called Sacrarium,
here stood the Altar or Lords Table, and hitherto none might approach but the
Priests themselves. The Canon is clear for it, no Layman may come within the
Altar. Page 83. Prayer for Kings, for Bishops, for the whole Church, and the
Lords Prayer was then only said at the Altar by the Priest in the holy of
holies: He deserves not to be named in the Priests, prayer at the Altar that
is an occasion to withdraw Priests from the Altar. page 108. They had shut up
the Door of the holy of holies whereunto he was entered to do his reverence to
the holy Altar, Page 141. A man may as lawfully and Christianly administer the
blessed Sacrament in a Barn or Towne-hall, as in any place that is not
Consecrated to such holy uses. And when the Church was Consecrated, was not the
Altar the chiefest place which with most Ceremony and devotion was hallowed?
when it was hallowed, was it not kept more carefully from Profanation then any
other part of the Church? was there not a Feast annually kept in a joyful
remembrance of the Dedication of every Church and did not the consecration of
the Altar carry the name of the Feast, page 142. Was not the Altar set in
Sacrario or sancto sanctorum in the highest place of all, whereunto the Priest
ascended by steps and degrees, and when they so assended, were there not said
Psalms of degrees? This holy Altar is in his own nature, but a stone, but
being consecrated and dedicated benedictionem accipit.

Shelfords five Treatises page 2. From hence appears that the Altar is the
principal part of Gods House, as being the cause and Original of all the
rest, etc.

Doctor Ridley his view of the Civil Law reprinted at Oxford 1634. in the
marginall Annotations newly added to it, page 52. The Bishop of the place shall
come and lift up his hands to Heaven and consecrate the place to God: P. 191.
For that which concerns foundation and erection: All that the Patron had free
to himself was but the thought, he might think where he would design the
ground, etc. but this was nothing without execution, and to this the Diocesan
was to be required as the most principal and most effectual agent. If the
Patron built a Church upon his own ground without the Bishops consent the
Bishop might pull it down without the A notable Passage to advance the
Jurisdiction of Bishops, and deprive Patrons of their Rights.
Patrons consent: page 192. When he makes the consecration, the Cross must be
set up behind the holy Altar: word being brought to the Patriarch concerning
the Church that is to be built, letters are directed either to the Exarch or to
some of the Bishops, to request that the Church may be founded Consecrated and
entitled to the Patriarchs (...) etc. Consecrated in the Name of such a Saint,
page 193. Things for the most part were altogether disposed by, but nothing at
all without the Bishops Jurisdiction. That the Patriarch or Bishop should
challenge this Jurisdiction over the new Church etc. it seems most reasonable,
For what did the lay Patron more do, then a man of Israel who brought a Lamb
but the Priest made it an Offering and an Atonement? The Patron parhaps might
choose the place, but till the Prelate came and sanctified the Ground, it might
be as well a Den of Thieves as a House of Prayer: The Patron might bring the
Stones, the Bishop made it a Church, till then nothing was but the breathless
body of a Temple, the soul being yet to come from a Diviner influence of the
Diocesan: therefore the privilege of a new Church followed not the building
but the consecration of it, etc.

Richard Tedder in his Visitation Sermon: Licensed by Doctor Samuel Baker,
Feb. 6. 1636. Printed at London 1637. It is the Consecration that makes
Churches holy, and makes God esteem them so, which though they be not capable
of Grace yet they receive by their Consecration a spiritual power, whereby
they are made fit for Divine Service, and being consecrated, there is no danger
in aseribing a holinesie unto them.

21. Total and final Apostasy from Grace. Predestination a desperate Doctrine
Resisting of Grace.
BIshop Mountague in his Appeal, page 29. 30, 31. Ex Artic. 16. After that we
have received the Holy Ghost we may depart away from Grace. Till the Church
expound otherwise, it is as free for me to take it according to the Letter, as
for you to devise a figure. The Article insisteth on men justified, after Grace
received; challenged it was in this sense as unsound at the Conference at
Hampton Court, but defended, maintained avowed, averred for true, ancient,
justifiable, good and Catholic by the greatest Bishops and Learned Divines
then living in this Church against that absolute irrespective necessitating and
fatal decree of your new Predestination; styled then and there by Bishop
Bancroft in public audience with much vehemence without any Check, dislike,
distaste, dissent (for we read of none) a desperate doctrine of Predestination.
At what time also that Reverend Prelate and most accomplished Divine Dr. Overall
Bish. of Norwich, etc. said, That a justified man might fall away from Grace,
and so ipso facto incur Gods wrath; and was in state of wrath and damnation
until he did recover again, Page 33. Can your Learning and understanding make
any other Construction of these words then, That a man may fall away from
Grace, and become no Child of God at all. This is spoken, and meant. Not only
of total lapse for a time, but also of final separation, and for ever.

Page 37. I see no reason why I might not have been as confident in
maintaining falling away from Grace, as you and your Divines are upon weaker
grounds in defending the contrary.

Page 60. I must confess my dissent through and sincere from the faction of
Novelizing. Puritans, but in no one point more than in this their desperate
Doctrine of Predestination, Vide page 50. and 70. 71. etc. to like purpose.
Page 72. Id. It is not in reason probable, that you should have the doctrine of
the Church on your side against Master Mountague -- For the Church holds and
teaches punctually, and that against the Opinion and with the dislike of the
Learnedest of your side that Faith, true justifying Faith once had may be lost
and recovered again: that a man endued with Gods holy Spirit and enlightened
with the heavenly light may loose that holy Spirit, have that light put out,
become like unto Saul and Judas.

Page 89. If a man justified may fall away from Grace, which is the Doctrine of
the Church of England, then without question he may resist the grace of God
offered.

Page 214. It is an (...) of your other singularity, That Faith once had cannot
be lost totally and for ever.

Edmond Reeve, page 13. Mar. The Church signifies, that it is possible for
such as are made the Members of Christ to become the members of the Devil, if
they take not due care.

Page 64. Seeing then that some have perished which have been pronounced to
have been in the number of Gods Elect.

Shelfords five Treatises. page 187. Such as shall fall double, from less and
from greater grace and never rise, for such Justice has a double due, a
natural and a supernatural death; seated not only in paena damni, but in
paena sensus, which the torments of hell fire afford.

22. That there is universal Grace and Redemption, and no absolute Reprobation.
THis having been formerly touched, in the Evidence concerning Arminianisme,
we shall be the briefer in it here. Edmond Reeve writes thus; page 19. 20.
Whereby does God the Father draw all mankind unto Christ?

Ans. Holy Church does signify it unto us, where it says, that Almighty God
does show unto all that be in error the light of his truth, to the intent they
may return into the way of Righteousness. St. John says, Christ is the light
that lights every man which comes into the world. Many Scriptures more
declare that God is merciful to universal mankind, not willing the death of
a sinner, etc. as the Divine service teaches, and informs us. The which
Doctrine of hers as sundry more, though we in our youngnesse of Christian
knowledge do not understand; yet are we to believe also and to know, that the
Fathers which set forth the divine service did perfectly understand, like as
also we are to believe, that the Fathers of the Church now and always do in
the great Mystery of Godliness comprehend many things which the Common people
do not; yea also some things which Ministers of the inferrior Order, as
Priests, Pastors, and Teachers do not apprehend, who are therefore to be
guided in Divinity by those most reverend and right reverend Fathers in God,
and not to say that such and such sayings in the Communion Book are untrue,
because they understand them not.

Page 60. Saint Paul says, That he gave himself a ransom for all; he died
for universal mankind: Again the death of Christ is available for the
redemption of all the world.

Page 61. Whereas it is said by some, that Christ died not for Universal
mankind efficiently or effectually, namely for such as perish, they consider
not what the Scripture signifies Christ to have done, yet he did it not in
phantasy, but in reality, in every deed.

Page 66. 67. How could the Church ordain and require for to be said unto
every particular member of hers in the Communion. The Body of our Lord Jesus
Christ which was given for thee, etc. if any one of them were absolutely
reprobated, 1. c. from all eternity unconditionally decreed to be damned in
Hell fire everlastingly.

The Book entitled, Gods love to mankind; and Doctor Jack sons Divine Essence
and Attributes, part. 1. are professedly written, to justify universal Grace
and Redemption.

23. That the Personal succession of Bishops is a true note of the Church, and
necessary: That Peter's Chair was at Rome, and he sat Bishop there: and that
it is the honor and happiness of our Church, that this Archbishop, of Cant.
that now is, with our other Bishops and Ministers, can derive them personal
succession and Ordination from the Sea and Popes of Rome.
Dr. Pocklingtons, Sunday no Sabbath, P. 2. Ou^ Diocesan can derive himself
the successor of an Apostle: it is Saint Austins resolution, Successio
Episcoporum ab ipsa sede Petri, is that which among other things by him named,
keeps us in gremio Ecclesiae, and Subjects us to our Bishops Jurisdiction.

Page 47. Their vanity may appear that against all Antiquity make fools
believe, Saint Peter was never at Rome; making the succession of Bishops and
truth of the Latin Churches, as questionable as the Centurists orders.

Page 48. Reckon up your Priests who succeeded one another after Saint Peter in
his Chair, if you will be esteemed Members of the Church; Hereby we may by
Gods mercy make good the truth of our Church. For we are able lineally to set
down the succession of our Bishops from Saint Peter to Saint Gregory, and from
him to our first Archbishop Saint Austin, our English Apostle, as Bishop
Goodwin calls him, downward to his Grace NOW, that sits in his Chair, Primate
of all England and Metropolitan.

Which he thus seconds in his Altar Christianum, Page 45. Saint Peter's Chair
in Rome, succession of Bishops in the Church of England, etc.

Page 47. Though says (Saint Austin) you slanderously call the Chair in other
Churches, Cathedram Pestilenti^ae, what cause has the Church of Rome given you
to say so of it, In qua Petrus sedet, et in qua hodie Anastasius sedet?

The very note whereby Heritickes were known from Catholics was, that
Catholics could show their Churches and the very Chaires in them, wherein
there was not only a morrall succession in purity of Faith and manners, but a
local succession of Bishops continued even from the Apostles times, which
Heretics could not show, and therefore were hereby convinced to be such, and
so put to shame and confounded.

Page 48. He recons up those that had succeeded the Apostles, Saint Peter, and
Saint Paul, in the Church of Rome.

Page 49. Novatian is neither Bishop nor Member of the Church (says Saint
Cyprian) because he cannot prove his succession, according to Apostolical
Tradition.

If in all this time there were no material Churches, then there could be no
material Chair, wherein their Bishops were enthronized; and if no Chair,
then no real Inthronization, then no personal succession from the Apostles,
whereby the right faith was derived from God the Father to his Son, nor from
the Son to his Apostles, nor from the Apostles to succeding Bishops. Those
that deprive us of the benefit of this Apostolical Tradition, pluck one
special staff out of our hands, whereby we stay our selves from falling from
the true Catholic Church, and beat all Heretics out of our Communion.
Miserable were we if he that NOW sits Arch Bishop of CANTERBVRY, could not
derive his succession from Saint Augustine St. Augustine: from Saint Gregory:
Saint Gregory, from Saint Peter for he that remembers whom he succeeds will
doubtless endeavor, and pray to be heir to their virtues, as well as
possessor to their places. What a comfort is this to his Grace, NOTE.
and to all those that receive consecration from him, and to all those that
they shall ordain.

Page 51. Tell us when and from whence you come? and what you make your selves
to do in the Church that are no Sons of the Church? We can with Saint Iraeneus
point you to the time of your coming in. You Cartwright and your brood came
in, as most Sabbatarians did, under Archbishop Whitgift, and your Ames and
Brightman, with your Laodiceans came in under Archbishop Bancroft, and you
Vicars and our Cotton with his fugitives, came in, or rather went out under
Archbishop Abbot.

Page 144. I shall begin with my self. I had my Ordination from Bishop Dove he
had his Consecration from Archbishop Whitgift, and the Archbishop his from the
undoubted successors of Saint Peter.

Doctor Heylin his Moderat Answer to Mr. Burton, Page 72. Write; If you have
any other Pedigree, as perhaps you have from Wickliffe, Hus, the Albig^enses,
and the rest which you use to boast of, keep it to your self, non tali
auxilio, the Church of England has not need of so poor a shift.

Page 68. The next thing that offends you and you clamor as if that they
claim a visible and perpetual succession down from St. Peter to Pope Gregory,
from him by Austin the Monk, first Archbishop of Cant. unto his Grace now being
and sic de caeteris; That Gregory sent Austin into England to convert the
Saxons and made him first Archbishop of the English, is generally delivered by
all our writers. Finally that my Lord the Archbishop that now is, is lineally
descended in a most fair and constant tenor of succession you shall easily
find, if you consult the learned labors of Master Francis Mason de Ministerio
Anglicano. The Papists would extremely thank you, and think you borne into the
World for their special comfort could you but tell him how to disprove that
lineall succession of our Prelates, which is there laid dowe.

By Mountague his Gagge page 49. The Church has ever been visibe. In England
especially; how can this fellow impute invisibility to us who claim and prove
a succession.

25. That Sunday is no Sabbath, nor of divine institution; that the strict
sanctification of it, is Jewish, superstitious, and Rabbinicall. That
May-games, Wakes, Revells, Dancing, Interludes with other sports and pastimes
are not only lawful, but convenient and necessary thereon, not to be
restrained but encouraged, and the Kings Declaration to that purpose, most
pious and Religious. That two hours only of it, (viz. The time of publik
service, and sermons) are to be kept holy; and that the residue may be spent in
Recreations, or ordinary works of our calling. That the Lords day Sabbath was
never heard of in the world till Dr. Bounds days: That the Sabbath is not
morrall.
THis is the subject matter of many whole late printed Books against the
morallity and strict observation of the Lord's Day Sabbath: we shall instance
only in some few; beginning with Doctor Pocklington, in his Sunday no Sabbath;
where thus he most scandalously and profanely writes page 6.

What shall we think then of Knox and Whittingham, and their fellows, that in
their letter to Calvin depart from the constitution, Ordinance and practice of
the Apostles and Apostolic men, and call not this day the Lords day, or
Sunday, but with the piety of Jeroboam, make such a day of it as they have
devised in their own hearts, to serve their own turn, and Anabaptising of it
after the mind of some Jew, hired to be the God Father, therefore call it the
Sabbath page 7. This name Sabbath is not a bare name or like a spot in their
foreheades to know Labans sheep from Jacobs, but indeed it is a Mystery of
Iniquity intended against the Church, etc. page 13. But what do I speak de
integro die of a whole day? do but that in keeping the Lords day which the
Widow did in her Alms that gave two mites; sic tu duas horas, so give the
Lord two hours: this if you do not, beware you lose not integroru mannorum
labores, the Labors of many whole years, Page 20. Others also for the Plots
sake, must uphold the name of Sabbath that stalking behind it, they may shoot
against the services appointed for the Lords day. Hence it is, that some for
want of wit, too much adore the Sabbath as an Image dropped down from Jupiter,
and cry before it as they did before the Golden Calfe, This is an holy day unto
the Lord; whereas it is indeed the great Diana of the Ephesians, as they use
it, whereby the minds of their Proselites are so perplexed and bewitched, that
they cannot resolve, whether the sin be greater to bowl shoot or dance on
their Sabbath, then to commit Murder, or the Father to cut the throat of his
own child. All which doubts would soon be resolved by plucking of the Vizard
of the Sabbath from the face of the Lords day which does as well and truly
become it, as the Crown of Thorns did the Lord himself. This was plotted to
expose him to damnable dirision, and that was plotted to impose on it
detestable superstition; yet to die for it they will call it a Sabbath,
presuming in their zealous ignorance of guiltfull zeal to be thought to speak
the Scripture phrase, when indeed the Dregs of Ashdod flow from their Mouths,
p. 21. With us the Sabbath is Saturday, and no day else, no ancient Father, nay
no learned man, Heathen or Christian took it otherwise from the beginning of
the world till the beginning of their Schism in 1554. page 22. Many that see
so little benefit will be sucked out of the constitutions of the Apostles
practice and tradition of holy Church, Doctrine of Godly and learned Fathers,
that they have got themselves heaps of Teachers, that to serve their own
turns will call and keep the Lords day, as a Sabbath, and so profane it with
such outcries, that the voice of truth will become silent: but with Moses,
liberavi animam meam.

Doctor Peter Heylin in his History of the Sabbath, dedicated to his Majesty,
and printed by the Archbishops special approbation, is every way as profane
and bitter against the morality, and strict observation of the Lord's Day
Sabbath, as Pocklinton; we shall instance but in a Passage or two: The first is
in his Epistle to the Reader, before the second Book of his History, in these
terms.

And this part we have called the History of the Sabbath too; although the
institution of the Lords day, and entertainment of the same in all times and
ages since that Institution, be the chief thing whereof it treats: for being
it is said by some, that the Lords Day succeeded by the Lords appointment, into
the place and rights of the Jewish Sabbath, this book was wholly to be spent
in the search thereof, whether in all, or any Ages of the Church, either such
doctrine had been preached, or such practice pressed, upon the Consciences of
Gods people. And search indeed we did with all care and diligence to see if we
could find a Sabbath in any evidence of Scripture, or writing of the holy
Fathers, or edicts of Emperors, or decrees of Counsels, or finally in any of
the public Acts and Monuments of the Christian Church, but after several
searches made, upon the Alias, and the Pluries we still return, Non est
inventus: and thereupon resolve in the Poets language. Et quod non invenit
usquam, esse putet nusquam; that which is no where to be found, may very
strongly be concluded not to be at all. Buxdorfius in the eleventh Chapter of
his Synagoga Judaica, out of Antonius Margarita tells of the Jews. Quod die
Sabbatino, praeter animam consuetam, praediti sunt and alia, that on the
Sabbath day, they are persuaded that they have an extraordinary soul infused
into them, which does enlarge their hearts, and rouse up their spirits. Ut
Sabbatum multo honorabilius peragere possint, that they may celebrate the
Sabbath with the greater honor. And though this Sabbatharie soul, may by a
Pythagoricall. (...) seem to have transimigrated from the Jews, into the
bodies of some Christians, in these latter days, yet I am able to give my
self good hopes, that by presenting to their view, the constant practice of
Gods Church in all times before, and the consent of all Gods Churches at this
present, they may be dispossesed thereof without great difficulties. It is but
anima superflua, as Buxdorfius calls it, and may be better spared then kept,
because superfluous.

To which we shall annex these passages in the eight Chapter of this his
second Book Sect. 7. page 249. etc. Thus upon search made and full examination
of all parties, we find no Lords Day-Sabbath in the Book of Homilies no nor
in any writings of particular men, in more then thirty three years after the
Homilies were published. Then reciting Doctor Bounds opinion in his book of the
Sabbath page 211. All lawful pleasures and honest Recreations, as Shooting,
Fencing, Bowling, which are permitted on other days; were on this day to be
forborne No man to speak or talk of pleasures, or any worldly matter, (he
says) Most Magisterially determined, more like a Jewish Rabbi, then a
Christian Doctor. Yet Romish and Rabbinicall though this doctrine were, it
carried a fair face and show of Piety, at least in the opinion of the Common
people, etc. Sect. 8. p. 255. 256. We may perceive by this, that their intent
from the beginning, was to cry down the Holy Days, as superstitious, Popish
Ordinances; that their new found Sabbath being placed alone, (and Sabbath now
it must be called) might become more eminent. Nor were the other, though more
private effects thereof, of less dangerous nature; the people being so
ensnared with these new devices, and pressed with rigor more then Jewish; that
certainly they are in as bad a condition, as were the Israelites of old, when
they were captivated and kept under by the Scribes and Pharisees. Some I have
known, (for in this point, I will say nothing, without good assurance) who in
a furious kind of Zeal, like the mad Prophetess in the Poet, have run into
the open streets, yea, and searched private houses too, to look for such as
spent those hours, on the Lords Day, in lawful pastimes, which were not
destinate by the Church, to Gods public service, and having found them out,
scattered the company, and brake the Instruments; and, if my memory fail me
not, the Musicians head too: and, which is more, they thought that they were
bound in Conscience so to do, etc. And sect. 9. p. 258. He most profanely and
scurrilously styles the Lord's Day; The NEW SAINT SABBATH; And sect. 13. page
269. etc. he concludes thus. Nay which is more, it was so publicly avowed and
printed, by one who had no calling to interpret laws, except the provocation
of his own ill spirit, That Dancing on the Lord's Day, was an unlawful pastime,
punishable by the Statute of 1 Carl. c. 1. which intended (so he says) to
suppress Dancing on the Lords Day as well as Beare-Baiting Bull-Baiting,
Enterludes and common Plays, which were not then so rise and common, as
dancing, when this Law was made. Things being at this height, it pleased His
Excellent Majesty, Observing, as he says himself, how much his people were
debarred of Recreation, and finding in some Counties, that The Kings
Declaration.
under the pretense of taking away of abuses, there had bin a general
forbidding, not only of ordinary meetings, but of the Feasts of the Dedication
of Churches, commonly called Wakes, to ratify and publish the Declaration of
His Majesty's Father, before remembered: Adding, that all those feasts, with
others should be observed; and that all Neighborhood, and freedom with
manlike and lawful exercises, be therein used; commanding all the Justices of
Assize, in the several Circuits, to see that no man do trouble or molest any
of his Loyal and dutiful people, in or for their lawful recreations, having
first done their duty to God and continuing in obedience unto His Majesty and
his Laws: and further, that publication thereof be made by Order from the
Bishops, through all the parishes of their several Diocesses respectively.

Thus did it please His Excellent and Sacred Majesty to publish His most pious
and Religious purpose, of opening to his Loyal people the liberty of the Day,
which the day allowed of, and which He should have said, No Christian state nor
Church rather.
all Christian States and Churches in all times before had never questioned:
withal, of shutting up that door, whereat no less than Judaisme would in
fine bave entered, and so in time have overran the fairest and most beautiful
Church, at this day in Christendom, And certainly, it was a pious and Princely
Act, nothing inferior unto that of Constantine or any other Christian King, or
Emperor, NOTE.
before remembered; it being no less pious in it self considered, to keep the
holy days free from Superstition, than to preserve them from Profaneness;
especially considering, that permission of lawful pleasures, is no less
proper to a festival, then restraint from labor. Nay, of the two it is more
ancient: for in his time, Tertullian tells us, that they did diem Solis
laetitiae indulgere, devote the Sunday partly unto mirth and recreation, not to
devotion altogether; when in an hundred years after Tertullians time, there
was no law or constitution to restrain men from labor this day, in the
Christian Church. Yet did not his most Excellent Majesty find such obedience
in some men and such as should have been examples unto their flocks, as his
most Christian purpose did deserve: there being some, so settled in the opinion
of a Sabbath Day, (a day not heard of in the Church of Christ 40. years ago,)
that they choose rather to deprive the Church of their pains and ministry,
than yield unto His Majesty's just commands, for whose sakes specially, next
unto my duty unto God, my Sovereign and the Church my Mother, I have employed
my time and Studdies, to compose this History: that they may see therein in
brief, the practice of Gods Church in the times before them, and frame
themselves to do thereafter; casting aside those errors in the which they are,
and walking in the way which they ought to travel; which way when all is done
will be Via Regia, the Kings High way; as that which is most safe and of best
assurance, because most travelers by Gods people. Our private paths do lead
us often into error, and sometimes also into danger, And therefore I beseech
all those who have offended in that kind, to lay aside their passions and their
private interests, if any are that way misguided; as also not to shut their
eyes against those truths, which are presented to them for their information;
that so the King may have the honor of their due Obedience; the Church the
comfort of their labors, and conformable ministry. For to what purpose should
they hope, to be ennobled for their sufferings, in so bad a cause which
neither has the Doctrine, of the Scriptures to authorize it, or practice of
the Church of God, the best expositer of the Scripture, to confirm, and
countenance it? or to be counted constant to or in their first conclusions,
having such weak and dangerous premises to support the same; since constancy
not rightly grounded, is at best but obstinacy, and many times does end in
Heresy. Once again therefore I exhort them even in Gods name, whose Ministers
they are, and unto whom they are to give up an account of their employment; and
in the Kings Name, whom as Gods Deputy they are bound to obey, not for wrath
only, but for Conscience sake, and in the Churches name, whose peace they are
to studdy above all things else, and their own names, lastly, whom it most
concerns, that they desist, and go not forward in this disobedience, lest a
worse mischief fall upon them. For my part, I have done my best, so far to
give them satisfaction in this present point, (so far forth as the nature of
an History would permit) as they might think it no disparagment to alter their
opinions, and desert their errors, and change their resolutions: since in so
doing, they shall conform themselves unto the practice of Gods Church in all
times and Ages.

This profane Doctor in his Epistle before Doctor Prideaux, his Lecture of the
Sabbath: and in his Moderate Answer to Master Burton, page 50. to 56. 76. 80.
81. 110, 112. has many passages to the same effect, against the Sabbaths
morality, the strict entire Sanctification of the Lord's Day; in yea
Justification of the Book of sports, and of the Archbishops and Bishops
silencing, excommunicating, censuting those who refused to read it to the
people.

The like passages we meet with in Bishop Whites, Doctor Primrose, and Master
Joronfides Treatises of the Sabbath, in Christopher Dew his Innovations
unjustly charged, chap. 10. 11, 12. in Edmund Reeve his Communion Book
Catechism expounded; wherein the Piety, Necessity, and Utility of His
Majesty's Declaration for sports is extolled above Elah page 90. to 108. that
these Pages were afterward torn out of the Book for very shame by the
Stationer, they were so vile, licentious, and distasteful to most.

26. That Reading is Preaching: that Preaching is only for extraordinary
persons and times, not for ordinary Ministers and seasons: that one Sermon a
month is better than two every Lord's Day. That Bishops are not bound to
preach, at least, not so often as other Ministers, by reason of their great
temporal employments and Court attendance, etc. And that Saint PAUL read
Homilies.
SHelfords five Treatises, page 35. 36. After this a wise and discreet Sermon
not made by every Minister, but by a man of Reading and discretion, right well
beseems this holy place.

Page 74. Some Parishes (as men say) have good Preachers but bad livers, and
some have mean Preachers or Readers, but good livers, which of these are best?
The good living Minister what he builds by his reading of Gods Word, Prayer,
and administration of the Sacraments pulls not down again, but upholds all
with his good life, therefore he is far the best Preacher. Page 77. Have thou
not thy Minister to do this for thee every Sunday and Holy Day in Catechizing:
But thou likest not of this because it is not a Sermon, how provest thou that?
because it is not spoken out of the Pulpit, nor delivered out of a Text, etc.

Page 78. The very reading of it is preaching, and not only preaching, but
lively and working preaching, working upon men's souls to grace and goodness.
And that Gods Word read unto us, is preaching, you shall find it expressed in,
Acts 15. 21.

P. 82. What need is there of Preaching? The besotted negligence of our
delicate Puritans is that which makes them to run so after Sermons. God speaks
unto thee every Holy Day by his own Word.

Page 91. There is another kind of preaching which is not fit for every kind
of Minister, but for extraordinary and excellent men, called by God and the
Church to reform errors and abuses, or to promulge to the world new Laws and
Cannons, And as this kind is to be performed by extraordinary men, so it is
not always so needful but only when necessity requires, for when things are
settled, there needs no more settling but only preserving. We ought not to have
many Moseses, nor many Evangelists, nor many Apostles.

Page 93. The ancient and true doctrine of the Primitive Church by set ed
Articles is restored; therefore this extraordinary kind is not now so
necessary, except it be upon some notorious Crimes breaking in upon our
people, or some exorbitances of green heads, breaching the froth of their own
brains, which will hardly be reformed until many of these be unfurnished of
their Licenses, and those that are permitted be restrained to certain times
and seasons. For better were it for our Church and people to have but one
Sermon well premeditated in a month (which is insinuated by the Canon) then
two upon a day proceeding from a rolling brain and mouth without due
preparation. NOTE.

unseasoned doctrine: Having showed this kind of preaching to be extraordinary
for special men, special times and occasions: It follows, that the preaching
by reading is the ordinary preaching: This was the ordinary preaching in our
Church before King Henry the eight.

read, or one that he read and another made: An Homily, I am sure it was, and
it may be made by all the Apostles or the chief of the Apostles. Wherefore I

the word used in the Text that when he read them, and no more but read them

P. 34. If then Reading of Decrees of the Apostles, be preaching, and used for
the profit and peace of the Church, and for the establishing of them in the
faith, then surely is reading of Lessons, Epistle and Gospel, much more
preaching, and the Reader is a Preacher.

Edmond Reeve his Communion Catechism expounded, page 74. They are said to
make an Idol of Preaching, which place even the whole Christian Religion in
hearing of Sermons; and in Comparison of preaching forth of a Pulpit, they
nothing or very little account of the Common Prayer, and the reading of the
Homilies.

Page 77. To preach unto a Congregation on every Sunday is the proper work of
Pastors. But the Bishops the Fathers in God having received the greatest
measure of the holy Ghost are to be employed besides, in the greatest
ministerial matters of the Church, as to ordain Priests and Deacons, Christ's
holy Ordinance of Consecration. P. 78. It is their work to Consecrate
Churchces, etc. To require all the Eccleasticall Laws of the Kingdom, to be
observed, and to have to do in the affairs of the Commonwealth. Page 79.
Many more are the employments pertainng to their high order, and calling; by
reason whereof they may but at some certain times preach unto Congregations,
when as they shall see occasion.

Page 94. Holy Church has ordained, that in the Sunday afternoon, there
should be taught her fundamental Catechism, her Laws, her Canons, her
Constitutions should be read, the Common Prayer with the Lessons be said, and
that the Homilies should be read also.

27. That Bishops pretended Lordly superiority, in point of Order and
Jurisdiction, over and above other Ministers, is of Divine right and
institution, and that there neither is nor can be any true Church, where there
are no such Lordly domineering Bishops.
THis Archbishop of Canterbury himself determines thus in his Speech in
Star Chamber, page 67. This I will say and abide by it, that the calling of
Bishops is Iure Divino, by divine Right: and this I say in as direct opposition
to the Church of Rome as to the Puritan humor; and I say further, that from
the Apostles times in all ages, in all places the Church of Christ was governed
by Bishops. Now this is made by these men as if it were contra Regem, against
the King in fight or in power: But that's a mere ignorant shift, for our being
Bishops Iure Divino by divine Right, takes nothing from the Kings Right.

In his Reply to Fisher, page 176. He positively affirms, That ubi non est
sacerdos, non est Ecclesiae St. Hierom: And in that place most manifest it is
that by Sacerdos, Saint Jerome means a Bishop: So even with him, NO BISHOP AND
NOE CHVRCH.

Doctor Heylin in his Moderate Answer to Mr. Burton, page 65. writes thus, by
the Archbishops appointment: You are much offended with the Prelates that they
will needs be Lord Bishops Iure Divino, page 66. Your first exception is, That
the Episcopal Authority is claimed from Christ: and that some of the Bishops
said in the High Commission. That if they could not prove it, they would cast
away their Rochetts: this is no more then what had formerly been said in the
Conference at Hampton Court, when on occasion of S. Hieroms saying, that a
Bishop was not divinae Ordinationis; the Bishop of London (Doctor Bancroft)
interposed; that unless he could prove his ordination lawful out of the
Scriptures, he would not be a Bishop four hours, page 67. 70. Who is it,
which of our Divines that holds Episcopal Authority to be derived from any
other fountain then that of Christ and his Apostles? If any such there be, he
is one of yours: Traverse, and Cartwright and the rest of your Prodecessors:
Men never owned for hers by the Church of England: Geneva had their hearts, we
their bodies only.

This theme of Bishops superiority Iure Divino, over other Ministers; was
professedly maintained by Bishop White, in his Preface to his Treatise of the
Sabbath against Braburne by Christopher Dow in his Innovations unjustly charged
chap. 19. p. 170. etc. by John Swan in his Red debitum, Chap. 2. sect 2. p.
161. to 172. (asserting peremtorily, that the Hierarchy of the Bishops is Iure
Divino) with sundry others in their printed Books yea: publikly affirmed with
much confidence by both our Archbishops, with other Prelates in the
Star Chamber and High Commission: maintained publicly in the Divinity Schools
in both our Universities, and asserted almost in every Pulpit, at leastwise in
Cathedralls. But this Erroneous Position being satisfactorily refuted, and
palpably displayed to all the world by Doctor Bastwicke, in his Flagellum,
Apologeticus ad Praesules Anglicano and by Master Prynne, in his Vnbishoping of
Timothy and Titus; his Brevia and Catalogue of Writers in all ages refuting
this position of theirs; and by the Presbiterians in Scotland the Archbishop
and his Confederate Prelaticall Brethren were so hardly put to it that they
seriously mustred up all their policy, learning power, to maintain their
Episcopal Jurisdiction to be of divine right: Whereupon having engaged his
Majesty and his Privy Council to maintain it by the Sword in the Field he
encouraged Doctor Hall, bishop of Exeter (very prone of himself to undertake
such an enterprise) to defend it with his smooth Rhetorical pen in the
Press. This Bishop upon his motion and request readily undertakes the designed
service, compiles his Book, entitled, Episcopacy by divine Right; the written
Copy whereof he sent to the Archbishop, submitting it wholly to his power, to
dispose of it at his pleasure, or alter any thing therein which he or his
Chaplains should deem meet: This Treatisie was carefully read over by the
Arch bishop himself and his Chaplains line by line, who altered it in some
places, and then authorized it for the Press. The particulars concerning the
cause and grounds of compling it with the Bishops whole pretended Plot how to
support their tottering Hierarchy is fully related in the ensuing Letters of
Bishop Hall to the Archbishop, and of the Archbishop to him, all sound and
seized on in his Study at Lambheth.

We shall transcribe all these Letters according to their several dates, the
first of them (extracted out of the very original) is this.

MOst Reverend Father in God, and my most Honorable Lord, I have received your
Graces Answer in one to my three last, humbly thanking your Grace for your
noble favors to that well deserving Petitioner, Master Edgcombe, whom I
recommended to your Graces notice. For Ashbrenton, I gave order for a speedy
satisfaction, and make account to receive it, ere the closure of this letter.

Yesternight I had the view of the Acts of the late Scottish Assembly, which I
could not read without much indignation, in seeing the only true, and ancient
Government of the Church so dispitefully trod upon by ignorant Factionists.
Upon the perusal whereof, I begin to think it were pity and shame they should
carry it away so, and that so public an insolence could admit of none but a
more public remedy, and may I be bold to impart unto your Grace what my
thoughts were for some ease of this wrong, and mittegation of the scandal
under the hope of your Graces pardon, I shall not stick to discover them in
this secret and fearelesse paper, humbly leaving them to your Graces favorable
censure, although indeed, I should have needed a larger Preface to so bold an
attempt. Since then for his Majesty to right the Church by the Sword, as the
case now stands, is neither fit for our hopes nor our wishes (which were no
other in so desperate a Schism, then to reconquer his own with much Charge,
danger and blood) we thought it might be seasonable, safe and happy to employ
the spiritual sword, the remedy which the Church has ever wont to make use of
in such occasions, with blessed success,) I thought therefore if through your
Graces mediation it might please his sacred Majesty to cause a General Synod
of the whole three Kingdoms to be indicted, wherein all the Reverend Bishops
and chief of the learned, and dignified Clergy, and the professors, and some
other eminent Doctors of all the Universities in all the said Kingdoms may be
assembled to pass their judgment (after free and full expectation) of these
Schismatic points, determined thus proudly, and rashly by our Northen
Neighbors, it could not but sort to excellent effect, for so they might be
convinced of their absurd errors; or at least publicly before all the world,
censured and condemned for what they are: and if they have any Remainders of
shame they shall be made to blush at their own miserable transportation. This
would be some comfort to those exiled Bishops, who put Holy Island (as I hear
to the same use whereto it was employed at the first Plantation of the Gospel
(to be a receptacle of persecuted Prelates) that they should see their cause
taken to heart by the whole Church under his Majesty's dominions, and why
should we not think that the presence and Authority of your Grace; with that
eminent and learned Primate of Armagh, and so many other grave and renouned
Prelates, seconded by so irresistible powers of the learning and Judgment of so
many assistant Divines (of great note and worth) cannot choose but certainly
confound these heady and ignorant opposers of Government and good Order, and
give great satisfaction to the world, who seeing the errors and groundless
proceedings of these men, shall hiss them out of countenance, neither can they
shelter themselves under the examples of other Churches in France and
Netherlands, etc. Since necessity has long ago cast them into that condition
which these men (after establishment in the right form) have wilfully drawn
upon themselves, with an impetuous exclusion of a settled government. And
certainly my Lord, me thinks there should be a kind of necessity in this
course, since not some few, but the whole Church of Scotland has thus broken
out into Schism, and shamed both it self and the Gospel, and without some
timely prevention the mischief may yet grow further; whereas this way it may
be (at the least) choakingly convinced and seasonably checked. Neither need
the charge hereof be great to his Majesty's coffers, since the burden of the
Commissioners may be laid upon the several Diocese from whence they are sent.
Your Grace sees whither my zeal has carried me. If I have been to bold and
forward in thus presuming, I humbly crave the pardon of your Grace, which has
been extended to greater errors: I hope a good heart will excuse all: the best
wishes whereof are truly vowed, and duly paid to your Grace,

By your Graces in all faithful Observance to Command. JOS. EXON.
Exon. Pal. Sept. 28.

Which Letter was thus directed. To the most Reverend and most Honorable my
singular good Lord; My Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, Primate of all
England, and Metropolitan, Chancellor of Oxford, and one of the Lords of his
Majesty's most honorable Privy Council, present these.

What was done upon this Letter, and how the Archbishop took occasion from it
to engage Bishop Hall, to write in defense of Episcopal Superiority by Divine
Right and Institution, will appear by the Bishops next Letter to this
Arch-Prelate, the Original whereof we have under Bishop Halls own hand and
Seal.

May it please your Grace,
I Was not only glad but almost proud of your Graces acceptance of my poor but
bold motion, which that it found favor in his Majesty's eyes, upon your Graces
recommendation, was as much above my hope, as above the possibility of my
thankfulness. I do most humbly rest in the grounds of his Majesty's most wise
and just resolution, although that which I propounded was not in any aim at
the Reclamation of those stiff Spirits, but at their conviction and shaming,
together with the satisfaction and settling of any distempered or wavering
minds, of any contentious person, at home or abroad. But since it has pleased
his Majesty to lay aside that thought, I am most submissively silent; As for
that motion (which coming from your Graces hand is no less in my construction
then a command) of my undertaking this great task, of writing a satisfactory
discourse in this subject: I beseech your Grace to give me leave to say, it
does too much overvalue me. If your Grace did but know my great weakness, so
well as I know my little strength, your Grace would not have singled me out for
so high and noble an undertaking. I confess in an holy zeal to the cause, no
man shall outstrip me, in abilities too many: yet since Note.
it has pleased your Grace to honor me so far, as to think me capable,
and worthy of such an employment, I shall most gladly (without prejudice to any
more able pains) endeavor my best this way. But would your Grace be pleased
to give me leave to suggest another Motion. I think I should intimate that
which would not a little advance the success of this great service. Single
labors will be easily passed over with neglect, what will the Vulgar be more
apt to say then, This is but one Doctors judgment? Vis unita fortior. Might it
therefore please your Grace to single out and Empannell a whole Jury of learned
Bishops and Divines to join together in this subject, it could not choose but
sway much with the world.

And since I have taken the boldness to move so far, will your Grace give
me leave (out of the zealous intention of my thoughts upon the speed of this
notable service) to propound some further specialty; If therefore in Ireland,
the Lord Primate, the Bishop of Kilmore, the Bishop of Down, and Conner, men
(as your Grace best knows) of singular note in the Church. Here at home, my
Lord Bishop of Durham, and Bishop of Salisbury, and if your Grace shall think
me worthy to come in the arreare of these great and famous Prelates, I shall
not fail of my best. With them the Professors and some other eminent Doctors
in the name of both Universities, and three or four of the Bishops and Doctors
of Scotland, shall be enjoined by your Grace to express their judgments
fully, concerning these two Heads of Episcopacy, and Lay Prebytery; and to
Print them together. It will be a work that will carry in it such authority
and satisfaction, as will give great contentment to the world, and carry in it
a strong rebuke of the Aversaries: And if your Graces reason and resolution
should so lead you, as to be seen in the head of this Learned Squadron; the
work would bear not much less sway, then if it were a Synodicall Act;
Neither would I wish that each of these should write a Volume of this matter;
but succinctly, (though fully and clearly) declare themselves in these
particulars, with such evidence of Scripture, Antiquity, and Reasons, as may
most convince. But whether these be done in Thesi, or Hypothesi; whether in way
of Paroenesis, or Apology, or reproof, I humbly submit to your Graces
judgment and direction. I beseech your Grace pardon this well-meant
presumption, and make account of the daily Devotions of

Your Graces in all faithful observance to Command. Jos. Exon.
Exon. Pal. Oct. 12. 1639. After I had sent away my Letters of complaint
concerning Coxe, the man came to me, and upon our second and third conference,
began to relent: and finding that I had sent up his Sermon to your Grace,
resolved to wait voluntarily upon your Grace, so as I hope your Grace shall at
once hear of his offense and submission If so, a free and public recantation
would do more good here, then his exorbitance has done hurt; he has been
usque ad invidiam, conformable, and is a sufficient Scholar, and of
unblameable conversation otherwise; I humbly leave him to your Graces either

This Letter was thus Superscribed. To the most Reverend Father in God, my ever
most honored Lord, my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, Primate of all
England, and Metropolitan, Chancellor of Oxford, and one of the Lords of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Counsel, present these.

And thus Endorsed with the Archbishops own hand. Rec. Oct. 16. 1639. The
Bishop of Exeter. That more then one should write in defense of Episcopacie
against the Scots.

To this Letter the Archbishop returned an Answer; thereupon Bishop Hall
acquaints him in his next Letter, with the whole Platform and Subject matter
of his Book, which he submits to his judgment, craving his direction therein,
as this Letter under his hand and seal will manifest.

Most Reverend and my most Honorable good Lord,
Notwithstanding the importunity of your Graces manifold occasions, I received
(two days since) two Letters from your Grace at once, whereof the one
signified his Majesty's pleasure for the provision of a Benefice within my
gift, for one of our poor exild neighbors, which I do most willingly
embrace, as out of my own true commiseration, so much more out of my obedience
to my Gracious Master, but for the time as your Grace knows, (...). In the
other, I do first meet with your Graces merciful and Fatherly proceedings
with one of my strayed Charge, Master Cox. I was in some hope of his relenting,
ere I left him, if (as I perceive) the work be perfected by your Graces
effectual councels, it will be happy for him, and great contentment to his
friends; in regard both of his former conformity, and great Charge. He is not
yet come down, an hearty Recantation will redeem all. In the next place, I
find your Graces zealous care of the success of this work, which upon your
Graces motion, I have heartily undertaken; wherein for the not applying of so
many hands, I do humbly rest in his Majesty's most wise determination,
although Note.
the danger of varience might have received a prevention, since the whole work
must have had one rule, and have come under one rule and censure, but this
course is both more sure and no less effectual.

For that which here concerns my self; I acknowledge my self much bound to
your Grace for your good opinion of my ability for so great a shocke, which I
shall defer to improve to the utmost; and whereas it is thought requisite,
that I should set down those simple Propositions, which I shall undertake to
make good in this work: I do most willingly entertain it, and therefore
shall make bold to acquaint your Grace with the whole plot of my intendment in
this service, humbly yielding it up to your Graces Censure, or better advise.

And first my purpose is, (wherein I do somewhat please my self, if your
Grace be so pleased) to take my rise from the 8th. Section of their last Synod
of Edinborough, wherein Master George Graham is said to come in, and condemn
Episcopacie, and to profess his repentance, which is there appointed to be
recorded.

Hereupon, I mean to take this Mr. George to task, and somewhat warmely to
expostulate the matter with him, and when I shall, after a fervent preface,
have driven him from the refuge of conforming herein to other (which I think I
shall do to purpose) I shall then deal with him alone, and address my self
to argue the case with him, and the Faction (whom I shall make my adversary;
the Faction, and not the Church of Scotland.) And shall undertake to make good
these two points, as I conceive, both full and proper for the occasion.



Postulata, some 15. or 16 in number, as the grounds of my following Arc, such
as these; 1. That Government which was of Apostolical Institution, cannot be
denied to be of Divine Institution. 2. Not only that Government which was
directly commanded and enacted, but also that which was practiced, and
recommended by the Apostles to the Church, must justly pass for an
Apostolical Institution. 3. That which the Apostles by Divine inspiration
instituted, was not for the present time but for continuance. 4. The Universal
practice of the Church immediately succeeding the Apostles, is the best and
surest Commentary upon the practice of the Apostles, or of their expressions.
5. We may not entertain so irreverent an opinion of the Saints and Fathers of
the Primitive Church, that they who were the immediate Successors of the
Apostles, would, or durst set up a Government, either faulty, or of their own
heads. 6. If they would have been so presumptuous, yet they could not have
diffused one uniforme order of Government through the whole world, in so short
a space. 7. The Ancient Histories of the Church, and Writings of the eldest
Fathers are rather to be believed, in the report of the Primitive of the Church
Government, then those of this last Age. 8. Those, whom the Ancient Church of
God, and the holy and Orthodox Fathers condemned for Errors, or Heresies, are
not fit to be followed as Authors of our opinion or practice for Church
government. 9 The accession of honorable Titles or Privileges makes no
difference in the substance of the Calling. 10. Those Scriptures wherein any
new form of Government is grounded, had need to be very clear, and
unquestionable, and more evident then those, whereon the former rejected Policy
is raised. 11. If that Order which they say Christ set for the government of
his Church (which they call the Kingdom and Ordinance of Christ) be but one
and undoubted, then it would and should have been ere this agreed upon against
them; what, and which it is. 12. If this (which they pretend) be the Kingdom
and Ordinance of Christ, then if any essential part of it be wanting, Christ's
Kingdom is not in that Church erected. 13. Christian policy requires no
impossible or absurd thing. 14. Those truths which are new, and unheard off in
all ages of the Church (in many and essential points) are well worthy to be
suspected. 15. To depart from the practice of the universal Church of Christ,
(ever from the Apostles times) and to be take our selves voluntarily to a new
form lately taken up, cannot but be odious and highly scandalous. Upon these
grounds laid, I shall come to subsume; and shall both convince the Faction in
aberration from them, and fully prove the two points intended; After which,
with some observations and Queries, I shall shut up in a vehement Exhortation
both to them, and to our own; if it may be for the reducing of the one, if
not, yet to the settling of the other. If your Grace shall approve of this
Plot-forme, I shall accordingly prosecute it; if your Grace shall think fit to
alter or detract, or add ought, I am as ready to submit, with pardon craved
for this length, and the unfeigned vows of my hearty prayers, I take leave, and
am,

Your Graces in all officious observance to command, JOS: EXON.
Exon. Pal. Oct. 28.

Which Letter was thus indorsed with the Archbishops own hand; Received
November 1. 1639. The Bishop of Exeter his account of the Heads of his book
Intended for Episcopacy against the Scots.

To this Letter the Archbishop returned this ensuing Answer under his own hand,
wherein he fully expresses his opinion, both concerning Episcopacy and
Presbytery.

THe rest of your Lordships Letter is fitter to be answered by my own hand, and
so you have it. And since you are pleased so worthyly and brother-like to
acquaint me with the whole plot of your intended work, and to yield it up to
my censure and better advice, (so you are pleased to write) I do not only
thank you, heartily for it, but shall in the same Brotherly way and with
equal freedom put some few Animad versions, such as occure on the sudden, to
your further Consideration, aiming at nothing but what you do, the perfection
of the work, in which so much is concerned.

And first for Mr. George Graham, I leave you free to work upon his baseness
and his ignorance as you please, assuring my self that you will not depart from
the gravity of your self, or the cause therein. Next you say in the first
head; That Episcopacy is an ancient, Holy and Divine institution. It must needs
be ancient and holy if divine: would it not be more full, went it thus? So
ancient as that it is of divine Institution. There you define Episcopacy by
being joined with imparity, and superiority of Jurisdiction: This seems short,
for every Arch-Presbyters, or Archdeacons place, is so, yea and so was Mr.
Henderson in his Chair at Glasgow: unless you will define it by a distinction
of Order. I draw the superiority not from that Jurisdiction which is attributed
to Bishops, Jure Positivo, in their Audience of Ecclesiastical matters, but
from that which is Intrinsicall and original in the power of Excommunication.
Again you say in that first point; That where Episcopacy has obtained, it
cannot be abdicated without violation of Gods Ordinance. This proposition I
conceive, est inter minus habentes; for never was there any Church yet, where
it has not obtained the Christian faith was never yet planted any where but
the very first feature, of the body of a Church was by, or with Episcopacy, and
wheresoever now Episcopacy is not suffered to be, it is by such an abdication;
for certainly there it was a Principio. In your second head you grant, that
the Presbyterian Government may be of use, where Episcopacy may not be had.
First I pray you consider whether this Concession be not needless here, and in
it self of a dangerous consequence. Next I conceive there is no place where
Episcopacy may not be had, if there be a Church more then in title only.
Thirdly since they challenge their Presbyterian fiction to be Christ's Kingdom
and Ordinance (as your self expresses) and cast out Episcopacy as opposite to
it, we must not use any minsing terms, but unmaske them plainly, nor shall I
ever give way to hamper our selves for fear of speaking plain truth, though it
be against Amsterdam or Geneva; and this must be sadly thought on concerning
your Postulata I shall pray you to allow me the like freedom, among which the
two first are true, but (as expressed) too restrictive. For Episcopacy is not so
to be asserted to Apostolical Institution, as to bar it from looking higher,
and from fetching it Materially and originally in the ground and intention of
it, from Christ himself, though perhaps the Apostles formerlyzed it. And here
give me leave a little to enlarge: The Adversaries of Episcopacy are not only
the furious Aerian Heretics (out of which are now raised Prynne, Bastwicke and
our Scottish masters) but some also of a milder and subtiller Alloy, both in
the Genevean Note.
and the Roman faction: And it will become the Church of England so to
vindicate it, against the furious Puritans, as that we lay it not open to be
wounded by either of the other two, more cunning and more learned Adversaries.
Not to the Roman faction, for that will be content it shall be Iuris Divini
Mediati, by, from, for, and under the Pope; that so the Government of the
Church may be Monarchical in him; but not Immediati, which makes the Church
Aristocraticall in the Bishops. This is the Italian Rock, not the Genevean;
For that will not deny Episcopacy to be Iuris Divini, so you will take it, vt
suadentis vel approbantis, but not Imperantis; for then they may take and leave
as they will, which is that they would be at. Nay (if I much forget not) Beza
himself is said to have acknowledged Episcopacy to be Iuris Divini Imperantis,
so you will not take it as, Vniversaliter imperantis, for then Geneva might
escape, et citra considerationem Durationis; for then thought they had it
before, yet now upon wiser thoughts, they may be without it; which Scotland
says now, and who will may say it after, if this be good Divinity: And then
all in that time shall be Democraticall. I am bold to add this, because I
find in your second Postulatum, that Episcopacy is directly commanded, but you
go not so far as to meet with this subtilty of Beza, which is the great
Rock in the Lake of Geneva. In your 9. Postulatum, that the accession of
Honorable Titles or Privileges makes no difference in the substance of the
calling. If you mean the Titles of Archbishops, Primates, Metropolitanes,
Patriarchs, etc. it is well: And I presume you do so: But then in any case take
heed you assert it so, as that the faction lay not hold of it, as if the
Bishops were but the Title of honor, and the same Calling with a Priest, for
that they all aim at, etc. The 11. Postulatum, is large and I shall not
repeat it, because I am sure you retain a Copy of what you writ to me, being
the ribbs of your work, nor shall I say more to it, then that it must be
warily handled for fear of a saucy answer, which is more ready a great deal
with them then a learned one. I presume I am pardoned already for this
freedom, by your submission of all to me, And now I heartily pray you be
pleased to send me up (keeping a Copy to your self against the accidents of
carriage) not the whole work together, but each particular Head, or
Postulatum, as you finish it; that so we here, may be the better able to
consider of it, and the work come on the faster, So to Gods b. protection, etc.

Will. Cant.
Lambeth, Nov. 11. 1639.

This Letter was thus endorsed with the Archbishops own hand. My Answer (of
November. 11. 1639.) to the Heads of the Bishop of Exons Books, intended for
Episcopacie.

What Reply Bishop Hall returned to this his Graces Letter, these following
Lines of his will disclose.

My most Reverend and most Honorable good Lord.
I Should be unthankefull, if I did not acknowledge every one of these Lines of
so long a Letter, written with your Graces own hand, a new obligation to me,
who know the price of your time; yet the matter of them binds me more; those
Animadversions were so just, that I had amended those passages (diverse of them)
voluntarily, ere I received this Gracious Admonition, for I did only send your
Grace the rude draught of what I meant to polish in the Expression; your Grace
observes truly some mitigation in stating the Cause, which I confess to have
purposely used, out of a desire to hold as good Terms with our neighbor
Churches abroad, as I safely might; your Grace knows well how Doctor Field,
and Doctor Downam have handled that point, if we may make the Case sure for us,
with the least aspersion cast upon them, (who honor our Government, and cannot
obtain it) I conceived it the better, especially, since the Scottish case so
palpably differs; yet I would so determine it, as that nothing but necessity
can either excuse them, or hold up the truth of their being. In the Presbytery
I must fall foul with them, howsoever; That Clause of abdication was inserted,
with respect to the present occasion; I shall willingly abdicate it, Those many
scruples which may arise, and must be met with in this cause, will be avoided,
if we do plainly and shortly state the Question thus; Whether the Majority of
Bishops above Presbyters, be by Divine Institution? which if we make good, I
suppose, is as much as can be reasonably desired: for what Christian can think
it life or lawful to depart from that which Christ and his Apostles have set
in his Church, with an intent of perpetual continuance? I have noted in my
discourse, those two sorts of Adversaries, and with respect to them put in
these two words, Lawful, against the first; and against the second, Divine;
though the latter in the tractation comprehends both.

We shall not much need, I hope, in this way to come within the Ken of that
Roman Rock of jus Divinum mediatum, although it must fall into our mention.
Shortly, I shall take careful heed to those points which you Grace advises;
and when I have laid my last hand upon the first part, whereof each clause must
Bis ad Limam, semel ad linguam, I shall transcribe and send it to your Grace
for your full and free Censure. In the mean time, with my best prayers, I take
leave, and vow my self,

Your Graces in all faithful observance to command, Jos. Exon.
Exon. Pal. Nov. 16.

The Archbishop with his own hand thus endorsed this Letter. Received Nov. 18
1639. L. Exon. his Answer to those Animadversions I made upon the heads of his
intended Book for Episcopacie.

The Archbishop returning an Answer to this Letter, thereupon Bishop Hall sent
up his Treatise of Episcopacy by Divine Right, accompanied with this Epistle,
and the ensuing Propositions, which together with his Book, he wholly
submitted to his Graces judgment and disposal.

Most Reverend and my ever most Honorable good Lord,
I Have received your Graces speedy and full answer to my last. And now
according to my promise, I present to your Graces hands this Work of mine, the
bulk whereof swelled under my hand, beyond my purpose; whiles I could think no
passage of it unnecessary; I humbly submit it to your Graces free Censure, not
personal, (for I could not be so weak as to think your Grace could lose so
much time in perusal of it) but Deputative. The more and the more judicious
eyes pass upon it, the better. Whether for haste, or delay; for impression, or
suppression or suppression, I am altogether indifferent: for my own judgment
I do not think it werthy or capable of the attestation of others, especially
my betters, for that I do both take my rise from a particular occasion and do
often intersperse polemicall dissertations, as with M. Parker, Anti-Tilenus,
Vedelius, and others, without which me thought I could not satisfactorily clear
those points,) which passages I have no reason to think others should take upon
them, either to own or justify. It was my second bold motion to your Grace,
That diverse select Bishops and Divines, should shortly and fully express their
judgments in this subject; Your Grace thought fitter (to which I subscribed)
that it-should be done by one or two, and allowed and seconded by more, such a
discourse should be only positive and short: As for this, I suppose the
judicious perusers will think it may be of good use to settle and prepare the
minds of men, toward an unanimity of Judgment in this point, which perhaps
may be otherwise varying: And if I may have leave to shoot my bolt I should
conceive, (if an attestation to our just Tenent be thought requisite from many
and the best hands) it would sort best, that the substance of it should be
drawn up into some short and full Propositions (such as these which I have
taken the boldness to enclose) and sent or tendered to them for their
subscription; wherein I should hold a generality of expression the safest. I
beseech your Grace pardon this presumption of mine, and for this my Labor, if
it be found that it may be of any profitable use, in these way ward times, let
it fly; otherwise it may this festival be employed in Thuris Piperisue
Cucullos. I shall be well content with either the light or the fire. Your Grace
will soon find that I have been plain enough with our Genevians: for the
Foreign Churches I have taken the same course, with our learned Bishop
Andrews, as pitying their alleging necessity, not approving their form: in
the mean time not thinking it best to make Enemies where we may have friends. I
do find and show the Scottish case utterly unlike theirs for our greater
advantage: I have driven the point further than some worthy Divines before me;
and especially have labored in that part, where the cause bears most, viz. in
matter of Scripture; and the next following Antiquity. What it is, is wholly
and absolutely at your Graces disposing, to what ever purpose your Grace will
think fit: And so with the apprecation of an happy New year to your Grace, and
to this whole Church, I take my humble leave, and am

Your Graces in all faithful Observance to Command. JOS. EXON.
Exon. Pal. S. Tho. Day.

This Letter was thus superscribed: To the most Reverend and most honorable my
singular good Lord, my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, Primate of all
England, and Metropolitan, Chancellor of Oxford, and one of the Lords of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council, present these.

And thus indorsed with the Archbishops own hand. Received Jan. 30. 1640. L.
Exon Concerning his book: and the submission of it to my judgment.

The Propositions enclosed in this Letter were these following, to which the
Archbishop added this Title, and some insertions with his own hand here noted
with a distinct Character.

Concerning Church Government and the estate of Episcopacy.
1. God had never any Church upon earth that was ruled by a Parity. 2. The
first Church of God which was reduced to a public policy Inserted with the
Archbishops own hand.
was among the Jews, and by his own appointment was governed by a settled
imparity of High Priest, Priests, Levites. 3. The Evangelicall Church was
founded by our Savior in a known imparity; for though the Apostles were
equal among themselves, yet they were above the 70. and all other Disciples,
and were specially endued with power from on high. 4. The same God and Savior
after his Assention did set several ranks and orders of the holy Ministry:
First Apostles: Secondly Prophets: Thirdly Teachers, etc. all which
acknowledged the eminence and authority of the Apostles. 5. The Apostles after
the Assention of our Savior by the direction of Gods spirit, did exercise that
power and superiority of spiritual Jurisdiction over the rest of the Church,
which was given them by Christ, and stood upon their Majority above all other
Ministers of the Gospel. 6. The same Apostles did not carry that power up to
heaven with them, and leave the Church unfurnished with the due helps of her
further propagation and Government, but by virtue of this power and by the same
direction of Gods spirit, ordained in several parts spiritual guides and
Governors of Gods people to aid and succeed them. 7. The spiritual persons
so by them ordained were at the first promiscuously called Bishops and
Presbyters, and managed the Church affairs, by common advice but still under
the Government of the Apostles their Ordayners and overseers. 8. But when the
Apostles found that Quarrels and Emulations grew in the Church; Added with the
Archbishops own hand.
even while many of them were living; through the Parity of Presbyters, and
side takings of the people; The same Apostles by the appointment and direction
of the same spirit, raised in each City, where the Church was more frequent,
one amongst the Presbyters to a more eminent Authority then the rest to succeed
them, in their ordinary power of ordination and censure, and encharged them,
peculiarly with the care of Church Government, such were Timothy and Titus, and
those which were styled the Angels, of the seven Asian Churches. 9. These
selected persons were then and ever since distinguished from the rest by the
name Episcopi-Bishops. 10. In the very times of the Apostles, and by the
imposition of their hands, there were diverse such persons settled in the Church
of God, being severally ordained and appointed to the oversight of those
populous Cities where their charge lay, to whom all the Presbyters and Deacons
were subject. 11. These Bishops continued their fixed superiority over their
Clergy all the time of their life, with the well allowed express of spiritual
Jurisdiction, and after their death This was altered by the Archbishop, and
put in lieu of: were succeeded by others of their own Order or Degree
other Presbyters were chosen to succeed them, by the due imposition of the
hands of their fellow Bishops. 12. There was no Church of Christ upon earth,
ever since the times of the Apostles, governed any otherwise then by Bishops,
thus successively (after decease) ordained. 13. This course of Government thus
set by the Apostles in their life time, by the special direction of the holy
spirit, is not alterable by any humane Authority, but ought to be perpetuated
in the Church to the end of the world. 14. Those which in the new Testament are
called the Elders of the Church were no other then spiritual persons, such as
had the charge of feeding the Flock of Christ by Word and Doctrine. 15. It is
not lawful for any Lay-person to lay hands on those which are to be ordained,
nor to have any hand in managing the Censures of the Church, which only
pertain to them who have the power of the Keys delivered to them by Christ.
16. There was never any Lay Presbyter heard or read of in the Church of Christ
in any History, until this present age: This clause was added by the
Archbishop, with his own hand.
All which we declare to the Doctrine and Judgment of the Church of England,
concerning these points of Church Government.
These Propositions were thus endorsed with the Archbishops own hand: Rec.
December. 29. 1639. Bishop Hall of Exeter his propositions concerning Episcopacy;
These perhaps may be thought fit for a subscription of others.

There were two more Letters which passed between these Prelates about this
subject and Book, which we have referred to a more proper Here. p. 263. to 267.
place, where you may peruse them: All which compared together will fully
discover, the whole plot and design of the Archbishop and his confederates, in
maintaining their Lordly Episcopal Superiority to be of divine Institution and
Right, and how it was driven on by them, till it brake them all in pieces, by
the authority and Justice of the present Parliament.

The last head I shall mention, is the sum and substance of all the
forementioned: namely,

21. That the Church of Rome is a true visible Church, and never erred in
fundamentalls, no not in the worst times: That she is the Ancient holy Mother
Church; That her Religion, and ours of the Church of England, is all one: That
men may be saved in that Church and Religion as well as in ours; and that it is
a crime to be recanted, to hold Papists, as Papists, to be damned.
This main comprehensive Proposition, ratifies and clearly demonstrates to us,
the true drift and scope of all the former; to wit, a (...) and reconciliation
with the Church of Rome; the foundation whereof was first laid by this
Archbishops creature, Bishop Mountague, who determines thus in his Gagge page
14. The Articles of our Creed are confessed on both sides and held plain
enough. The controverted points are of a larger and an inferior alloy: of them
a man may be ignorant without any danger of his soul at all, page 50. Moderate
men on both sides confess, this controversy may cease, Ecclesia Romana manet
Christi Ecclesia and sponsa, etc. In his Appeal page 136. Since there first was
a Church in England, France, Spain, and Rome, there has not ceased to be a
true Church there: page 139. The Church of Rome is, and ever was, a true
Church, since it was a Church. page 113. I am absolutely persuaded, that the
Church of Rome is a true, though not a sound Church of Christ, as well since as
before the Council of Trent; In essentialls and fundamentalls, they agree, in
holding one faith in one Lord.

This Position was strenuously maintained by Master Chomley, and Butterfield
(who soon after turned Seminary Priest) in their Books against Master Burtons,
Babel no Bethel; wherein they justified the Church of Rome to be a true Church,
this being the subject matter of both their Treatises.

Tho. Chuneus, in his Collectiones Theologicae, Dedicated to the Archbishop,
and Licensed by Heywood his Chaplain, August 26. 1634. cap. 16. p. 45. 46.
determines thus: Quaenam sit Romana Ecclesia? Cum constet Romanam Ecclesiam, in
primariis temporibuss, velut inter ignes Luna Minores, caeteris Ecclesiis
praeluxisse, caeterisque Maechantibus castam, and pudicam veritatis
conservatricem extitisse, nec in pessimis usque eo degenerasse censemus ut in
primariis and fundamentalibus Religionis capitibus aberrasse videatur;
quidniquamvis in caeteris forsan vitiatam and temeratam, Ecclesiae tamen nomine
honestandam censeam, etc.

This passage Doctor Bastwick taking exception against at his censure in the
High Commission, read it openly in Court, where the Archbishop publicly
justified it in his speech, affirming: That the Church of Rome was a true
Church, and that it never erred in fundamentalls, in which we differ not, but
only circa fundamentalia.

This distinction of his was afterward thus justified in Print by Christopher
Dome, in his Innovations unjustly charged, page 48. Nor is it an absurd
distinction (as he unreverendly and absurdly termed it) that a great Prelate
used in the High Commission at the censure of Doctor Bastwick, when he said:
That we and the Church of Rome differ not in fundamentalibus, but circa
fundamentalia page 49. The distinction is not absurd, but it may most truly
and fitly be said, that we may and do differ about, and not in fundamentals:
which Doctor Heylin likewise seconds in his Moderate Answer, to Henry Burton,
p. 6. 124. 125. No difference between the Church of Rome and England in
fundamentalls. Suppose a great Prelate in the High Commission (...) had said
openly, that we and the Church of Rome differ not in ^^^^amentalibus, yet how
comes this to be an Innovation, etc. The Church of Rome has done more against
the Heretics of this age, than you, or any of your Divines, be he whom he
will. But for the Church of Rome, it is a true Church, and that we differ not
from them in fundamentalls: see the Reconciler.

Doctor Potter, in his book which he submitted to the Archbishops censure,
concludes thus; page 62. 77. The most necessary and fundamental truths, which
constitute a Church, are on both sides unquestioned. We hope well of those holy
souls who in former ages lived and dyed in the Church of Rome, etc. Nay, our
charity reaches further, to all those this day who in simplicity of heart
believe the Roman Religion and profess it.

Doctor Pocklingtons, Altar Christianum, page 114. Terms Rome by the name of
Holy Church, and applauds her canonized Popish Saints, stiling them, The Holy
Saints and Martyrs of Jesus Christ, whose names are written in heaven: And our
Protestant Martyrs, Traitors, Murderers, Rebels, and Heretics.

The Archbishop himself was a professed maintainer of the truth and visibility
of the faith and Church of Rome, not only in his Speech in the high Commission,
at Doctor Bastwicks censure there, and in his Speech in Star Chamber, page 36.
but likewise in his late Reply to Fisher, Epist. Ded. p. 16. And were not this
so, we should never be troubled with that idle and impertinent question of
theirs: Where was your Church before Luther? For it was just there, where
theirs is now. One and the same Church still, no doubt of that; one in
substance, but not one in condition of State and purity; Their part of the same
Church remaining in corruption: and our part of the same Church under
Reformation. In the Reply it self, page 370. 371. Rome, but with all
particular Churches and no more than other Patriarchall Churches was and is,
radix existentiae, the root of the Churches existence. The Church of Rome and
every other particular Church, etc. Indeed Apostolic she is, as being the Sea
of one, and he a prime Apostle, but not the only Apostolic: Visible, I may
not deny, God has hitherto preserved her. And p. 376. Secondly, if the
Religion of the Protestants be in conscience a known false Religion, then the
Romanists Religion is so too, for their Religion is the same. Nor do the Church
of Rome and the Protestants set up a different Religion (for the Christian
Religion is the same to both) but they differ in the same Religion, and their
difference is in certain gross corruptions.

I shall close up this with a public Recantation, drawn up and prescribed by
Godfry Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, to one Mr. Ridler Minister of Little
Deane, about 7. miles from that City: who having many Papists in his Parish,
and preaching in a Sermon there, That Papists, as Papists were damned, and that
the true Protestant Religion was the only true and safe way to Salvation: he
was upon the complaint of some Papists, convicted before this Bishop, and by
him enjoined to make this following Recantation, prescribed to him, in writing,
in the Cathedral Church at Gloucester on Jan. 2. 1636. and for refusing to make
it, he was afterward on the 5. of March next following suspended from his
living.

(IHS)

IN the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.
Whereas I did deliver in a Sermon, lately preached in this Diocese, That if we
are saved the Papists are damned; I am Note.
right heartily sorry that I should deliver any such doctrine, wherein I must
acknowledge mine own error, and my great fault and offense.

First, against his Majesty's Instructions, thus rashly and unadvisedly to
affirm, That Papists are damned.

Secondly, it is an offense against the laws of the Kingdom, For in the eye of
the Law we are still one with the same Catholic Church: for were we of a
distinct or several Church, Then our Church could claim no right or Title to
those Privileges, Charters, Foundations, and Revenues which it enjoyes at this
day, for these were granted to Papists, and for many hundred years possessed
by them; and since there has been no new Law for transferring them upon a
different or contrary Church; But this is made much more manifest by the
express words of the Statute, as it appears by the Act of Parliament which
was made upon the first breach with the Papists: the words are these, That they
do not thereby intend to separate themselves from Gods Catholic Church, but
only for Note.
some political respects, to preserve the Kingdom from Ruin. This was made
the 25. of Hen. 8. and it is in force at this day; so that to make such a
difference between these two Churches, as is between damnation and salvation;
certainly is against the Common Laws, and the Statute Law of this Kingdom;
besides many acts of State, which being above my element, I will not presume to
touch upon.

Thirdly, against the Church of England; It is imposible there should be any
greater offense, in regard of the affinity that is between both Churches, for
we have the same Holy Orders, the same Church Service, the same Note.
Ceremonies, the same Fasts, the same Festivals, and we have generally the same
Canon Laws; and therefore through sides of the Church of Rome they do but give
deadly and mortal Wounds to the Church of England who affirm, that Papists
are damned.

Fourthly it is an offense to Christian Religion; for we are to preach the
Means how men may attain Salvation, and to pteach Christ as a Savior, we
must not rashly intrude upon his Judicial power on every slight occasion, to
point out those that are damned, as if we would shorten the mercyes of God and
Monopolize them wholly to our selves, there is no militant Church without
blemishes and imperfections, but as long as the foundation is sound, that we
bebeive in Christ crucified, and that we believe the three Creeds, so long
there is hope of Salvation, Several churches, though differing in many things,
yet may be contained in the bounds of the Catholic church: Thus the Greek
church and the Latin Church, may be saved both, though they have difference
between themselves; and thus the Christians that lived in those parts of the
world, which have been lately discovered [and therefore did never partake with
the rest of the Catholic church] yet no doubt but those may be saved.

Fifthly, there is nothing so proper to Christians, as love and charity, and a
man may be damned as well for want of charity, as for want of faith; and there
cannot be possible a greater want of charity, then to exclude men from
Salvation: and therefore they who are apt in their own ungodly malice to damn
others, certainly themselves are damned; Let it suffice that if any man shall
ask God forgiveness of his sins, as no doubt every man does, (for it is one
part of the Lords prayer,) and these sins do imply not only the
Transgressions of our lives, but likewise the erour of our faith, so that
asking God forgiveness no doubt but God is merciful.

And here I must likewise express my great sorrow and grief, that I have so
much offended against the memory of our forefathers and Progenitors, such as
built our Churches, and were the means under God, not only to give us life,
but also to make us Christians: when I consider their Piety and their
Mortification, shall I think these tended to nothing but only to damn them?
No, God forbid; and therefore in all humility and obedience, I do here
acknowledge my great fault, and do ask forgiveness of God, of the Church, and
of our Reverend Diocesan, and I desire you all to testify this my Sorrow and
unfeigned repentance. Note.


By all these Authorized Popish positions, you may easily guess at this
Arch-Prelates Popish intentions, to reduce us back to Rome.

We shall close up this catalogue of Authorized printed Popish Doctrines and
Positions, with two remarkable particulars more, sufficient to amaze all
Protestant Readers for their strangeness.

The first is, the extraordinary commendation of the most impious Council of
Trent, the Popes Masterpiece, the principal establishment, support, of the
whole body of Popery, and strongest Pillar to support both the Faith, Pope, and
Church of Rome.

For this we shall produce one memorable clause, which you may read in the
exact collection of all the Roman Emperors lives, from Julius Caesar to the
now reigning Ferdinando the second; Printed at London for George Hutton, and
licensed by Doctor weeks, Chaplain both to the Archbishop and Bishop of
London, Ann. 1636. p. 374. Ferdinando the Brother of Charles, and Son of
Philip King of Castile was a man well learned, especially in the Latin tongue,
and also in Arms most expert and active; wherefore it was doubted whether he
were of more agility in Chevalry, or more eloquent and fluent in the Latia,
Italian, Spanish, High Dutch, Hungarian, and Bohemian Languages. In the time of
his Imperial Government the Council of Trent, was held, which was so
commodious and profitable to the general good of the world, Note.
that it may serve for a certain Rule, both of Government of States, and a
form of good life. In which proceedings this Emperor showed himself very
forward and a great assistant.

What greater Encomions could be given of this damnable Popish Council by
public Authority, without censure, revocation, or any Index expurgatorius, let
all Protestants judge.

The second is: The printing of the Popish Index Biblicus, here in London by
Authority, An: 1640. made by Priests and Jesuits, for their Vulgar Latin Bible,
and binding it up with the Latin Bibles of Iunius, Tremelius and Baezers
Translation, to seduce the Readers and corrupt the Text.

You have heard before, how the Archbishop commanded the whole History of our
Saviors Nativity, Life, Passion, Resurrection, Assention, to be publikly
printed, and inserted both into English and Latin Bibles, after the Popish
garb, taking his pattern from the Masse-booke; to pollute, pervert the text,
and infect the Readers by degrees with Popery, even by these very Bibles, which
otherwise would most alienate them from it. But not contented herewith he and
his agents the better, sooner, to seduce the people to Popery, even by the very
Bible it self, caused some two or three thousand Popish Indexes (made for the
Popish Vulgar Translation of the Bible by Priests and Jesuits, and bound up
with it) to be printed here in London by authority Anno. 1640. and bound up
with our small Latin Bibles of Junius and Bezaes translation; to which it was
never formerly annexed, as a fit Index for them. In which Index Biblicus, the
grossest points of Popery are positively asserted, as directly contained in,
and justified by the Scripture texts, to which it does refer.

The public printing, and sale of these Indexes here in London with our
Protestant Latin Bibles without control, was attested by Michael Spark
Senior, Master Walley and others, and these popish passages read out of them at
the Lords Bar, by Mr. Prynne: Adoratio Angelis and hominibus tributa, Genesis 18.

All these, with sundry other Popish Doctrines were contained in this Index
Biblicus, bound up with our Protestant Bibles, to pervert the Scriptures,
seduce the Readers, and make the very Bible itself (as much as in them lay)
the very Patron and Propagator of Popery. Now what more desperate project could
there be to undermine our established Religion, and set up Popery then this, to
corrupt the very Scriptures themselves by annexing such a pernicious Index to
them; A crime so transcendently execrable in an Arch-Prelate, entrusted with
the greatest care of our Religion, as no tongue is able to express its
detestablenesse to the full, no punishment great enough to expiate its guilt.



We have represented you with an Epitome of the several Popish Doctrines
printed and authorized of late years in our Church by the Archbishop himself,
his Chaplains and Instruments, and could have furnished you with infinite
others of this kind: but because Master Bailey in his, Canterburians
selfe-conviction, the last Edition, has collected and published most of them
already to the world, where the studious may praise them at their leisure, and
we desire rather to satisfy, then surfeit or tire out the Reader with instances
of this nature, we shall pass them by in silence, only with this known
experimental observation, That all kinds of Popish, Arminian Doctrines were
ever more bold and frequent in our Pulpits throughout the Realm, then in our
Presses, especially in our Universities and the Kings own Chapel; a truth so
universally known to all, so plentifully manifested to the world in Mr. Whites
first Century of scandalous and malignant Priests, that to prove it by
witnesses or Inductions of particulars, would be to light a Candle to the
sun, and wast much precious time in proving that, which no impartial
intelligent man so much as doubts of, but knows most true of his own woeful
experience.

Fourthly, having given you this large account of what popish doctrines and
positions both himself, his Chaplains, Agents, printed, authorized to corrupt
the peoples IV. Notable passages against popery expunged out of new licensed
Books by the Archbishop and his Agents in imitation of the popish Index
Expurgatorius.
judgment; we shall next present you with a large English Index Expurgatorius,
of what passages he and they expunged out of sundry English Writers, tendered
them to license, before they could pass the Press; which will most clearly
discover his and their Jesuiticall practices, confederacies and designs to
introduce the whole body of Popery among us with little or no opposition.

We shall begin with purgations of this nature, made by the Bishop himself,
some of them before he had any public authority to license Books, but most of
them after he usurped this power, all of them so remarkable, that all
Protestant Churches, Readers will stand amazed at them.

The first we shall instance in, is his purgations made in Doctor Sibthorps
Sermon* preached at Northampton Assizes, before the Judges, in the year 1627.
entitled* Apostolical Obedience; the whole scope of this Sermon, was to
justify The lawfulness of the general Loan (then set on foot by the Kings
ill Councillors, to keep off Parliaments) and of the Kings imposing public
Taxes by his own regal power, without consent in Parliament; and to prove,
that the people in point of conscience and religion ought cheerfully to submit
to such Loanes and Taxes without any opposition. To sweeten this sower theme,
the Doctor had cunningly inserted some popular passages into this Sermon
against evil Counselors, the toleration of Papists, Popery, and the
profanation of the Sabbath, which this Bishop (who procured this Sermon of his
to be printed) expunged with his own hand, as was evidenced by the Original
written Copy, found in his Study, produced at the Lords Bar, and attested by
Master Prynne.

The first passage he expunged was this; When not only the Emperor extirpates
the Protestants in Bohemia, where he professed it, and Baveir in the Palatinate,
where he has a pretext of revenge for it, or the Spaniard and Arch-dutchesse
in their Dominions, where the Jesuits make it a case of Conscience, but even
the King of France not only at Rochel and Mountabon, but also in other his
confines: and when the Pope unites all these in a holy League; what may we
expect will become of Britain, if like that wise King in the Gospel, ours
sends not out whilst the enemies are yet a far off? you know how speedily
this Island has been overrunne with but a few being once entered, and our Islands
are not now better fortified.

The next was this; He that Disturbs the State, and draws the Prince to ill,
is to undergo what he intended to others, as Haman and his accomplices for their
plot against the Jews, Ester 7, 8, 9. chapters: He that under pretense of
honor to the King is an enemy to Religion, should suffer for a Seducer, as
those betrayers of the Prophet. Dan. 6. 4. to 25. It is probable that this
Bishop being then newly made a Privy-Counsellour, and putting the King upon
pernicious and illegal projects, to the disturbance of the State and prejudice
of Religion, grew conscious to himself, that this passage if un-expunged, might
one day rise up in judgment against him and be applied to himself in after
times; wherefore out of a provident foresight, he thought it a point of wisdom
to expunge it: But since divine providence has brought it to public light, we
conceive it will be a very good president to direct your Lordships judgment in
the sentence of this Haman, this Arch-Malefactor against our State and Religion.

The the third expunged clause was this; And whereas there is not only a law
of God but even of man against Sabbath-breaking, which concerns the fourth
Commandment, NOTE.
and diverse against Popery, which trencheth upon the first and second
Commandment, etc. let not the other which concerns the Sabbath, seem to have
been consented to, only upon the importunity of a few Precise persons, but
never intended for execution, least God set such a Memorandum upon them and you
(who will not be careful of the Memento set upon that Commandment) that whosoever
hears of it, both his ears shall tingle, as stories tell us, he has done
upon both Prince and People in France, Denmark, yea and here in England,
offending in that kind. Let not all the other Statutes tending toward the
first and second Commandment, seem mere engines of state to draw reward for
toleration, dispensation and connivancy, least God connive not at, nor dispense
with such intolerable dissimulation; least he make the gain gotten by this
dividing of Adoration between him and Idols, to be like that of Solomens, in
that case, which was recompensed with the loss and dividing of his Kingdom
betwixt his son and astranger, 1 Reg. 11, and 12. Chapters: But ob far be
that from the State of this Island, and from you to be instruments NOTE.
in it.

And in the Margin this Note, affixed to the word, stories, was quite purged
out; Greg. Turonensis. Magdeburg. cent. 12. c. 6. at London 1583, etc. in which
places meaner persons working, greater sporting, Kings fighting battatles on
the Sabbath days, are all reported to be overthrown and destroyed with
fearful judgments.

These being the only pious. Orthodox passages in all this Sermon (against
popery Papists, Sabbath-breaking and ill Counselors) were quite crossed out
with this Bishops own hand, (who altered and added many things in it, for the
worse) and all to this very purpose, that the people might not take notice of
any design in foreign parts, to extirpate the Protestant Religion, or to
tolerate, set up Popery, or suspend the Laws against it, or Papists, Priests
and Sabbath Breakers, at home, whereof these Clauses gave them notice; which
this Doctor (as had as he was) foresaw world produce that devision in our
Kingdom, which we now experimentally suffer under threatening uttter desolation
to us: all these purgations in one Sermon were made by polupragmaticall Prelat
before he had any legal power to license Books for the Press (...) ^econdly,
we shall proceed to some higher attempts after he had gained such (...) of them
even upon the public Records of our Church.

(...) of 3. Jacobi chapter 1. entitled, An Act for a public Thanksgiving (...)
every year, on the fifth day of November; ordains this day to be had
perpetual remembrance, that all ages to come might yield praises to God for
our deliverance from the most inhumane, cruel, and barbarous Gunpowder-plot of
the Papests, and hate in memory this joyful day of deliverance: Hereupon there
was a special book of Prayers and Thanksgiving compiled, and enjoined by
authority to be used on this day; in one of the prayers whereof, there was this
clause; Root out the Babylonish and NOTE:
Antichristian Sect, which say of Jerusalem, down with it, down with it, even
to the ground; and to that end strengthen the hands of our gracious King, the
Nobles and Magistrates of the Land with judgment and justice to cut off these
workers of iniquity (whose Religion is Rebellion, whose Faith is Faction, whose
practice is murdering of souls and bodies) and to root them out of the
confines of this Kingdom, etc. This clause continued in all these public
books without the least exception or alteration, from the year of our Lord
1606. till 1635. and then this Archbishop conceiving this passage to lay an
imputation and seandall, First, upon the profession of Romish Priests, Jesuits,
and blood-thirsty papists, by stiling them, a Babylonish and Antichrian sect;
Secondly, upon their Romish Religion, whose religion is rebellion, whose faith
is faction; Thirdly, upon their Rebellious and traitorous practices, in stiling
them, these workers of iniquity, whose practice is murdering of souls and
bodies; Fourthly, upon their persons as unfit to be tolerated in the Realm and
meet to be rooted out of the confines of this Kingdom by the King, Nobles and
Magistrates; a clause altogether inconsistent with our toleration of, and his
reconciliation of us and our religion with them and Rome then actually
intended, endeavored by this Arch-prelat and his Confederates: he thereupon in
the year 1635. caused this Book to be reprinted and, altered the
forementioned clauses in this ensuing form (only to gratify the Jesuits,
Priests popish Recusants, and take off these just charges against them and
their Religion, both for the time past and future) by turning the edge of this
prayer upon the Puritanes, on whom the Papists would have fathered this their
horrid treason, had it taken effect; Root out that Babylonish and Antichristian
sect (of them) which say of Jerusalem, etc. And to that end strengthen the
hands of our gracious King, the Nobles and Magistrates of the Land with justice
and judgment, to cut off those working of iniquity, who turn Religion into
Rebellion, and faith into Faction, etc.

Master Henry Burton in his Sermons on the fifth of November 1636. entitled,
For God and the King p. 130. to 142. informed the people of this most gross
alteration and charged the Arch bishop to be the Author of it, aggravating his
offense to the full; Master Prynne doing the like in his Epistle Dedicatory to
his Quench-Cole: For this good service among others, they were brought into the
Star Chamber by the Archbishops instigation: who in his Speech in that Court at
their consure (published by special command) First of all confessed that he
made this alteration; Secondly, justified the making of it, because it gave
offense and scandal to the Papists, which ever ought to be avoided as much as
may be: adding that it laid an imputation on their Religion as if it were
rebel on spending sundry Page 32 to 3^
pages in justification of this alteration as most fitting and necessary;
averring, that our religion and the Papists was all one, and rendering three
reasons why this change was made; Thirdly, he adds by way of justification and
excuse that though he made this alteration, yet he did it by his Majesty's
command, p. 33. 34. His Majesty expressly commanded me to make the Alterations,
and see then printed; and here are both the Books with his Majesty's warrant to
each of them: so that herein I aver I did not offend, unless that I gave not
these men notice of it, or asked them leave to obey the King. To which it was
answered; First, that the Archbishop confeseth clearly in his Speech and
publishes it to all the world in print. That he made the alterations in this
prayer, which neither of his Predecessors Bancroft or Abbot durst once to think
of or attempt: Secondly, That he esteemed Master Burtons and Master Prynnes
dislike of him for making these alterations in extentation of the horrid
Gunpowder-plot, and favor of trairerous Jesuits, Priests, Romanists, and the
popish Religion, a most transcendent crime, worthy the severest, bloodiest
censure that ever was inflicted on any person in the Star Chamber, as appeared
by their herbarous Sentence there, for which he heartily thanked the Lords in
the close of his speech; whereas his offense was certainly ten thousand times
greater in making these alterations then theirs in charging him with them (when
himself confesses and just fieth them) or disliking them when made for such
sinister popish ends: Thirdly that his reasons to justify these alterations to
be fit and necessary were very absurd; discovering the rottennesle of his
heart, with his extraordinary affection to popery, and Papists: His first
reason, that it was fit and necessary to make these Alterations, to avoid
scandal and offense to Papists, in calling their religion Rebellion etc. was
very unreasonable and absurd; For since this clause had continued un-altered
un-excepted against near thirty years space together, and was never deemed
scandalous by K. James, K. Charle's our subsequent Parliaments or Church, which
approved and confirmed it, no solid reason can be given why it should grow
unseasonable or scandalous, only now, so an as to call for a necessary
alteration, but that the Arch bishop and his confederates had now a new
resolved plot to reconcile us to Rome and her Religion, which former ages never
had; to which designethis clause might happily prove seandalous and
obstructive: Besides he could not but conclude the alteration of it after so
many years continuance, of purpose to gratify Papists, priests and Jesuits,
the sole contrivers of that marchlesse excerable Gunpowder-plot would give
extraordinary seandall and offense to all the whole Church, State, and cordial
protestants of Engl. and lay a secret tax, if not a public censure on them and
on K. James, for injuring the papists and their Religion even in these public
prayers near thirty years spice together; yet this zealous Romish Agent would
rather scandalize, censure, injure our whole Church, State, parliaments, King
James with all true-hearted English protestants then give the lest scandal to
the papists or suffer this just imputatation of Rehellion to continue upon
their religion. Moreover the whole parliament of 3. Jacobs in the Oath of
Alleagiance then enjoined with all our parliaments prelates Peers, who since
have approved it: The second part of our authorized Homilies for Whit-sunday,
with our Homilies against wilful rebellion; Bishop B ^^on in his True
difference between Christian Subjection and unchristian Rebellion; Bishop Jewel
in his Defense of the Apology of the Church of England part. 4. p. 439. to 470.
Doctor John White in his Sermon at Pauls-Crosse, and in his Defense of the Way,
chapter 6. 11. Doctor Crakenthorp's Treatise of the Popes temporal Monarchy, Deus
and Rex, Haddon contra Osorium; and generally all our Writers against the Popes
supremacy at home, and in the reformed Churches abroad, resolve unanimously in
their writings, the Romanists Religion and Faith in the points of deposing,
excommunicating murdering Christian Princes Kings, Emperors; of absolving
subjects from their alleagiance, and arming them against their Sovereigns, by
the Popes authority and command, for not submitting to his tyrannical or
Antichristian Edicts, it is mere Rebellion and Faction: For this Arch-prelate
then thus publicly to aver it a scandalous imputation to them and their
religion; and upon this ground to make these alterations in this prayer, and
not in all those Statutes, Homilies, Authors too, is a most false, absurd,
scandalous suggestion, and in truth, a mere evasion to color his affection to
papists and their Antichristian Religion. His second reason, that it will be of
dangerous conquence sadly to avow that the Papists Religion is Rebelion,
because it is Christian religion and the same with ours: is both falls and
fallacious; for popish religion, as popish is not Christian, but Antichristian;
and though papists hold many points of Christian Religion, as they are
Christians; yet not one point of it as Papists; popery truly so called, being
no part of Christian Religion, but deviations from, or paradoxes against it:
Yea, himself confessing Speech in Star Chamber. p. 36, 37.
That some opinions of theirs teach rebelion: That Is apparently true; which
opinions of theirs, are that part of their Religion, which this prayer calls
Rebellion refutes his own Objection: His third reason, that if you make their
religion to be rebelion, then you make their religion and rebelion to be all
one; and that is against the ground both of State and Law, etc. which never put
any man to death for Religion, but for Treason and Rebellion only is a mere
childish fallacy; For their Religion is not any actual treason or rebellion
(for which only they suffered death) but doctrinall and habitual rebelion
prone to produce actual rebellions, and the mother of them; in which sense
only this prayer styles it Rebellion; yet such, for which no Romanist ever
dyed, unless he reduced it into some treasonable and rebellious action; and
then he suffered only for the act, not the Religion or opinion which induced
him thereunto; he might well then have spared these three irrational reasons
for this Alteration, with this assertion of his p. 39. I took it my duty to lay
it before you, that the King had not only Power, but Reason to command it;
which only aggravate, not extenuate or justify his fact, his justification
then rests solely upon the Kings command and warrant; but this will not excuse
his guilt: For we have nothing but his own bare word in his own case (to which
no faith can be given, having so often bin taken tardy in this kind) to prove;
first that himself did not move the King to command these alterations to be
made which is more than probable, by his aleaging the reasons whereupon they
were made, and his activity in other changes of this nature: Secondly, that
himself did not procure the Warrant for these Alterations after they were made
and printed (being written with his own hand and having no witness but himself
to prove the date) as he has done in other cases: Thirdly, admit the command
and warrant proceeded originally from the King himself, not him; yet he being
by his place and office principally entrusted with the care, honor, safety of
our Religion and Church, so much concerned in these alterations; it had been
his duty to have disobeyed this command and dissuaded his Majesty from such a
dishonorable, scandalous and offensive act, which would scandalize and disgust
all his well-affected protestant Subjects, dishonor his own royal Father King
James, our Parliaments, Church, State, who all authorized, approved, used this
prayer for thirty years space together; encourage Papists, Priests, Jesuits,
to such like horrid treasons, and exceedingly animate, elevate the popish
faction causing them to deride, if not to insult over the Protestants and our
Church which must now alter retract her own approved Collects to gratify them
and their Antichristian Religion: But so far is he from this, that he readily
obeyes the first command without the lest disswasion, resistance, without
advising with, or giving notice thereof to any other of his Brethren, the
Privy-Counsell, Judges, and other public persons as much concerned in it as
himself, (to whom he ought to have given notice, and asked their leave, at
least opinions) herein ere he obeyed the King, though not Master Burtons and
Master Prynnes;) being more ready to obey than his Majesty to command them:
Finally admit his Majesty had commanded him to make these alterations yet for
him in his own cause, in an open Court of Justice (where by Law he ought not
to have been present, or spoken as a Judge) to lay all the Odium of these
alterations with all his other Innovations in Religion only on his Majesty, to
render him odious to his people, to cloak his own shame, extenuate his own
guilt, and then to publish it in print to all the World to his perpetual
dishonor, when there was no necessity, and that by pretext of his Majesty's
special command was such a disloyalty and transcendent aggravation of his
crime as no age can parallel, no punishment expiate, but that which the
Gunpowder Traitors justly suffered. Besides this after the publication of his
^peech in Star Chamber, he specially employed Doctor Heylin to justify these
alterations to the world in print; in his Moderate Answer to the seditious and
scandalous chalenges See his speech in Star Chamber, p. 73 and Heylins Preface.
of Henry Burton (as he styles them) written by his * special command, and
licensed by his Chaplain, p. 150. to 157. and ordered Christopher Dowe to
second him herein, in his Innovations unjustly charged upon the present Church
and State, p. 136, to 14^. where thus he writes: Secondly I say that (the
alteration of those Prayers) being done by the same authority that first set
them forth, it is neither for him nor me, nor anyother of inferior rank to
question them, but with humble reverence to submit to their judgments, and to
think them wiser and far more fit to order those things that belong to then
places, than we; whom it neither concerns, nor indeed can know the reasons
that move them either to do or alter anything: But more particularly, that
which he objecteth against the former, is, that they would not hereby have all
Jesuits and Papists termed a Babylonish and Antichristian Sect, but restrain
it to some few of them, and mentally transfer it to those Puritanes who cry,
down with Babylon, that is, popery. But what then? what if out of a charitable
respect to those which in that Religion are peaceable and honest men (as no
doubt but some of them, whatsoever Master B. believes of them, are such) they
are not willing, nor think it fit to pray for the rooting up and confusion of
all Papists, indiscriminatim, under those harsh terms; surely charitably
minded Christians cannot but approve such an alteration, if there were no other
ground than that for it: As for any man's transferring it to Puritanes, that is
as mere a surmise as it is a false slander, that any of those whom he intimates
do call Rome Jerurusalem, or Popery the true Catholic Religion: Yet I know
not why such furious cryers down of popery (as Master B. has showed himself)
may not be accounted of a Baby NOTE.
lonish and Antichristian Sect as well as any Jesuit in the world, nor why we
may not pray (and that with better reason than Master B. would have men to do,
and under those titles against the Hierarchy of our church, that God would root
them out of the Land, etc. Wherein he makes zealous opposers of popery, and
those the world then styled Puritanes, more dangerous persons, and fitter to be
rooted out of the Land as a Babylonish and Antichristian Sect, than papists or
Jesuits. Now thus to justify this alteration in so daring, impudent a manner,
in favor of popery priests, Papists, Jesuits, what a transcendent crime it is,
and of what a rotten popish spirit it savours, let all impartial persons
determine.

The third purgation made by himself, discovering the hidden popery of his
heart, is his purging out this notable clause against popery, in the first
Collect of the public book of prayers, appointed at the general Fast for
ceasing the Plague, in the year 1636. Thou have delivered us from Superstition
and Idolatry, wherein we were utterly drowned, and have brought us into the
most clear and confortable light of thy blessed Word, by which we are taught
how to serve and honouor thee, and how to live orderly with our Neighbors in
truth and verity. The King by his Proclamation Anno 1636. commanded that the
Book of prayers for the Fast, formerly set forth by authority, should be
reprinted, re-published, and likewise used in all Churches and places at the
public meetings during this Fast. The Archbishop instead of re-printing the
book formerly set forth by authority, purges this clause out of it in the new
impression, though used in the Fast-books upon like occasions in Queen
Elizabeth's and King James their several reigns, and in that of 1. Caroli; and
that upon these very grounds which should have moved him to retain it still,
had his heart been upright or sincere to God and our Religion, because it lays
a just censure and blemish upon popery, by stiling it superstition and
idolatry, and thankfully recites Gods goodness to us in delivering us from
Popish superstition and idolatry, wherein we were utterly drowned, and bringing
us into the most clear and comfortable light of his holy Word, by which we are
taught how to serve and honor him, etc. A clause so pious, so just and
equitable, that it is almost a miracle, how any but a most inveterate Papist
could except against it; yet this Arch bishop is so irreconcileably angry with
it, that it must be wholly obliterated and quite omitted out of this new
impression; and that without any special order or command from his Majesty
(which he pleaded for the former alterations in the Gunpowder-treason book) or
any suggestion from Papists; Priests or Jesuits, who were scandalized with it,
(for he does not so much as pretend any such thing in his justification of this
purge) but by his own papal authority, contrary to his Majesty's
Proclamation, out of his own metro popish genius; which persuades us, that the
former alcerations in the book for the fifth of Novem. proceeded originally from
himself too as well as this however he would translate it to the K. himself.
Moreover, in the Order for the Fast, in the very last page of the book he
purged out these words condemning the popish Doctrine of the meritorionsnesse
of fasting. viz. to avoid the inconvenience that may grow by fasting; some
esteeming it a Meritorious Work; others, a good Work and Of itself acceptable
to God without due regard of the end, etc. In brief, whatever in this
Fast-book did in the least degree reflect upon popery or seemingly oppugn any
errors of it, this Arch-prelat out of his ardent zeal against Popery, and
fatherly care for the maintenance of our Protestant Religion, did totally
expunge it, non obstante his Majesty's Proclamation to the contrary.

For this Jesuiticall practice, the Archbishop being justly taxed by the
Author of News from Ipswitch and Master Henry Burton in his Humble Appeal to
his Majesty, page 3. and his Sermon on the fifth of November 1636. entitled,
For God and the King, p. 141. to 149. He reputed the very dislike of these his
Romish purgations such a crime, that he arraigned these books and the Authors
of them in Star Chamber, as capital malefactors, procured the heaviest,
bloodiest, unjustest sentence against them, that ever was inflicted by that
Court; and had the impudency for only to justify these purges in print, by
his two popish Champiors, Doctor Heylyn in his Moderate Answer to the seditious
and scandalous Challenges of Henry Burton. p. 157. to 16^. and Christopher Dow,
in his Innovations unjustly charged upon the present Church and State, p. 141.
to 150. but even in open Court, in a large and bitter speech, at the sentence
of his Accusers in Starte-chamber, June 14. 1637. which he had the boldness
afterward to publish to all the world: In which Page 23, 24.
Speech, though he cunningly omitted these expurged clauses, which if recited
at large had no color of defense; yet he justifies the expurging of them to be
his own voluntary act; adding that it was lawful for him and his brother
Bishops (notwithstanding the Kings Proclamation) so altar what they thought
fit: And then renders this most absurd reason of blotting out the first recited
clause: Thirdly, for the branch in the other, which is the first Collect,
Though God did deliver our forefathers out of Romish superstition, yet (God be
blessed for it) we were never in: And therefore that clanse being unfittingly
expressed, We thought fit to pass it over. Which reason is altogether untrue:
First, because there are many ancient people yet living among us who were
totally drowned in popish superstition and idolatry in Queen Marie's days, and
the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, from which God has graciously
delivered them since and brought them into the most clear and comfortable light
of his holy word, of later years, when preaching and godly preaching Ministers
have been more frequent in most places of our Realm then in the beginning of
Reformation, when they were very rare, scarce one or two in a whole County:
Secondly, we our selves were utterly drowned in popish superstition and
idolatry in our forefathers, and delivered out of it in their deliverance from
it; otherwise, we had continued drowned therein till this very day; As
therefore the sacred Scripture in direct and proper terms often informed the
Posterity of the Children of Israel, whose Ancestors many generations before
were bondslaves in, and delivered out of Egypt; I brought YOU forth of Egypt,
and brought YOU forth of the house of bondage, and have brought YOU to the Land
which I swear unto your Fathers, etc. Judge. 2. 1. c. 6. 89. 2 Chro. 7. 22. Jer.
2. 6. 7. Hag. 2. 5. and as Daniel in his solemn prayer and fasting blessed God
for this mercy in his days, as if the deliverance had bin then wrought for that
generation, Dan. 9. 15. And NOW oh Lord our God, thou have brought thy people
forth of the Land of Egypt by a mighty hand, and have gotten thee renown AS AT
THIS DAY; and as God upbrayded the Israelites for their ingratitude to him for
this mercy, in Jeremiah's days, as if this deliverance had then been wrought
for that Generation, Ier. 2. 6, 7. Neither said they, Where is the Lord that
brought us up out of the Land of Egypt, and that led as through the
Wilderness, through a Land of deserts and of pits, through a Land of drought,
and of the shadow of death? etc. And I brought you into a plentiful Country,
to eat the fruit thereof, and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye
defiled my Land, and made mine heretage an abomination; wherefore I will plead
with you, says the Lord, and with your childrens children will I plead: So we
by like congruity of reason, and in proper Scripture phrase (which this
Arch-prelate styles an unfitting expression, though frequent in all Authors as
well as in the sacred Text) may as truly be said, to be delivered from Popish
superstition and idolatry, wherein we were utterly drowned; and ought to bless
and praise God for the deliverance of our forefathers out of it, as if we our
selves had been actually delivered, their deliverance being in truth the cause
of ours, and an actual deliverance unto us from this Egyptian Romish bondage
and Antichristian deluge: This excuse therefore of his is but a mere
ridiculous pretense to delude the simple; and the true reason of this
expanction only this: His Grace-ship had conspired with Priests and Jesuits
once more to drown us utterly in Romish superstition and idolatry, and to
deprive us of the clear and comfortable light of Gods holy Word, by
extinguishing, silencing, suppressing most godly lights, Ministers, preaching
throughout the realm, and to corrupt the true worship of God with
superstitious Ceremonies and idolatrous Adorations, if not to extirpate truth
and verity from among us, by introducing equivocations, hypocrisy, false
accusers of the brethren in every place: therefore this passage so contrary to
his popish designs must not be tolerated in any wise, but utterly deleated,
and He so impudent as to instifie it before all the world, when he neitther saw
not dreaded any superior powers to draw him into question for this
transcendent crime, for which wet rust he shall now give an exact account to
this supreme Tribunal.

The fourth purgation made by his special direction and advice, was in the
second Edition of Doctor Christopher Potter's, Want of Charity justly charged,
London, 1634. This Doctor being about to publish a second Edition of that book
of his, writ thus unto his Lordship, to send him directions to alter or correct
any thing that should be offensive to his Grace.

My most honored Lord, etc.
THe Copies of my answer to the mistaker are most sold, and a new Impression
intended, I am now reviewing it. I shall be glad to receive from your Grace, by
your servant Master Dell, or others, any direction to alter or correct, if any
thing be therein offensive to you: I humbly commend your Grace to the blessed
protection of the Lord Almighty, and will be ever your Graces in all humility.

BUt to the last clause of your Letter, about the re-printing of your book, I
have done that which you so have desired; as you will see by this enclosed
paper: they are but a few scattered phrases, and I put them to your
consideration, as much for convenience and charitable expression, as for truth:
Do what you will with them so you mistake not me, in that which your self
have caused me to do: but in that place, page 26. where you say, it may (viz.
Mat. 11. 17.) be understood of any Assembly, as well civil as Ecclesiastical;
NOTE.
do you not thereby give as much power to the Parliament as to the Church in
Church affairs? I read in haste, and it may be a mistake, but you shall do
very well to consider it: so in haste I leave you to the grace of God, etc.

Impression, belike by this Prelate direction, as well as these forementioned.

The fifth purgations and alterations of highest consequence for the
introducing of sundry Popish doctrines, ceremonies, Transubstantiation and the
Mass it self, were by this Arch-prelat made in that Common-prayer-booke,
which he endeavored to enforce upon the Church of Scotland, all written with
his own hand; (already mentioned at large in A necessary Introduction to the
Archbishop of Canterbury his Trial, page 156. to 164. to which the Reader may
resort for satisfaction herein;) which are so palpably popish and destructive
to our Religion, that this Prelate had no other plea or fence against them when
they began to be pressed upon him, but only the Act of Pacification and
Oblivion, which he peremptorily insisted on, though the Committee of the
Commons House, who managed the Evidence, alleged, that they were clearly
without this Act, and that they insisted on them only as Evidences to prove his
endeavors to introduce Popery, and his good affection thereunto, in
maitainance of the seventh and tenth original Articles of his impeachment, not
to prove him an Incendiary between both Kingdoms, in justification of the
twelfth original Article, to which he only pleaded the Act of Oblivion.

We shall next proceed to other purgations made by his Chaplains and
Creatures, no doubt by his special direction: Beginning first with a book
written by Sir Anthony Hungerford, who being a Papist in his younger days, and
afterward upon better consideration, converted to our Religion, did thereupon
write a Treatise to his Mother, then a Roman Catholic, to dissuade her from
that Religion, entitled, The Advice of a Son, professing the Religion
established in the present Church of England, to his dear Mother a Roman
Catholic; containing an acknowledgement of God his great mercy in bringing him
to the profession of the true religion established in the Church of England,
and advising, exhorting his children to persevere therein; Sir Edward
Hungerford his Son (a Member of the House of Commons) deposed upon Oath, that
about the year 1635. he carried this Book, writ by his Father Sir Anthony, to
the Archbishops Chaplain, Doctor Bray, to license for the Press, for the
satisfaction and conversion of other seduced Romanists; who perusing the same,
took exceptions at some harsh passages (as he termed them) against Popes and
Popery, in the 8. 14. 15. 17. and 62. pages thereof, which he told him must be
quite expurged, or else the Treatise must not pass the Press.

The passages were these: p. 8: Yet even those truths they recommended unto us,
upon as perilous and false a ground, as if a man should therefore believe
Christ Jesus to be the son of the living God, because the devil did confess
it: page 14. 15. They will acknowledge that the Pope may be as wicked a man in
life, as any other in the world, and by experience it has been found, that
sundry of them have scarce had matches in this kind; as for instance of one,
Pope Alexander the sixth, whom Guicciardine (though NOTE.
himself a Papist) does thus decipher: His manner and customs were dishonest,
little sincerity in his Administrations, no shame in his face, small truth in
his words, little faith in his heart, and less religion in his opinions; all
his actions were defaced with unsatiable covetousness, immoderate ambition,
barbarous cruelty; he was not ashamed contrary to the custom of former Popes
(who to cast some color over their infamy, were went to call them their
Nephews) to call his sons his children; and for such to express them to the
world. The bruit went, that in the love of his daughter Lucretia were
concurrent, not only his two sons, the Duke of Candy, and the Cardinal of
Valence, but himself also, that was her Father, who as soon as he was chosen
Pope, took her from her husband and married her to the Lord of Pesare, but not
able to suffer her husband to be his corrivall, he dissolved that marriage
also, and took her to himself, by virtue of Saint Peter's Keys, and it was
amongst other graces, his natural custom to use poysonings, not only to be
avenged of his enemies, but also to dispoyle the wealthy Cardinals of their
riches, and this he spared not to do against his dearest friend, till at the
last, having a purpose at a Banquet to poison diverse Cardinals, and for that
end appointed his Cupbearer to give attendance with Wine made ready for the
nonce (who mistaking the bottle gave the poisoned cup to him) was thus
himselffe dispatched by the just judgment of God that purposed to murder his
friends, that he might be their Heir: Thus far the Historian: page 17. I dare
presume it shall be made evidently to appear unto you in the presence of any
that would oppose it, that their principle concerning the Popes infallibility
(being the maine supporter of all Religion at this day in the Church of Rome)
is not so ancient by so many ages in the world, as is the Alcoran of that
accursed Mahomet: if the foundation be proved new, what rule can they propose
to secure your conscience for the antiquity of the building? their continued
Priesthood, their daily sacrifice, their satisfaction for sin, their works
of merit: page 62. I was withal persuaded in my conscience, and so rest yet,
that this transcendent power and Papatus, id est, Principatus, tam in
spiritualibus, quam in temporali^us, Panormitam.
usurpation of the Roman Bishop in the spiritual and civil Regiment of the
world, is so far a stranger to the Church of God, as that it could be no
other but the Kingdom of that man of sin, which agreeable to the prediction of
the holy Ghost, was to be raised in the bosom of the Church, for the last, the
most powerful, the most dangerous delusion of the christian world.

Verily any real, cordial Protestant might stand amazed, that an
Archbishop's Chaplain, professing himself a Protestant, should so far
scruple at such passages as these, against the Popes supremacy in the
spiritual and civil Regiment of the world; and those other dangerous points
of Popery censured in these passages, but especially at this relation of
Guicciardine a Popish Author concerning the Viciousness and Exorbitances of
some Popes lives, recorded by sundry other of their own Popish Writers; and
that passages of this nature must not now be remembered by our Writers, or
suffered to pass our Presses without an Index Expurgatorius; yet such was the
condition and degeneracy of these times, that Doctor Bray told Sir Edward
Hungerford he must give way for all these offensive passages to be expunged,
else neither of these Treatises should be printed: At which Sir Edward
admiring, demanded the reason why these clauses against Popery writ by his
Father (once a Papist) to satisfy others of that Religion, might not pass at
this time, as they did commonly in other English licensed Authors heretofore
without exception? Who answered, that we were now in a fair way to win the
Papists, and therefore we must not use any harsh phrases against them: adding,
that these passages would give offense to those of that Religion, and therefore
unless he would yield to have them expunged, he would by no means license the
Books: To which Sir Edward replied, that he being his Father's Executor and
trusted with his writings, would never consent they should be so mangled, but
would have all printed or none: Yet all the persuasions and friends he could
use would not prevail; unless these clauses were omitted, naught would be
licensed: Whereupon Sir Edward went to the Archbishop himself, and acquainted
him with all the premises, earnestly desiring his Grace that the Treatises
might be printed without these purgations, which would much muilate the
Treatises, and prejudice the Author: To whom the Archbishop gave this answer;
Sir, I have many employments, and am very busy now, and have trusted my
Chaplains with those things, to whom you must repair: Then Sir Edward
pressing him again, that they would not license them unless these passages
were rased out; the Archbishop answered, I refer this wholly to my
Chaplains, having many other employments my self, and therefore what they
think fit to be done, you must submit unto: Whereupon these Treatises were
then stopped from printing, till Sir Edward some two or three years after got
them printed at Oxford, in the year 1639. without these expunctions, or the
Archbishop's privity.

Doctor Daniel Featly, deposed upon Oath, that he having printed seventy
Sermons of his, preached upon several occasions, formerly licensed for the
Press; when the Book was ready to be published, the Archbishop having notice
of it, sent for him to Lambeth, and demanded of him whether he was not about to
publish some Sermons of his own in print; who answered yes my Lord; then he
demanded of him, whether his Sermons were licensed, and whether any of his
Chaplains had perused them or not? he answered, that they were licensed long
since when himself had power to license books, and printed by virtue of that
license, and that none of his Graces Chaplains had perused them: Then the
Archbishop said, he thought, being so near a neighbor to him, he would not
have published any thing without acquainting him first therewith: To which the
Doctor answered, that he intended as soon as ever the book was published, to
presen: his Grace in the first place with one of them. Then the Archbishop
commanded him, before he published these Sermons, to carry them to Doctor Bray
his Chaplain to peruse, to see if there were any offensive or unfitting
passages in them, to the end, that if any such were, they might be corrected or
expunged. To which the Doctor replied, that he hoped there were no such
offensive clauses in them, and that the book was already printed off, so as no
alterations could conveniently be made therein, without new printing the sheets
wherein they were made: yet in obedience to his Graces command, he would attend
Doctor Bray with his Sermons to the end he might license them before they
should be published; which he did accordingly: Doctor Bray having read over his
Sermons, gelt them exceedingly, and and purged out all the smart and masculine
passages against both the Papists. Jesuits and Arminians, to his great grief;
Whereupon he expostulated the matter with him why these passages of his, which
passed currently without exceptions at White. hal before King James, King
Charles, the University, and other public Auditories when they were preached,
and were highly approved of in former times, might not pass the press without
an Index expurgatorius now; alleging, that it would be a great injury to
himself, and much cost and prejudice to the Stationer to re-print so many
whole sheets as he had altered: But all this would not prevail, these passages
could not suit with the present times, and therefore they must stand purged, or
the book be totally suppressed: Hereupon the Doctor acquainted Sir Edmund Scot
therewith by way of complaint, and moved him to inform the Archbishop of it;
who answered him, that he conceived it would be to no purpose to complain, for
he thought the Archbishop's Chaplains had directions from their Lord for what
they did, and that his Grace would not alter any thing of this kind done by his
Chaplains; whereupon he submitted and complained no further; and so the
Stationer was enforced to re-print some sixteen or eighteen sheets anew that
Doctor Bray had thus altered and purged (which Master Bourne the Stationer
likewise deposed) to his great prejudice and cost.

Master Thomas White a Minister deposed, that Doctor Clarke, one of the
Prebends of Canterbury, a very learned, pious Divine, and one of the
Translaters of the Bible, leaving the copyes of diverse of his choysest
Sermons, written with his own hand, in his custody at his death, which he
desired him to see carefully printed for the public good after his decease; he
thereupon, in discharge of this his trust, repaired to Doctor Heywood, the
Archbishop's household Chaplain, to peruse and authorize for the press; who
receiving no less then forty shillings for his fee for perusing and licencing
them, expunged all the chief passages in them against the Pope, Popery,
Priests, Jesuits, Arminianisme, Arminians, and did in some places alter and
corrupt the authors words so far as to make him an Arminian in those very
points, wherein he opposed their Arminian opinions, and utterly refused to
license one Sermon of his, concerning Election, because the whole scope of it
was against Arminius and his errors. At which Master White being very much
discontented, to see his deceased friend's Sermons so abused, demanded his
entire copy and moneys again, but could procure neither of them, but the copy
thus altered and expunged, which must either be totally suppressed or printed
as he had castrated it: Whereupon he carried some other of his Sermons to
Doctor Weeks and Doctor Baker, (the Archbishops great creatures) Chaplains
to the Bishop of London, who made the like alterations and purgations in them,
as Doctor Haywood had made in the rest; an exact catalogue whereof amounting to
210. corruptions and purgations, Master White presented at the Bar upon his
oath, which were afterward made use of and reduced under several heads.

Master Chetwin attested, that Dr. William Jones of East-Berghall in Suffolk,
writ a Comentary on the Epistles of Paul to Philemon and the Hebrews, which he
carried to Dr. Samuel Baker, Chaplain to the Bishop of London, (Anno 1636.) a
great Instrument of the Archbishop's, to license for the Press; who purged
out all the principal clauses in it against Altars, Images, Mass,
Transubstantiation, Popery, Papists, and for the sanctification of the Lord's
day; a catalogue of the most whereof he had collected out of the written copy,
which was so obliterated, that he could not read the same in many places, above
150. lines being made unlegible. That this book being printed according to the
expunged, altered copy, which otherwise could not pass the Press, the good
old Dr. upon the perusal of it after its printing, was so much discontented at
the alterations and purgations made therein without his privity, that he
disclaimed into be his work, saying, it was the Licencer's only, not his; who
had made him a favorite of those Papish opinions, by his corrupting and
changing his words, which he professedly oppugned, refuted in his own genuine
work; The regreete of which injury went so near his heart, that he fell sick
through discontent, and soon after dyed; and is by these alterations and
purgations, which were generally taken notice of, the sale of the book was
extremely hindered, to the great loss of the Stationer that printed it.

Peter Cole Stationer, living in Cornhill London, testified, that he printed
Master Richard Ward, his Comentary on Matthew anno 1639. out of which Doctor
Weeks the Licencer, purged so many principal passages against Popery and
Arminianisme, as amounted to two small written volumes collected by Mr. Ward
himself, who was much grieved, injured thereby, and the sale of the book quite
spoiled, to his great prejudice. These two small volumes with this ensuing
Abstract of them, were presented by Master Ward himself to the Parliament, who
examined this abuse at the Committee for printing.

Because it is an offense highly to be punished to abuse your Honors pious and
most just ears with untruths; I have therefore presumed to present to your
Honors view the heads and particular gross abuses which my poor Book has
suffered by the Licenser's too numerous obliterations: whereby it will appear
as clear as the Sun, that our Licensers liberty in the licensing of books
is most licencious, and that Popery and Pelaganisme were too much favored and
befriended by them; wholly leaving it to your grave, pious and prudent
consideration, how these and the like abuses may be best redressed for the time
to come.

First, the Licenser by his deleaturs, has made some places and passages of my
book ridiculous and nonsense, E. G. in my written copy sol. 338. the first
line, the Reader is referred for more full satisfaction to the foregoing
Objection; which Objection is wholly obliterated because it snited not with the
Licensers opinion; and thus the Reader of my book is referred to that which is
not in my book, but expunged out of it: What the Objections were which were
obliterated, your Honors may see in the greater of these two books, which I
present to this honorable Court, page 138. 139. Again, in my written copy,
sol. 339. I have these words; Our Savior seems here to imply that many
Antichrists under the name of Christ, shall deceive many, whence these
Questions following may be demanded, namely, etc. These words are printed, but
all the Questions promised were wholly expunged, save only one which concerns
not Antichrist at all; here my Reader is promised some Questions in the plural
number concerning Antichrist, but he finds but one only in the sigular number
concerning the true Christ: What these expunged Questions were, your Honors
may see in the greater book, page 65.

Again, in my written copy, fol. 366. I have these words; Here therefore I lay
down these three things, viz. etc. and this is printed, but the Reader finds
but two: for the second is expunged; and what it was your honors may read in
the lesser of these two books page 51. a. and another paralleled place, page
37. e.

Secondly, the Licenser by his obliterations, has in some places quite altered
and perverted the sense; E. G. In my written copy, fol. 18. I propound a
Question concerning the excellency of Baptism above Circumcision, and first
show what Pereius the Jesuit answers thereunto; and then what I justly except
against his answer, and upon what grounds: Now the Licenser here lets the
Jesuits answer stand, and expunges wholly what I say against it, making me thus
by my silence to seem to my Reader to subscribe to what the Jesuit affirms:
Your honors may see both Pererius and my own words in the greatest of these
two books, page 3. and another paralleled place in the lesser of these books,
page 48. l.

Thirdly, some places and passages by the Licensers deleaturs are maimed, lamed
and left altogether unsatisfactory to the intelligent and quick sighted Reader;
examples whereof your Honors have in the lesser book, page 9. f. and page 18.
d. and page 51. b. and page 58. a. great book page 49. line 2.

Fourthly, some words and sentences are by him changed and altered; as your
Honors may perceive by this lesser book, page 4. l. and page 21. b. and page
41. h. and page 42. b.

Fifthly and lastly, some places and passages are by the licenser so wholly
obliterated and expunged, that no prints or footsteps at all remain of what
was there; as will evedently appear to your Honors by the greater of these
books which I present to to your perusal, and by the Index expurgatorius
thereof, which I have here subjoyned.

Because the employments of this grave Senate and religious Assembly are so
many and weighty, that it wants leisure to read and peruse all which was
expunged out of my book, and which is contained in these two several
Manuscripts; I have therefore reduced all things contained in them both to some
few heads, and a most compendious Index; by which, as in a glass, your honors
may quickly take a view of them all, and readily turn to any thing you please
to peruse; If you should desire that I should refer your Honors to some
particular places and passages, then I humbly beseech yea to be pleased to cast
your eyes upon these which follow, wherein you shall find notable things
expunged, and things not altogether unworthy of your pious pains and
consideration, viz.

In the greater of these two Manuscripts, these; page 5. 11. 25. 27. 28. 65.
91. 93. 99. 102. 105. 109. 115. 125. 134. 137. 138. etc. that the fulfilling of
the Law is impossible, page 43. Quest. 1. and 57. Quest. 1. and 58. Quest. 2.
and 59. Object. and 128. that Election is not from a foresight of works, page
75. 81. 83.

In the lesser of these two Manuscripts these; page 1. a. and 2. a. c. and 4.
c. and 5. ll. and 6. d. and 8. a. c. and 10. b. and 12. a. and 14. a. and 16.
b. and 18. b. c. and 25. b. c. and 29. f. and 39. c. and 41. g. and 42. c. and
48. d. and 58. b. the things which were wholly expunged by the Licenser, may be
reduced to these few heads; namely;

First, things charged upon the Papists; in the greater book, page 5. and 71.
twice, and 109. 110. in the lesser book, page 4. c. and 25. b. c. and 40. b.

Secondly, points and passages tending to the overthrow of some Popish Tenants;
in the greater book, page 1. 2. 19. five, and 20. 27. In the lesser book, page
1. f. and 2. b. and 5. m. and 6. b. and 10. a. and 12. c. and 14. b. and 15. c.
and 17. h. and 18. a. and 36. b. and 40. d. and 52. d. e.

Thirdly, passages tending to the blemishing of seem Popish writers, and the
disgrace of Popery, and the unwarrantable practice of Popish people, and people
Popishly affected; in the lesser book, page 1. a. and 2. a. b. c. and 5. h. i.
l. and 6. a. and 8. a. and 9. e. and 17. g. and 44. a.

Fourthly, poyms mainly and Interminis, controverted between us and the
Papists; in the great book, page 11. 15. 17. 19. 23. 25. 26. 43. his. 57. 58.
59. 62. 63. his. 65. 67. 73. 75. 77. 81. 83. 85. 87. 89. 91. 93. 101. 121. 123.
124. 127. 131.

Fifthly, points and passages tending to the overthrow of Pelagainisme and
Arminianisme, or the Remonstrants tenants; in the greater book page 31. 33. 35.
37. 43. 53. 54. 62. 79. 97. 125. 130. 132. 138. 139. 140. in the lesser book,
page 1. d. and 4. a. b. d. e. and 9. g. and 18. e. f. and 19. g. and 25. a. and
28. c. and 29. d. and 40. a. e. and 51. a.

Sixthly, things not at all in controversy, viz. in the greater book, page 7.
9, 39. 41. 44. 45. 46. 47. 48. 49. 50. 51. 99. 105. 115. 123. 134. 135. in the
lesser book, page 5. k. and 6. e. and 8. e. and 9. d. and 10. d. e. and 11. f.
g. and 17. c. and 21. a. and 30. b. and 48. b. c. and 53. g. h. and 57. c.

Seventhly, passages tending to reprove the vices and evil customs of some
great ones; in the greater book, page 50. 51. and in the lesser, page 4. f. and
42. e. and 43. f.

Eighthly, passages and points obliterated, tending highly to the honor and
glory of God (in the lesser book, page 7. i. and 8. b. and 19. h. and 28. c.)
and of Christ (page 57. a.) and Diety of the holy Ghost, page 58. d.

Ninthly, the very sentences of Scripture expunged; in the lesser book, page 7.
b. and 21. b. c. and 23. a. and 27. f. and 58. d.

Thus I have made bold to make this godly and grave Senate acquainted with the
intolerable wrong which my weak labors have suffered by these obliterations,
and of the disgrace and discredit which bath reflected upon my self also
thereby; for those who are ignorant of the abuses done by the Licenser, must
needs impute all the absurdities and non sense, and lame and imperfect passages
either to the ignorance or negligence of the Author, this work being my first,
and I my self but little known in the world when I put it forth: And
therefore I humbly sue to this honorable Assembly, that you would be pleased
to license for the Press these notes contained in these two Manuscripts, which
were expunged by the Licenser, that thereby I may have power to re-print and
perfect my now most imperfect books: And your humble Petitioner shall be
always bound to pray to the Lord of glory and fountain of all grace, for a
blessing upon your proceedings, persons, estates, lives, souls and all than
concerns you.

Rich. Ward.

Many such like purgations in other new books might be produced, but we will
insist on these alone, reducing the several passages purged out of them under
distinct heads, which will infallibly evidence, and most perspicuously
demonstrate his Jesuiticall intentions, to usher the whole body of popery into
our Church by degrees, without the least public opposition: We shall begin with

1. Purgations of sundry notable passages against Popery it self in general,
which must not pass the Press upon any terms, but have a special deleatur
drawn over them.
In Doctor Clerks Sermons, page 431. Sermon 19. l. 10. in the printed copy,
Dr. Haywood the Licenser (the Archbishops own Chaplain) purged out this
clause against popery; God there expounds himself, least some Papists say,
it is but my gloss; POPERY IS IDOLATRY by God's own censure there, that prays
unto Images. It seems this practice and popery must not now be called Idolatry
(as our Homilies against the peril of Idolatry, and all our writers formerly
use to style it) for that would scandalize the papists and make people to
abhor popery, so as never to embrace it.

Ibidem Sermon 20. page 443. l. 6. Popery a patchery and mere medley of moldy
heresies; are deleted by the Licenser: It must have the honorable title of the
old Religion still, these two downright Epithites will overmuch disgrace it.

Ibidem Sermon 20. page 451. 452. this passage is expunged as scandalous to the
Roman Religion: When he (the Pope or Priest) preaches, it is lightly of
legendary lies; all Romes Religion is almost lies: If I shall say, the
Clergymen lie not, I shall lie too: not lightly in his Doctrine, though the
Romanists do, that write and preach lies.

Master Richard Ward in his Comentary upon Matthew, had these passages
obliterated among sundry others: We may justly fear that our Church shall have
her period, when the Word shall depart from us to some other Nation that has
not enjoyed it, by a relapse into Popery, as we did in Queen Mary's time; or
that we shall be overwhelmed by Atheism, and (as Rome does now) only retain
a false show of a Church, being drowned either with some blind superstition, or
impious corruption; therefore we should be afraid of Superstition,
profaneness, impiety and contempt of the Word of God, least our bread be
taken away and given unto the dogs, etc. Some works are odious unto God, but
grateful unto men, as to temporize, to flatter and sooth up great men, to
embrace the Religion commanded by their Kings and Governors, be it never so
Idolatrous, false and superstitious; these works are not to the done.

In Doctor Featlye's Sermons, styled Clavis Mystica, page 226. the Doctor
having spoken something against gaudy Images, Tapers, Perfumes, and prayer in
an unknown tongue in the Roman Church, concluded thus; But me thinks I have
stayed too long in the TEMPLE OF RIMMON, I return therefore to the Temple of
the living God: This Doctor Bray the Archbishops Chaplain, blotted out, as
scandalous to the Church of Rome, causing the whole sheet to be reprinted: And
in the very last Sermon and page of his book, page 907. he purged out this
whole devout prayer in the close of the Sermon, only because this phrase, of
bowing to the Romish Baal, was comprised therein: Purge our polluted
consciences by faith in his blood; that though our sins be as red as scarlet,
yet they may be made as white as woole. Vouchsafe to look down from thy
highest Throne of Majesty upon this whole Land prostrating her self at thy
footstool, and wallowing in dust and ashes; despise not the sighing of so
many contrite hearts; despise not the prayers of so many thousands, which thou
know proceed not out of fained lips; set a mark upon those that mourn in
secret for all those impieties, iniquities, impurities and abominations which
it is not in their power to redress, and spare the Kingdom for their sake who
never have bowed to the ROMISH BAAL, nor given way to any corruption of thy
pure worship, but have sought thee with an upright heart. O Lord, for our
sins thou did deservedly smite us with Pestilence after the manner of
Egypt; yet when we turned to thee by fasting, weeping and mourning, thou
commandedst thy Angel to sheath his sword: and since that thou threatnedst to
send a famine amongst us, and cleanness of teeth in all our coasts; yet when
we humbled our selves before thee, as at this day, thou commandedst the wind
and clouds and they obeyed thee, and for sowing one day in tears, we reaped in
joy the harvest of the whole year: And now O Lord, what is our hope? our hope
is even in thee: the clouds are gathered together from diverse parts of the
earth, and they threaten thundering and lightning in such sort, that we have
just cause to fear a black and dismal day, a bloody day of invasion, and
utter desolation near at hand: Yet O Lord, behold this whole Nation as one
man, stretching out her hands unto thee, behold thy Son stretching out his
hands on the Cross for her: Hear us we beseech thee for our Prince, and our
Prince for us; hear us for the Peers and Nobles, and the Peers and Nobles
for us; hear us for the Commons and the Commons for us; hear us for this
whole Church, and the Church for us, and Christ for all: Remove our sins as a
cloud and our transgressions as a mist, and let the light of thy countenance
and beams of thy favor shine upon us, and dry up those tears, which out of
the bitterness of our hearts we now shed abundantly before thee, so shall we
thy people and sheep of thy pasture, sing unto then in the great congregation,
and praise thy name even to our last breath, Amen.

Strange is it, that so devout and pious a prayer as this, should be totally
expunged for stiling Mass and popery the Romish Baal.

What the true intention and design in purging out these and the following
passages against Popery were, will most clearly, yea infallibly appear by these
remarkable clauses expunged by the Licenser out of Doctor Jones his Comentary
upon the Hebrews. In the Manuscript copy, page 443. the Doctor upon these
words; Follow peace with all men: had comented thus; We must distinguish
between Peace and Familiarity; We may be at a general peace even with the
enemies of God; but we must not be familiar with them: There is danger in that:
Be at peace with a Papist, but be not familiar with a Papist. Secondly, We may
be at peace with the persons of all, but with the vices NOTE.
of none: Be at peace with a Papist, but not with his Popery and Idolatry: Be
at peace with a drunkard, but not with his drunkenness; reprove that, show thy
dislike of that: The Licenser obliterates these two clauses (omitted wholly
thereupon out of the printed copy) page 560. Be at peace with a Papist, but be
not familiar with a Papist; be at peace with a Papist, but not with his Popery
and Idolatry: Their design was to reconcile us to Rome, and therefore this
Doctrine, that we must not be familiar with papists, though we be at peace with
them, because there is danger in that; and that we must not be at peace with
their Popery and Idolatry, but only with their persons; must by all means be
totally expunged, as heterodox and scismaticall Doctrine.

The same Doctor in his Manuscript copy, page 236. had this passage closed with
a good prayer: England that was ever rude and barbarous, is now become civil
and religious; and all that ever received the Beast's mark, have now banished
the Beast; and NOTE.
GOD GRANT MAY NEVER CHANGE FROM THAT: The Licenser, whose design was
consonant to his Arch-masters projects, to have us change to popery and receive
the Beast and his mark again, quite rased out these words, relating
particularly to England (totally omitted in the printed Book, page 278.) And
all that ever received the beast's mark, have now banished the beast, and God
grant it may never change from it. Was not this a Romish beast indeed, and no
true Protestant, who durst obliterate such a passage?

The Doctor in his written copy, page 93. used this disswasion from popery to
those who pleaded the example of their forefathers continuance in it; Thy
Father was a spend-thrift and made all away, and will thou do so too? Thy
father had the Frenchpox for his unclean life, and must thou desire it too? so
thy Father had the Romish NOTE.
Pox, being infected with the Romish Religion, therefore must thou obstinately
continue in that disease? All this the Licenser totally deleted: and thereupon
it is left out of the printed copy, page 128. where it should have been
inserted.

The Doctor in his Manuscript, page 148. had this passage; If he happen to be
seduced by Papists or other heretics, we that are preachers must have
compassion on such. The Licenser wholly raseth out: If he happen to be seduced
by Papists or other Heretics: NOTE
because the design was, we should be seduced by such; and in such a case
Preachers must have no compassion on us; therefore it is omitted in the printed
copy, page 196.

Finally, the Doctor in his Manuscript, page 106. had this serious Exhortation:
We have begun in pure and sound religion, Let us not end in Popery, in
Atheism, in NOTE.
Brownisme, in Anabaptisme. The Licenser to demonstrate where he and his
Archgrace would have us end and settle at last; blots out the word popery, and
puts in profaneness in its stead; and so it is is printed, page 140. Let us
not end in profaneness, instead of, Let us not end in Popery; in which they
then intended we should all shortly end, though God (by his omnipotent power
and admirable providence) has wholly frustrated this their intended end: We
shall now proceed to another head of expunctions, to wit,

2 Passages expunged out of books tendered to license, against the Papacy,
Rome, the Popes Supremacy, Pride, Tyranny, Cruelty, Treasons, murdering and
deposing Princes: Popes vicious lives, practices, and being Antichrist, that
man of sin, etc.
Doctor Jones in his Comentary on the Hebrews, had inserted these several
passages against the Pope in his written copy, which the Licenser expunged as
insufferable, and thereupon they are quite omitted in the printed book, page
179. 251. 309. 377. 396. 406.

Page 206. in the written copy; Our Savior Christ was as wise a man as the
Pope, furnished with gifts for both affices as well as he, yet he would not
meddle with civil matters, Luke 12. 14. of the extraordinary example of
Melchesedeck, no ordinary rule can be made. Page 266. All papists kiss the
Pope's feet, yea Kings, Princes and Emperors (says the copy) yea in so doing
they make an Idol of him, as the idolaters kissed Baal. Page 284. Antichrist
has been discovered, every man may see what he is, unless the God of the
world blind their eyes, naught is wanting, unless it be the open conversion of
the Jews. Page 301. Nay the Pope himself he must be carried on men's shoulders.

Page 308. The holy Ghost thinks it sufficient to call Christ the great Priest;
that will not content the Pope, he must be Sacerdos maximus: Christ has the
positive, he must have the superlative; a proud prelat, that Antichrist that
exalts himself above God. Page 130. As for the calling of Luther, Calvin and
Beza, and of the Ministers of the Gospel, it is warrantable by the Word, we can
show our Letters of Orders from Jesus Christ, the great Bishop of our souls:
Are we not true Ministers, because we are not created by the Pope and his
Bishops? The Apostles were not made by the Pharisees, or any priests of that
time yet good Ministers; and so may we though not made by the Bishop of Rome:
it is succession (...), not (...), as Nazianzen speaks; that is, a good,
lawful succession. Good God! that such passages as these should ever be
expunged by such who profess themselves protestant prelates or Ministers!
certainly they had a Pope in their hearts, whatever good words we find in their
mouths.

Master Ward in his Comentary upon Matthew, had an Index expurgatorius passed
on these ensuing clauses, against the Pope his pardons, power and usurped
authority; fol. 224. The Pope is called the Adversary, or he who opposes
himself against Christ, 2 These. 2 11. and is justly so called, because he and
his admirers do maintain assertions directly contrary to the word of Christ;
one example whereof we have in this verse; Whosoever shall put away his Wife.
Fol. 314. Quest. 7. We have no need of a second purging. How derogatory then
are the Papists to the sufferings of Christ, who ascribe more to the Popes
pardons then to Christ's pangs: Antichrist by his indulgencies, can both
deliver and preserve from purgatory, and send the soul straight into Heaven,
but they will dye in the quarrel before they will grant such or so much power
and efficacy to be in the death bloodshed and merits of Christ, fol. 160.
Quest. 2. who are like unto the Pharisees? etc. Answ. The Church of Rome, whose
commandments are more observed then the commandments of God; as appear, by
this; it is there taught, etc. II. That to eat flesh upon a good Friday, is a
greater sin then to commit murder, or adultery, and yet that is the Friday
on which Christ did ordinarily eat the paschall Lamb. III. To blaspheme the
name of God in this world is a small offense, but to speak ill of the Pope
(especially in Italy and Spain) is an unpardonable and damnable offense. IV.
The Jews have a Religion whereby they affirm Christ to be a cozener; but to
say that there is no other purgatory but the blood of Jesus Christ, is a crime
deserving the inquisition. V. Every Bishop of France may give absolution for
faults committed against the law of God) but they cannot absolve men of sin^
committed against the Pope and his Sea. Secondly, in the Roman church they
teach things contrary to the Word of God; for first, God says, etc. II. God
says in his Law, six days shall thou labor, but the Pope says, thou shall
not labor six days, but shall observe the Feasts commanded by the Pope to be
observed. IV. God's commands by his Apostle, 1 Cor. 10. That when we are
invited to the house of Infidels, we should eat of that which is set before us,
making no scruple: On the contrary, the Church of Rome commands, when we are
invited to the house of Heretics, not to eat of all that which is set before
us in Lent, or on Good Friday, and fasting days. Fol. 163. Answ. 2. Let us
avoid all Popish errors. Answ. 3. Thirdly, they are to blame also, who bind
themselves by a Vow, not to eat flesh upon some certain days, and upon such
days have no other care then to abstain from flesh only.

Ibid. On Mat. 15. 9. these passages are oblitered: In vain do they worship
me.

These words being urged by us against the Popes power in making laws, which
binds the conscience, Bellarmine answers three things thereunto, namely:

First, by the Commandments of men, are understood Commandments which are
contrary to the law of God, but the Popes precepts are not so: To this we
answer.

I. All the commandments of men, in whose observation the worship of God is
placed, is expressly and directly condemned; for God is to be worshipped as
himself prescribes.

II. All such commandments are contrary to the law of God, which says, Thou
shall not add to the word which I command thee; namely, in substantial
things, or which are imposed as essential parts of God's worship.

III. There is no mystical ceremony introduced or brought into the Church by
the Popes or Popish Clergy, which was less contrary to the laws of God, then
was that tradition of washing hands before meat, which was ordained by the
Elders of the Jews.

Secondly, the Jesuit answers, that our Savior blames here only unprofitable
and frivolous ceremonies, only invented by a humane brain or spirit; but the
precepts of the Pope are no such: To this we answer,

I. If all the Jews, both Priests and people, did use such foolish and
frivolous ceremonies, as Bellarmine here says are condemned, then why may not
the Pope and Papists use such, or be guilty of the same error.

II. All such mystical ceremonies which are brought now into the Church of
Rome without the warrant of God's Word, were invented by a humane spirit, for
the blessed Spirit of God never taught any other worship to the Church, then
that which Christ instituted, John 14. 26.

III. If many, yea most of their ceremonies be not frivolous, foolish and
ridiculous, I know not what is; but (as a work or subject not worth the
insisting upon) I pass it by.

Thirdly, the Jews (says Bellarmine) were taxed by Christ, because they
esteemed more highly of some humane laws then they did of the law of God, as
Mat. 23. 23. but the Papists do not so. To this I answer: that this was never
more seen in the Jews then in the Papists, as was clearly showed and proved in
the last Qestion of the former verse.

Many such like passages are purged out of this Author, which we pretermit.

But the grossest purgations of all the rest, were made by Doctor Bray in
Doctor Clarke's Sermons upon the fifth of November, and upon other occasions,
as will appear by these ensuing purgations, at which every zealous Protestant
may well stand amazed.

Page 228. 229. 230. etc. the Licenser has expunged this which follows: Such
another woman saw the Prophet Zachary, her name was Wickedness; Kins-woman to
this, nay was not this she? for the Prophet says, she was carried into
Babylon. And they say, Rome is Babylon; we say it, themselves say it. But I
will discharge the Pope so, to make his Holiness this Wickedness. Now what
this vision means, and who this woman is, an Angel expounds in the rest of the
chapter; look at the last verse; the woman is said there to be the great City
that usurps sovereignty over the whole earth; by which that Rome is meant, is
superfluous to prove, Romanists acknowledge it; and Rome too in a Metonimy; not
the streets and walls of Rome, but the power and policy and government of Rome;
they yield that also, but with caution, that we mean of Heathen Rome, not
Christian Rome, as it was the seat of Caesar's, not the seat of Popes, the
throne of Antichrist; they grant that too, but the Pagan Emperors must be that
Antichrist, not their Bishops. But I find it (with their favors) to be the
Church of Rome, and therefore this woman I expound to be the Papacy: I prove it
not, it is needless unto you, and bootlesse unto them; if their learned
labors who daily write of it, cannot persuade them, what am I to hope it? and
yet some of their Jesuits, Vega and Ribera, do now at length acknowledge it.
The woman then is Rome, not only Neronizing under Emperors, but also
tyrannizing under Popes; who she was in John's time does not skill us much, we
are to consider what she is now: It is not the Empire but the Church of Rome;
it was the Empire once that being converted, cherished the church: But filia
devoravit Matrem, the Church has choked the Empire, and is her self become
this woman: Now this bloody woman, drunken with the blood of Saints. In the
third chapter (whereof this chapter is a comentary) there is not one only, but
two Beasts, the first is the Empire, the latter is the Papacy, which therefore
had two horns, which are the Popes two swords, as in whom are met both power,
Patriarchall and Imperial. Pope Boniface professed it at the public Jubilee,
riding one day in the Habit of a Pope, and the next of an Emperor, commanding
to be cried, Ecce duo gladij hic; behold he had two swords. Nay, why should I
grant it was the Empire once? I mean this woman; what though the blood of
Saints were shed by Roman Emperors? yet this is not meant here; the Article is
relative, it referres us to the first verse, to the woman there; there she is
called a Whore; that title is proper only to the Papacy, superstition, and
Idolatry, and prodigious impiety, has cast the appellation of an Harlot upon
it. I am not worthy to hold the light to them that have written on this
Prophecy; but me thinks they need not yield that this vision concerns the
Empire, but merely the Pope, for this whorish woman is said at the second
verse, to have made drunk all Kings with her abominations, that is, with her
idolatry; shall I say all Nations had their idolatry from Rome, I mean the
Empire? where read we it? where prove we it? nay but Rome had rather her
idolatry from them: It worshipped all the gods of all the countries that it
conquered. That I read both in profane and Ecclesiastical History; What
needed the Empire to teach the Empire that they had before? it learned of them,
it taught them not, being tied to so short a time. I cannot argue any point;
that to prove the Pope this woman, the title of Antichrist is intayl'd to him,
and the number of the beast falls fit to him: What need I when so many and so
learned books proves them both; yea, as the high Priest prophesied of Christ
unwillingly; so has a learned Bishop of our Land observed, that one of the
Popes men has inscribed a book to him, and in his simplicity, has put the
beasts name on him, Paulo quinto vice-Deo, To Paul the fifth Vice-God: In the
numerall letters of these words is just contained the number of the beasts,
666. Nay, but the Pope will none of it, if the date be not out and expired in
the Empire; but we will needs extend it unto these times too, and make the
woman, the Malignant church, then it is the church of England; we are this
woman, we prosecute, we execute, we shed the blood of Saints, even this
very church of Canterbury, both shed the blood of Saints, Saint Thomas Beckets
blood: it is not the Popes of Rome, but the Kings and Queens of England; King
Henry was this woman, Queen Elizabeth, King James, all slaughterers of Saints;
witness Sir Thomas Moore's and Bishop Fisher's blood; witness Saint Campions
and Saint Gornets blood, a blood that wrought miracles. If Canonists say
truly, that if the Pope send troops of souls to hell, no man may oppose him:
Domine cur sic facis, ask him why he does so? shall I be unmannerly, if I list
to lose a little and belie our Kings, to cry Domine cur sic dicis, ask him why
he says so? the Pope has power to alter substances and can he not change
qualities, make Treason, Holiness, and Traitors, Saints? But it is Harlots
manner to call honest women Whores: This proves the Pope rather to be this
whorish woman; constat de persona, we have the person: Pilate said of Christ,
behold the man; I may say of Christ's Vicar, behold the woman: We have her
person, let us have her parts. The Woman is discribed, etc.

All Princes have become his Vassals, and I think he tied them to pay tribute
and blood; so pleasing to the Pope's palate, that howsoever they have differed
in their lusts to meats, some to Peacock and some to Porke, all of them have
liked one kind of drink, and that is blood: Let no man wrangle, etc.

What does the Pope pop us in the mouth with Emperors? Julian the most
malicious of them all, vexed the Christians, but would shed no blood; but the
Pope is all for blood; his Bulls and Briefes like Dracoes laws, written not with
Ink but blood. I plead not for the Heretic, as if I held he might not suffer
death, such may be the Heresy; but the Pope maintains distinction between
mortal sin and venial, holds it toward God, and fails it to the Pope; are
some venial to Gods self, and all mortal to God's Vicar? pardons may be
purchased for offenders against God, but he must dye the death that trespasseth
the Pope: The least ill word, Pope Alexander punished with death, their own
liege people write it; Onuphrius, etc.

Bona verba quaeso; it is the Pope, the shamefuller his sin, the holy Father,
to spill holy blood; belike as Parsons said he had a holy Italy, so the Pope
happily has a holy thirst; for why not? why not sacra sitis, as well as sacra
fames? or does his Holiness mistake the blood? he might if Popes could err,
but they cannot, and he does not; but wittingly and willingly he sheds the
blood of Saints: Feign would he cover this impious blood thirstinesse, by
calling them Hugonists, Lollards and Heretics: For the two first of them, I
know no harm in them; and for the third, what Harlot will not call an honest
woman whore? The faith which they have suffered for and their holiness have
Sainted them, without the Popes canonization: They may be Saints though not of
his making and of a better order then the Popes, to wit, of the holy Ghosts, he
is the right Saint maker, etc.

So sweet is blood to the throat, that he sheds it where he finds it, be it of
what rank, what sex, what age soever, etiam in infantem (says Tertullian)
nullius hostem, nullius reum, etc. the harmless Infant that has done no hurt,
that does think no hurt, even his blood will this Herod have; what do I call
him Herod? a more inhumane blood-sucker then ever Herod was, then ever Pharaoh
was; both of them shed the blood of babes newborn, this monster spils the
blood of babes unborne; a Kid night not be sod in the mothers milk, this beast
spares not the babe in the mothers womb, etc.

A woman that affects the title of Holiness, her head the Popes holiness, her
self, holy Mother Church, can this holy woman murder holy men? she that
canonizeth Saints, the founder of their feasts, the builder of their Temples,
the adorner, the admirer, the adorer of Saints, can she shed the blood of
Saints? she can, she does, and that in such abundance.

Drunkenness beseems any ill, a Bishop worst; of all men Churchmen should be
sober; what a sight is this? John sees here a Bishop drunken; the Universal
Bishop, the Prince, Patriarch, the Pope drunken; for we are bold under his
benedicite, to make that man, this woman, not wine-drunke (though by their
leave some of these are noted for that too, as Leo 10 and Nicholas 5.) but
blood-drunken, etc.

Wherefore are the Jesuits in France, and here, and every where, but to be his
slaughtermen, to shed Kings blood? their feet swift to spill it, because his
throat lusts to swallow it; be wise now therefore O ye Kings, and be learned by
France, O ye Princes of the earth; at least let the Lion learn by the Flower
de luce, to watch not the Jesuit only, whose fingers itch to spill his blood,
but the Recusant also, as very a Traitor in his heart as he; the Lord convert
their persons, and confound their plots, as many as look at Jacob with an
Esan-eye, etc. The woman that rid on a beast of hell, hammers her bloody plots
from the forge of hell, the Pope, etc.

The wicked Antichrist would purchase heaven by sending us to hell: had the
Romish Canibols thirsted for our blood, yet charity would they should have
wished well to our souls; but the Pope like Satan, the son like to the sire,
malices even our souls; he would have sacrificed our blood, and our souls
should have ascended into the flames of the Altar, not like Manoahs-Angel into
heaven, but our souls and bodies too, into that part of the Air, where the
prince of the Air and his angels have their residence, that is in votis, the
Pope wished it so, I will not say, etc.

Their Jupiter Latialis, their Lord God the Popel or their Jupiter Infernalis,
their Lord God the Devil, should have many Hecatombees, etc.

The Vicar of Christ, a sticker of Christians, the successor of Saint Peter, a
worker with saltpeter; he that makes God's blood of Wine, to drink man's blood
as Wine.

In Doctor Clerks second Sermon on the fifth of November, page 237. the
Licenser has obliterated three whole leaves together, against the tyranny,
bloodinesse and viciousness of Popes and their Instruments, so as they cannot
be read; and in the same Sermon, page 234. 235. 237. he has deleated these
clauses and phrases. The spawne of Antichrist; Romes Martyrs and canonized
Saints, I hold them neither: All Martyrs are Christ's, Martyrs of Jesus. A
description of Antichrist; the Romish Antichrist: There are two Antichrists,
Gog in the west, and Magog in the east: Nay beside Magog the Turk, Rome has
two at times: First, the Empire, then the Papacy; this woman in the latter
described here. Aristotle makes mention of one so inhumane, that she would rip
up women's wombs to eat the infants. Saint John's woman here has been as
savage; has not spared a babe, springing out of the womb of the mother at the
stake: Into the fire with it, it is a young Heretic.

In his 23. Sermon, page 463. this passage is deleated: Popes are free
peradventure, nay it is past peradventure: my Text says, every man, one Pope
was free, he was a woman: nay all are free, for Popes are Gods; it is their own
phrase, Our Lord God the Pope, or if not God, yet not mere man, something
between both, their saying too; but by good chance, it is not here every man,
but every one; who will scare that? yet as the Devil would not be belyed, so
neither would the Pope be wronged: Preaching against iniquity, let me do none.
It Is every one that calls on Christ's name: some Popes do not; Julius the
second called on the Devils name. In nomino omnium diabolorum, in all the
Devils names at his losing of Rave^na: But take the passive sense; all that are
called by Christ's name, Christians: Popes are all so; not all so neither; Paul
the III. was no Christian it seems, for he doubted of hell, of the resurrection
and of God; surely Gregory the IX. was none, he called Christ an Imposter. Yet
the Pope pretends Christ's name, titles himself by him, will be Christ's Vicar,
bear Christ's name above all men, affect Christ's titles above all men; his
attribute of Holiness. Men on earth, Saints in Heaven, are but called holy;
Peter is no more, his Predecessor sanctus Petrus, Christ's Mother is no more,
sancta Maria; holy Peter, holy Mary; God's self rests in it too, every person;
holy Father says Christ, John 17. The son sanctus Dei, God's holy one, Mark
1. the Spirit, the holy Ghost. The Pope likes not this positive degree, he will
be styled Sanctissimus, the most holy: it is not likely that iniquity is in this
man, this most holy man: Lutherans and Calvinists charge him with much, both
his person and his doctrine, but they are liars, heretics all; Sacrilege and
Symony, Incest and Adultery, setting of Subjects against Sovereigns, King
against King, Murder and Massacre, infinite iniquities: sic, that holy Father
Pope should do such things; they are not Calvin's calumnies, nor Luther's
lies, but confessed by their own Writers; nor do Popes thus in person only;
that craves some pardon: But it is their Doctrine too, their Churches Doctrine,
That a Priest of Jesuit may forswear, deny his parents, defraud his friend,
betray his country, kill his King; fie, that holy Mother Church should teach
such things. This theme (some may say) sits not this place neither; the Pope
is not here, etc.

In his Sermon upon Quadragessima, page 122. line 10. and page 124. line 37.
the Licenser has quite expunged these following lines. How then is the
Popedom in the Devils gift, if Kingdoms be not? Satan gives it, and it is a
kind of Kingdom, Regnum sacerdotale, a priestly Kingdom: The Pope a
Melchesedeck, King and Priest, wears a Crown, bears a sword, both
Regallities, three Crowns, multa diademata, Christ does, Revel. 19. and he is
his Vicar: two swords, Ecce duo gladij hic: Popes are Kings betters, Cardinals
Kings Peers; is the Pope the Devils creature and not Kings? But the Popedom is
not Satan's gift neither, Aeneas Sylvius himself sometimes a Pope, writes, that
one got the Popedom fraud diabolica; we believe it, more then one Silvester
the Nccromancer, Boniface 7. Gregory 7. all fraud diabolica: by devilish
machinations, that does not prove the Devil made them, or construe it if you
will, by the Devils means, it will not serve so neither, so Kings come often
to their Crowns by devilish means, and yet God gives them; God may be the
author of an act, whereof Satan may be in the means; God gave his Son to
death for us, yet the Devil had his hand in it; John says the Devil put in
Judas heart to betray Christ; God destroys Ahaz, but the Devil was his
means; a lying spirit in the mouth of all the Prophets: God would afflict Job,
the Devil was his instrument, it is plain in the story. For the point, as I
would not belie, so I would not rob the Devil of his right; the Popedom is of
God, but the Papacy is of Satan: To be a Prince and Bishop, yea I will yield
him highest Bishop too, God gives him that; but his universal Prelacy and
presumption over Princes, the Devil gives him that: his power is from God, but
his pride is from the Devil, Satan is yet more frank.

The Pope Patrissall plays satan; some here craves not prostraction only,
least happily you say, that is but civil reverence; and yet saving his
reverence, it is more then the greatest Monarch craves in all our Western
Kingdom; I say, he craves not prostraction only, but adoration too: Worship,
divine worship, what else meant the cry of the Cicilian Ambassadors prostrate
before him, Tu tollis peccati mundi, misereri nostri; O thou that take away
the sins of the world, have mercy upon us: etc.

Ibid. page 172. line 4. this is deleted by the Licenser; Was not Judas an
Apostle? Origin says he was, the Gospel says he was among the twelve
Apostles; not Disciples only, but Apostles. Saint Matthew reckons him; here is
then a place put for the Papists, which they never yet observed, for their
Apostolical Traditions; here is Traditio Apostolica indeed. Here I observe it
not, what do they else (...) is their (...), Treachery their occupation,
Treason the Pope's trade; best they leave it, it is Judas act, and brings a sort
of them to Judas end, it will strangle the Papacy it self at length.

In his second Sermon upon several occasions, page 293. l. 10. the Licenser
deletes: And there is a man in Rome, the Pope, will be as God the Son, for he
is his Vicar.

Ibid. page 495. l. 22. Gods Peer, that is little, will be his superior, will
be worshipped (Paul says) above all that is called God: Who is that? even the
Pope, etc. This Monster, etc. Let every soul be subject to the higher Powers,
Paul bids: be the Clergy exempt, they are not bound to the Lay bar; Thou
shall not make an Image, nor bow down to it, thou shall do both, Gods laws
are strait, the Pope will dispense with them, break thy Oath, marry thy wives
sister, thine own sister, thine Aunt, keep a Concubine, be a Catamite or
Sodomite, kill a King, though a catholic, the Pope will absolve thee. Hold we
the Pope arrogant in the title of Christ's Vicar; he is more, his power (it
seems) is above Christ's. Page 296. bids God a Bishop, be the husband unius of
one Wife; the Popes bids nullius, marry not at all; forbids the Cup at the
Communion of the Lord, though Christ have ordained it; Scripture, Gods Word
says Sylu Perer: has none authority, but from the Pope; I must end, the Pope
is Omnipotent, Gods Attribute, yet one calls this Pope so: He can do all
things, yea he is all things; Gods peculiar too, so he is Gods Peer, behold
the man is become like one of us. Idem: page 301. There Is a people in Affricke
curse the Sun because it fireth them, there is a Pope to curse the Stars,
Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Mercury, because he lost at dice, gamesters here curse
Cards and Dice, bite them, tear them, that's all, at most banne one another,
tame Protestants and base spirited, learn of holy Father Pope to curse the
Heavens and God; why wrong I our brave spirits as heretical as the Pope? was
not Christ God? his passions, wounds, nails, blood and death, yea heart and
soul, black mouthed blasphemy? what dares it not do against Heaven in
execrable Oaths? The Law, etc. page 338. The Popes Mint can coin words too,
to his Forge nothing comes amiss: in its Scriptures, Fathers, Counsels; yea,
if it needs be, he in a word writes too, In spite of all Gramarians, if the
Pope say but. Fiatur: page 344. Balaak of Spain, heirs Balaam of Rome to
curse Israel, his brothers of France, to root out all the Religion in his
Realm, or if Jerusalem will needs be there, it shall not have peace there: The
enemies, etc. page 346. Michael is Christ's, his Angels are true Christians,
Rome now is that Synagogue, pretends Saint Peter's chair, Caiaphas sits in it
and convents Christ, and there is the Dragons General, the Popes, his
captain, Kings of his communion, all enemies to peace, etc. In the 13. Sermon,
page 384. It Is now a proverb in the Popes court, it is not for Princes, but for
Merchants to keep oaths: of Popes and their partisons; it is true which Zosimus
falsely said of Constantine, that perjury was ordinary. Philip of Macedon,
Pausanias writes of him, that he brake all Leagues, all promises, all oaths;
we bear with him; 'twas the fashion of his Country: not Cretians only, as
Saint Paul says, from the Poet, but Grecians, all were liars; heathen
Grecians: The Pope, etc. page 387. That rough handed Esau, that thirsts for
Jacobs blood, that sends his associates to murder Kings, swears them to
murder them, assoiles men easily from all their oaths of Alleagiance
whatsoever, let him practice. In the 17. Sermon, page 420. John saw a woman
drunken with the blood of Saints; that is not the Pope, his sex saves him from
that charge, he is a man, if you doubt, one was a woman; Paul is for him, calls
him the man of sin. In the 20. Sermon, page 443. l. 3. The hope of the life
to come; they hold an old wives tale, hell a fable too: the worlds end, the
resurrection and Christ's coming unto judgment, Inter Naeniai habentur, they
reckon them mere fallacies, Petrarch says, one of their own church; That
blasphemous speeches came from a Popes mouth; Quantas nobis opes peperit illa
fabula de Christo; It was Leo X. he reckoned even the Gospel a legend of lies.

Sermon 27. page 449. I thought Papists held Letchery one of the seven deadly
sins, it seems a venial one, very venial by the Pope, who grants Priests
Concubines, licenseth the Stews, leases out Curtizans in Fee-farme: B. Jewel's
phrase. Joannes de Cosa Dean of the Catholic chamber, wrote a book in praise
of the lewdest kind of lust: they will shortly say, I think, as Hierom writes,
that Vigilautius said, that continency is heresy; then happily all the
letchers in the land will turn Catholics, a Religion fit for them; the Whore
of Babylon will favor Harlots, her sons (it seems) profess it all, for
they fleere a chaste and honest man, call him an Eunuch: But Satan, Popes and
Cardinals are liars: all Gods, etc.

Above twenty more passages of this nature, concerning the Pope, Papacy, Rome,
are obliterated in this Doctors Sermons, which for brevity we pretermit: only
we shall conclude with one more, containing the good old Doctors hopes to see
the Popes and Romes speedy downfall, which this Arch-prelat with his
confederates could no ways patiently endure to hear of; and that is in his
second Sermon on the fifth of November, page 234. l. 3. The whole world will
one day wonder, as he, at her drunkenness, so it at her fall. Falls are
incident to the drunken, and Saint John foretells that too, in two chapters;
doubles the word in both, Cecidit, cecidit, she is fallen, she is fallen, say
I one day. That day (I hope) is near, and the Popes period at hand: My self am
unlikely by my years, (but I hope) my successors shall preach this woman's
funeral, and that many here present, shall see this prophecy of Saint John
fulfilled: cecidit, cecidit. This drunken woman is nearly fallen, she reels
already, and that foreleads a fall, she has reeled a long time, sundry whole
Kingdoms, besides many parts of Germany and France, relinquisht her a long time
since; God will hasten the rest: Pray we all that, and bless we God for saving
us; pray he will so still, even for his Son our Saviors sake, unto both
which blessed persons, with the holy Ghost, be all glory, etc. Amen.

Now we appeal to any intelligent man's conscience, what the obliterating of
all these passages against the Pope, Popery, Rome, etc. out of these new books,
by the Archbishop and his Chaplains, portend and intimate, but a professed
confederacy in them to reduce us back to our ancient vassalage to the Pope and
Sea of Rome, and the re-establishing of the Popes authority, his Instruments,
Agents and Popery among us in the highest degree; which the ensuing particulars
will more fully demonstrate.

3. Passages purged out of new licensed Books, against seducing traitorous
Papists, Popish Priests, Jesuits, Monks, Arminians; our toleration of, and
remissness in executing Laws against them, and revolting to Popery.
DOctor Jones in his written Comentary on the Hebrews, had these casuing
passages against Papists, Jesuits and their errors, expunged: page 446. One
Papist if he be permitted, will quickly make many Papists: p. 148. If we happen
to be seduced by Papists or other Heretics: page 348. Though the Papists be
many and we but few, yet we may be of the Church: page 161. This was called
confirmation, whereas the Papists afterward abused it, and made a Sacrament of
it, exalting it above Baptism: page 90. God hardneth not only permissive, as
Bellarm, and the rest of the Papists contend: page 101. Not to seek salvation
by the observation of the Law, as the Papists do: page 241. We need not stand
a loofe, as the Papists would have us: page 137. The Papists this day cleave
hard to the Pope, nothing shall separate them from him: page 291. Both the
Jesuits and theirs, cannot avoid this place, etc. page 341. To deny Christ,
says Bellarmine, is an heresy, or an error next door to heresy; yet
Pererius the Jesuit denies that they be in that Paradise wherein Adam was;
therefore he is near to in Heretics, etc.

In Doctor Clerke's Sermons, page 52. l. 28. this clause was expunged: And as
himself the great Goliath of hell, this little Son of David has cast down
and beheaded: so his seed in this Land, blood-thirsty Catholics, incarnate
devils, the word incarnate, root them out of Israel; and the devils borne,
which is the Beast of Rome; the Horn of salvation knock it off in Zion; so
shall King Jacob be safe, and his Israel be glad.

Page 231. 233. Doctor Haywood expunged these memorable passages against
traitorous blood-thirsty Jesuits and Papists. Wherefore are the Jesuits in
France and here and every where, but to be his slaughter-men, to sheed Kings
blood? their feet are swift to spill it, because his throat lusts to swallow
it: Be wise now therefore O ye Kings, and be learned by France O ye Princes of
the earth; at least let the Lion learn by the Flower-de-luce to watch not the
Jesuit only, whose fingers itch to spill his blood, but the Recusant also, as
very a traitor in his heart as he: The Lord convert their persons and confound
their plots, as many as look at Jacob with an Esau eye.

We should wonder both at the man's self and at the man's men, not at the
Jesuits only, and the Seminary Priests, you shall not know them, to make them
the wonderment: But the Recusant Papist, yea every professed Papist, let us
wonder at them too: They wax in number and in spirit, and their mouths speak
presumptious things; Think you they censure that treason from their heart?
surely I will think that he that says as the Pope says, will also do as the
Pope does: Say he comes to Church, and hold the Kings supremacy; tamen Romanus
est, as Segismond the Emperor said of a Cardinal, yet he is a Papist; nullus
est fidus eorum affectus, quorum est diversa fides: therefore trust not that
man that holds any Popery; if he kiss like a Serpent, he sure will sting too:
his peace is with thee, but rebus sit stantibus, he is that woman's Son; he
thirsts for blood, even thy blood that embraces him; he says with Esau in his
heart, the days of mourning for Isaac will come one day; then I will kill my
Brother Ia^cob; but let us wonder.

Ibid. page 286. l. 10. these words are expunged: Instance but in the Pope; he
is but one Serpent, but a great one, Draco magnus, in the Apocalipse: He
curses Kings, and States by his B^le, that is his Hiss. murders and massacres
by his Jesuits, they are his sting: page 416. l. 25. I will not say the Jew,
but surely the Gentile before the Jesuit: page 420. l. 14. Rome is no Court of
Arches, to license the Jesuit to teach where he will: page 427. l. 6. No
Papist, no right Papist is a right Israelite, for there is guile in him: page
435. l. 5. The Epie^re Jesuits and Stoic Priests, call these Calvinists
bablers; others of them say, they set forth strange gods, for they preach to
the people Jesus and sola sides, a Male God and a Female: may we not know what
this doctrine, this new doctrine, whereof these Calvinists speak, is? we will
know what these things do mean: Unhappy Recusants.

Page 348. l. 6. To so many hearers, so intelligent, little need application,
yet the times crave it: Is not this Land a limb of this Jerusalem? of
Jerusalem it is but not of this, not of David's Jerusalem; you hear Jerusalem
taxt roughly by the Prophet, both for murder and adultery, for shedding Saints
blood, and serving strange gods; England is no persecutor, but it is an halter
between two Religions: Dagon affronts God's Ark; here is both Eucharist and
Mass, Babylon is in Jerusalem: It Is not unworthy the observing that Jerusalem
in the Original tongue is of the Duall number; there are two Ierusalems; David
bid^ pray for Ierusalems peace, but whether Jerusalem? that surely which he
here describes, where is Unity, v. 2. Religion, v. 4. and Justice, v. 5.
Jerusalem is a City that is at Unity within it self, thither go up the Tribes
to praise the Lord, and there are our seats of judgment. Is our Jerusalem
such? schism in the Church and faction in the State show there is no Unity:
Popery and Atheism spread over the whole Land; prove there is small Religion;
and impunity, less Justice; and may we pray for peace on this Jerusalem? we
may; but yet it must be by some other Text; pray we may for any; Moses did for
Israel though fallen greivously; Samuel for Saul though a grand sinner, we may
well curse, though happily in vain; for God says, non est pax, there is no
peace to the wicked; sin at length captived Israel, sacked the City, raced the
Temple; nunc seges est, grass grows at Jerusalem: Yet despair not daughter
Zion return our Sullamite, there is no peace to the wicked: cease we to do
evil, sorry we for sins, heartily weep we; pray we God for peace, we shall
have peace: the prodigious pride of women, their wanton vanities, censured
often by preachers, but in vain, they will come with them to Church in spite
of us, I think in spite of Angels too who are ever present in our Church, and
the drunkenness of men their whoredoms and blasphemies, draw down divine
revenge on our Jerusalem; France will be Gods ^od, and Spain will be his
hammer to scourge and beat Jerusalem to powder; mature repentance will prevent
all, and peace will be on Israel.

And page 445. 446. Jesuits must speak for Mammon, he is their god: There are
seekers of souls a phrase frequent in Scripture seekers of blood, Jesuits are
such; seek fools they should, Jesus self did it; he sought to save them,
Jesuits do but to destroy them: They Querere animas, but not in Christ's sense,
in Satane sense to devour them; they seek carefully, for they will (...), do as
the devil does, walk about the world to do that work: There are seekers of
lies, v. 42. The Church of Rome swarms with such seekers: That Is from below
too, another of Satan's seekers, whom Christ calls father of lies.

These passages are all deleted by the Lincenser as heterodox.

In Master Ward's Comentary upon Matthew, these clauses were purged out by the
Licenser, fol. 120. Thirdly, Fishes, i. e. men, not only rich men, but all
men, and therefore the Monks are but bad fishers, who fish only for great and
rich men, laboring only to draw them into their nets: Fol. 148. First, my
servants shall drink and ye shall be thirsty, and therefore it is a great
insolency in the Papists, thus diametrally to contradict the direct promises of
God. Secondly, Aliquando bonus dormit Hom^rus, wise men may play the fool
sometimes, and subtle Sophisters dispute absurdly, as our witty countryman
Stapleton does in this present Argument, disputing thus, etc. Secondly, if our
countryman Stapleton had not been a professor of Divinity, and a teacher of
others, he might have gone to the Logic professor to learn to frame a better
Argument, this thus framed by him being so absurd; Those that desire temporal
things are wicked, therefore those who want temporal things are not happy; he
had need look well to this Syllogism or Argument, least with its four feet it
run away from him. Fol. 154. Secondly, there is an anlawfull Hospitality,
which is showed to Traitors, Jesuits, popish Priests: Fourthly, they are faulty
here, who give unto the rich, as the Papists, who plentifully feast the fat
Monks, and send large presents to the Jesuits and Cap^chins. Secondly, there
are sowers of discord in Kingdoms, viz. those who instigate others unto
wars, as the Cardinals and Jesuits upon every occasion do whisper in the
ears of Princes, to make war upon their Neighbors, when they perceive any
advantage to be had thereby. Fol. 212. Secondly, add nothing to the Word of
God: Neither first, the chafe of superstition with the Papists: Nor secondly,
Machavillinisme and unwarrantable policy, with some Statists: Neither thirdly,
New opinions, etc. Fol. 213. Secondly, that is no true sense of Scripture which
does make any sentence in Scripture false, as the Papists make the Word of God
quarrel with, and thwart, and cross it self; Example: they would prove Romans
3. 28. and 4. 25. to be false by Iam. 2. 21. Now we know these expositions to
be false, because the establishing of the one place, is the demolishing of the
other. Fol. 276. Thirdly the Papists have Rimes which must be said over three
or four times every day; certainly with a little pains a man might make a good
Parret a good Papist, for he might be taught to speak all this. Fol. 476. Q.
Wherein are the Papists to blame concerning the Augmentation of Faith? Answ.
They are faulty in two things; Negant fiduciam and certitudinem fidet, they
grant faith, but deny both confidence and certainty of faith, etc. fol. 52.
Answ. But the Monkish life is not persecution except thus because the Locusts
(which are no other but Monks and Friars) Revel. 19. do bite and sting like
Serpents, that is do secretly wound men's consciencex (and four lines after)
Thirdly, all go not to Christ that come into Monasteries but rather go from
him, they living after another rule then Christ's; for Francis their great
founder, erected a new sect of Monkery, and found out a new rule for them,
which he called regulam Evangelicam, the rule of the Gospel, as though Christ's
rule were not sufficient. Many other passages of like nature, over-numerous to
recite, were blotted out of this Author by the Licenser.

We shall conclude with such passages as Doctor Bray, with the Archbishop's
privity, purged out of Doctor Featlyes Sermons, wherein some Texts of Scripture
were expunged to do Popish Priests and seducers a favor: p. 90. What are the
great Foxes but the Priests and Jesuits? what are the little Foxes but the
Demipelagian cubs, which will spoil our fairest clusters, the Colleges of
both Universities, if in time they be not looked unto, as they have done
already in our neighbor Vine in the Low-countryes, etc. page 472. If these
cries of the souls under the Alter awake not the zealous Magistrates whom God
has made protectors of his Spouses, to draw out the sword of wholesome Statutes
out of the scabbard to wound the hairy scalpe of the Strumpet; yet let them at
least take compassion on the souls of the living, even their sons and
daughters, who are daily enticed by secular Priests and Jesuits and by their
Agents conveyed over beyond the Seas, to be sacrificed to the Molech at Rome;
Cypr. de lapsis, quid hoc loco faciam dilectissimi fratres? sluctuam vario
mentis estu, quid aut quo modo dicam? lachrymis magis quam verhis opus est, ad
exprimendum dolorem, quo corporis nostri, plagu deflenda est.
What, or how shall I speak unto you, beloved brethren? I need rather tears
then words to bewail the great loss our Church sustaineth of hundred, nay
thousand of souls, that have been drawn out of the right way, and are fallen
into the snares of Satan, and den of the Beast etc. Here though I lose my voice
by it. I cannot but cry aloud with zealous Bull, in Apoc. Quae quae. so clmentia
est crudelissimis ^upis blandiri ut oves innocents, Christi sanguine redemptas
impune dilanient? quae haec patientiae sinere viniam Domini ab immaenissimis
monstris deviastari.
Bullenger, What clemency call you this, to suffer the Lords Vineyard to be
spoiled and laid waste by ugly monsters? what mercy to spare the Wolves, which
spare not Christ's sheep redeemed with his procious blood?

Juven. sat. 2.
Ubinune lex Iulia dormis?

To what purpose serves our wholesome Laws and Statutes, if they rust, as the
Cic. orat. 1. in Catil. Habeamus senatus consultum velut gladiam in vegin^
^^condisum.
Orator speaks, like swords in the scabbards, and are never drawn upon the
sworn enemies of our Church and state? etc. page 485. That the severity of our
Laws and Canons should fall upon straying Doves silly seduced persons, without
any gall at all, whilst the Black-birds of Antichrist are let alone: if chaste
Lydia be silenced for her undiscreet zeal, let not Jezabel be suffered to
teach and to deceive Gods servants, etc. page 495. I know to restrain such
abuses is the peculiar duty of the Ecclesiastical and civil Magistrates, but
to detect and discover them to authority, and to refrain from society or
Idolaters, is the duty of us all; and I beseech you for the love of him who
has espoused your souls to himself and decked them with the richest Jewels
of his grace, and made them a Jointure of his Kingdom, beware of Jezabels
Panders, who go about to entice you to spiritual fornication; If they be your
Deuteronomy. 13. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
brethren, the sons of your mother, or your own sons or daughters, or the
wife that lies in your bosom, or your friends that are as your own souls,
that solicit you in this kind, ye are to renounce them, and by the law of God,
to see justice executed upon them etc. p. 796. Beware therefore dear brethren,
beware of the Panders of Antichrist, who go about to entice you not to
corporal, but which is far worse, to spitituall whoredom; If they be Deuteronomy.
13. 6, 7, 3, 9, 10.
your brethren, the sons of your own mother, or your own sons or
daughters, or your wives that lie in your bosom, or your friends that are as
your own soul, that entice you to go to Mass, and partake with the
Romanists in their manifold idolatries, you are bound by the Law of God to be
so far from consenting to them, or hearing them, that you are to account NOTE.
of them as your capital enemies, and proceed against them as you would
against those who have plotted your utter ruin and overthrow.

Good God! that such patheticall clauses as these against seducing popish
Priests and Jesuits, nay the very words of sacred Scripture it self, should be
thus obliterated in our Protestant Church by the Archbishop's own direction,
who professes himself such an enemy to Priests and Jesuits! Doubtless his
vapouring protestations against them were all mere delusory complements to
beguile the over-credulous, since all these purgations proclaim both him and
his agents to be their most endeared friends (as they openly vaunted them to be
at Rome) and to hold most strict intelligence with them.

From these purgations against Popery, Popes, Papists, Priests, Jesuits, Monks,
and other Romish vermin in the general, we shall next proceed to sundry
expunctions against doctrinall points of Popery in particular, which we shall
prosecute in an Alphabeticall manner; the first whereof is this.

4. That the Absolution of Priests is but declarative; and that they cannot
bind and loose men at their pleasures against Gods Word, as the Papists hold
their Priests can do.
IN Doctor Clerks Sermons, Sermon 3. of the Nativity, page 23. the Licenser
has expunged these words: Nay, nor bind nor loose sin neither, but
declarative: the Priest does, but pronounce the absolution, etc. So that in
this purgation Christ is but the Physic, the Priest is the Physician or
Apothecary at least; but he wants Heleborus to purge his brain.

In Master Richard Ward his Comentary upon Matthew, the Licenser has quite
obliterated this passage as erroneous, Matthew. 18. 18. Whatsoever ye bind, etc.
the Papists hold this gross opinion, that men are bound and loosed in Heaven,
according to the will and pleasure of every Priest, exercising the Keys upon
earth; and this Tenet they ground upon the generality of these words;
Whatsoever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whatsoever you bind on earth
should be bound in heaven, in this verse, and in John 20. 23. Remist. Annot.
John 20. 23.

These places are not so to be understood, as though God were bound to ratify
every decree of men upon earth. For,

First, this power is given to all lawful Pastors, who maintain and hold the
Apostolic faith, and not to idolatrous, ignorant and blasphemous Priests, such
as most, if not all the popish Priests are.

Secondly, they must decree in the earth, according to Gods will, and therefore
John 20. 22. out Savior dotb first breath his Spirit upon his Apostles, and
then gives them their Commission; signifying thereby, that they must execute
this power, as they shall be directed by Gods Spirit; yea, hence Matthew. 18. 20.
it follows, that they must be assembled in the name of Christ, that is,
according to Christ's rule, and the direction of his Word; they must bind and
loose, and not at their own discretion.

There are diverse other purgations of this nature, which brevity enforces as
to omit.

5. Clauses against adoring the Eucharist, and consecrated Bread in the
Sacrament, expunged.
MAster Ward in his Comentary on Matthew, had this memorable clause against
Papists adoring the Eucharist, purged out by the Licenser. Object. The
Eucharist is to be adored because Christ is very God. Answ. He should have
assumed; the Eucharist is very God, which is blasphemy to say; and therefore
not to be uttered by any but by Babylons brood, unto whose Prince and head is
given the name of Blasphemy, Revel. 13. 1. yea, a mouth speaks blasphemies,
verse 5. even against the most high God, verse 6. and therefore we leave this
opinion to the Papists, to whom properly it belongs.

The Licenser it seems would have Protestants embrace this opinion as well as
Papists, and therefore purged out this clause as heterodox.

Doctor Jones in his Comentary on the Hebrews, had the like purgation; page
20. Then how sharply are the Papists to be reproved, that worship a piece of
bread in the Sacrament: Strange that such a passage should be deleted, but that
our bowing to, and toward the Altar, Archbishops Speech in Star Chamber, p, 47.
because there it is, hoc est corpus meum, tended to introduce the self same
adoration of the Eucharisticall Bread among us by degrees.

6. Passages expunged, averring, That the Pope is Antichrist: of which see
Section 2. before.
YOU have already heard of sundry purgations of this nature in the premises, we
shall present you with others not formerly remembered.

Doctor Clerk in his sixth Sermon of the Nativity, page 53. line ult. had this
clause: But the Pops is the Antichrist; which the Licenser thus transformes:
but one is Anchrinst; easing the Pope of this title.

Master Ward in his Comentary upon Matthew, page 303. had this whole discourse
concerning Antichrist expunged by the Licenser.

How many ways is this name Antichrist taken in the Scriptures, that our
Savior says, many shall come in his name, affirming that they are Christ's?
Quest.


First, it is taken sometimes commonly; and thus his name Antichrist belongs
to all who are enemies to Christ: and these are either 1. open and professed
enemies, as the Jews, Answ.
Turks and Infidels, in which sense the word is not used in Scripture; or 2.
covert and close enemies, who profess themselves christians, and under the
name and profession of Christ, oppugn Christ and his truth; and thus it is
taken either 1. more largely, to signify the whole body of heretics, as 1
John 2. 18. 22. or 2. more strictly, and so it signifies the society of them,
who having made an Apostasy from Christ, have received the mark of the Beast;
and these we hold to be the Apostaticall Church of Rome. Secondly, this name
Antichrist is sometimes taken properly, or rather peculiarly, and so it
belongs to the man of sin, and the son of perdirion (a These. 2. 3.) who
after a more general manner is the head of all heretics, and more specially
of that society, which has the mark, number, and the name of the Beast, Revel.
13. 17. and this we hold to be the Pope of Rome (as is abundantly proved by
Davaeus, Bishop Downame and Master Squire) and that not only because he is the
head of the Antichristian body but also because he being in profession the
Vicar of Christ, is indeed Aemulus Christi, i. e. an enemy opposed to Christ
in emulation of like honor, as if we should say, a counter-Christ, as the word
Antichrist does also signify.

How does it appear that there are many Antichrists? for although Christ says
here Quest.
that many shall come in his name, yet many deny this, affirming, that the
Antichrist shall be but one particular person, and consequently, that there
shall not be many Antichrists, but one only.

That Antichrist is not one singular man, but a whole state and succession of
men, and consequently, that there shall be many Antichrists pecularly, or
(...), so called, Answ*
will appear by these Arguments: First, if Antichrist were in the Apostles
time and was to remain until the second coming of Christ, then Antichrist is
not one singular man, but a succession of men; but Antichrist was in the
Apostles time, and is to continue until the second coming of Christ, as both
Saint Paul (2 These. 2.) and John 1 cap. 2. 18. and 4. 3. and 2 John 7.)
testify. Therefore Antichrist is not one singular man, but a succession of
men. Secondly, that in the 7. and 11. of Daniel, and in 13. and 17. of the
Revelations, is described under the name and figure of a Beast, is not one
singular thing or person, but a whole state or succession: But Antichrist in
these places is described under the name and figure of a Beast: Therefore
Antichrist is not one singular person, but a whole state or succession.
Thirdly, the seven heads of that Beast, which signifies the Roman state, are
not so many persons but so many heads or states of Government, whereby the
Commonwealth of the Romans has been at diverse times governed; the sixth head
was the state of Emperors, the seventh Antichrist, as the Papists confess,
the eighth (which is also one of the seventh) the state of Emperors revived:
whereby it evidently appears, not only that Antichrist is not one man but
also that the Pope (who is the seventh head) is Antichrist; if the Reader would
see the two former Arguments enlarged, and another added, not here mentioned,
then let him read Bishop Downame de Antichristo, lib. 2. cap. 20. to 32. Page
16. this clause is deleted: Ob. Antichrists name shall not be known until he
come, etc. Answ. 2. Secondly, Antichrist is already come, yea, the Pope of Rome
is this Antichrist, as is abundantly proved by many of our Divines; and
therefore his rise, seat and name are known well enough: page 14. Ob. 5.
Whosoever shall put away his wife (the Pope is called the adversary, or he who
opposes himself against Christ, 2 These. 2. 11. and is justly so called,
because he and his Divines do maintain assertions directly contrary to the
word of Christ; one example we have in this verse, Bellarmine says, etc. page
57. Ob. 3. Christ says, unto me is given all power, therefore (Antichrists
imp) Pererius says, the Pope has power over Infidels; And a little after
Answ. 2. all power is given to Christ, therefore to the Pope, is a blasphemous
and Antichristian consequence, displaying the Pope to his colors, to be the
Where in making himself, or suffering himself to be made equal with Christ,
is obliterated.

Would not any Protestant admire such passages as these should be expurged, to
gratify the Pope.

The Articles of Religion agreed upon by the Archbishops and Bishops, and the
rest of the Clergy of Ireland, in Convocation holden at Dublin, in the year of
our Lord 1615. for the avoiding of diversities of opinions, and the
establishing of consent touching true Religion: reprinted at London, 1629.
Artic. 78. 80. determined thus against the Pope.
THE power which the Bishop of Rome now challenges, to be the supreme head of
the Universal Church of Christ, and to be above all Emperors, Kings and
Princes, is an usurped power, contrary to the Scriptures and Word of God, and
contrary to the example of the Primitive Church; and therefore is for just
causes taken away and abolished within the Kings Majesty's Realms and
Dominions.

The Bishop of Rome is so far from being the Supreme Head of the Universal
Church of Christ, that his works and doctrine do plainly discover him to be
that Man of sin, foretold in the holy Scriptures, whom the Lord skall consume
with the spirit of his mouth, and abolish with the brightness of his coming.

These Articles were so displeasing to the Archbishop (together with some
others against Arminians) that in the year 1634. this whole book of Articles
was revoked; suppressed by Parliament in Ireland, through his procurement; then
which strange act, there could not be a more apparent undermining of the
Protestant Religion.

In the year 1634. there were, at the special request of the Queen of Bohemia,
Letters Patents granted to Master Rulie, a Palatinate Minister, for a
collection throughout (...) of the poor Ministers of the Palatinate; in which
Patent there was this notable ^ clause inserted relating to their Religion and
sufferings.

Whose cases are the more to be deplored, for that this extremity is fallen
(...) them for their (...) constancy to the true Religion, which we, together
with them, do profess, and (...) we are all bound in conscience to maintain
to the utmost of our powers; whereas these relations and godly persons being
involved, amongst many others their cou^trymen, in (...) common calamity might
have enjoyed their estates and fortunes if with other back-sliders in the times
of trial, they would have submitted themselves to the ANTICHRISTIAN YOKE, and
have renounced or dissembled the profession of the true Religion.

The very same formal words were used in former Patents of collections for
them in King James his Reign, and in the Patent dated the 29. of Jan. in the
third year of King Charles his Reign by which this Patent was drawn: The
Archbishop perusing this Patent brought to him by Master Rulie, after it had
passed the Seal, grew extremely choleric at it, rated Master Ruly, (who
pleaded ignorance of the customs of England, and that the Patent was drawn by
the Kings Attorney, according to former presidents, without any directions from
himself, who was a mere stranger) chid him very sharply, threatened to
suppress the whole collection, detained the Patent under seal, and carrying
it the next day to the Court, complained of it to the King, checked the Lord
Keeper and Secretary Cook, for letting such a clause pass in the Patent, who
justified themselves by former presidents, by which they were guided; and by
his violence, wholly cancelled the Patent after it was sealed; then caused a
new Patent to be drawn, wherein this former clause was omitted, the King
telling the Lord Keeper that the Archbishop would have it altered, and
therefore it must be done; which thereupon was done occordingly. Now the cause
of all this stir and anger of his Grace-ship against this clause, was only
because it styled those of the Palatinate, professors of the true Religion,
etc. and tacitly censured the Pope as Antichrist in this latter clause; Where
as these religious and godly persons might have enjoyed their estates and
fortunes, if with other back-sliders in the times of trial, they would have
submitted themselves to the Antichristian Yoke, and renounced or dissembled the
profession of the true Religion: As was punctually attested upon oath by Master
Wakerly and Master Hartlib. Of which more fully hereafter.

Now that all the forementioned purgations of passages against the Pope, and
his being Antichrist, proceeded originally from the Archbi. himself, without
any other motive but his own inherent affection to his Holiness and the Roman
party, we shall most apparently evidence to all the world, by a Letter of his
to Dr. Hall the Bishop of Exeter, signed with his own hand, and Bishop Hal's
answer thereunto; the Originals of which Letters, Master Prynne seized in his
Study at Lambeth, and attested at the Lords Bar, where they were both
acknowledged and read in these ensuing terms.

My very good Lord:
I Have received your Lordships Letters of December. 6. 23. and with them the
copy of your Book, and in them a paper of short propositions, which you think
(and so do I) is fitter for the attestation of diverse hands then the book it
self: These propsitions shall be well weighed against the time of Convocation,
which I conceive will be a fit time to take other Bishops attestation, without
further noise or trouble.

For your book, I first thank you very heartily for your pains; and next,
more then heartily (were it possible) for your noble and free submission of it,
not only to many eyes and judgments, but also in the maine to be ordered, and
after that pressed or suppressed as it shall be thought fit here. Which care or
conscience would men use which set out books, we should not have so much froth
and vanity in the world, as now it is full of.

But whereas you writ: First, that the Book grew into greater length under
your pen them you expected; I cannot be sorry for that, since that which you
have added concerning Parker, Anti-Tilenus and Vedelius, seems to me very
necessary: Secondly, that you are pleased to subject the work to me, and to
interpret it, that you meant not personally to me, because I could not have
time for other great occasions to revise it, but by way of desputation: These
are to let you know, that were my occasions NOTE.
greater then they are, I would not suffer a book of that Argument, and in
these times, to pass without my own particular View: And therefore, my Lord,
these may tell you, that both my Chaplains have read over your book and that
since them, I have read it over my self very carefully, every line of it; and
I have now put it into the hands of my Lord the Bishop of Ely: and this thrice
reading over has been the cause why I did not give you a more speedy account
of it.

And now, my Lord, according to the freedom which you have given one, I must
tell you, that I have here and there in my reading of it over, made bold to
alter or leave out a phrase or two, but have as yet varied nothing that is
material; and indeed I should think it very uncivil and unjust too, to vary
any thing that is substantial, without first acquainting you with it, that so
it may be done either by your own pen, or at the least, not without your own
consent.

The particulars which I chiefly insist upon are these: First, you do
extremely well to distinguish the Scottish business from the state of the
foreign Churches; but yet to those Churches and their Authors you are a
little more favorable then our case will now bear: But this I conceive will
be easily helped, and that without pressing too NOTE.
much upon them. The second is, the first touch which you have concerning the
Sabatarians, where you let their strict superstition pass without any touch at
all, I think one little one will do no harm. The third, which you seem to
pass by, as not much material in the Question, is in our judgment here, the
very Maine of the cause, and it is, whether Episcopacy be an Order or Degree?
an Order certainly, if it be of Divine and Apostolical institution. For that
which is but different by degree and circumstantially, cannot be other then
Iuris positivi; and the ancient word in the Fathers is, Ordinatio Episcopi; and
our ordinary phrase is of any of our Brethren the Bishops, he is one of our
Order: and why does the Church of England ordain or consecrate every one that
is made a Bishop, if it be but a Degree of the same Order? For when a Bishop is
translated or made an Archbishop, theras then no consecration, because they
are Iuris positivi, and only degrees: Your Lordship is very near a whole
leaf upon this transition; I beseech you weigh it well, and then let me have
it altered by your own pen, and the sooner sent the better.

The last (with which I durst not but acquaint the King) is about Antichrist;
which title in three or four places of your book, you bestow upon the Pope
positively and determinately, NOTE.
whereas King James of blessed memory, having brought strong proof, in a Work
of his, as you well know, to prove the Pope to be Antichrist; yet being
ofterwards challenged about it, he made this answer; when the King that now is
went into Spain, and acquainted him with it, that he writ that not
concludingly, but by way of Argument only, that the Pope and his Adherent
might see, there were as good and better Arguments to prove him Antichrist,
then for the Pope to challenge temporal jurisdiction over Kings: This whole
passage being known to me, I could not but speak with the King about it, who
commanded me to write unto you, that you might quallifie your expression in
these particulars, and so not differ from the known judgment of his pious and
learned Father: This is easily done by your own pen; and the rather because
all Protestants join not in this opinion of Antichrist. I have no more to
trouble your Lordship with, but to pray you to have your answer to these with
as much speed as much speed as may be; so to Gods blessed protection I leave
you, and rest

Your Lordships very loving friend and brother, W. CANT.
Lambeth Jan. 14. 1639. I had not leizure to took a copy of these Letters,
therefore I pray let me have them back again when you give me your answer.




This Letter was thus indorsed, To the right reverend Father in God, my very
good Lord and Brother, the Lord Bishop of Exeter, these. And after the receipt
again, thus indorsed by the Archbishop himself; My Letters of Jan. 14. 1639.
to L. B. Exon. about his book for Episcopacy.

To which Letter Bishop Hall returned this Answer, found together with it in
the Archbishops study.

MOst Reverend, and my ever most Honorable Lord, I do first humbly thank
your Grace for those hours and pains you have been pleased to bestow, both
upon my papers and me, and yet more for that noble freedom your Grace has
been pleased according to my earnest request, to use, in making known your
Graces Judgment, in those few Animadversions which I have now received, and
the gracious respect showed to me, that after so full power, put into your
Graces hands to dispose of those papers, at your own pleasure; yet your Grace
has been pleased to take my unworthiness along with you, in the altering of
my passages therein, wherein I hope I have satisfied your Graces expectation
accordingly. As for my favourablenesse to foraigne Authors and Churches, I
foretold your Grace, that I held it best not to be sparing of good words,
though in the reality of the Tenet, I have gone further then the most others.
Those Authors whom I mention, with so fair respect, are in those things (for
which I cite them) our friends; but if your Grace find any phrase too high or
unseasonable, it is but a dash of your Chaplains pen, to whom I beseech your
Grace to give an absolute freedom in this behalf. For that of the
Sabatarians, I have put a drop or two of vinegar more into my ink in two
several places. For that passage concerning Antichrist, I have turned it upon
themselves, without a declaration NOTE.
of my own judgment; however I find our learned pattern, Bishop Andrews,
more then once punctual this way. For that point of the Degree or Order of
Episcopacy, although I well knew the weight of it, yet I did purposely intend
to wave it here, because both it fetches a great and learned part of the
School upon us, and because I found it to be out of my way, since these
factions with whom we deal, deny both a several Order, and a several Degree,
allowing only a priority of Order in the same degree; but our Tenet is
doubtless most defensible: and I have accordingly so stated it in this review,
which together with all my best services, I do humbly recommend to your Graces
acceptance, vowing my hearty prayers for your Graces happy proceedings, as
duly merited from

Your Graces most humble, and faithfully devoted in all observance JOS. EXON.
Exom. Pal. Jan. 18. I have sent back your Graces Letter according to your
Graces pleasure, and withal have been bold upon the humble suit of one of my
worthy Clergy, Master Bury, to recommend a pious Petition of his to your Grace,
the least touch of answer in your Graces Letter, will abundantly satisfy him.

Two R^negadoes have in two several parts of my Diocese been received into
the Church, under that solemn form of Penance which your Grace was pleased to
appoint.




This Letter was thus superscribed; To the most Reverend and most Honorable,
my singular good Lord, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, Primate of
all England, and Metropolitan, Chancelour of Oxford, and one of the Lords of
his Mijesties most honorable Privy Counsel, present these.

And after the receipt thereof, thus indorsed with the Archbishops own hand:
Rec. Jan. 22. 1639. L. B. Exon. concerning some amendments in his book for
Episcopacy.

In this Letter of the Archbishops, and the answer to it, besides the grand
design of asserting Episcopacy of divine Right and Institution, we may observe
these considerable particulars.

First, that he blames Bishop Hall for being a little too favorable to the
foreign Protestant Churches, and their authors. Secondly, for passing by the
Sabatarians (or strict observers of the Lords day) without any touch at all,
which he desires him to rectify and help, by some touches of shapnesse against
them: this is his charity to the Protestants and Sabatarians (or Puritans of
you please) they were too heartily handled, and therefore must be more harshly
dealt withal: but now on the other hand, mark his extraordinary affection to,
and care of the Popes honor and reputation. He does in the third place, tax
the Bishop for bestowing the title of ANTICHRIST on him three or four times in
his Book positively and determinately. This was such a transcendent crime, that
he must needs acquaint the King himself with it of his own native
disposition, without any other Monitor, and procures a special royal command
to him from his Majesty, to expunge those scandalous and dishonorable clauses
against his Holiness out of his Treatise. Fourthly, in the reason which he
renders for acquainting his Majesty herewith, and desiring him to make this
change, there are these considerable things to be taken notice of: First, that
King James himself did in his printed His Apology for the Oath of Alleagiance,
and Answer to Cardinal Perron.
Works, at large prove and declare the Pope to be Antichrist, by very strong
proofs. Secondly, that when the Spanish match was in agitation, and the Popes
Dispensation required for the facilitating of it (being one of the first
Articles in the Marriage Treaty) he was challenged by the Pope and his agents
for it, but not before. Thirdly, that King James hereupon to satisfy the Pope,
and gain his favor was put to a hard shift, and enforced to coin a new
distinction which he never thought of till then, to excuse the matter: That he
writ thou, not concludingly, but by way of Argument only; etc. Fourthly, that
he made this answer and distinction when King Charles went into Spain, and
acquainted him with it by word of mouth, that he thereby might satisfy the
Pope and his party. Fifthly, that this whole passage was known to him, and he
privy to this secret, not known formerly to others; therefore he was certainly
one of the Cabinet-counsell, who was privy to the Kings going into Spain, and
to the private instructions given him by King James before his departure hence;
yea, very likely one who suggested this distinction to King James, to please
the Pope and promote the Match; and therefore HE COULD NOT BUT SPEAK WITH THE
KING ABOUT IT: who hereupon commanded this Bishop, to qualify his expressions
in these particulars, and so not differ from the known judgment of his pious
and learned Father, from whose orthodox judgment notwithstanding the Arminians
might freely dissent both with his Majesty's and this Arch-prelats approbation:
Whereupon we find that these passages were qualified according to his desire,
although Bishop Andrews positive opinon in sundry passages was, that the Pope
was Antichrist.

All which considered, we may infallibly conclude from his own pen, that all
the forementioned purgations of passages against the Papacy, Pope, and his
being Antichrist, were made by this Archbishops own special direction,
without any other suggestion but his own Romish Genius and good affection to
the Pope, to induce a more easy reconciliation with him: and this in direct
opposition.

First, to the several Statutes of 16 R. 2. c. 5. 25 H. 8. c. 19. 20. 21. 28
H. 8. c. 10. 37 H. 8. c. 17. which tacitly define the Pope to be the
Antichrist, who did obfuscate and wrest Gods word and Testament a long season,
from the spiritual and true meaning thereof, to his worldly and carnal
affections, as pomp, glory avarice, ambition and tyranny; covering and
shadowing the same with his humane and politic devices, traditions and
inventions, set forth to promote and stablish his only dominion, both upon the
souls and also the bodies and goods of all Christian people, excluding Christ
out of his Kingdom and rule of man's soul as much as he may, and all other
temporal Kings and Princes out of their Dominions, which they ought to have by
Gods law, upon the bodies and goods of their subjects; whereby he did not only
rob the Kings Majesty, being only the supreme head of this his Realm of
England, immediately under God, of his honor, right and pre-eminence due unto
him by the law of God, but spoiled this his Realm yearly of innumerable
treasure, and with the loss of the same, deeemed the Kings loving and obedient
Subjects, persuading to them by his laws, bulls, and other his deceivable
means, such dreams, vanities and fantisies, as by the same, many of them were
seduced and conveyed unto superstitious and erroneous openions.

Secondly, to the book of Homilies, in the second part of the Sermon for
Whit-Sunday, page 316. and the 6. Sermon against wilful Rebellion, page 316.
which determines the Pope to be Antichrist in these terms: Wheresoever you
find the spirit of envy, hatred, contention, robbery, murder, extortion,
witchcraft, neeromancy, etc. assure your selves that there is the spirit of the
devil and not of God; albeit they pretend outwardly to the world never so much
holiness, etc. such were all the Popes and Prelates of Rome for the most part,
as does well appear by the story of their lives; and therefore they are
worthily accounted among the number of the false Prophets, and false Christ's,
which deluded the world a long while: The Lord of heaven and earch defend us
from their tyranny and pride, that they never enter into his Vineyard again,
etc. and he of his great mercy so work in all men's hearts by the mighty power
of the holy Ghost, that the comfortable Gospel of his Son Christ may be truly
preached, truly received, and truly followed in all places, to the beating
down of sin, death, the Pope, the devil, and ALL THE KINGDOM OF ANTICHRIST,
etc. The Bishop of Rome understanding the bruit blindness, ignorance of Gods
Word, and superstition of English men, and how much they were inclined to
worship the BABYLONISH BEAST OF ROME.

Thirdly, to the 80. Article of the Church of Ireland, defining the Bishop of
Rome, to be THE MAN OF SIN, foretold in the holy Scripture.

Fourthly, to the Book of Common Prayer, appointed for the fifth of November.
stiling the Pope, Papists and Jesuits, A Babylonish and Antichristian sect; and
to the Kings Letters Patents, forementioned; defining Popery to be an
Antichristian Yoke.

Fifthly, to the Hymn, printed in the end of all our Psalms and Common Prayer
books. From Turk and Pope defend us Lord, which both would thrust out of his
throne our Lord Jesus Christ thy dear Son: and the prayer for private
families, bound up with our Bibles and Common-prayer-books; confound Satan and
Antichrist, etc.

Sixthly, to the whole torrent of our Protestant Martyrs, Writers, who define
the Pope to be Antichrist, yea the great Antichrist, prophesied of in
Scripture. This was the direct position of our godly, learned Martyr Walter
Brute, who maintained it in a large discourse, recorded by Master Fox, in his
Acts and Monuments, edit. 1641. vol. I. p. 622. to 632. of our English Apostle
John Wickliffe, Fox ibid. p. 594. (justified by John Hus) and Joan Wicklif.

Master Brightman upon the Revelation; Doctor Crakenthorpe, his defense of
Constantine, and of the Popes temporal Monarchy; and generally all other our
eminentest English Writers of any note, till this Archbishops reign, have
positively defined the Pope and Papacy to be the great Antichrist, and proved
the same at large: We shall close up this with two of the Archbishops
predecessors resolutions in this point. The first is Archbishop Cranmer, who
as he refused to move or stir his cap to the Popes Commissioners, when he was
converted before them for his Religion, so he likewise professedly averred the
Pope to be the Artichrist in these very terms, recorded by Master Fox in his
Acts and Monuments, Vol. 3. Edit. 1641. p. 653. 660. 661. The Bishop of Rome,
unless he be Antichrist, I cannot tell what to make of him; wherefore if I
should obey him, I cannot obey Christ: he is like the Devil in his doings, for
the Devil said to Christ, If thou will fall down and worship me, I will give
thee all the Kingdoms of the world: thus he took upon him to give that which
was not his own, even so the Bishop of Rome gives Princes their Crowns,
being none of his own; for where Princes either by election, either by
succession, either by inheritance, obtain their Crown, he says that they
should have it from him: Christ says, that Antichrist shall be, and who shall
he be? forsooth he that advances himself above all other creatures: Now if
there be none already that has advanced himself after such sort besides the
Pope; then in the mean time let him be Antichrist, etc. After which, he desired
all them present to bear him witness, that he took the traditions and
Religion of that usurping Prelat to be most erroneous, false, and against the
doctrine of the whole Scripture, which he had often times well proved by writing
and the author of the same to be very Antichrist, so often preached of by the
Apostles and Prophets, in whom did most evidently concur al signs and tokens,
whereby he was painted out to the world to be known; for it was most evident,
that he had advanced himself above all Emperors and Kings of the world, whom
he affirmed to hold their estates and Empires of him, as of their chief, etc.
He has brought in gods of his own framing, and invented a new Religion full
of gain and lucre quite contrary to the holy Scriptures, only for the
maintaining of his Kingdom, displacing Christ from his glory, and holding his
people in a miserable servitude of blindness, to the loss of a great number
of souls, which God at the latter day shall exact at his hand, boasting many
times in his canons and decrees, that he can dispense, contra Petrum, contra
Paulum, contra vetus and novum testamentum, and that he, plenitudine
potestatis, tantum prtesi, quantum Deus; that is against Peter, against Paul,
against the old and new Testament, and of the fullness of power, may do as
much as God. O Lord, who ever heard such blasphemy! if there be any man that
can advance himself above him, let him be judged Antichrist: This enemy of God
and our Redemption is so evidently painted out of the Scriptures by such
manifest signs and tokens, which all so clearly appear in him, that except a
man will shut up his eyes and heart against the light, he cannot but know him;
and therefore for my part I will never give my consent to the receiving of him
into this Church of England: thus Cranmer resigned at his death. This
Arch-prelat therefore has shut his eyes and heart against this shining truth,
in his godly Predecessors judgment, who not only doubts, but denies the Pope
to be the Antichrist.

The second is Archbishop Whitguift, who when he commenced Doctor, and
answered the Divinity act at Cambridge anno 1569. publicly maintained this
assertion in the Schools, Papa est ille Ancichristus, as Sir George Paul
records in his life, p. 5. which this Archbishops immediate Predecessor. Abbot
(to omit Archbishop Parker and Gryndall) likewise positively asserted; and
Doctor Usher Archbishop of Armagh in a Letter of his to this Arch-prelat
expressly he writes, that he did undoubtedly believe the Pope to be Antichrist;
which title Bishop Andrews and Bishop Hall. Bishop Morton and Bishop Downame,
do likewise positively bestow upon the Pope, in some of their authorized
impressions.

Therefore it cannot be but a grand offense for this Arch-prelat and his
agents, contrary to the stream of all our Martyrs, Writers, Prelates, to purge
all passages out of these new-printed books, against the Popes being
Antichrist; in which all Protestant Churches, confessions, Writers, unanimously
concur, together with our own.

7. Passages purged out against Altars, that the Cross is no Altar, that a
Sacrifice may be without an Altar.
MAster Ward in his Comentary on Matthew, f. 248. lib. 2. p. 43. 44. Answ. 2.
But the Cross is not an Altar, properly so called; for if it were, then it
must either, First, be such in its own nature, which cannot be, the Cross and
the Altar differing, etc. Or else, Secondly, the Cross is an Altar by a humane
use, or humane Ordination; now this is not sufficient, because so any thing may
be made an Altar. Ans. 3. Thirdly, we answer, etc. unto these words; that there
may be a Sacrifice without an Altar; this appears evidently thus: First, the
offering up of Isaac, Genesis 22. was a true Sacrifice; for Isaac was a type of
Christ, both in his immolation or offering, and in his death, and in his life;
Christ dyed for us, and so Isaac did as it were in a certain figure, according
to that of the Apostle, Heb. 11. 19. Abraham received Isaac from the dead in a
figure and similitude; Isaac lived again from this death; so Christ rose
again from the dead. But yet in this sacrifice of Isaac there is no mention at
all made of an Altar, Genesis 22. Isaac verse 7. says, Behold the fire and the
wood, but where is the Lamb for the burnt Offering? where we see, that he
requires a Lamb, but he requires not an Altar; as if the one were necessary
unto a Sacrifice, not the other. Secondly, what is more necessary for a feast
or banquent then a Table, and yet a banquet may be without a Table; whence the
Martyrs when they were in prison celebrated the Lords Supper without a Table:
Now the Eucharist is a banquet, yea moreover a memorial of this one sacrifice
of Christ in his death; and is often called a Sacrifice by the Fathers, and yet
has been celebrated often by many of the Fathers in prison without a Table; as
it is said of Lucian, that he consecrated the bread of the Lord, and celebrated
the Supper of the Lord when he had scarce his hands at liberty, using his own
breast instead of a Table: and therefore it is evident, that there may be a
sacrifice without an Altar. Thirdly, what is more necessary for a Preacher when
he is to preach then a Pulpit? that is, it is very requisite and decent, and
profitable for the people, that the Minister should speak unto them out of the
Pulpit, as Ezra did, Ezra 9. But yet it is not simply necessary unto the
essence of a Sermon, for a man may preach upon the plain ground without a
pulpit, as it is said of Chrysostom, who preached unto diverse persons (in his
persecution) standing not in a Pulpit, but at the side of the Lords Table; and
therefore an Altar does not appertain unto the essence of a Sacrifice. Answ.
4. Fourthly, we answer, etc. unto these words, Christ himself being both the
Knife, Oblation, Altar and Priest (it is said, Heb. 9. 14. that Christ by his
eternal spirit offered up himself unto God;) whence it appears, that his
eternal spirit was a Priest to himself, and therefore might also be an Altar.

8. Sentences expunged against the total and final Apostasy, or falling away
of the Saints from grace, and their Perseverance in Grace.
IN Doctor Featly his Clavis Mystica page 15. 16. 17. No drop of this ointment
of the spirit is ever spilt, no seed of true faith ever corrupts, no spark of
divine grace ever dies; once thoroughly regenerated and ever a new creature;
once graciously adopted, and ever a son of God; once effectually called, and
ever a true Believer; I grant that it is a very cast thing for them to slip
that walk upon a Sea of glass; but being upheld on the one side by the promise
of God Jer. 38. 40.
I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in
their hearts that they shall not depart from me: On the other side by Christ's
promise; (b) Satan has desired to have you that he Luke 22. 31, 32.
may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not* It
is impossible that any child of God should fall irrecoverably or so
dangerously, that he dye of his fall.

The mortal enemy of our immortal spirits knowing well what stresse this
conclusion bears, how many articles of Religion it supporteth, has in all
ages set some heretics on work to undermine it: The first workman of note
employed herein, was Basilides, who left the whole work to Pelagius, and he the
half to the Semipelagians, and they to the Schoolmen, Jesuits, and other late
Sectaries, who labor with might and maine to overthrow it; which if they could
do, the whole frame (in a manner) of our Christian Faith would soon totter;
for take away perseverance in grace, and certainty of salvation has no ground:
take away certainty of salvation, affiance in God by special faith has no
foundation; take away this special faith in Christ's merits for salvation, the
doctrine of Justification cannot stand; take away the doctrine of
Justification, what will become of the Gospel: The assurance of our salvation
in particular is the staff of our comfort, the life of our hope, and the
anchor of our souls, which is fastened to a threefold Cable, as Saint Bernard
terms it, which can never be broken (viz.)

1. Charitas adoptionis. 2. Veritas promissionis. 3. Potestas redditionis.
God his love in adopting, his truth in promising, or the truth of his
promises, and his power in performance: This threefold Cable, the Sectaries
above named seek to cut asunder.

The first twist, which is the special love of adoption, by making that grace
common to all.

The second, which is the truth of Gods promises, by suspending them upon
uncertain conditions.

The third, which is God his power of performance, by subjecting the efficacy
of grace to the uncertain turn of man's will.

Now the Cables of our Belief being thus cut, the Anchor of our hope must
needs be lost; neither do they only, as much as in them lies, cut asunder
Saint Bernards threefold Cable, but also loosen every link of Saint Paul's
golden Chain; Romans 8. 30.
whom he did predestinate them also he called; and whom he called, them also he
justified; and whom he justified, them also he glorified.

The first link, whom he had predestined, etc. they loosen, by making the
decree of predestination conditional and uncertain. The second link, whom he
called, etc. they loosen, by making the grace of vocation both universal and
resistable. The third link, whom he has justified, etc. they loosen, by making
the act of justification repealable, and the habit of Faith amissible: But St.
Aug. de praed. (...). c. 17. (...)
Austin clincheth them all fast; whom he has predestined, them he has
called, to wit, with a calling according to purpose; not others therefore, but
whom he has so called he has justified; neither others, but such whom he has
predestined, called and justified, them he has also glorified: How can a man
that is effectually called and justified, finally fall away and depart from the
living God, who is locked in the middle of this chain, and fastened to Christ
with the Adamantine links, on the one side of predestination, on the other side
of glorificaon? neither the antiquity of Basilides, nor the wit of Pelagius,
nor the subtilty of the Schoolmen, nor industry of the Jesuits, nor the
vehemence of the Lutherans, nor the sophistry of the Remonstrants, shall ever
cast such a gross mist before the eyes, I say not of faith, but of reason, as
to persuade us, that he can fall finally, whom God has predestined to stand,
that he may be condemned whom God has justified, that he shall ever be a
vessel of dishonor whom God has glorified: illo utique fine qui non habet
finem, as Saint Austin speaks; that he may be cast into hell, whose name is
written in heaven; that he can be in danger of the second death, on whom it
has no power at all: but every regenerate Christian and true Believer is
effectually called, and therefore predestined; is justified by faith, and
therefore saved from wrath; has part in the first Romans 8. 30. Romans 5 1. Apoc.
22 6. Heb. 12. 13. Romans 8. 17.
Resurrection, and therefore the second death has no power over him; is
received into the Church of the first borne, and therefore his name is enrolled
in heaven: Are not all that are born again of water and the spirit the sons
of God? if sons, then also heirs: it is the Apostles consequence; Are not all
true believers lively members of Christ's mystical body, which is the true
Church? if they are so, they must continue so, that Christ's body be not maimed,
etc. Saint Austin and Gregory make good the inference; Aug. de Doct. Christ. l.
3. c. 32. Non (...) Rex Su^^mon del (...), quid secundum prae(...) suae gratiam
sanctam Ecclesiam de in (...) permansaris sanctis construxit.

Heb. 12. 2.

Phil. 2. 13.


Saint Austin expressly denying that to be Christ's body in truth, and
consequently those members to be members of his body in truth, which shall not
continue so for ever: St. (f) Gregory thus Comenting upon the words of Solomon;
King Solomon made himself a bed or Chariot of the wood of Lebanon: the wood of
Lebanon is said never to corrupt or rot, Solomon therefore made his bed or
Chariot (he meaning the spiritual Solomon, Christ) of the wood of Lebanon,
because according to the grace of his prescience, he has built a holy Church
of Saints, that shall continue so for ever.

P. 18. Indeed if this affection were, grounded upon any thing in us, or
depending upon the liberty of our will, our changeableness might make us
suspect the constancy thereof: but since all the graces and virtues that shine in
the faithful, are but the reflections and glissonings of the beams of his
grace: which begins and consummateth all good in us, working in us both the
will and the deed. how should this heavenly fire of Gods love ever go out, etc.
Mark the rays of the visible sun, how constant they are, being not moved at
all, by the motion of the Object, but immoveably flowing from the body of the
sun, though blustering winds tyranize in the air, and remove it a thousand
times out of his place in an hour, yet the sun beams keep to their object which
they enlighten, and stir not at all; in like manner our affections are
transported with every gale of prosperity and storm of adversity, and our wills
somewhat yield to every wind of temptation; yet Gods affections like the beams
of the sun, remain immovable where they are once fixed; for they depend not
upon any qualities in us, but upon his own immutable essence, who is more
constant then we are inconstant, more strong then we are weak, more sufficient
then we are insufficient, we praise and dispraise with a breath, frown and
smile with a look, love and hate with a conceit; but Gods affections are not
like ours, nor are Isa. 55 8 John 13. 1. 2 Timothy 2. 13. 19.
his thoughts our thoughts, neither are his ways our ways, for whom he loves
he loves to the end, and though we be unmercifull, yet he still abides
faithful, he cannot deny himself.

Page 19. But I subsume, all true believers are the elect of God; how then can
they perish; if the election of all the faithful be not as evident as the
salvation of the elect in Scripture, why does Saint Paul style faith, the faith
of Gods elect? why does St. Luke assign election as the proper cause of faith?
as many as were ordained to eternal life believed: as for the reprobates, if
we believe the ancient Fathers, they are as far Tit. 1. 1. Acts 13. 48. f
Greg. l. 28. in Job c. 6. extra Ecclesiae me^suras omnes reprobi, etiamsi intra
fide^^^mi tem esse videantur.
^om faith as from salvation; all reprobates, says Saint (f) Gregory, are
without the ^^unds of the Church, although they seem to be within the pale of
faith, and as far from ^^e repentance as from faith: God brings none of
these, says Saint Aug. conc. pel. l. 5. c. 4. Idem de un^t. Eclesiae c: 23.
hoc donum proprium est little quireg^abunt cum Christo.

Mat. 13. 5. 8.


Austin to healthful and spiritual repentance, whereby a man is reconciled to
God, and as far from Charity as from both, for this gift of the holy Ghost,
says the same Father, is peculiar and proper to them who shall reign with
Christ.

The faith of hypocrites is resembled by our Savior to seed sown upon stony
ground, which because it had no root soon withered; but true faith to seed
sown in good ground, which took deep root downward in humility, and grew
upword in hope, and spread by charity, and brought forth fruits of good works
abroad in great abundance: it is the plant which our heavenly Father planteth
in our hearts, and shall never be rooted out: it is the true Plin. l. 21. c. 8
Amaranthus that never fades; but after all the flowers are blown away, or
fall with the leaf, being watered at the root, reviveth and serves for winter
garlands; even so a grounded belief, after the flowers of open profession of
Christ are blown away by the violent blasts of persecution or temptation, being
moistened with the water of penitent tears, reviveth again, and makes winter
garlands for Christ's spouse.

Page 769. 1. Of the supposition, when the righteous turns away from his
righteousness: is not this supposition impossible? can the righteous turn
away from his righteousness and commit iniquity, and do according to all the
abominations that the wicked does? I answer:

First, whether he can do so or no, the Prophet here determines not, but in
case he do so, he pronounces his doom.

Secondly, whatsoever interpretation we make of this Scripture, it favors
not the Popish or Semipelagian tenet, concerning the possibility of the
Apostasy of Saints: for it is confessed Bellarm. l. 3. de Justif. c. 12.
on all hands, that these words are spoken in general to all, elect as well
as reprobate, and they are of singular use to stir them up to watchfulness
over their ways, and diligence and constancy in the use of all such means, as
by Gods grace may keep them from backsliding and dangerous relapses; yet the
elect as they themselves freely grant, who are predestined to eternal life,
are in no danger of losing it: this Commination therefore makes nothing
against the perseverance of Saints.

Thirdly, yet because he is cleansed but in part, and has but a temporary
faith, and some flashes of heavenly light, it is possible for him with Demas,
to forsake the Gospel and embrace this present world; with Hymeneus and
Philetus, to make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience: with Julian to
become an Apostate and a persecuter of the truth: in a word, he may depart from
the seeming righteousness which he has in the eyes of men, but not in the
sight of God, as Saint Gregory speaks; or from the true righteousness which
he had in part, and that measure of sanctification which before he received.

Fourthly, no man ever made question, but that a truly regenerate man may
depart from his actual righteousness, and commit inquity, and do according
to all the abominations that the wicked does, and that if he should dye without
repentance, that his former righteousness should stand him in no stead, but
that he should suffer the pains of eternal death, which is all that the letter
of this Text enforces our assent unto.

Page 770. although it be most true, that an elect child of God can never fall
quite out of Gods favor, yet does not the light of his countenance at all
times shine equally upon him; sometimes he substracteth his grace from him for
the abuse thereof: and hence it comes to pass, that he falls often, and
sometimes dangerously; the wise man says, the righteous falls seven times a
day, and therefore more then seventy times seven times in all his life;
whereupon Saint Ep. 44. si cadit quomodo nostus? si iustus quomodo cadit? sed
iusti vacabulum non amittit qui semper per poenitentiam resurgit.
Jerome makes a Prove. 24. 16.
witty quere; If he fall, how is he righteous? if righteous, how does he fall?
and gives us the solutian of it in a word; he loses not the appellation of a
righteous man, who rises always by repentance: his meaning is, that though
the righteous fall dangerously and greivously hurts himself, yet he never
dies of his fall, but his limbs are recovered by grace, and he rises again
by repentance, and ever after walks more circumspectly in the paths of Gods
Commandments.

Fifthly, the Prononne (his) gives some light to clear the meaning; for the
Prophet says not simply, when the righteous turns away from righteousness,
but from his righteousness, that is, the righteousness of his own works, or
his inherent righteousness not the imputed righteousness of Christ, for that
is not his own: That I may be found in him, not having mine own
righteousness which is of the law, but the Phil. 3 9.
righteousness which is of God by faith: Admit Christ's righteousness, by
which every true believer is justified, cannot be lost, yet he may lose his
own righteousness, that is, it is very possible, and daily experience
verefieth it, that he may give over his strict observance of the duties of the
first and second Table, he may let loose the reins to sensual desires, and he
may follow the gainful, or ambitions, or voluptuous courses of the world; for
the way to Heaven is up-hill, but the way to hell is down-hill, and thither the
weight of our sinful flesh sorcibly tends: All these purgations we have in
Doctor Featlyes Sermons.

There are these ensuing purgations made in Master Ward his Comentary on
Matthew, fol. 300. (part 1. page 33.) There are two sorts of evil, to wit,
First, some are only precedent, which being once taken away return no more;
now these hinder the foundation, but not the edifice and are taken away by God
in the elect; as for example: First, the death of the soul in good things:
Secondly, the captivity and slavery they are in under finne: Thirdly, the
general and total pollution which is in them by reason of sin and the like.

Secondly, some are succedent, which hinder the increase, as thorns in the
wheat hinder What hurt there is in this clause, I cannot discern.
the corn from growing; now these are daily to be taken away, and must be
taken away after the plantation of grace; as sin daily springs up, so it is
daily to be rooted out.

Page 67. Ob. Bellarmine here objects; the love of many shall wax cold, and
therefore all righteous men shall not presevere in faith, and consequently all
shall not be saved.

An. The Cardinal here proves nothing against us, except he will prove, that
those who fall from the Lord, or whose charity waxes cold, were such as were
righteous before God by a true faith, or who had the love and faith of the
elect of God, whereof mention is made Titus 1. 1. now that these were not such,
is clear from verse 24: of this Chapt. they would seduce, if it were possible,
the very elect: and from Saint Augustine, Charitas quae desert potest nunquam
ver a fuit; that love which falls away, was never any true love, or charity
which may be forsaken, was never true Charity.

In the printed book, fol. 334. (but in the Abridgement of purgations, page
83.) it is questioned between us and the Papists, whether Election or
Predestination to life eternal, be from Gods free grace, or a foresight of
man's good works and faith?

First, it is agreed upon betwixt us and them, that there are some elected and
predestined and this is clear from Matthew. 20. 16. and 22. 14. and 24. 31.
Romans 8. 30. Ephesians. 1. 4. and

Secondly, it is agreed betwixt us also, that those who are elected and
predestined, are elected unto an eternal Kingdom, as is plain from Luke
12. 32. And,

Thirdly, it is likewise agreed upon betwixt us, that those who are elected
unto life eternal, shall infallibly and certainly be saved: and this is proved
from Mat. 24. 22. 24. John. 6. 29. and 10. 28, 29. and 11. 29.

This was assented unto by the best esteemed Divines in the Council of Trent,
and thought to be Catholic, because it was consonant to the opinions both of
Thomas, Scotus, and the most School-writers, and also to the doctrine of Saint
Paul, and Catharinus himself could not deny it: Read the History of the
Council of Trent, lib. 2. p. 211. 212. Yea, Belarmine himself does affirm as
much plainly, De great. and. Lib. Arbit. lib. 2. cap. 10. which is worth
observing, because elsewhere he contradicts himself; teaching, That the elect
may fall from faith and salvation, and utterly and eternaly lose both.

Fourthly, the Papists affirm, that faith and works foreseen, were the
impulsive and moving cause of the decree of election unto life everlasting.

Fifthly, we say that the impulsive and moving cause of the decree of election
is only that (...), and good will and free grace of God; and this we confirm
from these places, Luke 13. 32. John 15. 16. Romans 11. 5. Ephesians. 1. 6.

Idem. on Matthew page 134. printed, and 253. written copy: Some in opposition
to Zanchies position of the perseverance of the Saints, object this place to
prove; that those who are truly faithful may fall wholly from faith, and
consequently may perish eternally.

Answ. 1. First, this is but a parable, and insufficient to evert such a
comfortable and well grounded Doctrine as this is, concerning the perseverance
of the faithful.

Answ. 2. Secondly, This Parable was given only to the Jews, and belongs
principally unto them (although it may be applied to such as they were) as it
appears by our Saviors conclusion, so shall it be with this wicked generation.

Answ. 3. Thirdly, by this Parable our Savior would show that destruction did
hang over the heads of the Jews; and why? not because they were once
justified, and endued with true faith, and afterward altogether lost it, and
fell from the grace of God; but because they had received the law of God, etc.
unto these words: and this is the plain and the direct meaning of our Savior
in this place, and makes nothing against the preseverance of the faithful, or
as though those who were once endued with true faith, and truly freed from
Satan, might lose their faith wholly, and fall into the hands and power of
satan and perish eternally, because nothing less then this can be deduced from
this place.

Answ. 4. Fourthly, Melanchton, etc. unto the end, which sin he calls a
sin against conscience, and therefore it cannot be meant of those who are
only tempted by a humane temptation, and sin not out of contempt, but of
ignorance and infirmity, as all the faithful sin.

In Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, the Licenser expunged these
ensuing passages touching Perseverance, and against falling from grace.

Page 61. and 146. Whom he graceth, he graceth to the end; whom he loves, he
loves unto the end: page 445. What? is it possible for men to fall from the
grace of God? out of the love and favor of God for ever? for whom he loves,
he loves to the end; John 13. 1 Hypocrites may fall away, Luke 8. 13. 1 Cor.
10. 12. and even the elect themselves must be circumspect, they must not set
all at six and sevens, but must watch over themselves that they fall not away.

Page 166. 167. there is a great aff^ity betwixt the elect and the reprobate,
simia quam similis: the elect and reprobate have all one and the same gifts in
substance, but they differ in quantity, measure and manner of receiving.

The elect have the Fountain, together with the streams, and the root with
the branches, they with their knowledge, zeal, etc. have Jesus Christ and a
lively faith; whereas the reprobate have the stream without the Fountain, the
branches without the root, the grass on the house top, and corns in the wall,
that suddenly withers and dies; so they fall from the knowledge they had, and
from the faith, despise the holy Ghost, make a mock of the word, and despise
the joys of Heaven.

These gifts sink deeply into the hearts of the elect, whereas they rest only
in the senses and brain of the reprobate; they go a little way into the heart
of the reprobate, and affect them for a time, but as a corrupt stomach casts
up the meat again, though never so good, so those defiled consciences spew up
that again which they tasted of; the godly keep them, and are nourished by
them; the reprobate have the knowledge of Christ swimming in their brain, and
their hearts are little affected; they have speculativum cognitionem, but not
applicativam, John 17. 3. they have a taste of true faith, but not a true faith
indeed; they have fidem historicam, hypocriticam, temporarium, meticulosam, sed
non justificantem; they have spiritum illuminantem, sed non sanctificantem;
they taste the word but eat not the word to be nourished by it, they have a
sight of Heaven, as Balaam had, so Moses had of the Land of Canaan, but they
^^er not into Heaven; they have gifts like them, as counters are like gold, but
not the very gifts.

Page 252. God never takes his spirit from a man, by whom we are sealed to the
day of Redemption.

Page 319. the children of God may same grievously, as Noah, David, Peter, and
others have done, but they cannot sin against the holy Ghost; in themselves
they may, in regard of the corruption of their own nature, but in regard of
Gods grace, promise and covenant, they cannot; for whom Christ loves, he
loves to the end, and none can take his sheep out of his hands; yet let us not
be high minded, but fear, and work out our salvation with fear and trembling
all the days of our life.

9. Passages expunged against Arminians, Semi-pelagians and Arminianisme.
DOctor Peatly his Clavis Mystica, page 90. What are the little Foxes, but the
Demipelagian cubs, which will spoil our fairest clusters; the Colleges of
both Universities, if in time they be not looked unto, as they have done
already in our neighbor Vine in the Low Countries.

Ibidem page 898. I told you before; that this was a wet step, and many here
have slipped; for some odiously object, that unless we will grant universal
grace, and a power in the will of man to resist and frustrate the work of the
spirit in our conversion, and that unless these Jews had sufficient grace
offered them to repent them of their sins, and thereby prevent this their final
overthrow, the prediction of our Savior was to no end and purpose; nay, that
his tears over Jerusalem, might seem like to those which Julius Caesar shed
for Pompeyes death, who yet himself procured it, or might have hindered it if
he would; did not Christ (say they) foresee and decree the destruction of
Jerusalem? how then does he bemoane it with tears?

10. Passages deleted, That men may be Assured of their salvation, and that
Assurance of it is attainable in this life.
IN Doctor Clerks Sermons, page 93, instead of these words, was sure of his
salvation, the Licenser has put in these words, obtained salvation.

We find these clauses deleted by the Licenser in Doctor Jones his Comentary on
the Hebrews, Written copy, page 310. The Church of Rome introduces a doubting
says; we must never be assured of the forgiveness of our sins. the favor
of God, and kindness of his Son, that is presumption; yet the Scripture
would have us come to God with assurance of faith; why doubtest thou, O thou of
little faith? he that doubts is like the wave of the sea.

Ibid. page 335. In this description of faith, and the whole commendation of
it, throughout this chapter say the Jesuits, the Apostle knew not the special
forged faith of the Protestants, whereby these new Sectaries and their
followers assure themselves of the remission of their sins, that they
themselves shall be saved, yea verily even this special faith is to be found
in this chapter as before.

Secondly, all these heleevers did steadfastly believe they should be saved,
they all looked for eternal happiness, therefore they were assured of the
forgiveness of their sins; for without remission of sin there is no
salvation.

Thirdly, the spirit cries in the hearts of all the faithful, Abba Father;
now they cannot call God father, if they be not persuaded of their
reconciliation by Jesus Christ, and that their sins are washed away in his
blood; this special faith of the Protestants has sure footing in the Word of
God, and the doubting faith of the Papists is excluded out of Scripture.

In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, these passages are wholly obliterated;
Matthew. 19. 29. shall inherit everlasting life.

Whether may we in this life be assured of life everlasting or not?

First, in this life, not only we may, but we ought also to be assured and
certain of everlasting life, Ursin. de vita etern. qu. 7. Quest. Answ. 1.


Secondly, we may be certain of it three manner of ways (viz.) first, by
faith, or by a full persuasion of the good will of God toward us; and
secondly, by the beginning Answ. 2.
of true repentance, or by a full purpose and intent within us, to live
according to Gods Commandments; and thirdly, by peace of conscience, by a
desire of God, and by our joy and gladness in him.

Thirdly, this certainty and assurance is grounded on sure and strong reasons,
viz. first the author of everlasting life is unchangeable, even God himself;
secondly, Gods election Answ. 4.
is unchangeable; thirdly, Christ is heard in all things which he desires of
his father; but he prayed that his father would save all those whom he had
given him; fourthly, Christ has said, That no man shall pluck his sheep out of
his hands, but he will give unto them everlasting life, John 10. 28. and Saint
Paul says, the foundation of God remains sure, 2 Timothy 2. 19.

Ibidem fol. 176. Thou must come to a certainty of faith and grace; f. 324. to
be made partakers of an infallible assurance of salvation, are deleted.

Ibidem fol. 240. in the written copy, before Quest. 3. We should labor for
faith and the increase thereof: Fourthly, faith is our seal and spiritual
Unction whereby we are assured of pardon, reconciliation, adoption,
justification, and after death, of glorification, 1 Cor. 1. 21. Now a weak
faith cannot assure us of these, wherefore if we desire to be certain of them,
we must labor to grow up and increase in faith. Quest. 3. Who are blameworthy
in this particular. Answ. two sorts of people, namely, 1. those who neglect
faith; and secondly, the Papists, etc.

Quest. 1. Wherein are Papists to blame concerning the augmentation of faith?

Ans. They are faulty in two things; negant fiducium, and certundinew fidei;
they grant faith, but deny both confidence and certainty of faith; But of these
conjointly and not apart, and that by diverse degrees and steps: Now the
question here is concerning the passive, not active faith; Thirdly, the Papists
being asked what this passive faith is which we give when we believe, do in a
manner make it no other then an historical says placing it wholly and
altogether in the understanding credimus vera esse revelata, and promissa;
atque a Deo justificari impium per gratiam, Coneil. Trident. we believe that
all the promises, and whatsoever else is affirmed in the revealed will, or
written Word of God, are true, and that the wicked are justified of God by
grace: But confidence (they say) is no part of faith; for fides est animi cer
atudo de absentibus, supra opinionem and infra scientiam. Thom. 22. and 4. 1.
But we say that confidence and trust is the chiefest thing in faith, yea, and
that a particular trust and confidence.

Object. 1. Against this the Papists object; it is no where written in
Scripture that Peter or Stephen shall be saved, and therefore faith is only
general and not particular.

Answ. 1. First, all the godly regenerated and elected shall be saved; this is
true, but very obscure. Ans. 2. Secondly, that Solomon, James or John shall be
saved we acknowledge it to be no where found in Scripture, neither do we
contend about it. Answ. 3. Thirdly, whosoever believes shall be saved John 3.
16. and therefore if Solomen, James and John do believe they shall be saved;
Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace, to the end the promise
might be sure to all the faithful, Romans 4 16 Yea, Abraham being fully
persuaded, that what he had promised he was also able to perform, verse 21. it
was imputed unto him for righteousness, verse 22. Now it was not imputed to
him only, but shall also be imputed unto us, of (with him) we believe on him
who raised up Ies^^ our Lord from the dead, ver. 23 24. Where we see that all
the spiritual seed of Abraham's faith shall be saved, that is whosoever lays
hold ^^ on the promises of the Gospel made unto the faithful in Christ, and
by a true and lively faith between them to be good and true in general, and
good and gracious unto him in particular shall be saved; yea we have a plain
place for the proof of a particular faith in the Psalme^ where it is said, he
shall not be afraid of evil ^ydings his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord,
Psalm. 112. 7. but of this I have elsewhere more largely to treat.

Quest. 9. Because I said that every one who by a lively faith lays particular
(...) upon the promises of the Gospel applying them unto himself by the merits
of Christ shall be saved, it may therefore be questioned, how or in what order
our salvations wrought? Ans. 1. First God opened by a new way both the gates of
heaven and hell Heb. 10. 20. Ans. 2. Secondly, this new way he published and
made known in his word, condemning all other ways, read Romans 1. 2. and 3.
chapters, this is to be believed. Answ. 3. Thirdly, in the Scripture the Lord
exhorts us to adhere and trust only unto Christ this new way, and to seek
salvation in him, and to hope for salvation by him Heb. 3. 9. therefore this
also is to be believed. Answ. 4. Fourthly, God promises salvation unto all
those who believe in Christ, and he is faithful in all his promises yea he
that believes not God, will make him a liar, 1 John 5. 10. as though there
could be any salvation by any other means then only by faith in Christ; and
therefore Saint John (...) his Epistle, that those to whom he writes may
believe, 1 John 5. ^3 there being no other way to come unto heaven, Acts 4. 12.
We affirmed before, that the Papists deny, that there is any particular trust
or confidence in faith, or any certainty of faith, both which we condemn as
errors in them; and therefore for the making good of this tax, censure no
charge, I will propound two Questions, namely, Quest. 1. How does it appear
that there is any trust or confidence in faith? Answ. It appears by these
particulars, viz. First, Saint Paul gives unto faith, strength, certainty and a
full persuasion, Romans 4. 20, 21. Heb. 3. 6. 14. yea trust and confidence,
Ephesians. 3. 12. and Secondly; the phrase to believe in Christum, in Christ, does
denote a confidence and trust, Thom. Aq. 1 Pet. 1. 21. And thirdly, if the
miraculous faith have confidence in its object (as it has, 1 Cor. 13. 2.) then
much more the saving faith in its. Answ. 4. If the faith of prayer has trust
and confidence (as it has, James 1. 6. and 5. 15. and 1 John 5. 14. 15.) then
faith has particular trust and confidence. And fifthly, the Papists in a
manner or almost confess thus much; for first, they say, that fiducia oritur a
fide trust and confidence springs from faith; and secondly, that therefore the
safest course is to depend upon the mercy of Christ, Bellarm. Qu. 2. How does
it appear that there is any certainty of faith? An. It appears evidently by
these grounds, to wit, first, by the attributes given to faith, it is called
(...), the substance, ground or confidence of things hoped for, Heb. 11. 1. and
(...), a confidence, and (...), a bold assurance, Heb, 3. 6. 6. 14. and (...),
Heb. 10. 22. a full assurance of faith, quasi plenis velis ad Christum, because
it carries us with full sails unto Christ, Illirious. And secondly, because we
are said to know, 1 John 3. 14. and 4. 13. 16. Bellarmine answers hereunto,
that to know, includes not certainty; but David shows the contarry, Psalm. 16.
8. and 27. 5. and 125. 1. And thirdly, because the holy Ghost testifies it,
Romans 8. 16. Gal. 4. 6. Rom 8. 38. and 2 Timothy 4. 8. and hence Saint John says,
that he who believes, has the witness in himself, 1 John 5. 10. and
therefore they are Butchers of men's consciences, who deny and take away this
assurance. And fourthly, because this certainty of faith is plainly and clearly
taught in the word of God 2 Pet. ^. 10. and 1 Pet. 1. 13.

In the same written copy, fol. 225. this whole pious, orthodox discourse is
purged out.

How may we know whether we are brought to Christ or not?

We may know it by these signs, by which we must seriously try and examine
Quest.
our selves; namely, examine first, if we perpetually meditate of Christ, if we
think upon Answ.
him day and night, if we be conjoined to him in our hearts; then it is a sign
that we are are brought unto him: Secondly, if we always speak of Christ, and
that from the abundance of the heart, then it is a sign that we enjoy Christ,
for a Vessel sends forth such liquor as it has within: Thirdly, if we
always depend upon Christ, flying still to him as unto our only refuge, making
him our Cornu-copia, and esteeming him to be our Physician, our Fountain, our
Righteousness, our Life our Light, our Virtue, our Way our Food, yea all in
all, then it is a sign that we enjoy him. Fourthly, if Christ being awakened,
answer and help us (as he did his Disciples, Matthew. 8.) if being called upon he
hear us, then it is a sign that he is in us, and remains with us; if we can
confidently and truly say with David, I will call upon the Lord, and then I
shall be safe, Psalm. 18. 3. it is an argument of Christ's presence. Fifthly, if
we be filled with joy and comfort in our souls, it is a sign that we are
brought unto Christ, i. e. if we rejoice in the Lord, and again rejoice, Phil.
4. 4. delighting our selves in him, and in comparison of him, thinking all
other things as dross, Mat. 13. 44. etc. Phil. 3. 8. Mel in ore melos in aure,
jubilium in cord, Bern. S. 1. Pet. 18. if he be honey in our mouth, and music
in our ears, and a rejoicing to our hearts, then it is a good argument that he
lives with us, and lodges within us, 1 Pet. 1. 8. Sixthly, if we have peace
within, that is, first the spirit of God witnessing unto our spirits that we
are the sons of God, Romans 8. 15, 16. and 1 John 5. 10. and secondly, the
providence and protection of the Lord, securing us from all want and danger,
Psalm. 30. 7. Romans 8. 28. and 1 Cor. 10. 13. and thirdly, we from this assurance
casting our selves boldy and confidently upon the Lord as David did Psa. 11. 1.
and 27. 1. 3. and 56. 4. 11. and 18. 6, 7. then we may be sure that we are
brought home truly unto Christ. Seventhly, if Christ rule and reign and bear
sway in our hearts, 2 Cor. 10. 4. Col. 3. 15. and that first, obediendo, by
enabling us to obey him, John 14. 15. and 1 John 2. 3. etc. and that with such
delight, that we think his yoke easy and his burden light, ver. 29. and also
secondly, compescendo, by subduing our affections, and repressing and
suppressing our lusts, enabling us to see and to be sensible of those sins
that hang so fast on, and cleave so fast too, Heb. 12. 1. yea making us with
the sense of them, to cry out with Saint Paul, me miserum, O wretched man that
I am who shall deliver me, Romans 7. 24. Yea, with the knowledge of the soar,
giving us a knowledge of the salve, with the sense of the malady, the fight of
the remedy; and as those who being stung with the fiery serpents, looked upon
the brazen Serpent, so Christ with the sight of our sins, gives us a sight of
himself, our Savior; and when we look upon our transgressions with horror,
then he turns our eyes toward him for comfort 1 Cor. 2. 2. Irae impetum
cohibet, superbia tumorem sedat, livoris vulnus sanat, luxuriae fluxum
restringit, libidinis flammum extinguit, situm avaritiae temperat, totius
dedecoris pruriginem fugat, Bern. S. Cantic. And thirdly, unprimende, by
engraving good affections in our hearts, and by infusing the wine of grace into
our souls, and comforting us by his spirit; Sensus reparat, virtutes roborat
honestos mores vegetat, castas affectiones fovet. Bern. S. Cantic. Christ
reviewes our faculties, coroberates our graces and virtues nourishes in us
good affections, begets in our hearts good habits, and in our lives good
actions, and so rectifies our conversations, that they become honest and
unblameable before men: certainly, he that is thus governed by Christ, and
enabled by him to subdue and suppress all evil affections and is filled with
good and holy desires within, and obeys the Lord in his life and
conversation, does enjoy Christ, and is truly brought unto him, and therefore
let us seriously examine our selves by these particulars.

What harm or error was couched in these passages that they must be quite
obliteterated, and not suffered to pass the Press, transcends our capacities
to apprehend, but only that they somewhat thwart the Papists.

11. Passages deleted against Auricular Confession of our Sins to Popish
Priests.
IN Doctor Clerks Sermons, page 443. this passage is expunged Saint James is
flat for Auricular Confession.
that; Auricular confession. Apostolical too; was it not to the Priests that
Judas said peccavi, confessed he had sinned in betraying innocent blood?

In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, written copy, f. 10. this is deleted.

First, the Papists answer hereunto, that the parts of repentance are three, to
wit first, contrition, or as some of them say, Attrition; secondly, Auricular
confession; Thirdly, Satisfaction of Merit.

Idem fol. 125. Secondly, confess and make known thy temptations to some
pious and faithful friend. Here we blame Auricular popish confession; first,
because it does discover lascivious and wanton women; secondly, because it is
ordinarily enjoined; and thirdly; held to be a work deserving pardon, opere,
operato; But first, if men not women, would confess themselves: and secondly,
not always, but in a case of conscience, when his corruptions are likely to
prevail against him; yea, thirdly, not the sins committed already, but only
the temptations and provocations and assaults unto sin; and fourthly, not to
confess to every one, but to some pious, prudent, discreet and grave friend or
Minister, etc. we blame it not.

Idem fol. 227. Ans. 4. A wounded conscience is of all burdens the heaviest to
a circumcised heart; thy sins be forgiven thee, we see Christ here neither
requires confession, nor demands or reserves satisfaction of this sick man, but
wholly takes away his sins, to teach us that Christ pardons our sins truly,
Heb. 8. 12. Ier. 31. 31. etc. Isa. 43. 25. Heb. 10. 17.

Answ. 4. Popish auricular confession, we tax for three things, namely, first,
ob coactionem, etc. secondly, ob enumerationem; thirdly ob finem falsum;
because the end propounded therein by the Papists is false; for they teach men
to confess their sins that by the peoples confession and the Priests
absolution, their sins may be taken away and pardoned by God; opere operato,
even by the bare work wrought.

The Papists command Confession for these two ends, viz. First, that their
confession may take away sins with God, and this they labor and dispute
strongly for, and relate many fables to prove it; if the studious Reader desire
a view of their Fables, he may find some in Antidot. Anim, page 145. Col. 3.
and 149. Col. 3. and 2. they have worse ends of their confession then these,
and that is, to reveal whores, whoredoms and the like, read Antidot. Anim. p.
145. Col. 3. 4.

Ibidem part 1. page 115. Quest. 5. seeing that it is lawful, and in some
cases requisite, that some persons should sometimes confess some sins unto
their Pastors, and that the Pastor should admonish and advise them hereunto (as
was showed, Mat. 3. 6.) when their consciences are troubled with any sin,
then whether ought Ministers to take an oath of secrecy, the rather to induce
men to confess freely? An. There are two things here to be considered of for
the resolution of this question, viz. First, whether it be lawful? And 2.
whether it be expedient?

First, we must consider whether it be lawful to take such an Oath of secrecy
or not?

First, I think no man denies (except the Anabaptists) that in general it is
lawful by Gods law to take an oath, either first, assertory; secondly,
promissory (upon weighty cause) though it be not before a Magistrate.

Secondly, although the positive law threaten a Praemunire to him who imposes
an oath without authority, yet I know no danger to him who assumes it willingly
and voluntarily.

But thirdly, whether this particular Oath be against our laws, I want skill
to determine; for on the one side concealment (in some cases) makes a man
accessory though after the fact; and what may not be performed must not be
promised, especially by oath: On the other side, the ancient Canons of the
Church forbid (upon great penalty) to reveal confessions; and our Law 1. Eliz.
confirm all the Canons that are not opposite to the Word of God, as I suppose
this not to be.

Secondly, we must consider whether it be expedient or not; to take such an
Oath?

This is the greater Question, and must be resolved by the grounds moving it:
for whatsoever is lawful in this, must be judged fit or unfit, Hypothesi,
according to the fit or unfit circumstances which cloth it; first therefore, if
first, the confitent (being burdened in conscience, and desirous to unfold his
sore) be hindered by fear or shame of public discovery; and secondly, if there
be no other end in the pastor but to free him from this fear, I see no reason
why he may not by such a reverend protestation, assure him of that whereto his
own office and conscience bind him; for as the Canons commands concealment so
Zozomen (speaking of the times within three hundred years of Christ) says,
such men as are burdened in conscience, and desire to unfold their griefs,
must choose for their Confessor, a man upright of life, prudent, and secretorum
tenacem, a faithful concealer of secrets. But

Secondly, if the Minister use such an oath as an assuring bait, to draw
unwilling men to confess, for the satisfying of his own curiosity or private
ends, non laudo, it can neither be defended, commended, nor excused. But

Thirdly, I must add, that seeing temptations lurk secretly in the heart, it
is safer to leave them to the hearts great searcher, then to condemn them upon
ungrounded suspicion unless made evident by some disclosing circumstances,
wherein it is both more commendable and charitable to suspect a great deal too
little, then a little too much; hoc est consilium fidele and verax, etc.

12. Passages deleted against the Arbitrary, Tyrannical power of Kings;
disobedience to their unjust, popish and wicked commands, resisting their
tyranny; and the mortality of Kings.
IN Master Wards Comentary upon Matthew, f. 324. in the written copy, the
Licenser obliterated this ensuing discourse on Mat. 22. 21. Give unto Caesar
the things which are Caesar's: Quest. Whether is it altogether unlawful to
resist civil power, when it is wicked and unjustly oppresses the Church and
Commonwealth, and compels Subjects to commit adultery, and persecutes true
Religion with fire and faggot? Answ. 1. First, it is lawful for Ministers to
reprehend and rebuke the sins of all who are under their charge, and
consequently Kings, Princes, Peers and Magistrates, when they offend; as is
evident both by the examples of the Apostles and Prophets, and also from these
places, 1 Timothy 5. 20. and 2 Timothy 4. 2. Heb. 13. 17. In which place it is said,
that Pastors shall give account for those Magistrates which perish under their
charge. Secondly, it is lawful for the inferior and subordinate Magistrates
to defend the Church and Commonwealth, when the supreme Magistrate
degenerates, and falls into tyranny or idolatry: for first, Kings are subject
to their Commonwealths, at least unto the law of God, Deuteronomy. 17. 18, 19, 20.
Josh. 1. 8. and secondly, it is the office of the inferior Magistrate as well
as the superior, to maintain and defend the lives and safety of the subjects;
and therefore although the superior Magistrate should neglect his duty, yet
the inferior must not neglect theirs. Thirdly, it is not lawful for any
private person either to take up arms for the defense of the inferior
Magistrates before a danger come, or for their own defense in danger, or for
the avenging of themselves after danger, if they can be defended by an ordinary
power; and this we gather from David, 1 Samuel 24 26. Fourthly, it is lawful
even for a private person to resist with weapons, if a tyrant like a thief,
shall offer violence unto him, either by himself or by another, when he can
neither obtain the relief and help of public authority and power nor escape by
any other means or way, for against whom it is lawful for a man to defend
himself by the Magistrate, against the same it is lawful to defend himself by
himself in a case of necessity: as for example: If a King in his anger should
command one of his followers to kill such a one, or should run upon him
himself with his sword drawn, intending to kill him, if that man could
neither be delivered by the law or government of the Land, nor by flight could
escape away, he might then lawfully with his sword in his hand defend himself
even against the King himself, but he must not offend the King, nor lay his
hand upon the Lords anointed for the very law of nature teaches men to defend
themselves, and to maintain their lives against all the unjust assaults and
practices of any whatsoever. Fifthly, to take away defense of himself from a
private person against a tyrant, is to establish tyranny, for the law of God
does principally require the society of humane conversation, and therefore
those things that are Caesar's are to be given to Caesar; neither is he to be
resisted, so long as he does not oppose himself against God, commanding some
wicked Religion, or some wicked and unjust thing; for as Christ commands us to
give unto Caesar those things, so he commands us to give unto God those things
that be Gods; and God forbids us to give unto Caesar those things which are not
Caesar's, and therefore if Caesar commands that which is repugnant to the
command and will of God, we must not obey him, Acts 4. 19. and 5. 29.

In Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, these sentences are purged out,
page 387. in the written, and 493. in the printed copy: It is comparitively
spoken, all the Statutes, Edicts and Commandments that proceed from Kings, are
not to be feared; Saul commanded the Sergeants to lay violent hands on the
Priests, but they moved not a hand to do it, 1 Samuel 22. 17. Nebuchadnezzer
made a proclamation, that all Nations and kinreds should fall down and worship
his golden Image, yet the three children would not do it, they chose rather to
be cast into the fiery furnace; Darius made a Decree, none should pray to any
God, and yet Daniel he feared not the commandment, still he prayed to the God
of Israel; so Pharaoh gave commandment that the Egyptians children should be
thrown into the River, yet Moses Parents feared God, and chose rather to obey
God then man: If the Kings commandment be according to Gods commandment, then
obey it, if it be repugnant, then it is an excellent demand, Acts 4. 19.
whether it be right in the sight of God, to obey you rather then God, judge ye?
children, says Paul, obey your parents in the Lord; so, Subjects obey your
Kings in the Lord; what reason is there we should obey man above God? honor
Kings as Gods Vicegerents, be thankful to God for Kings, yea though they be
wicked ones, for a tyranny is better then anarchy; pray for Kings, reverence
Kings, but fear not the earthly King before the heavenly; their breath is in
their nostri^l, they are alive to day, and dead to morrow; they have strong
hands and long horns to crush us with; yet God can dry up their hands, as he
did Ieroboams, he can weaken their horns, that they should not gore us with
them; I will tell you, says Christ, whom you shall fear; not him that can
kill the body, and go no further, but he that can cast soul and body into hell
fire; let us fear the King of Kings above earthly Kings; God be thanked, we
have a King, whose commandments are not contrary to Gods Commandments; but if
God in his wrath should send us a King as our sins have deserved, that should
command us to go to Mass, to worship Images, to kill the Saints of God; let
us not fear such Commandments; either our God will deliver us out of their
hands, even miraculously above our expectation, or else take us to himself,
and give us a crown of eternal glory. And page 396. in the written copy, The
fierceness of Kings is not to be feared, when the King of Kings sends us in
his business, etc. When the blood is heated, the mind incensed, this is the
rage of the King; the King was enraged for anger against Moses, as Lamech said,
I would kill a man in my wrath; so where is this Moses? bring him that I may
flay him; and no doubt, he beset the Land, and sent out pursevants after him
unto all places; yet Moses feared it not; the wrath of a King is as the roaring
of a Lion, yet if it be in Gods cause, let us not fear it: The devil is,
(...), so Christ is (...), rapiens, eripiens to deliver us our of his hands;
Nebuchadnezzar was wroth with the three children because they would not fall
down and worship his golden image, they feared it not: Kings are mighty but
God is more mighty; they have long arms that can reach far but God at his
pleasure can dry up their arms, as he dried up Ieroboams hand, when he
stretched it out to strike Esaias 51. 1^.
the Prophet; they have sharp horns, but God can blunt their horns: Of Lions,
he can make them Lambs, as he did Esau and Laban; if they will be Lions still
blustering and roaring against his children, he can send out his Angels on the
sudden to smite them as he did Herod and can cause the very worms to devour
them: Let us honor Kings, yea though they be enemies to Gods Church, let us
reverence their power and authority, but in matters appertaining to the King of
Kings, let us not fear the fiercest of them.

In the same Author, we find these clauses likewise expunged, Written cop. f.
71. Book f. 396. A King and Queen are but flesh and blood: Written copy, f. 52.
Book f. 91. Art thou a King? yet thy breath is in Gods hand: and written copy,
f. 231. Book f. 272. The King that is the breath of our nostrils must once dye.

It seems Kings in this age must be so flattered and their power so elevated
that they must be reputed Gods, and not put in mind of their mortality, no nor
other men; else what means the crossing out of this sentence in the same
Author, page 380. Ye live banished here in Egypt, ye were ready to starve for
hunger, where ye came first; ye are now seated in Goshen, entreated courteously;
yet remember ye must depart, and it will be a heavy departing unto you; we are
wedded to the world, as to a spiritual Egypt, we have need to be put in mind
of our departure from it. Thus the Lord Jesus showed to Peter that the time was
at hand he should lay down his tabernacle, Luke 9. 31. so Philip had ^ Pet. 1.
14
his Usher, who daily said to him, Memento Philippe te esse mortalem.

Did these popish Inquisitors (judge you) ever think of death or their
departure hence, who obliterated such clauses as these?

13. Passages deleted against Popish Blind Obedience.
THe Licenser expunged this clause out of Doctor Jones his Comentary on the
Hebrews; in the written copy, page 352. Some bold Papists take occasion from
hence to extort, caecam obedientiam, blind obedience: Abraham followed God, not
knowing whether he went; so you must follow your teachers, though you know not
whether they call you: There is no consequence in that, we must follow God
though we know not whether, must we therefore follow men? God is wise, men are
foolish; God is truth men are deceitful; therefore says the holy Ghost, try
the spirits, whether they be of God; the Bereans would examine Paul's doctrine
by the Scrirtures before they would follow him; so must we do; the chicken
follows the hen, must it therefore follow the Kite too? if God call us, let us
go though we know not whether; he is our Shepherd he will not lead us into
ditches or deliver us into the hands of the Wolf; he is our Father, he will
not carry his children where they shall be hurt, he is the Eagle; we are his
birds, let him carry us whether it pleases him.

14. Passages expunged against the Papists; that Baptism only binds us to
observe Gods Will and Commandments, and that it absolves not men from all
sins.
IN Master Wards Comentary upon Matthew, chapter 18. verse 20. this clause is
obliterated.

Whether does Baptism only bind us to the observance of the will and
Commandments of God?

First, Bellarm. l. b. 1. de Baptis. cap. 16. answears hereunto. That although
Christians are bound by solemn Vow in Baptism to walk in obedience before God
and to keep his Commandments, yet are they not therefore freed and exempted
from the observance of the Laws and Ordinances of men, which they are bound in
conscience to keep, and that under pain of damnation.

Secondly we answer; that Baptism only binds us to keep the Commandments
of God, and so far forth only to obey men, as they command things lawful;
but we must not be brought in bondage to men's traditions and observations,
seeing we are the Lords free men and by baptism are consecrated to his
service; and this we confirm from this place, Go and teach, baptizing them
etc and teaching them to observe all that I command you; therefore baptism
binds in only to the observation of Gods precepts, 1 Cor. 7. 23. ye are
bought with a price, be not the servants of men: Baptism is a sign of the
death of Christ the price of our redemption therefore we are freed from all
mere humane service in the receiving of Baptism, and for this cause it is
called the baptism of Christ: Augustine (Contr. Petil. lib. 3. 55.) says,
Legimus Paulim dixisse, Evangelium meum, Baptismum autem meum nunquam dixit,
etc. i. e. We read Paul to have said my Gospel, but my Baptism never; for
never any of the Apostles durst call the Baptism of Christ their baptism;
therefore seeing it is the Baptism of Christ, and that we are only baptized
in his name, not in our own names, or the names of men, we must only hope to
be saved by says in him and become his servants wholly: If the studious Reader
would see how this answer of ours is both maintained and opposed. I refer him
to Doctor Willets Synopsis, fol. 582 and Amesius Bellarm. Enervat. tom. 1 page
251, 252.

And in the same Author page 18. this sentence is expunged.

Quest. 3. Wherein does Baptism excel circumcision, that those who were
circumcised run thus unto John to be baptized?

Answ. 1. Pererius the Jesuit says, there is a threefold pre-eminence of
Baptism above Circumcision, viz. first, in the facility and easiness of it,
it not being so painful; secondly, in the universality of it, it being free
for both sexes and all Nations professing Christ; and thirdly, in the efficacy
thereof, because Baptism absolveth a man from all sin, and the punishment
thereof.

Secondly, we willingly acknowledge the two first points of pre-eminence, but
reject justly the third, because neither Circumcision then, nor Baptism now
has any such efficacy, actually to give remission of sins; for if it were
so, then it would follow, that every one who is baptized it surely saved, his
sins being remitted; or else, that his sins being remitted return again:
But God uses not, where he has once forgiven sins, to remember them any
more Ezekiel. 18. 22.

Thirdly Baptism we confess in signification and representation, is more rich
then circumcision was, washing being a more lively resemblance of our eleansing
in the blood of Christ; and besides, it is a commemoration of a benefit
performed, whereas Circumcision was a type of the same to be exhibited: But for
the efficacy there is no difference, seeing they both are seals and
confirmations of faith for the remission of sins, and not actual conferrers
and bestowers of grace, although they are (by the instituti on of Christ)
means and instruments of conveying grace upon the elect.

15. Passages deleted against Becket, Gardener, with other Popish Saints,
Prelates, Writers, and in defense of Calvin and Luther.
IN Doctor Jones his Comentary upon the Hebrews, written copy, page 323. this
clause is totally obliterated.

I pray God there be no such (that knowing the Scriptures and Fathers, sin
against their own knowledge, and that of malice to the truth) among them
(Papists) What did Gardener Bishop of Winchester, and Lord Chancelour of
England, in Queen Mary's days, that burnt Cranmer and Hooper; who when Doctor
Day Bishop of Chichester came unto him, lying on his deathbed in desperation,
and comforted him with the sweet mercies of God in Christ, he brake forth into
this speech; My Lord, you may say so to a man in my case, but open this window
once to the people, and farewell all. Did he not despise the spirit of grace,
and sin against the holy Ghost? Yet I define nothing, I leave him to the
supreme Judge.

In Doctor Clerks Sermons, page 237. after the word wickedness, these words
are blotted out, Becket did; it is in his name (...) for sin, I fetch his name
from Hebrew, because I have read his father was a Jew; he sinned against his
Country and his King, betrayed both to the Pope, and dyed, though not directly,
yet deservedly.

In Master Wards Comentary upon Matthew, fol. 178. the last line but two, this
is gelded out: Where a Papist prays to any Saint in Heaven: for sometimes they
pray to those who in all probability are in hell, as Thomas Becket, Hildebrand,
and diverse cheating Impostors.

Doctor Featlies Clavis Mystica, page 604. Postremum genus eorum est, qui oves
Christi pascunt, sed cibo insalubri, quo magis inficiuntur quam reficiuntur
Christi oves agnique: eorum dico, qui floribus and fructibus Paradisi aut

quibusdam imperitis ipsisque adeo Papistis Calvino inustam eluit, and qui

Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, in the written copy, page 150. As
for the calling of Luther, Calvin, Beza, and of the Ministers of the Gospel,
it is watrantable by the Word, we can show our letters of Orders from Jesus
Christ the great Bishop of our souls.

16. Passages deleted concerning Bishops.
IN Doctor Clarks Sermons, page 173. the Licenser has put out these words; Why
may I not add a Bishop too? let another take his Bishopric, says Saint
Peter, in the Acts, and means it of Judas.

Idem page 398. after Amasiah, these words, Archbishop of that Province, are
blotted out.

Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, in the written Copy, page 138. It
may be Bishops and Archbishops have little feeling of the burden poor
Ministers in the Country are feign to sustain.

17. Passages expunged against the Blindness, Superstition, Idolatrous,
Pompous worship and Adoration of Papists, profane persons, Popish Saints,
Relics.
IN Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, page 35. 36. written copy, this passage
is evpunged. Qvest.


What blindness are we subject unto without Christ? Answ.


There is a double blindness, which men are subject and incident unto; to wit,
First, the blindness of Superstition, which is apparently seen in the Papists,
who first teach us to worship Demoniacks, or damned souls in hell, or
traitors, as Thomas Recket, and impious Gregory the seventh, called Heldibrand.
And secondly, teaches us to worship Chime^^es, fictious, and things that never
were in rerum natura: Thus they teach us to worship Saint Christopher, Sanit
George, Saint Katherine, and many hundreds more which cannot be proved to have
been, or at least, not Saints, but some of them grand impostors. Thirdly, they
teach us to worship vile and base things, as pieces of rotten wood, making then
believe they were pieces of Christ's Cross, and old threadbare garments, for
some sacred Vestments, although the Priests themselves knew them to be
otherwise; yea the Eucharisticall wafer-cakes, although they have been
consecrated flightly, the Priest thinking of some other thing else, and not
intending the consecration thereof, which (according to their own doctrine) is
not then transubstantiated, and therefore is palpable idolatry to fall down to a
bare piece of bread. Fourthly they teach us to place Religion in outward
things, as in the observation of days, meats, apparel, and the like, Col. 2.
17. 18. None of all which things we are taught to do in the Word of God, and
therefore we had need beware of this blindness of superstition.

Secondly, there is a blindness of profaneness, which is twofold; to wit,
either Pura negationis, or Pravae dispositionis, i. e. either natural, or
affected ignorance: First there is in us a natural ignorance, we by nature not
knowing those things which concern the glory of God, or our own salvation;
and this blindness is in all, even in the elect until they be enlightened by
the Spirit of God. Secondly, there is an affected ignorance, when men refuse
the means of knowledge, like those deaf Adders that stop their ears against
the voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely: Now this blindness of
heart is also in every man by nature, for as naturally we know not our duty
toward God, so naturally we desire not the knowledge thereof, but are backward
and negligent in the use of those means, which God has appointed for the
curing of this blindness.

And this, Ibidem page 365. Because our Savior does acknowledge the pouring of
this precious ointment upon him to be a good work, it may therefore be demanded
if the Papists do not well, who worship the Lord in great cost and pomp?
First, Christ praised the precious ointment, not as an ordinary worship, which
should always afterward he imitated, but only as a singular ministry of his
funeral, ver. 12. she did it for my burial: But Christ now is ascended into
Heaven, and is no more to be buried, and therefore this fact of Mary's will he
no ground for the Popish pompom worship: Secondly, the Popish pompous worship
is full of superstition and idolatry, but in this anointing there was none, and
therefore it will not support their pomp: Thirdly, when Christ departed from
the world to Heaven, he left behind him in his stead the poor, commanding us
to honor him by our bounty toward them; and therefore if we would bestow our
liberality aright, we should enrich or refresh with our substance the poor
members of Christ, for he does accept of that which is done unto them, as done
unto himself, Heb. 13. 16.

18. Passages deleted against Superstitious, Popish Ceremonies, and the
abolition of them.
IN Master Wards Comentary upon Matthew, page 212. this clause is obliteraned:
Add nothing unto the Word of God; neither first, the chafe of Superstition,
with the Papists, etc; neither secondly, Machiavillianisme and unwarrantable
policy, with some statists; neither thirdly, new opinions.

Secondly, indeed if any ceremony which our Church uses, should be abused unto
Superstition, or superstitionsly used, and so become offensive unto the best
and dearest members of the church, it were then much better to relinquish then
to retain them, to abolish then to uphold them, as Hezekiah did with the
brazen Serpent, when it was abused unto idolatry; I say, it were better in this
ease to destroy then to enforce them, if authority were so pleased, etc.

Ibidem page 210. this clause is deleated; A man may censure his brother for
doing that which is indifferent, for in evil intent: as for example; if a
Minister should wear the Surplice, not for decency, or for obedience to
authority, but only to vex o^ assend some who are weak or serupulous thereof,
he deserves to be censured and blamed, because as much as in us lies, we must
offend none.

Ibidem page 267. this passage is crossed out; Quest. 2. What superstitious
rites are to be abolished in Baptism?

Answ. Those rites which are used at this day by the Papists, contrary to the
institution of Christ, and practice of the Apostles: Now these rites are either
before the administration of the Sacrament, or in the time of the celebration
of the Sacrament, or after the celebration thereof.

First, before the celebration of the Sacrament they have these ceremonies:
first, the Priest breathes in the child's face, that he may receive the holy
Ghost; secondly, they have their exorcismes, adjurations, or conjurations,
whereby the devil is conjured, adjured, and commanded to depart from the soul
of the Infant to be baptized, and to give way unto the holy Ghost, who now is
at hand: thirdly, then the Priest reads certain prayers belonging to this
adi^ration; and then fourthly, he solemnly consecrates the Font, wherein the
water of Baptism is.

Secondly, the rites used by the Papists in the administration of the
Sacrament, are many: First, the Priest takes the child by the shoulders, and
turning his head toward the east, dips his face once in the water, with these
words; I baptize thee in the name of the Father; Then he turns the Infants
head toward the north, dipping him again with these words? And in the name of
the Son; lastly, he bends his head unto the south, dipping him the third
time, with these words; And the name of the Holy ghost: And thus by this
threefold turning of the child, is formed or made the cross of Christ (into
whose death the Infant is baptized) after the manner in the margent. Secondly,
TSouth. North.
besides the Symboll of water in baptism, the Papists use salt, which is put
into the mouth of the child baptized, which signifies wisdom and prudence of
speech, according to the advice of the Apossle, Let all your words be seasoned
with salt, i. e. of divine wisdom. Thirdly, they then use spittle, wherewith
first, the ears are touched, which signifies, that he that is baptized, ought
to have his ears open to hear the word of God, and the the principles of
Religion: And secondly, therewith also the mouth is touched, together with the
word Eph^ta, signifying, that he should be always prompt and ready to speak of
Religion and the word of God. Fourthly, then they make the sign of the cross,
whereof they have a manifold use, viz. first, they make a cross upon the
child's breast, signifying thereby, that he ought to have and receive the faith
of Christ crucified in his heart, according to that of the Apostle, With the
heart man beleeeves unto righteousness: Secondly, they make a cross upon the
child's forehead, which signifies, that he must not be ashamed to confess
Christ, because blushing appears in the forehead, according to that of the
Apostle, With the mouth confession in made unto salvation; now this cross is
made with the Priests thumb: Thirdly, they make a cross upon the ears of the
Infant, and this cross is made with spittle, signifying that the ears of his
heart should be always shut against the suggestions and temptations of Satan:
Fourthly, they make a cross upon the Infants mouth, and this is made with
spittle also, signifying, that the child should have his mouth always shut,
least he should speak evil words: Fifthly, they make a cross with spittle
upon his nose also, signifying thereby, first, that he should send forth a good
smell and savor of Christ in his life and conversation; and secondly, that he
should frequently offer unto God the fumes and incense of devout and holy
prayers, by which the devil may be smoked out of doors, as Tobie did the evil
spirit, chap. 6. ver. 16, 17: Sixthly, they make a cross upon the child's breast
and shoulder blades, with their conjuring oil, signifying thereby, that the
party baptized should be strong and courageous in the resisting of Satan, and
resolute in bringing forth the fruits of repentance.

Thirdly, after the Sacrament of baptism is administered, the Priest does these
things unto the party baptized (viz.) first, he anoynts him with chryme, or
consecrated oil, which signifies the virtue or grace of the spirit of God,
which they have received by, and in baptism: Secondly, he then gives unto him
a white garment, which signifies a Sacramental or Baptismall innocence, or
that, how he is made pure, innocent and immaculate, both from the guilt and
stain of sin: Thirdly, he puts into his hand a wax taper, lighted, which
signifies, first, the light of faith, which is given in Baptism; and secondly,
that now he is translated out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
light: Fourthly, sometimes they give unto some milk and honey to taste,
whereby it signified, a right or title to eternal life, a figure whereof was
the Land of Canaan, which flowed with milk and honey. All these and diverse
other superstitious rites the Papists superstitiously observe in the
celebration of this Sacrament of Baptism, contrary to Christ's institution and
the Apostles practice, and therefore there is great reason that they should be
abolished. If any think I falsify the Papists by what I have said, or desire
to be more thoroughly informed concerning their practices, additions and
superstitions, ceremonies in this Sacrament of Baptism, then let him well
consider these Authors and testimonies which follow, and he shall find all and
a great deal more then I have set down, Manipulus curatorum de Baptism, cap.

19. Passages purged out, That the Church is not alwnyes visible.
IN Master Words Comentary upon Matthew, page 173. in the printed copy, this
clause is blotted out:

A City that is set on a hill cannot be hid.

The Papists affirm, the Church of Christ to be always visible, and would
confirm it from this verse thus: That which Christ ordained to be the light of
the world is always Obj.
visible; but Christ ordained the church to be the light of the world in this
verse: Therefore the Church is always visible.

First, the major proposition is false, that every light is always visible,
and therefore although we should grant the Church to be the light of the world,
which it is, yet it Answ. 1.
would not follow from thence that it is always visible, for these two causes
(viz.) first because the Sun and Moon were ordained to be great lights (Genesis
1. 16. and Ps. 136. 8.) for the governing of day and night, and yet we see them
often darkened, and suffer strong eclipses; so the Church, though it be ordained
to enlighten the world, by ministering the doctrine of the Scriptures, yet
sometimes it may fail out of men's sights, as has been showed elsewhere, viz.
upon Matthew. 5. 14. Secondly, though the Church be a light, yet such as walk in
darkness, loving that better then the light, do not always see it, but went
either will or eyes thereto: thus the King of Aram's soldiers neither saw the
Horses nor Chariots of fire that were round about Elisha, nor knew that they
were in the midst of Samaria until their eyes were opened.

Secondly, the minor proposition is false also; for although the light of the
Church be granted, yet it is not true, that Christ our Savior ordained it is
to be always the light of the world, according to this verse, ye are the
light of the world, for these words were spoken by Christ to his Disciples, and
his purpose therein was not to teach what the state of the Church should
always be, but to provoke them to constancy and holiness, because they should
be in every man's eyes, and therefore if they chanced to do otherwise then
well, it could be concealed no more then the light of the Sun; now this is
nothing to the Churches visibility: If the Reader desire to see this argument
more fully answered and enlarged, let him read our clear and lilly White, in
his Way to the true Church, fol. 90 91. 92.

Ibid page 140. this is deleted, Matthew. 13. 47. The Kingdom of Heaven is like
unto a Net, etc.

The Papists hold, that the true Catholic Church is always visible and
Becanus undertakes to prove it from the Parable thus; Christ here compares his
Church to a net Obj.
cast into the sea which gathers of all sorts of fish some, now this cannot be
understood but of the visible Church, because the Protestants, who hold two
Churches, the one invisible the other visible, do thus distingush them; that
in the invisible are only those who are predestined unto salvation, but in
the other, namely, the visible, are good and bad mixed together; but in the
Church which our Savior speaks hereof, are good and bad commixed; and
therefore he speaks of the visible Church, yea and also of the true Church; and
therefore the true Church is visible.

First, it is false that the Protestants hold two distinct true Churches.

Secondly, Becanus fights with his own shadow, concluding nothing against us;
Answ. 1.
neither is this the Question betwixt us and them, Whether the true Church of
Christ be visible? but whether the Catholic church be visible or not? for we
distinguish that ratione praedecati, but this ratione subjecti; for this true
Church is partly visible, partly invisible and the Catholic church is visible
Quantum ad materiale, but invisible Quantum ad formale, that is, Quatenus est
Catholica.

Thirdly, that Church in which are good and bad mixed together, is not the
Catholic church, but a particular, because the Catholic church is an assembly
of men, called by an internal vocation, that is, a society or company which
consists only of those, who are both elected and called.

Ibidem page 275. this sentence is purged out, Matthew. 16, 18, 19. Upon this
rock, etc.

The Papists produce these words, super hanc Petram, upon this rock, etc. to
prove, Obj.
that the true church of Christ is always conspicuous and visible; arguing
thus; whether by this rock upon which Christ promises to build his church, we
understand Christ or Peter, or Peter's confession; yet always the foundation
is some sensible thing, and therefore the church is sensible; because although
now we neither see Peter nor Christ, his Lord, yet then (when Christ spoke
this) both of them were obvious to sight, and now they are seen in their Vicar
the Pope, Bellarmine de Eccles. Milit. lib. 3. ca. 11.

First the Cardinal changes his terms, for it is one thing to be sensible,
another Answ. 1.
to be visible: many things being sensible which are not visible, as sounds,
the wind and the like.

Secondly, the foundation of the church is Christ, and not Peter, and therefore
he begs the Question.

Thirdly, we deny the antecedent, and his probation proves it not, because
Christ as he was the foundation of the Church, was not visible; he not being
her foundation, as he was man, but as he was God and man; yea he is a Mediator
for those who believe on him, and not those who see him.

Fourthly, the Jesuit plays the Sophister, committing a fallacy Ab hemonyma
Ecclesia, the word church being ambiguous, signifying either a visible society
(and so it signifies not in this place) or else the universal and mystical
body of Christ, and so it is taken by our Savior here.

Ibidem in the written copy, page 87. this sentence is deleted: Touching the
visibility of the Church, I lay down these propositions. First, the inward
church of Christ is not to be called visible, because although their persons be
visible, yet so is not their conjunction with Christ their head, that being the
internal work of faith, which is not to be seen: Secondly, the complete and
most universal church (from Abel unto the worlds end) may respectively be
called visible, namely secundum parts, because although the whole never had
being in uno i^stanti, in one and the same moment of time, and therefore could
never be seen, uno i^^etu, by any one aspect or sight, yet the parts of it
(the church ^^^tent in every age) have been seen in their several times. And
in these two the Papists I hope will not descent: Thirdly, there shall be
always a true church, etc. not external and corporal: That the invisible
church of Christ is beautiful, appears by Saint Paul, who calls it pure,
without spot or wrinkle, Ephesians. 5. 27. and by the psalmist, The Kings daughter
is all glorious: and that this beauty is spiritual and internal, appears by
the same infallible authority, who calls her black and fair, cant. 1. 4. that
is, outwardly deformed, but amiable within; and again most plainly, she is
glorious, but within, psalm. 45. 13.

20. Passages deleted, That wicked men are no true members of the true Church
and mystical Body of Christ.
IN Master Wards Comentary upon (...), printed copy, fol. 20. this discourse
was purged out.

Fifthly, they object this place to prove that wicked men are true members of
the Obj.
church of Christ; arguing that; the church is compared to a b^rn-floore, where
there is both chafe and corn, therefore wicked men are members of Christ's
church.

I have upon Matthew. 3. 11. answered to the place objected, and also to the Answ.
scope and drift of the objection, by distinguishing between the internal and
invisible, external, and visible church; I now add a word or two thereunto by
a threefold distinction (viz.) first, we distinguish between the catholic
church, and a particular church: In the catholic church are only good men,
but in a particular national church are both good and bad: Secondly, we
di^^inguish between the systeme or whole body of the external and visible
church, and some few particular members thereof, because that does not always
agree to the whole church, which is usually ascribed to some particular
external members thereof, i. e. the professors of the common faith of the
church: Thirdly, we distinguish between the judgment of charity, and faith;
for charity (which is not suspetious, but believes all things, and hopes all
things) 1 cor. 13. 45. does often judge many hypocrties and external
professors to be the true members of Christ, and the sheep of his ^^ock; but
faith informed by the Word of God, know most certainly, that no hypocrite or
unbeleever, or wicked person (so long as they con-continue and remain such)
does belong unto the Essence or mystical body of Christ.

And in the written copy, fol. 317. on Matthew. 22. 1. this clause was deleated
by the Licencer.

Bellarmine (lib. 3. de Eccles. cap. 7.) objects this place to prove, that
wicked men belong unto the Catholic church, because the church here is
compared to a marriage Obj.
feast, wherein not all the guests are elected, or invested with the marriage
robe of Christ's righteousness, but some of them clothed in their rotten
rags, and polluted garments.

This and the like similitudes which are urged by Bellarmine in the place above
quoted, do not show the nature and essence^^ essential properties of the
catholic church Answ.
(which the adversary presupposes) but only some certain external accidents
thereof; and therefore they are referred to the external company of all those,
who by the preaching of the Gospel are in some sort called unto Christ, and in
some manner profess the faith of Christ; now nothing hinders, but that in such
a company there may be reprobates, who belong not at all unto the essence of
the true and internal church of Christ; and this and the other Parables which
Bellarmine produces makes nothing against us, for he should have poored, that
there are as well reprobates as elect vessels in the catholic church and for
the proof thereof alleges those places which speak not of the catholic and
invisible church, but of a particular and visible church, wherein we confess
there are both good and bad, yea for the most part, more bad then good, but
these bad ones belong not unto the catholic church, Alsteed. de natura Eccles.
cap. 6. fol. 130.

21. Passages deleted against building Churches East and West, and the
superstitious adorning of them with Images and such like popish Furniture.
MAster Ward, on Mat. page 342. It is controverted between us and the Papists
concerning the forms of churches; and Bellarmine affirms, that they should be
built east and west, that so when we pray therein, our faces might be turned
toward the east; and for the proof hereof he produces this place; Ab orient
venturus creditur ad judicium; Ergo: It is believed that Christ will come unto
judgment from the east, therefore we ought to pray toward the east.

First, creditur, it is believed (says he) namely, by those who can believe
what they list, though never so absurd.

Secondly, suppose the antecedent were true, yet the consequence halts; for
although Christ should come from the east to judgment, yet it would not follow
thence. that therefore we should pray toward the east; we must pray unto
Christ, who is every where in regard of his Deity, and (according to the
Papists) in regard of his humanity also, and therefore which way soever we
pray, we look toward him; yea, I imagine that Bellarmine would blush to
affirm, and be backward to undertake to prove, that Christ's seat and throne
of glory in Heaven is seated in the east end thereof, and that the humanity
never stirs or moves out of that seat and part of Heaven,; both which he must
prove before his argument be of any worth or weight.

Thirdly, the comparison (in these words) betwixt the coming of Christ and the
lightning, does not respect the place, but the clear and sudden apparition of
both, etc. All this is expunged.

In Doctor Featlye's Sermons, this passage is deleted, page 225. What mean our
adversaries then to spend so much in embellishing their churches, and so little
in beautifying their souls? to lay out so much cost upon the material, and so
little upon the spiritual Temple of God? Their rood-lofts they paint, their
pillars they engrave, their timber they carve, their Images they clothe, their
pictures they cover, their stone Altars they guild, their crosses they set
about with jewels and precious stones; they have golden Miters, golden Vessels,
golden shrines, golden bells, golden snuffers, all golden, save the ordinary
Priests: who, if Boniface of Mentz his observation be true, for the most part
are wooden or leaden.

Dicite Pontifices in sacro quid facit Aurum. Saint Ambrose taxing too much
superfluity in this kind, says expressly, That those things please not God in,
or with gold, which can be bought with no gold; if we speak of the true
adorning of the Church, it is not with the beauty of pictures, but with
holiness, not with the luster of pearls and precious stones, but the shining
of good works; not with candles and tapers, but with the light of the Word; not
with sweet perfumes, but with the savor of life unto life; neither will all
the glorious furniture of Solomon's Temple make any show for their excess in
this kind of their outward deckings; for that furniture was typical, then the
service of God was restrained to that Temple, and God himself gave them the
model thereof: Is it not preposterous for Christians to go about to enrich
the Gospel with the beggarly rudiments of the law? what folly is it after they
put out the light of the Word, or hide it, as it were, under a bushel in an
unknown tongue, to stick up wax lights at the noon day? to cloth pictures, and
to suffer the living members of Christ to go naked? to adorn the Images of
Saints, and to deface Gods Image in themselves? to perfume their Churches, and
breath out a noy some savor of impure brothels in their lives? etc.

22. Passages expunged against evangelicall Councels, tending unto Perfection,
Merit, Superogation, and against popish Vows.
IN Master Wards Comentary upon Matthew, written copy, page 105. this discourse
is purged out as heterodox.

He shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven.

The Papists generally urge this place for the establishing of their
Evangelicall councels Obj.
unto perfection.

But there are no such councels as these, which the Papists would establish
from this Answ.
place, to wit, first, Free, which may be done or not done, as we please, and
that without sin: secondly, councels unto perfection: and thirdly, unto
merit; the truth of this answer appears thus (viz.)

First, because this word Council, is taken for the fear of God, consilium
preservabit te, council shall preserve thee; read Proverbs 2. 11. and 8. 12,
13, 14. and 12. 15. and 19. 20. Hear council and receive instruction: and
secondly, because no good thing in it self is free, the Commandments of God
being the rule of good, and therefore whatsoever is simply good, is positively
commanded; and what is not included in the morrall law, is not in it self
good, but will worship: and thirdly, because every perfection of good is
prescribed and enjoined, be ye perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect,
Matthew. 5. 48. says Christ: Now although we can never attain unto this
perfection, yet we must endeavor thereunto: and fourthly, because we deserve
nothing at Gods hands, but only by the obedience of the Commandments, i. e;
if there be any merit, it is in the obedience of the law; if Adam had merited,
it had been by obeying that which was commanded, not that which was not
required; for when by such things we desire to please God, he will say, who
has required these things at your hands? Isa. 1. 12. and therefore little hope
can the Papists have to merit Heaven by their monastical vows, whether
general or particular.

First, they have general vows, namely, first, the vow of poverty, and yet
scarce any fair Mannours richer then their Monasteries; Secondly chastity,
which is like a painted Sepulcher, their Abbeys and Nunneries being Dens of
Sodomites: thirdly, obedience to humane traditions, rather then the
commandments of God, whence the rules of Saint Francis or Saint Dominick, or
lame Loyola, are more strictly observed then the rules of Christ or word of God.

Secondly, they have particular vows, as first, not to touch silver with their
hands, but yet they may receive it in their hoods; secondly, not to touch
flesh; thirdly, to wear hair shirts, and the like. If the learned Reader
desire further proof and information in this particular, I refer him to
Hospmian de Origin Monachorus: certainly these are no Evangelicall councels,
although they may truly be called Minima, things of the least moment or
importance, which perish in the using, affording neither comfort nor true
profit unto the user or observer of them, etc.

In the same Comentary on Matthew. 28. 20. written copy, page 405. the Licencer
has gelded out this discourse:

From these words (Teaching them to observe whatsoever I have commanded you) I
lay down this proposition, That there are no Evangelicall counsels of
perfection unto superogation: for the understanding of this, I thus explain
the particulars thereof (viz.)

First, consilium, or council, is either first, directionis, of direction: and
of this these speak not; or secondly, prescriptionis, of prescription, for the
preparing and informing of the soul, Revel. 3. 18. now this the position
understands, and it is twofold; namely, either first, this council of
prescription is given injunctorie, by way of injunction; and thus we grant that
there are Evangelicall councels: or secondly, these councels are given
arbitrarie, arbitrarily, i. e. if we will do them, we may, if we will not we
may choose, and that without sin: now these the position speaks, denying that
there are my such.

Secondly, Evangelium, Gospel, is taken two manner of ways, namely, either
first for holy History; and thus Gospel is not here meant: or secondly, for
the doctrine of Christ; and thus it is taken in our Thesis: thirdly perfection,
perfection is two fold; namely, either first, infinite in God; or secondly,
finite; and this is either first, Patriae of glory, and of our country; which
perfection the Angels and Saints have in Heaven; or secondly, via, of grace, or
of the way; and this is the perfection the Saints have on earth, and it is a
perfection either first, partium, of parts and kinds; or secondly, graduum, of
degrees; and this is either first, accidental, which consists in removing of
obstacles and lets, and this we grant: or secondly, essential; and this
perfection is either first, necessary unto salvation, which is a full
observation of the moral law, either by our selves or by another; or secondly
profitable, which is not simply necessary unto salvation, but only necessary
for the obtaining of a more excellent degree of glory: now this perfection the
Papists understand in their Evangelicall councels unto perfection, and this
perfection in our position we utterly deny.

Fourthly supererogation, supererogation is two fold, to wit, either first,
gradualis, when we perform the precepts of the law in a higher measure and
degree then the law requires, and thus our Rhemists understand the word, 1 cor.
9. 16. or secondly, qualificalis, when we do other good works besides those
which are commanded in the law; and thus Bellarmine understands the word, who
further also says, first, that these works of supererogation, do merit a
greater degree of glory; and also secondly, that they are communicable even
unto others, i. e. that both, first, they satisfy for the sins of others;
and also secondly, help to supply the defects and wants of others, Remist.
Test. 2 cor. 8. 14.

Quest. Wherein do we and the Papists agree, and wherein do we differ in this
point of councels of perfection unto supererogation?

Answ. first, we agree in this, that good things are either first, absolutely
good, and these are commanded; or secondly, respectively good, in regard of
some circumstances, and thus Saint Paul gives council concerning marriage in
the times and places of persecution, 1 cor. 7.

Secondly, we differ in three things: first Re, in the thing it self; for
first, Papists say that councels are better then commands, and that a man shall
obtain a higher state and a greater measure of glory in Heaven by the
obedience of councels, then by the obedience of precepts: secondly, we say that
councels are inferior to commands, and differ from them, not in obligation,
but in the object; because first, commandments are concerning things
absolutely good; but secondly, councels are of things respectively good; which
when they are good cannot be omitted without fault.

Secondly, we and the Papists differ forma, in the form of these Evangelicall
councels; for they say they are arbitrary; but we say they are enjoined: and
thirdly, we and they differ fine, in the very end of them; for first, the
Papists hold, that first, the works of councels merit a singular glory and a
greater degree thereof; and secondly, that they satisfy for the temporal
punishment of sin: secondly we hold neither of these, but only that they are
enjoined as the works of our office and duty, whenever the circumstances do
concur, etc.

Ibidem written copy, page 139. this is deleted, swear not at all: Obj. Sextus
Senensis; and some other Papists say, that Christ here sets down a council of
perfection; not forbidding all swearing but rather wishing that men could so
live in faith, love and truth, that there might be no use of an oath. Answ.
first, this is false, because Christ's words are not perswasory, but
prohibitory, expressly forbidding swearing.

23. Passages expunged against Popish evil Councillors, and the vices of
Princes Courts.
IN Master Wards Comentary upon Matthew, page 78, written copy, these clauses
are deleted.

A fool (faith Solomon) breeds farres among friends, but a Man of wisdom
appea seth strife: The first we see verified in Rehoboams young Councillors,
who made a breach and irreconcilable rent between the King and his people, 1
King. 12. and the second in good Abigail, 1 Samuel 25. 18. and in the woman of
Tekoah, 2 Samuel 14. Sowers of discord are found in the Church or in the
Kingdom; in Kingdoms, viz. First, those that long for nothing but war,
blaming a peaceable government and quiet State, and are never well but whiles
they are fishing in troubled waters: Secondly, those that instigate others to
war, as the Cardinals and Jesuits upon every occasion do whisper in the
eats of Princes to make war upon their neighbors, when they perceive any
advantage may be had thereby: Thirdly, those that make themselves mercenary for
the nourishing of slaughters.

Ibidem on Mat. 11. 7. 8. ^. this whole discourse is expunged. What went you
out to see? etc. as these words, what went you out to see, a reed shaken with
the wind? may be referred (by way of reproof) unto the people; so also these,
they that wear soft clothing are in Kings houses; does our Savior then simply
tax the pomp and glory of Princes Courts?

First, certainly there is pomp and cost, and bravery in Princes Courts, which
is not unlawful: and that both because it serves to the beauty, glory, and
ornament of the place, and also because the vulgar sort are kept thereby the
better in obedience and fear: Secondly, yet our Savior seems ex consequenti,
to reprove and condemn the life of Courtiers, or the court-life; went you out
to see a man clothed in soft raiment? behold they that wear soft clothing are
in Kings houses: as if he would say, a religious life and a court-life are not
alike, for although the pomp, bravery and delights of Kings Courts be not
immediately evil in themselves, yet they less suit and agree with Religion:
Whence we may note,

That a soft, dainty, delicate and court-like life, hinders many from true
Religion, or from being truly religious; it being the nature of pleasure, to
draw the mind along with it.

What things are ordinary in a court-life?

In Kings Courts these vices are most frequent and familiar; namely, first
pride; it is ordinary with Courtiers to look high, to despise others, to
over-prize themselves and with Simon Magus to think themselves some great ones,
Acts 8. 2. Now Religion teaches men to be humble and lowly, and to give place
one unto another, and to strive one to come after another; and not as many
Courtiers frequently do, who strive, quarrel, justle and fight about the walls
and precedence, Romans 12. 10. 46. Secondly avarice, for they which have many
things, want many; and they who spend much, want much; and according to the
Proverb, rob Peter to pay Paul, i. e. extort from others to expend upon
themselves: Now Religion teaches men to give alms, and to be liberal; but
Kings Courts (although they teach not, yet at least) practice rapire,
oppression and griping of those under them: Thirdly, pleasure and delight; as
we see in Dives, Luke 16. and hence men become more effeminate, unconstant and
unable to suffer any afflictions, injuries, wrongs, or the like; whereas
Religion teaches men to suffer, and to want, and to be content in all estates,
Phil. 1. 27. 29. and 4. 10. James 4. 7. etc. yea, the court-life being full of
pomp and pleasure, makes men more unable to resist or withstand the temptations
of Satan, the allurement of the world, or the suggestions of their own corrupt
nature, and more prove and ready to yield unto them: Christ the second Adam was
tempted in the Wilderness but could not be conquered; but the first being
assaulted in Paradise (a place of pleasure) was easily overcome: Fourthly
idleness; Courtiers (for the most part) are given to eating drinking, sleeping
and gaming, yea like the Israelites, spend the most part of their lives in
these, Exodus 32. 6. but Religion teaches us to labor and take pains, yea to
earne our bread with the sweat of our brows, Genesis 3. and how can he labor in
Religion who will not labor nor take pains in some worldly employment:
Fifthly flattery; Aio, Aio, Courtiers can fawn and sooth yea jurare in verba
Magistri, swear what their Lords say: Now Religion ^acheth men to be
courageous and bold, yea not to flatter, but rather to reprove offenders to
their face; as Christ says, go and tell Herod that Fox, and John boldly
reproved him; for Herodias his brothers wife, and the King being angry with him
for this, and casting him into prison, yea afterward beheading him, the
Courtiers willingly permitting it.

Who are here to be blamed?

Those who are deceived with the delights of a court-life, for it is not what
it seems to be, but rather is like to a painted reed, or a beautiful
rainbow, as appears thus; First, court-favour and felicity last not long,
for it is as slippery as an Ele, as fading as a flower, as brittle as glass,
and like grass upon the house top, which quickly withers. Secondly,
court-felicity and delights are evil, corrupting the manners; for first, some
observe, that there are but few truly good in Kings Courts: and secondly, if
they be good at first, yet at last they are corrupted, as we see in Tyberius,
Cal-gula, Commodus: Aula vel malos invenit, vel facit, the Court finds some
bad, and so leaves them; the Court finds some good, but makes them bad; and
therefore who would praise that barn or field that changes the wheat into
tares? or that cask that changes the Wine into vinegar? or that vessel which
changes the Oil into Lees? Secondly, they are to blame who delight in proud
apparel and fantastical fashions; for first, it was never a thing of any good
report in Solomon, gorgeous attire is not reproved, but yet we see that his
bravery, prosperity and court-delights did so eneruate and weaken his mind and
cause him so far to decline, that many have questioned, whether ever he were
renewed by repentance or not: Secondly, proud and gorgeous attire is always
taxed and blamed in Scripture, read Isa. 3. and 1 Timothy 2. 9. and 1 Pet. 3. 3.
Yea thirdly, the bravery and fashions of the Court are noxious and hurtful
unto the Country, who is too ready to imitate it herein: And fourthly, it is a
foolish thing for a man to seek praise by his apparel, he being in his
richest robes, no better then the Crow, who braved it in borrowed plumes; yea,
it is a wicked thing for a man to glory or be proud of his shame, as all those
do who are proud of their apparel, it being but a covering of their shame,
which veil they had never used nor needed if they had not sinned. Thirdly,
they are here faulty who accustom themselves to worldly pleasures, pastimes,
and delights, as Dives did, Luke 16. for this is a strong cord of vanity, Isa.
5. 18. and many have been ensnared with lawful things, whom the devil could
never captivate or draw unto gross and enormious sins, etc.

In Doctor Clarks Sermons, page 403. this clause is deleted: Their Council
will not inform Kings, for Kings have their Confessors they will say, that
office fitteth them; the Courtiers dare not, it may prejudice their preferment:
Nay Courtiers are rather corrupters of Kings, they make the King a Saint, an
Angel, a God; these flatterers Constantine calls sorices Palatij, the vermin
of the Court: and what is adulatio but adaulatio, says the Etymologist, to be
a flatterer, that is, to be a Courtier, etc.

24. Passages deleted, That all things are decreed, and nothing uncertain to
God.
IN M. Wards Comentary on Matthew. p. 10. writ. cop. this is deleted: Obj. Gods
decrees are sure, therefore all means are vain. Ans. 1. If we must never use
the means but in those things where there is no decree, then we must never use
the means at all, for all things are decreed, and there is nothing uncertain
unto God.

25. Passages deleted concerning Election, that it is not of foreseen works or
faith, but only from Gods free grace: That there is no Universal Election,
etc.
IN Doctor Clarks seventh Sermon, page 63. after these words, But of Gods
vouchsafeing, the Licenser has expunged these words following: Not ex
praevisione, but ex dilectione; not by foreseeing ought in us, but by
foreknowing us in Christ; peace here again proud Papist, and thrust not upon
God thy works to obtain this peace; it is sent to men of good will, not of
good works, this peace, etc.

A whole Sermon of his touching election of free grace, not of works or
foreseen faith, on Romans 9. was rejected by the Licenser, and not suffered to be
printed with his other Sermons.

In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, 25. 14, 15. printed book, fol. 326. this
passage is deleted by the Licenser.

Bellarmine objects this place to prove, that Election or Predestination unto
life eternal Obs.
is from a foresight of good works, because the Text says, That the Lord gave
unicuique secundum propriam virtutem five facultatem, to every one according to
his own ability.

First, this place proves not the point, for these talents which are given to
every one (...), according to his own ability, do not signify life eternal:
Answ.
and the reasons hereof are plain, namely; first, because these talents were
distributed and communicated to all the servants, both to good and bad,
profitable and unprofitable, which cannot be affirmed of life eternal:
Secondly, because these servants were to give an account of these talents
disbursed unto them, which cannot (without great absurdity) be affirmed of life
eternal: Thirdly, because a reward was given to these servants who had well
employed their talents after their rendering an account of the employment
thereof; but no reward is to be hoped for or expected after life eternal: and
therefore this place proves nothing for salvation from a foresight of works,
etc.

Secondly, Maldonate thinks these words (according to every man's ability) to be
added only for the making up and perfecting of the Parable, not having any
signification in the Parable, nor any thing intended thereby; now if Maldodates
exposition of this place be true, then Bellarmines argument is falsely founded
hereupon.

Thirdly, by Talents temporal graces may be meant, which God communicates both
to good and bad, wicked and righteous; and thus not only Saint Paul had an
external vocation unto the faith, but also Simon Magus; not only Peter was
called to the Apostleship, but also Judas Iscariot; and hence Fricius expounds
this place, Haec Parabola de Talent is docet, dona mortalibus a Deo concessa,
etc. i. e. This Parable teaches us, that the gifts which are given by God unto
men, if they be be carefully employed and exercised, then they will increase
and be confirmed in them, but if they be neglected, they will be lost and
utterly extirpated: whence Saint Paul exhorts Timothy, to stir up and
exercise the gifts of God in him; and therefore from hence, salvation from a
forefihgt of works cannot be proved.

Fourthly, Janesenius by these Talents understands those gifts, which are
called gratiae gratis datae and not those which are called gratiae gratum
facientes: and therefore (if he say true) Bellarmines argument is grounded upon
a false foundation.

Fifthly; Ferus expounds these words thus, Unicuique secundam propriam
virtutem, neque enim omnia omnibus convenient, etc. to every one according to
his proper faculty, because all things are not fit for all men; the body has
many members, and every member his several office; now if all were an eye,
then where should the hand or the foot be? thus he; and his meaning is, that
God distributes not his Talents, i. e. spiritual gifts to all in the same
measure, but in a diverse and different, according to their faculty and ability,
which is diverse, and not in all the same; neither is this faculty or ability
from those in whom it is, but from him who distributes the Talents unto them,
and therefore nothing can be concluded from hence for a foresight of works: If
any Reader would see a more full exposition of this verse, then let him read
Doctor Mayer who is large upon it, page 291. 292. 293. if he would see a more
full answer to the Objection, then I refer him to Doctor Sharp, Curs.
Theolog. de Praedest. page 28. obj. 15.

Ibidem written copy. fol. 354. on Matthew. 25. 34. this clause is expunged:
Bellarmine Obj.
objects this place to prove, that both election and reprobation is from a
foresight of works; arguing thus; God at the day of judgment will no otherwise
determine of those things which then shall be, then as he ha^ decreed from all
eternity because his decree is immutable, James 1. 17. Isa. 43. 13. and 46. 10.
But at the last judgment, in the execution of Gods decree, he will say, come
ye faithful: Therefore from eternity God has decreed, i. e. elected and
reprobated for these things.

First, the proposition is true concerning the matter and subject of Gods
decree, because Answ.
the decree is immutable, but not concerning the form, because there was one
form of the decree, and there shall be another of the execution thereof.

Secondly, if the meaning of the proposition be, that God will change nothing
in the decree, but as he has decreed all and every thing, so according to that
decree shall the execution of every thing be; then the proposition is true, but
so understood the argument concludes nothing (viz. against us) this only
thence following; therefore as he has decreed from all eternity to save for
faith, and to damn for unbelief, so shall the execution of the decree be;
which is true, but concerns not the Question in controversy.

Thirdly, is follows not, Christ will say, come ye faithful, etc. come for
faiths sake as for the meritorious or impulsive cause: for faith is the only
isntrumental cause and he intimates the impulsive cause, when he says
Benedictos patris, ye blessed of my Father; where is shown, that their
salvation did proceed from the free savor of God, because God the Father of
his free grace has loved them in Christ.

Fourthly, if the Kingdom of God be an inheritance, then it comes or falls unto
us, because we are the sons of God by a free adoption: But it is called an
inheritance, for he says here, Hereditatis jure possidete, possess this
Kingdom by right of inheritence: Therefore it falls not unto us for our works
sake, but because we are the adopted children of God in Christ.

Ibid page 358. on Matthew. 25. 39. this sentence is purged out: It is questioned
between Quest.
us and the Papists, whether election or predestination on to life eternal be
from Gods free grace, or a foresight of man's good works and faith?

First, it is agreed upon betwixt us and them, that there are some elected and
predestined, Answ.
and this is clear from Mat. 20. 16. and 22. 14. and 24. 31. Romans 8. 30.
Ephesians. 1. 4.

And Secondly, it is agreed betwixt us also, that those who are elected and
predestined, are elected to an eternal Kingdom, as is plain from Luke 12.
32. And

Thirdly, it is agreed upon betwixt us, that those who are elected unto life
eternal shall infallibly and certainly be saved, and this is proved from Mat.
24. 22. 24. John 6. 29. and 10. 21. Romans 8. 24. and 11. 29. This was assented
unto by the best esteemed Divines in the Council of Trent, and thought to be
catholic, because it was consonant to the opinion both of Thomas, Scotus, and
the most School-writers, and also to the doctrine of Saint Paul, and Catharinus
himself could not deny it; read the History of the Council of Trent, lib. 2.
page 211. 212. Yea, Bellarmine himself does affirm as much plainly, De great.
and lib. arbit. lib. 2. cap. 10. which is worth observing because elsewhere he
contradicts himself, teaching, that the elect may fall from faith and
salvation, and utterly and eternally lose both.

Fourthly, the Papists affirm, that faith and works foreseen were the
impulsive and moving cause of the decree of election unto life everlasting.

Fifthly, we say, that the impulsive, and moving cause of the decree of
election is only the (...) and good will, and free grace of God, and this we
confirm from these places, Luke 12. 32. John 15. 16. Romans 11. 5. Ephesians. 1. 6,
etc.

Ibid. page 305. on Matthew. 20. 8. Every man received a penny, etc.

The Rhemists (upon Romans 9. 2.) allege these words to prove, That
Predestination and Election is from a foresight of works; they argue thus; the
Master says, call the laborers Obj.
and give them their reward; therefore God from all eternity has ordained, to
give the kingdom of Heaven to those whom he foresaw should bring forth good
fruits and works.

First, our Rhemists do not prove the position controverted between us and
them; for the Question is not, Whether God have ordained to give Heaven to
those whom he foresaw should bring forth good works? for this we doubt not of,
because the Scripture Answ.
plainly declares it, Romans 2. 6. 10. and 1 Cor. 2. 9, 10. but the Question is
this, Whether this foresight of good works were the cause of predestination
and election? for this we deny, and this if they would do any thing they
should prove.

Secondly, this place speaks not of predestination, but of the execution of
predestination: Now it follows not, works go before the execution of
predestination, therefore before predestination it self: Now that our Savior
speaks here of the execution of predestination, is plain from the very words:
for first, it is said, that some of the Laborers were hired in the morning,
and some at other hours; and then afterward, when it was night, the Lord of
the Vineyard said to his Steward, Call the Workmen: Now this can no way be
understood of predestination, which was long before the first hour of the day.

Thirdly, this place shows, that good works are the way to Heaven, wherein
we must walk; but not that the decree of life has respect to good works, for
good works go before the possession of Heaven, but not before the decree and
ordination.

Fourthly, Saint Ambrose out of this place frames a strong contrary argument,
proving thereby, that election is altogether of grace, without any respect to
works, see before 2 Answ. to Obj. 1. fol. 258. a. the last line, etc.

Ibidem page 302. this is deleted: Fourthly, the Papists are faulty here, who
affirm that the decree of salvation came from the foresight of works, and so
they make them primus Motor.

Ibidem in the written copy, fol. 245. Although we know not the reason why the
Lord does it: but more particularly, first, we must acknowledge the Lord to be
just in the election of the godly; now the order of election is laid down,
Romans 8. 29, 30. and Ephesians. 1. 11. from whence and some other places, the order
may be expressed thus, to wit, First, God decreed to make Christ the head of
his Church, Ephesians. 1. 22. then secondly, he ordained and decreed that there
should be a Church; and here, first, he decreed to create man; secondly, to
permit him to fall; and thirdly, to repair and recover some from their fall;
and fourthly, to endow them with grace and saving faith. Secondly, we must
acknowledge the Lord to be just in the reprobation of the wicked. Because the
dissension of Divines is great in this point, I will speak sparingly thereof,
and only lay down the order of it, as I conceive it to be, and so leave it.
First, God decreed to create man; and secondly, God foresaw that although man
were created pure and immaculate, yet if he were left unto himself, he would
fall; and thirdly, God leaves man unto himself, and permits him to fall; and
fourthly, determines to offer the means of rising again, namely, Christ, and
mercy in him, which he foresaw would be flighted, and by many not received;
then fifthly, for this contempt he justly reprobates them.

Ibidem fol. 319. 320. on Matthew. 22. 14. It is affirmed by some, that there is
a universal election, against which we urge this plain place; Many are
called, but few chosen; which place shows, that although the external means
of salvation be offered to many, yet not all of them, but some only are
elected and chosen unto life.

Huberus hereunto answers, that there is, first, a general election, which is
of all who are called to the Kingdom of God, and outwardly profess obedience;
and secondly, there is a special election, which is of those who obey their
calling, and indeed persevere and continue in the faith unto the end; his
meaning is, that few are elected, not in respect of any election and separation
made in the counsel and decree of God, but because some amongst many persevere
to the end.

First, there can be no such general election, for what choice is there when
all indifferently are received? An election therefore implies a receiving of
some, and a refusing of others: all therefore cannot be elected: Secondly, this
were to confound vocation and election, and to contradict Christ, many are
called but not many are chosen: to say therefore that all or many are chosen,
when Christ saigh, that but some, yea few only are chosen, were to contradict
his words: Thirdly, if the special election depend upon man's perseverance and
continuance, and not this, rather upon thee (that if some are said to be
elected, because they persevere, and not rather to persevere because they are
elected) then are men the cause of their own election, and they choose God
first: but this is contrary to the Scriptures, Mat. 20, 15. and i Cor. 4. 7.
and 1 John 4. 20. the election therefore, of none depends upon their own
will, but upon the good will and pleasure of God, etc.

And printed book, fol. 129. written copy, fol, 49. 50. this is rased out:

Quest. 2. Whose sins does Christ cure?

Answ. The sins of all men who are elected: for if any of them sin, Christ
will mediate for them, 1 John 2. 1, 2. because he dyed for their sins and
sakes, 2 Cor. 5. 15. (here note that in the two following Questions which are
let stand, the word Elect is four times obliterated.) Answ. It appears that
Christ purges the elect from all sin, because he does nothing imperfectly;
fruits of holiness are to be added, out non Agunt, they are not Agents; Christ
only working both the will and the deed, Phili 2. 12. etc.

26. Passages against Equivocation and Popish Writers, expunged.
IN Doctor Clarks tenth Sermon, page 396. the Licenser has deleted these lines
the Authors conclusion of his Sermon: Man strives to give God gifts, many a
man, especially the man of sin: not the Pope only, but of the Popes many;
many an one labors too be liberal, builds Abbeys, Churches, Hospitals, sicut
delictum, ita donum. gives bountifully, profusely to satisfy for sin; Quis
ista? Who has required these things at their hands? give God what God asks: He
asks not thy goods, not thy lands, but thy heart; he cares not for sacrifice;
the Psalmist says, not thousands of Rams, not ten thousand Rivers of Oil;
it is the sacrifice of prayer; the spiritual sacrifice of prayer that pleases
him; Hosea bids offer him the Calves of our lips, that it, prayer and
thanksgiving, and yet he cares not for them neither, unless the fire that must
make them a burnt-offering be kindled from the heart.

To end this, it is a marvel if the false equivocating Papist takes no hold of
this Text, to patronize his perjury; for what is the meaning of his mental
reservation, but da mihi cor, only to reserve his heart unto God; be it never
so false, he swears it is but juravi lingua, he has sinned but with his
tongue, but lapsus lingue, his heart assented not unto the lie; God craves the
heart here, not the tongue; God has his heart, it is well: but I fear he
equivocates here too, means his Lord God the Pope; else cozening the
Magistrate who executes Gods judgment, and sits upon Gods Throne, and gives
him Gods Oath, he but cozens God too; Saint Peter tells him that his Lord Gods
predecessors, Acts 5. 4. non hominibus sed Deo, he has not lied unto men, but
unto God, and so consequently has given his heart not unto God, but unto the
Devil, etc.

27. Passages expunged against laboring to increase Faith.
IN Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, written copy, page 475. this clause is
deleated.

Quest. 3. We should labor for faith and increase thereof; faith is our feale
and spiritual Unction, whereby we are assured of pardon, reconciliation,
adoption, justification (and after death) of glorification, 1 cor. 1. 21. Now a
weak faith cannot assure us of these; wherefore if we desire to be certain of
them, we must labor to grow up and increase in faith. The next words after
Quest. 3. who are blameworthy in this particular? Answ. two sorts of people;
namely, first, those who neglect faith, and secondly, the Papists, with other
large sentences to this effect are obliterated.

28. Passages deleted against popish Fasting.
IN Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, written copy, page 289. this clause was
obliterated.

Let us avoid all popish errors: Thirdly, they promise also, who bind
themselves by a vow, not to eat flesh upon some certain days, and upon such
days have no other ^are then to abstain from flesh only.

29. Passages purged out against carnal and unchristian Fears and Popish
Contrition.
IN Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, page 203. in the written copy, the
Licenser has expunged this discourse: What must we not fear? The things in
general which the child of God should not fear are many; but the principle
are these three; viz. First, he must not fear great dangers, yea the loss of
his life: Secondly, he must not fear the loss of his riches, wealth or
profit: Thirdly, he must not fear the favor of men, or the loss of the
favor of men, Isa. 5. 7. Ier. 8. 17. How may we be secure in dangers and evil
if we must not fear them? First, if we desire to be secure from evils, then
negatively we must not rashly run into any; either first, by an insensibility
of danger, as Ephesians. 5. 14. when men sleep in sin, and are altogether
insensible of the danger they are in by reason of their sins; or secondly, by
presumption, when a man makes a covenant with death, and is at an agreement
with hell, Isa. 28. 14. Romans 11. 20. or thirdly, by carnal security, when men
think that though they sin, yet they shall be safe and saved, as Romans 6. 1.
15. Prove. 20. 14. Secondly, the particular and affirmative means to be freed
from all evils are these; namely, first, faith and an internal and spiritual
covenant with God; for unto such as believe in God, and have made a covenant
with him, many gracious promises are made in the Word, of help and succor; and
secondly, piety and a holy life, Isa. 44. 2. and 51. 7. and thirdly, Hope fixed
and built upon the promises of the Word. Josh. 1. 5. and Heb. 13. 5. and
fourthly, a remembrance of the Lords assistance and succor, either toward our
selves in former times, or toward some other, as Deuteronomy. 7. 18. and fifthly,
prayer unto God for help and aid, as Jacob did; Genesis 32. 9, etc. and Dan. 6.
10. and the Apostles Acts 4. 14. etc. Wherefore if we desire to be preserved
from all danger and evil, we must enter into a new covenant with the Lord our
God, and believe in him: we must labor that our lives may be holy, pure and
(...), and then hope confidently upon the promises which God has made to such;
we must remember the many examples we have of Gods gracious assistance toward
many in his Word: And lastly we must pray that if we be free from corporal
evils, the Lord would be pleased still to preserve a^, and if any evil lie
upon us, that he would deliver us.

So on Matthew 25. 25. page 331. this clause is purged out: The Papists say
that there is a contrition which arises simply and only from the fear of
punishment, which is good; and we say, that the fear of punishment at first is
profitable, but after the love of God is entered into the soul, all fear of
hell and damnation, which breeds terrors and affrights of conscience is
expelled by love; this we confirm from this place thus, The slothful servant
says to his Master, I knew that thou wast an hard man, etc. and therefore I
was afraid: Now this servant was not commended for this fear, but blamed and
reproved, and cast into utter darkness; for his Master says, thou evil and
slothful servant: and Origin hereof writes well, non est honus hujusmodi
timor, etc. Neither is the fear good, neither does it deliver from outward
darkness, Origin tract. 33. in Matthew. Bellarmine replieth hereunto, that to
fear God cannot be evil; but they who have this servile fear, do
notwithstanding fear God: Ergo. Bellar. de poeuit. lib. 2. cap. 28. First, the
devil fears God and trembles, James 2. 12. and yet the Jesuit would blush to
say, that there is any good fear in Devils; Secondly, it is false that such as
those fear God, for they fear not him but hell; and if there were no hell
they would not fear him at all.

30. Passages deleted against Free Will, Resisting grace, etc.
IN Doctor Featlyes Clavis Mystica, page 604. Doctor Bray deleted these
clauses: Postremum genus little est, qui oves Christi pascunt, sed cibo
insalubri, quo magis inficiuntur, quam reficiuntur Christi oves agnique; little
dico, qui floribus and fructibus Paradisi aut noxias herb as admiscent, aut
flores Adonidis aspergunt; cujusmodi sunt is it a dogmata, Vires liberi arbitrij
ab Adami lapsu ad bonum spirituale fract as and debilitat as, non penitus
profligat as and amissas, etc. And page 894. I told you before, that this was a
wet step, and many have here slipped; for some odiously object, that unlesle we
will grant universal grace, and a power in the will of man to resist and
frustrate the work of the Spirit in our conversion, and that unless these
Jews had sufficient grace offered them to repent them of their sins and
thereby prevent this their final overthrow, the prediction of our Savior was
to no end and purpose; nay, that his tears over Jerusalem might seem like to
those which Julius Caesar shed for Pompey's death, who yet himself procured
it, or might have hindered it if he would; did not Christ (say they) foresee and
decree the destruction of Jerusalem? how then does he bemoane it with tears?
etc.

Master Ward part 2. page 4. Quest. 2. Why do so few (if those many who are
called unto the profession of Christ) persevere unto the end? Answ. Because the
gift of perseverance is great, and but given to a few; I say great, because it
is greater then the gift of free will (August. Corrupt and great. 13.) for
first, this was given unto Adam at the first, but not that Adam in his framing
being endued with freewill, which he lost by his fall but not with
perseverance, for then he could not have fallen. Here there is indeed pride in
Religion, when God must be content either to accept of will worship, and a
free will offering, or else he shall have nothing, etc.

31. A Clause expunged against Flagellant Friars.
IN Doctor Clarks Sermons, page 148. After these words, both sacrifice and
Priest, this is expunged, To this end, I think the Friars Flagellant never read
this Text, why whip they else themselves, but to heal themselves by their own
blood; happily they will not be beholding unto Christ, they will be healed by
stripes, but not by his. Thus much for the Phisician, etc.

32. That God is not the Author of sin, deleted.
IN Doctor Claks Sermons, page 132. after these words, Gods own works, the
Licenser has expunged these lines following; Melanchton says (Papists, say he
says it) and it is sin, then God must cry peccavi too; for that they infer
that we make God anther of sin; strange they should study school divinity so
much, as not be able to distinguish between the Action, and the privity of the
Action, between Actus and defectus, the Act and deformity: I presume they will
not learn of us, we Calvinists are asses, they have all the learning; let
Snarez teach them, a Jesuit, that God does operari Actum peceati, but not
malitiam; the Act of Judas his delivery of Christ, that was of God; but the
wickedness of his heart in delivering him, that was of Satan and himself: God
is Author operis, but not sceleris; Zuinglius, distinction, the operation,
God's; the aberration ours.

33. Clauses deleted and altered against Universal grace, Universal
Redemption and Election, and resisting Grace.
IN Doctor Clarks second Sermon of the Nativity, page 6. after half of one
world, instead of this parenthesis (for the Elect are few compared with the
Reprobate) the Licenser has put in the parenthesis (nay not half, for how
small an handful is man compared with other creatures?) etc.

Ibidem page 17. after to men only, instead of these words, but not all, the
Licenser has altered the Authors mind, and made him to say, to men only, and
to all; then should follow this excellent passage which the Licenser has
expunged: Pelagius the old Heretic, and all that are Minions to Pelagius, hold
Christ was both natus and datus both borne, slame and suffered for all men,
even for the reprobate, a reprobate, heresy; Paul's place seems pat for them,
1 Timothy 4. 10. God's said to be the Savior of all men, not of believers only:
but all orthodox expositors conster a Savior there, to mean but a preserver:
No it is Christ there that is called so, but Gods preserving providence looks
indifferently ^^ all: And Saint Ambrose expounds it of Gods gracious goodness
not of his saving health,: God is good to all his creatures: will Grand a petty
Papist he so senseless as to say, Christ is the Savior of the bruit
creatures? yet David says in the Psalms, that the Lord saves both man and
beast; first, preserves them; but the main pillar of this Papist paradox is
another place of Paul's, who will have Pantas Authopus All men to be saved, 1 Timothy 2. That Is their Acchibilleom, they sayunan swerable; but there is no point
of popery more curiously and soundly answered then that; yet to man's comfort,
and Gods glory: we say too in some sense, that the Nobis here means emnibus,
the child was borne for all men: but then we mean all men, as the school it
self distinguishes, not fingulos genetum, but genera singulorum, not every
several man, but some of every sort, etc.

Ibidem page 17. in stead of, to some of all Nations, the Licenser says,
admini^um to men of all Nations, etc.

Ibidem page 69. l. 1. after these words, but to men of grace, the Licenser
has blotted out as follows: Nor let the Lutheran hold universal grace, this
phrase confounds him too: As fides is not omnium, all men have not faith, so
all men have not peace, God sends it only unto men, benae voluncotis, such
as he specially has called out in Christ; peace is confirmed to faith; many
other graces are conferred on all promiscuously, but peace, Gods pardon is but
sent to some; they are believers: Gods reconciliation is their appropriation,
whom God has vouchsafe to be men of his good will. This subject I have handled
sometime heretofore; to conclude it and my Text. God does not prostitute his
peace to all, as the Harlot does her body, who (as the Prophet speaks) opens
her feet to every stranger: Peace it a saving grace, and therefore sent only
to them that shall be saved; salvation is proper to the elect alone, and God
elected none but whom he loved; Gods love and his good will I cannot sever
them, for himself couples them, Matthew. 3. This is my beloved Son in whom I
am well pleased, etc.

Ibid. page 91. l. 6. after these words, no man damned, the Licenser has
expunged these following words: Not all, that is, every; it is not singulis,
but omnibus not every several person, but all sorts of men, the term so taken
in many other Texts; too tedious to cite: grace has decreed salvation to all
men, that is, as Divines do commonly distinguish, not singulis generum, but
generibus singulorum, not to all persons, but to all kinds; the term is to be
taken, not individuatly, but generally; these words, but to all men, the
Licenser added, etc.

In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, chap. 20. v. 11. They murmured against
the good man of the house: this sentence is expunged.

Quest. To whom may these words be fitly applied, or who are like to these
murmurers?

Answ. It may aptly be applied to those who accuse the election and reprobation
of God, of injustice, because he gives unequal rewards to equal deservers:
they argue thus; he who gives aqual^bus inaqualia, unequal rewards to equal
deservers, is unjust; but if all men be equal and alike in Adam, and yet of
them God chooses some, and refuses others, he thereby gives unequal rewards
to equal deservers; and therefore in so doing is unjust: But the Major
proposition here is true only of him who gives unequal rewards to equal
deservers of debt, or contrary to his bargain; and therefore it is most false
of God, who gives nothing either of debtor against his covenant; we must not
say that God is unjust; because he gives freely unto some, riches, honor,
power, health, learning, wisdom, and the like, and not unto others, or because
he pittieth some and passes by others, seeing that he is debtor to none: ye^
from this Parable it may evidently be proved, that although the Lordelect some
unto life, and not others; yet he is injurious unto none: for first, he is not
bound to elect any, and secondly, unto those whom he does elect, he does more
then he needs, or, is bound to do; and thirdly, because he gives election
and life eternal to whom he will; and fourthly, because he is the absolute
Lord over all creatures, and therefore he may dispose of men as he pleases;
and fifthly, because those who jarre at the Lords bounty and mercy, show
themselves to be envious, and are indeed injurious both against God and their
neighbors, Parens s. fol. 797. a. etc.

Ibidem on Matthew. 25. 24. page 331. To him that has shall be given: this
clause is purged out; Some object these words to prove, that God will give
greater grace unto him, or bestow greater upon him who has well used the light
of nature. Answ. By these Talents, are here understood the gifts of God, and
especially the knowledge of God by the Gospel; which knowledge he is said to
hide, who does detain the truth in unrighteousness, and does keep in the
known truth: that Talent therefore cannot be that sufficient grace which they
say does happen to Insidels and unregenerate persons, but that grace which God
does bestow upon his domestical servants: neither by him that has, is
understood a man in his mere naturals, or some heathen man furnished with
sufficient grace, but a man furnished with the knowledge of the Gospel, which
is given to one for that end that by edifying his Neighbor he might spread
that knowledge so far abroad, and like money put out to use, it might be
increased with many additions.

And Ibidem on Matthew. 23. 37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how gladly would I! etc.
Bellarmine objects this place to prove, that God gives to every man sufficient
grace to be saved if he will; arguing thus; how often (says our Savoiur) would
I have gathered thy children together, but ye would not? how would God gather
the children of Jerusalem? yea so would do it, that he complains of them who
would not, if those whom he knew could not will it, he did not so help that
they could will it, and therefore they wanted not sufficient grace: A. Our
Savior in this place speaks of all the Jews who oppose themselves against him
and his Prophets, and there were some amongst them who were not free from
blasphemy against the holy Ghost, as Christ himself witnesses, Matthew. 12. 31.
which shall never be forgotton: Now none will say that such sinners as those
were endued with sufficient grace, except those only who with Pelagius call
grace nature: and I will not charge Bellarmine with this, because (Bel^ de
Great. primi hom. cap. 6.) distinguishes thus between grace and nature, Peccatis
gravissimis amittitur donum gratiae supernaturalis; sed non corrumpitur donum
aliquod natural: i. e. By heinous offenses and crimes, a man may lose the gift
of supernatural grace, but not any natural endowment or gift; now if there be
any sin or state of sin which does exclude grace, then there were many in
Jerusalem who had not sufficient grace: But concerning the true meaning of this
verse, I shall speak more by and by.

Obj. 2. This place is further objected to prove, that a man may resist his
effectual calling if he will; Hemingius (de Great. universali page 117.) argues
to this end thus; Our Savior faith, O Jerusalem, how often would I have
gathered thy children, etc. and thou would not? wherefore if they would, they
might have been saved; it is therefore in man's power to resist his vocation.

Answ. First, if men might enjoy Heaven if they would, and wittingly and
willingly run unto Hell, they are neither worthy of mercy from God, nor pity
from men: But secondly, it is true, that it is not for any defect or want of
grace on Gods behalf, that many being called believe not, but the defect is in
themselves; there is no defect properly in God, for his calling is sufficient
unto all,; but that it is effectual to some and not to others, comes of
their own corruption and evilnesse of nature, which God takes away and
heals in whom he pleases, and suffers the rest to remain in their
hardness of heart: Thirdly, there is a sufficient calling for all, when God
offers the external means of salvation, whereby all might come thereunto if
they had grace; Now this calling may be resisted by men whom God justly leaves
unto themselves: There is also an effectual calling, when as God works
inwardly by the efficacy of his spirit, drawing his elect, and of unwilling,
makes them willing to obey their calling: and thus only the elect are called,
and this calling cannot be resisted, as appears by these words of our
Saviors, Many are called; namely, sufficiently on Gods behalf; but few are
chosen; that is, effectually called, as the elect only are: Now the first of
these callings was offered to Jerusalem: Fourthly, that Gods effectual and
gracious calling of election cannot be resisted, is clear from Scripture; No
man (says the Apostle) has resisted God's will: but as the Psalmist says,
Whatsoever pleased him, that did he in heaven and earth: whom it pleased God
therefore to save and call by his grace they shall be saved and called, etc.

In Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, this clause is raced out, in
the copy, page 283. But whose sins did Christ remit in his offering? The
sins of many, not of all; Some deliver this peremptory doctrine, that he dyed
as well for Caine as Abel, for Saul as David, for Judas as Peter: Indeed the
distinction of the Schoolmen is not wholly to be rejected, that Christ dyed,
quoad efficaciam, only for the elect, quoad sufficientiam, for all; yet
properly to speak, he dyed properly for the sins of the elect, for the
Scripture is evident, that the benefit of Christ's death reaches to the
faithful alone; to as many as believed in him, he gave this power to be called
the sons of God; that whosoever believes in him should not perish; the cup
of the new Testament, shed for many; I pray for them, I pray not for the world;
and do you think that he would shed his blood for the wicked of the world? If
we will have any comfort by the passion of Christ let us examine our selves
whether we have any fruit of it or not; can thou say with Job, I know that my
Redeemer lives; with Paul, I live, yet not I but Christ in me? then Christ was
offered for thy sins, then all thy sins were nailed to his cross, and not
one of them shall be laid to thy charge at the day of judgment. This may be a
singular comfort to Gods chosen children: in many things we sin all, The just
man falls seven times a day; but here is our comfort, Christ has taken away
our sins; Caine cried out, my sin is greater then I can bear; we need not
take up that lamentable cry, for Christ has taken away our sins: O death
where is thy sting? thanks he to God that gives us victory through Jesus
Christ, etc.

Ibidem page 269. Many are called by the Word preached, but are not called by
the Spirit, etc.

34. Passages deleted concerning hearing Gods word.
In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, written copy, page 235. this is
expunged: The hearing of the Word is necessary unto the knowledge of God: It
may here be objected, we can learn this knowledge nostro Mart, by our own
reading and study, and comparing one thing with another, and therefore the
preaching of the Word is not necessary. Answ. First, certainly by those means
men may learn the principles of Religion, and the propositions of faith and
obedience: Secondly, but the knowledge of God and Christ is a greater thing,
yea a spiritual thing, which is only revealed from Heaven, Matthew. 16. 17.
which revelation Christ promises in the ministry of the Word, 2 Cor. 3. 6.
Thirdly, they that know not the Gospel, are ignorant of the power, virtue and
wisdom of God: and therefore the greatest Scholars in the Universities, and
the wisest in the Court, or Temples, or Innes of Court, should hear willingly
(without contempt, derision and scorn) the Sermons of the meanest Scholars or
gifted Ministers (that are called by God to the work of the Ministry, as Aaron
was) because in the preaching of the Word, God has promised to make known his
power, etc.

Ibidem written copy, fol. 227. this is likewise crossed out.

Quest. What is required here of no?

Answ. First, we must take heed of all evil hearing, that is, restrain and
keep our ears from wicked councels, persuasions, allurements and provocations
unto sin, Prove. 1. 10. Dout. 13. 1. etc. Xenocrates Amphotidus did rather
choose to persuade children then men, because the manners of the men are so
corrupted that he had no hope to peswade or prevail with them (Plutarch de
Instit. liber:) but the children being free from evil habits, were more easily
persuaded and drawn to embrace moral (...); so the way for the ear to
receive and entertain good words, yea Gods good Word, i^ to preserve, keep and
stop it from hearing all evil words whatsoever as much as in no lies:
Secondly, we must accustom our selves to hear that which is good, Prove. 4. 20.

Quest. How may we know whether Christ has opened our ears and cured the
deafness of our souls or not?

Answ. First, some hear amiss; as for example: First, some dislike and
distaste Sermons, either because they are so common and ordinary, or because
they are sometimes something long: Secondly, some love not preaching, neither
desire it, and therefore hear it with a great deal of tediousness and
weariness: Thirdly, some desire it amiss, or affect it for some evil end, or
base or by respect: Fourthly, some carp at the word they hear: Fifthly, some
deride the word they hear: Sixthly, some hear only for some table-talk:
Seventhly, some hear that they may learn by some wrested argument or other to
maintain or defend their sins: Eighthly, some hear that they may be
delighted, that is, they desire rhetoric, wit, eloquence, strong lines, near,
acute, polished phrases, that thereby their itching ears might be tickled, and
delighted, Ezekiel. 33. 32. but non delectent verba sed prosint, Senec. words
should profit rather then please. Secondly, good hearing has many properties
whereby it may be known; as namely, First, an earnest desire to hear, as Act.
13. 42. like one who having been deaf desires the sense of hearing; Secondly,
a renewed understanding when we hear, as Mary did, who pondered in her mind
that which she heard: and this understanding of what we hear is so necessary,
that Chrysostom tells us, that the Deacon prayed for the Catechumenoi, that
they might understand what they heard: Thirdly, a trembling and fearful heart,
because we have offended our God, and so long neglected to serve him, and
thereby have caused him to separate himself from us: Fourthly, joy and delight
in the Word, Act. 8. 38, 39. and 13. 48. Fifthly, when the Word penetrates deep
into the heart, making therein deep furrows: Sixthly, when we lay up what we
hear as a treasure, hoarding it up against the time of need, Matthew. 13. 52.
never departing from the Word without some profit thereby: and Seventhly,
meditating continually upon the Word of God, Psalm. 119. 2. 3. Certainly if
these things he in us in truth, we may then assure our selves, that Christ has
begun to cure the deafness of our souls.

35. Passages purged out against Gods Hardening and Obduration of men.
THese clauses are expunged in Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew 11. ver. 25.
26. Quest. 2. Whom does the Lord thus blind or harden? Answ. First, he blinded
or hardened Pharaoh, Exodus 7. and why? first, because he persecuted and
oppressed the godly, Exodus 5. and Secondly, because he condemned and despised
the Lord and his Message, Exodus 5. 2. and Thirdly, because he drove away and
banished Moses the Messenger of the Lord from him, Exodus 10. 28. And secondly,
he hardened and blinded those who sought salvation by the Law, and not by faith
in Christ, Romans 9. 32. And thirdly, those who defile themselves by wallowing in
the filthy puddle of iuiquity, Isa. 59. 7. 9. Romans 1. 24. 25. And fourthly,
those who are drowned in sleep and overvvhelmed in security, Romans 11. 8. And
fifthly, those who still retain the veil over their hearts, and abide in
vvilfull and affected ignorance, 2 cor. 3. 14. And therefore if we desire that
the Lord should discover the hidden mysteries of the Gospel unto us, and not
hide them from us, then we must take heed of these things; to wit, First, we
must take heed of persecuting or oppressing of the children of God: and
Secondly, of concernning or despising either God or his Word: and Thirdly, of
banishing or putting away from us his Ministers and Messengers: and Fourthly,
of seeking salvation by works: and Fifthly, of sin, security, presumption
and ignorance, etc.

Ibidem written copy page 214. The Lord is active in reprobates two manner of
vvayes; namely first, Praedestinando, by determining and appointing of them
unto a just does; but this is remote from our present purpose: Secondly,
Obdurando etc. And a little after before Quest. 6. This last is most proper to
our present purpose and institution, for if it be demanded, How does the Lord
blind the mind, or harden the heart? I answer, by not giving a blessing unto
his Word, or not cooperating therewith or not enabling men to apprehend and
conceive or understand the Gospel and the truths therein contained.

36. Passages blotted out against Holy Days dedicated to Saints.
IN Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, written copy page 358. this sentence is
expunged: The Papists hold, that Holy Days may be dedicated unto Saints, for
their honor and worship: as Christpromised this charitable work of Mary
Magdalen wrought upon him should be recorded and remembered, whereby (say they)
we learn; that the good works of Saints may be recorded to the Honor of
Saints in the Church, whereof arise their commemorations and Holy Days,
Rhemist. annot. Matthew. 25. sect. 1.

First, the good works of Saints may be remembered to the honor of God, without
their Holy Days and commemorations; Christ instituted no holy day of Mary
Magdalen, neither commanded any image of her fact to be made, but only a
memory of her in the preaching of the Gospel: Secondly, we grant that
christian solemnities may be kept as things indifferent, which the Church may
retain or abrogate, as it shall seem best for edification, if they ^e not
observed of necessity as a part of Gods worship neither consecrated to the
honor of Saints, seeing all divine worship is wholly to be reserved to God,
and not to be given to any other. For times and seasons, the Scripture says,
the Lord has put them only in his own power, therefore he only is to have the
honor of them. Thirdly, what honor is due unto Saints, Saint Augustine
shows; Colimus Martyrs eo cultu dilectionis and societatis, que in hac
vitacoluntur sancti homines Dei, we do honor Martyrs-with the service of
love, and fellowship as the holy men are honored in this life; but it is not
lawful to consecrate days and times to holy men living; therefore neither to
Saints departed, for one and the same honor is due to them both. etc.

37. Clauses obliterated, That we are Justified only by Faith in Christ, not
by Works: That Justification may be lost, and that Works merit not.
IN Doctor Clarks Sermons, page 282. l. 41. after that in Christ, should be
only, that in Christ only, (we are justified) but only is blotted out, etc.

Ibid. page 419. l. 29. after verse 8. should follow this excellent passage,
which was expunged by the Licenser: Surely faith justifies; faith ONLY; works
have no doing in the work, in justification: Rome cannot prove it, non si se
ruperit, if she disputes till Doomsday: but, that sola fides is not
solitaria; faith never is alone, true saving faith, love is fast linkt unto
her, but in that act of Justification she intermeddles not, lets faith work it
alone: Love is concomitant, not co-operant; feign would Rome wrest, (at least)
but this from us, that works do save; if not justify, yet save; needs will
she have them necessary to salvation, we yield them not that neither; some
Lutherans do, but with that distinction, as we may yield it too, necessitate
praesentiae, not efficienciae, works are where salvation is, but they are not
cause of salvation; they are in salvando, but have not vim salvandi, all that
are saved must have them, but not any are saved by them, etc.

Ibid. page 419. l. 3. after our conversation, should follow these words, as we
do out of the act of our Justification, etc. (viz. exclude works.)

Ibid. page 443. l. 10. after these words, a far off, this clause is deleted:
Justification by works; Saint James is flat for that; ex operibus justificatur
homo: As for the distinction of declarative, it was but some Calvmist that
invented it, etc.

Ibidem page 570. l. 15. these lines are expunged: The other part of the
spirit's exposition of the blessedness of the dead, is the reward of their
faith, for that is meant by these words, and their works follow them: Works (as
often elsewhere) put by figure for reward, the reward of our faith is the
salvation of our souls; not that faith merits reward, for faith too is a work,
and works merit not; Christ says, the Kingdom of Heaven is a gift, Luke 12.
31. and we have it not ex facto, but ex pacto, not of doing ought, but of the
Covenant; God has promised it on his gracious promise, faith only is enabled
to lay hold; and because it is the nature of faith to be operative to bring
forth fruits, which are good works, it pleased the holy Ghost in his place, and
many other to use the phrase here; It is, etc.

In Doctor Featlies Clavis Mystica, these clauses and distinctions were
deleted: page 444. In this argument this grave and learned Divine expatiated
through his whole discourse: of which I may say as Saint Peter does of Saint
Paule's Epistles; our beloved brother, according to the wisdom given unto him,
thus spoke of these things (in diverse passages of his Sermon) in which some
things are heard to be understood, which that the unlearned and unstable might
not wrest, as they do the sayings of the most orthodox Divines: I hold it
requisite partly out of the writings of this most learned speaker, partly out
of his own words in his private conference with me, thus to illustrate his
meaning and to clear the truth, good works may be considered.

First, in regard of the person, who is either, first, in state of grace;
secondly, or out of it.

Secondly, in regard of the cause: First, principal, the Spirit of God.
Secondly, isntrumental, the faculties of the soul and organt of the body.

Thirdly, in regard of their adjunct: First, either as they are considered
alone by themselves. Secondly, or together with the merits and intercession of
Christ.

Secondly when we speak of the appeasing of Gods wrath, God may be considered
either, first, as a Judge; secondly as a Father.

Thirdly, wrath may be appeased two manner of ways: First negatively, by
subtracting the fuel thereof. Secondly positively, by extinguishing, as it
were, the flame thereof, with something else cast upon it.

According to these distinctions, the truth in this point may be delivered in
these succeeding insertions.

First, no work done by any person out of the state of grace, produces any of
the effects above mentioned.

Secondly, works done by men in state of grace, as they proceed from
themselves, are not without some flaine, nor are they simply approved of God,
but in some respect only.

Thirdly, the good works wrought through the help of grace, if they be
considered by themselves, without relation to Christ's merits and intercession
which covers their imperfection and gives them efficacy and a prevailing
power with God produce none of the above named effects.

Fourthly, works done by men in grace, as they proceed from Gods Spirit, and
are improved by the merits and intercession of Christ, are the means and
secondary causes of procuring unto us temporal and spiritual blessings.

Fifthly, God's wrath, as he is an angry Judge, can be appeased by nothing but
by the blood of Christ and his infinite sacrifice, which alone satisfies his
justice.

Sixthly, the anger of God, as he is a Father, and sometimes severely
chasteneth his children for their unthankfulness and other sianes, may be so
far appeased by them, that he will take his scourage from them, and bestow
new favors upon them; this anger may be appeased both privately, by breaking
off their sins, and thereby taking away the cause of his displeasure; and
also positively, by fasting, prayer and Almesdeeds; to conclude, as the fly in
Martial, upon which there fell a drop of Amber and enclosed it, grew to be
precious, and was sold at a high rate, not for the flies sake, but for the
Ambers; so the good works of Gods children, which of themselves (especially so
far as they proceed from them) are of little worth, yet confidered, quatincta
sanguine Christi, as Beza speaks, as dyed with Christ's blood, and covered all
over and melosed in the Amber of his merits, become precious in the eyes of
God, and are in a fair sense and construction, both placatoria and
improtatoria,

In Master Wards Comentary upon Matthew, written copy page 259. this passage is
expunged: Matthew. 13. 20. 21. The stony ground, etc.

Obj. Bellarmine (de justif. lib. 3. cap. 14.) produces these two verses to
prove, that faith and the grace of justification may be lost; arguing thus;
these receive the word with joy, but they have no root; yea for a while
believe, but in the time of temptation fall away; and therefore faith may be
lost; for they had faith because they believed, they believed the Word of God,
and yet fell away.

Answ. The Text expounds it self, they had no root, and they believed but for
a while, therefore they had no true faith, for true faith is not without root
as appears by Saint Paul's prayer for the Ephesians, 3. 17. I pray that Christ
may dwell in your hearts by faith, that being rooted and grounded in faith etc.
and therefore true faith has a root.

Ibidem on Matthew 5. 7. written copy page 60. 69. this sentence is dashed out.

Qu. Why may not we ascribe some merit unto our works?

Answ. Because that were to derogate from God and his good will, who so
graciously invites us to come and buy grace of him without money or money worth,
Isa. 55. 1. and therefore we must not expect nor exact the reward of glory as a
due debt unto ^s from God for our works, as Saint Elzear^us did (Staplet.
aestist. fol. 141. initio) who upon a certain day refusing to accept of a
Scarlet robe, and an (...) of gold which were offered unto him when he entered
into his chamber, powered forth this pharisaicall prayer unto God: Ta mihi
Domine Deus in paradiso debes contum auriuncias and duos pannos coxincos: O
Lord remember how thou art indebted unto me (when I come into Heaven) two
Scarlet robes, and one hundred ounces of gold: Thus Papists proudly arrogate
much unto themselves, and derogate greatly from God both in their prayers and
opinions; but let the opinion of the Protestants be, that blessedness is
derived unto them from the mere m^rcy and free favor of God, and let their
prayers be, that the Lord would be graciously pleased to count them worthy of
this blessedness (2 These. 1. 11.) and that they may find mercy of the Lord at
the last day, 2 Timothy 1. 18.

Obj. Will not this hinder and discourage men from working, to remember that
all their works merit nothing at Gods hands at all?

Answ. It is so far from hindering that it furthers, so far from
discouraging, that it encourages; so far from lestening that it increases;
and so far from extinguishing that it enflames our desires and endeavors to
be rich in good works, etc.

Ibidem on Matthew. 5. 18. page 96. this is castrated: Your good works: The
Papists produce this place to prove the works of the righteous to be perfect,
and Bellarmine (lib. 4. de justif. cap. 5.) argues thus; The Scripture calls
the works of the righteous absolutely good works, as in this verse (that they
seeing your good works:) But if all the good works of the righteous be mixed
with mortal s^nne, then they are rather to be called evil then good works:
This he proves from another (viz. ex Areopag^a quarto de divinis nominibus,
Quia malu^ dicatur opus absolte nisi integre fic bonum: because except a work
be perfectly good, it is absolutely called evil: First, this phrase works are
absolutely called good, is Amphibola and doubtful, sometimes signifying the
works which are good, simple; and sometimes those which are good in part.
Secondly, works are called good, either first, indefinitely, as they are
commanded in and by the law; or secondly peculiarly, as they are performed by
some singular persons; as it is one thing to desire virtue in general and
another the virtue of Alcihiades or Socrates; as it is one thing to commend
learning in general, another the learning of Plato or Cicero: so it is one
thing to speak of good works in general, another of the good works of Peter,
John or Paul.

Thirdly, these things premised, we grant, that works are absolutely called
good taken indefinitely and as they are commanded; yea this verse proves it,
which speaks not of works done by any particular person, but of those which men
ought to do; there is none of sound judgment can deny or doubt, but that we
are so debtors unto the Law, that we ought not only to begin, but also to
perfect that which the Law prescribes as perfectly good, and in all the parts
thereof absolute; but he were of unsound judgment that hence would conclude,
because it is our duty to do it, therefore we do it, for Saint Paul
confesses, that he does not only the good which he ought, but which he would
do: Thus I say, if we consider the works as they are enjoined, it is true that
they may be called absolutely good; but if we understand particularly the works
of this or that man, then we deny that ever the Scripture calls them absolutely
good, neither does the Cardinal prove this, because (as was said before) this
place speaks not of what is done, but of what ought to be done, Chamier, T^n.
3. fol. 360. 1. 2. 3. de Imperfect. Op. lib. 11. cap. 23.

Fourthly, our work which we do are called good in Scripture; Non secundum
perfectam justitiam, sed hanc quae bumanae fragilitati competit (Hier. Dialog,
1. Contr. Pelag.) not according to perfect righteousness, but as it is
agreeable to our humane frailty; or, they are good in part, though not
perfectly. Becanus yet urges this place for the proof of this opinion of
perfection of works; disputing thus: The Apostles are commanded so to shine
before men, that they may see their good works, and glorify their Father which
is in Heaven: But how shall men see their good works, if they all be damnable?
or how shall their heavenly Father be glorified, if all they do be
contaminated and defiled with sin? Answ. We must distinguish between humane
and divine judgment; men see men's works as they are outwardly, and can go no
further, they only perceive what is obvious to their senses, and can neither
see the heart, nor know whether that which is done be done according to all the
circumstances that are required thereunto. Now true righteousness is proper
unto the heart, and it is the circumstances that make the work more or lesser,
good or bad: and therefore although men see the good works of the righteous,
which outwardly they show forth and glorify God for them, yet it follows not
hence, therefore those works are in Gods sight perfectly good, etc.

Ibidem fol. 185. this is crossed out: The moral law was a bond of salvation
unto Adam Romans 2. 13. and of death, Gal. 3. 10. but is now abrogated by Christ,
in regard of the conditions, we being now justified only by faith.

Ibidem on Matthew. 12. ver. 27. written copy page 251. this discourse is
obliterated: By thy words thou shall bo justified.

Quest. What is the matter or material cause of our justification?

Answ. First, some say that the only act of man's heart in believing is the
matter of it. Secondly, some say that partly faith and partly Christ's obedience
is the matter of our righteousness. Thirdly, some say that the works of the
law done by man, are the matter of our righteousness. Now all these three
opinions are sufficiently refuted by Master Forb's of Justification, cap. 22.
page 77. to whom I refer the Reader. Fourthly, we say that only Christ in
his obedience, is the whole matter of our righteousness, and that nothing in
Heaven or in earth, in man or without man, is the matter of man's righteousness
before God, except only Christ; this being amply handled and proved by Forbes,
cap. 23. 24. and his book being in English and easy to be had, I refer the
Reader thereunto, etc.

Ibidem written copy page 68. this is crossed out by the Licenser:

Thirdly, the Lord having converted and regenerated us, we are only able to
bring forth good works, for non precedunt justificandum, sed sequentur
justificatum, Aug. good works march not before as causes of our justification,
but follow as fruits or signs of our sanctification, etc.

And page 336. Answ. 1. They (good works) are the way and means unto this
Kingdom, but I do not give or grant this and that; First, because that which
is but only a means, is not at all a sufficient cause: and Secondly, because
if we should grant this then the Papists would have what they desired; for they
say, that good works are necessary to salvation. Non modo necessitate
presentiae, sed necessitate efficienciae, Bellarm. de Justific. lib. 4. cap. 1.
The way which leads to London, is indeed a means of coming to London, but not
the efficient cause, Neque enim facit sed patitur, ut quis veniat Londinum; for
when a man comes thereunto, the way does nothing but only suffers, and
therefore ^he way thereunto is more rightly called causa sine qua non, Parens
s. fol. 848. b. etc.

In Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, page 58. these clauses are
purged out: By grace you are saved, not by works; any kind of way, let us not
part stakes with the Lord, and give half to our selves, and half to the Lord,
as the Papists do.

Page 208. Our best works are defiled with sin, says the copy; too often
defiled, says the Licenser, etc.

Page 247. Our praying, preaching, hearing of Sermons, and best works are
unprofitable to bring us to the Kingdom of Heaven; they may be seals of our
election, but no causes of our salvation.

Page 253. The old Covenant depended on working; do this and live; the new
requires nothing but faith, etc.

Page 339. Here we may behold what reckoning is to be made of the works of the
unregerate, though they seem never so glorious to the eyes of the world: God
sets not a straw by them, no more then he did by the sacrifices of the Pagans;
nor their works be not meritorious, because they proceed from an heart void of
faith: yet they affirm them to be good works, and such as please God: truly
they be as pleasing to him as the sacrifice of Caine was, they are no better
then fine glistering sins; they want faith, therefore they cannot please God;
nothing that we do without faith has any acceptance with God: It is said of
the ancient Israelites, that the Word profited them not, because it was not
mingled with faith, nor sacrifice; in the time of the Law nothing was good
unless there were salt in it, so no work is good if it be not seasoned with
faith; therefore let us entreat the Lord to give us a true faith in Christ,
that so our spiritual sacrifices may be accepted of him.

And page 410. though the blind Papists will not see it, but we affirm, that
our best works are defiled with sin; our preaching, our praying, our giving
of alms hearing of Sermons, yea martyrdom, which is the most glorious work of
all, may have some contagion of sin in it, our bearing of sickness may have
some infirmities, we may curse God in it, as Job's Wife persuaded him to do:
and if God should mark what is done amiss, who could stand? But here is his
goodness, he saw a lie in the work of Rahab, yet he commends it for a good
work; he sees imperfections in all that we do, yet he passes them over, and
because we be in Christ, he accepts of that we do; as a child may fail in
doing his fathers errand, he may fail in some circumstances; yet because the
substance of it is done, the father praises him; so will our heavenly father
us; well done thou good and faithful servant; therefore let this encourage us
to well doing etc. And page 101. We are not to seek salvation by the
observation of the Law, as Papists do.

38. A Passage expunged against the Churches Infallibility.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew page 294. this is deleted.

Object. The Doctrine of the Church is in all things infallible.

Answ. First, this was a personal promise, made only to the Apostles, and so
cannot be extended to all the Church, if we will speak according to the words
properly, according to their immediate sense.

39. Passages deleted against the Impositions, Tyranny and Dissimulation of
Kings (see Arbitrary power, etc. page 289.)
IN Doctor Clarks Sermons, page 224. instead of legal imposts, the Licenser
has put, peaceable imposts.

Ibid page 225. instead of Subjects are not Tributaries, the Licenser has
altered it to, good subjects need not to be Tributaries, etc. And instead of
not that in Samuel, he puts, if not that in Samuel.

Ibidem, after jus Regis, the Licenser has blotted out these words; A plea
abused to corrupt good Kings. Ibidem, Not Samuel's Tollet, is made, If not
Samuel's Tellet.

Ibidem page 336. l. 4. these words, at all, are added by the Licenser, and
these that follow; Or if you will, not lawful in a compulsory way, but in a
consultory: it wills due respect and discretion: The Author wrote thus; Kings
are uncontrolable; who will say (says Job) to a King thou art wicked? that
shows that it is not safe to censure them, not it is not lawful, men may do
that they dare not do, etc.

And page 452. after unto another, this is expunged; It was a King, a most
Christian King, that taught his son happily all the Latin that he had, Qui
nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare, he cannot reign that cannot faigne, etc.

In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, page 145. written copy, this sentence ^s
expunged: Subjects are not actively to obey Kings, when they command what God
forbids in his Word.

40. Passages deleted, that the Law of God is possible to be fulfilled by men,
as the Papists hold; and That men are damned for Original sin as well as
Actual.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew. 11. 5. page 227. this is obliterated.

How is the fulfilling of the Law impossible?

Answ. First negatively, not because the works therein contained in their own
nature transcend the power of the mind or body, or Organs; for man in Paradise
had strength enough to obey the whole Law, and the Saints in Heaven do
perfectly fulfill it. Secondly affirmatively, the Law is impossible for man to
fulfill: First, the judgment of the mind is so depraved, that we know not how
to do any spiritual or moral work aright, so as we ought to do it: and
Secondly, because the affections are so corrupted, that we are not able to
govern them, or to curb or restrain the malice and depravation of them.

Quest, 2. Why are so many, or any damned perpetually?

Answ. Not only for their actual sins, but even also for their original
corruptions, and depravation of nature, Ephesians. 2. 1, 2. for sinners shall be
beaten with stripes, and with more stripes, Luke 12. 47. etc. that is, First,
they shall have plura verbera, more stripes, and more grievous torments in hell
for their actual sins. But Secondly, they shall also have verbera, stripes,
eternal condemnation and torments (though not equal with the former) who
never committed actual sin, but only dyed in their natural estate, their
original corruption not being washed away by, or in the blood of Christ.

Observe. Secondly, by grace in Christ we are enabled to walk in the ways of
God, and to work his work, for Christ does give unto all those whom he calls
power (in some measure) to obey him; for he gives not only velle, power to
will and desire, but also posse, power to do that which he commands, Phil. 2.
13.

Quest. 3. How does this appear, for none seem (and that especially to
themselves) more weak then the children of God?

Answ. It most evidently appears by these particulars, viz. First, because we
are called unto the glory of God, Phil. 2. 15. etc. and to hold forth the Lamp
of a pure life, Mat. 5. 16. and therefore certainly those whom God calls, shall
from him receive grace and power to perform good works. Secondly, because
Religion is the pathway to Heaven, and therefore undoubtedly those whom the
Lord calls unto that inheritance he will enable in some measure to walk in the
ways of Religion, and to give unto him religious worship; read Deuteronomy. 5. 33.
Josh. 22. 5. Mat. 3. 8. 10. and 7. 20. Luke 11. 28. Romans 2. 7. Gal. 5. 16.

Thirdly, because Christ (unto those whom he calls) gives the holy comforter,
even a bright shining light, whereby we are assured of the love of God; which
love of his works a threefold effect in us; namely, First, it makes us love
the Lord again, and to return love for love; and although we cannot love him
in that measure and degree that he loves us (his love to us being perfect,
ours to him imperfect) yet we labor and desire to love him above all things in
heaven and earth: Hence secondly, we desire to do all things which are
pleasing unto him yea and to perform them cheerfully and with delight.
Thirdly, the love of God of the holy spirit which assures us thereof, does
teach us how to obey God; namely in sincerity of heart, yea with our whole
heart and life, and that for the Lords sake only, not for any base or by ends
of our own; and in faith, hoping that our works shall be acceptable unto God
for Christ's sake, etc.

Ibidem on Matthew. 19. 18. page 289. manuscript Copy, this discourse is purged
out by the Licenser.

Quest. Whether is the moral Law of God possible to be kept, or perfectly to
be obeyed with, or by an actual obedience?

Answ. First, the Law is possible to be obeyed, in regard of that relation
which is betwixt our nature or out mind, or the faculties of the soul, and the
actions themselves, which are enjoined in the law, for whatsoever is commanded
in the law, whether internal or external, may be performed by the faculties
and parts of our bodies and souls; yea the obedience which is there required of
us is to be performed by those faculties: The Lord in his law does not require
of us impossibilia, impossible things; either first, in se, in themselves; or
secondly, respectu facultatum, in regard of the faculties of the soul; that
is, the Lord in his law does notcommand us to raise the dead, or to remove
mountains with, or by our words, for these are impossible things in
themselves for us to do; neither does he command us to fly in the air or to
walk upon the water because these are impossible in regard of us and our
faculties; but he commands such things as our faculties are capable of.

Secondly, the obedience of the law is impossible in regard of some
circumstances; that is, first, respectu extentionts, in regard of the
extension; for first, although we might perform some one particular action
commanded in the law, yet not all and every such action which is therein
enjoined, and yet this the law requires of us: and secondly, although we might
perform some one action or other, which the law enjoines, yet we are not
able always to abide firm and immovable in this our obedience, and yet the
Lord threatens us with a curse, if we both do not do all, and abide therein
always, Gal. 3. 10. and thirdly, although we might perform many duties which
the law commands, yet we could not perform them all always in that sufficient
degree, and ample, and perfect measure which the law enjoynes; and thus
Andradius himself confesses, that the first Commandment cannot be kept, we
cannot love God in that manner, measure and degree which the law commands.

Secondly, respectu intentionis, in regard of the intention, because we can
do nothing with a perfect mind, for whatsoever is not of faith is of sin,
Heb. 11. 6. and therefore without says, no true or acceptable obedience.

Thirdly, respectu infirmitatis, in regard of the infirmity of our nature,
because all the gifts and faculties of our nature are vitiated and corrupted,
Job 4. 8. 19. and 15. 15. 16. Romans 3. 10, etc. Psalm. 14. 12. Chrysostom (sup.
Matthew. fol. 614.) says That by nature we are blind, lame, taken with the
palsy and incarcerated, and therefore no wonder, Legem non esse possibilem, if
the law be unpossible unto us.

Quest. 2. Is not this unjust for God to require of us that which is impossible
unto, or for us to do?

Answ. No not at all: God may justly command a blind man to walk, if his
blindness come from himself: if maliciously, he has plucked out his own
eyes: A man may justly require his debt of a Prodigal: Rent is due unto the
Landlord, though the Tennant have wasted all his estate and substance; and God
may justly require that obedience of us, which once from and by him we had
power to perform, although now by our sins we have lost that power.

Quest. 3. What may we learn from hence?

Answ. First to acknowledge that the duties enjoined by the law are possible in
themselves; and Secondly, that they are become impossible unto us by sin, and
the infirmity of the flesh, Romans 8. 3. and Thirdly, to confess that God is
true, and we liars, he just, but we wicked.

Ibid, on Mat. 11. 29. The Papists generally object this place to prove the
possibility of the laws fulfilling; What is this light burden and sweet yoke
(say the Rhemists) but the Commandments of God? and therefore they are
possible to be kept, Bellarmine de justific. lib. 4. cap. 11. and Vasques, and
Alphonsus, and Salmeron, and the Trent Council: and Becauus urges this place
to prove, that actual obedience to the whole law is not only possible, but
also very easy to the regenerate and justified person: They argue thus:

That burden which is light may be carried without shrinking under it, that
yoke which is easy is worn without pain, and those Commandments which are
not burdensome, may be observed without difficulty: But such is the moral law,
My Yoke says Christ here, is easy and my burden light; therefore the moral
law may be easily observed.

I will for the satisfying of this Objection, give only a double answer, viz.
First answer to the point which they endeavor to prove, and then to the place
which they allege for their proof.

First, to the substance or matter, or subject matter of the Objection, viz.
That the law is possible and easy to be observed by the regenerate: I answer;
the law of God is impossible to be kepr in such perfection as God requires,
and therefore no man can be justified by the works of the law, Gal. 2. 16. and
3. 11. Here observe these particulars, to wit, First, the old Pelagians did
wrest this and the like places for this end, to prove the possibility of the
fulfilling of the law, as appears by Hierom (advers. Pelagian lib. 1. cap. 1.
and lib. 2. cap. 2. and 4.) and Augustine (de Perfect. Justific. contra
Coelestium, and de Natura and Gratia contra Pelagian cap. 69.) and therefore we
may note by the way, from whence the Papists and those amongst us, who hold
this erroneous tenet, took or learnt it, etc.

Ibid. on Mat. 19. 21. If thou will be perfect, etc. this is purged out; The
Papists hold that a man may perfectly obey, and fulfill the Law of God, and for
the proof hereof argue thus. If a man may do more then the Law requires, then
certainly he may do as much. But a man may do more then the Law requires;
therefore he may do as much. The minor Bellarmine proves by the example of
this young man, who telling Christ, that he had observed all the Commandments,
and that from his youth, our Savior bid him do one thing more, and then he
should be perfect (if thou will be perfect, go sell that thou have and give it
to the poor, and follow me.) Now if the young man had done this. he had done
more then the Law required, in as much as whatsoever the Law required he had
formerly observed, as he said himself; Hac omnia servavi a juventute, All
these things have I observed from my youth up etc.

First, this word More, may two manner of ways be understood; namely, either,
first simply it signifies something which is not commanded; and in this sense
the consequent is naught, viz. if a man may do any one thing which is not
enjoined by the Law, then he may do any thing which the Law enjoynes and
commands; this follows not, for it is not necessary that that be done which is
commanded, because something is done which is not commanded: as for example,
the Son which was bidden to go into the Vineyard, went not, and yet might at
that time be doing some household work. Adam brake the Commandment given unto
him, and yet sewed figge-leaves to cover his shame, which he was not commanded
to do. Secondly, this word More may signify some good thing over and above
that which is commanded in the Law, or, after the fulfilling of all these
things which are prescribed in the Law, to do over and above some other good
work which is not prescribed. Now in this sense we grant the Major, but as
absolutely fall we deny the Minor, viz. That a man may perform whatsoever is
commanded in the Law, and other good things besides which are not commanded.
For there is no good thing at all beyond that good is commanded in the Law;
otherwise the Law should not be perfect, which is false by the very letter of
the word, Psalm. 19. 7, 8 9. yea those things which are not contained in the
Law, are in themselves neither good nor bad but indifferent; and where they are
made good, it is by those things which are in the Law. As for example, to Fast
is not in it self a moral good work, but it is good if it be done for the
love of God, and for the hatred of sin, or both, which are commanded in or by
the Law. And therefore it is utterly false, That a man may perform a greater
good work then the Law enjoynes. Secondly to the proof of the Minor, we
answer two things: first, the young man speaks of a part not of the whole Law;
that is, of the second Table, not of the first, as appears by the text: He
demands of Christ, What he must do to be saved? Christ answers, keep the
Commandments, verse 17. He demands again, Which? Christ answers, These, ver.
18. and recites the precepts of the second Table only; whereunto the Pharisee
replies in this sort; all these precepts (viz. of the second Table) have I kept
from my youth. Now suppose a man could absolutely and perfectly fulfill the
second Table, yet it follows not therefore he fulfils the whole Law, for he
may fail in his duty toward God; and he only fulfils the Law, who performs
his duty absolutely both to God and Man. Secondly, the Cardinal plays the
Sophister, committing the fallacy, called petitio principit, taking that for
granted which is to be proved, viz. that the young man kept the whole Law, for
without proof we neither can nor may believe it, either upon the Jesuits or
Pharisees word: We (I say) do not believe the testimony of this vain young
man touching his own righteousness, who boasted of keeping the second Table
in the outvvard duties thereof, when as yet he vvanted inward charity toward
his neighbor, and love toward his God; He avouched that he had kept all
perfectly, and fulfilled that Commandment, Thou shall love thy neighbor as
thy self: and thereupon is so bold as to ask Christ what lack I yet? Christ
to convince him of his pride and wants, puts him thus to the trial, If thou
have such perfect charity toward man, then certainly if God command thee to
bestovv, not a part, but all thy goods upon the poor, upon promise of better
things to thy self, thy duty unto God, and thy singular charity unto men will
make thee do so; Go then sell all that thou have and give to the poor, etc.
upon which special command his covetous mind shows it self: nay, it is
plain, he loved not his neighbor so well as his riches, neither is so
dutiful to God, or charitable to the poor, as for either of their sakes to
part with his possessions; by which he proclaim his heart to be full of
covetousness, and void of faith in God and true charity tovvads his neighbor;
and consequently was far from the observation of the whole Law.

41. Passages deleted against the Constancy of Gods Love and friendship to his
Children.
IN Doctor Jones his Comentary on Heb. 4. 16. page 141. this is rased out: A
friend is borne for adversity, and will be a friend when we need him: he is a
friend indeed that keeps with us in a time of need: such a friend is God
Almighty through Jesus Christ; be will help us at our need in this life, and at
the length, take us up into that place where we shall need nothing any more.
Strange, that such a passage should be obliterated as heterodox.

42. Passages expunged against the Popish Mass, Transubstantiation, adoring
the Host.
IN Doctor Clarks Sermons, page 155. l. 4. this is blotted out by the Licenser:
I think indeed we prosper never the better for the Mass, never came blessing
upon Israel by Baals Priests, etc. Admirable that such a passage as this could
not pass our Presses without a purgation, unless the resolution of these
Inquisitors were to usher in Mass and Mass Priests again without opposition.

In Mr. Wards Comentary on Matthew, p. 179. there is this deleatur: There is a
satisfaction to God of atonement, which is unwarrantable, because Christ by
his death has done this; hence then the Mass is an abomination, not an
oblation, Heb. 10. 18.

P. 339. Thirdly, we know not how to serve God aright, nor when we do well;
so the Papists being ignorant of the way unto salvation, sometimes run unto
the Mass, sometimes undertake some long and weary pilgrimage, sometimes flee
unto the Popes Bulls, sometimes enter into diverse Orders of Monasteries, and
sometimes hope that they shall be helped our of purgatory: thus staggering like
a drunken man, too and fronot knowing what way they should take to come unto
Heaven, and therefore who will deny but great is our blindness? etc.

In Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, chap. 9. ver. 28. these notable
passages are purged out, page 282. This Chapter may well be called the
cutthroat of the Mass; it is strange that the Papists reading it, are not
ashamed to uphold that Idol; for as no man dies but once, so Christ was to be
offered but once for the expiation of our sins: It is the most gross and
fantastical assertion that ever was heard of, most repugnant to Scripture and
reason.

First, Heaven must contain the body of Christ till all things be fulfilled:
Ergo, it cannot be on the earth.

Secondly, if the bread that Christ gave to his Disciples, were turned into his
own body, he must of necessity have two bodies, the one held in the hand of
the other. Their distinction of a bloody and unbloody sacrifice will not serve
the turn, for without blood there is no remission of sins: and if his body
were offered for our sins in the Supper, then why was it offered after on the
Cross? either it was a perfect oblation, or imperfect; if they say imperfect,
O horrible blasphemy! if they say perfect, then why was not another made? for
as bono nil melius sic perfecto nil perfectius. The Apostle calls the Gentiles
fools, prosessing themselves wise they become fools; for they turned the
similitude of the incorruptible God into the similitude of Beasts, Birds and
creeping things; much more may we call the Papists fools, that turn the
similitude of God into the similitude of a piece of bread: If the Aegiptians
are worthily to be derided for worshipping a Cat for God, then justly may we
laugh at the Papists, for worshipping a wafer cake for God: If the Angel in the
Revelation would not have John to worship him, O do not so, worship God, how
much more does it grieve the Angels to see a piece of bread worshipped for God;
wherefore let us spit at this abominable sacrifice, and never give
entertainment to it: Doctor Tailor was angry with the Priest that began to say
Mass at Hadley in Queen Mary's days; thou Devil, who made thee so bold as to
enter into this Church of Christ, and to profane it with this abominable
Idolatry; the people pulled down the Altar; you that have been seasoned with
his wholesome doctrine, tread in his steps: Let no Masse-monging Priest, that
will take upon him without Commission to offer up Christ forty or a hundred
times, be admitted into our Church; remember that Christ can be but once
offered to take away the sins of the world. The deleting of such a notable
passage as this, discovers a professed design to bring in Popery among us
again, without the least opposition: But this is not singular, but seconded
with others.

Ibid. page 305. Whereas they say the Mass is but a commemorative and
applicatory Sacrifice, to bring to our remembrance the sacrifice on the Cross,
and to apply it to us; that needs not; a sufficient commemoration and
representation of it is to us in the Supper, 1 cor. 11. 26. and it is applied
to us by faith, Romans 3. 25, 26. Act. 18.

Page 244. No mortal man can offer up Christ, as the popish Priests
blasphemously presume.

Page 292. Here we have a club to beat down the Mass.

Page 417. If the Martyrs in Queen Mary's days, would have gone to Mass, if
they would have acknowledged Mass with mental reservation to themselves, the
real presence of Christ in the sacrifice, they might have been delivered; but
they would not; they had rather have irons on their legs, then the intolerable
burden of an evil conscience in their souls; they had rather have bodies in
prison then souls in prison; they had rather endure the pains of a material
fire for a time, then the torment of hell fire or ever; this was greatly to be
admired.

Page 418. We may scoff at the Idolatry of the Papists; a woman said unto a
Priest in Queen Mary's days, that came to buy a Capon; man can thou make God
Almighty, and can not make a Capon?

Ibid. page 263. When Christ says, do this in remembrance of me, If the Mass
be a remembrance of Christ, as they say it is comemorativum sacrificium, then
Christ is not there himself.

P. 270. Obj. although Christ's death was necessary, for the full confirmation
and accomplishment of the New Testament, yet it was begun to be declared in the
sacrifice of his last Supper, Matthew. 26. 28, whereby it is plain, that the
blessed Challis of the Altar has the very sacrificall blood in it that was
shed on the Cross, in and by which the New Testament was dedicated and does
consist. Answ.

The New Testament was ratified by the blood of Christ at his death, as
appears by the whole discourse, for the Testament is of no force till the
Testator be de dead: Ergo it could not be ratified at all by the Sacrament of
his blood.

Page 291. there are sixteen lines crossed to the same matter, that the Mass
is no commemorative nor propitiatory sacrifice, and may well be spared.

Judge then by these purgations, what was intended by this Arch-Prelate and his
confederates.

43. Passages blotted out in defense of Priests marriage.
IN the Sermons of Doctor Clarke page 205. after as our Apostles, this is
obliterated; The Papists except, that marriage is a clogge to Christians, and an
encombrance to the practice of religions duties; Saint Chrysostom controles
that; it is (says he) no hinderance unto heavenly things, yet does the Pope
condemn it.

And in Master Wards Comentary on Matthew, fol. 1. this is deleted: Honorable
marriage is to be preferred before dishonorable whoredom: and therefore, ex
ungue Leonem, we may easily conjecture without breach of christian charity,
what to think of Popery, that to all or any of their Clergy does allow a
dispensation for fornication, but denies unto them the lawful remedy of
marriage.

In Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, chap. 12. v. 14. this is
deleted: Saint Paul strains holiness to marriage, this is an holy bed, Heb.
13. 4. men may be holy and honest men though they be married.

44. Passages dashed out, that the Virgin Mary was not without sin, original
and actual: brake not the Serpents head: is not to be prayed to, etc.
In Doctor Clarks ninth Sermon of the Nativity, these words are deleted: there is
a woman too, Papists say: without sin, Christ's Mother; for her, why calls
she then her son her savior? etc.

Ibidem page 338. l. 20. after never any son, should follow, One woman only
is exempt from sin, but only by the man of sin, etc.

And p. 336. l. 20. after the right Puritan, the Licenser has deleted these
lines: it is a hard posse that never comes in esse, if one may live without
sin, it is mervaile never any did; still they urge Christ's Mother; she lived
without sin, was borne without it, some say conceived without it too: that
they say is not de fide, and indeed it is not fit that every John Duns should
increase the Churches creed, for he was the first that forged that paradox: But
if Christ's Mother, why not his Father too? was he not the son of David? then
had the Psalmist spared this speech, and I my pains at least in this point; he
might have in the peoples name said, our sin, not my sin; in earnest sooth,
the Papist must correct Magnificat, or grant our Lady was a sinner; for calls
she not her son her savior? My spirit (says she) rejoices in God my
Savior; Christ was called so, the Angel says, because he should save his
people from their sin; Christ was not Mary's Savior if Mary had no sin.

In Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, chap. 11. v. 32. page 414. this
sentence is blotted out: the Virgin Mary had him in her womb that had no sin,
yet she had sin in herself, and was reproved by our savior.

And page 292. after will be like God, this clause is blotted out: Pardon the
Papists that mount Christ's Mother above the Angels; she has deserved it, she
bare God, it is fit she should sit beside her son: Matter jube filium, she
may command him too; Schoolmen were not first founders of this pride, 'twas
long before them, what Gods propriety.

45. Passages expunged against Popish Monkery Vows, Stews, and Incontinency
of their Monks and Clergy.
THese clauses are deleted in Doctor Clerks Sermons page 341. with Papists
Oration, is Aratio, they work as at the Plough; men pray almost all day,
Monastery rise in the night too.

Ibid. page 371. What meant that Monk that said Rominizare, was Sodomizare,
Rome was turned Sodom, the whole city.

Ibidem, page 218. Answ. 1. But the Monkish life is not persecution (except
thus, because the Locusts, which are no other but Monks and Friars) Revel. 16.
do bite and sting like Serpents, that is, do secretly wound men's consciences.
And four lines after An. 3. All go not to Christ that come into Monasteries,
but rather go from him; they living after another rule then Christ's, for
Francis their great founder erected a new sect of Monkery, and found out a new
rule for them, which he called Regulam Evangelicam, the rule of the Gospel, as
though Christ's rule were not sufficient.

And page 309. Thirdly, so the Papists being ignorant of the way of salvation,
sometimes run unto the Mass, sometimes enter into diverse Orders of
Monasteries, staggering like a drunken man, too and fro, not knowing what way
they should take to come into Heaven.

46. A Passage crossed out against mixing the Sacramental wine with water.
THis clause is purged out in Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew page 380. Wine
and blood cannot be both in the Sacrament corporally and substantially, as the
Papists teach: It is controverted between us and the Church of Rome, whether
the Wine in the Lords Supper be to be mixed with water, or pure Wine to be
administered? and they say it is to be mixed with water; and we deny not, but
that of ancient times, in hot Countries, especially where their Wine was
strong, they used to mix water with wine in their common drink, and thereupon
so used it in the Sacrament: but now to put water into the wine at the
Sacrament, when it is not ordinarily so used or drank, we hold it to be an
Antichristian custom, and contrary to Christ's institution, as appears by this
argument; Christ in his last Supper gave wine and not water to be drank, for he
calls it, the fruit of the Vine, which is wine and not water, Matthew. 26. 29.
etc.

47. Passages purged out concerning the Ministers doing their duty in Praying,
frequent Preaching of the Word, the peoples diligent hearing of the Word
preached, etc.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew page 41. this clause is obliterated:
Mending their Nets.

Quest. What is observable in these Nets?

Answ. Note here two things in them, viz. First Lead, that is, the ponderous
denuniiation and menaces of the law: Secondly, Cork, and that is the sweet and
comfortable promises of the Gospel, teaching us, that the preaching of the
Word should be fitted to the capacity and disposition of the hearers, and that
in a threefold regard; as first in regard of the time, it must be preached in
season and out of season, 2 Timothy 4. 2. and secondly, in regard of the object,
to every creature, Mark 16. 10. etc. thirdly, in regard of the manner, milk
must be given to Babes, and strong meat to men; the weak must be strengthened,
the obstinate reproved; the ignorant instructed, the erroneous reduced into the
way of truth, and the wicked reclaimed from their evil ways.

Quest, Wherein must the Preachers of the Word, principally labor in the
preaching of the Word?

Answ. In these two things: First, to sink to the bottom the Net with the
weight of Lead, by diving, penetrating, sounding and descending into the
intrals, bowels and lowest vaults of the heart, because otherwise they cannot
catch those who are hid and drowned in the mudde and earth; they must reveal
and make known the wrath of the Lord against all iniquity and wickedness of
men (Romans 18.) that sinful men by flying from, and forsaking their sins, may
avoid the wrath of God.

Secondly, when they have truly humbled their hearers with the judgment
pronounced and denounced against them for their sins, they must then raise
them up to the top with cork, which brings the upper side of the net above
water; they must be comforted and cherished by the promises of the Word, least
otherwise the sight of their sins and sense of Gods wrath, drive them to
despair: and these two, lead and cork, are carefully to be observed and
handled; for first, sinners must be cast down, then raised up: That Net needs
no cork that has no lead, nor those hearers comfort who never lamented for
their sins; and therefore, first, Ministers must show the people the anger of
God against sin, Romans i. 17. 18. then secondly, the righteousness of faith,
Romans 3. 21. First, ordinarily comes the spirit of bondage, which sinks the
soul to the bottom of sorrow, and then seasonably is held forth the spirit of
adoption (Romans 8. 15.) and the evangelicall promises which raise up the soul
from the pit of hell: a^ cork without lead, and comfort without lamentation,
leads to presumption, so lead without cork loses the net in the mudde and
earth; and therefore our concord must be mixed with discord, and our creble
with bases; we must in our preaching sing of mercy and judgment, mixing
threatenings with promises, and weaving, inter-la^cing promises with terrors (as
the Lord himself does through the whole book of the Scripture) if we desire to
fish, that we may catch many souls for an offering unto the Lord, for he
fisheth in vain whose net wants either lead or cork.

Ibidem on Matthew. 13. 55. written copy 261. this is dashed out.

Quest. Who are unfit or unworthy to take the calling of the Ministry upon
them?

Answ. First, those who being arrogant and proud for their learning and parts,
thi^ themselves worthy to be preferred before others: Secondly, those who make
a (...) of Religion for base and worldly respects and ends only: Thirdly,
those who are ^^dued only with a fox-like wit and craft, and subtle policy:
Fourthly, those who ^^ light and aerie in their preaching, seeking therein
nothing more then popular appla^^ and praise: Fifthly, those who do not
prefer the advancement of Religion and pr^pagation of the Gospel, before all
humane things: If the Reader desire to see the^ answers and particulars
amplified and much enlarged, let him read Chemuit. Har^ fol. 893.

Ibidem page 38. this is deleted. Thirdly, as the fish gain nothing except
they be taken with the hook, so preaching profits not the hearers, except tha^
obey what is preched; and therefore great is their misery who neglect the
preaching of the Word; for first, from such the Vineyard shall be taken away;
and secondly, the wrath of God shall abide upon, and remain with them; yea,
thirdly, the Word preached, and the empty feats, will rise up in judgment at
the last day; and therefore man had better neglect pleasure, riches, honor,
meat, health, yea, life it self, tha^ the preaching of the Word; for what will
momentary pleasure or uncertain rices or vvorldly honor, or food or health,
or life, profit us, if we lose our precious soul^ (of more vvorth then all
these) eternally. In fishers we must consider, besides th^^ knowledge and
diligence, these two things, to wit, the place and maine scope. First the
place where they fish, and herein we may observe, first, that they must be in
many places, for sometimes fishers are in one place or part of the sea,
sometimes in another, as we see in Christ and his Apostles, Mark 1. 38.
Secondly, there are fisher^ (...) in the uttermost parts of the world; so
Ministers must follovv Gods cal^ though (...) to go to foreign parts, their
line went through all the world: Thirdly (...) make long journeys, go much
ground, fail far in the sea for a fevv fishes: ^ Ministers preach long for
the vvinning of a fevv souls. Secondly, in fishes we may (...) the maine
scope; wherein note, that servants fish not for themselves, but for their
Masters; so Ministers must wooemen for God, not for themselves, and labor to
gain souls that they may be presented as pure and chaste Virgins unto the Lord
(2 cor. 11. 2.) as Eleazer vvooed Rebecca for Isaac not for himself, and
continued soliciting her until she consented to go with him; so the
Ministers of God must first labor not for an hour, but until they have gained
some souls unto the Lord their Master; and secondly, they must labor not for
their own sakes, but for their peoples, yea, for Gods sake, that is, for Gods
glory, and their salvation; and thirdly, the Ministers may be said to labor
for their own sakes too, for it is true, ye are my Crown and my glory, as the
Apostle says (Phil. 4. 1. and 1 These 4. 19. 20.) yea, the Epistle which is
written in our heart (2 Cor. 3. 2.) and if you stand fast, then we live, 1
These. 3. 8.

Ibidem page 40. The Church of God is sometimes compared to the Sea, and then
the Ministers are the Pilots of the Ship, and the fishers in that Sea; and
therefore if our names imply labor, and cur calling import industry, then
Non-residents are not to be commended, if they absent themselves from their
flocks, for their lucre or easesake, and not upon some urgent and weighty
affairs (for a time) which may be as profitable for the Church of God; Paul
labored night and day, and Christ prayed, not that drones and idle persons,
but that laborers might be sent into his harvest.

Ibidem page 328. Answ. 2. Christ here only reproves the ambitions
affectation of the Pharisees, who delighted much to be called Fathers (when the
Pharisees sat in Moses Chair, then they might call them fathers; that is, so
long as they taught the truth) but when they were not directly subordinate unto
God, and affected that which was due only to him, then they were not to be
counted as Fathers; mark here the opposition, call no man your Father, for one
is your Father in Heaven: If the earthly Father be subordinate to the Heavenly,
then ye may call them father; but when they affect that which is due to the
heavenly Father, to whom belongs the Kingdom, the power and the glory; then
call them not Fathers.

Ibidem printed book, fol. 170. written copy, fol. 82. They mis-apply the Word,
who, first, sow pillowes under men's elbowes; secondly, but principally, they
who make sad the hearts of those by their preaching, whom God has not made
sad: such are those at this day, who have smooth tongues, in respect of sin,
and yet are full of bitter invectives against the better sort; some hate the
preaching of the Word, and therefore hate and abuse the Preachers thereof;
whence it comes to pass, first, that some Ministers are partly fearful, and
so forbear preaching, that by so doing they may decline hatred, persecution,
and reviling speeches: Secondly, some are partly weary, etc.

Ibidem printed book, fol. 178. written copy fol. 79. Quest. How must we so
preach that God may gain glory thereby?

Answ. It is done three manner of ways (viz.) either first, by preaching the
glorious works of God, and that either first, his eternal works or decrees
which were from all eternity; as namely, first, the creation of the Universe;
secondly the predestinating of some unto salvation, from the corrupt mass of
mankind fallen in Adam; thirdly, our redemption by Christ; fourthly, the
preparation of celestial glory: Secondly, his works done in time; which are
either first, temporal; as first, the preservation of the whole world;
secondly, the protection of man, least he should lack any good thing, or be
harmed by any evil thing, etc.

Ibidem printed book, fol. 490. written copy fol. 298. A knowing Minister can
better direct people to come out of their sins, etc.

Page 29. book fol. 9. written copy 262. They being converted, must convert
their brethren the Gentiles. Answ. 8. The final cause why the Apostles were
sent unto Israel was, that so their obstinacy and hard-heartednesse might be
perfected and ripened unto judgment; and therefore although the Samaritanes
were more ready to hear and embrace the Gospel then the Jews (as appears by
John 4. and Act. 8) yet Christ sends it to those who are most backward and
difficultly persuaded (yea who will not be persuaded) to embrace it, that so
their sins may be full and mature unto harvest: Hence observe, that the
preaching of the Word is often sent unto many for their destruction; this
evidently appears thus, to wit, first from these places, Jer. 7. 27. Ezekiel. 2.
35. and 3. 6. etc. Matthew. 24. 34. John 15. 22. 24. Act. 13, 46. and 7. 22. and
1 These. 2. 15. Secondly, because thus the justice and anger of God is
justified, 2 (hron. 36. 16. Romans 10. 21. Prove. 1. 24. Thirdly, because it is
the nature of the Word to harden as well as soften, like the Sun which
hardens mire, as well as softens wax; for the Word is a light, and therefore
where that shines men cannot sin in darkness; and when men sin against
light and conscience, then judgment is near, even at the door, etc.

48. Passages deleted against Murder in Magistrates, Princes, and others.
IN Doctor Clerks Sermons in the Sermon on Innocents day, page 81. l. 5. After
these words, but only Malefactors, should follow this deleted clause: These
were not; nay, slay they may not any man, that term is odious; justice loves
no slaughter: capital offenders Kings may put to death, but they may not slay
men; I may not be peremptory before so learned hearers, who can judge better
then I; I will not say certainly, but I will say happily, the Evangelist used
this word of purpose to make the act the more erroneous: Murder in a
Magistrate, in a King to slay: Uriahs death plotted by David, David's self
blood, Psalm. 51. Blood and murder are synonimous; the Prophet expressly calls
Ahab a murderer, 2 King. 6. for Naboths death: The sword of justice smites it
slayes not in Scripture phrase: Nay, a King may not slay, not a delinquent; if
in his passion either himself, or his men at his command, shall shed his
blood, it is flat homicide; he might have sentenced him to dye, but his private
sword may not kill any; Saul's Javelin thrown at Jonathan or David, had it killed
either it had been murder, yea though they had been trespassers, and their
crime never so capital.

In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew fol. 110. this is expunged: There is an
excuseable homicide, which is either casual, etc. or sudden and strange: Now
this is gathered from Numb. 35. 17, 18. where the Lord says, if he smite him
with throwing a stone (whereby he may dye) and he dye, etc. and if he smite him
with an hand weapon of wood (wherewith he may dye) etc. as if he would say, if
he chance to kill him with a stone or a piece of wood, which there was no fear
or likelihood would kill him, then he should be quit and not dye: But here is a
threefold doubt or scruple will arise, which I confess I am not able to
resolve; viz. First, whether such indulgence, pardon, or exemption from
punishment, be altogether to be granted to him who thus unexpectedly kills
his Neighbor, or whether this execution can be collected out of this place?
Secondly, if such a freedom from punishment be here to be understood, then
whether the blow wherewith the party was killed, be to be understood of a
stroke that was given in anger or in jest? Thirdly, whether by the blow which
was given, be understood a stroke not mortal for the present, but a blow
whereof the party long languisheth, and at last dies?

49. That Christ is our sole Mediator, not Saints and Angels, and against
prayer to Saints, deleted.
IN Doctor Clerks Sermons, page 191. l. 24. after these words has it often,
should follow this expunction: This provideth too against popery; God has made
Christ the only Mediator, the sole means of grace, of all his gifts
whatsoever; Papists add to him too more, merits of men, and intercession of
Saints; horrible sacrilege to rob Christ of his right; he is our Intercessor;
if not, yet blasphemy to disable him, he belike is unsufficient, they put into
his office the Saints, as Coadjutors: they be his fellow advocates; he is weak
alone, or they think him very proud: He is our Mediator, but they must make
means to him, his Mother must entreat him: Entreat? command her son; jure
Matris impera: they are not worthy the answering; what prayer is not made in
his name is sin.

And page 200. l. 19. After these words Saint Peter to his Master, should
follow. Protestants, some like not of the Liturgy; they say it is Popery: surely
they mistake: it is a wonder the Papist censure it not rather, that they call it
not Calvinisme, or the Teregamus Domine: and Christ have mercy upon us; because
we pray in it immediately to Christ.

50. That Nature used well and improved, is a means to obtain Grace, and
greater graces then before. Expunged.
IN Master Ward's Comentary upon Mat. 25. 14. p. 355. Object. Some object these
words to prove, That God will give greater graces unto him, or bestow greater
upon him, who has well used the light of nature. Answ. By those Talents are
here understood the gifts of God, and especially the knowledge of God by the
Gospel; which knowledge he is said to hide, who does detain the truth in
unrighteousness, and does keep in the known truth. This Talent therefore
cannot be that sufficient grace, which (they say) does happen to Infidels and
unregenerate persons; but that grace which God does bestow upon his domestical
servants. Neither by him who has, is understood a man in his mere naturals,
or some heathen man, furnished with sufficient grace; but a man furnished with
the knowledge of the Gospel, which is given to me for that end, that by
edifying his neighbor he might spread the knowledge far abroad, and like money
put to use, it might be increased with daily additions.

51. Passages deleated concerning Original Sin.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Mat. 3. ver. 10. this is expunged, written copy,
fol. 21, Every tree therefore that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down
and cast into the fire. Argum. The Papists say that for original guilt only,
we are not guilty at all of Hel-fire; and therefore Infants dying before the
commiting of actual sin shall not be damned or punished, poena sensue, with
any sensible punishment. Now against this, these words may be thus aptly
objected; Every tree which brings forth not good fruit, it hewn down and
cast into the fire; but Infants who are without the Covenant, are trees
obnoxious of original sin, which brings forth no good fruit; therefore
Infants that are without the Covenant, being guilty of original sin, shall be
cut down and cast into the fire, etc.

The Papists say, that those who are only guilty of original sin, shall
not be punished poena sensue, with any sensible torments after this life.
Against which Tenet this Text is thus aptly objected, All Chafe is to be
burnt with eternal fire, which is a sensible torment; but whosoever are
poluted with original sin, and not purged by the blood of Christ, are
chafe; therefore they shall be burnt with eternal fire, which is a sensible
torment. The major proposition is proved from this verse, He will burn up the
chafe with unquenchable fire. The minor proposition is confirmed thus: It is
necessary that such as are poluted with original sin, and not purged by the
blood of Christ are either Chafe or Wheat (and this the Papists I hope will
not deny:) but they are not Wheat, because they are not gathered into the
Garner) for they say that such as dye before Baptism, are not made partakers
of the joys of Heaven:) and therefore they are Chafe prepared for the fire.

52. Deleted clauses against the Oath ex Officio and forced Oaths.
IN Master Ward's written Comentary on Mat. p. 138. this Discourse is purged
out: Faulty, they are faulty here, who injuriously constrain men to swear:
and this is twofold, namely, first, when men are forced to swear against
themselves: this is injurious, no man being bound to betray himself; In
criminalibus, licet in contractibus, not in criminal offenses, but in
contracts and bargains: for an oath may lawfully be administered and given unto
a man, to answer whether he made any such bargain or covenant (as is aledged)
or not; but it never used to a thief or murderer: for in criminal offenses
witnesses must come in against a man, or he is acquitted by Law, and is never
put to his oath to accuse himself. Secondly, Men are injuriously constrained
to take an oath, De rebus ignotis, to answer they know not to what. This was
altogether disliked and disalowed by that famous Martyr John Lambert, in his
answer to the Bishops fourteenth Article, Fox fol. 1119. whereunto I refer
the Reader. Fifthly, all rash swearers, etc. Fol. 139. Swear not at all. Object.
Sixtus Senensis, and some other Papists say, that Christ here sets down a
council of perfection, not forbidding all swearing, but rather wishing that
men could so live in faith, love and truth, that there might be not use of an
oath. Answ. 1. First, this is false, because Christ's words are not perswasory,
but prohibitory, expressly forbidding swearing. Ibid. fol. 239. b. fine. Que. 4.
Whether it be lawful to force one to swear? Answ. 1. First, a Magistrate may
impose an oath, with these (three) limitations: first, if the thing be weighty:
secondly, if otherwise it cannot be known: thirdly, if it be not a snare to
catch a man's self, or a trick to make him accuse himself. Answ. 2. Secondly,
Magistrates should be very wary how they enforce or constrain men to swear;
because, first, oftentimes they thus add fuel unto the fire of Gods wrath, by
making men forswear themselves; and therefore here it should be considered, if
it were not better to lose the thing in question, then to hazard the loss of
our Brothers soul, by making him to perjure himself. Paul would rather never
eat flesh while he lived, then offend his brother; and therefore he is far from
Paul his charity, who for a thing of small value or moment, will drive his
brother to perjury. Secondly, if thou believe him when he swear, why vvilt
thou not believe him, if he take some solemn protestation? An honorable person
being called into the Senate at Athens to depose touching some matters, the
Senators would not have him to take the accustomed oath, knowing him to be a
virtuous and honest man, Cicero orat. pro Balto. Thus except the matter be of
very weighty importance, we should consider, First, if he whom we desire
should be put to his oath, fear the Lord, then he dare no more lie then
forswear himself, Secondly, if he fear not the Lord, then how will he fear to
forswear himself? And thus both Magistrates, and those who are vvronged
should be very careful not to constrain any offender to swear, if by any other
means the matter may be known or decided.

53. A Passage obliterated against popish Pardons, Indulgences and Purgatory.
IN Mr. Ward's Comentary on Mat. p. 179. written copy, this is crossed out as
hetrodox. We have no need of a second purging. (How derogatory then are the
Papists to the sufferings of Christ, who ascribe more to the Pope^ pardons,
then to Christ's pangs? Antichrist by his Indulgences, can both deliver and
preserve from Purgatory, and send the soul straight unto heaven; but they
will dye in the quarrel, before they will grant such or so much power and
efficacy to be in the death, bloodshed and merits of Christ, etc.

54. The very name of Papists expunged, with a passage against the Popes power.
IN Doctor Clerke's Sermon upon Candlemas day, page 95. line 14. The Papists
say. page 166. l. 7. let Papists hold, etc. p. 171. l. 7. This Manuel, but the
Papists take advantage of that. page 200. l. 16: Papists hold it. p. 224, l.
38. A Papist, p. 299. l. 5. 9. Papists say; Papists make. p. 330. l. 16. even
by Papists, who extenuate sin, are blotted out* The like is frequently done
in Doctor Jones his Comentary on the Hebrews, and in M. Ward's Com. on Matthew;
where p. 395. there is this notable passage purged out; Christ says, unto me
is given all power: therefore (Antichrists imp) Carerius says, The Pope has
power over Infidels. All power was given to Christ, therefore to the Pope, is
a blasphemous Antichristian consequence, displaying the Pope in his colors to
be the Whore, in making himself, or suffering himself to be made equal with
Christ.

55. A Clause expunged against Popish Penance.
IN Master Ward, page 34. this clause is obliterated. Fifthly, Bellarmines
Argument follows not, as appears by this instance; Papists say, their Penance
is the second table after shipwreck; now she that sins not needs not this
Penance; but the Adulteress is admitted unto it; is therefore the Adulteress
better then the Innocent, because she is made partaker of the second Table,
which the other is not? No more is she for the second Husband.

56. Passages expunged against Perseverance in Grace.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Mat. 24. 13. He that endured to the end, etc.
this passage is rased out, He that endures unto the end, etc. We may learn
hence, that patience in persecution and affliction, is not praise-vvorthy,
except it be permanent and endure unto the end. How does this appear? First,
evidently by these places and proofs, Mat. 10. 22. Luke 21. In patience
possess your souls. Heb. 3. 6. and 6. 11. etc. unto the 15. and 12. 3. 12.
and Jam, 5. 7. unto the 12. And secondly, because without this perseverance
we shall have noreward. He who digges for Gold, must continue diging until
he come to the vein or oar, else he loses his labor. He who is upon a
journey or race must continue therein until he has vvon his wager, or
reached his journies end. He who is fighting a Duel, must stand upon his guard
and vvithstand his antagonist, yea continue coragiously to oppose him, until
he have got the victory, otherwise all he does at first onset is nothing. The
Israelites went out of Egypt and yet never came to Canaan; and many begin
well, who for want of perseverance fall short of their reward. What is here
required of us? To labor to persevere and abide rightly armed against all
temptations and trials whatsoever, even unto the end. How must we do this.
Answ. By these vvayes and means, to wit; First, our ingresse into the lists
must be living and solid, and not sleeping or dead; for otherwise we can never
endure to the end. Secondly, we must not love but leave and relinquish the
world, 1 John 2. 15. for otherwise we shall never be able to hold out against
the assaults of the world. Thirdly, we must be trained soldiers, and
exercise our selves daily in the Lords lists; that is, we must frequently give
our selves; 1. to meditation: 2. to the hearing of Gods word: 3. to the
practice of piety: 4. to the opposing and resisting of iniquity, and all manner
of wickedness: and 5. to the strengthening and corroborating of our faith by
the Word and Sacraments. Fourthly, we must principally exercise our patience
and labor that it may have its perfect work in us. Who can be always
patient, or endure patient in persecution and affliction unto the end? They can
who have not placed their hope in this life or any thing therein, but live in
Christ, and place all their hope and confidence in him, Colos. 3. 3. 4.

In the same Comentary on Mat. p. 277. written copy, this whole discourse is
obliterated. The words in this place; The gates of hell shall never prevail
against it: ser^e us as a strong rock to build perseverance of grace and faith
upon, both against the Papists, Pelagians, Socinians, and others: For here our
Savior plainly promises, that against those which build their faith upon this
rock Christ, the gates of hell, and power of satan, shall never prevail. To
this Socinus (in tractatu, de loco; tu es Petrus) answers, That these words of
Christ's are not so to be understood, as though the Devil could not prevail
against any of the members of the true Church of Christ: but, that so long as
they are the true members thereof, it is impossible that they should be hardened
by Satan or hell; that is, he promises to the Church, so long as it remains
the Church of Christ, that the power of death shall not so prevail against it,
that it come into condemnation: but he does not understand by the gates of
hell, the craft, deceit and fraud of Satan, whereby he labors to seduce and
enthrall some. Hereunto we answer; first, whatsoever is an adversary to the
building of the Church upon the Rock, or to the constant adhering of the Church
unto Christ, that is understood by the prevailing gates of hell, (for in these
words he removes the contrary of that which before he had laid down; upon this
Rock will I build my Church:) but the fraudulent and crafty temptations of
Satan, which are effectual or of force, to seduce or enthrall the faithful
are principal enemies to this building of the Church, and constant adhering
unto Christ; and therefore these crafty and subtle tentations are understood
by the gates of hell. Secondly, whatsoever comes out of the gates of hell, or
has its beginning from thence, that is here understood by this phrase of the
gates of hell; but the temptations of Satan are hatched in hell, and come from
thence; therefore they are here meant by the gates of hell. Thirdly, if the
condemnation of the faithful only be understood here, by the gates of hell,
then this promise may stand with the total failing or falling away of the
Church militant; (for then he should promise nothing to the militant members of
the Church, but only to the dead, who dye in faith:) but this is repugnant to
the intention of Christ in this place, and to the interpretation of all
Writers, and the opinion of all Christians. Fourthly, Saint Peter himself,
unto whom our Savior here speaks, seems otherwise to interpret these words
then Socinus does, 1 Pet. 2, 7, 8. where the Apostle teaches, that unbeleevers
and disobedient persons, who stumble at Christ and are offended with him, do
belong unto those gates, which do impugn and assault that building which
consists of living stones, and is founded upon the corner stone and true rock,
Jesus Christ. Fifthly, the proportion or analogy ought to be observed, which our
Savior here intimates and implies, betwixt two Cities; the one of heaven,
which has her gates and keys, verse 19. and the other of hell; which by the
gates of her plots, practices and provocations do seek the ruin of the
heavenly city. Now in this place our Savior promises (and would have us to
believe it upon his word, that none of the plots, projects, assaults or
batteries of the gates of hell shall prevail against the heavenly City, the
Church. And therefore seeing one City is opposed to the other, and the gates of
the one to the gates of the other; and the one (viz. the Church) is considered
in the state and condition of her present building; it is very requisite that
the other should respect her present impugning and assaulting of the other; and
consequently, the craft, deceit, and fraud of Satan, whereby he labors to
seduce, enthrall and deceive the members of the Church.

Ibidem p. 201. Christ is Never (the Licenser makes it semetimes) absent from
his children; and then blots out this ensuing clause; For he loves them unto
the end, Joh. 13. 1, yea, promises to be with them unto the end, Mat. 28. 20.
yea, dwells in them by his spirit, 1 Cor. 3. 16. and ^ Cor. 6. 16. but yet he
seems sometimes to be absent. And pa. 57. Professors are odious unto the
world, and derided, scoffed and taunted at by the world; but the comfort is,
that they are dear unto God, and precious in the sight of Christ, who will
acknowledge them to be his, when he does deny and utterly disclaim those their
mockers and despisers. And thus the Lord has particular consolations for all
particular sorts of his servants: And 12. lines after; They stand or fall to
their own Master; yea, they shall stand, and none (neither sin or Satan)
shall be able to pluck them out of Christ's hand, John 10. 18.

57. Passages purged out against the Popish Pyx and Transubstantiation.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew. page 341. there is this deletion. Que.
Who may be meant there, or to whom may these words be fitly applied? Answ. These
words of our Saviors do nearly touch the Papists, for they can point with
their fingers, and say, here is Christ, and there is Christ: Behold, in this
Pyx are three Christ's, in that five, in that seven, in that more; therefore it
is likely that Christ gives us this special watchword, and such others,
Believe them not.

Quest. What does our Savior forewarne us of here?

Answ. We have in this verse a charge from Christ, that if those Impostors, the
Papists, should say unto us of him; behold, he is in secret places or closets,
we should not believe it; and this is most appliable unto them who tell us;
that Christ is to be found in a Pyx, and think that they have him in safe
custody, under lock and key.

59. Passages deleted against Prayer to Saints; Popish Prayers; the Merit of
Prayer; praying first for spiritual things; and praying toward the East.
In Doctor Clerks Sermons page 140. l. 12. after yea, and then, the Licenser
has expunged this following sentence: The Papists are foulely befoold, who
have prayed so long to Saints, being but damned spirits, and all in hell.

Ibid. page 219. l. 6. after that word mostly, this is deleted: Frayers,
Papists say Saints pray; they want naught themselves, but pray for us; they
there fore pray to them; proof from Scripture they press but very poor;
feign to fetch instance from hell: Dives prayed for his brethren: Bellarmine's
reason, worthy a Cardinals hat, Happily.

In Master Wards Comentary on Matthew page 82. this is gelded out: When a
Papist prays to any Saint in heaven; for sometimes they pray to those, who in
all probability are in hell, as Thomas Becket, Hildebrand, and diverse cheating
impostors.

Ibip. page 164. 161. 168. 169. this is deleted: Let those therefore who call
upon the name of the Lord, depart from all iniquity, and let them labor to
abound in all virtues, both moral and theological, that so our profession may
be praised both of profane and civil men.

Thirdly, the Papists have Rimes, which must be said over three or four times
every day; certainly with a little pains a man might make a good Parret, a
good Papist, for he might be taught all this; therefore they were forced to cry
much and long.

The Papists say, prayer is a Meritorious work, as has been elsewhere showed;
Against which, we urge this place thus; we must not pray as the heathen did,
for they thought to be heard for the merit of their long prayers: therefore it
becomes not Christians to pray with any opinion to be heard. Answ. 2.
Spiritual graces are to be demanded before temporal good. Thirdly, we have no
true right unto temporal things, nor proper interest in them, nor any true
warrant to beg them, until we be converted; and therefore temporal things are
not first to be desired: Our Savior teaches only those to pray for temporal
blessings, that can call God father, as we see in the preface of the Lords
Prayer, which we cannot do aright until we be converted.

Ibidem page 341. this is deleted; Object. It is controverted betwixt us and
the Papists, concerning the forms of Churches; and Bellarmine affirms, that
they should be built East and West, that so when we pray therein, our faces
might be turned toward the East: and for the proose hereof, he produces this
place; Ab orient venturus ereditur ad judicium; It is believed that Christ
will come unto judgment from the East, therefore we ought to pray toward the
East.

Answ. First, creditur, it is believed (says he) namely, by those who can
believe what they list, though never so absurd, etc. See page 299.

60. Passages obliterated concerning Predestination, Gods Decree and
Reprobation. See Election, page 303.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, in the written copy fol. 172. this clause
is expunged. How is the Kingdom of God attained unto? First, the foundation of
it is the eternal love of God. Secondly, from this love proceeds the Decree
of Predestination. Thirdly, from this Decree follows Redemption wrought by
Christ. Fourthly, thence follows the Promises of the Gospel, applying Christ
to our hearts. Fistly, and lastly, follows Faith, which apprehends both the
Promises and Christ.

What reason can there be that God should prepare vessels unto dishonor? How
can God create men to destroy them? I Answer. Neither is reason dumb here, but
can speak something in Gods behalf: viz. First we for our food kill Sheep,
Oxen, Birds and Foul, who never wronged us; yea, for this end we fat and cram
them, although we did not create them. How much more then may God destroy a
creature which he has made, and for his glory pass by a man who has
infinitely offended him? Secondly, Artificers often make pieces of work and
break them again, for the praise of their skill and Art, why then may not the
Lord do so? Obj. God gave nothing unto man but a being, therefore it was
unjust to do more unto him, then to take away his being. God who created man
of nothing or of earth, might justly have reduced him again to his first
matter, but not make him worse then he was: now to be damned is much worse then
not to be. I answer. Artificers and Craftsmen make vessels for their own
service, yea even to serve for base offices, and that for a long time, yea even
for ever, if they and their vessels could endure for ever. And therefore why
should we dispute against God? Saint Paul durst not do it, Romans 9. 13. etc.
What reason is there that God should condemn us for Adams fault? Reason
answers, That for treason against the King, the Father is beheaded, and the
children disinherited; yea, because old Wolves and Foxes endanger and injure
us, therefore we kill the young ones that never harmed us because they are of a
ravenous nature also, and will do hurt if they live; why then should we plead
against God? etc. See more of this Sect. 25. concerning Election.

In Doctor Clerk's Sermons page 91. l. 12. after these words, Saint Ambrose
does warrant it, should follow this large discourse of Predestination, which
the Licenser has totally expunged. I will not be peremptory in so perplex a
Question as is Predestination; I will say as I conceive it, and submit me to
your censure. In the great Council in Heaven (why name I heaven? heaven was
not yet) God meaning to make manifest both his justice and his grace to the
world, which he purposed to create in time, for the glory of them, both out of
the whole mass of man, selected some, and refused the rest: whom his mercy
pretermitted those his justice predessigned unto damnation, but whom his love
elected, those his grace ordained to final salvation: The Tragic Poet could
say, God whom he loves, he saves; what then his grace fore-purposeth, his
power in time effects, and his wisdom manages and marshalleth all the
means; salvation only is the end intended by his grace, but the means are
many, that might come between: Grace has a golden chain of many links,
salvation the last, but so fastened to his fellows, that it cannot fail;
adoption, redemption regeneration vocation, justification, sanctification:
adoption to the right and title of Gods sons, redemption from death,
regeneration by baptism, vocation by the Gospel, justification by faith,
sanctification by the spirit, all these Paul has omitted, and named but the
last, both as the most comfortable, and to which all the rest do purposely
tend: Damnation is the doom decreed to the reprobate; Gods justice sentenceth
them, but how and in what order, I list not to discourse, for offending of weak
consciences: For the execution of which sentence, there was ordained death and
hell, and satan, and the evil day; death to attend them, hell to enjoy them,
satan to torment them, and the evil day to judge and deliver them; The Elect
also do deserve that doom; Gods curse is justly incurred by their sin, but
Gods goodness traveled with good, which decreed they should be saved: Ask me
not the Question why God Almighty dealt not equally with all? It is already
answered; God is just as well as gracious: Had he saved all, where then were
his justice? had he damned all, where then were his grace? Reply not in thy
reason, that God had he so pleased, might have been both just and gracious, and
yet have saved all: for Christ who satisfied his Father for the Elect, might
also have so done (had he pleased) for the Reprobates: Alas! besides, why made
God choice of thee, and not of me? I must answer with Saint Paul, O homo tu
quis est, Who art thou O man, that presumest to plead with God? has not the
Potter power to make vessels of his clay to what use himself lists? As clay
is to the Potter, so is man to God; he will have mercy on whom he will have
mercy. This project of Gods gracious love has caused the Scripture by elegant
Antonomosie to cast the name of it upon the means of it; Christ called not
only a Savior, but salvation; Mine eyes (says old Simeon) have seen my
salvation; yea not Christ only, that procured it, but the Gospel also that
proclaims it; it is called Gods salvation, Acts 28. 28. for the Gospel is the
word of it; Paul calls it so, and Christ is the horn of it, old Zachary calls
him so, a project worthy, etc.

61. Passages purged out against popish Purgations of sin by other means
then Christ's blood, and against Purgatory.
IN Doctor Clerks Sermons, page 23. l. 13. After these words Gregory Naz. the
Lycenser has expunged these lines following; Satisfaction's a Purgation too, a
Popish one: the Alms of the living effectually purge for the sins of the
dead. The Saints intercession, I think another too: the prayers of the dead
for the sins of the living; and why not their blood too as well as Christ's?
Tu per Thomae sanguinem. Beckets blood is not so dry a drug as Christ's; happily
it will work better. Indulgences are another, the Popes too, he has a great
facility in that kind of physic. The Mass another, a strong purgative. Paul
said, all purging is by blood; the Mass has none, it is incruenta hostea
(themselves so term it) an oblation without blood. A suppe of the Chalice, or
a kiss of the Pax, offering to an Image, or creeping to a Cross, Pilgrimage,
Oil, Holy Water, purgers of sin; all, I think, all Popery is a purge: What
mean the Priers flagellant, who whip their bodies, but to purge their sins
with their own blood, set scourgers to be self purgers, happily they will not
be beholding unto Christ's The Prophet says, By his stripes we are healed, but
they think they are by theirs: shall I press these purgers with this fourth
term of my Text, per simetipsum, by himself, they will fly unto the second,
and say, Paul said not, he had purged. All say sins before Baptism are purged
by him, but those we act after it must be purged by others: by the Pope, the
Priests, our friends, or our selves, by pardons, penance. Mass, good works:
New Romanists old Montanistes: even Aquinas himself puts but Original sin
only to Christ's purging, Actual to the Mass; But you heard what point
before, that Saint John was Paul's Paraphrast 1 John 1. 7. he says, The blood
of Christ cleanses from all sin; but yet that Alms purge sin, they find
in Tobia's History, whence they may ground good manners, but not faith; but
Solomon says it too, Prove. 15. 21. and that book is canonical: that book, but
not this verse; it is a bastard Scripture, foisted in by some forgery; the
Hebrew Text has it not.

Ibid. page 200. l. 16. after unworthy of Christ's presence, these words are put
out: they will rather go to Purgatory.

62. Passages obliterated concerning preaching, its end and frequency.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, these clauses are deleted, written copy
fol. 239. Observe. 3. The Apostles gently persuade and admonish, that so Christ
may be planted in our hearts. Object. There is a double scope of the preaching
of the word, viz. a declaration of the mercy and anger of God, Romans 9. 22, 23.
and therefore the end and scope of all preaching is not to call men unto
salvation. An. Certainly, it is most true, that there is a double scope of
preaching, but the difference is in the Object, these differing in the Event,
not in the first scope of God, for the Lords scope is, that all should be
saved, Ezekiel. 18. 8. 1 Timothy 2. 4. and 2 Pet. 3. but his will is, that those who
will not be saved, should be damned; and therefore the Ministers of the Word of
God, in the preaching thereof, declare, pronounce and publish the wrath and
anger of God against all those who will not accept of the tender of mercy,
offered by him in his Word.

Observe. 5. Ministers are often calumniated for their zeal, industry in the
preaching of the Word. Quest. How does the truth of this appear? Answ. First,
natural and simple men would not have them labor at all, because a little
preaching is too much for them. But Secondly, they are ashamed to confess and
acknowledge this, and therefore they lay their fault either upon their Parsons,
or their manner of preaching: It is according to the Proverb, easy to find a
staff to beat a dog, and those who are ill affected to the Ministers of the
Word, will easily find something to tax them for; as for example; First, for
the person of the Minister, be he rich or poor, of noble or ignoble parentage,
old or young, learned or illiterate, or whatsoever, something malice can find
out to reproach him withal: Secondly, for the manner of preaching, let him
preach sweetly or sharply, often or seldom, out of the Word only, or else
also out of the Fathers and humane Authors, or howsoever, yet some aspersion
shall be cast upon him: Thirdly, for the manner of his life, be he severe and
more reserved, as was John, or humane, affable, and more familiar, as was
Christ, yet he shall not go without a censure, but shall either be called a
Devil, or a friend of wicked men.

Page 32. Observe. The most profitable preaching is to apply general doctrines
to particular persons, etc: Quest. Why is this manner of preaching most
profitable? Answ. First, because we regard not generals, hearing them only for
form, as though we heard the scenes or acts of a stage play. Answ. 2.
Secondly, because people are not able to apply general Doctrines to
themselves, and therefore they had need be applied unto them by the Ministers
who are able to do it. Answ. 3. Thirdly, because if people be able to apply
it, yet for the most part they mis-apply it, that is, they apply what they
hear to others, not to themselves, self-love so blinding their consciences,
that they cannot see their own faults, Luke 8. 11. John 9. 40. 41.

Ibidem printed book, fol. 92. and written copy fol. 224. on Matthew. 11. 15. 16.
Thou have hid these things from the wise. Quest. How does it appear that God
hides the knowledge of the Gospel from those who swell great with humane
wisdom?

Answ. First, it appears thus; because God takes away his helping hand from
unworthy persons, and that two manner of ways, to wit, First, sometimes
outwardly, by prohibiting the Pastors to preach, as Matthew. 10. 5. Act. 16. 7.
and sometimes inwardly, by not blessing the Word which is preached unto the
hearers thereof, etc.

Ibid. in the written copy p. 396. Quest. To whom does the preaching of the
Gospel properly belong?

Answ. The Ministry of the Word belongs properly to the Elect, Ephesians. 4. 11,
12. he gave Pastors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the
edifying of the body of Christ. Against this, this place is objected, the
preaching of the Gospel is sent unto all (Go and teach all Nations) and
therefore it does not properly belong unto the faithful.

Answ. 1. It is true, that we do, and must preach unto all, because the
Ministers of the Word, in the judgment of charity, must believe well of those
to whom they preach, leaving secret judgment unto the Lord: and Secondly, it
is preached properly unto the Elect to convert them, and only accidentally to
the Reprobates, as being inseparable, mixed with the other, as tares and chafe
are mixed with good corn, 2 Cor. 2. 16.

63. A Passage deleted against Ministers Reading their Sermons.
IN Doctor Clerks Sermons, page 404. l. 8. after these words. improperly so
called, these words are blotted out: A reading prophecy rises in the Church,
but fit to be prohibited, for it is not from the spirit, Prophetiza nobis
Christ, Matthew. 26. 28. Christ, read who has smitten thee; much a do is about
a reading Ministry; the King to name it, and the Bishops to suffer it; but
what shall we say of reading Prophecy? surely the Bishops are to blame to
suffer it; and yet the greater part of those who condemn reading Priests; are
themselves reading Priests; reading is no preaching, so they falsely say; but
their preaching is reading, so I may truly say.

64. Passages blotted out concerning the Sabbaths morality, perpetuity, strict
sanctification, and against the profanation of it.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, written copy page 201. this is deleted,
I came not to destroy the Law, etc.

It is here objected, that the Sabbath day was not moral; Christ would not
have altered it; for in this verse, he came not to dissolve the Law, but to
fulfill it.

Answ. The alteration of the day is no dissolving of the Law, no more then the
alteration of the several services, once in force by virtue of the second
Commandment, (as namely, circumcision, sacrifices, the Passover, and the
like) does abolish that Commandment.

Object. 2. It is objected again, Christ compares the Sabbath to a sacrifice,
Mat. 12. 7. therefore it is ceremonial.

Answ. Our Savior in that place uses a proverbiall speech, thereby showing,
that the greater duty must be preferred before the less; see Mat. 9. 33. where
the self-same speech is used, and yet there is no question of Ceremonies, but
only company keeping with Publicans and sianers: Dod upon the fourth
Commandment.

Ibidem page 110. this clause is gelded out: Some will not allow of all the
words of precept, according to the Letter; as for example: First, some divide
the Sabbath into two hours in the fore-noon, and two in the afternoon,
although they have no footing for it, either from the spiritual and literal
meaning of the fourth Commandment: Secondly, other can distinguish, etc.

In Doctor Jones his Commentary on the Hebrews, page 117. this sentence is
expunged. Here we are to learn, that we are to occupy our selves in a serious
contemplation of the Sabbath day, it is as chest full of precious and
invaluable Jewels, if it were unlocked unto us; it is a recordation of things
past, namely, of the creation of the world which is never to be forgotten by
us; and our Christian Sabbath must put us in remembrance of the resurrection of
our Savior Christ, which was a re-making of the world: Again Secondly, The
Sabbath was a type and figure of things to come, of that spiritual rest that
we should have by Christ from sin, satan and the pains of hell; and likewise
of that heavenly and everlasting rest that we shall have in the Kingdom of
Heaven; all the week long we are working in those callings wherein God has set
us eating our bread, as is the Commandment, in the sweat of our brows; but on
the Sabbath day we rest from them all, do nothing but hear the Word of God,
pray, sing Psalms, receive the Sacrament: and this should put us in mind of
that perpetual Sabbath we should keep in Heaven, where we should do nothing
but praise God continually: yet for all that, this day, the day of days, the
Lords day, which the Lord has selected to himself, is too little regarded by
a great number; some men are so worldly that they will not rest, no not on this
day; they that do rest from bodily labors, will not rest on such a heavenly
manner as they ought to do, it may be they will be sleeping even at the
Church, when others be at Sermons, or they will be sitting idle at home, in the
streets, or Churchyards, but they do not make that holy and comfortable use
of the Sabbath, as they ought to do, they do not now take occasion to
meditate upon that sweet and joyful Sabbath, where we shall rest with Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob for ever; yet as the holy Ghost teaches us in this place, this
is one principal use we are to make of the Sabbath.

In the said Doctor Jones his Comentary, page 41. 103. 119. 232. 236. 253. 252.
274. 319. 320. these words, The prophonation of the Sabbath are put out, and
the very name of Sabbath obliterated.

So in Doctor Clerk's Sermons page 200. l. ult. and page 147. l. 7. the word
Sabbath is deleted.

65. Passages deleted, that the Sacraments Ex Opere Operato confer Grace; and
concerning the Sacrament of Baptism.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, written copy page 399. this clause is
purged out: Fourthly, by Baptism we gain eternal life and salvation; that is
although Baptism does not confer these ex Opere operato, yet where the
Sacrament in rightly administered, and faithfully received, and Christ within
justifying the person to be baptized, Romans 4, 11. there Baptism does seal all
these mercies, graces and benefits unto the party baptized.

Answ. 2. Baptism is not absolutely necessary unto salvation, as appears
thus; First Sacraments do not confer grace upon all, nor by a physical
power give grace unto any, but sometimes God in and by the Sacraments conveyes
grace unto his Elect children, and sometimes by the Sacraments confirms grace
which he has formerly conferred.

Ibidem on Matthew 3. ver. 11. I indeed have baptized you with water, but he
shall baptize you with the holy Ghost. this discourse is obliterated:

Quest. What is John Baptists principal scope herein?

Ans. His principal and particular scope was this, to show that his baptism
had no efficacy nor power in it from himself at all, but only from Christ:
teaching us, that the outward Sacrament may be in-effectuall (vede August.
contr. Faustum 10. 4. and 19. 12.) and that two manner of ways, viz. First,
for a time only, as those who were baptized into John's baptism received not
the graces of the spirit till afterward, Act. 9. 2. And Secondly, sometimes
finally, and for ever; and thus Simon Magus was baptized but never benefitted
at all by it, Act. 8. 13. 20. 23.

It may here be demanded, why the Sacraments are sometimes in-effectuall,
seeing they are the Sacraments of Christ, instituted by himself?

First, because they are Sacraments appointed for the confirming of grace
formerly given, not for the conferring of grace by any physical power in
themselves (Romans 4. 11.) and therefore no wonder if the Sacraments be not
effectual, when they are administered to one void of grace; for a seal set to
a blank profits nothing.

Secondly, because those things which are a means of conferring grace,
according to the Ordinance of God, are but only means, and not efficient
causes; and therefore unto the receiver is like the preaching of the Word,
altogether unprofitable when they are not mixed with faith, Heb. 4. 2.

How may we know whether we are truly baptized or not, or whether our baptism
be effectual or operative in us?

We may know thisby a serious examination of our selves by those things
whereunto Baptism is compared, viz. Water A. Spirit B. Fire C.

A. First, Baptism is compared to Water, which has these two principal
properties; First, it washes clean, and cleanses away filth and pollution
from a garment, and therefore we must examine and try, whether we be washed and
clean purged from the pollution of ^inne or not? Secondly, It moysteneth and
makes apt to fructify; and to bring forth fruit, Isa. 44. 3. and therefore we
must try whether we are barren or not? for if we increase nor in the works of
sanctification, we are not yet truly baptized unto Christ. B. Secondly,
baptism is compared unto the Spirit, or to wind or breath, who^e properties
are these two, namely; First, to cool and refresh the Lungs; and secondly, to
work insensibly, according to our Saviors speech John 3. the wind blows where
it lists, of which afterward in his proper place, viz. upon John. 2. 5. Let us
here only examine, whether lust burn and rage within us or not? for if we be
enflamed therewith, and have no spiritual breath to cool these carnal
flames, then we are not truly baptized into Christ; the pulses of the
conscience being sighs and prayers wherewith the child of God does querch the
fire of concupiscence. C. Thirdly, Baptism is compared to fite, whose
properties are these three; to wit, First, to give light, and therefore he that
is blind, is not yet by baptism made a member of Christ; for where the spirit
of Christ is there the eyes of the understanding are opened by him; and
secondly to purge away dross from mettle: and therefore we must try, whether
the corruption of our nature be more and more subdued, and whether we be more
holy, more pure and more unspotted then formerly we were? yea like gold seven
times tried in the furnace; and thirdly, it does inflame and burn; and
therefore key-cold and lukewarm Christians are not yet baptized into Christ:
wherefore we must labor that our hearts may be enflamed with a desire to
advance the glory of God; as Saint Paul, when he saw the City Athens subject to
idolatry, his spirit was stirred in him, Act. 17. 16.

66. Passages deleted, that the Eucharist and Mass are no Propitiatory
Sacrifice. (See Mass before.)
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew written copy page 324. this discourse is
deleted: Quest. Is the bread in the Lords Supper, when it is consecrated, to be
offered up as a Propitiatory sacrifice unto God?

Answ. No: our sacrifices now are Thanksgiving and Alms, Hosea 14. 3. Phil. 4.
18. Heb. 13. 15, 16.

Object. But this Sacrament is frequently by the Fathers called a sacrifice,
and therefore the Mass is no Idol; yea the Papists urge Heb. 13. 10, etc. and
from thence of set up the Bread, Christ, unto God for a propitiatory sacrifice.

Answ. First, it is not certain that the Apostle in that place speaks of the
Eucharist, yea rather contrarily, it is certain, that he speaks not of the
Eucharist, for verse 15. it is said, Per illum, by him, therefore let us offer.
etc. and therefore if we offer sacrifice unto God (per illum, ergo non illum)
by Christ, then we do not offer up Christ himself unto God.

Secondly, our sacrifices now are spiritual, viz. prayers, praises and alms;
as was showed before in the answer to the Question: And hence collections were
wont to be made in the Church, 1 Cor. 16. at the time when the Eucharist was
celebrated; and thus the Fathers do always explain themselves when they
speak of sacrifice: for there is a double sacrifice, to wit, first, one which
the Priest offers up, and this the Papists speak of, but not the Fathers;
secondly, a sacrifice which every Communicant offers, and of this the Fathers
speak; Tu sine oblatione venis, participas quod pauper offert, Chrysostom. When
thou come to the Lords Supper, thou must not come without an offering.

Ibid. page 365. The Papists object, Christ in the institution of his supper
speaking of his sacrifice, does not utter the words in the future tense: This
is my body, which trad^tur, shall hereafter be given for you; and my blood,
which effundetur, shall be shed for you: but in the present tense, pro vobis
traditur and effunditur, which is given for you, and shed for you; therefore
Christ did not only sacrifice his body and blood upon the Cross, but also in
the Lords supper.

Answ. First, if these words (this is my body which is given, and my blood
which is shed) be the substantial words of the sacrifice of the Mass, then
there is a gross and impious error in the Canon of the Mass; for in the
first part of the institution, the Canon wholly omits these word, quod pro
vobis traditur, which is given for you; and in the other part of the
institution, the Canon has not the present tense, but the future effundteur,
this is my blood which hereafter shall be shed for you; and thus the very
nerves and sinews of this argument are quite cut a sunder by the Canon of the
Mass it self.

Secondly, how can the sacrifice of the Mass be called Jucruentum, an unbloody
sacrifice, if there were in effusion of blood even at that instant when Christ
celebrated his supper? yea if the Wine be substantially changed into the blood
of Christ, and the Bread into his body, and that there be blood not only in
the Cup, but also with the flesh, as they teach, then it must needs be a bloody
sacrifice.

Thirdly, it is not unknown to the Christian Faith of Protestants, when and
where the body of Christ was given for the redemption of our souls and the
blood of Christ shed for washing away of our sins; for the Scripture in many
places declares, that this was done in the death and suffering of Christ, and
not in the celebration or institution of the Eucharist.

Fourthly, neither does the use of the present tense prove that which they
would have, for it is usual and well known, that there is an Enallage often
times in Scripture, and that not only the present tense, but also sometimes
the preter tense is put for the future for the certainty of things affirmed: as
for example; paer natus est nobis, unto us a child is given or borne; Agnus
occisus, the Lamb was slain from the beginning of the world; behold the Lamb
of God, qui tollet, which takes away the sins of the world, Ego pono, I lay
down my life for my sheep etc. Chem. Exam. part 2. fol. 166. 6.

Many Passages of this nature are expunged out of Doctor Jones his Comentary on
the Hebrews, others altered by the Licenser, which we pretermit.

67. Clauses deleted against Popish Satisfaction.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew written copy page 17. this is deleted:
Quest. Which are the parts of Repentance?

First, the Papihs answer hereunto, that the parts of repentance are three, to
wit, First contrition, or (as some of them say) Attrition: Secondly, auricular
confession; Thirdly, Satisfaction of merit.

Object. We may satisfy the wrath of God for the punishment due unto sin.

Answ. Neither will this evasion serve, that by grace our works satisfy, for
grace and works are so diverse, that they cannot herein concur together; grace
taking away works, and works grace, if they should be joined as working causes
together.

Ibidem page 383 this is purged out: I read (says Ambrose) of Peter's penitent
tears, but not of his Satisfaction; the which words of the Father, being urged
against popish Satisfaction, Peter Lombard answered, Multa facta sunt quae
scripta non sunt, many things have been done which are not written or mentioned
in the Scriptures.

Answ. This answer is a sufficient satisfaction (with the Papists) being an
essential point of penance, and pertains to doctrine, and therefore it
should have an express warrant or proof out of the Scripture; for in matters
of faith or points of doctrine, an argument may be drawn negatively from the
Scriptures (though not so in matter of fact) as for example; This doctrine is
not found in Scripture, therefore it ought not to be received, is a good
consequence; wherefore the Fathers (viz. Ambrose) argument is good, and the
Masters (viz. of the sentences) solution loses not the knot.

And fol. 207. written copy: Thy sins be forgiven thee.

We see Christ here neither requires confession, nor demands or reserves
Satisfaction of this sick man, but wholly takes away his sins, to teach us
that Christ pardons our sins truly, Heb. 8. 12. Ior. 31. 21. etc. Isa. 43.
25. Heb. 10. 17.

68. Scripture Texts themselves and their very words alone deleted.
NOt to trouble you with any already mentioned in the Premises take these
ensuing instances instead of many more that might be added. In Master Ward's
Comentary on Matthew. p. 201. Christ indeed is never absent from his children;
for, he loves them unto the end, Ioh. 13. 1. yea, promises to be with them
unto the end, Mat. 28. 20. yea, he dwells with them by his spirit, 1 Cor. 3.
16. 2 Cor. 6. 16. But yet he seems sometimes absent. Ibid. p. 202. There is a
fear of God, which is a godly fear; wherein two things are observable. viz.
First, that he is to be feared, Ps. 2. 11. Pro. 1. 7. Eccle. 12. 11. And
secondly, that he is not to be feared doubtingly, but believed confidently,
Ioh. 4. 18. and Romans 8. 38. Ibid. p. 84. All Christians are called light: Thus
Saint Paul taxed the Jews, Thou art confident that thou thy self art a guide
of the blind, a light to them that sit in darkness, Romans 2. 19. whence he
intimates that every Christian is or ought to be a light. Ibid. p. 194. Quest.
Why does the Lord principally respect our Faith? Answ. First, because Faith
only saves us, Romans 3. 12. 27. etc. and 4. 5. Acts 13. 48. Ioh. 8. 24. Ephesians. 2.
8. Secondly, because works serve only to prove our Faith, Gal. 5. 8. Iam. 2.
18. Ibid. p. 207. Thy sins be forgiven thee. We see Christ here, neither
requires Confession, nor demands or reserves Satisfaction of this sick man, but
wholly takes away his sins: to teach us, That Christ pardons our sins
truly, Heb. 8. 12. Ier. 31, 32. etc. Isay 43. 25. Heb. 10. 17. Ibid. p. 403.
Secondly, it appears the Holy Ghost is God, because he begat Christ the Son
of God, Luke 1. 35. where he is called, The power of the most High; and
therefore he is God. Ibid. p. 187. the Lord is immutable and immovable in his
Law and Decrees of mercy, John 13. 1. Romans 11. 29. Ibid. page 221. All power
comes from God; we neither have power to eschew evil, nor to do good, Romans 7.
15. 19. 23. Were not these Licensers as bad or worse then Papists, thus to
obliterate these very Texts of sacred Scriptures as heterodox, and unfit to
pass the Press? No doubt they would have rased them out of the Bible it self
in time, as well as out of this Authors writings, who did but barely cite them
in their genuine sense, against Popish and Arminian errors.

69. Passages expunged, that the Scriptures are light, not hard to be
understood, and to be read by the common people.
IN Master Ward upon Matthew 14. 15. page 27. 90. these clauses are deleted. Ye
are the light of the World.

The Papists affirm, the Scriptures to be hard, and difficult and obscure,
that the common people or Laity cannot understand them, and therefore it is to
no purpose for them to read them. Now against this we produce this place,
arguing briefly thus; the Apostles are the light of the world, therefore their
doctrine (i. e. the Scripture) is perspicuous, and facile, and may be
understood by a diligent and observant Reader etc.

To this of Bellarmine we answer, first, the Major proposition is false, that
every light is always visible, for these two causes, viz. First, because the
Sun and Moon were ordered to be great lights (Genesis 1. 16. and Psalm. 136. 8.)
for the governing of day and night, and yet we see them often darkened, and
suffer strange eclipses: so the Church, though it be ordained to enlighten the
world by ministering the doctrine of the Scriptures, yet sometimes it may fail
out of men's sight, as has been showed elsewhere, viz. upon Matthew. 5. 14.
Secondly, though the Church be a light, yet such as walk in darkness, loving
that better then the light, do not always see it, but want either will or
eyes thereto: Thus the King of Arams Soldiers neither saw the horses and
Chariots of fire that were round about Elisha, nor knew that they were in the
midst of Samaria, until their eyes were opened.

Neither do men light a candle and put it under a Bushel.

The Papists say, that the Scriptures are so hard and obscure, that although
people were permitted to read them in their mother tongue, yet they could not
possibly understand them, and therefore it boots not at all to do so: Now
against this Tenet of theirs we enforce this place, arguing thus; Christ in the
former verses affirmed his Apostles to be, not only the sale of the earth, but
also the light of the world; and in this verse shows how absurd a thing it is
to light a candle, and then to put it under a Bushel, and how useful it is to
put it into a candlestick, because so it gives light to all that are in the
house. But if the writings of the Apostles be obscure, then we must of
necessity confess, that the light is hid under a bushel, and is not seen by
those in the room: Now if this be absurd, then let the Pastists acknowledge it
an absurd opinion to think the Scriptures obscure, and rather affirm them to
be perspicuous and plain; yea, not only perspicuous and clear to the
understanding of some, but to all who are in the house, that is, to all the
faithful: Briefly, if the Gospel be like a lighted candle which is put into a
candlestick, and gives light to all who are in the house, then it is
perspicuous and clear to the whole household; but the former is true from this
verse; therefore also the latter, etc.

Were not our Prelates wholly Popish, and Romes sworn Vassals, who could not
endure to have such passages as these pass freely through our Presses without
a Romish purgation? and do not these bad fruits discover how rotten their
hearts, how corrupt their judgments were?

70. Passages blotted out against Transubstantiation; and Christ's Corporal
presence in the Eucharist.
IN Dr. Clerk's Sermons page 229. l. 21. after these words, not dye at all,
should follow this deleted cause; God is the creator; it is he (John says)
made all things; the Popish Priest says, he can, by certain words said in
the Sacrament, make his maker, create Christ, incarnate him again, turn bread
into Christ's body.

And in Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, p. 380. Wine and bread cannot be
both in the Sacrament corporally and substantially, as the Papists teach; But
of this subject you have heard much before; we shall not therefore here enlarge
our selves any further.

71. A notable clause deleted concerning the Toleration of Popish Priests, and
Divines preaching against it.
IN D. Featlie's Clavis Mystica, p. 175. this notable passage is purged out by
the Archbishops Chaplain: Now though toleration of different Religions falls
in some respects, within the compass of the mysteries of state, which cannot
be determined in the Schools but are fittest to be debated at the Council
Table; yet considering the pre-eminence the Law of God has above the law of
men, and the dangerous consequence of an ill resolution of the state in this
point, which may tend to the ruin of many thousand souls; certainly the
Statesman is not to begin but where the Divine ends in a deliberation of this
nature; For first, it is to be enquired, Whether bearing with a false Religion,
be a thing justifiable by the rules of true Religion? whether the God of Heaven
permit any permission of blasphemy against himself, or heresy against his
true worship? And in case that God dispense with some kind of toleration of
errors and abuses for some time, to prevent a greater mischief, the Council
of state is to enquire, whether the condition of the present state be such,
that the only means to suppress heresy, is for a while to let it grow? as
also, whether the cockle can be clean weeded out without the spoil of much
good corn? If the Grecians never undertook any matter of great consequence,
before they received answers from their Oracles; neither the Jews before they
consulted with God by the Ephod; nor the Romans, priusquam de coelo servatum
esset, before they had the approbation of their south-sayers; doubtless all
Christian estates are to expect either a command, or at least a warrant from
Scripture, before they proceed in matters so nearly concerning God and his
service; otherwise, they go about to set the sun by the dyall, not the dyall
by the sun; alter the house to the hangings; whereas all good Governors
should be like good Pylots, qui manum ad clavum, oculos habent ad astra, who
have their eye upon the stars or C^rd and hand upon their helm; that is,
they ought according to the direction from heaven to steer their course.

72. Passages expunged against Venial sins.
IN Doctor Clerk's Sermons page 295. l. 16. after Lotteries, the Licenser has
deleated these words; All sins ventall; ventall (I would say) there; yea (as
a Romish Riball shamed not once to say) though a man had layen with our Lady.

And page 333. l. 22. after these words. A petty sun, should follow; nor ever
heard I of vice in a Diminutine, but only in a Papist; Lindan has Levicula
vitiola, substantive and adjective abated both,

In Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew. 5. ver. 19. page 105. One of the least
Commandments, this discourse is rased out.

Are all sins mortal, are not some Venial?

First, some sins are called venial, possibilitate, because there is a
possibility that they may be pardoned; and they are thus called, in opposition
to those mortal sins which cannot possibly be forgiven, as final
impenitency, total apostasy, and the sin against the Holy ghost, Heb. 64.
and 10. 26.

Secondly, some sins are called venial, facilitate, because they are more
easily and usually forgiven; and they are thus called, in opposition to those
sins which are scarcely or seldom pardoned; as swearing, and the idolatry of
covetous men, which are seldom truly repented of.

Thirdly, some sins are called venial, promissione, because they have a
promise of pardon; and thus all the sins of the righteous children of God are
called venial.

Fourthly, some sins are called venial, vera estimatione, because they
deserve not death nor condemnation: And in this sense we deny any sins to be
venial, because every transgression of the Law is mortal; yea, hence
Bellarmine confesses, that they are not properly sins, because they are
preter legem non contra, besides the Law, not contrary to the Law; and
therefore we should not presume because our sins are small, but fear because
they are many; the smalnesse of them having been a means to hinder us from
turning from them, or repentig of them, and also to multiply and increase the
number of them.

Ibidem written copy page 334. Object. Therefore some sins are venial, some
mortal.

Answ. First, neither an Eagle nor an Elephant will catch at flies, and
therefore it becomes not so great and learned a Scholar as Bellarmine is to
catch and snatch at these flies and moats.

73. Passages rased out concerning our effectual Vocation.
THis whole discourse is obliterated in Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew 22.
ver. 14. Many are called but few elected:

Quest. How many sorts of callings or calls are there?

Answ. There is a double call, viz. particular and general: First, there is a
particular calling or function, ^^ to the ministry, and the like, John 6. 12.
Matthew. 7. 22. now this call belongs not unto salvation, and therefore I omit
it: Secondly, there is a general call unto salvation, which is two fold, to
wit, ineffectuall and effectual: First, there is an effectual calling, which
is twofold. to wit, a calling whereby God calls all men, and a call whereby he
calls the outward Church: First, there is an effectual call whereby God calls
all men, and this is twofold, to wit; First, the Word of God, which is said to
call all, and that both because it speaks unto all without difference; Come
all, etc. Mark 11. 24. and Acts 17. 30. and 10. 35. and also because the sound
thereof goes into all the world, or unto the atmost parts of the world. Romans
10. 17. Psalm. 19. 4: The book of the creatures for the invisible things of God
are seen in the creation, Romans 1. 20. and there are some marks and impressions
or prints of God in every creature: Secondly, there is an effectual call,
whereby God calls the eternal Church, to wit, the whole Church professing the
Gospel outwardly, whether they be Papists, Arrians, Heretics, Ana baptists or
Protestants: Whence we may learn, That all in the outward Church are called,
and therefore many are called; this is clear from this verse: and chap. 20.
16. Luke 14. 16.

Quest. 2. How are all in the outward Church called?

Answ. Two manner of ways, by the Word and Spirit; First, all under the
Gospel are called by the Word preached, Matthew. 23. 37. and hence the Gospel
is called Lucifer, the day star, 2 Pet. 1. 19. and the Word of life, John 6.
68. and the salvation of God, Act, 28. 28. and the word of reconciliation, 2
Cor. 5. 19. and therefore what will become of those who despise the Gospel;
that is, both first, the Papists, who because they hate us, therefore they
contamne the Gospel which we profess, although it be the word of life, and
the means of their calling: Oh woe be unto those who contemn the words of
Christ; and also secondly, they who think preaching a fine thing, but not
necessary; such are they who can be content with a dumb Minister, or who, like
the Gergesens, prefer their gain before Gospel; Oh! it is a grievous thing
for Christ to call, and we to refuse his gracious calling: and also thirdly,
they who enjoy the preaching of the gospel, and may be made partakers thereof,
has forenoone and afternoon on the Lords day, and yet neglect it, and for
every trifle, and upon every trivial occasion, will absent himself, Prove. 1.
24. Oh it is a fearful thing for a man to loath this lovely manna; and
likewise fourthly, they who do not make a right use of that which they hear,
and this is the most usual, and the most hurtful of all, Amos 8. 11. And thus
we see how all under the gospel are called by the Word: Secondly, all under
the gospel are called by the Spirit, working within, as well as by the Word
preached without: Now because we make this a member of the general
ineffectuall call: it may be demanded.

Quest. 3. Whether the call of the Spirit be ineffectuall or not? for it is
said, that those who are led by the Spirit are the sons of God, Romans 8. 14.
and that there is no condemnation to the spiritual man, Romans 8. 1. because the
gifts of God are (...), without repentance, Romans 11. 29.

Answ. All this is true of the effectual operation of the holy spirit, because
that is certain and eternal; but there is a general work of the spirit,
which ends in perdition; that is, many may and do fall finally and totally
into sin, and consequently into eternal destruction, in whom sometimes there
has been some good motions, and general operations of the blessed spirit;
this is clear from these places, to wit, Mat. 7. 22. and 13. 20. Heb. 6. 4. and
10. 26. and 2 Pet. 2. 20. Now this general call and operation of the holy
Spirit has these degrees following. viz. First, an understanding of the word,
for the mere natural man cannot understand it, Mat. 16. 23. and 1 Cor. 2. 14.
Here observe two things, to wit, First, there are many in the places of the
Gospel who hear the Word preached all the days of their lives, and yet
understand nothing, but remain children in understanding; now these never were
made partakers so much as of common or general grace: Secondly, there are some
who live under the Word, and do dogmatically understand the Word; now these
must remember that knowledge is not enough, God having given them knowledge for
practice sake, yea to know and not to obey will aggravate their panishment.
Secondly, a taste of spiritual things and the heavenly gift, Heb. 6. 4. this
is to receive the Word with joy. Matthew. 13. 20. and there are few ordinary
hearers, but at some time or other have these affecting motions, although for
the most part the reprobate rather rejoices in the newness then in the
trunesse of that which he hears. Thirdly, obedience in part for saking some
sins and doing God some service, Mark 6. 20. And thus much for the first
general call unto salvation, to wit, the ineffectuall call. Now

Secondly, there is an effectual calling, and thus only the sheep of Christ
are called, John 10. 27. and 6. 44. and 2 Timothy 1. 9. and 1 Cor. 1. 26.

Quest. 4. How many things are observable in this effectual vocation or
calling?

Answ. These five which follow; namely; First, it is of and from God, that is,
those who are effectually called are called by God. John 8. 44. Act. 13. 48.
Secondly, it is wrought by the Spirit, Mat. 12. 18. Isae. 42. 1. 1 Cor. 5. 14.
Gal. 3. 26.

Object. 1. Thirdly, it is free: Now against th^s it may be objected, election
is free but not vocation, because our works go before effectual vocation, as
appears by the Prodigal, and Eunuch, and Cornelius.

Answ. There are two parts of our effectual vocation, whereof the first is hid
and secret, and internal. and is spiritually wrought by the holy spirit; and
the second part is manifest, and that is, the perfection of sanctification,
when it is outwardly perfected: Now both these proceed from the free love of
God, who works in us both the will and the dead, both good habits and good
acts; read Phil. 2. 13. 2 Timothy 1. 9. Jam. 1. 18. Fourthly, it is firm and
certain, Romans 8. 30. 1 These. 2. 24. Fifthly, it is not appertaining unto all,
but only those who are elected, are effectually called, etc.

74. Clauses obliterated against Will Worship.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, written copy page 361. this is
expunged: Quest. Because this woman without any particular command from God,
did by this her fact perform a good work, and an acceptable service unto
Christ, it may therefore be demanded. Whether those works which are undertaken
out of a good intention, though without a command, be acceptable services or
parts of Gods worship?

Answ. No; for the Word says, that he is worshipped in vain by the Doctrine
of men, Isa. 15. 9. and Col. 220. will worship is condemned, yea this last was
singular, not exemplary; for Mary anointed Christ without any special command
from God, but not without a singular instinct of the spirit, and Christ
defends the fact, not at simply good or worthy to be imitated, nor because he
did approve of will worship, but because it was grateful unto him for another
use, which he knew, but she knew no, namely his burial, which was shortly to
be, Bareus s. fol 853. b.

Ibidem page 57. in the written copy: Here indeed is a pride in Religion, when
God must be content either to accept of will worship, or a freewill-offering, or
else he shall have nothing.

75. Passageo deleted concerning the loving, prizing and hearing of Gods Word.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, page 110. in the written copy, this
clause is rased out.

Answ. 3. Except their righteousnese exceed that of the Scribes, they cannot be
saved (because civil honesty without Religious zeal is but like a menstrens
cloth, Isa. 64.) And afterward the last line but four, First, delight in the
hearing of the Word, and call it not a weariness or hard saying; we see in
hunting that both the horse and the dog run after the Hare, but after a
diverse manner; for the horse has no delight in that sport, and therefore if
he were whipped and spurred, he would not ride after it, but the dog delights in
the pastime, and therefore runs swiftly of himself without any beating: Thus it
is not enough to come to the house of God upon Gods day to hear his Word, but
we must do it with delight and desire, if we would have the Lord to approve of
our hearing.

Ibid. page 332. there is this further deletion: First, how do we love the
Word? whether do we prepone or postpone other things before it? we should
enquire with our selves, whether we so love the Word, that we had rather want
our meat, drink, and raiment, and recreations, and riches, and all, rather then
the preaching of the Word of God, etc.

Fourthly, unto an example of piety and purity, Phil. 2. 15. (we say and see
that those who are in place among the Papists, are bold and courageous in the
defense of their Religions, and therefore it is a shame if any Protestants, who
are preferred either to Ecclesiastical or civil dignities, should stand as
Newters betwixt two.)

And a little after: Thirdly, whether the back and belly of the poor bless
us, etc. Fourthly, whether we use our riches for the buying and procuring the
preaching of the Word or not, when we want it? For our Lord will take an
account of the spending and disposing of our riches.

76. Passages deleted concerning good works, their end; and against the Merit
of Works, and Works of Supererogation.
IN Master Ward's Comentary on Matthew, p. 200. this is purged out: Quest.
How many ends are there in the performance of good works?

Answ. Four; namely, first, to please God; secondly, to glorify God; and
thirdly to make our own calling and election sure; and fourthly, to confirm,
strengthen and build up others: Now the moral works of the natural man fall
short in all these but only the last, for sometimes his Neighbor reaps
benefit thereby.

Ibidem printed book, fol. 156. written copy fol. 68. 69. Why may we not
ascribe some Merit unto our works?

Answ. Because that were to derogate from God and his good will, who so
graciously invites us to come and buy grace of him without money ormony-worth,
Isa. 55. 1. and therefore we must not expect not exact the reward of glory, as
a due debt unto NOTE.
us from God for our works, as Saint Elzearous did, etc. Will not this hinder
and discourage men from working, to remember that all their works merit nothing
at Gods hand at all? Ans. It is so far from hindering, that it furthers; so
far from discouraging, that it encourages; so far from lessening, that it
increases; and so far from extinguishing that it enflames our desires and
endeavors to be rich in good works.

Ibidem written copy fol. 105. We deserve nothing at the hands of God but only
by the obedience of the Commandments, i. e. if there be any merit, it is in
the obedience of the Law: if Adam had merited, it had been by obeying that
which was commanded, not that which was required; for when by such things we
desire to please God, he will say, who has required these things at your
hands, Isa. 1. 12. and therefore little hope can the Papists have to merit
Heaven by their monastical Vows, whether general or particular.

Ibidem written copy fol. 108. It is injurious unto Christ, to desire God to
accept of NOTE.
the overplus of our brothers merits for us: Here we may observe the true
Mystery of Iniquity, and the impious impudency of the Popish Writers, and all
who herein subscribe unto them; who, first, hold that the merit of Christ is
not sufficient to save us, because it is not ours, and we ought to have an
inherent righteousness of our own besides that imputative righteousness of
his, or otherwise we can never be saved: And secondly, that the merits of a
mere man can save us although we be wicked, and have no ioherent
righteousness in us at all; thus blasphemously arrogating more to the false
and feigned overplus of sinful men, then to the whole sufferings and perfect
merits of that Lamb without spot.

Ibidem written copy fol. 300. Object. For the merit of works: Answ. First, the
Question between us and the Papists is, demeritis secundum esse, but this
conclusion is inferred de Meritis secundum dici, and therefore proves nothing
against us: Answ. 2. Secondly, he who can perfectly fulfill whatsoever is
commanded in the Law, may be said to merit the reward promised: but this none
are able to do, as has been formerly in diverse places proved: Answ. 3.
Thirdly, the promise of the Gospel is not, do this and live; but believe and
thou shall be saved: and therefore the reward is not merited by works, but
given of grace and mercy? Answ. 4. Fourthly, these accidental promises,
wherein life is promised to works, do not give a tight unto the Kingdom of
Heaven for the merit of works, but the profession of life everlasting through
grace in Christ: And therefore works are not antecedent, causall and
meritorious causes of this life, but in respect of our right thereunto, they
are frequent conditions, and in regard of our possession thereof, they are
preparations thereunto.

Passages expunged against Profaneness, Libertinisme, and living, ending in
sin.
TO close up these purgations we informed you in the first Section of them, p.
259. that the Licenser changed this passage in Doctor Jones his Comentary on
the Hebrews, page 106. We have begun in pure and sound Religion, let us not
END in Popery; into, let us not end in profaneness; yet behold these purgers
ending not only in Popery, but Libertinisme and prophanensse too, in the
highest degree, as their expunging these clauses (to omit hundreds of like
nature) evidence.

In Mr. Ward's Comentary on Matthew, p. 161. they deleted this period Thirdly
they (Professors) must be careful to stop the mouths of moral, civil,
honest men, who usually object, that they are not so proud, covetous, idle,
revengefull, angry, and selfe-conceited as Professors are; for they are
Pharisees toward others, and little better then Publicans in themselves; Let
those therefore who call upon the Name of the Lord, depart from all iniquity,
and let them labor to abound in all virtues, both moral and Theological,
that so our profession may be praised both of profane and civil men.

Page 147. in the same Author: Thirdly, another reason; why we must never sin
at all, is, because sin is like Penalopes Web, and therefore to admit of
one were to cast our selves as far back as ever we were; wherefore we must so
run, that we may attain, and so follow Gods Plough, that we look not back:
the sow who after her washing turns her self to her former wallowing, becomes
as filthy as ever; and man by a willing running or falling into sin, becomes
as far off from God, and odious unto him as ever; and therefore we must take no
liberty unto sin at all.

And page 217. Secondly, those are here blameworthy, who after a general call
to the profession of the gospel, live wickedly, turning the grace of God into
wantonness, Jude 4. and ending in the flesh though they began in the Spirit,
Gal. 5. 19: certainly these are the worst of all in the Lords esteem, this not
being the persuasion of him who called them.

TO these purgations, infinite others might be accumulated, enough to make many
whole Folio Volumes, but for brevitie sake we shall pretermit them; all these
here mentioned (for the Readers fuller satisfaction, and clearer discovery of
this prelates popish intentions) not being read at large, at the Lords Bar, but
only the principal of them, the rest but pointed at (though all there
actually produced in general collections of them) to husband time, and avoid
tediousness in this kind of evidence.

Now we appeal to all the world and every man's conscience who shall impartially
peruse these several orthodox passages expunged out of new licensed books, by
the Archb. and his Agents, before they could pass the Press (the like whereof
was never heard of in any Protestant Church, but only in Romish Babel) and
compare them with the several forementioned Popish Doctrines, Superstitions,
Errors, Clauses authorized by them in other late printed Pamphlets, to corrupt
the People: whether they be not a most full, satisfactory, experimental,
irrefragable Evidence to convince your Lordships and all gainesayers, of the
Archbishops real Endeavors, utterly to subvert the Protestant Religion, and
introduce the whole body of popery (with arbitrary power and tyranny) among us
without any public opposition, notwithstanding all his mere verbal
protestations to the contrary, most apparently contradicted, refuted, by these
his popish purgations incapable of any justification or excuse, unparalleld by
any Protestant Prelates unheard of in any Protestant Church, or in our own,
before his comin^ering in it, unpractised by any, but only popish Inquisitors,
in their Indices Expurgator^y; wherein we find the very selfsame passages in
substance, yea and some of them in terminis deleted out of Classical Authors,
which this Archbishop and his Chaplains have obliterated out of our
Protestant Writers, as you may evidently discern by these few particular
instances in the Index Librorum expurgatorum, by Gasper Quiroga, Cardinal and
Archbishop of Toledo, and general Inquisitor for Spain, Salmuri; 1601.
wherein I find these with sundry other like clauses expunged out of the Index
to Saint Augustine's Works, set out by Froben: The Annotations to the Bible of
Robert Stephanus Erasmus. and others. Eucharistiam non esse sacrificium, sed
sacrificij memoriam: Fides sola justificat: Justi summus sola fide; Justos ab
injustis fides discernit, non opera. Imaginum usus prohibitus. Matrimonium

What affinity there is between these purgations of this popish Spanish
Inquisitor, and those of this English Archprelate and his Agents, you may
easily discern by comparing both together; and thereupon necessarily conclude,
that their intentions were alike popish, because their Practices, Purgations
are so parallel. Only there are these remarkable differences between them:
First, that these purgations made by him and his Agents are far more gross in
sundry particulars then any we find in this, or any other Romish Inquisitors
Index Expurgatorem: Secondly, that they were made by this Arch-prelat and his
Chaplains, who professed himself a zealous Protestant, and who in respect of
his very calling, supreme authority in our Church, and the great trust reposed
in him, ought rather to have authorized then purged out these passages,
especially in such times when we were all generally running headlong unto
popery, and apostatizing unto Rome; when as all these other deleatures were
made by professed papists only in popish Kingdoms, Churches, when they were
falling off to the protestant Religion, which they endeavovred to prevent.

By this Card you may see and suppress what compass this Arch-director and
Corrector of our Church did sail by, and what foreign port he was making to.

The precedent branch of the Evidence against the Archbishop, has given most
ample proof of the seventh and ninth Original Articles, to which we shall
only add; That, the Archbishop having stopped the English Presses to all
Orthodox Books against his Popish Innovations at home, endeavored to hinder
the Printing of them abroad in Foreign parts; to which end by Sir William
Boswels means, (then Leager Ambassador at the Hague) and the assistance of one
John le Maire, preacher in Amsterdam (his constant Spy and Intelligencer, to
give notice of all English and Scottish Books there printing, as appears by
sundry Original Letters under his hand and seal, found in the Archbishops
studdy) he procured the States of the United Provinces in the Low Countries, to
make a general Proclamation in April 1639. against the Printers and spreaders
of Libellous and Seditious Books against the Church and Prelates of England,
and obtained a Proclamation or Order from the Towns of Amsterdam and Roterdam,
for the apprehending and punishing of Master Can and other English men, who
Printed such English and Scottish Books; which is evident by diverse coppies
thereof, and Letters from Sir William Boswell and others, to the Archbishop.
By means whereof the Presses both in England and the Netherlands were all
closed up against Orthodox English Books, under the notion of Libellous and
Seditious Pamphlets, and could neither be Printed nor imported without great
danger and censure.

On the contrary, diverse Popish books of all sorts, as well in English as
Latin, French and other Languages, were Printed and dispersed in London by
Priests, Jesuits, Papists and their Agents, without any restaint or search made
after them, or punishment inflicted on the Printers or dispersers of them: yea,
many thousands of them were daily imported by help of the Queens Priests and
Capucins, who dispersed them; and if the searchers or others seized them at the
Custom house, according to the Statute of 3. Iacobi. c. 5. which Enacts; That
no person or persons shall bring from beyond the seas, nor shall print, buy, or
sell, any Popish Primers, Ladies Psalters, Manuels, Rosaries, Popish
Catechismes, Missals, Breviaries, Portals, Legends and Lives of Saints,
containing any superstitious matter, Printed or Written in any Language
whatsoever, nor any other superstitious Books, Printed or Written in the
English tongue; upon pain of forfiture of 40. s. for every such Book; etc. The
Archbishop or his Chaplains would presently send to the Searchers, and enjoin
them to restore these Books to the owners that claimed them; or else command
them to bring them in to the High Commission Office, upon pretense to proceed
against the Importers, and to have the Books themselves publicly adjudged to
be burnt; where, after a little space, they were delivered out from thence to
the Importers, without any penalty or confiscation, and then freely dispersed
among the Roman Priests and English Catholics, to foment them in their
Idolatry, Superstition, and seduce others unto Popery: as one John Egerton a
searcher deposed, and others attested; of which more hereafter. Which compared
with the premised Licensing of Popish, and purging Orthodox Books against
Popery; will most perspicuously discover his impious designs to advance and
set up Popery among us by degrees.

The fifth particular branch of the Evidence to prove the first General Charge
against the Archbishop of Canterbury.
WE shall in the next place proceed to the eighth and ninth Original Article,
which we shall address our selves to prove, and make a fifth General Proof of
his Traiterous Endeavors to subvert Gods true Religion by Law established in
our Church, and to set up Popish superstition and Idolatry in its steed: and
that is, His countenancing, commending, fomenting, and preferring of diverse
Clergymen, who were most addicted to, and greatest Writers, sticklers for
Arminian Errors and Superstious Popish Doctrines, Ceremonies, Innovations, to
the best Ecclesiastical Dignities, Promotions, Benefices, and making some of
them Chaplains to his Majesty, to the Princes Highness; and Heads of
Colleges in our Universities, to poison those Fountains of Religion: Seconded
with his contrary discountenancing, suppressing, suspending, censuring,
imprisoning, persecuting, and driving forth of this Kingdom such zealous,
Orthodox Preaching Ministers who were most bold and resolute to oppose them.

For pregnant proof of the former Branch of this particular.

First, it is clear and undeniable not only by known experience and diverse
Letters found in his study, but by the Docquet Books and privy Signets on
record, that this Archbishop (contrary to the use of his Predecestors)
incroached, usurped to himself from the year of our Lord 1627. when he first
grew potent at Court and became Bishop of Bath and Wells, afterward of London,
before he was Archbishop, and ever since he mounted to the Sea of Canterbury,
the disposition and donation of all or most Bishoprics, Deaneries,
Prebendaries and Benefices of note in his Majesty's gift, or in the gift of the
Lord Keeper and Master of the Court of Wards, not only within the Kingdoms of
England, but of Scotland and Ireland too; and that he usurped the power of
nominating Chaplains in ordinary to his Majesty's and the Princes Highness
(contrary to all former Presidents) belonging time out of mind to the Lord High
Chamberlaines Office, who had the nomination of these Chaplains and swore and
invested them in their office, as Master Oldesworth (a Member of the House of
Commons) Secretary to the late High Chamberlain the Honorable Earl of
Pembrooke attested upon Oath, and the Noble Earl himself averred upon his
Honor; a thing so notorious to all old Courtiers, and Chaplains in ordinary
to the King, as to doubt of it were a Solecisme.

To make this apparent by punctual proofs, we shall instance in such
particular persons which were advanced by him to Bishoprics even for their
erroneous Arminian opinions, or dangerous Popish Tenets and Practices. We have
See p. 157. to 164.
formerly proved, that Richard Mountague was questioned and voted against in
the Commons House in Parliament April 13. 1626. for his Arminian and Popish
Tenets, published in his Gagge and Appeal, and, endeavoring, as much as in
him lay to reconcile us to Popery: which complaint was revived against him in
the ensuing Parliament, An. 1627. No sooner was that Parliament dissolved; but
this Prelate, then Bishop of London, who fomented, protected him against the
Parliament all he could, in stead of discountenancing, punishing, advanced him
to the Bishopric of Chichester in the place of Bishop Carlton who writ against
him. This was evidenced by the Docquet Book it self, wherein this entry of the
Privy Signet and Election is recorded, July 18. 1628. His Majesty's Royal
assent for Richard Mountague, Batchelour in Divinity, to be Bishop of
Chichester, signified, By order of the LORD BISHOP OF LONDON (Laud) And by the
Record it self of the Kings Royal Assent, produced at the Bat by Master
Prynne, and there Read in these Words.

This contains your Majesty's Royal Assent for Richard Mountague Batchelar
in Divinity to be Bishop of Chichester, void by the death of the last
Incumbent. By order of the Lord Bishop of London. After this he so far honored
him, as to be present at his consecration; Witness this passage in his Diary,
penned with his own-hand. August 23. 24. 1628. Saturday Saint Bartholmeus Eve,
the Duke of Buckingham slain at Portsmouth by one Lieutenant Felton about 9. in
the morning; the News of his death came to Croydon where it found my self,
and the Bishops of Winchester, Ely and Carlisle at the consecration of Bishop
Mountague for Chichester, with my Lords Grace. In the year 1638. upon the
Translation of Bishop Wren to Ely; this Archbishop preferred him to the Sea of
Norwich; witness Bishop Mountagues Letter to the Archbishop thus endorsed with
his own hand. Rec. Martii 29. 1638. Bishop of Ghichesters submission of his
Books to me, etc. Found in his Study at Lambeth and attested by Master Prynne.

May it please your Grace,
By Mr Bray I sent your Grace another part of my Altar Relations, as my
between-times of sickness would give me leave to transcribe; the rest as I can
dispatch it, I will send after with Gods help: In the last, there is much of
the Churches sacrifice, faithfully related out of Antiquity not positively by
me asserted. I am but a Narrator, and so the less offensive. Howsoever I give
your Grace Power to dispose Note.
of what I write, as will fit the Church and State. For we are, I know, of the
same Religion, drive to the same end, though not the same way. So much I
related to Master Bray, and Mr Deane of Christ-Church. The remaynes of my Ague
are worse then the Ague it self, so that I cannot wait upon your Grace as I
would. Yesterday I took a Purgation, which I hope will do me good, but has
much weakened me, and Physicians in expelling the remaynes and restoring
health unto the castle of strength, say they must tuto pede movere. I cannot
learn that my Lord of Norwich is yet fully translated, till when I suppose
there is no issuing of my Conge D'esleer: I must humbly entreat your Grace that
you would be pleased to inform me, when and what I should do, in both which I
am so ignorant: God make me profitable to his Church, to which I can bring
nothing but honesty and Industry, which I will promise; and to your Grace
thankefullnesse for your long-continued extraordinary Favors; in which vote I
rest. Note


Your Graces poor Servant and Brother, Rich. Cicist.
For the most Reverend my Lord of Canterbury his Grace, this.

By this Letter it is most apparent: First, that Bishop Mountague made the
Archbishop acquainted with his Books before he printed them, and submitted
them to his censure: and how full of Popery they are, you have already heard:
Yea after they were printed he presented him with printed Coppies of them
curiously bound up and gilded, produced and read formerly at the Lords Bar:
Secondly, That Canterbury and he were of the same religion, and did drive at
the same end; and what was that but the erecting of Altars, the introducing of
Popery, and reconciling us to Rome, as this Letter and the foregoing evidence
manifest. Thirdly, That his promotions were by the Archbishops long-continued
extraordinary favors, for which he returns him thanks in this Letter. And no
wonder was it, that Bishop Mountague was his special Favorite; for if we
believe the Pamphlet entitled; The Popes Nuncio, p. 11. 14. 16. (first
published in Italian by the Venetian Ambassador) this great confident of the
Archbishop was very intimate with Panzain the Popes first Legate, frequently
visited him, and very passionately desired a Reconciliation of us and the
Church of Rome: Yea, Godfrey Goodman Bishop of Gloucester, in his Letter to the
Archbishop whiles they were both prisoners in the Tower, dated August 30. 1642.
(the original whereof was seized on by M. Prynne) writes: That at that instant
when he dissented from the New Canons (by Bishop Mountagues encouragement) An.
1640. he could have proved, how that in his person he did visit and held
correspondency with the Popes Agent and received his Letters in behalf of his
Son who was Note.
then traveling to Rome, who by his Letters he had extraordinary entertainment
there. This Bishop Mountague would ascribe to the favor and credit which he
had gotten by his writings. If so, it seems they were very well approved of at
Rome; And this is not only probable but real, as appears by an original See
a necessary Introduction to the Archbishop of Canterbury his Trial. p. 146.
147.
Letter under Bishop Mountagues own hand to Secretary Windebanke, dated from
Aldingburne Jan. 26. wherein he desires this Popish Secretary to give his son
leave to go to Rome in his travel, which he is desireous to do, and I (writes
he) AM DESIROVS HE SHOULD; desiring him to acquaint his GRACE therewith, and
remember his duty to him: His Graces advancement then of such an Arminian and
Romish Prelate, so intimate with the Popes Legate and much favored at Rome,
must certainly favor of a Romish design to corrupt our Church, subvert our
Religion, set up Popery and reduce us back to Rome.

Doctor Roger Manwaring Vicar of Saint Giles in the fields, a man very Popishly
affected, and intimate with Papists, who abounded in his Parish; upon a
complaint and Impeachment of the Commons in Parliament for two Sermons preached
before his Majesty the third year of his reign, in Justification of the
Lawfulness of the Kings imposing Loves and Taxes on his People without consent
in Parliament, to the subversion of the Property and Liberty of the Subjects
(which Sermons were preached and printed by this Archbishops special
solicitation) was on the 14. of June 1628. censured by the Lords in Parliament;
and thereby perpetually disabled from all future Ecclesiastical preferments in
our Church: Of this censure the Archbishop took special Notice inserting it
into his Diary: adding, that himself was complained of by the house of Commons
June 12. for warranting Doctor Manwarings Sermons to the Press. Yet no sooner
was this Parliament ended, but in high affront of their public censure, in
July following, by this Prelates assistance, Doctor Manwaring (as was proved by
the Docquet Book) was presented unto the Rectory of Stamford Rivers in the
County of Essex, void by the promotion of Richard Mountague to the Bishopric
of Chichester; he who had right thereto was put by; and a dispensation granted
to Doctor Manwaring to hold it with the Rectory of St. Giles which made this
Doctor in the superscription of a Letter of his to this Archbishop, when
London, about the Commission of Fees in London Churches Jan. 28. 1631 (indorsed
with the Bishops own hand and found in his study) to style him, My singular
good Lord: And so he proved; for soon after, as was proved by the Docquet
Book, in May 1633. the Deanery of Worcester was granted to this Doctor; and
the grant signified to the signet office by the Bishop of London (Laud) who
procured him this preferment: What service Manwaring did in that Church in
setting up a Marble Altar, introducing Copes with other Popish Innovations, and
what Account he gave thereof to the Archbishop his Patriot, you may formerly
read, p. 81. under both their hands; which was such a Meritorious Work that in
few days after, the Archbishop procured a Conge d'eslier for him to the
Bishopric of St. David's in Wales; which was signed by the Archbishop
himself, as appears by the Docquet Book in the signet office (produced at
the Lords Bar) among the entries of December 1635. After which, himself
consecrated him Bishop of that See, as was proved by his own Diary, wherein he
entered this Memento with his own hand: Feb. 28. 1635. I consecrated Doctor
Roger Manwaring Bishop of Saint David's. So that this pair of malignant active
Popish Prelates, Mountague and Manwaring, received all their Ecclesiastical
preferments after the proceedings against them in several Parliaments, by his
procurement, in highest affront of their Authority and Censures; who obtained
likewise a Royal Pardon procured for them, entered in the Docquet Book, Jan.
1628. Both drawn according to his Majesty's pardons of Grace granted to his
subjects at his Coronation, with some particulars for the pardoning of all
Errors heretofore committed severally by them, either in speaking, writing or
printing, whereby they might be hereafter questioned.

But to proceed to others; August 1628. we find in the Docquet Book a Conge
d'sliere, and Royal Assent by order from the Bishop of London for Doctor Mawe
(a known Arminian) to be Bishop of Bath and Wells: and the like in the same
Month for Doctor Richard Corbet (a professed Arminian and one well-affected to
Popery) to be Bishop of Oxford, by order from this Bishop, who afterward
promoted him to Norwich. In November, 1628, A Conge d'slier by his order too,
was directed to the Deane and Chapter of York to elect Samuel Harsnet then
Bishop of Norwich (a professed notorious Arminian well inclined to Popery) to
the Archbishopricke of York. Mart. 25. 1632. we find a Conge D'eslire to the
Dean and Chapter of Christ-Church to Elect Doctor John Bancroft Bishop of
Oxford, and in June following a Warrant for the restitution of the
temporalities of this Bishopric to him, both subscribed and signified by the
Bishop of London; and what a corrupt unpreaching Popish Prelate Bancroft was,
is known to all the University of Oxford. In October. 1632. We find these four
several Conge D'eslires all procured by order of this Prelate, then Bishop of
London. One to the Dean and Chapter of Winchester to Elect Walter (Curle)
Bishop of Bath and Wells to be Bishop of Winchester; Alike, to the Deane and
Chapter of Coventry and Lichfield, to Elect Robert (Wright) Bishop of Bristol,
to be Bishop of that See. Alike to the Deane and Chapter of Peterborough, to
Elect Doctor Augustine Linsell (an Arch-Arminian and very Popish and
Superstitious, as was attested by Mr. Peter Smart upon Oath, and the Author of
most of the Innovations in Durham Cathedral, who joined therein with Doctor
Cosins) Bishop of that See. Alike, to Elect Doctor Pierce Bishop of Bath and
Wells. Now how active all these Prelates were to set up Altars, introduce all
Popish Ceremonies, suppress Lectures, silence Ministers, promote the Book of
sports, advance Arminianisme and Popery, has been already manifested in the
premises: And we find that Doctor Lindsell was afterward translated to the
Bishopric of Hereford Jan. 1633. and this Bishop of Winchester made the Kings
chief Almoigner in June 1637. by Order of this Archbishop. In October. 1635. we
meet with in the Docquet Book a Conge D'eslire and Letter to the Dean and
Chapter of Norwich, to Elect Matthew Wren Bishop of Norwich, both signified by
this Archbishop of Canterbury; and the like for his translation to Ely, March
17. 1637. by Order from this Archbishop. Now what an Arminian and Popish
Innovator this Prelate was in all particulars (the Popish furniture of whose
Chapel with Basins, Candlesticks, Corporalls, Altar-cloths, A Chalice with a
cross upon it, and other Popish Trinkets as appears by his own Book of
Accounts costing him 159. l. 4. shil. 1. d.) and how great a persecutor,
silencer, supresser of Godly Ministers, people, the world experimentally knows,
and the premises demonstrate. We could instance in sundry English and Welsh
Bishops more of the same strain who were all advanced by his order, means, as
namely By Neal made Archbishop of York by him; (an Arch promoter of Arminians,
Popish Clergy men and all Popish Innovations:) Dr Iuckeson, first made Bishop
of Hereford, afterward of London, and Lord Treasurer by this Archbishop: A man
though of a mild temper; yet as Superstitious, as Popish as most of the
former; and his Visitation Articles (especially the last enforcing the New
Cannons and Etcetera Oath) as Superstitious and Vile as any: Doctor Duppa
Bishop of Chichester, a known Arminian and very Superstitious: Doctor Skinner
Bishop of Bristoll, and after of Oxford, a man tainted with Arminianisme, and
very much addicted to Popish Superstitions, Innovations; with sundry others;
but these shall suffice. Only we cannot pretermit a notable Letter of Dr. John
Towers to Sir John Lamb, to be a Mediator to his Grace, to confer the
Bishopric of Peterborough upon him; which Letter intimates, that all
Bishoprics and Ecclesiastical Preferments were then in his disposal.

Worthy SIR,
I Intended only my hearty Thanks to you in this Letter, for what I read in
your last Letter to my Lord Bishop, concerning my self; and your true Love in
that I shall ever acknowledge with a sincere heart. But now Sir, I must entreat
leave of you, that I may join an earnest suite to my thanks. My Lord Bishop, I
hear, is to be translated to Hereford, and I am not thought on to succeed him.
I dare not write to my Lords Grace of Canterbury. But I dare hope of his
goodness to me, and that he will commiserate my case, when he shall be truly
informed of my need, and what an utter discredit it will be to me in my
Country, when I shall be intercepted by whomsoever, now the third time, after
that his Grace did encourage me to pitch upon this Bishopric Note
in his house at Westminster. In truth Sir, if I miss of it this third time, I
shall have no Joy to show my face in the Diocese. Therefore I beseech you, that
you will speedily be my earnest Solicitor to his Grace, that if for no other
reason, yet out of mere compassion I may not be so utterly disheartened. I
could be as glad to see Doctor Sibthorp in the Deanery almost as my self in the
Palace. Your interest in his Graces Love, may be a powerful Mediator for us
both. Good Sir delay not the time, to commend my cause to his Grace; in whose
goodness I cannot but have great confidence. I heartily commend you to Gods
grace, and will ever be,

Your very thankful friend. Jo. Towers.
Peterborough, Sept. 30. 1638.

What effect this Letter produced, appears by the Docquet Book, October. 29.
1638. Where we find both a Conge De'slire, and Letter to the Dean and Chapter
of Peterborough, to Elect this aspiring Dr. for their Bishop, both drawn up, by
Warrant from this Archbishop of Canterbury. Belike Sir John Lamb found this
Doctor very thankful for his promotion according to his promise, the rather,
because we find in the Docquet Book, November. 5. 1638. A presentation of this Dr
Towers to the Rectory of Caster in the diocese of Peterborough, by order from
the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury. Who as he disposed of all Bishoprics in
England, so likewise in Ireland even whiles he was Bishop of London and since,
as appears, not only by sundry Letters from Doctor Usher Primate of Ireland,
and other Irish Prelates, found in his Study, but by several Writings and
Warrants under his hand for disposing Bishoprics there; we shall instance
only in three.

The first of them (seized in his Study by Mr. Prynne) is thus indorsed with
the Archbishops own hand. Mr. Lancasters Reasons why he should be Archbishop of
Cassils, though he be thought too young.

Maii 21. 1629.
WHereas the Lord Bishop of London objected against my age, as being under 50.
Your hon^our may be pleased, if it shall be insisted upon, to make known to his
Majesty, that the lamentable estate of that Church is such, that it is
requisite he should be active, able, and wealthy, rather then old and
decrepid, that should have that Bishopric, to prosecute the recovery of the
revenues thereof, where the last Archbishop left, who spent and spoiled
himself in the prosecution thereof, and so shall any other that shall
undertake that, unless he shall be of competent age, and shall have his
Majesty's gracious favor and furtherance therein. Again, gravity, sobriety,
sincerity, integrity, courage, counsel, goodness, godliness, hospitallity,
and charity are more to be regarded in that Country, (where they pry with
Eagles eyes into our lives and conversations, but will not hear our doctrine)
then old age, where he shall not long want gray hairs, if suites, troubles,
molestations, vexations, persecutions, and afflictions can procure them.
Again, it is held by most, that neither Saint John the Evangelist, nor Timothy
the first Bishop of the Ephesians, were above 30. years old, and yet our
Savior made choice of the former, and Saint Paul of the latter, says in the
first of Tim. 4. and 12. Let no man despise thy youth.


By this its apparent that the power of disposing the Archbishopricks and
Bishoprics in Ireland were in this Prelates hands, and that he rejected or
advanced whom he pleased there; and therefore must be satisfied,

The second is this Note writ with this Archbishops own hand found among
Secretary Windebanks Papers, who thus endorsed it. Jan. 1634. My Lord of
Canterburies Note for George Andrews Dean of Limbrick to be Bishop of Fernes
and Laughlin.

George Andrews Dean of Limbricke to be Bishop of Fernes and Laughlin: To hold
in Commendam any thing he has saving the Deanery. The Bishopric is void by
the death of the late Bishop thereof. You must draw up a Letter accordingly out
of hand.

W. Cant.


Thirdly, A Warrant thus endorsed with the Archbishops own hand; A Warrant for
the Bishop of Limericke; writ by his Secretary Dell, and signed by himself in
this form: which will demonstrate the form of all his other Orders and
Warrants to the Signet for the forementioned English Bishops.

SIR,
YOu are to prepare a Bill for his Majesty's Signature after the usual manner,
containing a grant of the Bishopric of Limericke in Ireland, now void by the
death of the late Bishop there, to George Web Doctor in Divinity, and one of
his Majesty's Chaplains in ordinary. And for so doing these shall be your
Warrant.

September. 22. 1634. W. Cant.
To the Clerk of his Majesty's Signet attending.

His Authority in disposing the Bishoprics in Ireland was so absolute, that
William Bishop of Cork and Rosse in his Letter to this Archbishop. Aug. 7.
1640. (after he had passed through one or two Bishoprics there) writes thus by
way of acknowledgement to him for his preferments there; What I had or have is
of your Graces goodness, under him who gives life and breath, and all things;
and under our gracious Sovereign, who is the breath of our nostrels.

The like we could prove for Scotland: and what kind of Popish and Arminian
Bishops he there preferred, themselves have sufficiently declared in their
Charge against him, and other See Master Baylies Canterburian selfeconviction.
Writings.

Not to insist upon his earnest endeavor and contest to promote Dr. Theodor
Price Vice-Deane of Westminster, to a Welsh Bishopric, as the fittest man in
his conscience of all others, who lived a professed Unpreaching Epicure,
Arminian, and dyed a reconciled Papist to the Church of Rome soon after,
receiving extreme unction from a Popish Priest, who missed the Bishopric only
by the Noble Earl of Pembrooks opposition, to which Dr. Owen was preferred in
his stead.

We shall pass from Bishoprics to Deaneries. To pretermit his advancement of
Dr Manwaring, Dr Wren, Dr Duppa, and others to Deaneries, ere they were made
Bishops. December. 1635. the Deanery of Worcester was granted to Dr Christopher
Potter (a professed Arminian, which Dr. Featly attested) by signification and
order of this Archbishop of Canterbury, as the Docquet Book records: to whom he
submitted the correction of his Book entitled, Want of Charity; and imputed
his preferments, witness this Doctors own Letter to the Archbishop, the
original whereof, attested by M. Prynne, was produced and read, as follows.

My most honored Lord,
I Humbly thank your Grace for very many Demonstrations of your Love to me,
and particularly for your last favorable mediation to his Majesty in my
behalf, for a Prebend in Windsor. The convenience of that preferment (if my
Sovereign Master please to confer it on me) I shall value much more then the
profit: But how ever resolve, not to prescribe to your Grace, much less to his
Majesty, or with immodesty or importunity to press you. I bless God for what
I have, and hope he will give me the grace to rest well contented with my
present condition, what soever it is. In the means while my Lord, the
Obligations which I have to you are such, as I can never satisfy, but with my
prayers, which shall be constant, that your Grace may long live with honor and
comfort Note.
to serve God, his Majesty, and this Church; which daily feels the benefit of
your wisdom and goodness, etc.

Your Graces in all humility. Chr. Potter.
October. 6. 1633. Queens College.

In April 1635. We find in the Docques Book a Presentation of Dr Richard Bailey
(generally reputed an Arminian, and Popishly affected) to the Deanery of Sarum,
by Order from this Archbishop. In October 1638. Dr Thomas Jackeson, a professed
Arminian (as Doctor Daniel Featly his fellow-Collegian attested) was made Dean
of Peterborough, by the order and procurement of this Archbishop. By his
means, Bishop Wren was made Dean of his Majestics Chapel: And to conclude
with one notable instance more instead of all others. October 16. 1640. the
Deanery of Peterborough was granted to Doctor John Cousin; by signification and
order from this Archbishop, who promoted him to this dignity by his own
confession, th^^ written with his own hand and attested by M. Prynne: I
presented four of his Majesty's Chaplains in ordinary to his Majesty for the
Deanery of Peterborough: His Majesty pitched upon Doctor Cosia in regard his
means lying in the Bishopric of Durham was in the Scots hands, and nothing
left to maintain him, his wife and children, but a poor Headship worth 40. l.
per anuum; And out of the same consideration, and no other, did I put his name
with the rest to his Majesty. What an Arch-Promoter of Popish Doctrines,
Ceremonies, Innovations this Dr Cousin was, appears by the Sea p 70. 73, 74.
78. 193.
premises; and Master Peter (...) testimony of him upon Oath, and what a recall
intimate friend this Arch bishop was to him, what a Patri^t and Protector of
him against al Prosecutions, might be evidenced by sundry Letters passing
between them, over tedious to recite, the Originals whereof, found in the
Archbishops Study, we have ready to produce.

For Clergy men infected with Arminianisme, Popery, and devoted to Popish
Ceremonies, (...) by him to be Chaplains in ordinary to his Majesty, and the
Prince his Highness; to corrupt their Persons, Courts, in the Theory and
Practice of Religion; we shall instance only in these ensuing: Dr Richard Bailey
Deane of (...); Dr Thomas Turner, Dr William Heywood, Dr Richard Marsh: Dr
William Hutchinson: (all formerly his own Chaplains, as appears by a list of
his Chaplains since he was Bishop, written with his own hands) Dr Peter
Heylin; Dr William Brough, Dr William Jews, Dr Thomas Laurence, Dr Samuel
Baker; Dr Richard (...), Dr John Cousin, Dr Walter Raleigh, Dr William Watts: Dr
Benjamin Layney, Dr Thomas Bletchenden, Dr William Beal, Dr James Brown
(advanced to be Deane of Hereford by his means of whose Popish Practices Page.
69.
we formerly gave evidence) Dr Andrew Clare, Dr Christopher Dow, Dr Lushington;
and Dr John Pocklington: How much many of these were addicted to Arminianisme,
Popery and all Popish Ceremonies, has been formerly attested upon other
occasions; that the rest of them were of the self same strain, is so
notoriously known in the Court, our Universities, the places where they live,
to your Lordships and the Archbishop himself, that it needs no other proof:
That these were made his Majesty's and the Princes Chaplains, by this
Archbishops procurement, who usurped upon the Lord High Chamberlaines office to
nominate Chaplains in ordinary to his Majesty (which stone of his
Predecessors did since the Reformation) was attested by Mr Oldisworth a Member
of the Commons House, who deposed; That upon his knowledge for 25. years space,
it did belong to the Lord Chamberlaines office, to nominate and appoint the
Kings Chaplains in ordinary, and so it continued all the old LordWill. Earl of
Pembrookes Chamberlainship: And this the difference of the Warrants proves: For
where the Kings Warrant runs; These are to signify his Majesty's pleasure:
there the King is to be consulted with before the place is granted; as in the
Warrant and case of the Bedchamber-men. But where the Warrant is, These are to
Will and require you to admit such a one, as in the case of the Kings
Chaplains, there the Lord Chamberlain does all by his own authority without
consulting with the King. That since the present Earl of Pembrooke was Lord
Chamberlain, the Archbishop took upon him to recommend all Chaplains to the
King, and many of them were his own Chaplains first: which the Earl of
Pembrooke himself seconded.

Mr Oldisworth likewise delivered in a list of the Kings and Princes Chaplains
in ordinary as they stood, Feb. 12. 1640. produced at the Bar. Two of these
Chaplains, to wit, Doctor William Heywood, and Doctor Samuel Baker, with his
own Arminian Chaplains, Doctor Edward Martyn, Doctor William Bray, and Doctor
Thomas Weeks (whom he openly denied to be his Chaplain before the Lords, till
Mr Prynne proved the contrary by a list of his Chaplains under his own hand,
affixed to the end of his Written Diary) were the Licensers of all the
forementioned Arminian and Popish Books published in our Realm, and the
Purgatory Doctors, who obliterated all the forecited Passages against Popery,
Arminianisme, Popes, Jesuits, Papists, out of our orthodox Writers. Others of
them were Authors of sundry Arminian, licentious, Popish Impressions: As
Doctor Heylin, Doctor Laurence, Doctor Cousin, Doctor Watts, Doctor Dowe, and
Doctor Pocklington; Whose Books were some of them written, others of them
printed by the Archbishops command, some of them with, others without the
Authors privity. Amongst these we shall instance only in Doctor Pocklingtons
Books, the most Popish, Impious, and profane of any other; Who though lately
dead before this Trial, yet speaks loud enough to this purpose, in his
Petition to the House of Peers before his censure, here remaining upon the
File of Petitions.

A Copy whereof we have here subjoyned, compared with the Original, by which
you may clearly discern by whose command his Popish Impressions were Printed
and Published, even by this Archbishops, who perused them before they were
printed.

To the right Honorable the Lords spiritual and temporal now Assembled in
the High Court of PARLIAMENT.
The humble Petition of John Pocklington Doctor in Divinity, and Rector of
Yevelden, in the County of Bedford.
Most humbly shows,
THat he is right hearty sorry for doing or bringing any thing into his said
Church, without the direction of his Reverend Diccesan, and dares not go about
in any sort to justify his doings: But waving all manner of defense, he most
humbly casts down himself at your Lordships Feet, beseeching you for Christ's
sake to look upon him with the eye of mercy, who, with a most penitent and
sorrowful heart confesses his mis-doing in the Premises, etc.

And whereas your Petitioner is charged to have set forth and published two
Books, wherein he defends not only Innovations in Religion, but diverse Popish,
Wicked, and Antichristian points, and casts reproach upon our English
Martyrs, Note.
in Mr Foxes Callender, and magnifieth Popish Canonized Saints, for true
Martyrs.

He does most humbly give your Lordships to understand, That order was given
for their Printing, and setting forth, without your Petitioners procurement,
motion, or knowledge; who composed them for his own private satisfaction, and
to be the better satisfied, was willing to have them presented to the
consideration of the Reverend Governors of our Church to receive their Opinion
and Judgment about them: And for the Contents of the said Books, If any
Popish, Wicked, or Antichristian points be in them; He is ready and most
desirous from his heart utterly, and openly to abandon and abjure them: But
hops that because the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, did see, and
read all or a great part of them, (as Note.
his Chaplain Dr Bray could your Petitioner) and did without any suite of your
Petitioner, give order and allowance for their Publishing: That no such
detestable points are contained in the said Books: and for our English Martyrs
in Mr Fox his Calender, There is no mention, or any word, or syllable in either
of those Writings about them.

Wherefore again and again, he casts down himself before this most
Honorable Assembly, and beseeches you (who upon earth represent the God of
mercy.) to show mercy to him, who is altogether innocent in moving to have the
said Beekes Published; And it truly penitent for what he has done without his
Diccesans Directions; and most humbly beseeches his Lordship, now present, to
admit his Submission, and to be a means to obtain the favor of this most
Honorable House, and to procure his freedom and dismission, who voweth by
Gods grace, to be ever hereafter so careful of all his words, and actions,
that neither the Church, nor any Member thereof, shall take any offense, or
displeasure at him.

Vera Copia.

And your Petitioner shall ever pray for the happi success of this present
Parliament. John Pocklington.

Now what a Capital Crime and transcendent misdemeanour it is for this
Arch-Prelate to place such Arminian Popish Prelates, and Chaplains in ordinary
about his Majesty, and the young Prince (more infectious then See Cooks 4.
Instit. p. 90.
Cardinal Wolsies breath, to King Henry the 8. when infected with the great
Pox) to seduce, poison them, as much as in them lay, with Arminian and Popish
Errors, Superstitions, Ceremonies, and in and by them their whole kingdoms
and National Churches; and that not only by transient verbal Sermons (which
infect only the ears of the Auditors for the present) but by pestilent printed
Treatises, which corrupt the eyes, judgment, of the Readers, and universally
seduce both the present and future generations more then any public verbal
Sermons, though never so pernicious to the Auditors for the present, let all
wise men judge.

For his promoting of Arminians, of persons addicted to Popish Ceremonies,
Errors, Innovations, to Offices and Headships in our Universities to poison
those fountains of Piety and Learning, we shall instance in these few
Particulars. During the time of his Chancellorship in the University of Oxford,
from April 1630. till Anno, 1641. it is observable, that he nominated only five
Vice-Chancellors to govern the University under him; namely Dr Smith, Warden
of Wadham College; Doctor Brian Duppa, Deane of Christ-Church (whose further
promotions he procured) Doctor Pinke, Warden of New-Colledge, Doctor Bailey,
President of Saint John Baptist College, Doctor Frewen President of Mary
Magdalen College, Dr Christopher Potter Provost of Queens College; (as the
University Register undenyably proves, and all Oxford Scholars can attest;)
all deeply tainted with Arminianisme, great Promoters of all Popish
Innovations, Superstitions, Ceremonies, in that University, as we have Here p.
70; 71, 72, 73.
formerly manifested. Besides, he promoted Doctor Thomas Iackeson, a professed
Arminian, to the President-ship of Corpus Christi College in Oxford, and
afterward to the Vicaridge of Witney, as appears by the Docquet Book, to
omit his advancement of Doctor Laurence, and other such like Popish Doctors
there.

What heads of Houses he promored in the University of Cambridge; and what
professed Arminians and Well-wishers to Popery they were, you have Here p. 73,
74, 193, 167.
already heard in part; we shall only repeat the names of some of them,
Doctor Brooks, Doctor Beal, Doctor Martin, Doctor Cousin, Doctor Layny, Doctor
Stern, men very infamous both for Arminian and Popish Errors.

And not content to corrupt our English Academies, he promoted Master Chapple,
the Archest and most notorious Arminian in the University of Cambridge, who
leavened all his Pupels and many hopeful Scholars with Arminianisme (as Mr
Walker and others witnessed) to the Provost-ship and Government of the College
and University of Dublin in Ireland, (as appears by sundry original Letters
thence, endorsed with his own hand, and himself must needs acknowledge) whom
he brought into that place with an high hand, where he did much hurt by venting
his Arminian druggs, and maintained Justification by Works: Exemption of the
Clergy from the Secular power, and was very active in the Synod there, in
suppressing the Articles of Ireland against Papists and Arminians, (as was
Doctor Bramhall too, his grand Arminian Popish Instrument there) as was
attested upon Oath by Dr Hoyle, a Member of the Assembly, and Divinity Reader
in that University.

His advancements of Persons tainted with Arminianisme, Popery and Popish
Superstitions, to Benefices, Prebendaries and other Ecclesiastical
preferments, are almost numberless, as we find by the Docquet Books; all or
most of the Ecclesiastical Preferments belonging to the Crown being disposed
of by him alone of latter times, not by the Lord Keeper and Master of the
Wards as formerly, upon whose Presentations he encroached. We shall instance
in some few of many.

In September 10. 1628. Doctor Augustine Lindsey by order from this Bishop, and
a Letter by him procured from the King in his behalf to the President and
Chapter of Litchfield, was promoted to a dignity in that Church, as appears by
the Docquet Book: Mr George Walker the Minister attested upon Oath, that this
Lindsy (whom the Archbishop afterward made a Bishop) was reputed one of the
chief heads of the Arminian faction: and that Dr Bastwick writing against the
Arminians, and bowing at the name of Jesus, was sent to him by this Archbishop
to be instructed and refuted, as the ablest of that party. Mr Peter Smart a
Reverend Divine deposed; That this Doctor was an Arch-arminian to his
knowledge, with whom he had frequent disputes, a defender and setter up of
Images and Altars: That he said in his hearing; That none but ignorant
Calvinist Bishops did put down Altars at the beginning of reformation; and that
they were worse then Jesuits: That he was much offended with the Homilyes
against the Peril of Idolatry, against setting up Images in Churches, and
said, that he would have these Homilyes put out of the Homily-Book, Note.
and wondered why they were suffered to continue in it so long. A fit
Cathedralist to make a Bishop afterward; and a great companion and friend of
Sancta Clara.

In October. 1631. Peter Heylin (this Arch-Prelates great Creature and Votary,
who resigned himself to his directions and command in all things, as appears
by an Epistle in a Manuscript Sermon of his found in the Archbishops study) was
by his order and procurement presented to the Rectory of Hemingford; and in
November following to a Prebendary in Westminster; and in November 1632. he
procured him a Presentation to the Rectory of Haughton in the Diocese of
Durham. In September 1631. Dr Thomas Bletchenden by his order and procurement
was promoted to a Prebends place in the Cathedral of Canterbury; and Dr
William Bray to another Prebendary in the same Church November 13. 1637. by his
order too. Mr Thomas Lushington was by his order presented to a Prebendary in
the Cathedral Church of Sarum in June 1931. Dr John Weeks in December 1633.
was by his order presented to a Prebendary in the Cathedral of Bristol: Dr
Brian Duppa Jan. 1633. was by his order presented to the Chancellorship of
Sarum and the Prebendary of Bridgenorth thereto annexed; and May 19. 1638. to
the Rectory of Petworth. Dr John Bramhall June 1632. was by his order presented
to a Prebendary in York Cathedral. Dr William Beale October. 1637. was by his
order and procurement presented to the Rectory of Paul's Perry, of which two
others were unjustly deprived in the High Commission to make way for his
promotion to it. Dr William Brough Jan. 19. 1938. by his order was presented to
a Prebends place in the Church of Windsor. In May 1639. by his order Dr Samuel
Baker was preferred to a Prebends place in the Cathedral of Canterbury, and
Tho. Brown to a Prebends place in the Collegiate Church of Windsor. July 29,
1640. Dr Mumford by his order was presented to the Rectory of Anesby: what
other Arminian, Popish, Superstitious, Scandalous Persons were advanced to
livings by him, and how he poisoned our Church with such almost in every place,
the World may see at large in Mr John Whites first Century of Scandalous
Ministers. We shall only add this one thing more; that even after his
Commitment for high Treason he still interposed in preferring Superstitious
Episcopal Clergy men of his faction to his Majesty's livings as well as to
those in his own gift; as we shall evidence by this Letter of his to the King
(seized by Mr Prynne among his other Papers) all written and thus endorsed with
his own hand; For the Kings most Excellent Majesty; which was answered by the
King himself in the Margent with his own hand in this ensuing form.

May it please your Majesty,
I Conceive the Great Seal being left as it is, your Majesty will bestow all
such livings as shall be void, and were usually in the gift of the Lord
Keeper, of what value soever they be.

You are right.

This I took my duty to put your Majesty in mind of, since it in part
belongs to the service which your Majesty was wont to trust me with. And I am
the more bold to put your Majesty in mind of this; because by this means (if
you please to make use of it) you may the sooner provide both for the
Scottish-men which suffer, and for other men which have served your Majesty at
sea. At this time I am informed that the Rectory of Ashen in Northamptonshire
is void and in your Majesty's gift. It is thought not to exceed one hundred
pound a year. The Bishop of Brechen has a son (if your Majesty please) that
is ready to take Orders, and may be fit for it.

Give Order accordingly. C. R.

And by that means may be some help to his father, who certainly needs it.
If your Majesty like of this, and let me know so much, I shall give warrant
for it accordingly. But I submit all this, and my own unhappy condition, to
Gods will and your Majesty's.

Your Majesty's most humble servant though unfortunate, W. Cant.
Jan. 3. 1640.

What a Plague and Poison these Arminian, Popish Prelates, Deanes, Prebends,
Heads of houses, Parsons and Vicars thus advanced by him proved to our Church,
how near they had reduced us back to Rome, and how much they endangered the
utter extirpation of our Protestant Religion, is so experimentally known to
all men, so plentifully evidenced in the premised proofs, that we may
confidently averr, had not God himself miraculously from heaven by the late
Scottish Troubles and happy convention of this present Parliament retarded,
prevented and utterly frustrated their dangerous proceedings and Jesuiticall
designs, in these three kingdoms, in all probability we had long ere this
been totally overrun with Popery, and the zealous Professors of the Protestant
Religion in all three been either totally extirpated and massacred, as some
hundred thousands of them have been of late in Ireland, or banished their own
Country into foreign Climes, or left to the mercy of the bloody Papists and
these their Popish Confederates, whose tender mercies are but cruelties. This
crime then of his is no less then treasonable and capital, being so
destructive both to Church and Kingdom.

As he thus preferred Popish and Arminian Clergy men to the chief
Ecclesiastical preferments in our Church, so on the contrary (following the
counsel of See, Look about you.
Contzen the Mogountine Jesuit in his Politics) he discountenanced, suspended,
silenced, suppressed, censured, imprisoned, persecuted most of the prime
orthodox, diligent preaching Ministers in the Realm and forced many of them to
fly into America, Holland and other foreign places to avoid his fury, only
for opposing his Popish Innovations, and expressing their fears of the change
of our religion by the increase of Popery and Popish Superstitions. Not to
trouble you with any forementioned instances of Master Peter Smart, Mr Henry
Burton, Mr Snelling and others; we shall instance in some fresh examples.

Mr Samuel Ward of Ipswich, a most reverend, orthodox, and learned Minister of
special eminency, was by this Archbishops means on the 26. of November. 1635.
(as Master Samuel Wards Case.
appears by the High Commission Records,) censured in the High Commission at
Lambeth; and there suspended from his Lecture and Ministry, and every part
thereof till absolved by his Majesty, enjoined a public submission and
recantation, such as the High Commissioners should prescribe, condemned in
expenses and costs of suite, and committed to prison; For preaching in some of
his Sermons at Ipswich, against Bowing at the name of Jesus, the Book of
sports on the Lords day, and saying, that the Church of England was ready to
ring the Changes, and insinuating unto his Auditory, that there was cause to
fear an Alteration of Religion; saying, that Religion and the Gospel stood on
tiptoes ready to be gone; that diverse good Ministers were silenced, and that
they should beware of a relapse unto Popery. In this censure the Archbishop had
the chiefest hand, as was proved by the High Commission Books and Mr Wards
Submission, which was drawn up by Sir John Lamb and sent to this Archbishop,
who endorsed it with his own hand. This severe sentence utterly ruined this
famous painful preacher who lay long in prison, and soon after ended his
days in great grief and sorrow.

In April 1630. Articles were exhibited against Mr Charles Chancy, a Reverend
Mr Chancyes Case.
learned, painful Minister living at Ware, for preaching against the
Bacchanales and disorders used by many in the Christmas holy days, the
increase of Popery, Arminianisme, and using these expressions in a Sermon of
his, charged against him in his Articles, in January before: That Idolatry was
admitted into the Church, and that not only the prophets of Baal, but Baal
himself is received, and houses multiplied for the entertainment of them; and
with all saying, that the preaching of the Gospel would be suppressed: That
there wanted men of courage to tell the Superiors in the Church of their
neglect, for that there was increase of much Atheism, Popery, Arminianisme and
Heresy in our Church since the reformation of it, as at this time, wherein
Heresies were not only broached but maintained; whereby he raised a fear among
the people, and insinuated to them, that some alteration of Religion would
ensue and be brought in; and scandalized the whole Church of England and
Government thereof. To these Articles Mr Chancy gave in his answer upon Oath in
the High Commission the 21, of the same April: and the very next day, by Order
of that Court, the whole cause was referred to this Bishop (then of London)
being his ordinary; provided that if Mr Chancy did not submit himself to
perform his Lordships order therein, that then his Lordship, if it seemed good
unto him, might transfer the cause back again to be censured in this Court.
Whereupon Mr Chancy made a Submission to his Lordship in Latin, and soon after
was enforced to desert the Kingdom, and set sail for New England to avoid
further persecution. All which is manifest by the Original Articles, and Mr
Chancyes answer to them, found among Sir John Lambs sequestered Writings by Mr
Prynne; and by the Order of Reference and M. Chancyes Submission, endorsed with
the Bishops own hand, the chief Prosecutor of this cause.

To these we could add M. Cotton, M. Hooker, M. Davenport, M. Wells, M. Peter's,
M. Glover, and sundry other Ministers driven into New England, and other
Plantations; those that fled over into Holland to avoid his prosecution; with
some hundreds of Ministers questioned in the High Commission and elsewhere, by
his means, and there suspended, silenced for not publishing the Book of
Sports, or not submitting to his Popish Innovations. M. Salisbury was
questioned and troubled by this Prelate for these passages in his Sermon, on
Math. 24. 6. How many thousands have made shipwreck of faith and a good
conscience, renounced our true Church, stepped aside to Arminianisme, and from
thence (as it is the widest gate that opens toward Rome) relapsed to Popery.
Thus are we scattered in our Jacob, and divided in our Israel. The Low
Countries not long since (if not still) sighed as deeply, and mourned as
strongly, to find herself (as imperceivably) to be overgrowne with
Arminianisme. And what a faction is like to be in our deplorable England
between Popery and Arminianisme together, except God be more merciful and our
State the more vigilant and mindful, We shall see sooner then tell, and feel
sooner then see. Doctor Staughton, D. Sibbes, D. Tailor, D. Gouge, M. White of
Dorchester, M. Rogers of Dodham, with sundry more of our most eminent preaching
orthodox Divines were brought into the High Commission and troubled or silenced
for a time, by his procurement upon frivilous pretenses: But in truth, because
they were principle Props of our Protestant Religion, against his Popish and
Arminian Innovations. But omitting these we shall conclude this head with one
memorable instance more which comes very home.

Mr Nathaniel Bernard Lecturer at Sepulchers in London preaching at Antholins
Church in May 3. 1629. used this expression in his prayer before his Sermon. Oh
Lord open the eyes of the Queens Majesty, that she may see Jesus Christ,
whom she has peirced with her Infidelity, Superstition and Idolatry: This
Archbishop, then of Note.
London, was presently informed of this passage, attested by Walter Kirby an
Attorney of Bernards Inn. John Brown of Durham, Minister, and some others:
Whereupon the Bishop brought him into the High Commission, where after long
attendance, upon his Submission, this ensuing Order was framed.

Die Jovis viz. xxviii. die mensis Januarii Anno Domini juxta, etc, 1629. Coram
Commissionariis Regiis apud Lambeth Judicialiter sedentibus, present Thoma
Mottershed, Registrarij Regij Deputat:
Officum Dominorum contra Nathanielem Bernard Clericum. Prima Sessio Termini
Hillarij.
HIS appearance by bond was respited until this day, at which day and place
the said Nathaniel Bernard appeared personally, and then it being objected unto
him by the Court, that he had in a Sermon lately by him preached or otherwise,
delivered some Scandalous and undutiful speeches, derogatory to some particular
person of most eminent place, which the Court desired not to have there
repeated; and for that the said Mr Bernard had acknowledged his error Note.
in that kind, as some of the Commissioners there, unto whom he had submitted
himself, reported, and himself confessed; the Court was inclined upon his
submission, being a young scholar and a student in Divinity, to accept his
submission, and inclined to deal mercifully and favorably with him; yet
considering that his scandalous and undutifull speeches were of such high
nature as could not be well remitted or pardoned by this Court, without the
approbation and the good liking of his most Excellent Majesty: the Court
desired the Lord Bishop of London, to acquaint his Majesty therewith, and if
his Majesty upon understanding of the Cause would be graciously pleased to
pardon him and leave it to the Court, that then this Court, would take such
further order for his dismission, as they should think meet.

Mottershed.

The Copy of this Order, with another Paper containing the words, were both
endorsed with the Bishops own hand and found among his Papers by Mr Prynne, who
produced them. Mr Bernard not long after upon his submission was dismissed the
Court, After which repairing to the University of Cambridge to visit his
friends, he fortuned to preach at Saint Mary's Church there on the 6. of May
1632. in the afternoon; wherein he let fall diverse Passages concerning
preaching, the purity of Gods Ordinances, worship, and against the Introducers
of Popery and Arminianisme, which this Bishops creatures excepted against, and
speedily informed him off. Dr T. Cumber then Vice Chancellor, informs him of
this Sermon in a Letter of his May 22. 1632. wherein he writes in this manner.
I cannot but further advertise your Lordship in a word; that here was one Mr
Bernard, a discontinuer and a Preacher, as I hear, about London, who uttered
some offensive words concerning some Ceremonies, and Rites used in some
Churches, in a Sermon of his at Saint Mary's, and as I have heard in some other
Church before: I gave a decree to the Beadle to convent him, but he could not
be found: To which the Bishop returned this answer written with Mr Dells hand
and thus endorsed; May 27. 1630. A clause of my Letter to Dr Cumber concerning
Mr Bernard, etc.

I AM sorry you have been troubled at Cambridge with the distempered speeches
of any men in the Pulpit. And I must confess, I heard of both the particulars
you mention, before I received your Letter. That in St. John's, it seems they
have punished, Note.
and you do very worthily to join with them, in case any thing for the
public shall be further requisite. And as for Mr Bernard, I am the more sorry
for him, because he is in London within my Charge; Nevertheless if he have
done unworthily, I shall be very ready to assist you and the University in what
I may be able. And since you gave a Decree to the Beadle to convent him, and he
slipped away the while, I will do the best I can to send him back, there to be
answerable to the Government against which he has offended. And if he shall
refuse so to do, without giving better reason then I think he can, I shall
certainly suspend him till he do it. So in have I leave you, etc.

W. London.

Before this Doctors Letter the Bishop had received an information of the heads
of his Sermon from others thus endorsed with his own hand. May 6. 1932. Notes
of Mr Bernards Sermon at Cambridge; the particulars whereof are hereafter
expressed more at large in his own words.

Soon after Mr Bernard by this Bishops prosecution was brought into the High
Commission Court and forced to deliver in a Copy of his Sermon to the Bishop,
which he did: who excepted against these Passages in it, for which he was
articled against. Gods Ordinances for his public Worship are the glory of any
Nation. By Gods Ordinances here, I understand chiefly the Word, Sacraments and
Prayer, which if blended and adulterated with any Superstitious Innovations of
men, cease to be Gods Ordinances, and he ownes them no longer. It is not the
single having of Gods Ordinances for his public Worship, but the having of
them in their purity and integrity that dignifies a Nation. Gods Ordinances for
his public Worship in their Purity and Integrity are a sure shield between a
Nation and public ruin and desolation: For proof whereof, I challenge all
Records both divine and humane to produce one instance wherein God punished
any part of his Church with any National ruin and destruction, before they
had either departed from, or corrupted his Ordinances. The Apostle Romans 1. 16.
affirms of the preaching of the Word, that it is the power of God to
salvation. It is the means by which God manifests his omnipotent and
irresistible power in the conversion and salvation of all those who from
eternity were ordained thereunto, by Gods absolute and immutable Decree. This
seems to confute their error who think meanly and basely of these Ordinances
of God, which we have proved to be the glory of that Nation, where they are in
their purity and integrity. These men turn their glory into shame; for is there
not a generation of profane men among us, who are afraid and ashamed to
preach twice on the Lords day, to preach plainly, powerfully, and spiritually
to the souls and consciences of their people, least they should be accounted
Puritans? Many who are afraid to hear too often, especially on the week days
least they should be accounted Bible-bearers, and gadders after Sermons? Many
who are as much afraid to perform holy duties in their families, and to
speak like Christians as Peter was, who that his speech might not betray him,
began to curse and swear? Many who complain that there is too much preaching
and that it was never merry since? Many who esteem very meanly of prayer,
especially of the public prayers of the Church? Some that have scorufully
called the sirging of a Psalm a Geneva Iigge?

But the principal exception was for this ensuing Discourse in the close of
his Sermon.

Further, I will not deny that God has his true invisible Church among those
Nations, as he had in Israel in the days of Ahab and Eliah: nay, I see no
reason why (in a large, yet true sense) we may not call the Church of Rome,
Italy, or Spain a particular visible Church of Christ: as Israel in the Reign
of Jeroboem was a Church of God, though Idolatrous, and Apostaticall: Yet I
say, that it is imposible that any should be saved living or dying (without
repentance) in the doctrine and Idolatrous worship of the Church of Rome, as
the late Tridentine Council has decreed it. My reason is this; He that
thinks to go to heaven any other way then by faith in Christ only, shall
never Note.
come there. But he that dies without repentance in the Doctrine of the Church
of Rome (as the Council of Trent has decreed it) thinks to go to heaven
another way, then by faith in Christ only, as namely by the merits of his own
works; Ergo such a one shall never come there. Thirdly, if Gods Ordinances for
his public worship in their purity are the glory of a nation, then it
follows, that they who go about to deprive a Nation of any of Gods Ordinances
for his public Worship, either in whole or in the best part of them (idest) in
their purity and integrity, they go about to make that Nation base, and
inglorious and if so, then are they enemies to that Nation, and Traitors to it,
if it be their Note.
own Nation: for Treason is not limited to the royal blood, as if he only
could be a Traitor who plotteth and attempteth the dishonor and shedding
thereof, but may be and is too often committed against the whole Church and
nation, which last, is by so much the worst of them two, by how much the end is
better then the means, and the whole of greater consequence then any other
part alone.

Whereby we may learn, what to account of those among our selves (if any such
be, which is better known to you then to me) who endeavor to quench the light
and abate the glory of our Israel, by bringing in their Pelagian errors into
the Doctrine of our Church established by Law, and the Superstitions of the
Church of Rome into our warship of God, as high Altars, Crucifixes, and bowing
to them, id est (in plain English) worshipping them; whereby they Symbolize
with the Church of Rome very shamefully, to the irreparable Shipwreck of many
souls who split upon this rock. The Papists teach, that it is impossible to
be saved in our Church and our Religion: Some of ours (at least in outward
profession) teach, that it is possible to be saved in the Romish Religion and
Church; hence an unsettled judgment concludes, if we may agree in Heaven, why
do we not agree and meet each other half way on earth? And hence we have many
Cassanders among us, who meditate and wish a reconciliation between the Church
of Rome and ours; and to be sure (say the unsettled) it is the safest way to be
members of that Church wherein both sides agree that salvation is to be had,
then of that Church in which one side only affirms it, and that a party; And
this fills Rome with English proselites. What can we think less of those men
who by their Symbolizing with the Church of Rome in Doctrine and Worship give
occasion thereunto, then that they are enemies to this Church and Nation? I
say, they are enemies, and therefore let us take up arms against them. But
what arms? Preces Ecclesiae sunt arma Ecclesiae, let us pray these men either
to conversion (if it be Gods blessed will,) or to their destruction, fiat
justitia, pereant illi. And let us use that prayer against them, which David
used against Achitophell, with which I will conclude all; O Lord turn the
council of all these crafty Achitophells into folly, who go about to lay the
honor of this Church and Nation in the dust, by depriving us of the purity of
any of thy Ordinances for thy public Worship, which are the glory of this our
Israel.

For these clauses Mr Bernard was most severely sentenced in the High
Commission by this Bishops violent Prosecution; Suspended his Ministry,
excommunicated, fined a thousand pounds, imprisoned; condemned in costs of
suite, committed prisonet to the new Prison, where he lay sundry months, being
most barbarously used and almost starved for want of necessaries; of which he
complained to the Bishop by sundry Letters and Petitions found in his study
with Mr Bernards Sermon, and the informations against him, (endorsed with the
Bishops own hand and produced at the Bar) but could find no relief, unless
he would make this ensuing Recantation sent to him by the Bishop, and thus
endorsed with his own pen: Septem. 11. 1632 A Copy of a Recantation tendered to
Mr Bernard, Lecturer of Sepulchers, about a Sermon that he preached at
Cambridge. He refused this Recantation.

Mr. Bernards RECANTATION.
WHereas in a Sermon made by me in this place the sixth of May last upon this
Text. The glory is departed from Israel, because the Ark of God was taken. 1 Samuel 4. 21.

I had this Passage.

And the Apostle Romans 1. 16. affirms of the preaching of the Gospel, that it
is the power of God to salvation: Idest, it is that means by which God
manifests his omnipotent and irresistible power in the conversion and
salvation of all those who from Eternity were ordained thereunto by Gods
absolute and immutable Decree.

And I do here publicly acknowledge, that hereby (contrary to his Majesty's
command in his Declaration lately published and printed with the Articles of
Religion) I did go beyond the general meaning of that place of Scripture, and
of the said Articles. And draw the same to maintain the one side of some of
these ill raised differences which his Majesty's said Declaration mentions.
And this I did, rather out of a desire to thrust in somewhat into my said
Sermon in affirmation of one side of the said differences, then any ways
occasioned by the Text I then preached of.

For which I here publicly profess my hearty sorrow and do humbly crave
pardon of God Almighty, of his Majesty, and of this Congregation.

And whereas in the same Sermon I had this passage.

If Gods Ordinances for his public Worship in their purity are the glory of a
Nation, then it follows, that they who go about to deprive a Nation of any of
Gods Ordinances for his public Worship either in whole or in the best part of
them, id est, in their purity and integrity; they go about to make that Nation
base and inglorious; and if so, then are they Enemies to that Nation and This
Doctrine touched this Bishops Copy nold then, and was one principal charge of
^^gh Treason against him now; no wonder therefore he was ostended at it, and
would have it recanted.
Traitors to it, if it be their own Nation; for Treason is not limited to the
royal blood, as if he only could be a Traitor who plotteth and attempteth the
dishonor or shedding thereof, but may be and is too often committed against the
whole Church and Nation: which last is by so much the worst of them two, by how
much the end is better then the means, and the whole of greater consequence
then any one part alone.

Whereby we may learn what to account of those among our selves (if any such
be, which is better known to you then to me) who endeavor to quench the
light and abase the glory of our Israel, by bringing in their Pelagian Errors
into the Doctrine of our Church established by Law, and the Superstitions of
the Church of Rome into our Worship of God; as high Altars, Crucifixes, and
bowing to them, id est, (in plain English) Worshipping them; whereby they
symbolize with the Church of Rome very shamefully to the irreparable Shipwreck
of many souls who split upon this rock.

I do now upon better information find, that mary erroneous and dangerous
assertions and consequences unfitting to be here expressed may be collected
and inferred out of the said Words. And I do therefore hereby publicly
recant all the said words, as they are an use, or inference and application
used by me, to be very rashly and inconsiderately uttered, and to be very
undutifull toward his Majesty. I do humbly refer and submitt my self to
his Majesty's Clemency and gracious acceptance for the interpretation of my
meaning of the same. And I am heartily sorry, and do humbly crave pardon that
words and applications so scandalous to the present state of the Church of
England and so dangerous, proceeded from me.

Thirdly, whereas in the same Sermon I had this passage.

By Gods Ordinances here, I understand chiefly the word, Sacraments and
Prayer, in that purity and integrity wherein the Lord Christ left them, not
blended and adulterated with any Superstitious Inventions of man, for then they
cease to be Gods Ordinances and he ownes them us longer.

I desire that this passage may be taken and understood as I spoke and meant
it, and not otherwise; That is, not that I hold all humane Inventions added to
Gods Ordinances to be Superstiticus, for I account that tenet not only false
but palpably absurd and foolish. But to exclude all those humane Inventions
which may hinder the preservation of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church
of England in that Purity and Integrity wherein (through Gods gracious
goodness, by his Majesty's Laws Ecclesiastical) we do enjoy them.

Fourthly and lastly, whereas by some other passages in my said Sermon I was
(as I understand) conceived by some, not only to cast aspersions upon the
present State of our Church and some principal Members and parts thereof,
thereby to bring it and them into scandal and dislike: But even under some
ambiguous words, to move to take up arms for redress, although with recalling
or restraining the same in terms afterward and saying thus.

Let us pray these men either to conversion (if it be Gods blessed will) or to
their destruction. Fiat justitia, pereant illi: and calling them crafty
Achitophells, etc.

I do here acknowledge and profess I had no such Intentions, neither do I
know any cause why my self or any other should so bitterly invay against any
in our Church. I am therefore heartily sorry that I gave cause to any of the
hearers to conceive so. And I humbly crave pardon for it.

For refusing to make this strange prescribed Recantation, this godly Minister,
though he in general terms professed, his sincere sorrow and penitency for
any Oversights and unbeseeming Expressions in his Sermon, both in his Petitions
and Letters to the Bishop, (which would not suffice,) was for a long time
detained in the New Prison, there miserably abused by the Keepers, of which he
often complained without redress, and in conclusion utterly ruined for speaking
out the truth.

We shall close this branch of our Evidence with this observation; That as
Rewards and Punishments rightly distributed are the greatest incentives to
virtue, piety, learning, and retractives from vice, error, superstition; so
when they are perverted, misplaced, they become the grandest discouragements to
Piety, Religion, the strongest attractives to Heresy, Popery and all kind of
Superstitions; Scholars commonly look most of all after preferments; yea make
it their principal study to comply with those men's Opinions, and Practifes,
who are the chief Bestowers of them. No wonder therefore that our poor Church
was suddenly overspread with a generation of Arminian, Popish, Superstitious,
Ceremonious, profane, Prelaticall Clergymen, when all or most Ecclesiastical
preferments were in this Arch-Prelates disposal, who for the most part
advanced none but such, but discountenanced, suppressed, persecuted, and kept
back from preferments most orthodox zeal us preaching Divines who would not
comply with his Popish Innovations and Designs. It is very observable, that
the Archbishop himself records in his Diary, April 5. 1625. How he presented
to the Duke of Buckingham, by his command, a Schedule wherein the Names of
Ecclesiastical persons were written under the Letters O. (that is orthodox in
his sense, to wit, Arminians, or persons addicted to Popish Errors and
Superstitions) and P. (that is Puritans) who was to deliver them to King
CHARLES: Ever since which time Mountague, Manwaring, Wren, with such like
unorthodox Clergymen have been advanced, and all Puritans as they termed them,
kept from preferment; And it is as considerable what Mr Chaloner deposed to
this purpose: That being in Rome about five years since, Friar John (the great
agent there for our English Benedictines and Catholics) was very inquisitive
and demanded seriously of him, Whether the Archbishop of Canterbury had not the
bestowing of all Ecclesiastical preferments and livings in England, especially
those in the Kings gift? Seeming to be confident they were all then in his
dispose, and thereupon assuring himself, that he would advance such persons to
them as should be most favorable, most pliable to Popery and Papists, to drive
on their designs; as they did indeed with a witness, till this Parliament
employed their diligence and power to weed them out by Degrees. And therefore
his advancement of such unsound, corrupt, Popish Clergymen on the One, and
suppressing good Orthodox Preaching Ministers on the other side; must
necessarily import a most desperate design in him to supplant our established
Religion, by such a Generation of Vipers, who would eat out the very bowels of
their own Protestant Mother Church, and Religion by Degrees.

The sixth Branch of the Commons Evidence to make good their first General
Charge of the Archbishops endeavors to subvert our Religion and introduce
Popery.
WE shall now advance our progress from this to the sixth Branch of our
Evidence, to make good our general Charge of this Archbishops Traytorous
Practices and Endeavors to subvert our true Protestant Religion, and introduce
Popish Superstition, and Idolatry; to wit; His Iesviticall Practices, Plots and
Proceedings by himself and his Instruments to suppress the frequent and
powerful Preaching of the Gospel on Lordsdayes, Weeke-dayes, with all
Lecturers and Lectures throughout the Kingdom, and the Feoffees for
Impropriations, a principal means to maintain the same; and his silencing,
suspending many godly Ministers in all parts upon frivilous illegal Pretenses,
that so Popish Errors, Superstitions might flow in and grow up the faster,
with none or little public Opposition: This is fully charged against him in
the eleventh Original Article and sixth Additionall; which were read upon this
occasion.

The first and most pernicious Plot this Prelate laid to suppress Preaching,
Lectures and Lecturers, was drawn up by himself under his own hand soon after
the Parliaments dissolution in tertio Caroli, and presented by him to the King,
under this specious title which he gave it. Considerations for the better
settling of the Church Government: The Original draught whereof, written with
his own hand and found in his study by Mr Prynne, was produced and read in
form following.

Considerations for the better settling of the Church Government.
That his Majesty would be graciously pleased.

1. TO Command the Lords the Bishops to their several seas; excepting those
which are in attendance at Court.

2. That none of them reside upon his Land or Lease that he has purchased; or
on his Commendam if he hold any, but in one of his Episcopal Houses. And that
he wast not the woods where any are left.

3. That they give charge in their Tryenniall Visitations; and at other times
both by themselves, and the Archdeacons, that the Declaration for settling the
questions in difference be strictly observed. Note.


4. That a special Charge be given them against frequent and unworthy
Ordinations.

5. That a special Care be had over the Lecturers in every Diocese: Which by
Reason of their pay are the peoples creatures, and blow the Bellows their way.
Note.
Sedition.

For the abating of whose power these ways may be taken.

1. That the afternoon Sermons in all Parishes may be turned into Catechizing
by Questions and Answers, according to an Order set out by King James of
blessed Note.
Memory. If this cannot be, then:

2. That every Bishop ordain in his Diocese, that every Lecturer do read
Divine service in his Surplisse before the Lecture.

3. That where a Lecture is set up in a Market Town it be read by a Combination
of grave and orthodox Divines near adjoining.

4. That if an Incorporation do maintain a Lecturer he be not suffered to
preach till he take upon him Curam Animarum within that Incorporation.

6. That the Bishop do countenance and encourage the grave orthodox Divines of
his Clergy, and gain them in the several quarters of his Diocese to be
present at such Lecturers Sermons as are near them: That so the Bishop may
have knowledge.

7. That the Bishop suffer none under Noble men, and men qualified by Law, to

8. That his Majesty may be graciously pleased that men of courage, gravity,

9. That Emanuel and Sydny College in Cambridge, which are the Nurseries of

11. That some course may be taken that the Judges may not send so many
Prohibitions. Note.


12. That his Majesty would be graciously pleased once in half a year to

call for an Account of all, or so many of these as he in wisdom shall think
fit.

1. The general Feoffees for Benefices and preferment. 2. A new authorizing of
the Injunctions.
By this Original Paper, the main scope whereof is only to suppress
Preaching, Lectures, and extirpate all Lecturers by Degrees; it is apparent.
First, that this Prelate was the prime Projector, Promoter of all the
Jesuiticall Devices contained in these Considerations, and since put in
Practice in every Diocese to suppress Preaching, Lectures and Lecturers.
Secondly, that the specious pretense of having the Afternoon Sermons in every
Parish turned into catechizing; so much pressed and commended, was only a mere
pretense and wicked policy of purpose to suppress Lectures and undermine
Lecturers; None being enjoined to catechize but such as preached; none being
questioned for not catechizing if they preached not; and those that catechized
and preached too, or expounded, or used any other Catechism but that in the
Common-Prayer-Booke, being questioned and suspended as Delinquents. Thirdly,
that he not only recommends these Considerations to his Majesty, but moves him
to turn them into Injunctions, and to call for an Account every half year to
see how they were observed. Fourthly, that to effect and further this wicked
project, all his orthodox, grave Ministers are required to be present at
Lectures the better to turn informers against Lecturers that were honest and
painful. Fifthly, some Colleges must have new Governors appointed them to
prevent the growth of Puritanism: No new Bishops must be made but such who
would be active in putting this design in execution: The Kings own privy
Council must be specially enjoined to dance attendance at the High Commission
to punish such who transgressed these Prescriptions, and the Judges inhibited
to grant Prohibitions for their releife.

This foundation being laid, these Considerations of the Bishop were in a few
weeks after, with very little alteration, transformed and hightned into the
Title of Instructions from his Majesty; the Original Draught whereof we have
here present, interlined, altered with this Bishops own hand: and then in
December. 1629, they were sent in the Kings own name, as his own Regal
Injunctions, to the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and by them to all the
Bishops in their particular Provinces to see them punctually observed and put
in execution in every parish within their Diocese. One Copy of them was sent
by Archbishop Abbot to B^ Laud, then Bishop of London. In pursuit whereof he
summoned in all the Ministers and Lecturers within the City and Suburbs to
attend him at London House; where he made a solemn Speech unto them; Wherein
(as appears by the Notes of it under his own hand here produced) he pressed
obedience to these Instructions of his Majesty, which he said, had been
mistaken by some of them before it was possible for them to see, much less to
weigh them; adding, that they were full of Religion and Justice: that much good
would come to the Church and Commonweal by obedience to them; the want of
which obedience has lost us more ways then one. And professing he was sorry
there was need of those or any other; yet since there is need, and the
Government has found it so, he was glad of this occasion to know, and see
them together.

What these Instructions were, and how consonant to his own Considerations, We
shall manifest by an exact Copy endorsed with his own hand in this form.
December. 30 1629. Instructions from his Majesty concerning the Residence of
Bishops; and the Lecturers: with some Notes, exceptions, explanations upon them
in the margin, written likewise by himself.

CHARLES R.

Instructions for the most reverend Father in God, our right trusty and right
entirely beloved Councellor, George L. Archbishop of Canterbury: Concerning
certain Orders to be observed and put in execution by the several Bishops in
his Province.
1. THat the Lords the Bishops be commanded to their several Seas, (a) there
to keep residence, excepting those which are in necessary attendance at Court.
2. That none of them reside upon his land or lease that he has purchased, (b)
nor on his Commendam if he hold any, but in one of his Episcopal houses if he
have any: And that he wast not the woods where any are left. 3. That they give
charge in their Trienniall Visitations and at other convenient times, both by
themselves and the Archdeacons, that the Declaration for the settling all
questions in difference, be strictly observed by all parties. 4. That there be
a special care taken by them all, that their Ordinations be solemn and not of
unworthy persons. 5. That they take great care concerning the Lecturers in
their several Diocesses, for whom we give these special directions following.
1. That in all Parishes the Afternoon Sermons (c) may be turned into
Catechizing by Question and Answer, where and whenever there is not some
great cause apparent to break this ancient and profitable Order. 2. That every
Bishop ordain in his Diocese, (d) that every Lecturer do read Divine Service
according to the Liturgy printed by Authority, in his Surplisse and Hood before
the Lecture. 3. That where a Lecture is set up in a Market Town, it may be read
by a company of grave and orthodox Divines near adjoining and in the same
Diocese: And that they preach in Gowns and not in Cloakes, as too many do
use. 4. That if a Corporation do maintain a single Lecturer, he be not suffered
to preach till he profess his willingness to take upon him a Living with Cure
of Souls, within that Incorporation: and that he do actually take such (e)
Benefice or Cure, so soon as it shall be fairly procured for him.
6. That the Bishops do countenance and encourage the grave and orthodox
Divines of their Clergy, and that they use means by some of the Clergy or
others, that they may have knowledge how both Lecturers and Preachers within
their Diocesses behave themselves in their Sermons, that so they may take order
for any abuse accordingly. 7. That the Bishops suffer (f) none under Noblemen,
and men qualified by Law, to have any private Chaplain in his house. 8. That
they take special care that Divine Service be diligently frequented as well
for Prayers and Catechismes as Sermons, and take particular note of all such as
absent themselves as Recusants or other ways. 9. That every Bishop that by our
grace and favor, and good opinion of his service, shall be nominated by us to
another Bishopric, shall from that day of nomination not presume to make any
Lease for three lives or one and twenty years, or concurrent Lease, or any way
renew any Estate, or cut any wood or timber, but merely receive the rents due
and quit the place. For we think it a hateful thing that any man's leaving
the Bishopric should almost undo the Successor. And if any man shall presume
to break this order, (g) we will refuse at our Royal Assent, and keep him at
the place which he has so abused. 10. And lastly, we command you to give us an
Account every year the second of January, of the performance of these our
Commands.
Exceptions taken.
(a) This is broken. (b) And this. (c) This Catechizing must be by the
Catechism in the Com prayer book and no other. Diverse in London must preach too
or loose their means. They cannot agree upon the great Cause. (d) Whether this
bind the Parson or Vicar if he read the Lecture? Or all the Ministers where
there is a combination Unless it be upon the uery edge of a Diocese etc, (e)
And execut by himself: And whether it shall be sufficient to conform some
times, so the reading of Prayer be constant. (f) Excepted against in regard of
displacing many young men etc. (g) What if he do not let them till the Royal
Assent be past?


Dorchester.
How diligent he was to put these Instructions into execution within his own
Diocese, will appear by this Letter of his to his several Archdeacons; the
original whereof was produced, interlined with his own hand.

SIR,
THese are to let you understand, that his Majesty out of his Royal and
Princely Care that the Government of the Church may be carefully looked unto by
the Bishops and others with whom it is trusted, has lately sent certain
Instructions to my Lords Grace of Canterbury and of York, to be by them
dispersed to the several Bishops of each Diocese within their Provinces, to
the intent that whatsoever concerns any Bishops personally, or otherwise, in
reference to those of the Clergy which they are to govern, may be by every of
them readily and carefully performed. The Instructions which concern the
Persons to be governed, are only the third, for keeping the Kings Declaration,
that so differences and questions may cease, and the fifth about Lecturers, and
the seventh concerning private Chaplains in the Houses of men not qualified,
and the eighth about either Recusants or any other Absents from Church and
Divine Service; all the rest are Personal to the Bishops: yet because they are
so full of Justice, Honor and Care of the Church, I send to you the whole Body
of the Instructions as they came to me, praying and requiring you as
Archdeacon of London, to send me at or before Wednesday the third of February
next, both the Christian and Surnames of every Lecturer within your
Archdeaconry, as well in places exempt as not exempt, and the place where he
preaches and his quality and Degree. As also the Names of such men as being
not qualified keep Chaplains in their Houses. And these are farther to pray,
and in his Majesty's name to require you that you leave with the Parson or
Vicar of the place a Copy not of all, but of the four Instructions mentioned,
with the four several branches belonging to the Lecturers, with a Charge that
the Person or Vicar deliver another Copy of them to the Churchwardens; and that
you do not only call upon them for Performance, now presently, but also take
great care from time to time that at the End of your next Visitation, and so
forward at the End of every several Visitation, I may by your self or your
Officialls have true notice how they are performed, and where and by whom they
are disobeyed. For so much my Lords Grace of Canterbury requires of me as you
shall see by the Tenor of his Graces Letters to me here enclosed. I pray you
in any case not to fail in this, for if you should, when I come to give up my
Account I must discharge my self upon you, and that Neglect would make you go
backward in his Majesty's favor besides whatsoever else may follow; Thus not
doubting of your care and fidelity in this behalf I leave you to the Grace of
God, and shall so rest.

Your very loving Friend, Will. London
January 4. 1629.

Upon the publication of these Instructions (strictly pursued till this present
Parliament) Lecturers and Chaplains in private Gentlemen's houses were
generally questioned and suppressed in all places, with very great Rigor;
especially if they refused or neglected to read Common Prayers in their
Surplisses and Hoods before they Lectured: all Sermons on the Lords days in
the Afternoon were generally suppressed by degrees throughout the Kingdom:
most single, and many Combination Lectures were put down in every place; All
Catechismes, but that in the Common Prayer Book, prohibited; All Expositions of
Chapters or of the Catechism forbidden and laid aside; Wakes, Revels, Dancing,
and all kind of Recreations introduced, authorized, commanded by a Regal
Declaration, printed and published in the Kings name by this Prelate as we have
already proved, (and preached for in Pulpits, instead of Afternoon Sermons and
Catechismes on the Lords day) that people might go more merrily down to Hell,
and banish the thoughts of God and heaven out of their minds, on that very day
whereon they should mind them most. And that these Instructions might be the
better executed, this Prelate both before and after he was Archbishop, together
with Bishop Mountague, Bishop Wren, Bishop Pierce and others thrust them into
their Visitation Articles, and every Churchwarden and Sidesman on their Oath,
was to inquire after the Execution and Violation of them. If any doubt arose
upon these Instructions how to proceed upon them, not Archbishop Abbot, but
this Lording Prelate, was consulted with as the only Oracle, who best knew
their meaning, as being the contriver of them: Witness the Bishop of Bristols
Letter and Quaeres to him about his Majesty's late Instructions Febr. 12. 1629.
the Original whereof (indorsed with Mr Dells his Secretaries hand) found with
the former Papers in his study, was produced. If any neglect or connivance at
Lecturers was used in any place, information and complaint thereof was
presently sent up unto him; witness this one from Canterbury against
Archbishop Abbot himself: thus endorsed with this Prelates own hand Feb, 18.
1629. The Proceedings of the Dean and Archdeacon of Canterbury upon the Kings
Instructions.

MAster Deane and Archdeacon of Canterbury received from my Lords Grace a
Commission for the speeding of his Majesty's Instructions enforced by these
phrases. (It is expected that you should strictly put in execution these
matters which do concern either your selves, in your own persons, or the Clergy
that do remain within my Diocese, and this to be done, not as a thing of
form, or perfunctorily, but so that an account be made and returned to his
Majesty, what fruit there is of these Instructions, and how in the several
Diocesses they are performed. And therefore I pray you, and in the name of his
Highness require you to advertise me what is done in these particulars, and
whether there be due obedience unto these commands.)

Accordingly the Commissioners sent for Mr Palmer, a Lecturer in Saint Alphage
Canterbury on Sunday in the afternoon, who first denied to show any License;
Secondly certified that he had no License to preach there. Thirdly against the
Ministers will, he read Prayers and catechized but not according to Canon.
Fourthly, in that catechizing he undertook to declare the Kings mind in his
Instructions. Fifthly, he has never heretofore read Prayers or used the
Surplisse in that Parish. Sixthly, the Incumbent, a man licensed by three
Archbishops, petitioned that he might perform his own ministerial duties in
his own Parish. Seventhly, Mr Polmer preached a factious Sermon in the
Cathedral Church, and detracted from Divine Service there, Eighthly the
Incumbent for not joining with him is threatened to loose his tithes. Ninthly,
factious parties of all the Parishes in the Town are his auditors, where they
will not be forbidden to sit upon the Communion table.

Hereupon the Commissioners, willed Master Palmer to desist, and to give Master
Platt the Minister of the said-Church room, to do his duties himself, until
they might hear farther from my Lords Grace of Canterbury, and to him they
remitted him, sending up their reasons wherefore they did it.

They likewise sent for Master Vdnay Lecturer on Sunday in the afternoon at
Ashford, a Market town and the most factious of all Kent. Where though there
be a grave learned diligent Incumbent, and a Lecture beside performed every
Satturday by the grave neighbor Ministers, yet Master Vdnay was invited
thither by factious persons, such as are registered in the high Commission for
Conventiclers, whereupon he obtained a recommendation from the King, directed
to the Constable of Ashford, who in the Kings name charging the Incumbent to
admit him, thrust him up into the Pulpit, where he has ever since Lectured
directly contrary to the third instruction for Lectures, it being a great
discouragement to the Incumbent, Vdnay himself having had a Benefice near
that Town within eight miles, at which for this ten years he has never
constantly resided. For these reasons the Commissioners wished him likewise to
desist, and referd him to my Lords Grace of Canterbury, who has since replaced
him in Ashford by his License and Seal, and as we are informed has likewise
authorized Master Palmer.

By these proceedings the Commissioners are made the scorn of the factious.
They and all other conformable Orthodoxe Ministers are discomforted, his Note.
Majesty's Instructions are annihilated, and Master Archdeacon of Canterbury
is inhibited his Jurisdiction.

In his own Diocese of London many Lectures were suppressed, many Lecturers
and Ministers questioned, suspended by color of these Instructions, especially
if they used the least glances against Arminianisme and Popish Innovations, by
name Mr John Rogers of Dedham, Mr Daniel Rogers of Wethersfield, Mr Hooker of
Chemsford, Mr White of Knightsbridge; Mr Archer, M. William Martyn, M. Edwards,
M. Jones, M. Ward, M. Saunders; M. James Gardner, M. Foxly, with sundry others
being likewise, some of them driven out of his Diocese and the Kingdom too.

Bishop Wren in pursuance of these instructions, prescribed, printed and
published these ensuing Visitation Articles concerning Lecturers, in his
Diocese of Norwich, on which the Churchwardens were strictly enjoined to
enquire and present upon oath; as appears by his printed Articles, Anno. 1636.
Which were read in form following.

Concerning the Ministers, Preachers and Lecturers.
44. Have you any Lecturer in your Parish, and on what day is your Lecture? If
any such be, does he, twice at the least every year, read divine Service both
Morning and Evening, two several Sundays, publicly in his Surplice and Hood?
and also twice in the year Administer both Sacraments, with such Rites and
Ceremonies as are prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer?

45. Does the Lecturer, (whosoever he be) read the Divine Service according to
the Liturgy printed by Authority, in his Surplice and Hood before every Lecture?

46. Does your Preacher or Lecturer behave himself in his Lectures and Sermons
as he ought to do, teaching obedience and edifieing of his auditory in matters
of faith and good life, without intermedling with matters of State, or news,
or other discourses not fit for the Pulpit, and also without favoring or
abetting Schismatics or Separatists (that are at home or gone abroad) either
by special prayer for them, or by any other approbation of them?

47. Have you any Lecture of Combination set up in your Parish? And if so, is
it read by a company of grave and orthodox Divines, near adjoining, and in the
same Diocese? and does every one of them Preach in a Gown, not in a Cloak? And
when and by whom were they appointed? And what be their names?

48. Is any single Lecturer (maintained by your Town or otherwise) suffered to
preach, he not first professing his willingness to take upon him the cure of
souls, nor actually taking a Benefice or Cure, so soon as it may be procured
for him? What is his name? what license has he? And has he a settled
contribution affixed to the Lecturers place; or is it arbitrary, and for this
Lecturer only? What sum does it amount to ordinarily? By whom is it usually
paid or collected or of late years has been?

49. If any Psalms do use to be sung in your Church, before or after the
morning and evening Prayer, or before or after Sermons (upon which occasions
only they are allowed to be sung in Churches) is it done according to that
grave manner (which first was in use) that such do singe as can read the
Psalms and have learned them by heart? And not after that uncougth and
undecent custom of late taken up, to have every line first read, and then sung
by the people?

Concerning the Parishioners.
8. Is there within your Parish in any house or family, any one that is called
or reputed a Chaplain, or that is known or supposed to have entered into holy
Orders? Or any that live there in employment as a Scholar? Present their names
if there be any such, and how long they have been there.

Not long after, this Bishop in his Diocese of Norwich suppressed all
Afternoon-Sermons on the Lordsday throughout his Diocese; with most single
Lectures, Lecturers, and Combination Lectures too; which he permitted only
unto some few places after much Petitioning upon these hard conditions, which
he returned and certified to this Archbishop (from whom they originally
proceeded) in these ensueing terms, as appears by the Original under his own
hand, (found in the Archbishops study and attested by Mr Prynne.)

December. 7. 1636. IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN,
AN Account touching the Royal Instructions given by the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, to the most Reverend Father in God, William Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury his Grace, Primate and Metropolitan of all England, concerning
Orders to be observed by all the Bishops of that Province. To the several
Articles of which Instructions, I Matthew, Lord Bishop of Norwich, thus humbly
make answer, and in Order. Viz.
To the 5o Article, and the four branches thereof, I scarce found any
Catechizing used in the whole Diocese, some few places excepted; but I have
very strictly enforced it, and I presume it is now faithfully performed in most
Churches of the Diocese. Especially in the City of Norwich, there were not
above 4 Sermons on Sunday mornings in 34 Churches, only in the Afternoon they
had them. But I caused Sermons or Homilies to be had in every Church in the
forenoon, and Catechizing in the afternoon according to the Canon. Lectures
abounded, especially in Suffolk: Not a Market, or a bowling green, or an
Ordinary could stand without one, and many of them were set up by private
Gentlemen at their pleasures. At St. Edmunds Bury there were three: Two single
Lectures on Wednesday, and Friday (in either of their Churches one) and one by
Combination of neighboring Divines on Monday the Market day. The Combination
ending at Christmas last, of themselves they forbear to begin it again, till
they had fought to me for leave and order therein. I gave my consent and
allowed fifty choice Divines inhabiting within that Archdeaconry, upon these
two Conditions.

First, that the Divine Service being began duly by the Curate of the Church at
nine of the Clock, the Preacher for that day should be ready in his Surplisse
and Hood to begin the second Service at the Communion Table; and so should
assend into the Pulpit after the Nicene Creed, and there using no other prayer
then is prescribed in the 55. Canon, nor preaching above one hour, should not
give the Blessing out of the Pulpit; but should dessend again to the Table and
read the Prayer for the universull Church; and so dismiss the congregation
with the Peace of God etc.

Secondly, that the people of the Town should duly resort to the Church to the
beginning of Divine Service and there deport themselves with all Humility,
Reverence and Devotion, in kneeling, standing, bowing, being uncovered and
answering audibly. Both which conditions are joyfully and duly performed, as
well by the Preachers for their part, as the people, for theirs respectively:
The two single Lectures are likewise continued and performed upon the same
conditions. Only during the time of this Fast, I appointed the Friday Lecture
to be held on the Fast day also.

At Ipswich there has been no Lecture since Mr Wards censure: It was not
unknown to some of them, that if they had sought to have one, I would have
granted it, but they are resolved to have him or none; and him they make
account to have in despite of all censures.

At Yarmouth there has been no Lecturer these two years, ever since which
time more Peace has been in the Town, and good Order in Ecclesiastical things
much increased.

At Lyme their Lecturer dyed in February: They presently sought to have the
Curate of the place allowed to be Lecturer: I gave leave that he should supply
the place, till I might further enquire of him; but about Whitsuntide, he
voluntarily relinquished, and not without some contempt; whereupon I would not
suffer him afterward to return though some desired it.

At Norwich one Lecture is still held by Mr Cock, an honest conformable man of
whom they make no great regard. Other two have voluntarily relinquished,
because they will observe no Order, whereof one (Mr Bridge) has left two Cures
and is run into Holland.

The other Lectures in the Country Towns were at this pass: First, they
observed no Order at all in reading of the Divine Service, or in abstaining
from points of controversy, or in their habits. Secondly, Laymen had taken
upon them to put in and put out some Lecturers at their pleasure. Thirdly, the
people also knowing before hand who was to preach, when any factious fellow
came, would throng and hang upon the Windows; but if they did not fancy the
man, the Church was half empty, to the great discouragement of many who
complained thereof to me. Fourthly, they never sought to me to obtain any
allowances or to receive any order about them, whereupon (after more then half
a years expectation) some of them were inhibited until they sought leave of
their ordinary. Since they in Suffolk Petition was made to me. 1 From Debenham,
and I was ready to allow them a Lecture on the same conditions with St. Edmunds
Bury, which they went to consider of, but I never heard since from them. 2 From
Bergholt, (vulgo Baifeld) which is a Mile of Dedham in Essex. But it being no
Market Town, and I not finding a sufficient number of grave and orthodox
Divines near that part: and Dr. Jones (an eminent man their late Lecturer)
having often complained to me of their factious dispositions, I took time to
consider of it. 3 From Haverill, no Market Town also, where a young fellow had
thrust up himself without leave, Sede vacanie, to be their Lecturer, yet in
regard of his want of means I yielded; upon condition, that he should behave
himself orderly; and the Town should assure forty Marks per annum, for a
Stipend, which they have not yet done. In Norfolk from Wimendam and Eastharling
suite was made to me, but it was since the Fast began, whereupon I respited
them, till it pleased God that it might cease, and then I would be ready to do
to them as I had done at Bury. Besides these places before named. I remember but
three in Northfolke as yet inhibited: Viz. at Diss. new Buckenham, and
Northwalsham, and three in Suffolk; viz. at Ixmom, a Lecture started up by Sir
William Spring within these four years; at Cockefield, a private town, where
the said Knight bound his Clerk (when he presented him) to read a Lecture there
every Thursday, because Mr Knewstubs had for many years before done it: And at
Wickham where the Lecturer is no Graduate and has been a common Stage player,
a man of small abilities, and of whom many complaints were brought to me.

This Bishop Wren likewise prohibited, all ringing of Bells to give notice of a
Sermon to the Parishioners or others; Suppressed all Preparation Sermons to fit
men for the worthy receiving of the Sacrament; all Prayers before Sermons but
that enjoined by the 55. Canon; forbidding Ministers to use any Prayers after
their Sermons: Enjoined Note.
there should be no Catechisms used on the Lordsday instead of the Afternoon
Sermon, but only such Questions and Answers as are contained in the Common
Prayer book, not allowing Ministers to expound or open the points of the same
to the people, he and his Officers affirming in public places, that such an
Exposition might be as ill as a Sermon. And by color of these Instructions and
the Declaration for Sports he silenced, suspended at least fifty Ministers,
forcing many of them, and above three thousand people besides to desert the
Kingdom, and fly into Holland and New England; as appears by the Articles of
his impeachment, presented to the Lords by the house of Commons and by sundry
witnesses before several Committees. All which Exorbitancies issued from these
Instructions; and must be put on this Archbishops score, the Author of them, to
whom Bishop Wren and other Bishops gave an annual Account of their due
execution.

Bishop Mountague succeeding Bishop Wren in the Bishopric of Norwich, in
pursuance of these Instructions exceeded him in his Visitation Articles
concerning Lectures and Lecturers; as appears by these ensuing; printed both
at London and Cambridge: Anno. 1638.

4. Concerning Lecturers and Lectures.
Forasmuch as of late years the course and humor of Lecturing and the
frequenting and hearing such exercises, is of great resent in the State and
Church of England, (from which course, as much good may ensue and be procured,
if well and discreetly managed, so if otherwise, great hurt, danger and
scandal may and often does result; the cure and care whereof properly and
immediately belongs to the Bishop of the Diocese where such exercises are) the
Churchwardens and Sidesmen are given to understand, that there be amongst us
three sorts of Lecturers.

1 The first, most hugged, followed, admired and maintained, is a
super-inducted Lecturer in another man's cure and pastoral charge, who has
some resemblance to the ancient Catharist in the Primitive Church, but is up
and down the same with the Doctor in the New Discipline; which (I take it) is
the motive of his so great approbation and good entertainment above the
Incumbent of the Cure, though never so learned and painful.

2 Concerning him, it is to be enquired, of what degrees in Schools he is? and
of how long standing and studying in Divinity? whether he be a graduate in
Divinity, a Doctor, or at least a Bachelor, and not a young Student or
Preacher?

3 Are his Lectures popular Afternoon Sermons? or be they Catechisticall, and
readings upon some common place of Divinity, or the four parts of the English
authorized Catechism, or some of the 39 Articles of our Confession?

4 Is he there admitted with the consent of the Incumbent, or against his will,
with warrant and authority from the Bishop, under his Episcopal seal? Is the
Minister and Incumbent of that place where he Lectureth, a Preacher or not? and
if a Benefice be offered the Lecturer, do you suppose he would take it?

5 Does he often and at times appointed read Divine Service, and administer the
Communion in his Surplisse and Hood of his degree?

6 Of what length are his Lectures, and how is his Prayer at beginning and end?
is he there in conform unto the Appointment and Order of the Canon? Can. 55.

7 Does he in his popular Lectures ordinarily fall upon points of mystical,
dark, and abstruse Divinity, as Praedestination etc. Does he intermeddle with
matters of State, Government, foreign from his profession, above his
understanding?

8 Does he oppose or traduce openly the Doctrine of his Brethren and
neighboring Ministers; or obliquely, underhand or upon the by gird at them,
the Doctrine, Discipline of the Church, any Parishioner etc. so designing him,
them, or that, that a man may take notice of his meaning?

9 The second sort of Lecturers be those of Combination, when many neighboring
Ministers do voluntarily agree and consent with the Ordinaries approbation, not
otherwise, to preach a Sermon, every man in his course, at some adjoining
market town, upon the market day, for instructing of such who repair together
to sell and buy in their duty to God, and commerce with man: Have you any such
Lecturers?

10 Who be the Combiners? be they beneficed men of the Diocese, and not
strangers or Curates? who are not to be admitted, because if they offend in
their Sermons the Diocesan cannot reach them; they are gone.

11 Does this Lecturer any way abridge, hinder, or cut off Divine Service,
which is completely to be finished before the Lecture begin?

12 Do any resorting thereto, walk aloof, or in the Churchyard, on stay at
some house purposely, and not repair to the Church till Lecture begin? If any
such misdemeanour be, present it; and without amendment the Lecture shall cease.

13 A third sort be running Lecturers: who point upon such a day to meet at
such a Church, most an end in some Country Town or Village; and then after
Sermon, and dinner at some house of their disciples, repeat, censure, and
explain the Sermon, discourse of points proposed at their last meeting, by the
head of that Classis or Assembly, ever to the promoting of their own fancies,
and derogation from the doctrine, and discipline of the Church: after all, they
do again condicere, and appoint to meet next at such a Church, in like sort, to
like purpose. Such I found in Sussex at my coming thither. If you have any
such, or know any such, present them (as far as you can learn) who they be,
where they do meet, whither any of your Parish run after them.

By these we may discern the spirit of this Prelate and his Malignity against
Lecturers and Lectures, which he carefully suppressed in Chichester Diocese,
(where he published the like Articles) and would have done the like in Norwich,
but that his predecessor Bishop Wren, had left no Lectures for him to
suppress.

Doctor Pierce Bishop of Bath and Wells, a great creature of this
Arch-Prelates, to please his Grace the better, by color of these Instructions
(which he rigorously observed) suppressed all Lectures within his Diocese both
in Market Towns and elsewhere, as well combination Lectures, as those
maintained by Ministers, or Lecturers upon stipends or the peoples benevolence,
some of which Lectures had continued 40 or 50 years without interruption, and
were countenanced by some of his Predecessors actual preaching at them in
their turns: which when he had effected, he publicly gloryed in this wicked
act, using this most execrable speech: I thank God I have not one Lecture lest
in my Diocese: professing before, that he hated the very name of Lectures, and
would not leave so much as one Lecture in his Diocese; and requiring the
Ministers upon their canonical obedience not to preach any Lecture; alleging,
that there was no such need of preaching no was there was in the Apostles
days. Yea, he suspended Mr Devenish the Minister of Bridgewater for preaching
a Lecture there in his own Church on the Market day (which Lecture had
continued from Queen Elizabeth time till then) and refused to absolve him, till
he has faithfully promised to preach it no more. And when Note.
he absolved him on this promise, he most profanely used to him these words of
our Savior spoken to the Woman taken in Adultery, John 8. 14. Go thy way sin
no more (that is, preach this Lecture no more, as if preaching was as heinous a
sin as Adultery) lest a worse thing happen to thee: Furthermore in pursuit of
these Instructions, he put down all Sermons on the Lords days in the Afternoon
throughout his Diocese, strictly charging the Ministers in his Visitations,
not to preach on Lords days in the Afternoon upon any occasion, under pain of
Suspension; After which he suspended one Mr Cornish, only for preaching a
Funeral Sermon on a Lordsday Evening: Furthermore, he convented the Minister
of Beercoockham before him, for having two Sermons on that parish Revellday;
alleging, that it was a hinderance to the Revel, and utterance of the
Church-all provided to be spent 'on that day: (belike he had more care of the
Church wardens Ale then the peoples Souls) and he questioned one Mr Thomas
Erford a Minister, as a Delinquent, for preaching at the parish of Mountague on
their Revellday, upon the Prophet Joels exhortation to Fasting Note.
weeping and mourning; charging him; that not only his Sermon, but his every
text too, was scandalous to the Revel, and gave offense to the meeting: And
whereas diverse godly Ministers of his Diocese being restrained from preaching,
did take great pain thereupon to catechize their Parishioners in the
principles of Religion on Lordsdayes in the Afternoon, according to the Letter
of these Instructions, enlarging themselves upon the Questions and Answers in
the Catechism in the Common-Prayer-Booke for the peoples better Instruction,
and using a short prayer before and after that exercise, this Bishop being
informed of it corrected and sharply reproved these Ministers for their pains,
threatening to punish them severely if they Persisted therein; saying, Thus it
was a Catechizing Sermon-wise, and AS BAD AS PREACHING: Charging Note.
them, that they should ask no other Questions, nor receive any other Answers
from the people, but such as were contained in the Book of Common prayer; which
one Mr B^^rett Rector of Barwick not observing, was enjoined penance for it;
and one Humfrey Blake Churchwarden of Bridgewater, was likewise put to penance
for not presenting Mr Devenish the Minister there as a Delinquent, for
expounding the Church-Cateckisme, and making a short prayer of his own before
he began his exercise: All which particulars were proved by substantial
witnesses before a Committee of the House of Commons, drawn up into an
Impeachment against this Bishop; and being in verity the Impious fruits of
this Arch-Prelates project (who encouraged him herein) must be justly and
principally charged upon his score: Quia plus peccat Author quam Actor.

The like Suppressions of Sermons and Catechizing on the Lords day in the
Afternoon were common in all or most other Diocese; neither could any
Combination Lectures be obtained in them; but with very great suite, and upon
very hard conditions, which the Bishops took advantage to prescribe by color
of these Instructions, all strictly observed till this present Parliament; This
we could prove by many Instances we shall produce but one instead of all the
rest found among Sir John Lambs Papers (the Archbishops grand Instrument
herein) by Mr Prynns, endorsed with Sir John's own fifth.

Orders given by the Right Reverend Father in God, JOHN Lord Bishop of
PFTERBOROVGH, for and concerning the Sermon weekly on Wednesday in Saint JAMES
Chapel in BRACKLEY, September the 14. 1639.
1. IT is ordered that the fifteen Divines whose names are here under written,
shall be appointed to their several days by Dr H^ath Chancellor of the said
Dioces, or his permission, by Doctor Sybthorpe one of his Surrogates, in a
Catalogue, to be signed by him, annexed to these orders.

II. That no other Divine shall be admitted to Preach there upon any Wednesday,
but one of these fifteen (except the Curate of that place) upon any pretense
whatsoever; And if one of these shall dye, or depart, or refuse to preach, none
other shall be Substituted, but by express allowance of the Bishop.

III. That the Bell shall begin to toll a quarter of an hour before nine of
the Clock in the morning, and shall continue so toleing, till nine of the
Clock and no longer.

IIII. That immediately upon ceasing of the Bell the Divine Service of the
Church of England for morning prayer shall begin, and shall be said, together
with the Letanie, either by the Preacher for that day, or else (in case of
necessity) only by the Minister of the place of his assistant, in his Surplice
and Hood, according to his degree in Schools.

V. The Preacher for that day, shall be ready at the Communion Table in his
Surplice and Hood (while a Psalm is in singing after the Morning prayer and
the Letanie) to begin the Communion Service (commonly called the second
Service) and that there be no Hiatus or stopp at all, after the end of the
Psalms. If he be not there, He who did read the Morning prayer that day,
shall presently go thither, and proceed to the second Service, and no Sermon
shall be had that day. Note.


VI. The Preacher as soon as he has repeated the Nicen Creed shall go up
into the Pulpet, in his Surplice and hood.

VII. No other form of prayer before the Sermon shall be used, then is set
Note.
down in the LV. Canon, to move the people to pray in the words and manner
there perscribed, interposing only, if he so desire, the names of the
Universities and of his College, or of his Patron, he being one quallified by
Law, to have a Chaplain.

VIII. The Sermon at the utmost shall be within the compass of an hour, and
Note.
shall be ended with Glory be to God etc. without any other prayers in the
Pulpit.

VIIII. The Preacher shall after is Sermon come presently from the Pulpit, and

The peace of God, etc.

X. A Surplice and Hood are to be provided for the Preacher at the charge of
the Town.

XI. The people to be admonished by the Preacher (as need shall require) to be
diligent and of reverend behavior at the divine service, both before the
Sermon and also after it. All men to be uncovered during all the time both of
Service and Sermon; all persons to do Reverence at the blessed name of Jesus,
to Note.
stand at the Creedes, Hymns and Gospells; to kneel at the confession and
prayers, and practice all other parts of conformity to the Church Government,
or otherwise it shall be sufficient cause to have the combination for the said
weekly Sermon forthwith inhibited, if the Divine Service be neglected or
deserted, Or if these Orders above mentioned be not truly observed. Upon
condition whereof the Bishop has condescended unto the humble Petition
presented unto his Lordship from the Major and the other Inhabitants of the
said Town of Brackley, for suffering the said weekly Sermon.

These Orders under my Hand and Seal are to be set up for all those whom they
concern, to take notise of the same, in some convenient place within the
Chapel of S. James Brackley, or in the Chancell or Vestery of the same

whereof we have caused our Seal Episcopal to be hereunto put, the day and
year above written.

1. Doctor Sybthorpe Vicar of Brackley. 2. Mr. Burden Rector of Aynoe. 3. Mr.
Yates Rector of Midleton cheny. 4. Mr. Loss Vicar of Leas weeden. 5. Mr.
Osborne Rector of Thenford. 6. Mr. Selby Rector of Chipingwarden. 7. Mr. Gage

Farthingoe. 12. Mr. Brocke Vicar of Maideford. 13. Mr. Hunt Vicar of Sulgraue.
14. Mr. Mander Vicar of Chacombe. 15. Mr. Hifeild Vicar of Evenley.
Jo. Petriburg.

By these unreasonable conditions, (to which the consciences of most orthodox
godly Ministers could no ways submit) most Combination Lecturers were totally
discontinued, and such as remained were for the most part supplied only by
Prelaticall, Superstitious, Ceremonious, Popish Clergy men of the Archbishops
faction, whose Sermons and Examples did more corrupt then instruct, seduce then
reform the Auditors, and only promote his Popish designs. To such slavery,
misery were both Ministers and People reduced by color of this Prelates
forementioned Considerations: Who being afterward advanced to the
Archbishopricke of Canterbury, had an annual Account returned to him from all
the Bishops of his Province, how these Instructions concerning Sermons,
Lectures and Lecturers, were observed, and what Proceedings were upon them; as
was manifested by the Originals of their Accounts found in his study, endorsed
with his own hand. And not content with his Provincial Bishops proceedings,
himself in his Metropoliticall Visiitation, gave special Order to Sir
Nathaniel Brent his Vicar general, to inquire, how his Majesty's Instructions
were observed? as appears by a Memorandum touching his Visitation in general
March. 6. 1634. written with Mr Dells own hand, found in the Archbishops study
with other Papers of that nature: and likewise ordered him to silence diverse
Ministers, and not suffer them to Lecture: We shall give you one memorable
instance in Mr Leighe a reverend Minister then of Wolverhampton, but now
settled in Shoreditch by order of Parliament; For whose silencing this
Archbishop gave special order; as appears by a Letter under his Secretary
Dells own hand (who acknowledged it at the Lords Bar) directed to Sir
Nathaniel Brent, found by M. Prynne among Sir John Lambs Papers.

Worthy SIR,
THE Church and College of Wolverhampton in the Diocese of Litchfield, is an
Appendix to the Deane of Windsor; who by Charter of Edward the fourth is both
Patron and Ordinary, cum omnimoda jurisdictione. And in that regard, though
they have not been visited by any time out of mind, yet now he is content to
lay by the Bulls and Charters of Exemption, and to admit of my Lords
Metropolitan visitation. But with all he has made this humble suit to my Lords
Grace, that if you visit that Church and College, they may not be summoned out
of their own Jurisdiction, but rather that in your way from Litchfield to
Shrewsbury, your visitation may be held in that very Place, it being a goodly
Collegiate Church, and every way sit for it I am informed that Wolverhampton is
but 12. miles from Litchfield, and not out of the way to Shrewsbury. Might you
not be there on Monday May 18.?
. In which my Lord wills you by all means to give Mr Dean content in what may
conveniently be done. And whereas his Grace is informed that the Place is much
given to Faction, and that the last Summer there were some very good Chapter
Acts, and other Orders made by my Lord the Bishop of Hereford, then Dean, to
settle things there in a Church way, and to curb the insolency of some men,
who since, upon occasion of this my Lords Visitation are bold to give it out,
that they will have all reversed etc. His Grace has commanded me to signify
his express pleasure to you, That no former Act made by the Chapter there, nor
any Order appointed by the Deane, be reversed, or any ways altered, without
first acquainting his Grace therewith. And that you take special notice of one
Mr Lee, a Prebend there who has been the Author of much disorder thereabouts,
And if you can fasten upon any thing, whereby he may justly be censured, pray
see it be done, and home, or bring him to the High Commission Court to answer
it there, etc. But HOWEVER let him not obtain any License to Preach any Lecture
there, or in another Exempt place hard by at Tetenshall, whither those of
Wolverhampton do now run after him, out of their Parish; Note.
for the Church has not much need of such men. If you speak with Mr Latham of
Litchfield who is the Surrogate there, he will inform you more fully
concerning this Business. That he (the said Mr Lee) has Churched Refractory
Women in private etc. That he is averse to all good Orders of the Church. As
also that in another place thereabouts they caused a Bell-man in open Market to
make Proclamation for a Sermon, etc.

One thing more, which I may not forget. My Lords Grace is informed that at
Monkes-Illith in Suffolk, there is a Monument placed just at the East end of
the Church, where the Communion Table or Altar should stand; And therefore his
Grace wills you, notwithstanding you are now past it, to take order that it be
either Note.
removed or demolished. And that you be very careful to do the like in all
Churches else, where you find the same Abuse. So not doubting of your care in
these Particulars, and wishing you health and content throughout your Journey,
I take my leave, and am,

Your Faithful poor Friend to serve you, William Dell.
Lambeth, April 27. 1635. Mr Dean cannot be at Wolverhampton by reason of his
attendance at Windsor, the Instalment being about that time, and therefore
prays you to hold him accused.




Upon this Letter, Mr Leigh was suspended by Sir Nathaniel Brent, as appears by
an Abstract of the Metropoliticall Visitation delivered by Sir Nathaniel to the
Archbishop, who thus endorsed it with his own hand. July 16. 1635. The Abstract
of my Visitation of Norwich, Peterborrough, Litchfield, etc. produced at the
Bar; in which we find mention of above twenty other Ministers suspended from
preaching in this his Visitation. In his Instructions for his Metropoliticall
Visitation in the Diocese of London (endorsed and signed with his own hand)
we find diverse Informations against sundry Ministers enclosed, among which
this is one.

Mr. Mr Randall.
Randall Curate of Tuddington in Midlesex near Hampton Court, preaches long
Sermons and factious on Sundays in the Afternoon, though he has been
admonished of it, and inhibited by Mr Chancellor of London; to which the
Archbishop underwrites this direction to Sir Nathaniel Brent his Visitor: Sir,
I require you that (besides your other Instructions) you give me an Account of
all particulars within named.

W. Cant.


Of which particular concerning Mr Randall, Sir Nathaniel after his Visitation
gave this account to the Archbishop.

MAster Randall Curate of Tuddington (noted in the paper) confesses, that
since he was inhibited by Mr Chancellor of London to preach in the Afternoones
on Sundays, he has once offended and no more. It was to make a farewell
Sermon to that exercise, as he says: wherein he rather aggravateth his fault
then otherwise. He says, that this Sermon was much beyond the compass of an
hour, and I believe it continued more then two hours. He now sees and
acknowledges his fault, protests he will be most conformable for the future,
and humbly desires to be dismissed with a Canonical Admonition. But I keep
him in fear still.

To this we might add his procurement of Dr Ienningson Lecturer at Newcastle,
to be questioned in the High Commission at York, in the year 1639. whose
Articles and Answers were both sent up to Lambeth to his Grace-ship; and
enforcing to quit that place, with the Kingdom too, to avoid his fury: His
prosecution of Mr John Iemmet Lecturer at Barwicke, in causing the Bishop of
Durham in December 1639. to send for him by a Pursevant, silence him from
preaching in Barwick, and banish him the Town, without any Articles or
Witnesses examined against him: with other instances of this nature; but for
brevity sake we shall omit these, and proceed to his next stratagem to
suppress preaching, which was:

His publishing of a Declaration for Sports in his Majesty's name, and
silencing, suspending, 2.
excommunicating, questioning, censuring in the High Commission and elsewhere,
many hundreds of godly conscientious Preaching Ministers (whom the Instructions
for Lecturers could not reach so far as to silence, being Incumbents and not
mere Lecturers) for refusing personally to publish it in their Churches, to
animate their people to profane the Lords day, with unhallowed Pastimes: which
because we have Page 128. to 154.
formerly insisted on, and proved to be his design; we shall here but mention,
and pass by, only with this one Addition; that Mr Thomas Valentine, Minister
of Chalford Saint Giles in the County of Buckingham, being suspended by Sir
John Lamb, Deane of the Arches, for not reading the Book of Sports, from which
suspention he appealed and procured time to consider, whether he would read it
or not; Mr Valentine not long after to obtain further time and favor writ a
Letter to Sir John Lamb dated April 28. 1636. with 5 l. enclosed, and a
Petition to the Archbishop, on which Letter Sir John makes this endorsment with
his own hand, Master Valentine 28. April 1636. with 5 l. PIECES enclosed: which
Petition Sir John recommending to Mr Dell, procured him a gracious answer and
some longer respite for the present; but in December and January following he
was again molested and suspended for not publishing this Declaration in proper
person, though his Curate had formerly read it in the Church, as appears by two
Petitions to the Archbishop for his absolution.

His third design to suppress preaching was, by discouraging conscientious
young Scholars and Divines from entering into the Ministry by putting diverse
clogs and difficulties 3.
upon them, under a most specious pretext; which was thus effected: No sooner
was this Prelate settled in his Archbishopric, but he contrived a Letter, drawn
by Mr Dell his Secretary, but interlined, corrected with his own hand, (as
appears by the Original draught found in his study) directed as from his
Majesty to himself; which he afterward presented to the King, who directed
and sent it to him under his Privy Signet to be put in Execution, in manner
following, as the very Letter it self under the Kings Signet declares; thus
endorsed with the Archbishops own hand; Rec. Sept. 19. 1633. From his Majesty,
that no Ministers be made sine Titulo.

To the most Reverend Father in God our Right trusty and Right entirely beloved
Councellor, William Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate and Metropolitan of
all England.
CHARLES R.

MOst Reverend Father in God, Right trusty and right entirely beloved
Counselor, we greet you well. There is nothing more deer to US then the
preservation of true Religion, as it is now settled and established in this our
Kingdom, to the honor of God and the great comfort of our self, and our
Loyal people; and there can nothing more conduce to the advancement thereof
then the strict observation of such Canons of the Church as concern those that
are to take orders in their several times. More especially of keeping that
particular Canon which injoyns, That no man be made a Priest or a Minister
without a Title: For we find that many not so qualified, do by favor or other
means procure themselves to be ordained, and afterward for want of means,
wander up and down to the scandal of their calling, or to get maintenance
fall upon such courses as are most unfit for them, both by humouring their
Auditors and other ways altogether unsufferable. We have therefore thought
fit and We do hereby straightly require and charge you to call such Bishops
to you as are now present in or near our City of London and to acqulint them
with this our resolution. And further that you fail not in the beginning of
the next Term to give notice of this our will and pleasure openly in our High
Commission Court, and that you call into our said Court every Bishop
respectively that shall presume to give Orders to any man that has not a
Title, and there to censure him as the Canon aforesaid does enjoin (which is to
maintain the party so ordered till he give him a Title) and with what other
censure you in Justice shall think sit. And our further will is, That nothing
shall be reputed a Title to enable a man for orders, but that which is so by
the ancient course of the Church, and the Canon Note.
Law, so far forth as that Law is received in this our Church of England. And
as you must not fail in these our directions, nor in any part of them, so we
expect that you gives us from time to time a strict account of your proceedings
in the same.

Given under our Signet at our Palace of Westminster, Note.
the nineteenth day of September in the ninth year of our Reign. Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury.

Upon receipt hereof; this Archbishop (whose project it was) directs this Letter
following to the Bishops of his Province, as is evident by the original
draught thereof corrected with his own hand and thus endorsed by him. October.
18. 1633. The Copy of my Letters upon this of his Majesty's to the several
Bishops of this Province.

S. in Christo.
My very good Lord,
HIS Majesty has been often and much troubled upon complaints which have been
made unto him by the Lords and other men of quality, concerning the multitude
or both unlearned and unworthy Ministers, which pester the Church, and are
always the Causes of great scandal, and too often of Schism and Divisions
therein. And some of them are forced, to the shame of themselves and their
Calling, for want of means to beg for their Living, and yet are daily made in
great numbers, and that directly against the Canon of the Church, which
require's, That no man should be made a Minister sine Titulo. For remedy of
this great abuse and wrong to the Church, his Majesty has directed his
Letters to me, and by them required me to call all such Bishops to me,, as were
then in or about the City, and after consultation with them, to send my Letters
to every several Bishop within the Province, to require obedience to the Canon
of the Church, and his Majesty's directions according to it. The Tenor of his
Majesty's Letter follows, (as before).

ACcording to these Letters I am to pray and require you, that at all times of
Ordination you be very careful to admit none into Holy Orders, but such men as
for life and learning are fit, and which have a Title for their Maintenance,
according to the Laws and ancient practice of the Church. And his Majesty has
farther commanded me to advertise your Lordship, that He will not fail to call
for Note.
an Account of these his Letters both of me and you. Thus not doubting but you
will have a special care both of the good of the Church and his Majesty's
contentment herein: I leave you to the Grace of God and rest.

Your Lordships very loving Friend and Brother. W. Cant.


In this Letter we find this Paper enclosed, writ with Mr Dells, but endorsed
with the Archbishops hand, declaring what shall be a Title.

So upon the matter these Titles are named in the Canon. He that is ordained
must have.

1. A Presentation to some Ecclesiastical Preferment. 2. Or, A Certificate
undoubted that he is provided of some Church void there. 3. Or, A Grant of
some Petty Canons place, or the like, in a Cathedral or Collegiate Church. 4.
Or, A Fellow, or in the right of a Fellow in some College in Oxford or
Cambridge. 5. Or, A Conduct or Chaplain in some College in Oxford or
Cambridge. 6. Or, A Master of Arts of 5. years standing living at his own
charge in either of the Universities. 7. Or, The intention of the Bishop that
ordaines, shortly to admit him to some Benefice or Curates place then void.
And I think the Canon intends that after a Man is once admitted a Curate, the
Parson or Vicar of the place should not have power to put them off at pleasure,
but only for such criminal unworthiness as might deprive him of his Benefice
if he had one.

So I conceive, under favor, the Order may go briefly thus.

And farther his Majesty's express Command is, that this Canon be strictly
observed by all Bishops in their several Diocesses respectively, and that none
presume to ordeine any man to be a Deacon, Priest or Minister under the penalty
enjoined in the Canon, or any other which his Majesty's just displeasure may
inflict upon him.

These Letters prima facie seem very fair, necessary; but latet Anguis in
herba: there was a dangerous design couched under them.

For first, no Lecture whatsoever, was admitted to be a Canonical Title: and
so all ordination of Ministers to supply Lectures was totally secluded: which
was one chief end of this design. Secondly, no Chaplainship to any Noblemans
or Gentleman's family was allowed to be a sufficient Title; and this gave a
fatal blow to all such young Chaplains ordinations; unless they had some
better Title and Livelihood for the future; which was likewise formerly aimed
at in the precedent Considerations and Instructions. And by this device many
young Divines were in a manner quite excluded out of such Religious Gentlemen's
Families, which might season them with the practical power of godliness, or
any principles which the Prelates held to be Puritanisme or Preciseness.
Thirdly, by this device all young Students in Divinity were made more dependent
on, more obsequious to the Bishops, and less dependent on the Nobility, Gentry,
people; as the Letters insinuate. Fourthly, under pretent of these Letters a
kind of new subscription was imposed on all such who were to be ordained
(especially if suspected to be orthodox or precise) to sundry Arminian, Popish
Errors, and Superstitions, upon which they were interrogated to sound their
inclinations, and denied Orders in case of disa^^ent: As namely: Whether Bowing
at the name of Jesus, and to or toward the Altar at their approaches to it, or
ingresse to or egresse out of the Church, were lawful, and commendable?
Whether all baptized Infants were not truly regenerated? Whether Episcopacy and
the Hierarchy of Bishops were not of divine Right? Whether the Church of Rome
were not a true Church? Whether Altars, Copes, Organs, Tapers, Crucifixes and
Images were not lawful? Whether truly regenerate men might not totally and
finally fall from Grace? and the like, By which Interrogations, and many new
Ceremonies introduced at ordinations, sundry godly Scholars and Students of
Divinity were deterred from taking Orders, and a Superstitious, Popish,
profane, Episcopal generation of New ordained Priests (zealous to promote,
embrace the very groslest Doctrines and Superstitions of Rome,) engeadred and
scattered among us in most places; all powerful soul-saving preaching banished
or quite laid aside; and the people every where poisoned with Popish and
Arminian drugs.

By these and such like practices, as likewise by preaching and printing
against frequent Preaching; ( Page 225, 226, 227.
formerly touched) there ensued a great famine of the pure powerful preaching
of Gods Word, of godly Preachers in our Kingdom; and a monstrous increase of
Popish Priests, Jesuits, Friars, Papists, Popery, Superstition, Profaneness,
Ignorance, Impiety; which have involved us in those miseries and distractions
under which we now languish and are almost ruined.

His Fourth Device to suppress preaching, was the subversion of the Feoffees
for buying in Impropriations, particularly charged against him in the 6.
Additionall 4.
Article; in these words.

That whereas diverse gifts and dispositions of diverse sums of money were
heretofore made by diverse charitable and well-disposed persons for the buying
in of diverse Impropriations for the maintenance of preaching the word of God in
several Churches, the said Archbishop about eight years last past, wilfully
and maliciously caused the said gifts feofments and contrivances made to the
uses aforesaid to be overthrown in his Majesty's Court of Exchequer contrary to
law, as things dangerous to the Church and State, under the specious pretense
of buying in Impropriations; whereby that pious work was suppressed and
trodden down, to the great dishonor of God and scandal of Religion.

This Article informs us briefly what these Feoffees were, we shall only add
who they were, what they did, and how they were proceeded against by this
Archbishop. About the year 1626. some godly Persons in and about London to
promote the preaching of the Gospel, and set up a Preaching Ministry to
instruct the people in diverse great Towns and Parishes impropriate where they
wanted means to maintain Preaching, of which they had long been destitute in
former times, resolved to lay their purses together and choose out of themselves
four Divines, four Common Lawyers, and four Citizens of note who should be
Feoffees in trust to purchase in these Impropriations, and with the profits of
them to set up and maintain a constant preaching Ministry in places of
greatest need and eminency: whereupon they made choice of Dr W. Gouge, Dr R.
Sibbs, C. Offspring, and I. Davenport Divines. Ralph Air, S. Brown of Lincolas
Inn, C. Sherland of Greyes Inn, J. White of middle Temple Esquires, Common
Lawyers. John Geering, Richard Davis, George Harwood and Francis Bridges,
Citizens; to be Feoffees for this purpose; who with their own monyes and the
contributions of other well-affected persons in 2 or 3 years space purchased in
the Impropriations of Hartford, Dunstable, Cirencester, with others, and set up
able preaching conformable Ministers (authorized by the Bishops of the
Diocese) there in many other places where they had never any before; as
likewise at Bridgenorth Clarely; and had they not been interrupted in this good
work, would in very few years in all probability, have purchased in most of the
great Towns and noted Parishes Impropriations of England in Laymens hands,
where Preaching was most wanting, and means to maintain it. No sooner had this
Malignant Prelate notice of this pious religious work, but out of his enmity to
Preaching, and the good of ignorant peoples souls (whom he would rather have
still keept in blindness and the chains of Satan, then instructed with the
Gospels light, and brought under the Scepter of Jesus Christ) he presently
projects not only the obstruction, but utter subvertion of this pious design,
which none but a Devil incarnate, or Enemy of all goodness could dislike;
many even of the worser sort of Bishops, yea Courtiers, applauding it, as a
very necessary and godly work.

That he himself projected the overthrow of these Feoffees, was proved out of
his own Diary; where thus he writes in the close of it. Things which I have
projected to do, if Godblesse me in them: the third whereof is this: To
overthrow the Feofment dangerous both to Church and State, going under the
specious pretense of buying in Impropriations. Over against which he writes in
the Margin, DONE: which fights point-blanke with his very next project of a
quite contrary nature, justifying these Feoffees acts, namely: To procure King
CHARLES to give all the Impropriations yet remaining in the Crown within the
Realm of Ireland, to that poor Church: Against which he writes in the Margin;
Done and settled there: though to the impairing of that Crowns revenues, and
that by power of the Council Table, in an arbitrary, forcible and illegal
way, to the undoing of many; as appears by sundry Original Letters thence;
whereas the Feoffees buying in Impropriations did no ways lessen the Kings
revenues, and was done in a just and legal way. To overthrow this pious work,
he caused Mr Noy the Kings Attorney General, by the Kings command, to exhibit
a Bill against these Feoffees in the Eschequer Chamber, to confiscate their
purchased Impropriations to the King by a Decree of that Court, and so dissolve
all they had done: which Bill was prosecuted with all violence. To set on the
prosecution with more edge he suborned his flattering creatures to declaime
against these Feoffees and their design in the Pulpit both at Court and
elsewhere. Among others, his great Minion Peter Heylin, preaching at Saint
Maryes in Oxford before the whole University, at the public Act there, on
Sunday in the afternoon the 11th of July 1630. discharged his venom against
Lecturers, and these Feoffees in these bitter Invectives; p. 38 39: Planting of
Pensionary Lectures in so many places where it needs not, and upon days of
common labor, will at the last bringing forth of fruits, appear to be a tare
indeed, though now no wheat be counted fairer, etc. We will proceed a little
further in the proposal of some things to be considered. The Corporation of
Feoffees for buying in Impropriations to the Church, Does it not seem Note.
in the appearance to be an excellent piece of Wheat? A noble and gracious
point of Piety? Is not this Templum Domini, Templum Domini? But blessed God,
that men should thus draw near unto thee with their mouths, yet be far from
thee in their hearts! For what are those entrusted in the managing of this
great business? Are they not the most of them, the most active and the best
affected men in the whole cause, et magna partis momenta, chief Patrons of the
faction? And what are those whom they prefer? Are they not most of them such as
must be serviceable to their dangerous Innovations? And will they not in time
have more preferments to bestow, and therefore more dependances then all the
Prelates in the Kingdom? etc. Yet all this while we sleep and slumber and fold
our hands in sloth, and see perhaps but dare not note it.

This Sermon he presented to this Bishop in writing bound up in Velome, who
thus endorsed it with his own hand S. Mat. 13, 25. Master Peter Heylin; and
reserved it as a monument in his study; where it was seized by Mr Pryn and Mr
Bendy, who produced and attested it.

Feb. 13. 1632. this cause came to hearing and sentence in the Exchequer
Chamber, where the Feoffees and their good design were utterly overthrown; of
which the Bishop made this special Memento in his Diary in these terms: Feb.
13. 1632. Wednesday, the Feoffees that pretended to buy in Impropriations were
dissolved in the Chequer Chamber. They were the main Instruments for the
Puritan faction, to undo the Church: The Criminal part reserved.

John White of the Middle Temple Esquire (a member of the House of Commons)
deposed at the Lords Bar; that he attending this Archbishop, then of London,
at London House as a Counselor, about a right of Patronage to Chingford in
Essex; after the hearing of the business, the Bishop demanded of him; Whether
he were not one of the Feoffees for buying in Impropriations? to which he
answered, he was: whereupon the Bishop fell upon him with much bitterness of
spirit, calling him, An enemy of the Church, an underminer of Religion: and
vehemently affirmed, that this work of his and his fellow-Feoffees was
mischeivous to the Church and destructive to Religion, and that he would see
him and his fellows shortly called to an Account for it, and stop them from
proceeding in that work. That some few days after, he attended this Bishop
again at Fulham upon the former cause, where he took occasion to discourse with
him at large about the Feoffees proceedings; enforming him, that their only
aim and end in purchasing in Impropriations was, for the better maintenance of
Ministers and Preachers where there was most need; that they bought them with
their own moneys, and the monyes of their friends, and disposed the revenues
thereof to none, nor placed any Minister in any Church, but such as they took
more then ordinary care should be thoroughly examined by the Ordinary of the
place, for his Sufficiency and full Conformity by law required. And therefore
he besought him earnestly, that he would not use his power to hinder and
destroy so good a work, but rather to cherish and further it: And if he
disliked either the Persons who managed it, or the course they took in ordering
the same, they would appoint such other meet persons and rules for the
regulating and carrying on of that pious work as he should think fit. But
notwithstanding this and all other Arguments he could use and earnestly press
him withal, the Bishop with much passion expressly declared his resolution, to
break the neck of this good work, that it should not proceed: Whereupon an
Information was exhibited against the Feoffees by his procurement in the
Eschequer Chamber in the Kings name, by Mr Noy the Kings Attorney General, and
sentence given against them for seizing all the Impropriations they had
purchased and monyes received by them, into the Kings hands; whereby this good
work was destroyed; the profits diverted to other uses (as appears by the
Docquet Book ultimo Decembris 1638. and Sir William Whitmores Petition to the
Archbishop November. 13. 1633. found in his study) and deboyst scandalous
unworthy Ministers, such as had been formerly turned out by other BPS put in to
them; whereas they maintained sundry godly Ministers and six Lecturers at S.
Antholins with the profits of the Impropriations purchased. After which, Mr
White attested there was another Information put by the Kings Attorney into the
Exchequer criminally against these Feoffees, as grand Delinquents, and that by
this Archbishops direction, as was manifested by a Note produced by Mr Prynne
under Secretary Windebanks own hand, to this effect.

IT is his Majesty's pleasure, that the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his
Grace, the Lord Keeper, the Lord Archbishop of Yorks Grace, the Lord Treasurer,
the Lord Privy Seal, the Earl Marshall, the Lord Cottington, Mr Secretary Cook
and my self, calling to us Mr Atturny General shall consider, whether the
Feoffees which have been questioned in the Exchequer for the Feofment of
Impropriations shall be proceeded against Criminally? and if so, then whether
in the Court of Exchequer or in Starchamber?

Dated at Whitehall, 17. of January 1633. Fran. Windebanke.


Mr Thomas Foxly a reverend Divine deposed upon Oath, Viva Voce; That about
Eight years since, William Laud now Archbishop of Canterbury did put down his
Lecture on Fridayes at Saint Martins in the fields, for fear (as he pretended)
least those that came thereunto should infect the Kings, Queens and such Noble
men's houses as were in that Parish, with the Plague, though there then dyed
very few in and about London of that disease, the Plague not being then in that
Parish when his said Lecture was suppressed, though God brought it into the
Parish the very next week after its suppression; by means whereof this
deponent was deprived of his present livelihood. After which he being brought
before the said Bishop for diverse frivilous matters whiles he was Bishop of
London, and cleared of them, because there was no color of Crime against him;
The said Bishop charged him, for intermedling with the business of buying in
Impropriations, and thereby endeavoring (as he expressed by putting his
fingers to his Girdle and shaking of it) to bring the Bishops under the
Feoffees Girdles for Impropriations; and when this deponent answered him, that
this could not be, since the Ministers on which they bestowed the said
Impropriations were sent to the respective Bishops of every Diocese to be
approved by them; he answered, that if he had known this deponent to be so
busy in this matter of redeeming Impropriations he should not have so easily
gotten off before, as he did. And he farther deposed, that about nineteen
Months before this present Parliament he having a Chamber in London and study
in Canewood near Highgate, was rifled by Pursevants and taken and kept Prisoner
for two Days and two Nights space, by virtue of a general warrant, to search
for Popish Books and suspected Persons, and bidden to choose, whether he would
be brought before the now Archbishop, or Sir John Lamb; whereupon he bid the
Pursevant carry him whither he would; who carried him to Sir John Lamb; who
told him, he must put in Bond to appear the next Thursday at the High
Commission; which he did accordingly: on which Thursday morning by means of Dr
Bray, he obtaining speech which the said Archbishop, desired him to grant him
one weeks time to consider, whether he might take the oath Ex officio, or not:
which he hardly granting, the said Archbishop said; He had almost forgotten
him, but by way of threatening said, he remembered him about the business of the
Feoffees: to which the deponent replied; That he was encouraged therein by
Bishops Note.
and Privy Counselors, who sometimes conceived it to be a very good work to
redeem Impropriations; and so he was desired to appear the Thursday following.
But the very next Lords day another Pursevant was sent to this deponent, who
bringing him to the Council Chamber door and there attending about half an
Hour, a warrant under the said Archbishops hand and five others, was delivered
to the said Pursevant to carry him to the Gate house; where he was kept close
Prisoner in a Chamber, not four yards square, for the space of twenty months;
not having the allowance of pen and Ink to Petition, that he might know whom
or wherein he had offended; that so he might repent, through God gives leave,
yea calls upon the greatest sinners to Petition to him: and at three Months end
(he growing very sick by reason of his close Imprisonment, and for want of one
to cut his Hair, which he used to wear short for his health) fell very sick:
his wife thereupon Petitioned time after time to have access to him being at
the very point of death, as his keeper informed her, but could neither by her
self, nor any other friends, procure access unto him, until such time as Sir
Matthew Lister was appointed by the Privy Coucell to come unto him, to see in
what ill case he was: upon whose certificate and fifty shillings paid Sir
William Be^cher and his man, so soon as it could be procured from Friends, she
had a warrant to come and bring one Physician and Chirurgian unto him, to let
him blood, and permission to repair unto him during his sickness, but no
longer. In which strict close Imprisonment by the said Archbishops procurement,
he continued till about a Months space after this present Parliament began,
and then upon a Petition of his wives to the House of Commons he was released
without bayl, and his said Imprisonment by them voted Illegal; there being all
this while no proceedings against him, nor any crime objected to him in any
Court of Justice. By means of which Imprisonment he was much prejudiced and
undone in his Estate, and his wife with four small children exposed to Pennury
and Beggary.

Such a spite did He bear this witness for his Activity in the business of
Impropriations.

Mr William Kendall, Mr John Lane, and Mr Tempest Miller, severally deposed at
the Lords Bar, that the Archbishop in the presence of them and diverse others,
speaking of the Feoffees of Impropriations, said; that they were the bane of
the Church; and then uttered these words in a vaunting manner, I was the man
that did set my self against them and (then clapping his hand upon his breast,
said) I thank God I have destroyed Note.
this work.

So as he did not only subvert this pious project to propagate the preaching of
the Gospel, but boasted of it, and had so much shameless Impiety, as to
thank God himself for effecting it, who has now in justice brought him into
judgment for it, and made it one part of that Charge and Evidence, which we
conceive will most justly destroy him.

The seventh and next stratagem he used to subvert the Protestant Religion,
which he had almost totally suppressed, corrupted with Popish Errors,
Superstitions, Innovations in our English Churches, was his endeavors to
undermine and suppress it in these few Duth and French Churches planted here
among us; who enjoyed their own Government, Privileges, Discipline without
any interruption by any of his Predecessors, or other English Prelates, in all
our Protestant Princes reigns, from King Edward the sixth his reign, till
this Archprelates molestation of, and attempts against them, thus laid down in
the twelfth Original Article of his Impeachment.

He has Traitorously endeavored to cause division and discord between the
Church of England, and other Reformed Churches; and to that end has suppressed
and abrogated the Privileges and Immunities which have been by his Majesty and
his Royal Ancestors granted to the Dutch and French Churches in this Kingdom.
And diverse other ways has expressed his malice and disaffection to these
Churches, that so by such disunion, the Papists might have more advantage for
the overthrow and extirpation of both.

To make good this Article we could produce many Letters, Papers, Instructions,
Orders under the Archbishops own hand, or indorsed by him, found in his own
study, here ready at the Bar; but for brevity sake we shall instance only in
some few particulars of more special note.

The first is, that this Arch-prelate though he bears so good an affection and
honorable respect to the Church of Rome, as to justify her to be, a true
visible Apostolic Church, which never erred in fundamentals, and wherein men
may be saved; and that we and she are one and the same Church still, no doubt
of that, both one; as we have Page 235. 240, 241.
formerly proved: Yet he is so maliciously despitefull to the Protestant
Churches in foreign parts, and at home, that he reputes them not only no true
Churches, but even no Churches at all, because they have no Lord-bishops,
different in Order and Degree from ordinary Ministers. This opinion of his we
shall manifest, not only by his Divinity Questions when he was to proceed
Bachelor and Doctor of Divinity (for which Dr Holland publicly checked, and
turned him out of the Schools with disgrace, as a sower of discord between
Brethren, to wit the Church of England and other reformed Churches;) but by his
own late reprinted Book An 1639. entitled, A Relation of the Conference
between William Laud, then Lord Bishop of St. David's, now Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, and Mr Fisher the Jesuit etc. p. 175, 176. where thus he writes
(in justification of his former Theses in the Divinity Schools:) For the
calling and Authority of Bishops over the inferior Clergy, that was a thing of
known use and benefit, for preservation of Truth and Peace in the Church. And
so much St Ierom tells us, though being none himself, he was no great friend to
Bishops: And this was so settled in the minds of men from the very infancy of
the Christian Church, as that it had not been till that time contradicted by
any. So that then there was no controversy about the calling, all agreed upon
it. Then citing Jeroms words in the margin, he thus comments upon them. So,
even according to St. Ierom, Bishops had a very ancient and honorable descent
in the Church from St. Mark the Evangelist: And about the end of the same
Epistle he acknowledges it, Traditionem esse Apostolicam: Nay more then so, he
affirms plainly, That ubi non est Sacerdos, NON EST ECCLESIA (St. Ierom
advers. Luciferianos:) And in that place most manifest it is, that St. Ierom by
Sacerdos means a Bishop; for he speaks de Sacerdote qui potestatem habet
Ordinandi: which in St. Ieroms own judgment, no mere Priest had, but a
Bishop only, St. Ierom Epist. ad Evagrium: so even with him, NO BISHOP NO
CHURCH. Which being his own positive judgment, the Dutch and French Protestant
Churches both at home and abroad, must needs be no Church at all in his
opinion, because they have no such Bishops; and so are in far worse condition
then the Church of Rome, in his repute.

To make this more apparent, we shall desire you to take notice, that in
December. 1639. there was a plot between this Archbishop and others of our
Prelates to obtrude upon all our Ministers this subscription, as the received
Doctrine of the Church of England; to wit, that there could be no Church of
Christ without Diocesan Lord Bishops; which clearly appears by the Here p.
237, 238.
forementioned propositions of Bishop Hall, which the Archbishop thought fit
for the subscription of others: but especially by the 1. 12. and 13.
propositions viz. God had never any Church on earth that was ruled by a Parity:
There was NO CHVRCH OF CHRIST UPON EARTH ever since the times of the Apostles
governed any otherwise then by Bishops. This course of government thus set by
the Apostles in their life time, by the special direction of the holy Spirit,
is unalterable by any humane Authority, but OUGHT to be perpetuated in the
Church to the end of the world. From whence it inevitably follows, that the
reformed foreign Churches having no such imparity of Governors nor Lordly
Bishops in them, are in this Arch-Prelates and his Confederates judgments, No
Churches of God or Christ at all; and if the design of subscribing these
Propositions had succeeded (as it did in the Etcetera Oath for a time) he would
have engaged the whole Church of England, with all our Ministers by a public
subscription, in this most unchristian and uncharitable opinion; which not
prevailing, was yet soon after thus seconded in print by his grand Favorite
Bishop Mountague (whom he advanced to two Bishoprics) in his Originum
Ecclesiasticarum Tomi prioris Pars posterior p. 464, published with his
approbation, authorized by his Chaplain Dr Bray, presented to, and accepted by
himself when published, as appears by two fair gilded printed copies thereof
with his Archiepiscopall Arms engraven on the Covers, found in his study by Mr
Pryune (printed An. 1640.) since these Propositions of Bishop Hall were sent
him; resolving, that there can be not only no Church, but no Ministers at all
without Bishops to ordain them, in these terms. Non est Sacerdotium nisi in
Ecclesia, non est Ecclesia sine Sacerdotio. Illud autem intelligo per (...)
Episcopalem ordinariam. Neque euim admittenda consneus extraordinariam aliquam
sen vocationem seu (...), nisi miraculosam. Oportet omnino miraculis agant and
suam confirment functionem signo aliquo, qui non ab Episcopis derivata ab
Apostolis per successionem institutione, in Ecclesiam inducuntur, sed velorti a
sese, vel nescio unde intrusi, sese ingeru^t. N^m quod pretendunt ordinariam
vocationem retinendam, adhibendam, eique adherescondum, nisi in casu
necessitatis, absurdum est; and suppositione innititur impossibilitatis: Neque
enim talis casus, ant extitit aliquando, aut contingere potest: nisi fallat not
Dominus, qui promisit, Porta inferorum non pravalebunt: Ecce sum vobiscum ad
consummationem mundi.

By which Position the foreign Protestant Churches are resolved, concluded to
be no Churches, their Ministers no Ministers, their Sacraments no Sacraments,
their Ordinances no Ordinances of Christ; (which perchance made Mr John Dury
ordained in one of those Churches, to be re-ordained a Minister here by the
Bishop of Exeter Dr Hall, before he was admitted to his Benefice, as appears
by their several Dated Exon. 22. Febr. 1634.
Original Letters found in the Archbishops study.) And then what are they but
mere Pagan Conventicles, far worse then Papists and the Church of Rome.

We shall only add to this, that whereas Bishop Hall in his Treatise of
Episcopacy page 18. excused the foreign Protestant Churches from being
unchurched by these Positions only in this regard; that the reason why they
renounced Bishops was merely out of necessity, because their Bishops would not
suffer them to enjoy the Gospel. Adding page 19. That it is very considerable,
whether the condition they were in does absolutely warrant such a proceeding?
which is somewhat too hard a censure of them; yet the Archbishop in his See
here p. 263, 264, 265.
forecited Letter to Bishop Hall, taxes him for this his overmuch lenity
toward them, in these terms: You are a little more favorable to the
foreign Churches and their Authors, then our cause will bear: and yet in the
very same Letter, he mislikes and blames this Bishop for his overmuch
sharpness toward the Pope, in his second Book, for bestowing the Title of
Antichrist upon him; wherewith he was so highly offended, that out of a zeal to
his Holiness, he presently complains to the King himself of this indignity
offered to the Pope, and procures a special Mandate from his Majesty to Bishop
Hall, to qualify his expressions in this particular with his own pen, which
he did accordingly. Notwithstanding the General Harmony of confessions p. 318,

Impressions of all their eminentest Writers; Our own Hom^lies See here p. 276,

Writers of all sorts, and the very Act of Parliament for the Confirmation of
the Subsidies granted by the Clergy 3. Iac. (penned by all the Prelates and
Clergy of England in full Convocation) give the Pope this Title, and style the
Jesuits and their Adberents, THE UNSHAMEFACT BROOD OF ANTICHRIST. This his
indulgence therefore to the Pope, Priests, and Church of Rome, and professed
emnity against the foreign Reformed Churches in unchurching them, in making
their Ministers no Ministers at all, and them no Christians, nor Christian
Assemblies, discovers his very Intrals and inward bent of his soul to Popery,
to the Church of Rome, yea his inveterate hatred to these Protestant Churches
and their Religion too; The next thing we shall fully evidence.

2. Though this Archbishop was so zealous an Advocate for the Church of Rome,
as both in his public Speeches, Writings to maintain, That her Religion is
the same with ours, as we have Page 139. 141. 247, 248, 249.
formerly proved; yet he could by no means endure that the Religion of the
foreign Protestant Churches and Ours should be termed one and the same;
Whereupon he presumed to countermand, alter and purge his Majesty's Letters
Patents under the Great Seal for a Collection for the poor distressed
Ministers of the Palatinate, Ann. 1634. because it termed their Religion, The
true Religion which we together with them profess to maintain. This we shall
make good by two substantial witnesses, and the printed Letters Patents
themselves. The witnesses are Mr Wakerly (then Secretary to Mr Secretary Cook)
and Mr Hartlib, who deposed at the Lords Bar upon Oath; That in the year
1634. the Queen of Bohemia sent over one Mr Ruly a Palatinate Minister into
England, with Letters of recommendation to the Archbishop, to desire his
mediation and assistance to the King, to grant Letters Patents under the great
seal, for a general Collection toward the relief of the exiled Ministers of
the Palatinate and their families, who were then in great distress: which
Letter Mr Ruly presenting to the Archbishop (among whose Papers Mr Prynne found
the very Original) after the reading thereof, the Archbishop promised (out of
respect to the Queen of Bohemia who writ to him with her own hand) to move the
King in it, which he did; and then informed him, that it was the Kings pleasure
there should be Letters Patents drawn for a general collection for those
Ministers as was desired: Whereupon Mr Ruly requested the Archbishop, in regard
he was a stranger and knew not our proceedings, to give him some directions how
to get the Letters Patents drawn and sealed; who answered, that he needed no
instructions herein, for it was a thing of usual course, and willed him to
repair to the Officers of the King (his Secretaries and Attorney general) who
would draw and procure them to be sealed. Whereupon he repaired to Mr Wakerly,
who went with him to the other Officers and procured Letters Patents to be
drawn according to former Presidents, both in King James and King Charles
reigns, and namely verbatim, according to Letters Patents for a like
Collection, dated 29 Ian. 3. Caroli, which being drawn, engrossed, and passed
the Great Seal of England, without any scruple (the Lord Keeper both reading
and approving the same before the sealing) Mr Ruly carried the Patent over to
Lambeth to desire the Archbishops assistance for the printing, dispersing and
promoting thereof; where meeting with Mr Dell, his Secretary, he acquainted him
with his business, and showed him the Patent, who casting his eye thereon,
took some exceptions thereat, because it made our and their Religion to be both
one, saying, Are your Church and Religion and ours one? which done, he carried
the Patent to the Archbishop, Note
who after he had perused it, calling for Mr Ruly, demanded of him in a very
angry manner, What have you brought me here? Mr Ruly replied, His Majesty's
Letters Patents. At which answer he fell into a great passion, rating and
reviling Mr Ruly with very ill language; threatened and called him ill names;
protested that that Patent should not pass though it were under the Great
Seal, and made Mr Dell write something out of it: Mr Ruly shaking for fear,
excused himself, that it was drawn by the Officers to whom his Grace had
directed him, and if there were ought offensive in it, he was altogether
ignorant and not guilty of it. Whereunto the Archbishop replied; that were it
not for his respect and engagements to the Queen of Bohemia, they should have
no collection at all, and that he could find in his heart to quash it; but
however he would suppress that Patent, which he detained by him, and would
have one drawn in another form. Whereupon Mr Ruly leaving him to his angry
mood departed, and acquainted Secretary Cook, the Lord Keeper Coventry, and
other his friends with the Premises, who all wondered and were very inquisitive
what was the cause of all this anger; The Archbishop presently after repaires
to the King, and complains much against this Patent, Secretary Cook, and the
Lord Keeper for passing it; who being both sent for by the King about it,
acquainted his Majesty, that it was made verbatim accorcording to former
Presidents, that they had his Majesty's hand and Royal assent thereto, and it
was now passed the Seal, and so could not be altered. To which the King
answers, that it must be altered, for that the Archbishop would have it so; and
another must be Note
drawn according to his mind. Upon this the Patent was recalled, and a new one
drawn according to the Archbishops direction and prescript; which being
compared with the former by these Deponents and others (who were very
inquisitive what it was did so much enrage his Grace) they found it was only
this ensuing clause, which he caused to be quite purged out, with little or no
alteration else from that he suppressed.

Whose cases are more to be deplored, for that this extremity is fallen upon
them for their sincerity and constancy IN THE TRVE RELIGION, which WE, TOGETHER
Note.
WITH THEM DO PROFESS, and WHICH WE ARE ALL BOUND IN CONSCIENCE TO MAINTAIN
TO THE UTMOST OF OUR POWERS; Whereas these Religious and Godly Persons being
involved amongst others their Contrymen, might have enjoyed their estates
and fortunes, if with other backsliders in the times of Trial they would have
submitted themselves to the ANTICHRISTIAN YOKE, and have renounced or
dissembled the Profession of THE TRVE RELIGION.

In lieu whereof he only inserts, That they suffered FOR THEIR RELIGION; as if
our Religion and theris were contra-distinct and different one from another,
and theirs not the true. Which Secretary Cook when he saw affirmed would make a
Schism, a Division betwixt us and the foreign Protestant Churches, by
intimating that they professed neither our, nor yet the true Religion, (as Mr
Wakerly deposed) and gave great scandal and offense to the Deponents, yea to
the foreign Churches and Protestants here, who took special Notice of it.

In this notable piece of Evidence we shall desire your Lordships and the world
to take notice of these remarkable particulars. First, of this Archbishops
insufferable Insolency, in daring to presume so far as to stop, suppress the
Kings own Letters Parents when approved by his Royal Signature, allowed by the
Lord Keeper, and actually passed under the Great Seal of England. Secondly,
his extraordinary overruling power with the King, who against his own
Judgment, Sign Manual, Seal, and former Presidents, must have this Patent
altered in this clause, only because the Archbishop would have it so, and for
no other reason. Thirdly, that this alteration proceeded merely from the
Archbishops own motion, not from any Priests or Jesuits instigation, much less
from the King (as he Speech in Star Chamber, p. 32. to 39. See here p. 247. 248
pretended the alterations of the Prayer Book for the fifth of November did.)
Fourthly, that he was exceeding passionate and enraged at this clause, insomuch
that this charitable Collection and Patent must totally be quashed, rather then
this clause tolerated; whereas his Chaplains authorized Books in commendation
of Popery, Popish Errors, yea pleading for Rome and her Religion as true, and
one with ours. Fifthly, that this very clause had passed both the Broad Seal and
Press too, without the least exceptions, in a Patent, 29 Ian. 3. Caroli not
full seven years before, even in King Charles his own Reign; and in another
General Collection granted under the Privy Signet the seventeenth of June, in
the sixteenth year of King James, Anno Dom. 1618. for relief of the
Inhabitants of the Town of Wesell; then printed by Authority, together with
Archbishop Abbots directions concerning the same to the several Bishops under
him, dated June 25. 1618. wherein we find these following expressions; That
that City had been a place of succor and relief to many afflicted strangers,
such as have been exiled for THE TRVE RELIGION That they were not able any
longer to sustain the charge neither of the Ministry, nor of the Free-schoole,
which heretofore they have erected for the propagation of THE TRVE RELIGION
etc. which should excite us to enlarge the Bowels of compassions toward them,
which cannot be better expressed of our parts, then by having compassion and a
fellow-feeling of them, MAKING THE SAME PROFESSION OF FAITH THAT WE DO, yet do
suffer such adversity etc. which are the same in terminis with those in this
expunged Patent. What then was the cause that this Clause should be thought so
insufferable, so impassible by this Archprelate now? Certainly there must be
some great mystery of Iniquity in it; he and his Predecessor Abbot had not the
selfsame opinion of the Protestant Churches and their Religion. Abbot deemed
both their Churches and Religion true, and the same with ours; but Laud deemes
them no Churches at all, their Religion not the true Religion, nor the same
with ours at this time, though formerly one and the same with it. And why so?
because himself had altered, perverted, yea almost quite subverted it, both in
Design and Execution, intending to set up Popery as the only old and true
Religion: therefore to suffer such a Patent to pass both the Great Seal and
Press in his Majesty's name, as should proclaim their Religion, to be the true
Religion, which we together with them do profess, and we are all bound in
conscience to maintain to the uttermost of our power; when he and his
Confederates bent all their might to suppress it; and to commend their
sincerity and constancy in the true Religion, when as they might have enjoyed
their estates and fortunes, if with other backsliders, in the times of Trial
they would have submitted themselves to the Antichristian Yoke, and have
renounced or dissembled their profession of the true Religion, in these days
when he with his Confederates endeavored to make men Backsliders, Apostates,
and persuaded them to submit themselves to the Antichristian yoke, and to
renounce or dissemble the profession of the true Religion, would have quite
crossed or frustrated his Design; Therefore out it must, and be obliterated
whatever comes of it. Finally, observe his imbittered malice to the Protestant
Churches, but grand affection to the Pope and Church of Rome, most evidently
displayed by this expunction: the first in deleating those clauses which style
theirs, the true Religion, etc. the latter in expunging this expression in
favor of the Roman Church and Pontife only, if they would have submitted
themselves to THE ANTICHRISTIAN YOKE; which we have elsewhere Page 263.
dilated upon. In brief, He that thus would have the Protestant Churches no
Churches at all of God or Christ, their Ministers no Ministers, their Religion
not the true Religion, nor the same with ours, must certainly express
abundance of malice and disaffection to these Churches, endeavor to cause
discord and division between the Church of England and them; (the very charge
in the Article) and proclaim himself a greater friend to the Church of Rome
and her Religion, then to the Protestant Churches and the true Religion in them
professed: yea a Traiterous endeavourer to subvert the true Religion
established in our English Church, which is the same with theirs. And the
rather may we believe this of the Archbishop, because shortly after he caused a
Book entitled, A Declaration of the Faith and Ceremonies of the Palsgraves
Churches, printed first in Dutch, but afterward in English Anno 1637. to be
strictly called in and seized by his Pursevants (in high affront of the Prince
Palatine, then newly arrived in England, and of his Churches) because it
declared those Churches Orthodox judgment and censure against sundry Arminian
and Popist Errors, Innovations, Ceremonies, which he and his Confederates
then labored to introduce among us; as was attested upon Oath by Michael Spark
senior and Mr Prynne; when as we never heard of any Popish Books (as Sancta
Clara and others here printed) either called in or seized by his special
voluntary command, but countenanced, yea restored by him or his Agents, when
seized by the Searchers and Stationers.

Let all the world then judge by this prime piece of our Evidence, what manner
of Protestant this Archbishop was, and how ill he stood affected to the
Protestant Religion.

3. These premises considered, no wonder if he endeavored by all his policy
and power to suppress, nay abrogate the Privileges, Immunities of the Dutch
and French Churches in this Kingdom, granted to them by his Majesty and his
Royal Ancestors; which he in part accomplished to their prejudice, the next
part of his Charge in the twelfth Article, of which we shall present you this
summary account.

King Edward the sixth by his Letters Patents dated the 24 day of July, in the
fourth year of his Reign granted this ensuing Patent to the Dutch and French
Protestants then living in exile in London, establishing their Church and
Presbyterian Government among themselves, exempt from all Episcopal
Jurisdiction, appointing a Superintendent over them, and Ministers of their
own. Which Patent, for the rarity thereof, and the better understanding of this
Charge, we shall at large transcribe.

By virtue of this Patent, Orders, Grants, the Dutch and French Churches in
London and other Diocese enjoyed the free exercise of their Religion,
Discipline, exempt from all Archiepiscopall and Episcopal Jurisdiction from
Edward the sixths time till Ann. 1634. without any interruption. But no sooner
was this Prelate warm in his Archiepiscopall chair, but he begins to disturb
their peace, and threaten their total subvertion throughout his Province, as
in Canterbury, Sandwich, Maidstone, Norwich, Colchester, London, Southampton,
and likewise in Yorkshire, Axholme, and elsewhere, which he had formerly
projected in this manner.

On March 22. Ann. 1632. this Bishop upon his own motion procured a reference
to himself from the Lords of the Council, concerning the English living in
foreign parts, and the foreign Protestant Churches in England; concerning
which he drew up and presented two several Papers to the Lords found in his
study, under Mr Dells hand, thus endorsed with his own, Concerning the Dutch
and French Churches in England etc. here necessary to be inserted, though not
read at large.

Whereas I was commanded by your Lordships upon Friday, March 22. 1632. First
to represent to His Gracious Majesty the great and Honorable care you had to
preserve the unity and Government of the Church of England as it stands now
established by Law; Which care was very great and pious, and according to my
duty, in the Name of the Church, I humbly thank your Lordships for it: And have
in pursuance of your Commands faithfully acquainted His Majesty with as many
particulars as I could carry away safe in my memory.

Secondly, I was commanded by your Lordships to take into farther consideration
such Heads as might best conduce to the rectifying of such his Majesty's
Subjects as reside at Hamborough, or elsewhere beyond the Seas, but especially
in the Low Countries, either in Merchandise, or in use and exercise of Arms
under the Colonells there. As also what might be thought fit to be done
concerning the French and Dutch Churches, as they now stand, and are used at
this present within this Realm; but at such time as your Lordships in your
wisdom shall best approve.

Concerning the first of these, viz. the English living in Foreign parts, I
humbly recommend to your Lordships Wise. dome, as follows.

1. Whether it be not fit (I had almost said necessary) that the several
Colonels in the Low Countries should entertain no Minister as Preacher to
their Regiments, but such as shall conform in all things to the Church of
England established: And be commended unto them from your Lordships by advise
of the Lords Archbishops of Canterbury or York for the time being.

2. That the Company of Merchants residing there, or in any other Foreign
Parts, shall admit no Minister as Preacher to them, but such as are so
qualified and so commended as aforesaid.

3. That if any Minister having by feigned carriage gotten to be so
recommended, either to any of the several Colonells, or to the Deputy
Governor and Body of the Merchants there, shall after be found unconformable,
and will not mend upon warning given him by the Colonel or Deputy Governor of
the Merchants, shall within three months after such warning given, and refused,
be dismissed from his service, that a more orderly and peaceable man may be
sent unto them.

4. That every Minister or Preacher with any Regiment of soldiers that are his
Majesty's borne Subjects, or with the Company of Merchants there or elsewhere,
shall read Divine Service, Christen children, Administer the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, marry, instruct the younger or more ignorant sort in the
Catechism, visit the sick, bury the Dead, and do all other Duties according
as they are prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer maintained in the Chuch of
England, and not otherwise. And that he which will not conform himself so to
do, shall not continue Preacher either to any Regiment of English, or
Scottish, or to the Merchants.

5. That if any Minister or Preacher, being the Kings Subject, shall with any
bitter words or writings in print or otherwise, defame the Government of the
Church of England established, His Majesty's Ambassador or Agent in those parts
for the time being, is to be informed of it, and upon notice given from him to
the State, he or they so offending shall be commanded over by Privy Seal or
otherwise, to answer their offense or offenses here.

6. That no Colonel of any several Regiment, or Deputy Governor of the
Merchants, shall give way that their Minister or Preacher shall bring any other
Minister to preach for him in time of his sickness, absence, or other
necessary employment, but such as for whose Conformity to the Church and
Government here, he will be answerable.

7. That if any Minister being a Subject of the Kings, in the Low Countries, or
any other place beyond the Seas, shall in any other Auditory, as well as before
the Regiments or the Merchants, preach or publish, or in any other way by
public Speech, Writing, or Printing, divulge any thing derogatory to the
Doctrine or Discipline established in the Church of England, or otherwise
prejudicial to the Temporal State and Government, His Majesty's Agent there
shall use the best means he can to discover him or them so offending, and
having found them, shall presently certify the State here, that so they may be
recalled by Privy Seal to answer it. And if they then refuse to come, that the
Law in that case pass upon them.

8. That no man shall be chosen or sent over by the Merchants here, either to
Delf, or any other place of their residence beyond the Seas, (whenever any
such place or places shall become void) but such a man as is conformable to the
Church of England both in Doctrine and Discipline, and such as will be careful
to see that they which are under his Governments shall observe all such Church
Duties as are expressed and required in any the former Articles. And that some
of the chief Merchant-Adventurers here be sent for to the Board, and be made
acquainted with this Article. And farther, that at every time and times that
they send a new Deputy Governor to any place of their Residence, they present
the said Deputy to the Lords, and give them assurance of his fitness and
sufficiency for that Charge. At which time the said Deputy may have such
Directions given him by their Lordships as the present times and occasions
require. And that there be like care taken for other good Officers there, as
for the Deputy Governor himself.

9. That whenever the Merchant-Adventurers shall become suitors to His
Majesty to renew or confirm their Patent (as in most Kings times it is usual
so to do) that then there be a Clause inserted into their Patent, to bind
them to the observance of all, or so much of these Instructions, as shall be
thought fit by his Majesty and the Lords.

10. That the present Agent, as also all others that shall succeed in that
employment, have these Instructions given them in Charge; and that once a year
they be required to give the Board an Account what the Proceed of the business
is. That so His Majesty's Subjects as well abroad as at home, may be kept in
orderly obedience to the Honor of His Majesty's Government, and the better
uniting of the hearts of his People to God, His Majesty, and one to another. In
which will consist the strength as well as the Honor of the Kingdom.

11. I conceive it no way fit, that the Ministers which are His Majesty's
Subjects in Holland, should have any Classical Meetings allowed them (as it
seems they pretend some grant since the year 1622.) especially that they be
not suffered to assume power of Ordination; for then it will be a perpetual
Seminary to breed and transplant men ill-affected to the Government into this
Kingdom.

It is to be observed that the French and High Germane Congregations in the
Low Countries do all observe the Liturgy of their own Mother Churches; only
the English observe neither their own, nor any other uniformity.

Concerning the second; that is, the French and Dutch Churches, as they now
stand in many parts of this Kingdom, I as humbly represent, first the Danger,
then the probable Remedy.

For the Dangers I humbly submit, but conceive as follows.

1. It was Honor and Piety in this State, when at the first way was given for
those Churches both in London and some other parts of this Kingdom; Because at
that time there was persecution upon them in their own Countries: And the
Peace with which God then blessed this Kingdom, was their safety.

2. I conceive it was never the meaning and purpose of this State then, or at
any other time, that they living and continuing here, marrying, and having
wives and children, and many of them plentiful fortunes and Lands; And their
children and childrens children being now Natives, and his Majesty's borne
Subjects, should live like an absolute divided Body from the Church of England
established, which must needs work upon their affections, and alienate them
from the State, or at least make them ready for any Innovation that may sort
better with their humor.

3. It is likewise considerable what an entire and divided body they keep
themselves. For few or none of them marry with any of us, but only one with
another. Upon which it must needs follow, that as they increase and multiply,
they which are now a Church within a Church, will in time grow to be a kind of
another Commonwealth within this, and so ready for that which I hold not fit
to express any farther.

4. It is likewise of great consequence, that these men living with their
entire Families, divided from the present Government of Church and
Commonwealth are many, and have got their Residence and settlement in all or
most of the Haven Towns, especially such as lie fittest for France and the
Low Countries. And were occasion offered, God knows what advantage they may
take to themselves, or make for others.

5. Their Example is of ill consequence (in Church affairs especially) to the
Subject of England. For many are confirmed in their stubborn ways of
disobedience to the Church Government, seeing them so freely suffered in this
great and populous City.

6. Last of all, I think it very just not to suffer French or Dutch Church
differing from us in Discipline, to be otherwise or longer tolerated in any
part of this Realm, then the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England
shall among the Subjects of this Crown be tolerated in those several parts
beyond the Seas, whither they have cause to resort and abide.

For the Remedies likewise I humbly submit, but conceive they may be these.

1. I think it fit their Number in all places of this Kingdom be made known
as fully as may be; that your Lordships may the better judge both of them, and
the way to reduce them into one Body with this Kingdom in which they are borne
Subjects.

2. I conceive the best way to know their Number, is by a Command from the
State it self, and to have it avowedly taken in all places where they reside;
with a Certificat either presently, or when your Lordships shall think fit,
which are the men of Credit and Wealth among them. And this may be done really
for their good, and so sweetened as that they may apprehend it for a benefit, as
indeed it is.

3. It is fit, if they will continue as a divided Body from both State and
Church, that they be used as Strangers, and not as Natives. That is, that they
may pay all double duties as Strangers use to do, and have no more Immunities
then Strangers have, till they will live and converse as other Subjects do. And
this matter of loss or gain is as likely to work upon them, especially the
Merchants and richer men as any other thing, and perhaps more.

4. When it shall be thought fit actually to reduce them to live as other
Subjects do, both in relation to Church and State, the way I conceive may be
to have them fairly warned in an Ecclesiastical way, for every man with his
Household (if he be not a new commer, but a borne Subject) to repair to his
Parish Church here, to conform himself to Prayers, Sacraments etc. And if any
receive not according to Cannon and Law, then to excommunicate him or them. And
by that Note
time the Writ de Excommunicato capiendo has been served upon some few, it may
be the rest will yield themselves.

5. If this do not prevail, I then conceive under favor, it will be hard to
remedy, unless the State will publicly declare, That if they will be as
Natives, and take the benefit of Subjects, they must conform themselves to the
Laws of the Kingdom as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal. Note
Which Declaration, when it shall once be made public, I think they will be
well advised before they will resist or refuse it.

By these Papers it is apparent, That this Arch-Prelate was the Original
Contriver of all the proceedings against the Dutch and French Churches. In
pursuance of these determinations of his, in his Metropoliticall Visitation
Ann. 1634. and 1635. he summoned all the Ministers and Elders of these Churches
to appear before Sir Nathaniel Brent his Vicar General; as appears by an
Abstract of his Visitation endorsed with his own hand, unto whom he prescribed
these two following Injunctions.

1. That all the Natives of the Dutch and Walloon Congregations in his Graces
Diocese, are to repair to their several Parish Churches of those several
Parishes where they inhabit, to hear Divine Service and Sermons, and perform
all duties and payments required in that behalf.

2. That the Ministers and all others of the Dutch and Walloon Congregations
which are not Natives and borne Subjects to the Kings Majesty, or any other
strangers that shall come over to them, while they remain strangers, may have
and use their own Discipline as formerly they have done; yet it is thought
sit, that the English Liturgy should be translated into French and Dutch, for
the better settling of their children to the English Government.

These Injunctions were prescribed to the Foreign Churches at Norwich, An.
1634. and to these at Canterbury, Maidstone, and Sandwich, 13. Aprilis 1635. as
appears by sundry Copies of them found in the Archbishops study: and the like
were imposed on all other Dutch and Walloon Churches within his Province. Yet
not content herewith, he caused the Archbishop of York to impose harder
conditions on the Foreign Congregations within his Province; as appears by
two Letters found in his study under the Archbishop of Yorks own hand, the one
dated October. 1. 1636. the other 22 Ian. 1637. Wherein he denies them the
exercise of any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of their own, injoynes them the
use of the English Liturgy in the French Tongue, with obedience to all the
Laws and Ordinances of the Church of England, to receive the Sacrament once a
year in the Parish Church wherein they dwell, and to perform all their
Christnings, Marriages, and Burials there; else no Congregation of their own
would be permitted. Hereupon these Forraigners conceiving these Injunctions
prejudicial to their Ancient Rights, Liberties indulged them, and destructive
to their Churches, opposed them all they could in an humble way.

Upon the publication of these Injunctions, the Dutch and Walloon Churches at
Norwich presented this ensuing Remonstrance to the Bishop there, who sent it up
to the Archbishop, who received it as appears by the endorsement Febr. 21.
1634.

TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD RICHARD LORD BISHOP OF NORWICH.
The humble Remonstrance and Petition of the two Congregations of Strangers in
the City of Norwich.

IT has pleased my Lords Grace of Canterbury to send forth lately two
Injunctions to the three Congregations of Strangers, Canterbury, Sandwich, and
Maidstone in his Graces Diocese, to this effect. 1. That their English Natives
should separate from them, and resort to the English Parish Churches where they
dwell. 2. That the Remainder of them, being strangers borne, should receive and
use the English Liturgy, translated into their own language, upon the first day
of March next. The which is generally conceived to be a leading case for all
the Strangers Congregations that are in England.

1 Now forasmuch as the said Injunctions seem to be opposite, not only to
sundry Orders of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council heretofore upon
several occasions granted unto several Congregations of the said Strangers;
but chiefly to all the gracious Liberties, and Privileges granted unto them of
old, and continued during the Reign of three most famous Princes, King Edward,
Queen Elizabeth, and King James of glorious memory; And confirmed by his now
Majesty's Regal word our gracious Sovereign (whom God long preserve) which he
was pleased graciously to give unto the Deputies of all the strangers
Congregations in England, prostrate at his Majesty's feet, the 30 of April 1625.

2 And also, that the observing of the said Injunctions will necessarily draw
after it many great and unavoydable Inconveniences both common and personal;
as namely that

1 The Parishes shall be needlessely charged with a great multitude of poor
Strangers that are English Natives.

2 Many such Natives shall ipso facto lose the benefit of their Toleration in
exercising their Manufactures, having not served their seven years
Apprentiships, and be in danger of ruin or molestation.

3 Many such also that understand not well the English tongue, shall be little
edified by the English Prayers and Sermons which they shall hear.

4 Their Families shall be divided, some going one way, some another to their
appointed Assemblies; which may minister an unhappy opportunity of
licentiousness to servants and children that are loosely minded.

5 The Alien strangers that shall remain, being not the fourth part of the now
standing Congregations (especially in this City) for want of competent ability
to maintain their Minister and poor, must needs be utterly dissolved and come
to nothing.

6 So the ancient and much renowned Asyla, and places of refuge for the poor
persecuted and other ignorant Christians beyond the Seas, shall be wanting;
whereat Rome will rejoice, and the Reformed Churches in all places will mourn.

7 Many Ministers (and those ancient) having no other means but their
Congregations, which shall then fail them, shall be to seek for themselves and
their destituted Families.

8 The Foreign poor will be added to the Native poor, and increase the
charge and burden of their several Parishes, who will be to them no welcome
guests; or else be sent away beyond Sea, where they will open many mouths
against the authors of their misery.

9 The Commonwealth shall lose many skillful workmen in sundry Manufactures,
whom in times past the Land has so much desired.

10 Many thousand English of the poorer sort shall miss their good masters
that set them on work and paid them well, which will cause them to grieve at
their departure, if not to murmr.

11 And say a handful of Aliens should remain to make up a poor
Congregation, where shall they baptize their newborn Infants? If in their
Parish Churches, then shall the strangers lose one of their Sacraments; and if
in the said strangers Congregation, then it would be known when they shall be
sent away to be admitted as Natives in their English Parishes.

12 A greater difficulty will yet arise about the English Rites and Ceremonies
enjoined to such Aliens as shall remain. For though they mislike them not in
the English Churches, unto the which upon occasion they do willingly resort;
yet when this Innovation shall come upon them, it will be so uncouth and
strange, as it is doubtful whether it, or the separation of the Natives from
the Aliens, will bring the more trouble; And whether they will not both be
followed (though not aequis passibus) with the utter dissolution of their
Congregations.

13 And the rather, because it is not likely that upon their want of a
Minister, any will be ready to come (though sent for) from beyond the Seas to
serve them upon these two Conditions. The one, to be contented with so mean a
stipend as they shall then be able to afford, and that uncertain too. The
other, to observe such Rites and Ceremonies as they were never acquainted
withal, yea are offensive to some beyond the Seas, from whence they shall be
called.

3 Lastly, forasmuch as we have given no occasion of offense that might deserve
the taking away of our former Liberties, but have still demeaned our selves
peaceably and respectively toward the English Discipline; Neither do we harbor
any factious English persons as members of our Congregations; And also that by
two several Orders of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council, your
Lordship and your Successors have power to order the disordered in both the
Congregations, if any shall happen.

Therefore we humbly entreat your good Lordship seriously to take the premises
into your grave and judicious consideration; And as occasion shall serve, to
acquaint his Grace of Canterbury with them if your Lordship think it so
fitting. Unto whose Grace we desire our humble duties to be presented; humbly
beseeching his Grace that he will be pleased to be graciously and favorably
inclined to us and the rest of the strangers; And (if it be possible) to stay
the proceedings of his Graces Commissaries upon the said three Congregations of
his Graces Diocese; that so they and we all may yet continue under the shadow
of His Majesty's most gracious protection and Toleration, as before. And we
shall pray for his Graces and your Honors long life and prosperity.

These weighty motives not prevailing, they presented an humble Petition to the
Archbishop himself Iun. 26. 1635. endorsed with his own hand, and seized in
his study by Mr Prynne, the same in substance with their Remonstrance to the
Bishop of Norwich; beseeching his Grace to be pleased to take these their
motives into his pious and charitable consideration, and to suffer them yet to
enjoy the benefit of his Majesty's and his Noble Predecessors grace of
Toleration.

To this Petition after much solicitation, means and friends made to the
Archbishop, he returned a very peremptory Answer in a Letter of his to the
Dutch and Walloone Congregations at Norwich, dated August, 19. 1635. the Copy
whereof was found in his study; wherein all the favor he would grant to them
(or any other forraigue Churches) was this;

That his Majesty was resolved, that his Injunctions shall hold, and that
obedience shall be yielded to them by all the Natives after the first descent,
who might continue in their Congregations, to the end the Aliens might the
better look to the education of their children; and that their several
Congregations might not be too much lessened at once; but that all of the
second descent borne here in England, and so termed, should resort to their
several Parish Churches whereas they dwell; concluding his Letter in those
words: And thus I have given you answer fairly in all your particulars, and
do expect all obedience and conformity to my Injunctions; which if you shall
perform, the State will have occasion to see how ready you are to practice the
obedience which you teach. And for my part, I doubt not but your selves, or
your posterity at least, shall have cause to thank both the State and the
Church, for this care taken of you; But if you refuse (as you have no cause to
do, and I hope you will not) I shall then proceed against the Natives
according to the Laws and Canons Ecclesiastical. So hopeing the best of your
selves and your obedience, I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest

Your loving Friend W. Cant.
August. 19. 1635.

By these Injunctions these Churches were molested and disquieted some three or
four years space; some of them interdicted, suspended and shut up for a time,
for refusing conformity; others of them dissolved, their Ministers deserting
them rather then submitting to these Injunctions, all of them much diminished,
discontented, the maintenance of their Ministers and poor Members much
impaired almost to their utter desolation, notwithstanding all the great
friends they could make to intercede in their behalf; and they brought quite
under that Episcopal Jurisdiction and Tyranny, from which they were formerly
exempted. Hereupon many conscientious Aliens and their children deserted the
Kingdom, who could not in conscience submit to the Ceremonies, Innovations in
our Churches, and most of their Families were miserably distracted, as appears
by a Summary Relation of the Archbishops proceedings herein, presented to the
Parliament, and by a late printed Book, entitled, A Relation of the Troubles
of the three Foreign Churches in Kent, caused by the Injunctions of William
Laud Archbishop of Canterbury, Anno Dom. 1634. (set forth by John Bulteel
Minister of Gods Word to the Walloon Congregation of Canterbury, printed Anno
1645.) to which we shall refer the Reader for fuller satisfaction.

And as he thus endeavored to subvert the Foreign Dutch, French, and Walloon
Churches at home, and to press the English Liturgy upon them; so he attempted
to disturb our English Regiments and Congregations abroad in Foreign parts
and Plantations, by imposing the strict observation of the English Liturgy and
Ceremonies on them not formerly used, by Orders from the Council Table
(especially by that of October 1. 1633. to the Merchant-Adventurers) which bred
great disturbances among them, as appears by sundry Letters from Sir William
Boswell, Mr Stephen Goffe, and others, found in the Archbishops study, which we
shall pretermit for brevity sake; only we shall insert the Copy of his own
Letter to the Merchants at Delfe (found in his study) dated June 17. 1634.

AFter our hearty Commendations etc. We are commanded by his Majesty to
signify unto you, that this Bearer Mr Beaumont, chosen by joint consent of
your Company to be your Preacher at Delfe, or where else you shall at any time
reside, is a man learned, sober, and conformable to the Doctrine and Discipline
established in the Church of England; And that you are to receive him with all
decent and courteous usage fitting his Person and Calling, and to allow him the
usual ancient stipend which Mr Forbes lately, or any other before him has
received. And farther we are to let you know, that it is his Majesty's express
Command, that both you, the Deputy, and all and every other Merchant, that is,
or shall be residing in those parts beyond the Seas, do conform themselves
to the Doctrine and Discipline settled in the Church of England: And that they
frequent the Common Prayers with all religious Duty and Reverence at all times
required, as well as they do Sermons: And that out of your Company you do
yearly about Easter, as the Canons prescribe, name two Church Wardens, and two
Sidesmen, which may look to the Orders of the Church, and give an Account
according to their Office. And Mr Beaumont himself is hereby to take notice
that his Majesty's express pleasure and Command to him is, that he do
punctually keep and observe all the Orders of the Church of England as they are
prescribed in the Canons and the Rubricks of the Liturgy. And that if any of
your Company shall show themselves refractory to this Ordinance of his Majesty
(which we hope will not be) he is to certify the name of any such Offender and
his offense to the Lord Bishop of London for the time being, who is to take
order and give remedy accordingly. And these Letters you are to register and
keep by you, that they which come after may understand what care his Majesty
has taken for the well ordering of your Company in Church affairs. And you
are likewise to deliver a Copy of these Letters to Mr Beaumont, and to every
Successor of his respectively, that he and they may know what his Majesty
expects from them, and be the more inexcusable if they disobey. Thus not
doubting but that you will show your selves very respectfull of these his
Majesty's Commands, we leave you to the Grace of God and rest.

Your very loving friend W. Cant.


By all which premises compared with his forementioned judgment of the
Foreign Churches, that they were no true Churches of Christ because they had
no Bishops; their Ministers no Ministers, and their Religion not the same with
ours; it is infallibly evident, that his design was to suppress and subvert
the Dutch and French Churches by degrees at home, and to embroyle them and our
English Congregations abroad, for the better advancement of the Roman Catholic
Church and Religion both at home and in Foreign parts. And so we have fully
made good the twelfth Original Article against him in all particulars.

Our eigth and last Evidence to prove his traiterous design to subvert the
Protestant Religion and bring in Popery, is comprised in the 13 Original
Article; That he has traitorously and trecherously plotted and endeavored to
stir up war and enmity betwixt his Majesty's two Kingdoms of England and
Scotland, and to that purpose has labored to introduce into the Kingdom of
Scotland diverse Innovations both in Religion and Government, all or the most
part of them tending to Popery and Superstition, to the great grievance and
discontent of his Majesty's Subjects of that Nation; and for their refusing to
submit to these Innovations, he did traitorously advise his Majesty to subdue
them by force of Arms etc. Nay joined in confederacy with the Papists, Priests,
Jesuits, and employed Popish Captains and Commanders to make war against
them; all which we can abundently prove by sundry Papers, under his own hand;
by Original Letters found in his study, and sundry Additions, Alterations in
the New Scottish Liturgy See A Necessary Introduction to the Archbishops
Trial, p. 148, to 156.
elsewhere recorded, the Original Copy whereof we have ready to produce under
his own hand. But because he has pleaded the Act of Pacification and Oblivion
made since his Impeachment in bar of this Article, and the Scottish Liturgy
(which doubtless it extends not to) and thereby has tacitly acknowledged the
truth of this Article, of which he dares not abide the trial; we shall
forbear to give any evidence thereon, till his plea be over-ruld; which the
Commons did not press the Lords to do, because they would avoid expense of
time, and conceived their forementioned evidence very full to convict him
guilty of the first branch of his first general Charge (abundantly proved by
all the premises) That he has traitorously endeavored to subvert Gods true
Religion, by Law established in this Realm, and instead thereof to set up
Popery, Superstition, and Idolatry.

The second BRANCH of the first general CHARGE concerning the ARCHBISHOPS
endeavors to reconcile the Church of England to the Church of ROME.
WE shall now pass on to the second Branch of the Archbishops first general
impeachment touching Religion, thus expressed in the tenth original Article.

That he has traitorously and wickedly endeavored to reconcile the Church of
England with the Church of Rome; and for the effecting thereof, has
confederated with diverse popish Priests and Jesuits, and has kept secret
intelligence with the Pope of Rome, and by himself, his Agents and
Instruments, treated with such as have from thence received authority and
instructions; he has permitted and countenanced a popish Hierarchy, or
Ecclesiastical government to be established in this Kingdom; by all which
traitorous and malicious practices, the Church and Kingdom has been
exceedingly endangered, and has been like to fall under the tyranny of the
Roman Sea. Which is somewhat amplified in the seventh additional Article, which
we shall conuex thereto.

To prove this Article, we shall lay down and make good two ground-workes
(which the precedent Evidence has sufficiently cleared:) First, that this
Archbishop has been generally reputed a Person popishly affected, and a
Papist in heart, both whiles he was resident in the University of Oxford and
ever since; and that he was believed, reported to be such a one by the popish
party, both at Rome, and elsewhere beyond the Seas. No wonder therefore if he
endeavored to reconcile and reduce the Church of England to the Church of Rome.

To prove the Arch bishop a reputed Papist whiles he was resident in Oxford, we
shall produce two Witnesses of credit, who knew him very well there, and have
had some near relation to him since. The first is Doctor Danel Featly, who
deposed viva voce at the Bar, That the Archbishop whiles he was remaining in
Oxford, was generally reputed to be popishly affected, and one addicted to the
popish party, and that he meeting a Pupil of his at Paris in France (when he
waited on Sir Thomas Edmonds as his Chaplain there) which Pupil had turned a
Papist; discoursing with him concerning this Archbishop (then resident in
Saint John's College in Oxford) he told him, that Doctor Laud his Tutor was
against the Popes supremacy, NOTE.
but did maintain many Catholic points of their Religion. The second is Sir
Nathaniel Brent, his own Vicar-generall, who deposed at the Bar, that this
Arch bishop while he continued in Oxford, was there generally reputed to be
popish; that he and others conceived him so, not upon any fained but upon very
probable grounds; one whereof, then generally taken notice of, was, that when
he did his exercise for Batchelour of Divinity, he took his supposition almost
verbation out of Bellarmine, which he remembers the better, because one Mr.
Dale then Proctor, his Opponent, who took exceptions at it, showed him his
supposition in Bellarmines Works, concerning the necessity of Baptism, which
was consonant to the tenent of Rome. Another ground of this opinion of him was,
that he held acquaintance, and most familiarly conversed with those in the
University who were most addicted to Popery, and reputed Papists, and had
sundry differences, bickerings, disputes with many sound Divines about points
in Religion; particularly, he had very intimate acquaintance with, and often
frequented the company of one Brown, reputed a Papist in his life, and found
to be so after his death; there being a manuscript writ with his own hand, and
thought to be his own, found in his Study, in defense of popery, and
maintaining among other things, that one might be a Minister, officiate, and
actually remain in the Church of England, NOTE.
and yet be actually reconciled to the Church of Rome. This book King James
hearing of, sent for it; which being brought to him, when he had read this
passage, he said, if this position of his were true, he could not now tell whom
to trust; And that there was such a general report of the Archbishop then he
thought himself would not deny, and for that he had seen that book of Browns,
a petition of this Bishops in a great man's hands, to whom King James delivered
them, wherein healleaged, that he NOTE.
was traduced to be a Papist, but desired his Majesty not to think so of him.

To these testimomies we shall add a notable passage in Doctor Abbot's Sermon

155. on which you may reflect.

man might say unto them, Nosteres an adversariorum? who under pretense of
truth and preaching against the Puritan, strike at the heart and root of the
faith and Religion new established among us, etc. That they cannot plead, they
are ACCOUNTED PAPISTS, because they speak against the puritan, but because
BEING INDEED PAPISTS, they speak nothing against them; If they do at any time
speak against the papists, they do but beat a little about the Bush, and that
but softly too, for fear of waking and disquieting the birds that are in it;
they speak nothing, but that wherein one Papist will speak against another; as
against Equivocation, the Popes temporal authority, and the like; and perhaps
some of their blasphemous speeches: But in the point of Freewill,
Justification, Concupiscence being a sin after Baptism, inherent
righteousness, and certainty of salvation, THE PAPISTS BEYOND THE SEAS CAN SAY
THEY ARE WHOLLY THEIRS, AND THE RECUSANTS NOTE.
AT HOME MAKE THEIR BRAGS OF THEM, AND IN ALL THINGS THEY KEEP THEMSELVES SO
NEAR THE BRINK, THAT UPON ANY OCCASION THEY MAY STEP OVER TO THEM.

Now for this speech, that the Presbyterians are as bad as the Papists; there
is a sting in the speech, which I wish had been left out; for there are many
churches beyond the seas, which contend for the Religion established among us,
which yet have approved and admitted the presbytery; and this is to make them
as bad as the papists. Besides, there have lived among us many reverend and
worthy men, which have not rejected the presbytery, taking it even for
Lay Elders: and among the rest Doctor Nowell, late Deane of Paul's, in his
Larger Catechism, page 29. and 71. affirms, that in every well-governed
Church there was a Presbytery; and yet this Catechism by the late reverend
Archbishop of Canterbury, was commanded to be had in every Grammar School;
Which surely he would not have done, if the presbyterians were as da^rous or
bad as the papists.

And now that I have cleared my self from this imputation of being for the
presbytery, it will lie upon them to CLEAR THRMSELVES IF THEY CAN FROM THEIR
SUSPICION OF POPERY: For as Saint Hierom speaks NOTE.
In crimine haereseos patientem esse non decet: And for their speech of
preferment, its not that I look for; I make account I have lived to the end of
a Students life; and God forbid that now for the hope of a little preferment, I
should betray the cause of Christ: I have been ever of this mind: if there be
no preferment on earth there is enough in Heaven: And my desire is, while I
live here, to walk in sincerity and truth: If I should do otherwise, how
should I look my Savior in the face? might he not say uto me, what art thou?
ROMISH or English? PAPIST or PROTESTANT? or what art thou? A MONGRELL OR
COMPOUND OF BOTH? A Protestant by NOTE.
Ordination, A PAPIST in the point of Freewill, inherent Righteousness, and

not come.

These Notes of Doctor Abbots Sermon were found in this Archbishops Study,
written with his own hand (produced and attested by Master Prynne) enclosed in
a copy of a Letter of his to the then Bishop of Lincoln, under his own hand
too, thus indorsed by him; April. 18. 1615. The copy of a Letter which I sent
to the Lord Bishop of Lincoln concerning a Sermon, in which Doctor Abbot HAD
WRONGED ME IN THE UNIVERSITY: In which Letter he enclosed these Notes for his
Lordship to peruse, complaining thus therein, I came time enough to be at the
rehearsal of this Sermon: upon much persuasion I went to Church, where I was
feign to sit patiently, and hear my self abused almost an hour together, yet
I was pointed at as I sat; for this present abuse, I would have taken no
notice of it, but that THE WHOLE UNIVERSITY APPLIES IT TO ME; and my own
friends tell me, I shall sink my credit, if I answer not Doctor Abbot in his
own NOTE.
kind: Nevertheless in a business of this kind, I will not be swayed from a
patient course; Only I desire your Lordship to vouchsafe me some direction
what to do, etc.

By which it is clear, under his own handwriting, that Doctor Abbot and the
whole University in the year 1615. reputed and accounted him a Papist; a Papist
indeed, at leastwise, partly Romish, and partly English; or a mongrell and a
compound of a Papist and Protestant; one ready upon all occasions to step over
to the Papists: A Papist in the Doctrine of freewill, justificaiian by works,
inherent righteousness, concupiscence no sin after Baptism, certainly of
salvation, and the Doctrine of the Sacrament; and that the papists beyond the
seas could say, he was WHOLLY THEIRS, and the Recusants at home make their
brags of him.

This his temper was the cause of Doctor Hals Letter to W. L. (William Laud as
is generally conceived) long since printed, Anno 1608. in the third Decad of
his Epistles; Epist. 5. page 55. (for which his works were lately threatened to
be called in, or this Leter expunged out of them) wherein he thus expostulates
with him for his unsetlednesse and newtrality in Religion, and inclining to the
popish party: I would I knew where to find you, then I could tell how to take a
direct aim, whereas now I must rove and conjecture; to day YOU ARE IN THE
TENTS OF THE ROMANISTS; to morrow in ours; the next day between both, NOTE.
against both: Our adversaries think you ours; WE, THEIRS. Your conscience
finds you with both, and neither: I flatter you not; this of yours, is the
worst of all tempers; how long will you walk in this indifferency? resolve one
way, and know at last what you do hold; that you should cast off either your
wings, or your teeth: and loathing this Batlike nature, be either a bird or a
beast, etc.

We shall conclude this part of our Evidence with the deposition of Francis
Harris, a converted Priest, examined upon oath before the Lords, who being in
the Parliaments Army, could not possibly be procured viva voce (of which oath
was made) and thereupon his deposition was read as follows.

The Examination of FRANCIS HARRIS of Christ-Church London, taken Jan. 9. 1643.
before the Lords Committee, appointed to take the Examinations in the Cause of
the Archbishop of Canterbury.
THis Deponent says, that he being at Paris in France, about 24. years since,
meeting with one Ireland (who had formerly bin one of the chief Schoolmasters
of Westmin. School, and then a Priest) and discoursing familiarly with this
Deponent, the said Ireland told him, that the now Arch bishop of Canterbury and
he were intimate friends, and that he had discovered unto him, when they were
in the University together, that the said Archbishops resolution was, to leave
the Kingdom, and to reconcile himself to the Church of Rome, and that he knew
him to be a Papist in his NOTE.
heart, and wondered why he staid so long behind, saying, that perchance honores
mutant mores. And this Deponent further says, That one Leander a Benedictine
Friar, and Doctor of the Chair at Doway, by the common report of Papists and
Priests, both abroad and in England, was very familiar with the said
Archbishop, and came over on purpose into England (where this Deponent since
saw him) to negotiate with the said Archbishop about matters of Religion, to
make a reconciliation between the Church of Rome and England: And this Deponent
was bred up a Roman Catholic, and a scholar, and a secular Priest, and upon
better advice reconciling himself to the Church of England did often solicit
and petition the said Archbi. for some mean employment in the Ministry, as
having done very good service in discovering Priests and Jesuits to the
Messengers appointed to apprehend them, but the Archbishop never gave hau any
encouragement or countenance.

This Examination taken before Us, Kent. Lincoln. Francis Harris.

That he has been reputed a Papist in heart, opinion and practice ever since
he left the University, is so notoriously known to all, that we shall produce
no witnesses, many having been publicly censured, and privately questioned by
his power, for calling and reporting him such a one and many public papers
being pasted up and scattered about the City and Court from time to time,
proclaiming him such a one, of which we have at least a dozen, found among his
own and Secretary Windebankes writings: and that our English popish priests
and Roman Catholics (as well as Protestants) beasted of him to be theirs, we
have many instances which we could produce, did we need such evidence, and
the testimony of two Priests to boot.

But we shall rather inform and prove to your Lordships, what repute the
papists had of him in foraigne parts, yea even in Rome it self, since himself
has chalked ^^ out the way, and furnished us with this kind of proof, by
procuring Sir Henry Mildmay (a Member of the House of Commons) very
unseasonably and unhappily to testify for him in this kind, what a hard
opinion they had of him, and how much he was hated in Rome by the Jesuits and
others, more then any man breathing, the manner of enforcing whose testimony
is very remarkable.

The Archbishop some fevv days before his trial, petitioned the House of
Commons, that Sir Henry Mildmay of the Jewel House (one of their Members)
might be examined in his behalf, as a special witness for him, how much he
was hated and spoken against above all men at Rome, for opposing the Popes and
Papists designs in England. Which being granted, the Archbishop moved two or
three times very unseasonably, that Sir Henry might be called to give in his
testimony in this kind; who being then out of Town and not appearing the
Committee of Commons who managed the Evidence, promised to send for, and cause
him to appear the next day at the Lords Bar; which he did, to wit, on June
11. 1644. Whereupon the Archbishop desired him to acquaint the Lords. Whether
he had not been of late years at Rome, and what opinion they held of himself
there? Whether Sir Henry upon his return from thence, dining with him at
Lambeth, did not tell him of his own accord, he was the most odiousman of any
at Rome? and therefore certainly the furthest of any from setting up popery,
and endeavoring to reconcile us to Rome. Whereupon Sir Henry said; My Lords,
it is true, J was some few years since at Rome not upon any message or design
at all, but being somewhat infirm in body, J was advised by my physicians to
travel for a time into foreign parts to recover my health: Whereupon J first
travailed into France, from thence into Italy, and being there, to satisfy my
own curiosity, and recover my health, J traveled to Rome. During my abode
there, J was very inquisitive to know, what opinion they had of us in England,
and of the great men there, especially of the Archbishop of Canterbury: and I
observed there were some there that were against the Archbishop, and spoke ill
of him; others that spoke very well of him, and so much I informed him at
Lambeth upon my return from thence; but I deny that ever I told him, he was
the most odious man at Rome of any, or, of any that had sat in that Sea: The
Archbishop then averred, that he used these speeches to him at dinner at
Lambeth, at a time when Auditor Phillips was there; who demanded of Sir Henry,
whether he saw the Pope when he was at Rome, and what manner of man he was? Who
replied, that he saw him in his Garden out of a window, riding a great horse in
a morning, and that he was very like the Auditor; Sir Henry confessed this
discourse with the Auditor, but absolutely denied he ever said, he was the most
odious man at Rome of any, etc. and desired him to prove it: Whereupon the
Archbishop asked of his Secretary Dell, whether he did not hear Sir Henry tell
him so much at dinner? Who answered, that he did not hear him say so, but that
his Grace told him after dinner that he said so; which Sir Henry peremptorily
denied: After which Sir Henry being demanded by Master Sergeant Wild, who they
were that spoke against the Archbishop, who for him? and what he conceived to
be the cause why some spoke thus against him, others in his behalf? He
answered, that there were two factions in Rome, one of the Jesuits; some of
these disliked the Archbishop and spoke against him, because they conceived he
aimed at too great an Ecclesiastical power in these Kingdoms, for himself:
The other was of the Secular Priests who all spoke very well of him and
commended him, because he carried himself in such sort in the government of
our Church, as to draw it nearer unto the Church of Rome, and showed himself
favorable to their party: Whereupon the Archbishop said, that Sir Henry never
told him this before: Who answered, it was true; and the reason was, because he
never demanded of him any such Question, but now he was demanded the Question
upon his Oath, and therefore he must speak the truth. At which passage most of
the Auditory smiled, and the Committee of Commons who managed the Evidence,
thanked the Archbishop for this good testimony on his behalf, desiring him to
furnish them with some more such witnesses: Adding, that seeing Sir Henry was
but a single witness in this case, and so perhaps the Archbishop would evade
his testimony, though produced by himself; and since he had given them this
occasion, to examine what opinion the Priests and Jesuits had of him at Rome;
they therefore humbly desired, that they might now produce the testimonies of
some other Gentlemen of note, who had been at Rome as well as S. Hen. and could
give as good or better an account of his credit there, as he had done.
Whereupon they poduced Captain Authony Mildmay (brother to Sir Henry) to
testify his knowledge in this particular; who deposed at the Bar upon oath;
That he was at Rome at the time when Con, the Popes Nuncio, was to come over
into Eng. as Nuncio; who then enquired of him concerning the infirmities and
age of Archbishop Abbot, and thereupon said, Bishop Laud who is to succeed
him, will be more favorable to us then he has been: That there were two great
factions in Rome one of the Jesuits, another of the Secular Priests; that the
Jesuits faction did not like the Archb. because he usurped too much
Ecclesiastical power to himself and endeavored to make himself a Patriarch
over all his Majesty's Kingdoms; but the Secular Priests and their faction
loved and spoke very well of him, because they said they knew him to be their
friend, and that he had a design to bring the Popish Religion into England:
NOTE.
That Father Fitton and Father John told him, that there was a design to
reconcile England to the Church of Rome, that Bishop Laud was the chief
instrument in it, that other English Bishops did join with him in the design,
and that he should find, that there should be none preferred in the Court, but
such as were Papists, or affected to popery: That Father Fitton being the
general agent for the Secular Priests, had extraordinary good intelligence
from England, and that Master Walter Mountague when he was at Rome, lay at his
house; that Father John was the general agent at Rome for the Benedictines;
and that Father Talbot a Jesuit, had told him as much as these two had done
concerning Bishop Laud; who yet spoke somewhat ill of him, because (said he) he
intends to make himself a Patriark of all the Kings Dominions out of his
pride, which (he said) would eclipse the Popes authority, and therefore he said
he NOTE.
was condemned at Rome by their party (the Jesuits) for this particular,
although otherwise he was a great favourer of their Religion.

This testimony, even from Rome it self, is very full and punctual to our
purpose, that there was no difference at all between the Secular Priests and
the Archbishop, nor yet between the Jesuits and him, but only this, that he out
of his ambition would, like his Predecessor Anselme, be Malmesb. De Gest.
Pontif. Angl. l. 1. Relation of a Conference with Fisher. page 271.
Papa alterius orbis, the Pope or Patriark of our other world and of the Kings
Dominions (which the titles of Sanctitatis Vestrae and Sanctissime Pater,
attributed to him by the University of Oxford and Master Croxton, made them
jealous of) which the Jesuits could not well brook at Rome.

But to make this more clear, we shall add one witness more, who has been
often times at Rome, and spent diverse years among papists in foraigne parts,
and that is one Master Thomas Challoner a Gentleman of quality, who thereupon
being sworn gave in this following testimony, viva voce upon oath, which he set
down under his own hand.

MY LORDS,
TOuching the Archbishop of Canterbury, I can say little in particular, but in
general thus:

First, that for these fourteen or fifteen years last past, it has been my
fortune diverse and sundry times to be in France, Flanders, Holland and Italy,
where very often happening into the company of Lawyers priests, and men of the
long Robe, I found them always very forward in their discourse of England, and
of the great hopes they had to see it suddenly reduced to the catholic faith:
that they had many great parsons in England who were secretly of their
religion, and in particular, the Archbishop, whom they avowed to be wholly
theirs, a good Roman Catholic, a politic propagator NOTE.
of the Roman faith, by minutes and degrees, wherein he used great subtilty and
craft, which they called wisdom; and that both he and others would openly
declare themselves so to be in time convenient, beseeching God and the blessed
Virgin to prosper his designs. And this is so notorious, as I believe no man
of any experience in foraigne parts who has had an ear to hear, or a tongue
and heart to speak the truth, but has heard the same often re-iterated and
will attest it. Yet upon what foundation these opinions should be built, I am
not precisely able to determine.

Secondly, that eleven or twelve years since I being at Bruxels in Brabant, and
there discoursing with an English Gentleman, who had been an ancient traveller,
touching the then late rooting out of sundry English able and orthodox
Ministers, for not complying with the Bishops in diverse new idolatrous
ceremonies; this Gentleman assured me, that he had often heard of strange
reports of matters likely to befall England, both from English and Irish
papists, which he gave no heed unto, supposing them to speak rather as they
would have it, then as it was in verity: But now that he had heard so much from
me, he did much suspect that there was some plot in hand to change the Religion
in Eng. whereof he would diligently enquire, assuring me that he had as good
means to know it, as any man of our Nation that lived on that side of the Seas.
At our next meeting, he told me, that he had dived into the plot. That ere
long, NOTE:
we must all of necessity be papists in Eng. that the best wits both in Eng.
and on that side of the Seas were interested therein: That it was so politickly
laid, that he did not see how in the judgment of man it could possibly be
prevented: That the Archb. and some other Bishops were of the plot, and that
the rest of the Bishops and Clergy, partly for fear of losing what they had,
partly for hopes of geting more, would undoubtedly comply: That the refusers if
they could not be corrupted, were to be turned out of their livings, banished,
imprisoned, or forced to live in obscurity: That it was to be done by
gradations, to bring in this point of Popery in one quarter of a year, and the
rest in another; and if not direct popery, yet so near thereunto, as the common
people themselves would slide into it unawares: that nothing but the King of
Sweden's prosperity did hinder the sudden effecting of it. Lastly, that if we
resisted not, we should be cheated and cozened of our Religion; and if we
resisted, we should be compelled thereto perforce.

I replied, that I thought the Papists in England were not of any considerable
number to effect their ends by force, and that they were also dis-armed. He
told me the Papists were more in number, and better armed then I conceived them
to be; many going now to Church, who would then declare themselves papists;
besides a world of Newters, who for hopes of preferment, would be easily drawn
to their party: that they were all united, and besides armed with authority:
He affirming, that for many years we had wholy been governed by Papists;
most men in highest authority being either wholy so, or at least, as
serviceable unto them for private ends, as if they were so indeed.

I replied, that if we should be compelled to defend our Religion by force,
their authority would not be regarded. He told me, the Irish would be brought
in. I answered, NOTE.
that I had spent some years in Ireland, and knew them to want both courage and
means to effect so great a business, so that unless they were backed by the
King of Spain in a better manner then I conceived he was able at that time to
do, they durst not undertake it. He told me, they should have a better back,
and more encouragement then the King of Spain could give them, and that both
France and Spain should assist therein.

I replied, that I thought France and Spain were likely to disagree, and
therefore unfit for such a business. He told me, that since J would needs
have it, the greatest introducers of popery should be the Protestants
themselves: Whereat when J vvondred, as seeming to me a paradox; he told me,
that the war should be so disguised, under NOTE:
false notions and pretenses, as the Protestants should ignorantly become the
Jesuits servants, and by the effusion of their own blood, set up popery by
force.

Thirdly, that being in Rome seven or eight years since, one Father John of the
Order of Saint Benet, was very tnquisitive of me to know, who bestovved the
livings in England, and whether the Arch bishop did not do it? I answered,
that the livings NOTE.
were in the donation of such as had the Advousons of them whether it were the
King Arch bishops, Bishops, Deanes and Chapters, Colleges, Corporations, Noble
men, Gentlemen or others. He asked me, if the Archbishop did not bestow the
Kings livings? I said no but the Lord Keeper, if they were under such a value;
if above, the King himself. He seemed very much agrieved that the Archbishop
did not bestow them, and NOTE:
told me, that he did not despair of seeing England to be very suddenly
Catholic: And though be were, by reason of his Order, tied more strictly to
the Pope then others were, yet he was careful to have both Kings and Kingdoms
privileges preserved, and more particularly, that the Benefices in England
might not be bestowed upon Italians as formerly, but that the Archbishop
should have the ordering thereof. All this I have often related some years since,
to diverse persons of quality, for which I incurred some trouble by the Jesuits
and this Archbishops means.

This Testimony is so home and punctual, that we shall add no more thereto:
it informs us of a long since plotted and actuated confederacy between this
Archbishop and other English Prelates, and the Popes Instruments at Rome and in
other foreign parts, to introduce popery, and reduce us back to Rome: It
chalks out to us the manner and method of their proceedings in all particulars
and the politic contrivances of all sorts to effect their intended design;
all which we have by woeful experience seen punctually acted, pursued
accordingly to this very moment in which pursuit this Archbishop has been the
Archinstrument; since then we visibly behold these reports of theirs verefied
to the view of all the world; we must no longer look upon them is empty rumors
or discourses, but as real Evidences beyond all exceptions.

The second groundwork we shall lay and prove is this: That there has been for
many years last past, a dangerous damnable Plot, and serious endeavor of the
Pope and his Instruments to reduce and reconcile the Church of England to the
Church and Sea of Rome, and that this Archbishop was privy to, and had notice
of it.

This Plot was first laid about the year 1617. when the Spanish Match was set
See A necessary Introduction to the Archbishops Trial, p. 1. to 50.
on foot, and King Charles (then Prince of Wales) fent into Spain, of purpose
to reconcile him (and in him our Kingdoms) to the Church of Rome, the prime
end the Pope and Catholics intended in that Match and Treaty; as appears by
the several Articles passages and proceedings in it, well known to this
Prelate, by the Popes Letter to the Prince, whiles in Spain, to reconcile him
to Rome, and make him a dutiful Son of that Church, by the Popes Letter to
his Nuncio, the Bishop of Conchen (when the Prince was in Spain) to endeavor
his conversion to their Church upon this occasion; by a Jesuits Oration, to
induce his Highness to that Religion, and by the Articles of the Duke of
Buckingham against the Lord Digby, and the Lord Digbies Articles of impeachment
against him in Parliament, charging one another reciprocally with high treason,
for endeavoring to withdraw the Prince (when in Spain) from his Religion, and
make him a Roman Catholic; of all which we find Authentic Copies endorsed
with his own and Windebanke (his creatures) hands, among both their seized
papers (already published at large in print, where you may peruse them at
leizure) and therefore he could not possibly be ignorant of this Plot: The
rather because the sending of the King (when Prince) into Spain, was the Duke
of Buckingham's project, of purpose to seduce him in his Religion, for which
there were Ibidem p. 31, 32, 33.
Articles of high Treason exhibited against him by the Lord Digby in the House
of Peers in Parliament, on the first of May, 1626. as appears by the Lords

manifest. June 9. 1622. My Lord Marquess of Buckingham was pleased to enter

next following, The Prince and Marquess Buckingham set forwards very secretly
for Spain.

That this Prelat was privy to the plot of sending the Prince thither, before
he was sent, and to the Instructions given him here how to demean himself even
toward the Pope and his instruments when he came thither, is most apparent by
his own Letter under his own hand, sent to Bishop Hall, Jan. 14. 1639.
wherein there is this notable passage, Here p. 264.
formerly urged upon another occasion.

The last (with which I durst not but acquaint the King) is about Antichrist,
which Title in three or four places of your Book, you bestow upon the Pope
positively and determinately; whereas King James of blessed memory, having
brought strong proof in a work of his, as you well know, to prove the Pope to
be Antichrist, and being aftewards CHALLENGED ABOUT IT, he made this Answer;
WHEN THE KING THAT NOW IS WENT INTO SPAIN, AND ACQUAINTED NOTE.
HIM WITH IT, that he wrote that, not concludingly, but by way of Argument
only, that the Pope and his adherents might see, there was as good and better
Arguments to prove him Antichrist, then for the Pope to challenge temporal
jurisdiction over Kings: THIS WHOLE PASSAGE BEING KNOWN TOME, I could not but
speak with the King about it, who commanded me to write unto you, that you
might qualify NOTE.
your expression in these particulars, and so not differ from the known
judgment of his pious and learned Father, etc.

By this relation under his own hand and Seal, it is as clear as the
noonday Sun, this Prelat was not only privy to the Kings voyage into Spain
before he departed hence, but likewise to the private instructions for his
carriage toward the Pope and his agents when he came there; and his zeal to
have this title of Antichrist given to the Pope by Bishop Hall so lately, thus
qualified, obliterated, and his complaint of it to the King at this time,
plainly shows that he bare a good affection to the Pope and his designs both
then and now, and politickly furnishes King James with this equivocating
Answer, to please his Holiness: and to put all out of question, that he was
privy to this journey before it was undertaken, we shall prove it by his own
Diary; wherein thus he writes: Feb. 17. 1622: The Prince and the Marquess
Buckingham set forwards very secretly for Spain: Feb. 21. I writ to my Lord of
Buckingham into Spain: March 31. 1623. I received Letters from my Lord of
Buckingham out of Spain: April 19. I received Letters from my Lord of
Buckingham out of Spain: June 13. I received Letters from the Duke of
Buckingham out of Spain: Aug. 17. I received Letters from the Duke of
Buckingham out of Spain. By which it is apparent, First, that he knew of the
time of their secret departure to Spain the very day they went: Secondly, that
he knew whether they went, and writ Letters to the Duke into Spain within
four days after their departure hence, before they were near there, or
known to be arrived there: Thirdly, that he held constant intelligence with
the Duke all the time he was in Spain, writing frequently to him, and received
no less then four Letters from him from thence; therefore questionless he was
privy to this perilous journey of the Prince into Spain (one of the horridest
treasons that ever was acted) thereby to pervert him in his Religion, and
reconcile both him and our Kingdoms to the Sea of Rome; for this very act
alone (which his profession, as a Bishop, ought to have engaged him against
with all his might) he deserved to be impeached of high treason as well as the
Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Digby, who impeached one one another of See A
Necessary Introduction to the Archbishop of Canterburies Trial, p. 31, 32,
33, 34.
high treason for it in Parliament, anno 1626. In one word, this Bishop at the
time of the Princes being in Spain, was so far in love with the Masse-book,
and so studious of it, that he noted his Missale Romanum (neatly bound up and
gilt, in folio) almost in every leaf with his own hand, by way of approbation,
and every month in the Callender of it, by inserting into it with his own pen,
the Feasts and Stories of diverse Popish Saints, with the translations of their
Relics; and in the Month of Sepetmber, the 13. day he writes this Memorial
of the Princes return out of Spain; Prince Charles this night took ship at
Saint Andrews to come out of Spain, but had no prayers in his ship that night,
because so many Spaniards were aboard. To prove which, the Missal it self was
produced: This his noting and studying of the Masse-book at that very time,
does as we conceive, strongly intimate his approbation of it, his good hopes
and assistance to introduce it by that Spanish Match, had it succeeded.

But that breaking off (to his grief) soon after the Princes return from
Spain, the next design of the Duke and his popish confederates, to reconcile,
See A Necessary Introduction, etc. p. 69^ to 150.
reduce us to Rome, was the translation of their Scene from Spain into France,
and making up a popish Match there, between the King and our present Queen Mary
(a zealous Roman Catholic and grand patriot of that party) whose powerful
mediation and solicitations, might (as theythen writ) in time effect and
accomplish this plot, as we have elsewhere clearly demonstrated: And in this
project likewise this Archbishop had a finger, if not a hand: For the Duke of
Buckingham (with whom he was a Cabinet Counselor) being sent into France to
consummate that Match, and bring over the Queen from thence, we find this
Archbishop posted Letters thither to him, immediately after his departure
hence, by these several passages in his Diary. May 11. 1625. Die Mercurij

and foelix Stella orbi nostro. These several Letters of his to and from the
Duke upon this occasion (the Originals and Copies whereof could we have met
with them, would doubtless have discovered many notable secrets) intimate,
both his privity to, and concurrence in this popish French Match, as well as in
the Spanish.

This we shall further clear by other passages in his own Diary, discovering
what a great favorite and instrument of the Qveens he has been, even since
the Marriage. Aug. 30. 1634. Saturday at Oatlands, the Queen sent for me, and

would be my friend, and that I should have immediate address to her when I had
occasion. Here we have the Queen trusting the Archbishop with a private
business; her thanks for his discharge of this trust, with a promise of future
favor, and immediate address to her upon all occasions: May 18. and 24. 1635.

lines are so rased that they are not legible: April 3. 1639. Wednesday, before
the Kings going, I settled with him a great business for the Queen, which I
under stood she would never move for her self: the Queen gave me great
thanks, and this, day I waited purposely on her, to give her thanks for her
gracious acceptance; she was pleased to be very free with me, and to promise
me freedom.

This intimacy of the Archbishop with the Queen, these private services he
did for her, and these special mementoes of her favors to, and freeness with
him, could not be to convert her to the Protestant Religion (which he never
attempted in any measure, for ought we ever heard) it being contrary to the
tenth Article of her Marriage, which runs thus; Also the King of Great Britain
is by Oath bound NOT TO ENDEAVOR BY ANY MEANS AT ALL NOTE.
to have his said Queen to renounce the Catholic, Apostolic and Romish
Religion, nor compel her to do any thing whatsoever that is contrary to the
same Religion. Now this Archbi. was so far from endeavoring her conversion
to our Religion himself, that in his own Metropoliticall visitation, he
prohibited Ministers publicly to pray for the Queens conversion in their
Pulpits, and questioned, censured some Ministers in the High Commission, for
praying for her conversion from Popery to our Religion, as a grand unpardonable
offense. To prove this, we shall first produce his own Informations and
Instructions to Sir Nathaniel Brent (endorsed, subscribed with his own hand)
touching his Metropoliticall visitation in the Diocese of London, in March
1636. Among which we find a paper thus endorsed; Informations of diverse abuses
in the City of London: The second particular whereof is this; That some
Preachers take great liberty to pray before and after their Sermons loosly NOTE.
and factiously, as FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE QUEEN: over against which, these
two names are written in the margin; Master Walker of Saint John's Evangelist,
Master Burtons Curate, etc. Saint Matthew Friday-street: To which himself adds
this subscription, directed to his Vicar general that visited:

I require you, that besides my other Instructions, you give me an account of
all particulars within named

W. CANT.

Hereupon Sir Nathaniel Brent in pursuance of this Order, in his open
visitation prohibited the Ministers to pray for the Queens conversion: for
proof whereof, Master Hugh Ratcliffe of Martins Ludgate, testified upon oath,
That at a visitation held at Bow Church in London by Sir Nathaniel Brent, Vicar
general to this Archbishop of Canterbury, in whose right he then visited,
about Mar. 1636. the said Sir Nath. then and there in his public charge to the
Ministers, in his bearing used these words; Whereas diverse of you in your
Prayers before your Sermons, Use TO PRAY FOR THE NOTE.
QUEENS CONVERSION, YOU ARE TO DO SO NO MORE. Adding, that the Queen did not
doubt of her conversion; meaning, that she doubted not but that she was
already in the right way: We could produce other witnesses of this, but the
thing is so notorious, we shall need no more.

From this inhibition of his, we may certainly infer these conclusions:
First, that he who thus publicly inhibited other Ministers to pray for the
Queens conversion, would never questeonlesse himself endeavor by prayer,
conference, or intimacy with her, to convert her to our Religion: Secondly,
that he must verily believe her popish Religion to be the true Religion, and
ours the false; else both himself and all other our Ministers were bound, in
duty, conscience, most realously and constantly to pray in special manner to
God, for her Highness conversion from it, because Gods Word and christian
charity required it; the imminent danger that might and does acrew thereby to
her own soul in particular, to his Majesty, his royal Issue, and this whole
Church, State in general, exacts it; and the public Liturgy of our Church
(which this Prelate so much stickled for) both warrants and prescribes it; not
only in the special Collects for the King and Queen, the Letany, the Prayer
for the estate of the whole Church militant, but likewise in the Collect for
Good Friday, which runs thus:

Merciful God, who have made all men, and hate nothing that thou have made,
nor would the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and
live, have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, Insidels and Heretycks, and take from
them all ignorance, hardness of heart and contempt of thy Word, and so fetch
them home (blessed Lord) to thy stock, that they may be saved among the
remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one fold under one Shepherd, Jesus
Christ our Lord, etc. May, yea must we then pray for all Jews, Turks,
Heretics in general, that God would really convert and bring them to his
fold, though we have no special relation to them; and must our Ministers yet
be expressly prohibited to pray for the Queens conversion in particular, to whom
we have so near relation; the want of whose conversion has brought so many
mischiefs, wars on our Church and Kingdoms? Certainly this was an Act of the
greatest impiety that ever was committed by any christian Prelat, if he really
believed the Queen to live in a false Religion; and may justly brand him for an
Atheist, being diametrally contrary to Gods precept, 1 Timothy 3. 1, 2. I exhort
therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions and giving
of thanks be made FOR ALL MEN, for Kings and ALL THAT ARE IN AVTHORITY, that we
may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty: Therefore he
must needs believe her popish Religion to be the true, ours the false; else he
would have encouraged rather then prohibited Ministers to pray for her
conversion unto us and our Religion, whom it seems by this inhibition, he would
have converted to her and hers. Thirdly, this inhibition manifests, at the
least, that the Archbishop was a very cordial friend, servant, not only to
her Majesty's person but her popish Religion too, that he desired her
un-interrupted continuance in it, without the least opposition, not only by
way of dispute, but prayers too: Fourthly, this public prohibition in his own
Metropoliticall visitation, was of it self a great encouragement to, a strong
confirmation of her Majesty and all the popish party in their false Religion,
giving them great advantages to seduce others to it, as the true, because this
Injunction intimated it to be the true Religion, wherein they might safely
persevere.

But did this Prelate stop here only, openly to inhibit men thus to pray for
her Majesty's conversion? No verily; for both before and after this, he
imprisoned, questioned and censured some in the High Commission, for such
prayers. Master Bernard (as we proved formerly) was questioned, censured in the
High Commission as a grand offender for such a Prayer; Master Hugh Peter was
apprehended by a Pursevant, imprisoned for a time in the New-prison, silenced
here from his Ministry, and forced into Holland by the Archbishop, only for
praying at Sepulchers Church for the Queen, in these words, That as she came
into a Goshen of safety, so the light of Goshen might shine into her soul,
that she might not perish in the day of Christ; as himself and sundry others
will depose: But we shall insist only on two other instances in the High
Commission: The first is one Master William Jones, a Gloucestershire Minister,
who (as Master Prynne attested upon oath) Master Jones Case:
was brought into the High Commission, Anno 1636. and there prosecuted by the
Archbishops means, for not reading the Book of Sports, and for praying thus
for the Queen in his Pulpit to God; To show unto the Queen the light of
Goshen, and to bring her to his true worship: What worship? said the
Archbishop to him; as if her popish worship were Gods true worship.

Nor did he only persecute and trouble Ministers thus for praying for the
Queens illumination and conversion to Gods true worship; but likewise for
praying to God to keep the Prince from the infection of popery; witness the
case of one Master John How, Minister of Loughborough in the County of
Leicester, who on the Master John Howes Case.
sixth day of November 1634. (as was proved by the Register book of the High
Commission Court, there produced and read) was censured in that Court (where
the Archbishop was chief Judge and Dominus fac totum) attached, committed
during his Majesty's pleasure, suspended from the execution of his Ministry,
and every part thereof, fined five hundred pounds to the Kings use, ordered to
make a submission to the Court, and condemned in expenses and costs of suit,
only for praying but once in the Pulpit, That the young Prince might not be
brought up in Popery, whereof there was great cause to fear; for that (as was
alleged) these words did much derogate from his Majesty's known, approved,
Religious care in maintaining, propagating the true Religion here established,
professed within this Realm, and caused a causeless jealousy of the
education of the young Prince his Son in the popish Religion. When as he
only intended it of the danger of his education in respect of the Queen his
Mother, and those many seducing Priests, Papists then about her, who by many
policies, devices, endeavored, as much in them lay, to draw him to, and
educate him in the popish Religion: it being provided by the sixteenth Article
of the Kings marriage with France; That the children which shall by reason of
the said marriage be borne and live, shall be nursed and brought up NEAR THE
SAID LADY AND QUEEN, from the time of their birth, until they come to the age
OF FOURTEEN YEARS. In respect whereof there was great cause to fear the
Princes infection by, and seducement unto Popery, without Gods extraordinary
mercy; and therefore great need of our frequent prayers to prevent it.

His rigorous proceedings therefore against these Ministers on the one hand,
for praying for the Queens illumination with, and conversion to our Religion;
and his severe censuring them on the other hand, for praying, That the young
Prince might not be brought up in Popery, compared with his intimacy, favor
with the Queen, his readiness to serve her Majesty upon all special services
and commands, are a most pregnant evidence, not only of his conusance of, but
powerful concurring assistance in promoting this grand dangerous design, of
introducing Popery, and reconciling us to the Church of Rome.

And that which may further satisfy your Lordships and the world herein, is,
his extraordinary dignifying of Queen Mary's, his depressing King Edward the
sixth his Reign, in his very Preface to the new Statutes, compiled by him for
the University of Oxford; the Original whereof was produced, and this clause
read out of it: Edwardo sexto ad clavem sedente, novo sundatum est molimine,
etc. Prascribente Rege, and lenocinante NOVITATE, primo visum opus admitti,
etc. Paulo post potiente rerum Maria, sub Cardinalis Poli auspicijs idem
recruduit labor. Novae exinde data leges, sed pari cum prioribus angustia:
Interim tamen, inter incerta vacillans Statuta, viguit Academia, colebantur
studia, enituit Disciplina, and OPTANDA TEMPORUM FAELICITATE Tabularum defectum
resarcivit innatus Candor, and quicquid legibus deerat, Moribus suppletum est.
Decurrente temporum serie, and vitijs and legibus pariter laboratum est.

In which passage he brands King Edwards days of Reformation, with Flattering
Novelty; applauds Queen Mary's, under the government of Cardinal Pool, as
those wherein the University of Oxford did most eminently flourish in learning,
Discicipline, manners; and magnifies the desirable felicity of those times
(under another Qu. Mary of the same Religion) depressing Queen Elizabeth's
reign, and her successors, as more abounding with vice, and more defective of
good laws and government (in our Oxford University at least) then Queen
Mary's. This passage is not only seconded by Doctor Pocklingtons forecited
clause, who brands our Martyrs Here, (...).
suffering in Queen Mary's days, for Rebels, Traitors, Heretics; but by
Doctor Heylyn, in his Moderate Answer to Master Burton (penned and published by
the Archbishops command,) who thus disparageth King Edwards, applauds Queen
Mary's laws and actions: page 100. 101. 102. Now for King Edward the sixth,
the case stands thus: King Edward being a Minor, about nine years old, at his
first coming to the Crown, there was much heaving at the Church by some great
men that were about him, who purposed to enrich themselves with the spoils
thereof: For the effecting of which purpose, it was thought expedient to lessen
the number of those Bishops which were then in place, and to make all those
that were to come the more obedient to the Crown: Upon this ground, there
passed a Statute, 1. of this King, consisting of four principal Branches;
whereof the first cut off all Elections and Writs of Conge dislier, formerly in
use; the other did, if not take off, yet very much abate the edge of
Ecclesiastical censures: Then he recites the words of the Statute, and
concludes; which Act with every branch and clause thereof was afterward
repealed, 1. of Queen Mary, c. 2. and has stood so repealed to this very day,
etc.

This magnifying then of Queen Mary's days, and depressing King Edwards,
implies a grand design in this Arch-prelate, to rvevie those Marian times, as
happy and desirable.

From these few general, we shall next descend to some more particular
instances, to prove, that there was a serious design and endeavor of the Pope
and his Instruments in foreign parts, to reduce us back to Rome, that the
Archbishop had exact notice of it, and yet was so far from resisting, opposing
this their design, according to his place, trust, duty, that he complied with
them to the utmost of his wit and power therein. It cannot be expected, that in
a Plot of this nature, being a hidden work of darkness, and abstruce mystery
of iniquity carried on with all the artifice and cunning that Rome or Hell
could suggest; disguised, concealed under diverse charactaristicall Letters,
which we cannot as yet unriddle, though we have some of them in our custody;
sealed up under oaths, promises of secrecy, and acted by such Jesuiticall
spirits, as will rather obstinately die, then disclose the secrets of their
hellish conspiracies; which we cannot possibly manifest to the full, unless we
had been so happy as to have seized the Archbishops most secret papers (which
he conveyed away or burned before his closet, doors were sealed up) and the
Popes Nuncioes Cabinet, or might have liberty to search the Popes own Closet,
or Cardi. Barbarino his secret papers and the private intelligences of the
Roman Conclave; yet we presume we shall produce so many clear demonstrations,
and circumstantial proofs, as shall abundantly satisfy your Lordships
judgments, consciences, and the world, both of the reality of this plot, and
the Archbishops guiltinesle in concurring in it: We know it is usual for
Juries to convict, for Judges to condemn and execute Traitors, felons as well
upon violent presumptions and circumstances, as upon eye witnesses and
punctual testimonies of the facts for which they are indicted: and we doubt
not but our evidence in this kind will be so clear, as it will surmount a
violent presumption, yea amount to an infallible demonstration, conviction of
his guiltiness, if not severally considered, yet at least conjoined.

The first particular Evidence to prove a design at Rome, to reduce us to our
ancient vassalage under it, is a very notable paper printed at Rome, Superiorum
permissu (in two large folio sheets pasted together) An. 1636. In the first and
uppermost sheet, there is a coper Piece, cut with Anticks, wherein there are
two Scutchions; the one hanging just in the midst near the upper end of the
sheet, wherein the Popes and Cardinal Barbarino (his Nephewe's) Arms are
engraven; the other hanging a little lower then the former, on the right side
of the sheet, containing the King of Englands Arms: The Author of this paper
was an English Friar, who styles himself, Frater Franciscus a Saucta Maria,
Sacra Theologiae Lector Generalis, Primario Jubilato; ac Provinciae Sanctae
Elizabethae Custos: The substance of it he styles, Conclusiones Theologiae;
which are thirteen in number; but that which is most observable therein, is
this dedication of it to Cardinal Barbarino.

By this paper it is evident, that this Cardinal was publikly deputed and
styled, even in print at Rome, The most vigilant Protector of England,
Scotland, and of the Seraphicall Religion there; the greatest Patron of great
Britain, designed to this charge, for this very purpose, to See Romes

reduce it again to the bosom of the Roman Church, the only use, end of this
his office and Title. Of this design this Archbishop had most certain
intelligence from Master Middleton, Chaplain to the English Agent at Venice,
to whom this paper was sent from Rome, and by him conveyed to the Archbishop,
who thus indorsed it with his own handwriting. 1636. Fra. Ludovici a Sa. Maria
Angli Theses, etc. and reserved it in his Study at Lambeth, where Master Prynne
attested it was seized. This Fryar's right name (as appears by a paper under
See A Necessary Introduction, p. 145.
Secretary Windcbanks own hand) was Kerton, alias Morton, who soon after
repaired into England, to help reduce it; Where he lived so wickedly, in
drawing Maids, Women and others to sin carnally, and committed such horrible
acts in prosecuting his lusts, that be was enforced to return to Paris in
France: Secretary Windebank giving his son Tom, special instructions (when he
went over thither to negotiate the Palsgraves release) To advise those of his
Order there, to prevent his return bither, because he would be assuredly
publicly punished according to the laws, to the great seandall of his
Religion: which manifests a correspondency in Windebank and his son (this
Archbishops creatures) even with the Franciscan Friars, beyond the seas, and a
care in them to prevent this Friars, with his Religious public disgrace and
scandal.

The second Evidence (which backs the former) is, a discovery of a most
desperate See Romes Masterpiece.
Plot of this Cardinal Barbarim, and his four sorts of English and Scottish
Jesuits, II.
residing in and about Drury Lane and Long-acre, where they had built a
College; and had their constant meeting; of which society, this Cardinal was
the immadiate head next under the Pope, to whom they bad their immediate
addresses, and directed their weekly intelligence: The plot was, to subvert the
Protestant Religion, set up Popery, and reconcile us unto Rome, by engaging the
King in a bloody war against the Scots, and working him to their party; and
in case they could not do it, then to give him a poisoned sigge (as his Father
was poisoned) and seize upon the Prince, whom they would educate in the Romish
Religion. This Plot was discovered, merely out of remorse of conscionce, by one
who was a chief actor in it, sent from Rome to assist Con, the Popes Lagat in
his Negotiations in England, to one Andreas ab Habernfield (Physician to the
Queen of Bohemia) who disclosed it to Sir William Boswell, the Kings leager at
the Hague, who from thence by sundry Letters, revealed it to this Archbishop,
in whose chamber at the Tower, the whole plot and original Letters concerning
it, were seized on by Master Prynne (who attested and produced them at the
Bar) and published them at large to the world by order of Parliament, in
Romes Masterpiece, where the principal Agents in this plot, and their
proceedings therein are particularly related many of them (as Secr Windebank,
the Earl and Countess of Arundell, Mr. Porter of the Bedchamber, and Sir
Toby Matthew) being the Archbishops intimate friends and familiars. Of this
Plot the Archbishop took such special notice, that he acquainted the King
himself with it, as appears by his own Letter to the King, and his Majesty's
Answer to it, with his own royal hand to it in the margin, sent from York to
Lambeth: Yet for all this, he was so far from crossing this their Jesuiticall
design, that he confederated and joined with the Jesuits and popish party in
fomenting, maintaining the war See A Necessary Introduction to the Archbishops
Trial, p. 170. to 200.
against the Scots, and revived it when it was ceased, by persuading the King
to break the first pacification, and denounce a second war against them.

The third particular we shall produce, to prove an endeavor of the Pope and
Cardinal Barbarino at Rome, to reconcile, reduce us back to them, and that
this Archbishop had notice of it, is a Letter (found in his Study, attested by
Master Prynne) written to him by one Master John Greaves, from Ligonne, March
3. 1639. indorsed with his own hand thus, Rece. Mar. 27. 1640. Fastidius
printed at Rome: Wherein Master Greaves has this clause: I humbly beseech your
Grace to pardon my presumptions, and this other Information which I shall give
your Grace: They have printed at Rome a Book of Fastidius, a Britain Bishop,
De Vita Christiana, WHICH THE CARDINAL FRANCISCO BARBARINO INTENDS NOTE.
TO DEDICATE TO HIS SACRED MAJESTY; a Book of singulan devotion and piety, and
of great Antiquity; the Author being a Bishop in England, about three hundred
years after our Savior. Lucas Holstenius, a very learned man, has the care
often the Edition, but has not I think, as yet finished the Annotations upon
it: For the Text, he and I compared the Manuscript (which was also very
ancient) with the printed Copy, and I find it exactly to agree.

Now what other meaning could there be for this Cardinal to print this book at
Rome, to dedicate it publicly to our King, and to use Master Greaves himself
in comparing the printed Copy with the Manuscript, but to insinuate himself
into the Kings affections, thereby to reduce both him and his Dominions unto
the bosom of the Church of Rome, which the forementioned discovery of this and
the Jesuits Plot, by Andreas ab Habernfield, more largely demonstrates? this
Cardinal sending over sundry Statues, Pictures, Antiquities, and other
vanities from Rome to his Majesty, to incline him to the Roman party, as we
have See Romes Masterpiece, p. 16. and A necessary Introduction, etc. p. 146.
elsewhere manifested,

The fourth particular Evidence we shall insist on, which adds luster and
vigor to all the former, is the Book entitled Deus, Natura and Gratia: Vbi ad

This Book was dedicated to our King Charles, with a Dedicatory Epistle, to

manifests: Periculosum nobis admodum, atque etiam miserabile est, tot nunc

reduce both our King, Church, and the Articles of our Religion, which i^

alteram, qua potestatem dat homini resistendi peccatis; quae potestas est ipsa
charitas infusa in cordibus nostris, per illam secundam actionem Dei, quae est
ipsissima doctrina nostra. HIC IGITUR PAX.

So in the point of falling from grace, in his 30. Problem, An Justus potest
finaliter NOTE.
peccare? page 209, 210, 211. he brings in our 16. Article, and the Book of
Homilies, just as they are cited by Mountague in his Appeal, to prove, that a
justified person may fall from grace, and sin finally; concluding thus, Et
certe omnes confessiones aliarum Nationum fere conspirant, cum Ovarello in
Collatione Hamptoniensi; Montacutio in sua Appellatione, Causabono, in Epistola
ad Bertium, cum reliquis omnibus melioris Notae.

In his 36. Problem, concerning Supererogation, misconstruing the fourteenth
Article of our Church, point blank against the words and sense, he concludes
thus, page 253. Interim a nobis stant Confessio Anglicana, and ejus Genuini
sequaces, HIC ERGO PAX, and utinam Pax illa, non quam mundus dat, quae singulis
horis novitate opinionum violatur, sed quam Christus suis Apostolis legavit,
etc.

In the 37. Problem concerning the Invocation of Saints, and its lawfulness,
he writes thus, page 260. Montacutius de hoc subjecto agens, momentis rationum,
and monamentis authoritatum oppressus, a veritate stat, and alij frequenter: De
re agitur non solum inter nos concordia, sed ni fallor inter celebriores ex
adversarijs, ut posted melius patebit: Which he prosecutes, page 273, 274, 275,
276. where he records, Quoad Reliquiarum and Crucis Christi Venerationem,
profitetur D. Andreros, in Respons. ad cap. 18. Peronij. Causabonus in
Exercitationibus Baronij, ad An. 34. Cultus etiam seu venerationem quandam

inclinationem religiosam ad Imaginem, astruit post alios D. Montacutius, in
Responsoria ad Heighamum, and in Appello Caesarem cap. 22. Then he concludes,
page 277. Hic igitur cum Confessione Anglica erit PAX OMNIMODE, modo non ex
affectu partium, sed veritatis, omnia pro dignitate perpendent. Closing up his
Deus Natura and Gratia thus; In quibus si omnia recte perpenderit Lector
eruditus, MAGNUM FUTURAE READUNATIONIS SPECIMEN NOTE.
PERSPICIET.

After this, page 278. he paraphraseth all our 39. Articles, endeavoring to
reconcile them, and us in them, to the Tenets of the Church of Rome: page 316,
317. on the 31. Article (against the sacrifice of the Mass) he glosseth thus;
Nulla prorsus hic erit difficultas cum doctioribus Protestantibus, qui plane
hoc totum fatentur: Vt videre est apud D. Andreros, contra Perronium, and D.
Montacutium, contra Heigham and alios frequenter: Denique nec hic Articulus,

restrictivo a Patribus usurpato, incruentum, quod non negant. And page 334. Et
eo plus quo video celebriores Protestantium Doctores Sacerdotes and sacrificia
agnoscere. In the 25. Article concerning Homilies, page 321. he thus shakes off
our Homilies, in our Bishops own terms: Nec tenentur Protestants, ob haec
verba in Articulo statim in singula verba vel sententias Homiliarum jurare,
etc. Prudenter igitur quae sanam Doctrinam sapiunt, populo legenda; alia,
neglectui habenda.

Pape 332. in the 37. Article, concerning the power of the civil Magistrates,
against the Popes Jurisdiction, he writes thus; D. Montacutius, contr. Heighum
and alij eorum doctissimi, quibuscum de hoc egi, nullam utique Jurisdictionem
spiritualem Regibus nosiris concedunt, sed gubernium civil and temporale,
indirecte and per accidens, ob pacem Reipubl. in personas and causas

subjiciebatur, Regum esse omnes regere; quod intelligi debet civiliter, non
spiritualiter, modo a nobis explicato. After which, page 334, 335, 336. he
handles these three Questions: First, Whether any have power to withdraw
themselves from subjection and obedience to the Sea and Church of Rome upon any
occasion? Secondly, Whether we of this Realm had sufficient causes to do it?
Thirdly, Whether we did well in it, and did not exceed measure therein? And he
resolves the two latter thus.

Vtraque quaestio si^e dubio, gravissima est, and maximum meretur discussionem.
Quod si causa sufficiens non fuerit; vel terminus justae substractionis

From all these remarkable passages of this book, it is most evident, that it
was purposely penned, published, dedicated and presented to the King, to
reconcile him, and reunite our Church and Articles to the Church of Rome; that
this union and accommodation was already accomplished by Bishop Andrews,
Bishop Muntague, and others of our most eminent moderate Divines, in many
points of greatest moment, and would soon be effected in the residue, by a
public Assembly or Synod of our Prelates and divines, if no Puritans were
intermixed among them.

But you will object; What is all this, or this Book to the Archbishop? Did he
know any thing of this Plot, Book, or had any hand therein? Yes verily: First,
he know of this book before it was published, Doctor Lindsey his great
favorite (whom he advanced to a Deanary and two Bishoprics, as we have
formerly proved) acquainting him therewith, and bringing the Author of it to
his Grace, who had recourse to him several times after: This we shall prove by
a paper written with his own hand, by way of extenuation of this charge even
since his commitment to the Tower, and there sei^ed on by Master Pryme, which
was read as follows.

MY Intelligence with the Pope by S. Clara. I never saw that Franciscan Friar
in my life, to the utmost of my memory, above four times, or five at most.

He was first brought to me by Doctor Linsey, it was when he was setting out
his book about the Articles of the Church of England; and I then told Doctor
Linsey, I did fear he NOTE.
would never expound them, so as the Church of England might have cause to
thank him for it.

He never came to me after, till he was almost ready to print another book, to
prove, that Episcopacy was authorized in the Church by divine right; and these
was after this unhappy stirs began: His desire was, to have this book printed
here; but at his several addresses to me for this, I still gave him this
answer: That I did not like the way which the Church of Rome went concerning
Episcopacy: And howsoever, I would never give way that any such book from the
pen of any Romanist, should be printed here: And the Bishops of England are
very well able to defend their own cause and calling, without calling in any
aid from Rome, and would so do when they saw cause; And this is all the
conference that ever I had with him.

This excuse of his (though partial) acknowledges, that he was acquainted
with the book and Author before its printing, and that Doctor Linsey his
favorite, was a great promoter of it, privy to the plot of Reconciliation, and
very intimate with the Friar that compiled it.

Secondly, when the book was printed, this Author presented not only the King,
but Archbishop himself with one of them, bound up in Vellam, with the Kings
Arms on the cover, and blew silk strings, which he thus endorsed with his own
hand, Fron. a Sancta Clara, Problemata 37. Expositio paraphrastica Confessionis
Anglicanae: Which book he reserved in his Study at Lambeth, where Master Prynne
seized, and produced it at the Bar.

Thirdly, he not only received, but permitted it to be publicly sold and
dispersed amongst us, without any seizure or restaint, and to be twice or
thrice reprinted in London, notwithstanding many exceptions and complaints
against it, when as he most strictly suppressed orthodox books.

Fourthly, if Friar Saint Giles were the true Author of this book (as he was
reputed by the Friars in foreign parts) the Archbishop not only knew, but
maintained him in the University of Oxford (to seduce, poison the Scholars
there, and reconcile them to Rome) and gave him an annual pension of one
hundred Marks; the blame of which action for his own excuse, he would
transfer upon the King (without any proof at all, but only this
surreptitious warrant, without any date at all, writ with his own hand, not by
any Secretary of State) which will no ways extenuate, but aggravate his crime,
the warrant being no doubt fraudulently procured, to serve a turn at a dead
lift, since his troubles.

Charles R.

CAnterbury, Master Saint Giles by serving Us and this State, has lost all his
hopes in France, and desires to spend his time here at his private studies; I
would have you think upon some way for his maintenance, and to place him in
Oxford, that he may have use of that Library, which he much desires: And he may
so order it, that his profession in Religion may do no harm.

What the service was that this Friar had done for the King and State, for
which he lost his hopes in France, we could never learn, unless it were the
penning and publishing of this book, which some Jesuits and their faction
only, disliked. What it was that this Archbishop did for him (upon this
warrant, as he pretends) is thus expressed, in a paper written with his own
hand, by way of excuse, seized by Master Prynne in the Tower, and by him
produced at the Lords Bar, where it was read as follows.

MAster Saint Giles was a man well reputed of in France, and placed about the
Queens Majesty, at her Majesty's first coming hither: After upon some services
(and those in a very fair way) done to this State, he lost ground in France,
and when some other French men were sent away from the Queens service, he durst
not go thither, but chose to live here in a very low condition for safeties
sake, rather then adventure thither. All this while the man was unknown to me,
but coming one day to wait upon his Majesty at Saint Jamses, his Majesty was
pleased to ask me, Whether I knew Master Saint Giles? I answered, I did not:
Hereupon his Majesty took occasion to tell me the condition of the man, and
his wants, and withal, told me which way he conceived some relief might be
given to his necessities; and prescribed me a way how to order it, that he
might receive for his maintenance NOTE:
a hundred Marks a year. This in obedience to his Majesty, I did: (and I have
his Majesty's Warrant for it) But I never allowed or gave him one penny of my
own.

Not long after this, partly that the poor man, being a stranger, might live
the cheaper, and partly that he might have the use of the public Library,
resolving (as he pretended) to follow metaphisicall learning, and not engage
himself in the controversies of the times; His Majesty moved me again, that
he might live in Oxford, and in some College or Hall there. In this I humbly
besought his Majesty to pardon me, because it would be dangerous to the youth
NOTE.
bred in that College, and scandalous to his Majesty, this Church, and the
University, and bring danger upon my self, being Chancellor there: After much
importunity used by me, his Majesty was gnaciously pleased to be satisfied,
that he should not be admitted to live in any College or Hall among the
Students, but required me not to hinder his going to Oxford, and the making use
of the Library, provided, that he kept no company with any young Scholars;
that he lived privately in some Towne-house; and that he did not presume to
exercise his Priestly function, or do any thing against the laws: This he
undertook to perform, and I could never find (by any the spies which I put
upon him) that he brake this in any particular, but lived there without offense
given to any.

In all times of his recourse to me for his pension, I never spent one hour
with him, nor had I ever any discourse with him at all, but once only, and
that was about a dangerous opinion of Pompanatius,: At that time he told me, he
had a desire to labor in that Argument, and to confute him: I told him, I
could not approve any meddling with that question in these times, for that I
thought few would be able to understand the subtilty of that dispute, and that
the stirring of it in these times would do a great deal of mischief; and
this is all that ever past between him and me all my life.

This Saint Giles by this Prelates means, continued in the University of Oxford
sundry years, and had the use of the Libraries there, where he did much
mischief; Master Broad of Oxford deposed, that Saint Giles continued in Oxford
four years or more, that he was a very dangerous insinuating person, that
Doctor Turner, Doctor Johnson, and others of the University, usually resorted
to him, and familiarly conversed with him, though he were there known to be a
popish Priest; that when Master Prynne, Master Burton, and Doctor Bastwick
suffered at Westminster on the Pillory, this Saint Giles speaking of their
sufferings, told this Deponent (in whose Kinswomans house he lay) that though
the Archbishop and other Bishops WERE CORDIAL FOR THE NOTE.
ROMISH RELIGION, yet he doubted their cruelty would rather hurt then further
their cause, because it lost them much in the affections of the people. Now
what a capital offense it was for this Archprelat to harbor such a dangerous
seducing Priest, (reputed one of the greatest Scholars among the Papists) in
this famous University to seduce the Students there (and as the Queens
Apothecary, a great Papist, reported, of purpose to instruct the Doctors there,
as Master Godfrey, a quondam converted popish Priest averred) and to lay the
blame of it thus wholly on his Majesty to excuse himself, we humbly submit to
your Lordships consideration.

To prove this Saint Giles (now Priest to the Venetian Ambassador, resident in
London, where he does much mischief) the Author of Deus, Natura and Gratia,
etc. what repute it had among Papists abroad, how the Archbishops Agents
applauded, made use of it, and certified him from time to time, how it was
entertained by Papists in foreign parts, what they thought of him and other
great persons in England, and how they stood affected to popery, we shall
produce two Original Letters from Master William Middleton (then Chaplain to
the Lord Fielding, Ambassador at Venice) sent thence to the Archbishop, in
whose Study they were found by Master Prynne, endorsed by Master Dell and the
Archbishop: the first of them bears date in September. 1635. and was received by
the Archbishop October. 9. wherein he thus writes:

Right Honorable and most Reverend,
I Thought it no little happiness, I had performed that duty of writing it
pleased your grace ^o lay upon me, etc. While I was writing, there came a
Franciscan Friar to my self, his business was this; A mind, he told me, he
had, to leave these parts, and with them the Religion here in use; that I
should do him a great favor, would I procure him a passage to England, either
by Sea or Land; that there he had formerly been, and was in love with place,
persons and Church, as there ordered and established. Upon which words, how I
dealt with him, I will relate to your Grace: I asked him how long he had been
of this resolution, and what moved him to it? He answered, the time since he
had taken this resolution, was two months and a half, the motives the same
that first moved us at the first to leave Rome. I answered him, it could not be
(resolve I did, that I might the more deeply dive into the sincerity of his
intentions, as strongly as my poor ability would suffer me, to plead for Rome)
because she had reformed Missals, Monasteries, sundry Corruptions in conferring
of Orders and Benefices; that all had not received the Council of Trent; that
of those who had, some did mitigate harder expressions, and were upon courses
of Conciliation of both hearts, as appeared by a Book of Franc. a Sancta Clara,
etc. I fell then to question him, Whether and when he had been at Rome? He told
me, in June and July last: I asked him how the affairs NOTE.
went there? He told me, their opinion of us was, that his Majesty was
favorable to the Catholics, that some great ones about him were so too, or in
heart were: The Archbishop himself.
ONE HE NAMED, concerning whom as at home, so abroad (as of old, of the best of
men) there was much murmuring among the people; for some said he was a good
man, others said, nay, he deceives the people: Now if some might interpose
their judgments, they would pronounce, a good man he is, because he deceives
both here and there, but both to their own good: Concerning the Friars, he told
me, some were very good, but most otherwise, and that in excess, especially
for Sins of uncleanness, which generally reign in Italy. Three several
times I had discourse with him; in the last of which, falling into discourse of
Fran. a Sancta Clara, he told me, he was HOMO NEQUISSIMUS, by whose means
yearly, there was sent to the Catholics in Flanders, ten thousand pounds: The
Author of that Book, which goes under his name, was Father Giles, PADRE
AEGIDIO, who lives at the Venetian Ambassadors, etc. Since I came to Venice, I
have procured the acquaintance of Padre Fulgentio, who is, Teologo de Stato,
called by the College to Counsel, when there is any business between them
and the Pope, etc. I sent to him Fran. a Sancta Clara; after discoursing with
him; he told me, it was impossible to concile Trent and England, and yet men
sooner then Articles: He likt his intention in the general, his judgment and
temper in most of the Problems before he came to the Articles. There is, as I
am informed by a discreet Gentleman at Florence, a Jesuit lately returned from
England to Rome, who pretends to have made a strict discovery of the state of
England, as it stands for Religion; how King is disposed, how Queen, what
Lords are of the Puritan faction, what not; but by name, his Honor of Dorset
and Pembroke are strong for Precisians: He says, That the Puritanes are shrewd
fellows, but those that are counted good Protestants, are fair conditioned
honest men, and think they may be saved in any Religion. I am promished the the
Relation written; if it come to my hands, and there be any thing in it worthy
your Graces view, I shall hereafter humbly present it to you, as now my self.

Your Graces most humble and most obedient servant, WILL. MIDLETON.


The second Letter is dated December 21. 1635. in which there are these
observable clauses:

Right Honorable and most Reverend, etc.
WHen I was in France, I fell acquainted with one Father Talbot a Jesuit, with
whom I had many discourses, but among others this, about the Book of Franciscus
a Sancta Clara. I asked his judgment of it, and the rest of the Catholics: He
answered, it relisht not with them: I fell presently into a comendation partly
of the book, but more of the intention of him who writ it: He seconded what I
said; but withal told me, there was a certain Consultation held, what they
should do with it; some, exrema suadebant, and cried ad ignem; but himself
talking with the Popes Nuncio at Paris, thought the best course was, to let it
dye of it self; to which the Nuncio a very moderate man (so he told him) was
very inclinable: From which (I did gather) that (though they did pretend a
dislike) the Book was not disallowed by them above; which collection of mine
then, is now confirmed; for this very day I received a Letter dated from Rome,
December. 11. and it is in these words: Father Francis his book upon the
exposition of the Articles, contrary to what I have told you, is licensed here
in Rome, and I have it. Sent it was from one NOTE.
Master House, lodging in the house of one Master Pitton, a kind of Agent from
the English Priests: In Rome there is great talk of an English Cardinal; and
the man, who is already Roman Catholic, must be the man, Master Mountague.
Your Lordship I know will smile, if not at this, yet at that I shall now write:
A Catholic discoursing with me, let a word fall, and this it was: That within
this twelve month the Pope did wish, that his Sacred Majesty of England were,
as once, his trusty Son, for then he would not be so used as he is, either by
French or Spaniard. The same party did not ask the question but only thus; I
wonder whether my Lord of NOTE.
Canterbury have any hand in sending S. Major Bret to Rome? I answered,
because, I saw he was fishing, Surely no; because as you know it is written, he
comes from the Queen, and in her name. ROME IS VERY KIND TO OUR ENGLISH
GENTLEMEN; I humbly entreat your Graces pardon, if in a desire to let nothing,
I hear, escape your knowledge; I most lowly offer unto you such things as will
make you lose so much time, as you shall read the Letter: But though your
Lordship lose a little time, yet not me, I beseech you, lose that good opinion
which I hope you have conceived of

Your Graces most really devoted and obedient servant, WILL. MIDLETON.
December 21. 1635.

By these Letters it is most apparent, that Saint Giles was the Author of
Sancta Clara's book; that though the Jesuits seemed to dislike it, yet it was
at last authorized and printed at Rome, where they had a good opinion not only
of the Kings favor to the Roman Catholics, but of the Archbishops inclination
to their party, their Religion, and conceived he had a hand in sending Major
Bret to Rome, to negotiate with the Popes etc. This last Letter is thus
endorsed with Mr. Dels hand, Recep. Jan. 10. 1635. from Venice, from Master
Midleton, The allowance of Saint Clara his Book at Rome: to which the
Archbishop himself adds with his own hand; This is not so; (therefore it
seems he had better intelligence here from Rome, then Master Midleton had at
Venice;) The English Cardinal, The English Agent.

How far this Book was approved, countenanced here in England by the King and
Archbishop, will appear by these Instructions under Secretary Windebankes own
hand, to his Son, when he was at Paris to solicit the Palsgraves
enlargement, found among his sequestered papers, and attested by Master Pryme.

IF you hear Fa. Francis his Book, or person touched, let them know, that we
understand assuredly that it proceeds from the Jesuits, (most likely also by
this last Letter of Mr. Midleton to the Archbishop) who employ others in it, as
they did against Father Leanded till it cost him his life; and if that upon
their informations, they proceed against such persons, who THOUGH IN ALL THINGS
CATHOLIC yet are more discrect and temperate, and not intermedling in matters
of State, THE KING WILL BE NOTE.
MUCH OFFENDED.

Thus much for this Book of Sancta Clara, and the Author of it.

The fifth Evidence we shall pitch upon, to prove a design to reconcile and
reduce us back to Rome, is the Popes and his Agents promises, tenders of
Cardinals Caps and Places to some prime English men, and to this Archbishop
himself in particular; the end whereof could be no other, but to enthrall us
again to the superstitious jurisdiction of the Papal See.

The first proffer we find of a Cardinals Cap made to any English Prelat since
the Reformation, was to this Archbishop, who thus records the time and manner
thereof with his own hand in his Diary.

Aug. 4. 1633. Sunday, news came to Court of the Lord Archbishop of
Canterburies death, and the King RESOLVED PRESENTLY to give it me, which he
did. Aug. 6. That very morning at Greenwich, there came one to me seriously,
and THAT AVOWED NOTE.
ABILITY TO PERFORM IT, AND OFFERED ME TO BE A CARDINAL. I went presently to
the King and acquainted him both with the thing and person.

It is very considerable that Master Anthony Mildmay deposed, that Con the
Popes Nuncio, told him at Rome before Archbishop Abbots death, that Bishop Laud
should succeed him, and that he would be more favorable to the Catholics then
Abbot. By which it appears, that Bishop Laud was long before Abbots death
designed to the place, if not at the solicitation, yet at least by the
approbation of the Roman party: No sooner comes news to Court of Archbishop
Abbots death, but the King presently resolves, that Bishop Laud should succeed
him; and no sooner is this known at Court, but that very morning (as himself
records) he is thus seriously offered to be a Cardinal, by one who avowed
ability to perform it; and that at Greenwich in the Kings own Court. Who it
was that made this offer, were worth the discovery, but this mystery he
couceales; The Plot against the King, discovered to him by Habernfield,
informs us, See Romes Masterpiece, page, 116.
That Con the Popes Nuncio had a command to offer A CARDINALS CAP TO THE
ARCHBISHOP, in the name of the Pope of Rome, and that he should allure him
also, with greater promises; but this first offer was before Con's arrival
here. Were the person an English Subject, of what rank soever, this proffer of
his to to revive this popish dignity of a Cardinal among us, and to receive it
from the Popes exploded forraigue power (which drew Master Fox his Acts and
Monuments, old Editum, p. 741. Sir Ed: Cooks 4. Inst. p. 89, 90, etc.
Cardinal Woolsey into a Praemunire, if not under the guilt of high Treason,
though this honor was procured him, not only by King Henry the 8th his assent,
but solicitation) deserved the severest exemplary punishment, especially since
it tended to engage the Primate and Metropolitan of all England,, most obliged
by his place and office, against all Popish power, offices, superstitious
doctrines, to submit unto them, and become the Popes sworn vassal: If the
Popes own Nuncio [Panzani] which is probable, or any other foreign Agent,
the affront had been so great both to the Archbishops person, place (had he
been cordial to our Church, our Religion, being both a Privy Counselor, the
Kings grand favorite, and he who steard our Churches helm) to the honor of our
Church, Religion, of the King himself and his Royal Court, that it could not
patiently be put up or pretermitted without some eminent satisfaction: But be
the person one or other, certain it is, he was never once questioned or
molested by the Archbishop for this proffer, who took it so well at the parties
hands, or rejected it so coldly, that on the 17. day of the same Month, he had
a second serious offer made to him of the selfsame dignity, (most probably by
the same person) which himself thus Registreth in his Diary.

Aug. 17. 1633. Saturday, I had A SERIOUS OFFER MADE ME AGAIN NOTE:
TO BE A CARDINAL: I was then from Court, but so soon as I came thither,
(which was August 21) I acquainted his Majesty with it: But my answer again
was, that somewhat dwelt within me, which would not suffer that, till Rome were
other then it is.

What it was that dwelt within him (which made him not absolutely, but for the
present only, to refuse this offer till Rome was other then it is) we may learn
from Sir Hen. Mildmay's, Mr. Anth. Mildmay's, and Mr. Challoner's depositions
forementioned, Here p. 412. to 416.
and his own Reply to Fisher, page 171. to wit, an ambitious, Papal spirit;
he would (like his worthy Predecessor, Saint Guil. Malms. de Gestis Pont. Ang.
l. 1. p. 223 Eadmerus, Cap grave. Antiquitates Ecclesiae Brit. and Godwin in
his Life.
Anselme, so he styles him) be both in Title and Jurisdiction, Papa alterius
Orbis, Pope of our British world, and Universal Patriarch of all the Churches
within his Majesty's Realms and Dominions; which Rome, as it then was, and the
Jesuiticall party there (as these witnesses have deposed) distiked and would
not suffer; and for this cause only he refused this dignity, which would have
more enthralled him to the Popes and Romes jurisdiction (not to their Religion)
then his ambitious spirit could well brook.

This double, serious proffer of a Romish Cardinalship to the Archbishop, is an
infallible Argument; First, that the Pope and his Conclave at Rome, had an
extraordinary good opinion of his favor, his good affection to Popery and
their Antichristian Church, else they would not have proffered him such a
dignity, incompatible to any Protestant English Prelat: Secondly, that they
deemed him the aptest, activest Instrument to reconcile and reunite us to Rome
of all other, in respect of his favor at Court, power with the King, and
inclination to Popery (as Sir Henry Mildmay, Master Anthony Mildmay, Master
Challoner have attested;) therefore they would honor him with a Cardinals Hat,
to the end, that as his Predecessor Cardinal Poole, Archbishop of Canterbury
(the last English Cardinal of any of our Prelates) reconciled our revolted
Kingdom to Rome in Queen Mary's days, as appears at large by the Statute of
1. and 2. Phil. and Mary, chapter 8. So he invested with the same Papal dignity,
and fitting in the self-same See, might once more as easily reduce us to the
bosom of the Roman Church in the days of this Queen Mary, (as Popish as the
former) as he did then.

As this Archbishop, so Master Walter Mountague, not long after, had good hopes
given him at Rome to be made a Cardinal, as the Archbishop himself was informed
by Mr. Middleton's forecited Letter; which dignity he should have lately
received thence, had he not been imprisoned (if Sir See A Necessary
Introduction, etc. p. 143. 253, 254
Kenelme Digbies Letter may be credited) to help on this work of our reducement
to Rome; yea, the discovery of See Romes Masterpiece, p. 24.
Andreas ab Habernfield to the Archbishop, informs both him and ns, That one
of Endimion Porters Sons of the Bedchamber (now in arms against the
Parliament) was promised a Cardinals Hat, if this design succeeded well, and
that Sir Kenelme Digby, Master Walter Mountague, and other active Instruments
who promoted that design among us, attended the sixteen Cardinals Caps that
were vacant, which were therefore detained vacant for some years, to impose a
vain hope on those who expected them; And Master Widford in his Letters from
Rome to Secretary Windebank November. 10. 1640. informs him, that Master
Sommerset and Master Brudenell were come to Florence, aiming at our English
Cardinals Caps, which then, by reason of the Popes Catarre, were like to be
disposed of. All which particulars are a most clear demonstration of the Pope
and his Conclaves endeavors to reduce us back to Rome, and of this Archbishops
privity to, if not assistance in it.

The sixth Evidence we shall mention to prove the Archbishops, not only
intelligence of, but compliance with the Popes and his Instruments Plots and
proceedings to usher in Popery, and reduce our Kingdoms to the Antichristian
Religion and Church of Rome, is his conusance and furtherance of this their
design in Ireland, which we shall thus demonstrate. The House of Commons June
11. 1628. presented a Remonstrance to the King, concerning the extraordinary
increase and growth of Popery, of Papists both in England and Ireland, and the
extraordinary favor which they found from some great persons in his Court;
wherein they had this notable clause concerning Ireland.

IT does not a little also increase our dangers and fears this way, to
understand the miserable condition of your Kingdom of Ireland, where without
control the Popish Religion is openly professed and practiced in every part
thereof, Popish jurisdiction being generally exercised NOTE.
and avowed; Monasteries, Nunneries, and other superstitious houses newly
erected, re-edified, replenished with men and women of several Orders, and in
a plentiful manner maintained in Dublin, and most of the great Towns, and
diverse other places of that Kingdom: Which (of what ill consequence it may
prove) if not seasonably repressed, we leave to your Majesty's wisdom to
judge: But most heartily beseech you (as we assure our selves you NOTE.
do) to lay the serious consideration thereof to your Royal, pious heart, AND
THAT SOME TIMELY COURSE MAY BE TAKEN FOR REDRESS HEREIN.

Had this pious, prudent, timely advice been then harkned to, and followed to
purpose, it might no doubt (through Gods concurrence with it) have prevented
that horrid Rebellion, those bloody Massacres of some hundred thousands of poor
English Protestants in, and devastation of that distressed Kingdom, which have
broken forth and been perpetrated there of late, almost to the utter
extirpation of the English and Irish Protestants, the ruin of that Kingdom,
and infinite loss, yea eminent danger of this our Realm to boot.

But this Popish Prelate, though he then certainly knew this Remonstrance to be
most true, out of an inveterate hatred to the Parliament, and a desire to
promote the Catholics designs there, instead of persuading his Majesty to
hearken to this true information and wholesome advice of his faithful Commons,
drew up a most pernicious malepert Answer, with his own hand, in his Majesty's
name, against this Remonstrance, which he presented to his Majesty; wherein he
incensed him against the Commons, charging them not only with misinforming,
but traducing his Majesty's government by this clause concerning Ireland, in
this dishonorable language, produced and read under his own hand out of the
Original draught, attested by Master Prynne.

FOR Ireland, We think in case of Religion, it is not worse then Queen Elizabeth
left it, and for other affairs, it is as good as we found it, nay perhaps
better; and We take it a great disparagement of Our government that it should
be urged, that new Monasteries, Nunneries, and other superstitious houses are
erected and replenished in Dublin, and other great NOTE.
Towns in this Our Kingdom; for we assure Our Selves, Our Deputy and Our
Counsel there will not suffer God and Our government so to be dishonored, but
We should have had some account of it from them; and We may not endure thus to
have Our good People misled with shows.

Which in plain terms is but a giving the House of Commons the Lie, and a
slandering of them as false Informers, both to the King and people: By which
wicked practice, their Remonstrance was rejected as a slanderous Libell, and
their Council not pursued; the doleful effects whereof, we now experimentally
feel and rue. That this Prelate when he made this Answer, certainly knew of
the grand increase of the Papists in Ireland, and that they had then upon the
matter obtained a public toleration, will appear by a paper found in his
Study, (produced at the Bar,) thus endorsed with this Archbishops own hand,
1626. The Bishops of Ireland about a Toleration feared.

The Judgment of the Archbishops and Bishops of Ireland, concerning
toleration of the Papish Religion, by public Protestation.
THE Religion of Papists is Superstitious and Idolatrous, their Faith and
Doctrine erroneous and heretical, their Church (in respect of both)
Apostaticall; to give them therefore a toleration of Religion, or to consent
that they may-freely exercise their Religion, and profess their Faith and
Doctrine, is a grievous sin, and that in two respects: First, it is to make
our selves accessory to their superstitious Idolaries, Heresies, and in a word,
to all the abominations of popery; but also (which is a consequent of the
former) to the perdition of the seduced people, which perish in the deluge of
the Catholic Apostasy. Secondly, to grant them a toleration in respect of any
money to be given, or contribution to be made by them, is to set Religion to
sale, and with it the souls of the people whom Christ our Savior has
redeemed with his most precious blood: And as it is a great sin, so it is a
matter of most dangerous consequence, the consideration whereof we leave to the
wise and judicions, beseeching the zealous God of truth to make those who are
in authority zealous of Gods glory, and of the advancement of true Religion,
zealous, resolute and courageous against all Popery, Superstition and Idolatry.

There were likely to be granted to the Papists in Ireland many privileges,
and withal, a toleration for their Religion, in the consideration of the
payment of a great sum of money. This Easter term 1626. there was a great
meeting of all the chiefest of the whole Kingdom, and the Archbishops and
Bishops, etc. and it was likely to be concluded: Doctor D^wanm Bishop of
Londonderry April 11. preached at Dublin before the Lord Deputy and the State;
his Text was Luke 1. at the 79. In the midst of his Sermon he openly read this
Protestation above written, subscribed by the Archbishops and Bishops of
Ireland, and at the end, he boldly said, And let all the people say, Amen. And
suddenly all the whole Church almost shook with the sound that their loud Amen
made, etc. The Lord Deputy called from the Bishop of Derry a Copy both of his
Sermon and Protestation to send to the King: The learned and courageous Bishop
gave this Answer, that there was nothing he either spoke or read, in the
Pulpit, but he would willingly justify it before his Majesty, and feared not
who read or saw it: So now by Gods mercy nothing may yet be done, or will be,
till the Lord Deputy hear from the King.

That this information of the Commons to his Majesty, was then most true,
real, and that this Bishop knew it to be so in every particular, we shall
manifest by this printed Proclamation, found in his Study, thus endorsed with
his own hand, not long after his Answer to the Commons Remonstrance: April 1.
1629. A Proclamation concerning the growth of Popery in Ireland, etc. which was
read as follows:

By the Lord DEPUTY and COUNCIL. Henry Falkland:

FOrasmuch as We cannot but take notice, that the late intermission of legal
proceedings against popish pretended or titulary Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots,
Deanes, Vicars general, Jesuits, Friars, and others of that sort, that derive
their pretended Authority and Orders from the Sea of Rome, has bred such an
extraordinary insolence and presumption in them, as that they have dared here
of late, not only to assemble themselves in public places, to celebrate their
superstitious services in all parts of this Kingdom, but also have erected
houses and buildings called public Oratories, Colleges, Masse-houses, and
convents NOTE.
of Friars, Monks and Nuns, in the eye and open view of the State and
elsewhere, and do frequently exercise jurisdiction against his Majesty's
Subjects, by authority derived from the Sea of Rome, and (by color of teaching
and keeping Schools in their pretended Monasteries and Colleges) do train up
the youth of this Kingdom in their superstitious Religion, to the great
derogation and contempt of his Majesty's regal power and authority, and great
offense of many of his Majesty's good Subjects, contrary to the Laws, and
Ecclesiastical government of this Kingdom, and the impoverishment of his
Majesty's Subjects in the same.

These are therefore to will and require, and in his Majesty's name, straightly
to charge and command all, and all manner such pretended or titulary
Archbishops, Bishops, Deanes, Vicars general, Archdeacons and others,
deriving any pretended authority, power or jurisdiction from the Sea of Rome,
that they and every of them forbear from henceforth to exercise any such
power, jurisdiction or authority within this Kingdom, and that all such
Abbots, Pryors, Jesuits, Friars, Munks, Nuns, and others of that sort, as
aforesaid, do forthwith break up their Convents in all houses of Friars,
Colleges, Monasteries, and other places wheresoever they are, or shall be
conventually or collegiatly assembled together within this Kingdom, and to
relinquish the same, and to disperse and separate themselves.

And that all and every of the Orders before named, and other Priests
whatsoever, do from henceforth forbear to preach, teach or celebrate their
Service in any Church, Chapel, or other public Oratory, or public place, or
to teach any School in any place or places whatsoever within this Kingdom.

And We do further straightly charge and command all and singular the owners
of such houses of Friars, Colleges, Monasteries, Schools, Oratories,
Masse-houses and Nunneries, that they and every of them respectively in default
of the persons before named, their voluntary relinquishing of the said houses
of Friars, Colleges, Monasteries, Schools, Oratories, Masse-houses and
Nunneries, do forthwith expel and thrust forth all and singular such Friars,
Jesuits and other Monastical persons out of the same, and to convert the same
to other more lawful uses, upon pain to have their said houses seized to his
Majesty's use, and both the one and the other to be proceeded against for their
unlawful assemblies, and maintenance of such unlawful Conventicles and
corrupt nurture of children, in the severest manner that by the Laws and
Statutes of this Kingdom and Ecclesiastical government of the same may be had
or extended, whereof they and every of them are to take notice, and to veeld
due obedience thereunto, as they and every of them will avoid his Majesty's
high indignation, and the consequence thereof.

Here we have a confitentem, reum the By. himself under his own handwriting
endorsed on this Proclamation, justifying the Parlia. Remonstrance to be true,
and his Answer to it a malicious slander, to advance the Papists designs:
After which he had further intelligence from time to time, by several Letters
and Papers out of Ireland ( A Necessary Introduction, etc. p. 100. to 119.
elsewhere published at large) of the dangerous growth, increase and
insolences of the Papists there, notwithstanding this Proclamation, and that
there was a popish Hierarchy there exercised and University erected without
control: We shall instance only in two remarkable Letters, written to him
from Doctor Beadle, Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh, found in his Study, endorsed
with his own hand, and read at the Lords Bar.

The first of them he thus endorseth, April 1. 1630. From Doctor Beadle, Lord
Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh, about the state of the Church in his Diocese,
and the Papists in Ireland: Who writes thus thereof:

Right Reverend Father, my Honorable good Lord:
SInce my coming to this place, which was a little before Michaelmas (till
which time the settling of the State of the College, and my Lord Primates
visitation deferred my consecration) I have not been unmindful of your
Lordships commands, to advertise you, as my experience should inform, of the
state of this Church; which I shall now the better do, because I have been
about my Diocesses, and can set down out of my knowledge and view, what I
shall relate, and shortly, to speak much ill matter in a few words, it is very
miserable: The Cathedral Church of Ardagh, one of the most ancient in Ireland,
and said to be built by Saint Patrick, together with the Bishop's house there,
down to the ground: the Church here built, but without Bell or Steeple, Font
or Chalice; The Parish Churches all in a manner rained or unroofed and
unrepaired; the people, saving a few British planters here and there (which are
not the tenth part of the remnant) obstinate Recusants; a Popish Clergy more
numerous by far then we, and in the full exercise of all jurisdiction
Ecclesiastical, by their Vicars-generall and Officials; who are so confident,
as they excommunicate those that come to our Courts, even in Matrimonial
causes, which affront has been offered my self by the popish Primates
Vicar-generall, for which I have begun a process against him; the Primate
himself lives in my Parish, within two mile of my NOTE.
house, the Bishop in mother part of my Diocese farther off: every Parish has
his Priest, and some two or three apiece, and so their Masse-houses also; in
some places Mass is said in the Churches; Friars there are in diverse places,
who go about, though not in their habit, and by their impor^^^ate begging
empoverish the people: Who indeed are generally very poor, as from that cause,
so from their paying double Tithes to their own Clergy and ours, from the
d^^th of Corn, and the death of their Cattle these late years, which the (...)
to their soldiers and their agents, and which they forget not to reckon among
other causes, the appression of the Court Ecclesiastiasticall; which in very
truth any Lord I cannot excuse, and do seek to reform.

For our own, there are some seven or eight Ministers in each Diocese, of
good sufficiency, and (which is no small cause of the continuance of the people
in popery still) English which have not the tongue of the people, nor can
perform any divine offices, or converse with them, and which hold many of them
two, three, four, or more Vicarages apiece; even the Clerkships themselves are
in like manner conferred upon the English, and sometimes two or three or more
upon one man, and ordinarily bought and sold, or let to farm, etc. His Majesty
is now with the greatest part of this Country, as to their hearts, consciences,
King, but at the NOTE.

Kilmore the 1. of April 1630.

His second Letter to the Lord Deputy of Ireland about the maintenance of the
Army and the Cavan Petition, which he sent enclosed in an other Letter to the
Archbishop, is somewhat more full and observable, wherein there is this
memorable passage concerning the increase and insolences of the Papists in
Ireland; which Letter he received thence December. 4. 1633.

Right Honorable my good Lord, etc.
IN the midst of these thoughts, I have been advertised from an honorable
friend in England, that I am accused to his Majesty, to have opposed his
service, and that my hand, with two other Bishops only, was to a writing,
touching the moneys to be levied on the Papists here, for maintenance of the
men of war, etc. Indeed if I should have had such ad intention, this had been
not only to oppose the service of his Majesty, but to expose with the public
peace, mine own neck to the s^eans of the Romish Cutthroats: I that know that
in this Kingdom of his Majesty, the Pope has another Kingdom far greater
in number, and as I have heretofore signified to the Lords Justices and
Counsel (which is also since justified by NOTE:
themselves in print) constantly guided and directed by the Order of the new
Congregation, de propaganda side, lately erected at Rome, transmitted by the
means of the Popes Nuncioes residing at Bruxels or Paris, that the Pope has
here a Clergy, if I may guess by my own Diocese, double in number to us,
the heads whereof are by corporal Oath bound to him, to maintain him and his
Regalities, contra omnem hominem, and to execute his Mandates to the utmost of
their forces, which accordingly they do, stiling themselves in print, Ego N.
Dei, etc. Apostolicae Sedis gratia Episcopus Fermien, and Ossorien, etc. I that
know there is in this Kingdom, for the moulding of the people to the Popes
obedience, a rabble of irregular Regulars, commonly younger Brothers of good
houses, who are grown to that insolency, a^ to advance themselves to be
Members of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, in better rank then Priests, in so
much as the censure of the Sorbon is feign to be implored to curb them, which
yet is called in again, so tender is the Pope of his own Creatures: I that
know that his Holiness has erected a new University at Dublin, to confrant
his Majesty's College there, and to br^ed up the youth of this Kingdom to his
devotion; of which University NOTE.
one Paul Harris, the Author of that infamous Libell which was put forth in
print against the Lord Armaths Wansted Sermon, styles himself in print to be
Deane: I that know and have given advertisement to the State, that these
Regulars dare erect new Fryeries in the Country, since the dissolving of those
in the Citys that they have brought the people to such a sottish senselessness,
as they care not to learn the Commandments; as God himself spoke and writ
them, but they flock in great members to the preaching of new superstitious and
detestable doctrines, such as their own Priests are ashamed of, and at these
they levy collections, three, four, five, six pound at a Sermon: Shortly, I
that know that these Regulars and this Clergy have at a general meeting, like
to a Synod, as themselves style it, holden at Drogheda, decreed, that it is not
lawful to take the Oath of Alleagiance, and if they be constant to their own
doctrine, do account his Majesty in their hearts to be King, but at the Popes
discretion. In NOTE.
this estate of this Kingdom, to think the bridle of the Army may be taken
away, it should be the thought, not of a brainsick, but brainlesse man, etc.

The day of our deliverance from the popish Powder Plot.

Your Lordships in all duty, WILLIAM KILMORE.


By these two Letters, it is most apparent, that this Arch-Prelat was from time
to time acquainted with the extraordinary increase and insufferable insolences
of the Papists in Ireland, as likewise of their popish Archbishops and Bishops
audacious proceedings in that Kingdom, which he was more fully informed of by
two printed papers; (sent to him by Archbishop Usher) the one in Latin, the
other in English, found in his Study; endorsed thus with his Secretary Dels
hand, May 3. 1632. Protestations of the Secular Priests in Ireland, against
Thomas Flemming Archbishop of Dublin; one whereof was read at the Lords Bar.

To all the most Illustrious Archbishops and Bishops of Ireland, but more
particularly to those of the Province of Dublin, their honorable Lords, David
Bishop of Ossory, John of Fernes, Rosse of Kildare, and Matthew Vicar
Apostolical of Lagblem.
MOST Illustrious Lords and Reverend Bishops, the Priests of Dublin make their
complaint before you, that the most Illustrious Archbishop of Dublin, Thomas
Flemming, of the Order of Saint Francis, without alleging my cause against
them, only for his will and at his pleasure, uses to exile and banish Priests
out of his Diocese: and they protest that in so doing, he exercises a tyranny
over the Clergy, contrary to the Canons of holy Church, and the Laws and
Statutes of this Kingdom.

Most Illustrious Lords and Reverend Fathers in Christ, the aforesaid Priests
do make their complaints, that the same most Illustrious Archbishop of
Dublin, Thomas Flemming, of the Order of Saint Francis, though humbly sought
unto, and desired, does refuse to do them justice in their causes, neither yet
will be permit the Clergy to follow their actions merely civil before the
Magistrate, contrary to the received customs of this kingdom, from the first
conversion of this Nation; and they protest that in so doing, be exercises a
tyranny over the Clergy, contrary unto the Canons of the Church, and the Laws
and Statutes of this Kingdom, etc.

Most Illustrious Lords and Reverend Fathers in Christ, the aforesaid Priests
do complain, that the Illustrious Archbishop of Dublin, Thomas Flemming, of
the Order of Saint Francis, is accustomed to answer the Clergy, complaining of
their grievances to him, If I do you wrong, you may go to Rome to complain:
In the mean time, reporting himself so powerful in the Court of Rome, that
be fears no adversary: And of this that reverend Priest, Father Patrick
Ca^ill, Doctor of Divinity, had experience, who for a year treating of his
injuries and grievances done unto himby the Archbishop of Dublin, could by no
means prevail once to be admitted to the presence and audience of the most
eminent Cardinal NOTE.
Ludovifius, Vice Chancellor of Rome; which Cardinal notwithstanding is given
by his Holiness unto the Irish, at the only Patron and Protector of the Irish
Nation: These things we may remember with grief, but amend them we cannot; but
we profess before Almighty God, his Holiness, and all faithful people, that
this is nothing else but to tyrannize over the Clergy, to the dishonor of the
Church, and no small contempt to the Sea Apostolic.

For which and other causes besides to be alleged, and in their due time and
place to be proved against the above named Thomas Flemming, of the Order of
Saint Francis, we the aforesaid Priests, and hereafter to be named, do set
before your eyes, most Illustrious and reverend Lords, these our grievances, as
meet and honorable witnesses of this our deed, writing and public instrument,
and as far as is possible and lawful for us by the Canons of holy Church,
declining the jurisdiction of our aforesaid Ordinary by this our present
writing, and from this time forth we appeal unto the Sea Apostolic, from all
Ecclesiastical censures hereafter to be inflicted upon us by the same
Illustrious Archbishop, Thomas Flemming, of the Order of Saint Francis; and in
the mean time, providing for our innocence and safety, (according to the
example of Saint Paul, and Saint Athanasius) we do invocate the aid of the
secular arm for our present remedy, against the aforesaid Illustrious
Archbishop Thomas Flemming, of the Order of Saint Francis, and all Regulars of
what Order soever, as well Monks as begging Friars, Abettars, Counselors and
Participants with him in the premises, as violators and contemners of all Laws
divine and humane, and men by the Law excommuicate. Humbly beseeching your
Lordships in the bowels of the Crucified, that you would be pleased to intimate
with as much speed as may be, this our Protestation and Appeal unto the Sea
Apostolic; and the God of peace and love, long preserve your Reverend
Lordships in safety.

Dated at Dublin, May the third, in the year of our Lord 1632. Peter Caddell,
Doctor of Divinity. Paul Harris pr. Deacon of the University of Dublin.


From which Protestation, we may observe these considerable particulars:

First, that the Papists in Ireland had their own popish Archbishops, Bishops
and a Vicar Apostolical residing then amongst them, as the title and body of
this Protestation manifests.

Secondly, that their Archbishop Flemming had a popish Clergy under him, in his
Province, and did exceedingly tyrannize over them, usurping jurisdiction even
in temporal causes, and over the Kings own Courts among the Catholics of
Ireland.

Thirdly, that the popish Bishops in Ireland, did usually confer Orders, and
exercise all Episcopal jurisdiction there.

Fourthly, that they had a special Cardinal at Rome [Ludovifius] given by
NOTE.
the Pope unto the Irish, as the only Patron and Protector of the Irish Nation.

Fifthly, that they were grown extraordinary bold and insolent there, so as
they openly published this their Protestation and Appeal in print, both in
Latin and English, to all the world, and avowed it under their hands,
subscribed to it.

Sixthly, that they had then erected a popish University in Dublin it self, of
which Paul Harris professes himself Deacon (or Dean, as Bishop Beadle styles
him. even in print.

This Prelat, though he knew all this, yet for ought we find, he never took any
severe course at all to prevent the increase and insolences of the popish
Prelates, Priests, Friars, Papists there, but rather to foment them: For first,
he promoted and sent over diverse superstitious popish Clergymen thither, as
young Mr. Croxton, Doctor Bramball (his principal Agent and Informer, Chaplain
to the Lord Deputy) Master Chapple, and others, who set up sundry popish
innovations, and brcohed popish Doctrines there, to the great encouragement of
the Papists: Secondly, he sent over the Lord Wentworth (his grand instrument
and confederace) to be Lord Deputy of that Kingdom, who extraordinarily
favored the popish party there, and at last proceeded so far, as to make use
of them even in Parliament, to balance the Protestants, the better to conquer
and enslave that Kingdom, even by Parliaments; witness this remarkable clause
in A Duplicate of a Dispatch of this Lord Deputies to his Majesty Jan. 22.
1633. with this subscription: For my Lords Grace of Canterbury; found in his
private Study at Lambeth, thus endorsed with his own hand, Rec. Mar. 2. 1633.
Comp. Ang. Reasons for the present calling of a Parliament in Ireland: Where
thus he writes concerning the Parliament then intended to be there called.

I Shall endeavoour that the lower House may be so composed, as that neither
the Recusants, nor yet the Protestants shall appear considerably more one then
the other, holding them as much as may be, upon an equal balance, for they
will prove thus easier to govern, then if either party were absolute. Then
would I in private discourse show the Recusant, That the contribution ending in
December next, if your Majesty's Army were not employed some other way before,
the twelve pence a Sunday must of necessity be exacted upon them: Show the
Protestant, that your Majesty must not let go the 20000li. contribution; nor
yet discontent the other in matter of Religion, till the Army were some way
else certainly provided for, and convince them both, that the present quarterly
paiments are not so burdensome as they pretended them to be: And that by the
graces they have had already more benefit then their money came to: Thus poising
one by the other, which single might perchance prove more unhappy to deal with.

With this Machiavillian policy, he then acquainted this Archbishop, and
acaccordingly pursued it; which what desperate effects it has of late produced
in that Kingdom, by making the Irish Papists able to over-master, and almost
extirpate the English-Irish Protestants and their Religion there, we now
experimentally feel to our greatest grief and danger.

Neither did the Archbishop only approve this hellish policy of the Lord
Deputy, but likewise in the late Scottish troubles, they both most desperately
persuaded his Majesty (without the privity of the other Lords) to raise an Army
among the Papists in Ireland, to subdue the Scots by force, because they durst
not trust the NOTE.
English, in regard the puritan party was so great, and beld correspondency
with the Scots; which advice was held most dangerous and pernicious council by
our Statesmen, as two: A Necessary Introduction, etc. p. 170, 171, 170.
Jesuits G. T. (Talbot the Jesuit) and William Hewill, writ to their Father
Superior at Paris ^nne 28. 1631. as appears by their intercepted Letters,
found among Secretary Windebanks sequestered papers.

If any should object, than this Archbishop had no power or charge at all in
Ireland to suppress the Papists there: We answer, it appears by hundreds of
papers, Letters found in his Study, sent from thence to him; that nothing at
all was there acted concerning any Church affairs, but by his direction, who
swayed all things, disposed of all Church preferments there at his pleasure,
and likewise did what he pleased there in most state businesses by reason of
his power with the King, and interest in the Deputy, insomuch, that the very
naming of him at the Counsel Table there, was like a Gorgons head, to amaze
all opposites, and strike them mute, or into a shaking fit, as the Primate of
Armagh informed him in two several Letters from thence: Wherefore we cannot
but from all the premises conclude this very Archbishop guilty of being not
only privy, but aiding to the reestablishing of popery in Ireland, and
reuniting it to the Church of Rome; which Realm being farthest out of sight,
was thought the meetest Theater for the Pope and his Instruments to act their
designs and parts upon, with most advantage, security, and least opposition.

The seventh particular, which most evidently manifests the Pope's with his
Agents designs and studious endeavor to reconcile us to Rome, and our
domestic compliance therewith, is the Popes sending of diverse Nuncioes
successively from Rome into England (a thing never formerly heard of since the
Reformation) who kept their residence, and were entertained as Nuncioes to him
in London, Westminster, had frequent access to Court, and held correspondency
with diverse of our Nobility; more especially with Secret. Windebank and Bishop
Mountague, this Archbishops chief Creatures, seconded with our avowed
entertainment of popish Agents at Rome, of purpose to reduce and reconcile us
to it.

The first of these Nuncioes was Gregorio Panzani, who arrived at London December.
See A Necessary Introduction, etc. page 141, 142, 143, to 146. 209. to 218. The
Popes Nuncio. Romes Masterpiece. The Popes Breve.
25. 1634. where he was received, welcomed, treated with both by King and
Queen; who continuing here till the year 1636. and then returning, Seignior
Georgio Con, a Scot, (who departed from Rome toward England May 20. 1636.)
arrived here about the end of that month, bringing a great Breve, and many
Relics of Saints, Meddals, and pieces of gold and silver, with the Popes
picture stamped on them, who was courteously entertained by the King and Queen
at Hombly in Northamptonshire, where he found them, and afterward kept his
residence in Westminster near the New Exchange. He after three years and two
months stay here in England, aspiring to a Cardinals Cap, returned toward
Rome, laden with great store of Jewels and gifts worth many thousand pounds.
After him Count Rossetti, a Noble man of Ferrara, was sent over hither as
Nuncio, who continued his Negotiation here, and found great respect at Court,
till he was driven hence by this Parliament, wherein were many complaints
against him, about July 1641. as we have elsewhere manifested: And as the Pope
had his Nuncio's here, so had we our reciprocal Agents at Rome: The first of
them was Master Walter Mountague, who arrived there about August 1633. to whom
succeeded Serj. Major Bret, who arrived at Rome about December. 1635. After him
succeeded Sir William Hamilton, a Scot, dangerous Papist, who came to Rome
about the end of May 1636. and continued Agent there till this present
Parliament: Of all which this Archbishop had exact intelligence, as appears by
Master Midleton's Letters to him, and Habernfields Discovery; found among his
own papers, endorsed by himself.

The eighth particular, is the Popes and his Congreations, de Propaganda side,
a^ Rome, sending over infinite swarms of Seminary Priests, Jesuits, Friars of
all sorts into England, to seduce us; their erecting of a popish Hierachy,
societies of Jesuits, Monasteries of Monks, Nuns, and other popish Locusts
secretly among us, and holding a general Counsel at London, whereof Con the
Popes Nuncio was President; to raise arms, forces, moneys against the Scots, to
advance the Catholics cause; all which we have elsewhere related, proved at
large, and was very well know to this Prelat, by the manifold Remonstrances,
Petitions of the Parliament, against this dangerous increase of Papists,
Priests, Jesuits, Popery, which Petitions he still opposed.

These five particulars thus proved, premised, infallibly demonstrating a
dangerous design and prosecution of it in the Pope and his Instruments to
reduce, subject us to the Church of Rome, of which this Archbishop was most
fully informed, and wherewith in a great measure he complied with them; we
shall now proceed to demonstrate, that instead of counterworking, opposing,
resisting this known design and practice of theirs, according to his trust and
duty, he did most traitorously and wickedly combine, confederate with them to
the utmost of his wit and power, to advance, accomplish this their design and
project by sundry Jesuiticall practices; some whereof we have formerly proved,
pressed at large, and therefore shall only recapitulate now, to re-fresh your
memories, and then proceed to further evidence.

First of all, he began to usher into our Cathedrals, Churches, Chapels,
Universities, by inches and degrees, one after another, Altars, Images,
Crucifixes, Tapers, Copes, consecrated Basins, Altar-cloths, bowing to Altars,
Popish consecrations of Churches, Chapels, Churchyards, Flagons, Vestments,
Credentiaes, Corporals, turning and railing in Communion Tables Altarwise,
kneeling at the new Rails, standing up at Gloria Patri, praying toward the
east, reading second service at the Altar, with other popish Innovations
formerly mentioned; at first he introduced them only as things tolerable, or
indifferent, at last enjoyed them as expedient and necessary.

Secondly, he proceeded to introduce diverse Arminian Tenants as a bridge to
popery; first, in Pulpits, discourses; then in printed authorized books,
prohibiting, suppressing, all preaching, printing, and books against them under
severe penalties.

Thirdly, he next went on to countenance, authorize, maintain, confirm, both in
Pulpit and Press, diverse erroneous positions, contrary to the general strain
and tenent of our own and foreign Protestant Writers of chiefest note, tending
toward a reconciliation between us and Rome: We shall instance in these few
particulars, maintained by himself, both in his speeches and writings: First,
that the Church of Rome is a true Church: Secondly, that she never erred in
fundamentals in the worst times, but only circa fundamentalia, both which he
publicly maintained in the High Commission at Doctor Bastwicks censure, as
Master Burton and Master Lane a Minister deposed: Thirdly, that the Religion of
Papists and Protestants is one and the same: Fourthly, that men may be saved in
the Church of Rome and Romish Religion, and therefore we need not pray for any
Papists conversion, no not for the Queens, which he specially prohibited, and
questioned those who thus prayed for her: Fifthly, that the Pope is not
Antichrist, nor ought to have this title given him, which he expunged both out
of the public Books of our Church, and private men's impressions: Sixthly, that
the Pope is supreme head of the Church, the first and greatest Patriarch; and
to make this doctrine pass more current, he suffered the Popes own Titles of,
Sanctitatis Vestrae Sanctissime Pater, Spiritus Sancti effusissime plenus;
Optimus Maximusque in terris: Ille quo rectior non-stat Regula, quo Prior est
corrigenda Religio; to be attributed to him successively in sundry Letters from
the University of Oxford, Master Croxton and others without control; and
proclaims himself a Patriarch, in his own book against Fisher, page 171.
Seventhly, his own Chaplain Doctor Bray, by his special direction, in two
Books of Doctor Pocklingtons, severally printed, and reprinted with authority,
proclaimed, that he derived his lineall succession and Episcopacy from Pope
Gregory and Saint Peter's Chair at Rome, and that our Church was miserable if he
could not do so; which Doctor Heylen, by his special command, seconded in
print; which Bishop Mountague thus trebles in his Originum Ecclesiasticarum;
Tomi Priorus, pars posterior, page 465. In Pontificali, seu libro quam vocamus
Ordinationum, Episcopus, (AB AUGUSTINO LEGITIME DERIVATA SUCCESSIONE, ET
GREGORIO ROMANO DEDUCTUS) Sacros Ordines secundum veteris Ecclesiae Cannores
conferens, Ordinandum Sacerdotem, sic affatur, Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, etc.
Deriving not only this Archbishop, but all our other Bishops successions and
Episcopacy from Augustine the Monk, and Pope Gregory of Rome; a goodly Romish
pedigree to be much insisted on directly reducing us back to Rome, from whence
it was derived, as to our Mother Church.

Fourthly, he with his Instruments and Chaplains, vented, authorized not only
in the Pulpit, but Press, all manner of popish erroneous doctrines, never
heard amongst us in former years, comprizing the whole body of Papistry, of
purpose to reduce us back to Rome; the particulars whereof you have heard,
refusing, suppressing orthodox Books, written against popish errors, and
purging the chiefest passages against the Church, Pope, Prests, Jesuits and
errors of Rome out of all old reprinted and new licensed books, before they
could pass the Press, as we have abundantly proved, inserting popish
pictures, and a popish Index into our very Bibles, the more easily to seduce
men to Popery.

Fifthly, he advanced the most corrupt, popish, superstitious persons of all
sorts, to Bishoprics, Deaneries, Prebendaries, Head-ships of houses in the
University, Chaplains to the King and Prince, and the greatest Benefices;
suppressed, silenced, deprived, censured, banished the most zealous preaching
orthodox Ministers in all places, and kept them from preferment, the better to
facilitate and effect this design.

Sixthly, he caused sundry books tending to Reconciliation of us to Rome, to be
printed and published, especially Bishop Mountague's Appeal, and other Books
since, of which Sancta Clara took special notice, and made bold to proclaim a
peace and reconciliation in most points between us.

Seventhly, he suppressed all Lectures and afternoon Sermons on the Lord's day
in most places, that the people through ignorance might be more easily seduced;
and instead of strict sanctification of the Lords day, the principal means of
increasing piety, knowledge, and keeping men off from popery and prophannesse,
he caused a new Declaration to be printed and published in his Majesty's name,
for the use of profane sports and pastimes even on Gods own day, and under
pretext thereof, caused hundreds of our most conscientious Ministers, (whom
otherwise he could not tax or quarrel,) to be silenced, suspended, imprisoned,
yea, driven out of the Realm to foreign Countries and Plantations, that so
these grand obstructions of our reconciliation with Rome being removed we might
without any great difficulty or opposition be reduced, reconciled to her; and
least any impediment should arise to cross this Unity from the Dutch, French,
or Walloon Churches in our Realms, not any ways poisoned with his popish drugs
and Romish innovations, he attempted their extirpation too, and had almost
effected it: All which particulars we have already proved.

We shall now proceed to some further evidence, manifesting his compliancy,
intelligence and concurrence with the Pope and his Instruments in this hellish
plot; what evidence of this kind, common fame and report, both at home, at
Rome, and elsewhere has given in against him, Sir Henry Mildmay, Master Anthony
Mildmay, Master Challoner and others have already attested: what real evidence
we have yet remaining, to make good this fame, we shall now produce.

It had been too gross, too palpable an oversight in such a politician as this
Archbishop was reputed, and very prejudicial to his designs, considering the
place he sustained, his pretended profession of the Protestant Religion, his
dislike of Rome, and the many vigilant eyes that were continually fixed on his
actions, to have held any open or immediate intelligence with the Pope, or his
known Agents here, and therefore it can not reasonably be expected from us to
produce direct proofs of any such gross intelligence; what then he could not
act publicly and immediately in person, he contrived to effect more courtly and
mediatly by fitting instruments, who held strict correspondence with the Roman
Pontife and his Negotiators. The two trustiest persons he could call out for
such a purpose, were Master Francis Windebank, a lay man, and Richard Mountague
a Divine, who had other associates joined with them to accomplish this
reducement: To enable them the better to carry on this work with more advantage
to the Catholic cause, he procured Mountague (in despite of several
Parliaments opposition) to be made a Bishop, heaped sundry preferments on him
in our Church (of which he so ill deserved) as we have already proved, and
shall not here insist on: As for Windebank, he advanced him to one of the
greatest places of trust and secrecy in the Kingdom, making him a principal
Secretary of State to his Majesty, which he thus expresses with his own hand
in his Diary: June 15. 1632. Master Fancis Windebank, MY OLD FRIEND, was sworn
Secretary His old, ancientest and most loving friend, as he terms him in his
Diary. November. 24. 1625. Aug. 1629. June 16 1632.
of State, WHICH PLACE I OBTAINED FOR HIM of my gracious Master King CHARLES;
so that he was a creature of his own advancing. No sooner was he settled in this
place of honor and trust, but he presently falls to his designed work; he
protects, releaseth popish Priests, Jesuits, Friars, and held familiar
correspondency with them, entertaining them in his house, Study, Coach, Garden,
and feasting them at his Table; imprisons, molests, reviles the Messengers who
by office, duty, were bound to apprehend them; suspends the execution of all
penal laws against them and popish Recusants, by his Letters and Warrants of
protection under the privy Signet; held familiar intelligence with Cardinal
Barbarino and Panzani, Con, Rossetti, the Popes Nuncioes, during their abode in
England; sends two of his sons to Rome in their travels, where this Cardinal
entertains them with all courtesy and respect for their Fathers sake, and sends
sundry Letters to Con from Rome in one of their Trunks; all which being largely
proved and published to the world in Romes Masterpiece. The Popish Royal
Favorite. A necessary Introduction to the Archbishops trial. A necessary
Introduction, p. 123, 124. the Royal popish Favorite, p. 18. to 33.
other Impressions, we shall but point at here.

First, For Windebank's release of Priests and Jesuits, for which he was
impeached by the Parliament, and fled the Kingdom, we have elsewhere given you a
Catalogue of 27. Priests discharged by him out of prison, the Original Warrants
for whose discharge we have ready to produce under his hand, and printed the
Copies of them; we shall mention only one or two Warrants wherein this
Archbishop concurred with Windebank in the release of two popish Priests from
their prisons, though we never heard of such a favor extended by him to any
Puritan or Zealot against Papists, whom he shut up close prisoners even in
foreign parts, from Wives, Children, Friends, and all humane comforts.

The first is a Warrant for the release of one Robert Hais, a Priest (so proved
upon Oath by Master Thomas Mayo, a Pursevant) dated 13. December. 1633. the
Original whereof under Seal was read:

At Whitehall the 18. of December 1633. present.

Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.

Lord Cottington, etc.

Archbishop of York, etc.

Master Secretary Windebank.

WHereas a Petition was this day presented to the Board, by Robert Hais,
prisoner in the New-prison, showing, that the Petitioner is much impoverished
in his estate by his long imprisonment, and is now grown so weak through
infirmities, that unless by their Lorships favor he may enjoy the benefit of
fresh air for the recovery of his health, his life is in great danger; and
therefore made humble suit to be discharged from prison (for preservation of
his life aforesaid) upon good security, to attend the Board within ten days
after notice in that behalf; Forasmuch as his Petition was recommended to the
Board BY THE QUEENS MAJESTY; their Lordships do think fit, and order, that the
said Hais (first giving good security, to attend the Board within ten days
after notice given, as aforesaid) shall be discharged from his imprisonment,
and enjoy his liberty, without molestation or trouble of any Messengers, or
other his Majesty's Officers whatsoever; whereof the Keeper of the said prison,
and all other whom it may concern, are to take notice.

Ex. WILL. BECHER.

The second, is a Warrant for the enlarging of William Walgrave (deposed to be
a dangerous seducing Priest, by Master Francis Newton) subscribed with the
Archbishops own hand, and others; the Original whereof was produced.

These are to will and command you to set at full liberty the person of William
Walgrave formerly committed to your custody; and for your so doing, this shall
be your sufficient Warrant. Dated at Star Chamber the last of January 1633.

Will. Cant. R. Ebor, etc.

Secondly, for Letters of grace and protection, granted by Windebank, under the
Privy Signet, for the stay of all proceedings against Recusants, and suspension
of penal Laws against them; there are multitudes of them printed by Authority
of Parliament, in the Popish Royal Favorite, to which we shall remit the
Reader.

Thirdly, for his holding intelligence with the Popes Nuncioes, Cardinal
Barbarino, Jesuits, Priests, and dangerous Papists, with his sons resort to,
and entertainment at Rome; we shall evidence it by these ensuing Letters, the
Originals whereof under hand and seal, endorsed with Secretary Windebanks own
hand, were produced and read at the Lords Bar.

The first is a letter written from Rome it self from Gregorio Panzani (the
Popes first Nuncio sent thence into England,) dated May 31. 1637. wherein he
returns hearty thanks to this Secretary, for the many favors he daily received
from him whiles he was Nuncio in England, in behalf of the poor Catholics;
makes mention of his Sons being entertainment at Rome, and Cardinal
Barbarino his extraordinary commendations of them; the Original whereof was
showed, written in Italian, and a true translated copy thereof (attested upon
oath by one Master Godfry) read in these ensuing words.

Most Excellent Sir, Patron most honored,
I Would have contained my self from writing to your most illustrious
Lordship, for fear of being some impediment, I knowing your many occupations;
but I having heard from many persons, in particular by letters of Segnior
Francisco, sometimes my Secretary, the honorable mention that otherwhiles your
most illustrious Lordship is wont to make of any person; and having also
oftentimes understood NOTE.
from your most famous Segnior Cavaliere Hamilton, and from Father John the
Benedictin, how much your most illustrious Lordship straineth your self in
favoring of me; I have been forced to commit this rude civility, taking in
hand my Pen to give you trouble; I assure your most famous Lordship, that I
live so much obliged to you, that NOTE.
I shall never be able to pretend to satisfy one and the least particle of
that which I owe, seeing that during my abode in London, most rare were those
days in which I did not receive from your most illustrious Lordship some grace
in the behalf and favor of the poor Catholics. I must also congratulate my
self with your most famous Lordship, concerning the most noble manners and
behaviors of your Lordships Sons, the which with their singular modesty, and
other most lavdable virtues, have gained such an opinion, amongst them that
have known them in this Court, that I could never be able to express it, and
the Lord Cardinal Barbarino, in particular cannot satiate himself in praising
them; It grieves me not to have had the fortune to meet with them in this
City, because willingly I would have attested my devotion toward your most
famous Lordship; to the which, and to all your most illustrious Family, I rest,
desiring eternal felicity from heaven; in the mean while I humbly entreat you
to favor me with some Commandment, and I kiss your hands

Your most illustrious Lordships most devoted and most obliged Servant, GREG:
PANZANI.
From Rome the 31. of May, 1637.

This Letter is most full and punctual, to prove Secretary Windebanks
intelligence and correspondence with Rome, the Pope and his Agents.

The second is a Letter from Father Joseph (then a kind of Confessor to the
French King, by whose special command it was, writ Confessor afterward to our
Queen, and one of the Capucines in Somerset House) written from Paris in
Italian to Secretary Windebank; the translation whereof into English by Master
Godfrey (who attested the truth of it upon oath) was read as follows:

Most excellent Sir, My Patron most worshipful:
I Should be too much wanting in my duty, if I did not render my most humble
thanks to your Excellency, having after so many other favors conferred upon
our NOTE.
Mission, received for a complete height the singular proof of your affection,
in the delivery of our Fathers; I knowing with what love and care you were
pleased to comply your self in this work, the which besides the merit of
charity, has been most grateful to his most Christian Majesty, who in this
does with great satisfaction acknowledge the good will of his Majesty of great
Britain, in the person of his Minister in these Occurrences, which he well
polisheth: If in any occasion I can serve your Excellence, you shall find me
most ready to render you proofs of my devotion and observance, beseeching you
to continue the favorable effects of your benignity toward our Fathers: And
with this I end, augurating unto you all complete felicity.

Your Excellencies most devout, and most humble Servant in Christ Friar Joseph
of Paris, Capucine.
From Paris the 23. of November. 1634.

By this Letter it is evident, what a Professed Patron this Secretary was of
popish Priests and Friars, and what correspondency he held with them.

The third, is a Letter to Secretary Windebank from Father Phillips (the Queens
Confessor) to inform him of Sir William Hamiltons departure from Paris toward
Rome, where he resides as Our Agent to the Pope; and of Con the Popes Nuncioes
departure from Rome toward England; a pregnant evidence of his privity and
compliancy with this Negotiation.

Right Honorable,
YEster night after your Honors departing from Hampton Court, I received this
enclosed: The Gentleman who sent it to me from Paris, writes, that Sir William
Hamilton departed from thence the third of June, that is our 24. of May, so
that now he must be near unto Rome. He writes also, that Seignior Georgio
G^^es, whom the Pope does send to the Queen, was to depart from Rome about the
twentieth of May; if he have heard of Sir Williams hasty going, it may be he
will stay till his arrival, which I could wish, because he both can and would
help him better at the beginning then any other I know: I rest ever

Your Honors most humble and devoted Servant, R. PHILLIPS.
From Hampton Court the 9. of June 1636.

The fourth, is a Letter of Master Thomas Windebank, writ to the Secretary his
Father from Rome, thus endorsed with his own hand, 6. September. 1626. Tom from
Rome, recei. 22. our style.

SIR,
MY most humble duty remembered, etc. In my last, of the sixth of this present, I
have given an account of my arrival at Rome, and of the favor Sir William
Hamilton was pleased to do me, to invite me to his house; this note, that he
did it with so much earnestness, that I could not avoid the receiving of that
honor: I have been to visit the Cardinal Barbarino, who having had notice of
my arrival here, sent to visit me first: He is so obliging and courteous to all
our Nation, NOTE.
that I the less wonder at the honor he does me, to take notice of me, but I
hope his favor will stay there; I see no reason I should think otherwise, etc.

Your most obedient Son THO. WINDEBANK.
Rome Sept. 10. stilo novo 1636.

The fifth, is a Letter from his Son Tom from Rome, thus endorsed by the
Secretary, Tom from Rom, Rec. 30. Sept. our style. Wherein thus he writes:

SIR,
MY most humble duty remembered, etc. Sir William Hamilton has been pleased to
put so great an Obligation upon me, as to invite me to his house for the time
that I am in Rome; I would very willingly have avoided the putting him to such
an inconvenience, but he pressed it so far, that I could not refuse the
receiving of that favor; the Cardinal Barbarino I understand HAS LONG
EXPECTED ME HERE, having had notice of my being in Italy, and I am NOTE.
afraid, THAT OUT OF RESPECT TO YOU, he will put some honor upon me, but I
will avoid all engagements, as much as with civility I may.

Your most obedient Son THO. WINDEBANK.
Rome Sept. 6. stilo novo 1636.

These two Letters clearly manifest his Son's being, respect, and great
entertainment at Rome, both by Sir William Hamilton, our popish Agent there,
and Cardinal Barbarino.

The sixth, is a Letter of his said Son, from Padoa, thus endorsed by Master
Secretary, 16. March 1637. Tom from Padoa, Rec. 8. April our style.

SIR,
I Gave advice in some of my former, of a Trunk I sent from Livorno, into
England unto Master Richant, to be delivered unto you, but have not as yet
received any news of the arrival of it: I sent not the keys, as not desirous
it should be opened until my coming home, because few of the things in it are
mine, but the CARDINAL BARBARINES TO MASTER CON, he told me there was no haste
in the delivery of them, so that I might do it my self.

Your most obedient Son, THO. WINDEBANK.
Padoa 26. March stilo no. 1637.

Here his Son becomes an Instrument to convey popish Trinkets from Cardinal
Barbarino at Rome, to Con the Popes Nuncio then in England.

The seventh is a Letter from the Lord Scudamore, to Secretary Windebank from
Paris, informing him of a Statue sent from Cardinal Barbarino from Rome, to be
transported to him into England.

Right Honorable,
HEre is come to Paris one Master Chambers, with the Statue from Cardinal
Barbarino; another, the servant of him that made the Statue, coming along in
company to take it forth, but no where upon any terms, till it be in England:
Upon Monday next, Master Chambers intends to set forwards for Deep, etc.

Your Honors to command, JOHN SCUDAMORE.
Paris June 16. 1637.

The eighth is a Letter written to him from his Son Christopher Windebank from
Rome, informing this Secretary, how many Friends and Servants he had there, who
much respected and honored him for his sake; among others Panzani, who had
been here a Nuncio, and Father John, (agent to the English Benedictines in
Rome,) which he thus endorsed, Kit from Rome.

Most dear Father,
I Salute you, etc. especially not being in any place my self, where I am not
looked upon by all those who profess themselves SERVANTS of your most
Illustrious Honor: HERE IN ROME your most Illustrious Lordship has NOTE.
many; amongst the which, Sir William Hamilton, Seignior Gregorio Panzani, and
Father John kiss your hands, etc.

Your most obedient Son, CHRIST. WINDEBANK.
From Rome the 15. of April 1639.

If we compare these Letters with the forementioned Instructions of this
Secretary to his Son Thomas at Paris, concerning Ludovicus a Sancta Maria,
Franciscus de Sancta Clara his Book, and Father Leander, it is past all
controversy; that he held most strict and constant intelligence with the Pope,
Cardinal Barbarino, the Popes Nuncio's, Priests, Jesuits, and contributed all
possible assistance to them in their confederacy of reducing us back to Rome.

The reallity whereof, and this Archbishop's cognizance of it, was thus
attested to the Archbishop himself, by Andreas ab Habernfield, and Sir William
Bosel, in the Plot they sent him from the Hague, found in his chamber in the
Tower, endorsed with his own hand.

SEcretary Windebank, a most fierce Papist, is the most unfaithful to the King
of all men, who not only betrays and reveals even the Kings greatest secrets,
but likewise communicates Councels, by which the design may be best advanced:
He at least thrice every week converseth with the Legate in nocturnall
Conventicles, and reveals those things which he thinks fit to be known, for
which end he hired a house near to the Legates house, whom he often resorts to
through the Garden door, for by this vicinity, the meeting is facilitated; ^he
said Secretary is bribed with gifts to the party of that conjured society, by
whom he is sustained, that he may the more seriously execute his Office: He
sent his Son to Rome, to insinuate himself into the Roman Pontiffe.

For his committing Messengers to prison, until they should enter into bond
never to persecute Priests or Jesuits more (an extraordinary good service of a
pretended Protestant Secretary of State) you shall hear thereof anon, when we
produce our Witnesses.

By all these particulars, it is most evident, that this Secretary, (the
Archbishops old, and most intimate loving friend,) was advanced by him to this
place of trust, to be a most pestilent treacherous instrument of protecting,
enlarging, securing popish Priests, Jesuits, Friars, Papists, to hold familiar
intelligence with the Popes Cardinals, Nuncio's, Agents, to promote their
dangerous designs upon us, and reduce us back to Rome; that the Archbishop knew
he was such an one, and yet continued his intimacy and correspondency with him
to promote the same designs.

We shall now proceed a little further, and clearly evidence to your Lordships
and the world, that the Archbishop held, not only remote and mediate
correspondency with the Pope and his Agents by Bishop Mountague, Windebank, and
others of his Instruments, but even with most desperate popish Priests, Jesuits
and Papists themselves; Not to instance in the Earl of Arundel and his
Countess, Sir Kenelme Digby, Sir John Winter, and other lay-papists, who were
very active strenuous promoters of this Romish plot, at Habernfield's Discovery
informs both the Archbishop himself and us, we shall nominate some professed
Priests and Jesuits of note, with whom he had intelligence.

Sancta Clara, as we have proved formerly under his own hand, was brought to
him by Doctor Lindsey, who acquainted him with his Book of Reconciliation,
before it was printed, and was with him afterward some five or six times more,
proffering him his Service to maintain Episcopacy to be Jure Divino.

Monsieur Saint Giles, a most dangerous seducing Priest, though known to him to
be such a one, was maintained by him sundry years together in the University of
Oxford, where he had the free use of the Library, to instruct and seduce both
the Doctors and Students there, and reduce them back to Rome, who were running
too fast thither without such a spur to post them forwards, or Postilion to
direct them in the way: This we have proved under his own hand, by the
testimony of Master Broad, and if need be, we have Master Nixon, Master
Godfrey, and one Father Cox a Benectine Priest, to attest it further on their
Oaths.

Sir Toby Matthew, a most dangerous seducing active Priest and Jesuit, was
frequent with him at Lambeth, White Hall, and other places, eating often with him
at his Table, riding sometimes very familiarly with him in his Coach, and going
with him in his Barge.

Father Flud alias Smith, a most desperate seducing Priest and Jesuit, who had
a hand in the Gun-powder-plot, was very familiar with his Creature Windebank
and often frequented the Archbishop at Lambeth House.

Father Leander, a Benedictine Monk (his ancient Chamber-fellow and
acquaintance in Oxford, sent over into Engl. about the year 1636. as was
generally reported among the Benedictines and Papists, of purpose to reconcile
us to Rome, by his interest in this Archbishop, and great learning, was very
intimate with his Grace and Windebank: So was Father Price, general of the
English Benedictines (who procured the Searchers place at Dover, and put
Papists into it, for the more secure passing of Priests, Jesuits and popish
Agents the easier into England, conveying Englishmen and women to foreign
Monasteries, and intelligence to and from Rome, and other parts, by the
assistance of Windebank, Canterbury, and others:) yea, the popish Bishop of
Calcedon too, Dr Smith, held firm correspondence with him.

Neither was he thus only familiar and held correspondency with these Priests
and Jesuits, but protected them all he might, not prosecuting them at all, but
only in show to delude the people, and then very coldly, securing them in by
prisons where they had the best chambers, great resort, liberty to go in and
out at pleasure without a Keeper, never sending them to the common Goales, to
be indicted, executed, and at last releasing them out of prison, when as he
persecuted, close imprisoned, banished into foreign Countries, dungeons, cut
off the ears, slit the noses, branded the cheeks of some, and utterly ruined
other Protestant Ministes and zealous Gentlemen, for opposing popery and popish
Innovations. Nay, he imprisoned one Gray, a great discover of Priests, only for
apprehending Priests, caling him a Priest-catching knave, commanded the
Pursevants not to keep company with him, for if they did he would displace
them, and pull their Messengers coats over their ears; denied to employ others
as Messengers to apprehend Priests and Jesuits, because, he said, they were too
hot and zealous in that service; yea, he suffered all manner of popish Books to
be imported, to seduce his Majesty's Subjects, restored them to their owners,
when seized by the searchers, contrary to an express Statute, concealed some
of their most desperate plots, treasons, discouraging, menacing the Witnesses
that revealed them: To evidence all this, we shall produce our witnesses, who
testified upon oath as follows:

James Waddesworth Gent. of Saint Dunstans parish in the west, London, deposed
both in writing and viva voce at the Lords Bar, That one Henry Smith, alias
Loyd, a dangerous Priest and Jesuit, before the beginning of the Scottish
Wars, did cell him in Norfolk (where he met him) That the popish Religion
was not to be brought in here by disputing or Books of controversy, but with
an Army and with fire and sword; NOTE.
that he has often times since met the said Smith, going (as he told him) to
see the Archbishop of Canterbury, who (as he said) was a good man, and loved
them well; that himself was about eight years since, imprisoned above three
years space in several prisons, only for calling a Priest Traitor, and for
apprehending Priests: During which time of his imprisonment, the said Smith
came three or four times to visit him, in the name of the Archbishop, the Lord
Cottington, and Secretary Windebanke, and told him, That if he would adjure the
Realm, and never prosecute Priests more, he should have a Warrant under the
Kings hand to release him, which he refusing at that time, he was afterward
released out of prison, but upon this promise, never to prosecute NOTE.
priests again: And when he was thus enlarged, one Davis brought him four pound
in money from the said Archbishop (as he told him) toward the payment of his
fees. And he further deposed, that he has often met Father Price a Priest,
Superior of the English Benedictines, and Father Leander a Benedictine Monk
and Priest, going (as themselves said and confessed) to Lambeth to the
Archbishop, to see and speak with him, which they often times spoke in a vanting
manner; and that Leander was commonly reported to have been the Archbishops
Chamber-fellow in Oxford: That Smith, alias Loyd the Jesuit, did usually meet
at the Lord Cottingtons house in Breadstreet, at a Juncto every Friday night;
where were usually present, the said Lord, Sir Toby Matthew, the Spanish
Ambassador, Sir Arthur Hopton, Endimion Porter, James Hammond a great Papist,
and Secretary Windebank: Which Juncto sometimes met at Sir Arthur Hoptons house
in the Pallace-Yard at Westminster.

Francis Newton of Saint Giles Creplegate London, Gent. deposed both in writing
and by word of mouth at the Lords Bar, that he by virtue of a general Warrant
from the Lords of the Counsel for the apprehending of Jesuits and popish
Priests (among others, apprehended one Henry Morse, a grand Jesuit, and great
seducer of his Majesty's Subjects, who had perverted 500. persons in and about
London, as appeared by certificats at his Trial, who being like to be
discharged before his Trial, this Deponent by the appointment of Secretary
Cook, the Lord Keeper Coventry, and Lord Privy-Seale, repaired to Lambeth to
the Archbishop, to desire him to give this Deponent order, that the said Morse
might not be discharged, they saying, it is now time to look about us, so many
being seduced by one person: Whereupon he repairing to Lambeth, desired Master
Dell, the Archbishops Secretary, to help him to speak with the Archbishop from
these Lords, about the Priests discharge: Master Dell answered, that the
Archbishop was busy with Sir Toby Matthews, (commonly reputed a Jesuit, and an
arch-intelligencer of Rome) in the Garden, and this Deponent being earnest with
Master Dell to have an answer from the Archbishop to return to the Lords, he
brought answer from him, That the Deponent should bring him the next day before
the Councell-boo^d, and sent Dell the next morning to Master Secretary Cook,
to know, whether he had sent the Deponent to him or no. After which the said
Priest being sent to Newgate, and arraigned upon two Bills found against him,
was by Order form the King, put by his judgment, and soon after released. He
further dep^sed, that one Henry Loyd, alias Francis Smith, alias Rivers, alias
Sin^us; (Provincial of the Jesuits, and a chief actor in the
Gunpowder-treason, as this deponent was informed by one Stukely a Priest, who
bid this deponent remember him of 5. die Novembris, meaning the Gunpowder-plot)
was by the Deponent and one Tho: Mayo, Indicted and Out-lawd of High Treason;
and afterward being protected by Secretary Windebank from the arrests of
Messengers, this Deponent oftentimes meeting of him in the streets on horsback,
and telling him, that a sledg and three horses were fitter for him then one
horse to ride on; he replied some two or three times, when the Deponent used
these speeches, holding up his finger; well Newton, you rogue, I have done your
arrand to my Lords grace of Cant. already, and shall do it to Secr. Windebank
also. And he deposed, that he has seen the said Jesuit once at Lambeth-house,
and there entertained by Mr Del the Archb Secretary, in a room near the
Archbishops Study, where being in familiar conference with the said Mr Del, he
did whisper to him, and often cast an eye toward this Depont as if he were
speaking of him. He likewise further deposed, that he has often times seen the
said Smith the Jesuit at Secr. Windebanks house, talking very familiarly with
him, and clapping him on the back, and that he met diverse times sundry of the
imprisoned popish Priests, freely walking without a keeper in Grays-Inne walks,
and in other places, and that they lay abroad out of prison in Town and in the
Country many weeks together, and he has gone into the Newprison and Clinck
where there were about 20 Priests imprisoned, and found not above one or two
there.

Richard D^unel Gent. deposed upon oath, that he being a prisoner in the
Newprison some years since, the Priests and Jesuits committed thither by the
Archbi. had the best rooms in the prison, a Cook, Steward and common table, at
which they dicted al together, Mass said in their chambers, diverse Ladies and
Gentlemen in ^^^ches frequently visiting them without restraint, and great
store of Venison sent them in its season, when as Mr Huntly and other godly
Ministers there imprisoned by the Archb. were thrust into the worst lodgings,
denied liberty to di^^ together, and were not suffered to go out of prison
upon any occasion, but with a costly keeper attending on them, though they had
given bond for their true imprisonment, neither had their friends free access
to them, but were many times questioned and restrained.

Thomas Mayo a Messenger, of Saint Andrews Holborne, testified upon Oath, That
about nine years since, the Archbishop of Canterbury, having committed one John
Evans a Minister to the Gate House, for printing of Bills, setting forth the use
of the Antimonial Cup, he did thereupon repair with a Petition in his behalf,
to the Archbishops house at Lambeth, where he then saw Master Henry Moore, and
Henry Loyd, alias Smith, two dangerous Jesuits, in the great Chamber above
stairs, near the Archbishops Study, waiting there, as he conceives, to speak
with the said Archbishop, and very familiarly entertained in discourse by
Master Dell, who carried himself very respectively toward them, which he well
remembers, for that he then delivered an Antimoniall Cup to the said Master
Dell to be delivered to the Archbishop from Master Evans: And he further
deposed, that he has often seen Sir Toby Matthewes (whom this Deponent has
seen in Saint John's College in Lovain in Brabant, who there was reputed a
Jesuit) at Lambeth house, and there walking in a friendly manner with the said
Archbishop, and at other times has seen Sir Toby riding with him in his Coach
(once in NOTE.
the Strand) and passing with him in his Barge from White Hall to Lambeth; that
he often assisting other Messengers to discover and apprehend Priests, and
finding some neglect in them in that service, did thereupon desire the said
Archbishop, That he might have a Warrant for himself to apprehend Priests and
Jesuits: To which the said Archbishop answered, You are too hot and nimble for
that service, saying, NOTE.
He had Messengers enough already, and refused to grant his request: And
withal by order from the said Archbishop, he was employed to attend popish
Ambassadors houses, Denmark-house, and the Popes Nuncioes Lodging, to view and
return unto him the number of popish Priests and Recusants which resorted
thither to Mass; which accordingly he did every Monday, for the space of half
a year and more, giving the Archbishop a Certificate of their number and
quality; but he never received any order from him to apprehend any of them, nor
saw any fruit or reformation thereof: That he having a special Warrant from
the said Archbishop and others of the high Commission, to apprehend one Peter
Wilford, a Priest, (condemned since the Parliament, and now in Newgate) and
apprehending him by virtue thereof, he brought him before this Archbishop to
his Chamber in White Hall, who sent this Deponent word by NOTE.
Sir John Lamb, that he would not meddle with him; and the said Wilford having
a Protection from Secretary Windebank which he showed the Deponent, was
thereupon discharged by the said Archbishops direction, signified by Sir John
Lamb.

Elizabeth Gray of Saint Margarets Westminster, Widow, deposed, That her late
husband, John Gray, being a Messenger to the Lords of the Counsel, and having
a Warrant from them to apprehend Jesuits and Seminary Priests; the said Gray by
virtue of that Warrant, apprehended one Fisher, alias Persey, a grand Jesuit,
and acquainted Master Secretary Cook therewith, whereupon he was committed
prisoner to the Gate House, there to remain until he should put in security
to depart the Realm, and never to return again: Soon after which, the said
Gray and one John Cook (as the Deponent was often informed by them) meeting
the said Fisher walking in the streets, apprehended him; whereupon he showed a
Warrant of Secretary Windebanks, requiring that no Messenger should apprehend
the said Fisher, nor search the house or houses where he should frequent; upon
which Gray discharged him, and repairing to Secretary Cook acquainted him with
the said Jesuits protection; who thereupon commanded Gray and Cook to repair
to this Archbishop of Canterbury, and acquaint him with the premises; who
thereupon went to Lambeth, and desired Master Dell the Archbishops Secretary,
to acquaint the Archbishop therewith, as from Master Secretary Cook, and to
grant them a Warrant to apprehend the said Fisher: To which Master Dell
replied, That he was an idle fellow, and bade him move the whole Board for it,
For his Lord would grant no such Warrant: Whereupon Gray replied, Lord have
mercy upon is all, I see how the game goes now, I hope to see better days.

For which words, the said Gray was sent for the next day before the Counsel,
upon the complaint of the said Archbishop, and committed prisoner to the Fleet
for the same: Whereupon this Deponent exhibited many Petitions to the said
Archbishop, and the whole Board for her said husbands release, to which she
could get no answer; and one day she presenting a Petition to the said
Archbishop in the stone Gallery at Whitehall, for her Husbands enlargement, he
looking upon the same, and seeing the said Grayes name therein, flung it away
in an angry manner, saying, he would have nothing to do with a Priest-catching
knave. By means whereof, her said Husband continued a prisoner in the Fleet
for two and twenty weeks, and could not be released (as Master Read Secretary
Windebanks Secretary, told this Deponent) till such time as he should give Bond
and Bail, never to apprehend Priests and Jesuits more.

The next day she going to Secretary Windebank for her Husbands release, Master
Read (his Secretary) demanded, where his said Bond and Bail was? To which she
answered, That some Gentlemen in the Fleet said, That in requiring such Bond
and Bail, they incurred a Praemunire: To which the said Master Read replied,
That the said Gentlemen and the Deponent deserved to be sent to Newgate for
these speeches: And Secretary Windebank himself taking exception at the said
speeches, gave Order, after the said Gray had his Discharge, That he should
stay in prison till every penny of his Fees were paid.

That a little before this her said Husbands trouble, upon his apprehending of
a Priest or Jesuit, from whom he took good store of Books, to the value of an
hundred pounds; the said Archbishop commended it for a good piece of service,
and willed him to bring the said Books to his House at Lambeth, and he would
well recompense him: But he receiving and keeping the Books, never gave him any
recompense.

John Goldsmith deposed, that about four years since, he being in the
High Commission Court at Lambeth, the Archbishop before the Court sat, called
all the Messengers of the Court to him, and charged them to take heed that they
kept not company with one Gray, A PRIEST-CATCHER, against whom Secretary
Windebank had made a complaint at the Counsel Table for discovering Priests;
and told them, that if he heard that any of them had any more to do with him,
he would not only LAY THEM BY THE HEELS, BUT LIKEWISE PULL THEIR COATS OFF
FROM THEIR BACKS, AND TURN THEM OUT OF THEIR PLACES. And he further deposed,
that he did complain and indite a Papist for saying, THAT OUR RELIGION WAS
SPURD OUT OF KING HENRY THE EIGTH HIS COD^IECE; whereupon the Papist prosecuted
him in the High Commission for a defamation.

John Cook of Rederosse-street, London, deposed, That John Gray a Messenger,
had a Warrant from the Lords of the Counsel Table, for the apprehending of
Priests and Jesuits: And that the said Gray and this Deponent by virtue
thereof, did apprehend one Father Fisher, alias Piersey, a grand Jesuit, and
brought him before Master Secretary Cook, who wished us to bring him before
the Counsel Table the next sitting, which we did accordingly in Anno 1634. And
after his Examination there, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Secretary Cook
went to the King, to know his pleasure what should be done with him: Who
returning to the Board, the Archbishop delivered the Kings pleasure to this
effect:

Master Fisher kneel down upon your knees every morning and every evening,
and pray for the King for granting you your life: And to be short, Master
Fisher, his Majesty's pleasure is, that you shall be forthwith banished this
Kingdom, and all at her his Majesty's Dominions; and you shall remain
prisoner in the Gate House, until you put in good security before the Kings
Attorney, Sir John Banks, never to return again. Whereunto Fisher replied: If
he had a hundred lives, be would come hither again, or elsewhere, if his
Superior so commanded him; and utterly refused to put in any security.

Whereupon the Board sent him to the Gate House, there to remain until he
should put in such security as aforesaid.

Whereupon, about four months after, the said Gray and the Deponent met the
said Fisher in Holborn, and demanding of him the reason of his going abroad; he
replied, We were Rogues, what was that to us; and showed us a Warrant under the
hand of Secretary Windebank for his enlargement: Whereupon Gray and this
Deponent went to Lambeth to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and endeavored to
acquaint him by Master Dell his Secretary, that Fisher had a Warrant from
Master Secretary Windebank for his liberty, and desired to know the Archbishops
pleasure therein: But Master Dell made answer, That his Lord would NOTE.
not meddle with such trifling matters: Whereupon Gray said, He hoped to see
better days, for he saw now how the game went: The next day after, Gray was
sent for by a Messenger to the Counsel Table, and then the Archbishop said at
the Table, This fellow railed on me, and bid them have him away; whereupon Gray
was committed to the Fleet, where he lay twelve weeks upon the Archbishops
complaint, and after that, seven weeks more by Secretary Windebanks Warrant,
who refused to release him, unless he would give bond and bail, never to
prosecute Priests and Jesuits more. NOTE.
He further deposed, that in his hearing, one Loyd a dangerous Jesuit, desired
Sir Kenelm Digby to tell the Bishop of Canterbury, that he could not that day
dine with him, and bid him remember his love to the Archbishop, and desire him
NOTE.
to be mindful of the business that they and he had formerly speech about:
And that he has often seen the said Loyd, Sir Kenelm Digby, Sir Toby Matthews,
and one Gray a great Papist, at Lambeth at the Archbishops house.

Master Thomas Thacher of Barkin Parish, London, attested upon Oath, That he
having a Warrant from the High Commissioners to apprehend popish Priests and
Jesuits, did by virtue thereof apprehend Master Henry Morse a Jesuit, and one
Gardener a Priest, great seducers, who being committed to Newgate, were soon
after discharged thence by Secretary Windebank's Warrant; to whom he repairing
for his fees; the said Secretary demanding a sight of his Warrant, which he
showed, detained it from him, and would not restore the same: Whereupon he
repaired to the Archbishop, and desired of him a new Warrant to apprehend
Priests and Jesuits; who thereupon told him, That Secretary Windebank had
complained of this Deponent to the Queen, and demanded of him if he kept not
NOTE.
company with one Gray, who gave him intelligence of the persons and lodgings
of Priests and Jesuits, and wished him not to keep company with him any more,
for if he did, he would lay him by the heels, and turn him out of his Place. He
further deposed, that he having a special Warrant from the Lords of the
Counsel for the apprehending of Sir Toby Matthew, a dangerous Papist; and
apprehending him accordingly, the late Lord Strafford Deputy of Ireland, sent
for this Deponent to bring Sir Toby to him, which he did; who thereupon
discharged Sir Toby by word of mouth, and promised to save the Deponent
harmless, who thereupon repairing to the Archbishop, acquainted him therewith,
the Archbishop said, it is well, I shall speak with him anon.

John Egerton of the Minories, deposed, That he being at Lambeth-house upon
occasion, did see Sir Toby Matthew there two several times with the
Archbishop; That he being one of the Searchers of the Custom-house in London,
did on the 28. of December 1633. seize four hundred Popish books in English,
written by one Jews of Puente a Jesuit, with diverse popish Primmers and
Catechismes, brought over from beyond the Seas, to seduce his Majesty's
Subjects, contrary to the statute of 3 -Jacobis cap. 5. which gives the
forfeiture of 40s. for every Book so imported, against the Importers of them:
Which Books he carried to the now Archbishop of Canterbury, who commanded him
to deliver them to Master Mottershead, Register of the High Commission; which
he did: and that about a fortnight after, he coming to the said Mottershead,
to demand satisfaction for his pains and charge in seizing the said Books, and
demanding of him where the said Books were? he answered and affirmed to the
Deponent, That he had delivered them to the owners of them by the Archbishops
direction and command; NOTE.
and Motteshead appointed him only forty shillings for his pains, when the
charge he had been at in carrying them from place to place, cost him five
pounds: After which he was troubled in the High Commission for importing
English Bibles, and there put from his Searchers place, imprisoned and fined
two hundred pounds, when as the Importers of popish books were never questioned.

In the year 1640. May 16. upon the Letter of Doctor Thomas Weeks, Chaplain
both to the Archbishop, and Bishop of London, there were eleven Cases of popish
Books, belonging to one John Weld, a Popish Recusant and others, delivered out
of the Custom-house, where they were seized, to the owners to be dispersed, to
seduce his Majesty's people, contrary to the Statute, as Master Jones, Master
Dent, and others of the Custom-house, attested under their hands: Viz. Holy
Courts 456. Key of Paradise 603. Manuels 661. The life of Eleazar Count of
Sabri^ 259. The following of Christ 116. Popish Catechismes 344. dozens; Fronts
for Altars 39. Ladies Psalters 24. The Mirror of new Reformation 134. Offices
of our Lady 558. Mass books 9. and two great ones more; The Devout heart 101.
Vade Mecum 276. A Method to serve our Lady 570. Most of these were very richly
bound up, and some of them delivered to Knight the Register of the High
Commission, by the Archbishops order, and by him restored to the owners; when
as on the contrary, he was very strict in seizing all puritanicall Books, and
punishing the dispersers of them; witness this his subscription to the
Petition of one Francis Wallis Gentleman, who complaining to him against one
Thomas Abbis of London, for selling and transporting beyond the Seas, an
Abstract of the Laws of New England, The whole proceedings against Doctor
Bastwick, Master Burton, and Master Prynne, and against the Bishop of Lincoln,
the Archbishop subscribed it in this sort.

I desire Sir John Lamb to be very careful of this business, and that he
employ a trusty and discreet Messenger for the apprehending of the party here
complained of, and seizing his Books, and let me have an account thereof.

March 14. 1637. W. CANT.


For the Archbishops intimacy with Doctor Smith the Bishop of Calcedon, we have
no direct proof at hand, but two very suspicious passages in his own Diary,
which seem to intimate it, wherein we read as follows: Jan. 26. 1631. My
nearer acquaintance began to settlewith D^. S. I pray God bless us in it. June
25. 1632. Do. S. with me, etc. Cum Ma. Which Do. S. we conceive to signify,
either Smith the Arch-Jesuit, of whose familiarity with him the former
witnesses have deposed; or Doctor Smith Bishop of Calcedon, with whom, if not
this Archbishop, yet his Minion Secretary Windebank at least, held strict
intelligence, as appears by this Original Letter to his Son at Paris, under
his own Hand and Seal, found among his sequestered Papers by MASTER PRYNNE.

TOm, etc. If you see Doctor Smith Bishop of Calcedon there, who is a great
Confident of the Cardinals, he may be A FIT INSTRUMENT TO MAKE SOME DISCOVERY
OF THE INTELLIGENCE THE SCOTS NOTE.
HOLD THERE: but this must be done with great caution.

Your very loving Father, FRANCIS WINDEBANK.
Drury Lane December. 12. 1630.

The benefit of this intelligence being principally to redound to the
Archbishop, the original cause and grand fomenter of the Scottish Wars, it is
most probable, this advice proceeded originally from him, and his interest in
this popish Bishop.

Before we make any special application of the preceding testimonies and
evidence, we shall only manifest what a most pernicious, seducing, dangerous
Priest and Jesuit, this Sir Toby Matthew (with whom the Archbishop so
familiarly conversed) was at that very time.

Andreas ab Habernfiela's Discovery of the Plot of Treason against the King,
sent from Sir William Boswel to the Archbishop himself, gives this true
Character of him: See Romes Masterpiece, page 19, 20.
Sir Toby Matthew a Priest and Jesuit, of the Order of Politicians, a most
vigilant man, one of the primest heads, to whom a bed was never so dear, that
he would rest his head thereon, refreshing his body with sleep in a chair for
an hour or two, spares his match inations neither day nor night; a man
principally noxious, and the very plague of the King and Kingdom of England; a
most impudent man, who flies to all Banquets and Feasts, called or uncalled,
never quiet, always in action and perpetual motion, thrusting himself into
all meetings of Superiors, urges conferences familiarly, that be may fish out
the minds of men: whatever he observes thence, that may bring any commodity or
discommodity to the part of the Conspirators, he communicates to the Popes
Legate, the more secret things he himself writes to the Pope, or to Cardinal
Barbarino. In fine, he adjoynes himself to any Company; no word can be spoken
that he will not lay hold on and accommodate to his party: In the mean time,
what he has fished out, he reduces into a Catalogue, and in the Summer
carries it to the general Consistory of the Jesuits Politics, which secretly
meets together in the Province of Wales, where he is an acceptable Guest: There
Counsels are secretly hammered, which are most meet for the convulsion of the
Ecclesiasticke and Politic State of both Kingdoms.

Yea, this most sedulous promoter of the Popes designs, for his dexterity,
experience and sedulity in mannaging his Holiness affairs in England, was in
such extraordinary favor with the Pope, that by a Special Bull he committed
his last Nuncio, Count Rossetti (being but young) to his tutelage and direction,
as to his Angle Guardian; hoping, that his Nuncio assisted by his Counsels,
would produce no small fruits to the Catholic Church IN A SHORT TIME, SPACE,
and NOTE.
through the help of the female Amazons there RESTORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE SEA
APOSTOLIC IN THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND, which by oceasion of one woman (Queen
ELIZABETH) was there suppressed. The Copy whereof (found among Secretary
Windebankes papers) being very material, was read at the Bar: In which Bull
the Pope himself gives him this Title: A sufficient evidence that Sir Toby was
both a Jesuit and Priest too.

Datum Romae apud S. Petrum, sub annulo Piscatoris, pridie idus Maii.
By all these premised Testimonies and Evidences, it is most fully proved, as
far as is possible for us to go, unless we had the very Popish Priests and
Jesuits themselves here personally present to be examined (who would be very
unwilling to discover any thing against their Arch-Patriot upon Oath.)

First, that this Archbishop held familiarity and correspondency with sundry
notorious Priests and Jesuits forementioned, employed as Agents by the Papists
to reduce and reconcile us unto Rome; who were oft-times seen at
Lambeth-house, near his Study, and publicly boasted of their recourse to, and
favor with him.

Secondly, that Sir Toby Matthew, the most dangerous seducing Priest and
Jesuit of all others, was most intimately familiar with him, and oft-times
seen with him both in his Coach, his Barge, his Garden, his House, and a
frequent Guess at his Table: and Saint Giles, a most pernicious Priest,
maintained by him in the University of Oxford to seduce the Doctors and
Students there to Popery.

Thirdly, that he was very coldin the prosecution of Priests and Jesuits; and
if at any time he imprisoned them for a show to gull the vulgar people, it was
only in the Clinke or New Prison (not Newgate or any County Goal,) where they
were protected, secured against all Legal prosecutions, had the best Lodgings,
a common Steward, Cook, Table, very good fare, great resort of all sorts of
people, daily Masses, and free liberty to walk and stay abroad at pleasure
without a Keeper, as freely as any man might walk out of his own House. Yea,
such was his indulgence toward them (though Arch-Traytors by our Laws) that
in his Epistle Dedicatory to the King himself, before his Relation of a
Conference with Fisher the Jesuit, he makes this profession of it in Print,
not only to his Majesty, but to the whole world, in these words which were
read at the Bar.

In which Speech give me leave to observe to your Sacred Majesty, how
grievously you suffer him (Master Fisher) and his Fellows to be persecuted for
the Catho, like Faith, when your poor Subject and servant cannot set our, A
true Copy of a Conference held with the Jesuit, Jussu Superiorum; but by and
by this man is persecuted. GOD FORBID I SHOULD EVER OFFER TO PERSUADE A
PERSECUTION IN ANY KIND, OR PRACTICE IT IN THE LEAST: (to ^it, (...), Popish
Priests and Jesuits, of whom only he there intended it:) For (...) HAVE NOT
GIVEN HIM OR HIS SO MUCH AS COVERSE LANGVAGE.

Behold from his own pen what a most mild and favorable ^^^end he was to
Jesuits and Roman Priests! He never persuaded any persecution against them in
any kind, or practiced it in the lest; adding an absit, God forbid that he
should ever offer it: But yet on the contrary, did he not persuade a
persecution in every kind, and practice it in the bighest degree against the
most zealous Protestant Ministers, Gentlemen who opposed his and their popish
designs, by exciting his Majesty and the whole State against them, even in this
very Epistle, yea, in his printed Speech in Star Chamber, at the censure of
Master Prynne, Master Burton, and Doctor Bastwick, and in his Epistle
Dedicatory to the King, thereto prefixed? all mere persuasions, excitements to
persecution in the extremest degree; Nay, did he not most cruelly practice the
same in the severest manner upon sundry of them, by adjudging them to the
Pillory, fining them beyond their estates, cutting off their ears, slitting
their noses, branding their cheeks with hot irons, whipping them through the
streets, shutting them up close prisoners in nasty dungeons, banishing them
into remote Islands, there to be perpetually imprisoned al their lives, so
strictly, that neither Wives, children, kindred, friends, must have the least
access unto them, nor yet set footing in the Islands to visit or relieve them?
yea, deprive them of Pen, Ink, Paper to write unto their friends for
necessaries, or Petition for release; intercept all Letters and relief sent to
them, and deprive them of the use of all Books to pass their time, except the
Bible, Common-Prayer-Booke, Doctor Cozens, and such like Books of private
devotion? And did he not persecute hundreds of other godly Ministers, yea raise
up a general persecution against them throughout the Kingdom, and drive
sundry of them, with many thousands of religious, godly people out of the
Kingdom into foreign Plantations among Savages and Indian heathens? Nay, did
he not all this and more whiles he had any power, notwithstanding God himself
did forbid it? And whereas he writes, That to his remembrance be never gave
this Jesuit, or any of his, so much as course language: he was so far from
using such civility to our godly Protestant Ministers, Gentlemen, and others
who most opposed Popery and Popish Innovations; that his mouth was full of most
bitter railing Invectives, Satyrs, revilings against them, not only in his
private Chamber when ever convented before him, but even in his public
Speeches in the Starchamber and High Commission; witness his printed Speech in
Starchamber before mentioned, with his Epistle to it; nay, in this very Epistle
to the King, he thus railes upon them in downright terms; How I have been
used by the scandalous and scurrilous pens of some bitter men, the world
knows: little leisure and less encouragement given me, whiles I am under the
Prophets affliction, Psalm. 50. between the mouth that speaks wickedness, and
the tongue that sets forth deceit, and slander me as thick as if I were not
their own mothers son. In the midst of these libellous outcries against me,
etc. Factious people at home, etc. And not content to rail at them himself in
Speech and Print, he set his creatures everywhere to revile and rail most
libellously against them in Press and Pulpit; witness Doctor Heylins and
Christipher Doves books against Master Burton, written and printed by this
Archbishops command, Doctor Pocklintons and Bishop Mountagues Books forecited;
Bishop Whites Epistle before his Discourse of the Sabbath, Doctor Heylins
History of the Sabbath, and Antidotum Lincolniense, with infinite Sermons, full
of gall, vinegar, and most libellous railings against Puritans, and the most
zealous Protestant without the least invective against Priests, Pope, or
Jesuits; Therefore his grand addition, his favorable dealing with Priests and
Jesuits on the one side, compared with his most harsh persecutions and
libellous invectives against their (...) are most pregnant evidences for what
party he stood, and whose (...) most cordially drived on.

Fourthly, that the Archbishop contrary to his Trust, Oath, Place and duty,
both as an Archbishop, a Privy Counselor and high Commissioner, did not only
favor Seminary Priests and Jesuits, though traitors by Law, but discourage,
discountenance those Officers appointed by the State to apprehend them; telling
Thomas Mayo, that he was too hot and nimble for that service; threatening Master
Thatcher to lay him by the heels, and turn him out of his place, if he kept
NOTE.
company with Gray, who gave him intelligence of the persons and lodgings of
Priests and Jesuits; threatening all the Messengars of the high Commission
openly in Court, that if they kept company with Gray (whom he called A
PRIEST-CATCHER) he would not only lay them by the heels, but likewise
pull-their Coats from off their backs, and turn them out of their places: That
he caused Gray to be committed to the Fleet above twelve weeks for apprehending
Priests, and the words forementioned, yea threw away his Petition, saying, He
would have nothing to do with that PRIST-CATCHING KNAVE: nay, he and Master
Waddesworth must not be released out of Prison till they would promise never to
apprehend or prosecute Priests or Jesuits more. A most clear demonstration,
that he not only had correspondency and intelligence with Priests and Jesuits,
but likewise was their Arch-protector, their grand friend, insomuch that Smith
the Jesuit openly threatened Master Newton in the streets, That he had done his
errand to the Archbishop.

Now we appeal to all the world, whether ever any real Protestant Prelat
showed himself such a Patriot of Priests and Jesuits in this kind as he? or
whether the Pope himself could have done more in their behalf then he did,
had he sat Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth-house. It was one chief Article
of the Privy Counsels and Judges charge against Cardinal Woolsey, presented to
King Henry the eighth: That he had been the impeacher and disturber of due and
direct correction Cooks 4. Inst. p. 94.
of Errors and Heresies, by reason whereof, they crept more abroad, and took
greater place, being highly to the danger and peril of the whole body, and
good Christian people of this Realm: All which this Archbishop is guilty in an
higher measure, in respect of Popery, Priests and Jesuits, then ever this
Cardinal was, in regard of the Lutheran Sect and Opinions.

Fifthly, it is evident that the Archbishop had a hand in assisting the Papists
Priests and Jesuits, in the dispersing of their popish Books, to seduce his
Majesty's Subjects, contrary to an express Statut; whereas he used all
possible diligence to suppress the printing, dispersing, importing Orthodox
Books (and those he styled Puritannicall) both at home and beyond the Seas.

Finally, the Archbishop complied with the Papists, Priests, Jesuits, in
concealing their very treasonable plots and conspiracies against the King,
Kingdom, Church; and all professors of the Protestant Religion; we shall
instance but in two particulars. The first is in the case of Mistress Anne
Hussy, who deposed at the Lords Bar to this effect: That William O Conner an
Irish Priest, servant to the Queen Mother, soon after Easter, in the year 1640.
among other discourses, told her, at the house of one Master Hill, near the
Strand in Westminster, That there were many private houses about London,
wherein they used to have Mass said, that there were 7000. men in private pay
ready to aid the Catholics, and to NOTE.
cut the Protestants throats that should resist them.

After which, he coming to her in great haste, at Mistress Pinocks house
about the end of July 1640. told her, That he was then in great haste, for he
had Letters from the Queen Mother, to be delivered to three Ambassadors, the
Spanish, the Venetian, the French, to send to the Pope, to know from himself
or his Legate, when to begin the subduing of the Protestants; that the Queen his
Lady was no fool, and that if the King joined with the Protestants, they would
cut him off, if not by the sword, yet by some other way; that if no other hand
would do it, his hand should kill the King; and that he would kill an Heretic
at any time, for the advancement of the Mother Church of Rome, swearing by
Saint Francis and Saint Dominick, that he would do it. All which he spoke to
her in Irish, she counterfeiting her self to be a Roman Catholic, desirous to
become a Nun: He likewise confessed, That he had been a servant long to the
Queen Mother, and employed by her in business to all the Princes of
CHRISTENDOM.

Whereupon she according to her duty and alleagiance, complained of this
Priest, revealing this discomse and treason of his to the Lords of the Privy
Counsel, attesting her information upon oath, and producing a Letter of this
Priests to her under his own hand, with some other witnesses to confirm her
testimony in point of circumstance of time, place, and this Priests resort unto
her; But the Archbishop of Canterbury to discourage and take her off from this
discovery, reviled and gave her many ill words and threats, told her she was
mad, NOTE:
and that she was hired by the Londoners to make this accusation; demanding,
how she durst be so bold as to utter or discover ought which had any the least
reflection upon the Queen Mother? threatening to have her punished, and caused
her to be committed to one of the Sheriffs of Londons house; whereas the other
Lords gave her good words, and committed the Priest to the Gate House, and so
the business was smothered, without further prosecution, till she revived it
this Parliament in the Commons House, who released her of her restraint.

We shall close all with the most desperate plot of Cardinal Barbarino, the Sea Romes Masterpiece.
Popes Nuncio, the society of the English and Scottish Jesuits, with their
confederates, to subvert the Protestant Religion, usher in Popery, raise a
War between England and Scotland, subvert the government both of Church and
State, yea, to poison the King himself if he crossed this design, and then to
seize and train up the Prince in the Popish (...).

This plot being discovered at first only in generally, by a chief Actor in it,
(sent from Rome) to Andreas ab Habernfield, and Sir Will. Boswell, and by them
by Letters from the Hague to the Archbishop; he conceiving it to be a plot only
of the Puritanes to destroy the King and himself too, revealed it to the King,
and prosecuted the further discovery with all earnestness, as appears by
sundry Original Lett^ers concerning it, seized and attested by Master Prynne,
produced at the Bar. But no sooner received he the large particular discovery
of it, which fastened the treason only upon Cardinal Barbarino, the Popes
Nuncio, the Jesuits with their confederates, Sir Toby Matthew, Sir Kenelme
Digby, Sir John Winter, Endimion Porter, Secretary Windebanke, Master Walter
Mountague, the Countess of Arundel, and others, but he presently smothered it;
yea though he received the full discovery of it, but on the 14. of October
1640. not many days before the beginning of this present Parliament, yet he he
never revealed it to both or either Houses of Parliament, or any members
thereof for the preservation of our Religion, Church, State, King thereby, and
the executing condign punishment on these Arch-traitos and Conspirators, then
present in London and Westminster, nor yet so much as disclosed it, when Sir
Toby Matthew, Sir John Winter, and others were questioned in the Commons House,
about the Popish Parliament kept in London, and the levying of moneys against
the Scots, among the Papists; nor when Secretary Windebank was questioned for
releasing Priests and Jesuits against Law, and the negotiation of the Popes
Nuncio debated in the Commons House, but concealed these papers from the
Parliaments knowledge, till Master Prynne unexpectedly seized them in the
Archbishops Cabinet in the Tower of London.

From all which particulars, we conceive we have abundantly manifested, most
substantially proved his correspondency, confederacy with the Pope and his
instruments of all sorts, in their most desperate treasons, to extirpate our
Religion, introduce popery, reconcile, reduce the Church of England to the
Church of Rome, and most satisfactorily justified, the first Branch of our
charge of high treason against him in every particular; whereupon we most humbly
pray, in the name of the Commons of England, the Judgment of an Arch-traitor to
be given against him, as one who has declared himself a professed Traitor, not
only to our Laws, Liberties, Parliament, Kingdoms, but to our very Religion,
Church, souls, the highest treason of all others, especially in a Clergyman, an
Archbishop of Canterbury, who is by title, office, Primate and Metropolitan of
all England, yea Confessor, chief Curate, and Ecclesiastical Vicegerent to
the King himself, who entrusted him wholly, if not solely, with the care of
our Religion, which he has most perfidiously undermined, betrayed sundry
ways, as all the premises demonstrate.

The Archbishops several ANSWERS To the Proofs and Evidence produced to make
good the first Branch of his CHARGE, with the Commons Replies, and Rejoynders
thereunto.
WE have now presented you with the entire evidence of the Commons given in
against the Archbishop at the Lords Tribunal, in proof of the first main Branch
of his impeachment, to wit, his traitorous endeavors to subvert the true
Religion established among us, to introduce and set up Popery, and reconcile us
unto Rome, without any diminution, to which I have here and there made some
small Additions, not by way of evidence or charge, but only of illustration or
amplification of some things given in evidence in the general, briefly pointed
at and so passed over, not read at large at the bar for want of time.

We shall next as faithfully, as exactly as our imperfect notes, and frail
memory will assist, relate his several Answers and Replies given to the
particular proofs produced against him, both as he delivered them in person
after each days evidence at the Lords bar, and as he afterward repeated them
in his general defense, with some Additions, in the Lords and Commons House;
wherein if I have involuntarily mistaken or misreported his words or answers in
any particular as I presume I have not done, his surviving friends must only
blame either him, or themselves, not me, who used all the means I could to his
Secretary Mr. Dell, his Council, and others whom he trusted with his Papers, to
procure his own Original written Notes, Answers, and Replies, or true Copies of
them; that so I might have printed them verbatim, to avoid all calumnies and
mistakes; yet could neither by my own entreaties, nor warrants from Authority
procure them, or any Copies thereof: Mr. Dell returning me this answer, that he
believed the Archbishop himself had burnt all his Notes and Answers in his life
time, to prevent their publication after his death.

To avoid prolixity, obscurity, that every Reader may more clearly discern the
insufficiency, falsehood, Sophistry of his Answers, and the pregnancy of the
Commons proofs, and evidence to make good their impeachment against him in each
particular; I shall forbear to relate his Answers and the Commons Replies
thereto, entirely together in two distinct continued Relations, as they were
delivered at the bar, but subjoyn the Commons distinct Replies to his several
Answers to each particular proof and part of their evidence, as they lie in
order; that so reddendo singula singulis, the pertinency of their evidence, and
reality of his guiltiness, may more perspicuously shine forth to all the
world, I aiming only at verity, not victory in this Relation.

The Archbishop began his Answer to the first Branch of the Commons charge,
concerning his traitorous endeavors to subvert the true Religion of God by Law
established among us, and set up Popish Superstition and Idolatry in its stead,
with a general detestation both of the charge and fact, for which presumptuous
and unseemly expression, he was justly taxed by the Commons council, as being a
defiance given to them and their proceedings, prosessing it the greatest
unhappiness that ever besel him, to be thus deeply and criminally charged by
the Honorable House of Commons (the representative body of the whole
commonalty of England) before the highest Tribunal in the Realm, as being
guilty of such a crime as this, in his last dying days, when he had one foot
already in the grave, which his own conscience pronounced him to have been
guiltless of, all the days of his life: Yet protesting it to be an
unspeakable comfort to him in this his infelicity, that he was arraigned for it
before so just, so Honorable an Assembly of Peers (many of them being privy to
the sincerity of his actions and advices to his Majesty) to vindicate his
integrity to all the world, and wash off all those black spots of calumny, of
obloquy, wherewith he had for many years bypast, been most unjustly aspersed by
Sectaries on the one hand, by Jesuits and Papists on the other, to ruin him
both in his reputation, fortune, and his Majesty's most gracious opinion. And
so presuming he had sufficiently cleared himself in the general from this heavy
charge in their Lordships and others opinions by his first days speech, the
new Canons and Oath prescribed in them and by his Book against Fisher the
Jesuit; he would without any further Prologue or Apology descend to Answer the
particular evidences, proofs, produced against him by the Commons in their
respective order, with as much brevity, perspicuity as the suddenness of his
preparations, the frailty of his memory, the burden of 70 years, with other
natural infirmities then lying heavy upon him, would permit: And to give him
his due, he made as full, as gallant, as pithy a defense of so bad a cause, and
spoke as much for himself, as was possible for the wit of man to invent, and
that with so much Art, Sophistry, Vivacity, Oratory, Audacity and confidence,
without the least blush or acknowledgement of guilt in any thing (annimated by
his seated Panders lying by him) as argued him rather obstinate, then innocent,
impudent, then penitent, a far better Orator, Sophister, then Protestant or
Christian, yea, a truer Son of the Church of Rome, then of the Church of
England in many particulars, as you will anon discern.

He began his defense, where the Commons did their charge, and they their Reply
where he began his Answer, to wit, at his public Chapel at Lambeth House.

The first thing the Commons have in their evidence charged against me, is the
setting up and repairing of Popish Images and Pictures in the glass windows of
Object. 1.
my Chapel at Lambeth; and amongst others, the Picture of Christ hanging on
the Cross between the two Thieves in the East window; of God the Father in
Form of a little old Man, with a Glory, striking Myriam with a leprosy; of the
Holy Ghost descending in Form of a Dove; and of Christ's Nativity, last Supper,
Resurrection, Ascension, and others, the Pattern whereof Master Pryn attested I
took out of the very Mass Book, wherein he showed their Portratures.

To which I answer: First, that I did not set these Images up, but found them
Answ.
there before: Secondly, That I did only repair the windows which were so
broken and the Chapel which lay so nastily before, that I was ashamed to
behold, and could not resort unto it, but with some disdain, which caused me to
repair it to my great cost: Thirdly, that I made up the History of these old
broken Pictures, not by any pattern in the Mass Book, but only by help of the
fragments and remainders of them, which I compared with the story: Fourthly,
though the very resemblances of them be in the Mass Book, yet I protest I
never knew they were there, till Master Pryn showed them in it at this bar: And
it is but a mere fallacy, the Pictures which I repaired are in the Mass Book;
Ergo, I took the pattern of them out of it: Fifthly, Master Calvin himself
allows an Historical use of Images, Just, l. 1. c. 11. Sect. 12. where thus he
writes, Neque tamenea superstitione teneor, ut nullas prorsus imagines serendas
censeam; sed quia sculptura et pictura Dei dona sunt, purum et legitimum
utriusque usum requiro: Sixthly, our Homilies themselves allow an Historical
use of Images, as appears by Page 64, 65. Seventhly, The Primitive Christians
approved, and had the Pictures of Christ himself: Tertullian recording, that
they had the Picture of Christ engraven on their Chalices in form of a Shepherd
carrying home the lost sheep on his back. Eighthly, I hope the repairing and
setting up of these Pictures is no High Treason by any Law. Ninthly, Images and
Pictures in Arras, or Glasse-Windows, are not against the Statute of 3. E. 6.
c. 10. but Statues only.

To this was replied: First, That he did not find these Images there complete
or entire, but broken and demolished by virtue of our Statutes, Homilies, Reply.
Injunctions forecited, and that at the beginning of Reformation; ever since
which time they continued unrepaired, as Monuments of our indignation and
detestation against them, like the ruins of our Abbeys and Monasteries.

Secondly, We have here confitentem reum, the Archbishop plainly confessing
that we charge him with; to wit, the repairing of the broken Images of Christ,
the Holy Ghost in Glasse-Windows; and no ways denying, extenuating, but
justifying this Popish-Fact of his against our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions,
Writers, yea, his own frequent Subscriptions to our Homilies, and Articles of
Religion, which confirm them: Nay, Mr. Brown his own Joyner, attested, that he
by the Archbishops directions, repaired and new made the broken Crucifix in
Croyden Chapel, as well as in Lambeth Chapel; and the Archbishop plainly
confesses, That he had no great devotion to serve God in Lambeth Chapel, nor
yet to resort unto it, till these Images were repaired, and now beautified to
please his eyes.

Thirdly, That himself took pains, and gave direction to the Glasiers to make
up the Stories and Pictures in the Windows, out of the broken fragments
remaining, and new made them to his excessive cost, whereas he might have new
glased them with unpainted Glass, for the tenth part of that his Painted
Pictures cost him.

Fourthly, He confesses the very portratures of the new furbished Pictures in
his Chapel to be all contained in the Masse-Book, which we made so apparent to
your Lordships, that he could not with shame deny it; but protests he knew them
not to be in it, and that he took not his pattern out of it. To which we must
reply, That he having noted his Masse-Book, wherein we showed them to be
portrayed, in every page almost with his own hand, and turning this Book so
frequently over, must of necessity see these Pictures in it, which are so large
and visible, unless we shall suppose him blind, or such an hater of them, as
purposely to turn his eyesight from them, which is improbable; And therefore,
notwithstanding this bold Protestation of his, we hold our Argument both true
and solid. The new Images in his Chappel-Windows exactly agree in all things
with the Printed ones in his Masse-Book, which he could not but know, and see
too, as often as he noted or perused his Roman Missal. Ergo, He took his pattern
from the Masse-Book in the repairing, as well as his Popish Predecessors in the
first making of them, since no other pattern has been produced by him, by which
he gave directions to new make them, but the Roman Missal.

Fifthly, We wonder greatly, that he who has so much traduced, reviled Mr.
Calvin publicly heretofore, should fly thus unto him for shelter now; but as
he abused his person and memory then, so he miserably perverts and misapplies
his words now, point blank against his meaning. Mr. Calvin only affirms, that
he is not so superstitious as to think it altogether unlawful to make any
Images of men or Beasts for a civil use, since painting is the gift of God:
From whence the Archbishop has inferred. Ergo, Mr. Calvin holds it lawful to
make the Pictures of Christ's Nativity, last Supper, Passion, Resurrection,
coming to Judgment; of God the Father, like an Old Man; of Christ on the
Cross, of God the Holy Ghost, in form of a Dove, and Cloven-Tongues, of the
Virgin -Mary, other Saints, and to set them up in Churches, as he did these
Images in his Chapel: Whereas Master Calvin in the self same place, in most
positive terms, concludes the contrary; Witness the very next words following
those he objects; Purum and legitimum utriusque usum require, ne quae Dominus
in suam gloriam, and bonum nostrum nobis contulit, ea non tantum polluantur
praepostero abusu, sed in nostram quoque perniciem convertantur. Deum effingi
visibili specie NEFAS ESSE PVTAMVS, quia id vetuit ipse, and fieri sieve aliqua
gloriae ejus deformatione non potest. Which he proves at large. Then speaking
of Images in Churches, he writes, they were introduced thither, Instit. l. 1.
c. 11. Sect. 13.
Non judicio aut delectu, sed stulta and inconfiderata cupiditate. In the very
next Section he debates the very point in question, whether it be lawful for
Christians to have any Images at all of Histories, or of men's bodies (not of
any persons in the Trinity, the very making whereof he formerly concludes to be
a great wickedness) which he thus propounds and resolves:

Verum illo quoque discrimine omisso, an ullas omnino imagines, sive quae res
gestas, sive quae hominum corpora figurent, habere in templis Christianis
expediat, obiter expendamus. Principio, si quid nos movet veteris Ecclesiae
authoritas, meminerimus quingentis circiter anuis, quibus magisadhuc florebat
religio, and syncerior doctrina vigebat, Christiana templa fuisse communiter ab
imaginibus vacua. Ergo tunc primum in ornamcutum templorum ascita sunt, quum
ministerii synceritas nonnihil degenerasset. Non disputabo ecquid rationis
habuerint qui primi suerunt ejus rei authors: verum si atatem cum aetate
conferas, videbis illos multum declinasse ab eorum integritate qui imaginibus
caruerunt. Quid? an passuros fuisse putamus sanctos illos Patres Ecclesiam
tandiu ea re carere, quam utilem ac salutarem esse judicarent? At certe quia
videbant in ea aut nihil aut minimum utilitatis, plurimum autem subesse
periculi, repudiarunt magis consilio and ratione, quam ignoratione aut
negligentia praetermiserunt. Quod etiam Augustinus claris verbis testatur, Quam
his sedibus locantur, * Epist. 49. and lib. 4. De Civitate Dei. c. 31
inquit, honorabili sublimitate, ut a praecantibus atque immolantibus

Et alibi. Hoc enim facit, and quodammodo extorquet illa figura membrorum, ut

quodos, ooulos, aures, pedes habent: quam ad corrigendam, quod non lequuntur,
neque vident, neque audiunt, neque ambulant. Haec sane videtur causa esse, cur

cavere nos voluerit. Et nos horribili insania, quae ad totius fere pietatis
interitu^ orbem ante hac occupavit, plus nimio sumus experti, simulatque in
templis collecantur imagines, quasi signum idololatriae erigi: quia sibi
temperare non potest hominum stultitia, quin protinus ad superstitiosos cult^m
delabatur. Quod si nec tantum periculi immineret, quam tumen expendo in quem
usum destinata sint templa, nescio quomodo indignum mihi videtur eorum
sanctitate, ut alias recipiant imagines quam vivas illas and iconicas, quas
verbo suo Domini^ consecravit: Baptismum intelligo and Coenam Domini, ^um aliis
ceremoniis quibus oculos nostros and studiosius detineri, and vividius affici
convenit quam ut alias hominum ingenio fabrefactas requirant. En incomperabile
imaginum bonum, quod nulla pensatione resarciri potest, si Papistis creditur.
This Author has many such like Passages in his other works; and therefore the
Archbishops citing of him to justify his Chapel Images, argues either extreme
Ignorance or Falsehood.

Sixthly, Whereas he would pray in aid from our Homilies, to justify the
Historical use of these Images in his Chapel: The Homilies are so point blank
against it, as we have proved, that Impudency it self would blush to cite them
to such a purpose, especially since the Third Part of the Homily against the
Peril of Idolatry, page 41, 42, 43. expressly resolves it unlawful to make the
picture of Christ, or any person in the Trinity, much less to set them up in
Churches.

Seventhly, That the Primitive Christians approved of Images, and had the
picture of Christ in their Churches, and engraven on their Chalices, is a most
notorious Falsehood: For Justine Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Irenaeus,
Tertullian, Minutius Felix, Origin, Arnobius, Cyprian, Lactantius, Geegory
Nyssan, Athanasius, Ambrose, Epiphanius, Eusebius, Hierome, Augustine, Hilary,
Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, and other Ancients unanimously agree, That
the Primitive Christians had no Images at all in their Churches, together with
the Councels of Eliberis, Constantinople, Toledo, Francford, and Constantine
the Great, Constantinus Caballinus, Nicephorus Stauratius, Philipicus,
Anthemius, Theodosius the second, Leo Armenus, Valens, Michael Balbus,
Theophylus, Charles the Great, with sundry other godly Emperors, utterly
demolished and cast them out of Churches, as Ecclesiastical Authors, our own

challenge, page 491.

Rutherfurds Divine Right of Church Government.


Writers prove at large against the Papsts: De Origin Erroris. c. 2. and 17.
Lactantius and other Primitive Christians write expressly, That without doubt
there can be no Religion at all in that place wheresoever any Image is;
whereupon Epiphanius rent the Image of Christ or some other Saint, which he
found in a Church painted in cloth, out of holy indignation, as contrary to the
Authority of the Scriptures. In few words, Our own Homilies against the peril
of Idolatry, part, 2. p. 38. expressly resolve, That when Images began to creep
into the Church, they were not only spoken and written against by godly and
learned Bishops, Doctors and Clerks, but also condemned by WHOLE COVNCELS OF
LEARNED MEN assembled together; yea the said Images, by many Christian Emperors
and Bishops were defaced, broken and destroyed. Which Mr. Calvin in the place
objected by the Bishop, affirms likewise. And therefore it is a most desperate
Impudency in the Archbishop, thus falsely to affirm the contrary, point blank
against our Homilies and his own subscription to them. And whereas he cites
Tertullian, to prove, that the Christians in his days had the picture of
Christ upon their Chalices; We Answer, That if the Book de Pvdicitia be
Tertullians own, (of which some doubt) yet his words import no such thing,
which are these, A parabolis licebit incipias; ubi est evis perdita a Domino
acquisita, and humeris ejus revecta; Procedant ipsae PICTVRAE CALICVM VESTRORVM
(not nostrorum) si volle nillis perlucebit interpretatio pecudis illius,
utrumne Christiano vel Ethnico peccateri de restitutione colliniet. If this
place intimate any thing, it is only this, That the Phychici and other
Heretics against whom he writ this Book, (not the Orthodox Christians, as this
Prelate dreams) had the picture of the lost sheep graven on their cups: will it
therefore follow hence, Ergo The Orthodox Christians had Crucifixes and Images
of Christ, God the Father, the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary in their
Churches, in their Chappelss, as he has set up in his Lambeth Chapel windows?
Certainly this is a gross Nonsequitur. Yet this is his learned Argument from
this Authority rightly stated. And that he has most grossly abused Tertullian,
your Lordships and his Auditory, in alleging Tertullian for defense of
Images, and their use among the Primitive Christians; certainly Tertullian is
so far from any such opinion, that he has written a whole Book de Idololatria,
next before this de Pudicitia, wherein he expressly condemns, not only the
having, but making of any Image or Picture for any use, and the very Arts of
carving and painting Images, as contrary to the second Commandment (as the *
Jews, Josephus, Philo and others did before him; and the very Turks and
Persians at this day.) Take but this Sentence of his insted of many; Omnis
forma vel formula Idolum se dici exposcit. Idolum TAM FIERI quam coli Deus
prohibet. Quanto praecedit ut fiat quod coli possit tanto prius est NE FIAT si
coli non licet. Propter hanc causam, ad eradicandum scilicet materiam
Idololatriae, lex divina proclamat, Ne feceris Idolum: and conjungens: Neque
similitudinem eorum quae in coelo sunt, and quae in terra, and quae in mari:
TOTO MVNDO EJVSMODI ARTIBVS INTERDIXIT SERVIS DEI. Artifices statuarum and
Imaginum DIABOLVS seculo notulit, etc. Which he prosecutes at large throughout
this eloquent Book. And therefore his Impudency and Sophistry in citing
Tertullian for defense of Images in Churches, who is thus point blank against
the making of any Image whatsoever, even for civil uses, is an intolerable,
inexcusable Boldness.

Eighthly, Whereas he Answers, That the setting up of these Glasse-Images is no
High Treason by the Statute: We grant it not to be so simply in it self,
neither do we urge it to be so, but as it tends to subvert our Religion, Laws,
and set up Popery, concurs with his other practices of this nature, so it may
and will prove High Treason. The second Part of the Homily against the peril of
Idolatry, Page 37. assures us, That the maintenance of Images has brought in a
sea of mischiefs, horrible Schisms, Rebellions, TREASONS, and his maintaining
of them has done the like.

Ninthly, we conceive that the Statute of 3. E. 6. c. 10. which command all
Images of Stone, Timber, Alabaster, or Earth, graven, carved, or painted; which
heretofore have been taken out of any Church or Chapple, or yet stand in any
Church or Chapple to be defaced and destroyed, extend to Images in glass
windows as well as others, which are but painted Earth; and that which
confirms us in this opinion is, That the Homilies against the peril of Jdolatry
(the occasion of this Law) and the injunctions of Queen Elizabeth made in
pursuance of it, extend in direct terms to Images in glass windows, as well
as to Images of Stone, Timber and the like, yea, the practice of that time in
defacing the glass Images in Lambeth Chapple-windowes (which he of late
repaired) and in most other places, infallibly proves it: Together with the
Statute of 3. Jac. c. 5. which reckons up Jmages and Crucifixes, of what matter
soever, among the Relics of Popery, and enjoynes them to be defaced:
wherefore the evasion of his is most false and frivolous, especially since
Popery may creep in at a glasse-window, as well as at a door; and our Homilies,
Injunctions, writers censure all of them alike, if this Statute do it not:
Finally, by all these Answers he professes himself a most zealous, real
Papist, but false Protestant in pleading thus boldly and falsely for the use of
Images of all sorts in Churches, and in repairing of Popish Images formerly
defaced by Authority, instead of confessing and craving pardon for this his
dangerous error, his most Idolatrous, Popish practice.

The second thing objected against me, as a Popish Innovation in my Chapple
Object. 2.
at Lambeth, is, See here Pa. 62, 64.
my removing and railing in the Communion Table there Altarwise, with the ends
of it North and South against the wall; my furnishing it with Basins,
Candlesticks, and other furniture, and hanging a cloth of Arras behind it,
with the Picture of Christ and his Apostles eating the Lords Supper together.

Ans. To which I Answer, First, That the railing in and placing the Table
Altarwise is warranted by Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions, which prescribe, That
Answ.
the Holy Table in every Church be decently made, and set in the place where
the Altar stood: Now the Altars generally in all Churches, as all Antiquity
manifests, stood at the East end of the Quire, North and South close to the
wall, as the Tables were lately placed, and there were railed in: This
therefore is no innovation.

Secondly, the furniture on the Altar is no other then such as is in use in the
Kings own Chapple at White Hall, and had been there used ever since and before
my time.

Thirdly, that the Arras piece at the back of the Table containing the Story of
Christ's last Supper, was fit for that place and occasion: That such Images and
representations were lawful, approved by all the Lutheran Churches, yea, by
Master Calvin himself, for an Historical use, in the place forecited, Jnst. l.
1. c. 11. Sect. 12.

Reply, To this the Commons replied, First, That neither Queen Elizabeth's
Injunctions, nor the Rubric in the Common Prayer Book, nor any Law or Canon
Reply.
of our Church prescribe the railing in of our Communion Tables, or placing
them Altarwise against the wall, with the ends North and South: There is no
syllable in any of them to warrant any such Popish innovation, prescribed only
by Popish Canons, as we have proved: That it cannot be proved that Altars were
generally so placed and railed in anciently, either in England or elsewhere: The
contrary whereof we shall prove anon; That the makers and executers of these
Innovations knew best of any, where and how Communion Tables were to be
situated by virtue of them, and they generally placed them throughout the
Realm, in the midst of the Quire or Chancel, with the ends East and West,
standing a convenient distance from the East wall, without any rail about it,
in which posture they generally stood in all Churches, Chapples, and in Lambeth
Chapple it self for one, ever since these Injunctions published, till this
innovating Arch prelate altered this their ancient situation. Yet both the
Rubric in the Common Prayer Book, the Queens Injunctions, the 82 Canon, Bishop
Jewel, Bishop Babington, Doctor Fulk, and other of our writers agree, that when
the Sacrament is administered it ought to stand in the body of the Church or
Chancel, of which more hereafter: This therefore is an innovation and that a
Popish one too, tending to introduce private Mass, to remove the Lords Table
as far as possible from the view and audience of the common people, when the
Sacrament is celebrated at it.

Secondly, We See p. 62.
have proved, that this Altar-furniture of Candlesticks, Tapers, Basins,
Crucifixes, and the like, was originally borrowed from the Roman, Ceremonial,
Pontifical, and the Popish Council of Aix, which enjoin them, That the third
Part of our Homilies against the peril of Idolatry, and Queen Elizabeth's
Injunctions (which he cites for the placing of Lords Tables Altarwise) Injunct.
2. 23. 25. condemn, censure, abolish, as Superstitious, Ethnical; and Popish,
all Candlesticks, Trendals, Rolls of wax, and setting up of Tapers, for that
they be things tending to Idolatry and Superstition, which of all other
offenses, God Almighty does most detest and abhor, for that the same diminish
most his honor and glory: Therefore the Kings Altar-Furniture in his Chapel
at White Hall, can be no justification nor extenuation of his offense, who
should have reformed his Majesty's Chapel (whereof he was the Dean and
Superintendent, according to our Laws, Homilies, Injunctions which condemn
such Altar-trinkets) not conformed his own Chapple, Altar to the Kings, in
these mere Popish Superstitious innovations.

Thirdly, The Arras hanging was rather suited to the Crucifixes in the glass
window over it and other Images of Christ in that Chapel, then to the place or
Lords Table where it hanged. The Table and Sacramental elements themselves,
with the usual participation of them every month, being sufficient to mind us
of our Saviors last Supper, passion, death too, and 1 Cor. 11. 26. Gal. 3. 1.
to show them forth till he come, (who used no such Pictures nor Crucifixes,
when he instituted his last Supper) without any such Image or Crucifix: which
being condemned by our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Canons, Writers, as we
have formerly evidenced, yea, by all Antiquity, by Mr. Calvin himself, and many
Lutherans too, ought not to have been placed there; the rather, because there
is no warrant nor prescript for it, but only in the Sea p. 62.
Roman Ceremonial, p. 69. 70. His conformity whereto was the only ground of
hanging up those Arras Pictures, which well deserves another hanging,
especially in an Arch-prelate, who professes himself a Protestant, and as
averse from Popery as any man whatsoever.

The third sort of Innovations in my Chapel charged against me, is the setting
Object. 3.
up of a Here page 63, 64.
Credentia or Side-table, my own and my Chaplains bowing toward the Table or
Altar at our approaches to it, our going in and out from the Chapel; my
Chaplains with my own using of Copes therein, at the celebration of the Lords
Supper and solemn consecrations of Bishops, attested by Dr. Heywood my own
Chaplain, who confessed, That he celebrated the Sacrament at Lambeth Chapple in
a Cope, that my other Chaplains did the like, and that he thought I was
sometimes present when they did it; that the Bread when the Sacrament was
administered was first laid upon the Credentia, from whence he took it in his
hand and then carried it too, and kneeling down upon his knee presented it,
laid it on the Lords Table, on which there were Candlesticks, and Tapers, but
not burning, as he had seen them at White Hall; which Mr. Cordwel once my
servant likewise deposed; adding, that I was present sometimes when this was
done, and that my Chaplains bowed down thrice toward the Altar at their
approaches to it.

To which I Answer: First, that I took my pattern of the Credentia from Bishop
Answ.
Andrews Chapel.

Secondly, that this bowing toward the Altar was used in the Kings Chapel,
and in many Cathedrals both in Queen Elizabeth's and King James their raigns.

Thirdly, that the use of Copes is prescribed by the 24 Canon of our Church
Anno 1603. which orders thus, See p. 63.
In all Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, the Holy Communion shall be
administered upon principal feast days, sometimes by the Bishop if he be
present, and sometimes by the Dean, sometimes by a Canon or Prebendary, the
principal Minister using a decent Cope. This therefore is no Innovation.

To this was retorted in general, that Sir Nathaniel Brent, and Doctor Featly
deposed, nor there was no such Credentia, bowing toward the Table, Altar, nor
Reply.
any Cope at all used in Lambeth Chapel, in his predecessors time; therefore
all these are mere Innovations: In particular, it was replied, that it appears
not by proof Bishop Andrews had any such utensels, vestments, or bowings in his
Chapel; therefore this is a mere groundless evasion: But admit he had, yet
Bishop Andrews Chapel was no Law, Canon, nor Pattern for him to follow, against
our Laws; Common Prayer Book, Homilies, Injunctions, which exclude such
innovations: And if the Pattern of the Chapel and its Furniture which we gave
in evidence were Bishops Andrews, as he avers; it was as grossly Popish and
Superstitious as the Popes, or any Popish Prelates Chapel whatsoever. As for
the Credentia, it is directly taken out of the Roman Ceremonial and Pontifical,
as we have Here p. 63.
proved, the only Canons we know prescribing it, and we find the use of it
only in some Popish Churches, and mentioned no wherebut in the Roman Missal,
among the Rites of celebrating the Mass: Therefore it is a mere Popish
utensel, appropriated to the Mass and a forerunner of it.

Secondly, This bowing to and toward the Altar, was never prescribed by our
Statutes, Articles, Homilies, Common Prayer Book, Injunctions, Canons, never
practiced by any till of late, but some few Popish Court Doctors, and
Cathedralists; never used by his Predecessor or his Chaplains, See the
Quench-cole, p. 24. etc.
introduced only by Papists at the first, in honor and adoration of their
Breaden God upon the Altar; and enjoined only by the Pa 63, 64.
Roman Missal, Ceremonian, and Popish Canonists, as we have largely manifested:
Therefore not to be justified or excused.

Thirdly, the Book of Common Prayer, and administration of the Sacraments, and
other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England (the only Directory what
vestments, Ceremonies are to be used, confirmed by our Laws) prescribes not
any of these; warrants not but excludes the use of Copes upon any occasion: Our
Homilies and writers of best rank condemn Copes, as Jewish, Popish, Paganish,
enjoined only by the Sea. p. 64.
Roman Ceremonial, and Pontifical, as we have proved, See Queen Elizabeth's
Injunctions, Number. 47.
Injunctions deeming them Popish: Yea the third Part of the Homily against the
peril of Idolatry, has this memorable passage concerning them, p. 72. And
because the whole Pageant must thoroughly be played, it is not enough thus to deck
Images and Idols (with gold, silver, rich, wanton and proud apparel, tempting
their paramours to wantonness) but at last come in the Priests themselves,
likewise decked with gold and pearls, that they may be meet servants for such
Lords and Ladies, and fit worshippers of such Gods and Goddesses; and with a
solemn pace they pass forth before the golden Puppets, and fall down to the
ground on their marrow-bones before the Honorable Idols: (and their gorgious
Altars too) Therefore certainly it is impudency for him thus to introduce and
justify them against these Authorities. Now whereas the Archbishop pleads the
24 Canon, made in the year 1603. to warrant the use of Copes in his Chapel: we
Answer first, That the Canon extends only to Collegiat and Cathedral Churches,
not Parochial, much less to Chapels: Therefore it can no ways warrant, but
condemns this use of Copes in his Chapel: Secondly, it enjoins only the chief
Minister to use a decent Cope; not a gaudy one with Images, and rich
embroidring upon it, such as his Copes were: Thirdly, this Canon was never
binding to any, but merely void in Law, being never confirmed by Parliament,
and crossing both the Common Prayer Book and Homilies ratified by Parliament:
Therefore all these his Answers in justification of these Innovations, display
his impudence to the world, in justifying such Popish Relics as these.

The fourth kind of Innovations charged against me in my Chapel are, here p.
64. 65.
the Object. 4.
standing at gloria patri, bowing at the name of Jesus, not used in my
Predecessors days; the setting up of a new Organ, where there was formerly
none, and the consecrating of Utensels, Altar-clothes, Flagons, with other
Popish-furniture solemnly in a Cope, attested by Mr. Boadman and others, which
are objected to be taken out of the Roman Missal, and Pontifical.

To which I give this Answer:

1. That the standing up at gloria patri, though not prescribed by any Canon,
Answ.
or Rubric of our Church, is of great Antiquity, and has been commonly
practiced in our Churches.

2. That bowing at the name of Jesus, is a thing prescribed in direct terms by
Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions, Number. 12. and the 18 Canon of our Church;
therefore no Innovation nor offense.

3. That though there were no Organs there before my time, yet they being
approved and generally used in our Church, there could be no Popery in them.

4. That the Consecration of Churches, Communion Tables, Altars, Chalices,
Vestments is no fault, nor Innovation; for it is as ancient as Constantine the
Great, and have been used in the Church of Christ ever since his time.

5. That such Consecrations are necessary, else the Lords Table could not be
called holy, nor the Church holy, nor those vessels holy vessels, as they
usually are: Yea, there is a Holiness in the Altar, as Christ averreth, which
consecrates the gold thereon: And the Statute of 5 and 6. Ed. 6. against
quarrelling and fighting in Churches, proves, that they are holy places; and
they could not be holy, unless first consecrated: As for the form of
consecrating these vessels, I took it not out of Missale Romanum nor the Roman
Pontifical, as is objected; but from Bishop Andrews his Form, as learned,
reverend, Orthodox Protestant a Prelate, as ever the Church of England bred.

To this was Replied: Reply.


1. That it is confessed, there is neither Canon nor Rubric enjoining any to
stand up at every rehearsal of gloria patri in time of Divine service; a most
disorderly unnecessary and confused Ceremony, wherein men start up and quat
down suddenly again, as if they were frighted out of their sleep: And we have
proved, that it is enjoined only by the Pa. 64.
Roman Missal, no very good Directory for us Protestants; as for his pretended
antiquity and customary usage of this Ceremony in our own and other Protestant
Churches, it is merely fabulous without any Authority to warrant it, but his
own asseveration.

2 That bowing at the name of Jesus, was originally introduced, prescribed by
See the Appendix of bowing at the name of Jesus, Lame Giles his haltings,
Queries concerning bowing, etc.
Popes decrees, Popish Councels, Canonists, Writers, of purpose to justify the
adoration of Images and the consecrated Host; that it is no where enjoined by
our Common Prayer Book, Articles of Religion, Homilies, or Book of Ordination,
the only Authentic binding Records of our Church, wherein all Rites and
Ceremonies, to which we are bound by Law are prescribed, That the Injunctions
and Canons are no binding Laws, and their Authority (had they ever any) long
since expired, that some of the best Orthodoxest of our writers have
professedly written against this Ceremony, as Thomas Beacon, Dr. Whitaker, Dr.
Willet, Dr. Ayry, and others, which was never pressed on any by our Prelates in
their visitation Articles, nor generally used till of late, and now quite
exploded as superstitious, and absurd: Yea, Dr. Featly and Sir Nathaniel Brent
directly prove, that it was not used in Lambeth Chapel by his predecessor
Abbot, or his Chaplains, servants.

3. For Organs, there were none in that Chapel before his time since the
Reformation: Therefore an Innovation there. And though generally received and
used in Cathedrals, yet all Authors agree it was a Pope, Platina, Balaeas and
others in his life, Polidor Vergil. dc Invent. Rerum. lib. 6. c. 2. The.
Beacons Relics of Rome c. 76, 77. Hist. Mastix. p. 282, etc.
(Vitalian by name) first introduced the use of them into Christian Churches,
and all know they are most in use only in Popish Churches beyond the seas.

Fourthly, for the Antiquity and lawfulness of consecrating Churches, we have
already discussed, and shall further resute it in its due place; for the
consecration of Altars, Flagons, Altar-clothes, and other Altar-furniture, the
only thing here objected; we have proved the original and derivation of it, to
be merely from the Roman Missal and Pontifical, and from no better nor higher
Antiquity: He pretends, but proves not, that he took his immediate president
from Bishop Andrews, a late deceased superstitious, if not Popish Prelate, how
ever he applauds him: Therefore certainly from no Antiquity. But from whom did
Bishop Andrews take his pattern? doubtless from the Roman Missal and
Pontifical, since no other sampler can be produced. And are these a fit pattern
for a Protestant Bishops imitation? As for his objected reason, that Altars,
Churches, Flagons, etc. could not be called nor reputed Holy, unless thus
solemnly consecrated: First, It is but a mere Nonsequitur, it being not any
Bishops formal unwarrantable consecration, but the peoples appropriation of
them to a sacred use that makes them holy, not inherently, but relatively only,
with reference to the holy Ordinances therein administered, of which hereafter:
For the Statute of 5 and 6. E. 6. c. 5. It has been not one syllable in it in
justification of the consecration of Churches, much less of Altars, Flagons,
Altar-clothes and the like; neither does it ever style the Church or Churches
holy, or a holy or consecrated place: nor could it well be so, in respect of
their consecration only, they being Hallowed only by Popish Prelates in times
of Popery, with such Popish Relics, Ceremonies, Chrisms, Exorcisms,
Crossings, and washings with holy water, and since then exploded as
superstitious and ridiculous: Therefore to justify these consecrations from
thence, is to make a conclusion without any premises to warrant it. Finally, he
discovers a rotten Popish spirit, inclination in the highest degree, in
pleading for, and justifying to the utmost such Popish consecrations against
the express resolutions of our Orthodox here p. 115. 116.
forecited Writers, Prelates, and his own learned predecessor Matthew Parker,
who have so severely censured them as Popish, Jewish, and childish tryfles fit
to be exploded.

Secondly, having ended with my Chapel at Lambeth, they next pursued me to
Object. 2.
my study there.

Where, first they Pa 66, etc.
charge me for having an English Bible with a Crucifix embroidered on the Cover
of it.

To which I Answer, That I bought it not, but it was sent unto me by a Lady,
Answ.
and the Crucifix it self is lawful, if there be no adoration of it; as appears
by the Christians engraving of it on their Chalices in Tertullians days.

To which was replied: First, that his receiving and reserving of this Bible
Reply.
with a Crucifix on the Cover, (which was so visible to his eyes, and lay upon
his study Table) was as great an offense as if he had bought it: And no Lady
durst have sent him such a present, had she not been assured of his good
affection to such Popish Pictures.

Secondly, whereas he avers the Picture of the Crucifix to be lawful, so it be
not adored: He herein expressly contradicts our See here p. 59. 102. to 110.
Homilies, to which he has subscribed, our Statutes, Injunctions, Authors
forecited, yea, the judgment of all sound Antiquity. And if this Picture of
Christ hanging still on the Cross (as if he had never been taken down thence)
be lawful, (as he avers with the Papists against all Orthodox Protestants) then
it is lawful to make or reserve it either for a mere civil use to grace his
study, or please his eye sight only; which certainly is an extreme dishonor
to, disparagement of our most blessed Savior and his passion, who is Luke 1.
35. Act. 4 30.
the holy One of God, transcending all civil uses being made for holy ends
alone: or for a religious use, to stir up our devotion, and put us in
remembrance of his death (which he has purposely ordained his Gal. 3 1. 1 Cor.
11. 26.
word and Sacraments to do) which at best is superstition.

Thirdly, the place of Tertullian (already quoted) proves not at all that the
Christians had any Crucifixes or Pictures of Christ engraven on their Chalices;
there is no such syllable in his writings, but only that the Heretics against
whom he writ, had the Picture of a lost sheep engraven on some of their Cups.
And we hope there is a vast difference, between Heretics and Orthodox
Christians, the Picture of a lost sheep, and a Crucifix or Picture of Christ
himself hanging on the Cross.

The second thing charged against me in my study, is a (g) Book of Popish
Pictures printed 1623. containing the Portratures of the Life, Passion, and
Death of Object. 2. (q) Pa. 66, 10. ^.
our Lord Jesus Christ.

I Answer, that I kept it only as a Scholar, to peruse and refute it upon
occasion, nor Answ.
to adore or make use of the Pictures in it.

To which was answered, that this Book was (as the Papists style their Images)
a mere ignorant Lay-mans, not a learned Archbishops Book, consisting merely
Reply.
of unlawful Pictures: Therefore he had it only to view, not read.

Secondly, his curious guilding of the Book and Pictures in it, argues, that he
prized it more then ordinary to help him in his Devotions.

Thirdly, he was so far from refuting it, that he authorized those very
Pictures to be reprinted in England, and bound up in our Bibles.

Fourthly, he had many small Popish gilded velome Pictures, curiously guilt
inserted into this Book; a pregnant proof he very much doted on these Puppets
in his declining age.

The third particular objected against me in my study, is Page 66.
two large folio Object. 3.
Masse-books, and that I had noted one of them frequently with my hand: That I
had likewise there the Roman Missal, Pontifical, and twenty two Popish hours of
our Lady, Breviaries, Manuels, and Books of Popish devotion.

I Answer: First, that it is lawful for every learned man to have those Books
to peruse and refute them, as there is occasion, there being no great Scholars
Answ.
but have them in their studies for this end; for which cause alone I both read
and noted one of them with my own hand, not out of any love to, or approbation
of the Mass it self: And they may as aptly conclude that I am a Turk, because
I have the Alcoran in my study; as that I am a Papist or Popishly affected,
because I have the Masse-book. The same Answer I shall give to the other
objected Books found in my study.

The Reply hereto was: First, that the mere having all or any of these Books
Reply.
in his study, was no convincing argument of his affection and inclination to
Popery, no more then his keeping the Alcoran as a Scholar, proves him to be a
Turk; neither was it so pressed by us, since many Protestants have them in
their studies to peruse, refute; which is no offense, but laudable and
necessary in some cases. But we have punctually proved all along, that he
bought, perused, and noted them with his own hand; not by way of dislike or
refutation, but approbation, yea he pursued them strictly in practice and
imitation, as far as the most superstitious Popish Priests or Prelates did at
Rome in most particulars.

Secondly, compare his having of these Books, with the extraordinary
curiousness and costlinesse of their binding, guilding; the Popish Images,
Crucifixes in his study, Chapel, Gallery, and the rest of our following
evidence; and then they are a very strong Argument, to prove him a professed
Papist in affection, opinion, if not in practice too.

The last Page 67.
objected thing found in my Library is, my private Prayers and Devotions
written with my own hand, against which there are three exceptions: Objection.


First, that some of these Prayers are extracted out of the Roman Missal,
Pontifical, Breviary, and hours of our Lady.

Secondly, that they are digested into Canonical hours of prayer after the
Papists Model.

Thirdly, that I make mention of prostration in some of them.

To which I return this general Answer: That this being only a Book for my Answ.
own private devotions and use alone, ought not to be charged against me. As to
the objected particulars excepted against, I Answer: First, that if any such
prayers be taken out of the Missal, Pontifical, or Roman Breviary; yet they are
devout and pious in themselves, and there is no prayer to Saints or Angels in
the Book: Thirdly, the Canonical hours of Prayer are of very great Antiquity in
the Church: derived from holy King David's practice, who said Ps. i. 9. 164.
Seven times a day will I praise thee, and was taken up and practiced by
Christians within two hundred years after Christ, and approved of in preces
privatae, in Queen Elizabeth's reign: Thirdly, that prostration in prayer is no
crime, but commendable, and a sign of extraordinary humility; Christ himself
using this gesture in his prayers before his passion.

Hereunto the Commons Council retorted in general, That his own private
devotions did best of all serve to discover his secret intentions and
inclinations; Reply.
therefore they were fit to be given in evidence, for this purpose. In
particular: First, that his collecting of Prayers out of such Popish dunghils,
when there were purer mines to dig in, was a symptom of a Romish inclination.
And whereas he alleges the matter of those prayers to be good; those we
except against are for their very matter merely superstitious: Secondly, that
this justification of the Antiquity and lawfulness of Canonical hours of
Prayer, was taken verbatim out of Mr. Cosens his hours of Prayer, formerly
complained of in Parliament. That Canonical hours of Prayer, are no ways
warranted by David's president, who speaks only of Praise, not Prayer, and
never digested his Psalms or Prayers into such Canonical houers, nor any other
Saint in the Old Testament or New: The most exact pattern of Prayer which Christ
himself left both his Disciples and us to imitate, warrants no such practice:
nay the Primitive Christians and true Antiquity never knew of any such Models
of Prayer, digested into Canonical hours, which Popish monks first introduced,
practiced, prescribed: Neither did Queen Elizabeth approve of them as Dr.
Cosens pretends in his hours of Prayer, whence the Archbishop borrowed this
false answer; as See Dr. Cosens his cosening devotions.
some who answered his Book by public Authority have manifested to his shame:
Thirdly, the Archbishop has quite mistaken the last objection; which was not
his prostration to God in Prayer, but, his prostration coram Altar, and dum
Altari adsto, in honor and reverence of his idolized Altar: So that the charge
rests still upon, and sticks faster to him then before, by this his
justification.

Thirdly, From my study at Lambeth they pursued me to my Gallery there, Object.
3.
where they charge Page 67.
three Pictures against me; to which I return this Answer.

That the first of them, which is the great one, was given me by a friend, and
there can be no harm or Popery in it, being only the Picture of Saint Ambrose,
Answ.
Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory the first, which may be lawfully made and
reserved. That the two other Pictures were in the Gallery long before my time,
and continued there in Archbishop Abbots, Bancrofts, and Whitgifts days; to
prove which he produces Mr. Dobson his servant, who affirmed, that he saw these
two latter Pictures in the Gallery in Archbishop Bancrofts time, where they
continued ever since; and one of them is a Picture against Popery, to wit, of
Christ, going into the sheepfold by the door, and of Popish Priests and Friars
Ioh. 10. 1, 2, 3.
climbing into it by the window, like thieves and robbers: Besides, the Harmony
of confessions of the reformed Churches, holds that Images are in themselves
indifferent, so as no adoration be given to them; yea, Mr. Calvin in the Inst.
l. 1. c. 11. sect. 12, 13.
place forecited, is of the same opinion: And I have written against the
adoration and superstitious use of Images as fully as any man whatsoever:
Therefore those Pictures can be no evidence of mine intention to bring in
Popery.

To which was rejoyned: First, that we believe the first Picture was a present
Reply.
sent unto him from Rome, where the workmanship of it shows it was made; and
therefore he did wisely to conceal his name, who bestowed it on him: That we
did not except against the mere Pictures of those Fathers; but against the
Picture of the Holy Ghost in form of a Dove hovering over their heads, and
sending forth rays and influences from his beak severally upon each of them;
directly contrary to our Statutes, Homilies, Writers, which condemn all such
Pictures of the Holy Ghost, or any other persons of the Trinity.

Secondly, that one of the other Pictures was a most abominable Idol of Christ
newly taken down from his Cross all bloody, with shaven crown Priests, Friars,
and Nunns, standing and kneeling round about him; which kind of Pictures by
our Laws, Homilies, Injunctions resolutions (as we Page 102. to 108.
have already proved) ought to be utterly demolished and not suffered in
private Houses or Galleries, no more then in Churches or Chapels, The other
was a Picture of Christ himself upon a ladder, not entering in at a door, with
Monks and Friars only about him: and therefore as superstitious, Popish as the
former, and not tolerable by our Laws, especially in an Archbishops public
Gallary, where all sorts of strangers and visitors of quality were entertained;
who by this example would be induced, if Protestants, to approve of such
superstitious Pictures, and to procure the like by way of imitation; If
Papists, would be thereby hardened, confirmed in their superstition, and in
giving them adoration, especially when they should behold the like
Superstitious and Idolatrous Pictures, as well in his Chapel and study, as in
his Gallary, where no such were in his predecessors days, but only broken and
defaced ones. As for his predecessors having or leaving these two last
Pictures to him, it is no justification, nor mitigation of his crime; their ill
actions are no Apology at all for his, who repaired and beautified in his
Chapel those very superstitious Images, which they demolished, and never durst
repair.

Thirdly, whereas he produces the Harmony of confessions of the Protestants
Churches, for proof of the use and indifferency of these Images, so as they be
not adored: He cites neither Section, nor Page, nor sentence therein to prove
this assertion, but we must take it on his own bare word; which how false it
is, we shall prove by the words of the Harmony it self: Sect. 17. p. 401. Where
the latter confession of Helvetia, Cha. 17. determines thus. But yet
notwithstanding we must admonish men to take heed, that they count not among
things indifferent; such as INDEED ARE NOT INDIFFERENT, as some use to count
the Mass, and THE USE OF IMAGES IN CHURCHES. This is the only passage we find
in the Harmony of confessions for the indifferency of Images or their use,
which is point blank against him. And as for Page. And so in his Inst. l. 2. c.
8. sect. 17.
Mr. Calvin's forecited Text, it is as point blank against him, as this of the
Harmony, as we have proved. Therefore this charge lies still heavy upon him in
each particular, and bewrayes both his Popery and falsity in quotations.

Secondly, from Lambeth house, they next pursued me to White Hall, where these
Page. 69, 70, 71.
particulars were charged against me: First, my own personal bowing Objection.
to the Altar: and my enjoining of others his Majesty's Chaplains to use it,
when I was Dean of the Chapel: Secondly, the hanging up of a glorious large
costly Arras Crucifix behind the Altar, on passion week, in his Majesty's own
Chapel there, in the years 1636. and 1637. which gave great scandal and
offense, as Sir Henry Mildmay attested: Thirdly, my making his Majesty's
Chapel a pattern of imitation to all Cathedrals and other Churches: Fourthly,
the practice of Dr. Brown, and two Seminary Priests, in bowing to the Altar and
Crucifix there; with their speech to Mrs. Charnock.

To the first of these I Answer, that my bowing there was only to worship God,
not the Altar, and I hope it is no offense nor treason to worship God in the
Kings Answ.
own Chapel, or to induce others to do the like: The lawfulness of this
worship toward the Altar, I have manifested at large in my Page 39. etc.
Speech in Starchamber, and proved it by a Chapter order in the Black book of
Windsor, which the Knights of the Honorable Order of the Garter yet observe
and practice; therefore it is no Popery, nor Popish Innovation, but a reverence
fitting the place which the Homily for repairing and keeping clean Churches
commands. And I pray God that under color of casting superstition out of
Churches, we bring not in profaneness.

To the third I Answer, that I was not Dean of the Chapel, but Bishop Wren
when this Crucifix was set up; that neither Sir Henry Mildmay, nor any other
ever complained to me, that they were scandalized by this Crucifix: If Sir
Henry took scandal merely at the Crucifix it self, he must have taken scandal
at that Crucifix in the old hangings, which stood continually, behind the
Altar, as well as at this which was more costly; which since he did not, it
seems, he took scandal only at the workmanship, not at the Crucifix it self, in
this more costly piece.

(To the third he gave no Answer.)

To the fourth I Answer, that Dr. Browns act is nothing to me, he is old enough
and must answer for himself: The same Answer I give to that of the Seminary
Priests; only this I shall add, that perchance it might be an act of cunning in
them, of purpose to discredit and discountenance all our external worship, of
purpose to gain Proselytes to themselves.

To which was replied: First, that to worship God as we ought in the Kings
Chapel, is no treason, nor offense; but this kind of worshipping God there or
elsewhere Reply.
toward the Altar, is both See the Quench cole p. 240. to 330. A pleasant
purge for a a Roman Catholic, p. 140. to 182. where this is largely proved.
Popish, Superstitious, and Idolatrous: For by the Black-book of Windsor which
he cites, it was introduced in the very darkest times of Popery in Henry the 5.
his reign, or a little before: and that in modum virorum Ecclesiasticorum, a
worship derived from Ecclesiastical persons, to wit, Popish Priests and Monks
of that age: It was a worship jointly given in one and the self same act and
instant Deo and Altari, to God and the Altar, that is, in their interpretation,
to the consecrated Host and breaden God (as they deemed it) on the Altar, and
to the Altar it self: It was prescribed See here p. 63, 64.
only by Popish Canons, the Roman Missal, Ceremonial, Pontifical, and
introduced purposely to support their Error of Transubstantiation at first,
and now revived for that very purpose: as the Archbishop himself defines in his
Starchamber Speech; who yields this reason, why we must how toward the Altar,
not toward the Pulpit: For there it is, hoc est corpus meum, etc. And a greater
reverence no doubt IS DUE TO THE BODY, then to the Word of the Lord: Therefore
for him to introduce such an Idolatrous, Superstitious worship, as this into
the Kings own Chapel contrary to the Word of God, and Law of the Land, under
pretext of Gods worship, to corrupt the King and his whole Court in their
worship and Religion, and alienate his good Subjects affections from him, will
prove little less then Treason in the highest degree: As for his pretended
Speech, we Page 200. 201.
have already refuted it. And for the Homily, it has neither word nor syllable
to warrant it, but some thing against it, since as it condemns, prophanes, on
the one hand, so it censures all superstition on the other; between which this
Prelate would have no medium, as this his prayer imports.

Secondly, That the Archbishop was chief Superintendent of his Majesty's
Chapel, as Primate and Metropolitan of all England. The King and Queen where
ever they live in England, being his immediate Parishoners, and the whole
Kingdom but his Parish; though divided into several Bishoprics, as has been
resolved by all the Nobles in King Henry the first his reign, as our
Historians, and his Antiq. Eccle. Brit. p. 33. 102.
own Predecessor Archbishop Parker record: Therefore Bishop Wren being only
Dean of the Kings Chapel, the Archbishops creature, and brought into that
office by him, durst not have set up this gaudy Crucifix there, in the passion
week, in his presence without his approbation and direction, by which he
tacitly confesses it was done: That it gave public scandal to many
well-affected Courtiers, and others, Sir Henry Mildmay deposed, and
particularly to himself, who complained of it to the King, and the Archbishop
too; who if his heart had been right and fervent to our Religion, would have
been most scandalized, offended at this unusual scandalous sight, and never
have permitted it successiively two years together, nor justified it so
peremptorily as now he did. And whereas he objects, that had Sir Henry been
thus scandalized with the Crucifix it self, he would have been as much offended
with the old, there constantly hanging, as with the new: We Answer, That the
old was hardly visible and scarce observed by any; but this so gross, so
great, so gaudy and notorious, that every man in the Chapel took special
notice thereof, as if it had been some new blasing Star. And if the old were so
visible all the year long, what need the hanging up of this new one only in
the passion and Easter weeks, which was never used in the memory of man before?
In fine the third Part of the Homily against the peril of Idolatry, resolves,
that the most rich, costly, gaudy Images and Crucifixes, are more dangerous and
scandalous, then others not so stately: therefore Sir Henry might well be
scandalized with it, more then with the old one not so costly.

Thirdly, he gives no Answer to that which is one main charge from this
Innovation in the royal Chapel, to make it the pattern, the Canon to regulate
all Cathedral, and Parish Churches by. His silence herein bewrayes his guilt.

Fourthly, Dr. Browns, and those Seminaries adorations of this Crucifix and the
Altar, were but the mere scandalous fruits of his own exemplary Innovations
before, and erections of them there; and their speeches occasioned by his
actions. Therefore the guilt of them must rest heaviest on himself, not them.
It is his own often iterated position, Relation of the conference with Fisher.
That he who gives the occasion of a Schism ought to be repu^ed the
Schismatic, not he that separates upon the occasion given: And Tertullian in
his Book De Idolatria resolves, That the makers of Idols are the greatest
Idolaters, because none would or could worship them, were they not first made
that they might be worshipped: His own hanging of up this Crucifix and bowing
toward the Altar, and it was the cause that Dr. Brown and these Seminary
Priests adored and bowed toward them in the self some manner, as himself there
used: Therefore the crime, the scandal of it, must rest most on himself. His
pretense, that this might be done and spoken by the Priest, to gain Proselytes,
by discountenancing our external worship, is a very strange improbable whimsey,
since our Bishops, our Doctors imitation of their Popish worshipping
Crucifixes, Altars, was more likely ten thousand to one; to gain them
Proselytes, then any discountenancing whatsoever thereof by them could be; yea,
it had been a monstrous contradiction and folly in them, to discountenance that
very thing themselves practiced and endeavored to draw others to: Therefore
the whole weight of this heavy charge concerning his Majesty's Chapel, rests
entirely upon him in each particular, without the least diminution.

Thirdly, from White Hall they pursued me to the Kings Coronation at
Westminster Abbey, Pa. 69 70.
where they charge me. Object. 3.


1. With compiling the Form of this Coronation. 2. That the unction was in
forma crucis. 3. That the old Crucifix, inter regalia, was set upon the Altar.
4. That diverse of the Prayers in it, and this manner of anointing, were taken
verbatim out of the Roman Pontifical. 5. That after the Coronation, I solemnly
offered the Regalia at the Altar in the Kings name.
Ans. To which I shall give this Answer:

1. That the Form of the Kings Coronation was made and agreed on by the Answ.
whole Committee, according to a former Book I had of my Predecessor; and I was
but a Minister to the Committee in what I did.

2. That the anointing in Form of a Cross was made by my Predecessor, not by
me, who supplied only the place of the Dean of Westminster.

3. That I was commanded to bring this old Crucifix, being inter regalia, and
to place it on the Altar.

4. That admit the Prayer objected, be taken out of the Roman Pontifical; yet
if it be good as it is, there is no hurt: we know the story of the cock in the
fable, dum vertit stercorarium offendit gommam: And a Pearl is never the worse
if raked out of a dunghill.

5. I was to offer the regalia at the Altar by my place, and the Book of Common
Prayer approves of offerings.

To which was Replied:

1. That it appears by his own Diary, that he had the chief hand in compiling
Reply.
this Form, and that it was collected, corrected by himself, though other
Bishops were joined in consultation with him.

2. That though the Unction were made by his Predecessor, which he makes not
appear; yet it was principally by his direction, and himself makes special
mention of it, That it was in medum Crucis, in the Margent of his Book.

3. That he makes no command appear from any Supreme Authority for his placing
the old Crucifix on the Altar, neither does he allege who it was that gave
him any such command: Therefore it must be interpreted his own voluntary act.

4. That the Prayer it self is not very good, savouring of Papal pride in the
Clergy; and it is no such precious Pearl, as that he needed to rake such a
dunghill of Popish superstitions as the Roman Pontifical is, to find it out to
adorn his Majesty's royal Diadem with at his Coronation.

5. He proves not, that it was his duty thus to offer up the regalia at the
Altar, yea, the Form of the Kings Coronation found in his own study, enjoined
it not, and he pretends no command at all for it: Therefore it was his own
spontaneous act; as for the Common Prayer Book, surely it prescribes neither
this, nor any other solemn oblation at all at an Altar: And so this charge
remains unavoyded.

Fourthly, from Westminster they proceed to the Page 70. to 75.
Universities, first of Oxford, where I was Chancellor, next of Cambridge: In
Oxford they object: Object.


1. That there were some old Crucifixes repaired, and diverse new ones erected
in diverse Colleges there, since I became Chancellor of the University,
whereas there were none before my time.

2. That Communion Tables were railed in Altarwise and bowed to, which they
were not before.

3. That I enjoined all Scholars by a University Statute and Oath to give due
reverence, and bow to the Communion Table, and that my Letter required bowing
and prostation before the Altar.

4. That my visitor at Merton College enjoined the Fellows and Scholars there
to bow to the Lords Table, and questioned Mr. Chainel, and Mr. Corbet for not
bowing.

5. That they used Copes in some Colleges, which they did not before.

6. That there was a very scandalous Statue of the Virgin Mary with Christ in
her Arms, set up in the front of the New Church porch of St. Mary's next the
street, to which Mr. Nixon deposes he saw one bow, and another pray.

7. That I enjoined Latin Prayers all the Lent, not used before my
Chancellorship, since the Reformation.

8. That I enjoined by a Statute all Regent Masters, to read and sing what
should be prescribed them in solemn Processions.

I Answer:

1. That there is no proof at all, that I knew of the repairing and setting up
of Answ.
these Crucifixes, or that any complained of them to me. That the Crucifix in
Lincoln College was set up by the Bishop of Lincoln, and it would have been
thought hard, if I should have opposed it.

2. That the turning and railing in of the Tables Altarwise is warranted by the
Queens Injunctions, as I have proved.

3. That the Statute enjoyne only due reverence when they come to offer at the
Lords Table, and that my Letter implies a bowing or prostration only, according
to the 95 Psalm.

4. That Sir John Lamb only questioned Master Chainel, and Master Corbet, which
is nothing to me; and Doctor Frewens words are but a hearsay, besides, they
were not punished for not doing it.

5. That Copes are warrantable by the 24 Canon.

6. That the Statue at St. Mary's was set up by Dr. Owen, reputed a reverend
Orthodox Divine, not by me, nor is there any proof I had notice of it, or of
any bowing or praying to it, which might be a mistake in Alderman Nixon.

7. That Latin prayers have been anciently used in the University on
Ashwednesday, and being among Scholars who understand the Language, there can
be no hurt therein.

8. That no Processions are intended in the Statute, but such as our Law allows
in nature of perambulations, the Statutes of the University prescribing, That
nothing shall be done therein but according to the Doctrine and Discipline of
the Church of England.

9. For the Innovations of like nature in the University of Cambridge, they
concern me not, I being not their Chancellor, and not enjoining them, nor made
acquainted with them.

Whereunto was Replied:

1. That all those Crucifixes were erected at Oxford, since he became
Chancellor Reply.
of it: That his own example in his Chapels at Lambeth and Croyden, where he
repaired the old broken Crucifixes at his own cost, were the primary occasions
of setting up those in Oxford, by way of imitation. That he could not choose
but take notice of them being himself several times at Oxford in person, where
he entertained the King, Queen, Prince, and Prince Elector, sundry days:
Besides, having constant weekly intelligence by Letters, and recourse of
Scholars of all sorts to him from the University, who acquainted him with all
particulars there transacted, he could not but take notice, and have exact
knowledge of them: And he being both Chancellor and Visitor of the University,
his not hindering of their setting up at first, not pulling them down, when set
up contrary to our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, was in Law both a
commanding and approving of them. Nam qui non prohibet malum quod potest,
jubet. That none complained to him of them, was his own fault; since none durst
complain against that then, as a crime, which himself first practiced in his
own Chapels, as a commendable action. His Answer to the Crucifix erected in
Lincoln College proves clearly he had knowledge of it; and truly it could not
have been well taken at his hands to pull that down according to Law, unless
he had pulled them down first in other Colleges, and his own Chapel, the
Bishop of Lincoln perchance setting it up, only to humor his Grace, and
manifest to the world, he was but his Ape in this particular.

2. We have already refuted his second Answer as false, and therefore shall
repeat nothing here.

3. That this due reverence, was interpreted by himself in his Speech in
Starchamber, to be a bowing to the Altar or Lords Table: For (says he) THERE
IS A REVERENCE DUE TO IT: Namely, of bowing the body, not only toward, but to
the Altar, DEO ET ALT ARI EJVS, in the dative case, and prostration, not simply
to God, but CORAM ALT ARE DEI and Christi ejus, is prescribed by his Letter, as
much worship as the Devil himself required of our Savior, Luke 4. 7. Si
adoraveris CORAM ME; as the vulgar Latin, or fall down BEFORE ME, as the Margin
of our English Bibles render it; whereas the 95 Psalm, requires no worshipping
and falling down thus before an Altar, but before the Lord our Maker only,
without any mention of an Altar or Lords Table in the Psalm.

4. His Visitors act in questioning those Fellows for not bowing, was his own,
and must concern him, since he did it only in his name and right by his
Commission, in pursuit of his Injunctions: and Dr. Frewens words are express,
that the Archbishop sent him to Master Corbet, when Proctor, requiring and
pressing him in his name to bow to the Altar in regard of his place, else it
would be ill taken. And though these fellows were not punished nor suspended
for not bowing, yet they were often questioned, menaced, forced to obscure
themselves, and desert the College for a time, and had not the Scottish
Troubles intervened, would have been severely punished too.

5. Copes in Colleges, are neither within the words nor meaning of the 24
Canon.

6. Neither the Church Porch, nor statue at St. Mary's being the University
Church, could or would have been erected there by Dr. Owen, without the
Archbishops special license being Chancellor, and supreme Visitor there, as
Archbishop, as himself both pretended, pleaded; and he must needs not only hear
of, but see it too, when he was in Oxford. Therefore the blame thereof must be
his alone: As for the bowing and praying to it, Mr. Nixon swears it directly,
and was not mistaken, as he would surmise to excuse the odiousness of this new
erected Oxford Idol, which gave such public scandal.

7. Its true that Latin Prayers on Ashwednesday only, were formerly used in
Oxford before the Batchellors of Art, but he enjoined such Prayers all the Lent
long in stead of English, which was never done before, to usher in Latin
Service by degrees in an unknown tongue, diverse Townsmen resorting to the
English Prayers in Lent, who could not understand these new Latin ones which he
introduced.

8. This Statute enjoining reading and chanting in solemn Processions, was made
in time of Popery, and Popish processions, and renewed in these New Statutes
made by this Archbishop. Therefore certainly meant of such processions not of
perambulations only, which are not used by the University: And the objected
subsequent Statute, is but a blind to delude the simple for the present; the
Doctrine and Discipline of our Church (in the Universities judgment) being
only written in his breast, The Register of the University of Oxford, p. 183.
quo rectior non stat regula, quo prior est corrigenda Religio, as they write
unto him in their Letter of November 9. 1640. the last recorded in their
Register.

9. Whereas he would assoil himself from the Popish Innovations in Cambridge
University, the guilt of them must originally rest on him alone, for these
reasons.

1. Because they were introduced by his instruments, favorites, creatures
there advanced by him: as Dr. Martin, Dr. Cosens, Dr. Beal, Dr. Lany, Dr. Stern.

2. Introduced in imitation of those Crucifixes, Images, Copes,
Altar-furniture, Genuflexions, which himself had introduced at Lambeth Chapel,
to which they were subsequent, not antecedent.

3. Because though he was not Chancellor, yet he pretended to be Visitor of
this University, and that of Oxford too, as he was Archbishop of Canterbury,
and procured a solemn Decree and Patent for it, to himself and his successors:
Therefore since he did not prohibit, correct, suppress them as Visitor,
according to Law and duty, they will prove his proper Innovations; the rather
because he permitted, countenanced, nay enjoined the like at Oxford by new
Statutes, where he was both Visitor and Chancellor, which was never done in
Cambridge: That he should have no notice of those Popish Innovations there,
which were so notorious to all the Kingdom, so publicly spoken of in every
place, when as he had constant weekly intelligence from thence (as appears by
sundry Letters) of all transactions there, and was so conversant with the chief
Authors of them, is not only improbable, but impossible: Therefore he still
lies under the guilt of this entire charge concerning the Popish Innovations in
our Universities.

Fifthly, from the Universities, I was next traced to Cathedrals, and Collegiat
Churches, where I am charged with introducing, enjoining sundry Innovations
Object. 5.
tending to Popery by my visitors, Injunctions, and new Cathedral Statutes: As
P. 75. to 87


1. Copes. 2. Altars, some of them made of Marble stone. 3. Turning and railing
in Communion Tables Altar wise. 4. Bowing to and toward the Altar and Lords
Table, which I enjoined to sundry Cathedrals by new Statutes, as namely to the
Cathedralists of Canterbury (as Dr. Jackson and Dr. Bletchenden deposed) and
diverse others. 5. Crucifixes and Images. 6. Candlesticks, Basins,
Altar-clothes, with other Altar Ornaments; and they instanced in sundry
particular Cathedrals, as Canterbury, Gloncester, Durham, Winchester,
Chichester, Hereford, Worcester; where these Innovations were introduced by my
Injunctions and new Statutes, to make way for them in Parish Churches, who must
imitate these their Mother Churches.
To the first of these I Answer, that the use of Copes in Cathedral and
Collegiat Churches, is enjoined by the 24 Canon made in Convocation, An. 1603.
therefore Answ.
it was lawful, and no Popish Innovation for me to enjoin them, as I have
formerly proved.

To the second, that Altars, both the name and thing, were in use among the
Primitive Christians and Churches, who were far from Popery, and long before
it; yea, are found both in the Old and New Testament; as diverse learned men
have largely proved.

To the third, that my Injunctions for railing in of Altars, and Lords Tables
Altarwise, with the sides against the East wall of the Quire, is consonant to
the Queens Injunctions, to the practice of approved Antiquity, all Altars and
Lords Tables being generally so placed in Churches in ancient times, both in
this and other Churches of Christendom, as well East as West; and that there is
no matter of Popery in placing and railing in Lords Tables in this manner, as I
have proved at large in my printed Speech in Starchamber.

To the fourth, that I did in the very Statutes for the Cathedral-church of
Canterbury, and others, enjoin the Prebends and Members of the Cathedral, P.
52. to 63
Summa reverentia adorare Deum versus Altar; which bowing to worship God
toward the Altar, as Dr. Bletchenden attested upon oath, was used before the
new Statutes of Canterbury were made, yea, approved, practiced by Dr. Jackson
himself, as readily as by any other Prebends, who has given a greater
testimony against himself, then me: After which he produced his Secretary Mr.
Dell, to testify without oath, that in the perusal of the old Statutes for the
Cathedral of Canterbury, diverse superstitions were put out by the Archbishop,
and by name, Prayer for the soul of King Henry the 8. after his decease. Then
he concluded his Answer thus, That the 95 Psalm did command this kind of
bowing at our entrance into the Church, and that the Knights of the Honorable
Order of the Garter were bound by a Chapter-Order, to bow to God toward the
Altar, when they offered at it in their solemnities, and did still practice it
without guilt or suspicion of Popery: Therefore himself might use, enjoin, and
others practice it, without any guilt of Popery at all, as well as they.

To the fifth, that Crucifixes and Images were not simply unlawful, being used
in the Kings own Chapel: That Images in Churches had been long in use, even in
Constantine the Great his Reign, and long before; therefore no Popery could be
couched in them.

To the sixth, that those are no other then what the King used in his own
Chapple, and had been long time used in the Church for greater Ornament,
luster, it being a disparagement to our Religion, to have God served slovenly
and meanly, as many desired he should be, under pretense of shunning
superstition.

To this was Replied:

1. That neither our Common Prayer Book, nor Book of Ordination, nor Homilies
Reply.
confirmed by Parliament (the only Canons in force to direct us) nor Queen
Elizabeth's Injunctions in the first year of Her Reign, enjoin any Copes in
Cathedrals, more then in other Churches, but condemn, seclude them alike out of
all our Churches, and that the last Common Prayer Book in King Edwards days,
expressly prohibits them: Therefore the 24 Canon (which was never any binding
Law confirmed by Parliament, and expired with King James, if not before) can be
no warrant for their use.

2. That the 24 Canon, enjoins only the chief Minister to wear a Cope, and
that but at the administration of the Sacrament, not at any other season: But
the Archbishop contrary to the Canon, enjoined Cathedrals to provide diverse
Copes, at least four a piece, and prescribed them to be worn, as well when the
Sacrament was not administered, as when it was, and that by others, beside the
chief Ministers: Therefore he exceeded the Canon it self.

3. None of his Predecessors in their visitation Articles, or Injunctions, ever
prescribed, exacted the providing or wearing of Copes in Cathedrals, but
himself alone, and in many Cathedrals they had never any Copes at all, in
others but mean ones, as appears by the Abstract of his visitation, under his
visitors hand, found in his study; yet notwithstanding he enjoined the
providing of new, better and costlier Copes to their great cost, in imitation
of the Roman Pontifical, that so they might be like Romish Cathedrals in
foreign parts. This allegation therefore of his will not excuse him.

Secondly, we grant, that the name of Altars, together with the thing, are
frequent in the Old Testament, to offer Sacrifices and burnt offerings upon,
which were but Hebr. 8. 5. ^ 10. 1. to 6.
types and shadows of Christ's real Sacrifice for us on the Cross, needing no
iteration, yea, not to be iterated without blasphemy, Hebrew. 7. 27. cap. 9.
26, 27, 28. All Altars therefore vanished at his death as mere Jewish types and
Ceremonies; wherefore though in the New Testament, we find the name of an
Altar, yea, thing it self with reference to the Mat. 5. 23. c. 23. 20, 35. Luke
1. 11. Romans 11. 3. 1 Cor. 9. 13. ^hp. 80. 1. 8. Heb^ 7. 13. ^am. 2. 21. Reu. 6.
9. c. 8. 3. ^9. 13. c. 11. 1. ^. 14. 8.
Jewish Altars and Paganish Idolaters only, yet we never find the name Altar
in any text given to the Lords Table; but Altars, and Priests serving at the
Altar, are put in contradistinction to the Lords Table, and Ministers of the
Gospel, 1 Corinthians. 9. 13. 14. c. 10. 16. to 21. Hebr. 7. 12, 13, 14. Christ him
self celebrated, instituted the Sacrament only at a Table, not Altar, yea, he
called it a Supper (which is to be eaten at a Table) not a Sacrifice to be
offered at an Altar, Luke 22. 30. Ioh. 12. 2. 1 Cor. 10. 22. And it is as
evident as the Sun at noonday, by the express testimonies of Origin, Contra.
Celsum. lib. 4. and 7. Minucius Felix, his Octavius, Cyprian, Contra.
Demetriadem, Cyrillus Alexandrinus, Contra Julianum. lib. 9. Arnobius Contra
Gentes, lib. 6. Lactantius de vero cultu. Cap. 24. (who all lived within 300
years of Christ) which Bishop Morton proves at large in his Institution of the
Sacrament, Edit. 2. London, 1635. lib. 6. c. 3. p. 417, 418, 419, and c. 5. p.
461, to 495. By the current sufferage of the third part of the Homily against
the peril of Idolatry, p. 44. (ratified by the 35. Art. of Religion, to which
all Ministers by the Statute of 13. Eliz. c. 12. are to subscribe) Bishop
Jewel in his Defense of the Apology, Artic. 3. Divis. 26. p. 145. Thomas
Beacon in his Relics of Rome, Tit. of Gods Church f. 322. Mr. Calfehill his
Answer to Marshall f. 31. 32. King Edward the 6. and his whole Council in Mr.
Fox Acts and Monuments, p. 1211. with sundry other of our own Authorized
Writers, That the Primitive Christians for above 250. years after Christ, had
no Altars at all, but only Lords Tables: Pope Sixtus the second, first
introducing Altars into the Church, and that the Fathers which succeeded them,
deemed Christ himself and his Cross the only Altar meant and intended. Hebr.
13. 10. which Bishop Morton in his Institution of the Sacrament, Edit. 2.
London 1635. l. 6. c. 3. p. 417 418 419. etc. 5. p. 461. to 465. fully proves.
Therefore the Archbishops bold assertion, that the Scriptures, Fathers, and
primitive, Christians practice, Justify both the Antiquity use and
lawfullnesse of Altars, is a most gross untruth, though averred by his
Creatures Dr. Heylin, and Dr. Pocklington in their late Popish Books published
by his direction. As for our Church, state in the beginning of Reformation,
they were so far from allowing Altars, that they See the Quench Col^ where this
is fully proved
exploded, abolished both the name and thing out of our Common Prayer Book,
Articles, Homilies, Statutes, yea by public Laws and Injunctions commanded
the Altars in all Churches whatsoever to betaken away and removed as
Superstitions, Popish, unfit to be tolerated in any kinds, and set up Lords
Tables in their stead, which continued ever since till this Archbishop turned
many of them into Altars, to introduce the Popish Sacrifice of the Mass again.

Thirdly, The Railing in and placing of Communion Tables Altarwise against the
Wall, like a Dresser, or side Table is not consonant to Queen Elizabeth's
Injunctions, which require the Communion Table (not to be fixed to the Wall or
rayled in close prisoner against it; but) to be removed, when ever the
Sacrament as distributed, and placed in such sort within the Chancel, as
whereby the Minister may be more conveniently board of the communicants in his
prayer and administration, and the communicants may more conveniently, and in
greater number communicate with him. If then it were to be thus removed and
placed conveniently from time to time, then not to be constantly fixed,
impounded Altarwise against the East Wall of the Quire, remotest from the
people: but seated in the Body of the Church (where the Chancell is too small
or inconvenient) or in the Chancell (where it is capacious) near the midst, as
the Rubric of the Common prayer Book; and the 82. Canon Anno 1603. determine.

But the Archbishop objects, that the Injunctions prescribe the Communion
Objection.
Table in every Church shall be set in the place where the Altar stood.

True; Now (says he) the Altar (in every Church) stood at the upper end of the
Quire, North and South, as appears by the practice of the Church.

This we deny as most false: Therefore his conclusion from the Injunction;
Answer:
That the Table in all Churches ought thus to be placed North and South, at the
upper end of the Quire, is a mere inconsequent. To refute this gross dotage of
his, and display his learned superstitious Ignorance to the world, least any
should be deluded with a fond opinion of his great learning, we confidently
affirm, that he neither does nor can produce so much as one President or
Authority in all Antiquity, but only his own groundless confidence, to
justify his assertion. On the contrary we shall offer some few punctual
arguments, presidents, Authorities undeniably manifesting, that Altars and
Lords Tables anciently, not only among Pagans and Jews but (...) the Primitive
Christians and learned Papists themselves* were not rayled in North and South
against the East end of their Quires, but seated in or near the midst of their
Churches or Quires, that all the people might sit, stand, and go round about
them:

Not to trouble you with proofs beyond contradiction of the Situation of See
the Quenchcole. p. 16. to 23. Purchase Pilgrimage l. 4.
Pagan and Jewish Altars in such sort, that the Priests and people might go,
stand, and dance round about them. We shall insist only has the placing of
Christian Altars and Lords Tables in this posture. That these were thus
generally placed in all Churches, will appear by these infallible Arguments.

First, from the very defintion of a Quire, which Isidor Hispalensis Orig. l.

their Lexicons and Dictionaries Tit. Chorus; and others thus unanimously
define; Chorus est multitudo in sacris collecta, and dictus Chorus, quod
intitio IN MODVMCORONAECJRCA ARAS STARENT and ita psaller^ut. If then Quires
had their denomination, From the multitudes standing ROVND ABOUT THE ALTARS IN
A RING or Circle and so singing; then Altars certainly in the Primitive times
were not rayled in against the Wall, as of late they were, but placed in the
midst of the Quire in such sort, that all the people might stand and go round
about them singing.

The 2d. Argument is drown from the forms of Prayers in ancient Liturgies and
Missalls, wherein the Priest standing at the Altar usually prayed. Pro omnibus
his CIRCVMSTANTJBVS; and makes frequent mention Omnium CIRCVMSTANTIVM M^^ui
tibi hoc Sacrificium landis offerunt, For proof whereof you may consult at
leisure, Canon Miss, in Cassandri Lyturgica p. 21. 25. 61. 62. 65 66. 72. 94.
Romri^s in (...) l. 1. c. 66. Durandus Rationale Divinorum. l. 4. c. 53. and
Mr. Fox in his Acts and Monuments, Edit. ult. vol. 3. p. 3. 11. Hence our old
Henrici Spelmanni Council. Tom. 1 p. 589.
Sa^en Canons prohibited a Priest to celebrate Mass alone, upon this ground:
Esse ^nim debent qui ei CIRCVMSTENT, quoe ille salutet, a quibus ei
respondantur, and (...) illi (...) est ille Dominiens Sermo, ubi cunque
fuerint, duo vel tres in nomine (...) illic sum and ego IN MEDJO EORVM. which
is taken out of Gregory. lib. Capitul. c. 7. seconded by Regine De Eccles.
Officijs. c. ^9. and Cassandre Liturgica^. 33. p. 8. Hence Gerardus Lerithicus
de Missa Puel preroganda, resolves thus, Neque Canon [Missa] debet nimium
tacit legi, sed expressa voce, ut a CIRCVMSTANTIBVS posst ^^diri and percipi,
cum CIRCVMSTANTES (...) singular respondere, Amen. Now that all the people
usually stood (...) about the Altar in St. Chrysostomes days is evident by two
passages in his Operum Tom. 4. Edit. (...) Ducaei p. 82. 83. De Sa^erdotio l. 3
and 6. where thus he writes: O miracle! He who sits at his Fathers right hand,
is at that very instant of time handled with the hands of all [in the Sacrament
of the Lords Table] and this is done, not by any juglings, sed apertis and
circumspicientibus CIRCVMSTANTJVM OMNIVM O^VLIS, etc. Multitudinem aspexisse
Altar ipsum CJRCVMST ANTIVM and by his Homil. in Jsai 6. where he writes thus.
D^st thou not think that the Angels, stand Round about this dreadful TABLE and
COMPASS IT ABOUT ON EVERY SIDE? So Athanasius in the life of Anthony makes
^^^tion of Altar^ Domini multorum (...) CJRCVM^ATVM, and Gregory Na^^^nzen.
Oration 21. blames such who intruded themselves unto the holy Mysteries with
(...) hands; and CIRCVM SACRAMMENS (...) etc. All which, compared with that of
the ^. S^rius Council: Tom. 2. l Jewels Reply to Harding, ^ 19.
Council of Constantinople Act. 1. That whiles the Dip^icks were reading, the
people with silence draw together ROVND ABOUT THE ALTAR, and gave ^are. Are
infallible proofs, that Altars and Lords Tables in the Primitive times, and
anciently in Popish Churches where generally so placed that all the people
STOOD or might stand ROVND, ABOUT THEM. Therefore not rayled in Altarwayes
against the Wall.

The 3d. Argument it taken from the (...), of the Priests and Deacons going
round about the Altar when they approached to it, and standing round about it
when they officiated. In the Lyturgy attributed to St. Peter in the Lyturgy of
Saint James, in the Lyturgie attributed to St. Basil and St. Cryso^^oma in the
Aetheop^^^, (...) Missalls, and the Missall of the Christians among the
Indians, the Priest when he approaches to the Altar to officiate begins with
this sentence of the Psalmist, I will wash my hands in Jnnocency, and so will
I, COMPASS, or go ROVND ABOUT THINE ALTAR. And in the ancient Roman Order in
Cassanders works p. 101. 102. 107. 112. 118. 119. I find these passages, that
Bishops when they officiated usually went round about the Altar, and the
Subdeacons stood behind it, Tunc Acolyti vadunt dextra laevaque, post Episcopu
CIRCA ALTAR. Subdiaconi finito officio vadunt RETRO ALTAR, aspicientes
Pontificem stantes erecti, etc. Dionysius Areopagita has this passage, Eccles.
Hierarch. c. 3. CIRCVMSTANT autem eum soli cum Sacerdotibus Ministri selecti.
And Jsiodor Hispalensis de Ecclesiast. Officijs l. 2. c. 8. with Surius Council.
Tom^ 3. p. 298.
Concilium Aquisgran: sub Ludovico Pi^, testify: That Deacons heretofore CIRCA
ARAM CHRISTI, quasi columnae Altaris assistere it. Most convincing proofs,
that Altars generally in all Churches stood a great distance from the Wall, and
were not Rayled in Altarwise against it but placed so that the Bishops,
Priests, Decons, might go and stand round about and behind them.

The 4th. Argument is deduced from the manner and form of Bishops consecrating
Altars prescribed, used even among the Papists themselves in ancient and late
times Durandus in his Rationale Divinorum l. 1. c. 7. number. 15. informs us,
that the Bishop when he consecrates any new Altar, Septies ALTAR CIRCVIT goes
Round about it seven times, to signify, that he ought to take care for all,
and be vigilant for all, which is signified per CIRCVITVM, by this his going
round about it; which he could not do were it railed in against the Wall, and
not set some competent distance from it. In the De Ecclesiae Consecratione p.
260. 263. 264. De Altaris Consecratione p. 290. 295. 298. 300.
Roman Pontifical, we find the Bishop when he consecrates an Altar, is to go
round about it several times, Pontifex CIRCVIT TER ALTAR ad dextram; CIRCVIT
iterum semel Altar ad dextram, CIRCVIT semel Altar ad sinistram. Pontifex
CIRCVIT Septies Tabulam Altaris, aspergens eam, etc. CIPCVIT ter Altar:
CIRCVIT semel Altar: An unanswerable evidence, that even among the Papists
themselves, the Atars anciently stood generally in all places, not Altarwise
against the Wall, as our Communion Tables were lately placed but a good
distance from it, near the midst of the Church or Quire, that the Bishops,
Priests, People might stand and walk round about them.

2ly. We shall manifest it by express Authorities; not to mention any already
cited, which are punctual, St. Augustine de verbo Domini secundum Ioannem
Sermon. 42 says; Christus quotidie pascit, Mensa ipsius est illa IN MEDIO
constituta. Yea Durandus Rationale Divinorum l. 1. c. 2. number. 15. writes thus.
By the Altar out heart is signified, which is in the Midst of the body, as
the Altar is in the midst of the Church, And lib. 5. he gives this reason why
the Priest turns himself about at the Altar, to wit, to fulfill this
Scripture, IN MEDIO ECCLESIAE aperui os meum. Epist. Lector. p. 115. before his
translation of the Greek Lyturgy.
Gentianus Hervetus, and De Graecorum Ritibus Bibl. Patrum. Tom. 18. p. 771.
Genebrard describing the manner of the Greek Church at this day, expresses it
thus, In Graecorum Templis unum tantum est Altar, idque IN MEDIO CHORO, aut
Presbyterio. From these and the forecited authorities, both foreign and our
own Domesticke Divines of chiefest note resolve expressly, That the Lords
Tables and Altars in the primitive times, till private Masses were lately
introduced, stood in the midst of the Quire, Church, People, who came round
about them not at, the East end of the Quire, as of late they were placed. This
is in terminis, affirmed by Hospinian; De Origin Altarium. c. 6. p. 135. by
learned Phillip de Mar^ix Tableau des Differens part 5. c. 6. p. 307. by the
incomperable Lord Mornay, De Missa, l. 2. c. 1. p. 177. by eminent Peter Du
Moulin, in his Nauvante du Papisme Contr. 11. c. 17. 18. p. 1022 1026. and
sundry other foreign Protestants: with whom our own Divines accord: we shall
^ite some few of their words very briefly.

In the year 1533 There was a short Treatise concerning the Lords Supper,
written (as is supposed) by our learned Martyr Mr. William Tyndall, printed
with his works cum privilegio, p. 476. 477. wherein he prescribes; that the
Bread and Wine should be set before the People IN THE FACE OF THE CHVRCH upon
the Lords Table, and that the Congregation should sit ROVND ABOUT IT according
to the pure use of the Sacrament in the Apostles times. Learned Martin Bucer
(sometimes Regins Professor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge in King
Edward the 6. his Reign) in his In his Scripta Anglicana p. 457.
Censure of our English Liturgy writes thus. It appears by the forms of the
most ancient Temples, and Writings of the Fathers, that the Clergy stood in the
MIDST of the TEMPLES, which were for the most part round, and out of that
place did so administer the Sacrament to the People, that they might plainly
hear and understand the things there recited by them Eminent Bishop Jewel See
his life before his works. Sect. 25.

Jnjunctions were made who had a principal hand in abolishing our Altars and

sundry places by pregnant Authorities and reasons, That the Holy Table and
Altar in and among the primitive Christians and Fathers was not made of stone
but wood; and stood Not at the end of the Quire, but in the Midst of the
Church among the People who came round about it and that it ought to be so
placed; producing the Authorities of Eusebius, Augustine, Durand, the Council
of Constantinople, and others to prove it. Doctor Gervase Babington, Bishop of
Worcester, in his comfortable Notes upon Exodus. c. 22. and 27. p. 275 (in his
folio works) writes and proves expressly: That the Apostles and Primitive
Fathers and Christians: had no Altars but Communion Tables only; made not of
Stone, but boards, and removeable. SET IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE, AND NOT
PLACED AGAINST A WALL. Our laborious Dr. William Fulke in his Answer of a true
Christian to a counterfeit Catholic London 1577. Article 15. p. 55. 56. in his
Confutation of the Rhemish Testament. Notes on 1 Cor. 11. Sect. 18. on Hebr.
13. Sect. 6. and in his Defense against Gregory Martin: c. 17. affirms in
direct words; that the Altar and Lords Table anciently stood In the midst of
the Quire or Church, so at the Ministers, Deacons, and people might Stand round
about it, and not against a Wall as your Popish Altars now stand, as is easiy
to prove, and has often times bin proved, and it seems you confess as much.
But so they cannot stand about your Altars, except some of them stand on the
top of the Wall, or in the Window: and Mr. Cartwright in his Notes on the
Rhemish Testament on the 1 Cor. 11. Sect. 18. writes, That in the premitive
Church, the Lords Table was situated IN THE MIDST OF THE CHVRCH AND PEOPLE,
not against a Wall. Dr. Andrew Willet in his Synopsis Papismi, the 9th.
General controversy, Quest. 6. Error 53. p 496. expostulates thus with the
Papists for placing their Altars at the end of the Quire, contrary to
Antiquity. Why bring they not their Altars down to the BODY OF THE CHVRCH? we
see no reason why the Communion Table may not be set In the body of the Church
as well as in the Chancell, if the place be more convenient and fit to receive
the Communicants. Learned Bishop Morton in his Institution of the Sacrament.
Edit 2. London 1635. l. 6. c. 5 Sect. 15. p. 462 writes, That the Table of the
Lord anciently stood in the midst of the Chancell, So that they might
Compass it round; which he proves by Eusebius, Dionysius Areopagita,
Chrysostom, Athanasins, Augustine, Lindan, and Dr. Fulke; yea Dr. Williams late
Bishop of Lincoln now of York, in his Holy Table Name, and thing asserts and
proves the same at large for which this Arch-Pre ate fell foul upon him in the
latter end of his Speech in Starchamber; If then all these Testimonies may be
credited before the Archbishops bare affirmation, neither Altars nor Lords
Tables anciently stood Altarwise, North, and South against the East end of the
Quire in our own or other Churches, as he falsely avers they did. 3ly. We shall
evidence this by Presidents abroad and at home. For forraiegn Presidents. In
the famous Church of Tire which surpassed all others in Phaenici^, for its
splendour built in the time of Constantine the Great the Altar was placed in the
MIDST; as Eusebius, Ecclesia. Hist. l. 10. c. 4. records in express terms.
Altarique denique tanquam Sancto Sanctorum IN MEDIO SANCTV ARII SITO, etc. It
is storied by Socrates Scolasticus. Ecclesiast. Hist. l. 5. c. 22 and
Nicephorus: Ecclesiast. Hist. l. 12. c. 34. That in the great Church of Antioch
in Syria, the Altar stood not to the East, but toward the west part of the
Church; Sacra Ara, non ad Orientem, sed ad Occidentem versus, collata fuerat:
And so not Altarwise as this Archbishop pretend. W^llafridus Strabus, de R^bus
Ecclesiastis. l. 4. c. 19. records: That in the Temples only built to God, or
cleansed from the filthiness of Idols, the Altars were placed toward diverse
climates according to the convenience of the places; there being no place where
God is not present: That in the great Church at Jerusalem, built by Constantine
the Great and his Mother over the Sepulcher of our Lord, in a Round form, in
the Pantheon at Rome, dedicated by Pope Beniface to all Saints, and in the
Church of St. Peter, Altars were placed not only toward the East part, but
likewise distributed into other parts and quarters of them. Chemnitius in his
Examen Concilij Trident. pars 4. avers, and our opposites confess it. That in
the Catacombe at Rome, THE ALTAR STOOD IN THE MIDDLE; and that in St. Peter's
Church it self in the Vatican, the high Altar stands before the QVIRE, to wit
in the middle of the Church or Chancell, as an Italian Author explaines it, in
his description of this Church. Platina, in the life of Pope Nicholas the
third, records, That the Altar of St Mary in Rome, through the great inundation
of Tibur in this Popes days, was surrounded with water, ROTVNDE quatuor
pedibus; Therefore it stood not against a Wall. Anastatius, De vitis Romans
Pontif. p. 68. 69. writes, that Pope Sergins in the year 694. made a
foure-square veil about the Altar in Saint Peter's Church at Rome having 4.
white and 4. Scarlet Curtains, JN CIRCVITV ALTARJS, round about the Altar,
which stood not therefore against a wall. In the great Cathedral of Rome it
self, Anno Dom. 1547. as William Thomas, an eye witness, in his History of
Italy and Thomas Beacon out of him, f. 282. attest, the Altar on Christmas day,
when the Pope him self and all his Cardinals received the Sacrament, STOOD IN
THE MIDST OF THE CHAPEL OR QVIRE, the Pope sitting in a Throne of wonderful
Majesty behind it Rerum Germ. Script. Tom. 1. p. 590. 591.
Sigismund. the Monk in his Chronicon Augustinum, Anno 1483. pars. 1. c. 1.
relates, That in the Ancient Cathedral Church of Augusta, dedicated to Saint
Afra, there were two Quires and two Altars standing under two Arches: That in
the body of the Church were 4. Altars; the chiefest of them was the Altar of
St. Denis placed, versus OCCIDENTEM in part Septentrionali, non juxta murum,
sed quasi IN MEDIO. Alb. Crantzius Metrop. l. 1. c 9. and Hospinian de Orig.
Altarium c. 6. writed that Wit^kind found the face of Charles the Great, full of
alacrity after he approaches, Mensam Templo Mediam, the Lords Table placed in
the Midst of the Church, to receive the Sacrament at it: And the same
Hospinian in the same Chapter records, that in the Reformation made at Zurick
Anno 1523. The High Altar was placed where the Font had anciently stood (near
to the West Door, not the East end of the Quire.) In brief, the very Roman
Cerimonial l. 1. c 12. p. 70. informs us, that even of late times many Popish
Altars stood not against the wall, but distant from it, as these clauses prove:
Quod si Altar parieti adhaereat, etc. Si Altar sit A PARIETE SEIVNCTVM, etc.
Therefore to rail in all Altars, Lords Tables and place them Altarwise against
the East end of the Quire wall North and South, as this Archbishop did, is to
be more Popish, more Superstitious then the very Papists themselves, even in
foreign parts.

To come to Presidents nearer home; Our venerable Beda in his Eccles. Hist. l.
2. cap. 3. relates, that the famous great Church of St. Augustins in
Canterbury, it self (built by Augustine the first Archbishop of that Sea) had
an Altar standing almost in THE MIDST OF IT and that in the North Isle, not
East Habet haec Altar IN MEDIO PENE SUAE: this was with in 700. years of
Christ. Yea Everden a Monk, and Master In his Britani Edit. ult: p. 409,
Cambden out of him: records; That the Monks of Saint Edmunds Bury in
Suffolk, whiles they laid the foundation of a new Chapel in the reign of
King Edward the first, found the walls of an old Church built ROUND [which we
think was first built to Saint Edmonds service] So as the Altar STOOD AS IT
WERE IN THE MIDST: In the Church of Carmarthen both the high Altar and Lords
Table Anno 1555. Stood in the midst of the Church, as Master Fox Acts and
Monuments, Edit: 1610. page 1404. 1406. records: and in Saint Patricks Church
in Dublin, the High Altar stood about the midst of the Quire under the first
Cross, a Yard and more beneath the Arch where the E: of Corks Tomb now stands;
and that on all solemn Feasting days, they Went Round about the Altar: as
appears by a Letter written from thence to this Archbishop himself (endorsed
with his own hand) by Master Benjamin Culme, dated from Dublin, April 19.
1634. In fine, learned Doctor Answer of a true Christian to a counterfeit
Catholic printed at London, 1577. Artic. 15. page 55. 56.
Fulke informs us, That the Altar usually stood in the MIDEST of the Church,
whereof some symptoms remain in our Cathedral Churches. Moreover, if you mark
the most part of our Churches in England, you shall plainly see, that the
Chancels are but additions builded since the Churches, in likelihood by the
Parsons, who disdained to have their places, in the midest of the people, as
the old manner was. Also you may see some Churches builded round, as at London
the Temple, and another is at Cambridge of the same fashion, and some Churches
have the Steeple at the East end very unhansomly, and the Rood loft. Again,
many Churches have cross Isles in which the people cannot see the Chancell,
when they were builded; For such Churches as are late erected have the Churches
and Chancells all of one building, and are made of such fashion, that one may
see the High Altar in every part of them.

From all these reasons and authorities we may infallibly conclude, that Altars
and Lords Tables generally in all Christian Churches were always placed in the
midest of the Church, or Quire, not rai^ed in Altarwise (as of late among us)
against the wall. Therefore the Archbishops groundless surmise to the contrary
and his maine Argument, from the Queens Jnjunctions founded on it, is both
false and frivolous.

Now whereas he Objects, that there can be no Popery in placing Communion
Tables Altarwise, we answer, that if we consider this situation of them simply
in it self, perchance it may be true. But if we observe that Priests private
Masses, brought in this situation of Altars first of all into the Church of
Rome, and that the end of this new placing of them is, to turn our Lords
Tables into Altars, to imitate the Papists, and make way for private Masses, as
all other concurrent circumstances manifest, then it favors of See the
Quenchcole p. 201. to 208
Popery in the highest degree. Finally, we shall observe the Archbishops
juggling and falsehood in this particular. In his Speech in Starchamber he
averreth. page 53. 14. And yet here is nothing done either by violence, or
command, to take off the Indifferency of the standing of the holy Table, either
way, but only by laying it fairly before men how fit it is there should be
Order and uniformity. And yet we have proved, that he by his special
Jnjunctions under Seal, and by private Letters to his Vicar General, enjoined
all Lords Tables to be placed and rayled in Altarwise; yea excommunicated,
censured, fined in the High Commission such Ministers and Church-Wards as
opposed or refused to obey his Injunctions herein, as the Cases of Master
Chancy, the Churchwardens of Beckington, John Premly, Ferdinando Adams, and
others evidence.

Fourthly, We reply, that the Archbishop in his Starchamber-speech, p. 45. 46.
makes this averment, And yet the Government is so moderate [God grant it be not
too loose the while] that NO MAN IS CONSTRAINED, NO MAN QUESTIONED, only
religiously called upon, venite, Adoremus, Come let us Worship; that is, bow
to, and toward the Altar: Yet here we have himself confessing, and others
testifying upon Oath, that he enjoined all Scholars in the University of
Oxford, all Officers, Prebends in Cathedral and Collegiat Churches by special
Statutes [to which they were all compelled to swear Obedience and Conformity]
to worship God with highest Reverence toward the Altar, to bow devoutly to,
toward it at, their approaches thereunto, which none were ever thus strictly
obliged to do by special Laws and Oaths in the very darkest times of Popery.
That Doctor Jackson did approve, practice this bowing to the Altar for a time,
it was by force only of these new Statutes and Oath, as himself deposes, for
which he professes his hearty sorrow: and whereas Doctor Blechenden swears,
that some Prebends used to bow before these new Statutes, it was only by reason
of this Archbishops Injunctions and daily practice both at Court and in Lambeth
Chapel. For his expunging of the prayer for King Henry the 8. after his
death, out of these Statutes, it no way justifies nor extenuates his Injunction
of such Popish Altar-Adorations. For the 95. Psa. it commands us only, to
worship, fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker; not toward or before
an Altar, which is not the Lord our Maker: Neither did the Archbishop himself,
not the most superstitious Popish Prelate or Clergy man in England ever yet
use to Worship and fall down to God, before or toward the Altar, just when
this Venite, Adoromus was read; which requiring no such Worship at the very
instant it is reading, much less exacts it after or before its reading. For
the Knights of the Garters Chapter-Order made in times of Popery, in imitation
of Popish Priests, it is no binding Law to any but those of that Order, in
their solemnity, which being merely Civil, and if it be Deo and Altars
ejus, jointly; then certainly superstitious, Popish, nay Idolatrous too,
cannot be fit for imitation of Protestants.

Fifthly, We reply, that these Crucifixes, Images being unlawful to be made.
condemned by Our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Writers, Church, and all
sound Antiquity, as we Page 59. 103. to 108.
have proved; and Constantine the great condemning them: their pretended
Antiquity, or use in the Kings Chapel, can no ways justify his re-erecting
them in Cathedralls. And here we cannot but observe the Archbishops
Legerdemain, and gross abuse of his Majesty's Chapel.

First, himself introduced Crucifixes with other Popish Innovations into it,
which he afterward by way of imitation prescribed to Cathedralls; And then
being charged with this practice in Cathedralls, he justifies himself by His
Majesty's Chapel, where he takes Sanctuary; just as if a Cutpurse should
justify the cutting of a man's purse in Paul's Cathedral because he formerly
picked another man's pocket in Whit-Hall Chapel, which is nothing else, but to
wipe off the present charge by the next preceding, which lies so heavy upon
him, and to justify this subseouent crime of his by another anteceeding it. But
in truth this is a mere devise (...) draw an Odium on His Majesty, and his
Chapel, who must Patronize (...) Popish Traiterly Actions, since we have
proved these Innovations of his in Cathedralls to be directly taken out of the
Roman Ceremonial, Pontifical, and brought in by their prescription; not
learned from the Kings own Chapel, as he falsely pretends.

Sixthly, To his Altar Ornaments, and trinkets in Cathedralls which he would
justify by the Kings Chapel too, when expressly taken out of the Roman
Pontisical and Ceremonial in imitation of foreign Popish Cathedralls; we
shall return the self same answer, and close up all with his own sentence in
his Star Chamber Speech, page 55. (where he passes judgment against himself
in these following words) Nor has the Kings Chapel any Prerogative (if that
may be called one) above any ordinary Church, to disserve God in any
superstitions Rites; Where give me leave to tell you, that the King and his
Chapel, are most wrongfully, and with scorn abused. Undoubtedly they are so
by these undutifull answers of his; whereby he has justified to the utmost
each particular of this his charge, which he has in no sort extenuated nor
taken off from himself in any particle.

Sixthly, They proceeded in the next place from Cathedralls, to charge me with
Pepish Innovations in Object. 6.
Parish Churches and Chappells; which charge is reducible Page 87. to 114.
to these heads.

First, my enjoining Churchwardens to remove and rail in Communion Tables
Altarwise; as in the case of Saint Gregory's, and other Parishes.

Secondly, Prescribing the people to receive the Communion at the new rayles
kneeling.

Thirdly, Enjoining Ministers to say Second service at the Communion Table
rayled in Altarwise.

Fourthly, setting up of Crucifixes and other Images in Churches, Chappells,
Glasse-windowes; particularly in the new Chapel by Tuttle-fields, in
Westminster.

Fifthly, Prescribing these Innovations in visitation Articles, by Bishop Wren,
Bishop Mountague, Bishop Pierce and others; and forcing Churchwardens upon
Oath to present all those who submitted not to them.

Sixthly, punishing and censuring those in the Star Chamber, High Commission
and elsewhere, who opposed or submitted not to these Innovations: by name,
Master Peter Smart, Master Charles Chancy, Master Miles Burkit, the
Churchwardens of Beckington, Ferdinando Adams, John Premly, Mr. Henry
Sherfeild, Mr. John Workman Mr. Prynne, Mr. Burton, and Doctor Bastwick.

Seventhly, my Chaplains purging out a passage against Images taken out of the
very Homilies, in Doctor Featlies book.

Eighthly, My licensing of Popish Pictures and Crucifixes to be printed in
London, by one ^^^ke, and to be bound up with our English Bibles.

To the first, I answer in General, that this removing and placing Lords
Tables ANSWER.
Altarwise, is warranted by the Queens Injunctions, as I have formerly
evidenced: As for the case of Saint Gregory's, the Table was not turned by me,
but by the Deane and Chapter of Paul's: And when it came to the Council Table,
I did there only deliver my opinion, and oppose the Queens Injunctions against
Bishop Jewels opinion and Master Fox, there pressed: and the Order made
therein, was made by the King and Council then present, not by me alone.

Secondly, I pressed none to come up to receive at the Rayles, no further then
the Common Prayer Book prescribes, which enjoynes the people to draw wear and
take the Holy Sacrament for their comfort.

3ly. Reading Second service at the Lords table is no Innovation, it has bin
ever since my rememberance constantly practiced in Cathedralls, and is
warranted by the Rubric.

4ly. I gave no order for setting up Images or Pictures in any parish Church;
nor yet in the new Chapel at Westminster, and Mr. Brown swears, it was Dr.
Nowel that directed and paid him for his work there, not I.

5ly. I made neither Bishop Wrens, nor Mountagues Visitation Articles, nor
Oaths, they were their own, and if they have ostended in making them, they
must answer it themselves, some of them having bin particularly questioned for
them already.

6ly. For those particular persons cases objected, I shall answer them in order.

1. For Mr. Smart, he was censured by the high Commissioners of York for a
Schismatic and Scandalous Sermon, not by me who had no hand in his censure.

Secondly, For Mr. Chancy, he spoke contemptuous (...) against the rail, that
he would set it up in his Garden: He was suspended only till he did submit,
after which he did submit and confess his fault, and then was absolved.

As for the words I used to his Advocate witnessed by Mr. ^^^^brand, it was
when he was over bold, and it is usual with Courts to check Counsel in this
kind, when they oftend in such nature.

Thirdly, For Mr. Burkit, There were 5. Articles against him, besides that
which was read, and he was prosecutest, censured for them al, not that only
which is objected.

Fourthly, Ferdinando Adams, extremely interrupted my Visitors, and Bishop
Wrens Visitors too in their Visitation at Ipswich by locking up the Church
Doors against them; for which high astront Process was awarded against him.

Fifthly, John Premly his prosecution was the Act of Sir Nathaniel Brent, and
it was for an high contempt.

Sixthly, For Mr. Sherfield, he was censured by the Major voice of the Court,
not by me alone: and Mr. Caryll deposed that the Picture he brake was only
conceived to be the Picture of God the Father; not that it was so: But admit it
were, yet it was not lawful for him of his own Authority to pull it down and
break it, no not though it had bin the Picture of Jupiter himself; This I did
then affirm, for which I had the Authority of St. Augustine, and Bishop
Davenant. Yea in Constantine the Great his time, as Eusebius writes in the
third Book De vita Constantini c. 52. 53. 54. No private Christians of their
own heads durst destroy the Jdols that were then worshipped, nor the temple of
Aesculapius, wherein the Devil himself was adored, til Constantine the
Emperor gave express command, and appointed certain men, whom he
particularly employed, to demolish them. It is true he pleaded, that he
demolished it by the Authority of the Vestry; but the Vestry had no authority
themselves to do it, therefore they could not derive it unto him. But it was
Idolized and adored by some. True, but this appeared not till the hearing of
the cause, and was unknown before.

Seaventhly, The purging out of a Passage against Images in Dr. Featlyes
Sermons taken out of our Homilies; was no act of mine, but my Chaplains, who
must answer for it, yet there are other passages therein left which are
smartenough against Images and their adoration: And Dr. Featly never complained
hereofto me.

Eighthly, The Bibles wherein these Pictures are showed were Secretary
Windebanks and Dr. Ducks which is nothing to me: yea one of them is a Latin
Bible printed beyond the seas, at Amsterdam, a place free from superstition,
not here Indeed I first saw one of these Bibles in Mistress Kirkes hands,
whereupon I sent for one of them my self, and then acquainted the Lords of the
Council with it, who resolved they should not be sold publicly, nor laid upon
stalls, for fear of giving scandal, but privately; whereupon I told Mr. Wally
as much, which he has testified, But yet this is no Innovation, for the old
English prin-Bibells are full of Pictures.

Ninthly, Mr. Workman was justly suspected for inconformity; he was censured
for other things, as well as for passages against Images, as appears by his
sentence, As first for his words against Dancing. 2ly. For saying Images in
Churches were Idols (though they are not Idols till they are worshipped) and
that they were no better then stews; an unfitting expression. 3ly. For saying
that Drunkards were preferred. 4ly. That the Election of Ministers was in the
People. 5ly. For praying for the King of Sweden before our King. 6ly. For
preaching against the Government of the Church established by Law. 7ly. For
speaking against Pictures in private houses as well as in Churches. For those of
Gloucester questioned for granting him an Annuity, and then sued in the High
Commission, they were not many, but only the principal Offenders: and it was
lawful to call them into the High Commission, because their grant to him was in
affront of authority; their Fine was but small 10. ^ a piece, and that was
pardoned: As for Mr. Workman himself being put from his Ministry by sentence,
he was unfit to teach School, or practice Physic, for of leavening others
with his dangerous opinions.

10ly. For Mr. Pryn, Mr. Burton, and Dr. Bastwick I answer, 1. That the
Prosecution against them in Starchamber was in a legal way, for seditious
Schismatic and libellous Books. 2ly. That the rejecting of their answers
under their own hands and taking them pro confesso was no act of mine, but of
the whole Court. 3ly. That the expunging of Mr. Burtons Answer, was not done by
me, but by the two chief Justices, to whom it was referred by the Court, who
must answer for it if unjust, and that the Copy of his answer found in my Study
interlined with black-lead, so far as it should stand, was not intersined by
me. 4ly. J gave no sentence against them at all, but only Justified my self
and my proceedings against their calumnies. But it has bin objected, that Mr.
Cockeshut gave an account of the proceedings against them to me from time to
time: therefore I was the cause thereof. I confess he gave me such an account,
and it was just and fit he should do it, because the cause concerned not only
myself in some sort in particular, but the Church of England in general, of
which I ought to take care according as my place and duty required: But I was
no cause of any irregular proceedings: Yea, but I gave thanks to the Lords in
the close of my Speech for their sentence and Justice on them, though I
censured them not my self: True and it was no more then I ought to do in
behalf of the Church: But yet after the sentence given in my Epistle to his
Majesty, I excited him to put it in execution. No, I only left it to his
Majesty's consideration to forbear or execute it, as he in his justice and
wisdom should deem meet.

To this was replied, 1. in general; that the Archbishop in his speech in
Starchamber, p. 53. has this expression concerning railing in Communion Tables
Altarwise Reply
in parish Churches: And though it stood in most Parish Churches the other way
yet whither there be not more reason the Parish should be made conformable to
the Cathedral and Mother Churches, then the Cathedralls to them, I leave to
any reasonable man to judge. So as his Innovations begun in Cathedralls, were
purposely introduced there first of all, to draw on Parish Churches to Popish
conformity with them in these Innovations. Next, in particular we reply: that
the alteration of the standing of the Lords Table and railing it in Altarwise,
was no ways warranted by the Queens Injunctions, but contrary to them, as we
have largely manifested. That though this was not done immediately by himself,
but by the Deane and Chapter of Paul's, yet he was the Original author of it,
and justified it when complained of. That he publicly checked the Council,
Parishioners and sir Henry Martin before the King and Lords for opposing this
Innovation, and alleging Bishop Iewill and Mr. Fox against it: desiring his
Majesty to take these Books out of the Church, if they made no better use of
them then to oppose this Novelty. That he carried himself more like an
Advocate then Judge in this Cause, and when the King himself was satisfied and
would have it stand as formerly, his violence was such, that he overruled both
King and Council, and drew up the Order forecited in their names for
establishing this Innovation which favors of his style and spirit, the guilt
whereof must rest principally on him.

2ly. The coming up to the Rayles was pressed by his Visitors, Agents
authority, and those excommunicated who refused to come up and receive at the
New Rail; to which certainly it was never the mind of the Common Prayer Book
the Communicants should draw near, since there were no Rayles to draw near
and kneel at till this Archbishop enjoined them to be set up, in imitation of
the Papists, as we have proved: but this drawing near, is rather a drawing
near to Christ by faith, with our hearts and affections, or else a drawing
near to the body of the Church of Chancell where the Lords Table is to be
placed, and to the Minister officiating, as it is expounded by the Q^eens
Jujunctions; and 28 Canon. The Table when the holy Communion shall be
administered shall be placed in so good sort within the Church or Chancel, as
thereby the Minister may be more conveniently heard of the Communicants in his
prayer and administration, and the Communicants also may more conveniently, and
in more number communicate with the Minister.

3ly. We answer, that the Lords Table was ordained only to administer the
Sacrament See the Quenchcole. (...) 9. to 235
thereat, not to read second service at it, for which the Reading Pew is
appointed as the Common Prayer Book, the Homilies of the worthy receiving the
Sacrament, and reparing Churches; Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions, the Canous made
1571. p. 18. and the 82. 83. Canons Anno 1603. resolve. Now this Archbishop
enjoined second service now to be read at the Lords Table when there was no
Communion, and where it was rayled in at the upper end of the Quite, not
brought down into the body of the Church or Chancell; contrary to the Rubric
in the Common Prayer Book, which expressly determines: That the Epistle and
Gospel (chief parts of this second service) shall be read where the two
Lessons are, with a loud voice, that the people may hear the Minister that
reads them the Minister standing and turning himself, as he may best be
heard of ALL such as be present (which he cannot be if he read them at the
upper end of the Chancell remote from the people, where the Churches are great,
or the Ministers voice low.] This innovation then which was never practiced in
any Parish Church till of late, though used in some Cathedralls, wherein the
Rubric enjoynes the Communion every Sunday in the year at least to be
administered; which was wholly omitted, and the second service at the Table left
to supply it) is directly contrary to the Rubricke, Homilies, Injunctions,
Canon.

4ly. It is evident that Crucifixes were set up in many Parish Churches,
Chapells of the Kingdom, which though we cannot prove to be done by his
express particular Command; yet certainly it was by his example or
encouragement, who repaired and set up Crucifixes in his own Chappells at
Lambeth, Croyden, and one over the Altar in Passion week in the Kings own
Chapel at White Hall. Besides, those who erected them were either his own
Chaplains or Faverites who knew his mind, and did it for to imitate and
please his Grace to gain some further preferments.

For the Images set up in the New b Chapel in Tuttle fields, we [b] have
proved, that the Archbishop promised to bestow a new Window on it: that
thereupon the old Page 93.
was taken down, the Kings Arms removed, and those Images, with the
Archbishops own Arms (as the Donor of it) set up: that his Chaplain gave
directions about the VVindow: and Mr. Sutton swears that the money for new
glasing it was paid since the Archbishops commitment to the Tower by his
direction, as he believes. A clear evidence, that he was the Author and
director of this work, notwithstanding all his shifts to elude it.

5ly. Though the Archbishop made not these Bishops Visitation Oaths and
Articles; yet he made all of them Bishops, who durst do nothing in their
Diocese or Visitations but by his direction; to whom they gave an Annual
Account of their proceedings in writing, as we have manifested. Besides, its
apparent that all these Visitation Articles were made in pursuance of his own
Archiepiscopall Injunctions, Instructions, and himself approved of these their
Oaths, Articles, never checking nor questioning them for them, though their
Metropolitan: yea himself prescribed the self same things in his
Metropoliticall Visitations, by printed Articles, written Injunctions, or
private Jnstructions, as these Bishops did in imitation of him. Therefore he
must Answer for these their Articles, Oaths, proceedings as far forth as
they, who were but his Instruments.

Sixthly For his Answer to the particular Cases, we shall return these Replies.

1. That though Mr. Smart was censured by the High Commission at York, yet he
was first imprisoned here at London, and transmitted from the High Commission
here to York by this Archbishops means; who complied with Dr. Cousin in his
prosecution, and disposed of his livings after his deprivation, as we can prove
by sundry Letters found in his Study; As for Mr. Smarts Sermon, it was neither
scandalous nor factions, but Orthodox, and Iuditious, against the Popish
Jnnovations introduced in the Cathedral of Durham, where he was the ancientest
Prehend, deserving rather applause then any censure, as both Lords and Commons
have resolved upon a full hearing, and awarded him reparations and Damages for
his unjust censure.

2ly. Mr. Chancy spoke no contemptuous words at all against the Rail, nor of
setting it up in his Garden: His suspention was illegal, not only without, but
against Law and Canon; As for his submission, it was forced, and a mere art to
deter others from opposing his Graces Popish Innovasions, the only prosecutor
appearing against him. And his shaking up or menacing of his advocate, an
unlawful act, to discourage him from making any defense, and subject his
Client to a censure. Therefore inexcusable.

3ly. The main Article against Mr. Burkit, was only for his and the
Churchwardens removing of the Table when the Sacrament was administered into the
body of the Church without the rayles, according to the Rubric, Queen
Elizabeth's Injunctions, and the 28. Canon, the other Articles being but
frivilous, not insisted on: And for this he was molested in the High
Commission, yea a traditio Satana, a turning over of him to Sir John Lamb
pronounced against him, who used him like a Lion a Wolf in a Lambs Skin.

4ly. For the Churchwardens of Beckingtons most severe, illegal, harbarous
prosecution, we have proved by the deposition of Mr. John Ash, a Member of the
Commons House, that the Archbishop himself since his Imprisonment in the Tower
confessed, that Bishop P^^res their Dioces^n did do nothing herein, but by his
direction. If therefore the rule in Law be true, Plus peccat Author (...)
Actor, he must be far more guilty both of their prosecution, Excommunication,
and heartbreaking submission, then Bishop Pierce, his Instrument.

5ly. For Ferdinando Adams, he was excommunicated in the Archbishops name by
Mr. Dade his Surrogate, and this Excommunication pleaded in Bar of his Bill
in Starchamber. The process, Pursivants sent out to apprehend him, and the
imprisonment of his Attorney till he withdrew his (...), were all by the
Archbishops procurement. His shutting Bishop VVrens Visitors out of the Church
at Jpsmich unless they derived their Authority by Letters Patens, from the
King, was warranted by the Statut of 1 Eliz. c. 1. Therefore his prosecution,
only for his duty and allegiance to the King against the Bishops disloyal
encroachments, was most unjust and disloyal. 6ly. John Premly, was not
prosecuted by Sir Nathaniell Brent, but by the Archbishop himself, for
opposing his order in the Metropoliticall Visitation, in removing the Lords
Table placed Altarwise, to the place and posture wherein it formerly stood; for
which he was fined, censured, imprisoned in the High Commission, where the
Archbishop sat chief Judge against all Law and Justice, his act being no
contempt, nor offense in Law; but the Archbishops order by Sir Nathaniell Brent
his Visitor, and Dr. Nevells act, a contempt against Law and Canon.

7ly. Mr. Sherfield was prosecuted principally by the Archbishops procurement,
for demolishing according to Law: an Idolatrous blasphemous, false Image of God
the Father, which was openly Idolized* He was then a Justice of Peace,
Recorder of Sarum, and had the Warrant of the whole Vestry (wherein were six or
seven Justices of Peace at that time) to demolish this Image, and take down
the whole Window, which all the Kings Subjects, (and Justices of Peace
especially) have authority to demolish by the Statutes of 3. Ed. 6. c. 10. 3.
Iac. c. 5. The Book of Homilies, and Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions: n. 23.
within their several Parishes without any special order from King or Bishop:
yea, God himself gives special Commands not only to the supreme Majestrate,
but to the Common People also, to destroy Idols, (...) Jmages, and Altars
Exodus 34 13. 14. Deuteronomy. 7. 5. c. 12. 1. 2. ^. Isay 17. 78. In pursuance of which
commands, not only King Asa 2 Chronicles. 14. 3. King Hezechiah 2 Kings 18. 4. King
Manass^h 2. Chron. 33. 15. King Josiah and his people, a Chron. 34. to ^.
demolished and brake in pieces Idolatrous Altars and Jmages: but likewise ALL
THE PEOPLE of the Land went into the House of Baal and brake it down, Altars
and Jmages brake they in pieces, and ^low Mat^an the Priest of Baal before the
Altars: 2 Kings 11. 1^ without any special Warrant or command from King
Ieho^sh or Ieho^ada, (which the Holy Ghost records for their honor.) yet were
they never questioned or fined in Starchamber for it because they had no
warrant from either of them. ^^. after King Hezechiah his Passover, the
Scripture expressly records, 2 Chronicles. 30 13. 14. -- c. 31. 1. That ALL ISRAEL
that were present went out to the Cities of Judah and brake the Images in
pieces, and cut down the groves; and threw down the High places and Altars
out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manassith, until they had
utterly distroyed them all; which is recorded to their Eternal honor by God
himself: nor were they ever questioned or fined for a Riot, in any
Starchamber, or High Commission or for going out of their own limits, or doing
this without a special Commission from the King. Therefore Mr. Sherfield being
a public Majestrate, both as a Justice or Peace and Recorder of Sarum might
much more by the whole Vestries Order, demolish this Idolatrous Picture in his
own Parish Church, in such a private manner as he did, without blame or
censure, having sufficient authority from these Texts and Presidents of
Scripture, and from the forecited Statutes and Injunctions; to warrant it every
man in such a case being a lawful Majestrate, without any special warrant.
Thus the common people in Girmany and else where in the beginning of
Reformation, brake down the Popish Images and Altars without any special
Order from the Superior or Inferior Magistrates, as Mr. Acts and Monu mean vol.
2. Edit. 1640. p. 86. to 98.
Fox and others record; And therefore, his Doctrine of the Archbishops, that it
is unlawful to break down the very Image and Temple of Jupiter and Esculapius
where the Devil himself was worshipped, without the special command of the
supreme Magistrate, is a most impious Paradox; for if the supreme Magistrate
will give no such command, these Idols, Devils shall still be to erated,
worshipped to Gods dishonor, and Religions slander, in despite of all the
people and inferior Magistrates. As for the place of Eusebius, it only proves;
that Idolatrous Statues, Images, Temples, were demolished by the Emperor
Constantines special command; but that the Christians under him, might not
lawfully have defaced them without such a special command, especially after a
General Statute and Edicts published by him for their demolishing, without
being liable to a seveer censure [the only thing in question] is no ways
warranted by, nor deducible from Eusebius, nor Saint Augustine. Yea had Mr
Sherfields zeal outrun his discretion in this act, it deserved rather
applause then censure, from a Protestant Prelate, yet this Bishop was so far
from excusing, extenuating, that he aggravated his pretended offense beyond
all bounds of Law, Justice, Conscience, pleaded as zealously for the
lawfullnesse of Images in Churches, and of this abominable Idol of God the
Father, as the Pope himself could have don't; yea he abused Master Sherfeild in
his speech and censured him with the highest, though a Bishop, when some
temporal Lords excused, yea acquitted him. And though this censure was not his
alone, but carried by the Major voice, yet his voice, Speech, violence
occasioned, and aggravated it. For his evasions, that this Picture was
conceived to be the picture of God the Father as Master Caryl deposed; not a
picture of him in truth: It is a most childish evasion, for the Scripture is
express, That God being a spirit, an invisible infinite Essence, can have no
true pillure, likeness, or similitude made of him by any corporal visible
representation, Isay 40. 18. to 27. c. 46. 5, 6 Acts 17. 29. Romans 1. 23. 24,
25. whence every such Image of God is termed, a lie in Scripture, Isay 44. 20.
Hab. 2. 18. Romans 1. 25. etc. And if ever any Image of God were a lie, then
certainly this, as has bin proved. Now, whereas he pretends, it appeared not
it was adored and idolozed till the hearing, it is certain it appeared to Mr.
Sherfield long before the hearing or demolishing of it as he deposed in his
answer, and this appearing by witnesses upon Oath to the Bishop and whole Court
when the cause was heard, made his unjust and heavy censure, far more
abominable to God and man.

Eghtly, Mr. Workman was principally censured for his preaching against Images,
though his expressions were the very words of our Homilies. The other
particulars were all justifiable, true, and no ways censurable except the
sixth, which was pretended, but not proved. Therefore his censure most unjust,
and his censuring of some of those of Gloucester that joined in a grant of
Annuity to him under the City Seal though the Fine was but small, and
afterward remitted, was far more unjust.

1. Because the grant of this Anpuity was not only an act of Charity, but
justice and equity, punishable by no Law and highly to be commended.

2ly. Because they were censured in their private natural Capacity, for what
they acted only in their politic, as Members of the Corporation under their
Common Seal, wherein the whole City were engaged as much as they.

3ly. Because they damned this grant of which they had no cognizance, to starve
a faithful Minister and his Family, who had no other Livelihood. As for his
prohibiting him to teach School, to practice Physic, when he had put him from
his Ministry without any just cause it was a treble tyrany and oppression, he
being enforced to take this course only to supply himself and his family, for
which the Law of God and nature enjoynes him to provide, unless he will 1 Timothy
5. 8.
be worse then an Infidel: and doubtless he must needs be worse then any
Infidel who had the heart to do it upon such a poor pretense, that he might
infect others with his opinions, to wit, of the unlawfullnesse of Images in
Churchs, or private houses the very approved, resolved Doctrine of our
Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Writers, Church.

9ly. For that he alleges by way of justification and excuse touching the
most barbarous censures of Mr. Prynne, Mr. Burton, and Dr. Bastwick: We reply,
1. That his hand was to all the Warrants for their Illegal commitments, crose
imprisenments before their censures. That the Books for which they were
questioned were neither scandalous, Seditious nor Schismatic, but necessary
Apologies, Pleas against his unjust tyrannical proceedings in the High
Commission, and Popish Innovations in the Church to subvert our Religion. That
himself in his Starchamber Speech (and Heylin and Dove after him) confesses
justifies the truth of these Innovations wherewith those Books did charge
him: all which the former and this present Parliament have unanimously
complained off and voted to be illegal, Popish, destructive to our Religion.
Therewere these Books were neither Scandalous, nor Libellous.

3ly. Both the proceedings and sentence against them are voted, adjudged by
both Houses to be altogether illegal unjust barbarous, contrary to Magna
Charta, the Laws of the Land, and liberty of the Subject, and unparralel'd in
any age; therefore ordered to be utterly rased and taken off the file, as unfit
to remain upon record to prejudice posterity.

4ly. Their prosecution proceeded principally from him, the Orders for shutting
them up close prisoners, denying them pen ink, paper, and speech with one
another, were procured by him. The Orders for denying them liberty to put in
their Answers under their own hands, taking them pro confesso, were made when
himself sat and Voted in Court, being both prosecutor party and Judge; the
sentence was given; He sitting in Court, though particularly excepted against
though he gave no Vote in the Censure it self, yet al know he was the cause
and contriver of it before it was given, yea he approved and thanked the Lord
for it, in his Speech, when it was given caused it to he most seveerly executed
when given against the will of those that gave it instigating his Majesty to
the bloody execution of it; afterward when executed; denied Mr. Pryns servant
liberty upon Rail to attend him during his wounds set his hand first to all
the Warrants for sending them to and close imprisoning them in remote Castles,
and after that for banishing them into foreign Islands, where they were so
strictly mewed up, that neither friend, Wife, Children could have the least
access unto them for their releife, nor they procure liberty of pen ink or
paper to write unto them for necessaries. Yea, had not he engaged his
extraordinary power and malice in their prosecution, neither the Court, Judges,
Officers, nor Lords, had bin so extravagant, so unjust in their proceedings,
Censures, Executions against them nor their Council so overawed as they were,
nor they denied liberty to answer for themselves, and to impeach their
Opposites by a Cross Bil; which if admitted (as it ought of right and justice)
it, would have prevented their, heavy Censure, elsewhere, which probably would
have fallen short of this he is now likely to incur. All which considered,
this part of the charge sticks fast upon him in each particular.

7ly. Himself sent for Dr. Featly, and commanded him to carry his Sermons to
his Chaplin to peruse, who thereupon expunged this and other passages out of
them after they were printed, to please his Lord; and his Chaplains Act in this
case is his own. And though other passages against Images remained, yet no
reason can be given for expunging this [being the direct words of the Homily,]
but his complyancy with the Papists: Yea, Dr. Featlie swears expressly, that he
did complain of it to Sir Edmond Scot, who told him it would be bootlesse to
complain to the Archbishop, who would undo nothing his Chaplain had altered.

8ly. For the Popish pictures, we have proved them printed in London by the
Archbishops own authority and direction, that himself saw and approved them
whiles in printing, being the very same with those his Chapel windows, the
Masse-Booke, and Boethius a Bolswort, found in his study: That they were
ordinarily bound up in Bibles and sold in shops, of which the Stationers
complaining to him he thereupon gave them the foresaid answer himself. But
that the Lords of the Counsel gave any such order he produces no proof at
all. In few words, if the pictures were lawful, to be bound up in Bibles; why
then did he give order that they should be only sold in private, not in
public? If unlawful, Popish, Idolatrous, or superstitious, contrary to the
Scripture, our own Statutes, Homilies, Jnjunctions, VVriters, as we have
proved them, then they ought not by his direction, to sell or bind them up in
Bibles, no more privately these publicly, And whereas he Objects, that the
Latin Bible produced wherein some of these pictures were bound, was printed at
Amsterdam; we grant it. But the Pictures in it, were printed and bound up with
it here in London, not at Amsterdam, and these Pictures by the Archbishops own
direction were bound and sold with many English Bibles; in which act he so much
gloried, instead of being ashamed of it, that he would have these Bibles thus
bound up with Pictures, called the Archbishops Bibles, by way of distinction.
As for the English Bibles printed with Pictures in Queen Elizabeth's days,
they had no Note.
other Pictures in them, but only of the Arc, Temple and such like, not any
Pictures of Christ, the Virgin Mary, or any persons of the Trinity. All which
considered, this part of his charge sticks still upon him in each particular
notwithstanding all his evasions.

Seventhly, They Object against me the Consecration of Churches and Chappells
Object. 7.
as a Popish Innovation; tending to introduce Popery among us, and have Page
114. to 228.
instanced in my consecrating of Creed-Church, St. Giles Church in the fields;
and the Churchyard there; for consecrating whereof the Parish paid me 15. l.
The Church of Stanmore Magna, my Chapel at Aberguilly, the form, and
furniture whereof were excepted against as Popish, the Chapel of Hamer-Smith,
where they allege, I consecrated the first stone when it was laid, the
Chapel of Roe-Hampton; and that I would have consecrated other Chapells
Cambridge.

To this I answer first in general; that the Consecration of Churches is very
Answ:
ancient and warranted by Scripture and Ecclesiastical stories. In the Old
Testament, we read that the Tabernacle, with all the Vessels, Ornaments
thereto belonging were solemnly consecrated by Exodus 4^. 9. 10, 11.
Moses; That afterward when the Temple was built, it was solemnly 1 King. 8. 2
Chro. c. 5. 6, and 7.
dedicated and consecrated to God by King Solomon, and all his Princes and
people. After this when the Temple had bin shut up and defiled, the Priests and
Levites by 2 Chro. 29
Hezekiah his command, sanctified and cleansed both it and the Vessels
thereof. So 2 Chr. 34. 8
King Josias purged the House of the Lord. After which when the Temple was
re-edified, the Children of Jsrael, the Priests and the Levites kept Ezra. 6 15
16, 17.
the dedication of the House of God with joy; and offered in the Dedication of
the House of God an hundred bullockes, which Feast of Dedication, was observed
by the Jews even in our Saviors time, as we read in the New Testament, John
10. 22. In the reign of Constantine the great, when Christian Churches began
to be built, or re-edified: we no sooner read of their building, but of their
solemn consecration and Dedication; as of the consecration of the Church of
Tire with sundry others mentioned by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History,
l. 10. c. 3. and Devita Constantini, l. 4. c. 40. After which we find this
practice continued in the Christian Church in all ages, as Ecclesiastical
Histories, the Consecration Sermons of sundry Fathers, the Canons of ancient
Councels and the Canonists in their titles De Consecratione Ecclesiarum, prove
at large. Wherefore this can be no Popery, ner Innovation. Yea if Churches were
not consecrated, then I say, they could not be termed Holy, for it is the
Consecration makes them holy. And if places be not holy then persons also
cannot be holy, when they are consecrated and entered into holy Orders. As for
Bishop Pilkinton and Archbishop Parker, they speak not simply against
consecrations in general, for they were consecrated Bishops and the book of
Ordination is confirmed by Parliament, nor yet against consecrating of Churches
in general, but against the Popish consecrations of them used by some modern
Romish Prelates. For my form of consecrating them, it was not taken out of the
Roman Pontifical, but that which was used by Bishop Andrews, from whom I had
it: This form I followed at Creed Church and the rest. Secondly, To the
particular consecration of Churches Objected, I answer.

First, to that concerning Katherin Creed-Church. It was testified, that I came
thither in a Pompous manner; I deny it; it was only in a grave and seemly
manner. It is Objected, that as soon as I came within the Church door I fell
down upon my knees: True, it was no more then my duty; being an Oratory; Number.
14. 5. c. 16. 22, 45. c. 20. 6.
Moses and Aaron fell down on their faces at the door of the Tabernacle: 2 Chronicles. 29. 26. 29, 30.
Hezekiah and the people bowed and worshipped as I have proved at large in my
Speech in Star Chamber: And, Psa. 95. 6.
O come let us worship and fall down, and kneell before the Lord our Maker, is
the common Introitus in our own and other Lyturgies. It is objected, I
pronounced the place and ground holy: I did so, and it is an ordinary and
legal Speech, there being a relative though not an inherent holiness in
Churches Dedicated to Gods service. Hence we read in Justinian Codicis, l. 1.
tit. 5. this Title DESACROS ANCTIS ECCLESIIS, as they are there often styled:
Therefore Churches are holy, and their consecration makes them so. Whereas it
was said, I threw up dust into the air: This I deny: and where it was
alleged, that this was in imitation of the Roman Pontifical; that is a
mistake, for the Pontifical prescribes Cinis, a hes not dust to be cast
abroad, and Greek Letters to be made therein, with many other vanities. For my
form of consecration, Bishop Andrews made it, from whom I desired a Copy and
had it, which I observed. It was objected that the form of prayer I used, is in
the Mass Book and Roman Pontifical; It may be so, many other very good
prayers are in it, yet they be good. It was further alleged, that I objected
Doctor Denisons Sermon to him at his censure in the High Commission: I Objected
only his extravagances, and that was no hurt. For St. Giles Church, it is true
I consecrated first the Church and then the Churchyard which is the usual
manner; as for the fees amounting to 15. l. I returned them again, and
bestowed them on the poor of the Parish.

But it has bin Objected, that these were no new Churches, but Churches only
new repaired: therefore not to be re-consecrated. I answer, that there was some
new ground taken in at Saint Giles, and admit there were still the same
longitude and latitude, yet the walls and structure being for the most part
new; the Churches in this respect were new, and to be new consecrated.

Thirdly, to the consecration of the Objected Chappells, I confess their
consecrations; and though there be no express form for consecrating of
Chappells in the Pontifical, nor mention in Ecclesiastical story of Chapels
consecrations; yet seeing they are Oratories, and Eusebius testifying, that
Oratories were consecrated in Constantines time, there is the like warrant and
Antiquity for consecration of them, as of Churches. For my Chapel at
Aberguelle, I consecrated, and put a name upon it, (as Saint Augustine says,
we dedicate Churches to Saint Peter) for distinction sake; and though I had a
relation to the beheading of Saint John Baptist in my Dedication of it, I hope
there is no hurt therein. For the pattern and furniture of the Chapel
produced, as if it were mine at Aberguelle, it is a mistake: for it is the
pattern of Bishop Andrews Chapel and furniture (which I caused to be written
out) as the indorsement of it proves, viz. 1623. Chapel and furniture as it
was in use by the Right Reverend Father in God Lancelot Andrews, Lord Bishop
then of Winton.

I had no such furniture in my Chapel there. For the Wafer basket and the
rest, they concern not me, yet Wafers have bin always used and are at this
day in the Greek Church and in Westminster Abbey too. Whereas it is objected,
that I hold there is a badge of Holiness put upon our Churches and Chappells
by a Bishops breath, I answer no, but there is an awsulnesse, put upon them;
For my prayer at the laying of the foundation stone of Hamersmith Chapel,
there is no hurt, nor superstition in it. In fine, I hope there is is no High
Treason to be found either in the one or other, in consecrating Churches,
Chappells or foundation stones.

To this brave flourish of his for the Antiquity and lawfulness of the
consecration Reply.
of Churches, of Chappells, we shall return a full reply. To his Presidents
taken out of the Old Testament we answer.

1. That Moses had an express command from God Himself to consecrate the
Tabernacle, with all the vessels thereof, by anointing them with consecrated
Oil, Exodus 40. 10. 11, 12. [they being types of Christ to come;] but we have
no such command from God, to consecrate Churches, Churchyards, Chapels
Altars, Vestments; which are no types of Christ, already come.

Secondly, This consecration was made by Moses the Temporal Magistrate (not by
Aaron the High Priest) without any other ceremony then mere annoynting the
Tabernacle and its Vessels, implements, with oil: Therefore no warrant for
Bishops consecrating Churches, Churchyards, Chappells Altars, Vestments, with
other ceremonies, without any anointing them with oil.

Thirdly, this consecration was only Temporary, Jewish, ceremonial, abolished
by Christ's death, Col. 2. 14. to 23. Heb. 7. 12. c. 9. 1. to the end, and cap.
10 1. to 22.

Fourthly, King Solomon did not consecrate the Temple not the Vessels and
Court thereof, with Oil, as Moses did the Tabernacle; but 1 Kings 8 2 Chronicles.
5. 6. and 7.
after he had brought the Arc, Tabernacle and all the Holy Vessels into it,
with praises, thankesgivings, instruments of Music; and after the cloud and
glory of the Lord had filled the House, he made an heavenly prayer only in the
midst of the Court (not in the Temple) before all the Congregation of Israel,
kneeling on his knees, and spreading forth his hands toward heaven, [using no
such prayers or ceremonies as the Bishop used:] and all the hallowing that we
read of in this story is, Solomon's hallowing the middle of the Court, that was
before the house of the Lord (and how was that?) only by offering burnt
offerings and peace offerings, 2 Chronicles. 7. 7. 1 Kings 8. 64. From which History
and practice, of his we shall observe.

1. That if there were any consecration of this Temple, it was made only by
King Solomon himself, not by the High Priest, Priests, or Bishops, who now
appropriate all consecrations of Churches, etc. to themselves alone.

Secondly, That the Oracle of the house where the Arc was placed, is called
THE MOST HOLY PLACE, even before and without any consecration of it at all, 1
King. 8. 6, 10. 2 Chronicles. 5. 7. Therefore the consecration made it not most
holy, but only the use to which it was designed.

Thirdly, That the Atke, Tabernacle, Vessels were brought into the Temple, and
praises, thanksgivings, there solemnly sung to God, who manifested his presence
there, filling it with a Cloud and his glory, so as the Priests could not stand
to minister; before Solomonmade is prayer, which some term a consecration;
whereas this Archbishop fell to his consecration, before any public prayers,
thanksgiving Psalms, Service, or Sacraments administered.

Fourthly, That if this prayer were a consecration; it was made only in the
outward Court, not in the temple it self, whereas the Archbishops
consecration was made in the Church, not Churchyard.

Fifthly, That the Hallowing of the Court (and so by consequence of the Temple,
if properly consecrated) is by the text ascribed only, to Solomon's offering of
burnt offerings, meat-offrings, and the fat of the Peace Offerings: not to any
other prayers, exorcismes, Unctions, or Ceremonies, which Offerings being long
since ceased, and not to be used by Christians, the consecration of Churches
and Churchyards must likewise cease, unless it be only by performing
public duties of Gods worship in them. Therefore this president of Solomon and
the Temple under the Law; is no warrant at all for our Bishops consecrating of
Churches, Churchyards, Altars, Vessels or Vestiments under the Gospel.

Fifthly, the sanctifying and cleansing of the Temple and Vessels of it
prescribed by Hezekiah, but executed by the Priests and Levites; was only the
clean, sing out of the Idols, Jdolatrius Altars, rubbish, filth and
uncleanness of the Temple, which they found, and carried out thence into the
Brook Kidron; with their scouring of the Vessels, which had been polluted,
as is plain by the letter of the text, 2 Chronicles. 29. etc. c. 33. 15, 16.
compared together. Therefore it makes nothing for any Episcopal consecration
of Churches, but only for keeping them clean from filth and Idols.

Sixthly, that of Ezra. 6. 16, 17. is no warrant for the hallowing of Churches
or Chappells. For it only mentions; That the Priests, Levites, and Children of
Israel kept the Dedication of the house of God with joy; and offered at the
dedication of the house of God an hundred Bullockes, two hundred Rams, 400.
Lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he-Goates according to
the number of the Tribes of Israel. And they set the Priests in their divisions
and the Levites in their courses for the service of God. But of any special
Prayers, Ceremonies, Unctions, and the like, used at this Dedication, by the
Priests or people, we read not one syllable. Therefore this their Dedication
of the Temple, was only their offering of burnt offerings, of sin offerings
in it to God, and ordering the services of the Priests and Levites in it.
Therefore no President for the consecration of Churches by our Prelates, since
such oblations, such courses of Priests, Levites are ceased with Christ, Hebr.
7. 11. 12, 18.

Seventhly, the Feast of Dedication mentioned John 10. 22. was not of the
Temples Dedication, but of the Altars, instituted by Judas Maccabeus and his
Brethren, to be annually kept by the space of 8. days in the Month Casl^u, 1
Mac. 4. 56 59. as Interpreters and the Margin of our Bibles resolve: which
being of no Divine Institution, kept only by the Superstitious Jews, not by
Christ, or his Apostles, (who are not said to observe, but only to be at
Jerusalem when it was the Feast of Dedication John 10. 22.) It can be no
warrant at all for the consecration of Altars, much less of Churches now.

Finally we answer, that we find no mention in Scripture or Classical
Writers, of any consecration of Jewish Synagogues, to which our Churches
properly succeed, but only of their Tabernacle and Temple, in such sort as you
have heard; with which our Churches, Chapells have no proper Analogy: That
this Argument of the Archbishop drawn from the presidents in the Old
Testament, is borrowed from no Orthodox Ancient Father or Council, but only
from the Popish Canonist, Gratian De Consecratione. Distinct 1. who thus
concludes from these presidents. Si enim Judai qui umbrae legis deserviebant,
hoc facicbant, multo magis nos quibus veritas patefacta and gratia per Iesum
Christum data est, Templa Domino aedificare, and pro ut melius possumus orare,
eaque DIVINJS PRECIBVS ET SANCTIS VNCTIONIBVS, suis cum Altaribus and vasis,
vestibus quoque and Reliquijs, ad divinum cultum explendum utensilibus DEVOTE
ET SOLENNITER SACRARE and non in alijs quam in Domino sacratis ab Episcopis,
and non a Corepiscopis [qui sa^e prohibiti sune] nisi summa exigente,
necessitate, Missas celebrare nec sacrificia offerre debemus Domino. You see
out of what Popish quiver this Archbishop drew this leaden shaft of his.

To his pretended antiquity for the consecration of Churches, Chappells,
Altars, etc. since Christ's time: we answer, first, that Centur. Magd. 3 cap. 6.
p. 148.
before the reign of Constantine the Great there is no credible president or
authority at all for dedication of any Churches: And that Eusebius who (De vita
Constantini l. 3. c. 24. to 40. 45. 47. 49. 50. 51. lib. 4. c. 39) makes
mention of Constantines and his Mother Helenaes building of diverse stately
Churches at Bethlehem, in the Mount of Olives, in Constantinople, Nycomedia,
Mambre in Phaenicia, and elsewhere, and by his Edicts enjoined Christians to
build Churches, yet makes no mention of any Edicts for their hallowing. True it
is, that De vita Constantini. l. 4. c. 43. 45. 47. we read, that Constantine
summoned a General Council of Bishops to Jerusalem, to settle some differences
in the Church, and that at this meeting he thought best to consecrate, and
thereupon kept the Feast of the Dedication of the Temple which he had built at
Jerusalem over our Saviors Sepulcher, which the Priests, then Consecrated, but
how? with prayers, disputations, preachings expositions of Scripture, and
receiving the Sacrament, as he expressly defines c. 45. But of any other
particular Church then this thus consecrated by his appointment, we find no
mention. Indeed the same Eusebius in his Ecclesiast Historiae, l. 10. c. 3. De
Encauijs ubique locorum celebratis, writes, that Churches being reedified under
Constantine, Deinceps celebre spectaculum, nobis omnibus optabile and
vehementer desideratum, ante omnium occulis proponebatur, Dedicationum scilicet
festivitates per urbes singulas, templorum nuper aedificatorum consecrationes:
which intimates, that Churches, then new built were See Centur Magd. 4. c. 6.
p. 408. Sozom. l. 2. c. 26.
solemnly dedicated to God in most places; but what those Dedications of them
were, he informs us in the same Chapter, That they were Panygericall Orations
in praise of their founders, etc. of which he cites a memorable one made to
Paulinus Bishop of Tire in the next Chapter. These Dedications therefore of
Churches then, were far different from those used by the Papists and this
Archbishop now. We read not then of any consecration of their foundation
stones, any pompous processions to them, any knocking at the doors, by the
Bishop, crying with a loud voice, Open, Open ye everlasting doors, etc [a
clear perverting of Scripture;] of no flying open of the doors there-upon; No
falling down upon the marrow bones; and saying: This place is holy, etc. No
casting up of dust in the air, no such prayers, processions, round about the
Church; bowings to the Altar, pronouncing of cursings and blessings, Peepings,
recoylings, and other Antic tricks as this Bishop used at Creed Church, and
elsewhere, no Hallowing of Altars, Altar-clothes, Vessels, Vestments,
Churchyeards, Chappells. Therefore these Consecrations in Constantines days,
are no warrant at all for his, the rather, because not made by Bishops alone,
who now monopolize them.

After Constantines time, there is very rare mention of any Consecration of
Churches in Ecclesiastical Histories, or the genuine writings of the Fathers,
till Popery overspread the Church, and Popes brought it in by forged decrees,
Gratian himself, being unable to cite so much as one Fathers Authority for it
[Di Consecratione distinct.. 1. where he professedly handles this subject] but
only the forged Decrees of Popes, and the Canons of two or three late Popish
Counsels; there being no Canons concerning it in any ancient genuine Synods:
Yea the consecration of Churches was so much neglected even in the very darkest
time a of Popery above a thousand years after Christ that See here p. 127.
O^hobon the Popes, Legate and the Synod held under him here in England in Henry
the third his Reign, acknowledge, that there were many Parish Churches and
some Cathedralls then uncrusecrated although built long before.

Now to prove the consecration and merely Popish [as of late ages it has been
used at least] it is agreed by Gratian, Platina, the Centuryators, Thomas
Beacon, and others, that Pope Hyginus, Gelasius, John, Nicholas, Clemens,
Sylvester, Felix and Gregory (whose spurious Decrees are cited by Gratian De
Consecratione Distincti: and Surius in his 1. and 2 Tome of Counsels) were the
first inventors and prescribers of this Ceremony of Consecrating Churches and
Altars: prescribing.

1. That no Church should be built or consecrated without the command,
Authority, or consent of the Bishop of Rome.

2ly. That every Church should be consecrated with a Mass, and no Mass said
or Sacrament administered [unlesso in case of absolute necessity) but in a
consecrated Church, and at a consecrated Altar.

3ly. That these Priests should be deprived who said Mass or officiated in
unhallowed places or at unconsecrated Altars.

4ly. That no Altars should be consecrated without the Relics of Saints, and
if any Altars were consecrated without them, they should be pulled down.

5ly. That all Stone Altars should be anointed and consecrated with Chrisme.

6ly. That no Church should be consecrated wherein a Pagan was interred,
unless his corpse were first dug up and cast out of it.

7ly. That the Timber of a consecrated Church, and Vestments once consecrated,
though worn out and decayed should not be converted to any other good use but
burnt to Ashes and these to be laid up safely in some place within the Church,
least they should be polluted with the feet of those who passed by.

8ly. That none should touch the consecrated Altars, Vessels, Vestments, or be
enabled to keep them, but consecrated persons.

9ly. That if the Altar of any Church were renewed; or the walls new built, or
defiled with murder, bloodshed, or the meeting or burying of Heretics
therein, that then it should be re-consecrated; otherwise not.

10. That no man whatsover should See Friderici Lindebr ogi Glossorium. Tit.
Crucem sigere. Capit Caroli et Ludovici. l. 5. c. 229. Iustiniani Novella 67.
131.
presume to build any Church before the Bishop of the City first came to the
place, and fixed a Cross thereon; and the Patron informed him, what stipend he
would allow for the finding of Tapers, Gardians to keep it, Priests to Officiat
in it, agree to have it consecrated, and to sprinkle the floor and Court
thereof with holy water.

Of latter times, many Ethnicall, superstitious Exercismes, Conjurations,
Unctions, Ceremonies, Notions, and frantic inventions have bin added by Popes
and Prelates to these consecrations recorded at large in the Roman
Caeremonialls, Pontificalls, Thomas Beacons Relics of Rome, Mr. Calfehill and
others: whereby it will appear to be most Popish, superstitious in the highest
degree, whatever is pretended to the contrary. Whereupon it was exploded,
condemned by our Church, State, Bishops, and other writers in the beginning of
Reformation, as Popish, Jewish, Superstitious and by foreign Protestant
writers (See Aretij Problemata Locus 121 De Encaenijs) as we have formerly
proved. Therefore it must needs be a Popish design in this Archbishop to
revive it now.

For his Argument, that Churches cannot be called Holy, unless consecrated by
a Bishop; it being his consecration that makes them so. We answer.

1. That Bishop Pilkinton and others define this very Doctrine of his, to be
Popery, as we hay proved, so does Aretius too.

Secondly, That the most Holy Place, was so styled, though never consecrated 1
King. 8. 6. 10. So Jerusalem is called very frequently, the Holy City: Matthew 4.
5. c. 27. 53. though never consecrated. And God told Moses the place whereon
thou stand is holy ground, Exodus 3. 5. though never consecrated by a Bishop.

Thirdly, Our own ( Of Repairing and keeping clean Churches. p. 78 79.
) Homilies inform us, That the Church is counted and talled Holy, not of it
self (nor yet for its consecration by a Bishop) but because Gods people
resorting thither are holy, and exercise themselves in holy and heavenly things.

Fourthly, The hearing and preaching of Gods Word, Prayer, and receiving the
Sacraments therein are sufficient of themselves to sanctify and make it holy
without any other consecration. See 1 Timothy 45. Centur: Mag: 3. and 4. c. 6. and
Aretij Problemaia Locus, 126. who resolves further against this superstition:
Vana est etiamilla superstitio, quod dicunt; Nisi dedicatur Templum, non posse
ibi preces haberi, non exandiri orantes, non recte praedicari verbum Dei, nec
Sacramenta administrari: quae sententia MANIFEST JVDAISMUM RESIPIT; Christus
tamen praemonstravit, Horam nunc esse, ut very adoratores, nec in monteistonec
Jerosolymis, sed ubique lieorum Deum adorent in spiritu and veritate.
Athanasius sane non erubuit preces habere and populum ad audiendum verbum Dei
convocare in Templum Alexandrinum majus, quamvis nondum esset Dedicatione
consecratum: nondum enim jusserat Imperator. Id nostri hodie magnum nefas
ducunt.

Fifthly, sanctification in its own nature, is nothing else, but a sequestring
of any thing from a common or ordinary use, to a religious and sacred purpose.
And this may be done without a Bishops exorcisme or conjuration; in which respect
the first borne, first fruits, and oblations among the Jews were termed Holy,
though never solemnly consecrated, because appropriated and devoted unto God.
For his other Argument, that if places be not holy persons cannot be so; and
our Church allows of the consecration of persons; Ergo of places. It is both a
fallhood and absurdity. For first, it is God and his Spirit only that make
persons holy, not Prelates; who never sanctify places as they do persons.
Secondly, Our Church allows only of the Ordination (not consecration) of
Bishops and Ministers, confirmed by Statute (many of whom ordained such, are so
far from being holy, that they are most polluted and unclean) but not of
consecrating Churches; utterly exploded by the Common Prayer Book, and book of
Ordination, comprising all the authorized Rites and Ceremonies of our Church,
whereof consecration of Churches is none. And thus much in answer to his
defense in general for consecration of Churches.

Secondly, For the particulars Objected; our witnesses depose, that his coming
to Creed Church, was pompous, not decent, that he fell down on his knees to
pronounce, the place and ground holy, in the name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost; not to adore and pray to God; which the Examples of Moses, Aaron,
and Hezekiah warrant not, who never fell down at the Tabernacle door not bowed
the head and worshipped to consecrate either the Tabernacle, Temple, or Altar.
And whereas he objects, that his pronouncing of the place holy as soon he
entered into it, was legal, etc. we answer.

1. That himself avers, that no Church or place is legally holy, before it be
consecrated; and when he pronounced it holy upon his entrance to it, he had
not consecrated it; therefore by his own doctrine it was not legally holy, when
he pronounced it so.

Secondly, If our Churches be legally holy by their consecration, then the
consecration of our Popish Prelates in times of Popery with superstitious,
Popish Ceremonies, conjurations, Exorcismes, enoylings, processions,
sprinklings with holy water, made them so, since most of them were only
consecrated in, though none re-consecrated since the times of Popery: And if
such Popish consecrations make them legally and really holy, then they are of
as great efficacy at his own or Bishop Andrews his form, and no difference
at all between them.

Thirdly, For Justinian, he makes no mention at all in that Title of
consecration of Churches, and styles them holy Churches, only in respect of the
holy duties publicly performed in them. For his throwing up of dust, two
witnesses expressly depose it, which must overballance his own bare negation:
and there is so little difference between dust and ashes, that they are usually
coupled together as Synonimaes, in Scripture and Authors. That he took his
form from Bishop Andrews, is only averred by himself nor proved by any
witnesses; but that it agrees with that in the Pontifical which we found in
his Study even in terminis, is most clear; and therefore we cannot but presume
he derived it from thence. However, if Bishop Andrews imitated the
Pontifical, and he Bishop Andrews, the charge is still alike, both of them
imitating and complying with the Pope herein. He grants his prayer taken out of
the Pontifical; therefore no doubt the rest, especially his frequent bowings
and Jackanapes tricks at the Altar: which he cunningly pretermits and answers
not. For Dr. Ienison, he objected only his preaching against Images to him at
his censure, and that was no extravagancy. As for the consecrating of Churches
only repaired or somewhat enlarged, we know no Law nor Canon in our Church to
warrant it: And to take sees for it, is both Symony, and extortion. For the
restoring of them, it is only affirmed not proved; and to take them illegally
to bestow them on the poor, is but to rob Peter to cloth Paul.

Thirdly, For the consecration of Chappells and mere private Oratoties, there
is no president in Antiquity; yea Gratian himself and the Roman Pontifical
allow the use of them, without any consecration: Therefore to consecrate them
is to exceed even Popery and Papists in Superstition. As for his Chapel of
Aberguilly his own Diary proclaims his Superstition both in its consecration.
and denomination of it. For the Pattern and furniture of it, his own notes
and papers clearly prove, it was the same with that of Bishop Andrews, whose
form of conscration himself alleges he punctually pursued. And if this were
the true pattern furniture of Bishop Andrews own Chapel Anno 1623. all the
world may justly censure him for a professed Papist, his Chapel Altar, and
their furniture being as Popish Superstitious, Idolatrous every way as the Pops
in Rome, yea exceeding the very Roman Ceremonial and Pontifical For Wafers,
they are directly contrary to the Rubric at the end of the Communion in the
Book of Common prayer; we wonder therefore with what face this Prelate dares
justify them: That a Bishops breath puts only a badge of reverence not
holiness on Churches, is diametrially contrary to what he formerly affirmed.
Perchance he now remembers that Quicquid effecit tale est magis tale? and
therefore Bishops cannot make other things holy with their breath who have
little or no holiness at all in their hearts: For his solemn consecration
prayer at the laying the first stone of Hammersmith Chapel, it has neither
Scripture, Law, Canon, Antiquity, but the Roman Pontifical to warrant it:
Therefore it is merely Popish Whereas he objects by way of jeare, that he hopes
the consecration of Churches and Chapells is no Treason: we answer, that we do
not charge it to be so in it self. But we have proved it to be a branch of
Popery and a gross one too and being introduced by him among other things to
set up Popery, and subvert Religion it will prove Treason in this respect, as
we shall manifest in due time. And so this intre charge remains unavoyded in
any the least particle.

8ly. The next Charge urged against me, Is The Kings Declaration for the use of
sports on the Lords day, prescribing the observation of Revells, Wakes. Feasts
of Dedication likewise, formerly suppressed, where I am Page 128. 155.
accused. Object. 8.


1. For causing this Book to be enlarged, reprinted in his Majesty's name to
prevent the petition of the Justices in Somersetshire, and make way for Mr.
Prynnes censure.

2. For pressing Ministers to read it in their Churches without any Warrant,
suppressing of Sermons censuring those who refused to publish it, (as Mr.
Wilson, Master Player, Master Heiron, Mr. Snelling with sundry others)
encouraging other Bishops to suspend, silence many Godly preaching Ministers
for this cause, pressing this Book, and ordering Churchwardens to present such
who refused to publish it, by Visitation Oaths and Articles.

3ly. For reviving, disorder, by wakes, Revels, and causing the Judges Orders
to be reversed:

To the first of these I answer, That the Kings Declaration for sports was
printed Answer.
and published by his Majesty's special command. Yea I had a Warrant under his
hand to see it printed, and there is no proof at all that it was printed,
published or enlarged by my procurement. Besides, the Declaration is but for
the use of lawful Sports and that only after evening prayer ended: and the
cause of publishing it at that time was partly Barbourous Book of the Sabbath,
who would revive the Jewish Sabbath, and the Jewish rigidities positions of
others touching the Lords day, whose positions drew Brabourne into that Error.
In Geneva it self (as I have bin ceedibly informed by Travelers) they use
shooting in pieces long bows Cross Bows, Musters, and throwing of the bowl
too, on the Lords day as well before as after Sermons ended, and allow all
honest recreations without reproof of their Ministers, yea, Mr. Calvin the
great professor there Instit. l. 2. c. 8. sect. 34. blames those who infected
the people in former ages with a Judicial opinion, that the morality of the
4th. Commandment, to wit, the keeping of one day in 7. did still continue;
which what else is it then in dishonor of the Jews to change the day, and to
affix as great a sanctity to it, as the Jews ever did. And that those who
adhored to their constitutions who broached this Doctrine, Crassa carnalique
Superstitione Judaeos ter superant: Men may be too strict as well as
prophaneherein. Yet I for my part have ever strictly observed the Lords day in
point of practice: And whereas it was attested by Mr. Prynne, that this
Declaration was published to prevent the Petition of Somersetshire for the
reviving of Judge Richardsons forecited order: Sir Robert Philips and many
other Gentlemen of that County complained against the order to the King,
whereupon the Judge was ordered to reverse it, and the Declaration was not
published till after the reversall.

2ly. The Declaration was ordered to be published in the Church; and that was
sufficient warrant to enjoyne Ministers to publish it there, and although no
penalty be prescribed in it to such who should refuse to publish the same, yet
it is employed, otherwise, the command were idle in case of disobedience. That
it was published with intent to suppress afternoon Sermons, that so the people
might ^ave more time for Sports; This could not be, since none were to use any
Recreations till after Evening Prayer ended. That I gave my Visitor command to
suspend those who refused to read it, was only within my Diocese of
Canterbury, not in my Metropoliticall Visitation throughout my province; I
suspended but three Ministers in my whole Diocese, who had first time of
consideration granted them, to wit, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Culmer, and Mr. Player,
only suspended ob officio for their contumacy being men of factious Spirits.
For Mr. Wilson and others being brought into the High Commission for not
reading this Declaration, it was the act of the Court, not mine. As for Mr.
Snelling, he was excommunicated by Dr. Wood not me, and he was questioned in
the High Commission; for not bowing at the name of Jesus, and as well as not
reading this Book, Besides I was not present at his censure there neither did I
expunge his answer. Nor did I press the reading of the Declaration in my
Visitation Articles, if other Bishops did it, it is nothing to me; themselves
must answer for it, not I.

3ly. Feasts of dedication have been of great Antiquity, and in general use
in some Coutries; and there is a lawful use of them for Hospitality, and
increase of love among Neighbors and friends, as the Bishop of Bath and Wells,
with diverse of the gravest Clergy in the county of Somerset certified his
Majesty, who desired their continuance:

If some abuses crept into them as they did in some places, and it seems in
Somersetshire, yet this was no good reason to take away the feasts and meetings
themselves, as Judge Richardson did by his order (for which there were great
complaints made by men of quality) but only to regulate them, and take away
their abuses, which this Declaration does without countenancing any disorders.

To this was replied. 1. That it is clear by the evidence given, and his
Letter written, to the Bishop of Bath and Wells that this Declaration was

by himself, and republished by his instigation and procurement: That himself
put his Majesty upon the reprinting of it, the warrant being written with his
own hand and being without any date at all makes it probable it was procured
since the Declaration printed. The later end of the Declaration it self
concerning Wakes and Revells, compared with the juncture of time when it was
published, manifests that it was thrust out to cross Judge Richardsons order,
and forestall the Petition of the Somersetshire Justices for its continuance,
immediately after its reversall, it having no relation at all to Brabournes
Book. Besides the publishing of it, just when Mr. Prynne was questioned for
his Histriomastix (wherein he censures mixed dancing Sports and Pastimes on the
Lords day) and reciting it in the very information against him, manifests; that
it was likewise reprinted to make way for his first censure in Starchamber.
Moreover some of the recreations mentioned in it are not very lawful upon any
day though the Archbishop affirms the contrary, but certainly unlawful on any
part of the Lords day, even after evening Prayer, as See Sunday a Sabbath The
Divine Tragedy and Histriomastix.
Pathers, Counsels, Imperial Laws, and both Protestant and Popish writers
have resolved. The pretended Practice of Geneva, which he alleges, is but a
Hearesay without proof, borrowed from Peter Heylins profane History of the
(he should have said, NO) Sabbath. part. 2. c. 6. sect. 6. 8. 9. who yet
informs us sect. 9. that Da^noing has bin condemned by French Synods and
writers (as well Protestantas Popish) which yet the Declaration for sports in
terminis allows of on the Lords day, contrary to the practice and judgment of
Geneva. As for Mr. Calvin himself though he differs in some particulars
touching the Morality of the 4th. Commandment from other of our Divines, yet
he in express words condemns. Dancing and Pastimes on the Lords day, not
deemingita Jewish Superstition or rigidity to prohibit such sports thereon,
especially Dancing, as his 71. Sermon upon Job, proclaims to all the world;
and other Geneva Ministers since him, have done the like. That this Declaration
did de Pacto put down afternoon Sermons on the Lords day in most and
forenoone too in many places, by suspending sundry preaching Ministers who
durst not publish it out of conscience, is apparent to al. Wherefore to affirm
this one part of the Archbishops design in reprinting thereof, is a certain
and more then probable truth; and the words of it, that they should use those
Pastimes after Evening Prayer, (not evening Sermon) import as much, some
Bishops grounding their suppressing of Afternoon Sermons on this expression;
which Sermons Peter Heylin in his History of the Sabbath. part. 2. c. 6. sect.
9. and c. 7. and 8. makes to be mere innovations, as does Doctor Pocklington
in his Sunday no Sabbath, both published by this Archbishops command and
approbation. For his own strict observation of the Lords day, it is an
averment without truth. Certainly he that made conscience of its strict
observation himself, would never give way to such a Declaration encouraging
others to profane it, who were apt to do it without such an incitement; nor
suspend such Godly Ministers, who durst not publish it out of conscience, for
fear of encouraging others to profane it. Yea, his pretended strictness of
late times was such, that himself and his servants made it an ordinary
practice in the Somer to go to Bowls and use other pastimes on it, and he sat
constantly thereon at the Council Table about worldly business. 2ly. That
there was no warrant at all in the Declaration that Ministers should publish
it, or to punish any who refused it, has bin formerly proved at large, and
where there is no penalty prescribed in a Law (much more in a Declaration) no
punishment can be inflicted. That he gave express order for silensing Mr.
Wilson, Mr. Culmer, and Mr. Player, is proved by several Oaths, and that they
were suspended diverse years not only ab officio, but beneficio, having nothing
left to support their Wives and Families. That they were obstinate or sactious
is a groundless scandal, not proved, they were only conscientious and would
not disobey God to humor men. That he silenced only these three in his
Diocese was but casual, because others submitted to read the Book; but his
command was general, to suspend all who refused to read it, and those three in
special. That he put not any Article of Inquiry touching the reading of this
Declaration into the Articles for his Metropoliticall Visitation, was his
Jesuitical Art and cunning, to conceal his wickedness and profaneness from
public view, but that he gave private Instructions to his Vicar General in
this his Visitation, to convent and question such who had not read it, who
thereupon did accordingly question diverse good Ministers for this very cause,
you have heard it proved at large by the very Abstracts of his Metropoliticall
Visitations, under his own and his Visitors hands. That other Bishops inserted
such an Article into their printed Visitation Inquisitions, we have fully
proved, as also that they gave an Account to him of the Ministers they had
suspended for not Reading the Declaration according to his Injunctions.
Therefore their Articles of this nature proceeded merely from him, and must be
charged on him, as well as on themselves. That it was the Act of the Court, not
his to bring any into the High Commission for not reading this Book, is a most
false averment; for Mr. Wilson [now (s) Page 149. 150.
a Reverend Divine of the Assembly] was brought into the High Commission by his
own express command and no others, as himself deposes, who personally
suspended him before at Lambheth for that cause both from his Office and
Benefice: and Mr. Page was by his special order brought into the High
Commission as appears by his own Subscription to Francis Thompsons Petition.
That Mr. Snelling was there questioned, and severely censured by the
Archbishops means, who gave Order not to accept either his Answer or defense;
and threatened to burn it; is clear by the proofs Page 151.
forementioned. That his censure was only for not publishing the Declaration,
is evident by the sentence it self, if well observed, his not bowing at the
name of Jesus, being put in only for a Cipher, but not insisted on at the
hearing.

And whereas he pretends, he was not present at his censure, which he proves
not; we know he was vertually, if not personally present thereat; yea, his
unjust suppression of his tendered Answer and defense, was the only cause of
his censure; which if received were so learned, solid, satisfactory, that
profaneness and injustice it self could not have imposed such a censure on
him. Thirdly, annual Feasts of Dedication of Churches are not so ancient, but
that we know their Original: The Feast of Dedication of the Altar, instituted
by Judas Maccabeus was the Sea Aretii Problemata Locus 126. de Encaeniis.
first of this kind we read of: Indeed Solomon kept a Feast for 2 Cor. 7. 8.
seven days space when the Temple was dedicated: And Constantine the great,
with some others in his days, when Churches were dedicated, made a great
Feast; but that those Feasts continued annual in perpetuity, I find no mention
in any approved Antiquity. These annual Feasts of dedication were first
invented by the spurious popish Decrees of Pope Felix and Gregory, thus
recorded by De Conservatione Distinct. 1.
Gratian; Solennitates dedicationum Ecclesiarum, Epissoporum and Saterdotum per
singulos annos sunt celebrandae: Solennitates Ecclesiarum dedicationum and
Sacerdotum per singulos annos solenniter sunt celebrandae, ipso Domino exemplum
dante, qui ad festum dedicationis Templi, omnibus id faciendi dans formam, cum
reliquis populis eandem festevitatem celebraturus venit, sicut scriptum est;
Facta sunt Encoenia in Hieru olymis, and hyems erat, and ambulabat Jesus in
Temple in porticu Solomonis. Quod autem octo diebus encaenia sint celebrando in
libro Regum perfecta dedicatione Templi cernas. Other Decrees then these of
these two Popes (the latter whereof is built upon clear mistakes of Scripture)
cannot be produced. These Bacanalian feasts are thus censured by Aretius,
Problem. 126. Hodie vero Solennitates instituuntur; tote die bibitur, tote die

And were wholly abolished among us by the Injunctions of King Henry the eighth,
and Statute of 6 Edw. 6. c. 3. by reason of the idleness, excess and great
mischiefs they produced to men's souls; Yea, many Judges riding the Western
Circuit, suppressed the Wakes and Revels kept upon them from time to time for
these abuses and other weighty Reasons. Yet this profane Arch-prelate revives,
re-establisheth them by this DECLARATION, causes those Judges Orders to be
reversed with a strong Hand, by a Plot and Certificate from Bishop Pierce and
others, checks, nay punishes Chief Justice Richardson, removes him from that
Circuit, and lets loose the Reins to all Licentiousness, profaneness,
whereby infinite mischiefs ensued, as we have fully proved: So that this whole
Charge sticks still upon him.

Ninthly, from these ceremonial and practical, they proceed to doctrinall
innovations in matters of Religion, wherein I am charged; First, with an
endeavor Object. 10.
to introduce and propagate Arminianisme in our Church, the rediest inlet z
Page 154. to 178.
to Popery and a part thereof, though I knew it to be a plot of the Jesuits to
subvert our Religion, as appears by the Jesuits Letter; and that principally;
First, in being a common Patriot of Arminians, together with their Books,
Tenets, and a preferrer of such; by name, of Bishop Mountague, and his Appeal
complained of in Parliament, Doctor Jackson and others; for which I was taxed
by a Declaration of the Commons in Parliament: Secondly, in censuring the
Commons Declaration in Parliament against the Arminians, and their Vote too:
Thirdly, in calling in and suppressing Books against Arminianisme, though
licensed, and questioning, censuring the Authors, Printers, dispersers of them
in the high Commission, as Bishop Carltons and Bishop Downames Books, Doctor
Featlies, Doctor Goads, Master Rouses, Doctor Sutcliffes, Master Prynnes,
Master Burtons Books, and others; when as the Arminian Authors went
unquestioned, and their Books printed by authority, as Doctor Jacksons Book,
and the Historical Narration, licensed by my own Chaplain Doctor Martin:
Fourthly, In abusing his Majesty's Proclamation, his Declaration before the 39.
Articles of our Church, with the subsequent Instructions, prohibiting
controversies against the Article, especially in the controverted points of
Arminianisme, to suppress all preaching against Arminian errors, and punish
such as durst oppose them, by silencing, suspending, censuring them in the high
Commission or elsewhere, and conniving at the Arminians to vent and preach their
errors freely under pretext thereof, without restraint or opposition, both in
the University and City: Fifthly, for purging passages against Arminianisme and
Arminians out of Books tendered to the Press, and particularly out of Bishop
Hals and Bishop Davenants Letters; with some other incident particulars which
fall under these heads: Sixthly, in repealing the Articles of Ireland against
Arminianisme, which King James declaimed against as damnable heresy.

To this I answer in general, that I never endeavored to introduce
Arminianisme Answer.
into our Church, nor ever maintained any Arminian opinions. For the Jesuits
Letter, it is nothing at all to me, it lays nothing to my charge in
particular, and it was lawful for me to read and keep it; it contains many
strange vile things in it against the Parliament, which I approve not, but
detest. To the particulars, I answer; First, that I did neither protect nor
countenance the Arminians persons, books or tenets; for Bishop Mountague, I had
no hand in his Book, I countenanced it not, it was suppressed and called in by
Proclamation; he was preferred by Sir Dudly Carltons means, not mine, who was
then a stranger to me: True is is, I was in a Declaration of the Commons house,
taxed as a favourer, advancer of Arminians and their opinions, without any
particular proof at all, which was a great slander to me: Secondly, I answer,
that being publicly traduced in that Declaration, I did return an answer to
vindicate my own innocence, as was necessary for me to do, to free my self
from that scandal, without any derogation to the Parliaments authority:
Neither did I this till I was expressly commanded by the King himself, as
appears by the endorsment, whose command it was lawful, yea necessary for me
to obey; and I durst not have done it without such his Royal command: After
which I penned it, with all due respect to the Parliament, and it was never
published. For my answer to the Parliaments Vote, it was only a private paper
kept in my Study, and communicated to none, written for my own private
satisfaction, and derogating noting from the power of Parliaments, it belonging
properly to the Convocation and Church of England by the Laws and Statutes of
the Land, to make Canons and settle controversies in Religion, as the Statute
of 25. Hen. 8. c. 19. and 1. Eliz. c. 1. evidence: Thirdly, the calling in and
suppressing of these Books, and prosecuting the Authors, Printers of them in
the High Commission, was the Courts act, not mine: For Bishop Carltons Book, it
was called in by the High Commission, and attested only by Master Spark, a
single Witness; Bishop Downhams Book was called in by the Kings special
command, both in England and Ireland, because published contrary to the his
Royal Proclamation, and Declaration: For Master Prynnes Perpetuity, I do not
know that it was burnt in private; if it were, it was by the censure of the
Court, there being some things in it liable to just exceptions: Doctor
Sutcliffes Book is not proved to be called in by me: For Master Prynne, Master
Burton, and those that printed their Books, they were not censured in the High
Commission, but dismissed thence without censure: For Doctor Jackson, he was a
learned discreet man, I licensed not his Book, nor do I know he professed
himself an Arminian: True it is, the Historical Narration was licensed by my
Chaplain Doctor Martin, without my privity, for which I turned him out of my
service, and the Book it self was called in and suppressed.

Fourthly, the Kings Proclamation and Declaration before the Articles, were his
own, not mine, both published to settle peace in the Church, by silencing
those controversies which disturbed it by printing or preaching, which unquiet
spirits would not submit to, and the Authors of the Books forementioned, among
others, with some other Preachers about the City and University, for which they
were justly questioned, suspended, and some that broached Arminian Tenets in
Oxford, were brought in question, and ordered to recant, as well as those that
preached against it: The censure of Master Ford and his accomplices in Oxford,
was by the King and Counsel upon a solemn hearing at Woodstock, not by me,
and they well deserved it, for kindling such a fire in the University, as was
like to set all in combustion: For the University of Cambridge, I meddled not
with it: The considerations was not my paper, but Bishop Harsnets, who drew
them; and I did but transcribe them, and the end of them was not to supresse
preaching against Arminianisme, but to preserve peace and order in the Church.
For the Instructions, they were the Kings, not mine, and they were sent to me
in a Letter by my Predecessor Archbishop Abbot, and brought to me by his
Secretary Master Baker, with command to see them put in execution within my
Diocese of London; to prove which, I have produced the testimony of Master
Dobson, who affirmed it to be true. Fifthly, for the purging some passages out
of Bishop Hals and Bishop Davenants Letter, and imprisoning Master Butter for
printing them. I answer, that the same was done by my Chaplain, as being
contrary to his Majesty's Proclamation and Declaration, and Bishop Hall
himself at last consented to it, and was well satisfied upon the reason given
him by my Chaplain, that it was for the quiet of the Church; and therefore for
the Printer of his own head to put it in, deserved exemplary punishment.
Sixthly, there is no proof that the Articles of Irreland were reversed by my
procurement, it was done by the Convocation there, where I was not present.

To this was replied in general, That his endeavors to introduce Arminianisme
were so fully cleared by the premised evidence, and his protection both of
Reply.
the Authors, and fomenters of it, that impudency it self would blush to deny
it. That the Jesuits Letter which he had in his custody endorsed with his own
hand did fully discover to him, that the planting and introducing Arminianisme
here in England, was their Plot and chief Engine to subvert our Religion: And
though it makes no particular mention of him, yet it informs their Superior
and others, that the Arminians had locked up the Dukes ears already; a
Periphrasis of himself (the Dukes Earwig, as he was then styled) who had his
ear more then any: His compliance therefore with the Arminians,
notwithstanding they were but the Jesuits instruments to drive on their
designs, as he certainly knew by this Letter, much agravates his crime, and
makes exceedingly against him: True it is, there are some strange passages,
concerning Parliaments in this Letter, but himself has as bad or worse in his
Diary, and Answer to the Remonstrance of the Commons Anno 1628. therefore
certainly he disliked not these in this Letter.

Particularly, this replication was retorted to these his answers; First, that
he was a professed patriot of the Arminians persons, Books, Tenens, and
particularly of Bishop Mountagues; of whose cause he was most anxious and
inquisitive, whom he acquainted with his Majesty's special favor to him while
he lay under the cloud of the Parliaments displeasure, his receiving all
informations or speeches against his Erroneous book; whose proceedings in
Parliament, when there questioned, were daily represented to, and reserved
carefully by him; whose ill book and opinions were in sundry conferences
particularly justified by him, whose preferments proceeded originally from him,
and with whom he held most intimate correspondency till his death, as the
forecited passages in his own Diary, and alleged evidence proves most fully:
For his advancement by Sir Dully Carltons means, it is but a bare surmise,
contrary to the Dockquet Book to excuse himself: The Proclamation for calling
in his book proceeded from the Parliaments prosecution of him, not from this
Bishops care, who ordered it so, that it proved the chief instrument of
promoting Arminianisme, by hindering all writing and preaching against it what
in him lay, he informing the world in the very Proclamation it self, that the
Author was punished only with a good Bishopric for writing this Book, and
highly advanced maugre three several Parliaments complaints and opposition; In
brief, the Commons Remonstrance is a sufficient evidence of his guilt and no
slander at all (as he slanderously terms it) being verified by so many
proofs: Secondly, his answer to the Remonstrance of the Commons is full of
bitterness, sauciness, scandals against the Parliament, charging them with
untruths in the highest degree, only for speaking that; which was most true:
That he was commanded to return this answer to it by the King himself,
without any suit of his own, is very improbable, and rests on him to prove,
which he has not done: However, he proves not that he did exceed his
Commission. And whereas he alleges by way of excuse, that his answer to it
was never published, truly this was his grief, as appears by his own
endorsment of it, and no act of his, who desired to have it printed then.
Whereas he pretends he durst not have answered it, had not the King commanded
him; certainly he that durst control the Kings own Letters Patents, under his
Seal, (as he did in the case of the collection for the Palatinate, and sundry
other particulars given in evidence against him,) revoke the Kings own pardons
and prohibitions to the high Commission, saying, they should not serve the
turn; yea, deprive the King of his Sovereignty, that he should not relieve nor
pardon any man censured in the high Commission, though never so unjustly; that
has presumed so frequently to break off Parliaments, yea, to resolve to
dissolve them before they were called, In case they prove peevish, etc. and to
write so of Parliaments as he has done in other papers, durst write such an
answer as this without any royal mandate to encourage him: And this his answer
to the Commons Vote against Arminianisme demonstrates, which is fraught with
transcendent contempt of their authority and proceedings therein basely
scorned, scoffed at: And the reasons given therein, prove that it was no private
note to satisfy himself alone, but a paper purposely complied to incense the
King and others against the Commons, as the comparing it with some passages of
his Diary, and dissolving of that very Parliament in discontent soon after,
will easily demonstrate: For the Statutes objected, they prove no such thing as
in pretended, our Parliaments in all Ages (not the Convocation, who are but
only assistants to the Houses in matters of Religion, when their advice is
required) having been the sole Judges, Lawgivers, determiners of all
Ecclesiastical affairs, matters of Religion, as we can prove by See Truth
Triumphing over Falsehood where this is largely proved.
infinite Presidents: Thirdly, the calling in, suppressing, burning of all the
forecited books against Arminianisme, with the questioning of the Authors and
Printers of them in the high Commission, is directly sworn, proved to be his
act, and the Courts only mediatly, by his procurement; the Warrants for their
Citation, Commitments, were signed with his hand, he was the only violent man
against them in open Court, upon all occasions; and though many of them were
not censured, but got off, yet it was only by prohibitions, full sore against
his will, for the bringing whereof he threatened to lay them by the heels:
However, those that escaped best were there prosecuted sundry years, put to
great attendance and expense, many of them imprisoned, and their books all lost
or privately burnt by his direction, without any censure of the Court at all;
as Bishop Carltons Book against Mountague, and Master Prynnes Perpetuity,
though both publicly licensed by Archbishop Abbots Chaplains; Bishop Downhams
Book (as this Archbishops own Letter to Bishop Usher manifests) was called in
by his instigation only; to color which he procured a mandate from the King;
and his own endorsment proves, that Doctor Sutcliffes Book was suppressed in
the Press by his procurement: For Doctor Jackson, he could not but know him to
be a professed Arminian, being so reported by all, and declaring himself to be
one both in his Epistle and Book, which, though complained of, was never
suppressed nor questioned, notwithstanding his Majesty's Proclamation and
Declaration: For the Historical Narration (the vilest imposter ever thrust
upon our Church) it was licensed by his Chaplain Doctor Martin, with his own
privity; the calling of it in was the act of Archbishop Abbot, upon Master
Prynnes complaint, and the public scandal it gave, much against this Bishops
will, who has ever since connived at the sale of them. The turning away this
his Chaplain for it, is but a false surmise, for he promoted him to the
Headship of Queens College in Cambridge, and a very great living to boot,
instead of bringing him into the high Commission; and was he not then severely
punished for so grand a crime? Fourthly, though the Proclamation and
Declaration prohibiting preaching and writing on these controversies, were the
Kings in name and title, yet they were originally this Bishops mere plot and
contrivance, to suppress all Books, Disputes, Sermons against Arminianisme, to
usher it in the faster without any opposition; the Arminians under pretext
hereof, having liberty to preach, to print their errors, without check or
censure, as our evidence abundantly proves, he making them mere snares to
entangle all conscientious, zealous, orthodox men, Ministers and others, whose
zeal excited them to appear against these dangerous disturbers of our
Churches and Kingdoms peace, in Press, Schools or Pulpit: For Master Fords
and his accomplices severe censures in Oxford, even to expulsion and banishment,
they proceeded merely from his own violent prosecution, as the Evidence
unanswerably proves; the Kings and Counsels censures being principally steered
by his compass, the chief actor, prosecutor, and Judge in this cause: And
whereas he pretends, that those who preached or printed Arminianisme were
convented, censured in the Vnversities and elsewhere, as well as those who
preached against it; let him name but one Scholar, Minister, that was ever
imprisoned, deprived, silenced, prosecuted in the high Commission, or cast out
of favor for preaching, writing, printing Arminianisme, and then perchance he
may be credited; but surely not one such president can be found: Whereas Master
Mountague was made a Bishop, Doctor Harsnet an Archbishop, Doctor Linsey
promoted to two Bishoprics, Doctor Potter, made a Deane, (to omit sundry
others) and Doctor Duppa made the Princes Tutor, Deane of Christ-Church, and a
Bishop too, because he was an Arminian. True it is, that we find in the
University Register of Oxford, page 50. that one Master Robert Rainsford (since
a Doctor) teaching diverse Arminian Tenants in a Sermon at Saint Mary's, in
defense of Election from foreseen Faith, and Universal Grace; was upon Doctor
Prideaux his complaint, not long after the expulsion of Master Ford and Master
Hodges, convented before the Heads, and enjoined a very slender Recantation, in
as partial terms as might be; not of his Arminian errors (which he has often
since broched) but of his disobedience to his Majesty's Declaration, recorded
in these terms:

Whereas I Robert Rainsford preaching at Saint Mary's in Oxford the 12. day of
August 1632. and falling upon some prynts, which by reason of the agitation of
them, have caused trouble in the Church, have been forbidden to be preached on,
both by his Majesty's Declaration, and by his express Order to the
Vice Chancellor at Woodstock, (whereof having left the University for the
space of two years and upwards, I was altogether ignorant) have thereby
incurred his Majesty's displeasure, and was therefore worthily convented by the
Vice Chancellor; I do freely and humbly acknowledge my disobedience, and am
heartily sorry for the same, desiring those that are to be my Judges, upon my
promise of better behavior hereafter, to accept this my unfeigned
acknowledgement, and to be favorable unto me.

21. August 1632. Robert Rainsford.

This was all his censure, far different from Master Fords and Master Hodges,
though after their punishment, and so his offense far greater then theirs,
who did not begin the quarrel, nor kindle the fire of the Arminian
Controversies in Oxford, but their Opposites, who escaped scot-free, and were
promoted by this Archbishop himself for opposing, when they were thus severely
handled for maintaining the truth. So in London the Anti-Arminians were
generally silenced, suppressed, the Arminians connived at, advanced, encouraged
by this Prelate, under pretext of this Declaration, as the Commons in
Parliament complained in their forecited Remonstrance, and as we have proved by
sundry instances, to which he returns no answer, and so stand confessed by his
silence. For Cambridge University, we know he was Visitor there, though not
Chancellor, and had as great an influence upon it, if not power and activity
in it, as in Oxford, giving all encouragement to the Arminian party there,
advancing them to Headships and other preferments. For the Considerations they
are written with his own hand, savor of his style, spirit: That Bishop
Harsnet was the compiler of them, is but his own averment, without proof or
probability; and admit they were his in the penning, yet certainly they were
his own in the contriving, executing; and so were the Instructions, though
drawn up in his Majesty's name, and sent to Archbishop Abbot, who must be
ordered to send them enclosed in a Letter unto him, only to color the Plot,
as if it were not his; whereas the Original under his own hand discovers the
contrary.

Fifthly, the purging of those objected innocent, orthodox passages, even out of
two Bishops Letters by his Chaplain, was certainly by his own command, else
his Chaplain durst not be so bold with his Superiors of such note and
eminency, who if they consented to this purgation at all, it was only as
Mariners consent to throw over some of their goods into the Sea in a storm,
least the whole Ship and freight should be lost; either this must be expunged,
or the whole Book suppressed; and all under pretext of his Majesty's
Declaration and the Churches peace; neither of which could restaine Arminian
Books from the Press: And whether the Stationer, Butter, deserved to be
imprisoned without Bail or Mainprize in the Fleet, to be Articled against in
the high Commission, to sustain the loss of all his Books, and suffer other
penalties for printing these passages, the best part of his Book; (without
which, the Letters themselves were mere Ciphers, fragments,) let the
indifferent judge, till the Archbishop can produce an Arminian Stationer,
punished in this sort for printing Arminian Treatises, contrary to the Kings
Proclamation and Declaration.

Sixthly, our Evidence sufficiently proves, that the revocation of the Articles
of Ireland proceeded orinally from him, who was virtually, though not
corporally present there in Doctor Bramhall, Master Chapple, and his other
Arminian instruments, and the Lord Deputy Wentworth, who had neither power nor
malice sufficient to effect such an Arch-exploit without his omnipotent
concurrence and abuse of his Majesty's authority: For that of King James, that
he never censured Arminius for an Heretic, nor his opinions for Heresy, but
only Vorstius, the contrary is most apparent by his very words, in his
Declaration against Vorstius, page 15. to 33. where he styles Arminius, that
Enemy of God; Arminianisme HERESY; Arminians, Heretics and Atheistical
Sectaries: Bertius his Book of the Apostasy of the Saints, a blasphemous Book,
and this his Doctrine a wicked Doctrine, an abominable Heresy: So that all
particulars of this his heavy Charge stick still fast upon him.

Tenthly, I am charged Page 178, etc
with various attempts and endeavors, to undermine Object. 10.
the true Protestant Religion, established in our Churches, and set up Popery
in its stead, by maintaining, Printing, publishing all kind of doctrinall
points of Popery, and hindering all public opposition against them; which
general was branched forth into sundry particulars; which I shall answer in
their Order.

The first is, The authorizing, printing, dispersing of sundry popish
Doctrines, Books, and the prohibiting the contary impressions to refute them,
Page 178, etc
by virtue of a Decree made in Star Chamber by my Procurement, the 1. of July
1637. by color whereof, it is objected, diverse old printed Books were
prohibited to be reprinted, imported; as the English Geneva Bible with
marginall Notes, the printing whereof I endeavored to suppress abroad in the
Netherlands, as well as at home: The questioning of Master Gellibrand in the
high Commission for his man's publishing an Almanac according to Master Fox his
Calander in the Book of Martyrs, wherein our English Martyrs names were
inserted in stead of popish Saints, whom Doctor Pocklington abused in print; my
checking, threatening of Mistress Griffin for reprinting Thomas Beacons Display
of the Poposh Mass; my calling in of the Palsgraves Religion; the denial of
reprinting Master Fox his Acts and Monuments, Bishop Jewels Works, and some
part of Doctor Willets; for refusing to license new Books against Popish
errors, and calling in of Mr. Prynnes, Master Burtons, and others Books
against popery, yea questioning them with sundry Printers and Stationers, in
the high Commission, for printing, publishing Books against the Papists and
Arminians; my licensing, countenancing diverse popish books, lately printed,
dispersed, to infect and poison his Majesty's people with popish errors, as
Francis Sales his Book, Christ's Epistle to a devout Soul, Bishop Mountagues,
Doctor Pocklingtons, Doctor Heylins, Doctor Lawrences, Reeves, Shelfords,
Chownaeus, Staffords Books and Sermons; The lives of the Emperors, the popish
Index Biblicus, my own Speech in Star Chamber, and others, wherein diverse
gross points of popery and superstition, mustered up under diverse heads, are
comprised; many of which were complained of by Master Prynne in his Cross Bill
in Star Chamber, suppressed by my means, and by Master Burton in his For God
and the King; for which they were unjustly censured in the Star Chamber; to
which Master Croxtons Letter to me, with a cross in the front, approving most
gross Auricular confession in the open Church, is subjoyned.

To which I answer; First, That the Decree in Star Chamber was the act of the
whole Court, who likewise ordered it to be printed, not mine: That it was

made only to regulate the abuses of printing: That the Stationers themselves
desired, approved, and gave me thanks for it. Secondly, That the English Bible
with Geneva Notes, was only tolerated and connived at, not allowed heretofore;
that some passages in it were abused, and very ill use made of them; as among
others, that in the first of Exodus, which teaches men not to obey the
commands of Kings. King James himself in the Conference at Hampton Court, page
47. publicly declared his dislike of this translation, as the worst of all,
and thereupon took care for a new translation to be made, but withal gave this
Caveat, that no marginal Notes should be added to it, having found in them
annexed to the Geneva translation some Notes very partial, untrue, seditious,
and savouring too much of dangerous and traitorous conceits: As for example;
the first chapter of Exodus, and the 19. verse, where the marginall Note
allows disobedience unto Kings: The endeavor to suppress it in the
Netherlands, was not any extent of my power thither, but the act of Sir Will.
Boswell the Kings Agent there, who did but his duty therein. Thirdly, for
Master Gellibrands Book, it was printed not in form of a Calender but
Almanac; it was published to discountenance the old Saints, and was a mere
innovation, contrary to all former Almanacks in use among us, and to that in
the Common Prayer book: That the Queen sent to me about it, I could not help
that: That I told Master Gellibrand he labored to raise a faction in the
Court, I remember not the words; and if he did so, he deserved to be censured
for it: That the Papists burnt it, I could not help that: Neither did it agree
with Master Fox his Calender, but he abused it, in leaving out diverse Saints
allowed by the Church of England, as the Epiphany and Annunciation of our Lady:
For Doctor Pocklingtons Book, wherein he abused our Martyrs, it was licensed by
his Chaplain, Doctor Bray, who was censured for it, as was Doctor Pocklington
too, in the Lords House.

But it is objected, that my Chaplains act is in law mine own: I answer not,
Objection. Answer.
unless I command it: But the Book it self was found in my Study, and I
preferred Doctor Pocklington for it. I know no such thing, and though I had the
Book, yet I knew not of this passage in it. Fourthly, for the calling in of
Beacons Book, printed by Mistress Griffin, it is nothing to me what a Jesuit
said of it; and if called in, it was because she reprinted it contrary to the
Star Chamber Decree. Fifthly, for the Palsgraves Religion, I remember it not,
and if called in, it was because it was contrary to the Kings Declaration, and
touched upon some points of controversy prohibited by it. Sixthly, the hindering
of the reprinting of Master Fox, Bishop Jewel, and Doctor Willet, was no act
of mine. Seventhly, I hindered the printing of no new Books against Popery.
Eighthly, the questioning of Master Prynne, Master Burton, and the rest in the
High Commission, was no act of mine, but the Courts; nor were they censured,
but got off without censure: Master Burton said, he was questioned before the
Counsel Table for one of his Books, as a Libell: If it were a Libell, there
was cause to do it. He added, he could not be quiet for being troubled in the
high Commission; nor could the Church be quiet for him, which was the cause of
his trouble. He affirmed, I committed him to the Fleet, and denied him the
benefit of the Petition of Right. I answer, there was cause enough for his
commitment, for printing of Books without license, and for disturbing the peace
of the Church, and he had the benefit of the Petition of Right, because the
reason of his commitment was expressed in the Warrant. Ninthly, I licensed none
of the particular books forecited my self, nor any of my Chaplains to my
knowledge, I am certain not by my command, and if any of them have
transgressed herein, themselves must answer for it, not I; who having many
other weighty public affairs to look after, had no time to peruse or license
Books my self, and was enforced to commit this trust to their care. Tenthly,
to the particular books I answer, First, that though Sales his book was
licensed by my Chaplain, yet he was abused therein, by the Translator and
Printer, who was punished for it in Star Chamber: The book it self was called
in and burnt by Proclamation, and I dismissed the Doctor for licensing it out
of my house and service: For Christ's Epistle to a devout Soul, it was licensed
at London House, by Doctor Weeks, the Bishop of Londons Chaplain, not mine, and
so nothing to me; besides, it was suppressed before it was published: For
Doctor Heylins Books, they are nothing to me, I had no hand in them, nor yet in
Doctor Pocklingtons, who has been censured for them himself: For Bishop
Mountagues Impressions, they concern not me, I did neitheir advise nor
authorize them: For the Lives of the Emperors, which commend the Council of
Trent, the Book was not licensed, and I know not of it. For the Popish Index
Biblicus printed in England, it is nothing to me, it was without my privity and
direction: For the several popish passages objected out of some newbooks, the
Authors themselves must answer them at their peril, they concern not me: For
the rejecting of Master Prynnes Cross Bill in Star Chamber, complaining of
these popish Books and Doctrines, it was none of my act, but the Courts and
Lord Keeper Coventries; and so was Mr. Burtons censure for his Book, in which I
gave no Vote: For Master Croxtons Letter to me with a Cross, enjoining
Auricular confession, I could not hinder it, nor his practice of confession
being in Ireland: And for the passages objected out of mine own Speech in
Star Chamber, that they imply and necessarily infer the popish Doctrine of
Transubstantiation, and the giving of divine worship to the Altar, even the
same that is given to God. I answer, that neither of these can be inferred from
thence; for my words only imply, that Christ's body is truly and really present
in the Sacrament; yet not corporally, but in a spiritual manner, and so is
received by us; which is no more then Master Calvin himself affirms on the 1
Cor. 11. 24. where thus he writes: Neque enim mortis tantum and Resurrectionis
suae beneficium nobis offert Christus, sed corpus suum in quo passus est and
Resurrexit: Concludo, REALITER (ut vulgo loquuntur) id est, VERE Nobis in Coena
datur Christi corpus, ut sic A^imis Nostris in Cibum salutarem; and Master
Perkins himself faith as much. For my words, that we should bow DEO ET ALTARI,
which are coupled both together with a Conjunction Copulative, yea both bowed
to at the self-same time, in one and the same act, and the worship directed to,
and terminated in both alike: Ergo, divine worship is given to the Altar herein
as well as to God, which is flat Idolatry, or but such civil reverence given
to God as is rendered to the Altar; which is to dishonor God, and gives him no
greater worship in his house then is due unto a creature: I answer, that though
the act of bowing be the same to both, yet the object, mind and intention being
different, the worship must be so too; There is a double worship and bowing,
one of the body, the other of the heart, as Master Perkins himself
distinguishes; which is properly called Veneration, when done but to a
creature in a civil respect, and worship only when given to God himself.

To this was replied, Ferst, that this Decree of Star Chamber concerning
printing was only his own act originally, who projected and put that Court
upon it, Reply.
(whereof he was an over-potent Member) theirs only Ministerially, to satisfy
his importunity therein, as the forecited Passages in the Decreee it self, and
our Witnesses attest: Yea, the printing of it was by his own command, to
enlarge his Jurisdiction, which it much advanced: We grant that some things in
the Decree were good, approved of by the Stationers, who desired the same, of
which we complain not, and some particulars very useful, had a right use been
made of them. But the prohibiting reprinting of all Orthodox Books formerly
printed by authority, unless re-licensed by him or his Agents; the denial of
any old book to be reprinted even against Popery it self, with the suppressing
or purging most new Books against Popery, under pretext of this Decree, and the
arbitrary punishing such who transgressed herein both in the Star Chamber and
High Commission, was a transcendent crime, of which this Arch-prelat and his
Confederates (not the whole Court of Star Chamber) were only culpable: Yea,
the Stationers were so far from being well pleased with, or returning him
thanks for this, that they complained to the chief Justice, and groaned under
the pressure thereof. Secondly, the English Bible with the Geneva Notes, was
not only tolerated but printed and reprinted among us in England, Cum
Privilegio, during Queen Elizabeth's and King James Reigns; and in 15. Jacobi
there was an Impression of them printed here by the Kings own Printer; since
which time, the new Translation without Notes being most vendible (the Kings
Printers forbearing to print them for their private lucre, not by virtue of any
public restraint) they were usually imported from beyond the Seas, and
publicly sold without any inhibition or punishment, till this Archbishops
time, who made it no less then an High Commission crime, to vend, bind or
import them. For the Notes, they are generally approved by all our Protestant
Divines, which fled hence for Religion in Queen Mary's days, who dedicated the
same to Queen Elizabeth. For the Note on Exodus 1. it is both sound and
Orthodox, condemning only obedience to the arbitrary, tyranicall, unjunst (not
lawful) commands of Kings, contrary to the Laws of God, nature, men, being
warranted by the example of the Midwives, who disobeyed King Pharaohs bloody
Mandate, in not murdering all the male Children of the Israelites, by sundry
other Ester 3, 2, 3, Dan. 2. 5. to 17 cap. 3. 3. to 30 cap. 6. 5. to 21. 1 Samuel
22. 17, 18. 2 Samuel 1. 2, 10. Acts 4. 18, 19. cap. 5. 28. to 41.
Scripture Texts; yea, warranted by the Fathers and See Gratian Causa 11. qu.
3. Bernard. de Modo been vivendi, cap. 19. Tertul. Apolog.
Canonists themselves, who speak as much or more then this Annotation does.
For King James his censure of this Translation and Notes upon it, no doubt it
proceeded from some Prelates misinformation: However, we are certain that his
own inserting of popish Pictures of the Birth, Life, Passion, Resurrection and
Ascension of Christ, the Holy Ghost, the Apostles, yea the very Assumption of
the Virgin Mary, and the like, into our English, and of a Popish Index into our
Latin Bibles, was far worse, more dangerous then any Geneva Notes; and the
prohibition of inserting Marginall Notes into the Bible, a policy learned from
our English Prelates in King HRNRY the eighth his Reign, who when they could
not hinder the printing of the Bible it self in English, of Master Tyndals
Translation; yet procured an Act of Parliament for the Obliterating of his
Notes thereon; as the Statute of 35. Hen. VIII. cap. 1. and Master Acts and
Monuments, vol. 2. p. 586. 587.
Fox informs us: And his endeavor to hinder the importation of Bibles with
Notes from Holland, of which he had information by two Letters sent from
thence, discovers his vigilance, yea, spite against this Translation and the
Notes upon it.

Thirdly, for Master Gellibrands Almanacke, set forth by his servant, it was
agreeable to Master Foz his Calender; only inserting our English Martyrs in
the place of popish Saints; no High Commission crime by any known Law; That it
differed from other Almanacks herein, is no greater offense, then for one
Almanack-maker to vary from another in calculating the Weather, or other
Astronomicall Observations, who better deserve an High Commission censure for
retaining the names of sundry Popish Saints, (yea arrant Traitors, as Becket,
Anselme, with sundry others) omitted in the Calender of the Common Prayer Book,
and agreeing Verbatim with the Calender in the Roman Missall, then he, for
omitting the names of Romish Saints, whom God never Canonized, but the Pope
alone, for their zeal or sufferings for the Papal Cause and Romish
Superstitions. The Queens sending to him about this Almanac, shows, that the
Papists took it to be a great blow to their Religion; and though he could not
hinder the message, yet certainly he might have surceased all prosecution of Mr
Gellibrand upon the Queens and Papists complaints for this act of his, where as
he pursued him with all violence to gratify them. For the words he remembers
not, our Witness swears them precisely, and his threatening Master Gellibrand
upon a mere groundless supposition, that he had raised a faction in the
Court, because they acquitted him full sore against his will; argues both his
violence and injustice: That the Papists burnt it, when he could not attain
the burning of it in the High Commission, argues their malice, and his own
readiness to comply with them against so good a work, in honor of our own
English Protestant Martyrs. For his omission of some Saints, viz. the Epiphany
and Anunciation, no man knew them to be Saints till now, but only Festivals,
which other Almanacks mentioned, and it is only alleged not proved that he
omitted them. For Doctor Pocklingtons Altar Christianum, it was licensed by
his own Chaplain Doctor Bray, yea published by his own command, without the
Authors privity, if we believe his Petition to the Lords; and their two
punishments, censures in the Lords House for this Book, adjudged to the fire
and burnt, is no extenuation, but aggravation of his guilt, the most culpable
of all three: Himself confesses, that his Chaplains act is his own in Law,
if he command it, and this Doctor himself affirms, that he did command its
printing; therefore the act is his more then the Authors or his Chaplains, who
did but obey his superior command. That Doctor Pocklington did present him
with both the printed Impressions of this Book, curiously gilt, he cannot deny,
they being found in his Study endorsed with his own hand: That he knew not of
this passage in it against our Martyrs, and in honor of Popish Saints, is not
probable, yea, impossible, since generally complained of in print, and
particularly by Master Prynne at the Pillory, who desired all to take notice of
it; of which the Archbishop had present information, yet neither recalled the
book nor obliterated the passage.

Fourthly, the calling in of Mr Beacons book against the Mass, upon the
complaint of a Priest or Jesuit, with his words and threats to Mistress Griffin,
for reprinting it at such a time as this, reflect as foully upon him as possible
yet he puts it off with this impudent common shift, It is nothing to me: For
the reprinting and his calling of it in, it is directly sworn to be before the
Star Chamber Decree, therefore not done in pursuance of it; and were it done
after, yet not justifiable without highest impudency by any true Protestant
Prelate.

Fifthly, for the Palsgraves Religion, it is proved to be called in by him, who
has the happiness to forget all the evil deeds which he cannot justify,
though others swear them: And it was not contrary to the Kings Declaration
(which himself originally contrived) in the Kings intention, but in his own
perverting of it, to suppress the truth. Sixthly, the hindering of the
reprinting of Master Fox, Bishop Jewel and Doctor Willets Works, was certainly
his own act, because done by color of this Star Chamber Decree, procured by
himself for this very purpose, and the reprinting of them was stopped by his
own Officers, creatures means, who knew his mind, if not received his command
herein: Seventhly, himself, if not immediately, yet originally and mediatly
hindered the printing of all the new Books against Popery, refused at the
Press, and denied license by his Instruments, Chaplains, Doctor Bray, Doctor
Haywood, Doctor Weeks, Doctor Baker, unless first purged by them.

Ninthly, the questioning of Master Prynne, Master Burton, with their Printers
and Stationers in the High Commission, for their Books against Doctor Cosins
his popery, Babel no Bethel, Baiting of the Popes Bull, and the like, was
originally his act alone, not the Courts, which did naught in it but by his
instigation: Their getting off thence was by Prohibitions, sore against his
will, where else he resolved to ruin them. Master Burtons answering the Popes
Bull by license, deserved no questioning at the Counsel Table, and was
certainly no Libell at all, unless the Pope or his Partisans deemed it such to
them: His Books then were no trouble to the Church, and therefore it was
strange and most unjust he should be troubled for them; yea, his imprisonment
without Bail (which he tendered) when bailable by Law, was contrary to Magna
Charta and the Petition of Right, though the cause of it (not warranted by Law)
was expressed in the Warrant. Tenthly, his own Chaplains oversights and
offenses in licensing popish Books, even with this special Encomium, that
there was nothing in them contrary to faith and sound Doctrine (the form of
licensing himself prescribed them under his own hand) is certainly both in
law and justice, his own crime more then theirs, who must answer for it much
more then they; the trust of licensing books being originally reposed in
himself by the State, and in his Chaplains only by his own Deputation, for
See 27. Ed. 3 Stat. 2. c. 19.
whom he must answer at his peril: To prove this, and take away this poor
evasion, which he so much insists on, we shall put but these few cases See 27.
Ed. 3 Stat. 2. c. 19.
adjudged in Law; 5. E. 3. c. 8. 19. H. 7 c 10. Brooks and Fitz. herberts

If a Bailiffe, under Jailer, or under Sheriff suffer a prisoner to escape, or
any way to misdemeane themselves in their office, an action of escape, debt (an
fine in cases of felony and treason,) and action of the case lies against the
high Sheriff and chief Jailer for it, who must undergo the penalty and
blame, because they are their servants, entrusted by themselves: And to put a
case, which comes nearer home, and is far stronger then this of a Chaplain,

17. John Archbishop of York was questioned in Parliament, for excommunicating
William of Willicon, and John Rowman, servants to the Bishop of Durham, then
employed in the Kings service; the Archbishop pleaded just as this Archbishop
does now, That they were not excommunicated by himself, but only by his
Commissary, who must answer for it, and so no act of his for which he ought to
answer: But yet notwithstanding, it was upon serious debate resolved in
Parliament, that the Act of his Commissary being his own immediate Officer,
was his own act, for whose misdemeanour he must answer, and thereupon he was
fined 4000. marks to the King, and forced to pay it, (a great fine in those
times for such an offense) yea gladed to make many friends to the King to avoid
a further censure: which is far stronger then the case of this Archprelate:
For this 5: E. 3.
Commissary was an Officer established by Law, which the Archbishop could not
remove at pleasure without just cause; but his Chaplains were no Officers by
Law, but mere meniall servants, under his immediate command, and removable at
pleasure; therefore certainly, they durst license nothing especially against
our established Religion, without his privity and command: Besides, there were
never any such popish Books authorized since the beginning of Reformation in
any of his Predecessors times, by themselves or their Chaplains, neither durst
such erroneous pamphlets appear publicly amongst us, till he grew great to
patronize them; yea, when they were thus licensed, and publicly complained
against, as Popish, erroneous, and destructive to our Religion, he censured,
persecuted such who durst complain or write against them, never questioning
nor punishing the Licensers, Printers or Authors of them exemplarily as he
should have done, to discharge the trust reposed in him, and vindicate his
sincerity herein; whereas if any new Book against Arminians or Popish
Innovations did but privily pass the Press by license of his Predecessors
Chaplains (as Bishop Carltons Book against Mountague, Master Prynnes
Perpetuity, his Survey of Master Cozens his Cozening Devotions, Histriomastix,
with other forenamed Impressions did) he presently suppressed, burnt them,
questioned the Authous, Printers, Dispersers, Licensers of them, both in the
High Commission and Star Chamber too, where Master Prynne by his means, was
censured in the highest degree of extremity for his Histriomastix, a licensed
Book, and Master Buckner too, who licensed it, fined by this Archbishop
himself and that Court; therefore this act of his Chaplains must rest upon
his own head, and the guilt thereof lie heaviest upon him, whose fault it was
to make choice of such, and to entrust them in this kind. As for his excuse of
his many other grand employments, which so engrossed his time, that he had no
leisure to peruse what Books were tendered and licensed for the Press, it is so
far from being any excuse, that it aggavates his crime: Certainly the
preservation of our Religion in its purity, the keeping out all Popish
innovations in Ceremony, Doctrine, Worship, and the suppression of Popish
errors, Books, Doctrines, were the principal things of all others, which his
Place, Calling, yea, his Majesty's trust engaged him to look unto; for him then
to neglect this principal part of his Episcopal duty, the frequent preaching
of Gods Word (he seldom appearing in the Pulpit after he became Archbishop and
a Privy Counselor) to drown himself in all manner of secular employments in
the Star Chamber, Counsel-Chamber, Exchequer, spending his time in proling
about Tobacco; Licenses, illegal Taxes, Projects, Monopolies of all sorts,
contrary to the Laws and Liberties of the Subjects, in undermining
Parliaments, oppressing the people every where, and managing the Kings
Revenues, (things no way suitable to his spiritual Function;) is so far from
extenuating, that it puts the highest degree of aggravation upon this his
negligence and Chaplains misdemeanors, which he should have better looked
too: But admit the real duties of his Place alone had been overburthensome to
him, he should then have entrusted, employed such in Licensing and perusing
Books, who would have discharged the trust reposed in them, in far better
manner then his known Popish and Arminian Chaplains did. Tenthly, to his
excuses touching the particular Popish Books objected: We answer, first, that
Sales his Book was Licensed by Doctor Haywood, his own Chaplain: that he was
not abused in it, but the Printer, whom he checked for complaining to him of
the Popish passages in the Book, and encouraged to proceed in the printing of
it, which otherwise he durst not have printed. That it was afterward called in
and publicly burnt, was no thanks to him or his Chaplain, but to Master
Prynnes cross Bill against him and his Chaplain in Star Chamber for licensing
it; As for the Proclamation for calling it in, it was but a mere device to
abuse the King, Kingdom, to justify or excuse his peccant Chaplain and
himself, by a most false relation of the carriage of the business. Besides,
if his Chaplain was innocent, Why then does he pretend, he punished him by
turning him out of his service? If guilty, Why does he justify him to the King
and Kingdom by this Proclamation? But indeed this pretended punishment was but
a mere pretense; for he punished him only with a good Living, to wit, Saint
Giles in the Fields, sending him from Lambeth thither to infect that Parish
with his Popish Leprosy, or to please the Papists, Priests, Jesuits, of which
there were more residing in that Parish alone, then in all the Parishes about
London. For Christ's Epistle to a Devout Soul, that it was licensed by Doctor
Weeks at London-house the self-same day that Sales was at Lambeth; is true,
but yet it is as true that Doctor Weeks was this Archbishops own Chaplain,
and the Bishop of London his mere creature Servant, yea it appears there was a
strong confederacy between the Chaplains of Lambeth and London-house in
licensing both these Popish Books for the same Stationer the self-same day, to
propagate and license Popery with a witness, even just at that very season,
(which makes it more remarkable) when Master Prynne, Master Burton, and Doctor
Bastwicke were prosecuted by their good Lord and Master Canterbury in the
Star Chamber, for opposing their Popish Innovations, Impositions, Doctrins, and
just when the gaudy Crucifix was erected by him at White Hall in the Kings own
Chapel in Passion week, they then thinking all cock-sure on their side: That
this Epistle was suppressed, we may thank, not the Archbishop, but Master
Prynn's Crosse-bill, who but a few weeks after was ill requited with a bloody
barbarous censure for his pains, and sent away hence close prisoner, first,
into North Wales, then into Jersey, where none must have access unto him, to
prevent any more such oppositions, discoveries of popish Books and Bills
against them. For Doctor Heylins Books complained of, they were some of them
purposely written by the Archbishops own command, as he has confessed (to
wit, that against Mr. Burton and Antidotum Lincolnienses) and licensed by his
own Chaplains; therefore they concern him much: For Doctor Pocklingtons
Popish Impressions, they were perused by himself, yea, published by his
direction without the Doctors privity, as his Petition manifests; therefore his
censure for writing them, will be no excuse for his own publishing, or his
Chaplains authorizing them without the Doctors knowledge or desire: For Bishop
Mountagues Books, they were all bound up (most of them with his Arms very
rightly gilt) and presented to him by Mountague himself; after that,
entertained by him in his Study, justified by him in private conferences, yea,
the later of them expressly submitted to his judgment, dispose, and licensed by
his Chaplains; and yet are they nothing to him? For the Epitome of the Lives
of the Emperors, it was licensed by his own Chaplain Doctor Weeks, at
London-house, as the license and entry of it in the Stationers Hall (which we
have here ready to produce) attests: That he took no notice of it, nor of what
was in it, was his own voluntary negligence, who could take notice of any the
least pretended Puritannicall, Anti-episcopall, or Anti-Arminian passages in
all new printed Books whatsoever; yea, of any harsh passages against the Pope,
Papists, Jesuits, and cause them to be suppressed, expunged, and the Authors of
them sometimes to be deeply censured: For the Popish Index Biblicus, being
printed here in London, then publicly bound up with our Latin Bibles of Junius
and Tremelius translation (with which they as well accorded as Fire does with
Water, or Popery with Protestanisme) it concerned him most of any thing to take
notice of, and have most severely punished: But this vigilant Argus against
Protestanisme, or any thing that trenched upon Episcopacy, Popish Ceremonies,
Arminianisme, or the High Commission, was here as blind as a Beetle, and could
espy no Books at all (though never so gross) that made for Popery and popish
Innovations, or else fell fast asleep, when he should watch against these
popish enemies, who sowed their Tarts so fast among us.

For the objected popish passages out of these now Authorized Printed Authors,
himself must answer for them:

First, because many of them were particularly complained against by Master
Burton in his Sermon for God and the King; by Master Prynne in his Cross Bill,
which he read, and by sundry printed Books, which he could not but take notice
of; yet he neither suppressed the Books, nor questioned the Authors, Printers
or dispersers of them. Secondly, because never any such large crop or harvest
of Popish Books and Tares appeared or sprung up in our English Church before
his time, since the beginning of Reformation; it being the chief part of his
place and Office as Archbishop of Canterbury to suppress and extirpate,
whereas he authorized and propagated them all he could. For the rejecting of
Master Prynnes Cross Bill in Star Chamber against him, his Chaplains and
Confederates for Writing, Licensing, Publishing these Popish Books and
Passages, it was principally his own Act, who stopped it at the Lord Keepers;
was present when it was rejected in open Court (where he sat as one of the most
swaying Judges) and endeavored to have brought him in danger of his life,
only for preferring it in a Legal manner; whereas had he, his Chaplains,
Confederates been Innocent, they would have Petitioned the Court it might have
been received, that so they might legally have cleared themselves (if they
could) of that, which now (blessed be God) we have fully proved before an
Higher Tribunal, for which this cause by Gods providence was reserved, as the
fittest Court both to hear and censure it. For Master Croxtons Letter; he was
his own creature, specially recommended by him to the Lord Deputy Wentworth,
who preferred him for his sake: and he that durst prefer such a Popish Priest
in that Popish Kingdom, who dared thus openly to put the Mass Priests, yea
Jesuits badge of a Cross in the Front of his Letter to him, and acquaint him
with this open practice of Auricular Confession; must doubtless be no
wel-wisher to our Religion, and assured of the Archbishops readiness to concur
with him in the approbation of his courses, else he durst not write thus to him.

As for that passage in his Speech in Star Chamber; we have Page 203. 204
already proved, that it necessarily implies a Transubstantiation, or corporal
presence of Christ on the very Altar. For, there (says he, not in and to the
believers heart, receiving him spiritually by faith) it is, Hoc est corpus meum,
etc. and A greater reverence no doubt is due TO THE BODY, then to the word of
the Lord. Its true, our 28. Article resolves, That in the Lords Supper, to such
as rightly, worthily and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break
is a partaking of the Body of Christ's which is given, taken and eaten in the
Supper, ONLY after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the
Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith. And in this sense
Master Calvin writes, that the very Body of Christ wherein he suffered and rose
again, is offered to us, and REALLY and TRVLY given unto us in the Supper, in
a spiritual manner only. But did ever our Articles, Mr Calvin, or any
Prorestant writers hold, That Christ's body was really or truly present upon the
Altar (where it is, says he, usually present, and the greatest place of
Christ's residence upon earth) or more present then in his Word. Certainly,
never any Protestant Author, but only Papists writ so before himself. And where
does Master Calvin say Christ's body is, which we really and truly receive in
the Lords Supper? What? on the Altar? there is no such syllable in him; but the
very next words, which the Bishop purposely concealed, resolve us, that it is
in heaven; Calvin in
Christum IN CAELO MANENTEM o Nobis recipi, sine ut in celesti sun gloria
maneat, and illuc aspici, and inde se tibi communicet. The like our Common 1
Cor. 11.
Prayer-Booke and Homilies also resolve. Therefore they call on us, Sursum
corda, to lift up our hearts and faith to heaven, and feed upon Christ there;
not on the Altar. This Cobweb distinction therefore of his (especially if
compared with the Sea A necessary Introduction to the Archbishops Trial, p.
159. to 163.
Alterations and Additions made by him in the Scottish Common-Prayer-Booke;
where he clearly maintains a Transubstantiation) will no ways cover his shame,
or take off his guilt. As for his DEO and Altari, the Argument pressed against
him from it is still unanswered: since one and the selfsame worship in one
and the selfsame act, instance, is given jointly to both. And whereas he
says, the object distinguishes the worship; it is most false; since See Mr.
Rutherfords Divin right of church Government, chapter 1. quest. 5.
Divine worship is and may be given to an Altar, an Image, a creature, a piece
of Bread (as among the Pagans and Papists) as well as to God himself. So that
this whole part of our Evidence remains unanswered, unshaken in any
particular, and is only aggravated by his poor evasions, his impudent
justifications, of what he has cause to be most ashamed, if not confounded,
before such a great Tribunal and judicious Auditory.

The eleventh charge against me is, the expunging of sundry passages against
Object. 11.
Popery, Arminianisme, etc. out of several printed Books and Sermons, by me
and others, before they could pass the Press, which Passages have been
reduced to several heads: I shall not recapitulate the charges of this kind,
but answer them severally in their order.

The first of them is my own Page 245. etc. Answer.
purging out of Doctor Sibthops Sermon sundry passages against Popery, evil
Counselors and prophaners of the Sabbath. Object. 1.


To which I answer, First, that the King committed the perusal of this Sermon
to four Bishops, whereof I was but one, and these expunctions were made by
their consent, not by me alone: Secondly, the first of them seemed to lay an
aspersion on the Emperor, the King of Spain and France, the Duke of Bavaria
and Archdutchesse, as if they had a design to extirpate the Protestant
Religion; therefore it was not thought fit it should pass the Press, for
fear of giving offense to them: Thirdly, the second of them seemed to cast an
aspersion upon the Kings Counsel, and was therefore crossed out: The third
gives the name of the Sabbath to the Lords day, which is never so termed in the
new Testament; appropriated to the Jewish Sabbath only on the Saturday, now
wholly abbrogated; and likewise makes Popery to trench upon the breach of the
first Commandment: which being a thing doubtful and disputable, was thought
fit to be expunged.

To which was replied, First, that the committing of this Sermon to three other
Bishops besides himself to be examined, is a bare averment of his own Reply.
without any proof; that any other perused it besides himself, appears not:
All the additions, purgations in it, are made with his own hand only, and
none others, therefore his alone; yea, if he did it jointly with others, this
will not extenuate his fault, since as we must not do evil alone, so we must

not follow a multitude to do it. His answers to these expunged particulars,
are most absurd and false: For the first of them was so far from being a
scandal, that it was then (and yet is) a most See A necessary Introduction,
etc. page 86 c. 17.
apparent truth, published to all the Kingdom in the Kings own Letters to
every County throughout the Realm, concerning the Loan in February 1627. to
draw it on, and the Doctor in his Sermon to set on this Loan, did but
transcribe it out of the Kings own Letter; if then it were a real truth, why
was it blotted out of his Sermon, more then out of the Kings own Letter? If a
scandal and untruth, why did the King and his Counsel then publish it in
their Letters, to delude the people and draw on the Loan? But the truth is,
our Religion must be rooted out abroad by the Emperor, Kings of Spain,
France, with their Confederates, and undermined by the Prelaticall and popish
party at home, yet we must have no liberty to speak of it our selves, or
publish it to others, for fear of preventing the design: For the second
clause, he thought it might reflect on, or rise up in judgment one day against
himself, therefore it was wisdom for him to raze it out; the Kings evil
Counselors by this means must neither be reprehended nor punished: For the
third passage, it is true, that the Lords day is not directly styled the
Sabbath in the New Testament, yet it is termed the first Mat. 28. 1. Mark. 16.
1. Luke 24. 1. 1 Cor. 26. 1.
of the SABBATHS often times in it; but admit it were not, yet seeing all days
of sacred rest and worship whatsoever, are styled Levi. 16: 31. c. 23. 24. 32.

Definition, is nothing else, but a weekly day of sacred rest from worldly
labors, pleasures, employments, devoted wholly to Gods public and private
worship; and the Lords day is such a Sabbath as this, and so termed by See

Councels, Fathers, foreign writers of all sorts, and more especially by our
own English 13. Eli. c. 16
Statutes, Homilies, Proclamations, Letters Patent, Canons, Bishops visitation
Articles, and Writers of all sorts; why this passage concerning the Lords day
Sabbaths sanctification, and the profanation of it, should be obliterated by
him, no reason can be rendered, but only the profane Anti-sabbatarian
Disposition of his own heart, which soon after more publicly displayed it
self, in the re-publishing and pressing the Declaration for Lord's Day sports:
sports: For the latter clause of this deleted period, concerning connivance at
Popery, which trencheth upon the first and second Commandment, and making the
Laws concerning it, mere Engines of State, to draw reward for toleration,
dispensation and connivance, etc. his excuse is most miserable and ridiculous:
For first, it is generally agreed by all Protestant Writers, that Popery
trencheth upon the first Commandment, by advancing the Sea Officium ^eatae
Mariae ^ernardinus De ^usti his Meriale. Bishop Ushers answer to the Jesuits
Challenge Mornay his Mystery of Iniquity. Doctor Reinolds de Idolatria Romano

Virgin Mary, Pope (to omit the Bredden Wafer) into the very Throne of God
himself, and Deifying them both with divine Titles, Adorations, Attributes,
Epithites, Orisons, and the like; therefore no reason to delete this clause,
that it trencheth on the first Commandment: the rather, because Paul himself
affirms it in direct terms, 2 These. 2. 3, 4. as all orthodox Expositors
resolve: Secondly, its agreed by all Protestants, yea, by this Arch-Prelat
himself (in show at least, when his reputation seemed to be somewhat blasted,
as if he were devoted to Popery) and expressly resolved by our Homilies against
the peril of Idolatry, that Popery expressly trencheth upon the second
Commandment sundry ways, as by adoring Crucifixes, Images, Saints, Angels,
Relics, Altars, the consecrated Host, yea, by invocation of Saints departed,
and introduction of sundry Idolatrous Superstitious Rites, Ceremonies, forms
of Worship, invented by Popes, Priests, Friars, into the Worship of God:
Therefore had he deleted its intrenchment upon the first Commandment as
dubious, yet since there is no question of their transgressing the second in
all these particulars, his abolition thereof is inexcusable, and displayes his
popish disposition: Thirdly, however had he deleted this likewise, yet his
obliterating that which follows, against connivance at, and suspention of
Laws against Popery and Papists for luchre sake, least God make the gain
gotten by this dividing betwixt him and Idols, to be like that of Solomon's,
which was recompensed with the loss and dividing of his Kingdom betwixt his
Son and a Stranger, etc. (the sad effects whereof we have lately felt) with
all other passages whatsoever against Popery (especially at this juncture of
time, when all foreign popish Princes had confederated to extirpate the
Protestant Religion in foreign parts, as the first deleted passage informs
us) is such an unsufferable execrable crime, in one who pretends himself a
Protestant Bishop, and had then no legal authority to correct or license Books
for the Press, as deserves the highest censure; yea, displays to all the world
the hidden Popery of his heart, if not his secret correspondency with the
Romish party to replant their false superstitious Religion and Idolatry in our
Church; and from this original purgation of his, we may visibly discover, that
all succeeding expunctions of this kind made by his own chaplains and other
Agents at Lambeth or London-house, proceeded primarily from himself, as the
original cause and Author of them.

The second Objection of this kind is, my alterations of the Prayers See here

Impression of them, Objection 2.
Anno 1635.

To this I answer, First, that these alterations were not made by me, but the
Answer.
Prayers were sent unto me altered by the King himself, who commanded me to
see them printed according to those alterations; and I have here the Books,
with his Majesty's hand and Warrant to each of them for what I did: Secondly,
that the expressions were somewhat overharsh, and fit to be altered, terming
their very Religion, Rebellion, being but the Christian Religion, and the same
with Ours, as I have proved at large in my Speech in Star Chamber, to which I
must refer, where I have rendered reasons for it, which gave general
satisfaction then, and I hope will do so to your Lordships now.

To which was replied, First, that the Archbishop shows his great
undutifulnesse here in casting this and other his unwarrantable popish actions
on the King Reply.
himself: Secondly, that for ought appears he procured from the King this
Warrant since the alterations were printed, yea complained of, and that by
circumvention: Thirdly, that it had been his duty to have dissuaded the King
from giving way to such scandalous alterations in favor of Jesuits, Papists,
Traitors, and their bloody Religion. Fourthly, that himself in his Speech,
page 33, 34. confesses, he made the Alterations himself by the Kings command:
Therefore the Book was not sent him altered by the King or any other, as now he
falsely pretends. Fifthly, as for the grounds of the most gross alteration
mentioned in his Speech, we have Page 247, 248, 249.

The third Here page 249, 250. Answer.

To which I answer, First, that it is not proved that I made these Purgations:

the making of them, in my SPEECH in Star Chamber, where they were objected.

purgations in his said Speech, to be made by himself, and his confederated
brethren, to whom the care of this Fast was committed; therefore he much
forgets himself here in denying it to be proved, when we undeniably evidenced
it, by his own printed Confession: Secondly, we have already Page 242, 250,
251.
refuted his reasons for those purgations mentioned in his Speech, discovering
their absurdity, and fully proving, that they were made merely in favor of
Popery, to which he has not returned the least shadow of answer; therefore we
shall acquiesse therein without further reply.

Objection 4.
Doctor Potters Book, entitled, Want of Charity, etc. the second Edition.

To which I answer, First, that he writ to me of his own accord, to alter or
correct any thing I thought meet in the second Impression of his Book, and what
I did therein Answer.
was upon his own request: Secondly, that the expressions I advised him to
amend, were either such as were very harsh, as Believe in the Pope; or somewhat
obscure, as The Idol of Rome, etc. Thirdly, that his exposition of Matthew. 18.
17, 11. Dic Ecclesiae, etc. concerns not the Parliament, but the Sanhedrin, or
Civil Court of the Jews: And whereas it is urged, that I writ, his Exposition
of it, seems to give as much power to the Parliament, as to the Church (or
Convocation) in Church affairs, which is a derogation to the Parliaments
Jurisdiction; I conceive it to be none, since it appears by the Statute of 1.
Eliz. c. 1. that the Parliament cannot determine any thing in matter of
Religion, without assent of the Clergy in their Convocation; this Act,
providing, That the High Commissioners shall not in any wise adjudge any matter
to be Heresy, but only such as has been heretofore determined, ordered or
adjudged to be Heresy by the authority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by the
first four general Councels, or any of them, etc. or such as shall be
hereafter ordered, judged or determined to be Heresy by the high Court of
Parliament in this Realm, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CLERGY IN THEIR
CONVOCATION. Fourthly, that I did not alter or raze out those passages, but
only left them to the Doctors own consideration, who thereupon of himself
amended and left them out.

To this was replied, First, that Doctor Potter writ to him only to correct or
alter by his servant Master Dell or others, any thing in his Book OFFENSIVE
Reply.
TO HIM: To which he returned this answer; I have done that which you have so
desired, etc. So as these very passages against the Pope and Papists were
offensive to him, as well as to them; at which (as it seems by the Doctors
Letter) he had formerly taken some offense, else why should he thus write to
him, to alter and correct any thing in his Book offensive to his GRACE? It
seems by this, that whatever offended the Pope or Papists (be it but an harsh
expression) offended his Grace too, who was all for Charitable expressions
toward them, who are so uncharitable toward us.

Secondly, for the expressions themselves: The first of them is not so harsh,
as true and fitting, since Papists not only believe the Pope, See Augustinus
Triumphus Bellarmini, and others passim.
but believe in him too; viz. That his Exposition of Scripture is infallible;
that he cannot err in his chair; that this Lord God the Pope, cannot only
pardon sins, and release souls out of purgatory at his pleasure, but
infallibly save all such who adhere to, believe in, and trust upon him for
salvation. The latter of them, the Idol of Rome, is a proper Periphrasis or
Character of the Pope himself, who is there See Morney his Mystery of Iniquity.
idolized, adored sundry ways.

Thirdly, the deleting his exposition on Matthew, 18. 17, 18. upon the reason
rendered by him, is both derogatory and destructive to the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction of Parliaments, in Ecclesiastical causes and affairs, which See
Truth triumphing over Falsehood.
our Parliaments have always judged, settled, established in all Ages, often
times without, yea against the Clergies consent, the Convocation only
propounded, advised, and submitted wholly to the Parliaments judgment: Yea,
our Parliaments have made Laws concerning Heresy, its punishment, and matters
of Religion, sometimes without the Clergies consent, as it is evident by the
Statutes of 25 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 28 Hen. VIII. c. 10. 35 Hen. VIII. c. 5. 1
Edw. 6. c. 1. 2. and 12. with others: Sometimes upon their Petition and earnest
request, as 5 Ric. II. c. 5. 2. Hen. IV. c. 15. (repealed, though never truly a
Statute, since the Commons never consented to them) 2 Hen. V. c. 7. Sometimes
by their request and advice too, as 31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 34 Hen. VIII. c. 1. 1
k 2 Ph. and Mary, c. 6. As for the Statute of 1 Eliz. c. 1. it no ways
inferres, that the Parliament it self cannot adjudge or determine any
Ecclesiastical matters without the assent of the Clergy in the Convocation
(for then they had never cast our Popery and the Popes usurped authority which
the Clergy still maintained, nor wrought any reformation of Religion in our
present or former Parliaments) but only Enacts, That the High Commissioners
shall adjudge nothing to be Heresy, not formerly resolved to be so (as this
Act expresses) but what the Parliament shall adjudge ^rder and determine to be
Heresy by assent of the Clergy in their Convocation; from whence no argument
can be deduced, but this Nonsequitur; The High Commissioners can judge no new
opinion to be, nor punish it as Heresy, unless the Parliament of England
first adjudge it to be Heresy with the assent of the Clergy in Convocation, by
the express provision of this Act: Ergo, the Parliament can make no
Ecclesiastical Laws, meddle with no Church affairs, nor determine ought to
be Heresy unless the Clergy in Convocation first assent thereto. Pretty
incoherent Logic, and Anti-parliamentary Divinity.

Fourthly, that Doctor Potter himself voluntarily corrected them upon his
Letter, appears not; but if he did, it was to please this Archbishop, in
deleting those passages which he signified to be displeasing to him, the better
to obtain the Prebendary he sued for to him in this Letter: Wherefore these
purgations must rest still upon his score.

To the Popish Alterations and Delections, under his own hand made in the
SCOTTISH COMMON PRAYER BOOK, which the Commons desired to press, he pleaded
the ACT OF PACIFICATION AND OBLIVION, against the very reading of them:
Whereupon they did forbear, and wave the reading of them for the present,
though clean out of the ACT, alleging only, that this Plea of his was a
plain confession of his Guilt.

The fifth sort of purgations Page 252, 253, 254.
objected to me are those in SIR ANTHONY HUNGERFORDS Books, which DOCTOR BAAR
my Chaplain would Obje. 5.
have expunged: Of which SIR EDWARD HUNGERFORD his Son complained to me, as
he deposes, after he had expostulated with my Chaplain, who would cross them
out, or not license the Books: Whereupon I told him, I having many other
employments had trusted my CHAPLAINS with those things, which I wholly
referred to them, therefore what they thought fit to leave out, you must Submit
to: And thereupon would not redress his Grievance herein.

To this I Answer, First, that if there were any Error herein, it was not mine
but my Chaplains, since dead, who if he were alive, and might have been heard
to speak for himself, would doubtless have given a good account and reason
to your Lordships, why he thought these passages unfit to be printed. Saint
Augustine says, that often times infinite harm did accrue to the Church, per
temerarios veritatis assertatores; and every Treatise written against Papists
is not so satisfactory, but that it may prove so disadvantagious to the Cause,
as to be unfit to be printed: It may be these were such; however, God be
thanked, the Books were printed with those passages in them, and so no harm
done by my Chaplain. Secondly, for my answer to Sir Edward; it was true, I had
so many public businesses then upon me, that I had no leisure to peruse Books
for the Press, and thereupon referred that trust wholly to my Chaplains;
therefore if they offended, they only must answer for it, not I: and should I
herein control what my Chaplains had done in this kind, it would have so
discouraged them, that none of them have undertaken the office of a Licenser
afterward: Besides, I should have been perpetually troubled with clamours
against that which my Chaplains thought fit to be blotted out of Books tendered
to them to be licensed, for them every man would have appealed from them to me
in this kind, so as I should have had no quiet.

To this was replied, First, that we have formerly proved at large, that his
Chaplains errors and delinquencies in this kind are his own, because the
care Reply.
of licensing Books was originally vested in himself, and they were but his
entrusted servants, for whom he must be responsible at his peril; and the
rather in this case, because he confesses his Chaplain is dead and cannot be
punished for it, who if alive, could give no reason for not licensing those
Books, unless these passages against popery were expunged; but only this,
that it was by his Lords own special directions, who would suffer no harsh
passages against popery or Papists to pass our Presses unexpunged; as appears
by those himself purged out of Doctor Sibthorps Sermon, the Prayer for the
Fast, Doctor Potters Treatise; and that himself was every way as Popish, as
good a friend to Popery as his Grace. Secondly, for Saint Augustines saying, we
approve it, confessing, that every Pamphlet weakly written against Popery is
not fit to pass the Press: But this concerns not those two Treatises,
written by a converted Papist of eminent rank, with excellent solidity,
judgment, learning, which must not be licensed; not upon any pretext of
weakness or want of solidity in them (never so much as once objected;) but
only because Sir Edward Hungerford would not condescend that the forecited
clauses against the Pope and Popery (some of them taken out of Popish Authors
themselves) should be expunged out of his Fathers Works, to martilate them.
That these Books were since printed without those purgations, is no thanks to
the Archbishop nor his Chaplain, who would not license them unless first
purged, and the licensing of them without such purgations by others, proves
strongly, that there was no just grounds of purging them, but only ^^ gratify
the Pope and popery. Fourthly, we believe his answer true, that he intruded
himself out of a polypragmaticall humor into so many secular employments, as
he had little time to peruse Books or preach the Gospel; but this is only his
crime, not his excuse: However, since he could find so much leisure upon all
occasions to persecute godly Ministers, suppress Orthodox Books, Lectures,
Prayers, advance Arminianisme, Popery, and popish designs, he might by like
reason have found out time enough to have perused these small Treatises or at
least the clauses excepted against by his Chaplain upon Sir Edward
Hungerford's complaint, being a Gentleman of quality and fortune. Fifthly, the
latter part of his answer proves, that it was altogether bootlesse for any man
to complain to him of his Chaplains abuses in purging out passages against
Popery, and that he was resolved to hear no complaints of this kind, much
less not to redress them: His reasons rendered for it are most absurd. The
first is, because this would discourage his Chaplains from being Licensers: It
seems by this they were so really, so realously popish, that they must not be
checked or controlled in the least kind for purging out ought against Popes,
Popery, Papists, for fear of discouragement, no, not by himself; or so
waspish and self-willed (like himself) that they would fling up their very
Office of licensing, if they might not have their wills, to obliterate what they
pleased, without any superior control: But this is but a pretense, for Doctor
Bray himself rendered this as the true reason of hie refusal to license these
clauses to Sir Edward; That they would offend those of the Roman Religion,
against whom no harsh phrases must be used, we being now in a fair way to win
them (viz. by reconciling our selves to them, not them to us) therefore they
must be either expladed, or the Book left unprinted. The second reason is yet
more absurd, taken from his own case and quiet, that he should have been
perpetually troubled with employments and clamours of this nature, etc. It
seems it was his Chaplains constant practice by his own direction, to purge
out all sharp passages against the Pope, popery, and popish Innovations out of
new licensed Books, os else the reason would not hold; for did they it but
rarely, not usually, he should not have been perpetually disturbed with such
complaints as this of Sir Edwards: But be it so or not, yet certainly it was no
more then his place and duty required, to hear and redress all just
complaints of this kind against his Chaplains when they did amiss, else
Authors, Stationers, Printers, might be most injuriously handled by them,
without knowing where to complain or seek relief; for to whom else should
they complain, but unto him, whose Chaplains they were, whose place, trust,
they herein executed by his own appointment? Or who else should or durst right
them herein if injured, but himself? and if it were no trouble for him to
spend whole days, weeks, years, in advancing unlawful oppressive Loan,
Monopolies, Projects, Impositions, Texes, to oppress the Subjects, contrary
to, and inconsistent with his Archiepiscopall function; with what face could he
deem it any trouble or vexation to spare one hour or two each month or year in
hearing, examining such just complaints against his Chaplains, when they so
grossly offended? This answer therefore plainly remonstrates, that he was
inflexibly resolved his Chaplains should purge out all notable passages
against the Pope, Popery, and popish errors, no doubt by his own special
direction given to them: Therefore let who would complain thereof, he must go
without redress, and submit to his Chaplains pleasure, else his whole Volume
must go unlicensed, be it never so useful, so necessary for our Religions
just defense; which manifests the transcendent height of his and his Chaplains
resolutions, their arbitrary, uncontrolable proceedings to set up popery
without opposition, by these Purgations.

The fixed purged Book is Doctor Featlies Sermons, ordered by my command (after
they were printed by an ancient License) to be carried to my Chaplain Doctor
Obje. 6. Here p. 108. 254. 269. 270
Bray, who gelded out of them diverse of the smartest and most masculine
passages against Popery, Arminianisme, toleration of Papists, Priests, Jesuits,
and a passage against Adoration of Images by Papists, taken out of the very
Homily against the peril of Idolatry; whereof he complained to Sir Edmond
Soot, desiring him to acquaint me with it; who told him, he conceived it would
be in vain, because he thought my Chaplain had directions from me for what he
did, and that I would not alter any thing in this kind done by my Chaplains.

To this I answer: First, that though it be the place and office of the
Archbishop of Canterbury to have a care what Books are Licensed, yet Doctor
Featly himself Answer.
(who has been a Chaplain and Licenser of Books under my Predecessor) can
attest, that the Archbishop himself did seldom or never use to peruse or
license Books in person, but only by his Chaplains. Secondly, these
purgations were made by my Chaplain, who is dead and cannot answer for
himself; not by me: and Doctor Featly never complained to me of them; neither
did Sir Edmond Scot ever acquaint me with any complaint the Doctor made to him
about it. Thirdly, though some few smart Passages of this kind are expunged,
mitigated, and left out; yet there are in his Sermons, yea in those very Pages
complained of, many sharp passages against Popery left in (two or three
whereof he read) as one against Prayer to Saints, p. 787. where he compares the
Papists with the Baalists, p. 808. where he avers, that the Pope is Antichrist;
and p. 810. where he calls the Pope, the whore of Babylon. Therefore these could
not be thought to be crossed out in favor of Papists and Popery, but because
the expressions in them were such as might give just occasion of distaste.
Fourthly, I shall by your Lordships favor demand of Doctor Featly himself two
questions, and desire his answer to them. First, Whether when he was a Licenser
in my Predecessors time, it was not usual for his Chaplains to qualify or
raze out some unfitting expressions when they saw cause, out of Books tendered
to them to license? and whether they were not liable to censure, if any such
escaped them, upon complaint? Secondly, Whether himself, since the sitting of
this Parliament, has not written a Book, afterward licensed? and whether the
Licenser did not alter and blot something out of it? what was it, and who did
it?

To which sudden questions the Doctor being commanded by the Lords to give an
answer; replied to the first Question; That he and his fellow-Licensers did
sometimes use to qualify or obliterate some passages savouring of Puritanisme,
or in favor of it, (especially after the burning of Doctor Mockets Book, for
which the Licenser was reprehended) and that himself was once questioned
before King James for a Book licensed, about a passage concerning the calling
of the Jews, and for Master Eltons Book upon the Commandments, savouring of
Puritanisme; but he never knew in his time of any Passages against the Papists,
Popery, Arminianisme, or the like, expunged out by Archbishop Abbot, or his
Chaplains; nor any one questioned for licensing any such, but rather
encouraged, till of late times. To the second, he confessed that he and Master
Rouse did jointly write and publish a Book fince this Parliament, entitled
Vertumnus Romanus, and that Master Rouse caused him to strike out a Passage in
it that was somewhat sharp against the Separatists, which he did at his desire.
Whereupon the Archbishop urged, that then he hoped his Chaplains might have
the same liberty to cross what they thought fitting out of the Books they
licensed, though it were against Popery.

To this was answered: First, that by Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions, Numb. 51.
The Archbishops of Canterbury, York and Bishop of London themselves (not their
Chaplains) Reply.
are appointed to License Books, and trusted with this charge: which they
personally performed, as appears by sundry Entries of Books licensed by them
in the Stationers Register of Entries: And why their Successors in these days
should not personally license Books and discharge this trust, as well as their
Predecessors, making (...) of their Chaplains only for their assistance, to
report the substance of the (...) unprinted to them, no reason can be given,
but either their carelessness, (...), or overmuch intermedling with secular
affairs, no ways concerning or beseeming them. Secondly, that his Chaplain
made these Purgations, not himself, is no excuse, since he did it by his
special command and direction, as Sir Edmond Scots words, and Doctor Featlies
testimony evidence. Thirdly, his Chaplains death is no excuse of his own guilt.
That Doctor Featly complained not to him of these Purgations, is no excuse; for
if he had, Sir Edward Hungerfords example, his own answer to him then, his
present expressions at the Bar now, and Sir Edmond Scots words to Doctor
Featly clearly prove, it had been bootlesse and he remediless; Legem sibi
dixerat ipse, he was resolved to admit and redress no complaints of this
nature against his Chaplains. Fourthly, the permitting of some Passages
against Popery to stand in the Doctors Sermon, is an aggravation of his
Chaplains crime in purging out others of the same nature; for why should not
all stand as well as some, especially that against Popish worshipping of Images
taken verbatim out of our Homilies there quoted, and the very words of the
Scriptuze it self against conniving at Popish Seducers to Idolatry? Indeed
those that remained are more general; these obliterated more particular,
sharp, piercing, and more concerned our present times, practices; therefore
less reason to be expunged. Fifthly, these expunctions out of the Doctors
Sermons were so many that the Printer was enforced to new print some 16. or 18.
sheets in folio, to his great prejudice. That those Passages he cites escaped
their purgation, was because the Book being large, they passed undiscerned
till after its publication, else doubtless the Archbishop and his Chaplains
would have crossed them out in Doctor Featlies Sermons, as well as in Doctor
Sibthorps, or in Doctor Potters, Bishop Hals own Book, Doctor Jones and
Doctor Clerk; and not have permitted his Brother Pontiffe of Rome, to be
styled Antichrist, and the whore of Rome, and his Priests compared unto
Baalists. Sixthly, Doctor Featlies testimony is a very strong evidence against
the Archbishop; for before his time, there were never any such Purgations made,
but only of Passages in favor of Puritanisme, nor any Books questioned, or
Passages deleted that were against the Pope, Popery, Arminianisme, Jesuits,
Seminary Priests, or Papists, which the Archbishop and his Chaplains first
introduced. As for his Vertumnus Romanus, being jointly written by Master Rowse
and himself; it was just that Master Rowse should have liberty to cross out
by the Doctors consent any passage he disliked, and the Doctor consented to
have this deleted; this Passage therefore not being obliterated by any
Licenser, but by the Authors themselves by joint consent, and being not against
Popery or Papists, but Separatists only (who profess the same Doctrine with
us, and were then ready to join with us in one way of Worship, of Government)
is no extenuation or justification of his and his Chaplains purging this
Doctors Book so grosely as they did of Passages against the Pope, Popery and
Arminianisme.

The next Purgations Here p. 254. 255.
objected, were made in Doctor Clerks, Doctor Jones, and Master Obje. 7.
Wards Books, by Doctor Heywood, Doctor Baker, Doctor Weeks.

To this I answer: First, that there are diverse sharp Passages yet remaining
in Doctor Clerks Sermons against Papists: that they were licensed part of them
by Answer.
Doctor Weeks (none of mine but the Bishop of Londons household Chaplain) and
part of them by Doctor Heywood my Chaplain: That Master White distinguished not
what Sermons were Licensed by the one, what by the other. Besides, Master White
is but a single witness. Secondly, Doctor Jones his Commentary on the Hebrews
was licensed and purged by Doctor Baker, the Bishop of Londons Chaplain, and
Master Wards Book by Doctor Weeks, not by me or my Chaplains; therefore they
concern me not.

To this was replied: First, that the most pungent and pregnant Passages in
Doctor Clerks Sermons against the Popes Authority, tyranny, pride, Jesuits,
Reply.
Priests, Papists, Arminians, Arminianisme, Popery and Popish errors, are
(...) tally wiped out by the Licensers, and very few such escaped their sponge
(...) leaving therefore of a few inconfiderable Passages against them
unexpung^^^ (...) no more excuse the obliterating of the rest; then a thiefes
leaving of a true man's clothes on his back, or sparing his life, will
justify or extenuate the taking away of his purse, or the leaving a few
Cottages standing excuse the burning of a whole City besides. That Doctor
Weeks and Doctor Heywood joined in expunging these Sermons, proves their
confederacy only, not lessens but aggravates their iniquity. As for Doctor
Weeks he was his own Chaplain as well as the Bishop of Londons, as appears
by his own hand and Diary; therefore he must answer for his misdemeanors in
this kind, for purging both Doctor Clorkes Sermons and Master Wards
Commentary: For Doctor Baker, he was his own great favorite, advanced by him
to a Prebendary, as appears by the Docquet Book; Therefore his Index
Expurgatorius on Doctor Jones his Commentary (proceeding doubtless from this
Archbishops antecedent directions) must remain upon his score, notwithstanding
all his shifting evasions. To the particular passages purgged out of these
Authors, he returned no answer at all; only by these his several answers to
these Purgations, all the world may clearly discover his shameless impudence
and Popery in justifying them, his brainsick folly in his extenuations of
them, his palpable Romanizing in practicing many of them himself, and the
whole weight of all the Branches in this charge falling heavily upon him,
notwithstanding all his shifts to ward them off.

The twelfth charge Page 349.
objected against me is, my connivance at the importation of popish Books, and
restoring them to the owners, when seized by the Customers Object. 12.
and Searchers, contrary to the Statute of 3. Jacobi e. 5.

To this I answer, I never connived at their importation, and that the
restoring of them when seized, was not by any direction of mine, but by order
of the High Answer.
Commission Court.

To which was replied, First, that he does not so much as once allege, he ever
gave any order for seizing any Popish Books imported, whereas the Customers,
Reply.
Searchers, Pursivants, and other Officers had strict Warrants and special
Commands from him to seize all imported Bibles with Notes, with all Books
savouring any way of Puritanisme, as he deemed it, or tending against
Arminianisme and popish Innovations. Secondly, he confesses, that popish Books
when seized, were usually restored by order of the High Commission Court to the
owners, contrary to the Statute, whereas that Court never restored any Bibles
with Notes, or Books against Arminianisme or popish Innovations seized by their
order, but burnt them privately, or otherwise destroyed them. Thirdly, he
proves not that any of them were restored by Order of Court, whereas Egerton
swears, that Mottershead averred, they were restored by the Archbishops own
order, without the Courts: But be it by order of Court, yet his crime is still
the same, since himself sat President and chief Controller in the High
Commission, and consented to these Orders, if not commanded them to be made;
whereas in duty he should have crossed them; that Court not daring to make any
such Orders of Restitution without his consent, who had such an overruling
power in it.

The thirteenth particular Here page 349 to 354.
objected against me is, my advancing of Arminians and Clergymen
superstitiously and popishly affected, to Bishoprics, Deaneries, Headships
Object. 13.
of Houses, Prebendaries, and all other Ecclesiastical preferments, yea
Chaplainships, not only about my self, but about his Majesty, and the Prince:
with my encroachments herein upon the Lord Keeper, the Lord High Chamberlain,
Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries; and my disgracing, persecuting godly
Orthodox Ministers, and keeping them from preferment, for opposing
Arminianisme, popery and popish Innovations; of both which they have given
sundry particular instances, to the chief whereof I shall return such answers
as I am ^ble in due place.

(...) this I shall answer something in general, First, that to my remembrance
Answer.
(...) preferred no such persons to Bishoprics, or any Ecclesiastical livings
and preferments; secondly, if any of those preferred by me were such at the
time of their preferments, it was unknown to me; and if they turned such
afterward, I could neither foresee nor prevent it: Thirdly, on the contrary, I
have preferred diverse worthy orthodox Ministers, free from all exceptions; as
Master Tailor of Clapham, now one of the Assembly, Master John Downham, Bishop
Hall, and sundry others.

To which was replied, First, that we had proved the generallity of those he
preferred, to be addicted, inclined to Arminianisme, Popery, or both, and so
Reply.
known to be when he advanced them, no doubt to himself better then others,
and this their inclination was one chief cause of their preferment. Secondly,
that his preferment of Master John Downham and Master Tailor, orthodox men, to
petty Benefices, and no higher preferments, was but a mere stale to blind some
peoples eyes, or stop their mouths, for his advancing of so many rotten,
corrupt, popish Clergymen to Bishoprics, Deanaries, Prebendaries,
Arch-deaconries, Masterships of Colleges, and the fattest Benefices; but no
justification nor extenuation of his preferring of so many such. Thirdly, for
his advancement of Bishop Hall (viz. from one Bishopric to another) it is yet
a mere non liquet to us, only averred not proved by himself; but if true, it
was rather to corrupt and draw him over to his party, then prefer him for his
own or the Churches benefit; and how that worthy Prelate has degenerated,
declined since, in case of Episcopacy, the Scottish Wars, the new Canons, the
Et cetera Oath, popish Ceremonies, Innovations of all sorts, and pressing the
book of Sports upon the Lords day, we have already manifested by his own
Letters in part, and the residue is so experimentally known to most of his
Diocese, that it needs no proof. However, his preferring of above twelve
Judas-Bishops to one true Apostle, is a grand disservice to our Church, our
Religion, and no justification nor extenuation of his offense therein.

For particulars, the Here page 250 to 256.
first thing I am charged with, is for advancing Master Mountague, Doctor
Manwaring, Bishop Neale, Bishop Wren, Doctor Lindsey, and Obje. 1.
others, to Bishoprics, men publikly complained against, one of them censured
in Parliament, and disabled from all preferments in our Church, which was
proved by the Docquet Books.

To this I answer, First, that Master Mountague was not preferred by me to any
Bishopric, neither is the Docquet Book any good proof thereof, but he was
Answ.
preferred to it by Sir Dudly Carltons means; true it is, I was at his
consecration, but that was by command, and I could not refuse or resist it:
Besides, he was a great Scholar, therefore thought worthy of preferment by the
King. Secondly, for Doctor Manwaring, I did not prefer him, but it was his
Majesty's pleasure to bestow a Deanary, and after that a Bishopric on him in
regard of his sufferings for his service, notwithstanding his sentence, and he
commanded me to consecrate him, which command I had no power to withstand or
oppose, being bound by Law and the duty of my Place to obey it. Thirdly, for
Bishop Neale he was a worthy man, free from Popery and Arminianisme, who in
King James his Reign, before his preferment to Winchester and York had been
preferred to sundry Dignities, Bishoprics, and was in office and good esteem
at Court, both with King James and King Charles. Fourthly, For Bishop Wren,
when I first preferred him, he was a worthy man, who waited upon his Majesty
when he was in Spain, and did good service there; if he has misdemeaned
himself since, it is his own fault, not mine, he is still alive, and must
answer for himself, to the charge and impeachment exhibited against him.
Fifthly, Doctor Lindsey was a very great Scholar, who deserved well, neither
did I know him to be an Arminian; it is true, he was preferred to two
Bishoprics successively, but it was by Bishop Neale, whose Chaplain he was,
not by me; there is no Oath nor clea^^ evidence it was by my means, the
Docquet book being no sufficient (...) for it mentioned only the Kings
pleasure and order for it, signified by (...) Signet to me, as a servant, but
not that I was the author of his preferments; the King may signify his
pleasure to the Signet Office by whom he pleases; as for Master Smarts
testimony of him, there were some quarrels and differences at Durham, between
Master Smart and him, which may cause him to speak the worse of him: Master
Walker says only, he was reputed a great Arminian, which is no Heresy.
Sixthly, however these were affected, yet none can charge me with any Popery or
Arminianisme.

To this was replied, First, that we have as clearly proved as the Sun at
noon day, that Mountague was protected, advanced by him, and that in contempt
of Reply.
the Parliament, by his own Diary, the Docquet Book, Bishop Mountagues own
Letter of thanks to him for his favor and preferments, which he has no way
answered; as for his preferment, that it was by Sir Dudly Carltons means, it
is but a bare surmise of his own, without proof or color; and for his
presence at his consecration, it was merely voluntary to countenance him, not
by command for ought appears. Secondly, it appears most clearly by the
Evidence given, that Doctor Manwaring was advanced both to his Deanary and
Bishopric by his means and recommendations alone, for the disservice he had
done the Kingdom by those Sermons for which he was justly sentenced in
Parliament, and the ill offices he had since done our Church, by introducing
Stone-Altars, Copes, with other Popish Relics, Ceremonies thereinto; that he
was thus advanced and consecrated a Bishop by him in direct affront of the
Parliaments censure, disabling him from all future preferments, we have fully
proved: And whereas he lays the Odium of his preferments only upon the King
to excuse himself, it is but his own bare allegation, without any shadow of
proof, and that in his own case, for his own defense, therefore not to be
credited: But admit it true, yet since himself was present at his censure in
the Lords House, upon the Commons impeachment of him, recorded it in his Diary,
and was accused for having a finger in his Sermons, and licensing them for the
Press, it was his duty to have acquainted his Majesty with, and minded him of
this his censure, disabling him for ever from all such preferments in our
Church, to have opposed his preferment, and withstood his consecration and
Mountagues too; the rather, because every man before any Bishops consecration,
has free liberty to put in any just exceptions against him, there being a
public Instrument solemnly posted up in the Arches at Bow, before every
Bishops consecration (as a necessary formality) giving public notice, That
such a one is to be consecrated the Bishop of such a Diocese such a day, and
signifying, that if any person can take any just exceptions against him, and
show good cause why he should not be consecrated, he shall be heard. In regard
whereof, this Archbishop ex Officio, might, yea ought to have showed the Lords
public censure of Manwaring, as a just legal Plea, why he should not be
consecrated a Bishop (as Master Jones the Printer did in a legal way object
Bishop Mountagues Popish and Arminian Books, with the proceedings pending
against him in Parliament for the same, is a just cause why he should not be
made a Bishop, yet he could not be heard nor prevail therein:) therefore the
neglect of this his trust, duty, contrary to Law, and his recommending,
consecrating him to be a Bishop, in affront of the Parliaments Judgment which
disabled him, must needs be a transcendent crime, no ways mittigated, but
aggravated, by his false disloyal excuses. Thirdly, for Bishop Neale, he was
ever reputed a Popish and Arminian Prelate, a persecutor of all orthodox, godly
Ministers, a preferrer of popish Arminian Clergymen, making choice of such for
his Chaplains, for such a one was he accused to his Majesty by the House of
Commons in their Remonstrance Anno 1628. and complained of in sundry
Parliaments before his advancement to Winchester or York: For his pretended
worth, all the Court knew very well he had little worth or learning in him,
being unable to preach, write, dispute, not preaching once in a dozen years or
more: For his preferments and Court-offices, they were gained, maintained by
flattery, symony, and his base temporizing servility, he serving as a ready
Instrument upon all occasions to introduce anypopish Innovasions in the Church,
and set on foot any oppressing projects in the State: Therefore his preferment
of such an ill Instrument (who first advanced and brought this Arch-Prelat into
favor at Court) is no ways excusable. Fourthly, Doctor Wren was before his
advancement to a Bishopric, a professed Arminian, a superstitious, popish,
dissolute, impious, corrupt Clergyman, and so reputed by all; therefore a fit
Chaplain to promote the Spanish Match and Design, to seduce his Majesty, when
in Spain, from our Religion; and his tyrannical, superstitious, popish
proceedings since he was made Bishop, have more fully discovered what he was
before: All or most of which being in pursuance of the Archbishops
Instructions, Injunctions to him (as his Annual Account of his proceedings to
him evidence) himself who promoted him and them, must be more guilty of, and
responsible for them, then Wren himself, who yet may suffer for them in due
time. Fifthly, Doctor Linseys schollership is not in question, but his Arminian,
popish inclination and opinions, which were so much the more dangerous, by
reason of his great reputed learning and schollership; the greatest Scholars,
if unsound, being the most pernicious seducers, and unfittest to be preferred
of all others: That he was promoted by Bishop Neales means, is a bare
allegation of his own without proof; that himself preferred him is clear by
the Docquet Book; how much he was tainted with Popery and Arminianisme, Master
Smart and Master Walker have deposed upon Oath, and his presumption in bringing
Sancta Clara to him, even when he was about to publish his Book, to acquaint
him with his person and design of reconciling us thereby to the Church of
Rome, (which himself records under his own hand) is a sufficient confirmation
of their testimony and his intimacy with him, after which he yet preferred him;
For Master Smarts quarrel with him at Durham, it was only for his
Arminianisme, popish Tenets, and Innovations there broached, introduced, and so
his testimony the more credible, he then complaining against him in Parliament
for it; for the Docquet Book, it is not simply, that the King signified his
pleasure by this Archbishops for Doctor Linseys, and those others preferments,
but that it was by Order from the Archbishop of Canterbury, therefore no doubt
by his procurement, consent and approbation, who had engrossed the sole
disposal of all preferments Ecclesiastical. Sixthly, to that he objects, that
however these were affected, yet none can object any Arminianisme or Popery to
him: We reply, that his constant advancing and favoring of such persons, is a
very strong evidence of his inclination to both; and our evidence already
produced to prove it, is so full, that it unavoidably manifests him guilty in
the highest Degree of both. Finally, he gives no answer to the other popish and
Arminian Bishops preferments by himself, and so confesses it.

The second thing I am Here p. 350.
charged with, is the preferring of Doctor Potter and Obje. 2.
Doctor Jackson, both Arminians, and Popish Doctor Cosins to Deanaries.

I answer, First, that Doctor Potter was a learned man, an there was no proof
Answer.
he is an Arminian, but by hearsay. Secondly, for Doctor Cosins, I named four
to the King for the Deanary of Peterborough, whereof he was one, and the King
pitched upon him by reason of his poverty and losses by the Scots. Thirdly, for
Doctor Jackson, he was a learned man and honest, for which cause I did prefer
him.

To which was replied, First, that we proved directly Doctor Potter was a
professed Arminian, by Doctor Featlies testimony, and so known, reputed to be
by all Reply.
in the University of Oxford, so as none can deny it; yea he preferred him as
he was thus inclined, not as a learned man; his learning making him only
capable of doing more mischief in propagating his Arminian errors. Secondly,
that he recommended Doctor Cosins to the King, and th Deanary, is clear by the
Docquet Book and his own confession; that he put any other in competition with
him* Is uncertain: Aowever, he carried the Deanary by his recommendation; and
for him to advance a person so popish, so supersttitious, so infamous, so often
complained against in Parliament for popery, as this Doctor was, who had done
so much mischief in our Church, upon any pretext, was, no doubt, a grand
offense. Thirdly, Doctor Jacksons civil conversation and learning, made his
errous and preferment more dangerous, more pernicious; his Arminian errors,
not his Learning or Honesty being the ground of his advancement to this
dignity, and of those other Deanes preferments, to which he has given no
answer.

The third thing Here p. 336. 337. Answ.
objected against me, is my encroachment upon the Lord Chamberlaines Office,
and preferring Popish and Arminian Chaplains in ordinary Object. 3.
to the King and Prince.

For this, I deny I did ever encroach upon the Lord Chamberlaines Office, or
that I preferred any such Chaplains in ordinary to the King or Prince, neither
is there any proof that they were preferred by me; as for Doctor Heylin he was
preferred by the Earl of Danby, Doctor Cosins by the Archbishop of York,
Doctor Baker by the Bishop of London, Doctor Pocklington and the rest, by I
know not whom; as for Doctor Weeks he was none of my Chaplain, but the Bishop
of Londons, and by him preferred.

To which was replied, First, that Master Oldsworth expressly deposed, and the
Earl of Pembroke himself averred the contrary, that he encroached on the Lord
Reply.
Chamberlaines Office, and preferred these Chaplains to the King. Secondly,
that many of them were his own Chaplains, therefore doubtless specially
recommended to the King by himself, and no other. Thirdly, the King entrusting
him with all Ecclesiastical affairs and preferments, no man else but himself
could prefer any to be Chaplains to the King, but by his approbation or
assistance first obtained; yea, no other person durst encroach upon the Lord
Chamberlaines Office in this kind but he. Fourthly, we shall prove Doctor
Weeks to be his own Chaplain, by a Catalogue of his Chaplains, written with
his own hand, affixed to the end of his Diary, which was produced and read; in
which Catalogue Doctor Weeks his name was found Registered among others of his
Chaplains; therefore his impudency and falsehood in denying it, was most
intolerable: Hereupon the Archbishop being so confounded, that he could not
deny it; confessed he was his Chaplain, but he had quite forgotten it, by
reason he lived at London-house, and was that Bishops household Chaplain, which
the Commons Counsel said, was a very poor excuse for so palpable, so gross
an untruth, averred with so much confidence.

The fourth thing Here p. 359.
objected against me is, my preferring of Arminians, and persons popishly
affected, in the Universities; as Doctor Jackson and others in Obje. 4.
Oxford, Doctor Martin in Cambridge, and Master Chapple in Ireland.

I answer; First, that Doctor Jackson was a learned man, and honest, and for
ought I know orthodox. Secondly, Doctor Martin was my household Chaplain Answer,
for a time, but not known to me to be an Arminian. Thirdly, Master Chapple
had a great name in the University of Cambridge for a great Scoller, which made
me prefer him; what he did maintain in Ireland is but by hearsay, since I
preferred him, and there was no complaint ever made to me against him, by
Doctor Hoyle or any other.

To which was replied; First, that he answered not to the maine charge, against
him, in making ill Vice-Chancellours as well as Heads of houses in Oxford:
Reply.
To that to which he offers an answer, we give this Reply; that Doctor Jackson
was a professed Arminian, though learned and honest, therefore no fit man to be
President of so famous a College as Corpus Christi. Secondly, that Doctor
Martin was a professed Arminian, and declared himself so by licensing Arminian
Books, and maintaining Arminian errous in his Sermon at Pauls-Crosse when he
was his own household Chaplain; all which was known and complained of to
himself; therefore unfit to be made Master of a College in Cambridge, or any
other of his strain, to which he gives no answer. Thirdly, that Master Chapple
had a great name in the University of Cambridge and in London is true, but it
was only for a most dangerous Arminian, who leavened the whole College
wherein he lived, and many of the University with his pestilent errors;
therefore a most unfitting man for him to make Provost and chief Governor of
the University and College in Dublin, where Doctor Hoyle expressly deposes,
that he broached not only Arminian, but dangerous Popish Errors, of which it
was in vain to complain to the Archbishop, who advanced and countenanced him
herein.

The fifth Pa. 359, 360
objection is, my encroachment upon the Lord Keepers and Master of the Wards
Rights, of presenting to the Kings livings, with my preferment of Object. 5.
diverse Arminians, and persons popishly affected to Prebendaries and Benefices
of best value; as Doctor Heylin, Doctor Weeks, Doctor Baker, Doctor Bray,
Doctor Heywood, and others.

To this I answer; First, that I encroached not upon either of their rights:
True it is, there being a difference between the Lord Keeper Coventry and the
Lord Answer.
Cottington, Master of the Court of Wards, about the presentation toward
livings in the Kings gift; I took occasion thereupon to inform his Majesty,
that till the controversy were decided between them, he might do well to
dispose of these livings himself, for the encouragement and reward of such
young Scholars that went to Sea as Chaplains in his Ships, who had nothing to
live on after their return from Sea, till they went forth again; which motion
the King approving of very well, committed the disposing of these livings
accordingly to my charge, without my desire or suit. Secondly, I disposed of
livings to diverse good and orthodox men, as to Doctor Jackson of Canterbury,
and others, as well as to the persons objected, who were not all preferred by
me; for Doctor Heylin was promoted to his livings by the Earl of Danby, Doctor
Baker and Doctor Weeks were preferred by the Bishop of London.

To which was replied; First, that most of the living belonging to the Lord
Keeper, and Master of the Wards, were bestowed by him, of which both of them
often Reply.
complained; therefore he encroached upon both, which none of his Predecessors
did: For those belonging to the Mastership of the Wards, he confesses he
disposed of them by the Kings appointment, but that it was upon the pretended
occasion, without his seeking or desire (though occasioned only his motion) we
know not how to credit his bare word, without better evidence, who has had the
impudency to deny his own handwriting very often since his Trial, and
afterward been enforced to confess it. Secondly, his collation of Livings
upon orthodox good men are so few, that he names but one [Doctor Jackson of
Canterbury] and that when he had so far prevailed upon his weakness, by a
new Cathedral Statute and Oath, as to induce him to Bow to the Altar, etc. as
frequently as other Prebends (which he has deposed) to his great shame, and
re-greet since; this one Swallow therefore will prove no Spring, no proof of
his ordinary preferring orthodox godly men to livings, which he commonly
bestowed on the most rotten Arminians and popish Clergymen he could cull out.
Thirdly, the Docquet Book is express, that Doctor Heylin was promoted to his
livings and Prebendary by himself, not by the Earl; that Doctor Baker and
Weeks too were preferred by him, not by the Bishop of London; and Weeks being
his own Chaplain, and Baker made a Prebend of Canterbury (where no man durst
interpose but he) no doubt they were both preferred by him, as the DOCQUET
witnesses on Record, against his impudent Denial, without other proof or
truth.

The fixed Objection is, that I usurped to me the conferring of most Bishoprics
and Ecclesiastical preferments in Ireland. Objection 6.


I answer; first, that I preferred none there, but at the request of the
Primate of Armagh, and others of that Kingdom, who first recommended them to
me Answ.
by their Letters. Secondly, that I was a means, at their request, to recover
the Patrimony of the Churches in that Kingdom, which had been long defrauded
of it; to restore Impropriations, and increase the Revenues of Bishoprics and
Church Livings there, for the encouragement of Learning, and better maintenance
of Preaching; in which regard, they were desirous I should be acquainted with
the persons they thought meet to have recommended to them. This appears by the
substance of most of the Letters that passed between the Lord Primate and other
Bishops of Ireland and me.

To which was replied: First, that we instanced in his bestowing Bishoprics,
Deaneries and other Church-preferments in Ireland, only to demonstrate the
Reply.
Papal usurpation, and Patriarchicall Jurisdiction he there encroached even
whiles he was Bishop of London; and to evidence his power in disposing of all
Ecclesiastical preferments then at home, since he disposed of these in Ireland,
where he had no Episcopal or Archiepiscopall Jurisdiction. Secondly, that most
of those he there preferred, were never recommended from thence, though some of
them perchance were. Thirdly, that although the recovery of the usurped
depopulated Patrimony of that Church in Ireland was a commendable work, if
done in a Legal way; yet to recover it, per fas and nefas, as he did it, by
the mere arbitrary power of the Lord Deputy and Council Table there, by
oppressing, ruining, dispossessing men of what they had lawfully purchased
against their wills, without any consideration or legal proceeding, was a most
unjust and wicked act. Fourthly, justly to recover and get in Impropriations to
maintain Preaching, was a very good work; had this been his end; but
certainly this was but a mere pretense; for would he, think you, set up
sincere Preaching in Ireland; who suppressed it all he could in England? Would
he who subverted the Feoffees for purchasing in Impropriations to the Church,
to support Preaching and Preaching Ministers in England, recover and get in
Impropriations to the Church in Ireland, to support Preaching and Preaching
Ministers there? No verily: He did it only to maintain the Pomp, Power,
Pride, State of the Prelates and Clergy there; as he did in England; not to
maintain, or set up godly Preaching Ministers, which he both here and there
suppressed all he could.

The fourteenth thing objected against me is, my prosecution and severe
proceedings Obje. 14.
against godly Ministers, for Preaching against Arminianisme, Popery, and its
dangerous increase among us; as namely against Master Samuel Ward, Master
Chauncy and Master Bernard.

To this I answer; first, that these persons Censures were the Act of the whole
Answer.
High Commission (which is but one body aggregate, for whose Act no one
particular man is liable to be questioned, but the whole Court;) not mine alone
(as an Act of Parliament is the Act of both Houses, not of any particular
Member) who gave my voice always last, or last but one; and so could not sway
the Court with my opinion, not known to the Court till I delivered it, after
all had declared theirs. Secondly, that the Act of Parliament which lately
abolished the Star Chamber and High Commission has no retrospect to nullify
the Sentences given in them, but admits them good and valid in Law, not
subjecting the Judges who gave them to any punishment. Thirdly, their Sentences
appeared to me to be just, upon just grounds; and admit the Sentences or
Proceedings unjust, yet it is but a misdemenour in others of the Commissioners
that gave them; therefore no Treason in me. Fourthly, the Passages and Sermons
for which they were Sentenced were, partly Schismatic against the laudable
Ceremonies of the Church and the Kings Declaration; partly Seditious, to infuse
fears and jealousies of the increase of Popery into the peoples minds, and
casting aspersions upon the Governors of the Church; For Master Bernards
prosecution it was upon the Complaint of Doctor Cumber, Vice Chancellor of
Cambridge. Fifthly, for other Ministers that were questioned, or fled from hence
to New England; they were Non-conformists, questioned upon just complaints; and
most of them fled hence, out of a consciousnesse of guilt or of a panick fear,
before they were questioned or pursued.

To this was replied; first, that we Exodus, 23. 2.
must not follow a multitude to do evil; and Reply.
injustice done by a whole Court, is a greater crime in every particular person
who votes or concurres in it, then if he had done an act of Injustice alone;
because more dangerous, more inexcusable, a greater perverting of Justice;
Psalm. 94. 20. to 24.
framing of mischief by a Law, and making the very throne of Justice, a throne
of wickedness: Yea, since the injustice of the whole Court flows from the
injustice of each particular Members vote, and is the Act of each particular
man who concurres in, or consents to it, he may no doubt be justly censured for
it; and others concurrence with him will be no excuse. If twenty men join in a
Treason, Felony, or Trespass, See Stanfords Pleas, l. 1. c. 44. 45.
any one of them may by Law be severally arraigned and condemned for it, as
well as all of them together: We have a notable President to prove this in the
Judges censured and condemned in Parliament in King Richard the seconds time,
for delivering their opinions contrary to Law against the Members of
Parliament, and in the Judges questioned, impeached this present Parliament for
their false Judgment given in the case of Ship Money; who might have pleaded
as well as the Archbishop, each for himself, the judgment we gave in these
cases was the Act and Judgment of the whole Bench; therefore we ought not to
be severally impeached for it; but none of them were so inconsiderate, as to
make such a childish plea, which himself refused to admit in the
High Commission in the case of the men of Gloucester, censured for granting an
Annuity to Master Workman their Minister, under the City Seal; an Act of the
whole Corporation; yet they were there Sentenced for it in their natural
capacities, as single men. And if this Plea should be admitted, no corrupt
Judges in any Court of Justice should be severally proceeded against for any
illegal Judgment or proceedings of the Court, which would be the very bane of
public Justice, and encourage ill Judges to do what they list. Secondly, the
objected Act of Parliament leaves the Judgments of both Courts as it found
them, neither better nor worse; and the Judges that gave them in the same
condition as before, not in a better. If the Judgment be unjust, it leaves both
them and the Judges, as far forth liable to examination, repeal, censure, as
formerly; as appears by diverse of them now questioned in Parliament for unjust
Sentences therein given. Thirdly, the Proceedings, Sentences against these
persons were certainly most unjust, being only for Preaching necessary Truths;
and that which is but a Misdemeanour in others, simply considerated as a single
offense; may prove high treason in him, being conjoynedwith, and done in
pursuit of his other Treasonable practices to subvert Religion, Laws,
Liberties, introduce popery and an arbitrary tyrannical government, which we
have fully manifested. Fourthly, the passages for which they were censured,
were neither scismatical nor seditious, nor scandalous, but necessary for those
secure times, to mind the people of the dangerous covert increase of popery,
Arminianisme, and undermining of our Religion, which all now visibly discern,
but few then observed; and to ruin godly Ministers for discharging their
consciences, duties, in warning men of those dangers and speaking for the
safety of that endangered Religion, which we all profess, was a most unjust
and monstrous misdemeanour, especially in an Arch-prelat, who should have
encouraged, rewarded, advanced them for this their faithfulness: as for the
aspersions pretended to be cast upon the Governors of the Church therein, they
were in truth mere general censures, without particularizing of such who
justly deserved them: And it is no calumny, but a necessary duty for Ministers
to tell negligent or unfaithful Prelates of their duties, and reprehend them
for their supinesse when they are faulty, as well as other men. For Master
Bernard and the rest, they were prosecuted only by this Archbishops own
instigation: for all the passages and proceedings against them were found in
his study, endorsed with his own hand; he was the person to whom they made
their humble addresses though without relief, and the only inexorable enemy
they met with; their unjust censures therefore must rest principally on him, who
though he voted last in their condemnation, yet appeared first in their
prosecution, and pre-directed their censures in private, before they were given
in open Court. Fifthly, all the forementioned godly Ministers were unjusty
molested by him, and few fled from hence, but such who were actually prosecuted
or threatened with ruin ere they left the Kingdom; most of them being then
conformable to all Rites and Ceremonies by Law established in our Church,
though not to his popish Innovations, Ceremonies, and Book of Sports, against
our Laws and their consciences too: This charge therefore still rests entirely
upon him, notwithstanding his evasions.

The fifteenth charge objected against me is, my endeavors, practices,
proceedings to suppress preaching, Lecturers, Lectures on Lords-dayes and
weekdays; Object. 15.
and that first, by a paper of Considerations which I tendered to the King.
Secondly, by Instructions extracted out of them, and sent as the Kings, in his
name and authority to both the Archishops and all Bishops of the Realm, to be
put in strict execution; by color whereof many Lectures, Lecturers were
suppressed in my own Diocese of London, and in other Diocesses, especially by
Bishop Mountague, Bishop Wren, and Bishop Piece; as appears by their Articles
and proceedings. Thirdly: orders for Combination Lectures. Fourthly, the Kings
Letters that none should be ordained without a Title. Fifthly, the silencing of
Master Leigh and others by my own direction and Letters signed by me. Sixthly,
by suppressing the Feoffees for Impropriations, alleged to be my act and
project.

To this I answer; first, that these Considerations were originally drawn by
Bishop Harsnet, not me, who only transcribed them out of his Copy. Secondly,
that these Instructions of the King were before I was made Archbishop, and were
sent unto me by my Predecessor in the Kings name to be put in execution in my
Diocese; whereupon I was bound in duty to see them executed, being good and
necessary; the intent of them being principally to bring all Lecturers to
conformity, to suppress single Lecturers where there were Preaching Ministers,
to preserve peace between the Minister and people, betwixt whom Lecturers in
many places made great contentions, alienating the peoples affections from
their Ministers person, Ministry, and raising diverse Schisms, to the
disturbance of the Churches peace. As for the Articles, Proceedings and
Misdemeanors of Bishop Wren, Bishop Mountague and Bishop Pierce, they are
nothing to me; they must answer for themselves. Thirdly, the Orders for
Combination Lectures were none of mine, and tended only to bring men to
conformity. Fourthly, the Kings Letter, that none should be made without a
Title, was to prevent unworthy Ordinations, agreeable to ancient Canons, and no
harm therein. Fifthly, for Master Leigh, I received many complaints against
him, that he was a scismaticall and seditious person, whereupon I writ thus to
my Vicar general; If you can fasten any thing on him, whereby he may be justly
censured, then to proceed against him, and he finding just cause did suspend
him for his nonconformity; so as in this I did but discharge my duty, and
deserve no blame. Sixthly, as to the Feoffees for impropriations, there was
great complaint made to me against them, that their end was to take away the
right of patronages from the Church to make those Ministers they preferred
independent on the Bishops, and dependent wholly on them, and to engrosse most
Ecclesiastical preferments into their own hands, which I conceiving to be true
in it self, and that it would prove mischievous to the Church, did thereupon
by the Kings command, cause an Information to be exhibited against them, in a
legal way, in the Exchequer; where upon a full and fair hearing, they were
suppressed, not by me, but by the Judges of that Court, who gave sentence
against them; which sentence was either legal or illegal, just or unjust; if
just and legal, then there was no wrong nor injustice at all done in the case,
and so no cause of accusation or complaint against me, or those who gave it; if
illegal and unjust, the Judges who gave the sentence must answer for it, not
I, who prosecuted them only in a legal way, and left them to judge according
to Law and Justice: Besides, some of the profits of the purchased
impropriations, were bestowed toward the maintenance of Lecturers at Saint
Antholins, contrary to the trust and intention, and Parsons not wholly
conformable to the Church of England were put into some of them; therefore I
conceived that I did but my duty in questioning and suppessing them as I did:
For Doctor Heylins Sermon, it concerns not me, he spoke therein of the
Feoffees, according as he conceived of them, and if any thing be mistaken he
must answer for it: As for Master Foxly, I did only check him for his
forwardness in this work, which I conceived would prove mischievous to the
Church.

To which was replied; First, that the original draught of these
Considerations was produced under his own hand; that it was but a transcript
out of Bishop Reply.
Harsnets Copy, the original Author of them, is but his own bare surmise,
without any proof or color: But admit Harsnet first contrived them, yet he
was the only man that presented them to the King, and caused them to be put in
execution, to the suppression of Lecturers, Lectures, preaching; therefore the
mischief produced by them must rest on him alone. Secondly, it is true, the
Instructions were sent to him by his Predecessor Abbot, as from the King; but
we have proved, that himself first procured, contrived, presented them to the
King, to be put in execution, and caused the King to send them to Archbishop
Abbot, to communicate them to all the Bishops of his Province; and so zealous
was he in the pursuit of them in his own Diocese of London, that he
suppressed many Lectures and Lecturers by color of them; yea, such was his
activity in their original contrivance and subsequent execution, that the
Deane and Chapter of Canterbury certified all their proceedings on them, not to
Archbishop Abbot, but to him, being then but Bishop of London, and complained
to him of the Archbishops remissness in seeing them duly executed in such sort
as they desired, as we have fully manifested: Therefore all the mischief in
suppressing of Lectures and preaching, by means or color of them, must light
upon his head, the original contriver and chief prosecutor of them; yea, all
Bishop Wrens, Bishop Mountagues, and Bishop Pierces Visitations Articles, and
suppressions of preaching, Lecturers and Lectures, must be attributed to and
charged upon him, because they originally sprang from these Injunctions of his
contrivance; because he was acquainted with, and countenanced, approved them in
all their wicked proceedings, of which they gave a particular annual account
to him in writing, found in his Study under their own hands, and never checked
but animated them in their persecutions, suppressions of godly Ministers,
Lectures, Preaching, Et qui non prohibet malum quod potest, jubet, is the very
resolution of the Canon Law. Thirdly, the Orders for Combination Lectures,
tending to suppress or make them merely superstitious or ceremonial useless
Ordinances, though not made immediately by him, did yet spring originally from
him, were sent up to, and not revoked, but approved by him, and Sir John Lamb
his creature, and no Bishops durst to have made or enjoined them without his
previous approbation or direction; therefore he must bear the blame and guilt
of them. Fourthly, for the Kings Letter touching Ordination of Ministers, we
have proved it to be his own (the Original thereof being penned, corrected by
himself) not the Kings, whom he overreached, abused in it: For though the
pretense and letter of it seemed very fair and necessary, yet the intention
and execution of it by the Archbishop, was most impious, detestable, to
suppress Lecturers, Lectures, Preaching, and deter all pious, conscientious
Scholars from the Ministry, as we have plentifully manifested, to which he
has offered no reply; nor yet to his pressing of the Book of Sports, for the
like purpose. Fifthly, for his silencing Master Leigh and others Lecturers, his
answer is very defective, since he cannot prove him factious or scismaticall,
nor yet Master Randall, they being known to be orthodox and conformable: The
only crime they were guilty of was, that they were diligent, painful
Preachers, and did much good among the people; and therefore his Letter
concerning Master Leigh is positive, That if nothing can be fastened on him,
whereby he may be censured; HOWEVER let him not obtain any license to Lecture
there, etc. for the Sea here p. 381.
Church has not need of such men: And Master Randalls fault was only this,
that he preached long Sermons on Sundays in the afternoon, and for this they
must be and were suspended from preaching. Sixthly, for the Feoffees to purchase
in impropriations, it was a most pious work, to the great benefit of the Church
and peoples souls, approved generally by the worst of men and Bishops; that
the overthrow of it was his own act and design, we have undeniably proved it
by his own DIARY, and sundry witnesses from his own mouth; that any ever
complained to him thereof as dangerous to the Church, is but his own bare
allegation, void of truth; he naming neither the persons complaining, nor the
time of their complaint: That it would introduce a Ministry independent on the
Bishops, is a false surmise, since none were recommended to officiate or preach
at any of the purchased Impropriations, but by special license of the Bishops
in whose they were, and none were presented to them but conformable men, free
from all just exceptions, and if he could justly except against ought in their
proceedings, Master White deposes, he offered that he himself should rectify
it, so as the work might proceed; but this would not content him, but they must
be suppressed and criminally proceeded against: That he did it in a legal way,
is no justification nor excuse, since those who work and accomplish mischief
by color of Law, are worse then open Tyrants: For the sentence, no doubt it
was most unjust, and so the Earl of Dorset, who was present at it, told the
King himself, affirming the buying in of Impropriations to be the best work
that ever was set on foot, for the Churches good; his own beging the
Impropriations in Ireland from the Crown, for the pretended good of the
Church, proves it infallibly against himself: But that the Judges only must
answer for this unjust sentence, not he, is a mere Nonsequitur; because the Law
resolves, that Plus peccat Author quam Actor; and the Judges had never given
such an unjust sentence in this cause, had not he by his violence, power,
fraud, interressing the King himself against the Feoffees, overawed, swayed
the Judges to swarve from the rules of Piety and Justice: That some of the
revenues of purchased Impropriations were contributed toward the maintenance
of Saint Antholins Lecturers, is true; but that it was a mis-imploying by them
contrary to trust, or that any unworthy or unconformable Ministers were put
into them, is a gross falsehood, disproved by Master White upon Oath: However,
had it been true, he should then have reformed the abuse, not utterly destroyed
the good work, so much conducing to Gods glory, and the peoples edification:
For Heylins Sermon, it was presented to, retained, approved, yea himself
advanced by him, and no doubt he preached it by his direction: As for Master
Foxly, he did not only check, but persecute, imprison, and most barbarously
handle him to his undoing, only for his promoting this pious project, even
after he had quite overthrown it, and openly vaunted of this his wickedness:
All which considered, each branch of this charge sticks most immovably upon
him, notwithstanding all his evasions to shake it off.

The sixteenth charge urged against me is, That I have endeavored to cause
division and discord between the Church of England and other reformed Churches,
Obje. 16.
and endeavored to suppress the Privileges and Immunities of the reformed
Dutch and French Churches in this Kingdom; wherein it was objected: First,
that I esteemed them no Churches of God or Christ at all, because they ^^nted
Bishope which they endeavored to prove by mine own Conference with Fisher,
Bishop Hals Propositions, approved by me, and Bishop Mountagues Book,
authorized by my Chaplain. Secondly, that I deemed their Religion and ours not
to be one, but different, and their Religion not to be the true Religion: Upon
which ground I grew angry with Master Ruly, and caused the Letters Patent
granted by the King for a Collection for the Palatinate Ministers, to be
revoked after they had passed the great Seal, and a clause in them to be
expunged, to their great injury and scandal, as Master Wakerly and Master
Hartlib attested. Thirdly, that I caused the Declaration of the Faith and
Ceremonies of the Pals(...) Church to be called in and suppressed. Fourthly,
That I molested the DUTCH, FRENCH and WALLOONE reformed Churches in England
sundry years, and infringed their ancient Privileges by my Injunctions in
diverse particulars.

To this I answer in general, that I deny both the Charge and Article, and
that I have endeavored to promote and preserve peace between the Protestant
Answ.
Churches abroad, and encouraged Master Dury, who was employed to make a
reconciliation between the Calvinists and Lutherans beyond the Seas, as I could
evidence by sundry of his Letters; therefore I had a good affection to these
Churches, and no intent to make any discord between them: To the objected
particulars I answer;

First, that in my Conference with Fisher, I cite only St Jeroms words, to
prove a difference in order and degree, between a Bishop and ordinary
Presbyter, and infer from his words, as his opinion, not mine; so even with
him, no Bishop, no Church. But it has been objected, that Bish. Mountagues
Book determines expressly, that there can be no Church without Bishops, nor
Ministers but such who are ordained by Diocesian Bish. distinct from an
ordinary Minister, and that no Minister (no not in case of necessity) can be
ordained by any other; therefore the foreign Protestant Churches, which have
no such Bishops, and their Ministers, being not ordained by Bishops, but other
Presbyters, can be no Churches nor Ministers: I answer, that this Book and
opinion of his concerns not me, being none of mine but the Authors: Yea, but I
maintained and approved the same opinion in effect in Bishop Hals Propositions
touching Episcopacy, to which I endeavored to procure a general subscription,
pressing it upon others; and therein I determine, That there was no Church of
Christ upon earth ever since the Apostles times governed otherwise then by
Bishops; and that this government is unalterable, and ought to be perpetuated
in the Church to the end of the world: Which does wholly unchurch all the
reformed Churches, and resolve them to be no Churches of Christ. I answer, that
these Propositions were sent me by Bishop Hall, of his own accord, that what I
did in them was by his consent, neither were any pressed to subscribe them, nor
they propounded concludingly: And though Episcopacy be not alterable, yet it
may be regulated: That it is unalterable, Bishop Bilson has proved it long
since, it continuing so in all Churches at least fifteen hundred years after
Christ, and is allowed, approved by the Book of Ordination; yea Master Calvin
himself on that of John, As my Father sent me, so send I you, acknowledges
the perpetuity of Bishops in the Church.

Secondly, I deny that I esteem the Reformed Churches Religion and ours not to
be the same; true it is, we and they differ in some particular points of
Doctrine as well as in Discipline; but this makes us not wholly to differ in
Religion, nor did I deny their Religion to be true: As for Master Ruly, I used
him very civilly with all respect, and promoted the Collection for the
Palatinate all I could, having received a Letter from the Queen of Bohemia for
that purpose: True it is, I caused the objected clause in the first Patent of
the Collection to be altered, but it was by the Kings direction, who gave order
for it, upon my acquainting him therewith; and I conceive there was ground
enough to do it: First, because some of the Palatinate Divines (as Paraus upon
the Romans) differed from our Church in some points of Doctrine touching the
Kings Supremacy, concurring therein with the Papists;) for which his Book was
here publicly condemned, burnt, and likewise in some other points,) therefore
it could not be properly said that their Religion and ours was the same in all
particulars: Secondly, it seemed to determine a great controversy between
Protestant Divines among themselves, and likewise between them and the Church
of Rome; whether the Pope be Antichrist? which was never yet determined by any
Council, and of which there is great doubt and difference in opinion even
among the learned: Now I conceived it a very unfitting thing to determine such
a doubtful controversy definitively by Letters. Patents under the great
Seal, which is not yet resolved in the Schools. Upon these grounds the King
thought fit to revoke the Patent, though it were under the Great Seal, which I
had no power to recall, but the KING only.

Thirdly, I deny that I called in the Declaration of the Palsgraves Religion,
neither do I rememeber any such thing: Fourthly, it is true, that I questioned
the Dutch and Walloone Churches, but not for any ancient Privileges, but only
for their encroachments beyond their privileges, to the prejudice of our
English Churches and Parishes wherein they lived; yet my Injunctions and
proceedings toward them in this kind, were so fair and just, that they rested
satisfied with them, and returned me special thanks for my favor toward them
and their Congregations; therefore I much mervaile that this my carriage should
be so much blamed, as to make it a CAPITAL CRIME and CHARGE against me.

To this was replied in the general, that the premised proofs, with his late
military proceedings against the Scots, for complying with those Churches in
Reply.
their Doctrine, Discipline, Government, sufficiently evidence his enmity to,
his opposition against those foreign Protestant Churches, because they had no
Bishops; insomuch that he blamed Bishop Hall for dealing so mildly with them in
his Book for Episcopacy, which he submitted to his censure, where on the
contrary he is so zealous of the Popes honor, that he could not but complain
to the King of some harsh passages in it, bestowing the Title of Antichrist on
his Holiness, and procured a special command from his Majesty to the Bishop
to expunge them, to gratify the Pope; yea, his purging out the objected clause
in the Kings Patent, and suppressing of the Declaration of Palatinate Churches
Faith and Religion, argues little affection in him to those Churches, and much
inward rancour against them, but a very high esteem of Rome: As for his
encouraging of Master Dury in his design of reconciling the Calvinists and
Lutherans, Master Dury undertook this work without his privity or advice, and
found so small encouragement from him, that he often complained thereof to his
friends, as we are credibly informed.

To the particulars we reply; First, that in his Conference with Fisher, he
does not recite, but misrecite and pervert Saint Jeroms words and opinion; who
dogmatically resolves in his very Epistle to Evagrius, which this Archbishop
quotes, and elsewhere; That Bishops and Presbyters Jure Divino, are both one and
the same, as well in Jurisdiction as Office, and that Presbyters have the power
of Ordination as well as Bishops: Therefore his appropriating of the word
Sacerdos and Jeroms saying, Vbi non est Sacerdos non est Ecclesia; to Diocesian
Bishops, which he clearly means of Priests and Ministers in general, is a
gross perverting of Jeroms meaning; and his inferene thence: So even with him,
NO BISHOP and NO CHVRCH, is only a Declaration of his own private opinion, not
of Jeroms, who held no such Prelaticall Paradox: For Bishop Mountagues Book, it
was licensed by his Chaplain, presented to, received, approved by himself:
Bishop Hals Propositions were not only interlined with, but allowed under his
own hand, as fit for a general subscription, and now he justifies them not
only by Bishop Bilsons opinion, but likewise by Master Calvin's, as great an
enemy to Bishops as Saint Jerome, whose words he wilfully perverts as he did
his, in applying that to Diocesian Bishops, which he spoke only of ordinary
Ministers, who succeeded the Apostles in their Ministerial Function: In
brief, his own Conference, together with Mountagues Book, and Bishop Hals
Propositions, approved by him, do necessarily unchurch all the reformed
Protestant Curches, un-minister all their Ministers, and make them no Churches
no Ministers of Christ; whereas he averres the Church of Rome to be a true
Church, and her Priests to be true Ministers, as we have formerly proved;
therefore he must needs be guilty of the extremest malignity and anmity
against them, what ever he pretends to the contrary.

Secondly, he denies, and yet at last justifies and maintains what we charge
him with, to wit, that he denies the Religion of foreign Protestant Churches
to be the same with ours, or to be true Religion; and he instanceth in the
opinion of Paraeus, whose Commentary on the Romans he caused to be burnt as
erroneous, when as he writes no more then Bilson did before him (whom himself
has cited in defense of Episcopacy) and other orthodox Writers of our Church
have maintained publicly for truth before and since: As for the burning of
Paraus his Book, being of a foreign Nation and no Subject to our King, without
summoning him to defend himself, it was an unjust, rash, inconsiderate action,
to say no more, as his Son has manifested to the world in print, who has
justified his Fathers opinion to the full, as orthodox: However, the
extravagant opinion of one Palatinate Divine, in point only of the Kings
Supremacy (not about any Article of Faith) cannot make the reformed Churches
and ours to be of different Religions, especially since he argues in his
Star Chamber Speech, that the Papists Religion and ours are both one, though we
differ in some private Tenets: Yea, his denial of the Protestants Religion in
foreign parts to be the true Religion, when as he contends that Rome is a
true Church, argues his virulency against the one, and good affection to the
other. Thirdly, the calling in of the Declaration of the Palsgraves Religion,
is directly and punctually proved to be his act; its impudency therefore in him
to deny it, and policy not to remember it. Fourthly, for the purgation and
revocation of the Letters Patent, he not only confesses, but shamelesly
justifies it (most undutifully laying the blame, the scandal of it on the King
himself, who did naught therein but by his instigation) and that upon two
false, scandalous grounds: First, that the Religion of the foreign Palatinate
Churches and ours differ and are not the same: then which falsehood nothing can
procure a greater scisme and juster ground of scandal between us and those
Churches. Secondly, that no Council had defined the Pope to be Antichrist, of
which there was great variety of opinions amongst Protestant Divines touching
the same, unfit to be decided by the Kings Letters Patent. Therefore he purged
it out because it intimated the Pope to be Antichrist, and subjection to him an
Antichristian Yoke of bondage; both which compared with his Purgations out of
Bishop Hals Book of Episcopacy to the same effect) proves him a Papist with a
witness, and a special friend to the Popes Holiness, of whose honor among
us he is extraordinary tender: That the Pope is the Antichrist, all See here p.
276. to 279. Catalogus Testium veritatis
Foreign and Domestic Protestant Divines (and some Papists too) unanimously
agree, except Mountague and Shelford, his creatures: And whereas he pretends,
no Council has so determined: We answer, that the Sea Doctor Crakenthorp of
the Popes temporal Monarchy, p. 167.
Synod of Gape in France, Anno 1603. the whole Synod and Convocation in
Ireland, Ann. 1615. in the very Articles of their Religion, Number. 80. with the
whole Convocation and Parliament of England, in the Act for the Subsidy of the
Clergy, 30 Jacobi, to omit others, define the Pope to be the Antichrist, and
Popery Antichristian, more fully then those Letters Patent; and why these new
Letters Patent should not determine them to be such, as well as the old ones
both in King James and in King Charles their Reigns, but must now be revoked
after they had passed the great Seal of England, because this Archbishop would
have it so, transcends any man's capacity to guess at any other probable
reason, except only this Prelates affection both to the Pope and Popery, or
enmity against the reformed Churches and their Religion: For his incivilities
to Master Ruly by reason of this clause, our Witnesses testimonial will
outsway his bare denial of them. Fifthly, the premises abundantly manifest to
all, that the Archbishop invaded, diminished the ancient Immunities and
Privileges of the Dutch and Walloon Churches in all parts, not their pretended
encroachments only upon our Churches Privileges, and that he was so far
from being their friend, that they esteemed him then their greatest enemy: If
they formerly returned him any thanks (by way of Court-complement) for not
taking away all their privileges, as well as some of them, after many years
hot contest, we are certain they justly complained of him ten times more for
invading, depriving them of sundry of their ancient Immunities, which almost
brought their Churches to utter ruin: In few words, his own forecited Papers,
and Monsieur Bulteels Book of the manifold troubles of those Churches by this
Arch-Prelats prosecution, will abundantly falsify this his pretended
friendship toward them, and remain as a lasting Record against him to
Posterity. All which considered, the whole Bulk and every particle of all the
proofs and evidences produced by us to make good the first branch of the
Commons first general Charge of High Treason against him, remain altogether
unshaken, unavoyded, maugre all his sophistical evasions, protestations and
shifting answers to them. And so much for the first branch of his first
general Charge.

The Archbishops Defense and Answers to the COMMONS Evidence in the maintenance
of the Second Branch of their first General Charge, touching his Endeavors to
reconcile the Church of England to the Church of Rome, and the Commons Reply
thereunto.
I Proceed now to the Archbishops Defense against the Second Branch of the
Commons first General Charge; to wit, his Endeavors to reconcile the Church
Obje. 17.
of England to the Church of Rome.

To this he gave some general Answers in his General Defense at the Lords
Bar, September. 2. 1644. to this effect: My Lords (said he) I am charged for
endeavoring Answer.
to introduce Popery, and reconcile the Church of England to the Church of
Rome: I shall recite the sum of the Evidence and Arguments given in for to
prove it.

First, I have in my first Speech, nominated diverse persons of Eminency, whom I
reduced from Popery to our Church. And if this be so, then the Argument against
me is this; I converted many from Popery, Ergo, I went about to bring in
Popery, and to reconcile the Church of England to the Church of Rome.

Secondly, I am charged to be the Author of the, etc. Oath in the New Canons,
parcel of which Oath is to abjure Popery, and that I will not subject the
Church of England to the Church of Rome. (A more strict Oath then ever was made
against Popery in any age or Church.) And then the argument against me is this;
I made and took an Oath to abjure Popery, and not to subject the Church of
England to the Church of Rome. Therefore I was inclinable to Popery, and
endeavored to subject the Church of England to the Church of Rome.

Thirdly, the third Canon (of the late New ones) was made by me, which is
against Popery; and then the Argument is; I made a Canon against Popery; Ergo,
I was inclinable to, and endeavored to introduce it.

Fourthly, I was twice seriously offered a Cardinalship, and I refused it;
because I would not be subject to the Pope and Church of Rome; Ergo, I was
addicted to Popery, and endeavored to reduce the Church of England into
subjection to the Church of Rome.

Fifthly, I writ a Book against Popery, in Answer to Fisher the Jesuit; and
then the Argument is this; I writ a Book against Popery; Ergo, I am inclinable
to Popery, and labored to introduce it.

Sixthly, it is alleged, I concealed and cherished the Plot of the Jesuits
discovered by Habernfeild; and therefore I intended to bring in Popery, and
reduce the Church of England to the Church of Rome. I amswer, either this Plot
was not real; and if so, then Romes Masterpeece is quite blown up, and
published in vain. Or else it was real, and then I was really in danger of my
life, for opposing Popery and this Plot. Then the Argument from it must be
this; I was in danger of my life for cherishing the Jesuits Plot of reducing
the Church of England to the Church of Rome; Ergo, I cherished and endeavored
to effect this Plot.

Seventhly, I labored to make a reconciliation between the Lutherans and
Calvinists; Ergo, I labored to introduce Popery, and make a reconciliation
between the Church of England and the Church of Rome.

This general defense and scoffing answer of his at the Lords Bar, seemed
very specious to some ignorant Auditors, who took these feined objections of
Reply.
his own forging, to be the arguments, and maine strength of the Commons
Evidence produced, to convict him of a serious endeavor to subvert the
Protestant Religion, introduce popery, and reconcile the Church of England unto
Rome; when as the Commons made no such objections from the Evidence and proofs
against him: Whereupon they replied, that he did but fight with his own shadow,
and absurd arguments of his own framing (as he did in his Sear-chamber Speech)
instead of repeating and answering their real Objections and proofs against
him, transforming his own defense into their Charge and Evidence; a mere
sophistical, Jesuiticall practice, of which he made use throughout his Trial,
to which we shall reply in order.

First, the Commons never objected, that ever he reduced any from popery, but
that many were seduced to, and hardened in it by his means: Their Objection
being; He was a means of seducing many to, and obdurating thousands in popery,
by his introducing popish Doctrines, Innovations, Ceremonies, etc. Ergo, he
went about to bring in popery, and reduce us back to Rome: That he reduced any
from popery, is but his own bare allegation in his first Speech and general
Defense, without any proof at all, but his own bare word, which the Commons
denied; himself confessing, that some of the eminentest of them presently
relapsed after their conversion, and lived and dyed Papists: See then the
falsehood and fallacy of this mis-repeating Sophister, in the very first
entrance and principal argument of his general Defense.

Secondly, to his second and third arguments we retort; That the Commons never
gave in evidence against his making or imposing the etc. Oath, or third new
Canon, to prove him guilty of introducing popery, or endeavoring to reconcile
us to Rome, but to two other different purposes, which he wholly pretermits;
therefore his two arguments from them, as the Commons own, are mere forgeries,
impostures of his own: As for the etc. Oath, it has no such clause in it as
is pretended; indeed it has this clause, That I will not endeavor by my self
or any other directly or indirectly, to bring in any Popish Doctrine, contrary
to that which is established; which is but a mere pretense and policy, all or
most popish Doctrins and Ceremonies being introduced, licensed, established
among us when this Oath was made, as the premises evidence, and no Doctrine
being then esteemed Popish but what the Archbishop pleased, though truly such:
As for the third Canon, it enjoynes only private conference with popish
Recusants, and presentiments, excommunications of such of them who are
obstinate, and if they conform not, then that their names shall be presented
to the Judges of the Assi^e, which is no more then other Can. 63.
Canons formerly enjoined to no purpose or (...) at all, and was but a mere
State Policy to stay the present elamours of the people and Scots against the
Prelates, for their connivance at popery and confederacy Can. 65, 66.
with Papists, against those they styled Puritans, and a thing not really
intended, but pretended only.

Thirdly, his fourth, fifth and fixed arguments are of the same nature, mere
Chimeraes of his own forging, which he would father on the Commons, who
pressed these particulars against him in a far other manner, to which he gives
no answer: His refusing of a Cardinals Cap, was only because he desired to be
an absolute independent Patriarch and Pope within the Kings Dominions: His Book
against Fisher was published in his own name upon entreaty of others, only to
blind the world, and stop the clamours against him, in making them believe
thereby he was no friend to Papists or popery, when as we have proved the
contrary out of that and other of his books. To that of Habernfield we shall
answer in due season; some deeming it only a forgery or plot of his own
devising to justify himself, others a real truth.

Fourthly, his seventh argument is a most wilful perversion of the Commons
charge, who expressly impeach him for endeavoring to cause division and discord
between our own and other reformed Churches, that so Papists might have the
more advantage; which we have abundantly proved. And he makes the charge to be,
that he endeavored a reconciliatiou between the Lutherans and Calvinists (of
which good act he was never guilty in the least degree, for ought he makes
appear, but of the quite contrary) Ergo, to reconcile the Church of ENGLAND to
the Church of ROME.

By which strange prevarication and Jesuiticall sophistry, the world may
clearly discern, the sophistry, fallacy, and apparent Legerdemaine of this his
general Defense, and impertinency of his Answers, encountering only his own
ridiculous fictions, not the Commons real Objections.

Having recited these his general Answers, we shall pursue him to his
particular evasions to the evidence and proofs produced, to make good the
second Branch of his first general Charge, wherein he thus proceeded.

The first thing objected against me is, That I have ever been generally
reputed a Papist, or person popishly affected, both in the University of
Oxford, whiles resident Obje. 1. Page 409. to 415.
there, and ever since; as likewise in Rome and in other foreign parts; for
proof whereof, the testimonies of Doctor Featly, Sir Nathaniel Brent, Doctor
Abbots Sermon, Doctor Hals Letter, Francis Harris his Deposition, with the
testimonies of Sir Henry Mildmay, Master Anthony Mildmay, and Master Thomas
Challoner have been produced.

To this I answer; First, that all these are but hear-sayes or reports, and no
Answer.
convincing Evidence, that I was really a Papist, or inclined unto popery:
Doctor Featlies testimony is but a report from one who said he was my Pupil,
and that at Paris many years since, in foreign parts: Sir Nathaniel Brents
testimony is but a report from Master Dale, of a thing long since, that my
supposition was taken out of Bellarmine, which I deny: His further testimony is
only this, That Brown, with whom I kept company, was but a reputed (not an
actual) Papist during his life, and what he subjoynes, that he was found to be
such a one after his death, is very consecturall; for it appears not that the
Book objected was of his own penning, though it were his handwriting, for it
might be a transcript: That I petitioned to King James, that I was traduced to
be a Papist, is true, and I had good reason so to do when I was thus traduced;
and upon my Petition, the business was referred to the examination of diverse
worthy persons, and I cleared upon full hearing by the King: For Doctor Abbots
Sermon, I complained of it, as I had cause, as being traduced by it; he was
known to be my enemy, and to do me wrong herein, therefore his words are not
to be valued in this case; nor Doctor Hals Letter to W. L. which might be to
some other as well as to me, who am not nominated therein: For Francis Harris
his testimony, I never knew nor saw the man to my knowledge, and it is but a
hearsay from one Ireland many years since, and that beyondthe Sea; for Ireland
himself I only knew, but had nofamiliar acquaintance with him.

Secondly, for Sir Henry Mildmayes testimony, it is only a bare rumor and
report from some persons at Rome, unknown both to me and him, purposely raised
by the Papists to blast or wound my reputation, and what he now attested is
quite contrary to that himself informed me at my Table at Lambeth, immediately
after his return from Rome, as I am ready to depose upon my corporal Oath, if
I may be permitted: His Brother Master Anthony Mildmay his testimony is but an
incertaine report from I know not whom at Rome, that I was somewhat more
favorable to their Religion then my Predecessors; and what he heard from
Father Fitton, is but his report, and a false one too, of purpose to slander
me, or deceive their Proselites there: For Master Challoners testimony, it is
but a report too, from I know not whom, and a discourse of others to him,
without any ground arising from me; and I have cause to fear, that what he
testified was merely out of spleen, and a mere engine to ruin me, because upon
complaint I caused him to be Committed for some high Offenses charged against
him, amounting to little less then Treason; to avoid which, he was enforced to
fly beyond the Seas, where he heard these reports concerning me, it we may
believe him; which are no evidence at all in Law.

To this the Commons replied; First, that though common fame be no convincing
Reply.
evidence of it self, yet in many cases both in common, Civil and Canon Law,
it is a good ground of suspicion, Deuteronomy. 13. 12, 13, 14. Josh: 22. 11, 12.
inquisition, accusation and apprehension too, especially if it be a general,
universal and long continued fame both abroad and beyond the Seas, as this is;
but being seconded with concurrent actions (as his) it is a most satisfactory
proof; and in such a case, vox populi, est vox Dei: Besides, himself gave the
occasion of this evidence, by his examining Sir Henry Mildmay, to know what
report they gave, and what opinon or repute they had of him at Rome when he was
there? Whether he were not the most odious man to them of any living, etc. If
the reports and common fame they heard of him at Rome were no evidence at all
to clear him, as he reputed it; why then did he produce Sir Henry, as a
principal witness for him, and examine him merely what report and repute he
had at Rome? If he conceived it good evidence to clear him, in case Sir
Henry's testimony had proved answerable to his expectation, then certainly it
must be as available to confirm and prove his guilt, yea Sir Henry's testimony
falling quite cross to what he pretended, must needs be far stronger against
him, then it could have been for him, had he testified what the Archbishop
pretended; because he is a witness of his own producing, and had been but a
single witness for him, but is seconded with two more concurrent testimonies
against him, even concerning the opinion they had of him in Rome it self,
which is backed with a general opinion of the same kind both among Papists and
Protestants too, who concurred in their judgments and reports concerning his
good affection to Popery, and endeavors to reconcile us to the Church of Rome:
Yea, as this good opinion and report concerning him was universal in all
places, both abroad and at home, so it is fortified by a public charge in
Parliament given in against him, by the two whole Kingdoms of England and
Scotland, and confirmed by so many pregnant evidences of all sorts, that it
must made be granted to be a most enforcing, convincing argument of his guilt;
the rather because himself gave the first occasion of this kind of euidenes:
For Doctor Featlies testimony, it is a report of one of the Archbishope own
Pupils, who have knew his opinions: Sir Nathaniel Brents testimony is upon his
own knowledge, ratified by the concurrent opinions of others, grounded upon
his popish supposition taken out of Bellarmine, his familiarity with Master
Brown a reputed Papist, Noscitur ex Comite: Upon his own confession in his
Petition, and the common fame of the University; that he was cleared upon his
Petition of this imputation he produces no evidence at all, neither mentions
he any particular time when, nor persons by whom he was cleared: For Doctor
Abbots Sermon, it is the clearest testimony in the world, that he was then
generally reputed a Papist in the University both by Protestants, and Papists,
and likewise in foreign parts, for which cause alone and no other, this
Doctor was his enemy: As for his complaint against it as injurious, it no way
extenuates nor takes off the common fame and reputation of being a Papist,
which Doctor Hals (...) (not denied by him to be written and meant of himself)
and Francis Harris his testimony second and confirm: Whereas he faith, he
never know nor saw this Harris, this invalids not his testimony, and his little
acquaintance in reallity, that he knew him, if not, (...) and in ^ute, by (...)
Fame and ^^putation, to be a Papist in heart opinion, and the only thing for
which are produce his testimony.

Secondly, for Sir Henry Mildmayes testimony, it is more then a bare report,
for he testifies on his own certain knowledge, that which the Archbishop
produced him to prove, what opinion the Jesuits, Priests and Popish^ ^ad of him
at Rome when he was there, together with the reasons of their opinions and
report; and he deposes the truth hereof quite contrary to what the Archbishop
suggested: whose Oath is not to be credited in his own case, to impeach Sir
Henry's testimony, fortified with two others concurring with it: The like we
answer to Captain Anthony Mildmayes and Master Challoners testimonies; they
both depose what opinions and reports the Popes Nuncio Con, Father Fitton,
Father Talbot, and other English Jesuits, Priests and foreign Papists had of
the Archbishops good affection to their Religion, and how isntrumental he was
to introduce Popery, and reduce us back to ROME, declaring punctually each
particular: Therefore their testimonies are all real, and no hear-sayes or
bare reports, as he pretends. As for Master Challoners pretended malice, it is
but a bare surmise, and being a Gentleman of quality and integrity, this poor
pretense is altogether insufficient to disparage his testimony upon Oath: The
rather, because the Archbishops endeavors to imprison and bring him into the
High Commission heretofore, was, only for speaking of the Priests and Jesuits
Plots to bring in Popery, and some of our Bishops compliance with them; the
party who complained against him, being both a Priest and Jesuit, now in
actual Arms against the Parliament, in the Kings Army, (as Master Challoner
deposed;) a great confirmation of the truth of his Testimony, and of the
Archbishops guilt. In few words, all these recited testimonies, what opinion
they had at Oxford heretofore, and at Rome, and other places since, of his
being a Papist, and confederating with them in their Design of introducing
Popery by inches, and reducing us back to Rome, compared with his preceding
practices, do fix this charge so fast upon him, that all his Sophistry or
Oratory cannot shake it off.

The second thing objected is this, That there was a dangerous Plot laid and
seriously pursued, to introduce Popery, and reconcile the Church of England
Object. 2.
to the Church of Rome, to which I was privy, and had certain notice of it,
yet I complied with it, and never labored to prevent it; which the Commons
labored to prove by diverse general instances: First, by the Spanish Match,
propounded to the King when Prince of Wales, and his sending over into Spain,
of purpose to pervert him in his Religion, as appears by the Articles of the
Treaty; the Popes Letters to the Prince and Bishop of Conchen when in Spain,
the Articles of the Duke of Buckingham against the Lord Digby, and the Lord
Digbies against him in full Parliament, Anno 1626. To which they Object I was
privy, because I was Confessor to the Duke, and his Cabinet Counsel at that
time, and because my Letter to Bishop Hall, my own Diary, and Letters to and
from the Duke, whiles in Spain, with the Note in my Mass Book discover and
confirm it: Secondly, by the French Match with the Queen promoted purposely to
usher in Popery, and to reconcile us unto Rome; to which they Object I was
privy and assistant, as my Letters to the Duke, my intimacy and compliance with
the Queen, my inhibitng Ministers to pray, and punishing them for praying for
the Queens conversion, my censuring of Master How for praying, That the young
Prince might not be brought up in Popery, with my magnifying of Queen Mary's
days, and depressing King Edwards and Queen Elizabeth's, demonstrate.

Secondly, by sundry particular instances; as First, Ludovicus a Sancta Maria
his Conclusiones Theologicae: Secondly, the Plot discovered to me by
Haberufield: Thirdly, the Dedicating of Fastidius his Works to the King by
Cardinal Barbarino: Fourthly, Sancta Clara his Deus, Natura, Gratia, writ of
purpose to reconcile us to Rome, with which I was acquainted, and maintained
the Author of it, Saint Giles, a most dangerous seducing Priest, in the
University of Oxford: Fifthly, the proffers of Cardinalships to English men,
and twice to my self: Sixthly, the strange increase and proceedings of
Papists, Priests, Jesuits, and the Popish Hierarchy in Ireland, to which I was
privy, yet denied it, and incensed the King, against the Commons for
complaining of it: Seventhly, the Popes sending of diverse Nuncioes successively
into England, where they resided, and were publicly entertained, with our
reciprocal sending and maintaining Agents at Rome, to work a Reducement of us
back to that Antichristian See.

To this I answer, First, that I was neither the Author nor Fomenter of the
Answer.
Spanish Match, nor of the Kings Voyage into Spain, which was charged on the
Duke and the Lord Dighy: It is true, my Lord Duke was pleased to enter into a
near familiarity with me, and to make me his Confessor, and that I writ Letters
to him into Spain, and received Letters from him thence; but this proves not
that I was privy to that Plot; as for the Popes Letters to the Prince and the
Bishop of Conchen in Spain, to pervert him in his Religion, they are nothing
to me, and my Letter to Bishop Hall, was many years after that Match broken off.

Secondly, there is no proof of my furthering the Match with France, or that
the end of it was to reduce us back to Rome; the respects and services I did
for the Queen, were no more then in civility and duty I ought to perform out
of the duty I bare to the King my Master, whose Consort and Wife she is; her
gracious favor toward me, proceeded only from her own gracious disposition,
not from my deserts or seeking; and I had no reason to reject it, because it
would be a means for me to work the more effectually upon her Majesty: For my
giving Order in my Metropolitical Visitation to my Visitor, to inhibit
Ministers to pray for the Queens conversion, or questioning any for praying for
it, I absolutely deny it; and for Master How, he was justly censured for his
prayer, it being scandalous to his Majesty in questioning his care of the
Princes education in the true Religion, and infusing jealousies into the
peoples heads, of his education in Popery, and inclination to it. As for my
pretended magnifying of Queen Mary's days, and depressing of King Edwards and
Queen Elizabeth's, in the Preface to the OXFORD STATUTES, I answer, that that
Preface is none of mine, nor proved to be so; and if it were, yet the words
relate to the State and Statutes of the University of Oxford only in their
days, not of our Church and Religion.

Secondly, to the particular Instances, I answer, that the first, second and
third of them concern not me: I was neither the cause, nor author of, nor
privy to them, nor could I hinder them, and the second of them is a strong
evidence for me; For the fourth of them, Sancta Clara his Book, it was printed
at Lions, not at London, and Saint Giles was not the Author of it, but another
Friar, I had no hand in it, nor was privy to it; yet it was disliked by many of
the Papists, because it gave much advantage to our Church and Religion: For his
being at Oxford, it was much against my will, by the Kings special Warrant,
for which I have his hand, and I maintained him not there, but the King. To the
fifth, the proffer of Cardinals Caps to others, is nothing to me; and for the
offer of a Cardinalship to my self two several times, as I could not hinder
the offers, so I rejected them, and acquainted the King both with the person
and thing, which is all I could do, expressing the cause of my refusal
thereof, to be, That something dwelt within me that would not suffer that till
Rome were other then it is, as appears by my own Diary: The strongest
Evidence that can be to acquit me from any compliancy with Rome. To the sixth I
answer, that the increase and proceedings of the Papists in Ireland, mentioned
in the Objected Letters and Papers, are nothing to me, I was not the cause nor
author thereof; the Monasteries and Nu^meries mentioned in them, were but poor
little houses; My answer to the Commons Remonstrance was penned by the Kings
special command, as appears by the endorsment, and I knew not of these Irish
papers, nor of the increase of popery there, when I returned an answer to the
Remonstr. An. 1628. these Proclamations, letters, papers being dated since that
time: for the Deputies letters they are nothing to me, I could not hinder the
writing and directing of them to me, and himself has already been impeached,
condemned for his Actions, for which I am not to answer. To the seventh I say,
it was not in my power to hinder the Popes sending his Nuncioes hither, which
the King condiscended to upon the Queens earnest desire, to accommodate and
satisfy her Majesty in some things which concerned her in her Religion. For
the Agents sent and residing in Rome they were hers, not mine, sent thither by
her Majesty without my privity, and against my liking.

To this was replied; First, that the forementioned Evidence fully demonstrats
Reply.
that the Archbishop was both privy, consenting, assisting to the Spanish
Match, Voyage, and to the very Instructions given to the Prince before he went
into Spain, how he ought to satisfy the Pope about King James his proving him
to be the Antichrist, in his public writings; therefore the Popes Letter to
the Prince and Bishop of Conehen, to pervert the Prince in his Religion; with
the Dukes and Lord Digbies attempts there, to seduce him to popery, and
reconcile our Churches and Kingdoms to Rome by this means (contained in their
mutual Articles of Impeachment, the Copies of which Letters and Articles were
found in his own Study by Master Prynne) must needs concern him, since he
could not be ignorant, that the Pope and his Instruments would use their utmost
diligence to seduce the Prince to their Religion, when they had him thus sent,
and betrayed into their power for that very purpose; and his Letter to Bishop
Hall, though written but of late, long after that intended Match, yet fully
relates his privity to the most secret Instructions before it, to gratify and
please the very Pope himself, and prevent his Objections against the Match, or
King James. For the French Match, the Evidence proves he was both privy,
consenting and assisting to it, even after he knew the danger of it in point of
Religion, both to the King and Kingdom, by the proceedings and Articles in the
Spanish Treaty, being both the very same in substance; whereas his intimacy,
power with the King, Duke, and quality of his place as he was a Bishop, yea
Confessor to one or both of them, should have engaged him (had he been a real
Protestant) to have used his utmost endeavors to dissuade the King and Duke
from both these Popish Matches, as most perilous, destructive to our Religion;
the sad effects whereof we now visibly behold in our civil wars, and read In
Characters written with our own blood. For his intimacy with the Queen, it
favors of far more then civility or duty, and her extaordinary favors to
him proceeded from no other cause, but his compliance with her Majesty to
introduce popery, and reduce us back to Rome, as appears by his proceedings
against Master Gellibrand in the High Commission for his Almanac (wherein the
popish Saints were expunged, and our Martyrs inserted) at her Majesty's
request, by his prohibiting Ministers to pray, and censuring them for praying
for her conversion to our Religion, which we have punctually proved, and of
Master How for praying to God to preserve the young Prince from being brought
up in Popery, of which there was great fear; a harmless yea necessary prayer,
both in respect of the Queen Mother, then too near him, and the Queen, who by
the Articles of the Match, was to have a great hand in his Education till he
was fourteen years of age, as also in regard of the Popes Nuncioes, the
seducing Jesuits, Priests and Capucines about the Queen, Court, Him, and
childrens natural prouenesse unto error: Which prayers, admit they had been
an oversight, yet proceeding from a godly Christian Zeal, deserved only a
private admonition, not open prosecution, or High Commission censure; but his
making of them so publicly criminal, and censuring those so severely for
them, of purpose to deter all others from praying for the Queens conversion,
or against the Princes perversion, is an undeniable argument of his good
affection to Popery, and attempts to reduce us thereunto: For his extolling
Queen Mary's, and depressing King Edwards, and Queen Elizabeth's days, the
words sufficiently declare, it was as well in reference to the Religion then
professed, as to the University Statutes, and the Preface it self is of his
own making as well as the Statutes, as we shall more fully manifest in due
place by his own letters.

Secondly, to the particular instances, the Commons made this reply; First,
that their maine end in producing them was only to demonstrate, that the Pope
and his Instruments had a real Plot and design to introduce Popery, and
reduce us back to Rome, and that the Archbishop could not but know and take
special notice thereof by all these particular Letters, Papers, Books, found
in his own Study, sent, written to himself, endorsed with his own hand, or
recorded in his Diary; which should have engaged him with greater vigilance,
care, animosity, to have opposed them and their designs: In which regard, the
three first of them, with all the rest most nearly concerned him, neither does,
nor can he plead ignorance of them: Secondly, that though all these particulars
prove not, that he promoted, confederated with them in their designs, yet some
of them directly prove it, as his countenancing of Sancta Clara his Books, his
maintaining of Saint Giles (a most dangerous seducing Popish Priest) many years
in the University of Oxford; his opposing, answering the Commons Remonstrance
against the dangerous open increase and practices of Papists in Ireland to set
up Popery there, and branding it as a scandalous untruth: Thirdly, for
Habernfields plot, we shall prove how it makes against him in due time; and for
Sancta Clara his Book of Reconciliation, we have proved; First, that he knew of
it, and had both the Book and Author brought to him by his Favorite Doctor
Linsey before it was printed; this we have under his own hand, therefore it is
monstrous impudency in him to deny it: Secondly, that this Book when printed,
was presented to, reserved by him in his study, and the Author with him there
some three or four times afterward: Thirdly, that it was printed and publicly
sold here in London without control: Fourthly, that his creatures both abroad
and at home much applauded it: Fifthly, that Saint Giles was the Author of it, a
popish Priest whom himself sent to, and maintained in the University of
Oxford, to pervert and seduce Scholars there; That he had the Kings Warrant
for it, is no excuse, and the Warrant being without date, written with his own
hand, and signed by the King to help at a dead list, savours of mere fraud,
circumvention, and will amount to an aggravation, but no extenuation of his
crime: Fourthly, the proffer of a Cardinalship twice unto him, even at Court,
so soon as he was nominated Archbishop, proves the good opinion that the popish
party had of his inclination to their party and Religion; his concealing the
names of the parties that made him the offer (which he will not disclose) and
his not prosecuting and complaining against them to bring them to public
justice, prove that he deemed this proffer no injury nor disparagement: if a
poor Puritan did but write against Popery or Popish Innovations, he presently
prosecuted him in the High Commission or Star Chamber, where he was sure to be
fined, imprisoned, pillored, stigmatized, scourged, banished; but he that
seriously tendered him a Cardinals Cap twice one after another, escaped
scot-free, without so much as being once questioned for it: As for his
informing the King thereof, it was not by way of complaint, but advice; and his
answer to the King, if true, is no absolute rejection of the Dignity, but
rather an adjournment for the present, his ambitious itching desire of being a
Pope and Patriarch throughout his Majesty's Dominions, testified by Sir Henry,
and Master Anthony Mildmay, with Master Challoner, making him refuse the
present offer, not any detestation of Popery, or reconciliation with Rome: To
the sixth was replied, that it appeared by the Bishops Protestation in Ireland,
that he knew of the great growth and power of Papists there even in the year
1626. two years before his Answer to the Commons Remonstrance, which lies on
him substantially to prove, that it was made by the Kings command, as to this
particular, not yet attempted by him, his own bare endorsment being no proof
in his own case: The Letters, Papers afterward received by him from Ireland,
most clearly manifest his exact intelligence of popish Priests and Papists
dangerous increase and proceedings there, without the least opposition from
him, or complaint against them: The smalnesse of their Monasteries, Nunneries
there erected, is no extenuation of his guilt: Small evils not suppressed will
prove grand universal mischiefs in short time, as those their Monasteries and
Nunneries there have done: For the Lord Deputies Letters, it is true, he could
not hinder the directing and sending of them to him, but he might have
hindered, prevented the execution of his desperate popish project related in
them, and have crushed it in the shell, which he never did. To the seventh was
answered, that his extraordinary former power both with the King and Queen,
might and should have engaged him so far, as to prevent those Roman Nuncioes
arrival, here, and our Agents at Rome, whom he never so much as once opposed
for ought appears, but complied with, by his Agents, Bishop Mountague and
Secretary Windebank, as we have fully manifested, when as he should rather have
lost his Archbishopric, liberty, life, then have any way consented to it in
the least degree, and openly resisted it to his utmost power.

The third Objection against me is, my compliance with the popish party, and
Object. 3. Page 441, 442.
endeavors to introduce Popery, advance the Papists Designs, and reduce us
back to Rome by seven particulars formerly insisted on, and now only
recapitulated with reference to the former proofs.

To most of all these I have given full answers before, and therefore shall be
Answer.
the briefer in giving further answers to them now. The first, second, fourth,
fifth, sixth and seventh instances I deny, in the sense they are pressed, and
have acquitted my self from them in the premises: To the third I shall give
some further Answer.

First, it is there objected, that I maintaintained the Church of Rome to be a
true Church, and that she erred not in Fundamentals, no not in the worst times,
bue only Circa Fundamentalia: And that I justified Chownaeus his Book, who
maintained the same. I answer, that I did and do maintain her to be a true
Church Veritate entis, not Moris, though corrupt and erroneous in some points,
as a thief is a true man, though a thief: And in my Book against Fisher, I
charge her with some gross corruptions, errors, to the very endangering of
salvation, and with superstition too. Secondly, I am charged that I did
maintain at Doctor Bastwicks censure, that she erred not in Fundamentalibus,
but Circa Fundamentalia; this distinction I shall still maintain. There is a
great difference between Fundamentalia and Superstructoria, and yet some
circumstantials may destroy the foundation: For example; First, Quid What it is
a man believes; if a man believes the Trinity without the Unity, or the Unity
without the Trinity, this plucks up the Foundation: Secondly, Vbi, the
circumstance of place; for if any should deny that Christ was borne, or took
his flesh in Judea, this grates upon the very foundation: Thirdly, Quibus
Auxiliis, we believe, convert and do works of piety; by nature or grace? If by
the strength of nature only, as the Pelagians held, this endangers the
foundation: Fourthly, Quando, as to deny that Christ is not already come in the
flesh, this subverts the foundation, though but a circumstance: And it is a
rule in the Schools, Aliqua circumstantia dat speciem morali actioni; and in
this sense the Church of Rome does err about fundamentals. Thirdly, it is
alleged, that I hold the Religion of the Church of England and Rome is both
one; Conference with Fisher, page 576. I answer, that it is one and the same
Religion in the general; to wit, the Christian Religion: But yet I there
write; That we differ in the same Religion, though we set not up a different
Religion; and the difference is in certain gross corruptions, to the very
endangering of salvation, which each side says the other is guilty of.
Fourthly, that I maintain, people may be saved in the Roman Church and
Religion; I answer, that other learned Protestants are of the same opinion, not
generally of all, but of those among them who want means of better
instruction; yet I hold it is very dangerous to continue in that Church and
Religion, for any who have means to come out of them. Fifthly, that I hold the
Pope is not the Antichrist, and therefore I caused this Title given him to be
expunged, and authorized, received, printed Books denying him to be Antichrist,
as Shelfords and others, contrary to our Homilies, Writers, and the Articles of
Ireland: I answer, that no man can charge me, that I hold the Pope not to be
Antichrist: It is a great question even among learned Protestants, whether he
be so o^ not. The Church of England has not positively resolved him to be so:
The Homilies define him not to be Antichrist: and the Articles of Ireland bind
not us here. My expunging of this Title and others of that nature was upon
other grounds. However, it is no such undoubted Article of Faith, as Powell in
his Book De Antichristo, with others, make it. As for the objected Books, I
neither Licensed nor approved them, though I had them in my Study. Sixthly, it
is objected, that I hold the Pope to be supreme head of the Church; Though
Francis Sales, and others style him so, they must answer for it, its nothing at
all to me who hold it not. As for his titles given me by Croxton and the
University of Oxford in their Letters, it was without my privity, I could not
hinder it; and the same Titles have been usually given to Bishops in former
ages, as appears by the Epistles of Saint Cyprian, Augustine and others.
Seventhly, for Pocklingtons and Bishop Mountagues deriving my Succession from
Augustine, Gregory, and Saint Peter's Chair at Rome; it was without my privity:
It is no more then Master Mason has proved long before my time; and the
Papists would give you hearty thanks, could you disprove this lineall Succession
of our Bishops.

To this was replied in general, that all the seven objected particulars prove
a most apparent design in him to introduce Popery, and reconcile us to Rome;
Reply.
and that all his Answers to them had been formerly disproved as false and
impertinent. In particular, That the Church of Rome was no true Church at all,
but a false, Antichristian, as well as a corrupt Church. for First, it has no
true Foundation, being not built upon the Apostles, Prophets, and Christ the
Cornerstone. Secondly, no true Head, Ordinances, Sacraments, Worship, but a
false adulterous head, the Pope; corrupt Ordinances, Sacraments, and a mere
Idolatrous, supersticious will worship. Thirdly, no true Ministry, nor
government of Christ's institution. Fourthly, she yields no true Subjection nor
Obedience to Christ, his laws, word, spirit, but opposes him and them in all.
Fifthly, she is overspread with a Leprosy of damnable Errors in Doctrine,
corruptions in Faith, Manners, Ordinances, Government. Sixthly, the definition
of a true visible Church in our Homilies and Writers agrees not to her.
Seventhly, our Homilies, Writers define her to be a false Church, not a true,
who are all mustered up together by Master Burton in his Babell no Bethell,
where she is largely proved to be no true Church. For his distinction, that she
is a true Church Veritate Entis, though not Moris, as a Thief is a true man;
it is a mere childish evasion: For it is not the mere entity and being of a
company of men, that makes up a Church, or true Church; for if so, the Turks,
Pagans, or any assembly else should be a true Church, as well as the
Protestants; but a company of men rightly qualified, to wit; professing the
true Christian Faith, among whom the Word of God is truly Preached, and the
Sacraments duly administed. To set then the distinction and comparison right.
If one should demand of the Archbishop, Whether a Thief be a true man or no?
as this phrase true man, in our ordinary language signifies an honest
just-dealing man, with reference to his qualities, morals, not his Entity or
being as a mere man: himself grants that he is no true man, but a false one, in
this sense, in this very distinction; and to answer, that he is a true man in
regard of his essence, therefore a true man in respect of his Morals, were a
mere impertinency, and Nonsequitur. By the selfsame reason, when we demand of
him, Whether the Church of Rome be a true Church? and he answers She is so,
Veritate entis, for she consists of a company of persons, or real men; not
veritate moris, for that they are not so truly qualified in those Morals, or
rather supernatural principles which makes them to be a true Church: Himself
must needs grant, that his distinction is fallacious, in applying this veritas
entis to them as they are a Church, not men; or else yield that they are a
false, but no true Church, because his not veritate Moris, can be applied to
nothing else but to such moral and divine qualifications, as should make them
a true Church; so as his own distinction directly subverts this his false
conclusion of her being a true Church; and his charging her with gross
Corruptions, Errors, Superstitions, to the endangering of salvation does the
like.

Secondly, it was retorted, that his distinction of her erring only circa
fundamentalia, not in Fundamentalibus, was a falsehood: For first, her affirming
the Church to be built upon Peter and the Pope, not Christ the chief
cornerstone. Her denying the Scriptures to be Scriptures but as they are
grounded on, confirmed and expounded by the Authority of the Church and Pope,
Her making Apochryphall Scriptures Canonical, and so adding to the Scriptures.
Her giving the Pope power to null and dispense with things against the
Scriptures. Her resolving the foundation of all our Faith into the Church; To
believe as the Church believes, not into the Scriptures themselves. Her
deifying of the Virgin Mary, Saints, Images, in praying to and adoring them
with divine worship. Her joining of Saints Merits and Mediations with Christ's,
and making them joint Saviors, Mediators and Advocates with him. Her turning
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper into a Propitiatory Massing Sacrifice, of as
great or greater Merit as Christ's own Sacrifice on the cross; adoring the
consecrated Bread, as their Lord God and Christ himself. Her taking away the
Sacramental Cup from the Laity, pointblanke against Christ's own Institution.
Her giving Christ an ubiquitary body on earth, instead of a glorified body in
heaven; her tying people to pray to God in an unknown tongue, with her creating
a new head of the Church in Christ's stead, the Pope, who has the Keys of
Heaven, Hell and Purgatory too; and can pardon sins, release Souls out of Hell
and Purgatory at his pleasure; with her abolishing the second Commandment out
of the Decalogue; What are they all but Fundamental Errors, nullifying that
Church which maintains them, and not Errors only about the foundation?

For his four instances, that circumstances may undermine and destroy the
Foundation: We answer, First, that neither of all these instances concern the
Papists or Church of Rome, the subject in question; therefore altogether
impertinent. Secondly, they are not mere circumstantials, but fundamentals;
because directly contrary to the express words of Scripture and Articles of
our Faith, of which they are unseparable parts; which if false in any part, may
and will be false in the whole, and no ground of Faith at all. For the rule of
the Schools we agree it, but how he applies it to his distinction, or the
Church of Rome, we cannot yet discern.

Thirdly, it was replied; That the Religion of the Church of Rome and England
is not one and the same; For that which they repute the maine part of their
Religion, is no Christian Religion at all, nor part of the Christian Religion,
but mere Antichristian Error, Superstition, corruption, Idolatry. And in his
Book he does no more charge her with some gross corruptions endangering
Salvation, then she charge us, as the perusal of his words demonstrates.
Fourthly, his justifying salvation to be had in this false Antichristian Church
and Religion, denying the foundation, is contrary to the opinion of all
Otthodox Protestants, who make her damnable Errors the ground of their
separation from her. And though some affirm, that diverse in the Church of Rome
are saved; yet none are saved by being of that Church, or by that Faith and
Doctrine which she properly calls her Faith and Religion, wherein she differs
from us, but by their relying only on Christ's merits, which she disclaimes.

Fifthly, his deleting all phrases, clauses calling or intimating the Pope to be
the Antichrist, is a clear evidence, that he holds him not to be so: Else his
sin, fault will prove the greater in purging out that as Heterodox and
scandalous, which himself believes to be a truth. For our Statutes, Homilies,
Writers, they define the Pope either in direct terms, or equivalent
expressions to be Antichrist and our Church, yea State in them, at leastwise in
our forecited Statutes, and the Subsidy, Act 3. Jac. penned by the Convocation.
As for the Articles of Ireland, though they bind us not, yet being taken out of
the Articles and Homilies of England, they sufficiently declare the resolution
of our Church as well as theirs, that the Pope is Antichrist; and Doctor Usher
Primate of Armagh, in a Letter of his to the Archbishop himself, Jan. 4. 1635.
(the very day of his birth) writes, That this conceit is so rife in the minds
and mouths of the Papists now adays, THAT WE ARE COMING ON AND EVERY DAY
DRAWING NIGHER UNTO THEM THEN OTHER; for the stopping of whose slanderous
mouths, let this suffice, That whatsoever others imagine of the matter, I stand
fully convinced in my conscience, THAT THE POPE IS ANTICHRIST; and therefore if
I should be so mad as to worship the Beast, or receive the mark of his name, I
must be (...), and justly expect the revenge that is threatened against such,
Apoc. 14. 10, 11. Wherefore for this Arch-Prelat to question it, to purge out
all passages stiling him Antichrist, after such a Letter, to suffer such Books
to be printed, and retain them in his Study, which deny him to be Antichrist,
without any censure of them or their Authors, is a grand offense, savourng of
his good affection to the Pope.

Sixthly, though himself gives not this title of Supreme head to the Pope in
direct terms, yet he does it in effect in his own Book, and his Chaplain
licensed it in Sales, for which himself must answer. As for the papal titles
given him by Master Croxton and the whole University of Oxford, in several
Letters, it was certainly with his approbation, else he would have reprehended
them for it, which he never did: These titles are such as of later times have
been appropriated only to the Pope, and were never given to any of his
Predecessors in any Age, much less to any Protestant Bishop: And though one of
them (as Sanctissime Pater) may perchance be found in Cyprians and Augustines
genuine Epistles; yet Sanctitas in the abstract, can hardly be showed in any of
their true Epistles, nor was ever appropriated to any for many hundred of Ages,
but to the Pope: As for the other exorbitant and blasphemous titles, no Father
nor ancient Author was ever guilty of giving or affirming them.

Seventhly, for Pocklingtons and Mountagues deriving his pedigree and
succession from Rome, it is in such phrase and language, as was never used by
Mason, or any Obje. 4.
else in former times, with a mere intention to reconconcile, reduce our
Church and Prelates to Rome, from whence they derive their pedigree; the end of
all these new positions and objected particulars against the Archbishop, the
guilt whereof still rest upon him, notwithstanding all his Evasions to shake it
off.

The fourth thing charged against me to make good this Branch, is my holding
intelligence, correspondence with the Popes Nuncioes, Agents, Priests, Jesuits,
by my Favorites and Instruments, as by Bishop Mountague and Secretary
Windebanke, advanced by my means; the later of them, as appears by many
produced Letters and Testimonies, holding intelligence with Cardinal Barbarino
(who entertained his Sons at Rome) the Popes Nuncioes, and with diverse
dangerous Priests, Jesuits, whom he protected, released out of prison, and
imprisoned the Messengers who usually apprehended them, till they gave bond,
never to apprehend nor prosecute Priests any more.

To this I answer, First, that there is no clear proof of Bishop Mountagues
advancement by me, or intelligence or compliance with the Popes Nuncio,
Priests, Answer.
or Jesuits; but if there were, it is nothing to me, being without my privity,
knowledge, or approbation: Secondly, for Secretary Windebanke, it is very true,
I was the means of advancing him to the Secretaries place (being my ancient
friend and acquaintance) but not with any intent to advance Popery, protect or
release Priests, Jesuits, or hold any correspondency with the Pope or his
instruments; if he proved so ill an instrument after his advancement, it was
beyond my expectation, himself must answer, and has been impeached for it,
not I: For the Letters he received from the Popes Nuncio Panzani, the Queens
Priests, or his Sons, with their going to, and entertainment at Rome, they
concern not me, who was not privy to them nor their entertainment: But it is
objected, that we continued our friendship still, notwithstanding I knew his
correspondency with, releasing and protecting Priests, Jesuits, and joined with
him in some Warrants: I answer, that it is well known that he and I were at
variance and distance of later times, he deserting me in the business of the
late Lord Treasurer Weston, and for my hand to one Warrant jointly with his and
others for a Priests release, it was but casual, we being then both together
at the Counsel Table, where his Release was condescended to, upon sufficient
bail and caution, at the Queens request.

To this was replied; First, that Mountagues correspondency with the Popes
Reply.
Nuncio, Priests, Jesuits, his popish inclination and endeavors to reconcile
and reduce us back to Rome, are abundantly proved in the premises, with his
good affection to, and compliance with him in this design, the end and cause
of his advancing him to two several Bishoprics, the last whereof was Norwich:
In his account from whence to the Archbish. himself for the year 1638. (written
with his own hand, endorsed with the Archbishops, and found in his Study)
there is this notable clause concerning King Henry the eighth, the first
suppressor of the Popes power among us; The Bishopric of Norwich, since the
total desolation and dissolution of the former Bishopric by King Henry the
eighth, WHO STOLE THE SHEEP, AND GAVE NOT SO MUCH AS THE TROTTERS FOR GODS
SAKE, is a mean thing, (though worth above one thousand pounds per annum) A
most ingrate and scandalous expression of an avaritious popish Prelat, unworthy
of so fat a Bishopric, who instead of being Shepherd, became a Wolf,
devouring not only the Sheep, but Shepherds of his Diocese, and vexing them
more with his popish Visitation, Articles, then ever KING HENRY the 8. did the
Prelates by diminishing their over-large Possessions.

Secondly, for Secretary Windebank, it is undeniable; First, that the
Archbishop was the only means of his advancement to that place of trust:
Secondly, that he was his mere creature, instrument, bosome-friend, and privy
to all his actions: Thirdly, this intimacy and friendship of theirs, continued
till Windebanks flight hence in to France, upon the Parliaments impeachment
against him for harboring and releasing Priests and Jesuits, and that the
transitory short differerence between them about the Lord Treasurer Weston, had
no relation at all to any thing concerning Priests or Religion, wherein they
both accorded: Fourthly, that the same Priests and Jesuits, as Sir Toby
Mattehw, Smith, Leander, Sancta Clara and Price, were intimate and familiar
with them both: Fifthly, that they both concurred in checking, discouraging,
imprisoning, Gray, Thatcher, Waddesworth, and others for apprehending Priests,
Jesuits, and in calling Gray a Priest-catching knave; Sixthly, that they both
joined together in some Warrants for the release of Priests; and his excuse,
that it was by casualty when they were both at the Counsel Table, where others
joined with them, is no extenuation of his offense; where he being the
over-potent member, should have engaged all the rest to oppose such an illegal
scandalous action, and not have drawn them on thereto, by setting his hand
first to the Warrant: But it was to gratify the Queen, and promote the Roman
Catholic Cause, therefore to show his forwardness, his hand must be first to
this Priests discharge, that so he might the more freely walk abroad to seduce
his Majesty's Subjects: Seventhly, for Panzanies, Father Joseph's, Father
Phillips, with his sons and the Lord Scudamores Letters to Secretary
Windebank, though they are nothing to the Archbishop in point of charge, simply
considered (in which sense we urge them not) yet they are infallible evidences
of Secretary Windebanks correspondency and intelligence with the Popes
Nuncioes, Priests, Jesuits, of Cardinal Barbarinoes, and others respects to
him and his Sons, of his extraordinary protection of Priests, Jesuits, and
that he was their instrument, the only end for which we produced them; and
being compared with his advancement of, and intimacy with Windebank,
notwithstanding the frequent complaints to himself and the Counsel of his
releasing, protecting Priests, Jesuits, and with that general good opinion the
Priests and Papists had generally at Rome, and in other foreign parts of of
the Archbishops own real endeavors to promote their Religion here, and
reduce us back to Rome (testified by Sir Henry, and Master Anthony Mildmay,
Master Challoner and others) it will amount to a full proof of a confederacy
between them to effect this dangerous Romish Design, notwithstanding all his
evasions; to accomplish which, this Secretary was as active an instrument for
him in the State, as Mountague and other Prelates in the Church.

The fifth thing objected to prove my real intentions, endeavors to introduce
popery, and reconcile us unto Rome, is my intimacy and correspondency with
Object. 5.
diverse dangerous Priests and Jesuits, as Saint Giles, Sir Toby Matthew, Smith
the Jesuit, Leander, Price, the Bishop of Calcedon Doctor Smith, and others;
one of which [Saint Giles] I am charged to have maintained in the University of
Oxford sundry years, to corrupt and seduce Scholars there; my discouraging,
threatening and abusing Pursevants for their diligence in apprehending Priests
and Jesuits; my not committing Priests, or discharging them when brought unto
me by them; my imprisoning Gray, and calling him Priest-catching knave; my
connivance at the liberty that Priests and Jesuits had in the New-prison, Clink
and elsewhere; my causing many popish Books to be restored to the owners when
seized (contrary to the Statute) that so they might be dispersed to seduce his
Majesty's Subjects; some of which particulars are proved by papers under my
own hand, seized by Master Prynne, who ransackt my Study and Chamber; others,
by the testimonies of Waddesworth, Newton, Deuxell, Mayo, Goldsmith, Cook,
Egerton, Elizabeth Gray and Thatcher: And out of my own Book they allege, I
never persuaded nor practiced any persecution against popish Priests or Jesuits.

To this I answer in general; First, that if the design charged against me,
were only to reconcile the Church of England and Rome together in a just and
Cstristian way, so far as it might stand with truth and piety, I hope no
Christian can blame, but rather commend me for such an enterprise; Such a
reconciliation between both Churches as this, I confess I have long desired,
endeavored, and published as much to the world in my Reply to Fisher, p. 388.
in these words; I have with a faithful and single heart, labored the meeting,
the blessed meeting of TRUTH AND PEACE in Christ's Church, which God I hope will
in due time effect: But other reconciliation then this to the prejudice of
truth and piety, I never attempted, as my Epistle to that Book will manifest.

Secondly, for my pretended intimacy, correspondency with Priests and Jesuits,
I dare confidently affirm, that never any man that sat in my place since Answ.
the Reformation, had less acquaintance, familiarity, correspondence with
Priests and Jesuits then I; some of my late Predecessors, by name, Archbishop
Bancroft and Abbot (never suspected of any inclination to popery) have usually
held intelligence with, and received sundry Letters from Priests, Jesuits in
foreign parts yea entertained some of them at their Tables, and that no doubt
for good purposes, and the advancement of the Protestant Religion: But I for my
part never held correspondency, nor received Letters from any of them; and I
bless God for it; for had I done it, I must have suffered very deeply; and my
Chamber, Study, Closet, being so diligently searched, no doubt their Letters
would have been seized, and given in evidence by Master Prynne, as well as
others; but no such Letters are or can be produced; and to my knowledge I never
entertained knowingly any Priest or Jesuit at my Table, nor gave them any
countenance, though my Predecessors have usually done it; to prove which, I
desire Master Dobson may be examined: who being examined accordingly without
Oath, affirmed; That he was an household servant to Archbishop Bancroft, who
received diverse Letters of intelligence from Priests and Jesuits in foreign
parts, and sometimes admitted them to his Table; that he was after servant to
Archbishop Abbot, who for a month or two, dieted one Julius Maria, and another
popish Priest, as he takes it, (the one a Spaniard, the other an Italian) at
his Table, in hopes of their conversion, who faltered wish him in the end, and
were thereupon discarded: That he was likewise a servant to this Archbishop,
and never saw Sir Toby Matthewes, nor any other Priest or Jesuit to his
knowledge at his Table: Who being cross interrogated, Whether he knew Julius
Maria and the other to be popish Priests? He answered, he did not certainly
know them to be so, but they were so reputed, and professed Papists: To which
the Archbishop added, That King James had conference with, and extended favor
to some Priests, making good use thereof, to set them at variance among
themselves, and induce them for to write one against another, as Watson and
Preston, who wrote diverse Books in defense of the Oath of Alleagiance, and did
good service therein; whereupon my Predecessor Abbot granted Preston a kind of
protection under his hand and Seal: And why I might not do as much as my
predecessors in countenancing Sancta Clara (were I guilty of it) without any
Guilt of TREASON or just Offense, I yet know not any reason.

Thirdly, I utterly deny that I held any correspondency with Sir Toby Matthew,
Smith, Price, Leander, Sancta Clara or Saint Giles, neither is there any clear
proof thereof: but admit I did, yet there is no proof at all that I knew them
to be Seminary Priests; and if I knew them not to be Priests, no Law takes hold
upon me, though I harbored them, which I never did.

Fourthly, the witnesses produced to prove my intimacy with these Priests, are
persons of very mean condition, against whom there have been many great
complaints made heretofore at the Counsell-Table, and against one or two of
them of late, for dishonest practices, in seizing other men's goods and moneys,
under pretext of searching after Priests and Jesuits, pretending the goods were
theirs: which complaints were referred to some Justices of Peace to examine and
how far their testimonies will sway with your Lordships, I most humbly submit
to your grave judgments, they being formerly offended with me, for pressing
the examination of the many complaints against them in this kind.

Secondly, to the particular testimonies I answer; First, that Saint Giles his
residing and maintenance in Oxford, was by the Kings special Warrant, which
has been produced, much against my will; and I never heard he exercised his
popish Function, or seduced any there, but only studied metaphysicall
learning, according to his engagement: Secondly, For Sir Toby Matthew, I did
not know that he was either a Priest or Jesuit, and utterly deny that he was
ever with me in my Coach or Barge, or usually repaired to me to Lambeth, though
being an eminent Archbishops Son, I might in that regard have permitted him
more free access unto me: And my Secretary, Master Dell, remembers not that
ever he told Newton that Sir Toby Matthewes was with me in the Garden at
Lambeth: Besides, Newton, is but a single witness; and Master Dobson attests,
that he never saw Sir Toby Matthew with me at Lambeth. As for his release when
apprehended by the Lords Warrant, it was only by the Earl of Straflords order,
not mine. For Smith the Jesuit, there is no proof that ever he was with me at
Lambeth, but only that he was seen there talking familiarly with my Secretary,
Master Dell, near my Study door, who denies and remembers not any such thing:
As for his words to Newton, that he had done his errand to me, they are but the
reports of a Jesuit to slander me, there being no proof that ever he spoke
with me: For my correspondence with the Bishop of Calcedon, Doctor Smith, there
is no proof but conjecturall from my Diary: For Leander and Price their
resorting to me, it is but a report, without proof at all: And for Sancta
Clara, I never saw him above three or four times, according as I have truly
related under my own hand: Fourthly, Saint Giles and he were Aliens borne out
of the Kings Dominions, and no natural born Subjects; therefore admit I had
harbored and maintained them, it is no felony nor treason by our Laws, and
directly out of the Statute of 27. Elizabeth: Fifthly, Waddesworths testimony,
it is but a hearsay; for my sending four pound to pay his Fees, I think it is
true, and it was upon this occasion; He pretended that he had been a Roman
Catholic, but was now really converted to our Religion, and thereupon
released, but wanted money to pay his Fees; whereupon I sent him four pound,
thinking him to be a new convert to us, and it was upon his own sending to, and
acquainting me with his poverty and condition: Sixthly, for my releasing and
refusing to meddle with Wilford the Priest, it need no other answer then what
the Witness swears, that he had a protection and Letter of discharge from
Secretary Windebanke, and this was the cause I refused to meddle with him:
Seventhly, for Gray, he was committed by the Lords of the Counsel, not by me;
he gave me very ill language, and used approbrious scandalous speeches of me in
my own house, for which he was committed: As for my calling of him
Priest-catching knave, it is proved but by one Witness; and indeed there were
many complaints against him for abusing his authority in seizing and searching
after Priests, to the prejudice of those who were not such: whereupon I
commanded the rest of the Messengers belonging to the High Commission not to
keep him company, to avoid the like abuses and complaints: Eighthly, for
Egertons testimony, it is but a report from Mottersheads mouth, a single
Witness, formerly censured in the High Commission for his abuses in importing
prohibited Books, and therefore his testimony is to be suspected; Master Jones
is not produced to make good his testimony, but his papers only, which are no
evidence: Ninthly, for the liberty and freedom of Priests in their prisons, it
was unkowne to me, and their Keepers fault, not mine, who would have restrained
them: Finally, Mayo witnesses thus much for me, that I gave him command to
watch the Ambassadors and Popes Nuncioes houses, to see who resorted thither
to Mass; which he did, giving me an account thereof; and Thatcher confesses,
that I gave him a Warrant to apprehend Priests and Jesuits; though I denied it
to another, whom I thought not fit to trust in such an employment; a clear
evidence I was no friend unto, and held no correspondency with them. Whereas it
is objected, that I confess I never persuaded nor practiced any persecution
against popish Priests and Jesuits, though I persuaded and practiced it too
against Puritans, and those who opposed popery: I answer, that I hope it is no
offense not to be a persecutor, or not to give ill language to Jesuits; and for
my persecuting of orthodox Ministers and Puritans, I never persecuted any,
though I prosecuted some for their schism and misdemeanors: Wherefore this
heavy charge which has made so great a noise in your Lordships and the peoples
ears, is I hope quite wiped off, and fallen to the ground.

To this was replied in general; First, that the Design charged upon him is,
not his reconciling of ROME to us, but of the Church of ENGLAND Reply.
to the errors and corruptions of the Church of ROME; and how active he was,
how far he proceeded to accomplish this, and how near he had brought it to
perfection, both in point of Doctrine, Ceremonies, practice, the premised
evidences have abundantly manifested, notwithstanding all flourishes to the
contrary in his Book against Fisher, published not out of any zeal against
popery, but merely in policy upon other men's solicitations, to stop the peoples
clamours against his popish practices and proceedings, as himself relates in
his Epistle thereunto: And his setting up ALTARS, CRUCIFIXES, IMAGES, TAPERS,
introducing bowing to ALTARS, COPES, Consecration of Flagons, Churches,
Chapels, purging out all passages against popish Doctrines, Popes, Jesuits,
popish Priests, etc. his permitting all kind of ARMINIAN ERRORS and Popish
Tenants, to be Preached in our Pulpits, and published in Print with his
Chaplains special approbations prefixed to them; together with his
countenancing; advancing the Authors, fomenters, and persecuting the oppugners
of them, speak far cleerer, louder against him, then all his empty writings
and testimonies of himself can possibly plead for his justification, being so
palpably contradicted by the whole stream of his actions.

Secondly, that his intimacy, correspondency with popish Priests and Jesuits is
sufficiently proved by our former evidence: Sir Toby Matthew, the most active
pernicious Jesuited Priest in the Kingdom, we have proved to be riding with
him sometimes in his Barge, sometimes in his Coach, sometimes in private
earnest discourse with him in his Garden, and frequently with him at his Table;
what greater familiarity or intimacy could there be between them then this?
That he knew him to be a Priest and Jesuit, is clear by Habernfields plot,
found in his Study, informing him to be so; and by the Popes Bull to him,
common in many Courtiers hands: For Sancta Clara, his favorite Doctor Lindsey
brought him to his Study, with his Book to reconcile us to Rome, to peruse it
of purpose before it went to the Press; after which he came thrice to him,
writ a Book in defense of Episcopacy by divine Right, with an intention to
gratify him, and tendered it to him for his license, as himself confesses
under his See here p. 427.
own hand in a written paper, where he extenuates this fact all he could; and
is this no intimacy nor correspondency? For St Giles, his own See here p: 428.
handwriting, testifies that he knew him to be a Priest, yet notwithstanding
he permitted him to reside sundry years in the University of Oxford, where
himself was Chancellor, to have the use of the Library there; yea he provided
him a large maintenance, and constantly paid it to him there, during his
residence, he repairing often times to him to receive it; and is all this no
intimacy, no correspondency? For Leander, he denies not but that he was with
him once or twice, and if common reports both among popish Priests, Papists or
Protestants may be credited, he was once his Chamber-fellow in Oxford, and most
intimate, powerful with him here, being purposely sent hither by means of his
interest in him, to complete our reconciliation and reduction to Rome. For
Smith, a most dangerous Jesuit, we have proved his being at Lambeth near his
Study, his familiarity with Master Dell his Secretary, who used him with great
respect; his intimacy with Secretary Windebanke, the Archbishops greatest
confederate; his sending of messages to the Archbishop by Sir Toby Matthew, to
remember the business he told his Grace of when he was last with him; and his
frequent threatening of Master Newton the Messenger when he met him in the open
streets, that he would complain of him, or do his errand to the Archbishop,
and that he had done it; And are these no badges of his intimacy? For his
acquaintance and correspondence with the Bishop of Calcedon, Doctor Smith, it
is apparent by his own Diary, and Windebanks Letter to his Son, himself not
daring to deny, that Doctor Smith mentioned in his Diary, is any other then
Calcedon: For Price the Provinall of the Benedictines, we have proved that he
has been seen at Lambeth talking familiarly with Master Dell, and waiting near
the Archbishops Study door to speak with him in private; that he and Leander
have been often times met, going, as themselves affirmed, to Lambeth to speak
with the Archbishop, who cannot deny but they were with him; and by whose means
we know not, this Price procured the Searchers place at Dover for the use of
the Benedictines, and put two professed Papists into it, for the freer passage
of Priests and Jesuits into the Kingdom, and more secure conveying
intelligence to and from Rome: Now lay all this together, and we dare
confidently aver, that all his predecessors since the Reformation put
together, had not half that intimacy, correspondency with Priests and Jesuits
as he; and if the truth were known, the party or parties who two several
times seriously tendered him a Cardinals Cap, avowing ability to perform it,
was either the Popes own Nuncio, or some Priests, Jesuits or popish Agents,
who had instructions from the Pope himself to make this offer to him; which
none durst nor could without hazard of their lives, have tendered so much as
once, much less twice to any of his protestant predecessors: That he received
no Letters from Priests and Jesuits, is a thing not credible; the double
proffer of a Cardinalship to him from Rome, is a stronger evidence that he
received Letters likewise from thence, then his own bare word, he received
none: It is true, we met with no such Letters in his Study or Closet, but the
reason was, himself before his commitment and afterward, when he went to
Lambeth to fetch papers thence (his Closet and Study being not sealed up till
some months after his commitment) had time and wisdom enough to convey all
such Letters out of the way, or burn them, least they should rise up in
judgment to condemn him, though he removed not others thence, wherein he
conceived least danger, the better to color his removal and burning of the
most dangerous.

For Master Dobsons Testimony, he is but testis domesticus, his own meniall
servant, a mere single Witness, and unsworn too, therefore not so much to be
valued; but take it as it is, it proves little for him: He says, that
Archbishop Bancroft received Letters of intelligence from foreign Priests and
Jesuits, but he knows neither their persons nor names, much less that they
were either priests or Jesuits and that any such resorted to his Table, he
cannot certainly affirm it: for he cannot nominate any one priest in
particular, and conceives only they were priests but knows it not but by
conceit, without other evidence: For Julius Maria and the other forraigner, who
dieted for a time at Archbishop Abbots Table, he confesses he did not know
them to be priests, but strangers they were, and papists, who made some shows
and promises to that Archbishop of turning Protestants, the only ground why he
thus entertained them, to further and perfect their conversion; but as soon as
they faltred with him, they were presently discarded: But what is this to this
Archbishops case, who kept correspondency with these Priests and Jesuits, of
purpose to pervert and reduce us back to Rome, not to convert them unto us;
certainly neither of these two (though Bancroft was none of the greatest
enemies to Rome) ever entertained a Jesuit, or most pernicious known seducers
into their Coaches, Barges, Closets, Gardens, as he did Sir Toby Matthew and
Sancta Clara; never maintained any Priests in the University to seduce young
Scholars, and instruct the Doctors there, as he did Saint Giles, who
professed, that the Sea p. 428.
Archb. was very cordial for their Romish Religion; never checked, imprisoned
pursivants for being too active in apprehe^ding Priests, nor reviled them by
the name of Priest-catching kndves, as he has done; their cases and his
therefore are very different: For Master Dobsons not seeing Sir Toby Matthew at
Lambeth; Ergo, he was never there with the Archbishop; it is a mere
Nonsequitur; Master Dobson is ancient, perchance his eyes were so dim he
could not discern him, or he was out of the way when Sir Toby was there; but
diverse others swear they saw him there; Master Dell informed Master Newton,
that his Lord was busy with Sir Toby Matthew in the Garden: yea therefore the
Archbishop dares not produce him to testify his knowledge, least he should
confess the truth.

For King James his encouraging Watson and Preston to write against the Jesuits
and other of their Orders, no doubt it was a lawful policy, and if this
Archbishop made use of these Priests, Jesuits for the like good ends, we should
have commended, not accused him for it; but he makes use of them the quite
contrary way, to poison, corrupt our Universities, to sophisticate our Articles
of Religion, to put such a Roman gloss upon them, as might make them seem to
be Roman Catholics and to reconcile us speedily to Rome, not Rome to us, as
Sancta Clara his Book (written in England, and See p. 427.
showed to his Grace by the Author himself, accompanied with his great
favorite Bishop Linsey before its publication, as himself acknowledges under
his own handwriting) manifests past all contradiction; therefore the case of
Preston (to whom he himself has given a protection under his hand and Seal
as well as Abbot) is altogether impertinent.

Thirdly, for his correspondency with Sir Toby Matthew, Sancta Clara, Saint
Giles, Leander, Smith and Price, we have so fully proved it, that impudency it
self would blush to deny it: OurWitnesses have sworn all of them to be popish
Priests, himself under his hand confesses Saint Giles to be such a Priest,
and that he was charged not to exercise his See p. 428
Priestly Function during his residence in Oxford; it is strange audacity
therefore in him to deny, that he knew any of them to be Priests, when he
infallibly confesses he knew him, and no doubt knew all the rest to be so too,
especially Sancta Clara, who styles himself so in his Book, yea Father Price
and Leander too, were most notoriously known to all to be such, and to
exercise their Priestly Function in London, if not in the Court it self
sometimes, therefore known no doubt to be priests to him.

Fourthly, for the Witnesses produced, we very much wonder at his exceptions
against them, most of them, as Master Waddesworth, Newton, Mayo, Thatcher,
Goldsmith and Cook, being persons employed by the Lords of the Counsel,
himself and the high Commissioners to apprehend Priests and other Delinquents,
who continued in that employment after the pretended complaints against them:
If they were men so dishonest, so uncredible as he pretends, why the^ did
himself, the Lords and high Commissioners make choice or employ such for their
Messengers, and commit so great a trust unto them? If they be persons worthy to
be trusted with such an employment by persons of honor, quality and himself
too, then certainly most competent Witnesses, attesting only that they know,
with reference to the Archbishop, in the very execution of their Office, about
the apprehending of Priests and Jesuits, wherein none can give so full or
punctual testimony as themselves, who are most privy to their own Actions. For
the pretended abuses committed, they concern only two or three of them, not
all; that they are guilty of ought complained against them, there is not the
least shadow of proof offered by the Archbi. and admit there were, yet it
would no ways invalid their testimony, being not in the things for which they
were accused, and fortified with other concurrent testimonies, as Master
Thatchers, Master Deuxels and Elizabeth Grayes, against which there is no just
exception; for Mr Egertons censure in the High Commission, it was most unjust
and illegal; he was sentented there to be deprived of his Searchers place, and
fined forty pounds, only for giving way, and conniving at the importation of
some ENGLISH BIBLES with GENEVA NOTES, and selling some of them to others: A
dangerous crime, which will rather improve then impeach his testimony in all
honestmens opinions.

Secondly, for his particular answers, we shall return this replication;
First, that the Warrant under the Kings hand for Saint Giles his residence and
maintenance in Oxford, is without date, written with the Archbishops own
hand, and a mere circumvention; yea, it seems a very strong argument of his
guilt; for if himself did not place and provide for him in Oxford, what need
he procure such a Warrant from the King to do it? and if he had been cordial
to our Religion, he would never have accepted such a Warrant, nor intermedled
with such a dangerous scandalous Design as this, to poison and seduce the
whole University (who took public notice of it) in such a time of general
defection and backsliding unto popery.

Secondly, for his intimacy with Sir Toby Matthew, and knowing him to be a
Priest, our Witnesses evidences are so clear, we shall rather pity his
impudency in denying it, then trouble your Lordships in repeating them; Master
Dobsons not seeing him at Lambeth, is no proof he was not there, and the Earl
of Straffords releasing him, was seconded with his own approbation who said it
is well.

Thirdly, for Smiths, Leanders and Price their resorts unto him, we have
formerly cleared it, and shall not repeat; Sancta Clara his addresses to him,
with his Books to reconcile us, is confessed under his own hand, we need no
other testimony.

Fourthly, that Sancta Clara and Saint Giles were Aliens, is no extenuation of
his guilt, but aggravation; for they were therefore the fitter, the likelier to
be employed hither by papal authority, to reduce us back to Rome; But admit
them Aliens, which he has has not as yet proved, yet Sir Toby Matthew,
Leander and Price were native Englishmen, and so within the Statutes of 23
Eliz. c. 1. and 27 Eliz. c. 2. which he would evade.

Fifthly, for Master Waddesworths testimony, it is very full, the Design was to
send him over-sea, or to imprison him, till he should enter into bond never to
prosecute or apprehend Priests more, to which plot the Archbishop was privy,
whose name was used to him, himself confessing he sent him four pieces to be
rid of him; He pretends it was because he pretended himself a convert:
Certainly this is but a pretext, he being a convert many years before, and one
employed to apprehend Priests long before his imprisonment, his diligence
herein being the cause of his troubles.

Sixthly, his refusal to commit Wilford, a most dangerous seducing Priest,
before he knew he had any protection, and discharging him afterward, only
because he had a protection from Secretary Windebanke, with Master Dels answer,
that his Lord would not meddle with such trifles; shows the coldness of his
zeal to our Religion, and his good affection to popery: If a godly Protestant
Minister had but scrupled at the reading of the Book for Sabbathday-sport, or
omitted the lest Ceremony, or preached but a Sermon on a Lord's Day afternoon,
these were such heinous crimes, and matters of so grand importance, that they
must be forthwith suspended, committed, deprived, and all businesses set aside
to prosecute them, notwithstanding any protection of Law or Gospel; but if a
dangerous Priest, who had perverted above two hundred souls, be brought before
his Grace, alas his zeal is so frozen, he will not meddle with the business,
and his friend Secretary Windebanks Warrant must set him free, and secure him
against all laws and prosecutions: A plain proof of a confederacy between
them to protect these Traitors, and reduce us back to popery, by granting
liberty to such pernicious seducers.

Seventhly, for Gray, his only fault as our Witnesses depose, was, that he
complained against, his expertnesse and diligence in discovering priests, and
assisting other Messengers to apprehend them; for this heinous crime alone,
Windebanke complained of him to the Queen; and for this very cause Thatcher is
specially charged by the Arcishop himself, not to keep company with him, under
pain of being turned out of his place; and Goldsmith deposes, that the
Archbishop himself gave a public charge to all the Messengers of the High
Commission not to keep company with Gray any more, for if they did he would lay
them by the heels, pull their Coats off their backs, and turn them out of
their places; Committed he was to the Fleet upon the Archbishops complaint,
only for using words implying his coldness in prosecuting priests, and hoping
to see better times; a very poor cause to imprison him so long: His own hand
(as we proved) is to the Warrant for his commitment: He often times petitioned
for his enlargement by his wife, but his petitions were still rejected with
scorn; He answers, He will have nothing to do with that Priest-catching knave,
proved by two Witiesses, Elizabeth Gray and Goldsmith. Vbi dolor ibi digitus;
here was the cause of all the malice against Gray, this was his grand crime, he
was a priest-catcher, and a knave for catching them; strange language from an
Archbishop: But what follows? his favorite Windebank must come in to act the
second part and close up the Tragedy; Gray must not be enlarged after many
months imprisonment, till he put in bail never to discover or prosecute
Priests more, and then they should all be quiet in short time with our prelates
and popish Clergies concurrence, quickly reduce us all to Rome: This is the
upshot of the Design, which this evidence concerning Gray most clearly
discovers and proves too.

Eighthly, for Egertons testimony, concerning his restoring of popish Books, it
is more then a report, it was from the mouth of Mottershead a sworn Officer to
the Archbishop, now dead, who durst not report an untruth of this nature, and
the Archbishop himself confesses, the many Books forementioned, were restored
by order of the High Commission Court, whereof himself was a chief member,
therefore by him; a clear confirmation of Mottersheau's words, Egerton's
testimony, and Master Jones his papers.

Ninthly, for the liberty of Priests, Jesuits, and their saying Mass in
prisons, it was his own negligence and connivance, the Keepers being under his
command, and the High Commissioners, who could look narrowly enough to Puritans
and godly Ministers: and indeed their commitment thither to secure them from
our common Goales and all legal prosecutions, was but a mere fallacy to delude
the people, and advance the Catholic cause with greater facility and less
suspicion.

Tenthly, Mayoes testimony and Thatchers, are so far from extenuating, that
they aggravate his offense; their Warrants and employments being mere
dissimulations and shadows to gull the people; for naught was done upon the
intelligence of the one, to whom he refused to grant a Warrant, because he was
too hot against Priests; and no Priests apprehended by the other, who had his
Warrant upon this condition, Not to employ or keep company with Gray, the only
man that could discover Priests and Jesuits to him, and help him in their
apprehending.

Finally, his own objected confession in his Epistle to the King, God forbid I
should ever offer to perswide a persecution in any kind, or practice it in the
least, etc. against Priests and Jesuits, coupled with the premises, when as he
was so terrible, so bloody a persecutor of Orthodox godly Ministers, and
zealous Protestants, unanswerably proves his connivance at, his protection of,
and confederacy with them, to re-enthrall us in their Romish bondage: So that
this whole charge, however he conceives he has shaken it quite off and laid it
in the dust, recoiles upon him with greater vigor, and rests heavier on his
back then ever.

The last charge of this nature against me is, Page 459, 460.
that I complied with Papists, Priests and Jesuits, in concealing their very
Treasonable plots and conspiracies Obje. 6.
both against our State, Church and Religion, to reduce us unto Rome, for which
they produce two instances; my threatening and committing Mistress Hussy, for
discovering a dangerous plot of the Queen. Mother and others to cut the
Protestants throats; and my concealing of Habernfields plot discoverd to me,
not prosecuting or revealing it to the Parliament or Lords, to fifth it to the
bottom.

To this I answer that I did not conceal nor discourage the discoverers of
either of these two plots: For the first of them, I conceived it very
improbable, Answer.
and I thought Anne Hussy to be crazy when she revealed it, and so much I told
her; For her commitment to the Sheriffs, it was at her own desire, for her
greater safety; and there was as strict an examination as possible of this
conspiracy, but no clear evidence: For the latter plot, as soon as I received
intelligence of it, I presently revealed it to the King, as appears by my
Letter, and the Kings Answer to it in the margin, under his own hand, which
Master Prynne has printed; and the subsequent Letters prove, that I did all I
could therein, but could make nothing of it; This I believe a noble Lord here
present well remembers, to whom I disclosed it, to wit, the Earl of
Northumberland (who presently replied, he did remember no such thing:) However,
it is one of the greatest evidences that can be of my steadfastnesse in the
protestant Religion, and opposition against popery, if the plot were real, and
if but counterfeit, then no crime to conceal it.

To which was replied; First, that all the premises abundantly prove, that he
Reply.
was privy and assistant to many Jesuiticall plots and devices to usher in
popery, and reduce us to Rome, therefore it is no wonder that he opposed not,
nor prosecuted, but smothered them all he could: Secondly, that the first of
the plots which he then conceived improbable, has since experimentally proved
real both in England and Ireland, yea his b Own with Straffords dangerous
advice to the King, To see A neces^ary Introdution to his Trial, p. 170 71.
bring in an Army of Irish Papists at that time, to subdue the Scots, because
they durst not trust the English; was cozen Germane to this plot, which she
discovered, and probably a branch thereof; For his deeming and calling her
Mad-woman, when she spoke both punctually and rationally, with his reviling
terrifying words to her, his laying an imputation on the whole City of London,
that she was hired by them to make this discovery, with his menaces to have her
punished, etc. were unsufferable abuses in such a case as this, to smother a
most execrable Treason, and such a terrifying of a Witness, as we shall not
read the like, especially when all the other Lords encouraged and gave her good
words: As for the further examination of the business afterward and
commitment of the Priest, it proceeded only from the other Lords, not him, who
did all he could to dant the Witnesses, and conceal the Conspiracy; which if
fully prosecuted at that time, might have prevented the bloody Massacres which
have since been made in Ireland and England, in prosecution of the same
Design, to advance the Catholic Cause, and reduce us back to our prestine
Romish thraldom and superstitions: Thirdly, for Habernfields plot, it is true,
upon the first discovery of it to him in the general only, when he deemed it
to be a conspiracy plotted and prosecuted only by Puritans, he acquainted the
King therewith, which we confess in our Evidence; but as soon as he received
the full discovery of it, and found the parties engaged in it to be Papists,
Priests, Jesuits, and some of his own creatures, confederates therein
particularized, (as Secretary Windebanke, Sir Toby Matthew, and others about
the Court,) he presently sets down, proceeds no farther in it, conceales his
papers to himself, not discovering them to King, Counsel, Parliament, nor
endeavoring to apprehend, examine the parties named in it, when present, and
some of them questioned, yea impeached in Parliament for some particulars
relating to it: Which concealment of his, of a most desperate Treason and
Conspiracy, thus circumstantiated in a case of such grand concernment to the
safety of the King, Kingdom, Church and Protestant Religion, we conceive to be
a high and treasonable offense, tending only to advance those popish Designs
to subvert our Religion, and subject us unto Rome, which have ever since been
prosecuted by the selfsame parties, faction, with an higher hand and more
open face of late, then ever heretofore: That this plot was not a fiction,
(unless only in that which concerns himself, wherein he knew there were
some mistakes, he being not so odious at Rome as it seems to make him,) but a
real truth in all or most particulars which concern our Religion; his own
Diary, his endorsments on it together with our dear-bought experience, and late
Discoveries concurring with it, fully evidence. His own co^viction therefore of
its reality should have enduced him, if not to prosecute, yet at leastwise to
have revealed itto the Parliament, that they might have fifted it to the Bran,
which he never did; Master Prynnes seizing it in his Chamber, to his great
grief, being the only means to bring it unto light: His argument, that it
makes most of any thing for the justification of his sincerity to our Religion,
and opposition to Popery, aggravates, not extenuates his offense in concealing
it, because then he had more reason to disclose it, as well for his own
vindication from scandal, as the public safety of our King, Church, Religion;
but his engagements to this confederated Popish party, and the Advancment of
their cause were such, that he preferred them before his own private pretended
justification, or the safety of all these coupled together: Wherefore he still
remains under the guilt, weight of this and all other the Commons
forementioned particular charges, notwitstanding all his Answers, Defenses to
enervate or elude them: And therefore upon this first general Branch of his
Charge, the Commons prayed Judgment against him from the House of Peers, as
the Archest Traitor, the cunningest Underminer Subverter of of our established
Religion, the greatest Advancer of Popery, and most sedulous Agent to reduce us
back to Rome, of any Archbishop or pretender to the Protestant Religion, that
our English Soil or the Christian world have ever bred; concluding in the
Poets words, Dij talem terris avertite Pestem.

The remaining Branches of whose Charge and Trial, we shall (God willing)
contract into a lesser Volume, and publish with convenient speed; in each
Branch whereof, he will appear as Criminal, as Treasonable, as Arch a
Malefactor as in this, wherein he most protested, most labored to assert his
Innocence against so many pregnant Evidences and clear Demonstrations of his
guiltiness, as will render him most execrable to all true Protestants for
eternity, however some have already enrolled him in their lying Legends, for a
most glorious Martyr, and more meritorious Saint, then ever his traitorous
Predecessor Becket was; whose Treasons and other grand Misdemeanors, were
far inferior both in quantity, quality, and a trocity unto his.
