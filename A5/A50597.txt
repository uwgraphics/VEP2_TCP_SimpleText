In behalf of the Purchasers of Forfeited Lands in IRELAND.
It is most humbly offered to the Consideration of the Honorable the Commons
of England, How far the Remedy prescribed, by the Bill now before Them, will be
Effectual, where the Grantees, who should repay the Purchase-Money, are beyond
Seas; or where (if they have not spent the Money they received) they can alien
their Estates, and will have Personal Privilege, etc.

And in regard the said Honorable House has shown Compassion to the Irish
Papists, who are Restored and Pardoned by His Majesty's Favor, 260863 l.
where their Estates are Valued at near Two hundred and seventy thousand Pounds;

It is humbly hoped, That they will also extend their Humanity and Goodness to
the English Protestant Purchasers of Legal Titles for very Valuable
Considerations, who have lost their Friends and ventured their Lives in the
Service of England against such Irish; And that the said Honorable House may
think it Reasonable to let their Principal Purchase-Money (which does not
exceed 63000 l. 63000 l.
in the whole) be considered as Encumbrances on the Lands so Purchased, in the
nature of Mortgages, and the Purchasers to be accountable as Mortgagees, from
the time their respective Purchases were made, until redeemed by the Public:

Whereby the Public will get, besides the Overplus of Legal Interest, where
any such has been received,

I. All their Improvements on the Lands, and in Building and Repairing Houses,
etc. which are very considerable.

II. The Benefit of the Bargains, where the Purchasers have bought off
Encumbrances and Prior Titles.

III. The Benefit of what the Purchasers expended in many Cases, in evicting
illegal Titles and unjust Pretenses: Not to mention

What they and their Friends have suffered in Enniskillen, Londonderry, and
elsewhere, in the late Troubles of that Country.

Note: Many of the Purchasers were induced to Purchase from some former
Proceedings of the Honorable Commons of England.
