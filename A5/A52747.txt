AN ANSWER TO A DECLARATION OF The Lords and Commons, concerning the Papers of
the Scots Commissioners.

the new Propositions of Peace, and the four Bills to be sent to his Majesty.

By Mercurius Pragmaticus.

AN ANSWER TO THE late Declaration of the Lords and Commons, of the Parliament
of ENGLAND.
ALthough we are not ignorant how many obstructions have of late been
occasioned, by those who pretend a more then ordinary zeal to a speedy
settlement, and a composure of those unhappy differences, which (but that the
providence of the Highest prevailed) had ere this, buried the two Kingdoms of
England and Scotland, in an united ruin, yet we shall not waste time now, to
cite either the Impediments or the parties, contenting our selves only with a
free and full answer, to the late Declaration of the Lords, and Commons
Assembled in the Parliament of England which we look upon, as a mere bundle
of invictives, and an heepe of Callumnies for throughout the whole book not
one clause, but savours of malice, rancour and contempt, but indeed what else
but gall, can flow from the quill, of that impudent Reviler of his King, and
notorious Incendiarie, between the two Kingdoms, Harry Martin, who (as we are
credibly informed) was the composer of the said Declaration, but we shall hold
it; altogether beneaneth us, to castigate Callumnies, of the said Martin, in a
public way, and shall now proceed, to take to pieces, the late Declaration, to
Diffect, and anotomize it, that so the whole proportion of it being open to the
view of the world, they may be informed, of its imperfect perfectness.

First then they Declare, that they were put upon this Declaration, in answer
to those Papers entitled, The answer of the Commissioners of Scotland, to both
Houses of Parliament upon the new Propositions of peace, and four Bills to be
sent to his Majesty to undeceive the minds of the people of both Kingdoms, as
if our fallacies were such, that it is high time they were discovered, and that
we had deceived our trust, and by under hand and sinister practices, sought our
own and not our Nations welfare, but we shall not need, to bestow much labor,
in wiping away the stain, since our own Nation are not the least anxious of
our fidelity, neither will it be a work worthy the undertaking to release
their constant perfidiousnesse even from their first day of sitting; and we
should but carry pots to Samos and Owls, to Athens, if we should tell, they
have betrayed their trust to God, by breaking the Covenant, to their King by
trampling upon the Oath of Allegiance, and to their Country, by prostrating
their power, and suffering themselves to be overawed, by a Sectarian Army, who
are (or ought to be) wholly at their disposing, but they are not contented to
brand us with Apostacy, but they also would give the world to think that our
power is trivial, and invallid for they say.

We desire it may be remembered, that when we speak of the Commissioners of
Scotland, we intend not throughout the whole Declaration, the Kingdom of
Scotland who we rest confident will not own their Commissioners in these
Papers, in their transactions in the Isle of Wight, nor in many other of their
Papers, and proceedings when they shall be truly informed of their carriage,
but that the Kingdom of Scotland will be ready to do us and themselves right.

Here they have turned their Galls up, and spit the worst of Venom, for
because themselves would not be thought the least guilty (as it has everbeen
the manner of persons, the most nocent, and obnoxious) to stand high upon their
reputations they cast aspersions upon us and think themselves sufficiently
vindicated if we are disparaged, in regard whereof we have a just occasion, to
return to them their own words according to their own practices, and tell
them, That all the Rhetorique used in this point, to abuse the minds of well
minded people, and to heighten their fancies against our proceedinge might have
been spared, but we see their aim, and that they have an ardeut desire still
to keep themselves in the Saddle had they ability, to manage the Steed, and
indeed to cause so implacable an hatred between the two Kingdoms, as all the
Heccatombes, of after entreaties may not expiate.

And that it may be so as soon as may be they proceed, to make their and our
Sovereign Lord King CHARLES, incapable of Governing, and themselves of
obeying, and this contrary to all law and reason they will prove with their
wild Sophistry to be both good and requisite, when they say.

We ask what reason we have to respect better satisfaction, in the way of a
treaty them formerly at Vxbridge, or in a personal treaty at Oxford, unless
we be resolved to Treat away all that we have fought for, and to be Treated
out of what we could not be fought out of, or at least what can we expect of a
Treaty but under pretense of satisfying all interests, one interest shall be
set up against an another to devide us, and that thereby (having laid no
foundation of safety before hand the King might set up his interest above them
all, if success, and advantage of the crown in the Kings esteem must be the
measure of our resolutions, or that hereby we must have the way, or terms of
our peace cut out unto us.

Thus they make themselves no longer fellow subjects with us, and that by the
right of conquest, as having our in pieces with the sword, both the Covenant
and the Oath of Allegiance, and so render themselves to the world, as persons
who are no better then doubly perjuried; have they so soon, or else are they
wicked as not to remember, how we once jointly Sollemnly protested with lift up
hands to the most High God; that we had no intention to curtaile his Majesty
of any of the least of his lawful Privileges, but that with our utmost
endeavors we would assay to reinstate his Majesty's in his Pristine Glory and
Dignity, and having instated him to defend Him with our utmost abillities and
had we apprehended that the least injury or violence would have been committed
against his Majesty's Royal Person as it was offered at Holdenby, and reported
to be Hampton, or if we had not received a faithful assurance of the Houses,
that their intentions were cordial and Loyal toward him, not all the
threatenings, or allurments, in the world should have persuaded us, to have
parted with his Majesty's Person, till all Armies had been disbanded and the
peace of the Kingdom settled, it was our brotherly confidence in the Houses,
who are (or ought to be) our fellow subjects, that moved us to surrender the
King into their hands and therefore all the world cannot but assoile us and
acknowledge our innocence and fidellity to the King; and that when we
delivered him into the hands of these Commissioners appointed for that purpose,
by both Houses, of Parliament we had no thought not were left privy to their
treacherous intentions toward him, but that we were then we are now his Loyal
humble subjects, willing to submit to all his lawful commands with submissive
obedience, as to, our King and Sovereign.

But they go on in their cavills, and would endeavor to prove by Sophistria,
that which they have no warrant for, either by law or conscience, when they
tell us.

We say that that the Scots Commissiones mistake their aim, if they think
the Kings presence with the Parliament, necessarily implies his presence at
London, which he and they so much desire, that he might have oppertunity, to
cajole the Citizens; if his presence with the Parliament were nenecessary, yet
it is not necessary, the Parliament be at London, and as much do they mistake
the Parliaments Declarations, if they think it was the Kings Local absent
from his Parliament which they Declared to be the chief cause of all the war
mischief, and callamities of the Kingdoms, any otherwise then it was his
distance from them, in affections and his oppositions, to their counsels, and
endeavors.

What odd Silogismes are here, let the world judge, whether the Houses, were it
in their power, would not take away Monarchical Government, Root, and Branch,
although it be the very basis, whereon ours and their Privileges are built,
and the maine pillar that supporteth the Parliament House, the Devil is a good
Sophister, and dictates notably unto them, if the Kings presence be necessary
at London, yet it is not necessary the Parliament should be at London, as if
the Kings presence at London, and siting amongst them, in a Parliamentarie way
could prove the Cajoling, of the Citizens who we believe are now become so
weary of their tyranie, that they would be glad to be once more under his
Majesty's command, were he in the same posture of governing, that he was ere
they began the war, rather then to continre any longer, under a constrained
obedience to them, but what makes their averinesse a miracle, is because his
Majesty has been graciously pleased to proffer the signing to an act of
Oblivion, and is content to cover all former impieties, under his own skirts,
but it seems to us (and surely to all honest men) more then monstrous that the
Houses who once told us it was their chief sorrow that the King would not sit
with them, and made the world believe as they persuaded us, that the cause of
their war, was to recover his person amongst them, should now publish to the
world that his presence amongst them, is utterly unnecessary, as if it were
possible toperswade us or any possesed with sense, that they who were called
together by him, act all in his name and because of his distance from them,
have done nothing these seven years, to prove they are a Parliament, save
(perhaps) to defend themselves; and to command in his name, should now on the
sudden be enriched with so much power, from whence derived none knows as
without him to make laws and Statutes unless they intend (which wickedness
Heaven hinder them from) to depose him, and illegitimate his children, but the
truth is, for ought we see, or can gather, by their fore pass actions and
present proceedings, they never intend to settle the Kingdom, either with him
or without him with him (it seems) they dread to do, being conscious of their
own guilt, and without him they cannot, nay but shall not do it, while we are
a Nation, but had not their consciences been seared with an hot Iron, they
might ere this have been reconciled to their King, and he to them, the Royal
party appersed, the City quitted the Country contented, and every man sitting
under his own Vine would their wickedness have permitted them, to have done
so much good for themselves, and their Nation, how often have we sued unto them
to pity their own, and the Kingdoms estate, how often have we implored them,
that there might be a free and unrestrained application made to his Majesty
from the Parliaments of both Kingdoms desiring them to invite his Majesty to
come to London, and to declare that he should be there with safety honor and
freedom then which we see, no other probable means to obtain a safe and well
grounded peace, and this is no more then they and we are obliged to do,
according to our Covenant Allegiance, and duty of subjects.

But now we see, and it is too apparent to the world, that they respect not
either Religion, the Interest of the Crown, or the Union and joint concernment
of both Kingdoms; and because we charged them, and that upon good grounds, to
tolerate all Religions, and to be remiss in looking after the matters of God;
They say,

What are those matters which these Commissioners call the matters of God? Are
they the names Solemn League and Covenant, or the things contained in the
Solemn League and Covenant? And if so, why not one thing as well as another?
Why are not the Privileges and Authority of Parliament, formerly acquiesced
in, as the surest Pillars and preservatives of Religion? And why are not the
Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom matters of God, as well as the Government
of the Church, in such and such a form? Of old the Clergy styled their
Temporalities and Possessions the Patrimony of Christ, and the quarrel
between them and the State the Cause of God, and a matter of Religion, though
indeed it was a contest only of power and dominion, which indeed, if it be
well looked into, will prove also the state of many questions, which go under
the notion of Religion at this day.

What a most learned evasion do they here make, to justify their breach of
Covenant? Do they think these quodlibets will answer the expectations, or
settle the hearts of an incensed Nation? It seems by this, that when they
entered into League with us, they swore with a mental reservation, and intended
to make application in such manner as might most make for their own advantage;
If they keep up their extorted power without diminution, if they attempt with
their utmost endeavors, to make themselves absolute and Arbitrary Lords; (...)
themselves, and be their under (...) famous, we must (...) with all
willingness, they give us a strong motive, which is, The Privileges of
Parliament ought to be acquiesced in, as the surest Pillars and preservatives
of Religion: so that whatsoever they please to call the Rights and Liberties of
the Kingdom, be it either in Imprisoning their King, or in tolerating a
hodge-podge of all Religions; or be it in inslaving and trampling upon their
fellow Subjects, it must be termed with no worse title then the matters of
God; but they do very notably, to make the custom of the old Clergy their
example, (though they would not have us to think so) since with them they call
all Causes Gods, provided they be feeling causes, and make either for their
profit or preferment; in regard whereof, we cannot but tell them, that they are
the vilest Hypocrites, we say not Treachers, that live, and that never men like
them ever showed themselves in such various colors, while according to their
own saying of others, they seemingly strive to purchase a perfect Reformation,
when indeed, it is only a contest of power and Dominion, and a little to vary
from their words, will prove also the state of all their undertakings which go
under the notion of Religion: but they proceed to justify (as, what is it that
they will not defend?) And because we are so credulous, they hope to persuade
us into a belief of any thing; And therefore they say,

It is one thing to leave every man without any Law to his own judgment and
fancy, in the service and worship of God, and another thing to give a Liberty
by Law (as was desired) to some men to do some things in their own nature not
unlawful, though different from what is thought fit to be generally settled in
the Kingdom; it is one thing to require conformity to a Law already made,
according to the word of God; and upon clear evidence thereof, another thing,
to make a Law requiring conformity from all persons, to all things, though not
founded upon any clear evidence of Scripture, or that are only founded upon
prudentiall grounds, wherein the Magistrate has the like latitude to dispense
and qualify, as to injoyne and ordain; it is one thing what a State holds sit
to declare requisite, and also to countenance and encourage by rewards; and
other ways, and another thing, when it holds fit to compel and force.

We confess, That there is some difference between compulsion and permission,
and that a Free State (which epethite we hope the Houses will not, nor dare
not assume to themselves) may upon prudentiall grounds tolerate a Liberty in
the worship of God; but all this while we are confident, that they cannot do
so and not be guilty of grievous sin; for who is so shallow not to conceive,
or so obstinate not to confess, that where such a toleration is granted, many
Prophanations must inevitably follow? For who ever knew or read, but that when
men are permitted to worship God in their own way, without limitation or
prescription, they for the most fall in one error or other? but we perceive,
that the Houses, so themselves may be tolerated, to sit and sway without
disturbance, care not what Religion their Vassailes are of; as the Turks, who,
so their slaves perform their service, mind not whether they call upon Christ
or Mahomet; nor care they, though by their impious toleration a door be opened
to Atheism and all Religions, to all kind of Licentiousness, to Deformity,
and Multiformitie of Heresies and Sects, which may produce the ruin of
Religion in both Kingdoms: What a gross absurdity is it of them, yea, worthy
to be laughed at, to make a Law for the establishing of the Presbyterian
Government, and yet in the same Act to desire that none should obey that Law,
but such as are pleased so to do? and again, to appoint the Ministers and
Elders by an Ordinance, to suspend from the Sacrament only such persons as the
Houses have thought fit and no other, though it be against their conscience so
to do, and that they are bound with several restrictions in their meetings
and assemblies, and are not allowed the use and exercise of all the ordinances,
appointed by the word of God; so as that Liberty of Conscience is denied to
them, and granted to others who have an unlimited toleration for the time of
indurance, matter of worship, and exercise of all Ordinances; which toleration
is of that capacity and latitude, that it admits of many vile and gross
errors, which have been condemned and cast out of the Church in former times.
And now for the nice distinction that they make concerning their own powers as
Magistrates, to countenance or compel as they find cause, it is clear both by
the word of God and humane examples, that a toleration ought not to be
permitted, and that the events of such countenancings and encouragements as
they speak of, have ever produced sad and fatal events. But all this while
they have but proved themselves Apostates, and relinquishers of those
Principles which they once bound themselves to prosecute, and therefore must
expect fierce vengeance and condign punishments hereafter.

But because we once demanded of them, according to our duty to God, and
allegiance to our Sovereign, whether a Toleration shall be continued to all
such, as by their pernicious Doctrines and Actions offer violence to the Kings
Person and Authority, and in a high degree violate every Article of the
Solemn League and Covenant; they say,

That neither to all such, nor to any such, is a Toleration desired: but who
do more undermine the Security of the Kings Person and Authority, then those
that hinder a happy Settlement between him and his People, by a causeless
dissenting from the Houses of Parliament, in those few necessary things
desired by them, as previous to a Treaty upon the rest, and that boulster him
up in Counsels and Resolutions so apparently destructive to himself, his
Authority, and Posterity, who so highly have invaded the Privileges of
Parliament, in the cases of particular Members thereof?

Were it so, as the contrary is too apparent, that no such Toleration be
desired; yet sure it well becomes loyal and faithful subjects strictly to
forbid and prohibit all such wild courses. But it is apparent, yea (and to our
shame) is become the talk of foreign Nations, that they not only tolerate
but encourage their Independent Ministers, on all occasions and oportunities,
to rail against their Sovereign, to scandalize his fore-past Acts of
Government, and to exasperate the people against Monarchical Discipline. Nor
is this impiety permitted in Pulpits alone, but also frequently in Print,
while their Pamphleters are countenanced to rail against him, as a vile and
unworthy man, one not meet to sway the Scepter; a man of blood, who ought to be
called to an account for those Cruelties that were practiced during the War.

But this we have no reason to marvel at, since the Houses themselves have
given those Varlets so pregnant an example to imitate, as appears by a
Declaration put forth in their Names, and entitled, A Declaration of the Lords
and Commons assembled in Parliament, showing the Reasons and Grounds why they
have voted, that no more Addresses be made to the King, nor any Message
received from him. And although it does wonderfully astonish us to think, that
so illegal and destructive a Vote should ever be, yet we cannot but wonder
much more, that so strange a Paradox should be maintained in Print, and that by
the appointment of the Houses, since we and the world know, that that
disloyal Vote was against the very essence and being of Parliaments; and that
when they Voted no further Addresses should be made to the King, they Voted
themselves no Parliament, if they will credit the fundamental Laws of their
Land. But our souls are smitten with sorrow, and with unspeakable horror, when
we cogitate the matter and substance of that Declaration; wherein the Houses
(swayed by we know not what Furies) have not spared to tax his Majesty as
accessarie to the poisoning of his Father; a thing not to be thought on, and
from which we are confident his Majesty is as clear as he was at the hour
of his Birth: as also they charge him to have a hand in the Business of
Rochel, with other Crimes and Misdemeanors, in such contemptuous and
diversivolent language, that we have cause to suspect they are mad, and by
some fatal accident are bereft of their wits. But we would feign know of
them, since themselves can so easily dispense with all Oaths and Covenants,
and have cast behind them all the duty and allegiance they owe unto their
Sovereign; whether, or no, we his subjects of Scotland shall be prohibited by
them from making any further Addresses to, or receiving a Message from him? For
how ere they (elated with their successes) are pleased to taunt us, as
contemptible; yet we would have them know, that we esteem our selves equally
interessed in the person of the King; and though he be in their repute but a
dead Dog, yet he is in our sight a living Lion. But whereas they say, and that
in reference to us, That none more undermine the Security of the Kings Person
and Authority, then those that hinder a happy Settlement between Him and His
People, by a causeless Dissenting: We answer; What dis-affection did they
ever find in us? If they have, let them divulge it, as we are sure they would
not have forgotten to do, had they had the least color or pretext: But we
perceive the ground of their Malice is, for that we joined not with them, and
were not urgent upon his Majesty for the signing of the last four Bills;
which Bills were destructive to Religion, his Majesty's Authority, and the
Amity of the two Kingdoms; and therefore we could not in Conscience or Honor
join (...) them: either let them say how and by what means we boulster him
up in Counsels and Resolutions, apparently destructive to himself, his
Authority, and Posterity; if they mean; that our Protestations to be loyal
subjects unto him, according to Gods command, and the Oath that we have taken,
be a boulstring of him, then we must tell them, that we do but our duty,
and what they ought to do, were they not Rebellious; and we fear their own
wickedness does so boulster up themselves, that they will go in a trance to
Hell, and sink ere they are aware of it: But their Conquests does so puff
them up, that they imagine themselves safe even from the Arm of Heaven; and
they resolve (it seems) since they have brought their King on his knees, not
to pardon him, though he beg it, nor to smile upon him, though he kiss the
Rod; and therefore they tell us:

We say, the King having stood it out to the last, and being reduced to the
condition he is in, the Houses making so often applications unto him; and after
all, making him such an Offer, as upon his granting them, those few necessary
things (which upon no terms, nor upon any Treaty, they can recede from) to
treat upon all the rest, affords a greater and more solid ground of
confidence to the King, then any thing he can do for the Parliament does give
them; for what can he give them, but what they have already?

That the King stood it out to the last, none can deny; but that he should be
reduced to the condition he is in, we are utterly to seek: we grant, the
Houses made several applications to the King, but their Propositions were too
high, and (indeed) so destructive to his Majesty's power, that we see not how
he could either in Conference or Honor sign them: but for the four last
Bills, the Houses had learnt by their former applications, and they knew right
well, that his Majesty would by no means assent to them, for that (to speak
truth) they were merely Impositions, and not Propositions; and to us it
seems, they rather devised them as an occasion to quarrel with him, that so
they might have some pretense to Vote as they did afterward, rather then out
of any real intent that his Majesty should sign them, and so a personal
Treaty ensue. But whereas they boastingly say, that the King can give them
nothing but what they have already; We answer, That there is a very vast
difference between an usurpt fruition, and a peaceable legal enjoyment: It Is
truth, they have now his Revenue, his Navy, Castles, and Magazine, wholly in
their own hands, but can that take them off from yielding obedience to his
lawful commands, or make him incapable of exercising his Kingly power? Surely
no: God Almighty open the hearts of the two Houses, that they may consider and
repent them, and let them know, that we will leave no way or means
unattempted, to restore our Sovereign to his full, and former power and
greatness.

FINIS.
