^ See, See in the Smiling Month of May,
^ ye Songsters, of ye Grove ye Play,
^ just, just Such a poor, poor, poor young thing as they,
^ a little, little Bird So very Small,
^ that just can tattle, Chirp and prattle,
^ I can but Sing, and Oh, Oh, and Oh, and Oh, Oh, that's all,
^ But if I Live till past Fifteen,
^ See Such fine Sparks as here are Seen,
^ I fear I fear you will teach me then to perch
^ and plum and dress and pride,
^ and more then tattle, Chrip and prattle,
^ I then Shall Sing, Shall Sing, and Love, Love, Love Shall Sing and Love,
besid'e,
^ Shall Sing, and Love, Love, Love, Shall Sing and Love beside.

^ must not, shall not Steal away;
^ What wooed Jockey now do too me,
^ Surely your to me unkind,
^ I'se nere See you nay you fly me,

Tell me why it is thus you use me,
Take me quickly to your Arms,
Where in bllisses blithly basking,
Each may rival the Other's Charm's,
O but fie my Jocky pray now,
What do you; do not; let me go,
O I vow you will undo me,
what to do I do not know.
