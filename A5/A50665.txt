To All Gentlemen Landlords, and other knowing Persons of this Kingdom.
Worthy Sirs,
HAving formerly had several Doubts and Quaere's in my mind, upon some
particular Cases which oftentimes come in question betwixt Landlords and their
Tenants, and being desirous to satisfy my self in those points; I thereupon
made it my Study and Recreation at some spare hours to search and collect some
choice Cases, (out of the Reports and other Works of several Learned and Grave
Judges, and other Sages of the Law) touching the Covenants, Conditions, Grants,
Provisoes, Reservations, Exceptions, Surrenders, Assignments, and many other
things concerning Leases; as also touching Distresses, Rescous, Avowries,
Replevins, Waste, and other matters often coming in debate between Landlords
and their Tenants, as appears in the several Chapters hereafter in this small
Treatise. Which little Manual at the first undertaking was intended only for
private use, and a Vade mecum for my own Pocket; but having since communicated
it to some special Friends and knowing Gentlemen, they have been very
importunate with me for the publishing of it; at whose requests (they being my
very intimate Friends and Acquaintance) I have now adventured this small
imperfect Treatise to the public view. If it find Acceptance it will be much
Satisfaction to him who is,

Gentlemen, Your humble Servant, GEORGE MERITON.

CHAP. I. Of Leases: Who may make them, and for what Term; and Who are called
Tenants for Life, Tenants for term of Years, at Will and Sufferance.
LEASE is derived from Bract. lib. 4. fo. 220. Fleta lib. 3. cha. 12. Coo. on
Lit. f. 43. b.
Leapum or Leasum, for that the Lessee comes in by Lawful means; and Dimittere
is in French Laisser, to depart with or forgo.

In every Lease there must be Terms of the Law. verb. Lesser and Lessee.
Lessor, and Lessee: he which lets the Land is called the Lessor; and he which
farms it is called the Lessee.

A Lease for Years of Lands and Tenements, is good as well without Deed as with
Deed; but of a Common or Rent, etc. it is not good without Deed.

If a Lease for Years be made 42 Eliz. in C. B. Butts Case. Co. 7. par. f. 23.
reserving Rent, it must be of Lands and Tenements, whereunto the Lessor may
have resort to distrain; and therefore 30 Ass. p. 5. 12 Ass. 20. 20 E. 4. 10.
Co. 1 par. Instit. f. 47. a.
a Rent cannot be reserved by a common person out of any Incorporeal
Inheritance, as Advowsons, Commons, Offices, Corrody, Mulcture of a Mill,
Tithes, Fairs, Markets, Liberties, Franchises, etc. But if the Lease be made by
Deed in writing of them, one may have an Action of Debt by way of Contract, but
distrain one cannot: but if any Rent be reserved in such Cases upon a Lease for
Life, it is utterly void. 3 Jac. in C. B. Bp of Bath's Case. Co. 6* par. f. 34,
35 40 Eliz. Rector of Chedington's Case. Co. 1 par. f. 155, 156. Bract. l. 2.
c. 9. Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 45. b.


Every Lease for years must be for a time certain, and ought to express the
Term, and when it should begin, and when it should end. And yet there may be a
certainty in an uncertainty sometimes; for the Rule is, Id certum est, quod
certum reddi potest: therefore look in the 4 Chapter, and you will find some
pretty Cases there about this Rule.

If a man have a Lease of 32 lib. Ass. 6.
Lands for 500 years, it is but a Chattel, and falls to his Executors or
Administrators after his death, if he do not otherwise dispose of it in his
lifetime.

Every one seized of an absolute Cowell Inst. p. 189.
pure Estate in Fee-simple, may make a Lease of his Lands for as long a time as
he pleases; and so might Bishops, etc. before they were restrained by Statute.
See 32 H. 8. c. 28. 13 El. Coo. 1 par. of Inst. f. 44. a. b. Noye's Maxims, p.

Tenant in Tail, being of full age, by* Indenture in writing may make a Lease
of such Lands and Inheritances as have been formerly letten to Farm for the
space of 20 years next before the Lease made; or if it be but letten 11 years
at one or several times within those 20, it is sufficient, reserving the old
Rent or more; without impeachment of Waste must not be in it, and it must
commence from the day of the making or from the making: and if there be an old
Lease in being, it must be either surrendered, expired or ended within one year
after the making of the new one, or else it is not good; except in the Case of
a Bishop, which you will find afterward. And if the Lease be thus made, it
binds the Issue of Tenant in Tail, if he die before the Term be out: but if he
die without Issue, the Donor may avoid the Lease by Entry; and so may he in
Remainder; and though he accept the Rent, yet it shall not affirm the Lease.

The Husband seized in Fee-simple Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 44. Cowell's Inst. p. 189
Noye's Maxims, p. 69.
or Fee-Tail in right of his Wife may make such a Lease of his Wife's Land, by
Indenture in writing, in the name of the Husband and Wife, and she to seal
thereunto; and the Rent must be reserved to the Husband and his Wife, and to
the Heirs of the Wife, according to her Estate of Inheritance: and this shall
bind her and her Heirs after his death.

Bishops, Deans and Chapters, Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 44. a. Cowel's Inst. p. 189.
Parsons Law, p. 29.
etc. seized of any Estate in Fee in right of their Churches, observing the
Rules aforesaid, may make Leases: and so may Masters and Fellows of Colleges,
and Wardens of Hospitals, if their private Statutes will permit them.

But note well, that Tenant Co. ubi supra. 32 H. 8. cap. 28.
in Tail and the persons before named, though they do observe these Rules, yet
they cannot let for any longer term then Three Lives, or 21 years, but for what
term they will under.

If Tenant in Tail or any of the aforesaid persons observe Co. 1 par. Inst. f.
45. a.
not these Rules in their Demises, yet notwithstanding the Leases shall be good
against them for their Lives.

And if a Lease be made by a Bishop for 21 years, according Co. 1 par. Inst. f.
45. a. Pasc. 28 El. in B. R. The Countess of Sussex's Case. Leonard's Rep. 1
par. 131. Parsons Law p. 27, 28. Vide Hern's Law of Conv. p. 69, 70.
to the Rules aforesaid, which is spent within 3 years or more, now if the
Bishop make a new Lease to another for 21 years, to commence from the making,
which is confirmed by the Dean and Chapter, this is a good Lease, and the
second Lessee may enter when the first Lease is out, and hold for the Remainder
of his term of 21 years then to come.

Demise, Grant, Betake to Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 45. b. Bro. Leases 60. 37 H. 8.
Farm-let, and whatsoever words amount to a Grant, may serve to make a Lease.

Generally now every Lessee Terms de Ley, verb. Farm.
for Life, Years, or at Will, although it be of never so small a Cottage or
house, is called a Farmor or Fermor, and the premises he possesses are called
a Farm or Ferm.

But formerly the chief Mesuage ibid.
in a Village or Town, whereunto belonged great Demesnes of all sorts, which
were used to be let for term of Life, Years, or at Will, was called a Farm or
Ferm.

They are called Farms or Ferms of the Saxon word Feormion, ibid.
which signifies to feed or yield Victuals; for in ancient time their
Reservations were for the most part in Victuals, until at the last, and that
chiefly in the time of K. H. 1. by agreement, the Reservation of Victuals was
turned into Money, and so hitherto has continued amongst most men.

Under the name of Lands are comprehended not only Gardens, Meadows, Pastures,
Rivers, Woods, Moors, Waters, Marshes, Furzes and Heath; but also Mesuages,
Houses, Tofts, Mills, Castles, and such like.

If the Lessor seal the Indenture, Noye's Maxims, p. 57. Finch, l. 2. cap. 2.
p. 109.
and not the Lessee, yet it is as good against the Lessor as if both had sealed.

And if at any time there happen Noye's Maxims, p. 57. Lit. 88. 14 Eliz.
Finch, l. 2. c. 2. p. 109.
any variance between the Indentures, it shall be taken as the Deed of the
Lessor is, and the other shall be intended only the misprision of the writer:
for the Lessor's is the principal Deed, and the other but only a Counterpane.

Now we have spoken briefly something concerning Leases, and who may make them,
we shall next speak something of the several sorts of Tenants mentioned in this
Treatise, and so conclude this Chapter.

Tenant for Life is he who Lit. Tenures, lib. 1. c. 6. Noye's Maxims, p. 30.
has Lands or Tenements for his own or another man's Life; and this Tenant has
a Freehold, but none other of lesser Estate has a Freehold.

If a man be Tenant for term Co. 1 par. Inst* fo. 42* a.
of his own Life, he has an higher Estate then he that is Tenant for another
man's Life.

Tenant for term of Years Lit. Tenures, l. 1^. Co. 1 par. Inst. ^^. 43. b. 44.
a.
is, where a man lets Lands of Tenements to another for a certain term of
Years, as it is agreed between them; and when the Lessee enters, he is then
Tenant for term of years and if the Lessor reserve to him a Rent, he may either
distrain on the premises, or have an Action of Debt, if the Rent be arrear.

There needs no Livery and Co. 1 par. Inst. f. ^8. a.
Seisin to be given upon a Lease for Years, but the Lessee may enter when he
will; but a Lessee for Life must have Livery, or else no Freehold passes.

If a man make a Lease by paroll Lit. Tenures, l. 1. Finch, l. 2. cap. 2. p.
109. 38 H. 8. Br. Estoppel 8.
to another, it behooves that he be seized of the Lands or premises at the time
of the Lease made; for else the Lessee may plead that the Lessor had nothing in
the premises at the time of the Lease made, and then he is barred of his
Action: but if it be by Indenture in writing, then the Lessee cannot plead this
Plea.

Tenant at Will is, where Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 55. a. Fleta, l. 3. c. 15.
Lands or Tenements are let by one man to another, to have and hold to him at
the Will of the Lessor: now when the Lessee enters, he is Tenant at Will, and
the Lessor may put him out when he pleases.

But if a man let Lands to another Coo. ib.
by Lease, to hold the same during the Will of the Lessee, in this case the Law
intends it to be at the Will of the Lessor also, and he may put him out when he
pleases. The same Law is if it be at the Will of the Lessor, it is intended at
the Lessee's Will also, for the Lessor cannot force him to stay longer then he
pleases.

Tenant at sufferance is he Co. 1 par. Inst. f. ^7. b. Brac. lib. 4. f. 318. 21
H. 6. f. 42. Kitchen, f. 238. a. 4 E. 3. 35. 24 E. 3.24. F. N. B. 201. D. Plow.

who comes in by lawful Lease, and keeps possession after his Lease is out,
and wrongfully holds over. Finch lib. 2. cap. 3. As Tenant for Life of I. S.
who holds over after the death of the said I. S.

The Lessor cannot have an Coo. ubi supra.
Action of Trespass against such Tenant before his Entry into the Premises.

CHAP. II. Of the Covenants, Conditions, Grants, Proviso's, Reservations,
Exceptions, Surrenders, Assignments, etc. of Leases.
IF the Lessor Covenant to 38 Eliz. Sir Anthony Mayn's Case. Co. 5 par. f. 20.
Noy's Maxims, p. 13. Hughes* grand Abr. 1 par. p. 487. c. 16.
make a new Lease upon Surrender of the old Lease, and afterward he makes a
Lease by Fine for more years to a Stranger, here the Covenant is broken,
although the Lessee did not Surrender, the which by the words ought to be the
first Act; for that the Lessor did disable himself either to take the
Surrender, or make the new Lease.

If a man make a Lease for Noye's Maxims, p. 17. and 50. Dr. and Stud. lib. 1.
ca. 24.
Years, and the Lessee covenanteth and grants to pay to the Lessor, his Heirs
and Assigns, yearly during, etc. 10 pound; here if the Lessor die, the
Executors shall have the Rent arrear.

If a man covenant and grant 37 H. 8. Bro. ^eases 60. Kit. Court Leet, p. 235.
b.

But if the Condition had Dr. and Stud. ibid.

assigns, etc. but the Obligor has no notice of it; here the ignorance shall
excuse him, for the Obligee ought to give him notice: but if the Assignment had

justly according to Law; if before any day of payment I do put the Lessee out

before any day of payment the other two Copartners which did not consent to the

the day of payment of the Rent be incurred; yet it behooves the Lessee to pay
the Third part of the Rent reserved to his Lessor, otherwise he forfeits his

Lessee will hold over 10 years to him and his heirs, that he shall then pay 20
pound by the year, and Livery and Seisin is made to the Lessee accordingly; in
this case for the Rent behind within the 10 years the Lessor shall have an
Action of Debt, which proves the Freehold and the Fee are not in the Lessee
before the 10 years ended: but if when the ten years be past and ended the
Lessee does continue the possession of the same Land, and does occupy the Land
by force of the Indenture, then he has Fee, and shall pay the 20 pound as a
Rent sect. But if a M. 40 E. 3.27. Perkins, 711. Coo. 1 par. Inst. f. 218. b.

he shall have and hold the Land leased unto himself and his Heirs for ever; now
if he kill I. S. within the term, yet his Estate is not enlarged thereby,
because the Condition is against Law, and the Estate does begin to be enlarged
upon the performance of the Condition; yet the Lease is good, because the same
does not begin by the Condition.

upon Condition, that if the Lessor do aliene the Reversion within the term,
then the Lessee shall have Fee, and the Lessor does aliene the Reversion in Fee
by Fine to a Stranger; now in this case the Lessee shall not have Fee, for the
Freehold and the Fee are lawfully in the Conusee before the Lessee can take it
by Condition: but if the Lessor had granted by Deed only to a Stranger, then
the Lessee should have had Fee by the Condition; and the reason is, because the
Reversion is not in the Grantee before Attornment.

Release made; and it is a thing not merely in Action, because it may be granted

Moiety. Tamen quaere.

If a Lessee for Life of an Acre of Land lease the same Acre to his Lessor for
years, the Remainder to a Stranger in Fee; this is no Forfeiture, though he do

holds of him for Life or Years, and so wills him to enter; in this case if
the Lessor consent, it is a good Surrender.

Years of a House and Lands remove his goods out of the House and Land, by
reason of the greatness of the Rent, or because he is behind in his Rent, or

no Surrender of the Tenant.

If a Tenant for Life enfeoff 19 E. 3. Surr. 8. Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 42. a.

in Remainder takes wife and dies; in this case she shall not be endowed, for
the Tenant for Life shall enjoy the Land again, for it cannot be a Forfeiture,
because he in Remainder was a party; and Surrender it cannot be, for that his
whole Estate was not given.

If a Tenant for Life take an Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 42. a. 29 Ass. p. 64.

absolute Surrender, for the reasons in the last Case mentioned.

But if a Tenant for Life take Husband, and they by Deed indented make a Lease
to him in Reversion for the Life of the Wife, reserving Rent; this is a
Surrender, for their whole Estate is granted, and the Reservation is void.

and Martinmas, or within 15 days next after either of the said Feasts; in
this Case the Tenant need not pay till the 15th day, for that is the legal day,
and the other only a voluntary day of Payment: and if there be a Clause, that
if the Rent be behind by the space of 15 days after any of the said days of
payment, then the Lease to be void; in this case the Lessee shall have 30 days
after either of the Feasts to save his Lease: but if the Clause in the Lease
be, that if the Rent be behind for the space of 15 days next after either of
the said Feast-daies of payment; here the Tenant has but 15 days only
allowed him: and so the diversity is to be noted.

If a Tenant in Tail let part Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 44. b. Vid. Lord Mount-joy's
Case. Co. 5. l. f. 3. Anno 31, 32 Eliz. in B. R.
of the Land accustomably letten, reserving the Rent pro Rata or more, this is
a good Lease for such Lands: or if the accustomable Rent were formerly payable
at four Feasts, and now it is reserved and payable all at one Feast, yet it is
good enough.

If a man lease for Years, rendering 11 Jac. in B. R. Clun's Case. Co. 10 l. f.

Rent at the Feasts of the Annunciation and Michaelmas, or within 15 days
after; here if the Lessor die after either of the Feasts and before the 15 days
be out, the Heir shall then have the Rent; for the disjunctive is added for the
benefit of the Tenant; and the first day is but voluntary, but the legal
payment is at the end of the 15 days: and if the Lessee before the day pay the
Rent, this is voluntary, and not satisfactory; but it is good to give Seisin,
if payment be in the Morning and the Lessor die at Noon; though this payment be
voluntary too, yet it is satisfactory against the Heir.

to pay the Rent precisely; in this case he must seek the Lessor to pay him: but
if he be bound to perform the Covenants, etc. he may then tender it upon the
Land, (if no other place be agreed upon) and it suffices, for the payment is
of the nature of the Rent reserved.

Executors shall then have it.

Debt till all the days be expired; and so it is upon an Obligation; for these
are personal Contracts: but in case of a Lease for Years, which is a real
Contract, it is otherwise; for there the Lessor may have an Action of Debt
after every day, or he may distrain.

A man is not bound to pay an Annuity without an Acquittance, See in Pennant's

this Chapter.

The Lessor upon a Lease at Co. on ^it. f. 57. b.

the Lessee shall have the Land again for his Life, and the Rent is revived.

The Acceptance of the Rent 22 H. 8. Br. Acceptance 14.
upon a void Lease will not make the Lease good again; but Vide Browning's
Case. Pl. Co. 136.
if it be only voidable, it will.

The Acceptance of a Redemise to begin presently, is a Suspension Noye's
Maxims, p. 70.
of the Rent before any Entry; but otherwise if it be to begin in futuro.

Acceptance of a Rent which See Co. 3. l. in Pennant's Case there.
is not in Esse nor due to him that accepts it does not affirm the Lease: as
where Lands are given to the Husband and Wife, and the Heirs of the body of the
Husband, and he leases the same and dies, and the Issue accepts the Rent of the
Lessee in his Mother's life, and after she dies; now the Issue may avoid the
Lease, for when he accepted the Rent, it was due to his Mother, and not to him.

is worth nothing; for the Lease is void by Death: but it is otherwise of a
Lease for Life.

But if the Successor of a Bishop, Co. ibid. 2 F. 6 Br. ^eases 33. 32 H. 8.
Dyer 46.
Abbot or Prior, accept the Rent upon a Lease for Years, he shall never avoid
it, for it was but voidable only, and his acceptance has now confirmed it.

If Tenant for Life lease Lands for years and dies, the Lease is void, and the
Rent reserved upon the Lease is determined, and Acceptance by him in Remainder
will not make it good; for when it is once void by Death, no Acceptance after
will make it good.

Wife, and then the Husband and Wife let for 20 years, reserving Rent, and the
Husband dies, the Wife accepts the Rent during the first 10 years; in this
case the second Lease is not affirmed, for 21 Eliz. 563. Philips Prin. of Law,
p. 164.
the Acceptance of the Rent before the Lease begins, and so before any Rent
be due, is no Acceptance at all.

A Lease for Years may be Noye's Maxims, p. 78.
confirmed for a time, or upon Condition, or for a piece of the Land; but if it
be a Franktenement, it shall enure to the whole absolutely.

There is a diversity between See in Pennant's case, 38 ^liz. Co. 3. l. f.
a Lease for Life and for Years. In case of a Lease for Life, though the
Conclusion of the Condition be that it shall be void, yet acceptance of the
Rent due after the breach does affirm it and make it good again; for the
Freehold being created by Livery cannot be determined before Entry.

Chapter confirm the Demise aforesaid in form aforesaid made for 51 years and
no farther; this is a Confirmation of all the Term: but if they had recited the
Lease, and confirmed the Land for 51 years, this had been good. But by
whatsoever words they confirm a Lease for Life, or Gift in Tail for part, this
shall confirm all, because they are entire.

Lease for 20 Years the first of May, to begin at Mid-summer, and the Feoffees

Midsummer also; this is no Surrender of the first Lease, but it shall enure as
a Confirmation for 20 years, and a new Lease for 10 years.

If Tenant in Tail lease his 32 H. 8. Br. Acceptance 13.
Lands for 20 years, rendering Rent, and die, and the Lessee leases to another
for 10 years, and the Issue accepts the Rent of the second Lessee; this is no
Affirmance of the Lease, for there is no privity between the second Lessee and
the Issue: contrary, if he accepts it of him as Bailiff of the Lessee.

But if the first Lessee had Bro. ibid.
leased over all his Term in parcel of the Land let, and his Assignee pays the
Rent to the Issue in Tail, who accepts it; this affirms the entire Lease; for
Rent upon a Lease for Years is not apportionable.

If a man make a Lease to one Dr. and Stud l. 2. c. 20 f. 93. b.

Remainder can depend upon an Estate, but where the Estate begins at the same
time when the Remainder does; and in this case the Confirmation neither
enlarged the Lessee's Estate, nor gave him a new one.

But if a Lease be made to Dr. and Stud. l 2. c. 20. p. 93. b.
one for another man's Life, and after the Lessor confirms the Estate to the

will re-enter upon their Tenants, to make demand of the Rent at the House upon
the Land, if there be one, (if the payment be not appointed elsewhere by the
Agreement of the parties) where the Lessor himself or his sufficient Attorney,
a little before Sunset, in the presence of 2 or 3 sufficient Witnesses, shall
say, Here I demand of R. A. 10 pound due to me at the Feast of St. Martin the
Bishop last past, for a Message, Barn, etc. which he holds of me in Lease by
Indenture for 20 years, bearing Date, etc. and so remain there upon the Land
the last day that the Rent is due to be paid, until it be dark, that he cannot
see to tell the money.

But note, this Demand must 49 Ass. 5. 15 ^l. Dyer f. ^29. Perkins 838.
be made at the Fore-door of the House, and not at the Backdoor; Co. 1 part
Inst. f. 201. b. 153. a. b. Herne's Law of Conv. p. 28.
for if it be, it is not good, because the Demand must be at the most notorious
place, and it is not material whether any person be there or no: and if the
Lessee be in the house, and the door open, yet the Lessor need go no farther
then the Fore-door.

If there be no House, the Dyer 329. 15 El. Perkins 838. Co. 1 part Inst. f.

other, and it was held to be a good Tender to save a Re-entry.
Demand must be made at the most notorious place of the Land, as at some
Highway leading through the same; for if it be either at the backdoor of the
House, or some obscure place in the ground, it is void, and the Lessor shall
not take advantage by such Demand for Re-entry, or breach of any other
Condition.

time; and so it suffices for the Lessor to demand it the same hour.

If a man have an House for 40 years, and devise the House Pasch. 14 El. Dyer

see the Rector of Cheddington's case, 40 El. Co. 1. l. f. 153.

there be Livery and Seisin upon such a Lease, to have according to the effect
thereof, this Livery is void, and the Lessee shall but have an Estate for Years.

of Conv. ubi supra, and p. 3^.
of Feoffment, and delivers Seisin, the Lessee being upon part of the
premises, and not knowing nor assenting to it, this Livery is void; for though
the Lessor has the Freehold and Inheritance in him, yet the possession is in
the Lessee, and Livery must be given of the possession: but if the Lessee be
absent, and has neither Wife nor Servants (though he have Cattle) upon the
ground, then the Livery shall be good.

If a man let Lands or Tenements Lit. l. 1. c. 7. Vide Philipps ^r. of Law, p.

Lessor to the Lessee for Years, otherwise nothing passes to them in Remainder:
the Reasons you have before in this Chapter.

If the Lessee enter before Livery and enjoy, then the Freehold Co. 1 part

the Lessee after Entry; for he is then in possession, and Livery cannot be made

power to falsify all Recoveries that shall be had against the Tenant of the
Freehold through the Knavery of the Lessors, intending thereby that the
Lessees shall be outed before their Term be out; whenas perhaps they paid a
great Fine at their Income, and so it were an hard case if they should lose
their Terms upon such Recoveries by Collusion.

CHAP. IV. Of the Dates, Commencements, Continuance, and Determinations of
Leases.
LEases for Life or Years are Co. 1 part Inst. f. 45. b.
of Three natures. Some be good in Law; some voidable by Entry; and some void
without Entry; some in futuro, and some in praesenti: of all which you have
several Examples in this little Treatise.

If a Lease be made for 3 See Clayton's case, 37 Eliz. in C. B. Cook 5 lib. f.
1. 12 Eliz. Dyer 286. 14 Eliz. Dyer 307. Co. 1 part Inst. f. 46. b. Noye's
Maxims, p. 66. But see Osborn and Rider's case, H. 13 Jac. in B. R. Cro. 2
part, 135. See Barwick's case, 39 El. in the Exchequer. Co. 5. l. fo. 93.
Hern's Law of Conv. p. 14, and 15.
years beginning from henceforth, and is delivered the 19 day of June 1663; in
this case the day must be taken inclusive, and the Lease must end the 18 day of
June in the third year after. But if a Lease be made to hold from the day of
the making, or from the day of the Date, or from the Date; here the Lease shall
begin the day after it is delivered, and the day of the delivery is exclusive;
and so note the diversity.

If the Habendum of a Lease Co. 1 part Inst. ibid. Herne's Law of Conv. p. 15,
and 131.
be for the term of 21 years, without mentioning when it shall begin, it shall
then begin from the Delivery.

If an Indenture of Lease Co. ibid. See Goddard's Case, 26 Eliz. Co. 2 l. f. 5.
See M. 8 Jac. B. R. Osley and Sr Bap^ist Hicks's Case. Cro. 2 part 263, 264.
there being pretty matter concerning the Date and Delivery of a Deed. Herne's
Law of Conveyances, ubi supra, and pa. 1^2.
bear date the 30 Febr. or 40 of March, which is impossible; in this case if
the term be limited to begin from the Date, it shall then begin from the
Delivery, as if there had been no Date at all.

If Lands descend to an Heir, Noye's Max. p. 67.
he may make a Lease thereof before his Entry into the same.

If a man make a Lease to one ibid. p. 68. 26 H. 8. Bro. Lease 48.
for 10 years, and the next day after make another for 20 years to another man;
this second Lease shall be good for 10 years after the first is expired.

If a Lease be made for 21 Co. 1 part Inst. f. 45. b. and see 40 El. in the
Rector of Cheddington's case. Co. 1 lib. f. 154. and Herne's Law of Convey. p.
135.
years, and after another Lease to commence from the end and expiration of the
said term of years, and after the first Lease is surrendered; in this case the
second Lease shall commence presently upon the Surrender: but if it had been to
commence from the end of the said 21 years; there, though there had been a
Surrender, yet it should not have commenced till the term had been out: and so
note a diversity between Terminum Annorum and Tempus Annoru^.

A man cannot make a Lease See the 39 El. in Barwick's case. Co. 5. l. f 93.
for Life to commence at a day to come, for he cannot make a present Livery to
a future Estate; and therefore in this case nothing does pass.

If A seized of Lands in Fee do grant to B, that when he Co. 1 part Inst. f.
45. b. See many pretty cases in the B. of B^^he and Wells's case, Co. 6. l. f.
34, 35.
pays him 20 s. that then from that time he shall have and occupy the Land for
21 years, and after B paies the 20 s; this is a good Lease for 21 years from
that time, notwithstanding the Rule of Bracton, That every Lease must have a
certain beginning and ending; Quia* ^d certum est, quod certum reddi potest.

And so if a man leases Land 3. M. 1. Br. Leases 67. the end.
to another till the Lessee has levied 20 pound; this is a good Lease,
notwithstanding the incertainty.

If a man make a Lease to another Co 1 part Inst. f. 45 b. See Say and Fuller's
case.
for so many years as R. A. shall name, this at the beginning Pl. Co. Kitchen,
p. 235. b. Vide Philipps's Pr. of Law, p. 36.
is uncertain; but when R. A. has named the years, it is then good for so many
years as he names.

If A leaseth his Lands to B Co. 1 part Inst. f. 45. b.
for so many years as B has in the Manor of Sale, and B has 10 years in it;
this is a good Lease to B of the Lands of A for the said said 10 years.

But if a Parson make a Lease Co. ibid. So resolved Hill. 26 El. Rot. 935. in C.
B.
of his Glebe for so many years as he shall be Parson there, this is void for
the incertainty; for Terminus vitae est incertus, and licet nihil certius est
morte, Brac. l. 2. c. 9.
nil tamen incertius est hora mortis.

If a Parson make a Lease of his Co. ibid.
Glebe for 3 years, and so from 3 years to 3 years so long as he continues
Parson; this is a good Lease for 6 years, and void for the Remainder: but this
must be understood, if he continue Parson so long.

If a Lease be made to one See in the 40 El. in the Rector of Cheddington's ca.
Co. 1. l.
for so many years as his Executors shall name; this is void for the
incertainty.

A Lease for a year, and so from year to year during the Noye's Max. p. 66.
Life of R. A, is a Lease but for 2 years; and if the Termor stay longer, he is
afterward but Tenant at Sufferance.

If I make a Lease to R. B. to 33 Ass. p. ^. 2 M. 1. Br. Leases 67. Co. 1 par.
Inst. f. 42. a.
hold the Lands till 100 pound be paid, and make no Livery of Seisin; he has
an Estate but only at Will, and may be put out at pleasure: but if Livery be
given, he has an Estate for Life, upon Condition implied, to cease upon the
payment of the 100 pound.

A Lease from year to year so 14 H. 8.16. Noy's Max. p. 66. Br. Lease 13.22.
long as both parties please, is a good Lease after Entry in any year for that
year, till warning be given to depart.

the Lease is ended.

A Lease rendering Rent to See Co. 5. l. f 111. in Mallery's ca. 43 Eliz.

one and his Heirs, or his Heirs alone, but of a Feoffment Tenendum to one or
his Heirs, is but an Estate only for the Life of the Feoffee.

If a man make a Lease to See 3 Jac. Savin's ca. in C. B. Co. 5. l. f. 123.
commence after the end or determination of a former Lease in esse, and after
the first Lease is out, and the second Lessee enters not, but he in the
Reversion enters, and makes a Feoffment, and levieth a Fine with Proclamations,
and 5 years pass without Entry or Claim of the second Lessee; in this case the
Fine bars him: for the Stat. 4 H. 7. c. 24. speaks of Interest, and a Lease
for years is an Interest within the Statute.

If an Infant, who is seized of Co. 1 part Inst. f. 45. b.
Land held in Soccage, make a Lease at his age of 15; this is good, and shall
bind him.

If Tenant in Tail make a 10 E. 3.26. 34 Ass. 15.23 E. 3. Dower 130. Co. 1 part
Inst. f. 46. a.
Lease for Years according to the Statute, rendering Rent, and die without
Issue; now as to him in the Reversion the Lease is void; but if he endow the
Wife of that Land, it shall be good against her: or if Tenant in Tail die
without Issue, his wife enseint with a Son, and he in Reversion enters, and
after the Wife is delivered; in this case the Lease is again revived, although
it were once void by the Entry of him in Reversion. Nota.

If Tenant in Fee take a Co 1 part Inst. f. 46. a.
Wife, and make a Lease for Years, and after die, and the Wife is thereof
endowed; here she shall avoid the Lease, but after her Death it shall be in
force again against the Heir.

If an Husband have a term of years in Right of his Wife, Idem ibid. b and fo.

not to his Executors, without he make disposition of it in his lifetime, 14

If a man lease for Life to I. S, and the next day leases to W. B. 37 H. 8 Br.
Leases 48. the end.
for 20 years; the second Lease is void, if it be not a Grant of a Reversion
with Attornment; for in Law the Freehold is more worthy and perdurable then a
Lease for Years: yet if the Lessee for Life die within the Term, the Lease for
Years is good for the rest of the years to come.

If a man license another to Brownl. 2 part, p. 250. 10 E. 4. f. 4. 5 H. 7. f.

enter and occupy his Lands, this is a good Lease for Years in Law.

If a man lease for 60 years, and so from 60 years to 60 ^l. Com. f. 273.29 H.

term.

If a man have a Lease for 32 l. Ass. 6.
500 years, it is but a Chattel, notwithstanding the long time.

A Lease for Years, though it be never so long, cannot be H. l. 2^ Car. in B.

strongly against himself.

But if Tenant in Tail let Co. ibid. and f. 183. b. Finch, l. 1. c. 4. p. 60.
such a Lease without expressing whose Life, it shall be taken to be for the
Life of the Lessor.

A Lease for a thousand days 14 H. 8. f. 1. Finch, l. 1. c. 5. p. 67.
is a Lease for Years.

A Lease for Years and a Release Finch, cod. loco. Co. Lit. f. 207. a.

for years of his part, though the Lessee never had possession, or though it be
to begin at a day to come, and the Joynttenant which made it die before the
day; yet the Survivor shall be bound by the Lease, for the Lessee has a
present Interest.

But it is otherwise of a Grant Co 1 part Inst. f. 184. b. Finch, ibid. 5 El.

to have a Lease, if the Grantee pay 10 pound before Midsummer next, and the
Joynt-tenant which made the Grant die before the day; for here is no Interest
at all, but a Communication till the money be paid.

If a man let Land for Life, without saying more, the Reversion Finch, l. 2. c.

if I make a Lease for 40 years, if the Lessee dwell upon the thing let during
the term; here if the Lessee die, the term is determined.

But if it be a Lease for 40 years, if the Lessee dwell upon Idem in Save's and

continues.

and by special pleading discharge Finch, l. 1. c. 3. p. 31. 4 E. 6.68. b. See

If a Lease be made to A and B for their Lives, in this case if either die, the
other shall have all during his life, for it is an Interest. Philipps Pr. of

If Husband and Wife make a Lease at Will of the Co. 1 part of Inst. f. 55. b.

Although a Lessee for Years Styles Regestum Practicale. p. 198. Pasch. 1650.

lose his term in the Lands let by Indenture which is lost, if it can be proved
any way that there was such a term let to him by Indenture, and that it is not
determined: and so it is of any other Estate in Land, if the Deed that created
the Estate be lost, if it can be sufficiently proved that there was such a Deed
made, and that such an Estate was conveyed by Deed.

If Tenant for term of years or any other Tenant be outed, or if they die,
their Executors, or they if living, shall have reasonable time and free liberty
to come and fetch away their Utensils and other goods out of the Lessor's House.

But if Tenant for Years sow Co. on Lit. f. 55. a. b. Lit. ^h. Tenant at Will.

the Land, and his term end before the Corn be ripe, the Lessor shall have it,
without it be covenanted between them, that he shall have his way-going Crop,
as they call it in Yorkshire: and the reason of this is, because the Tenant did
know when his term would end, and it was his folly to sow Corn that would not
be ripe till the term were expired.

If Tenant for Life sows the ground, and die before the Corn be ripe, his
Executors shall have it, and Grass, if it be cut; but not Meadow unmown, for
that is part of the Inheritance till it be severed.

for Life or Years the Law, as incident to his Estate, gives him, without
provision of the party, three kind of Estovers; that is Housebote, which is
twofold, viz. Estoverium aedificandi and ardendi, that is, for repairing the
Houses and burning; then Ploughbote, that is to say Estoverium arandi, that is,
for mending his Ploughs, Harrows, Wains, and making Rakes and Forks for getting
his Hay; and lastly Haybote, and that is Estoverium claudendi, and this is for
repairing and mending his Stack-bars, Gates, Styles and Hedges: but these
Estovers must be reasonable. Bote in the Saxon tongue and Estovers in the
French tongue in this case are all of one signification, that is, to have
Compensation or satisfaction for these purposes.

but if they be Dotards without any Timber in them, then the Tenant shall have
such when they are blown down.

CHAP. VI. Of Distresses. Of what things a Distress may be taken, and how it
must be used, etc.
THE word Distress is a Co. on Lit. f. 96. a.
French word, and in Latin it is called Districtio sive Angustia, because the
Cattle distrained are put into a Straight, which we call a Pound.

A Distress must be of a thing 14 H. 8. 25.2 F. 2. Tit. Distress. 6 R. 2.

Conies, and the like that are ferae naturae, cannot be distrained, nor an Horse
when a man or woman is riding on him, nor an Ax in a man's hand cutting of
wood, for they are for that time privileged.

Neither can things which are 22 E. 4.36.7 H. 7. 1. b. 22 E. 4.49. b.

making of Cloth, nor Cloth or Garments in a Tailor's Shop, nor Sacks of Corn or
Meal in a Mill, for the Rent of the Mill, nor any thing that the Lessee has
distrained for damage feasant, for it is in the Custody of the Law.

But if they be removed from Finch, ubi supra.

they be in a Pound covert, or out of the County, and die for want of meat, then
he that distrained shall answer for them.

and the Owner suffers the Beasts to die for lack of meat; then he that
distrained them is at his liberty to take his Action of Trespass.

If the Owner of the Cattle Idem ibid. and Kitchen, f. 207. b.
tender amends to him that distrained, and he refuse it, yet the Owner may not
take his Cattle out of the Pound; for if he do, a Parco fracto lies against
him.

But after such tender he may Idem ibid.
sue out a Replevin, to have them out; and if it appear, when they come to a
Trial, to the Jury that the Tender was sufficient, then the Owner shall recover
Damages in the Replevin against him that distrained, for detaining the goods;
and if on the contrary it appear that the Tender was not sufficient, then the
Avowant, that is he that distrained, shall have such Amends as the Jury shall
assess.

If after such Amends tendered Dr. and Stud. l. 2. c. 2^. Ki^chin* f. 207. b.
the Cattle die in such Pound overt, the Owner shall be at the loss, by reason
of the wrong done at the beginning, to see that they shall have meat so long as
they be in Pound.

But if the Owner of the Cattle procure a Replevin to Idem ibid.
deliver them, and he that distrained resists it, and will not deliver them; in
this case, if they die after for want of meat, it is at the peril of him that
distrained, and the owner shall recover Damages against him in an action upon
the Statute, for disobeying of the King's Writ.

But for Debt, Account, Dr. and Stud. ib.
Trespass, Reparations, etc. a man may not distrain.

It is a Maxim in Law, that 20 E. 3. Avowry 1^1. 25 H. 6.37. Br^ct. fo. 230,

no Distress can be taken for any Services that are not put into certainty, nor
can be reduced to any certainty; for id certum est quod certum reddi potest,
for oportet quod certa res deducatur in Judicium: and upon the Avowry Damages
cannot be recovered for that which neither has certainty nor can be reduced to
certainty.

And yet in some cases there may be a certainty in an incertainty: 7 F. 3.38.
and Co. ubi supra.
as a man may hold of his Lord to shear all his Sheep depasturing within the
Lord's Manor; and this is certain enough, although the Lord has sometimes a
greater number and sometimes a lesser number there; for this incertainty being
reduced to the Manor, which is certain, the Lord may distrain for this
incertainty: and sic de similibus.

A Distress is inseparably incident Co. 1 part Inst. f. 150. b. 151. b.
to every Service that may be reduced to certainty, as aforesaid.

If a man make a Feoffment reserving a Rent, he cannot distrain Dr. and Stud.

without a Clause of Distress; and if the Feoffment be not by Indenture, the
Reservation is void in Law: like Law where a particular Estate is made

But if a man make a Gift in Tail reserving Fealty and Rent, Dr. and Stud. ibid.

distrain for the Rent, for the Fealty is incident to the Reversion, and cannot
be granted without it.

CHAP. IX. Of Replevins, when and where to be sued out.
REplegiare is compounded of Re and Plegiare, as much Co 1 part Inst. f. 145. b.
as to say to deliver upon Pledges or Sureties.

Where goods are distrained and impounded, the Owner of Co. ibid Vide Fleta, l.
2. c. 40. and Glanvill, l. 12. c. 12.
the goods may have a Writ De Replegiari facias, whereby the Sheriff is
commanded, taking Pledges of prosecuting, to re* deliver the goods distrain'd
to the Owner; and this is by the Common Law.

But the quickest way is to Co. ubi supra. Westmin. 2. c. 2. Vide Ferrer's Mag.
Charta, f. 60. Rastal Tit. Replevin 2. and Wingate's Abr. Stat. p. 409. Compl.

complain to some of the Sheriffs Deputies in the Country, who keep a Seal for
that purpose, and they will grant a Replevin, and must take Plegii de Retorno
habendo, that is to deliver the goods again to the party that distrained, if
the action be found against him that Replevieth; and this is by the Statute.

By the Stat. 1, 2 P. M. C. 12. Wingate's Abr. p. 133. Rast. Tit. Distresses
11. Vide Sheppard's Survey of County Judicatures, p. 47.
every Sheriff is at his first County-day, or within two Months after he
receives his Patent, to depute and proclaim in his Shire-Town 4 Deputies to
make Replevins, not dwelling above 12 Miles distant one from another; if he
fails herein, he forfeits 5 pound every Month they are wanting, to be divided
between the King and the Prosecutor.

If the Lord carry the Distress Compl. At. p. 125, 126. Ferrer's Ma. Charta,

Judicatures, p. 49.
to a Hold or out of the County, so that the Sheriff cannot make Deliverance
upon the Replevin, then the party upon the Sheriff's return of the Replevin may
have a Writ of Withernam directed to the Sheriff, to take as many of the Lord's
Beasts or as much goods in his keeping till he have made deliverance of the
first Distress; and if the Beasts or goods be conveyed to a Fort or Castle, the
Sheriff may take with him the Power of the County, and beat down the Castle.

If it be in a Franchise or Bailiwick, Comp. At. p. 127. Vide Marlb. c. 21.
Ferrer's Magna Charta, f 27. and Rastall Repl. 1.
the party shall have a Replevin of the Sheriff, directed to the Bailiff, to
deliver them upon Pledges as before.

It is a general Rule, that the Plaintiff in the Replevin must 3 E. 3.74.6 H.

have the property of the goods in him at the time of the taking; for if the
Defendant (that is he that distrained) claim property, the Sheriff cannot grant
a Replevin upon Complaint to him made; for it is a Rule in Law, that Property
must be tried by Writ.

And therefore in this case the 31 H. 6. Prop. pro-banda 5.1. E. 4.9. 21 E.
4.64, and 66. 2 El. Dyer 173. Co. 1 part Inst. f. 145. b. Vide Sheppard's Surv.
of County Judic. p. 50, 51, and 52.
Plaintiff (that is he that sues out the Replevin) may have a Writ De
proprietate probanda directed to the Sheriff, to try the Property; and if it be
found for the Plaintiff, then the Sheriff to make Deliverance, and if for the
Defendant, the Sheriff can proceed no farther; unless the Plaintiff get a
Replegiari facias to the Sheriff; and then, though he return the property, etc.
yet it shall proceed in the Common Pleas, where the property shall be put in
issue, and finally tried.

The Sheriff may take a Plaint upon the Stat. Marlebr. out of Co. ubi supra.
his County, and make Replevin presently; for it should be inconvenient for the
Owner to forbear his Cattle till the County-day.

If he that distrained the Beasts see cause, he may have a Writ of Recordare,
and so remove the Suit upon the Replevin out of the Sheriff's County Court into
the Comon-Pleas-Court; and if the Plaintiff declare not, he that distrained may
have a Retorno habendo; and if he declare not still, then the Avowant shall
have a Writ to enquire of Damages.

Note, there be two kinds of Co. 1 part Inst. f. 145. b. 42 E. 3. 18. 11 H. 4.
17. 7 H. 4.17. 48 E. 3. 20. Vide Sheppard's Survey of County Judicatures, p. 46.
Properties; a general property, which every absolute Owner has, and a special
property, as goods pledged, or taken to manure his Lands, or the like: and of
both these a Replevin does lie.

It is to be noted, that a man 5 E. 3.38. 11 H. 4. 4. 17 E. 2 Prop. prob. 6.
Co. 1 part
cannot claim property by his Bailiff or Servant; and the Reason Inst. f. 145.
b. Philipps Prin. of Law, p. 69. Vide Sheppard's Survey of County Judicatures,
p. 52 and 53.
is, for that if the Claim fall out to be false, he shall be punished for his
contempt, which the Lord cannot be, unless he make Claim himself; for Nemo
punitur pro alieno Delicto.

If a man by his Deed grant Co. ubi supra. Bract. l. 4. f. 233. a b. 31 E. 3.
Gage Deliver. 5.
a Rent with Clause of Distress, and grant farther that he shall keep the goods
distrained against Gages and Pledges until the Rent be paid, yet shall the
Sheriff Replevie the goods distrained; for it is against the nature of such a
Distress to be Irrepleviable, and by such an Intention the Current of Replevins
should be overthrown, to the hindrance of the Commonwealth.

If the Beasts of diverse several Co. 1 part Inst. f. 145. b. 28 E. 3.92. 3 H.

men be distrained, they cannot join in a Replevin, but every one must have a
several Replevin; for in a Replevin it is a good Plea to say that the property
is to the Plaintiff and to a Stranger, and where there be two Plaintiffs, that
the property is to one of them.

The Tenant shall have a Replevin F. N. B. 69. b. 4 H. 7.40. 11 H. 7. 10.

against the Lord that did wrongfully distrain, though the Beasts be come back
again to the Owner, because he can have no Action of Trespass against the Lord.

A Replevin ought to be certain Tr. 23 Car. in B. R. Regest. Practicale, p. 193.
in setting forth the number and kinds of the Cattle distrained, or else it is
not good.

CHAP. X. Of Avowries, a word or two briefly concerning the same.
Avowry is where one takes Terms of the Law, verb. Avowry.
a Distress for Rent or other thing, and the Owner of the goods sueth out a
Replevin, then he that takes the Distress shall justify in his Plea for what
cause he took it; and if he took it in his own Right, he must show that, and so
avow the taking, and that is called his Avowrie.

But if he took the Distress Terms of the Law, verb. Avowry.
in or for the Right of another, then when he has showed the cause, he must
make Conusance of the taking, as Bailiff or Servant to him in whose Right he
took it.

In Avowrie if the Plaintiff Rastall Tit. Avowry, and Wingate's Abr. p 34
be Nonsuit, or otherwise barred Vide Tr. 15 Car. B. R. Tintnye and James's
Case, in Winche's Rep. f. 30, and 31. and in Cro. 1 part, 358, and 385. the
same case, where there is excellent matter about Avowrie^.
or overthrown, then the Avowants shall recover their Damages and Costs
against the said Plaintiffs, as the same Plaintiffs should have done or had if
they had recovered in the Replevin or Second Deliverance found against the said
Avowants.

The Lord may avow the taking Rastall and Wingate, ubi supra. Co. 1 part Inst.
f. 269. b.
a Distress as in Lands holden of him within his Fee, without naming any person
in certain; and this is by the Statute of the 21 H. 8. c. 19.

But by the Common Law they could not do this, but were forced to avow upon a
person in certain, which proved often very prejudicial to the Lords; for by the
secret Fines, Recoveries, Grants and Feoffments which the Tenants made
purposely to defraud their Lords, they thereupon were put from the knowledge of
their Tenants, upon whom by order of Law they should make their Avowry, and so
to prevent this Inconvenience the said Statute was made.

But the Lord may avow still Co. ubi supra. Vide Mich. 6 Jac. Co. 8. l. Sir
Will. Foster's case. 32 H. 8. chapter 2. Rastall Tit. Limitation 3. and Wingate's
Abr. p. 295.
by the Common Law if he will: and although he do avow by the Statute upon the
Lands generally, as in Lands, etc. within his Fee or Seigniory, yet
nevertheless he must alledg Seisin by the hands of some particular Tenant in
certain within 40 years.

In an Avowrie made according Rastall Tit. Avowry; and Wingate's Abr. p. 34.
to the Statute, every Plaintiff in the Replevin or Second Deliverance, be he
Termor or other, may have every Answer to the Avowrie that is sufficient, and
also have Aid and every other Advantage in Law, Disclaimer only excepted: for
disclaim he cannot, because the Avowry is made upon no person certain.

If the Lord come to distrain, and the Tenant chase his Beasts Co. 9. l. in
Case de Avowry, f. 22.
which were within the Lord's view out of the Land holden, etc. yet if the Lord
freshly follow and take them, although it be out of his Fee and Seigniorie, he
may by the Equity of the Statute avow the taking as in Lands holden of him
within his Fee and Seigniory.

If there be Lord and Tenant, Co. 1 part Inst. f. 269. b. and see Co. 3 l. f.
65, and 66. in Pennant's case.
and the Rent is behind for diverse years, and the Tenant makes a Feoffment in
Fee, if the Lord accept the Service or Rent of the Feoffee due in his time, he
shall lose the Arrearages due in the time of the Feoffor; for after such
acceptance he shall not avow upon the Feoffor, nor upon the Feoffee for the
Arrearages in the time of the Feoffor: But if the Feoffor dies, albeit the
Lord accept the Rent or Service by the hands of the Feoffee due in his time,
yet he shall not lose the Arrearages; for now the Law compels him to avow
upon the Feoffee, and that which the Law compels him unto shall not
prejudice him.

There are four manner of Vide Aiscough's case 9 Jac. Co. 9. l. f. 135, and
136.20 H. 6.9. 26 H. 6. Avowr. 17. 9 Eliz. Dyer 257.20 ^. 3. Avowry 131.5 H.

1. Upon his very Tenant. 2. Upon his very Tenant by the manner, where the
Tenant had but a particular Estate. 3. Upon his Tenant by the manner, where the
Lord had but a particular Estate. And these 3 are by the Common Law. 4. Upon
the matter in the Land as within his Fee; and this is by the Statute, and the
safest way.

If the House be uncovered when the Tenant comes in, it Co. ubi supra. Herne's

the Glass is part of the House.

And so it is of Wainscoat, Co. 1 part Inst. f. 35. a. Vide Keilway, f 88. and

If the House fall by sudden Tempest, or be burnt by Lightning, Co* ubi supra.
Vide in Co. 4. l. f. 63. Harlackenden's case. Dr. and St. l. 2. c. 4.

as remain, and with other Timber growing upon the ground, (which he may take)
for his habitation; but he must not make the House larger then it was, for if
he do, he is punishable in Waste.

Though there be no Timber Co. ubi supra. 44 E. 3.21.38 Ass. pl. 1. Com. At.

If a Termor fix a Furnace, and not to the Walls nor Posts 21 H. 7 f. 26. per

House is not impaired.

If Tenant in Fee fix a Furnace Kitchen ubi supra.

Executors.

If an House fall by a great 34 E. 3. f. 3. b. 11 H. 4. f. 21.

Lessee is not bound to re-edifie it.

If the Tenant take away a Lead or Fatts fixed to the House, it is Waste.

If a Stable be ruinous at the 11 H. 4. f. 32. Kitchen, f 242. b.

one.

The Tenant may cut Trees Kitchen ubi supra. Fitz. 59. k.
to amend the House and make Reparations; but where it is in decay through his
own Default, there if he cut Trees to repair it, it is Waste.

It is to be observed, that there Co. 1 part Inst. f. 53. a. Vid. Herne's Law
of Convey. p. 52.
is Waste, Destruction and Exile. Waste properly is in Houses, Gardens and
Timber Trees, (viz. Oak, Ash and Elm, and these are Timber in all places)
either by cutting of them down, or lopping and topping them, or doing any act
whereby the Timber may decay.

Also in Countries where Co. ubi supra. Herne ubi supra.
Timber is scant, and Beeches or the like are converted to building for the
habitation of man, or the like, they then are also accounted Timber, and
cutting of them by the Tenant is Waste.

If the Tenant cut down 22 H. 6.12. a. ^ N. B. 59. m. C^ ubi supra.

which are Mines of Coals or the like, without mentioning the Mines in the
Lease, the Lessee for such Mines as are open at the time of the Lease made may
dig lawfully, and take the profits thereof; but he may not dig for any new

not to any hidden Mines: but if there be no open Mines, and the Lease is made
of the Land together with all Mines therein, in this case the Tenant may dig
for them, and enjoy the benefit thereof, otherwise the words should be void.

If a Lease be made to one of 17 E. 3. Tit. 101. Kitchen, f. 248. a.

profit of them, yet this shall be intended only to be after such manner as is
according to Right and Law; for in this case the Lessee may not plow up Meadow,
or pull down Houses, etc. for if he do, he shall be punished in Waste.

If the Lessee make the Villanes Co. 1 part Inst. f. 53. b.

There are two kinds of Idem, f. 53. a.

case the Lord may have an Action of Trespass against him, Quare vi and armis,
etc. but for permissive Waste the Lord has no Remedy against him.

Either Waste or Account will lie against Tenant in Mortgage, Noye's Max. ubi
supra.
for he has Fee Conditional.

There are 5 several Writs of Waste; 2 at the Common Co. 1 part Inst. f. 54. a.
Law, for Waste done by Tenant in Dower or the Guardian; and 3 by the
Statute Law, for Waste done by Tenant for Life, for Years, and Tenant by the
Courtesy.

If two or more Joint-tenants Co. 1 part Inst. f. 200. b. Reg. 163. f. N. B.

the ground and repair it, though he be not compellable thereunto, and shall not
be punished in Waste for cutting the Wood.

If a man make a Lease of an Co. ubi supra.
House and Lands, without impeachment of Waste for the House, yet may the
Lessee notwithstanding repair the House with the Timber growing upon the
ground, though he may utterly waste the House if he will.

No person shall have an Action Co. 1 part Inst. f. 53. b. F. N. B. 59. f. 8 R.

of Waste, unless he has the immediate state of Inheritance; but sometime
another shall join with him for Conformity; as if a Reversion be granted to two
and the Heirs of the one, they two shall join in an Action of Waste.

And in like sort the surviving Idem ibid.
Coparcener and the Tenant by the Courtesy shall join in an Action of Waste.

If the Estate-Tail determine, Co. ubi supra. 2 H. 4.22.

possibility of Issue extinct, the Action of Waste is gone.

If the Tenant do Waste, and 2 H. 4. Co. ubi supra. Noye's Max. p. 33.

Waste done in the life of the Ancestor.

shall have an Action of Waste against Tenant for Life.

If Lessee for Life commit F. N. B. 36. b. 14 H 8. f. 11. Kitchen, f. 244. a. b.
Waste, and after surrender his Estate, and the Lessor accepts it; now the
Lessee is discharged of the Waste.

If a Stranger make Waste Kitchen, ibid. 5 ^. 4. f. 3. 3 H. 6. f. 1^. b.
upon the Lands which one holds for Life or Years, the Termor shall be
punished for it, and is left to take his Remedy over.

But if the Lessor himself Kitchen, ubi supra. 5 H. 4. f. 3.
make Waste, the Tenant shall not suffer for that Waste.

If the Tenant make Waste Idem ibid. 48 E. 3. f. 15. 34 H. 6. f. 7. ^
before his Attornment, he shall not be liable to an Action for it.

If the Lessor covenant to deliver Timber out of the same 44 E. 3. f. 21.
Kitchen, ubi supra.
Land to repair the House let, and will not, and for lack thereof the Lessee
will not repair it, but suffers the House to fall; in this case he is
punishable for such Waste: But if the Timber Idem ibid.
be to be taken out of other Lands, and is not delivered, then the Tenant is
excusable if he suffer the House to fall, and no Action of Waste lies against
him.

Note, After the Waste Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 53. b.
done, there is a special regard to be had to the continuance of the Reversion
in the same estate that it was at the time of the Waste done; for if after the
Waste he grant it over, though he take back the whole Estate again, yet is the
Waste dispunishable: and so it is if he grant the Reversion to the use of
himself and his Wife, and of his Heirs, yet the Waste is dispunishable, and so
of the like; because the Estate of the Reversion continues not, but is altered,
and consequently the Action of Waste for Waste done before (which consists in
privity) is gone.

A Prohibition of Waste did lie against Tenant by the Courtesy, Bract. l. 4.

Tenant for Life or Years, because they came in by the Lessor's own Act, and he
might have provided that no Waste should be done.

f. and see Co. 3. l. in Walker's ca. and ^. l. in Beaumont's ca. Regest. 72.
in Dower can hold of none but the Heir and his Heir by descent; and therefore
if they grant over their Estate, and the Grantee does Waste, yet the Action
must be brought against themselves for the Waste done, and not against the
Assigns or Grantees.

But if the Heir either before Co. ubi supra.
the Assignment had granted, or after the Assignment does grant the Reversion
over; in both these cases the Grantee must bring the Action of Waste against
the Assignee, for now the privity is destroyed.

In all other Cases the Action of Waste must be brought Co. 1 par. Inst. f. 54.
a. 27 E. 4.81. 26 E. 5. Waste 10.
against the parties that commit the Waste, (for it is in nature of a Trespass)
unless it be in case of a Ward; for there if the Guardian does Waste and assign
over, the Action lies against the Assignee.

A Guardian shall not be punished Co. ubi supra. 12 H. 4.3. 3 E. 3. Wast 146.
Fleta, l. 1. chapter 11.
for Waste done by a Stranger.

But Tenant by the Courtesy, Idem ibid. F. N. B* 59. a. and 60. g. and ^.
in Dower, for Life, Years, etc. shall be punished for Waste done by a
Stranger, and are left to take their Remedy over against the Stranger as
aforesaid.

If Waste be made by F. N. B. 59. l. Kitchen, f. 244. b.
strange Enemies or sudden Tempest, the Termor is dispunishable for such
Waste. See before chapter 11. p. 127.

for this Waste.

But if the Lease were made Kitchen, ibid. Finch, l. 1. chapter 3. p. 26.

shall not be punished for such Waste, unless she agree to the Estate.

If there be two Joynt-tenants of a Ward, and one of Co. 1 part Inst. f. 54.

them commit Waste, both shall answer for it.

An Infant and Baron and Feme shall be punished for Co. ibid. Vide 15 H. 3.

take Husband, and the Husband does Waste, and the Wife dies; in this case
he is not punishable for such Waste: but if a Feme be possessed of a Term of
years, and take Husband who commits Waste, and the Wife dies; here he shall
be liable to an Action of Waste for the Waste by him committed, because the
Law gives the Term to him.

If Tenant for Life grant over Co. ubi supra. 30 E. 3.10.
his Estate upon Condition, and the Grantee does Waste, and the Grantor
re-entereth for the Condition broken; the Action of Waste shall be brought
against the Grantee, and the place wasted recovered.

If a Lease be made to a Vilain, Co. Ibid. 48 E. 3. 19.
and Waste is done, and the Lord enters; in this case the Lord shall not be
punished for Waste done before Entry, but for Waste after he shall.

An Occupant shall be punished Co. ibid. and vide Co. 6. l. f. 37. ^e Dean and
Chap. de Worc. case; and l. 1^. f 9. b. Herne's Law of Conv. p. 53.
for Waste; and so if an Estate be made to A and his Heirs during the Life of
B, and A dies, his Heir shall be punished in Waste.

If a Lease be made to A for Co. 1 part Inst. f. 54. a. 50 E. 3. 3. 4 E. 3. 18.

Life, the Remainder to B for Life, the Remainder to C in F^e; in this case if
A make Waste, no Action lies against him during the Life of B; but if B die,
then an Action of Waste lies against A for the Waste done in the Life of B;
because it was ad exhaereditationem of him in Remainder in Fee, and now the
impediment (which was the mean Estate for Life) is taken away.

And where it is said in some Vide Paget's ca. ubi supra, in Co. 5. l. Herne's
Law of Conv. p. 53.
Books, that he in Remainder or Reversion in Fee shall not have an Action of
Waste, it is to be intended during the continuance of the mean Remainder for
Life: again, where it is said in some other Books, that an Action of Waste does
lie, it is meant after the death of him in Remainder for Life, and not
otherwise, therefore nota.

If a Lease for Life be made, ^inch, l. 1. ^h. 3. p ^0* Co. 1 part I^st. f. 5^.
^. Vide Herne's Law of Conv. p. 50, and 53.
the Remainder for Years, the Remainder in Fee; here an Action of Waste lies
presently against the Tenant for Life, during the term in Remainder, for this
mean term for years is no impediment.

But if a man makes a Lease for Life or Years, and after Co. ubi supra; and
Vide 4 F. 3. 18.
grants the Reversion for Years, the Lessor shall have no Action of Waste
during the years; for he himself has granted away the Reversion in respect
whereof he is to maintain his Action: but it is otherwise if he had made a
Lease in Reversion, which had been but a future Interest, for there an Action
of Waste lies during the term, and the term shall be saved in that case.

If an Action of Waste be brought, and pending the Writ 11 H. 6. f. 8. F. N
B. fo. 60.14 H. 8. f. 12. Kitchen, f. 246. b.
the term end, yet the Writ shall not abate; for although the Plaintiff cannot
recover the place wasted, yet he shall recover the treble Damages.

And so where one that holds Co. 1 part Inst. f. 285 a. 11 H. 6.43. 9 E. 4.50.
for term of another's Life makes Waste, and afterward Cestui que vie dies;
here the Lessor shall recover Damages, although he cannot recover the place
wasted.

If Tenant for Life or Years or their Assigns make a Grant F. N. B. f. ^0.
Kitchen, ubi supra. 36 ^l. in C. B. ^oo^he's case. Co. 5. l. ^. 77.

him in Reversion or Remainder, by the Statute of 11. H. 6. c. 5.

wherein the Waste sparsim is done.

And so in Houses, so many Co. 1 part Inst. f. 54. a. 8 E. 2. Wast 112.
Rooms shall be recovered wherein there is Waste done; but if the Waste be done
sparsim, through all, then all shall be recovered.

If a man make a Lease for Life, and by Deed grant that if any Waste be done,
that it shall be redressed by Neighbors, and not by Suit or Plea; yet
notwithstanding an Action of Waste does lie, for the place wasted cannot be
recovered without Plea.

If a man make Waste in 4 E 6. Wast 136. per Bro^ley. and Pasch. 1650. in B. R.
per Just. Jermy n. Vid. Regest pract. p. 343.

recovered but Locus vastatus, that is the Circuit of the Roots, and not the
whole Pasture: But if the Trees grew sparsim, Reg. pract. ubi supra.
scatteringly about the Pasture, then the whole Pasture is forfeited if they be
cut.

It is a good Plea in Bar to a Writ of Waste, to say that the 43 E. 6. f. 6.
Wast Kitchen, f. 247. a.
House fell by sudden Tempest, although the Termor did covenant to repair it;
but it is no Plea in a Writ of Covenant.

It is a good Plea in Waste to say, that at the time of the Kitchen, ubi supra.
49 E. 3. ^. 7. Wast.
Lease made the House was ruinous, and the Timber putrefied and rotten, so that
it fell; for if any of the principal Timber were rotten, it is no Waste, though
he did covenant to repair it. See before, chapter 2. p. 14.

It is also a good Plea to say, 8 H. 6. f. 27. Wast. 8 H. 5. f. 8. Wast, mes
veies Co. 1 part Inst. f. 285. a.
that the Plaintiff has entered upon the Land, before which Entry no Waste was
made; or that he Surrendered, and the Plaintiff did accept, before which time no
Waste was made.

It is no Plea to say, that at 19 H. 6. f. 66. Vide Co. 1 part Inst. f. 283. a.
and Kitchen, f. 247. b.
the day of the Writ purchased the House was sufficiently repaired; but he must
say after the Waste committed, and before the Writ purchased, it was
sufficiently repaired; and this is a good Plea.

If the Lessee does Waste, 19 H. 6. 66. 14 H. 6. 14. 11 R. 2. Waste 99. Co. 1
part Inst. f. 285. a.
and after surrenders, and the Lessor agrees; yet notwithstanding the Lessor

If an Action of Waste be brought by Baron and Feme in Co. ubi supra. 2 H.

now the Writ in this case shall abate, because every kind of Action of Waste
must be ad exhaereditationem.

If there be two Joynt-tenants Co. 1 part Inst. f. 200. b. Westminster. 2 chap. 22.

the will of the other; here the other may have an Action of Waste against him,
and he that did the Waste has election before Judgment either to take his part
in certainty by the Sheriff and the Oath of 12 men* etc. or that he grant that
from thenceforth he shall not do Waste, but according to his proportion, etc.
and if he make choice of a certain place, then the place wasted shall be
assigned to him.

And this does extend as well Co. 1 part Inst. fo. 200. a. b. 47 E. 3. 22. b. 2
H. 5. 1, and 3.
to Tenants in common and Joynt-tenants for Life, as to an Estate of
Inheritance: but if one Tenant in common or Joynt-tenant out of a Dovehouse
destroy the whole Flight of Doves, no Action of Waste does lie in that case
upon the Statute, but the other may have an Action of Trespass against him that
destroyed them, quare vi and armis Columbare le Pl*. fregit, and 200 Columbas
Pret. 40 interfecit, etc.

If a Lease be made to hold to one without any impeachment Co. 1 part Inst. f.
220. a. Vide Co. Reports, l. 2. f. 23. l. 9. f. 9. l. 12. f. 83.
of Waste, then the Lessee may cut down Trees, and convert them to his own use;
but if the words be, to hold without impeachment for any Action of Waste, then
in th^^ case if the Lessee cut dow^ Trees, the Lessor shall have them, for the
discharge extends but to the Action.

If Lessee for Life grant a Co. 1 part Inst. f. 233. b. and 234. a.
Rentcharge, and after does Waste, and the Lessor recover in an Action of
Waste, he shall hold the Land charged during the Life of the Tenant for Life;
but if the Rent were granted after the Waste done, the Lessor shall then avoid
the Grant made by the Lessee for Life.

A Parson, Vicar, Archdeacon, Prebend, etc. may have Co. 1 part Inst. f. 341.
a. 10 H. 7. 5. F. N. B. 55. d. and 57. c.

And if Tenant in Tail make a Lease for his own Life, yet Idem Ibid.

If the Lessor bring an Action Co. 1 part Inst. f. 356. a. 46 E. 3. 20. 8 H.
6.13.30 H. 6. 7.
of Waste against his Lessee, the Lessee cannot plead generally Riens en le
Reversion, but he must show how and by what means the Reversion is divested out
of him.

But if the Grantee of a Reversion bring an Action of Co. ubi supra.
Waste, the Lessee may plead generally, that he has nothing in the Reversion.

If a Bishop make a Lease Co. 1 part Inst. f. 356.
for Life or Years and dies, and the Lessee, the Sea being void, does Waste; in
this case the Successor shall have an Action of Waste,

And so if Lessee for Life be disseised, and Waste is done, Co. ubi supra.
and the Lessee reenters; here an Action of Waste lies against him.

If Lessor and Lessee for Years, etc. join in the cutting Mich. 18 H. 8 ^.
Perkins, 202.
down of 20 Oaks, etc. growing upon the Lands leased, the Lessor shall not
punish the Lessee for the same.

If the Lessee before his term begin enter into the Lands let to him, and do
an Act which amounts unto Waste, the Lessor shall not have an Action of Waste
for the same.

None shall have Judgment to Finch, l. 1. chapter 3. p. 29.
recover in an Action of Waste, where the Waste comes but to 12d or such a
petty Sum; for De minimis non curat Lex.

If Waste be done upon Co. 2 part Inst. ^. 303. Reges. Prac. p. 343.

no Remedy in Law for committing the same Waste; the Lessee in such case is not
punishable for the same by the Lessor, except there be a special Covenant in
the Lease, that he shall not commit nor suffer Waste to be done.

Note well, what has been here said concerning Guardians in Chivalry and their
Wards, is but only to show what the Law was formerly in those cases: for now
by the Stat. of 12 Car. 2. chap. 24. Wardship (that former undoing of many
Gentlemen) Primer-Seisins, and all Ouster le mains, etc. are quite taken away,
and all hold now in free and common Soccage; and every Father, whether he be at
age of 21 years or under, may by Deed executed in his lifetime, or by his last
Will and Testament in writing, in the presence of two or more credible
Witnesses delivered, dispose of his Children under the age of 21 years, and not
married at the time of his Death, for and during such time as they shall remain
under the age of 21 years, or any lesser time, to the Custody and Tuition of
any person or persons in Possession or Remainder, (Popish Recusants excepted:)
and such Disposition of such Child or Children since the 24 Febr. 1645, or
hereafter to be made, shall be good against all and every person and persons
claiming such Child or Children, as Guardian in Soccage, or otherwise, etc.

CHAP. XIII. An Abridgment of the Statute of the 43 Elizab. and the 15 of Car.
2. about the unlawful cutting, stealing or spoiling of Wood, etc. necessary for
all Gentlemen to know.
IF any shall be convicted by his own Confession, or by the Testimony of one
Witness upon Oath, before one Justice of Peace, or Head-Officer, to have
unlawfully cut or taken away any Grain growing, robbed any Orchard or Garden,
dug up or taken away any Fruit Trees, broken any Hedges, Pales, or other
Fences, cut or spoiled any Woods or Under-woods, standing and growing, or the
like, or to have been accessory thereunto, he shall, within such time as the
Justice or Head-Officer shall appoint, pay for the first Offense to the party
grieved so much as the Justice or Head-Officer shall set down: and in case the
party offending be not able to pay it, or do it not according to Order, then
the Offender is by them or either of them (respectively) to be committed to the
Constable, or other Officer of the Place where the Offense was committed, or
the party apprehended to be whipped; and so for every Offense afterward, and
proved as aforesaid, the Offender is to have the like punishment of Whipping.

If the Constable refuse or neglect to whip the Offender, any such Justice of
Peace or Head-Officer may commit him to Prison without Bail, till he whip or
cause to be whipped the party offending, as is above declared.

No Justice may execute this Statute for Offenses done to himself, unless he be
associated with one or more Justices of Peace whom the Offense does not
concern. Stat. 43. El. chapter 7.

Now the Statute of the 15. Car. 2. is an Additional Act to this, as follows.

That every Constable, Head-borough, or other person in every County, City,
Town Corporate, or other place where they shall be Officers or Inhabitants,
shall have power to apprehend or cause to be apprehended such as they suspect
for having, or carrying, or any ways conveying any Burden or Bundles of any
kind of Wood, Under-wood, Poles, or young Trees, Bark or Bast of Trees, or any
Gates, Styles, Posts, Pales, Rails, or Hedg-wood, Broom, or Furze.

If any person be suspected to have any such Woods, Under-woods, etc. any
Officer, by Warrant under the hand and Seal of one Justice, may enter by virtue
thereof into the Houses, Outhouses, Yards, Gardens, or other places belonging
to such persons, and wheresoever they find any such, they may apprehend those
persons, and also those who are suspected to have cut and taken the same, and
carry them before a Justice of the Peace of the County, City, etc. and if he in
whose custody such Wood, etc. is found, cannot give a good Account, which may
be satisfactory to the Justice, how he came by the same with the consent of the
Owner, or do not within a convenient time, set down by the Justice, produce the
party of whom he bought the same Wood, Under-wood, etc. or some other credible
Witness to depose upon Oath such Sale of the said Wood, Under-wood, etc. (which
the Justice may administer:) that then the said person shall be deemed convict
of the said offense of cutting and spoiling of the same Woods, Under-woods,
etc. within the meaning of the before-recited Statute of the 43. of Eliz. and
be liable to the punishment therein contained; and to pay over and above down
presently, to the use of the Overseers of the Poor of the place where the
Offense is committed, for the First Offense, such a sum, not exceeding 10s,
as the Justice shall appoint. And if the Offender shall not perform the
Justice's Order herein to the Owner, and also to the Overseers of the Poor,
then the Justice is to commit him to the House of Correction, for so long (not
exceeding one Month) as he shall think meet, or to be whipped by the Constable
or other Officer, as the Justice shall judge most expedient. And if such person
shall again offend in the like kind, and be convicted as before, then he must
be sent to the House of Correction for one Month, and be there held to hard
Labor. And if he do offend the third time, and be convicted as before, then he
shall be taken, adjudged, and deemed as an Incorrigible Rogue.

If any buy any Burdens of Wood, etc. (as before named) which may be justly
suspected to have been stolen or unlawfully come by; any Justice, Mayor,
Bailiff, or Head-Officer within his Jurisdiction, may, upon complaint to him
made, examine the matter upon Oath, which they may administer: and if he find
that the same was bought of one that may be justly suspected to have stolen or
unlawfully come by the same, he may then order the party that bought the same,
to pay Treble the value to the party from whom they were stolen or unlawfully
come by, and in default of present payment thereof, issue out his Warrant to
levy the same by Distress and Sale of the Offender's goods, rendering the
overplus to the owner of such goods; and for lack of such distress, to commit
the party to the Gaol, there to remain without Bail for the space of one Month
at his own charges.

Note, that no man is to be punished by this Law, that has been punished by a
former Law for the same Offense: nor is any man to be questioned for any
offense in this Statute, unless he be questioned for the same within six weeks
after the Offense is committed.

FINIS.
