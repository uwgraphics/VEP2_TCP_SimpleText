the Name of JESUS, AND NOT Kneeling in the Act of receiving the Lords Supper;

Subjects, concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs. Comprising the principal Reasons

Schism) to these two Ceremonies; The first whereof is at large discussed both

feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men; see that none
render evil for evil unto any man, but follow that which is good both among
your selves and to all men. Prove all things, hold fast that which is good;
abstain from all appearance of evil: Greet all the Brethren with an holy kiss.

To the KINGS most Excellent MAJESTY, Charles the II.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
THis Moderate Apology, for Indulging just Christian Liberty, to truly Tender
Consciences, ( not separating from the Public Liturgy of the Church of
England) in Not Bowing at, or to the name of Jesus, and Not Kneeling in the Act
of Receiving, ( except some short Additions, suiting it to the present
Occasion) was compile^, and part of it At the end of Lame Giles his Haltings,
1630.
Printed, thirty two years since, for my own Necessary Defense, and others
Satisfaction.

The chief cause of its present Publication, is the Justification of Two of
Your Majesty's Royal, Christian Indulgences to Tender Consciences, generally
promised in Your Gracious Letter and Declaration from Breda, ( the contents
whereof so miraculously Bowed the Hearts of all Your English Subjects,
notwithstanding their former disloyal Engagements and Oppositions against Your
Undoubted Hereditary Right, to reign over them as their KING, that they all as
one man, immediately dispatched the self-same Message to Your then Exiled
Majesty, as the men of 2 Samuel: 19.14 15
Judah did to their King David, ( when thrust out of his Kingdom by Absoloms
Usurpation) Return thou and all thy Servants,) And since Your Majesty's most
glorious Return from thence, and Happy Restoration, thus really performed, and
particularly granted, expressed in Your October. 5. 1660
Royal Declaration to all Your Loving Subjects of Your Realm of England, and
Dominion of Wales, concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs.

Page 16, 17*
Provided, That none shall be denied the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, though
they do not use the Gesture of Kneeling in the Act of Receiving.

No man shall be compelled to bow at the Name of JESUS, or suffer in any kind
for not doing it.

Which Indulgent Declaration so ravished the Hearts of all Your Loving
Subjects, that Your whole House of Commons (their Representatives) then
assembled in Parliament, immediately after its Publication, November. 9. 16^0.
repaired in a Body to Whitehall, and there by their Speakers Oration in the
Banqueting House, expressed their extraordinary great Joy, and presented their
general Thanks to Your Majesty, for this Your most gracious Declaration, and
dispensation with their Consciences in these and other matters, not being of
the substance or essence of Religion; which gave abundant satisfaction to all
peaceable, sober-minded men, and such as are truly Religious; In which return
of their Thanks they were all unanimous, Nemine Contradicente, then Ordering a
Bill to be drawn in pursuance of Your Majesty's Directions therein.

Yet notwithstanding the premises, such was the Presumption of an
Over-Ceremonious Doctor, ( though Chaplain to Your Majesty) as May 20. 1^^^.
soon after publicly to deny the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to my self, and
other Members of the Commons House ( when ordered to receive it all together in
St. Margarets Church, at the beginning of this Parliament) because we kneeled
not down to receive it from his hand, ^raving the benefit of Your Majesty's
Declaration, and Liberty to receive it sitting, being the gesture which Here
proved, p. 65, 66, 67, 68.
Christ himself and his Apostles used at its first institution and celebration;
who (as Homil. 82. in Mat. c. 26.

to celebrate and receive the Lords Supper sitting; to Thomas Beacon, Here p. 71.
signify thereby, that they were then come to their Journeys end, the
perfection of Religion and Sacraments.

This public contempt of Your Majesty's Declaration, seconded with the
sedulous Endeavors of others, totally to deprive Your loyal, peaceable
conscientious Subjects, constantly resorting to Common Prayer, the Lords
Supper, and all Gods public Ordinances without separation, of all the
Indulgence^ therein expressly granted and really intended to them by Your
Majesty, to their great Disconsolation, in Derogation of Your Royal Prerogative

Head on Earth of the Church of England, as well in and over all Causes as
Persons. Ecclesiastical, who have no Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, but what is
derived to them by, from, and under Your Majesty, nor any power^ to control
Your Majesty's Dispensations, or Christian compassions to tender Consciences,
have engaged me, ( out of Duty to Your Majesty, sincere desires to prevent all
future Scismes in matters merely Indifferent and Ceremonial, and to wipe off
those unjust aspersions usually cast upon them, for not bowing at or to the
Name of Jesus, or not kneeling at the Lords Supper, as Persons obstinately
Scismatical, void of all Grounds of Scripture, Reason, Conscience, Antiquity,
inducing them to scruple or omit these Ceremonies;) to publish this Apology in
their behalf, consisting of Three Serious and Sober Inquiries; Wherein all the
Arguments, Reasons, Authorities for Bowing at or to the Name of Jesus, either
as a pretended Duty, or necessary Ceremony, grounded on Philippians 2.9, 10,
11. are largely examined, refuted, retorted, and those for Sitting or Kneeling
in the Act of Receiving the Lords Supper, summarily discussed, with such
Christian Ingenuity, and Moderation, as (I humbly conceive) will give ample
satisfaction to Your Majesty, and the most zealous Champions for these
Ceremonies, that their Nonconformity to their use, proceeds not from any
Scismatical humor, singularity, or discontent, ( as is usually suggested) but
from such solid grounds of Scripture, Reason, and such Authorities,
Antiquities, as have fully convinced their Judgments, satisfied or scrupled
their tender Consciences, that they cannot Romans 14.23.
in faith or conscience* submit to practice them, at least upon such
unsatisfactory Pretenses of Scripture, Reason, Antiquity, or apparent Mistakes,
as have hitherto been alleged for their use, by those who have most enforced
them. And that as there were just Grounds in point of Royal Justice, Piety,
Clemen^y, Christian compassion, State Policy, and Prudence for Your Sacred
Majesty, at first to grant th^se Indulgences to tender Consciences, to prevent
all future Scismes, preserve Your Kingdoms, Churches public Peace, and
Christian Amity, Unity, Communion among Your Protestant Subjects; So there are
the like reasons for Your Majesty to continue, if not perpetuate them, without
enforcing them against their Consciences, so far as either totally to debar
them the Lords Supper, or drive them from the public Ordinances, or inevitably
to subject them to Ecclesiastical censures, to their great vexation.

For which end, I shall most humbly crave leave to present these ensuing
Particulars to Your Majesty's Royal, and others Christian consideration.

1. That 1 Timothy 1.17. Iud. 25.
God only wise, ( the sole Exodus 25.40. Isay 33.22. Mat. 4.10. c. 15.9. John
^.20, to 25. c. 15.10. Psalm 40 6. Isaiah 1.1^. Heb. 8.5. Iam. ^.12. Mat. 28.20.
1 Cor. 11.23.
Author, Prescriber, Owner of his own Divine worship and Sacraments) has left
all Cor^oral gestures relating thereunto, free, arbitrary, and indifferent to
all Christians, N^tions, Churches, Ages, not particularly or precisely
commanding in the Old or New Testament, either the gestures of Kneeling,
Sitting, Standing, Bowing, or Prostration in Public or Private Prayer,
Thanksgiving, Fasts, hearing or reading his Word, receiving Sacraments, or any
other part of Divine worship, though he has absolutely commanded th^se Duties
themselves. The reason is apparent, because these Gestures are in themselves
things merely indifferent, and one Gesture may be more decent, expedient to
^tir up affection, devotion, reverence, attention, upon several em^rgent
occasions, in relation to the same, or different persons, duties, times, than
another; and many men by reason of age, sickness, infirmities, temper of body,
custom of Countries, Nations, (which See Centur. Magd. ^, to 14. cap. 6. and
purchase his Pilgrimage.
vary from each other) inconveniency of Place, crowds of People, or the like,
may be disabled to use one Gesture with so much devotion or convenience as they
can use another: For which Reasons in numerou^ Congregations no absolute
Uniformity in these Gestures can possibly be expected, nor rationally enjoined
by any humane Powers, since God himself the Supreme Legislator upon these
grounds, has left them free and arbitrary to his People, as August* ad

John Bu^ges, Paybody, with others quoted by them.
all Divines acknowledge; whence the Church, Saints, Apostles, Children of God
in all Ages, both under the Law and Gospel, (as Scripture Presidents
demonstrate) have by Gods approbatio^ sometimes prayed and worshipped God Number.

and Spirits ( which he principally 1 Samuel 16.7. 1 Chronicles. 28.9. John 4.23, 24.
regards, requires, in his worship) were upright, sincere, and their Duties
performed with that Faith, Fervency, Holiness, and cheerful Obedience, which
he commands.

2 ly. That the Primitive Saints, Christians, Church, and all other Churches
since ^ave freely used, tolerated varieties of Gestures, Postures, Ceremonies
in all parts of Divine worship, and have free liberty to alter, change or
abolish Ceremonies at their pleasure; as all Ecclesiastical Histories (
especially Centuriae Magdeburgenses* 2, to 14. cap. 6. De Ritibus and
Ceremoniis) at large demonstrate; and the Church of England resolves in her 20.
A^ticle of Religion, and the Preface to the Books of Common Prayer, why some
Ceremonies are abolished.

3 ly. That the principle end of Gods instituting Kings, Magistrates, and Chief
Authority, Trust by him reposed in them, is, To b^ Gods subordinate Romans 13.1,
to 7.1 Pet 2.13.14, 20 Ps. 101 ^im. 1.9, 10. Ezr. 7.26.
Ministers to protect, encourage, commend all their Subjects who do well,
obeying the Laws and will of God according to his Word; and to punish none but
evil Doers, and Transgressors of his Laws in relation to his Worship: not to
punish their Christian Subjects who obey Gods Laws, resort constantly to his
public Ordinances, Worship, Sacraments, only ^or not using such and such
Gestures, Ceremonies, V^stures, which himself has left free and indifferent to
all Christians; or to fine, imprison, excommunicate, or debar them totally from
the Lords Supper, only for using the selfsame Gestures, Ceremonies, as Christ
himself, his Apostles, and the Primitive Christians used; for which there is no
President in Scripture, nor in the Sea my Sword of Christian Magistracy
supported, p. 35, to 79.
Laws of any ancient Christian Emperors to the best of my remembrance.

4 ly. That though Christian Kings and Church Governors have Authority to Acts
15.28, 29, 30, 31. c. 16 4. 1 Cor. 14.34, 35, 40. Articles of the Church of
England* Artic. 20.
prescribe and enjoin things absolutely necessary and expedient, warranted by
the Word, in and about Gods public worship, and to 1 Cor. 7, to 10.25, 26,
etc. c. ^1.4, to 18.
advise and persuade the use of Things decent, expedient, though not simply
necessary: Yet it is the Opinion of many judicious Divines, that they cannot
impose or enforce the use of Ceremonies, Gestures merely expedient o^^^^^ent,
not absolut^ly necessary, on the Consciences of their Christian Subjects, under
Civil or Eccles^astical penalties: at l^astwise that it is not expedient or
convenient for them to exercise such a Power, because Christ himself, the 1 Timothy 6.15. Rev. 19.16.
King of Kings, his Apostles, and the most Religious Kings of Gods appointment,
never exercised or claimed any such Jurisdiction, but left all Christians free,
actually to use or not use them at their pleasure; as in the cases of 1 Cor.
7.1, 2, 3, 5, to 10. and 16. to the end. 1 Timothy 4.4.
Marriage, Virginity, and single life; of Act. 10. Romans 14. 1 Cor. 8. Col.
2.16. to the end. 1 Timothy 4.1, to 8.
eating or abstaining from certain Meats, observing certain times and days to
God; of 1 Cor. 11.2. to 17. Rev. 9.8.
men's praying and prophesying in the Church with their heads covered, wearing
long Effeminate hair, and women's sitting in the Congregation with their heads
unvailed, and 1 Timothy 2.9. 1 Pet. 3.3, ^. Tertullian De Velandis Virginibus, and
De habitu Mulie^um.
Brayding or Frizling their hair, ( which most conceive to be absolutely
prohibited, not simply advised, as well as their 1 Cor. 14.34, 35. 1 Timothy 2.11,
12.
speaking in the Church) yet not now prohibited by any Ecclesiastical penal
Laws or Censures of our Church, though more scandalous, less arbitrary and
indifferent than sitting at the Sacrament, kneeling, or standing in Prayer,
bowing, or any other Rites or Ceremonies, now scrupled or omitted by Tender
Consciences.

5 ly. That the Unity which God himself requires in his Church, and Public
worship, amongst his People and Children, is not an Universal Uniformity in
external gestures, Ceremonies, wherein the Scripture is totally silent, but a
EZ^. 8.1.2, etc. Ps. 122.1, 2, 3, 4. Ps. 133.1. Ephesians 4.3, 13. John 17.11, 20*

Zeph. 3.9 Isai. 2.2, 3. Mich 4.1, 2, ^. Jer. 50.4, 5* 1 Pet. 2.8.
Unity in the Faith and substance of his worship, a meeting together with one
accord, and with one consent, in one place, to pray, praise and worship God,
with one heart, mind, soul, spirit, according ^o his word, (^ot with one kind
of vesture, gesture, or posture of their bodies) and to keep the Unity of the
Spirit in the Bond of Peace, like Christian Brethren not Heb. 10.24, 25.
forsaking or separating from Gods Public Ordinances by Law established on the
one hand, nor cas^ing brethren out of the Church John 9.10.
(Diotrephes like for not conforming in gestures or ceremonie^, on the other
hand.) Hence all particular Churches, Christians, and Professors of the Gospel,
dispersed throughout the world, agreeing all together in the Ephesians. 4.3* 4, 5*

Unity of the Faith, are by God himself called, reputed, but One Catholic
Church, and One Body, United together under One Head Jesus Christ, quickened,
inlivened by one and the selfsame Spirit; although they differ in their
particular Rites, Ceremonies, Gestures, Liturgies, Languages; as the various,
different Members in the Body natural, being all united together under one
Head, make up but 1 Cor. 12.^4, to 27.
one entire Body: And men of various Callings, Professions, Qualities, Degrees,
living under the same King, Laws, Government* agreeing in aliquo tertio, make
up but one Kingdom, Corporation, or Body Politic, though they diff^r from
each other in their particular Callings, Habits, Ages, Degrees, Estates,
Opinion^, 1 Cor. 14. Acts 2* 1, to ^3.
Languages, Gestures, and other personal circumstances. If we look into all our
great Cathedral or Parish Churches, we shall see thousands or hundreds of
people jointly resorting to Gods public Ordinances, Worship, Sacraments
celebrated in them, yet varying from each other in their Dignities, Sexes,
Ages, Callings, Conditions, Estates, Vestments, Attir^s, Fashions, Features,
yea private Opinions, Voyce^, Corporal g^stures; some of them sitting in seats,
others in galleries, others on forms; others standing in allies; here Psalm.

promis^uously together, otherwhere men and women, fitting or standing apart

Christians who approve and frequent Gods publik* Ordinances, Sacraments in our
Church, be sequestered from them, or any ways molested as Non-conformists or
Schismatics, only not for bowing, kneeling or standing up when others do? or
for sitting at the Sacrament as Christ and his Apostles did, whiles others
receive it kneeling? only against the bare advice or direction, not peremptory
Injunction of the Rubricks, or other Ecclesiastical Canon^.

Occasion of all ancient, modern Schisms in, and Separations from our own and
other Churches, yea, of most unchristian divisions, contentions in them, and of
intestine Wars, commotions between Christians; has been the over-rigid
enforcing of mere human Rites, Ceremonies, gestures, Inventions in Gods
Worship, by ambitious usurping Popes, Prelates, and Clergymen, against the
rules of Christian Liberty, Charity, and our Saviors Commission to his
Apostles. Mat. 28.19, 20.

Doctrines, Traditions, or Humane Inventions. And this (if truly examined) was
the original of all our late intestine Schisms, Wars, Tumults, which Christian
Moderation, Liberty, and Indulgence in these particulars, would easily have
prevented, and will be the best antidote against the like future Maladies, as
Your Majesty intimates in Your Royal Declarations and Speeches.

7 ly. That God himself having 1 Cor. 9.16, 17, etc. Mat. 28.19, 20. 2 Timothy
4.1.2. Acts 20.28. John 21.15.16, 17. 1 Pet. 2.5.
laid a necessity and peremptory Precept upon all conscientiou^ Ministers, to
preach the Gospel, and Administer the Sacraments to their Flocks, and also
commanded the people to Isaiah 55.3. Ioh. 10.3, 10* 17. Mat. 8.8, 21. 1 Cor.

Conscience to obey God, who enjoynes them, rather than men, who prohibit them.
Therefore no Christian Magistrates, or Church Governors can in Conscience or
Prudence (unless they will Act^ 5.39.
^ight even against God, in Gamal^els resolution) prohibit or debar them from
performing their duties, or resorting to Gods Ordinances or Sacraments, only
for Nonconformity to such Gestures or Ce^emonies which God has left free and
indifferens to them, and are no essential parts of, or nec^ssary appurtenances
to his Worship.

These 8. Considerations, together with that Divine O^acle of the wisest of
Kings, Prove. 20.28. Mercy and Truth preserve the King, and his Throne is
upholden by Mercy (engraven no doubt in Your Majesty's Royal Heart with
indelible Characters) super added to the Three Serious and Sober Inqui^ies here
humbly prostrated at Your Majesty's feet, and submitted to Your most Gracious
perusal, and Judicious Royal censure, will ( in my weak apprehension)
abundantly satisfy all the Reverend Bishops and Clergy of our Church, with all
Your soberminded Subjects, studious of Your Majesty's Honor, or our Churches
tranquillity, that there are as just Ground for Your Majesty to continue and
perpetuate Your premised Indulgences to tender Consciences, as at first to
grant them; That so all Your Loyal and Loving Subjects, though of different
Persuasions, may have still cause to proclaim to all the world with public Joy
and Triumph, ( after so many late tragical Revolutions of public Governors
and Governments in order to their just desired Civil and Christian Liberties)
this assertion of the Poet, Claudian De L^udibi^^ S^^liconis, l. 3.

inventions or new Ceremonies super-added thereunto, (which the Bishops and
Church of Rome, with other Churches, Prelates have overmuch forgotten,
transgressed, to the prejudice of Christianity) worthy to be perpetually
engraven in their very Souls.

The first serious and sober Inquiry concerning Bowing at the name of JESUS.
SECTION 1.
Whether bowing at every Pronunciation of the name Jesus, be a Duty commanded,
or Ceremony warranted by Philip. 2. v. 9, 10, 11?

THe bowing of the Knee, head, and capping at every recital of the name of
Jesus, is grounded by all its patriots on the text aforesaid, Phil. 2.9.10, 11.
Wherefore, God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is
above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in
heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue
should confess; that Jesus Christ is Lord, to (or in) the Quia Domiminus Jesus
in gloria est Dei Patris: hoc est, in natura and gloria Deitatis, id est,
e^usdem est gloriae and aequalitatis: Or, in aequalitate potestatis and natura
divinitatis. So Prim^sius, Sedulius, Remigius, Haymo, with sundry others read
and expound it.
glory of God the Father.

But this Text, if rightly read and understood gives no color at all to this
p^etended Duty or Ceremony. To make this apparent, I shall first clear the Text
from a gross mistranslation of it, purposely made to countenance this Ceremony.

First therefore, take notice, that the word (At) is ^oisted into the Text
instead of ( In,) the true translation and reading thereof being, that In, not
At, the name of Jesus every Knee should bow, etc. the Greek Original Text in
all Copies and Greek Fathers is, (...), and all Latin, or Greek Fathers
translated into Latin, with all Latin Translations whatsoever (except Beza
and Castalio) all Latin Commentators, Expositors, whether Papists or
Protestants (those only who follow Beza and Castalio their Translations
excepted, being but three or four) render it, In nomine Jesus, where ever they
recite this Text, not Ad, or Apud Nomen. True it is, that Beza and Castalio,
and they only render it Ad nomen, that To (not At) the name of Jesus every
Knee should bow; But then they also interpret this Name to be nothing else, but
Christ's Sovereign Power and Dominion, not his Name Jesus. All others read it,
In Nomine Jesus: Neither is there any one Author, Expositor, or Translator
extant, besides these and their few followers, that ^ead it Ad Nome^, as all
Scholars must acknowledge. The ancient Manuscript English translations, of
which I have seen diverse Copies, sorts; the several old printed English
translations of Mr. William Tindall, Mr. Miles Coverdale. Thomas Matthew; The
Bishops Bible set forth at first by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury:
since revised and published by the Bishops, Anno 1595. The Epistles and Gospels
in Latin and English printed at Paris 1558 Erasmus his ancient English
Paraphrase commanded to be had in all Churches by Injunct. 61.
Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions, and the Canons of 1571. Dr. Fulk, and Mr.
Cartwright, in their answers to the Rhemish Testament, All of these render this
Text In, not At the Name Jesus, etc. So do all our ancient English Writers, who
recite it, as Bishop Latimer, Bishop Hooper, Bishop Ridley, Bishop Alle^,
Bishop Tonstall, Tho: Beacon, Tho: Palfryman, John Veron, Mr. Fox, Mr. Nowell,
Lancelot Ridley, with a world of others; who read it, In the Name, etc. and the
Common-prayer-books, both of King Edw. 6. Queen Elizabeth, King James, and King
Charles, ratified by several Acts of Parliament, in the Epistle on the Sunday
next before Easter, until the year 1629. all read it, In the Name of Jesus;
which Mr. John Cozens (a great Patriot of this Ceremonious bowing) well
considering, and knowing it gave a fatal blow to this bowing at the Name of
Jesus, I know not by what Authority, caused the Common-prayer-books to be
corrected, (in truth, corrupted, perverted) in this particular, changeing In,
into At the name; by means whereof, most, if not all our Common-prayer-books,
printed ^ince the year 1629. render it, At the Name, whereas all before that
year read it most truly, In the Name, according to the Original. I must
confess that the English Geneva Bible, Anno 1570. (which Conference at Hampton
Court, p. 46.
King James affirmed to be the worst Translation of all others, and was never
read publicly in our Churches,) renders it, At the Name; which grew from the
mis-englishing of Mr. Beza his Ad Nomen, which, in truth signifies To, (not At)
the Name, if duly Englished. Neither can our Bowers at the Name Jesus take much
advantage hence, if Mr. Beza be rightly translated, because they all confess,
Mr. Page his justification of Bowing at the name of Jesus.
that they do not bow to the Name but Person of Jesus, only at the recital of
this Name. True it is, the last English translation (made by See the Conference
at Hampton Court. p. 45, 46.
King James special appointment) reads it At the Name, contrary to the Book of
Common Prayer, and all former English translations approved by our Church. How
this came to pass, I shall relate from credible Dr. Bret, and others of note^
Note this.
information. When this new Translation of the Bible was fully finished by the
Translatours, and presented to King James, he appointed Bishop Andrews to have
the last perusal of it, who thereupon dealt with it, as Mr. Cozens since did
with the Common Prayer Book, and turned the Translatours In, into At, without
their privity or approbation; as making best for the Ceremony of Bowing at the
name of Jesus, which he had a little before (and since too) p^eached for in a
On Phil. 2.9, 10, 11.
Court Sermon; by which means our last Translation now renders this Text, At
the name, whereas the Translatours (according to the former English Editions)
had truly rendered it In the name.

Now, that this (...), ought to be translated, In, not Ad nomen, at, or to the
name, is infallible.

First, because it is so Englished in all See Acts 3 6, and ^. 27, 29. c. 16.18
and 1 Cor. 5 4. Ephesians 5.20. 2 These. 3.6 In which places the Greek is the very
same, as in this text, and Eng^^sh^d In the name of Jesus.
other texts of Scripture whatsoever, this phrase AT the name, being used in no
place else but this throughout the Bible, nor yet in any English Author extant
that I have seen or found, but In the name, only; Now why it should here alone
be translated At (not In) the name, and in no other place, no reason can be
given, unless it be purposely to support this Ceremony of bowing at the Name
Jesus, which else would fall to ground, which makes this Translation here the
more suspicious.

Secondly, At the name, is neither good English, nor good Sense; For, though we
use In or At promiscuou^ly, when they relate either to a time or place, a^ In a
time, or At a time; In such an hour or day; A^ such a day or hour; In such a
place, street, town, house; At such a place, street, town or house; yet we
never use them so when In relates to God's, Christ's, King's, or any man's Name
or Authority, there being no such English expression, as At the name, extant in
any Author, W^^t, Warrant, or used in any Scripture-text, but this only. That
this Expression is neither good English nor Sense, these instances will
manifest; where the same Greek phrase and words, (...), are used, Acts 3.6
Peter spoke thus to the Creeple, In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise
up and walk: should this Text be rendered, At the name of Jesus rise up and
walk, it would mar both the English and Sense too. Acts 9 27, 29. I^ is
recorded of St. Paul, that he spoke boldly I^ the name of the Lord Jesus;
should we read it, He spoke boldly* ^t the name of the Lord Jesus, it would be
plain nonsense. Acts 16.12. Paul spoke thus to the Spirit in the Damsel
possessed with the Spirit of Divination, I command thee In the name of Jesus
Christ to come out of her; turn this Text into At the Nam^ of Jesus I command
thee to come out o^ her, and you deprave it quite. So 1 Cor 5.4, 5. In the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my Spirit, with
the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such an one unto Satan; ^ender
this, At the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. and you vitiate both the
English and meaning, Ephesians. 5.20. Giving thanks always for all things unto God
and the Father In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; translate this Giving
thanks, etc. At the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you man the Sense and
Text, 2 These. 3.6. We command you Brethren (says the Apostle) In the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your selves from every broth^r that
walks disorderly; turn this In into At the Name, and all the sense is
spoiled. So Math. 21.9. The multitude that went before our Savior into
Jerusalem, cried, Bl^ssed is he that com^th in the name of the Lord; transform
this into, Blessed is he that comes At the name of the Lord, and you deform it
quite, John 14.13, 14. Whatsoever ye shall ask In my name, I will do it; read
this, Whatsoever ye shall ask At my name, you spoil all the Text. Acts 10.48.
And he commanded them to be baptized In the name of the Lord; render this He
commanded them to be baptized At the name of the Lord, and it is pure
Nonsense. In all these Texts the Greek is (...), the sam^ verbatim with that
of Phil. 2. Mat. 28.19. Christ says to his Disciples, Go ye therefore and
teach all Nations, baptizing them in the ^ame of the Father, of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost; translate this Baptizing them At the name of the Father, of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, you spoil both the English, sense, and Baptism
too. There is nothing more common in Scripture than these phrases, used in
hundreds of places, In the name of the Lord, In my name, and the like; Or
translate. Rest, H^pe, Trust, Rej^yce, Deligh^, Glory, Stand ^ast IN the Lord.
Faithful IN the Lord, speaking bold^y IN the Lord; which dye IN the Lord etc
(used above 100. times in Scripture) Into rest, hope trust, ^ejoyce, delight
glory, stan^ fast, faithful, speaking boldly, which die AT the Lord: Or Tit.
2.2. Sound in Faith i^ Chari^y, in Pa^i^n^e, into so^nd at faith, at cha^ity,
at p^tience, Or b^^sse, speak pray, etc. IN thy name; Into bless, speak pray
AT thy name; and you quite destroy the sense, and Eng^ish ^oo of all th^se
s^cred Precepts^ Texts.
Translate any of all these into At the name, and you pervert them quite. Turn
but, I believe in God, to I believe at God; Our Father which art in heaven, to
Our Father which art at heaven; Or the ordinary phrase of our Warrants, and of
his Majesty's Officers, These are to require, or, I charge and require you in
the Kings, or, in his Majesty's Name, into I charge and require you at the
Kings, or, at his Majesty's name; Or our most common speech, Go to such a man
in my name, to Go to him at my name, and you quite corrupt both the ^nglish and
sense in each o^ them: So that the Translators of this text of Philip. 2.10.11.
That In the name of Jesus (that is, In the virtue of the supreme Sovereign
Power, Lordship, Godhead, Authority of Jesus Christ at the general day of
Judgment, when all things, that is, All men, all Angels, Spirits, good and
bad, in heaven, earth, hell, shall stand before hi^ Person and tribunal, as
their supreme Lord and Judge, as Isay 45.23. Romans 14.9, 10, 11. Rev. 5.12, 13,
14 expound it) by changing it into At the name of Iesus^ (that is, at the
hearing or mentioning o^ the name Jesus in time of Divine service, as the
Patriots of this Ceremony glos^e it,) have marred both the English, and quite
perverted the meaning of this sacred Text, only to maintain this Ceremony.

It is evident then by all these concurrent parallel authorities, that the true
translation of this Text is this, That In, (not At) the name of Jesus every
knee should bow (or be bowed, in the passive tense;) which will almost quite
subvert the bowing at the name jesus. ^or^ the words being thus truly rendered,
can never be prope^ly expounded or strained to this sense. That in the name
Jesus, (to wit, at or in every naming of the word Jesus, or when ever the name
Jesus is mentioned in the Church in time of Divine service of Sermons) every
knee, or Head then present should bow; there being no One pa^allel text in
Scripture, wherein the name of God or Jesus, is or can properly be interpreted
at the mentioning, or at or in the naming of God or Jesus; But they must
necessarily be expounded in this sense, In the name of God, or Jesus, that is,
In the supreme Power, Majesty, Sovereignty, Authority of God, or the Lord
Jesus: In the name, being oftentimes used for, In the Sovereign Power and
Authority of God, of Jesus, or Christ only; not for the bare names God, Jesus,
or Christ, as Mat. 28 19. Acts 3.6. and 16, 18. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. 2 Thessalonians. 3.16.
Mat. 7.22. Mar. 9.38. ^uc. 10.17. Mar. 16.17, 18. See also 1 Samuel 17 45. Psalm.
8.1. Psalm. 10.1, 5. Psalm. 33.21. Psalm. 44.5. Psalm. 48 10. Psalm. 54.1. Psalm.
89.24. Psalm. 118.10, 11, 12. Psalm. 124.8. Prove. 18.10. Esaias 50.10. and 64.^.
all to the same purpose. Thus all Justices, Judges, Officers in their Warrants
use the word Name, when they w^ite, These are to will and require you in the
King^ Name, (that is, In or by virtue of his royal authority, not of any
Christen name or Surname of his) to do thus and thu^.

The true translation of this text being thus cleared, (which I hope to see
accordingly amended in all our New printed Bibles and Common Prayer Books, by
rechanging At, into In the Name, by public authority and command from the King
or Parliament in case the Bishops neglect it) and the meaning thereof in part
discovered, I shall next examine the true genuine sense o^ the words. For the
full understanding whereof so far forth only as respects this Ceremony of
bowing at the name Jesus) these 4* things are to be inquired, 4. Quaeres.
1. What is meant by the name above every name, which 2ly. What is here m^ant
by bo^ing of every knee? 3ly. What, by things in Heaven, Earth, and under the
4ly. When, and where this bowing of every knee shall be?


1. Quaere.
For the first: Most Expositors generally accord, that this Name above every
name which God gave to Christ, is nothing else but his supreme Power and
jurisdiction, or his inherent real Sovereign Lordship, as he is both God and
Man, over all things and creatures whatsoever; or, which is all one, his real
title Lord, (given him above 50 times in the New Testament in direct terms) or
Lord of all things, coupled with his actual fr^ition of his suprem^ Lordship.
That this, and naught else is in truth the name intended in this text, is most
perspicuous, not only by the forequoted Scriptures, where name is used for
Sovereignty, Power, Authority, but also by direct texts; as Ephesians. 1.19, 20,
21, 22. According to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in
Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in
heavenly places, far above all princip^lity, power, and might, and dominion,
and every Name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is
to come, and has put all things under his ^eet, and gave him to be head over
All things to his Church. Here, the Apostle uses Name, for principality,
power, dominion, or Lordship; and makes the name above all name, given to
Christ at his Exaltation, nothing else but his supreme Lordship over all
things; which Christ himself acknowledges, Mat. 28.18 where he tells his
Disciples after his Resurrection, All power is given unto me in heaven and
earth. St. Peter in his Sermon Acts 2.32, to 36. after he had spoken of the
Passion of Christ, concludes thus of his Resurrection and Dominion; This Jesus
has God raised up, etc. for, David is not ascended into the heavens, but says
himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footstool; Therefore, let all the house of Israel know, that
God has made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both LORD and Christ. The
making of Christ (then) after his Resurrection as God and Man, Lord over all,
was the name above every name, which God, then, gave to Christ, who is Lord of
all, as the same Apostle Peter affirms in his Sermon to Cornelius, Act. 10.36.
Yea Lord over all; Romans 10.9.12. and King of Kings and Lord of Lords, 1 Timothy
6.15. Rev. 17.14. chap. 19.16. That observable text Romans 14 6, to 13. will make
this most clear, He that regards the day regards it unto the Lord, and he
that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats,
eats to the Lord; for, he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the
Lord he eats not and gives God thanks; for none of us lives to himself, or
dies to himself; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord, or whither we
die, we die unto the Lord Whether therefore, we live or die, we are the Lords.
For, to this end Christ both died and rose and revived (mark this well) that he
might be Lord both of Quick and Dead. But, why do thou judge thy Brother? or
why do thou set at naught thy Bro^her? we must all stand before the judgment
s^at of Christ; for, it is written, as I live, says the Not Jesus.
Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God. So
then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.

Here the Apostle expressly resolves, that the Name given to Christ by God his
Father, after his Resurrection, was nothing else, but Lord, yea Lord both of
quick and dead; And that this bowing of every knee prophesied by Isay c. 45,
23. and alluded unto in Phil. 2.10, 11. is nothing else but the Appearance,
Submission and Subjection of all men and Angels to him, as their supreme Lord,
when they shall stand before his Tribunal, in the day of Judgment; not any
bowing of the Knee, or stirring of the Cap unto him, when his Name Jesus is
mentioned in the Church, where the greatest part of men never yet appeared, nor
resorted unto in any age. If all these direct parallel Scriptures be not
sufficient or satisfactory enough to prove and evidence this hi^ Name Lord, or
his Sovereign Dominion over all Creatures, as God equal with his Father, to be
the Name above every Name, in which all Knees must bow, the text it self
unanswerably resolves it. For, that Name above every Name, in which all Knees
must bow, is that Name only which every tongue must confess; the text it self
assuring us so much, and coupling the bowing of the knee, and confession of the
tongue both together. But the Name which every tongue shall confess, is this,
That Jesus Christ is LORD, Phil. 2.11. Therefore Lord must be that Name above
every Name, in which every knee must bow. This is the Name by which all
persons, Good and Bad, Pagans and Christians, Jews and Gentiles, all Angels and
Devils shall call Christ at the last day of Judgment, the only time when this
Scripture shall be actually fulfilled. Which day, as it is Acts 2.20. 1 Thessalonians.
5 2. 2 Pet 3.10 Rev. 1.18. and chap. 5.14.
often called, The day of the Lord, and Christ coming to Judgment, the
coming of the Lord; and He (with referrence to this day) the Lord: So himself
expressly says, that Good and Bad shall then jointly confess him to be, and
call him Lord, witness Mat. 7.21, 22. and 15.11. Not every one that says unto
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, etc. Many will say to
me in that day, (to wit, the day of Judgment) Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy Name? etc. But most full and express is that of Mat. 25.35, to 45. When
the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his Holy Angels with him, then
shall he sit upon the Throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all
Nations, and he shall separate them one from another, as a Shepherd divides
his Sheep from the Goats. And he shall set the Sheep on his right hand, and the
Goats on his lest; Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye
blessed of my Father, etc. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, LORD*
when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee, etc. (Here we have all the Sheep,
that is, all righteous men at the day of Judgment, joyntl^ calling Christ
LORD, whiles they stand before his Tribunal receiving a sentence of absolution,
and a Heavenly Kingdom.) Then shall he say to them also on the left hand,
Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, etc. Then shall they also say
unto him, LORD, when saw we thee an hungered, etc. Here we have all the Goats,
that i^, all wicked men whosoever, at the day of Judgment, jointly calling
Christ LORD, to the glory of God the Father; Therefore this name LORD, being
unquestionably the name above every name, which every tongue shall then jointly
confess, must be the name above every name, in which every knee must bow, as
these scriptures p^ove pas^ all contradiction.

To clear this up yet more fully by other Texts, consider that memorable place
of Jude 14, 15. And Enoch also the seventh from Adam, prophecyeth of these
saying* Behold the Lord comes with ten thousand of his Saints, to execute
Judgment upon all, (in the general day of Judgment) and to convince all that
are ungodly among them of their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken
against him. Then compare it with Psalm. 96. and 98. which thus prophecy of
Christ's Kingdom, and coming to judge the world under this very Title of LORD,
repeated no less th^n 16. times. O sing unto the LORD a new Song, sing unto
the LORD all the earth: Sing unto the LORD, etc. For the LORD is great, and
greatly to be feared, he is to be feared above all Gods. F^r all the Gods of
the Nations are idols, but the LORD mad^ the heavens; Honor and Majesty are
before him, strength and beauty are in his Sanctuary. Give unto the LORD (O ye
kinreds of the people) give unto the LORD glory and strength; Give unto the
LORD the glory due unto his name, etc. O worship the LORD in the beauty of
holiness, fear before him all the earth. Say among the Heathen, that the LORD
reigns, he shall judge the people righteously, etc. Make a joyful noise
before the LORD the King; Let the heavens rejoice, etc. before the LORD, for ^e
comes to Judge the Earth: he shall judge the world See Isay 11.4.
with righteousness, and the people with his truth. So Psalm. 7, 8. The LORD
shall judge the people, judge me O LORD according to my righteousnes^. Psalm
110.1.6. The LORD said unto my LORD, sit thou at my right hand until I make
thine enemies thy footstool, etc. The LORD at thy right hand shall strike
through Kings in the day of his wrath; he shall judge among the Heathen. Psalm.
135.13, 14. Thy name O LORD endures for ever, thy memorial O LORD to all
Generations, for the LORD will judge his people Isay 3.13.14 The LORD will
stand up to Judge the people; the LORD will enter into judgment with the
ancients of his people. Peruse Joel 3.13. to 18. Mich. 4.2. to 8. where Christ
in relation to judging all Nations and People, is frequently styled LORD by way
of prophecy, before his incarnation or resurrection, and compare th^se
Scriptures with others in the New Testament after his resurrection; as 2 Timothy
4.1. I charge thee before God, and the LORD Jesus Christ who shall judge the
quick and the dead, at his appearing and his kingdom: 2 Thessalonians. 1.7, 8, 9, 10.
When the LORD Jesus shall be r^vealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in
flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and ^bey not the
Gospel of our LORD Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting
destruc^ion from the presence o^ the LORD, and from the glory of his power,
when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints. etc. Rev. 4.8.11. Holy, holy,
holy LORD God almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. (to wit, to
Judgment) Thou art worthy O LORD to receive glory, honor and power, for thou
have created all things, and for thy pleasure they were and are created. Rev.
19.1, 2. Salvation, and honor and power be unto the LORD our God, for true and
righteous are his judgme^ts. 1 T^ess. 4.15, etc. We who are alive and remain
unto the coming of the LORD shall not prevent them which are asl^ep; For the
LORD himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
Archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in
the clouds, to meet the LORD in the air, and so shall we ever be with the LORD
2 Thessalonians. 2.1. Now we beseech you brethren by the coming of the LORD Iesus^
Christ, and by our ga^hering together unto him. Jam. 5.7, 8, 9. Be patient
therefore, Brethren, unto the coming of the LORD, etc. For the coming of the
LORD draws nigh Behold the Judge stands before the door. Heb. 10.30.
Vengeance belongs unto me, I will recompense it, says the LORD; the LORD
shall judge his people. Act. 17.31. He has appointed a day in the which he
will judge the world in righteousness, by that man (the LORD forementioned)
whom he has ordained, whereof he has given assurance, in that he has r^ised
him from the dead. All these united to the preceding texts, and 1 Cor. 8 6. But
to us there is but ONE LORD, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
him, will abundantly evidence that name of Christ above every name, in which
every knee shall bow, and which every tongue shall confess, in the day of
Judgment at Christ's second coming, to be this Name LORD, or his Divine
Sovereign Power and Dominion, not his name Jesus.

True it is, that some See p 1. and others hereafter cited.
Interpreters (especially those Fathers who writ against the Arrians) assert,
that the name above every name in this text, is the name of GOD, interpreting,
he gave him a name above every name, in this manner; He made and manifested him
by his Resurrec^ion to be God, as well as man. But thi^, though a real truth in
it self, yet in the strict literal sense, as I take it, cannot be the name,
because Christ was God from all Eternity; and both God and man, from his womb,
not resurrection, and his Human nature cannot be properly called God, nor
honou^ed with that name, but as conjoined with his Divine in one person. Now
the name which this text speaks of, was a name principally given to him in
respect of his Humane nature, which alone was humbled and highly exalted, not
his Divine, it being incapable of Humiliation or Exaltation; and that not from
Eternity, but from the time of his Resurrection, as the words ( wherefore God
has highly ^xalted him, and given him a name above every name etc) import. God
therefore cannot properly be this name, but rather Lord, which suits with both
hi^ nature^, he being supreme Lord and Judge of all, both as he is God and man,
and made so especially from the time of his Resurrection and Ascension into
Heaven, and his Ps. 110.1, 2. Mat 22.44. Mark 12 36* Luke 20 42. Acts 2.34. 1
Cor. 15.25. Hebr. 1.13.
Session at his Fathers ^wn right hand, until his Enemies be made his
Footstool, as the forecited and subsequent Scriptures evidence.

Other Fathers and Expositors interpret this name to be his Ut filius Dei
vocaretur, etc Theodoret, Remigius, Haymo, and others.
name of the natural begotten Son of God; a name above all names given to Men
or Angels, Heb. 1.4, 5. Now Christ being mightily declared to be the Son of
God, by hi^ Resurrection from the dead, Romans 1.4. and this name being more
excellent then any of Men or Angels; Some probably from thence infer, the Son
of God, to be this name, he being so in regard of both natures. But this,
though a truth, cannot so properly (as some conceive) be the name here
intended, it being given to Christ from all Eternity, John 1.12 compared with
Heb 1.4, 5, 10. And likewise declaratively given to him at his Baptism, when
there came a voice from Heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased, Mat. 3* 17. not after his Resurrection, as the name this text
does speak of, was: This name then is rather Lord, o^ that Sovereign Lordship,
Dominion, Kingdom, which the Son of God, in r^spect of his Human^ nature,
obtained by his Resurrection, and the advancing of it to sit down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high, as supreme Lord and heir of all things, Heb. 1.2,
3, 8, 13. Col. 1.15, 16, 17, 18. Some 5 or 6 Ancients only there are of many
hundreds, who directly (not secondarily, or by way of allusion only, as others
do) make the name Jesus, the name above every name in this text; their reason
is, because the words are, that In the name of Jesus every knee shall bow. But
this is a senseless reason, for the words are not, that In the individual name
Jesus every knee should bow, which in truth had been a particular designation
of it to have been the name; but, that In the name OF Jesus (as all translate
it) every knee should bow, which words OF Jesus, are a designation only of his
Person, not of this his name. Now Jesus has many names in Scripture, as
Emanuell, Son of God, Christ, Messiah, Lord, Lamb of God, King of Kings, Lord
of Lords, Mediator, Head of the Church, Savior, God, and the like, every one
of which is the name of Jesus, representing the person of Jesus to us, though
they are not the word nor name, Jesus; so that these words resolve not Jesus to
be the name above every name, in which every knee should bow, but rather sends
us to inquire what name of Jesus it is, in which all knees must bow?

Now, that the name Jesus cannot be the name intended in this text, is
undeniable, for these th^ee reasons.

First, Because Mat. 1.21, 25. Luke 1.21, and chap 2 21.
this name was given to our Savior by the Angel, before he was conceived in
the womb, and was imposed on him at his Circumcision, by those who Circumcised
him; whereas the name above every name in this text of the Philippians, was
given to Christ after his Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, Phil. 2.9.10.

Secondly, Because Every knee of things in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth,
must bow in this name intended in this text; but this they cannot do in the
name Jesus; for Jesus is and signifies nothing else but Mat. 1.21.
a Savior, and Christ being He^. 2.26. 2 Pe^. 2.4, 5, 6, 9 Jude 6 7. Mark 5 7.
Mat. 8.29. Mat 25.41. to the end.
no Sa^iour at all to Angels, Devils, or Damned persons, it is not possible
that they should bow unto him as to their Jesus, or Savior. Now, though he be
no Jesus, nor Savior to any such as these, yet he is their Sovereign Lord and
Judge, he being the Lord, the Judge of all Angels, Devils, and Damned
Reprobates, as well as of the Elect, to whom alone he is a Savior, ^ Jesus,
and they See p. 9, 10, 11, 12.
all shall both call him their Lord, and submit unto him and his final
judgment, as their Lord at the last day. Seeing therefore every knee of things
in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, cannot bow to Christ as their Jesus,
because he is not a Jesus, or Savior to them all, but only as to their Lord,
to whom they must, shall, and will all individually and jointly submit, he
being equally a Lord to all; and since every tongue shall confess, not that
Christ is their Jesus, but that Jesus Christ is their Lord to the glory of God
the Father; the name Jesus cannot, the name Lord only must be the name above
every name, here meant, in which every knee shall bow.

every knee must bow, must be and is a name above every name, as the text
witnesses: But this name Jesus is not a name above every name, it being the
Mat. 1.21.25 Lu. 1.31. c. 2.21.
name of his humiliation, im^osed on his humane Person only, at his
Circumcision, not at his Exaltation after his Passion; a name which gives him
Dominion over his redeemed people only, not over Angels, Devils or damned
persons, to whom he is not a Savior; a name rather of love, grace, mercy, then
of Sovereign Dominion and Power; Therefore it cannot be the name above every
name to which all knees must and shall bow, mentioned in this text, but his
name Lord alone, coupled with his Sovereign, Divine power and Dominion over All
Angels, Devils, Men and Creatures whatsoever. From all which I argue thus.

If the name above every name, in which every knee must bow, be not the name
Jesus, but Lord, and the supreme Lordship, power and Dominion of Christ over
all: then there is no ground nor color in this text for any bowing, cringing,
or cappi^g at the naming of Jesus, when ever recited in the Church or elsewhere.

But, the name above every name, in which every knee must bow, mentioned in
this text, is not the name Jesus, but Lord, and the supreme Lordship, Power and
Dominion of Christ over all; as I have undenyably manife^^ed, it being that
name which every tongue shall confess, and call Christ by in the great
Judgment day.

Therefore, there is no ground nor color in this text, for any bowing, cringing
or capping at the naming of Jesus, when ever recited in the Church or elsewhere.

Having thus found out the Name in the text, 2 Quaere.
I come now to examine, What is meant by the bowing of every knee in this
Scripture? Thi^ phrase of bowing the knee, has 4. significations in sacred
Writ.

First, it is used for 1 Kings 11.18. Romans 11.4. Ephesians. 3.14 1^
adoration, when it is referred either to God, Images or Idols. Secondly, for
Genesis 41.43. Mat 27.29. Mat. 10.17^ 2 Kings 1.13.
Veneration or civil reverence, when it is attributed to men, as to Kings,
Magistrates, Masters, Parents and others, whom we usually reverence with bowing
the knee. Thirdly, For See Ambr^se, Haymo, and others in Ephesians. 3.14, 15.
Prayer it self, usually made to God, with 2 Chronicles. 6, 13. 1 Kings 8.54. D^n.
6.10. Lu ^2 41. Acts 7.60. c. 9.40. c. 20 36. c. 21.5 Ez^. 9.5.
bended knees, as Ephesians. 3.14, 15. Fourthly, for Subjection only; which is
commonly expressed among men by the outward gesture of bowing the knee. Thus it
is used, Esaias 45.23. Rom: 14 11. and in this text of the Philippians, as all
Expositors old and new acco^d, who thus interpret these words: That, In the
name of Jesus every knee should bow, that is, That all creatures, in heaven,
earth and hell should submit and subject themselves to Christ Jesus as to their
Sovereign Lord, King, Judge: good men and Angels willingly; Devils and wicked
men, even Genesis 3.15. Mar. 2.27. Lu. 19.14.27. 2 These. 1.8. Act^ 7.39. Romans
2.8. 1 Pet. 4.17. Psalm 110.1, 2.3. Ier. 3.13.23.
against their wills: And that this is the true meaning of the words, will
appear, 1. By these texts Psalm. 8.6, 7, 8. Psalm. 103.19. Psalm. 110.1, 2. 1 Cor.
15.24, 25. Ephesians. 1.20, 21, 22. (a most full text) Romans 14.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Acts
2.33, 34 35, 36. Heb. 1.8, 9, 13. Revel. 5.8.12, 13, 14. Secondly, because this
bowing of the knee is attributed to Angels in heaven and Devils in hell, which
have no knees to bow as men have; therefore it cannot be construed of any
literal bowing Lord as well as men. 3ly, Because if this should be taken
literally, most the bowing of every knee, their putting often their hats, caps,
inclining their heads or bodies, or bowing only of one of their knees, could be
no fulfilling of this literal bowing of every knee in the text, in their
meaning, unless they can prove their heads, hats, caps, or upper parts of
their bodies, to be their knees, or one leg, knee to be Both, or every of their
knees: Their practice therefore of capping at the name Jesus, of inclining
their heads and upper parts without bowing their knees, to testify (as they
say) their subjection to Christ, is a plain confession, that this bowing in the
text is nothing else, but the subjection of all creatures to him, as their
LORD. Hence therefore I argue thus.

If the bowing of every knee in the name of Jesus be nothing else but the joint
subjection of all Angels, Men and Devils to Christ, as to their Supreme Lord,
not any actual bowing of the knee when his name Jesus only is mentioned in the
Church; then this text neither commands nor warrants any bowing of the knee,
head, or body, (much less any stirring of the hat, or vailing of the bonnet)
at the naming of Jesus in the Church.

But the bowing of every knee in the name of Jesus mentioned in this text, is
nothing else, but Flectitur ei omne genu, dum omnis creatura subjicitur ei.
Flectere sane genu non est carnaliter accipiendum, etc. Nam quae genua in
Spiritibus esse creduntur? Sed genu flectere Subjecta esse ^ucta and cultui Dei

Ch^ysostom, Primasius, Sedulius, Remigius, Beda, Rabanus Mau^us, Haymo.
Theophylact, Oecumenius, Anselmus in Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. Romans 14. and Cyrillus
Alexandrinus lib* 4 in Isay c. 45. Oration 3.
the joint Subjection of all Angels, Men and Devils to Christ, as to their
Supreme Lord, (as all acknowledge not any actual bending of the knee, when his
name Jesus is mentioned in the Church.

Therefore, this text neither commands nor warrants any bowing of the knee,
head or body, much less any stirring of the hat, or vailing the bonnet, at the
name of Jesus in the Church.

Proc^ed we next to enquire, 3. Quaere.
What is meant by things in heaven, things in earth, and things under the
earth? All Expo^itors accord, that by things in heaven; is meant all the
blessed Angels and Saints reigning with Christ in heaven* By things on ear^h,
all creature^ upon earth, especially m^n and women, whether good or bad. By
t^ings under the earth, Devil^ and damned soul^ in hell; and if we believe some
Popish Authors, the souls likewis^ in Purgatory: which Purgatory, I doubt, will
prove either no See Peter M^ulins Water^ of Siloe. Bp Usher of Limbus ^atru^.
place at all, or hell it self, because it is under the earth, as hell (they
say) is, and in the very confines of hell, by their own confession; and in many
of their antientest Horae beata Mariae, secundum usum Rhoan.
Hours, Missals, Histories* expressly styled He^^, ab inferno libera nos Domine,
etc. Well then, this being the meaning, and these the bowers in the name of
Jesus, I would gladly learn from any Patrons of thi^ Ceremony, with what
shadow of reason they can affirm* that by bowing of every knee in the name of
Jesus in thi^ text, is meant, the bowing of the knee, head, or body at every
mentioning of the name Jesus in time of Divine service? Is there, I pray, any
Divine service, Chapter, Gospel, Liturgy, Collect, Homily, Sermon read,
chanted, preached, or any religious mention of the name of Jesus in hell, among
Devil^ and damned Spirits? yet their knee^ are enjoined and ough^ to bow, in
the name of Jesus, at well as Saints and Angels in heaven or men in earth.
Certain (I dare say) it is, there is no Divine Service, Prayer, Reading of
Gospels, Collects, Homilies, Preaching, or sacred mention of the name of Jesus,
in hell, but only by way of cursing or execration; Yea, as certain it is, that
Christ's salvation, redemption extend not at all to Angels, much less to
Devils: as Hebr. 2.14* 16, 17. 2 Pe^. 2.4. Iud. 6. Mat. 25* 41. resolve; nor
ye^ to the damned in hell; yet his Sovereign Lordship and Power do. The Devils
and damned Souls do not* cannot bow to Christ as to their Jesus or Savior, yes
they both do and must of necessity bow and submit to his Royal Scepter,
Sovereignty, Power, as their Luke 10.17. Lord even the Devils are subject to us
through thy name.
LORD. The bowing therefore of the Knee at the naming of Jesus, especially in
time of Divine service, being not to be found or imagined amongst Devils or
Reprobates in Hell, cannot possibly be intended the bowing in the name of Jesus
mentioned in this Text, which extends to those in Hell it self, but only this
bowing of Subjection, which they Mat 10.1. Mar. 5.10, 11, 12. c. 6.7. Lu. 4.35,
36. c. 10.17, 20.
yield unto him as their LORD.

Again, every knee of things in earth, is to bow in the name of Jesus; If we
take this generally for all Creatures upon earth, animate, or inanimate, many
of them want Knees to bow, yea Ears to hear; most of them understanding to
apprehend the name of Jesus, or distinguish this name of his from others, or to
be instructed in this duty of bowing the Knee, when ever they hear the Lord
Jesus named. If we understand this generally of all men on earth, Alas^, the
greatest part of men in the world, since the Creation till this present,
neither knew the Person, Gospel, nor ever heard of the name of Jesus; they
never had, nor shall have here on earth any Divine service, reading or
preaching of the Gospel, Collects, Homilies, wherein the name Jesus was or
shall be mentione^; how then can they observe or perform this duty of bowing at
the recital of the name of Jesus, in time of Divine Service, Sacraments, or
elsewhere? yet notwithstanding every of their Knees shall and must bow in the
name of Jesus; they Psalm. 2. and 96. and 28. and 110. Heb. 1. and 2. Col. 1.15,
16, 17, 18. Ephesians. 1.20.21, 22.
being all now actually put in subjection under his feet as their LORD, his
Kingdom rules over them all, his Scepter now swayeth them though they know it
not, and will not voluntarily submit thereto, and he shall judge them all at
last. This bowing therefore must be a bowing of Subjection, which every knee of
things in earth does, may, shall and must yield to Christ's Divine Sovereign
Power, Dominion, Lordship, not any bowing or capping at the recital of his name
Jesus, in which, at which, to which they neither do, nor yet actually can,
shall or will bow their Knee^; I am certain, not in time of Divine Service, or
Sermons, which they want.

Finally, this bowing of the Knee in the name of Jesus, is attributed to things
in Heaven, which have no real co^poral knees to bow, nor the name of Jesus to
bow at, but Jesus himself their Sovereign Lord and King immediately to
contemplate and adore, to whom they with all ch^arfulness subject themselves,
both as to their Redeemer and Sovereign Lord too; Witness Rev. 5.11, 12, 13,
14. forecited. Yet who can prove or dare affirm, that these actually bow their
Knees at every naming of his name Jesus? This bowing therefore being applied to
every knee of things in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, both severally and
jointly, and yet neither of them actually performing this Ceremonious bowing of
the Knee at the name of Jesus, either jointly or separately in the Church, in
time of Divine Service, Sermons or Sacraments, though all of them jointly or
severally do, will, shall, must subject themselves to Christ, as their Supreme
Lord, either with or against their wills; This bowing in the Text must
necessarily be acknowledged, to be only a bowing of Subjection, which all
Creatures both for the present do, and chi^fly at the day of judgment shall
yield to Christ as their Lord, and Judge both of quick and dead; No^ a bare
bowing at every recital of his name Jesus, which none in heaven, none in hell,
yea very few on earth (and most of those either out of ignorance, mistake,
superstition, or blind devotion) yield unto him. From hence therefore I thus
dispute,

That bowing of the knee in the name of Jesus which every knee of things in
Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, does not, cannot, shall not either jointly,
severally, or actually use; cannot be the bowing mentioned or intended in this
text.

But the bowing of the knee at the sound of the name of Jesus, (especially in
time of Divine service, to which the Patriots thereof principally restrain it)
is such a bowing, which every knee of things in Heaven, Earth, and under the
Earth, does not, cannot, shall not actually use, either jointly or severally.

The^e^ore it cannot be the bowing intended (nor yet a duty, ceremony
prescribed or warranted) by thi^ text, b^t the bowing of subjection only.

4. Q^aere.
I now proceed to the last thing to be inquired of, to wit, When and wh^re this
bowing shall be? Certainly it shall be, not now or here in the Church, but
hereafter before the Tribunal of Christ, when he shall come to judge both quick
and dead. To make this apparent, we must consider that this text (as all
generally expound it, and In h^s ^ust^^ication of ^^wing at the n^me ^f Jesus.
^ 2.3.4, etc.
Mr. Page himself acknowledges in direct terms) is not a precept, enjoining
any actual bowi^g of the knee to us for the present, but only a prophecy or
prediction of a universal bowing of every knee of things in Heaven, Earth, and
under the Earth, especially at the great day of Judgment, when they shall 2
Co^. 5.8.10.11.
all appear before Christ's judgment seat. This is clear by Isaiah 45.23. of
which this text is but a rehearsal. I have sworn by my self, the word i^ gone
out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return; That unto me (not at,
or to my name Jesus) every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. This text
of Isaiah is a direct prophecy of a bowing of every knee, and a confession of
every tongue that should be hereafter made to the very person of Christ, to
which this of Philippians relates, as our own Bibles, with all Expositors ( who
refer these texts one to another, as parallels) accord. But, (then) when or
where shall this prophecy de futuro, be fulfilled? St. Paul, and the spirit of
God, by him resolve this doubt expressly, That it shall be in the general day of
Judgment, when we shall all stand before Christ's Tri^unal. Romans 14 9, 10, 11,
12. For to this end Christ both died^ and rose and revived, that he might be
LORD both of the dead and living. But why do thou judg^ thy Brother? or why
do thou set at naught thy Brother? we shall all stand before the Judgment
seat of Christ. (But some might demand, by what Scripture prove you this? why,
by this very prophecy of Isaiah says he; For it is written, Isaiah 45.23^
As I live says the LORD, (not Jesus) every knee shall bow to me, and every
tongue shall confess to God; So (then) every one of us must give an account of
himself to God. The Apostle therefore referring this text, this bowing to the
very day of Judgment, for the time; to Christ's own Person, before his
Tribunal, for the place; and reciting this prophecy as an infallible Argument
and Prediction to prove, that we shall all hereafter appear before the
Judgment seat of Christ; it is an undeniable evidence, that this bowing of
every knee, and confession of every tongue, of things in Heaven Earth, and
under the ^arth, in the Philippians, referring to this prophecy of Isaiah, by
Paul's own resolution, is principally, if not only meant of a bowing of
Subjection to christ himself as their Lord and Judge, before his Tribunal at
the general judgment, not of any bowing or capping at the recital of his name
Jesus, now or here in the Church. To make this yet more per^picuou^, consider I
pray you, that both in Isaiah 45.23. Romans 14.11. and Phil. 2.10, 11. The bowing
of every kn^e, and conf^ssion of every tongue, ^re coupled together as joint
con^emporary concurrent Acts; So that every knee of things in Heaven, Earth,
and under the Earth, shall bow in the name of Jesus, at that time when, and in
that place where, every ^ongue shall confess, that Jesus Christ is LORD. But
when and where shall every tongue confess that I^su^ Christ is LORD? Christ
himself ^xpresly resolves it, See Luke 13.35.
Mat. 7.22, 23. that it shall be in the great day of Judgment, before his
Tribunal and Person: and most fully, Mat. 25.31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, etc. that
it shall b^, when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his holy
Angels with him, when he shall sit on the throne of his glory, and all Nations
shall be gathered before him; when he shall sev^re the righte^u^ from ^he
wicked, the sheep from the goats, se^ting one of them on his right hand, the
other on his left; when he^ shall pronounce, Come ye blessed, etc. to the one,
Go ye cursed to the other.. For the^ all the sheep on his right hand shall
jointly call him LORD, verse. 37. LORD, when saw we thee an hungered; and all the
goats on his left hand shall jointly do the like, verse. 44. LORD, when saw we
thee an hungered; yea all his holy Angels who shall then a^tend him, v. 31. Mat.
16 27. 2 Thessalonians. 1.7. and actually call him their Lord too, by their attendance
on him) shall then no doubt acknowledge and confess him to be the Lord, a^
they did at his Luke 2.10, 11.
Na^vi^y: Unto you this day is born in the City of David, a Savior, which is
Christ the LORD, as is intimated to us Psalm. 103.19.20, 21. and directly
affirmed Act. 1^.17. Heb 1.6, 7, 8. Yea, no doubt the Devils ( whose LORD he
is, Mat. 4.7.10 c. 8.29, 31. c. 10.1. Mark 1.34. Luke 8.2. c. 10.17.20. c.
4.36. being reserved in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day,
Jude 6. 2 Pet. 2.4.) shall then in deed^, if not in word^, confess^ that Jesus
Christ is LORD, as well as the greatest and most d^mned Reprobates. This
therefor being the time when, the place where every t^ngue shall confess that
Jesus Christ is LORD, must certainly be the time, the place, when and where
every knee shall bow in the name of Jesus. Thi^ will ^urther appear by the 2
Cor. 5.8, 9, 10, 11. We are willing rather to be absent in the body, and to be
present wi^h the LORD: wherefore we labor, that whether present or absen^, we
may be accep^ed of him: For we must all appear before the Judgment seat of
Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to
that he has done, whether it be good or evil: Knowing therefore the t^rrour of
the LORD, we persuade men. For the Son of man shall come in the Mat. 19.28.
Mark 13.26, 27. Luke 21.27.
Glory of the Father, (which every tongue shall then con^esse, Phil. 2.11.) and
then shall be rewarded every man according to his works. Mat. 24.30 Then shall
all the Tribes of the Earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in
the Clouds of Heaven, with Majesty and great Glory: And he shall send his
Angels with the great sound of a Trumpet, etc. Watch therefore, for ye know not
what hour your Lord both come, etc. Blessed is that Servant whom his Lord when
he comes shall find so doing, etc. The Lord of that Servant shall come in a
^ay when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not ^ware of, and
shall cut him in sunder, etc. there shall be weep^ng and gnashing of teeth. And
Rev. 4.10, 11. chap. 5.11, 12, 13, 14. and chap. 7.9, 10, 11, 12. The 24.
Elders ^all down before him that sat on the Throne, and worship him that
lives for ever and ever, and cast their Crowns before ^he Throne, (here is the
bowing of their knees) saying, Thou art worthy O LORD (not O Jesus) to receive
glory, honor, and power, for thou have created all things, and for thy
pleasure they are and were created; (here is the confession of their tongues in
direct terms, that Jesus Christ is LORD.) And I beheld, and I heard the voice
of many Angels round about the Throne, and the Beasts, and the Elders, and the
number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousand of thousands,
saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power,
and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing;
(here we have all the Angels jointly bowing their knees round about Christ's
Throne of Judgment, and confessing with their tongues* that he was worthy to
receive power, and honor, and strength, the same in effect with that in Phil.
2.11. that Jesus Christ is LORD; now mark what follows.) And every Creature
which is in Heaven, (here are things in Heaven) and on the Ear^^, (here are
things on Earth) and under the Earth, (and here are things under the Earth,
agreeing verbatim with this of Phil. 2.) and all that are in them heard I
saying; Blessing, honor, glory, and power be unto him that s^tteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever; (here is the confession of every
tongue, that Jesus Christ is LORD) and the 4. Beasts said Amen. And the 24.
Elders fell down and worshipped him that lives for ever and ever: (here is the
bowing of the knee, both of them before the Tribunal of Christ, at the last
day) After this I beheld, and l^e a great multitude, which no man could number,
of all Nations, Kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and
before the Lamb, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands, and
cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation ^o our God, which sits upon the
Throne, and unto the Lamb: (here we have all tongue^ confessing that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to and in the glory of God the Father) And All ^he Angels stood
round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and about the 4. Beasts, and fell
before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen; blessing,
and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be
unto our God for ever and ever, Amen. Add her^unto Rev. 20.12, 13. And I saw
the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the Books we^e opened, and the
dead were judged out of those things which were written in the Books, according
to their works. And the Sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and
Hell, (or the Grave) d^livered up the dead which were in them, and they were
judged every man according to their work^; And death and Hell were cast into
the lake of fire. Here are both the bowing of every knee, and confession of
every tongue of things in Heaven, things in Earth, and things under the Earth,
of all Men and Angels jointly together, before Christ^ Throne, as to their God,
Lord, and Sovereign Judge: This bowing therefore of every knee, this confession
of every tongu^ ^t the last d^y before Christ's Tribunal, must needs be the
bowing of every knee in the name of Jesus, the confes^ion of every tongue that
Jesus Christ is Lord, in the glory of GOD the father, prophesied of, and
intended in the Philippians, and Isa. 45.23. And in truth, when or where should
this bowing of every knee, and con^ession of every tongue be else, b^t in that
great day of Judgment? when all things in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth,
all Men and Angels, good and bad, shall be jointly summoned before the
Sovereign Tribunal of Christ* their Lord and Judge, to be judged and sentenced
by him. For it being both a joint and universal bowing of every knee of things
in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, and an unanimou^ general conf^ssion of
all tongue^, it cannot possibly be actually verified or performed, but when all
of them shall be gathered together into one place, and shall personally st^nd
before Christ^ Tribunal, where they shall all both hear, see, know and
acknowledge him to be their Lord, and thereupon actually bow unto him, as to
their Sovereign Judge and Lord; which the greatest part of men in all ages,
being Infidel^, Pagan^, who never knew nor heard of Christ on Earth, cannot
pos^ibly perform till that day shall come. Wherefore this text, or prophecy,
cannot be actually verified of them before the day of Judgment, and Christ's
coming to it. The time then of this bowing of every knee of things in Heaven,
Earth, and under the Earth, in the name of Jesus, and the confession of all
tongues, being only the day of Judgment, not the time of this present life, or
of Divine Service, or Sermons; and the place, before Christ's Tribun^l, Throne,
not the Church; and this bowing (then) not to his name Jesus, but his Person, (
every knee shall bow to Isaiah 45.2^.
Me) as he is supreme Lord, God, Judge both of quick and dead, I shall thence
deduce this unanswerable Argument, to prove this Ceremony no duty of the text.

If the bowing of every knee in the name of Jesus, mentioned and intended in
this text, be only a joint bowing or prostratio^ of all things in Heaven,
Earth, and under the Earth, in the great day of Judgment, not in time of
Divine Service or Sermon, or in this present life, and that before Christ's
Tribunal only, not in the Church; Then this text can be no precept, warrant, or
color at all for any bowing at every naming of Jesus in the Church, neither
can it be deduced from or justified by it.

But the bowing of every knee in the name of Jesus* mentioned and intended in
this text, is only a bowing or prostration at the great and gener^l day of
Judgment, not in time of Divine Service or Sermon, or in this present life,
and that before Christ's Tribunal only, not in the Church, as all the premised
Scripture-evidences, and Orthodox Expositors acknowledge.

Therefore this text can be no precept, warrant, or color at all for any
bowing at the naming of Jesus in the Church, neither can it be deduced from or
justified by this text.

Having thus run over these 4 particulars, we may from them collect the true
sense and meaning of this text of the Philippians, which being but a prophecy,
not a precept, can infer no present duty: The true genuine sense of it in few
words is this. The true and full sense of Phil. 2.9, 10, 11.
That God has highly exalted his Son Christ Jesus, since his Passion and
Humiliation; that is, he has set him at his own right hand in Heaven, even in
his Humane nature; and given him a name above every name; that is, has made
him King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and exalted him above all powers,
creatures whatsoever, made him the Sovereign Lord and Judge both of quick and
dead, given him power over all flesh, yea all power both in Heaven and Earth,
and put all things in subjection under his feet; that in the name of Jesus
every knee should bow etc. that is, to this very end and purpose, that all
creatures both in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, all Angels and Men,
whether good or bad, whether in Earth, Heaven, or Hell, should by reason,
virtue, means, and in consideration of this his supreme power and advancement,
submit and subject themselves to him (especially at the day of Judgment when
they shall all appear before his Tribunal) as to their Sovereign Lord, and
supreme Judge, and conf^sse him with their tongues to be their Lord, to (or in,
as many of the Fathers read it) the glory of God the Father.

This then being the true genuine bowin^ of subjection in the text, as is
evident by the premises, and that ^ignant text of 1 Pet. 3.31, 32. By the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, who is gone into Heaven, and is at
the right hand of God, Angels, Authorities, and Powers being made subject unto
him; compared with Col. 1.15. to 21. Heb. 13.4, 5. c. 2.5, 7* 8, 9. Ps. 110.1.
1 Cor. 15.20, to 29. and this which I have insisted on, the undoubted meaning
of this text, the sole argument that can be thence deduced to justify the
bowing at every naming of Jesus, is but this:

All creatures in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, ^^all jointly in the
general day of Judgment, submit themselves to Jesus Christ, as to their
Sovereign Lord and Judge, and bow their knees unto his person before his
Tribunal.

Therefore all Christian men and women must (now) bow their knees, heads, or
veil their hats, whenever they hear his name Jesus mentioned, during Service
or Sermons in the Church on Earth.

A gross ridiculous non sequitur, needing no other answer but derision; Seeing
Calvin, Marlo^e^, Bp. Alley, Piscator, Olevian, on Phil. 2 9, 10.
Mr. Calvin, M^rloret, Bishop Alley, Olevian and Piscator, affirm, That the
Sorbon Sophisters are more than ridiculous, who co^lect from this place, that
as often as we hear the name Jesus mentioned, we are to bow the knee, as if it
were a magic word, which had all its efficacy included in the sound. Hence Bp.
B^bington, Dr. Fulk, Mr. Cartwright, Dr. Willet. in the ensuing places
Bishop Babington, Dr. Fulk, Mr. Cartwright, and Dr. Willet, resolve, that this
bowing at the name of Jesus, is not commanded in, nor warranted by this text,
the name therein ^xpressed being not the name Jesus, the bowing not literal,
the time of it the day of Judgment, and the place wh^re it shall be, before
Christ's Tribunal, as most Expositors jointly accord: Hence our Learned Dr.
Whitaker
Dr. Whitaker, in his Preface to his Answer to Saunders his Demonstration
concerning Antichrist, mustring up diverse absurd consequences of the Papists
and Jesuits, from sundry texts of Sc^ipture; as, Christ entered into Peter's
Ship; therefore the whole Church is Peter's, to wit, the Popes Ship. Barnabas
laid down the price of the Field he sold, at the Apostles feet; therefore the
Popes feet ar^ to be kissed: with many such like consequences; concludes with
this, as the grossest of all the rest, A name above every name is given to
Christ, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow; Therefore as often as we
bear the name of Jesus mentioned, we must uncover our heads, and bow our knees.
After which he thus proceeds. When, I say, men shall hear these and infinite
such like Expositions and Argumentations of these new Masters, if there be any
sense left in them, not only of the Holy Ghost, but likewise of Common
judgment, they cannot think that a Religion grounded upon ^^se foundations can
be firm and certain, and to be preferred before all others. If then this Grave
and Learned Doctor, being Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of
Cambridge, has thus br^nded the bowing at the name Jesus, as it is deduced
from this text, for an absurd, ridiculous, Iesuitical non sequit^r, and that
Religion which is built upon such strange consequences, false and unsound; I
wonder much that any of our Lea^ned Prelates, Ministers, and better sort of
people, should be so over-seen, and blinded through cu^tom, usage, and
inconsideration, as thence to deduce and defend the like Popish consequence,
and to press this Ceremony of bowing, with such earnestness, and zeal as now
a days they do, as if all Devotion and Religion consisted in its use; when as
they should ^ather detest the Mountebank cozening tricks, and devices of
Sorbonists and other Popish persons, thus decryed by our own and other Learned
Protestant Writers; then favor those amongst us, who to maintain the credit of
this Ceremony of bowing at the name of Jesus, dare of^er violence to the very
text it self, and our Common Prayer Book, by changing IN, into AT the Name,
etc. which corrupts both the English, words, and sense of the text, as I have
clearly evidenced, of purpose to delude poor simple people, to draw them on to
error, or Popish superstition, and interpreting the name above every name, to
be the name Jesus, in which every knee shall bow, whereas in truth it is the
name LORD, the supreme Power and Dominion of Christ, as our own
Common Prayer Book, in the Thanksgiving after the Communion administered, thus
expounds it, Glory be to God on high, etc. O Lord God, Son of the Father, thou
that sit at the right hand of the Father, have mercy upon us, For thou only
art the Lord, thou only O Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the
glory of God the Father.

Having thus surveyed and cleared the words, and tru^ meaning of this perverted
text, I shall only desire you to observe these 4 things in it.

First, that it is rather a prophecy of a bowing that shall be given to Christ
as Lord at the last day, (as all Orthodox Expositors accord) than a precept
prescribing any such bowing to Christ for the present, as is undeniable, by
comparing it with Isaiah 45.23 Romans 14*9, to 14. Rev. 5.10, to 14. Jude 14.15.
chap. 3.14, 15, 2 These. 1.6, to 11.

Secondly, that the bowing of the knee here mentioned, is not spoken of as a
distinct act of some particular persons only in the Church, and that often
reiterated at every sound of the Name Jesus, but of one joint habitual or
actual universal bowing of every knee of things in Heaven, Earth, and under
the Earth, Isaiah 45.23. Romans 14.9, to 13. Rev. 5.9, to 14.

Thirdly, that this bowing of the knee in the Text, is coupled with the
Conf^ssion of the Tongue, so that when ever the knee thus bows in the Church,
every tongue also ought to confess, at the same time, that Jesus Christ is
Lord, in the glory of God the Father: So that if any will hence necessarily
infer, an actual bowing of every knee in the Church, at every naming of
Jesus, they must likewise every time they bow their knees at or to this name,
confess and cry out aloud with their tongues and voice, That Jesus Christ is
Lord, to, or in, the glory of God the Father: Which, what a confusion,
disturbance, distraction, in men's attentions, devotions, it would breed in the
Church, (as their frequent bowings do now at the name Jesus, above 20. times in
one day, one Chapter, yea In Mat. 2^.2^. Ioh. 11.18, 19. Man. 18.47. Ioh. 1.42.
chapter 6.24. chapter 18.5, 15. chapter 19 9. Luke 19.35. Re^. 19.10. 1 Thessalonians 4 14. the
nam^ Jesus is repeated twice in one ve^^, and John 19.28. t^i^e, and as often
^^wed ^^ and ^^.
twice or thrice in one verses reading sometimes, and that just as the name
Jesus is uttered, before the following words recited, or the sense or person
understood, whence some have bowed to Joshua, Iustus, and Bar-Iesus too, when
Act. 7.45. Heb. 4.9. Col. 4.11. Acts 13.6. have been read, instead of Jesus
Christ the Lord) all men of common sense may conjecture.

Fourthly, that every knee should bow in this text, is not in the active, but
passive tence, whence Miles Coverdale and others translate it, Vt omne genu
flectatur, that in the name of Jesus every knee be bowed, whether they will or
not; Devils, damned souls, and wicked men, being unwilling to submit to Christ,
as their Sovereign Lord, and subjected to him even against their wi^ls, Psalm.
110.5, 6 1 Cor. 15.24, 25. Luke 14.27. Heb. 2.8. Ephesians. 1.22. Therefore this
bowing can be no religious duty or worship. Every of which con^iderations will
sufficiently evidence this bowing at the name of Jesus, to be no duty of the
text.

If all thi^ be not sufficient to satisfy our Bowers at every recital of the
Name Jesus, both concerning the true ^eading and meaning of this text, but that
the wo^ds must still be re^d At the Name etc. This name at which they bow, must
be the Nam^ Jesus only, and this bowing at or to it, a duty enjoined by this
Text, t^ough no Father, nor Orthodox Protestant Writer I have seen ever
esteemed it so before Bishop Andrews. I shall then demand of them, but these
questions.

First, why they bow not at the sight of the Name Jesus when they behold it in
a Bible, Book, Window, Hanging^, Wall, Medal, Pulpit-Cloth, Cross or the like,
as well as at the sound or hearing of it? since this Text confines it not to
the hearing or sound alo^e, and at the Name, may be as aptly interpreted at the
sight, as at the sound of the Name; which is every way as venerable,
comfortable, majestical, sweet, and as worthy cap and knee when we behold the
Characters of it written, printed, painted, carved, engraven, or embroydered,
^s when we hear the sound of it uttered or pronounced, as the Rhemists,
Alphonsus Salmeron, and Cornelius a Lapide two Jesuits, together with Molanus
and Carolus Stengelius a Benedict in Freer conclude, from Phil. 2.10. in their
passages hereafter cited. Let them therefore henceforth learn to bow at the
sight, as well as at the sound of the name Jesus, or else give over their
bowing when they hear it, because they forbear to bow to it when they see it.

Secondly, if bowing at the hearing of the name of Jesus Hostia) as well as in
the Church? when they hear men curse or I have o^served some to pu^ o^f their
hat ^ to it when they have pro^anely sworn by it.
^wear by this sacred name (when the^e is most cause to honor it by bowing to,
or at it, because it is then most dishonored, profaned) as well as when they
hear the Minister read or utter it in Divine service, Homilies or Sermons? Why
bow they not every time they hear it, as well as sometimes only, it being
alike sacred, venerable at all times, in all places, and representing Jesus his
person to our minds a like? This text restraining it (in their sense) no more
to the Church than to any other place, no more to one man's uttring of it, then
another, no more to the sound then sight of it.

Thirdly, if it be a Duty enjoined them by this text,

Fourthly, if it be a duty of the text, that every for the most part do) not
both, (which few but women practice, who mak^ cou^tesies at it) since the text
requires every knee (therefore both their knees) should ^ow, not one on^y.

Nota.
what is it but to pre^erie, honor, adore his bare name Jesus before his
Person, Deity, and God the Father himself, and to advance the very name, sound,
syllables of Jesus, above his Person, to whom they would not have thus so
frequently, lowly, and seriously bowed afresh, had not this name Jesus been
mentioned, though their minds, thoughts were or should be immediately fixed on
God and him, and their knees, bodies bowed down to them in Prayer before? If
this be not superstition, will worship or worse, let their own Consciences and
Reasons who are guilty of this practice judge.

See Section 3: The Appendix of lowing at the name of Jesus, and Lame Giles
Fathers, and P^imitive Ch^istian, for above one thousand years after Christ,
were utterly ignorant of this duty, of which there is no footsteps, no mention
in Antiquity? why Sir Edwin Sands Relation of the Religion of the Eastern
parts: Or, Europae Speculum, 1629. page 10.
Pope John the 20th. or rather the 22th. above one thousand years after Christ,
should be the first that ever set this Ceremony on foot, and that with an
indulgence of 20. years pardon for every enclining of the head (not of the
knee) at the name of Jesus? why no ancient, no modern Commentators on this text
but Papists and Jesuits, before Bp. Andrews, could find out this duty in, and
acquaint us with it, as a thing therein required? Why no See the Palsgraves
Religion.
Protestant Churches in foreign parts, can yet find out, or practice this duty?
Why See here, Sect. 3.
few but Papist^, but Jesuits, have formerly pleaded for it, till this our
present age? Why few but Popes or Popish Councils and Authors have hithe^ to
pressed it? Why there is a special Prayer for the bowers at it, inserted into
the Mass of the name Jesus? for which name the Papists have not only a solemn
double Feast day on the 7th. of August, styled Festum dulcissimi nominis Jesus,
but also a special Mass, called Horae nominis Jesus, The Hours or Mass of the
name Jesus.

Seventhly, if it be a duty of the text, why then have See the Palsgraves
Religion.
Protestant Churches and Writers oppugned it from time to time, as a Popish
Superstition and Innovation, as the Rhemists and Stengelius acknowledge? why
then do On Phil. 1.9.10.
Calvin and Marloret, both in their Commentaries on the text, and On Romans 14.8.
Phil 2.9, 10. Bish^p Alley hi^ Poor man's Library, part 2. fol. 103, 104.
Paraeus, Piscator, with others, declaim thus against the Sorbonists? The
Sorbon Sophisters are more than ridiculous, who collect out of this present
place, that the knee must be bowed as often as the name Jesus is pronounced, as
if it were a magic word or spell, which has all its efficacy included in its
sound: why does our Learned Answer to Will. Raynold^ p. 398, 399.
Dr. Whitaker tax William Raynolds the Rhemist, with his Popish Companions of
Rhemes, for abusing this text of the Philippians, in straining this Ceremony
from it, which he expressly censures, as Superstitious, which (says he) may
breed a more dangerous error than any it can remove, to wit, that Jesus is
better than Christ, which is wicked to imagine? Yea, why do In his display of
the Pop^sh Mass.

as Popish, Superstitious, Idolatrous in the Papists, and making an apparent
di^parity between the Three sacred Persons of the Trinity, which are Coequal,
by giving more honor to the second Person, and his very name Jesus, than to
the first and third, and their most sacred names? or than to the other names of
Jesus, as Emanuell, Savior, Christ, Messiah, Son of God, and the like? whose
Judgments, that you may the better descern in this particular, I shall
verbatim transcribe, reciting both the Papists words and their answers to them,
as I find them printed in their works.

Thomas Cartwright, who brings in the Rhemists writing thus against the
Protestants. Mr Ca^twright in his Learned Confutation of the Rhomish Testament,
on Phil. 2.10. sect. 2.
They, by the like wickedness, charge the faithful people for capping or
kneeing when they hear the name of Jesus, as though they worshipped not our
Lord God therein, but the syllables, or letters, or other material Elements
whereof the word written or spoken consists; and all this by Sophistications
to draw the people from due honor and devotion toward Christ Jesus; which is
Satan's drift by putting scruples into poor simple men's minds about his
Sacraments, his Saints, his Cross, his name, his image and such like, to
abolish all true religion out of the world, and to make them plain Atheists.
But the Church knows Satan's cogitations, and therefore by the Scriptures and
reason, warranteth and teaches all her Children to do reverence whenever
Jesus is named, because Catholics do not honor these things nor count them
holy for their matter, color, sound and syllables, but for respect and
relation they have to our Savior, bringing us to the remembrance and
apprehension of Christ by sight, hearing, or use of the same signs, else why
make we not reverence, at the name of Many do so through ignorance or mistake
Jesus the Son of Syrach, as well as of Jesus Christ. And it is a pittyfull
case to see these profane subtilties of Heretics to take place in religion,
which were ridiculous in all other trade of life. When we hear our Prince or
Sovereign named, we may without these scruples do obeisance, but toward Christ
it must be superstitious; Thus the Rhemists.

To whom Mr. Cartwright thus replies, at the special instance of See the
Preface before his Confutation of the Rhemists translation, Glosses and
A^notations on the New Testament.
Sir Francis Walsingham, and other Lords of Queen Elizabeth's Privy Counsel, and
request of all the heads and Professors in the Univers^ty of Cambridge, with
sundry other eminent English Divines. This dirt which they dash us with is as
well made of them, as thrown by them. For it is false, that we will have no
reverence given to the name of Jesus; We say, that there ought to be no other
honor or reverence given to it, than unto the name of Christ, of Lord, of God.
And further we say, that this suppleness of your knees, in bowing at the name
of Jesus, is nothing but a mask to hide the straitness and numbness of all the
joints of your heart and soul in your submission to the Commandment of Jesus.
For it is well known, that your knees which are Cammel-like in the courtesy
which you give to this name, are joyntlesse and Elephant-like in your obedience
unto his precepts to whom this name appertains. Again, we testify that this
is a will worship, Nota.
not only troublesome unto the assembly by irksom scraping of the pavement and
unseasonable interruption of that which is read or preached, but pernicious
also, in regard of the suspicion that it may move of the inequality of the
Persons in Trinity, whilst a title of the Son being honored with cap and knee,
the other Persons have neither bonnet veiled, nor foot moved to testify any
honor unto them. The vaunt of Scripture for proof of this worship, must needs
avaunt. For, this being the only stay and prop which they can pretend out of
Scripture, makes nothing for it. First, for that the name of and exc^llent
within him; as in diverse places it does likewise Secondly, for that he
understands not by the word knee, the member of the body, whereby they honor
but (by a borrowed sp^ech) the subjection and bending of all creatures unto the
infinite power of Christ: so that the souls d^parted and Angels (which have no
knees) are subject unto this courtesying, as well as men living upon earth. If
therefore the heavenly Spirits can yield this subjection unto Christ without
courtesying at the name of Jesus, it follows that this Exposition of bowing
the knee is far from the meaning Thirdly, for that the kneeling and
courte^ying here spoken of, is performed as well by the wicked and disobedient,
as by the holy and obedient Spirits, it is plain, that all kind of reverence,
being a voluntary and frank worship of Christ after the pr^script of his word,
is without all warrant of this place. This Scripture making nothing ^or them,
their reason, although it were likely, cannot bear it out; And whereas they
would free themselves from superstition in syllables, because they bow not at
the Name of jesus the Son of Sy^ach, as to Jesus the Son of GOD, whilst the
knee j^mping with the very fir^^ utterance of the word Jesus, prev^nteth
^ft^ntimes the pronunciation of the other words, of the Son o^ Syrach. The very
danger therefore of communicating of this worship with others which they would
have prop^r to our Savior Christ might easily have admonished them of the
ins^ffi^iency of this Service. And seeing the name of Jesus in the Son of N^n^
and in the high Pri^st of that nam^, of whom only we are assured that they were
ri^htly thus called, is the same with the name ascribed unto Christ, Note this.
we see not by what reason honor may be withdrawn from the one, which is given
to the other: specially consid^ring they had not this titl^ o^ jesus in their
own right, but in the right of Christ, wh^s^ figures and lively representations
they were. And if others might hold it, yet you which give the same hon^ur to
the Image, which you give unto the Thing it self, cannot be conceived so to
do. What will you answ^r to this^ that as you are in danger of superstion in
the former point, so in this you are charged with profannesse, who neither cap
nor courte^ie at the name of Jesus out of the Church, where the name is the
same, and as w^ll to be honored without as within the Church? Which service
you perform in the Cros^, whereunto you do honor or ^omage, as well when it
stands in the field, as when it is erected in the Church or Chancells. To
your other reason, That, in reverence we uncover our heads at the name of
Princes. We answer, that if it were so, yet the civil honor is not tied to
suc^ strict laws as is the Divine, therefore there is greater freedom of
choice in the one than in the other. And it is known what is said of Civil
honor; that it rather stands on the will and judgment of the giver, then of
the taker, which is clean contrary in the honor of God, which depends on the
pleasure and command^ment of him that takes it, not of him that giv^th it^
Thus far Mr. Cartwright.

Dr. Andrew Willet, an eminent sound English Divine, in an Synopsis Papismi,
L^ndon 1594. the 9th General Controversy, p. 492, 493.
Appendix concerning the name of Jesus, ^elates the opinions both of the
Papists and Protestants concer^ning this Ceremony in these words.

The Papists.
The name of Jesus ought to be worshipped by capping and kneeing thereunto, by
wearing it in their caps and setting it up in solemn places, alleging that of
St. Paul, That at the name of Jesus all things shall bow, Phil. 2.10. Rhem
Annor. Phil 2. Sect. 2. Apoc. 13.17.
Yea, they say that Protestants by abolishing the name and image of Christ, do
make way for Antichrist.

The Protestants.
First, The bowing at the name of Jesus, as it is used in Popery, to bend the
knee at the sound thereof, is not commanded in this place; which shows
^spe^ially the subjection of all Creatures, ( of Turks, Jews, Infidels, yea of
the Devils themselves) to the power and Judgment of Christ. Secondly, have
only taken away the superstitious abuse of the name Jesus. Thirdly, The
kneeling at the name of Jesus, is Supe^stitiously abused in Popery For the
people stoop only at the sound, not understanding what is r^ad, and so make
N^ta.
an Idol of the Letters and Syllables, adoring and worshipping the very Name,
when they hear or see it: And again, In sitting and not vailing at the nam^ of
Christ, Emanuell, God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and bowing only
at the name of Falk, ibidem

bind any of necessity to use this reverence to the nam^ of Jesus, as the
Papists do, who think that Christ cannot be othe^wise honored; neither do we
judge and condemn those that do use it, being free from Superstition, and
grounded in knowledge, and careful not to give offense; for superstitious and
offensive ignorance is not in any case to be Fifthly, This outward reverence to
the name of Jesus, was A mistake w^rranted by no History, Father, Comme^tator,
or solid Author, invented by Mr Ho^ker, in h^s Ecclesiastical Policy* ^. 2 sent

first taken up amongst Christians, because of all other names it was most
derided and scorned of the Pagans and Jews, and therefore they did the more
honor it: But now there is greater danger of Popish Superstition in abusing
Holy things, then of profane Paganism in utterly contemning them: and therefore
there is not such necessary and just occasion of using this ex^e^nal gesture
now, as was in former times; It was not used of necessity then, much less now.

Suri^s Tom. 4 page 869.
Synodus M^guntina, c. 59 ( An. 1549. not An. 813. as is commonly mistaken,
this Ceremony not being so ancient by 200. years) it was thus decreed. Pari
Religione ad nomen Salvatoris nostri Domini Jesus Christi, similiter ad
Evangelium, Magnificat, Benedictus, Nunc demittis, Gloria in excelsis, Gloria
Patri, caeterasque id genus Divinorum Officiorum parts, si^ genuum fl^ctione,
apertione capitis, ac totius corporis gestu se componant, ut ad ea quae ibi
aguntur, animam intendere videantur: Let men with like Devotion at the name of
our Lord and Savi^ur Jesus Christ, as likewise at the Gospel, the Magnific^t,
Benedictus, Nunc dimittis, Gloria in ^x^elsi^, Gloria Patri, and other parts of
the Di^ine s^rvice, s^ com^ose themselves by bowing the knee, uncovering the
head, and the like gesture of the whole body, as they may seem to have their
mind occupied in those things that are done.

I note out of this Decree, three things: First, That Secondly, That the like
Reverence should be Gloria Patri. Thirdly, That this gesture should not be done
in Reverence Thus then we see, that this Superstitious custom in bowing to the
name of Jesus only, is contrary even to their own Popish Canons and Decrees.
The like things also was decreed, Anno 1548. Surius Tom. 4. page 810.
Synodus Augustensis, c. 23.

Thus far Dr. Willet, who recites almost verbatim Dr. F^lks word^, and opinion
of this Ceremony, in his Answer to the Rhemists Notes on Phil. 2.10. who there
expressly defines; It is certain, that the bowing of the knee at the sound of
the name of Jesus, as it is used in Popery, is not commanded nor prohibited in
this place, (of Phil. 2.9.10) But it pertains to the subjection of all
Creatures to the Judgment of Christ, in the general day of Judgment, when not
only Turks and Jews, who could yield no honor to Jesus, but even the Devils
themselves shall be constrained to acknowledge that he is their judge.

Learned Dr. William Whitaker, Dr. Whitaker.
Regius Professor of Divinity in Cambridge, in his Answer to William Reynolds
the Rhemist, Cambridge 1590. p. 398, 399. writes thus of this Text and
Ceremony: Concer^ing putting off our Caps, and making courtesies at the name of
jesus, Mr. Reynolds is very earnest, and concludes in the end, that I am an
Atheist, and make no account of Christ, for denying, seeing we yield this
honor of cap and courtesies to the Letters, Name, Seal, and Seat of the
Prince. If this be a true Argument, (Mr. Reynolds) as you in your vehemence
would have it seem, how comes it to pass, that Gods name among you is not
honored with like reverence of cap and knee, whenever it is heard? Will you
put off your caps when the Prince is named, and will you make courtesi^s at the Sea Fox Acts and Monuments V^l 3. p. 487, 496.
Popes name, at his triple Crown, or Cross, and will you never once stir your
caps, or bow your knees when God is named? Is this your Religion? is this your
Fashion? Then let me conclude against you, as you have done against me, That
you are by your own Arguments very Atheists, such as make no account of God
himself; for oth^rwise, this conclusion of your (That I am such a one for not
honoring the name of Jesus in such sort) is falsely, though most maliciously
devised. The Jews and Infidels have abhorred the name of Jesus, I grant, But no
more the name of Jesus, than the name of Christ, seeing Jesus is Christ, and
Christ has as much deserved to be hated of them, as Jesus: Christ's name may a
thousand times be heard amongst you, and no man moves cap or knee. Jesus is no
sooner sounded, but every man by and b^ puts off his cap, and scrapeth on
the ground with his foot: and yet not always, or in all places, but in the
Church, and specially at reading of the Gospel. This may breed a more dangerous
opinion tha^ any it can r^move, that Jesus is better then is Christ, and more
worthy of Reverence, which is wicked to imagine.

Bp. Babington.
Reverend and pious Dr. Gervase Babington, Bishop of Worcester, in his
Exposition of the Catholic Faith, in his Works, London, 1622. page 195, 196,
197. determines thus of this Text and Ceremony: The Papists (w^ites he)
strangely des^ant of this holy name Jesus, but whether such stuff be worth the
touch, I refer it to you. Surely to rake up this Channel, were to stir up a
great deal of ^oul matter; For (in truth) the follies of their Writers herein
a^e most monstrous. But said I follies? I might say more, and say but right.

Yet a little to manifest their blindness, you must understand (say they) that
there ^re 3. manner of Psalters. The first is called David's Psalter, containing
thrice fifty Psalms. The second is called the Psalter of our Lady, containing
thrice fifty Aves. And the third is called the Psalter of Jesus, containing
fifteen principal Petitions, which t^n times repeated makes also thrice fifty;
in the which Psalter the glorious name of Jesus is called upon And as often
bowed unto by the Repeaters.
450. times. These ten Petitions may be said upon our ten Fingers, or ten
Beads, or read in a Book. For example, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus mercy; Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
mercy, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus mercy; and so ten times over, which makes one
Petition. This they say shall be very meritorious, because it is written, John
14^13. Acts 4.12.
Whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that you shall have, and there is no
other name whereby we can be saved. This is most wonderful blindness and
boldness, thus to abuse unto Superstition this holy Name, and thus to pervert
these holy Scriptures. The Scriptures you see are far from any such sense,
the one promising that whatsoever we ask in his Name, that is, for his sake,
for his merits and passion, not for the word Jesus, the literal word; and the
other teaching, that there is no other Name, that is, no other means or way
whereby we can be saved, not ascribing our Salvation to the word or syllable
Jesus: But hear more. See Carolus Stengellus S. s^nc^i nominis Jesus Cultus, and
Virtutes, cap. 2. p 30. Erasmus his Paraphrase on Phil. 2.^, 10.
Another of their learned Rabbis going about to tell the greatness of this
Name (not of him that has the name, but of the litteral word) says, that all
things are comprehended within these four numbers, one, ten, a hundred, a
thousand, and then, these numbers are in the word Jesus; wherefore he
concludes, that it is a wonderful name, which you see in him was a wonderful
trifling in a serious matter. A third finds that name of God delivered to
Moses, SVM, I am, in this word Jesus; And how? Forsooth, says he, Jesus has
three terminations, when it is declined, Jesus, Jesus, and Iesum: now take the
last letter of every termination, and you have S. V. M. which put together
spell SVM. Then he cries out, O nomen ineffabile! O nomen vere tetragrammaton!
O gaudium Angelorum, laetitiam lustorum, etc. O name that cannot be expressed!
O name truly tetragrammaton! O joy of Angels, and comfort of the Just.
Furthermore, (says he) this name, if you mark it, has three Vowels and two
Consonants, which is a mystery: for the three Vowels I. E. V. signify the
Trinity; and the two Consonants, (or rather one Consonant twice put, to wit S.)
signify the two parts of Christ's humanity, his Boy and his Soul. Therefore We
must Worship this Name above all Names. Which what profound Divinity it is, you
see. Others of them rob Christ of his Divine power, virtue, and might, and
ascribe it to this litteral word of his name, saying, This is the name that
gave the blind sight, the deaf hearing, the lame going, the dumb speech, the
dead lise; and finally, that cast out Devils out of the bodies of men, etc.
Then is told a tale of a Soldier that was taken out of St. Patricks Purgatory,
by this name. And how? Because St. Paul said, Act, 21.13.
He was not only ready to be bound in Jerusalem, but to dye for the name of the
Lord Jesus, (a place, if you mark it, well applied.) Therefore when his Head was
cut off at Rome it gave three leaps, and at every leap said, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

Why St. Paul meant, as I take it, that he was ready to dye for the name of the
Lord Jesus, that is, for his Gospel, truth, profession o^ him, etc. not for the
litteral word Jesus. It is true, but thus blind were and are still these men,
refusing all reformation, and running headlong to their ow^ destruction, whilst
they place the virtue in the name, that they should have ^aught to be in the
Person of Christ, God and Man, not once mentioning in all this, his mercy,
merit, death, bloodshed, love, or such like.

I cannot omit that profound Doctor, whom Erasmus mentions, that noted how
many letters were in the word Jesus, namely five, and then how S. stands in
the midst betwixt two Syllables, to signify, that even so Jesus is the
middle or Mediator betwixt God and Man, with such other good stories more
there; a^ though we had no better means to prove Christ our Mediator, but by
such curiou^, idle, foolish descant as this. But thus left they the Fountains
of God, and dug Cisternes to drink on after their own fanci^s. Le^ us leave
them therefore and their dreams, and still hold that which has been said
before, that this name was given him, not to be abused to Superstition and
Folly, but to tell us, that as his name was, so indeed was he, a true, full,
and perfect Savior of his people from their si^^; not a half Savior, as
Gabriel Biel writes, Principally by Christ, but not Only by Christ.

After which he adds, I think the place to the Philippians (chapter 2.9, 10) not
well understood, has and does deceive them: Indeed they are easily deceived
that will not search for truth, and they are justly given over to strong
delusions that delight in error, and have not a love of the truth; otherwise
the place to the Philippians would not be mistaken. But look we a little at the
same, and mark from whence the Apostle took it, and compare Spiritual things
with Spiritual t^ing^; The place is borrowed from the Prophet Isaiah 45 23*
Isaiah, and therefore by conferrence evident, that the word (Name) signifies
power, glory, honor, and authority above all powers, glories, honors, and
authoritie^; And (bowing the knee) signifies subjection, submission, and
obedience of all Crea^ures to his beck, rule, and government, for what material
knees have things in Heaven, Hell, etc? This knew the ancient Father St.
Origin, and therefore writing upon the 14. to the Romans, (where these words be
again) says, Non est carnaliter hoc accipiendum, quasi Coelesti^, ut Sol,
Luna, Angeli, genua aut linguas habeant, sed genu flectere significat, cuncta
subjecta esse, and cul^ui Dei obedire, These words are not to be taken
carnally, as though things in H^aven, as the Sun, Moon, Angels, etc. had knees,
or tongues: But to bow the knee signifies, that all things should be subject
and obedient to the service of God. This knew St. Hierom also, and therefore
says, Non ad genua corporis^ sed ad subjectionem mentis, and inclinationem
spectat, sicut David dicit, Adhaesit pavimento anima mea. It does not belong to
the knees of the body, but to the subjection and bowing o^ the mind, as David
says, My soul cleaves to the earth or dust, noting his inward humiliation,
not a r^^l and outward matter; For shall we think (says he) that either
Heavenly things, or all Earthly things ^ave knees, etc. No, I say again, but by
thi^ phrase of sp^ech is m^ant subjection, whereof bowing of the kne^ is a
sign; as when he says, 1 Kin. 19.18. R^m. 14.11.
I have left me 7000. men which have not bowed the knee to Baal, that is, which
have no^ been subject to that Idol. Fornicator libidini genu flectit, etc. The
Fornicator is sa^d to bow his knee to lust, The Covetuous man to his riches or
desire, The Proud man to his pride, etc. because they are subject to these
things. Et ^o^ies Diabolo flectimus qusties peccamus, And so often we bow to the
Devil as we commit sin, says thi^ good Father. The like in effect have
Theophilact, Bed^, Ambros^, the gloss, and some of their own Papists. Imperio
ejus subjiciantur Angeli, Homines, Daemones, To his rule and government shall
be subject Angels in Heaven, Men in Earth, and Devils under the Earth. This is
to bow the knee to him, and this is for him to have a name above all names. Let
it suffice both for Answer to the place of the Philippians, and for declaration
of this Popish ignorance and error: Great is the judgment certainly when men
have eyes and s^e not, ears and ye^ ^ear not, hearts and yet understand not,
and God avert it from his people more and more. After which he thus proceeds,
This title of Christ, is given to our Savior, to ^istinguish him from others
that were c^lled Jesus as well as he, who were many^ (the name in these places
and time^ being usual,) as Jesus the Son of Nun, Jesus the Son of Iehozadeck,
Jesus the Son of Syrach, Jesus Iustu^, Col. 4.11. and many more, but none of
all these was Jesus Christ; therefore this addition of Christ, you see, makes a
difference betwixt this our Jesus, and all these; And by the way, ( I^sephus
Heb. 4.7. H^g. 1^1. Ezra 3.2.
I should touch it again) Does not even the common use of the name show, that
the place of the Philippians is not literally to be understood? For how could
that name be a name ab^ve all names, which so many had as well as he, if you
respect the literal name? Therefore need^ by Name, must be meant some other
thing, (as you heard before) even power, authority, rule, and government, which
is in Christ above all others. S^condly, This title shows his Office, for it
signifies Anointed: And this again shows the gross ignorance, or wilful
malice of Papists, in so extolling the ^are word Jesus; For whether is greater^
Henry (a proper name, common to many of his Subjects) or King? ( a name of
Office, peculiar to him) Mary, or Queen? John, or Earl and Lord? As then Henry
and King be, so is Jesus and Christ, therefore judge whether is greater, if we
were to stand upon names and litteral rules. This have some of their own well
seen and confessed, but I had rather allege the Scripture^. First then
consider, at the first tidings brought of his happy Birth unto the Shepherds,
mark how the Angels content not themselves to say, Luke 2.11.
Unto you is born a Jesus, or a Savior, but they add more comfort, which is
Christ the Lord. Note this.
Thereby preferring this Jesus before all that ever were so called, by a title
of his Office: The like we read in Matthew, Mat. 1.16.
Of whom is born Jesus, which is called Christ: In John 7.43.
John we read of a dissension, etc. Not whether he were Jesus or no, but
whether he were Christ, knowing the greater moment to be in that: A^ain, John
9.22.
A L^w was made to excommunicate whosoever confessed him to be Christ, not
against calling him by the name Jesus; In the same place you see the poor man
which had received sight, to fall down and worship when he heard the title of
the Son of God, and not doing it before in that sort, though he knew his name
to be Jesus: In the John 10 33.
10th. of John, they would have stoned him, for s^ying he was the Son of God,
and called it Blasphemy, but they did not so for the name of Jesus: I^ Luke
22.67.
Luke they demanded of him, Art thou the very Christ? not, Act thou Jesus? for
so they called him without offenc^, and when they heard his Answer, they rent
their Clothes, thereby declaring how far greater it was to be Christ, then to
have the literal name of Jesus. All which places, with many more, ought truly
to teach and persuade our souls, to look for his Office, that has his name
which is so comfortable, and not to be Let the Fathers of the Church note it.
Children, playing with Letters and Syllables, and adoring Titles with honor
that is due to the Person, as those fond men do, salving all the matter with a
foolish distinction of concomitancy, by which all Idolatry may be as well
excused. Thus thi^ Learned pious Bishop of our Church, expressly against Bishop
Andrews and others fancies since.

If this Bishop seem singular in this case, I shall add another Prelate to
second him, even that Famous Learned Divine William Alley, Bishop Alley.
Bishop of Exeter, Divinity Lecturer at Paul's, in the first year of Queen
Elizabeth, who in his Poor Man's Library, Tom. 2. Miscelanea Praelectionis, 3,
and 4. London, Cum gra^ia and p^ivilegio Regiae Majestatis, 1571. fol. 42, 43,
88, 103, 104 writes thu^, God the Father gave un^o Cur^^ ^ot only the glory of
his body, but also the glory o^ his name, A^ it is written by Paul, Philippians
2.9, 10. He gave him a name which is above all name^^ that In ( so be And K.
Edw. the 6. his Ca^echisms too, cum privilegio.
twice renders it, not A^) the name of Jesus every knee should bow, both of
thin^s in Heaven, of things in Earth, and of things under ^h^ Earth^ These
words (writes he, answering the Papis^s obj^cting it for proof of their
imaginary Purgatory) are not to be understood of the worshipping of God, ^or
this worship stands not in this, that the kn^e should be bowed, ^ut does
sp^cially require the spiritual effects and motions of the mind: Paul there
speaks of the great Authority and power which is committed and given to
Christ, by which power every creature of Heaven, Earth, and Hell, is made
subject unto him, even the Devil himself, with all the wicked and damned
spirit^, will they nill they, are delivered under his feet; and the words which
go before show this sufficiently, for it is said, God gave him a name that is
above all name^, that all knees should bow In that Name; Which words if ye will
apply unto the Divine Worship, as though they which worship God be in
Purgatory; Then must you grant also, that the Devil and all the damned spirits
do worship Christ; Nomen, name in this place is taken for dignity and honor,
and so it is used almost in all tongues, especially in the Scriptures it is a
familiar speech; Paul therefore by this word Name, signifies high and great
power to be given unto Christ, and Christ to be set in chiefest degree of
honor, that there may no dignity be found like, either in Heaven or in Earth.
It is to be wondered of some which do coactly restrain this sentence of Paul to
the two Syllables of this name Jesus: Paul speaks of the whole Majesty of
Christ; For they which do consider, and have no further respect but only to the
two Syllables of the name, do like as one would discuss and find out by this
word Alexander, the great prowess of the name which Alexander gat him; But I
pray you, And are not many of our Prelates, Ministers, and People now in this
regard as foolish as they?
how much more foolish are the Sorbonists, which gather by this place of Paul,
that the knee is to be bowed as often as this name Jesus is pronounced? As
though this word were a word which has in the very sound all the power
included: But Paul speaks here of the honor which is to be given to the Son
of God, and to his Majesty, and not to the Syllables either sounded or written:
And in this behalf, how much (I pray you) did the pel^ing Pardoners deceive the
people, in selling this name in Golden or Painted Papers, as though they might
obtain either remission of sins, or else the favor of God thereby? Thus much
Bishop Alley.

To him I shall annex that late Learned Reverend Divine, Dr. Air^y.
Lecture 30. upon the Philippians, London 1618. p. 345* to 348.
Dr. Henry Airay, Provost of Queens College in Oxford, who upon this Text of
the Philippians, writes thus, And has given him a name, etc. Where we are not
to unde^stand, that God gave unto Christ after his Resurrection any new name
which he had not before; for as before, so after, and as after, so before, he
was and is called, the wisdom of God, the power of God, the true light of the
world, faithful and true, holy and just, the Apostle and High Priest of our
profession, a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizadech, the Savior of
the world, the Prince of Peace, the Mediator of the New Testament, the head of
the Church, the Lord of Glory, Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, the Son of
God, and God; neither had he any name after his Resurrection which he had not
before; But by a name is to be understood in this place, glory, and honor, and
Majesty, and Dominion over all things created, ( as the same word is elsewhere
used, Ephesians. 1.21.) So that when it is said, God has given him a name above
every name, the meaning is, That God having raised up Christ Jesus from the
dead, has so highly exalted him in the Heavenly places, that he has given him
all power both in Heaven and Earth, all Dominion ov^r all Creatures whatsoever,
and the same glory which he had with him from the beginning, so that now he
reigns and rules with him^ King over all, and bl^ssed for ever, which he
there proves and parallels with Heb. 2.9. Ephesians. 1.20, 21 John 17.5. Mat.
28.18. And then concludes thus. To knit up all in a word, Christ (God and Man)
after his Resurrection, was Crowned with glory and honor, even such as plainly
showed him to be God, there to rule and reign as Sovereign Lord and King, till
he come in the Clouds to judge both quick and dead; After which, he proceeds in
these words, Ibidem ^. 153, 154, 155.
Where by the name of Jesus w^ are not to understand the bare name of Jesus, as
though it had the virtue in it to drive away Devils, or as though at the very
sound of it all were to bow their knees, For at the name of Savior (which is
the same with Jesus) none boweth, and the name of Christ, Emanuell, of the Son
of God, of God, are names no less precious and glorious then is the name of
Jesus; True it is, that bowing at the name of Jesus is a Custom which has
been much used, but to bow and kneel at the very sound of the name, when we
only hear the name of Jesus sounding in our ears, but know not what the name
means, Nota.
savoureth of Superstition. By bowing the knee, the Apostle here means, that
subjection which all Creatures ought continually to perform, and which all
Creatures shall perform to Christ in that day; some, wilingly and cheerfully,
as Holy-m^n and Angels: some, unwilling, and to their confusion, as the Devils,
and wicked men their Instruments; For so the Lord by his Prophet uses the same
phrase of speech, where he says, Isaiah 45.23*
Every knee shall bow to me: That is, shall be subject to me, and worship me.
Here then is a duty prescribed, necessary to be performed of every Christian,
which i^, to glorify him who is exalted into the height of glory, both in our
bodie^ and in our spir^t^, to worship him with holy worship, to subject our
selve^ to him in all obedience un^o hi^ Heavenly will, For Apoc. 5.12*
worthy is the Lamb that was killed to receive all power, and wisdom, and
strengt^, and honor, and praise, and glory; The Angels in Heaven they glorify
the name of Jesus, in that they are always ready to execute his wlll, and do
wha^soever he commands them; This also is that holy worship wherewith we
ought to worship him, and to glorify hi^ name, even to be hearer^ and doer^ of
hi^ word, to obey hi^ will, to walk in his Laws, and to keep his Commandments,
not the bare and outward capping and kneeing at the name of Jesus, but
principally, obedience unto his will that is named, is the h^nour which here he
accepts of us; For, a^ Not ev^ry one that says Lord, Lord, s^all enter into
his Kingdom, so Not every one that boweth at the name of Jesus shall enter into
his Kingdom, but ^e that does his will, and walks in his w^yes: Saul when he
was sent to slay the Amalekites, thought t^ honor God greatly by sparing the
best of the Sheep and of the Oxen, to sacrifice unto him; But it wa^ said unto
him, 1 Samuel 15.22.
Has the Lord as great pleasure in Burnt-^fferings and Sacrifices, as when his
voice is obeyed? Behold, (...) obey i^ better then Sacrifice, and to hearke^ is
b^^ter then the fa^ of Rams: So you happily think, No^a.
You honor our blessed Savior greatly, when yo^ bow your selves at every
sound (...) hi^ name; But behold, to ob^y his will is better then cap^ing and
kneeing, and all ou^ward Cerem^nies whatsoever: Yet mistake me not I beseech
you, as though I thought that the names of Jesus, of Christ, of the Lord, of
God, of the Father, of the Son, or of the Holy Ghost, were names of ordinary
account or reckoning, or to be passed over without reverence, as other name^,
nay when^oever we hear, or speak, or think of them, we are to rever^nce the
Majesty of God, signified thereby; and fearful it may be to them that think or
speak of them profanely or lightly, or upon each light or trifling occasion,
or otherwise then with great reverence and fear, that the Lord may not hold
them guil^^esse: But this I say, that neither the sound of these Syllables of
Nota.
Jesus, nor the name of Jesus, should aff^ct us more then any other names of
Christ, as though there lay some virtue in the bare word; But whenever we
hear, or think, or speak of him, we are to r^verence his Majesty, and in the
reveren^ fear of his name, to subject ^ur selves unto his will. This is a part
of that duty whereby we must glorify Christ Jesus. After this, in the 31.
Lecture he proceeds to prove, That by bowing of the knee in this Text, is meant
the subjection of all creatures unto Christ, and that this Text shall be
actually and ^rincipally fulfilled before his Tribunal only, in the general
day of Judgment; So that by

To these our Learned Orthodox Bishops, and Divines, I could add Mr. William
Charke, in his Answer to a Scandalous Libell or Censure, Mr. Perkins, in his
Discourse of Witchcraft, c. 3. Mr. Thomas Wilson, in his Exposition on Romans 14*
11. p 601. who conclude this bowing at the name of Jesus to be no duty or
Ceremony warranted by Phil 2* 9, 10, 11. and censure the P^pists for adoring
and abusing the name of Jesus to Supe^stition and Idolatry: But I shall
conclude with the words of Johannes Brentius an eminent Protestant Divine,
Explicatio in Epist. Pauli ad Philip. c. 2. v. 9, 10. Quod autem Paulus ait, Vt
in nomine Jesus omne se genu flectat, etc. non sic intelligendum est, quod
necessarium sit ut prolato hoc nomine semper externa g^nua flec^ere debent,
haec est enim Puerilis Ceremonia et propter Pueros usurpanda aliquoties; which
I wish those Reverend Fathers of the Church, who most press and practice it,
a^ becoming their Dignity and Gravity, would seriously consider, lest they
verify the Proverb, Bis Pueri Senes.

Now because Bp. Andrews is the first and principal Divine of Eminency in our
English Church, who has expounded this Text of the Philippians against the
stream of the Fathers, and Protestant Writers of our own and other Refo^med
Churches, and preached up bowing, cringing at every recital of the name Jesus
in the Church, as an indispensible r^ligious duty, prescribed to all Christians
in this Text, when as Ecclesiastical Policy, l. 2 sect. 30. Dr. Fulks Notes on
the Rhemish Testament* Phil. 2. sect. 2.
Mr. Hooker and others repute it only, an arbitrary harml^sse Ceremony, which
no man is constrained to use, and wherein Christian liberty ought to take
place, therefore no duty of the Text: And because his Sermon on it is the
principal Authority which those who now most press, practice this Duty, or
Ceremony of bowing, rely upon, without due Examination of his Words and
Reasons; to undeceive all his seduced Proselytes, I shall in the next place
soberly examine, discover the manifold oversights, errors, mistakes, in his so
much admired Sermon on this Text and subject, being necessitated thereunto for
my own just defense, by some of his Fellow-Bishops, who seem much displeased
for my over-modest brief censure of them in my Lame Giles his Haltings; whom I
hope to convince, or convert to my opinion, by the irresistible evidence of
Truth, and by such sacred and humane Authorities, Reasons, as they shall not be
able to gainsay. If any shall deem me his or their Enemy Gal. 4.16.
because I tell and discover to them the truth; I shall patiently undergo their
undemerited indignations, and silently lament, that Veritas Odium Parit, should
now be experimentally verified in any Fathers of the Church, or Ministers of
the Gospel, who are specially commanded, Zach 8: 16, 17, 19.
To speak every man the Truth to his Neighbor, to execute the judgment of
Truth and Peace in their Gates; to love the Truth and Peace, and not to imagine
evil in their hearts against their Neighbors, especially for discovering or
defending Truth, and refelling Falsehood, in matters which concern men's
Consciences and immortal souls, whose sati^faction and benefit alone I only
intend, by these serious and sober Inqui^ies.

SECTION II.
Whether these Passages in Bishop Andrews his Sermon at Whitehall, on Easter
day 1614* on Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. concerning Bowing at the name of Jesus only, as
a Duty of this Text, and his Reasons to evince it, be Orthodox or Heterodox?

His words and passages in that Sermon are these.

A Name he gave him; What name? not (inter) among the famous men on Earth, but
( super omne nomen) above them all; There is super upon super, another super to
his name, no less^ then his Person: That, above He excepts not the two Persons
of the Trinity, God the Father, and God the Holy Ghost* no more then their
names which if intended and included in his words, they are little less then
Heresy and Blasphemy.
all Persons, and This, above all names whatsoever: This name is named in the
Vers^, and it is the Name of Jesus: But how is this name said to be above all
names? What, above the name of God? We may say with the Apostle, when he says,
God did give it him, it is manifest, he is accepted that did give it him: But
we need not so say; For, this is one of Gods own Names; I am (says he) and
besides me there is no Savior; How is it then given him? Accepit et ^omo quod
quod habebat ut Deus: What as God he had, as man he received, with his nature
his name, and the chief of all his names, the Name of a Savior, for above all
it is, above all to him, above all to us, etc.

To save, the highest Law, and the Name of a Savior the highest Name, etc.

For the knee, two things. First, He would have it bow. Secondly, He would have
it bow TO his Name; To bow the knee, and TO his name to bow it, this is another
Prerog^ative: He is exalted to whose person knees do bow, But he to whose Note
this.
Name only, much more: but the case is here otherwise, For his Person is taken
out of our sight, all we can do will not Psalm. 16.2.
reach unto it; But his Name he has left behind to us* that we may show by our
reverence and respect TO IT, how much we esteem him, how true the Psalm shall
be, Psalm. 111.9.
Holy and Reverend is his Name.

But if we have much a do to get it bow at all, Much more shall we have to get
it done TO HIS NAME. 1. There be that do it not: What speak I of not doing it?
There be that not only forbear to do it themselves, but put themselves to an
evil Occupation, to find fault where none is, and cast scruples into men's
minds, by no means to do it. Not to do it AT his name? Nay, at the Holy
mysteries themselves not to do it, etc. But to keep us to the name; This is
sure, the words themselves are so plain, as Ambros. Hexam l 6. c. 9. Hierom C^m
In Isai. 45. Cyrill. Alex. in Hesaiam l 4. c. 45 Orat 3.
Ancient) on this place, that I can find (save he that turns all into
Alegories) but literally understands it, and likes well enough we should
actually perform it. Yet will ye see what subtilties are taken up to shift this
duty?

All knees are called for, and all have not knees: Here are three ranks
reckoned, and two of them have none. What is that to us? we have, to us it is
properly spoken, and we to look to it; And if this were ought, that the Spirits
in Heaven and Hell have no bodies, and so no knees: Why, they have no tongues
neither properly, and then by the same Rule take away confessing to, and so do
neither. But the Apostle, that in another place gives the Angels tongues, ( 1
Cor. 13.^.
with the tongue of Men and Angels) might as well in this place give them
knees, they have one as much as the other; And in both places, R^m. 6.19.
Humanum dicit, he speaks to us after the manner of men, that we by our own
language might conceive what they do; For sure it is, the spirits of both
kinds, as they do yield reverence, so they have their ways and means to
express it, by somewhat (...) to the knee. They do it their way, we do it
ours, and this is ours: Let us look to our own then, and not bu^ie our brains
about theirs; but for us and our sakes, they are diverse times expressed in the
Rev 4.10^ c. 5.8.14. c. 7.11.
Revelation even doing thus, falling down before him.

Secondly, 2ly.
Why TO HIS NAME more then to the name of Christ? There want not reasons why:
1^ Christ is not, cannot be the name of God, God cannot be 2. The name of
Christ namely to Princes; so is not Jesus, that is proper, Isay 43^ 11.
Ego sum, and preter me non est alius; and ever that which is proper, is above
that which is holden in common. 3. Christ is anointed, To what end? our
Savior; that is the end then, and ever the end is above the means; ever the
name of health, above the name of any Medicine. 4. But when we find expressly in
this name is exalted above all names, and this act limited TO it in direct
words, and so this name above them in this very particular, why seek we any
further?

Thirdly, 3ly.
What? to the two syllables? or to the sound of them? What needs this? Who
speaks of sound or syllables? The Text says, Do it TO the name; the name is
not the sound, but the sense: The caution is ea^ie then, Nota.
Do it TO the sense, have mind on him that is named, and do his name the honor
and spare not.

Fourthly, 4ly.
But it cannot be denied, but there has been Superstition used in it. Suppose
there has, and almost in what not? In hearing of Sermons now is there not
Superstition in a great many? What shall we do then? Lay them down? Abandon
hearing, as we do kneeling? I trow not; But remove the Superstition, and
retain them still; Do but so here and all is at an end. Indeed, if it were a
taken-up worship, or some humane injunction, it might perchance be drawn within
the case of the Mark this.
Brazen Serpent. But being thus directly set down by God himself, in us, there
may be superstition; in it, 2 Kings 18.4.
there can be none; and if it be in us, we are to amend our selves, but not to
stir the Act which is of Gods own prescribing. It was never heard in Divinity,
that Superstition could ever abolish a duty of the T^xt.

That we set our selves to drive away Superstition, it is well, but it is well
too that we so drive it away, as we drive not all reverent regard and decency
away with it also; And are we not well toward it? We have driven it from our
head, for we keep on of all hands; and from our knees, for kneel we may not;
Few then d^d it, and most since do it upon this Sermons inst^gation, and
Bishops reputation.
we use not I am sure. Sure, heed would be taken, that by taking heed we prove
not Superstitious, we slip not into the other extreme before we be aware, which
of the two extremes Religion worse endures, as more opposite unto it: For
believe this, As it may be superstitio^sly used, so it may be irreligiously
neglected also. Look to the Text then, and let no man persuade you, but that
God requires a reverent carriage even of the body it self, and namely, this
service of the knee, and that TO HIS SONS NAME, ye shall not displease him by
it, ^ear not; Fear this rather for the knee, if it will not bow, that it shall
be stricken with somewhat that it shall not be able to bow: And for the Name,
that they that will do no HONOR TO IT, when time of need comes, shall receive
no comfort by it. And so I leave this point.

Thus far this Bishops words, whose great ^ame and estimation for learning,
drew on many other Bishops, Deans, Prebends, Divines, Scholars, and Laymen to
practice and promote this Bowing to or at the Name of Jesus, (formerly disused
for the most part) as a duty of the Text, or a necessary Worship, or decent
Cer^mony grounded thereon, without any due examination of his words, Quotations
or Reasons, which if soberly discussed, rather overthrow than ratify his
Conclusions. I shall therefore briefly survey them in the general, and then
descend to discuss some particulars.

First, Be pleased to take notice of the mis-translation of his Text, At the
name, for In the name of Jesus every knee should bow, against the Original and
all other English Translations extant, but that of Geneva; which corrupts both
the English, sense, and meaning of the text; and renders it as incongruous
English and Nonsense; as to translate these Scriptures, Mat. 18.20.5. c ^4.5.
Mat. 9.33, 41, Lu. 9.48 John 14 13. c. 14 18 c. 15.16 c 16.23.2^, 26.
Where two or three are gathered together IN my name; Receive one such Child IN
my Name; Whatsoever ye shall ask IN my name; many shall come IN my name;
Believe IN my name, etc. Into, where two or three are gathered together At my
^ame; Receive one such At my name; Whatsoever ye shall ask At my name; Many
shall ask At my name; Believe, hope, trust At my name; O^, Tit. 1.13. c* 2.2.
sound IN the Faith, into ^ound AT the Faith, which is neither good English,
Sense, nor Scripture.

2ly. Observe how he no less then ten times, or more changes At his name,
into Ad nomen, To the name of Jesus. He would have u^ bow To the Name; To his
name to bow, etc. are Ten times repeated. Which, as it idolizeth the name Jesus
it self, by giving divine honor and worship To I^, as a duty of this Text; so
it justifies and makes much for the Jesuits and Romanists bowing to and
adoring his name Jesus wherever they behold it written, see Section 3.
carved, painted, as well as hear it pronounced. Yea in some measure it
subverts his pretended new Duty of his Text by this Nonsequitur: Every knee
should bow To the name of Jesus; Ergo, all Christians must bow their Knees To
this Name Jesus, when ever it is pronounced in the Church, and they hear the
sound thereof in reading of a Chapter, Epistle, Gospel, Collect, Prayer,
Sermon, Homily, or administration of the Sacrament.

3ly. Consider his main Scripture cited to prove this bowing At and To this
name Jesus, to thi^ Name only, not his Name God, Lord, Christ, or any other
Name, is Psalm 111.9. Holy and Reverend is his Name. But is this name Jesus,
the Holy and Reverend name, intended in that Text? Nothing less. For first,
this Psalm was compiled many hundred years before our Saviors incarnation, or
his Name Jesus given unto him by the Angel, or imposed on him by his direction
at his circumcision, Mat. 1.21, 25. Lu. 1.31. c. 2.21. What name was it then,
which is so holy and reverend? the very Psalm it self resolves in direct terms,
it was no other but Lord, four times repeated in it, v. 1, 2, 10. Praise the
Lord, I will praise the Lord with my whole heart; etc. The works of the Lord
are great, etc. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; there being
no other Name else used in the whole Psalm, nor in the Psalm next before and
after it, viz. 110. and 112. That this title LORD is this holy and reverend
Name, is further evident by the 1 Chronicles 16.7, to 12. and Ps. 105 1, 2, 3, etc.
In that day David delivered this Psalm to thank the LO^D. O give thanks unto
the Lord, call upon his Name, Glory ye in his holy Name, Let the heart of them
r^joyce that seek the Lord, Seek the Lord and his strength Seek his face
evermore, etc. Ps. 103.1, 2. Bl^sse the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within
me bless his Holy name. Bless the Lord O my Soul, etc. (Here is his Holy name
above every Name; his Exaltation and Dominion over all Creatu^es thus follows)
v. 19.20, 21: The Lord has prepared his Throne in Heaven, and his Kingdom
rules over all. Bless the Lord ye his Angels that excel in strength, that do
his commandment, harkening to the voice of his word. (Here are things in
Heaven bowing their Knees to him) Bless the Lord all ye his Hosts, ye Ministers
of his that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord all his Works in all places of his
Dominion (in heaven, earth, and under the earth) agreeing with Phil. 2.9, 10,
11. and resolving LORD to be his holy Name above all Names, since every tongue
should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, in or to the glory of God the Father.
Add to this Psalm 142.21. My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord, and let
all Flesh bless his holy Name for ever and ever, Lu. 1.46.49 My Soul does
magnify the Lord, etc. For he that is Mighty has magnified me, and holy is
his Name. Therefore this Name Lord, not Jesus, is the name that is holy and
reverend mentioned in Psalm 111. and the Name above every Name in which every
knee should bow, intended in the Phi^ippians, notwithstanding this Bishops and
other Doctors fancies to the contrary; and the bowing of every kneee, a See
Bishop ^ewels Reply to Harding. Artic. 8. p 379, 405.
bowing of subjection of all Creatures to his Sovereignty, especially in the
day of Judgment, as I have Page 3, to 20.
already evidenced at large. Which I shall further demonstrate by these ensuing
Scriptures, Rev. 1.5, 6, 8, 18. Jesus Christ, the first begoten of the dead,
the Prince of the Kings of the earth, etc. to him be glory and dominion for
ever and ever, Amen. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and ending says the
Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. I am he
that lives and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore Amen; and have the
keys of Hell and Death, Rev. 3.21. To him that overcommeth will I grant to sit
with me in my Throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down in my Fathers
Throne; Rev. 6.10 And they cried with a loud voice, how long O Lord holy and
true, do thou not judge and avenge our Blood, etc. And the Kings of the
earth, and the Great men, and the rich men, and the chief Capt^ins, and the
mighty men, and every bondman and freeman hid themselves in the denns, etc.
and said to the Mountains fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that
sits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. R^v. 11.15, 16, 17. And
there were great voices i^ heaven, saying, The Kingdoms of the World are become
the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and
ever. And the 24. Elders which sat before God o^ their seats fell down on
their faces, and worshipped God, saying, We give the thanks Lord God Almighty,
which art, and wast, and art to come, because thou have taken unto thee thy
great Power, and have reigned. And the Nations were angry, and thy wrath is
come, and the time of the dead that they should be judged, and that thou
should give reward unto thy Servants and Prophets, and to the Saints, and
them that fear thy name, small and great, and should destroy them that
destroy the earth, Rev. 15.3, 4. And they sung the song of Moses, and of the
Lamb, saying, Great and mavelous are thy works, Lord God Almighy, ju^t and
true are thy ways thou King of Saints, etc. Who shall not fear thee O lord and
glorify thy name, for thou only art holy, for all Nations shall come and
worship before thee, for thy Judgments are made manifest, Rev. 16.7, 8, 9. And
I heard the Angel say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and art
to come, etc. And I heard another under the Altar say, Even so, Lord God
Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments, Rev. 18.8, etc. She shall be
burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord God that judges her. Rev. 19.1, 2, 4,
etc. After those things, I heard a great voice of more people in heaven, saying
Allelujah, salvation, and glory, and honor, and power unto the Lord our God;
for true and righteous are thy judgments, for he has judged the great Whore
And the 24. Elders, and the 4. Beast^ fell down and worshipped God that sat^ on
the Throne, saying, Allelujah, etc. And I heard as it were the voice of a great
multitude, and as the Voice of many waters and mighty thundrings, saying,
Allelujah; For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns: Let us be glad, and rejoice,
and give honor to him, etc. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that
with it he should smite the Nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of Iron,
and he treads the winepresse of the wrath of God; and he has on his vesture,
and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, etc. And I
saw the dead, small and great, stand before GOD, and the Books we^e opened,
etc. and they were judged every man according to their works. And then it will
be most clear, That the Names of God, Lord, Lord of Lords etc. not the name
Jesus, (not once mentioned in all these Texts) is the name above every name;
and the bowing, subjection of all Angels, Men, Spirits, great and small, good
and bad before the Throne or Judgment seat of Jesus Christ, and his judging of
them, the bowing of every knee; and their confessions of him to be LORD, and
GOD, in the glory of God the Father: the very same intended in Phil. 2.9, 10,
11. Isay 45.23. and Romans 14

4ly Take notice of these his Hyperbolical expressions, which may prove very
dangerous if not warily unde^stood, and quali^ied with some grains of charity
and candor. Here is super upon super: Another super to his Name, no l^sse then
his Person. That above all persons (not excepti^g the Persons of God the
Father, and God the holy Ghost) And this above all names whatsoever: not
excepting the Names of God, God the Father (...) HOLY SPIRIT, (no more then the
other great and glo^ious names of Christ, Son of God, Lord, etc.) whose Persons
and Names too are Co-aequal with the Person and Name of Jesus; Therefore to be
equally adored, bowed to and honored by all O^thodox Christians: whereas these
his expressions, seconded with constant bowing^ only at and to the Name, Person
of Jesus, not of God the F^ther, or God the Holy Ghost, imply, yea make an
inaequality in the very Trinity it self, and advance the Person, Name of Jesus
the Son, above the Person, N^me of God the Father; and Person, Name of God
the holy Spirit; whose Deity the Sea Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Augustinus cont^a
Haerese^, Alphonsus de C^stro, and Ephr^im P^git de Haeresibus.
Eunomians, Macedonians, Samosetanus, Photinus, and their followers d^nyed of
old (and Biddolph with others amongst us of late) as well as the Arrians denied
the Deity of Jesus Christ.

5ly. His words, That God requires this service of the knee, and that to his
Sons name (Jesus) Ye shall not displease him by it, fe^r not, etc. They that
will do no honor (he me^^s by this bowing at or to it, every time it is
recited) when time of need comes shall have no comfort by it: Have mind on him
that is named, and do his Name the Hono^r, and spare not, are such dangerous,
bold assertion^, as never fell from any Protestant Divines mouth or pen before
his; and that in a Royal Court-Auditory; and cannot be justified by any of his
Admi^ers; nor excused (as learned Bishop Morton confessed to me when he had
well considered them, and Archbishop Abbot too) from the censure of
Name-worship, Will Worship; nor distinguished from the Sea (...)
Papists worshipping of his Name, Cross, Body in the Eucharist, if compared
with his former passages.

6ly. Observe this other collateral passage of his, Not to do it at his Name?
Nay, at the holy Mysteries themselves not to do It. Which may have a harsh
construction agreeable to the Doctrine and practice of the Church of Rome: Even
to bow at, kneel to, See (...) ^ewell^ R^p^^ (...) Harding^ ^rt c. 8. of
Ad^ra^^^n.
adore the very Body of Christ in the consecrated Host, and Elements themselves
(as the 1 ^^r 11.^^.
Papists do) which he has left behind him in his Church (as the Bishop writes
he has (...) his Name) when he ascended into heaven, See here S^ct. 3.
to show forth his death till he come; This seems to be his meaning by his
precedent words, His name he has left behind to us, that we may show by our
reverence and respect to It, how much we esteem him. But to take them in the
favourablest sense, they import, That kneeling at or to the consecrated
Elements of Christ's body and blood, in the act of receiving them in the Lords
Supper, is a duty prescribed by, or necessarily inferred from this Text of
Phil^ 2.9, 10. as well as bowing at and to the name of Jesus, which some Great
Among others Dr. G. in in his Sermon before the Commons House, May 20 1661.
Rabbis have thence concluded, with more confidence then judgment. For as
there is not one syllable in the whole Text, Chapter or Epistle relating to, or
intended of the Lords Supper; and so not of kneeling, bowing at or to the
sacred Mysteries in it; So doubtless things in heaven, and things under the
earth, did never yet receive or eat the holy Sacrament; much less adore or
kneel thereat or thereto: Neither can this Text in any probability enjoin the
Posture of kneeling at the Lords Supper, upon these considerations following:

1. It is most apparent, that Jesus Christ himself instituted his last Supper
and admini^tred the consecrated bread and wine to all his Disciples as they
sat at the Luke 22.14, 21, 30. 1 Cor. 10.21. John 13.2, 28.
Table, immediately after the Pascal Supper ended in a Sitting, not Kneeling
Posture; as all the Evangelist^ ^hus jointly attest, Mat. 26.20. etc. Mar.
14.18; etc. Luke 14*22. etc. John 13.12. etc. When the ^ven was c^m^ H^ sat
down with the Twelve, as Matthew records it He sat down and the Twelve
Ap^stles with him. So Luke^ And as They Sat and did eat, afterward Jesus took
^read, etc (So Mark,) And said, Take, ^at, this i^ my body, etc. Compar^d with
Luke 22.27. Whether is gr^ater, He that si^teth at Meat, or he that serves? Is
not ^e that Sits at M^at? but I am among you as he that serves (spoken by
Christ to the Apostles at and while they sat receiving the Sea John 13: 13,
14, 15, 16.
Lords Supper, or applied by this Evangelist to that Season) And with Luke
24.30. (which some Protestants and most Papists apply to this Sacrament, after
Christ's Resurrecti^n) And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them; He
took Bread, and blessed it, and brake and gave to t^em. Therefore Christ
instituted, and the Apost^es received the Sacrament sitting, without all
dispute.

2ly. It was the constant usage and custom of the Jewish Nation, yea the
practice of Christ and his Apostles to Sit at all their Civil and Sacred
Fe^sts, Suppers, Sacrifices, R^pasts, as is most evident by all these ensuing
Texts, most express in point, Genesis 27.19. c 37.25. c 43.33. Exodus 16 3. ^ev.
32.6 Judge. 19.6. 1 Samuel 9.22. c. 16.11. c. 19^5, 24, 25 34. c. 20 24 Ruth 2.14.
1 Kings 10.4, 5. c. 13.19, 20. c. 15.35 2 Chronicles. 9.4. Ps. 26.4^ 5. Prove. 23. 1
Cant. 1.12. Ezech 44.3 Mich. 4.4. Neh. 8^ 7. Esther 3.15. c. 7.7. etc. Mat.
14.19, 20. c. 15 35. c. 26.6, 7. Lu. 14.7, 8, 9, 10. c. 17.7, 8. c. 7.36, 37 c.
9.14. Mark 2.15, 16. c. 13.3, 4. c. 6.39. etc. John 6.10, 11, etc. c. 12.1, 2.
Act^ 10.41. Mar. 8.6. c. 6. 21, 22, 26. 1 Cor. 8.10. c. 10.9. Lu. 22.14, 27,
30. Therefore no doubt they all ^sed this Ge^tur^ of Si^ting, not kneeling at
the eating and drinking the sacred Mysteries of the Lords Supper, as well as of
the Passover, a Type only of the Lords Supper; which the Jews alw^ies
received Sitting, after t^eir deliverance from the Ae^yptian bondage (though

4ly. The Jews and people of God, yea Heathens too, in their Solemn public and
private Fasts, Prayers, Sacrifices, Devotions usually SAT (not Kneeled) down
before the Lord and his Prophets, witness Judge. 20.26. 1 Samuel 1.9 2 Samuel 7.18.
1 Chronicles. 17.16. Ezra. 9.4. Neh. 1.4. Ps. 137.1. Genesis 31.10 1. Kings 19.4. Isay

27.61. Deuteronomy. 33.3^ 1 Cor 14 30. Jam. 2.3. Yea we read that Christ usually SAT
when he instructed the people; Mat. 13.1, 2^ etc. 26.55. he said, I sat daily
with you teaching in the Temple: yea he SITS now at his Fathers own right hand
in heaven, making intercession for u^. Col 3.1. Ps. 110.1. Romans 8.34. Hebr. 1.3
c. 10.12. Therefore it is more than probable (from this consideration) that
Christ and his Apostle SAT nor kneeled at the Lords Supper, this gesture of
Sitting being a gesture of humility (as St. Ena^ratio in Ps 126 Sessio
humilitatem significat.
Augustine defines) as well as Kneeling, and more frequently used in days,
duties of fasting and humiliation, than any other posture, a^ the premised
Scriptures evidence, or than falling down upon the knees to pray on such days
as these, of which we find one only President in Scripture, Ezra 9.5. and that
after long sitting down astonished, v. 3, 4. which sufficiently refutes the error
of those, who repute Kneeling the fittest, humblest gesture both in Prayer, and
receiving the Sacraments, though they use it not in the Act of Baptizing.

4ly. That Chrysostom, Theophilact, Calvin, Camerarius, Beza, and others on
Mat. 26.20. Mar. 14.18, etc* Lu: 22.14. are of opinion, that Christ and his
Apostles did eat the Pascal Supper standing; which being ended, Deinde
recumbentes, and recumbentibus tradidit suum Sacramentum: Primum enim perfecit
significatum, deinde verum perfecit: and recubuisse proprium Pascha traditurus.

Gulielmus Stuckius, Antiqu. Convivinalium, l. 2. c. 24. De more Sedendi ad
Mensam, de sedibus atque sellis, proves at large, that it was the general
custom of the Jews, as likewise of the Grecians, Romans, and most other Nations
in their Civil and Sacred Feasts, to sup and eat SITTING; and that Christ and
his Disciples did institute and eat the Lords Supper Sitting, which Buxdorfius,
and Antonius Walaeus Commentary on Mat. 26.20. prove at large, to whom I refer
the Readers for fuller satisfaction.

5ly. This truth of our Saviors and his Apostles Sitting at the Lords Supper,
See Thomas Beacon his Catechism, f. 484, 4^1.
That Christ administered and his Disciples received the Lords Supper Sitting,
is so apparent, that the Papists themselves (who, as most affirm) introduced
Kneeling at the Lords Supper to adore the Consecrated Elements, and that the
Priests might with more ease put the Bread into the Receivers mouths, which
themselves must not touch nor handle) in most of their Mass-books, Alexander
Alensis. Sum. Theol. Pars 4. qu. 11. Artic. 1. Qu An Christus suum met. corpus

M^ssals, B^eviaries, Hours, and other Books of Devotion, picture our Savior
in their Masses and Festival, De Caena Domini, sitting with his 12. Disciples
round about a Table administering the Lords Supper to them SITTING, not
Kneeling. And they have also compiled sundry Hymns, and Anthems, expressing
this their posture of Sitting at the Lords Supper, viz Alex A^ensis pars 4 p.
174.

Schoolmen debate at large, Whether his Body there present under the Elements
after Consecration (as they hold) be not now SITTING, not lying on the Altar;
because he first instituted it SITTING? as they unanimously grant; and is now
SITTING at Gods right hand in heaven.

Protestant Divines and Commentators I have seen on the Evangelists, jointly
grant and assert, that Chist instituted, and his Apostles received the Lords
Supper sitting; and our own Martyrs, Writers, both used and writ for the use,
continuance, and revival of this gesture of Sitting, as In his works p. 476.477.
Mr. William Tyndal, Catechism, f. 48^.
Thomas Beacon, in their Works, printed cum Privilegio long before Mr.
Cartwright and others raised this Cont^ove^sie; and Mr. Hooker, Bp. Morton Dr.
John burges, with others who have writ in defense of kneeling at the Sacrament,
acknowledge it for a truth. Whence In his works, London 1622 p. ^98.
Dr. Boys a Dean of Canterbury in his Pestil on St. Stephens day, thus argues
for the change of this posture used by Christ and his Apostles. Concerni^g
Kneeling at the Lords Supper, If the Church have power and authority ^o change

Chirsts was in the 1 Cor. ^1.23.
night; to change the place, whereas Christ ordained it in a Mat. 2^.18.
Private house, we communicate in a Temple. To change the Number and quality of
the Persons delivering the Sacrament unto more than twelve, and to Women as
well as Men; I see no reason but it has authority to change the Gesture. The
Time was altered, because for this Sacrifice the Morning is the most fit time;
the Place was altered, because the Church was the most fit place. The Gesture
was altered also (being a matter not of the Sacraments essence, but of outward
Order only,) because Kneeling is the most fit gesture, for Protestants
especially, who deny the gross real presence, and hold the Lords Supper an
Eucharist or thanksgiving unto God, for the redemption of the World by the
death of his Son; giving of thanks is a part of Prayer, and in Prayer no
gesture so fit as Kneeling. So that by this Doctors confession, Christ, his
Apostles, and the Primitive Christians used the gesture of Sitting, not
Kneeling at the holy Mysteries; till the Church by her own Authority, in after
ages, changed it into Kneeling. I wonder therefore much at Mr. Thomas Paybody
hi^ bold assertion in his Just Apology for the gesture of Kneeling in the Act
of receiving the Lords Supper, London 1629. part 2. p. 49. I do avow, that it
is impossible to demonstrate, so, as the Consci^nce may infallibly build
thereupon, that either Christ or his Apostles Sat in the Eucharistical Supper:
and at a Great Doctors assertion, that they kneeled at it, and received only
the Paschal Supper Sitting; when all the premised Scriptures, Authors, and
sundry more resolve the contrary.

What Church it was that changed this Gesture, and when, how, or for what cause
she did it, Dr. Boys defines not. Vol. 1. of his Works, ^. 484, 485.
But learned Thomas Beacon, Prebend of Canterbury, long before he was Dean, in
his Catechism printed cum Privilegio with his Works, London 1563. (dedicated ^o
all the Archbps. and Bp^. of England, and applauded with some of their
Panygerick Verses in commendation of his Piety and Learning) gives us this
account thereof, and of these Gestures of Kneeling and Sitting. Albeit I know
and confess that Gestures themselves be indifferent, yet I could wish all such
Gestu^es to be avoided, as have outwardly any appearance of evil, according to
this saying of St. 1 These. 5.
Paul, Abstain from all evil appearance. And forasmuch as Kneeling has been
long used in the Church of Christ at the receiving of the Sacrament, through the
doctrine of the Papists, although of it self it be indifferent, yet I could wish
it were taken away by Authority of the Higher Powers. Why so? for it has an
appearance of evil. When the Papists had made of the Sacramental Bread and Wine
a God, and had taught and commanded the People to worship it as God, than gave
they commandment streightwaies, that all the People should with all Reverence
Kn^el unto it, Worship and Heno^r it. And by this means the Gesture of Kneeling
crept in, and is yet used in the Church of the Papists, Nota.
to declare, That they Worship the Sacrament as their LORD GOD and SAVIOR. But
I would wish with all my heart that either their Kneeling at the Sacrament were
taken away, or else that the People were taught, that that outward Reverence
was not given to the Sacrament or outward sign, but to Christ which is
represented by the Sacrament. But the most certain and sure way is, utterly to
cease from Kneeling, that there may outwardly appear no appearance of evil,
according to the commandment of St. Paul: lest the Enemies by the continuance
of Kneeling should be confirmed in their Error, Nota.
and the Weaklings offended and plucked back from the truth of the Gospel;
Kneeling with the knowledge of godly honor is due unto none but God alone.
Therefore when Satan Mat. 4.
commanded our Savior Christ to kneel down before him and worship him; he
answered, It is written thou shall worship the Lord thy God. As concerning
Sitting at the Lords Table, which is also used in certain reformed Churches, if
it were received by Public authority and common consent* and might
conveniently be used in our Churches, I could allow that Gesture best. For as
it is not to be doubted but that Christ and his Disciples Sat at the Table,
where Christ delivered unto them the Sacrament of his Body and Blood Nota.
which use was also observed in the Primitive Church a long time after; so
likewise is it most comely, that we Christians follow the Example of our Master
Christ and of his Disciples: nothing can be unreverently done that is done
after the example of Christ and of his Apostles: We come together to eat and
drink the holy mysteries of the body and blood of Christ, we have a Table set
before us, is it not meet and convenient that we sit at our Table? The Table
being prepared who stands or kneeleth at his meat? Yea rather who sits not
down? When Christ fed the people, he bade them not knee^ nor stand upon their
feet, but he commanded them to Mat. 14 19. c. 15.35. Man. 6.39. c. 8.6. John
6.20. Luke 9.14, 15
sit down: which kind of gesture is most meet when we assemble to eat and
drink, which thing we do at the Lords Table: Neither does the ^itting of the
Communicants at the Lords Table want her glory; for as the standing of the Jews
at the eating of the Lords Passover, signified, that there was yet to come
another Doctrine then the Law of Moses, even the preaching of the glorious
Gospel of our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus; and other Sacraments than
Circumcision and the Passover, even the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords
S^pper; So in like manner the sitting of the Christian Communicants at the
Lords Table, does signify, preach and declare unto us, that we are come to our
journies end concerning Religion, and that there is none other Doctrine, nor
none other Sacraments to be looked for then these only, which we have received
of Christ the Lord. And therefore we, sitting down at the Lords Table, show by
that gesture, that we are come to the perfection of our Religion, and look for
none other Doctrine to be given unto us. Thus this ancient Lea^ned Prebend. Mr.
Roger Cutchud some years before him, in his first and second Sermons of the
Sacrament, Anno 1552. printed Cum Privilegio 1560. determine^ the like in these
words, Many coming to the Lords Table do mis-behave themselves, and so do the
lookers on, in that they worship the Sacrament with kneeling and bowing their
bodies, and knocking their breasts, and with elevating of their hands: If it
were to be elevated and showed to the standers by, as it has been used, Christ
would have elevated it above his head; He delivered it into the hands of his
Disciples, bidding them to eat it, and not to hold up their hands; to receive
it, and not to worship it: And so delivered it to them Sitting, and not
Kneeling. Only God is to be so honored with this kind of ^everence, and no
Sacrament; For God is not a Sacrament, neither is the Sacrament God: Let us use
it as Christ and his Apostles did; if thou will be more devout then they w^r^^
be not deceiv^d, but beware that thy Devotion be not Idolatry. So he.

As for Dr. ^oyes (with Bishop Andrews, Bp. Mor^^n, Dr John (...) Payb^dy
and others) reason for the Churches changing Christ's, his Apostles, and the
Primitive Churches Sitting at the Lords Supper, into Kneeling; Because there is
giving of th^nks in the Lords Supper, (which is therefor styled the
Eucharist,) which is a part of Prayer; and in Prayer no g^stur^ so fit as
Kneeling; this is very weak and unsatisfactory to many judicious Christian^. 1
Because by this Reason all Christians and Kneelers at the Lords Supper, ought
not to sit, but kneel at their own Tables too, when they eat and drink, because
they do, or ought 1 T^m. 4.5.
to pray* and give thanks to God, before and after meat, and bless their meat,
as our Savior did the Mat 26.26. 1 Cor. 11 24. Rom 14.20. Luke 22.19. c. 24 ^0.
Sacramental bread and wine, in imitation of the Custom of the Jews
consecrating and blessing their meat and drink at their Feasts, and Tables in
their private houses, as Antiq. Con^ivalium l. 2. c. 36. De Consecra^ione
Mensae, qua Iudaei Christiani, and aliae ^entes olim usae sunt and h^die
^tuntur, p. 27^, etc.
Guliel. Stuckiu^, with others cited by him, and In Mat 26 14. Mark 6 39, 40,
41. c. 8.6.
Walaeus, Ainsworth, Buxdorfius* prove most amply. But Christ, though be gave
thanks and blessed the bread and wine at his last Supper, did not kneel, but
sat with his Apostles at the Table, both when he blessed and distributed the
Elements, as the premises evidence: Yea when he solemnly blessed and
distributed the Loaves and Fishes to the people, and the bread he did eat with
his twelve Disciples, he made them sit down (not kneel) both before and whiles
he blessed them, and gave thanks, and did eat sitting, Mat. 14 19. Mark
6.39.40, 41. chap. 8.6 John 6.10, 11. Luke 24.30. and all Christians still do
the like at their own Tables: This therefore can be no sufficient reason to
change sitting into kneeling. 2ly. If Thanksgiving be a part of Prayer, and
therefore to be performed kneeling, as the fittest posture, not sitting, or
standing, pray why do these Dr. Boys his Postills, p. 7. See My short
Pacifique Examination, p. 8, to 24.
Kneelers teach us, That we ought to stand up at Gloria Patri, and rise up from
our knees and seats to repeat it? and some Popish Canons enjoin all to stand up
while it is repeated? Is it not a Thanksgiving, a Blessing, and so a part of
Prayer, as well as the Eucharist? They must therefore kneel at that for the
future, or else disclaim this reason, and their standing up at it. 3ly. The
Priests and others used to stand up to give praise and thanks to God, 2 Chronicles
20.19. 1 Kings 8.14, 15. Yea the Israelites more usually stood, then kneeled,
when they prayed to God in public or private, as is evident by 1 Kings 8.14 2 Chronicles. 20.5. chap. 9.13. Genesis 19*27. Levit. 9.5. Deuteronomy. 10 8. chap. 29* 10. 2 Chronicles. 29.11. Ezech. 44.11, 15. Ier. 15.1. chap. 18 20. And not only the
Pharisee, but humble Publican in the Gospel, stood not kneeled when he prayed
with a dijected face and spirit, Lord be merciful to me a sinner, Luke 18.11,
13. yea Christ's Disciples likewise stood when they prayed, and used the Lords
Prayer, Nota.
and that by Christ's approbation, if not express precept, Mark 11.25. When ye
See Walaeus on this Text.
stand praying, forgive, etc. which relates to Mat. 6.14. immediately following
the ^ords Prayer, which we never read the Apostles used kneeling, but standing
only, and that by Christ's approbation and command: How then can kneeling be the
fittest gesture in Prayer, and for the Lords Prayer especially, which most
Bishops and Ministers kneel down to say at the end of their own Prayers before
their Sermons, which they make standing, not kneeling? Why stand or kneel they
not a like at both, and contradict the Apostles practice as well in kneeling at
the Lords Prayer, as at the Lords Supper, when as they stood at the one, and
s^te at the other? Is not this to bid a Non-obstante to Christ and his
Apostles? To control and censure their practice, gesture, instead of imitating
them? To 1 Pet. 5 3.
Lord it over Gods people and inheritance, and deprive them of that Christian
Liberty which Christ himself has purchased for them? 4ly. There is not one
precept nor president in the Bible for Kneeling at the Lords Supper, but many
direct Texts and Presidents that Christ and his Apostles received it sitting,
whose examples we ought to imitate, rather then any Doctors Phantasmes. No
precept in the Old Testament or New, and very few presidents in either for
Kneeling in Prayer, especially in public Prayer: There are many Presidents for
sitting and standing both in public and private Prayers, ^ast^, Humiliations,
in the Texts forecited, and the Tertul. de ^ejunio, and Corona Militis* Cyprian

Century Writers, (much urged of late) who after she had received the
consecrated bread into her hand, (according to the Custom then used) from St.
Chrysostom, conveyed it away, and put other unconsecrated bread into her
mouth, brought to her secretly by her Servant, from her house, for which end,
P^rinde quasi orationi vacatura se inclinata summisit (^o Nicephorus) Mysterium

quasi oratura in terram inclinaret, aliud quoddam domo ablatum, famula, quam ad
eam rem instruxerat, subministrante, cum ori admovisset, ecce inter mandendum
in lapidem induruit, as Sozomen records it. All Historians agreeing, that she
received the consecrated bread not kneeling (as Dr. Burges, his Lawfulnes of
kneeling in receiving the Lords Supper, p. 83 and Dr. G. in his Sermon 1661.
some Great Doctors mistake) but sitting or standing; she kneeling and bowing
down as if she were about to pray, after she had received it in her hand in
another posture, to convey it away secretly to her servant only, not to eat it.

Finally, There is not one Canon to be found made by any General, National,
Provincial, Council, or Synod from Christ's institution of the Lords Supper,
till above 1460. years after his Ascension: Not any one Rubric in all the
Liturgies, Writings of the Fathers, or Missals, Breviaries, Offices,
Pontificals, Ceremonials of the Church of Rome it self, that I could either
find, upon my best search, or any other yet produce, enjoining Communicants to
kneel in the Act of Receiving.

This truth is acknowledged, and thus proved at large by our learned Dr. John
Burges, the best, eminentest Champion, for this Gesture of kneeling of all
others. This gesture of Kneeling was never any constituted Ceremony of the
Church of Rome, nor is it at this day. Bellarm. l. 2. de Missa, c. 14, 15. sets
down all the Ceremonies of the Mass, and Dr Burges his Answer rejoyned to the
Reply of Dr. Mortons general Defense, p 478, 479, 480. dedicated to King
Charles the first.
never mentions Kneeling in the Act of Receiving, as one of them; no nor yet
the Mass Book, which shows when the Priest or People must bow or kneel for
adoration of the Crucifix, Altar or Sacrament. De Ritibus Eccles. Cathol. l. 2.
p. 557. n. 29. c. 55.
Durantus, writing of the Roman Ceremonies, not only names not this gesture for
one in the act of receiving, but, on the contrary affirms, That it ought to be
taken Standing, and proves it also. And so does the Ordo Roman. Bibl. Patr.

every Priest by order of the Mass Book, reverenter stans standing reverently
at the Altar, and not kneeling there. The Bowing or Kneeling of the Priest at
the Mass, are to the Crucifix set on the Altar, to the Altar, or at the time of
consecration, that is, immediately after it. Durantus de Ri^ibus, p 443, ^43 l.
2. c. 11
The People which ^eceive not, a^ well as those that do receive, are reverenter
inclinari se, reverently to bow themselves to the Sacrament, not when they
receive i^, but when the Priest does elevate the Paten, or Chalice for
Adora^ion, or when the Host is carried to any sick ^^rson, or in Procession.
And this is that Adoration which was first brought in by In De^ret. Greg. I^^.
41.
Pope Honorius the Third, and not any Kneeling or Ado^ation in the Act of
Receiving. True it is that the Receivers of the Host from ^he hand of the
Priest do Kneel, not ^or Adora^ion, but of an ancient Custom, (since
tran^ubstantiation) not by Order or Institution. Only in some places and
occasi^ns they do it, but then not for Adoration, but either for reverence of
the Lib C^remon. 2 p 181
Pope (as when he administreth to the Subdeacon, as they do also take hallowed

KNEELING upon one of the greeces he m^st hold all his Body upright, and
opening his mouth neither too much nor too little, without turning his eyes or
countenance undecently aside, in comely order and r^verence he is to rec^ive
the Sacrament. This KNEELING of the Communicant is not for adoration of the
S^cram^nt, no more than the KNEELING of those which stand side-wayes to hold
the Napkin. Yea prostration, or bowing the trunk of the Body, is there
forbidden them when they receive, which is in the same Chapter commanded for
adoration to those that do not then communicate, but look on, ut stent super
formas prostrati, and all before the Sacrificer himself, prosternant se
adorantes. So that this Kneeling in the Receiving, was only for the convenience
of putting the Host into the mouth of the Receiver, and not for adoration of
the Eucharist. And yet this is not any established Ceremony of the Church of
ROME at this day. This may further appear not to be for Adoration, Because the
Priest himself receives in both kinds standing. Nay it is against their rule
that a man should adore any thing lower than himself; The reason with them is,
that (...), to worship or fall down, requires position of the whole body lower
than that which is worshipped. Papatus sive depravatae Religionis o^i^o, p. 7^.
Edenbu^g. 1594.
Mr. Thomas Morrison reports of one in Savoy who escaped difficultly for
looking downward at the Host, passing by his window in procession* It is
therefore without question true, that Kneeling in the Act of Receiving, was
never any instituted Ceremony of the Church of ROME, nor never used when it was
used with them for adoration of the Sacrament, as is falsely believed and talked
of by many. Thus this learned Doctor, positively (and I conceive most truly)
concludes in a Book d^dicated by him to King Charles the first, An. 1631. And
he asserts the like almost in the same words, in his T^eatise o^ The
lawfullness of Kneeling in the Act of Receiving, p^inted London 1631. dedicated
to the Lord Keeper Cov^ntry, chapter 21. p. 66, 67, 68. and chapter 32. p. 110, 111,
where he confesses, likewise, That KNEEL^NG before and to the Host to have
come in by Antichrist, when midnight was upon the face of the world, and
Antichrist in his hight. Yet concludes, KNEELING in the ^ct of Receiving was
not ever yet strengthened with ANY PAPAL DECREE; but has been since made a
Footbanke unto that Antichristian Monst^r of Transubstantiation, only by
misinterpretation of it, by such as sought out all means, and laid hold on any
colorable thing, that might suckle the monster of their brain, when it was once
born. So this Doctor.

This kneeling then in the Act of receiving is acknowledged by all its
learnedest Advocates, to be introduced only by Custom, Usage, after
Transubstantiation, and Adoration of the Host, (prescribed first by Pope
Honorius about the year of Christ, 1226. promoted by the Feast of Corpus
Christi instituted by Pope Urban; and confirmed for ever by multitudes of
Pardons in the Council of Vienna by Pope Clement the 5. in the year 1310 as our
learned Repl^ to H^rding, 8 A^t^cle of Ad^ra^^^on p. 381. etc. Dr. John Burges

Bp. Jewel, and others affi^m) without any Canon imposing it on the people. The
first Rubric that ever I met with (except that of the Missal for the Friars
Predicants, forecited) is that in the Common Prayer Book, set forth and
confirmed by King Edward the Sixth, in the year 1552. used, continued in all
Books of Common P^ayer ever since. Then shall the Minister first receive the
Communion in both kinds himself, and next deliver it to other Ministers, if any
be there present, that they may help the chief Minister; and after TO THE
PEOPLE IN THEIR HANDS, KNEELING: Which Rubric, as the words and manner of
penning declare, is rather a Direction, than Injunction to the People to
receive KNEELING; For it commands not in precise words, That the People shall
all receive the Communion Kneeling, or only Kneeling, in the Affirmative, not
Sitting or Standing in the Negative; much less does it threaten or inflict any
penalty at all on the Minister if he give, or on the People if they receive it
otherwise; nor enable the Minister to refuse the Lords Supper to such who
scruple to take it KNEELING; for he is peremptorily enjoined by the Statute of
1 E. 6. c. 1. Not without a Lawful Cause (to wit, for the scandalous crimes
contained in the Rubric or Exhortation before the Communion, and in case of
Malice, or Hatred,) to DENY the Sacrament TO ANY WHO SHALL DEVOUTLY AND HUMBLY
DESIRE IT, ANY LAW, CUSTOM OR ORDINANCE TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING: Only
it directs the Minister, to deliver it to the People in their hands KNEELING;
and withal makes an Apology in another Rubric in both King Edwards Books, to
clear the use of kneeling from any Superstition or intention of Adoration of
Christ's Body in the Elements, or any justification of Transubstantiation, to
which ends the Church of Rome had abused it. All which being duly pondered, and
that the first Reformers of our Religion under King Henry the Eighth, in their
Treatise concerning the Lords Supper, compiled in the year of our Lord 1533.
(printed at the end of Mr. William Tyndal, our famous learned Martyr his
Works, p. 476, 477.) desired, That Christian Princes would command and
establish a Form of Administering the Lords Supper by them described, wherein
ALL THE CONGREGATION are ordered, TO SIT ROUND ABOUT THE LORDS TABLE, as
Christ, his Apostles, and the Primitive Christians did. And then compared with
these ensuing Confessions of Doctor John Burges in his learned Treatises
purposely written in his Defense of the Lawfullnesse of KNEELING in the Act of
Receiving, dedicated to our late King CHARLES and the Lord Keeper Coventry:
Namely, The Preface of the Answer^s, p. 25.
That the Church of England, holds sitting or standing to be as lawful and
holy as kneeling, putting no necessity or worship of God in any of these

Beza and other Churches, which live pell-mell with the Popish, where Idolatry
is openly in the streets committed, in bowing to a piece of bread, as i^ it
were nothing else but Christ himself, shifted into a new suit of apparel, had
reason enough to forbear this gesture in their Churches, and to dissuade it as
a thing which had been and therefore might be dangerous. And therefor Beza
does no where condemn the use of it, as in it self unlawful, but only
defends the Churches, which in respect of the peril that might ensue, or out
of a desire to root out the bread-worship out of the minds of men, do decline
the use of this Ceremony. And this was the judgment of all those Divines, who
in the name of the French and Dutch Churches, made certain Observations upon
the Harmon* Confess Geneva. 1521 sect. 14. p. 120.
Harmony of Confessions, set out at Geneva in Beza his time, Anno 1581. for in
their fourth Observation on the Confession of Bohemia, sect. 14. they say thus,
In this Rite of Kneeling, we leave each Church to their own liberty; not that
we condemn it simply, as evil in it self, (used with caution given in our
fourth Observation;) But for the rooting of bread-worship out of men's minds, it
is better that Ceremony in most places were abolished, in receiving of the
signs themselves. May sufficiently persuade his Majesty, our Bishops, Lords,
and Parliaments, to indulge the liberty of sitting to those who scruple
kneeling at the Lords Supper, since the Church of Rome her self prescribes it
not by any Canon or Rubric in the act of receiving, and there has been, is,
and may be peril and scandal in its use.

Now whereas some conceit and object, That it is a great contumacy,
irreverence, sauciness, boldness, for those who confess themselves Mat

unworthy to gather the crumbs under Christ's Table, at his Supper, to presume
Lu. 22.14 29.27.30 1 Cor. 10.21. John 12.2. c. 13.12.23.
to sit and eat the consecrated Bread, and drinks the Cup at or upon the Table
it self; not KNEELING at a distance before, or prostrate under it. I desire
such Objectors to ^ons^der. 1. That Christ himself out of his infinite love,
invites all Communicants, not to gather up the crumbs under this his Table like
Mat. 15.26, 27. Mar. 7.2^, 28.
Dogs, or as the Judges 1.7.
captive Kings did under Adonibezecks ( the proud Tyrants) Table, but to sit
down, eat, and drink the consecrated Bread, Wine, and this his Heavenly Banquet
at his Table. Therefore it is rather a high contempt, disobedience, Col. 2.18.
voluntary sinful Humility, or slighting, undervaluing of Christ's love and
grace, for any invited Gue^ts like Dogs and Slaves to lie prostrate before or
under his sacred Table, then with Faith and holy confidence to approach unto
it, to sit, eat, and drink thereat as he enjoins them. 2ly. That if it were no
ill manners, presumption, or irreverence for the Mat. 26.20. Mark 2.15, 16. chapter
6.39, 40. chapter 14.18. Luke 14.1, 8, 9, 10, 15, to 25 chapter 12, 14, 19, 27, 30. chapter

Disciples, Lazarus, and others, to sit down with Christ himself, whiles on
earth, at ordinary Tables, the Pascal Supper, and Lords Table too, or in John
12.23, chapter 21.20.
St. John, to lean on his breast and bosom at it; or in the Primitive Church,
Christians to sit, eat, and drink the consecrated Elements at the Lords Table,
for many hundred years after Christ's Incarnation; then doubtless it can be no
contempt, misdemeanor, irreverence, unmannerlinesse for any now to do the like,
but rather it must be so in those who refuse to do it, upon such fancies,
grounds, which either Christ, his Apostles, the Primitive Church, Christians
knew not, or deemed insufficient to induce them to change fitting into kneeling
at the Lords Supper. 3ly. If the Objectors or other Subjects, or persons of
inferior quality, were invited to sit down and eat at the Kings, Princes, Lord
Keepers, Lord Mayors, or any other Great Man's Table, at Dinner, or Supper, it
would be reputed a strange singularity, folly, indecency, or contempt, (not
reverence, decency, or good manners) in or for all or any of them, out of
pretended modesty or unworthiness, to kneel down only before, or lie prostrate
under their Tables, but not to sit down at them, and eat together with them,
when commanded, as Gulielmus Stuckius, Antiq. Convivalium, l. 2. c. 34*
all anciently, and at this day use to do, without kneeling, or prostration at
or under the Table. Why should it not then be so in those invited by Christ
himself, to eat and drink at his sacred Table? 4ly. Christ Jesus by his death,
merits, and transcendent love, has not only made us Ephesians. 5.30. 1 Cor. 12.27.

That they may eat and drink at his Table, in his Kingdom, and sit on Thrones,
and in Ephesians. 2.5, 6.
Heavenly places, together with him, not pick up crumbs under his Table, or
kneel, or lie prostrate at a distance from it. All which con^idered, may
satisfy the Objectors, at leastwise so far, as to dissuade them from censuring
their fellow Communicants who receive sitting, as irreverent, proud, profane,
und^vou^, irr^ligious, or restraining this their Christian Liberty and posture
of sitting in receiving, the only thing they contend for, leaving them to
kneel, or use what gesture they deem best, for their own particular practice.

If any yet further object, (as Bish^p And^ews P^ybody, and others
they do) That in the Lords Supper we receive a Pardon of all our sins from
God, under the Great Seal of Heaven; Therefore we ought to receive it kneeling,
as Malefactors use to receive their Pardons under Seal from the hands of their
King, kneeling on their knees.

I answer, 1. The Lords Supper is not a Pardon under Seal, Mark 14.24. Mat.
26.28. This Cup is the New Testament of my blood which is shed FOR MANY, not
all.
to all Communicants, since the unworthy eat and drink Damnation to themselves
therein, 1 Cor. 11.27, 28, 29, 30. 2ly. It was instituted not as a Pardon
Sealed, but in remembrance of Christ's death and passion for our sins, and to
show forth his death till he come, Luke 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.24 25, 26. 3ly. It is
received, only as spiritual meat and drink, to feed and nourish our souls unto
everlasting life; to 1 Cor. 11.24, ^0. Mat 2^.26, 27. Luke 12.19, 20. Mark
14.^2, 23.
eat and drink as food; not to keep or reserve in a Trunk, Pix, or Box, as men
keep their Pardon^, without eating them, I am sure without drinking them, when
sealed only with hard Wax and Parchment: Therefore they rather ought to receive
it sitting, as a sacred Feast and Supper, at which all usually sit, not kn^el;
not as a Pardon, which. none ever received in a Patten or Chalice. 4ly. Though
Malefactors receive Charters of Pardon from their Princes own hands now and
then, kneeling; yet none use to receive them from their Officers or Ministers
hands in that posture in our own or other Kingdoms; who ever received a Pardon
or Charter thus from the Lord Keeper at a Seal, or from the Hanaper Officers?
Nor is the Lords Supper now received by any from Christ^ or Gods immediate
hands, but only from their Ministers; Therefore we ought not to kneel by their
own comparison. 5ly. The Apostles when they received it from Christ's own hands
at its first institution, who best knew the nature of it, did not receive it
kneeling, but sitting: Neither did any afterward receive it kneeling, but
sitting from the Apostles and primitive Fathers hands; why then should all now
receive it from the Priests or Ministers hands only, kneeling, not sitting,
since this reason prevailed not with them to give or receive it kneeling? 6ly.
The chief cause of receiving it kneeling in the Church of Rome after
Transubstantiation introduced, as Dr. John Burgess confesses, (and that on the Sea here p. 76, 77.
steps near the Table) was, that the Priests might with more ease put it into
the Receivers mouths without spilling, who might not take or receive it with
their own hands: which custom being exploded in our Church (all receiving it in
their hands, and putting it into their own mouths) the reason of the
introduction and use of Kneeling cease.

To close up this point, I shall seriously request all Protestant Kings,
Nobles, Parliaments, and Layme^^ considerately to observe the sad effects and
dangerous consequences of allowing any Church, Council, Convocation of
Clergymen, (who usually monopoli^e both the Title and Power of the Artic. 20.
Acts 20.2^.
CHVRCH, though never so styled in Scripture, or the Articles of our Church) a
power to alter or innovate any Ceremony or Rite, used by our Savior or his
Apostles, in the Institution and Celebration of the Lords Supper, upon pretext
of Custom and lawful Authority in the Church so to do; (the Sea here p 68, 69,

Council of Constance. Upon a Petition and Complaint of some Bishops and
Churchmen in that Council, Anno 1414. Of the growth of Heresy and Schism in
some parts of the world, by administering the Lords Supper to Laymen in both
kinds, and likewise after Supper, or else not Fasting, by some Priests,
according to Christ's own Primitive Institution, and the Apostles practice, who
pertinacio^sly affirmed that they ought to do thus, against the laudable Custom
of the Church, reasonably introduced. Hereupon this sacred Council (as they
style themselves) lawfully ass^m^led in the Holy Ghost, endeavoring to provide
for the safety of the faithful against this Heresy, by the mature
deliberation of the Prelates therein assembled, and of many Doctors as well of
the Divine as Humane Law, declared, decreed; and defined, (by a special Canon
therein ratified) Quod licet M^t. 26 M^r. 14. Luk 2^. (...) q^oted ^n (...)
Ma^gin.
Ch^is^us post Coenam instituerit, etc. That although Christ instituted after
Supper, and administered this venerable Sacrament to his Disciples under both
species of Bread and Wine, Tamen hoc non obstante: Yet notwithstanding this the
Authority of the sacred Canons (preferred before the Canon of the Scriptures)
the laudable and approved Custom of the Church, has observed, and does
observe, That this Sacunrament ought not to be celebrated after Supper, nor to
be received of Christians who are not Fasting, (unless in case of Infirmity,
or other Necessity, granted or admitted by the Law, or the Church.) And
likewise, licet in Primitiva Ecclesia, etc. Although in the Primitive Church
this Sacrament was received by the faithful under both species. Tamen, etc.
Yet notwi^hstanding to avoid some Perils and Scandals, this ^^stom was
introduced afterward, that it should be received by those who consecrated,
under both spec^es, and by Laymen, only under the species of Bread: Since it is
most firmly believed, and in no wise to be doubted, That the entire Body and
Blood of Christ is truly contained as well under the species of Bread, as under
the species of Wine: Wherefore seeing, this custom was rationally introduced
and very long observed by the Church and Holy Fathers, it is to be reputed for
a Law, which is not lawful for any to reject or change at pleasure without
Authority of ^he Church. Wherefore to say, that it is Sacrilegious, or
unlawful to observe this Custom or Law, ought to be reputed erroneous; and
pertinaciter asserentes oppositum praemiss^rum, etc. and those who peremptorily
assert the contrary, are to be banished, and grievously punished as Heretics,
by ^he Diocesans of the places or their O^^icials, or by the Inquisitors of
Heretical pravi^y in Kingdoms and Provinces, in which any thing shall
peradventure be attempted or presumed against this Decree, according to the
Canons and lawful Statutes wholso^ly invented in favor of the Catholic
Faith, against Heretics.

Also this Holy Synod decrees and declares upon this matter, that process
shall be directed to all the most Reverend Fathers in Christ, Lords Patria^ch^,
Primates, Archbishops, Bishop^, and their Vicars in Spi^ituals, wherever
constituted, in which it shall be committed and commanded to them, by Authority
of this Council, under pain of Excomm^nication, that they effectually punish
those offending against this Decree, who communicate the people under both
species of Bread and Wine, or that exhort or teach them that it ought to be
done. And if they return to repentance, they may be received to the bosom of
the Church, wholesome Penance being enjoined to them according to the measure
of the ^ffence. But such of them who with obstinate minds shall not care to
return to repentance, are to be restrained (and punished) by them, by
Ecclesiastical censures, and the aid likewise of the Secular Arm is to be
invocated for this end, if need shall require.

Here this Popish Council sets up the late Custom, Power Canons of the Church.
1. To alter the very institution of Christ himself, the practice of the
Apostles and primitive Church, Fathers, first in two particular Circumstances
or Ceremonies observed by them in the celebration of the Lords Supper, to wit,
1. In the time of receiving it after Supper. 2ly. In the manner of receiving
it, after meat, but not fasting; And from these 2. Alterations in these
Circumstances, proceeds in the third place, to make, justify, decree ^ Most
sacrilegious alteration in the substance of it, in taking away one Part
thereof, to wit, the Cup and Wine from all the Laity at one blow; upon this
absurd heretical Whymsical Reason, and notorious untruth, laid down as a most
certain undubitable truth, That the Body and Blood of Christ are (by way of
concomitance) contained and received under each species of Bread and Wine. 2ly.
It sets up, justifies, decrees a direct contrary custom of receiving the Lords
Supper, 1. only in the mo^ning, 2. only fasting, 3. for Priests only in both
kinds, 4. for all Laymen, under the species of Bread alone without the Cup;
with a most a^dacious, blasphemous, peremptory NON OBSTANTE to Christ himself,
the Apostles and primitive Churches Practice and In^titution. 3ly. It
prohibites Priests and People too, either to imitate their examples, or
institution for the future; or to say, preach, or affirm they ought to imitate
them; or so much as to speak against any of those their late Cu^tomes and
Antichristian Innovations, Errors. 4ly. They excommunicate, banish, punish all
those as HERETICS, and prosecute, persecute them with Ecclesiastical censures
of all kinds, and the power of the secular arm, if they once presume in any
place by words or deeds to follow the Precept or Pre^ident of Christ, his
Apo^^les and the Primitive Church, or oppose or submit not to their
Innovations, Inversions, and subversions of them. 5ly. If the terror of those
Ce^sures prevail to force conformity to their Innovations in any former
Nonconformist, whether Priest or ^ayman, he must not be received into the
bosom of ^he Church, without public penitence, and Penance proportinable to
his offense.

What effusion of Christian blood, Martyrdomes, Wars, Schisms, Tumults,
Controversies this Canon has procured throughout Ch^istendome ever since, the
Histories of Bohemia, G^rmany. France, Spain, Italy, England, the Netherlands,
Mr. Fox his Acts and Monuments, with other Martyrologies, and will abundantly
inform us.

Our most gracious Lord God and Author of this holy Sacrament of love and
unity, so in^pire, direct our Religious indulgent Sovereign Lord the King, his
Parliament, Council, Bishops, Ministers with the Spirit of Wisdom, Clemency,
Moderation, and Christian compassion towa^ds the ^ender scrupulo^s consciences
of many thousand Ministers, and truly loyal, d^tifull pious Subject^, in this
particular, that the Alteration of receiving the Lords Supper from its
primitive, ancient, usual gesture of sitting, practiced by Christ, his
Apostles, the primitive Church and Ch^istians for many hundred years to
Kneeling, only by late Custom since Transubstantiation, and Adoration
introduced by the Church of Rome, for the premised ends; the total abandoning
of Sitting, and enjoining the sole use o^ Kneeling to all Ministers and
Communicants whatsoever; the suspending pious Ministers from their Ministry,
Benefices, and inflicting ^cclesiastical Censures on them as Non-conformists,
Schismatics, for not Kneeling, or delivering the Lords Supper to their People
sitting; or writing, preaching in defense of this Ge^ture; practiced
heretofore; the dep^iving of those Laymen who refuse to receive Kneeling (for
the premised Reasons) not only of the consecrated Cup, as this Popish Council
of Constance (with the Councils of Basil, Se^^io 30. and of Trent, Sessio 21.
c. 1. si^ce that) did, but even of the Bread too, which Romis^ Priests indulge
to all Laymen; and totally secluding those from the Sacrament, who out of
conscience refuse to take it Kneeling, yea Members of Parliament themselves,
and passing them by with public contempt, as of late when they were all
enjoined to receive the Lords Supper together; and that against the express
words of his Majesty's most gracious 5 October. 1660. p. 16.

moderation therefore (in these Particulars of Sit^ing, Kneeling and Bowing at
the Name of Jesus) be known unto all men; and exercised toward each other; for

Precept, Expostulation, and advise of God himself, and his Apostle St. Paul to
the Church, Saints of Rome it self, and throughout the World in a like case, To
14 3, etc. Let not him that eats (the Lords Supper kneeling) despise him that
eats not (kneeling) nor him that eats not, (sitting, o^ standing, but
kneeling) judge him that eats (sitting) for God has received him. Who art
thou that judge another man's Servant? to his own Master he stands or
falls, (sits or kneeleth.) He that ^a^eth (sitting or standing) eats to
the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not (sitting or
standing, but kneeling) to the Lord he eats not (so) and gives God thanks:
Why do thou judge thy Brother, or why do thou set at naught thy Brother?
(who receives sitting, standing or kneeling) We shall al^ stand before the
Judgment seat of Christ Let us not therefore judge (or censure) one another
(in these See Augusti^. ad Simplicianum, l. 2. qu. 4. Dr. John Burgess of the

indiff^rent Gestures) any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a
stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his Brothers way. Let us therefore
follow after things that make for P^ace and things whereby we may edify (not
crucify, grieve, destroy, excommunicate, or discontent) each other. Destroy
not him with thy meat (or thy gesture at it) for whom Christ died. All things
indeed are pur^, but it is ill for that man who eats with offense; or to
impose any Gesture) whereby thy Brother stumbleth, or is off^nd^d, or made
weak. Happy i^ he that condemns not himself in that which he allows; for
whatsoever i^ not of Faith is Sin to him that does it.

But to leave this Collateral Discourse of Kneeling at the Sacrament, which
some would enforce from this Text; and return to Bishop Andrews passages
concern^ng Bowing AT and TO the Name of Jesus, as a duty of the Text. I shall
desire the Readers to take notice of these Mistakes and Errors (as I humbly
conceive them) not only couched, but clea^^y ^xpr^ssed in them.

His first Error is this, That the name Jesus is the name above every name
intended in this Text, which Fathers and modern Exp^sitors gainsay.

His Second, That the name Jesus is above all names whatsoever, yea, above the
name of God

His Third, That this name Jesus is one of Gods own names, and the chiefest
name of God.

His Fourth, That this Text enjoynes men to bow TO (not in or at) this very
name Jesus, and to this name only.

His Fifth, That our Savior has left this his name behind him, now his Person
is ascended into Heaven, to this very end, that we might do reverence and bow
unto it.

His Sixth, That the words of the Text are so plain, as they are able to
convince any man's conscience, that they ought to bow to the name of Jesus when
rehearsed in the Church.

His Seventh, That there is no Writer of the Ancients on this place (except
Origin) but literally understands it, and likes well we should actually
perform this duty of bowing to the name of Jesus when pronounced.

His Eighth, That Ambrose, Hierome, Cyril, and Theodoret (in their Quotations
in his Margent) are of this opinion, and thus understand this Text.

His Ninth, That there want not Reasons why we should rather bow to the name of
Jesus, than to the name of Christ.

His Tenth, That Christ is not, yea cannot be the name of God.

His Eleventh, That God cannot be anointed.

His Twelfth, That Jesus is the chief name of God, and so by consequence, that
Jesus could not be anointed, for therein consists the force of this Reason.

His Thirteenth, That the name Christ was communicated by God to others, but
the name Jesus, not, it being a proper name to our Savior only.

His Fourteenth, That that which is proper, is above that which is holden in
common.

His Fifteenth, That Christ is not so good as Jesus, because the end is better
than the means, and he was anointed that he might be a Savior.

His Sixteenth, That we must bow to the name of Jesus with reference to the
sense, That is, with ^eference to the Person of Jesus, as he is a Savior.

His Seaventeenth, That this bowing is no taken-up worship, or humane invention
or injunction, but a ^uty of the Text, directly set down by God himself, yea an
Act which is of Gods own prescribing.

His Eighteenth, That the Brazen Serpent was not a thing enjoined nor
instituted by God himself, as this is.

His Nineteenth, That the Superstition occasioned by this bowing cannot abolish
it.

His Twentyeth, That this bowing, as it may be superstitiously used, so it may
be irreligiously neglected too.

For the two first of these his Mistakes they are directly Fathers, who make
the ^ame here given to Christ, above every name, to be no other, but the name
God, and that in truth and reality, not mere appellation, as Verse 6. Who being
in the form of GOD, thought it not robbery TO BE EQUAL WITH GOD, compared with
Verse 11. That every Tongue should confess that Jesus CHRIST is LORD to (or
in) the glory of GOD THE FATHER, intimate. Witness likewise their ensuing
Authorities.

omne nomen, etc. Videtur ergo donum Patris, hoc est esse Filium, and nomen ejus
super omne nomen sit, hoc est, ess^ Deum. Nomen enim Dei; sed per naturam, non
per solam appellation^m ^uper omne nomen est. Hinc est, ut in nomine I^su omne
genu flictatur coelestium, terrestrium, and in^^rn^r^m; Sicut ad Romanos
significat inter caete^a dicens. Ex quibus Christus secundum carnem, and super
omnia benedictus Deus in saecula, etc. Consideremus dicta, sic advertamus vim
locutionis. Certe nomen quod super omne nomen est DEI NOMEN EST. Sed si per
naturam non constat hoc nomen* non est super omne nomen. Appellativum enim
nomen in solo vocabulo est, non in nobilitate naturae. Et adoptivo Deo non
flectit creatura genu, sed vero, non concraeaturae. Et quomodo fieri potest
homo sit in gloria Dei Patris? non potest esse, nam ei hoc competit qui natus
est ex Deo. In gloria enim Dei Patris ^sse, nihil differ a Deo est, ut una
gloria sit Patris and Filii per communem substantiam and virtutem, etc. With
whom Johannes Salisburiensis in Phil. 2.9, 10. Ms. in Bibl. Bodliana, accord.

etc. Et dedit illi nomen quod est super omne nomen, thus expounds it, Ut
scilicet ab omnibus nominetur Deus, and omnes ei reverenti^m exhibeant sicut
Deo: Et hoc est quod subditur, ut in nomine Jesus omne genu flectatur
Coelestium, Terrestrium, and In ^^norum.

Alexander Alensis, Theologiae Summa pars 1. Quaest. 21^ Membr. 1. Artic. 4.
thus interprets, Dedit illi nomen quod est super omne nomen, etc. ut quod Deus
dare, sit manifestare, pa^et; nomen quod est super omne nomen, id est
Honorificentiam quod vocatur Deus. Chytraeus Postill. in Dominica Palmarum, and
Zanchius in Phil. 2.9, 10 with other Protestants, conclude, the name here meant
to be GOD essentially; and the Bishops own words, Accepit ut homo quod habebat
VT DEVS, admit it for truth. And that it is so, seems past all controversy, if
we compare this Text with Isaiah 45.23. and Romans 14.11, 12. from whence it is
taken, As I live says the LORD, every Knee shall bow TO ME, and every Tongue
shall confess TO GOD; So then every one of us shall give an account of himself
TO GOD: If then the name above every name be GOD, not JESUS, as all these
define against Bishop Andrews, how is his bowing to the name Jesus only, not to
his name God, a duty of this Text? and his that all Ancients thus interpret it,
true?

Other Fathers and Authors interpret this name above all names, to be the
natural only begotten Son of God, agreeing in substance with the former. Thus
Hierom, Theodoret, Sedulius, Remigius, Beda, Haymo, Theophilact, Anselme,
Oecumenius, Musculus, Aretius, Zanchius on Phil. 2.9.10. Sancti Procli. Sermo
in Transfig. Christi Bibl. Patr. Tom. 5. pars 1. p. 536. C. ^^^eriis and Beatis

2. Basil. De spiritu Sancto, c 8. Tom. 1. p. 180. with sundry more resolve.

Others take this name to be the Glory, Majesty, and Power of Christ. So
Chrysostom, in Phil. 2. Hom. 7. Theodoret, in Phil. 2. Petrus Blesensis, Sermo
46. Bibl. Patr. Tom. 12. pars 2. p. 907. with whom some modern Commentators
accord.

Others expound it of the very name Jesus, only by way of Analogy, or
Rhetorical flourish. So Origin Hom. 1. super Jesum Navae, Tom. 1. fol. 149. F.
Chrysologus Sermo 144, 145. Remigius and Haymo in Phil. 2*9, 10. Isychius in

l. 2. Col 810 B. C. D. But yet none of all these speak a word of any bowing to,
or at this name when read, mentioned, heard, or seen, the chief thing in
debate, which the Bishop endeavors to prove and enforce.

Some others assert this name to be the name Christ; as Paschatius R^tbertus,
Expositio in Psalm. 44. p. 1246. G. Paulinus Epistola ad Augustinum, Bibl. Patr.
Tom. 5. pars 1. p. 210. which verse 11. That every tongue should confess that
Jesus CHRIST is Lord, etc. seems to imply.

Others interpret this name, not to be any particular Title, but the very
Person of Christ himself. So Brentius in Phil^ 2*9, 10. Hence Hierom Comment.

Others interpret this name to be LORD (the usual name of God) of which at
large before, Section 1.

That Jesus is the name of God, and the chiefest name of God. I answer, That
though God the Father, and the Trinity in unity be styled Savior in the
Scripture, as Isay 43.11. I am, and besides me there is no V. 10. Before me
the^e is no GOD formed, etc V. 12. Therefore ^e are my Witn^sses that I am GOD
^recede and foll^w, Besides me there is no Savior.
Savior (the place which the Bishop quoteth) 2 Samuel 22.2, 3. Psalm 106.21. Isay
45.15, 21. c. 49.26. c. 60.16. Jer. 14.7, 8 Hosea 13.4. Luke 47. 1 Timothy 1.1. c.
2.3. c. 4.10. Tit. 1.3. c. 3.4, 5, 6. Jude 25. To the only wise God OUR
SAVIOR, be Glory and M^j^sty, Domini^n and Power, now and ever Amen. Yet we
^ead not in all the Scriptu^e that God the Father was ever called Jesus, nor
yet that the Trinity in unity, or Deity it self is styled by this Name. Now
Jesus and Savior though they accord in signification, yet they differ in this.
1. In Time and Antiquity, Savior being used in the Old Testament, long before
Christ's incarnation and Nativity; Jesus was imposed on him after his
Incarnation, Matthew 1.21, 24. Luke ^.31. c. 2 21. 2ly. One of them is a Title
of Office or Honor, accruing from some gracious del^ve^ance, the other a
proper personal Name imposed on our Savior at his Circumcision (as our Names
in Baptism a^e) to distinguish him from other men^ 3ly. They differ in Ph^ases
and Words, Jesus and Soter; Jesus and S^rvator; Jesus and Savior. The words
are different, and diff^^ently used in all Lang^ages; and that they vary from
each other, the very usual phrases in Scripture ( Jesus Act^ 1^ 23. Phil. 3.20.
2 ^im. 1.10. Tit. 1.3.4 c 2.13 c ^ 6. 2 Pet 1.1, 11. ^ 2. ^^ c. ^.18
Christ, our Savior; a Savior, which is Christ the Lord; our Savior Jesus,
etc. coupled o^t together) testify; For if they were Synonimaes it would be a
kind of Tautology. And if they are both one and the same, then all men should
and would cap and bow to both of them alike, especially since Bishop Andrews
tells us, that Savior is the name above every name, etc. in this Text, and one
of Alcuinus contra Felicem Vrgel. l. 2.
GODS own NAMES. And if Savior be the Name, then all must cap and bow to it as
well as to the name Jesus; and that, when it is spoken or intended of God in
the Trinity, or of God the Father as well of Jesus his only Son, which none now
practice, neither does the Bishop here urge them to it.

Again, as Jesus is not the name of God the Father, or of the Deity; so it
denotes most properly and immediately naught else but the Sea Mat. 1^ 21.25.
Luke 1.31. c. 2.21.
humanity of our Savior; it being a name imposed on him as Man at his
Circumcision; rather to difference him from other men, than from the other
Persons of the Trinity; whence Expo^it. etc. in Mat. c. 1^ Tom. 5.^ p. 1.
Beda, Anselme, Divinis Officiis, c. 4. n. col^ 1147.
Alcuinus, Aquinas, and others conclude; Jesus est proprium nomen assumptae
carnis, and Hoc nomen Jesus significat solam naturam humanam; not the Deity or
Divine Nature of Christ, as this Bishop mistakes.

For the Fourth, That this Text enjoynes men to bow but TO the very name of
Jesus, and to this name only. It is certainly a gross Mistake; for first the
words are, (...), In nomine, not Ad nomen; In the name, not At or To to the
name, as the Here p. 2, 3, 4.
ancient English Translation^ of Trevisa, Tyndal, Co^erdale, Matthews, the
Epistles and Gosples printed in English at Paris, 1558. the Common-Prayer-books
of Edward the 6th. Queen Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles, (till altered
of late by Doctor Cosens) in the Epistle on Palm Sunday, Bishop Alley, the
Bishops Bible, Dr. Fulk, Mr. Cartwright, Bishop Jewel, and all our ancient
English Writers who cite it, read it. Now ^o bow in the name, and to bow to the
name of Jesus, are two different things of various natures; Therefore this
Injunction to bow in the name is no warrant for any to bow to the name of
Jesus, which this Text requires not.

2ly. This bowing to the name of Jesus, as a divine worship, adoration and duty
of the Text, is as great Idolatry as to adore and bow to his Cross, Picture,
Body, or consecrated Bread in the Sacrament, etc. which we See Dr^ Fulk, Mr.
Ca^tw^ight, Dr. Willet, Bp. Jewel Bp Morton and others.
all cond^mn in Papists; yea, it makes our bowing at to be really TO the name
of Jesus, and the very same with that of the Papist^, which our See here. p.
30, to 48.
Protestants condemn as Superstitious and Idolatrous in them.

3ly. The fore-alleged Fathers and Authorities prove, That the name Jesus is
not the name above every name intended in this text; therefore there is no
ground to bow to it, and it alone.

4ly. Cyrillus Alexandrinus in Hesaiam lib. 5. cap. 55. Tom. 1. p. 262. ^. In
^ohannis Evangelium, l. 11. c. 17. p. 666 A. De Incarnatione Unigeniti, cap.
11. Tom. 1.2. p. 114. E. and Dialogus de T^initate, l. 3. p. 270. A. reads it
thu^. ^t dedit illi nomen quod est super omne nomen, ut in nomine I^su Christi
omne genu s^ flectat, joining the name Christ with Jesus. Synodus Franco^urdiae
ad Menam habita, sub Adriano Papa 1. thus, Cessate cum adoptivum nominare, qui
verus Deus, and verus Dei Filius, in cujus nomine omne genu fl^ctatur
coelestium, terrestrium, and infernorum. Dionysius Alexandrinus, Epistola
contra Paulum Samosa^ensem, thus. Propter quod D^us exaltavit illum, and
donavit illi nomen quod est super omne nomen; ut in nomine ejus omne genu
fl^ctatur, etc. Ar^obius, Comment. in Psalm. 88. ^hu^, Ego Primogenitum ponam
eum, ut in nomine ejus omne genu fl^ctatur, etc. Angelomus in hi^ Str^mata in
libr. Regum 3. cap 8 thus. Christo enim propter glor^fae m^ritum Pas^^onis
datum est nomen, ut in nomine e^us omne genu flectatur, coeles^ium,
terrestrium, and inf^rn^rum. P^schatius Rat^ertus, in Mat. Evang. l. 10. thus.
Et donavit illi nomen quod est super omne nomen, ut in nomin^ D^mini omne genu
flectatur ^oel^stium, t^rrestrium, and in^^rn^rum. Attributing this bowing of
every knee, not at all to the Name, but Person, Deity of Christ expressed,
represented by any name, as Isay 45.23. Romans 14.9, 10, 11, 12. expressly do,
Every Knee shall bow TO ME, etc.

For the Fifth, That Christ has taken his Person out Jesus behind to us, that
we may show by our reverence and respect unto it, how much we est^em him, etc.
As it abstracts and severs Christ's Person from his Name, and contradicts Mat.
28.20. And ^o I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS EVEN UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD; so it makes
much for, and directly justifies the Papist^ Adoration of their Hostia, Images,
Crosses, and the Name Jesus See Sect. 3.
carved, written, painted, or printed in a Book, Wall, Frontispiece of a
Jesuits Works, or under or over a Crucifix, as well as to his Name, when
barely pronounced. At the sight of which Name, n^ Prelates, nor Protestants,
and I think few Papists usually bow.

2ly. It is not, yea cannot be grounded on that Text of Psalm 111.9. (Holy and
reverend is his name) quoted by the Bishop to warrant it; That name being only
the glorious name of LORD, there attributed to God himself, as i^ evident by
Verse. 1, 2.11. etc. by sundry Deuteronomy. 28.58. Ps. 72.18, 19. Ps 99.3. Isay 57.15
Jer 10. ^ c. 44.26. Ezekiel 39.1, 7^ 25. Mal 1.11^ 14 c. 2.2, ^.
parallel Texts of Scripture, and the words themselves, which are spoken in the
Present, not Future Tense, H^ly and reverend IS his Name. Now this Name Jesus
wa^ then neither holy nor reverend, because then not known, nor given to, or
imposed on our Savior Christ as God and Man; Therefore it could not be the
Name which the Psalmist writes of.

3ly. Christ has left behind him all his other Names, as Emanuel, God, Son of
God, Lamb of God, Lord, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, King of Saints, Head of
the Church, chi^f Shepherd of the sheep, God, etc. as well as this, he has
not carried them, or any of them quite away to Heaven with him, and left Jesus
alone behind him on Earth; Therefore we should either reverence, bow to them or
him, in and by them all alike, if this Reason proves good; or else give no
special adoration, bowing, or reverence unto this Name Jesus alone, since we do
it not to any of the rest, he left behind him.

Text are so plain, as they are able to convince any man's conscience, that he
ought to bow to the name of Jesus, when recited or uttered in the Church. It is
an experimental untruth; We see they convince not the consciences of most men
now; They convinced not the Consciences of any of the Fathers, primitive
Churches, Christians, ancient Expositors, or modern Protestant Commentators on
this Text heretofore, nor any foreign Protestant Churches at this day; Neither
are they (I dare confidently a ver it) sufficient to convince any intelligent
Christians conscience, upon due examination, now, That this bowing at, or to
the name of Jesus only, which the Bishop only contends for, is a duty of this
Text; there being nothing either in the sense, or words, that can manifest it
to be a Duty upon evident and infallible grounds, though all acknowledge that
the same subjection, adoration, prayer, and divine worship are due to Christ as
are to God the Father, and to the holy Ghost, but no other.

That there is no Writer of the Ancients on this place (except Origin) but does
literally understand it, and likes well, that we should actually perform this
Bowing now contested for. If we take it absolutely in it self, it is a most
apparent untruth, since not one of the ancient Fathers or Expositors extant in
P^int or Manuscripts has so expounded it, or made any mention of this duty:
But if we take his words as he has qualified them, (And there is no Writer, no
not of the Ancients, on this place, that I can find, etc.) We must either
conclude, That the Bishop, though very learned, never sought after any Antient^
Writers on this place; or at least, That he never found out any, or mistook
their words or meaning, since there is not one of them extant that ever gave
this his exposition of them.

For the Eighth, That Ambrose, Hierom, Cyrill, and Theodoret, (the only
Ancients he mentions, in the places barely quoted in his Margent, not reciting
their words at large) concur in judgment with him, in this kind of bowing at,
or to his name, and thus understand this Text: It will appear far otherwise, if
we survey their words. Hexam. ^on, l. 6. c.
St. Ambrose his words are these. Quid de Officio pedum loquar, qui totum
corpus sine ulla sustinent o^eris injuria? Flexibile genu quo prae caeteris
Domini mitigatur offensa, ira mulcetur, gracia provocatur. Hoc enim Patris
summi erga Filium donum est, ut in nomine Jesus omne genu curvetur, Coelestium,
Terrestrium, and Infernorum, and omnium lingu^ confit^atur, quoniam Dominu^
Jesus, in gloria est Dei Patris. Duo enim sunt quae prae caeteris Deum mulcent,
humilitas and fides* Pes itaque exprimit humilitatis affectum, and sedulae
servitutis obsequium: Which place desciphering only the principal uses and
offices of the feet, vizt. to appease the Lords wrath, and procure Gods favor
by bending the knee to him, (not Jesus) in the affection of humility, by Humble
Prayer in the name of Christ, and diligent service and obedience, makes nothing
at all for genu-flections, or bowings to, or at every recital of the name
Jesus, (not here mentioned by Ambrose) much less when we are on our knees
praying to him, when some superstitiously bow down their heads to and at this
name. Neither does St. Ambrose in his Commentary on Phil. 2.9, 10. or in any
other place of his works, where he dilates upon it, make any such literal
Exposition of this Text, or name as is pretended, so as his Quotation is
impertinent.

Comment. in Isai^m, l 1^. c. 45.
St. Hieromes alleged authority, is far more impertinent to his purpose. His
words are these. Mihi incur vabitur omne genu, and jurabit and confitebitur
omnis lingua Deo. On which words of Isaiah he thus descants. Sed and hoc jurat,
quod idolis derelictis omne genu ei flectatur Coelestium, Terrestrium, and
In^ernorum, and omnis per illum juret lingua mortalium: in quo perspicue
significatur, populus Christianus: Moris est enim Ecclesiastici CHRISTO g^nu
flectere Quod Iudaei mentis superbiam demonstrantes, omnino non ^aciunt. Sed
and omnis lingua cunctarum gentium Barbararum, non in Synagogis, sed in Christi
Ecclesiis consitetur De^m, etc. In all which passages, 1. The name Jesus is not
so much as once mentioned, much less is there any intimation of bowing to it,
when recited. 2ly. All the Argument the Bishop can hence collect, is but this.
It is an Ecclesiastical custom for Christians to pray kneeling, or bow their
knees to CHRIST, (not JESUS) in their public and private Prayers; Ergo it was
then an Ecclesiastical custom to bow the knee to and at the ^ecital of the name
of Jesus only, but not to or at the name of Christ; whereas the contrary would
better follow: Ergo it was then an Ecclesiastical use for Christians to bow
their knees at, to the name of Christ, not to or at the name of Jesus, which
refutes all his reasons and Arguments to the contrary. 3ly. Hi^ Text is only
Omne genu El fl^ctatur, and moris est Ecclesiastici, Christo genu flectere^
not, ad nomen Jesus, or in nomine Jesus, or Christi: This Father he^e speaks only
of the Person, not of the name of Christ, or Jesus: Therefore he gives no
color at all for any bowing to or at the name of Jesus, as the Bishop
suggests, punctually against his words.

For In Hesaiam, l. 4. c. 45. Orat. 3.
St. Cyrills authority, it is only this. Quid est igitur quod annunciatum est?
Salus and conversio omnium ^bique gentium: Mihi enim inquit, flect^t se omne
genu, and jurabit omnis lingua p^r Deum. Flectet se genu Deo, and nomen ejus ab
omnibus in juramento adhibebitur, quid aliud signi^i at, quam omnium
conversionem and agnitionem and co^junctionis cum ipso patefactionem? Qui enim
per conversionem ad Deum redeu^t, prorsus nec genu immundis spiritibus
flectunt, n^que lingua illos ut Deos circumferunt. Non enim per ullum aliquem
jurabunt tanquam per Deum sed unum natura and vere esse cognoscentes ejus jugo
cervic^m supponunt and genu flunctunt; and si legitime jurare velint, ejus
solius m^ntionem ^aciunt. Where observe, 1. That in all this quotation, the
word or name JESUS is not so much as once mentioned, much less any bowing to
or at his name Jesus. 2ly That the name and person only of God is mentioned, to
whom all Nations leaving their unclean spirits, Idols, should in time be
conve^ted, submit themselves, adore and swear by his name alone. Ergo it is a
duty of the Text, for all to bow at every recital of the name Jesus, (not here
mentioned) is a very Un-episcopal inferrence from this Fathers passage.

In Phil 2.9, 10, 11.
Theodorets words are as little to the purpose. Et donavit illi Nomen quod est
sup^r omne nomen, etc. Non ergo ea accepit quae non prius habebat; sed accepit
ut homo quae habebat ut D^us. Nomen autom quidam interpraetati sunt gloriam.
Ego autem Ex ^pistola ad Hebraeos invenio aliam Apostolici dicti
intelligentiam: Cum enim dixisset, Heb. 1. Psalm. 2. 2 Reg. 2.
Sedet ad dextram Majestatis in excelsis, tanto melior Angelis effectus, quanto
excellentius p^ae illis nomen haeredita vit, interpraetatur nominis
differentiam, and dicit: Cui enim dixit aliquando Angelorum, Filius meus es tu,
ego hodie genui te? Et rursus; Ego ero illi in patrem, and ille erit mihi in
Filium? Hic ergo hoc etiam dicit, quod eum seipsum humiliavit, non solum non
p^r didit quod habebat ut Deus, sed hoc etiam accepit ut homo. Vt in nomine
Jesus omne genu flectatur Coelesti^m, Terrestrium, and In^ernorum. Coelestes
appellat pot^states, quae sub ^^^p^ctum non cadunt; T^rr^stres autem, homines
qui ad huc vivunt; (...) autem* h^c est, eos qui sunt sub terris, illos qui
sunt mortui. If then this name above every name, etc be not the name Jesus, but
this name, the only begotten Son of God, (as Theodoret expressly concludes
from St. Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews) then here is no warrant for any bowing
to or at the name of Je^us, or to or at this name alone^ or at every ^ecital of
it, in these words of his. So that these four Fathers are all point blank
against (not for) the Bishop^ Exposition in the least degree, who therefore
cau^elo^sly concealed what they writ, here truly and fully cited.

That there want not Reasons why we should rather bow TO the name of Jesus than
of Christ. I answer, that there can be no Reasons alleged for it out of
Scripture, neither has this Bishop, nor any other yet produced any reasons of
this kind; What reasons therefore he or others have coined out of their own
working Brayns, Fancies either without or against the Scripture, Why men should
bow to or at the name of Jesus, not to or at the name Christ, are not worthy
the name of Reasons; And if the Bishops Reasons here produced be well examined,
we shall find them both unreasonable and untrue, if not absurd, making wholly
against his Conclusions, nothing for them, As the ensuing particulars will
manifest.

Christ, is this, Because Christ is not, yea cannot be the name of God; For God
cannot be anointed. In which there are two most gross mistakes. First, That
Christ is not, yea cannot be the name of God. Secondly, That God cannot be
anointed. The first of these is directly contrary, 1. to Athanasius his Creed,
where it is twice repeated, So God and Man is one Christ. 2ly. to the 2d.
Article of the Church of England, and the 29th. of Ireland, which thus resolve.
The Godbead and Manhood were joined together in one Person, never to be
divided, WHEREOF IS ONE CHRIST, VERY GOD AND VERY MAN. 3ly. To express
Scripture, Romans 9.5. Of whom as concerning the Flesh Christ came, who is over
all, GOD BLESSED FOR EVER. 4ly. To all ancient and modern Writers, who thus
conclude, and positively affirm against the Arrians, Aleuinus c^nt^a Feli^em
Vr^el. ep. lib. 2. col. 106, to 810. and Proclus. Cassianus, with others cited
by him, and lib 3.
Christus est Deus, That Christ is God, and that Christ is both God and Man;
Which Propositions were false, if Christ were not the name of God. Certainly
Christ is the name of the Son of God, of the second Person in the sacred
Trinity: All Christians are to Gal 3.27, 29. c. 2.17.20, 21.

John 14.2.
baptized into Christ, and in the name of Christ; yea they are named Christians
from the name of Christ, not Jesuits, as the Jesuits name themselves from his
name Jesus. Therefore Christ certainly is the name of God, and of our Saviors
Divinity, as well as of his Humanity.

This verily Iraeneus testified of old, Adversu^ Haereses, l. 3. c. 20. p. 333.
In Christi ^. nomine, subauditur, qui unxit, and ipse qui unctus est; and ipsa
unc^io in qua unc^us est. Et unxit quidem Pater: Vnctus vero est Filius, in
Spiritu qui est unctio, quemadmodum per Isaiam; Sermo. Spiritus Dei super me,
propter quod unxit me; significans and unguentem Patrem, and unctum Filium, and
unctionem qui est Spiritus. The name therefore of Christ (in Irenaeus his
Divinity) takes in the whole three Persons of the Trinity, and so is the name
of God in his repute. This was Athanasius his Assertion in his Declaration,
Quod Christus sit ve^us Deus, etc. p. 371. C. D. At qua ratione possit Christus
vocari Christus, si nudus homo sit? contra idem ille si verbo coadunitus sit
merito ponuntur Christus and Dei Filius, jam olim Propbetam paternam in ^o
substantiam his verbi^ protestantem; and emittam Filium m^um Christum, etc.
Missionem autem and declarationem idem esse cum unctione frequenter inveuiemus,
etc. The same we shall find in Damascen, At nos Christum haud quaquam unius
compositae nature esse ass^rimus, etc. Christi porro vocabulum personae ess^
dicimus, ut quod unimodo vocatur, sed duplic^m naturam significet. Ipse e^enim
s^ipsum unxit, corpus videlicet divinitate unguens ut Deus, unctus autem ut
homo, quandoquidem ille ^^e and illud est; unctio porro humanitatis ^st
divinitas. And Euchfoneus in his Commentary, Ibid. ^. 266. D. Sanctorum Patrum
concordi sententia. Chri^^us ^omen Hypo^^aseos est, and personae duarum
natur^rum ^^gnificativum, divinae scilicet and humanae: Hinc Christus neque
solam humanitatem, sed utramque ^arum i^ unica persona hypostatice unitam.
Idcirco dicit liter^, nomen Christus non est unimode dictum, id est, de un^
na^ura. Neque ^. id nomen Christus de s^la dicitur nature divina, neque solam
notat humanam naturam, sed utramque simul in uno supposito unitam. Nam ipse
Christus est, hoc est illud, u^pote Homo and Deus, Nota.
prout nomen illud singulariter, and unice Domino nostro attribuitur,
Significa^que ipsunt unctum excellentissima and divina unctione, carnent
scilicet-ejus sacrosanctam Di^tatis ol^o ineffabiliter per^usam; quae s^ne
super-divina est unctio and sol^ Domino nostro congruens. In qua, Divinitas est
ungens; and sacratissima Christi humanitas unctum, ipsa quoque divinitas unctio
est, et ejus humanitas quod ungitur. With which the Resolution of Aquinas, and
others accords.

That God cannot be anointed: It is most ^alse; For God the Father anointed
God the Son, with God the Holy Ghost, witness P^al 45.6, 7* and Hebr. 1.8, 9.
Thy Throne (O God) is for ever and ever, the Scepter of thy Kingdom is a right
Scepter. Thou love righteousness and hate wickedness, therefore God, thy
God has anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness above thy Fellows Thus the
Fathers from these Texts inferred, resolved long ago, 1 Athanasius, 2. Hilarie,
3. Ambrose, 4. Augustine, 5 Primasius and others 6. Cyrillus Alexandrinus, 7.
Venerable Beda, 8 Isychius, 9. Paschatius Ratbertus.

1. O^thodox Athanasius, Contr. A^ianos, l. 2. p. 80. A. B. C. N^n ^n dixit,
ideo unxit te, ut Deus, aut Rex, aut Filius, aut verbum fieres, nam and antea
hoc ipsum erat, semperque est, sed potius prop^erea, quia and Deus, and Rex es,
ideo inunctus e^. Non n. alterius erat conjungere hominem cum Spiritu Sancto,
quam tui ipsius qui es imago Patris, ad quam ab ini^io creati eramus, quoniam
tuus est Spiritus. Caeterum, quia Deus est, quia Rex aeternus, and splendour,
and character Pat^is, ideo ipse est qui expect^ batur Christus, etc. Quid
igitu^ miri a^t qui^ in^redibile, si Dominus qui Spiritus, ipse nun^ dicitur,
Spiritu injungi?

2. St* Hilarie De Trinitate, l. 4. p. 21. F G. thus seconds him, Ait^n in
Psalmi^, Vnxit t^ De^s, Deus tuus, Discernat legentis intelligentia unctum and
ungentem; distingue te and tuus; ad quem and qui sit sermo demonstrat.
Superioribus, n^dictis hic confessionis ordo subjectus est. Dixerat namque,
Seeds tua Deus in saeculum saeculi, virga directionis tuae virga regni tui,
dilexisti justitiam and odisti iniquitatem, ^unc quoque his adjecit, propterea
^nxit te Deus D^us t^us. Deus ergo Regni aeterni ob meritum dilectae justitiae
and perosae iniquitatis a Deo suo unctus est. Nunquid intelligentiam nostram
aliqua saltem nominum intervalla confundit. Nam discretio tantum Personae in te
and tuus, posita est, in nullo ^amen natu^ae distincta confession^. Tuus enim
rela^ivum est ad autorem, and vero ad ejus qui ex autore est significationem.
Est enim Deus ex Deo, Prop^eta eodem ordine confitente; U^xit te Deus, Deus
tuus, etc.

3. St. Ambrose De Fide l. 1 c. 2. adds his suffrage to the former, Denique
habes in Psalmo quadrag^simo quart^, quod and Deum Patrem, dicit Propheta, and
Deum Filium declaravit, dicens; Seeds tua Deus in seculum seculi; and infra,
unxit te Deus, Deus tuus oleo laetitiae prae consortibus tuis: Deus est qui
ungit, et Deus qui secundum carnem ungitur, Deus Filius: Denique quos habet
unctionis suoe Christus nisi in carne consortes? Vide igitur qui^ Deus a Deo
unctus, etc.

4. St. Augustine proves it is most fully and punctually in Psalm. 44. Euarratio.
Propterea unxit te Deus, Deus tuus. Et vide quomodo ait, Propterea unxit te
Deus, Deus tuus. DEUS UNGITUR A DEO. Etenim in Latino putat idem casus nominis
repetitus. In Greco autem evidentissima distinctio est, quia unum nomen est
quod compellatur, and alterum ab illo qui compellat. Unxit te Deus, O tu Deus,
unxit te Deus tuus; quomodo, si diceret, Propterea unxit te O tu Deus, Deus
tuus. Sic accipite, sic intelligite, sic in Graeco evidentissimum est. Ergo
quis est De^s unctus a Deo? dic^nt nobis Judaei. Scripturae ipsae communes
sunt. Unctus est Deus a Deo, unctum audis, Christum intellige, etenim Christus
a Chrismate. Hoc nomen quod appellatur Christus, unctionis est, nec in aliquo
alibi ungebantur Reges and Sacerdotes nisi in illo regno, ubi Christus
prophetabatur and ungebatur, and unde vent^rum erat Christi nomen. Nusquam est
alibi omnino in ulla gente, in ullo regno. Unctus est ergo Deus a Deo. Quo
oleo, nisi spirituali? Oleum n. visibile in signo est, O^eum invisibile in
Sacramento est. Oleum Spirituale intus est, Oleum visibile exterius est; Unctus
est nobis Deus et missus est nobis, et ipse Deus ut ungeretur homo erat, ut
Deus esset, ita Deus erat, ut homo esse ^on dedignaretur. Uerus homo, verus
Deus, in nullo fallax, in nullo falsus, quia ubique verax, ubique veritas. Deus
ergo homo, et ideo unctus Deus, quia homo Deus et factus est Christus. The like
he asserts Tract 7. in Evangelium secundum Iohannem, Se^mo. ^. and in Ma^^m. l

5. So Primasius, Remigius, Haymo, Anselme, Theophilact, Oecumenius on Heb.

that God the Son is anointed by God the Father, with God the Holy Ghost.

8. Isycbius in Levit. cap. 8. concludes. Neque Christi Divinitas post

9. Paschasius Rathertus Exposie. in Psalm. 44. sings the same tune. Quid

id est, Filius a Patre: Non enim intelligentiam nostram aliquod confundit

videlicet, te and tuus; Non quod natura distinguatur deit^tis, cum dicitur,

ostenditur una natura, una deitas, quia ille Deus qui ungitur ab ^o Deo est qui
ungit; Et (...) Deus a Deo est, nihil aliud quam Deus est: Propheta eo ordine
narrante, Unxit te Deus Deus tu^s^ etc. What more punctual then ^ll these

God the Son was not, yea cannot be anointed? I could add a whole Grand ^ury

V^sinus. Vnctio enim est, non tam d^norum acceptio, quae competit soli
humanitati, sed and ordinatio ad officium M^diatoris, ^^ae competit et^am

non sequitur exclu^^o Divinitatis ab unctione, quatenus est designatio ad
officium, etc. Of which you may read much more there to the like effect.

And here we will next examine the Bishops Argument, Ergo to it we must not bow.

The Major is the Bishops own reason, words; The Minor is already proved. And
it may thus be evinced by his own reason last refuted. That name which is
ascribed to Christ, who is, and as he is anointed, is not the name of God: For
God (as the Bishop averrs and resolves) c^nnot be anointed. But the name Jesus
is ascribed to Christ, who is, and as he is anointed, witness Acts 4.26, 27.
For of a truth against thy holy Child JESUS, whom thou have anointed, both
Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Is^ael, were
gathered together. And Acts 10.38. God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the
Holy Ghost, and with power: Therefore we must not bow at or to the name of
Jesus, because it is not the name of G^d, since both the^e Texts resolve that
God anointed JESUS.

Invert we now the Argument against this Bishop, and then see what conclusion
follows. That name which is the name of God, ^o and at that name we ought to
bow: So the Bishop argues. But the name of Christ, as I have proved,
(especially the names God, Jehovah, Lord, Emanuell, Spirit, Father, Holy Ghost,
etc.) are the names of God: Ergo to and at them and every of them we ought to
bow. Again, Every name receives its dignity from the Person who^e name it is:
So the Bishop. But every of these names of our blessed Savior, is the name of
that Person who is God as well as Man. Therefore to and at every o^ these his
names we ought to bow, and not at his name Jesus only, which principally
denotes his humanity.

That the name Christ was comunicated by God to others, but the name Jesus not,
for that is proper. It contains a double Falsehood. For First, We re^d of no man
or person who is styled Christ, or The Christ, or Jesus Christ, in Scripture,
but only our Savior Christ; Neither find we this single title Christ, in our
English or Latin Translations, applied ^o any but ou^ Savior; Nor yet the
title of M^ss^as, but to our anointed Lord and Savior alone, who was
anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows. Yea although that ancient
Kings, Prists, and Prophets, might be called Christi, because anointed; yet
none of them all were so anointed as the Lord Christ. For they were anointed
with some graces only, in a measure, but Christ had the oil of all graces,
without measure* They were anointed some as King and Priest only, as
Melchis^dech; some a^ King and Prophet only, as David, some as Priest and
Prophet, as Samuel, but Christ only and alone was anointed as King, Priest,
and Prophet; they all only with oil; He with the D^^^y it self: so as the name
Christ in this respect was peculiar to Christ alone. Thus he was anointed
above his Fellows; so as the name^ Christ is as (yea more) proper to him, as
the name Jesus, which meets with the next Argument of the Bishop. The name
Jesus was comunicated to Ios^ah, and diverse othe^s beside and before Christ,
not appropriated to our Savior only. ^hi^ the Bishop confesses himself for a
truth, which is evident by Hebrews 4.8 Acts 7.45. Collossi^ns 4.11. Wherefore I
shall thus reto^t this hi^ p^ime A^gument against himself. That name of Christ
which was comunicated to others by God in Sc^ipture, at and to that we must not
bow. But this name Jesus was communicated to others by God in Scripture: Ergo,
at and to it we must not bow. Again, That name which is proper to our Savior
only, at and to i^ we ought to bow^ So the Bishop. But the names of Christ,
Messiah, Emanuell, Lamb of God, only begotten Son of God, etc. are proper only
to our Savior, and not comunicated unto others, Ergo at and to them we ought
to bow, and not at or to his name Jesus. Moreover,

That name which is prop^r, as the name of Jesus is, above that which is
common, and to be bowed to. But^ the name Christ is as, ^ea more proper him as
his name Jesus* for he was Psalm. 45.7. Hebr 1.8. an^ all Commentators ^n them.
anointed above his Fellows: Ergo to be bowed to as well as the name Jesus.
Again, If this position of the Bishop be true, mark the inevitable dangerous
consequences, The names Jesus, Christ, Emanuel, Father, Son, Spirit, Word, and
Holy Ghost, are all personal and proper to each person of the Trinity, Ergo
they are all to be bowed to, and above the names Jehovah, God, Lord, and the
like* or the Deity it self, which ^re common to all three persons in the
Trinity; as Athanasius Creed informs us at large. Pretty Divinity for a Bishop
to assert; yea pretty Philosophy, Policy and Morality too; for then it will
follow, Ergo Every man's private Person, Estate, Safety, Welfare is above, and
ought to be preferred before the Republic which is holden in common. Ergo
private Prayers, Ceremonies, Scriptures in an unknown tongue, and private
Masses, (which are proper to Mass Priests, who alone communicate,) are above
public Prayers, Masses, Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, and the Communion
which is equally distributed unto all the Faithful; yea private Conventicles
are above, far better than our public Church assemblies. Such are the
consequences which will follow, from this new Episcopal pa^adox and
ratiocination if admitted orthodox

Christ (says the Bishop) is anointed, To what end? To be our Savior, That
is the end then, And ever the end is above the means: And what else? Ergo,
Jesus is above Christ; the Deity annoynting inferior to the Savior anointed;
and to man's Salvation; and Christ the Head and Savior of his Church and
Members, inferior to his Church, Members who are saved; strange heterodox,
untheological, if not heretical Consequences. To discover falseness, sophisme
of this his illogical reason, we must observe, that Christ's unction was that
which authorized him to be a Savior, without which he had been no Savior. Now
this is a ground in Logic and Philosophy, Quicquid e^ficit tale est magis
tale; et Omni^ causa est dignior suo effec^u; The Kings Power and Authority
which makes a Man a Judge, or Officer, is greater, supremer, than the Judge or
Officer made by him; the Deity of Christ and of the Holy Ghost anointing, is
greater than, is above the Humanity anointed; Therefore in this Case the Deity
annoynting being the means, is better, is greater than the Humanity anointed,
or the end for which it was thus anointed, that he might be a Savior to his
People; God being not only the Alpha but Omega, the end of all his own and our
Works, Actions, Prove. 16.14. Romans 11.36. Revel. 4.11. c. 1.8, 11. c. 21.6. all
which Texts this Bishops Paradox contradicts.

Thirdly, What? to the 2. syllables or sound of them? What If the Name be not
the sound, or syllables, neither does the Bishop speak of them; What means then
his former Reasons, discourses, That we must bow at, and to the name Jesus, and
that Name alone, not to or at the Name Christ? If not at or to the Name, but
the Sense only: Then the Controversy is at an end by his own Confession, and
so all his former discourses of the names Jesus and Christ, are to no purpose
at all. Well, but we must bow to the Sense whenever the Name is mentioned, etc
Excellent Divinity borrowed from the Papists sophistry, who worship the Name
Jesus, the Crucifix, and Pictures of Jesus, the Body of Jesus in the
consecrated Host, Bread, Wafer, Pix, only with reference to his Person; Which
to do (say they) is no Idolatry. Either then the Bishop and his Followers must
approve the Popish Image Worship, Bread-worship, Iesu-worship, which Bp. Jewel
Reply to Harding, Artic. 8. of Adoration. Dr. Reynolds De Idolatria Romanae
Ecclesiae. The Homily of the Peril of Idolatry. Bp. Morton of the Mass.
Protestants condemn as gross Idolatry, or else disclaim this Answer. But
admit that the Name is the sense, not the sound, What (I pray) is the sense of
the Name JESUS to which we must thus frequently bow at every recital of it? Is
it only the Person of Jesus? Then why should we not bow to every of his Names
as well as to this, since each of them represents his Person to us as well as
this? But the Person of our Savior is only the Denominatum, not the sense of
the name Jesus; The sense of this Name is, a Savior, (or rather Acts 4.12.
Neither is there Salvati^n in any other, for the^e is none other name under
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved
Salvation) he b^ing therefore styled Jesus, because he shall save his People
from their sins, Mat. ^.21. Luke 1.31. Well, admit it, Then Savior being the
sense, we must all henceforth bow at and to the name Savior when recited,
rather than the name Jesus. But who thus bows at or to the name Savior, which
is the sense of it? Not one; for none press nor practice it as a duty, no not
the Bishop himself. In a word, Lu. 1.69.77. c. ^.30 c. 3 6. c. ^^ Acts 4 12.
I^de 3 Isay 62.^^. M^. ^ 7. Ps. 62.1, 2, ^.
^alvation, rather than Savior is the sense of this Name, and who ever
worshipped Salvation in the abstract, when Jesus is pronouned, by bowing at and
to the name Jesus?

That this is no taken-up worship, etc. but an Act of Gods own pr^scribing, and
a duty of the Text, directly set down by God himself, I^ but a mere Imposture.
Had it been See Sect. ^.
Popes, and Papists only were so quick-sighted as to be the first De^^^iers of
it, even in times of greatest darkness! For my own part, since this duty was
never discove^ed till of late, and that upon such slender evidence^, reason^
produced by the Bishop, which are sooner answered than propounded, I shall
crave leave to dissent, that it i^ a duty of the Text, till I see clearer
proofs than any yet alleged by this Bishop or hi^ Followers, so much mistaken
in the Premise^. I s^all only add for a close, That if the bowing ^f every
knee, and kneeling at or to the Name Jesus when ever mentioned in the Church,
be a Worship of Gods own prescribing, and a duty of the Text directly enjoined
by God himself, as this Bishop positively concludes, then by the self-same Text
they must likewise kn^el and bow their knees when every tongue confesses that
Jesus Christ is Lord, in or to the glory of God the Father, they being ^oth
coupled together in this Text, and to be performed with one posture of bowing
the knee. Hence we read, Rev. 4.10, 11, 12 c. 7 10, 11^ 12 c. 14.3, to 9. c.
15.3.4^ c. 19.4. That when the 4. Beasts and others, gave glory, and honor, and
thanks, and praise to him that sits on the Throne, and cried, Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come; the 24. Elders,
Angels and others did all fall down on their Faces and Knees before him that
sat on the Throne, and worshipped him that lives for ever and ever, casting
their Crowns before the Throne, and saying, Thou art worthy O Lord to receive
Glory, Honor, Power and Blessing, for thou ^ast created all things; Blessing,
and Glory, and Wisdom, and Thanksgiving, and Honor, and Power, and Might be
unto our God for ever and ever, Amen. The same in substance with Gloria Patri,
etc. And at the Communion when the Minister and People say, Almighty and
everlasting God, etc. through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee (O
Father) and the holy Ghost be all honor, and glory world without end, Amen. O
Lord and heavenly Father, etc. through Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom, and with
whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, all glory and honor be unto thee O
Father Almighty, world without end, Amen. Glory be to God on high, etc. We
praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we give thanks unto thee for thy
great GLORY, O Lord God, heavenly King; God the Father Almighty. O Lord the
only begotten Son Jesus Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,
etc. have mercy upon us. For thou only art holy, thou only art the Lord; thou
only O Christ, with the Holy Ghost art most high in the glory of Glory of God
the Father, Amen. (the same with Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. and Gloria Patri in effect,
if not in words.) They all use and are enjoined by Rubricks to kneel down on
their Knees, and repeat these Prayers, Thanksgivings kneeling In all which
over-zealous bowers at the name of Jesus, usually bow their heads, bodies,
whiles kneeling on their knees, when the name Jesus is mentioned only, not at
any other of his names coupled with it, nor at, to the names of the Father and
Holy ghost rehearsed with it. With what color of Scripture, ^ence, reason do or
can they then practice themselves, or prescribe to other Ministers and all the
People, by N^w Rubricks, not jointly to bow their Knees, or kneel and ^all down
on them; but quite contrary, to rise up all together from their very Knees and
Seats, and (...), p 126.

then falling, kneeling down to, before them, in the use and recital of those
other Praises, Prayers, Doxologies, and at the Eucharist, (quite contrary to,
and inconsistent with standing up, and bowing to the name of Jesus only when
all three Persons are jointly mentioned, worshipped, glorified, praised,
adored, can be no worship of Gods own prescribing, nor duty of the Text. Either
therefore they must henceforth disclaim their bowing at the Name jesus, and
kneeling at the recited Prayers, Doxologies and Lords Supper; or else bow and
fall down, upon their Knees, Faces; not stand up at Gloria Patri for the
future, to reconcile these contradictory ge^tures, usages, prescriptions
resuting, subverting one the other.

That the Brazen Serpent it self was a taken-up worship, (as the Bishops words
imply) is a manifest untruth; For it was a thing of Gods own institution, Number
21.9. 2 Kings 18.4 John 3.14. As therefore tha^ 2 Kings 18.4.
Serpent was broken in pieces when the Israelites began to worship, and to
commit Idolatry with it; so ought this bowing at the Name of Jesus, which is
idoliz^d, or superstitiously abused by many, to be abolished too, And so much
the rather, because it is but a tak^n-up wo^ship, a humane Injunction,
introduced, propogated at first by See Section 3^
Popes, which has no warrant at all from God, or this Text of the Philippians.

That this bowing to and at the name Jesus, as it may be Though I belie^e the
first part of it to be absolutely true, Superstition being defined by Isiodor,
See Summ^ Angel. and Rosella, Tit* Superstitio.
Angelus de Cl^v^si^, and others^ to be, A rendering of another kind of worship
to God or Christ, than he prescribes in his Word, or wo^shipping God in another
mann^r, according to human inventions; I shall suspend my belief of the latter
Clause, till this Bowing be proved a religious duty prescribed by God in
Scripture, by stronger proofs and better evidences than any yet produced by
this Bishop or his Followers. For my own part I yet think there is no Religion
at all in it, and so, that it can be no Irreligion to omit it, That it is
rather Supe^stition than Religion to use it; and that many have used it, not
only superstitio^sly, but idolatro^sly, by bowing to and adoring the bare Name
and Letters of Jesus, which occasioned this Discourse.

To evidence this, I shall in the last place present you with an Exact
Chronological History of the true Original, Pedigree, and Progress of this
Ceremony, unknown (I believe) to most, even of those great Prelates and
Divines, who customarily use it; who if they had observed that Maxim o^
Aristotle, Scire est per Causam scire; That rule they learnt in their Grammars;
Faelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas; or that Gospel Precept, 1 John 4.1.
Brethren, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of
God, because many false Prophets are gone out into the World: should have first
examined, who were the original Inventors, Propagators of this pretended Duty
or Ceremony, and upon what motives, grounds, designs they first introduced it,
before they practiced it themselves, or pressed it upon others Consciences;
that so they might avoid that censure and danger denounced by our Savior
Christ himself against the Pharisees and their Disciples (who were guided more
by Mat. 5.21, to 38. c. 15.2, to 7. Mar 7.3, to 14. Gal. 1.14.

shall fall into the ditch. To avoid which danger, I shall now out of Conscience
and Christian compassion, endeavor to open their eyes, and discover that new
light unto them, which God has revealed unto me, upon my best Inquiry after
it, for my own private satisfaction and other^ instruction; which I hope will
prove a satisfactory Apology for the Indulgence of Christian liberty to all
scrupulous tender Consciences in this particular, according to his Majesti^s
late Royal Declarations.

What was the true Chronological, Original, Beginning and Progress, of the
Ceremony of Bowing at the Name of JESUS; and by what Popes, Popish Indulgences,
Artifices, Feast^, Councils, Authors, it was first Introduced, Prescribed,
Propagated? Very necessary for the Information of others, and Determination of
all Controversies concerning it.

IT is an unquestionable truth attested by many Fathers, Council^, and
Ecclesiastical Histories, Tertullian de Corona M^litis, lib De Ieiunio lib.

That the Primitive Christians, and Churches of Christ, for above 850. years
after our Saviors Birth, in all their Assemblies on Lords d^^es throughout the
year, and between Easter and Whitsontide, did never use to bow their knees, no
not in the very duty of Prayer it self, but prayed and performed all other Holy
duties to God and Christ standing, in memory of Christ's Resurrection from the
dead: And that all the Orthodox Christians constantly asse^ted against the
Arrians, and other Heretics, S^e A^hanasiu^ his Creed, Qu^d Christus ^it Deu^,
and the Orations, T^eatises of Nazionzen, B^fil, Hila^y, Cy^ill, Greg^ry
Nyss^n, and ^ther Fa^hers against the Arri^ns.
that the Three Persons of the sacred Trinity, as they were coeternal, and
coequal, so they were to be equally worshipped, adored, honored with one and
the self-same worship and veneration; for which end (some write) they invented
the use of Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; and
^aptised all they admitted as Members into the Church, in their Three Name^,
according to our Saviors Precept, Mat. 28 19. This being undeniable it thence
inevitably follows, that during all this tract of time, they never used to bow
their knees at or to the name of Jesus, when read or rehearsed in their public
Assemblies on those days; whence it is we find no mention at all of any such
duty or Ceremony used in any Father, Council, See Centur. Magd. 1. to 12. cap.
6. De Ri^i^^^ and Ceremoniis.
Historian, or other Author, for above a thousand years after Christ, who
doubtless would have recorded it, especially in their Commentaries on Isaiah
45. 23* and Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. had there any such practice been used, or duty
or Ceremony prescribed by these Texts, as some late Divines a verr, without any
prose or shadow of Authority.

Anno 1^3^.
Pope John the 20. who swayed the Popedom about the year 1030 is the first I
read of (and that only in one late Protestant Writer, but no other Author, who
as I suppose mistakes Pope John the 20. for 22. of which Pag^ 1^3.
hereafter, out of Salmeron the Jesuit) that set a^roach this Ceremony of
bowing at the name of Jesus: of whom Sir Edwin Sands, in his Europae Speculum,
Hagae 1629 page 16* writes thus. By grant from Pope John the 20 th ^ every
inclining of the Head at the name of Jesus, gets 20 years pardon; a matter in
Italy no not to this day unpractised. And to grace that Ceremony the more, I
have heard sundry of their renowned Divines teach in the Pulpit: that Christ
himself on the Cross bowed his Head on the right side, to reverence his own
name Jesus which was Mat. 27.37. John 19.19, 30. Anno 1160.
written over it. (A Monkish Fable) This is the highest pedigree of this late
upstart Ceremony, that I have hitherto met with.

Petrus Bles^nsis Archdeacon of Bathe, who flourished about the year 1160.
Bibl. Patr: Colon. Agrip. 1618. Tom. 12. pars 2. p. 881. D.
Sermo 28. De A^sumpsione B. Mariae, has this ensuing Passage. Non frustra
consuevit Eccl^sia intercessionem beatae Virginis affec^uosius caeter is implor
are, ita quod audit^ ejus nomine Which may be either intended to worship and
pray to her, or else to bow at the ^e^it^l of her name.
genua terrae affigat; imo pro nominis reverentia quasi mare confrag^sum sonant
vota populorum. And in the Margent there is this Note, Mariae genua flectuntur.
Which Passages seem to imply, that men did then use to bow the knee to, and do
reverence at the name of the Virgin Mary: but that they did so at the naming of
Jesus, I find no Authority at all in this Writer.

Lucas Tudensis, Anno 12^0.
who wrote about the year of our Lord, 1220. Adversus Albigensium Errores,
^ibl. Patrum, Tom. 13. p. 266. B.C.E.
lib. 2. cap. 14 writes thus. Qui humilitate superbiae principem vicit,
humilitate nos contr^ potestates aerias semper pugnare docuit: quod ipse and
fecit t^mpore carnis suae quando non recto capite, sed inclinato emisit
spiritum. Inclinenius nos and illi capita nostra, non solum mentis, sed and
corporis, lauds and gratias persolventes, eiqui pro nobis peccatoribus se
misericorditer inclinavit. Sed sunt nonnulli qui superbiae spiritu tumefacti,
(de quibus valde dolendum est) qui etiam cum It seems they then bowed, not
stood up at Gloria Patri.
Gloria, vel Laus Deo recitatur in Ecclesia, contemnunt, aut erubescunt, Regi
Regum Jesus To Jesus Christ, not to Jesus only.
Christo inclinare; coram transeunte Cruce, vel Christi Evangelio non
assurgunt: in celebratione Missae Sacerdote se ad eos vertente and Dominum
annunciante inclinari contemnunt: ad benedictionem Pontificis caput nudare
negligunt* and quod omnino nesarium est, and haeresi proximum, cum elevatur
corpus Christi a Sacerdote in sacratissimo Ministerio Missae, vel alias
defertur, erubescunt vel refugiunt suppliciter adorare. Hoc max. no^nulli
faciunt Curiales, qui consuev: terrenis Principibus flexis genibus and nudo
capite ministrare, O stulta dementia, etc. Hunc er^o tantae promissionis
accepta fiducia totis nisibus col^^demus: illi simplicitate recta humiliemur,
illi mentis and corporis capita non verecundemur nudare and inclinare, quia
Deus fortis pro nobis infirmis se inclina vit; ut homo infirmus fie^et, ut
humana firmitas soliditate perpetua firmaretur. A passage which may happily
imply, that in those times men did use to bow their Heads (not Knees) to Jesus
Christ the King of Kings, who bowed his Head for them: But this was not as I
take it, at every recital of his name Jesus in the Epistle, Gosple, Mass,
Sermons, or Prayers in the Church (of which there is not a sylable in this
Author) but at Gloria Patri, the lifting up of the Hoas^ in time of the Mass,
or at the passing by of the sign of the Cross, or Host in procession, as the
sense and words import.

Anno 1230.
Sanctus Franciscus, St. Francis, the Arch-Freer, who lived about the year
1230. in his Litera ad Sacerdotes, has this ensuing Clause, Bibl. Patr. Tom.
3. p. 351. ^.
Salutem in eo qui redemit and lavit not in sanguine suo: Cujus nomen audientes
adorate eum cum timore et reverentia proni in terra; Dominus Jesus Bibl. Patr.
Tom. 3. p. 351. ^.
Christus, altissimus filius nomen illi, qui est benedictus in secula, Amen.
Which implies an Injunction from this Arch-Freer, St. Francis, to those of his
Order, for adoration of the Lord Jesus Christ at that time, by bowing their
Heads with fear and reverence to the ground, when these his Names were
mentioned all together.

Ibid. Tom. ^3.452. H.
Freer David de Augusta: Anno 12^0
who flourished about the year 1240. De 7. Processibus religiosi, cap. 11.
writes thus, Sunt exteriores caeremoniales observantiae; ut inclinationes,
genuflectiones in horis, pulsationes, and omnes gesticulationes, quibus
Claustrales utuntur in divino offi^io, vel aliis, quibus saepe minus virtuosi
majorem vim faciunt, quam aliqui perfecti, and magis devoti. Which seems to
imply, that Monks in those days (for of them he writes) did use duckings and
gen^flections, either to the Host, the Crucifix, the Altar, and it may be to
the name of Jesus, though not particularly expressed; in which Ceremonies, the
less virtuous, says he, were for the most part more devout than the most
religious: Anno 1262.


Mich. Loch mair Sermon. 20. De Circumcisione Domini. L.
Pope Urban the 4th. about the year 1262. (as some report) gave an indulgence
of 30. days to all confessed and holy contrite Persons, who devoutly bowed to
the Name of the Lord Jesus.

These are the only passages I find in all Antiquity before the Council of
Lions, which gave any probable color to the use or practice of this Ceremony;
which was never established in the Church, till Pope Gregory the 10th. his
Papacy (to whom most ascribe its very Original) who in the Popish Council of
Lions, Anno 1273.
in the year 1273. made this Decree. See Sexti Decretalia lib. 3. tit. 23 c. 2.

dum aguntur Missarum sacra mysteria) gloriosum illud nomen quandocunque

This is the highest Antiquity, that any See Bernardinus Senensis, Sermo. 49.
^a^olus Stengelius De^ss. Nomine Jesus. c 23. and Salmeron, Operum tom. 3 tract.
3^ p. 335. etc who can raise this Ceremony from no high^r pedigree.
Papist or Iesuito has hitherto found out, to justify their bowing at or to
the name of Jesus. Yet this Constitution binds men only to bow the knees of
their hearts, (not of their bodies) at the naming of Jesus, and of Christ too;
(and that especially whiles the Mass is acting) which bowing of the heart they
must testify, by the inclination of their heads, not bowing of their knees.

After this, Pope Johannes 22. ducentos dies verae indulgentiae omnibus qui ad
nomen Jesus genua flecterent, vel caput inclinarent, vel tunderent pectus
largitus est: Salmeron Operum, Tom. 3. p. 335.
John the 22. about the year 1330. to induce men to the practice of this Popish
Ceremony, did (as Salmeron the Jesuit records) grant 200. days of true
indulgence to all who should bend their knees, or incline their heads, or knock
their breasts to or at the name of Jesus. Therefore it was then no received
duty of the Text, this Pope enducing the People to use it, only to gain his
Indulgences.

Anno 1350. Lect. 134 in lib. Sapientiae, c. 11. f^ 126.
Robert Holc^t our Popish Schoolman in his Lectures upon the Book of Wisdom,
Anno 1350.
writes thus of this Name and Ceremony Psalm. 41.^0.
S^c^ndum nomen tuum Deus, sic and laus tu^ in fines terrae. Hoc A gross
mistake, this Name Jesus being not then given to Christ: not mentioned nor
intended in the Psalm: but the Name Lord, or God, as v. 1, ^, 8, 14. resolves.
nomen est Jesus: de quo Math. Vocabis nomen ejus Jesus, ipse enim s^lvum
faciet populum suum a peccatis eorum. Solent enim multum amantes de personis
amatis facere cantilenas, eorum nomina exprimendo. Igitur de hoc nomine Jesus,
idem faciamus^ ^^xta illud Psalmi; Laudabo nomen Not Jesus.
Domini cum cantico, and mag^^^^abo ^um laud. Est igitur notandum, quod illud
nomen, est nomen honoris and excellentiae. Phil. 2. dedit ei nomen quod e^t
super omne nomen, ut IN nomine Jesu omne genu flectetur co^lestium,
terrestrium, and infernorum. Vnde secundum sacros Canones, quando hoc nom^n
Jesus pro^ertur in Ecclesia, omnis Christianus inclinari docetur cum capite;
quamvis tam hoc, quam Nota.
multa alia spiritualia in quibus lucrum divitiarum non consistit, a Praelatis
hujus temporis negliguntur. Whence it is apparent, 1. That he deemed this
Ceremon^ no duty of the Text, but a thing only enjoined by the Canons
forecited. 2ly. That this Ceremony, though enjoined by Canon, was yet wholly
neglected and not used nor urged by the Popish Prelates of his Age; why then
should any Protestant Bishops press it now? 3ly. That in those times men were
only required to bow their Heads, not knees, at the naming of Jesus; a thing
not prescribed, by this Text of Phil. 2. which speaks only of the knee. 4ly.
That Lord, God, are the Names mentioned, Ps. 48.10. not Jesus.

Since he, about the year 1430. one Bernardinus of Sennes a Franciscan Freer,
and a Popish See Marty^i^^^gium Romanum, and Opme^^ Chronogr: p. 414.
Canonized Saint, a great lover and admirer of the name Jesus, Carolus
S^engelius* De^ss Nomine Jesus, cap. 29 p. 157.159.
did earnestly exhort the People in all his Sermons and public exhortations
(especially in his 49. Sermon now in print, De Glorioso nomine Jesus Christi,
wherein he attributes what ever the Scripture speaks of Christ himself to his
very name Jesus, as Carolus S^engelius De^ss Nomine Jesus, cap. 29 p. 157.159.
Stengelius with others since have done, to make an Idol of it) That they would
give devotion, bowing and reverence to the name of Jesus, which is above every
name, in which every knee does bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth: neither is there any other name under heaven given
to men, in which they can be saved. This Supe^stitious, Popish Friar in his 49.
Sermon w^ites, That the name of Jesus was adored and worshipped of all
Creatures, that every creature did bow its knee to his name; when as Miracles
are daily wrought in the Creatu^e in his name: That Jesus is a glorious name,
and wor^hy of all worship; whence it may worthily and truly be said, and
devoutly believed, that when Paul was rapt into Paradise, and heard secret
words, which are not lawful for any to utter, he then p^rfectly learned, that
the name Jesus was to be adored of all men. Nota.
Therefore retu^ning from heaven, and remembering the foresaid words, and how
all the glorified Citizens in heaven bowed their knees and worshipped Jesus, at
the recital of this his name, and under^tanding that all infernal Spirits, and
those who are yet travelers upon earth ought to do the lik^: he commanding all
men in the Spirit of God, writ in this Text of Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. That IN the
name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, earth, and under the
earth, etc. which the Church, willing to have every man observe, commanded men
to bow the knees of their hearts in the time of Mass when the name Jesus was
mentioned, citing the Canon of the Council of Lions, ( Here p. 1^3^
forecited) to prove it. And the better to d^aw the People to ado^e and bow to
the name of Jesus, he Carolus S^engelius ibid p. 159, 160, 161. Molanus Histo^^

did use about the end of his Sermons, to show unto them a Picture, in which
the Name JESUS was written in golden Letters, enclosed on every side with Sun
beams; or a Glory: which Pictured name (the 12* rays whereof he expresses in
his Se^mon) the People beholding did most devoutly adore, with bended knees.
For which Fact of his being complained against by some who maligned his fame,
to Pope Martin the 5th. this Pope when as he had heard his Answer, gave him
free liberty, not only to preach, So writes Salmeron.
but likewise to carry about and show unto the people this picture of the name
of Jesus. From Molanus De Pictu^is e^lmag l. ^ c. 1. and 18.
which pattern of his, all pictures of the name of Jesus, both in
Glasse-windows, Popish Authors, Masse-books, and elsewhere, were at first
derived. Indeed Pars 3. Hist Tit. 24. c. 5. see S^engelius, p. ^^9, 160
Antoninus records, that Pope Martin enjoined him that he should no more show
this picture unto the people, left some superstition, or scandal should be
raised in the Church by this his novelty: which Injunction he obeyed. But Pope
Clement the 7th. (as De Picturis l. 3. c. 1. and 18. See Stengelius p. 162. and
Dr. Fulks Notes on the Rh^mish Testament^ ^n Apoc. 13. sect. 7, 8, 9.
Molanus records) at the request of the Freers Minorites, ordained, that all
their Order, and the Nuns of the Order of St. Clare, should use this picture of
the name Jesus, which they were backward else to use.

This Ceremony, it seems, was not yet so generally received as the Papists did
desire, Anno 1431.
and therefore the Popish Council of Basil, Anno Dom. 1431. Su^^us Council. ^om.

s^militer facere deberent, et per hoc se reddere participes illarum
Indulgentiarum. Here we have the full true Pedigree and Progress of bowing at
the recital of the name of Jesus, and other sentences of Scripture, especially
in the Celebration of the Mass, and the several Indulgences granted by
Successive Popes, to induce the people to the practice of these genu-flections;
which yet he complains many then neglected, not caring for these large Popes
Indulgencies, purchased at so cheap a rate, as the bare bowing of their heads
or knees, as aforesaid.

Anno 1500.
Not long after this, about the year of Christ 1500. or sooner, the Popes, with
some Popish Prela^es, Priests, and Monks, when their Indulgencies would not
prevail so much as they expected, to draw the people to these genu-flections,
and induce them to a more constant universal adoration of, and bowing to the
name of Jesus, compiled a particular Psalter, which they entitled Jesus
Psalter, printed at Antwerp 1505. in Latin, since translated into English by
Laurence Kellam, and printed at the end of his Manuel of Prayers, Duaci 1603.
which Psalter begins thus.

Phil. 2. In nomine JESU omne genu flectatur, Coelestium, Terrestrium, and
Infernorum; and omnis lingua confit^atur, quia Dominus Jesus Christus est in
gloria Dei Patris, which is likewise repeated after the first and tenth
Petition. It consists of 15 Petitions, The 1: Petition is, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
mercy; 10. times repeated one after another, without intermission: The 2.
Petition, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, help me; The 3. Petition, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
strengthen me; The 4. Petition, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, comfort me; The 5 Petition,
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, make me constant and stable; The 6. Petition, Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, light me; The 7. ^etition, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, grant me grace to dread
thee; The 8. Petition, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, grant me to love thee; The 9.
Petition, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, grant me grace to remember thy death; The 10.
Petition, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, send me here my Purgatory; The 11. Petition, Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus, grant me grace to flee evil company; The 12. Petition, Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, grant me grace to call for help to thee; The 13. Petition, Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, make me to persever in virtue acceptable unto thee; The 14. Petition,
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, grant me grace to fix my mind on thee; The 15. Petition,
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, give me grace to order my life to thee. Each of these 15.
Petitions are thus trebled ten times over one after another, the name Jesus
being 30 times repeated together in each Petition, and 54. times more in other
larger Petitions, between each of these, in all Is not this Battology an
express violation of Mat 6.70 Bu^ when ye pray use not VAIN REPETITIONS as the
Heathens do* for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking
504. times, but his name Christ not once mentioned, nor any other of his names
but Lord alone, and that rarely; which name Jesus is as often to be bowed to and
adored as thus recited, by their Injunctions, Canons, to wit, 504* times in one
half hour.

Moreover to propagate this Ceremony and bowing to and at this name, Anno 1506.
they not long after compiled Printed together in Sacrae Litaniae variae,
Antwerpiae, 1629. p. 15, to 34.
5. Special Psalms, in honorem nominis Jesus, with the Letters I. H. S. and a
Crucifix in the midst of the H. prefixed to them; together with Letaniae de
Nomine Jesus, wherein the name JESU is repeated no less then 74. times
together, with several titles added to it, as I^su potentissime, Jesus
perfectissime, etc. miserere nobis, Libera nos I^su, Parce nos Jesus, exaudi nos
Jesus, etc. At the end whereof follows this Prayer for those who devoutly adore
and bow to the name Jesus upon Earth. Printed also in Officium beatae Mariae
secundum riium Sacrum, f 170
God, who have made the most glorious name of Jesus Christ ^hy only Son amiable
with the chief affection of sweetness to thy faithful ones, and dreadful and
terrible to evil Spirits, mercifully grant, that all those who devoutly Viz. by
bowing unto it, when it is pronounced, as Stengelius understands it.
worship this name of Jesus on Earth, may receive the sweetness of its holy
consolation in this present world, and in the world to come may obtain the joy
of endless exultation and bliss in Heaven, by the same our Lord Jesus Christ
thy Son. The benefit of which Masse-Prayer, our modern Advocates for bowing at
and to the name of Jesus, with all their over-zealous Proselytes, may do well
to claim.

Anno 1510.
About the year 1510 Richardus Hampole an English Popish Priest writ a Treatise,
^ohanne. Baleus Centur: Scriptorum* Brit pars ult. p. 167.
De Veneratione Nominis Jesus, mentioned by Bishop Bale (and if I mistake not)
extant in his Opuscula Varia, Ms. in the famous University of Oxford) to
promote the adoration of, and bowing at and to the Name of Jesus.

Anno 1514.
Not long after (as I conjecture) there were special Liturgies, compiled and
published for the self-same end by the Popes and Popish Priests direction,
entitled, Printed Antw 1629. with other Litan^ae Variae p. 64. to 96.
Litaniae Passionis Domini nostri Jesus Christi; beginning with this Text of
Phil. 2 8, 9, 10, 11. (recited at large) wherein the name Jesus is repeated no
less than 164. times one after another, with Miserere nobis Jesus, Liberanos
IESV, ^xaudi nos Jesu, subjoyned to each petition, as in the precedent
Liturgies of the Name Jesus. They likewise then compiled printed, published,
used Horae de Nomine Jesus, and Dulcissimi nominis Jesus. And, Vesperae in
veneratione nominis Jesus, editae a devoto Ricardo de Hampole, printed in Horae
beatitissimae Virginis Mariae ad legitimum Ecclesiae Sarisburiensis ritum,
Parisiis 1519 f. 169, 170, etc. In which I find on the 7th. of August, in the
Calendar printed with it, and in other Popish Kalendars, a special Feast,
dedicated likewise to the Name of Jesus, entitled, Festum dulcissimi Nominis
Jesus, Minus duplex; which Feast Pope Clement the 7th. (about the year 1524.) as
S^ Nominis Jesus cultus, p. 162.
Stengelius, and De Picturis ^ Imaginibus, ^. 3. c. ^ and 18.
Molanus inform us, appointed to be generally observed as Minus duplex, a less
double Festival, famous among many Churches, and amongst the common people.
Thus one Superstition, Idolatry to this Name, begot another.

These Popish Letanies, Hours, Vespers, Psalters, Festival of the name Jesus,
purposely invented to promote its adoration, to which the people were formerly
very backward, brought bowing to it into general practice and request in most
Churches then leavened with Popery, the Priests and People usually bowing their
Heads, Knees, and putting off their Hats to it when rehearsed in Epistles,
Gosples, Masses, Sermons, and Divine Offices.

And hereupon the Provincial Popish Council of Sienna, Anno 1^24.
or Sennes, in the year 1524. (following the pattern of the Council of Basil)
Decreta Morum, c. 18. established the use of this Ceremony, in all Collegiate
and Cathedral (not other) Churches, in these following words, vizt. Surius
Council. tom. 4. p 740* 741. Bochel. lib. 4. tit. 1. c. 2 p. 543. vid. ibid.
Et ut in majoribus Ecclesiis cultus Dei vivi sanctior, juxta majorum
traditiones in melius reformetur: statuimus, ut in Cathedralibus and
collegiatis and conventualibus Ecclesiis, horis debitis, etc. Horas autem
canonicas dicturi, etc. Cum nominatur illud nomen gloriosunt, Jesus; in quo
omne genu flectitur coelestium, terrestrium and infernorum, omnes caput (not
genu) inclinent. Phil. 2.
And Decreta Surius ibid. p. 731.
Fidei c. 14. this Council also draws this Argument from this very Ceremony, to
prove the lawfulness of worshipping the Image of Christ and Saints. Et nos
quidem non quasi ante Divinitatem, ante imagem prosternimur; sed illum
adoramus, quem per Imaginem aut passum, vel in throno sedentem, recordamur. Et
dum per ipsam picturam quasi per scripturam, ad memoriam Filium Dei reducimus,
animum nostrum de resurrectione laetificat, aut de passione mulcet, non majore
quidem idolatriae periculo, quam cum nomine Jesus omne genu flectitur
coelestium, terrestrium and infernorum. Phil. ^.
Quem enim vocabula cursim auribus insinuat, hunc eundem fidelibus oculis imago
sedulo repraesentat, etc.

In the year of our Lord 1526. Anno 1526.
the Synod of Carnotum (or Chartres) in France, Bochel. l. 4. tit. 1. c. 3. p.
544.
decreed thus for the use of this Ceremony. Nullus in Ecclesia maxim dum sacra
aguntur ambulet, v^getur, aut discurrat. Magis autem monemus omnes and singulos
ut illis Ecclesias ingredientibus sit bumilis and devotus ingressus, and intus
quieta conversatio, intontis precordiis, devotis insi^^ant orationibus, and dum
sacra aguntur, gloriosumque nomen Jesu recolitur, flecta^t audientes genu^, aut
capitis inclinatione suam Salvatorem testentur.

Not long after this, Anno 154^.
the Diocesan Popish Synod of Surius Council. t^m. 4 p. 810.
Augusta, Anno 1548. cap. 23. in more obscure terms, prescribed this bowing,
etc. to all Ecclesiastical persons, not only at the recital of the name of the
Body or Blood of CHRIST (not Jesus) but of the Virgin Mary too. The Can^n runs
thus: Cum autem Deo Opt. Max. Creatori and Redemptori suo honorem, timorem and
reverentiam homo tanquam creatura habeat; multosque videmus ea in re damnata
ignavia de^ides esse; omnibus Ecclesiasticis personis nost^ae Dio^oesis
distinct p^aecipiendo mandamus, ut post haec summa pietate Deum ubique and
honorent, and timeant, praecipue vero in templo humiliter revereant^r and
vene^entur. Et quum in nomine Domini nost^i Jesu Both name^ are here expressed.
Phil. 2.
Ch^isti omne genu co^lestium, terrestrium and inferorum flectendum sit;

Jesus) rev^rentiam exhib^ant debitam, and populum ad ejus rei imita^ionem

than to the Name o^ Jesus only.

Anno 1519.
The very next year after, in the Provincial Popish Synod of Sur^us tom. 4. p.
809.
Mogun^ or M^ntz, under Sebastian the Archbishop, Anno Dom. 1549. cap. 59 (not
Anno 813. as some mistake it, and ^o make this Ceremony above 400. antienter
than it is) which has ^his title to it. M^ssa, quo gestu, and qua devotio^e

valitudinem potest, etiam corporis gestu reverentiam quandam adhibeant:
videlicet, ut dum in Collectis, pro communi orbis terrarum incolumitate ad Deum
preces funduntur, ipsi quoque tanquam hujus sac^ae Communionis cives, suas
p^aeces cum oratione publica conjungant, and vultu ad Nota.

ad ea quae ibi aguntur animum intendere videantur.

Thomas Beacon in his Displaying of the Popish Mass, Vol. 3. of his works
printed 1563. f. 39.
printed in the year 1563. writes thus, This use is observed at this day in the
Popish Masses, The People stand up when the Gosple is read, And make Courtesy
when they hear the Name of JESUS, but they understand not one word.

In the Roman Missal, reformed and set forth by Pope Pius the 5th. Anno Dom.
1570. among Ritus, Celebrandi M^ssam, I find this Rubric, M^ssale Romanum,
Salmanticae, 1588. p. 26.
De ordine sedendi, standi, genuflect^ndi in Missa; wherein there are these
directions and prescriptions, when the Mass-Priest in saying his Mass, or the
Deacons and People, ought to bow the Knee. Gen^flectit qu^ndo oportet,
Genuflectit quando legitur Ev^ngelium. In principio, ad illa verba: and verbum
caro facta est. and evangelium cum natus esset JESUS, ad illa verba in fine:
and procidens adoraverunt eum. Item Evangelium feriae quar^ae post Dominicam
qu^^tam Quadragesimae, ad illa verba in fine: and procidens adoravit e^m. Et
cum Diaconus cantat illa verba, ipse versus librum, celebrans and circumstantes
versus Altar Gen^flectunt. Subdiaconus vere tenens librum, and Acolythi
candelabra, non genuflectunt. Item genuflectit in Dominica Palmarum, and in
Missis de Cruce ad illa verba in Epistola, In nomine Jesus omne genu flectatur:
Et ad Passionem quando Christus expi^avit. Item quando legitur Passio, ad illa
verba expiravit.

From which passages it is very observable, 1. That the Roman Missal it self,
though reformed by the Decree of the Council of Trent, and this Popes command;
and since revised by Pope Gregory the XIII. Anno 1573. does not promiscuously
enjoin the Priest, Deacon or People to bow their knees at every recital of the
name of Jesus in the Epistle, Gosple, or Mass, though enjoined by the
forecited Popes and Popish Councils, and then* commonly practiced by the
ignorant Lay People, who understood not what was read in an unknown tongue. 2ly
That it prescribes the Priest and People to Bow their Knees at the ^ecital of
these several entire Sentences in the Gosple, Mass and Passion: And the Word
was made Flesh; And they fell down and worshipped him; And falling down he
worshipped him; He gave up the Ghost: Not at the bare mention of any of Christ's
Names; nor yet at this Sentence, When Jesus was born; though his Name Jesus be
mentioned the^ein. 3ly. That on Palm Sunday it self, and the Mass of the
Cross; when this very Text of Phil. 2.9, 10, 11* That IN the name of Jesus
every Knee should bow: it prescribes the Priest to bow, not AT or to this bare
name Jesus; but at the recital, end of the entire Clause and Words, as Ad illa
verba in Epistola resolve, and assure us, not at every mention of his name
Jesus.

In Missa Votivae de S. Cruce, p. 54. at the end of this Missale Romanum: this
Text of Phil. 2. v. 8, 9, 10, 11. is read as the Epistle: and over against
these words, Vt in nomine Jesus omne genu flectatur coelestium, terrestrium, and
inferuorum, there is printed in red Letters in the Margin, HIC G^NV FLECTI^VR,
to wit, after the recital of all the entire Sentence, not at the very
pronunciation of the name Jesus, much less unto it at every recital thereof.
After which follows these Versicles, Dulce lignum, dulces claves, O Crux
benedicta, quae sola fuisti digna sustinere Regem coelorum and Dominum,
allelujah. Dicite in Gentibus, quia Dominus regnavit a ligno: allelujah.
Adoramus te Christ (not Jesu) and benedicamus tibi, etc. Tuam Crucem adoramus
Domine; not his name Jesus when mentioned in any of the Prayers of this Mass,
but his Title Dominus, no less than 3. several times repeated. So as the
Compilers of this Mass, these Prayers, of Missa Votiva de S. CRVCE, and Festum
duplex Triumphi CRVCIS, reputed not the name Jesus, the name above every name
intended in this Text, but his Name Lord, which every tongue shall confess,
quia DOMINVS Jesus Christus in gloria est Dei Patris, as they all read this
Text; upon which they also ground their adoration of the Cross of Christ, and
this Prayer for its adorers, inserted into Missae propriae Sanctorum Hispan. p.
114. Deus, qui per Crucem tuam populo in te credenti triumphum contra inimicos
concedere voluisti, quaesumus, ut tua pietate adorantibus Crucem, victoriam
semper trib^as and honorem. Qui vivis and regnas; as other Papists ^ounded
their P. 127, 128, 129.
formentioned Jesus Psalter, Psalms in honorem Nominis Jesus, Litaniae de
Nomine Jesus, Horae de Nomine Jesus, Vesperae in Veneratione Nominis Jesus, Festum
minus duplex De dulcis. nomine Jesus; and a Prayer for those who adore the Name
Jesus thereon; all standing on the self-same Basis, equally admitted, embraced,
or rejected upon the self-same grounds; which I desire all considerate
conscientious Protestants seriously to observe, who may as justly adore the
Cros^ as Name of Jesus.

In the year of our Lord 1578. Anno 1578.
Lour. Bochel. Decret. Eccles. Gal l. 4. Tit. 1.^^ 14. p. 546.
Synodus Ebroicensis held in France, made this Decree for all Churchwardens
under their Popish Jurisdiction to put in execution. Editui circumspiciant quid
quisque aget in Ecclesia, and quomodo se g^rat a minimo usque ad maximum; si
^aput aperiat, genua cum opus est flectat, Officio divino animum and aures
adhibeat, si orationi incumbat, Agente^^ contraria cum aliquae reverentia and
modestia objurgent, and ad Officium cogant: the intent of which Canon perchance
extends to bowing the knee at the n^ming of Jesus, and the Virgin Mary, as well
as to kneeling at Collects and Prayers.

Anno 1583.
The Popish Council of Rhemes since that, viz. Anno Domini 1583. as Decreta
Ecclesiae G^ll^^anae l 1. Tit. 2. c. 22. p 21.
Bochellus records, made this Decree or Canon following: In pronunciatione
nominis Jesus, and cum dicitur versus, Gloria Patri, capu^ aperiant and
inclinent. That in the pronouncing of the name Jesu, and when the verse, Glory
be to the Father, was said or read, men should uncover and bow their heads.
Which Canon extends not unto Women, 1 Cor. 11.5, to 16.
who ought not to uncover their heads in the Church, much less to come thither
like so many Strumpets, with 1 Cor. 11.5^ to 16. ^ Tim. 2.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3*3, 4.

cut, broidred, powdered hair, as our Viragoes do of late: whereas the words of
Phil. 2.9, 10. In the name of Jesus every knee should bow, extend to women as
well as men, and rather to women's bowing, (who in their courtesies bow both
their knees full low) than to men's; who in their common courtesies or legs at
the name of Jesus, or to men bow See Genesis 41 43. Matthew. 27.29. Romans 11.4.
only one, not both their knees: whereas this Text requires every knee to bow,
and so enjoins the bowing of both knees, not one alone; the courtesies of
women, not heads, caps, or legs of men, here prescribed to bow at Gloria Patri.

The Popish Council of Bitures, alias B^chell Decr. Eccl. Gal l. 1. Tit. 7. ^.
28. p. 8^.
Council. Bituricense, Anno 1584.
the very next year following: viz. Anno Domini 1584. promulgated this Canon to
the like effect. In fine Psalmorum, and ubicunque Gloria sanctissimae Trinitati
redditur, omnes consurgant, and in invocatione ^ominis Jesus, genu flectant:
Which may be construed as well of kneeling only in the invocation of the name
of Jesus in Prayer, as of bowing at the pronunciation of his name Jesus.

Besides these several Popish Councils, the Sorbonists about the year 1540.
from Phil. 2.9, 10. as Mr. Calvin, Marloret, and See here, p. 29, 49.
others on that Text record, began to publish and teach this Doctrine, that as
often as the name of Jesus should be m^ntioned, (as in some Portuasses and
Masse-books it is repeated See Jesus his Psalter, here p. 128, 129. Bp.
Babingtons Exposition of the Catholic Faith p 195. Here p. 42, 43.
20, 30. yea 504. times together) so often men must bow their knees: for which
Doctrine, write Calvin, Marloret, and Bishop Alley, they are more than
ridiculous. Plusquam ridiculi sunt Sorbonici Sophistae, etc.

After these, the Rhemists about the year 1582. in their Notes in their Rhemish
Testament, Anno 1582.
on Phil. 2.9, 10. See Dr. Fulk and Mr. Cartwrights Answer to the Rhemish
Testament, Ibid. Here p. 36* to 41.
sect. 2. and on Apoc. 13. sect. 7. set on this Ceremony in an higher strain,
where they write thus. By the like wickedness^ the Protestants charge the
faithful people for capping or kneeling, when they hear the name of Jesus, as
though they worshipped not our Lord God therein, but the Syllables or Letters,
or other material Elements, whereof the word written or spoken con^isteth: And
all this by Sophistications to draw the people from due ho^our and devotion
toward Christ Jesus, which is Satan's drift, by putting scriples into poor
simple men's minds, about his Sacraments, his Saints, his His Cross, his Name,
etc. are here coupled together, and bowed to alike.

do not ho^our these things, nor count them holy for their matter, color,
sound and syllables, but for the respect and relation they have to our Savior,
bringing us to the remembrance and apprehension of Christ, by ^ight, hearing,
and use of the same signs, else why make we not rever^nce at the name of Jesus
the Son of Syrach, as well as at Jesus Christ? And it is a pitti^ull case to
see these profane subtleties of Heretics to take place in Religion, which
were ridiculous in all other trade of life. When we hear our Prince or
Sovereign named, we may without th^se scruples do obeisance. But toward Christ
it must be Superstitious. And here it is much to be noted, that the Protestants

foreheads, and taking away the honor and reverence of the name of Jesus, do
make room for Antichrists Image, and mark, and name. Thus the Rhemists, whose
steps and genius some modern Protestant advocates and Patrons of bowi^g at the
name of Jesus, do follow to an hairs breadth, though See He^e p. 36, to 53.

Caeremoniale Episcoporum, which he prescribed to be used in all Churches,
especially Metropolitan, Cathedral, and Collegiate, without alteration or
addition thereunto, as his Bull prefixed to it attests; afterward dedicated
to, and approved by Pope Urban the 8. In this Caeremoniale l. 2. c. 8. De Missa
solemni Episcopo celebranti, p. 206. there is this pres^ription to the Deacon
who reads the Gospel in the Mass, celebrated by the Bishop. Tunc manibus
junctis pro sequitur Evangelium, Et cum profert nomen Jesus, vel Mariae,
inclinat se, sed profundius cum dicit Jesus, quod et omnes faciunt. But this
bowing is only when the Gospel is reading, and that to the name of Mary, as
well as of Jesus, but somewhat lower to the name of Jesus, then of Mary.

Since these, I find some private Popish Authors, (especially the Jesuits, who
deriving their Name and Order from the name of Jesus, do most stickle for this
bowing at and to the name Jesus) who have As I hear of some Protestants writing
for this Ceremony too, as hot as any Jesuits, viz Giles Widows, Mr. Page.

Alphonsus Salmeron a famous Jesuit, in his Works at large 1612. Tom. 1.

Pope John the 22 who granted an ^ndulgence for 200. days to all who should

naming of Jesus, to represent the great humiliation and exaninition of Christ:
And That a certain Monk was ^^ffed by the It seems the Devil is be^ter pleased

That the name of Jesus is worthy all worship, genu-fl^ction, and adoration, in
which name Paul would have every knee to bow, both of things in Heaven, and
things in Earth, and things under the Earth. For this name, whether it be
pronounced with the mouth, or heard with the ear, or Let our bowers at the
sound only of the name o^ Jesus note this well and answer it as they can.
where ever it is written, painted, or engraven, is worthy Divine Worship; not
for the bare word, writing, or picture it self, but for the signification of
it; as You see h^w the Papists rank these three together, the adoration of the
Cross* the Image, and the name of Jesus.
the Cross and Image of Christ are deservedly adored with the worship of
Lat^ia, for the type and mystery represented in them, etc. The same Doctrine we
shall find in Cornelius a Lapide, a Jesuit, in his Commentary on Phil. 2.9, 10

Syllables, or sound of the name Jesus, but the thing contained and signified
together with the sound and Syllables: But some (says he) may say, Why do we
bow at the name of Jesus, rather than at the name of Christ? I Answer, Because
Christ is not a proper name, but a declaration of Christ's Kingdom and power:
But This is Bishop Andrews his Reas^n too, See his Sermons, p. 475, 4^6, 477.
Here re^uted p. 57^ 110, 111.
Jesus is a proper name, which he has bought with his great pain, and has
received as a reward of his labor. For alth^ugh this name was imposed on him
in his very Circumcision, and promised to him in his Conception, yet both these
were done, because he ought to do that in his time, which the name does
signify; to wit, to save his people. Paul therefore affirms, that this name
was given to him, because he actually performed this with his great pain. Phil.
2. He humbled himself, therefore God has highly exalted him, and given him a
name above every name: that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, etc.
Therefore this most honorable name is given, because he merited it. This is
Mr. Widows his Reason, see his Confutation p. 6. and 30 to ^2. and 81, 82.
The name it self is thus honored, because he has merited it. As often
therefore as we Catholics honor the name of Jesus by bowing the knee, so often
we give unto him due and deserved honor, which he has merited with a great
price, so often we do that we ought and are bound to do; not only out of
congruity for the greatness of the benefit conferred upon us, but also out of
debt, by reason of the So Bishop Andrews res^lves too, here p. 56, 58.
will and precept of the eternal Father; who has therefore given this name
unto his Son, that In nomine, not, ad nomen, which signifie^h to, not at the
name; Here p. 2, to 10.
in this name every knee should bow* that all should worship this name, and in
worshipping should confess, that Jesus is in the glory of his Father. But as
often as the Heretics (who utter and hear this name without any reverence,
because they have not the Holy Ghost) do not worship this name, as often as they
refuse to bow and worship, as often as they deride others who worship and bow the
knee unto it, So writes Mr. Widows too, page 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26, 74, 86,
8^, 88, 90. and Bish^p Andrews, here p 56, 58.
so often they violate the precept and will of God the Father, so often they do
injury to God the Son, and deny him his due honor, so often they contradict the
Apostle, so often they scandalize, or rather deride the Church of God: Finally,
so often they do acceptable service to the Devil, Yet Salmeron informed ^s
bef^^e, that the Devil cuff^d a Monk for omitting it; and therefore he is
rather the Author, th^n the hinde^er of this bowing.
who has in an especial manner taught them this, and by them does propagate
this impiety unto others. This and much more to like purpose does this
Benedictine Fre^r, Stengelius, write, and publish in print Anno 1613. which I
thought good in part to transc^ibe, because it is almost verbatim the same with
Bishop Andrews Sermon, (who took his materials and reasons from him) and with
Mr. Widows, and other late Protestants writings, and See Bp. Andrews Sermons
in Folio p 475, 476, 477. Mr. Adams his Sermons p. 1203. Dr. Wrens Sermon Febr.
12. 1627 p 16, 18.
Sermons to this purpose; between whom and these there is now no difference at
all in this point of bowing at the naming of Jesus, for ought that I can find,
and so they are both accorded in this particular.

This is the only true genuine Pedigree and progress of this much pressed
Duty, and admired Ceremony of bowing at the name of Jesus, that I in my poor
reading can find in all Antiquity, or the Jesui^es and Papists themselves yet
really produced. If better, graver, or more learned Heralds can derive its
Parentage higher, (as Bp. Andrews and Mr. Widows, who misquote some Fathers
for it: whereas Bp. Whitguift, and Zanchius write only, That it was an ancient
custom and practice in the Church, but quote no Authorities to prove it,
because in truth there are none extant to prove it antienter than this its
pedeg^ee.
some have vainly endeavored, to deduce it from the Fathers, and the constant
practice of the Primitive Church; when as I am confident upon most diligent
search and good inquiry, that there is no one Father, no ancient nor modern
Writer extant, to prove or warrant what they assert, as the Sea Lame Giles his
Haltings, p 7.8 31, ^2 Here* p. 101 to 105.
examination of their alleged testimonies will at first discover,) I shall be
willing to be corrected and instructed by them. But if they must needs concur
with me in this its Popish Original and Progress which I have here faithfully
set down; (as I presume they must, since Popish Priests, Monks and Jesuits,
who have been most inquisitive in discovering its original, have raised the
injunction and practice of it, no higher than the Popes I have recited:) let
them now at last for very shame (unless they intend to turn Champions for
Romish Inventions, Superstitions, Innovations, unknown to the primitive Church
and Christians;) contend no more for such a pretended Duty, or Ceremony, which
had no other real Fathers, but the forenamed Popes, Popish Councils, Writers;
no other Mother, Nurse, Midwife, but the Antichristian Church of Rome, with
whose Popish Ceremonies, Relics, Altars, Images, Crucifixes, Genuflection^,
Bowings and such like abused idolatrous, Sic n^ta Romana superstiti^, quorum

same shall be my conclusion in the point in question; Bowing at and to the name
of Jesus had its original, growth, progress from the Antichristian Popes and
Church of Rome, who propagated it by their Masses, Letanies, Feasts, Canons,
Councils, Indulgences, Pictures See the Council of Senn^, the Rhemists, Sal.

to justify, their idolatrous bowing to Images, Crucifixes, Hosts and Altars,
as I have fully manifested in the premises.

How then any zealous, judicious Protestant Bishops, High Commissioners,
Ecclesiastical Officers can justly censure, suspend, molest, excommunicate any
conscientious As Mr. Sam^ Ward, Mr. Snelling and others. See Canterburies

Ministers, or Christians in their High Commission, Consistories, Visitations,
for not bowing at the name of Jesus, as a Duty of the Text, or nec^ssary decent
Ceremony, or declaring the Reasons of their omission or non-usage thereof, let
the impartial Readers hereof determine, and their own Consciences resolve. It
was Tertullians conclusion in the Case of Stage Plays, De Spect. lib. c. 10.

Musculus his resolution. It is not fit that these things which are rather
superstitious than religious, or have so great a show of Superstition, should
be retained in the Church. God forbid that I should maintain any Traditions, or
Worships which are Popish. And I call them Pop^sh Traditions, which either of
their own nature, or by abuse do serve unto Popish impiety, superstition, and
blindness; all which (I am persuaded) ought to be detested, as much as
possible. Let it be all our Bishops too: especially since the Church and
Parliament of England themselves in their Preface to the Books of Common Prayer
in King Edward the Sixth and Queen Elizabeth's reigns: Of Ceremonies why some be
abolished, and others retained, thus determine of them.

Of such Ceremonies as be used in the Church, and have had their beginning by
the institution of man: some at the first were of godly intent and purpose
devised, and yet at length turned to Uanity and Superstition. Some en^^ed into
the Church by indiscreet Devotiou, and such a Zeal as was without Knowledge;
and for because they were winked at in the beginning, they grew daily to more
and more Abuses, which not only for their unprofitablenesse, but also because
they have much blinded the People, and obscured the Glory of God, are worthy to
be cut away and clean rejected. And whereas in this our time the minds of men
are so diverse, that some men think it a great matter of Conscience to depart
from a piece of the least of their Ceremonies they be so addicted to their old
Customs, and lest any man should be o^^ended whom good reason might sati^fie)
here be certain Causes rendered, why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put
away, (particula^ly, Hours, Psalters, Letanyes, Feasts, Ado^ation of the name
of Jesus, as well as Altars, Tapers, Copes, Images, Albes, Crucifixes*
Processions, Adoration of and bowing to or toward Altars, Crosses, the Hostia,
etc.)

Some are put away, because the great excess and multitude of them has so
increased in these later days, that the burden of them was intolerable;
whereof Ad I^^^arium, Ep. 119. Se^. Antiq^. Eccl. Brit p. 4.
St. Augusti^e in his time complained, That they were grown to such a number,
that the ^state of Chr^stian people was in a worse case (concerning that
matter) than were the Jews: and he advised, That such a Yoke and Burden
should be taken away, as ^ime would serve quietly to do it.

Let our Prela^es (...) it (...) their (...) under (...) of Ex^ommunica^^^n

But what would St. Augustine have said, if he had seen the Ceremonies of late
days used among us? whereunto the Multitude used in his time were not to be
compared. This our excessive multitude of Ce^emonies we^e so great, and many of
them so dark, that they did more con^ound and darken, than declare and set
forth Christ's Benefits unto us.

And besides this, Christ's Gosple is not a Ceremonial Law (as much of Moses Law
was) but it is a Religion to serve God, not in Why should any then be
imprisoned, excommunicated, deprived of his Ministry and Benefi^e for not using
Ceremonies of men's inve^ting?
bondage of the Figure, or shadow, but in the freedom of Spirit, being content
only with those Ceremonies, which do serve to preserve Order and Godly
Discipline.

Furthermore, the most weighty cause of abolishment of certain Ceremonies, was,
That they were so far abused, partly by the superstitious blindness of the rude
and unlear^ed, and partly by the unsatiable ^varice of such as sought more
their own lucre, than the Glory of God, that the Abuses could not well be taken
away the Thing remaining still.

Those be taken away that were mo^^ abused, and did burden men's Consciences
without any cause.

We think it convenient that every Country should put away such Ceremonies,
which from time to time they see most abused, as in men's Ordinances it often
chances diversely in diverse Countries.

Whether all or some of these Passages may not be justly applied to thi^ Bowing
at the Name of Jesus only, as likewise to kneeling at the Sacrament, upon due
consideration of its original Author^, Promoters, and Pr^mises abuses, I refer
to every man's conscience to resolve.

Especially because it puts a difference, disparity* inequality, not only
between this Name Jesus, and all other Names, Titles, Attributes of our
Savior, and the Name^, Titles of God the Father, and Holy Ghost* but a visible
undeniable inaequality and disp^rity between their sacred Persons, though
co^ternal and co^qual by our Churches Athenesius ^ Nice^s Cree^s.
Creed, and Scriptures resolution, and to be equally worshipped, ^dored,
reverenced, bowed unto by all Orthodox Believers; whose Persons are never
adored, worshipped, or bowed unto in the Church when their Name^ or Titles are
mentioned* nor yet the Person of God the Son, when any other of his Names are
uttered, but only the Person of Jesus (or rather his name alone) when Jesus is
either read, heard or seen. Which as it apparently thwarts that express Text of
John 5.22, 23. The Father has committed all judgment to the Son, that all men
should honor the Son, even as (that is in the self-same manner, form) they
honor the Father, not otherwise, nor more frequently, devo^tly, reverently than
they honor the Father, at and to whose person they bow not their Knees or
Head* when his name is recited; as usual they do by standing up at and
honoring all three persons alike in their frequent repetitions of, Glory be to
the FaFather, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, without bowing at or to
all or any of their Names: So it seems to put an inequality and disparity
between their sacred Person^ and Sovereign Divine Authority, and to advance
Jesus the Son, above God the Father, and Holy Ghost

Especially when all their three names are jointly read and repeated together
in one Verse, Prayer, Sentence, as at the end of every Morning Prayer. The
grace of our Lord JESUS Christ, the love of God (the Father) and the most
comfortable fellowship of the HOLY GHOST, be with us all evermore. Amen. At the
end of every Evening Prayer and Communion, The Peace of God, which passes all
understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God; and
of his Son JESUS Christ our LORD. And the blessing of God Almighty, the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost be amongst you, and remain with you
always. Amen. In the Apostles Creed, (repeated every Morning and Evening
prayer.) I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and
in JESUS CHRIST* his only Son our LORD, which was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, etc. I believe in the Holy Ghost, etc. And in the Nicen^ Creed, used
every Sunday and Holiday (to omit A^^ana^ius his Creed, the Letany, Form of
Baptism, the Collect, Epistle and Gosple Trinity Sunday, they are all
mentioned together) I believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven
and earth, etc. and in one LORD JESUS Christ the only begotten Son of God,
begotten of the Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God
of very God, being of one substance with the Father, etc. And I believe in the
Holy Ghost the LORD and giver of Light, proceeding from the Father and the Son;
who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified. If any
Pagan, Turk, Jew or sober judicious Christian should come into our Churches
when these Prayers, Creeds, are read* and observe both Ministers and People to
bow their Bodies, Heads, Knees, with extraordinary reverence and adoration at
and to the Name Jesus only, when mentioned in them, but not at or to his other
Names Lord, Christ, only SON of GOD, God, very God, thus coupled with, and
immediately preceding, following his Name Jesus, yea not to bow to the person
of Jesus as represented to them by these other glorious Names: nor at the Name
God, as it comprehends the whole Trinity in Unity, or denotes the persons of
God the Father, or God the Holy Ghost; nor yet at or to the name Person, or
sense, (to use Bishop Andrews words*) will they not all then necessarily
conclude and resolve, that this Name Jesus is more adorable* honorable,
worshipful, holy, divine, than all those other Names and Titles coupled with
it? Yea, that the person of Jesus himself is more adorable, honorable,
glorious, divine, when represented to our minds by his Name Jesus, than by his
other Names, Titles of Christ, Son, Son of God, LORD, GOD, very God? That
this Name Jesus it self adds special adoration, veneration, honor, worship to
his Person, Deity; not his Person, Deity to his Name? or that his Person, Deity
accumulate more honor, glory and worship to this Name alone, than to all or
any of his other Names, Titles? Yea would not those Infidells conceive, that
Jesus was one Person, thing, and God, Christ, Lord, Son of God, etc. another
Person or thing inferior to, and less venerable, adorable than Jesus? And
that the Person of Jesus who is only thus devoutly bowed to when his name
Jesus is recited in these Prayers, Creeds, is exalted far above God the Father,
and God the Holy Ghost, whose names and Persons are neither thus adored,
worshipped, bowed to, nor honored by them, when thus coupled, recited, and
represented to our minds at once in one Sentence, Prayer, Creed? And does not
this bowing directly contradict those very Creeds, wherein we profess these
three Persons to be coet^rnal together and coequal, to be neither greater nor
less than another, and the Holy Ghost with the Father and the Son together to
be worshipped and glorified? No doubt it does in a very high degree, a^ every
man's Conscience upon serious deliberation will inform him; and these ensuing
Histories in some so^^ demonstrate.

It i^ storied of (...) Eccles. Hist. lib. 5. cap 16. Centar Magd. 4 col. 994.
Amphilochius, Bishop of Iconium, that to c^nvince the Emperor T^eodosius of
hi^ Error in tollerating the Arrians (who den^ed the Deity of Christ the Son of
God, whom they adored not* with divine worship, but only God the Father) that
coming one day to his Court, and beholding Theodosius, and his Son Arcadius,
newly made joint Emperor, and invested in equal imperial Power with his
Father, standing both together; he pu^posely bow^d himself and made low and
accustomed reverence to Theodosius the Father, without doing any reverence to,
or taking notice of Arcadius his Son and Fellow Emperor, in equal honor and
power with him. Whereupon Theodosius being very angry with this Bp. for this
contempt and neglect of his Son Arcadius in not bowing and doing any obeisance
to him, and sharply reprehending him for it as an injury and affront to
himself; Amphilochius wisely replied, that he did it on set purpose: and then
said, Thou see hereby, O Emperor, how hardly thou suffer the ignominy and
neglect of thy Son, yea verily thou art exceeding angry with those who insult
over, and refuse to reverence him; I would therefore have thee believe me, that
God the Governor of this World, does in like manner detest those who adore not
and speak blasphemies against his only Son* and that he hates them as
ungrateful toward their Savior and Patron. Whose purpose when the Emperor
had by this means understood, admiring both his Deeds and his Words, he
forthwith made a Law, prohibiting the Assemblies of the Arrian Heretics. And
may we not then justly fear, by parity of reason, that God the Father, and God
the Holy Ghost will, be as much offended with those, who bow and do Divine
adoration and reverence only to Jesus the Son when ever this Name of his is
mentioned, and yet do no reverence of bowing or adoration to the Father, or
Holy Spirit when their Names are mentioned and Persons represented to their
minds together with, or before or after the Name, Person of Jesus, in the
self-same Chapter, Sermon, Collect, Prayer, Creed, or Verse? No doubt they will.

Mr. Fox records of our Archbishop Cranmer, Bishop Ridley, and Bishop Latymer,
that when they were brought before the Popes, Cardinal Pool^, and Queen Mary's
Commissioners at Oxford, sitting jointly together upon them to convince and
condemn them of Heresy, they all severally of set purpose, put off their Caps,
and bowed their Bodies and Knees with great reverence and humility to the
Queens Commissioners, but would neither put off their Caps, nor bow their
Bodies or Knees to the Popes and Cardinals Commissioners, nor show the least
reverence to them, because they had abjured and renounced the Popes authority;
Whereat those proud Commissioners were so incensed, as taking it for an high
contumacy and affront to the Popes, Cardinals Persons and Authorities (whom
they then represented) that they not only* severally and openly reprehended
them for the contempt, and expostulated the affront with them, but caused their
Caps to be pulled off by their Officers; These Commissioners putting off their
Caps, and making reverence when ever the Fox Acts and M^n. ^ol. 3 p. 487, 496,
and Here, p. 42.
Popes name was read or mentioned, without yielding any such reverence at all
to the Name of God, Christ, or Queen Mary. And may we not from thence discern
and conjecture how much God the Father, and God the Holy Ghost are dishonored,
slighted, contemned, yea in some sort un-godded, and how far Jesus the Son
his Name, Person are advanced, adored above their Names, Person, when the one
of them is so frequently honored, adored, worshipped with bowed Heads, Knees,
Bodies, and veiled Caps by most, and the other two reverenced by none at all,
as if they were mere Ciphers; yea not so worthy honor, worship, as the Names,
Persons of Jesus, of the Pope, or of the Virgin Mary, at or to whose Names or
Persons, they only use to bow their Knees, Heads, and do obeisance in an
extraordinary manner and excess of veneration whenever they hear their sound?
Let all Christians then (especially those Bishops, Clergymen who are most
zealous for this Duty or Ceremony) take special care, that under the specious
pretexts of uncommanded reverence and devotion, they relapse not by degrees to
Popish Superstition and Idolatry, in giving as much or more honor to the very
Name of Jesus first, See H^^a, Offi^ium, ^sal^erium, Rosarum, ^it^niae beat^
