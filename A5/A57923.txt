A Letter sent to the Honorable William Lenthall Esquire, Speaker of the
Honorable House of Commons, Concerning the miraculous taking of Tiverton-Castle
with the Church.
SIR,
THis day (being the Lord's Day) after Forenoon Sermon, the General called a
Council of War, and agreed to Storm immediately; parties were drawn out to
fall on in their several Posts; and whilst the Council of War was sitting,
the Gunner with round shot brake the Drawbridge, which immediately fell down;
our Soldiers without order, or staying for their Ladders, fell on, beat the
Enemy from their works into the Church and Castle, who took down their bloody
Flag, and cried for quarter: Col: Talbot, Son to Sir Sherington Talbot, Major
Sadler a Renegado, and twenty Commanders more, and above Two hundred common
Soldiers are prisoners, Four piece of Ordnance, great store of Ammunition: Our
men gave quarter, though they blew up some of our men in the Church. I never
see men more resolved then they were at this time: This place is of great use
to us; not only in order to the straightning of Exeter, but to secure any
Ammunition, etc. that shall be sent us, and keeps the pass open to Plymouth.
To morrow the Army marches; Gorings Horse being gone toward Plymouth: I am Sir,

Your faithful Servant, I. R. Tiverton,
October. 19. 1645. This Bearer was an Eyewitness of our Soldiers entering and
carriage.



ORdered by the Commons Assembled in Parliament, That this Letter be forthwith
Printed and Published.
