The merry Maid of Middlesex.
OR,

A pretty Song made by a pretty Maid,
Which had seven Suitors, she her self so said,
And yet (poor soul) she has been strangely crossed,
And through her Mothers means, her Sweet. heart's lost:
But yet she is resolved in this Sonnet,
To have a Husband, whatsoer'e comes on it.
To a dilicate Northern Tune: Or, The Maid that lost her way.




IT was not long agone
since Cupid with his Dart,
Shot through my tender skin,
and pricked my lovesick heart
And since that desprate time,
I am so lovesick grown,
I neither can nor will
no longer lie alone:
Let Father angry be*
let mother brawl, and chide,
A Husband I will have,
what ever me betide,
It is well known that I
am fifteen years of age,
Yet live as weary a life,
as a Bird penned in a Cage.
Therefore Young Men I pray,
give ear unto my Song,
And you shall know in what,
my Parents did me wrong:
But now let Father frown, etc.
Seven Suitors in one day,
unto me came a wooing,
And every one of them would
fain with me be doing:
First Will the Weaver came
with Silks and Ribonds brave,
And out of his pure love,
these Tokens to me gave,
Let Father fret and frown, etc.
Full many a honied kiss
the Weaver did me give,
Which was enough to make
a dying Maid to live:
But yet my Parents would
not give me their consent,
That I should marry with him,
which makes me to lament.
But now let Father frown,
let Mother brawl, and chide,
A Husband I will have
what ever me betide.
The*second part,
to the same Tune.






NOexe Tom the Tailor trim,
he brought me a brave new gown
And wo^ld have gave it me
for to have laid me down,
My Mother* standind by,
would not thereto agree,
whereby I did both lose my gown
and sweetheart, woe is me.
But now let Father frown,
let Mother brawl and chide:
A Husband I will have,
what ever me betide,
Then Sam the Shoo-maker
brought me a pair of shoes
To sit my pretty feet
as he did often use:
But at the drawing on
his hand by chance did slip,
Which made my Mother vex,
and sorely bite the Lip,
But now let Father greive, etc.
George Glover he gave me
a pair of dainty Gloves,
Such as your bravest Batchlors
do use to give their Loves;
And therewithal kind heart,
he kissed me tenderly:
And then my Mother she did soon
break up our company.
But now let Father angery be, etc.
There came a bonny Lad,
a Vintner neat and fine,
And in his hand he brought
a bottle of Muskadine,
And bad me for to drink
as long as I could pull:
For he had an intent
to fill my belly full:
At which my Mother she
began to frown and chide,
Yet I will have a Husband
what ever me betide.
A nimble Tapster next
gave me a gay gold Ring,
And promised to bestow
on me a better thing:
But in the bringing he
had wondrous ill luck,
My Mother she did chance to see
and would not let us truck.
But now let Father frown, etc.
Then came a noble Spark,
a Soldier stout and bold,
And quickly cast into my lap
full sevenscore pound in gold
O he was a brave Young Man,
I loved him as my life:
and yet my Mother she would not
now let me be his Wife.
But now let Father frown, etc.
The Cobbler he poor fool,
fell sick and needs must dye,
Except my Love would grant
him love, as a remedy:
Cobbler my Mother said,
you have of late been dipped,
Before you shall my Daughter have
I Will see you soundly whipped.
But now let Father frown, etc.
A Maidenhead it is a load
too heavy for me to carry;
Therefore I will make all the speed
that ever I can to marry,
No matter for his wealth
nor Trade, what er'e it be,
For I will dearly love the Man
if he could fancy me.
So now you know my mind,
although my Mother chide,
A Husband I must have,
what ever me betide.
FINIS.
