In Math. 26. and 27. is fully declared, all, or the greatest part of our
Savior Christ's Sufferings, or passion: How the Chief Priests and Elders would
not release him, but Barabbas a Murderer; though Pilate earnestly would have
persuaded them to release Christ rather, but could not prevail; then he
released Barabbas: So when Jesus was scourged, he delivered him to be
Crucified. V.28. They stripped him, and put on him (...) Scarlet Robe, and put
a Reed in his right hand, and bowed the knee before him, and mocked him,
saying, Hayl, King of the Jews: And then they spit upon him, and took the reed
and smote him on the head, and after that they had mocked him, they took the
Robe off from him, and put his own Raiment on him, and led him away to Crucifi^
him. V. 34. At Golgotha they gave him Vinegar and Gall to drink: They that
passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, saying, If thou be the Son of God,
come down from the Cross. They parted his Garments, casting Lots for his
Vesture; that it might be fulfilled in Isa^. 22. 18. The chief Priests mocking
him, with the ^cribes and Elders, said, He saved others, himself he cannot
save; if he be the King of Israel, let him now come ^own from the Cross. One
filled a Sponge with Vinegar, and gave him to drink, putting it on a Reed, ver.
48. And jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded u^ the Ghost,
ver. 50. And behold the Vail of the Temple ^s rent from the top to the bottom,
and the Earth did quak, and the Rocks rent, and the Graves opened, ver. 51, 52.
Which when the Centurion saw, he said, Truly this was the Son of God, ver. 54.

POSTSCRIPT.
WE are taught by the Apostles Example, to continue in their Doctrine, and
Breaking of Bread, and Prayer: As often as you do this, you show forth the
Lords Death till he come, as he has appointed us, in the first to the Corinth.
Chap. 11. from ver. 23, to ver. 30. For I have received of the Lord that which
also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was
betrayed, took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of
me. After the same manner also he took the Cup, when he had supped, saying,
This Cup is the New Testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink it,
in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
do show the Lords death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body
and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of
that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eats and drinks unworthily,
eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords Body. This
is very useful for all true Christians, Protestants, whether Conformists or
Nonconformists, to Meditate on, and keep in their Houses and Hearts, and to
increase our Faith, and Repentance and Humiliation, and other Graces, as
Self-denial and godly Fear, and great hatred of all Sin, that caused the Lord
Christ thus greatly to suffer and die for us: We can never love Jesus Christ
enough, that so Loved us, as to become a Curse for us, to be made Sin for us,
and a Surety and Sacrifice for us; to pacify his Fathers Wrath for us, to be
our Peacemaker and Mediator: Oh let these great Sufferings of his be a means to
Inflame our Love to Christ, that we may love him with an enflamed Love, a most
Superlative and transcendent Love: Can we deny to give up our whole Hearts to
him, that was so willing to part with his Blood and Life for us, that by Nature
were Enemies to him? yet now he has Reconciled us by the Death of his Cross.

Reader, I can Testify that these Scriptures were long since Collected by an
able Hand, that was so well Versed and Read in the Scripture, from Genesis to
the Revelation, that he might be called a second Apollo, Mighty in the
Scripture, namely Mr. Clement Cotton, who did Publish that very useful large
Concordance of the Bible, and other good Books called The Mirror of Martyrs,
and None but Christ.

All those that have read it, are desired to commend it to their Christian
Friends and relations.
