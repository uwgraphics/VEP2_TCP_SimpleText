OBSERVATIONS UPON THE CITIES OF LONDON AND ROME.

By Sir WILLIAM PETTY, Fellow of the Royal Society.

LONDON, Printed for Henry Mortlocke, at the Phoenix in St. Paul's Churchyard,
and I. Lloyd, in the middle Exchange next Salisbury-House in the Strand. 1687.

OBSERVATIONS UPON THE CITIES OF LONDON and ROME.
1. THAT before the year 1630, the Christnings at London exceeded the Burials
of the same, but about the year 1655 they were scarce half; and now about two
thirds.

2. Before the Restoration of Monarchy in England, Anno 1660, the People of
Paris were more than those of London and Dublin put together, whereas now, the
People of London are more than those of Paris and Rome, or of Paris and Rouen.

3. Anno 1665 one fifth part of the then People of London or 97 thousand died
of the Plague, and in the next year 1666, 13 thousand Houses or one fifth part
of all the Housing of London were burnt also.

4. At the Birth of Christ, old Rome was the greatest City of the World, and
London the greatest at the Coronation of King James the Second, and near 6
times as great as the present Rome, wherein are 119 thousand Souls besides Jews.

5. In the years of King Charles the Second his death and King James the Second
his Coronation (which were neither of them remarkable for extraordinary
Sickliness or Healthfulness) the Burials did wonderfully agree, viz. Anno 1684,
they were 23202, and Anno 1685 they were 23222, the Medium whereof is 23212.
And the Christnings did very wonderfully agree also, having been Anno 1684,
14702, and Anno 1685, 14732, the Medium whereof is 14716, which consistence was
never seen before, the said number of 23212 Burials making the People of London
to be 696360, at the rate of one Dying per annum out of 30.

6. Since the great Fire of London, Anno 1666 about 7 parts of 15 of the
present vast City has been new built, and is with its People increased near
one half, and become equal to Paris and Rome put together, the one being the
Seat of the great French Monarchy and the other of the Papacy.

FINIS.
