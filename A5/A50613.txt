The Mending of a Clause in the Bill relating the Irish Forfeitures, that Cuts
off Remainders and Reversions, expectant on Forfeited Estates Intail; Humbly
offered to the Consideration of the Honorable the House of Commons.
THE Clause in the Bill that Cuts off Remainders and Reversions, Expectant upon
Forfeited Estates Intail, is so worded, that this Case may happen; as really it
has: The King Seized of an Estate, which the Forfeiting Person had Intail; the
Forfeiting Person Died some Years ago without Issue, whereby the King's Estate
Determined (being Entitled to no greater Estate than the Forfeiting Person
had): He in Remainder Recovered against the King, and has since Sold or Settled
the Lands on Valuable Consideration: Yet by this Clause the Estate that
Determined so long since in the King, is now to Revive and be Revested in Him;
and the Remainder or Reversion that came in Possession, and was after Sold or
Settled as aforesaid, is to be Cut off and Discharged. Therefore it is Humbly
Hoped, that this Clause will be Confined to such Estates Intail, now in Esse,
by Virtue whereof the King is Seized or Entitled.

The Mending of a Clause, in the Bill relating to Irish Forfeitures, that Cuts
off Remainders and Reversions expectant on Forfeited Estates Intail, Humbly
offered to the Consideration of the Honorable the House of Commons.
