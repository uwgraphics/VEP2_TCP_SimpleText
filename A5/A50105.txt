A Satirical Poem On the most HORRID and EXECRABLE Jesuitish Plot in 1678. FOR
THE ASSASSINATION OF THE KING, Subversion of the GOVERNMENT, Destruction of
PROTESTANTISM, And Introduction of POPERY.

Tantum Religio protuit Suadere Malorum? Also an humble Address to his most
Sacred MAJESTY for the Extirpation of POPERY: By a Loyal Subject to the KING, a
True Son of the CHURCH of ENGLAND, and a faithful Servant to his COUNTRY.

A Satirical Poem, etc.
A PLOT! Heavens bless us! will the ROMISH Whore
Never leave Teeming? will She never give over?
But like Impraegnate AETNA fright the World,
With fresh Granados from her Entrails hurld;
Or, like her Mother-WOLF bring forth a Brood
Of Miscreant Whelps, to be sucked with human BLOOD;
TO ravage the CHRISTIAN- Lambs with griping Claws,
A ravenous stomach, and Blood thirsty Jaws?
But, blessed be Heavens! The Brats of the PAPAL Chair
(In general) Abortive EMBRYOS are.
A PLOT! Begot in the DEVILS Limbo; come
Hither to life by the Midwifery of ROME!
Whose KEYS unlock all Conclaves, the deepest Cell,
As Beldam-Regent of the Earth and Hell;
Or if than Hell a worse place found can be,
There the JESVITS forged this damned CONSPIRACY.
Hells HEROSTRATIAN Firebrarnds! who Conspire
To Chymify the Universe by FIRE;
For, these IGNATIAN Bouteseus do bear
A Spirit only fit for the FIERY SPHERE!
A PLOT! of such a Tincture and deep stain,
That the JESUITS now prove very Rogues in grain;
SATAN'S prime Engineers; to Blow up STATES,
Undermine KINGDOMS, and Confound DEBATES:
Assassin PRINCES; make fond Fools believe
That Faith ought only to hung on their POPES sleeve:
To Holocaust whole Regions; Cheat and Gull
Their Proselytes with a Bubble, or a Bull; Bulla.

That CHURCH which can indulge such Monstrous Evils,
Owns a RELIGION not for MEN but DEVILS!
A PLOT! of such a Latitude; that cannot
Be comprehended, but a Name must want;
Nor cannot be CHRISTENED; unless understood
(By its Intent) Baptized in CHRISTIAN BLOOD;
But by the Monsters features We may gather
Its genealogick Title, Mother, Father;
And by their Salvage Dogmeos the World may see
The excellent Virtues, both of the Fruit and Tree;
The Holy JESUS never did ascribe
Lust, Avarice, Pride, as Texts for's holy Tribe;
Love, Piety, Humility, were the Lesson
Preached to the Disciples of his pure Profession;
Who acts not then, as JESUS does indite,
Is nor true CHRISTIAN, nor true JESUIT;
For the Red-Lettered PRIEST and LOYALIST
Are of the Society of ANTICHRIST;
Nor CHRIST, nor PAUL, nor PETER, did command
Rebellion; to kill Kings; or damn a Land,
To play the Wolf under a Sheep-skin, Wear
The Poenitents Conscience pendent at thy Ear;
In Stones, Wood, Meddals, GLASS, to make, draw, Paint,
Adore, and Invocate a GOD, or Saint;
TO Canonize, Malefactors, or dispense
Saintship to a BARABBAS, (for's Innocence.)
The GOSPEL expects no fiery Saints; but blames
That Zeal, that only does consist in Flames;
Religion (by no Rules of Holy Word)
Is to be introduced by Fire and Sword;
It craves no BLOODY Sacrifice, or to make
Its progress by the Faggot and the Stake;
He, that delights not in the Blood of Goats,
Thirsts not for Offerings, by cutting Throats;
Or Human Shambles; no Propitiations
Can be entailed from Heaven by such Oblations;
The Scripture prescribes no Inquisition; to slay
The innocent Souls, and make their Wealth a prey;
Nor does 't impose for Pardons Custom-Rates,
Or teach that MONEY opens HEAVEN'S straight Gates;
That PETER should stand Porter, or have leisure
To let in, or shut out, at the POPES good pleasure;
Or that his KEYS hang at the POPES Girdle; to have
A Patent-privilege to Damn or Save;
TO open and shut Heaven's Portals; Or with Spell,
And Exorcisms, to charm the powers of Hell;
That the Flames of Purgatory quickened are,
Or dampt, by the Breath of POPE JOANS grunting Chair;
Or to invade a PRINCES Right, by swarms
Of Libels, Treachery, or Force of Arms;
PAVLS Sword is thus ill used, nor's CHRIST'S Flock safe
Under the Virge of such a Shepherds Staff;
That the HOLY GHOST should act thus, cannot proceed
From the true CHRISTIAN APOSTOLIC CREED;
Such execrable Maxims cannot be
In the Faith of the CATHOLIC, though of the ROMAN SEE;
Whose Missals only may such Rubricks claim
With Characters fit for her BLOODY fame;
Whilst her Religious Politics applaud
For GOSPEL-practise, all that 's Pious Fraud!
Votum Illustrissimo Regi Carolo Secundo.
But, fear not, CHARLES! JEHOVAH is Thy Guard;
Whose Angels keep for Thee strict Watch and Ward;
Let Hell and ROME club Wits; the Superior fate
Stands Sentinel to protect Thy Throne and State;
So that Their DEVILISH Cabal no power has
Against Thee the Defender of the true CHRISTIAN FAITH;
The PROTESTANT Cause does sue for Thy Defense;
Armed with 'ts own Piety and Innocence;
Thy Loyal Subjects fear no Bulls, nor wonder
At any Excommunicative Thunder;
We dread no Hellish Machinations; All
Our care's to prevent, or to Revenge Thy fall;
And that Thou may our mutual Bliss retrive,
We pray CHARLES long may Reign, CHARLES long may live.
We ruminate on the past, and present Age;
The Laments of BELGIA under D' ALVA'S Rage;
The PARISIAN Barricadoes; PIEDMONTS Groans,
(Potent to work Remorse in the ALPS and Stones;)
Those doleful NUPTIALS, which FRANCE did keep,
When, for COLIGNI, BARTHOLOMEW did weep;
That horrid INQUISITION, which does rain
Both BLOOD and FIRE, in PORTVGAL and SPAIN;
The INVINCIBLE-ARMADO, and its Freight
Of SPANISH VILLAINY in EIGHTY EIGHT.
With horror and amazement, We Remember,
QUEEN MARY'S Reign, and the Fifth day of NOVEMBER;
The frequent Treasons to attempt the death
Of the Ever-bless'd, (Good QUEEN) ELISABETH;
Thy Grandfather; Thy Father; and what e're
Was destined by the IRISH Massacre;
Or the SCOTCH Rebellion; who first gave the Alarm
TO our late insulting Demagogues, to warm
Their hands by ENGLISH Flames; and teach them how
To kill THREE KINGDOMS by one FATAL Blow;
Whilst Church and State made headless, might become
A laughing Stock to the WORLD; a prey to ROME.
Nor is it unknown what Stratagems they 've laid
That Thou (dear Prince!) and Thine might be betrayed;
By Pistol, Daggers, Poison; and what not,
That could be thought by the Junto of the PLOT;
And (when almost the whole Nation was to be undone)
The late dismal CONFLAGRATION of LONDON;
Brave GODFREY'S Blood to Thee, Great CHARLES! does call
For Vengeance on those Barbarous PRIESTS of BAAL;
Were all whose Murderers in one bunch engrost,
They 'ld make too small an Hecatomb to 's Ghost.
Let EVROPE see Thy Justice is in grain,
That Thou wearst not Thy Crown, or Sword, in vain.
Be zealous to exert Thy Right; maintain
That, by GOD only, not by the POPE, KINGS Reign.
Since Thy Indulgence they abuse, Let none
Find shelter near the Shadow of Thy Throne.
As they denounced Our Doomsday, Let it be
Inverted to their own Catastrophe,
Make the POPISH Priests, and Jesuits, stand in awe
Of Execution by the SVEDISH Law.
Thus Thou 'lt prevent the Progress of their Creed;
And the future Propagation of their Seed;
Nor shall their Tribes of a Succession vant
In PAPIST Brats, or BASTARD Protestants;
Though Thou art Good and Great, Thy Self out do;
Be here, and be hereafter Glorious too;
Thy Resolution will secure Thy Own,
And strike a Palsy in the Triple Crown;
TO will please the amazed World, that the POPE should be
Outwitted, and Dethrone himself, not Thee;
That He Is no more infallible, but took
False Measures from's Red-Letter'd Pocketbook;
Redeem GREAT BRITAIN then from the ROMISH Yoke;
And make the proud Bishop tremble at Thy Stroke;
Unpearch the JESUITS, Kick them out of the Saddle,
And all their Cockatrice eggs will prove addle;
For, though their PLOTS (like BASILISKS) Kill, Concealed;
Yet, blessed be Heaven's! They die, when once revealed.
Extirpate PAPALISM; and then Truth shall
Unveiled triumph at the BABILONIAN fall;
Thy People grown Unanimous, and bold,
Will raise Thee Statues, not of Brass, but Gold;
Thy Empire then will need no other Arts,
Thou Wilt Rule Our Persons, Purses, and Our Hearts;
And so would Reign, Blessed by the Powers above,
Absolute Monarch in Thy Peoples Love;
And strong in this suport, Thy Arms advance
Not to Oppose, but to Re-conquer FRANCE;
PROTESTANTISM will own to Thy good Laws
The chief Protection of its Sacred Cause,
All 'ts Members reunite without the least Schism;
And POPERY prove the only Fanaticism;
PAPISTS the Sole Heretics; all else will be
Ashamed of Sects and Non-Corformity;
Subscribe to the Test, and manifest a Zeal
Fervent for the Church, Thine, and the Commonweal;
Let ROME, SPAIN, PORTVGAL, and FRANCE repine,
Whilst Thou do own GODS Glory, He Will own Thine.
With Bell, Book, Candle, Let the whole Conclave rail,
Or Curse; We fear not the Dragon or his Tail;
GREAT BRITAIN will take heart at Grace, and rise
In honor to be Thine and the Worlds Paradise;
Thy Royal Virtues then will shine at the full,
And none will need to crave, or fear the POPES BULL.
Our Loyal Hearts and Hands attend Thee; Thus
Thou, truly wilt Defend Thy self and Us;
This done, in Panegyricks we will Sing,
CHARLES does deserve to be more than a KING.
