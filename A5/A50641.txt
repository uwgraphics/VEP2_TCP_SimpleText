SHAPES and TRANSMIGRATIONS. AND Communicates Intelligence From all Places,

MERCVRIVS VENEREVS: Wherein he Relates what happened to him in His several
Shapes and Transmigrations.
THough the name of Mercury has been lately so defyl'd, that scarce a
scurrilous sheet has appeared, but it has assumed his Name; yet since they
have injured him only in his Office, of politic capacity, it is the more
pardonable. Reader, the Mercury you have so much heard of, I am, who do now
appear abroad, to show thee, that I have a natural, or physical capacity too,
though it be but a modern one, wherein I am as serviceable to Venus, as I was
heretofore to Jupiter.

It is not yet full an hundred years since Mercury made Vulcan a Cuckold, and
had first to do with Venus, ever since which time I am known by the pleasing
appellation of sweet Mercury: Since Paracelsus made me one of his Trinity,
constituting me the third principle, or creator of all things, I have been
sufficiently debased by his Successors; for whereas heretofore I played the
thief for mine own use, now the Chemists send me to the bottom of your pockets
to pick the money out for their worships; and though they give you nothing in
exchange, yet they call it transmutation: and if they would stop here, they
were as reasonable as other Physicians; but they send me of an errant into the
bowels, and bodies of both sexes, where I should, though an unpleasing guest,
so journe all my life, if I did not sometimes make an eruption, or get out at
another door, like that poor Queen, who sunk down at Cheering Cross, and rose
up at Queene-Hive: by this means I come to know the secrets of persons, of all
conditions and qualities, which for the public good I do intend to declare in
this ensuing Discourse.

First, then, that I may not be thought a Leveller, I will begin with the Lords
in Parliament assembled: Into one of whom I got admittance (it seems the
privilege of Peers protects them only from Law, but not from Physic) here I
expected to have been at the inventing of some rare Plot, agreeable to my
active nature; for it was just as the Scots Army had entered upon English
ground; and to that end, thought to have mounted up into this great persons
head, but I found that so filled with lead before, that there was no room for
poor Mercury; nay, I could not make him sensible of the dangerous courses he
run, so that I found nothing more certain then that, Ex quovis ligno non fit
Mercurius. We should stay sometimes three hours together in expectation of
what the Iuncta of Ladies had contrived, which we swallowed without bones;
whence I learned, that as the Commons are servants to the people, so the Lords
are to the Ladies: but this course of life was so contrary to my Genius, to sit
still three or four hours and do nothing, that I took the opportunity of his
yawning, (for he never spoke,) to steal out of his mouth and be gone; though
since I hear I might have stayed, for that they are now to sit no more.

When thus I had obtained my liberty, I found the Army was marching out of
Wales, to fight the Scots; then would I rather then my life have turned
Soldier, to have revenged the many injuries, affronts, and confinements put
upon me by Quacks of that Nation, who are more, I dare say, then of all the
world beside; but I perceived it was a harder matter to get into the Army, then
into the house of Peers: in sum, it was impossible to obtain entrance,
whether it were that they would not spend so lightly, or that they have all
handsome wives, (as most other Preachers have) I know not, but now it will be
much more difficult to gain admission, for as much as I understand they have
cast off their Doctor of Physic: well fare the Cavalier Soldiers yet, though
they are better born, yet they are not so hard of access; a Gentleman, as the
Play has it, is known by his Gentlemanlike conditions: this I am sure (my
friends of the Army) they would never have suffered themselves to have been
twice conquered by such Sectaries as you are, if they had been tam Mart, quam
Mercurio.

Being disappointed here, I thought to make my address to the Iuncta-Ladyes,
that I might comprehend (though amongst the Lords I could not, by what deep
and grave councels, this last Summers war was managed; but I failed of my
attempt there too) for they were so stricken in years (as wisdom you know, is
the daughter of gray hairs) and had been so accustomed to Mercuries service,
that they were grown (like Mithridates) proof against me, and knew by
experience that I was but like Herb John to them, and could do no further good
to their faces, or harm to their bones: all that I learnt here, was, that most
of the beauties turn wits afterward, as naturally as a Caterpillar becomes a
butterfly; and last of all arrive to be Statists.

Finding my self like thus to remain in Cuerpo, I resolved to do as Gallants
do, who when (in a long vacation, or plague time) they find themselves
destitute of the amors of gallant Ladies (which, you will say, is a hard case
in these days) are feign to betake themselves to Bloomesbury; so I, rather
then I would want a place to hide my head in, rendered my self at discretion
to my old enemy the Chemist, who when he had ex^^ined and tortured me, sent me
prisoner into the body of a fat Lawyer, who had not long before married a
Ladies daughter, by which match he became so much a Gentleman, that he was made
fit for my Company; at my first entrance into his head, I found all in
disorder, nothing but crabbed entails and cases, but I mended the conveiances
in his brain, and opened more obstructions then are in the sale of Bishops
Lands: at last, his little Law, and less equity, by the help of the
nimblenesse I lent his tongue, brought Jndy's home, for I put metal into him,
and he played they Philosophers stone, and turned all that metal into Gold;
had not he then a good wife, that could heighten his eloquence thus, and by her
practice mend his? One day my Lawyer went to plead at the Committee of
Indemnity, and as he was opening a Petition, I crept up into one of his eyes,
to peep out, and look about me, to see if I could spy any of my acquaintance,
and who should I first blurt upon, but a worthy Member of that Committee,
whose inward friend I had long been; when he savv me, he was so angry, that I
should come to affront and upbraid him there, that he silenced my Counselor,
and would never hear Petition opened since. Notwithstanding, my Patron was
not long after made Sergeant, and as he was trimming himself in the glass, I
could not abstain from looking abroad again, to behold by reflection his
reverend aspect, when finding his beard shaved, and a coife on his head, I
conceived my self to be a guest to one of these ancient procuring Matrons, in
whose corpse I had been so often tormented; and without farther study, broke out
at his nostrils in a sneeze, and carried away half his brains with me; but
the remaining half will be sufficient for him now, since he is to have double
fees.

When I was got out here, I bethought what could happen to me worse, and could
guess nothing, except I should be sent (as the Devils were) into swine. Well,
employment grew scarce, and Mercury cannot be idle: I was resolved to try my
fortune anew, and bound my self apprentice to an Apothecary, who presently
sold me to one of your renevvers of nature, or menders of Ladies faces, who was
a french man, newly come over to recruit, and lengthen out English beauties; My
new Master clapped me into a pot, with some other ingredients, and sent me to a
Country Lady, new come to Town, to take off her husbands Sequestration, from
whom she had received two things in commission: First, to strive to look fair
when she went to the Lords, and then to take care, she fell not acquainted with
the wits; and being by a great Lady addressed to my Master, and being supplied in
the first point, by spreading me as thick as bread and butter on her face, she
goes one morning to Westminster, to the lobby by the Lords house, but it not
being much past eleven, which is too early an hour for their Lordships, she
enquired the way to the Commons House, at whose door she waited, till a spruce
handsome Gentleman, powdered, perfumed, and set round with ribbons of several
colors, came out, to whom she makes her application, and cries, Sir, if I
were sure you were not one of the wits (as I hope you are none, for you seem
to be a fine Gentleman) I should invite you to my lodging; but indeed my
husband has given me warning of those naughty men, who they say, if a poor
Lady do but pleasure a friend, or be troubled with the rheum at the mouth, or
a cold in her bones, presently they make songs and libels of her, and do no
more esteem the embraces of persons of quality, then of a milkemaid, or a
Landresse: The Monsieur, with a low leg, replies, I beseech you Madam to
satisfy your self that I am none of the wits; if I were, I should scarce have
the honor to sit within the walls of this house: they alas are careless,
slovenly people; whereas I have all my clothes, powder, linen, nay, gloves
and ribbons out of France; besides, I voted the Army to be disbanded eighteen
months ago, with six weeks pay, and have ever since been of the side against
them, even since the Scots were beaten, and made a bonfire at my door, the
last 19* of November. And then Madam, it is well known, that I honor great
Ladies so much, that I am seldom out of their company, and had rather loose my
money at twelve-peny-Gleeke with them, though I see them jogg one another, or
be seen with them in a velvet coach in Hide-parke, though it cost me two
pieces in stops, or venture my health to enjoy the oldest of them, then be
plunged in the embraces of a young, fresh, innocent Country beauty, with an
Ordinance of an indemnity in her breech: more he would have said, but my Lady
was by this satisfied, that the Gentleman was none of the wits, which makes her
invite him to her lodging in Covent Garden, about eleven a clock that night: he
promised to obey the summons, though for the present he was much distracted
with public business; and had his head full of freedom, honor and safety.

He keeps the assignation, and comes; after the usual complements, she falls to
tell the story of her life and business, which is too dull for Mercury to
remember, and conculdes all with an earnest request, that he will tell her what
these wits are, that she may avoyde them: he easily condescends, and begins,
Madam, you must know, that before these wars, the wits were a Corporation, or
rather a Monopoly, for no man was suffered to be accounted able, or esteemed
for parts, if he were not free of their company, or at least, had license from
them; They set up some for School Divinty and Fathers; Others for inventing
new Religions; Some for Politicians; The inferior sort, for Poltry, and all
for Scepticks. Hither all the young Courtiers, and Innes of Court men made
their address, to know whether they might like the last new play or no?
whether such a Lady might be cride up for a wit? or such a new face rankt among
the beauties? whether such a work was well written? and they gave out their
orders, as duly as Sion College did* what Doctrine was to be preached. These
was were esteemed and honored every where but at the Court, where they were
abominably laughed at; notwithstanding some of them repented since, were
converted from being wits, and dyed in the Kings service; Those that remain of
them, are so few, and so scattered, that they are not able to set up; such of
them as are of the Kings side, are all to be Secretaries of State, the rest are
about this Town; you may know them by their discourses of the affairs and
resolutions of Christendom, by their curiosity and desire to see strange
things, by their crying down our English ways and behavior, by their
invectives against the Ladies of this Town; a Lady cannot whisper in Company,
but they are so malicious, that it must be an appointment, or at least, want of
breeding; If a Countess talk aloud, swear, or drink a quart of Sack at a
meeting, they will help her into a Lampoon; In sum, the poor beauties of
this Age stand in more awe of them, then they do of Obadiah. If a Lady slip
aside at a ball, and be lost two hours with her Gallant, the wits find her
out: If a maid be but out of Town three months, or a young widow leave off
her buske, they will be playing the Philosophers, and searching out the cause.
A great Lady cannot eat her breakfast in bed, and dine within an hour after,
make one colation at Hide-Parke, and another at Spring-Garden, and then go to
a great Supper at Picadilly, or the Bear, and at last, be entertained with a
Banquet on the water, and this not above six times a week, but these will be
apt to think her a glutton. And then they will make you such Encomiums of the
Ladies of Queen Elizabeth's time, who understood worth, and esteemed men of
parts (and those they would have you conceive to be such as themselves) they
tell you that then an Anagram on a Mistresses name, or a Sonnet to her could
prevail more then all the Sullibubs, and Cheescakes of the Age; whereas these
women (they tell you) had rather hear one cry God dam me Madam, or whistle a
French tune, then have whole Arcadiaes made to them: then they will count you
long stories, what wise discreet husbands parents would in those days provide
for their daughters, and add, that now, if a young Gentlewoman do not marry a
fool, her mother will think her cast away; and if the poor Bridegroom prove
in time to have any Sparks of wisdom, is ready to put him for a cheat. They
will urge next, that there was no Lady in those days, but scorned to accept
Diamond Rings, to have Gowns sent them by Gentlemen out of France, to be
fancied at Faires, or be trusted by Millaners, for gloves, ribbons, or Spanish
red, or to walk in the Exchange to have sweet meats given them. If a woman of
quality be led in Spring garden, by a Gentleman bare-headed, you shall have one
of them break a jest, and cry, why should men be suffered in these days of
Reformation to worship in Groves? If any of them get admittance into a Ladies
chamber, and find her Sperma-caeta*maske, he exclaimes (by way of a Saryricall
strong line) oh what a case are we poor men in, that the whales lust must be
brought hither to inflame ours! If he find out her Sunday teeth, though they
be of purest Ivory, they cannot escape him, but he will cry out, What, must
both the Sea and Land Monsters, Leviathan and Bohemoth contribute to the luxury
of this Age? one to plaster the cheek, and the other to repair the jaw? but
these are sometimes scorned in their kind, for I am credibly informed, that he
who writ the Parliament of Ladies, dyed not long after of a Pryapisme, and not
a Lady, or Gentlewoman in this Town could be entreated to take pity on him,
and cure him: a judgment much like that, which befell the Author of Ignoramus,
who lost a living for want of a Lawyer. Then they are as hard to be pleased
with men too, and as censorious as Schoolmasters: They will allow a quibble
to be no jest, and cannot hear a gingle with patience, they dispraise you
Quarlles, and Withers works, and cry up Dr Donnes Poems, Coopers Hill, and Mr.
Mayes Continuation: And if any of them chance to be married, or keep a
Mistress, they are as vigilant over them, and as jealous; Here the young Lady
could hold no longer, but exclaimed, marry! out upon them villains, I Will hear
no more of them, I shall keep my self well enough from them, and adds, Sir, I
fear it is late, and you may have far to your loding, if you please to
accept half my bed, you shall be very welcome, for my husband says, he is so
confident of my affection, that he dares trust me with any living: The
Gentleman was somewhat startled in Conscience, for to say truth, his
conversation with great Ladies had made him stand more in need of me, then the
Lady: notwithstanding, recollecting himself, that his Covenant (as he was much
for the Covenant) did engage him to bring Delinquents to punishment, of whom
the Lady was one; he consented, and leaps into the bed, and she (as soon as
she had put out the candle) takes a cloth, and wipes me off from her cheek,
and shows me a way tovvard the fire, by the help of which I soon evaporated
away, and got my liberty, without being able to know what this vvorthie member
did in her husbands, or her business.

The description I had heard made of a wit, filled me with ambition, to be in
the possession of one of them, which was crossed a long time, for that this Sect
of men have little to do with Physicians; at last, by the help of a Baud, and
a Scots-man, I got entrance into one, who soon perceived what guest he had
(notwithstanding that the Scots-man cried, The Deel tack my sal gif ye gat any)
and would never rest till he was rid of me; it seems men of the same
profession cannot bear one another, which was the cause that we two great
wits could not live under one roof, so that by the help of an able Quack, he
made me be drawn by the head and shoulders out of his shin-bones; the example,
and miracle of which converted almost all the wits, and they are since
married; for though they are scattered and dispersed, yet they, like the Jews,
keep a strict correspondency.

The next body I got into, was a great masty London Parson, with a red head,
which was thus; this Patriarch was not so much of the Spirit, but he was
somewhat for the flesh too, which made his wife, out of pure jealousy send for
me, and put me into a caudle, to dispatch him; but as the devil would have it,
and the sins of his Parish, being brought to him one day, as he was reading the
Perfect Occurrences, to examine his Hebrew, and con his Intelligence by heart,
to help him out with his next thanksgiving Sermon, he swallowed me, but his red
head overcame me, it being natural for one poison to conquer another, and so I
could do him no harm: but he had little need of my help, for he never
preached, but he could poison the people without Mercury: he was a great driver
of State affairs, the Presbyterian members rid him, and he rid the City, and
begot Petitions, and Remonstrances, no man was a more punctual expecter of the
Northren Letters then he, in hope to be inspired from Scotland (for the Spirit,
as it did from Rome to Trent, comes thence every week in a cloakbag) and he was
once gathering hands to a Petition, to have the day of the Posts arrival
changed from Monday to Saturday, that so the people here might know their duty
out of the Pulpit a week sooner: When he inveighed against the sins of his
Auditory, he did it with so much scurility, that they could not be more ashamed
of them, then they were of him, for he vented Libells in stead of Sermons,
whilst they that heard him did penance, and his Pulpit was the chair of
Repentance for the whole Parish: when he chanced to preach before an assembly
of Ladies, he would confute open breasts, and prove black patches to be the
mark of the beast, and ever was in league with some Waiting Woman, or
Chamber-maide, of whom he learned the name of every pin and knot, the way to
put on their cravats, handcharchiefs and cauls, to pin their bought locks to
their rolls, and the very ingredients of their washes, dentifrises, and powders
to dry sweat (for it seems English Ladies must, like beef, be powdered, to
keep them from stinking) all which served him in stead of School Divinity,
which he abhorred as Popery, or Cavalarisme: when he came to any Lords, or
Parliament man's table (whom he preached into great places, as they voted him
into livings) there it was that he chiefly promoted the work of Reformation: he
visited every dish more strictly then the University of Oxford, and imposed
censures on the wine, and servants, but would not suffer Gluttony to be any of
the enumerated cases, nor cause one dish to be suspended from the blessed
table: when he was full fraught here (though most of the wives and daughters of
his Classis were at his disposal for their spiritual, and his corporal
consolation) he would sneake into a little blind bordell in Holborne, where he
would have three young wenches whip him; so great an enemy was he to the
superstition of Rome, that what that Church ordained for penance to take down
the flesh, he used to raise it. He married his eldest son to a Parsons
daughter, whose father soon after deceased, and left her portion in Sermons,
all of the Presbyterian cut, which being tipped a little with the story of the
times, and some new invectives against the Independents, would have served him
all his life, when behold a most sad accident; the Trumpeters of Sion (for so
the Kirk of Scotland style themselves) had just changed their old tune, and
learned another of the English Troopers, and had sent strict orders to their
subjects here, that no more Presbytery should be heard of in the Pulpit, no
more Independents delivered to Satan; this put him into great straights, as
well what Sermons to preach, as what Religion to be of* and if he have any, I
believe he is by this, a Seeker, for I came away without taking leave, having
persuaded two of his teeth to fall out to open me a passage, and make his
tedious discourses in the Pulpit less intelligible.

By this time you will believe I had need of a little air, which I went to
take in St. Iameses Park, with a resolution, that if I could, like the
Camelion, live by it, never to be a Caniball, and feed on man's flesh more:
when I came into the Park, it was Sunday after Sermon, and by reason that
Spring garden was by special order shut, and so the tarts and rhenish-wine
suspended till the next day; I found the great walk full of Ladies and
Gentlemen, and all of my acquaintance, which made me steal back again for
fear of being engaged; and as I was nigh the outmost gate, a lean chapfaln
Chemist starts out of the cockpit, snaps me up, and when he had conveied me
home, clapped me into a Pill, and carried me the next morning to a grave Member
of the House of Commons, of the Presbyterian judgment: the Gentleman made many
faces, and was very unwilling to swallow me, for (as I understood since) he
took me for the self-denying Ordinance; at length he past me, and I began to
comfort my self, in hope now to comprehend the true meaning of the Covenant;
but I soon found that he knew no more of that then I, but had trusted the
Assembly with the interpretation* and they the Scots; he never spoke in the
House till he received a nod from some of the Grandees of his luncta, whom they
needed not trouble themselves to keep in ignorance, Nature had saved them that
labor: He never spoke Nonsense, but he told Mr. Speaker it was the sense of the
City, and thought the best Government in the world, was a Commoncounsell; at
last I began to dislike the dullness of my clime, and resolved to be gone, and
thought to have taken my opportunity one day, when the House was divided, and
those of my Patrons faction went out, but he (conceiting that two vallant
Independents, who stood near the door, looked stern upon him) durst not go
out, but has been ever since for a balloting box, and was in mind once to
move the House, that (seeing he, and many more of his party had voted
Blindfold, for above two years together) those two Gentlemen might at least be
blinded, when the House was divided, that so people might go according to their
consciences: Well, thought I, it is not safe for me to dwell with a man of so
little courage, lest I be knocked; so when his nose dropped, I slipped out, and got
into the nosegay of him that was next me, who happened to be of the other
faction, he soon snuft me up into his nose, and thence into his head.

When I began to understand his secrets, I wondered to see him there, for I
found that he was no member, but unlawfully returned; and looking into his
conscience, perceived he was no Independent neither, only he had received this
light, that the only way to stay in the house, was to seem so, and his staying
there the only way to escape the coming to an account for fifty thousand
pounds he owed the State. Mercury was never in his own element till he came to
him, for I learned my old trade of stealing, perfecter then ever; I used before
to filch here and there, a bit from such as were not aware of me; but I was
with one now, who took all he saw, even from them that trusted him, and like
Midas, turned every thing he touched into gold. Then he had other trades too,
he would fall in talk with people he never saw, and make them speak against
the Army, which he adored (especially since their great Remonstrance speaks
nothing of accountants and would threaten to inform, except they compounded
with him: nay, he was the Grandees setter, to watch what the Presbyterians who
sat next him whispered one to another; he applied himself to the Congregations
too, would have been entered at the Orthodox Club at the Rose, but they were too
honest for him, and would talk all day of glorious lights, and steal at night
to a baudy house, without so much as a Lantern and candle; whether for
secrecy I know not, or covetousness; for he was so sparing, that two pence
roast*beefe in Hell was a feast to him, which he dispatched when the House was
up, for sooner he durst not go, though he should have starved, for fear of
displeasing the Grandees: This custom kept him fasting so long, that I began
to be in danger of my life (for nothing kills Mercury sooner then fasting
spittle) which made me think of dislodging, and I took my opportunity one
Sunday, as he was preaching in a Coach-house, in Vinegar yard, and came out of
him without a lavvfull call.

Reader, I should now descend, to acquaint thee with my several
transmigrations through the Ladies of this Town, with many of which I have had
not only a superficial correspondence (as with the sequestered) but much
intimacie too; I should relate how I was tossed like a Shuttle-cock, from this
Lady, to that Lord, from him, to the next waiting woman, and so to the Roarers,
where I learnt to stand bare to exchange women, and call Chamber-maids Madam,
and by them sent to the City, and so back again to Westminster. How I went
in the long vacation to the Bath, and how I past my time there, but this would
require a volume by it self, and would contain a Diurnall, or rather
Nocturnall of the women of this Town. But most men being so ingenious in the
vvritings of others, and malice being the greatest ingenuitie of this Age, I
fear I should not want Commentators, who would point out every Subject, as if
she were named, or glanc*t at, which proceedings Mercury abhorres; nothing
but this can sublimate me, and make me poison, by rendering that a Libell, which
was meant a faithful history: And though I am not ignorant, that if I should
take so bad a course, I might happily please more generally, then I displease;
the Ladies of these times having no higher pleasure, or greater Lechery, then
to hear one another spoke ill of, and to join in the defamation; yet all that
cannot work with Mercury, who amongst all his thefts, never stole any persons
reputation from him; and though he have much of a French man, yet he is unlike
them in this quality of theirs, that if they get possession of a beauty, they
cannot rest, till they proclaim her name to all the world: No, the obligation
I have to that Sex, is too notorious to expect such a return, they having kept
me out of Gilders shops, and Schoolmasters clutches (where I should have
made ointments for ringwormes, and waters for scabbie Children) to give me a
noble habitation in their own bodies and bosoms. Thus much notwithstanding,
to avoid calumnies, I am forced to say in general, for mine own
justification, That many of these beauties having made their breath stink with
talking baudy, would lay the fault upon poor Mercury. And as for the old
saying, that Ladies never piss, but spit only, though the modesty of that, and
all such expressions be wholly laid aside, few fearing to avow any evacuation
of nature, or to call it by any name; yet that Proverb was never literally
true till now, for few females of my acquaintance void any moisture, but at the
pores, and mouth: Sure, if I had been as much in credit thirty years ago, as
now, this Nation might have been happy, and have avoided this war, and undone
hackney Coach-men; for the Children of this Age (I mean stall of Lords and
Gentlemen) which will be men the next, will be of too delicate a constitution
to make Troopers of, and will be contented to travel up and down, in Chaires
and Litters. See then rare beauties the reciprocal obligation you have to
Mercury, who has not only changed himself into more shapes then ever Jupiter
did, to serve your Sex, but even of a God, made himself corruptible, to be
disgested by you, and converted into you, and your posterities; so that whilst
he lives, he lives serving you, and when he is killed, his desire is that he
may be employed to make Looking-glasses, that so he may ever be before your
faces.

FINIS.
