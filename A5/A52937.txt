Advertisement TO THE READER.
THe Reader is desired to take Notice, First, That the several Counties in
England are Alphabetically placed, and then Wales afterward in like Order; and
that the Noblemen and others (who by virtue of their Dignities and Employments
are Justices of the Peace throughout England and Wales) are mentioned but once
in this Catalogue, though they are inserted in each particular Commission; and
for the Readers ease, are placed at the beginning, under their several Offices
by virtue of which they are so qualified.

Secondly, That those Names that have this Mark * before them, are such as are
not of the Quorum.

Thirdly, That Richard Earl of Carberry stands in all the Commissions for
Wales, as also His Majesty's Atturney-General for the Principality; and
therefore named only in Anglesey. And by Judges or Justices of the great
Sessions, is meant their Judges of Assize; that being the term used for the
Judges there, except for Three Counties, viz. Denbigh, Flint, and Merioneth,
which are in the Circuit pertinent to the Judges of Chester.

Lastly, That the several Justices of the Peace in Cities and Towns Corporate
are omitted, because they are generally appointed by Charter, and not liable to
alteration.
