A PAPER Presented by diverse CITIZENS of the CITY of LONDON, Sept. 5. 1682. To
the RIGHT HONORABLE The Lord MAYOR And Court of ALDERMEN.
THE Citizens of this City having duly Elected Thomas Papillon and John Dubois
Esquires, two of their fellow Citizens Sheriffs of this City and the County of
Middlesex for the Year ensuing, and your Lord ship and this Court having not
caused Proclamation to be made for the said Persons to appear and take the said
Office upon them according to the Laws and Customs of this City; diverse
Applications have thereupon been made by and on the behalf of us and our fellow
Citizens, that your Lordship and this Court would forthwith cause the same to
be done, as in right and Justice you ought: Unto which after diverse and tedious
Attendances, your Lordship and this Court did Promise that such Persons should
take the Office of Sheriffs upon them as were duly Elected, according to Law,
and the Ancient Customs of this City.

And the said Thomas Papillon and John Dubois being so Elected, and not yet
called forth to take the said Office upon them, we do therefore again, in the
behalf of our selves and fellow Citizens, renew our Request, and of right
demand that your Lordship and this Court will forthwith cause Proclamation to
be made for the said Thomas Papillon and John Dubois to appear and Seal their
Bonds to take upon them the said Office, which we humbly conceive our selves
bound by our Oaths as Freemen of this City to demand, and your Lordship and
this Court by the like Oaths bound immediately to Grant.
