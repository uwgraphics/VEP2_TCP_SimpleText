ORATIONS OF DIVERSE SORTS, Accommodated to DIVERSE PLACES. Written by the
thrice Noble, Illustrious and excellent Princess, the Lady Marchioness OF
NEWCASTLE.

LONDON, Printed Anno Dom. 1662.

TO THE LADY MARCHIONESS OF NEWCASTLE On her Book of Orations.
VVEreall the Grecian Oratorsalive,
And swarms of Latins, that did daily strive
With their perfumed and oily tongues to draw
The deceived people to their Will and Law,
Each word so soft and gentle, every piece
As it were spun still from the Golden fleece,
How short would all this be, did you but look
On this admired Ladies witty Book!
All Europ's Universities, no doubt,
Will study English now, the rest put out.
W. Newcastle.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE LORD MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE.
MY LORD,
I Have mentioned in my other Books, that I think it not fit I Should Dedicate
unto your Lordship the Single parts of my Works, before I dedicate all the
parts in the Whole; yet I cannot choose but declare to the World how happy I and
my works are in your Approvement, which makes the pastime of my Writing very
Delightful; besides, it makes me confident and resolute to put them to the
Press, and so to the Publik view, in despite of these Critical times and
Censorious age, which is apt to find fault with every Action, let it be never
so innocent or harmless, or with any Work although good and profitable, yet
they will sting spiteful Aspersions on them: But I have heard your Lordship
say, that most men Believe themselves not Wise if they find no Fault with their
Neighbors Actions, and that it is as Easy to find Fault, as it is Hard to do
Well; It seems such men have more Evil in their Natures, than fustice in their
Censures; but your Lordship, who is full of Truth and Generosity, Reason and
Knowledge, will give your Opinion Clearly and Uprightly, and my Works having
your Approbation, I regard not the Dislike of other men, for I have Dedicated
my Self and all my Actions to your Lordship, as becomes

Your Lordships honest Wife and humble Servant M. Newcastle.

TO THE READERS OF MY WORKS.
I Know not how to Please All, that are pleased to Read my Works; for do what I
can, Some will find Fault; and the worst is, that those Faults or
Imperfections, I accuse my-self of in my Praefatory Epistles, they fling back
with a double strength against my poor harmless Works, which shows their
Malice and my Truth: And as for my Plays, which they say are not made up so
exactly as they should be, as having no Plots, Designs, Catastrophes and such
like I know not what, I expressed in the Epistles praefixed before my Plays,
that I had not Skill nor Art to Form them, as they should be, for that Work was
like a Tailors Work to make Clothes: But many that find such Faults, are not so
good as a Tailor, but meet Botchers or Brokers, to Patch and Set several Old
and New Pieces together to make up a Play, which I never did, for I thank my
Fates, all is not only New, but my Own, what I have Presented to the World; But
this Age is so Censorious, that the Best Poets are found Fault with, wherefore
it is an Honor to my Writings, which are so much Inferior to theirs; Neither
can their Dislikes Deterr me from Writing, for I Write to Please my Self,
rather than to Please such Crabbed Readers. Yet all my Readers have not been so
Cross nor Cruel, for there are Many, to whom my Endeavors and Works are
Acceptable, and the more Honor it is to my Works, as being Approved and Known
by Worthy and Judicious Men, and Noble Persons; But many Men have more Ill
Natures to Find Faults with their Neighbors, than Virtue to Mend Faults in
Themselves; also they are apt to Censure Other men's Wit, and yet have None of
their Own; the truth is, they are a sort of Persons that in Plays prefer
Plots before Wit, and Scenes before Humors; in Poems, Rhyme before Similizing,
and Numbers before Distinguishing; in Theology, Faction before Faith, and
Sophistry before Truth; in Philosophy, Old Authors before New Truths, and
Opinions before Reason; And in Orations, they prefer Artificial Connexions,
before Natural Eloquence: All which makes them Foolish, Censorious, and Unjust
Judges. Wherefore, I desire, these my Orations may not be Read by such Humored
men, but by the Just and Wife, which will be a Satisfaction to me.

It Is Probable, had I been a Learned Scholar, I might have Written my Orations
more Short than I have done, but yet some of them are so short, that had they
been shorter, they would not have been of Force to Persuade, whereas the
Intention of an Orator, or Use of Orations, is to Persuade the Auditors to be
of the Orators Opinion or Belief, and it is not Probable, that Forcible
Arguments or Persuasions can be Contained in two or three Lines of Words; Also
had I been a Learned Scholar, I might have Written them more Compendiously, and
not so Loose, but I affect Freedom and Ease, even in my Works, of VVritings;
Besides, I have Observed, that whatsoever is Bound or Knit Close, is difficult
to Disclose, and for VVritings, whatsoever is very Compendious, requires some
Study to Conceive and Understand the Sense and Defign of the Authors Meaning:
But I hope that Defect or want of Learning, will not Blemish my Work, nor
Obstruct the Sense of my Orations, nor Puzzle the Understanding of the Reader.
Only one thing more I desire my Noble Readers, as to Observe that most of my
Orations are General Orations, viz. such as may be spoken in any Kingdom or
Government, for I suppose, that in All, at least in Most Kingdoms and
Governments there are Soldiers, Magistrates, Privy-Counsellours, Lawyers,
Preachers, and University Scholars.

We have, its true, gotten a Foolish Custom both in our VVriting and Speaking,
to Endeavor more to Match or Marry Words together, than to Match and Marry
Sense: and Reason together, which is strange, we should Prefer Shaddows before
Substances, or the Spig or Tap before the Liquor, for Words are but to
Conveigh the Sense of an Cration to the Ears, and so into the Understanding of
the Hearers, like as Spouts do Wine into Bottels; and who, that is Wise, will
Regard what the Vessel is, so it be Wholsome and Clean? for should not we
believe those to be Fools, that had rather have Foul Water out of a Golden
Vessel, than Pure Wine out of Earthen or VVoodden Vessels? the like may be
said for Words and Sense, for who, that is Wise, would Choose Choice Words
before Profitable Reasons? Wherefore, Noble Readers, let me Advise you to
Leave this Custom in VVriting and Speaking, or rather be Silently Wife, than
Foolish in Rhetoric.

I have Endeavored in this Book to Express Perfect Orators, that Speak Perfect
Orations, as to Cause their Auditors to Act, or Believe, according to the
Orators Opinion, Judgment, Design, or Desire; But before I did put this my
Book forth, Know, Noble Readers, I did Inquire, to find whether any Person had
Composed and Put out a Whole Book of Pure and Perfect Orations, but I could
neither hear of, nor see any such Works of any Person that Composed and Set
forth to the Public View, a Book of Pure Orations, Composed out of One Orators
Own Fancy, Wit, and Eloquence. It Is true, I have heard of Single Orations, made
by Single Persons, in Single Parts; Also I have seen Orations mixed with
History, wherein the Substance of the History is the Ground of their Orations;
Also I have seen two Translations called Orations, but they are rather Orations
in Name than in Reality, for their Nature is History, the One contains
Relations of several Countries, in the Other are Relations from several Princes
of their Actions, or Fortunes, or Both, Expressed in an Orators Style; yet those
are not Perfect or Right Orations, but Adulterated, or rather Hermophrodites.
But perchance my Readers will say, I Understand not True Orations; If I do not,
I am Sorry for, and ask their Pardon for Speaking what I Understand not. But I
desire, Noble Readers, you will not think or believe, I speak to Illustrate my
Own Works, and to Detract from the Works of Others, for upon my Conscience I
Speak and Write as I Believe, and if I Commit an Error in this Belief, I ask
your Pardon, and if you Excuse me, I shall take it for a Favor and Obligation.

I have Written Orations and Speeches of all Sorts, and in all Places sit for
Orations, Speeches, or particular Discourses; and first imagining my Self and
You to be in a Metropolitan City, I invite you into the Chief Marketplace, as
the most Populous place, where usually Orations are Spoken, at least they were
so in Older times, and there you shall hear Crations Concerning Peace and War;
but the Generality of the People being more apt to make War, than to keep
Peace, I desire you to Arm your Selves, supposing you to be of the Masculine
Sex, and of Valiant Heroical Natures, to enter into the Field of War; and
fince Wars bring Ruin and Destruction to One or Some Parties, if not to All,
and Loss causes men to Desire Peace, out of War I bring you into great
Disorders, caused by the Ruins Wars have made, which I am Sorry for, yet it
Must be so, the Fates have Decreed it; and Misery causing men to be Prudent and
Industrious, by which they come to Flourish again, at least their Successors,
and to show you their Industry, I bring you out of the Field of War into a
New-built City, where you must stay the Building of it, for it will be Built
Soon, having Many Laborers, and after it is Built, there being a Large
Marketplace, you may stand or sit with Ease and hear the Orations that are
there Spoken; and by Reason, there are some Causes or Cases to be Pleaded, I
shall endeavor to Persuade you, after some time of Refreshment, at your own
Homes, to go into the Courts or Halls of Judicature; after these Causes are
Judged or at least Pleaded, I shall desire you, to Adorn your Selves fit for
the Court, then to Wait upon the Kings Majesty, and if you be
Privy-Counsellours, or have any Business or Petitions at the Council Table, by
the Kings Permission you may Enter into the CouncilChamber; but great Monarchs
having Many Subjects, whereof some are more Active than Wise, and more apt to
Complain than to Obey, you may hear the Petitions of the Subjects, and the
Speeches or Orations of the Sovereign, and after a good Agreement, Unity, and
Love, you may Rest your Selves in Peace, until such time as your Charity calls
you forth to Visit the Sick, and when as Death has Released those Sick Persons
of their Pains, Humanity will persuade you to wait on their Dead Corpse to the
Grave, and after some Tears showred on their Graves, and having Dried your
Eyes, and Heard some Sermons of Reproof and Instructions, you will be Invited
as Bridal-Guests to see some Men and Women United in Holy Matrimony; after the
Wedding Ceremonies are ended, you may, as formerly you have done, go into the
Marketplace again, and hear what Orations there are Spoken, wherein one short
Oration concerning the Liberty of Women has so Angered that Sex, as after the
Men's Orations are ended, they Privately Assemble together, where three or four
take the place of an Orator, and Speak to the rest; the only Difficulty will
be, to get Undiscovered amongst them, to hear their Private Conventicles; but
if you regard not what Women say, you may Ride to a Country Market Town, and
hear a Company of Gentlemen associate together their Discourse and Pastime; and
if you like not their Pastime, then you may Walk into the Fields of Peace, to
Receive the Sweet and Healthful Air, or to View the Curious and Various Works
of Nature, and for Variety of Pastime, you may stand or sit under a Spreading
Tree, and hear the Country Clowns or Peasants speak, concerning their own
Affairs and Course of Life; in which Shady place, Sweet Air, and Happiness of
Peace I leave you, unless you will Travel to see the Government or rather
Disorders in other States or Kingdoms, to which Observation I will VVait upon
you, and when all is in Peace, before we return Home, we will, if you Please,
enter some of their Colleges, and hear some School-Arguments, after which
return, I shall Kiss your Hands and take my Leave.

M. Newcastle.
A PRAEFACTORY ORATION.
Worthy Countrymen,
YOu know, that there is difference between Orations of fancy, and Orations of
business, as also difference between Orations of public employments, and
private divertisements; The one sort requires Rational persuasions, the other
only Eloquent expressions: and as there are different Subjects of Orations, so
there are different Places for Orations; and the Subjects of my Orations being
of the most serious and most concernable actions and accidents amongst Mankind,
and the Places most common and public, it has caused me to Write my Orations
rather to benefit my Auditors, than to delight them. But by reason I have not
been bred, being a Woman, to public Affairs, Associations, or Negotiations, it
is not to be expected I should speak or write wisely., the truth is, it were
more easy and more proper for one of my Sex, to speak or write wittily than
wisely; but it is probable, my Auditors will think or judge, that I have done
neither. Yet I can assure you, Noble Auditors, I have done my endeavor, and my
desire was and is, that every several Oration may be acceptable to your Minds,
profitable to your Lives, and delightful to your Hearing.

ORATIONS To CITIZENS in a chief City concerning Peace and War.
PART I.
An Oration for War.
BE not Offended, Noble Citizens, if I labor to persuade my Country, to make
Heroic Wars, since it is neither safe, profitable, nor honorable for it, to
live in sluggish Peace: for in Peace you become ignorant of the Arts in War,
and living sluggishly, you lose the courage of men, and become Effeminate, and
having neither skill nor courage, you cannot expect safety: for should you
chance to have Enemies, you would not have abilities to help your selves,
having neither Experience by practice, nor Courage by use and custom; for
custom and use work much upon the natures of men. And as for Arms, in times of
Peace they lie like Garments out of fashion, never worn, but despised and
laughed at as ridiculous things, and men of action like as arms, they jear and
make a mock of. Thus Martial men and arms in time of Peace are scorned,
although in time of Wars they only are a Kingdoms safety, to guard it from
their Enemies. Indeed, Peace spoils both youth and age, it makes the one sort
Covetous, the other Wanton: for aged men study only to get Wealth; the young
men how to spend it. Besides, it makes the Poor men Richmen's Asses, and Rich
men Poor men's Burdens. Also peace makes old men Fools, and young men Cowards:
for in long times of Peace grave Counsels are mere gossiping meetings, rather
idely to talk, than wisely to advise, they propound many things, but resolve
not any, debate not, but conclude, and sometimes find faults, but never help to
mend them. The truth is, for the most part, they rather make errors, than help
to rectify defects, and in Wars they had rather suffer calamity, than stir
for necessity; Neither will they believe they are in danger, until their
Enemies be at their Gates. And as for youth, Peace quenches out their Heroic
spirits and noble ambitions: for their only ambition is their Mistresses
favors, and they will go to no other Wars, but Venus, where Cupid is General,
where they only make Love-skirmishes, and are shot through their hearts with
glances from their Mistresses eyes. Thus Peace makes men like Beasts: for in
peace they feed like Swine, sport like Apes, live like Goats, and may be
brought to the Shambles like silly Sheep. Nay, it makes men not only Live, but
Die like Beasts, having neither spirits, skill nor conduct to defend themselves,
or fight an Enemy. And how should it be otherwise, when as the young men are
only armed with Vanity, march with Pride, entrench with Luxury, fight with
Bacchus, and are overcome by Venus? Thus we may observe, that all which causes
Peace, and takes away the courage of young Vigorous men, rots their Bodies with
excess, and corrupts their Blood with idleness, by which their Spirits are
quenched, their Strengths weakened, their Minds softened, and their Natures
become effeminate, which makes their Lives vacant, and when they die, they are
buried in Oblivion: for Fame lives in Heroic actions. And surely it is better
for Noble men, to have Fame than Wealth, and for young Gallants to have Honor
than gay Clothes, and more honor to have Scarrs, than black Patches, to fight
with an Enemy, than to dance with a Lady, to march to a Battle, than to tread a
Measure. And for the meaner sort, it is better for them to wear honorable
Arms, than to bear slavish Burdens; and how happy is that man, that can raise
himself from a low Birth, to a glorious Renown? Thus from the Noblest to the
meanest, War is the way to advance them to honor, if the common Soldiers
fight with courage, and the Nobles command and direct with skill, for which
their Posterity will glory in their Valors, Poets will sing their Praises,
Historians write their Acts, and Fame keep their Records, that after ages may
know, what Heroic men they were; and as for Kingdoms, those are safest that
are protected by Mars.

An Oration for Peace.
Noble Citizens.
THe Oration that was last spoken unto you, has stirred your spirits and
encumbered your thoughts with Wars, and your desire for War is such, that you
will not only seek for Enemies, but make Enemies to fight with, which is
neither Heroic nor Just, to fight with those that have done you no injury or
wrong; and what can be a more unworthy Act, than to assault peaceable
Neighbors? it cannot be called an honorable War, but a base Outrage; like as
Pirates at Sea, so you will be Robbers at Land, taking that from others, which
you have no right to. But say you have some slight injuries done you, If you
were wise, you had better wink at small faults than make Wars, which will
exhaust your Treasures, wast your Strength, depopulate your Nation, and leave
your Lands unmanured. Besides, Wars corrupt all good manners, nay, even good
natures, making the one rude, and the other cruel; and though long Wars may
make men Martial, Skillful, and may highten their courage, yet neither skill nor
courage can always bear away Victory, especially from a powerful Enemy,
unless Fortune be on their side. The truth is, Fortune is the chief Actor and
decider in Wars; and who that are wise, will trust their Goods, Lives and
Liberties to Fortunes disposal, if they may choose? Wherefore they are either
fools or mad, that will make War, when they may live in Peace. And give me
leave to tell you, that it is not the way to keep our Country safe, to make
Wars abroad, but to make our Country strong with Forts on the Frontiers, and
Ships on the Seas that beat on our shores, and to practice our men with
training, not fighting; and it is easier to keep out an Enemy, than to Conquer
an enemies Kingdom: for at home we have all Provisions needful and near at
hand, when in a foreign Country we shall be to seek. But say, good fortune may
enrich us, yet ill fortune will absolutely ruin us: I answer, War inriches
few, for it makes spoil of all; the truth is, War is a great devourer, for it
consumes almost all that is consumable, wheresoever it comes, and is like a
Glutton, that eats much, and yet is very lean; for most commonly the under
Soldiers are very poor, and the Commanders only rich in fame, yet not, unless
they have good fortune, otherwise if they have ill fortune, they are usually
scorned, at least but pitied, but never praised. Wherefore it is neither
Courage nor Conduct, that gets fame in the Wars, but Fortune that gives it,
and she many times gives glorious fame to Cowards and Fools, and blemishes, at
least obscures the worth and merit of Wise and Valiant men. Wherefore, let me
persuade you not to follow unjust and inconstant Fortune to the Wars, but to
live at home in Peace with Minerva and Pallas, the one will defend you, the
other will employ you, and both will make you happy in present Life, and will
give you Fame and Renown according to your desert, that your memory may live in
after-ages.

An Oration against War.
Dear Countrymen.
I Perceive, all this Nation, or the most part, their minds are hot, and their
spirits inflamed through an over-earnest desire to be in War, which expresses
you have surfeited with the delicious fruits of Peace, which has made your
reason, judgment and understanding sick and faint, so that it desires a
change, as from rest to trouble, from plenty to scarcity, from palaces to
tents, from safety to danger, from gay apparel to bloody wounds, from freedom
to slavery, all which War will bring upon you. The truth is, War is more
likely to kill you, than cure your surfeit: for War is a dangerous Physic,
and the more dangerous, by reason your Enemies must be your Physicians. But let
me advise you, to cure your selves with Temperance and Prudence, by which you
will flourish with Wealth, and grow strong with Wisdom: for wealth and wisdom
is the health and strength of a Commonwealth, which will preserve it from
destruction, For what is the strength of a Kingdom, but Riches and wise
Government? and what exhausts the one, and confounds the other more than War?
which for the most part is in Fortune's power, to order as she pleases, and
Fortune in Wars has power to puzzle the wise, and impoverish the rich.
Wherefore, Noble Countrymen, do not make your selves beggars and fools in
Warring actions, and ruin not your Country through the ambition of
pre-eminence or applause, or through the ill nature of Revenge; But be wise and
rich with Peace, by which you will become impregnable against your Enemies, and
happy amongst your selves; for certainly War is better to hear of, than to
feel; for though in Wars you may Cover much, yet in the end In joy but
little, you may have high Designs, but you are not sure to have prosperous
Success, and instead of being Conquerers, be Conquered, instead of being
Masters, become Slaves. But to conclude, it were more happy to lie Peaceable in
the Grave with our Forefathers, than to live in the turmoils of War with our
Enemies.

An Oration persuading to the breach of Peace with their Neighbour-Nation.
Dear Countrymen,
OUr Neighbors, the U. G. have done us many injuries contrary to the Articles
of Agreement made betwixt our Nation, by which they have broken the Peace; but
yet we, out of Laziness or Fearful natures, suffer them to make Riots, and
never stir against them, when we are so far from being Abusers, as we suffer
our selves to be Abused. It Is true, the first shows us to be Honest Men, but
the last proves us to be Fools, if not Cowards, which, if our Enemies know,
(for now they are but a proving, making a trial of us,) they will overcome us
without Resistance, and will inslave us in our own Territories, so that we
shall labor for our Enemies, and have no Profit our selves. Thus whilst we sit
still, we shall have a Yoke cast on us, we shall be bound in Fetters, and they
enjoy their own and our Liberties, which rather than suffer or yield to, were a
thousand times better to Dye; Wherefore, bethink yourselves, and consider the
danger, be not so surprised, as not to be able to help your selves; and if you
be Wise and Valiant, as I hope you are, you will be VVatchful and Active; let
not your Enemies tread you into the Earth, like dull Worms, or drive you into
Bondage, like silly Sheep into a Pinfold, but rather be as the subtle Serpents,
and dreadful Lions, to take your advantages, and make them your prey; Suffer
them not to be your Vulturs, but be their Eagles, let them not feed on our
ruins, but be you their Emperors to Command them, make them march under your
Banners, and suffer them not to lead you as Slaves.

An Oration against the breaking of Peace, with their Neighbour-Nation.
Dear Countrymen,
I Perceive, you desire, or rather are resolved, to be no longer in Peace, but
to make War on the U. G. for some slight injuries, which perchance could not
be avioded: for there is no Friendship between Man and Man, or the dearest
natural affections betwixt Brethren, or Parents and Children, or Husbands and
Wives, but will give some occasions, either by Words or Actions, or both, to
take exceptions, and to be angry with each other; and should they for some
small Offenses, or indiscreet Actions, break off all Bonds of Friendship or
Natural affection, Or should they endeavor to destroy each others Lives, this
would be Inhumane, Unnatural, Uncharitable, Unjust, and Irreligious; and if
near and dear Friends cannot live without Exceptions and Faults, much less can
two several Nations under two several Governments. And give me leave to tell
you, that if it be not Wicked, yet it will be very Unwise to hazard your Lives,
Liberties, Possessions, and Habitations, in War, only to be revenged for some
few abuses or faults, that should rather be winked at, than taken notice of;
But should you be Victorious, though it is probable you may be Overcome, yet
you will be in the end of the War but like Chemists, who to make some grains
of Gold spend many thousand, or at least hundred pounds, and ruin their
Estates and Posterity through Covetousness; so will you through Anger, and
desire of Revenge, lose many thousand Lives, and impoverish the State; but
Experience will tell you, that Anger and Rashness for the most part cause
Repentance, whereas Patience and Discretion many times bring men out of great
Evils; and though Wars begin Flantingly and Boastingly, yet commonly they end
Miserably and Dejectedly, at least of one side, if not on both, and the
Soldiers are more certain to have Wounds or Death, than Victory and Spoils:
and though Covetousness and Revenge is their hire, yet Loss and Slavery is many
times their reward; they advance with Hopes, but draw back with Doubts, and are
oppressed with Fears. But you imagine, you shall be Victorious, otherwise you
would not make War, for Imagination can easily and suddenly Conquer all the
World; yet you will find it not so in action as in thought, it is one thing to
fight a Battle in the Brain, and an other thing to fight a Battle in the Field:
and if I might advise you, you should fight only with Thoughts and not with
Arms, with Supposed, not with Real Enemies. But to conclude, this Warlike
Preparation or Resolution is not only inconsiderable and Foolish, but Mad, as
to leave and forsake your delicious Pleasures, sweet Delights, happy Contents,
dear Friends, and safe Habitations, which you enjoy in Peace, to put your
selves into many Inconveniences, much Troubles, great Hazards, dangerous
Adventures, and uncertain Successes in Wars.

An Oration to prevent Civil War.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
GIve me leave to tell you, I do foresee a Civil War, if not timely hindered
or prevented; the chief signs of this War are Vanity, Pride, Luxury, Ambition,
Corruption, Extorsion, Envy, Faction and Poverty. As for Vanity, Pride, and
Luxury, they are amongst our young Nobles; Envy, Ambition, and Faction, amongst
our Statesmen; Corruption and Extorsion, amongst our Magistrates and Officers,
and Poverty is amongst our Commons, as also in our Common and Public Treasury;
All which will bring our City and Kingdom to ruin, if the Disorders and
Grievances be not timely rectified. Wherefore Noble Citizens, and Dear
Countrymen, prevent your own ruin, by reforming your own State both of
public and private Mis-demeanors; but the chief Rectifiers must be the
Statesmen, Magistrates, and Officers; for wise Statesmen and good Magistrates
will not only endeavor to abolish Vanity and Luxury by their frugal Examples,
but by their wise and severe Laws; for without strict and severe Laws, wise
Government cannot be; also wise Statesmen and honest Magistrates will
endeavor to fill the public Treasury by just and regular means, and not their
private Purses by Extorsion and Corruption, for the one relieves the Poor, the
other starves them, and not only relieves the Poor, but is a means to supply
the public Wants, to guard the public State, and to keep the public Peace;
all which makes wise and honest Statesmen and Magistrates to be provident to
Enrich, and sparing to Spend the public Treasure, that the public State may
have Means and Wealth for necessary occasions. Also wise Statesmen and
Magistrates will employ the Common people to keep them from Want and Idleness,
which will keep them in Order and Peace; But the greatest good, and greatest
scarcity in a Commonwealth, is wise Statesmen and just Magistrates, which are
free from private Interest and ambition of particular Power, not making their
self designs the general ruin: but such men, if any such there be, ought to be
chosen out from the rest of the People, to Govern and Rule so, that Prudence,
Fortitude, Justice and Temperance, as also Charity, Love, and Unity, may be the
Bond and Security of the public Weal, which I pray the Gods to give you, and
bless you with Peace, Plenty, and Tranquillity.

An Oration to send out Colonies.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
GIve me leave to tell you, that both the Young and Aged Men in this Nation
spend their times idly; the one sort Sleeps away their time, the other Plays
it away. But it may be said, that Rest is proper for Aged men, and Pleasure for
Young men; I answer, Rest to the bodies of Aged men does well, and Action for
Young men; but Aged men might employ their Brains in Counsels, and Young men
their Arms in Wars; for aged Brains are wisest, and Young men's Bodies
strongest, and both may be employed in the Service of this Nation. But this
Nation is like a man that increases his Issue, and does not increase his
Estate: for this Nation grows Populous, but the Men not Industrious to enlarge
it. The truth is, we have more Men, than Means to maintain them, or Business to
employ them, which makes them Idle, having nothing to Husband or Manage, and
Idleness will in time make them Evil; Wherefore, if some of the wise Aged men,
send not some of the Young strong men, to make Wars abroad, to employ or
enrich them, or to destroy them, they will make Wars at home, and destroy
themselves and others for want of wealth and employment: for this Nation is
like a Body overgrown, or rather full of Humors, which requires Evacuation.
Wherefore, send some to Sea, others to march by Land, to seek new Habitations,
and to Conquer Nations; and men of Fortune will be more willing to go, than you
to send them, if you help them with necessaries to begin the War; and they
having nothing to lose, nor nothing to live on, will Fight without Fear, and
therefore probably destroy their Enemies without Favor, that they may come to
be absolute Conquerers.

An Oration concerning Shipping.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
YOu know, that this Country is an Island, and therefore it is well to put you
in mind of the Proverb, which says, Take care of your Ships, and look well to
your Tacklings, otherwise you can have no safety: for the strength of an Island
are Ships, which are the guard to defend it, not empty unrigged Ships in your
Havens, but good strong Ships well Manned on the Seas; for to have Ships only
in your Havens will be no security; besides, it spoils both Ships and Mariners
for want of use and practice. Thus the close Havens destroy more Ships and
Mariners, than the open Seas: for that which makes good Mariners is Navigation,
and the more Stroms they have been in, the more Experience they have gained. It
is true, it is a laborious and dangerous Profession, but yet it is Expedient,
both for security and profit, to those that inhabit an Island; for Islands
commonly have more Men than Land, and therefore require Provisions from abroad,
besides many things for Pleasure and Delight. But though Islands be not so
Spacious as Continents, yet they are for the most part Richer, for Shipping of
Burdens is profitable, although Shipping of War is chargeable; and perchance
you will say, that the Charge of the one sort eats out the Profit of the other,
unless you can make them serve for both, as for Traffic, and for War, which
in my opinion cannot well be done; for Ships for War will be too heavy and
unwieldy for Burden, and too bigg for Speed, as also too slow for Flight; for
Merchants do seldom Fight, if they can possibly Fly, not only that their
Wealth makes them fearful, but their Rich fraights would be spoiled, although
they should not be taken from them. But howsoever, Safety is to be preferred
before Wealth, wherefore Ships of War are to be considered before Ships of
Burdens, and that there be good Mariners and Ship-masters for both; and not
only to repair Ships, but to build Ships yearly, that you may be so strong, as
to be Masters of the Seas; also to pay well your poor laborions Mariners, and
careful and skifull Ship-masters, who keep you in Safety, and bring you Riches
and foreign Rarities and Curiosities for Pleasure and Delight; although they be
but Poor themselves, and have less or as little Pleasure as Riches, being for
the most part accompanied with Dangers and Fears, as much as with Want and
Necessity; the truth is, they oftentimes endure great Extremities; for in a
Strom they fight for Life, and in a Calm they starve for Want; for they fight
not like those that fight at Land, as Men with Men, but they fight with the
blustering Winds and raging Waves, where, although they get the Victory, yet
they are sure to be Losers, their Ships being VVounded, and their Tacklings
tattered and torn, and every thing out of Order; besides, their Spirits are
spent, and their Limbs sore, and their whole Bodies wearied and tired with
Labor, having nothing to Refresh them, but Joy that they were not Drowned.
Wherefore, Mariners deserve more pay and thanks, than Land-Souldiers, who
fight with Men equal to them, not with the Elements above and beneath them, as
VVind and Water, which are strong, fierce, and devouring: Besides, when Land
Soldiers get a Victory, they are Enriched with the spoil, refreshing themselves
with Luxurious Pleasures, Sporting and Feasting; whereas poor Mariners and
Seamen are forced to Fast rather than to Feast, having never much Plenty, but
after a Storm more Scarcity, their Provision being spoiled by their Enemies,
the Elements. But to conclude, the Seamen want pay, and their Ships repairing,
for which you must disburse a sufficient sum of Money to mend the one, and to
relieve the other, who deserve not only Pay, but Reward to encourage them.

An Oration for Contribution.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
IT seems you are Covetous, but not Prudent, that you are so loath to raise,
and so slow to pay Contribution-Money toward the maintenance of the Army,
which is to fight not only for your Lives and Liberties, but to protect your
Goods, and that every man may without Disturbance enjoy his own: but you are so
Covetous, that rather than you would part with Some, you will endanger the
Whole; and as you are Covetous, so you are Fearful, for you will neither
maintain poor Soldiers, that are willing to fight for you, nor yet go to the
Wars, to fight for your selves; you Fear your Enemies, and yet will take no
care to Overcome them. And give me leave to tell you, that your Covetousness
and Fear does make you Treacherous; for if you will neither help with your
Purse, nor your Person, you betray your Country to the Enemies power, also your
old Parents, tender Wives, and young Children, that cannot help themselves,
all which you betray to Slavery, leaving them for a prey to the Enemy; and not
only your fertile Country, and shiftless Friends, and near Allies, but your own
Lives; for it seems by your Covetousness and Cowardliness, that you had rather
have your Throats cut, than part with your Money, or fight in your own Defense,
which is a strange Madness, as to be afraid to Dye, and yet to take no care, to
provide for your Safety, nor to have Courage to fight for your Lives. The best
that can be said or thought of you, is, that you rely upon base hopes, as that
the Enemy may spare your Lives to inslave your Persons: But I can only say
this, that either you must Fight your selves, or Maintain others, or else
others will take what you have, to maintain themselves, to defend their Country.

An Oration to persuade a City, not to yield to their Enemies.
Worthy Citizens,
I Do not doubt your Courage in Resisting and Fighting your Enemies, nor your
Patience in Sufferance, nor your Care in Watching, nor your Industry in
Laboring, nor your Prudence in Ordering, and all for the defense of your City,
which is besieged by your Enemies, which you endeavor to keep out by all
possible means, sparing neither your Limbs nor your Lives; nor do I fear the
power of your Enemies, for, whilst your Courages, Strengths, Patience and
Industries be united together, it is more probable, you will raise the Siege,
than the Enemies take this City; for though your Victuals be scarce, and your
Ammunition wasted, yet your Temperance does supply the scarcity of the one, and
your Courage the want of the other; Only that I fear will make you yield upon
any conditions, is the Love to your Wives, Daughters, Mothers, Kinswomen, and
femal Friends, and not so much their safety, for so long as your Lives last,
you will defend them, but if you yield to your Enemies, by yielding to the
Women's Effeminate fears, if your Enemies do not say or think you base Cowards,
they will say or think you facil Fools. For give me leave to tell you, that,
though men of Honor, as Valiant men, will Fight for the safety and protection
of Women, not only for those that are near Allied to them, but for those that
are neither of their Country nor Kinn; Yet no man that would keep the
Reputation of Valor, will quit that Honor for a Woman's sake, no, although it
be to save his Daughter, Wife, or Mother from their Enemies: for a Gallant man
dreads more the name of a Coward than any thing in the world; and it is no
dishonor to a Man, to have his Wife taken and abused by his Enemy, when he
could not Honorably help her; for Force is no Dishonor, but a Base free Act;
for a man cannot be forced to be a Coward, nor a chaste Woman to be a Whore,
they may both have Misfortunes, Injuries, and Hateful abuses done to them, but
not Wicked, Base, or Ignoble minds. Wherefore, let me persuade you for your
own Honor's sake, not to yield through the VVomens desires; let not their
tears move you, nor their entreaties persuade you; for if you yield, though
upon the assurance of your Lives and Liberties, where will you wander to seek
an Habitation? for if you could not keep your own City and Wealth, it is not
likely you will get the like from other men; alas your Neighbors will shut
their Gates and Doors against you, for Poverty and Misfortune has not many
Friends or Hosts, for few are so Hospitable as to entertain either; and you
will not only find Charity cold, but those that have envied you in your
Prosperity, will despise you in your Adversity, and what Masculine spirits can
bear such misery, as Neglect, Want, and Scorn, and the Infamy of yielding
Courages? Wherefore, it is better to Dye in the Defense of your own City, and
be Renowned for your Valor and Constancy in after-ages, wherein your Lives,
Acts and Deaths will be mentioned to your Honor and Renown.

An Oration for those, that are slain in the Wars, and brought home to be
Buried.
Worthy Citizens,
YOu lament over the Corpse of your Friends, slain in the Wars, shedding your
tears and breathing your sighs on their Hearses. It Is true, they are natural
Showers and Zephyrus's airs of loving Affections and passionate Hearts; yet
give me leave to tell you, you have more cause to Rejoice than Grieve: First,
that their Death begets their Renowns, and is an Honor to their Memory to Dye
in the Service of their Country; for all men, that have Worth and Merit, would
willingly, nay, gladly Dye, to save their Country, or for the Honor of their
Country, and all Wise men will gladly quit a present, frail and uncertain Life,
to live Eternally in the memory of the present and future Ages, in whose
memories their Actions live like Glorified bodies, and Purified souls; for thus
they become from Terrestrial to be Celestial. The next cause you have to
Rejoice, is, that their Bodies are brought home as a witness of their Victory,
and their Deaths are their Triumphs, which are adorned and set out with
numerous and glorious Praises; besides, they have the happiness to be inurned
with their Forefathers, where by a natural Instinct or Sympathy, they may
mutually intermix and perchance transmigrate together; and since they Fought
Valiantly, and Died Honorably, they shall be buried Happily, and will be
remembered Eternally, and have an everlasting Fame, rejoice with Music, Bells
and Bonfires, and offer unto the Gods Oblations of Thanksgiving.

ORATIONS IN THE FIELD OF WAR.
PART II.
An Oration from a Besieged City, ready to yield, or else to be taken.
I Am come here to entreat you, that are our Over-powerfull Enemies, to be our
Merciful Saviors, that though you are determined, to destroy our City, and
possess our Goods, yet you would be pleased to spare the Lives of the
Inhabitants; for what profit will it be, to destroy numbers of defenseless and
powerless Persons, only to satisfy your fury, which will be satisfied with
Time better than with Blood? for though our blood may quench your present Rage,
yet it may afterward clog your Consciences, and cause a sorrowful Repentance,
which may disturb the Peace of your Minds, wherein your thoughts will be in a
perpetual War: for to Kill us after our Submission, and when we have made a
Satisfaction for our faults, in yielding up our City and Goods without any
further resistance, our Deaths will be but Murders; so that you will blemish
your Conquest, from being Noble and Generous Conquerers, to be Cruel and
Inhumane Murderers; whereas the sparing of our Lives will be acceptable to God,
Nature, and Mankind, and the Trumpet of your Fame will sound sweetly and
harmoniously in the Ears of After-ages, where you will get as much love and
praises for your Clemency and Mercy, as admiration and renown for your Valors
and Conducts; whereas your Cruelty will sound so harshly with such discords, as
it will beget dislike, and so much hate, as to bury all your Valor and Wisdom
in Fortunes partial and unjust favors, ascribing that to her, She had no right
to Challenge.

A Common Soldiers Oration, to take the City by Force.
Fellow Soldiers,
WE have been long at the Siege of this City, where we have not only been
obedient to our Commanders, careful, watchful, and laborious, as also Valiant
in assaulting, regarding not our Limbs, nor Lives, but we have patiently
endured want of Victuals, and yet for all this, the Town being ready to be
taken, our Commanders intend to rob us of the Spoils, which by the Law of Arms
ought to be ours, as a Reward; for those that Venture most, ought to have the
Greatest shares in the Conquest, and the Common Soldiers venturing more than
the Commanders, ought to have the Spoil: For though they Direct, yet it is we
that Fight, and win the Victory. Wherefore, let us not suffer them to make a
Composition, but enter the Town by Force, and plunder it, otherwise the
Commanders or rather the General alone will be the only gainer, and all the
rest losers; and shall one man go away with the Wealth, when as the poor Common
Soldiers are naked and almost starved for Want? Shall our sick and wounded
friends, that cannot remove, or be removed, nor help themselves, be left as a
prey to those, which they have helped to Conquer with the loss of their Blood
and Limbs? For no doubt, but those new-made Friends will be their deadly
Enemies, and cut their Throats when we are gone and left them. Thus we shall
betray our friends, and lose our shares, if they make Peace and enter not the
Town by assault: for to take a Town by Force, is a gain to the common
Soldiers, but little or none to the General or great Commanders; but to take a
Town by Composition, is a gain to the General and chief Commanders, but not to
the Common Soldiers; for we shall lie without the Gates, whilst they are
received in Triumph, where they will Feast, whilst we do Fast, and will be
enriched with Treasures, but we remain in Want.

An Oration to those Soldiers that are against an Agreement with the Citizens.
Fellow Soldiers,
LEt me tell you, that you speak against your own Profit, when you speak
against compounding and agreeing with the Besieged Citizens: for it is not only
Human and Charitable, Generous and Noble, to spare the Lives of Yielding and
conquered Enemies, but Profitable; for their Lives will serve you, and their
Industry maintain you; wherefore it is better, to spare their Lives, and make
Peace with them, also to take their Money, and spare their cumbersome and
combustible Goods, which will trouble your carriage, and hinder your march;
Neither can you make so much profit of them, as they will give you for them.
And as for their City, and Lives, it were a great folly, to Kill and Destroy
them to no purpose, unless to satisfy your Bloody minds, and furious Rage; for
Death and Destruction will bring you not any Profit; but if you give them their
Lives, and let their City stand, they will give you a constant and settled
Contribution toward your maintenance, also they will be Surgeons, Physicians,
and Nurses to our sick and wounded Soldiers, by which means they may recover
their former health and strength again, and be able to do their Country more
Service; but if they be left behind us, and none to take care of them, nor Men
to help them, nor Houses to lodge in, they must of necessity perish in great
misery; and we have no reason to fear they will be Cruel to them, because they
know we shall Return to revenge their Cruelty: Besides, they will be very
careful of them, and kind and helpful to them, to keep Peace, and to Merit
our favors; for Conquerers are always flattered, obeyed, and served with
ceremony, industry, and fidelity, so long as Fortune favors them. Thus you
know by what I have spoken, that it is the best for the Common Soldiers and
Commanders to spare the City and Citizens. And now give me leave to tell you,
that you are Unjust Judges of me, your Generals actions, and evil Censurers and
malicious Accusers, to accuse my Prudence for my Soldiers, of Covetousness for
my self, and my careful love for my Sick and wounded Soldiers, of an
insensible and cruel Neglect, whereas you might more truly accuse me for using
too much Clemency to my Mutinous and Rebellious Soldiers, wincking at their
faults, and pardoning their crimes, when they ought to have been severely
punished, by which they would have been better taught, and I obeyed: for Severe
Generals make Humble, Obedient, Industrious, Laborious, Patient, and Courageous
Soldiers, whereas a Compliant General quite spoils them; But I have showed
Mercy to offenders, Love and Care to the wounded, sick, tired, and weary, and I
have been Bountiful to the well-deservers; all which I am forced to remember
you of, because you have forgotten, at least are unwilling to take any notice
thereof; Yet I perceive it is the nature of most of Mankind, especially Mean
births, Low fortunes, and Brute breedings, to be Ungrateful, Malicious,
Revengefull, and Inhumane.

An Oration to Soldiers, after the Loss of a Battle.
Fellow Soldiers,
I Perceive you are dejected at your ill fortune, for Fortune is a Thief,
robbing some to give partially to others; wherefore we Soldiers, whom She
busies her self most with, to show her power and agility, ought to be so
careful and watchful, as to lock and barricado out Fortunes malice, giving
her no advantage, if you can possibly hinder her from taking any. Yet was it
neither for want of Conduct or Valor, that we wonn not the Victory, but Heaven
and Earth was against us: for the Sun, Wind and Dust beat on our faces; for you
endeavoring to get the side of the Wind, went against the Sunbeams, so that
with the Sunbeams and the glittering Dust, that flew up by the motion of the
Wind, we could not see, neither to assault our Enemies, nor to defend our
selves, nay, we were so blinded, as to mistake our friends for our foes, and
our foes for our friends; which tempestuous wind, had it been before we begun
to fight, we might have prevented the mischief, it did us, some way or other;
but the wind did rise, when we were so engaged, as we could not help our
selves; the truth was, it blew so fully against the main part of our Battalio,
and with that violent force, as it pressed the former ranks so much back, that
they did disturb the hinder ranks, and so disordered them, till at last it blew
them quite away; for they were forced to turn their backs and to fly for their
Lives, and when that part of the Army fled, others had no hearts to stay; but
do not mistake so, as to believe, that the Divine power was against us, but
only the Elements, and they were against us more by chance than malice.
Wherefore take courage again, and rowse up your dejected Spirits, and repine
not for that we could not foresee to avoid: for I make no doubt, but the next
time we encounter our Enemies, we shall not only get the reputation you think
you have lost, but we shall add to what we formerly had, and pull down the
haughty pride of our Enemies, that now seem to insult on our Misfortunes.

An Oration to Soldiers in necessity.
My good Soldiers,
I Cannot much blame your murmuring and complaining words and speeches, by
reason our Camp is vexed and tormented with scarcity, sickness, and
inconveniences; and although we cannot tell how to mend or help our selves in
these Extremities, yet it troubles our Patience, and somewhat alters your
Natures, at least divulges them more, making you Froward, Testy, Choleric; and
froward minds, and testy thoughts are apt to send forth out of the mouth
lamenting words and complaining speeches. Yet give me leave to tell you, it
expresses, you have partaken too much of your Mothers natures, which is not so
well for Soldiers, who should be no ways Effeminate; for Women naturally are
impatient, fretting, chafing and complaining without cause. I do not deny but
you at this present have great cause, and therefore some reason for what you
speak: yet I hope, though you speak like your Mothers, you will act like your
Fathers. Wherefore give me leave to remember you of Caesar' Soldiers, for
surely you could not choose but hear of them, their Fame being so great, and
sounding so loud, for their Patience, Sufferance, Hardiness, Industry,
Carefulness, Watchfulness, Valors and Victories, yet were they no more than
men, and I hope you are not less than men; But there are two sorts of Courages,
and they, as the Story says, had them both, as Fortitude in Suffering, and
Valor in Acting, which made them so fortunate in overcoming, as to Conquer the
most part of the World; and though I cannot hope you will Conquer All the
World, yet I hope you will have Victory over your Enemies, so shall you be
Masters and not Slaves.

An Encouraging Oration to Fearful Soldiers.
Fellow Soldiers, and Dear Countrymen,
I Perceive by your Dejected countenances, and Drooping spirits, you are afraid
of your Enemies; but I am more afraid of your Fears, than of the Enemies Power;
for fear makes powerful Armies powerless, and a Little Body with a Great
Spirit is stronger and more vigorous than a Great Body and a Little Spirit, so
a Little Army with Great Courages is more forcible, than a Great or Numerous
Army full of Faint hearts and Cowardly fears. Wherefore consider, there are but
three ways, the one is to Run away, but remember you cannot run from Shame or
Disgrace, though you may run from your Enemy; An other way is, you may Yield up
your selves to the Enemy, but then you must yield up your Liberties with your
Persons, and become their Slaves, in which slavery you live in Scorn, are used
as Beasts, and die as Cowards; The third and last way, which is the best, is to
Fight your Enemy, which if you Overcome, you will have the honor of Victory,
and the profit of the Spoils, and if you be Killed, you dye Unconquered; for
Courage is never Overcome, nor Gallant Heroic Actions never Dye, and their
Fames will be their perpetual Triumphs, which may last Eternally. Wherefore, my
good Soldiers, fight Valiantly for Life, Victory, and Glory.

An Oration to Soldiers, that fled from their Enemies.
What shall I call you? for I cannot call you Fellow soldiers, because you
have degraded your selves of that Honorable title, by Running away, which
shows, you have but Effeminate Spirits or Souls, though Masculine Bodies; Nor
can I call your Dear Countrymen; for you have Unnaturaliz'd your selves, by
Betraying your Country, with your Cowardly fears, to the power of their
Enemies; Nor can I call you my good Friends, for you did forsake me in Danger,
and left me to Death, had not Fortune rescued me; So that you cannot challenge,
nor I cannot give you, any other names, but base Cowards and Traitors, which
words cannot but sound grievously, sadly, and scornfully to your Own, your
Friends, and Enemies hearing: And that which will highten your Reproach, is
that you were not forced nor necessitated to Fly, as being Overcome, or
Overpowered; for you fled not only before you had tried your Enemies force, but
when in all probability you should have had the Victory, having all the
advantages of your side, and against your Enemies, that could be, as Ground,
Place, Wind, Sun, Form, Order, and Number of men, and yet to run away; O horrid
shame to all Posterity! The truth is, I am so out of Countenance in your
behalf, and so Sorrowful for you, as I cannot choose but Blush for shame, and
Weep for grief, when I look upon you, to see so many Able and Strong, yet
Heartless men, that have soiled your bright Arms with Disgrace, instead of the
Blood of your Enemies. Wherefore, you may now pull off your Arms, since you
have Coats of Dishonor to wear, and break your Swords, for the Tongues of
Reproach are unsheathed against you, which will wound your Reputations, and
kill your Renowns, and your Infamy will live in after-ages Eternally.

An Oration to Runaway Soldiers, who repent their fault.
Sorrowful Penitents, (for so you seem by your Countenances and your Words,
the one being sad, the other full of promises,) I must confess, it becomes you
well, for you have been great Cowards, and fearful Run-aways, which are Faults
that cannot be enough lamented, but your Actions may be amended, and so you may
have a Pardon, and your Disgrace taken off with some Valiant and Courageous
exploits against your Enemies, where I, your General, who am one of Mars' s
high Priests, shall guide and direct you the way; and you may rely upon me;
for I am well Learned and Practiced in the mystery of War. But pray be not as
flock of Sheep, making me as a ParishPriest, as only to Talk, and you to Run
away; for then I shall Curse you, instead of Blessing you; and though it be
requisite you should be as meek Sheep in Ioves' s Temple, yet you must be as
raging Lions in Mars' s Field, and the Prayers you make to Mars, must be for
Victory and Fame; but let me tell you, you must implore Pallas' s help, and
Fortune' s favor; and therefore, fight Valiantly and Fiercely, and take your
advantages Prudently, stick Closely, and fight Orderly, and leave the rest to
Fortune; which if you do thus, as I advise you, your Actions will wipe out all
former Faults, and take away all your Reproach or Disgrace so clean, as if they
had never been, especially if you have the Victory.

A Mutinous Oration to Common Soldiers, by a Common Soldier.
Fellow Soldiers,
GIve me leave to tell you, that although you have proved your Valors in the
Battles you have fought, and the Assaults you have made, yet you have not
proved your selves Wise, to leave your Native Country, and Peaceable
Habitations, only to fight with Foreiners, who are as Industrious, Valiant, and
Active to overcome and kill you, as you to overcome and kill them; and what do
we fight and hazard our Lives for? not for Riches; for what we get, we are
subject to lose again, and should we get Riches, we should soon consume them,
having no settled abiding to thrive upon the Stock, or to get out use of the
Principal, nor to have any returns by Traffic or Commerce, but those spoils we
can get, are only Cumbersome Goods, which we are forced to fling away in times
or places of Danger, or when we make sudden or long Marches; and albeit we
could easily and safely carry them along with us, yet we should make but Small
Profit of them, and get Little ready Money for them, although they were not
spoiled in the Carriage. By this we may know, the Wars will not Enrich us; and
as for Fame, Common Soldiers are never mentioned, although they are the only
Fighters, but thousands sands of them, when Killed, are buried in Oblivions
grave, and no other Burial they have; for their slain Bodies for the most part
lie and rot above ground, or are devoured by Carrion-birds or Ravenous Beasts;
but the Fame or Renown is given to the General alone, some Under-Commanders may
chance to be Slightly mentioned, but not Gloriously famed; And if you can
neither get Wealth nor Honor, in or by the Wars, why-Should you be Soldiers?
Wherefore, let us return home, and rather be Plowmen in our Own Country, than
Soldiers in a Foreign Nation, rather feed with our own Labors, than starve at
our Generals Command, and rather choose to die Peaceably, than to live in the
War, wherein is nothing to be gotten, but Scarrs and Wounds; where we may lose
our Limbs and Lives, but not make our Fortunes.

An Oration to stay the Soldiers from a Mutinous return from the Wars.
Fellow Soldiers, and Dear Countrymen,
THe Soldier that spoke to persuade you to mutiny, as to leave the Wars
dishonorably, by his speech, any man of Courage would believe he were a Coward:
for no man of Courage would leave an Enemy in the Field, for that would be as
bad as Running away; and will you, who have gotten Honorable Renown by the
Wars, quit that Renown for Disgrace? Shall the speech of a Cowardly, Idle,
Base man persuade you more than your Reputations? can any man Live, Act, or Dye
more honestly than in the Service of his Country? besides, it will not only be
a Disgrace to You, and also a Disgrace to your Country, to leave the Wars, but
you will endanger your Country; for no question, but your Enemies will follow
you at the heels, so that instead of carrying home Victory and Spoils, you will
carry home Danger, and perchance Ruin, betraying your Country by Faction,
Mutiny, or Cowardly fears. Thus, although you came out of your Country
Soldiers, you will return Traitors. But should they not Follow you, they would
Scorn you, and your Friends would Despise you at your return, and what is worse
than to be Scorned and Despised of Enemies and Friends? when as by your Gallant
actions the one would be Afraid, the other Proud of you. And let me tell you,
to be a Soldier, is the noblest Profession; for it makes Mean men as Princes,
and those Princes that are not Soldiers, are as Mean men; and though Fame does
not mention every particular Soldier, but generally all together, yet the
memory of every particular Soldier and their particular Actions never die, as
long as their Successors live; for their Children mention their Forefathers
Valiant Actions with Pride, Pleasure, and Delight, and Glory that they
descended from such worthy Ancestors; and as for Scarrs gotten in the Wars,
they are such Graces and becoming Marks, as they Woo and Win a Mistress, and
gain her Favor, sooner than Wealth, Title, or Beauty does. But I hope you will
neither show your selves Cowards, nor prove your selves Traitors, by leaving
the War when you ought to follow it.

A Generals Oration to his Mutinous Soldiers.
Fellow Soldiers,
I Hear you Murmur, Complain, and Speak against me, forgetting your Respects,
Obedience, Duty, and Fidelity to me your General; for which I am sorry, not for
my Self, but for my Soldiers; for I am never the worse for my Soldiers being
evil; but I am sorry, my Soldiers are not what they ought to be; and though I
do not wonder at the Disobedience of my Common Soldiers, yet I cannot but
wonder at the Baseness of my Officers and Under-Commanders; for though
Inferior Men have inferior Minds, rude and wild Natures, and barbarous
Manners, yet Men of quality usually have Generous, and noble Minds, gentle
Natures, and civil Manners, and of all men, Gallant Soldiers have the noblest
Minds, and ought to have the reformedst Manners; for though Heroic men fight
in Blood to kill their Enemies, yet they will spill their Blood, and sacrifize
their Lives for their Friends, Country, or Countrymen, as also for Honor,
Generosity, and Fame, and they will rather choose to endure all kind or manner
of Torments, and to die a thousand, nay, millions of Deaths if it could be,
than to do one act of Dishonor, or that is not fit for a man of Honor to do;
Indeed Heroic and Honorable men are petty Gods, whereas other men are Beasts,
the one having Celestial natures, the other Terrestrial. But by your mutinous
speeches, I perceive, I have not those Gallant, Noble, Generous, and Valiant
Soldiers, as I thought I had in this my Army, which I am sorry for especially
that there is none like my Self; for I utterly Renounce all Actions or Thoughts
that ought not be to be done by Worthy men, or to be inherent in Worthy men; I
hate Treachery, as I hate Cowardliness, and I hate Cowardliness, as I hate
Disgrace, or Infamy, and I hate Infamy worse than Oblivion; for Oblivion is the
Hell of Meritorious and Gallant men; and as I prefer after-Memory, which is
Fame, before present Life, which Fame is the Heaven wherein Worthy and
Honorable men and actions are Glorified, and live to all Eternity, so would I
have my Soldiers there to Live, and be Glorified; which Desire expresses, that
I love my Soldiers equal with my Self; and as I do prefer Honor and Fame
before sensual Pleasures or Life, so I have always preferred my Soldiers
Lives before my Own; for I never endeavored to save my own Life, when my
Soldiers Lives were in Danger, but have put my person in the same danger they
were in, nay, I have ventured One more danger than they have done; for I have
led them Singly to the face and front of their Enemies; neither have I been
Idle, when as my Soldiers have taken pains, but to the contrary I have taken
pains, when as they have been Idle; for my Person has not only been employed
in Ordering, Appointing, and Directing of every particular, but I have marched
on Foot with the Infantery, whilst the Cavallry has Rid easily on Horses, or
the chief Commanders have rid lasily in their Wagons; as also I have taken
pains in Teaching, Ordering, and Marshalling my Soldiers, as well as time,
place, and opportunity would give me leave; and my Body has not only labored,
but my Mind and Thoughts were always and at all times busily employed for the
affairs of the Army, and for my Soldiers Advantage, contriving the Best, as
how to prevent the Worst. Thus my thoughts have Labored for you continually,
Keeping me waking, whilst you have slept and rested in ease. Neither did I ever
rob my Soldiers of their Spoils, but was pleased to distribute my Share
amongst them; nor did I ever make a Scarcity of your Victuals through my
Luxury; nor have I ever brought my Soldiers into Want through my Imprudence;
for whatsoever Want or Loss you have had, it came merely from Fortune, whose
power the Wisest and Valiantest cannot always and at all times withstand. But
yet the Common Soldiers and Under-Commanders for the most part Accuse their
Generals, laying the Disfavour of Fortune to their Generals charge, although it
is not in any Man's power to avoid Fortune's malice, unless men could Divine
what would fall out against all Reason or Probability; and though Wise men may
imagine such chances, yet they will never order their Affairs, or Designs, or
any Action against Reason, Sense, and Probability; besides, Foolery and Knavery
cause loss and misery without Fortune's help, making more Disorder and
Confusion, than the Wisest men can rectify. But I will not trouble you with
many more Words nor Reproofs; for neither Words, Reproofs, nor Persuasions will
do any good on a Mutinous and Rebellious Army, who has more Strength to do
Evil, than Honesty to do Good; more Fury to mutine, than Courage to fight; more
Envy to their Leaders, than Love to their own Honors. I add only this, your
Baseness I abhor, your Rudeness I scorn, your Malice I despise, your Designs I
slight, and your intended Cruelty I fear not.

A Commanders refusing Speech to Mutinous Soldiers, who Deposed their General,
and would Choose him in his place.
Fellow Soldiers,
YOu have Forcibly against my will Proclaimed me your General, and because I
sent you word, I would not Command you, you sent me a Threatening message, that
although you at first chose me through your Love and Kindness, yet now, whereas
I did slight your Love, you would Force me to take that Charge upon me; but let
me tell you, I care not for your Favor, nor I fear not your Anger, as being
neither a Knave, nor a Coward; for to be a Friend to Mutinous Soldiers, is to
be a Knave, to Fear them, is to be a Coward, and to be chosen General to a
Rebellious Army, is a Dishonor; Wherefore I, preferring Honor before Life,
will rather Die, than be your General. But who gave you Authority to Depose
your General, and to make an other? Or what right have you to Take away, and
Give Commissions? You will answer, by Force of Arms, or rather force of Rebels;
for Arms are, or ought to be, for Justice, Right, Truth, or Honor, not for
Injustice, Wrong, Injury, Falsehood, and Dishonor; and strong Arms and
courageous Hearts, do not agree with mad Heads, and wild Passions; But you, by
your Disobedience seem to be Cowards; for Valor is Obedient, nay, Valiant men
will obey Unreasonable Commands, rather than Oppose their commanders, and
choose rather to Die obediently, than to Live disobediently; But your Actions
have showed you to be Rebellious Cowards; for which I am not only Ashamed, that
you are my Countrymen, or Fellow Soldiers, but Hate you as Enemies to Honor
and honesty; and therefore, if it lay in my Power, I would Destroy you, as
being Unworthy to Live.

A Generals Oration to his Evil-designing Soldiers.
Fellow Soldiers,
I Have not called you together, to persuade you to Fight your Enemies, for I
perceive you are turned Cowards, and Cowards are deaf to all persuasions of
Adventures: Nor do I go about, to persuade you to Patience, although it be the
part of good Soldiers to suffer Patiently, as well as to fight Vigorously,
also to be patient with painful Labors; but I perceive, Patience and
Industry, that accompany Valor, have also forsaken you. Nor shall I persuade
you to stick close to me, as to defend my Life from the Enemies, although I
have been more careful to defend your Lives with Skill and Knowledge in War
and Arms, than you have been to defend my Life with your Strength and Courages.
And give me leave to tell you, that the Renown you have gotten in the Wars,
has been gained as much by my Conduct, as your Valors. Thus I neither
persuade you to Fight, to Suffer, nor to Help me in time of need; but my Desire
is to persuade you, not to Bury the Renown you have gotten in these Wars, in
the Grave of Treachery, nor to cast down your Glorious Acts from the Palace of
Fame, into the Pit of Infamy, which you will do, if you put your Evil Designs
into Acts: for I perceive well by your Secret Meetings and Gatherings in
companies together without Order, and by your Whisperings into each others
Ears, as also by your Murmurings, Complaints, and Exclamations, you intend some
Evil, but in what manner you will execute your Evil Designs, I cannot tell; I
suppose it is, either that you will Desert me, or Make Peace with the Enemy
without me, on Dishonourableterms, or that you will Betray me to the Enemy, and
Deliver me into their hands; or else it is, that you have conspired to Murder
me with your own hands, either of which will be unworthy for good Soldiers to
do. Wherefore I would, if I could, dissuade you for your own sakes, and not for
mine, not to do such Acts, as to cause Honest men to Hate you, Valiant men to
Despise you, Wise men not to Trust you, your Enemies to Scorn you, your Country
to Exclame against you, your Acquaintance to shun you, your Friends to Grieve
for you, your Posterity to be Ashamed of you, and Disgraced by you; for when
After-ages shall mention you, your Posterity, if they have any Worth or Merit,
will hang down their heads for shame, to hear of your Evil Deeds; all which
will be, if you be Mutinous Conspirers, Traitors, or Cowards; but if neither
Honor, Honesty, Fidelity nor Love can dissuade you from your Base,
Treacherous, and Wicked designs, or that your Design is against Me, here I
offer my Self to you, to dispose of my Person and Life as you please; for I am
neither ashamed to Suffer, nor afraid to Dye, knowing I have not done any thing
that a man of Honor ought not to do; and as Fear has no power over my Mind,
so Force has no power over my Will, for I shall willingly Dye.

An Oration to Soldiers, who have killed their General.
BArbarous Soldiers, or rather Cruel Murderers, you that have inhumanely
Killed your General, your Careful, Painful, Prudent, Valiant, Loving and Kind
General, ought to be generally Killed; but Death would be too great a Mercy and
Happiness for such Wretches as you are, for you deserve such Torments and
Afflictions, as are above all expressions, and your Bloody Action has made you
appear to me so Horrid, that me thinks Life is Terrible, because you Live, and
Death is Amable, since our General is Dead, and Honor lives in the Grave with
him, and Baseness lives in the World with you, Devils possess your Souls in
your living Bodies, when as Angels have born away his Soul from his liveless
Corpse, to be Crowned with Everlasting Glory. You shall not need to Fear your
Enemies now, for surely they will Fly you, not for fear you should Kill them,
but for fear you should Infect them, they fear not your Courage, but your
Wickedness; neither shall you fear Oblivion, for you will be Infamous, and the
very report of your Murdering act will cause a trembling of Limbs and chilness
of Spirit to all the hearers, and you will not only be Scorned, Hated, and
Cursed, but Prayers will be offered against you, and Men will Bless themselves
from you, as from a Plague or Evil Spirit. Thus your Enemies will despise you,
your Friends renounce you, Honest men exclame against you, men of Honor shun
you, good Fortune forsake you, Heaven shut all mercy from you, your Conscience
torment you, insomuch that you will be ashamed to Live and afraid to Dye.

An Oration to Soldiers, which repent the Death of their General.
PEnitent Soldiers, (for so you seem by your Tears, Sighs, Groans, and
sorrowful Complaints,) I cannot forbid you to Weep, for your Fault requires
great and many showers of Tears to wash away your Crime; indeed there is no
other way to purge your Souls and to cleanse your Consciences from the stains
of your Generals Blood, but by Penitent Tears. Wherefore let me advise you, to
go to his Urn, and there humbly on your Knees lamenting your Sorrow, pray to
Heaven for Pardon; then make him a Statue, and carry his Image in your Ensigns,
and set his Statue under your Banner; Thus make him, that was your General,
your Saint, and let his Memory be famous by your Valor, that his Enemies may
know, the power of his Name is able to Destroy them, so will you make him
Victorious in his Grave, and appease his Angry Ghost.

An Oration to Distressed Soldiers.
Dear Countrymen,
YOu know, we are a people that have been Conquered, and made Slaves to our
Enemies, which Slavery we did Patiently endure a long time, but at last we had
an Impatient desire of Liberty, and had our Prudence been according to our
Desires, no doubt but we should have Gained it, but our Overhasty Desires have
put us into a greater Misery; for now we are not only like to Lose our
Liberties again, but our Lives, or to Live in worse Bondage than we did before,
which we had better Dye than Endure: but since we were not so Wise for our
selves to Prevent our Danger, as we were Just to our selves to Endeavor our
Liberty, yet we must not leave Endeavoring our own Good, so long as Life
lasts; Wherefore, we must consider, what is best to be done in this Extremity.
First, we have of our selves a Great Body, though not so well Armed as I wish
we were, yet so, as we are not left Naked to our Enemies; but though we have a
great Number, yet our Enemies have a greater Number, and though we be Armed,
yet our Enemies are Better Armed, the worst of all is, that we are in a place
of such Disadvantage, as either we must Starve, or Yield our selves, or Fight
it out at all Hazards; As for Starving, it is a lingering and painful Death,
and to Yield, will be a miserable and painful Life, wherefore to Fight it out
at all Hazards, will be best for us to choose; for Death is the End of Misery,
and Pain is not felt in a Raging or Acting Fury; and if we Resolve, let the
worst come to the worst, we can but Dye, and that we must do in time, had we no
other Enemies than what are Natural, as Sickness and Age; and these Hopes we
have, that Desperate Men in Desperate Adventures, have many times Good Fortune,
and those that are Desperate, want no Courage, but they are apt to be Careless
of Conduct; Wherefore let me advise you, to Listen to Direction, and be
careful to Obey your Instructions; for if we should Overcome our Enemies, we
should not only save our Lives, which we give for lost, but we should have our
Liberties, and also Honor, Power, and Wealth too, whereas our Enemies only
venture their Lives to keep us in Subjection, which will cause them to Fight
but Faintly; for where there is neither Profit, nor Honor to be gained, they
will sooner Run away, than Venture their Lives in the Battle, so that our
Poverty will Defend us, and our Necessity help to Fight for us; Prudence shall
Guide us, and then perchance Fortune may Favor us. Wherefore, let us Assault
our Enemies before they Expect us, and endeavor to Overcome them before they
are ready to Fight with us; for if we take them Unprepared, we shall find them
without Defense, and in such Disorder, as we shall Destroy them without Hazard.

ORATIONS TO CITIZENS IN THE MARKET PLACE.
PART III.
An Oration to a dejected People, ruined by War.
Unfortunate Citizens, and Countrymen,
YOu now seem to be as much cast down and dejected in your Misery, as you were
puffed up with Pride in your Prosperity, in which Prosperity you were so
Confident, and so Careless of your Security, as you would neither believe your
Danger, nor provide for your Safety, insomuch that you Murmured and Mutined
against all Assessments and Payments, although it were to keep the Kingdom in
Peace, and to strengthen it against Foreign force; but now you do not Murmur at
small Taxes, but Mourn for your great Losses, not for your Security, but your
Ruin; your Vanity is vanished, your Pride humbled, and Plenty and Prosperity
fled from you; Where are your brave Furnishings your gay Adornings? your
far-fetched Curiosities, and your curious Rarities? your Numerous Varieties,
and Rich Treasures? all plundered and gone. Where are your Chargeable
Buildings, your Stately Palaces, your Delightful Theaters, your Pleasant
Bowers? all Burnt to ashes. Where are your Races of Herses, you Fleecy Flocks,
your Lowing Herds, your Feathered Poultry, and your full-stored Barns? all
Ruined and gone. Where are your Rich Merchandises, and your Thriving Trades?
all Spoiled. Where are your Wife Laws? all Broken; your Sporting Recreations?
all Ceased; your Ancestors Monuments? all Pulled down and your Fathers Bones
and Ashes dispersed. Where are your Camerads, Companions, and Acquaintance?
most of them Killed; where are your Beautiful Wives, Daughters, Sisters, and
Mistresses? the Enemy injoyes them, and your Country is Desolate, Ruined, and
Forlorn; and you that are left, are Miserable; but what was the cause of your
Misery? your Pride, Envy Factions, Luxury, Vanity, Vice, and Wickedness; for
you would neither be Instructed, Advised, Persuaded, nor Ruled; you Neglected
the Service of the Gods, Disobeyed the Orders of your Governors, Trampled down
the Laws of the Nation, and Despised your Magistrates, and did all what you
would; which brought this Confusion, and so a Destruction, in which Destruction
you must have patience, for Patience will Mediate and Qualify your Misery.

A Conforting Oration to a dejected People, ruined by War.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
I Confess, our Condition is miserable, and our Lives unhappy, in that we are
so unfortunate, as to be Overcome by our Enemies, and Impoverished by our
Losses; but yet it was Uncharitable, nay, Inhumane, for the former Orator to
open our Wounded thoughts, with Repetition of our Losses, and to rub our sore
Minds with bitter and salt Reproaches; for if we have Committed faults, I am
sure we have been sufficiently Punished for them, and if the Gods be Just, as
we believe they are, our Loss and Misery has made them a Satisfaction, for
which I hope they are Pacified; and though we ought to Repent of our past
Disobedience to the Divine and National Laws, yet we have no reason to Repent
of our past Lawful Pleasure; for who, that is Wise, will not make use of his
Riches, and Liberties, whilst he has them? for were it not a madness for fear
of a Dearth to Starve our selves Slaves in Plenty? for fear of an Enemy, to
make our selves Slaves in Prosperity? this were as much as if we should take
away our own Lives before their Natural time, because we know we shall Dye; No,
Dear Countrymen it is soon enough to quit Pleasure, Liberty, and Life, when we
can Enjoy them no longer; and since our Fortune is bad, we must endeavor with
Industry to amend it, and if we cannot, we must Suffer Patiently, and please
ourselves with Hopes; for Hope is a Food the Mind delights to feed on, and
entertains it self with Pleasing Imaginations: and those are Fools, that will
trouble their Minds for that, which cannot be helped; for shall we have not
only Enemies without us, but also within us? shall we Torture our Minds with
Grief, Sorrow, Fear, an Despair, for our misfortunes? No, Dear Countrymen, let
us wipe the Tears from our Eyes, and defy Fortune's malice, and when she knows
we regard not her Frowns, She may chance to Favor us, for she is of the Femal
gender, whose Nature is such, as the more they are Neglecte or Despised, the
Kinder they are.

An Oration for Rebuilding a City ruined by Wars.
UNfortunate Citizens; for so I may call you having been ruined by Wars, and
spoiled by our Enemies; for our City is not only Burnt to the ground, and all
our Goods Plundered, but many of our Citizens and Countrymen Killed, and we
that remain, are preparing with our Wives and Children to seek new Habitations
and Acquaintance in Foreign Countries, from which I would, if I could, dissuade
you, since our Enemies are Gone, and not like to Return; for though they had
the Victory, and won our City, yet it was with such Loss to them, as will force
them to keep Peace for a long time, not being able to make Wars any longer;
for their Valiant'st and most Experienced Soldiers are Killed, and most of the
Flour of their Youth; besides, they have spoiled and lost many of their Horses,
and have wasted and spent abundance of Ammunition and Arms; all which
considered, they have not Gained much by this War; Indeed, War makes more
Spoil than Profit; for though we are Ruined, yet our Enemies are not much
Enriched; but leaving them, let us Consider, what is the best for our selves in
these our Misfortunes, and to be Industrious to Repair our Losses; my Advice
is, not to Separate, but to keep in an United Body together, and to Rebuild our
City: for shall we be worse Citizens than the Ants or Pismires? which will
Rebuild their Hill or Mount over their Heads, whenever it is pulled down,
either by Beast, Men, or Birds, and though it be often pulld down, and the Dust
dispersed, yet they will bring new Earth, or gather up the Relics of the
former Farth, to Rebuild, and will never leave Rebuilding so long as they Live;
and certainly, they are very wise in so doing. The like for Men; for it is
better, as the wisest way, to Unite in a Commonwealth, than to live Dispersed,
and to Wander about like Vagabonds, or to live with Strangers in Foreign Lands,
or to be Governed by Unknown or new Laws, or to Marry with Strangers, that mix
or corrupt their Generations; for those Men are happiest, that Live in their
Native Countries, with their Natural Friends, are Governed by their Ancient
Laws, Marry into their own Tribes or Natives, increase their own Breed,
continue their own Races, uphold their own Families, and are Buried with or by
their Forefathers. Wherefore, Good Citizens, be Industrious to Rebuild your
City, whereby and wherein, you may be as Happy and Flourishing, as formerly you
were; but if through a dejected Discontent, you leave your City in its Ruins,
it is probable you will Live unhappy, and in Slavery all your Lives, as also
your Posterity after you.

An Oration for Building a Church.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
YOu have Built many Streets of Houses, but never a Church, which shows, you
think more of the World, than you do of Heaven, you take more care for your
Bodies, than your Souls; for you build Stately Palaces to Live in, but not a
Church to Pray in, Rooms to Feast in, not Churches to Fast in, to Unite in
Riot, not to Unite in Religion, to Talk Extravagantly, not to Pray Piously, to
Rejoice in Evil, not to Rejoice in Thanksgiving. But the Nature of Mankind is
such, that they Spend Foolishly, and Spare Foolishly, they will Spend to their
own Hurt, and Spare to their own Hurt, they fear Evil, but never endeavor to
avoid Punishment, they Repent what is Past, but never take Warning for what is
to Come; As for Spending their Means, they will spend so much as to make
themselves Sick and Poor, with Surfeiting, Feasting, Drunken Drinking, Pocky
whoring, Covetous Gaming, Vain Shows, Idle Sports, and the like; and when they
Spare, they are so miserable as not to allow themselves Necessaries, so that
they make themselves Unhappy through Want, and yet have more than enough to
Spend; also they fear Pain, and Sickness, but will not endeavor to Avoid
either; for men Drink so much as they are sure to be so sick as to Vomit, and
will Eat such Meat, or Drink such Drinks, as they are sure to have painful
fits of the Gout after them. But it may be said, that the enticing Appetite is
so Persuading, and Overruling, as they cannot Forbear; but some men will Drink
when they are not Dry, and Eat when they are nor Hungry, or have any desire
thereto, but will Drink merely for Company, or being persuaded by Others, or
out of a Humor, and so for Eating; Which is strange, that men should be
persuaded to suffer and endure great pain for the sake of idle Company, or
through the persuasion of Fools, or out of a foolish or mad Humor. Likewise
all men are loath to Dye, and yet most Men will Venture their Lives
unnecessarily, or for very small occasions; and all men are Afraid of
Damnation, and yet they will not Endeavor Salvation, nay, they will venture
Damnation for a trifle, yea, for nothing: as for Example, they will Lie, Swear,
and Forswear, when they are not Provoked or have any occasion to Swear, Lie,
and Forswear; and for Worldly Riches, men are so Covetous and Greedy, as they
will Extort, Coosen, Steal, Murder, and venture Soul, Body, and Life for it,
yet when they Have it, they Spend it, as if they did not Care for it, nay, as
if they did Hate such Riches; and not any man would willingly be Poor, yet they
will spend their Wealth so Foolishly, as neither to have Pleasure, Thanks, nor
Fame for it. The truth is, that by men's Actions it could not be believed, that
Mankind had Rational Souls; for though many men will Speak Wisely, yet most Act
Foolishly or rather Madly, so that men's Rational Souls Live more in their Words
than in their Deeds. But if you have Rational Souls, and a Saving Belief, you
ought to Build a Church, wherein you may Gather together, to Repent your Sins,
to Pray for Forgiveness, to Promise Amendment, and to Reform your Lives, also
to Hear Instructions, and to give good Examples to each other, and to accustom
your selves to Devotion; so shall you become Holy men. Besides, Churches ought
to be Built not only for the Souls of the Living, but for the Bodies of the
Dead, wherein they may be inurned Decently, Humanly, and Religiously.

An Oration persuading the Citizens, to erect a Statue in Honor of a Dead
Magistrate.
Noble Citizens,
N. N. who is now Dead, was the Wisest, Justest, and Honestest Magistrate, that
a Commonwealth could Desire or Have; and as he Served the Commonwealth
Justly, so he ought to be Rewarded Honorably, for he did well Deserve it; But
his Death must not be an Excuse for Ungratefulness, for Honors are given to
the Dead, as well as to the Living; for men's Good Works Live after them,
although their Bodies Dye, and Living men are Benefitted thereby; but should
the Benefit cease with their Death, yet men ought not to Forget the Good they
have Received; for those are very Unthankful, Unworthy, and Base men, that
will not acknowledge what they Have had, but only respect the Present good;
indeed such men are worse than Beasts, and ought to live and dye like Beasts,
as to live in Slavery, and to dye in Oblivion, whereas Virtuous, Worthy,
Honorable, and Noble men ought to live Free, and be Remembered after their
Lives, and those that have done Wise, or Ingenious, or Good, or Profitable, or
Valiant, or Great Works, Deeds, or Acts, ought to be remembered in the Minds of
men, mentioned by the Tongues of men, and figured by the hands of Art, so as to
Live in the Minds, Ears, and Eyes of Living men; as for their Merits to be
Praised, their Acts Recorded, and their Bodies figured to the Life, not only
Pencilled, but Carved, or cast in Moulds, as Carved in stone, or cast in Metal,
that all Ages may not only hear of their Name, read of their Acts, but see
their Figures, all which are due Rights and right Honors to the Memory of
Worthy deceased men; Wherefore, this Worthy Deceased man, who was a Wife and
Just Magistrate, ought at the Commonwealth's charge to have his Statue in
Stone or Metal, and to be set up in the most Public place in the City, that
every Particular Person may think of Him, and remember his Acts, when they see
his Figure, which will not only be a due Honor to him that is Dead, but an
Encouragement to those that Live after him, to imitate and follow his Example,
and that such Magistrates and Ministers of State, that are employed after him,
may do as he has done, as to be Just, Prudent, Careful, and Industrious,
which the Gods grant for the sake of the Commonwealth.

An Accusing Oration for Refusing the Office of a Magistrate, and so Neglecting
the Service of the Commonwealth.
Noble Citizens,
I Have assembled you at this time, to make a Complaint against D. D. who being
chosen a Magistrate, as believing him to be one of the Ablest men for his.
Wisdom amongst us, and so Fittest to be employed in the Service and Affairs of
the Commonwealth, has refused the Office and Employment, choosing rather to
live Idly, than to take Pains and Labor to do Good, for which he ought to be
Punished either in Body or Estate; for it is not only an Obstruction to the
affairs of the Commonwealth, but a Dangerous Example; for if all the Wisest
men should refuse the Employment and Management of State-affaris, leaving the
Government only to Fools, the Commonwealth would be quickly brought to Ruin,
in which Ruin the Wise men would suffer as much as other men; Wherefore, for
their Own sakes, as well as for the sake of their Country, they ought to employ
their Bodies and Minds in the Service of the Commonwealth, otherwise Foolish
Statesmen and Magistrates will make such Disorder, as no particular family or
Man could live Safely, much less Plentifully, for Peace and Plenty would be
utterly destroyed with Civil War, were there no Foreign Enemies; whereas, Wise
men can keep Peace, and make a Commonwealth or Kingdom Flourish: for it is as
difficult and hard to keep a Commonwealth in Peace and Order, as it is easy
to cause Wars and Ruin, and more difficult to make Peace, when War is begun.
Wherefore, the best way to keep a Commonwealth in Order, Peace, when War is
begun. Wherefore, the best way to keep a Commonwealth in Order, Peace, and
Plenty, is, to choose Wise and Able Magistrates, and not to let the Wise men
follow their own Pleasures and Delights, but to employ them in the Service of
the Commonwealth.

An Excusing Oration in Answer to the former.
Noble Citizens,
I Am come here at this time to speak for mySelf, and to tell you, I deserve
not to be Punished either in my Estate or Person, for refusing a Charge and
Employment, I am not Capable or fit to be employed in; for I confess, I am
naturally Dull and Lasie, no ways Busy or Active, and therefore Unfit for
State-imployments; and since it is a Natural imperfection, I ought to be free
from Punishment, for the fault lies in Nature, not in Me, and it would be a
great Injustice to lay Nature's fault to My charge, and to punish me for that I
cannot help; but perchance you will say, this is only an Excuse, and I may help
this Defect; but put the Case it were so, and I could Help it, yet I do not
find in my Self such a Supreme Wit, Judgment, Understanding, Knowledge,
Contrivance, Prudence, Patience, Experience, and the like above other Men, but
that there be other men far Beyond me; for though the Orator that spoke the
last Speech, said, I am a Wife Man, yet it is more than I know, and probable,
he says more than he believes; for it is the Nature of some men, to Praise
other men to their Ruin, and Praise in some Cases, and at some Times, and to
foam Assemblies, or Persons, does more Hurt to the Praised, than all the
Dispraises could have done, nay, some times Men receive a Benefit by being
Dispraised, where as Praises would utterly Ruin them. But as I said, put the
Cafe, I were a Wise man, and could Discharge the Office of a Magistrate, as a
Wife man should do, yet if a Company of Fools or Knaves join together to
oppose my Orders or Power, I can do little Good, nay, had I other Wise men
joined in Power and Authority with me, yet we should do little Good, for Fools
and Knaves are too strong for Honest and Wise men, because they are far more
in Number, and so much Odds there is, as there are thousands of Fools for one
Wise man; Wherefore it is Fortune, or Chance, or some particular Favor from
the Gods, that Govern Commonwealths, and not those they call Wife men; for
the VVisest men in the World cannot keep a People in Peace, if they be
resolved and set to Rebel; for when the Generalilty is up in Arms, it is a
Folly for Particular Persons to oppose them; and when the Generality will pull
down Particular Persons from their Power, Particular Persons can not stand; and
when the Generality will alter a particular Government, the Government must
change; Wherefore, the only and best means to keep up the Commonwealth, is to
Pray to the Gods for Peace, and to keep the People as niuch as may be to
Religious Ceremonies, that they may Fear the Gods, which Fear and Devotion will
make them Obey their Magistrates, which I wish, and leave them.

An Oration against some Historians, or Writers of State Affairs, or Policy.
Fellow Citizens,
WE have some Men amongst us, that seem to desire to be Statesmen, and
because they are not Statesmen in Practice, they are Statesmen in Books,
VVriting of State affairs; but how do they Write? not like Wife, but like
Learned men; not to Teach men what is Best to be done, but what Evil has been
done, which is a Relation of Past, not an Instruction to Future Actions. The
truth is, they make an Hash of many several Authors, taken out of several
Pieces, to make up a Dish to present to their Readers, in Hope they may Enrich
their Host, if not with Preferment, yet with Praise; But surely those are
Hungry, Half Starved Guest, that can Feed with a Gusto on such Broken Meat,
although Skilfully Dressed; and these Cooks of Other men's Meat, which are Writers
out of Other men's Works, are not only Unprofitable, but Cumbersome in the State
or Commonwealth, filling our Libraries and Heads with Repetition of old
Authors in new Styles, yet were they the Authors or first Writers of such
Books, as treat of State Affairs, they would do more Hurt than Good, and rather
make Division than Unity, War than Peace; for instead of Declaring the Policy
of State, they Teach men to be Politic against the State; and it is to be
Observed, that much VVriting of that Nature makes much Trouble, wherein the Pen
does more mischief than the Sword, witness Controversies, that make Atheism;
for the more Ignorant a people are, the more Devout and Obedient they are to
God and his Deputies, which are Magistrates; Wherefore it were very Requisite,
that all such Books should be Burnt, and all such VVriters Silenced, or at
least none should write of States-affairs, but those the State allows or
Authorizes.

An Oration Concurring with the former.
Fellow Citizens,
I Am of the former Orators opinion, that all Books of Politics,
State Affairs, or National Histories should be Burnt, and none suffered to
Write any more Books of that Nature; otherwise, not only every Writer, but
every Reader will pretend to be Statesmen, which will bring an infallible
Ruin to the Commonwealth, having more Politicians than Business, which will
produce more Faction than Reformation. The truth is, many Politicians will be
apter to Dissolve, than agree to make Good Laws, and will sooner cause a
Destruction, then Govern a Commonwealth; for every several Politician would
have a several Policy; but could or would they all Agree in their Opinions, yet
if every Man were a Statesman, all Particular Affairs would be laid aside,
which Particular Industries make up a General Commerce, Trade and Traffic in
the Commonwealth: Wherefore, take the former Orators advice, for the Peace and
Preservation of this State, and suffer none to Write or Read any Books, but
what Recreates the Mind, as Poems, what Increases their Stores, as Husbandry,
what Restores Health, as Medicines, what Exercises the Body, as Arts, and what
Improves the Understanding, as Sciences; all which may be allowed without
Danger; but for Divinity and State, let those be Particular and not General,
and rather be in the Breast or Brain of some, than in the Books or Studies of
many, and let them continue in Tradition, but not in Print. So will the People
Obey and not Dispute, they will be Practisers and not Preachers, and will be
content to be Subjects, and not endeavor to be Sovereigns.

An Oration somewhat different from the former.
Fellow Citizens,
I Confess, it is Dangerous in a State, when as Some men think they are VViser
than really they are, but More dangerous, when as Every man thinks himself
VViser than his Neighbor, for those thoughts make them Proud, Ambitious, and
Factious, and in the end Mutinous and Rebellious, and of all Self-conceited
Persons, the Self-conceited Statesmen are the most Dangerous, and oftentimes
the most Foolish; the greatest Danger is, that there are more Fools than Wise
men, through which General defect, a Self-conceited Statesman may be the Head
of Fools, although but the Tail of Wise men, and Head to Tail is
Disproportionable; but it may be that this Disproportion may make them
Unactive, by which they become less Dangerous; Wherefore, I am not of the
former Orators opinion, as to have all such Books as treat of State Affairs
Burnt, for the Burning of such Books may advance their Authors Fame, but not
advance the Public Good; neither do such Books Public Hurt, by reason none,
but some few Private Persons read them, for the Generality delights not in such
Studies; so as they will partly Dye in Oblivion, especially if you take no
notice of them.

An Oration against those that lay an Aspersion upon the Retirement of Noble
men.
Noble Citizens,
WE have some Ill-natured people amongst us, that endeavor to turn all other
men's Actions, but their own, to the worst Sense or Construction; as for
Example, some of our Nobles retire to their Country Habitations, for which
those Ill-natured or Foolish persons Exclame against them, both in Books and
Speeches, as that they Retire through Pride, Ambition, and Revenge, being
Discontented they are not the Chief Ministers of State, Rulers in Government,
or Counselors for Advices; also they would make their harmless Country
Recreations, as Hunting, Hawking, Racing, and the like Sports, as also
Hospitality, Dangerous Designs, which is unjustly Censured, and wickedly
Wrested, to pull out the Right and Truth, to place Falsehood, when as it may be
easily known, that most of our Nobles, which Retire out of this Metropolitan
City to their Country Houses, Retire either for Pleasure, Profit, Quiet, or
Health, or all; for it is manifest, that in a very Great and Populous City,
there is nothing but Trouble, Expenses, Noise, and oftentimes Malignant
Diseases, all which some Ill-natured men and Pretending Politicians would have
theem suffer rather than to avoid. But those men that are so Wise, to choose
the Best, are not Afraid of a Bawling Pen or Tongue, and seldom Consider or
Regard what they Write or Speak, and if they do, they only give such
Find-faults Pity or a Scorn. But put the Case, Noble Citizens, that some Noble
men did Retire out of some just Discontent, as for Example, imagine this
Kingdom or Monarchy had been in a long Civil War, and some Noble men had not
only been so Loyal, as never to Adhere to the Rebels, but had Served their
Prince to the last of their Power, Ventured their Lives, Lost their Estates,
and had Endured great misery in a long Banishment, and after an Agreement of
Peace, and the Proof of their Honesty and Loyalty, should be Neglected or
Affronted, instead of Reward and Favor; if these Forsaken and Ruined, although
Honest Persons, should Retire from Court and City into the Country, to bewail
their Misfortunes in solitary Groans, or to pick up their scattered Goods,
broken Inheritance, and tattered States, or to restore their Halfdying
Posterity to some time of Life, should they be Railed and Exclamed against? can
Heaven Bless a State or Kingdom, that will suffer such Uncharitableness and
Inhumanity? or can Nature suffer her most Noble-minded Creatures to stay in the
presence of Public Affronts, Disgraces, and Neglects, and not humbly turn
their Faces from them, or Honestly endeavor not to Trouble those, that have a
desire to Please? and if by their Wise Prudence, those Retired Persons can
afford themselves some Harmless Recreations to mix and temper their
Over-carefull and Industrious Labors, they ought not to be Condemned for it;
for God and Nature mixes Good and Evil, and the greatest Grief has some
Refreshment of Ease, and the hardest Labors some Rest, but only these
Find-faults are Restless, through Envy and Ambition, hoping by their Busy
Heads, Restless Pens, and Abusive Exclamations, to rise to Promotion and
Preferment, and though they pretend to Discover Seditions, they are the only
Authors of Factions and Seditions. Wherefore it would be very fit, Noble
Citizens, that our Ministers of State and Magistrates should Silence such bold
Persons, that dare Censure our Nobles private and particular Actions; for if
they should have that Liberty, they would in time Censure this Government and
our Governors of State and Commonwealth, and who can foresee, but that the
Common Rout or People might take their Factions or Ill-natured or Meddling
Dispositions for Wisdom?

An Oration for Liberty of Conscience.
Fellow Citizens,
IT is very probable, we shall fall into a Civil War, through the Diverse
Opinions in One and the same Religion; for what has been the cause of this
Hash in Religion, but the Suffering of Theological Disputations in Schools,
Colleges, Churches, and Chambers, as also Books of Controversies? all which
ought not to have been Suffered, but Prohibited, by making Laws of Restraint;
but since that Freedom has been given, the Inconveniency cannot be Avoided,
unless the Magistrates will give, or at least not oppose a Free Liberty to all;
for if the People of this Nation is so Foolish, or Wilful, or Factious, or
Irreligious, as not to Agree in One Opinion, and to Unite in One Religion, but
will be of Diverse Opinions, if not of Diverse Religions, the Governors must
Yield, or they will Consume the Civil Government with the Fire of their Zeal;
indeed they will Consume themselves at last in their own Confusion. Wherefore,
the best remedy to prevent their Own ruin, with the ruin of the
Commonwealth, is, to let them have Liberty of Conscience, Conditionally, that
they do not meddle with Civil Government or Governors; and for Security that
they Shall not, there must be a Law made and Inacted, that, whosoever does
Preach, Dispute, or Talk against the Government or Governors, not only in
This, but of any Other Nation, shall be Punished either with Death, Banishment,
or Fine; also for the quiet and Peace of this Kingdom, there ought to be a
strict Law, that no Governor or Magistrate shall in any kind Infringe our Just
Rights, our Civil or Common Laws, nor our Ancient Customs; for if the One Law
should be made, and not the Other, the People would be Slaves, and the
Governors their Tyrants.

An Oration against Liberty of Conscience.
Fellow Citizens,
I Am not of the former Orators opinion; for if you give Liberty in the Church,
you must give Liberty in the State, and so let every one do what they will,
which will be a Strange Government, or rather I may say, no Government: for if
there be no Rules, their can be no Laws, and if there be no Laws, there can be
no Justice, and if no Justice, no Safety, and if no Safety, no Propriety,
neither of Goods, Wives, Children, nor Lives, and if there be no Propriety,
there will be no Husbandry, and the Lands will lie Unmanured, also there will
be neither Trade nor Traffic, all which will cause Famine, War, and Ruin,
and such a Confusion, as the Kingdom will be like a Chaos, which the Gods keep
us from.

An Oration proposing a Mean betwixt the two former Opinions.
Fellow Citizens,
I Am not of the two former Orators opinions, neither for an Absolute Liberty,
nor a Forced Unity, but Between both, as neither to give them such Liberty, as
for Several Opinions, to gather into Several Congregations, nor to force them
to such Ceremonies, as Agree not with their Consciences; and if those Sects or
Separatists Disturb not the Canon, Common, or Civil Laws, not to Disturb their
Bodies, Minds, or Estates: for if they Disturb not the Public Weal, why should
you Disturb their Private Devotions? Wherefore, give them leave to follow their
Several Opinions, in their Particular Families, otherwise if you Force them,
you will make them Furious, and if you give them an Absolute Liberty, you will
make them Factious.

An Oration Reproving Vices.
Noble Citizens,
BEing a fellow Citizen with you, I ought not to forbear from persuading you to
Reform the Disorders of this City, as not to Suffer Loose and Idle persons to
Live without Employment, or to pass by their Abuses without Punishment; also to
Reform the Excess of Vanity, Luxury, Drunkenness, and Adultery, of which the
Chiefest are most Guilty; for the Poor and Inferior sort has not Means to
maintain those Vices, although they endeavor to the utmost of their Abilities;
and as they have not Means, so they have not that Courage or rather Impudence
to Act Vices so Publicly, as the Richer sort does; for Poverty is Humble,
which makes it Modest, when as Riches is Proud and Bold; the truth is, this
City is like a Surfeited Body, full of Diseases, and I fear, easy Remedies,
which are Persuasions, will not Cure you, except Wars, Plagues or Famine come
amongst you, or be Applied to you, for they may Cure some, although they will
Kill most: But one thing I VVonder most at, that you send your Children to
School, to be Instructed in Divinity and Morality, which is to Teach them to
Pray and to Fast, to be Humble and Charitable, to be Prudent and Temperate, yet
at Home they have Leave and Liberty to be Vain, Idle, and Expensive, to Feed
Luxuriously, to Play Wantonly, and to Live Riotously, so that what good their
Tutors teach them by Reading and Preaching, their Fathers corrupt them by
Example and Precepts; they go forth to be Schooled, and come home to be Fooled.
Wherefore, I cannot imagine, why you should put your selves to that Charge, to
have your Children Taught and Instructed to that which is Good, and yet suffer
them to do what is Bad, unless you desire to fee whether God or the Devil be
Strongest in them; But if you cannot Live more Soberly, Moderately, Orderly,
and Honestly, the best way were to send your Children so far from you, as not
to hear of you, until you Dye, so that the next Generation may be Better,
unless by Nature you leave your Sons to Inherit your Vices, as they do your
Goods by Birth, and then there is no Hopes of Amendment. It is likely you will
say, Why I stand here Talking to you, and Exhorting you? I answer, that Saint
Paul fayeth, by the Foolishness of Preaching men may be Saved: so I hope my
Words may Work upon your Hearts, as to persuade you, not to Spend your Wealth,
to Wast your Time, to End your Lives so Unprofitably, as neither to Serve your
God, your Country, nor your Friends.

An Oration concerning the Foreign Travels of Young Gentlemen.
Noble Citizens,
YOu think your Sons not well Bred, unless you send them to Travel into Foreign
Nations, to see and understand Fashions, Customs, and Manners of the World, by
which they may Learn the better to Know themselves, and to Judge of others; but
though you send your Sons abroad, in Hope they will Profit by their Travels,
yet you are for the most part Deceived in your Hopes and Expectations: for our
Young men in this Age get nothing by their Travels, but Vanity and Vice, which
makes them Fools; for they gain not any Profitable Understanding, or Knowledge,
to make them Wise men; the truth is, they go forth of their Own Country, Civil
Men, but return Brute Beasts, as Apes, Goats, and Swine, and some few return
Foxes, so that their Travels Metamorphose them from Men to Beasts; and as for
their Learning of several Languages, give me leave to tell you, that they Learn
more Words than Wit, which makes them speak Much, but not Well. But to come to
the Drist of my Speech, since our Traveling Gallants being home only Vanity
and Vice, as more Prodigality than Frugality, more Luxury than Temperance, more
Diseases than Health, more Extravagancy than Discretion, more Folly than
Experience, and more Vice than Virtue, it were better they should stay at Home,
than Travel as they do; for their Travels are not only Unprofitable to
Themselves, and their Country, but Destructive; for their Vices and Vanity,
does not only Corrupt their own Natures and civil Manners, and wast their
Bodies and Estates, but it Corrupts all good Government in the Weal Public;
for which Reason, I think it most requisite and fit, that none should Travel
without Leave of the State or Public Counsel, and at their Return should be
Accountable to the State and Public Counsel of their Travels, and the
Advantages they have made. Thus their Travels would be Profitable both to
Themselves, and to their Country; for they would be as a Nursery and School to
breed up Youth to be Wise men.

An Oration concerning Plays, and Players.
Noble Citizens,
HEre is a Company of Players, which are for Pleasure and Pastime to those that
have Nothing to do, and Money to Spend; but give me leave to tell you,
youMis-spend your Time, and also your Money, unless the Players were better
Actors, and their Plays better Plays; for as their Plays have no Wit in
them, so the Actors have no Grace, nor Becoming Behavior in their Actions; for
what is Constraint, is Misbecoming, as being not Natural, and whatsoever is
Unnatural, is Deformed: but pray, Mistake me not, as believing, I am an Enemy
to Plays or Players, for I am an Enemy only to Foolish Plays, and Ill Actors,
but for Good Plays well Acted, I am so far from being an Enemy to them, as I
think there is nothing so Profitable for Youth, both to Increase their
Understanding, and to Fashion their Behavior; and for those that have Spare
time, they cannot pass it more Pleasingly; therefore let me Advise you, that
are Magistrates of this City, to set up a Company of Players at the Common
charge, and to Maintain some Excellent Poet, to make Good Plays, and certainly
you will be no Losers in so doing, but Gainers, being the Best and Readiest way
of Education for your Children: for the Poet will inform them both of the
World, and the Natures and Humors of Mankind, an Easier and Delightfuller way,
than the Schoolmen; and the Actors will show them to Behave themselves more
Gracefully and Becomingly, than their Dancing-Masters. Thus they will Learn
more both for their Bodies and Minds of the Poet and Players, than of their
Tutors and Governors, or by Studying or Traveling, which is Expensive,
Laborious, and Dangerous, whereas the other is Easy, Delightful, Safe, and
Profitable. Also one thing more I must advise you, that you provide a Practick
Judicious man, to Instruct the Players to Act well; for as they must have a
Poet, to make their Plays, so they must have a Tutor to teach them to Act
those Plays, unless the Poet will take the pains to teach them himself, as to
Humor the Passions, and to Express the Humors Naturally, and not to Act after
the French Fashion, with High strained Voices, Constrained Motions, Violent
Actions, and such Transportation, as is neither Graceful, Becoming, nor
Natural; but they must make Love Soberly, Implore Favor Humbly, Complain
Seriously, Lament Sadly, and not Affectedly, Fantastically, Constraintly,
Ragingly, Furiously, and the like; all which in my Opinion they do Senselesly,
Foolishly, and Madly; for all Feignings must be done as Naturally as may be,
that they may seem as Real Truths.

SEVERAL CAUSES PLEADED IN SEVERAL COURTS OF JUDICATURE.
PART IV.
Accusing and Pleading at the Bar before the Judges, for and against a Woman
that has killed her Husband.
Most Reverend Judges,
The Plaintiff THis Woman, who is Accused, not only for Killing a Man, but her
Husband, we have for this Grievous and Horrid Fact brought before your Honors,
to be Judged according to the Laws, delivering her to your Justice and
Judgment.


Defendant. Most Reverend, and Just Judges, 'T is true, that this Unhappy Woman
has unfortunately Killed her Husband, but Heaven knows, it was Against her
Will, and as I may say Against her Knowledge: for her Husband and She being
Lovingly together, not Mistrusting any Danger, on a sudden came a Man, who as
it seems, was her Husbands Enemy, for he assaulted her Husband with a drawn
Sword; this Woman seeing her Husband in Danger, as being Unarmed and
Defenseless, was so afrighted as she knew not what she did; Wherefore, she
having got a Dagger, which lay in the Room they were in, and thinking to thrust
it into her Husbands Enemy, Unawares thrust it into her Husbands Body,
wherewith he fell down, and immediately Died, which when she saw and perceived
the mistake, she was as Distracted, and at last fell into a Trance, but being
Recovered out of that faint Fit, she has since remained a most Sorrowful and
Lamenting Widow; I Express her Sorrow, to prove her Innocence from all Evil
Constructions; for the Death of her Husband was not Designed or Intended by
her, but by Fate and Fortune; and it is the Duty of a Loving Wife, to defend
her Husbands Honor, Person, and Life, with all her Endeavors, and if the
success of her Honest, Loyal, and Loving endeavors falls out unfortunately,
She ought not to be Punished for her Misfortune; for Misfortune is no Crime,
but rather to be Pitied and Comforted, either can Justice make Misfortune a Law
to Condemn to Dye; and shall Duty and Loyalty be made Traitors? shall Honest
Love be Punished with Torments and Death? No, Most Reverend Judges, Love and
Loyalty ought to be Honored with Praise and Respect, and not with Torments and
Death, and the Death of this VVomans Husband was caused by a maskered Fear,
proceeding from an Extraordinary Love. Thus his Death was a Chance, not an
Intended Murder.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, there can be no Witness of the Intention, but
her own Knowledge and Conscience, which are Invisible and not Proveable, and
therefore Insufficient to Acquit Her; but that which is a Sufficient VVitness
against her Intention, and may lawfully Condemn her, is her endeavor to Resist
the Judgment and Sentence of Death; for all Good, Loyal, and Loving Wives
ought, nay, desire to Live and Dye with their Husbands, when as they be free
from all Suspect, wherefore much more ought they to accompany their Husbands in
Death, who are liable to be Judged and Condemned for Treason and Murder; for as
it is Unlawful and Irreligious for to Act her own Death, so it is
Dishonorable and Impious to Endeavor to resist the Judgment of Death by
Lawful Authority, Pleading by her Lawyers most shamefully for Life.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, It is not that she Desires to Live, but not
to Dye Infamously, as to Dye as a Murderer of her Husband; for though her
Husband was Killed by her Hand, yet he was not Killed by her Intention, but by
Chance, which misfortune makes her Life a Torment to her, for being so unhappy
as Unwittingly to Destroy him, which her Life did most Delight with; but yet
she would, if she could, rather Live Miserably, than Dye Dishonourably; for in
her Dishonorable Death, both She and her Husband does doubly Dye.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, It were better Two Persons should Dye Four
times over, than such a Crime should be Once Pardoned; for the Example will be
more Dangerous, than to have an Innocent Condemned would be Grievous: But it is
most probable, She is Guilty.


A Cause of Adultery Pleaded at the Bar before Judges.
Most Reverend Judges,
Plaintiff. HEre is a Man and a Woman, that were Taken in Adultery, and brought
hither to be judged, that they may Suffer according to the Law, which is Death.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, This Adulteress, and Adulterer, (for so in
truth they are) although the Woman is ashamed to confess in Words, only in
silent Tears, yet the man confesses his fault publicly, and asks pardon, only
he says, it is a Natural fault: for the desire of Procreation is Born and Bred
in all Nature's Animal Creatures; it is an Orginal Appetite, but whether it be
an Original Sin, he says, he does not know; yet if it be, it may more justly be
Pardoned, than Gluttony, which was the cause of Man's Fall, witness Eve, and the
forbidden Fruit; and that Damnable Sin, Gluttony, that destroys many Lives
through Surfeits, the Law takes no notice of, but Procreation that begets and
makes Life, is Punished by the Law, which seems strange to Reason, that Cursed
Gluttony should be Advanced, and Loving Adultery Hanged. Indeed, it is a great
Injustice, at least a grievous Law; and surely our Forefathers, that made that
Law, were Defective either in Bodies or Minds, or at least in Judgment; and
though I confess it is not fit, we should break or dissolve those Laws,
howsoever Erroneous they are, that our Predecessors made; yet we, their
Posterities and Successors may Sweeten or Qualify the Extreme Rigor of their
Laws, as in this Case of Adultery, to Punish the Bodies, but to Spare their
Lives; or to Fine their Estates, and Spare their Bodies; for if the Rigor of
the Law should be put in Execution in all Cases, and to all Persons, there
would no man be Free, either in his Estate, Person, or Life; but howsoever,
this Male-offender, my Client, says, that if he must Dye, yet he shall not Dye
Basely or Dishonourably, by reason he shall Dye Loves Martyr; As for the Femal
offender, She says, that she was seduced by Nature, as Eve by the Devil, and
Women being of Soft and Tender Dispositions, do easily yield to an Enticing
Appetite; besides, men being Eloquent in Persuading, Prevalent in Flattering,
Free in Protesting, and Earnest in Vows and Promises, all which has such force
with Females, who are Credulous and Believing Creatures, as she had no Power to
deny him his Desire. But both these Lovers desire these Most Noble and Just
Judges to Consider, their Crime is not caused through Spite, Envy, Malice,
Revenge, Scorn, Pride, Hate, or the like Sins, but through Love, Kindness,
Friendship, Charity, Generosity, Humility, and such like Virtues, which caused
this Crime, namely Adultery, so that it is the only Sin, that is Built upon
Virtues: besides, this Sin, namely Adultery, has a Well-pleased Countenance, a
Courtly Behavior, and an Eloquent Speech, which is the cause, most Men and
Women are in Love with this Sin, the Gods forgive them for it; for this Sin
does not appear with Terrible and Horrid Aspect as Murder, as to cause the very
Soul as much as the Senses to be Maskered with Fear; not it does not appear of
so Foul an Aspect as Gluttony and Drunkenness, as to cause Hate or Aversion,
but it has so Amiable an Aspect as to cause Love, and so Fruitful an Effect
as to cause Life and Living Creatures. They implore Mercy, and beg your
Favorable Sentence, and since it is a Natural effect for Males and Females to
be Adulterers, at least Lovers, you may as soon destroy all Animal Creatures as
this Sin, if it be one; and if there be some Men and Women purely chaste, those
are of Divine Compositions, and not Perfect Naturals, their Souls and Bodies
having more of the Purity of the Gods, than the gross Corporality of Nature;
but these two Offendants confess, they have proved themselves Nature's
Creatures, and the Woman says she is Eve's Daughter, but if you will Spare her
Life, she hopes to be as great a Saint as Mary Magdalen; for she will beg
Pardon by Repentance, and wash out her Sin with her Tears.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, This Pleader ought to be Condemned, not only
for a Corrupt Lawyer, but a Wicked Man, and may very well be believed to be
Guilty of the same Crime, he Pleads so well for; for if he were not Guilty of
the Crime, he would not Plead for a Pardon.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, I am no more Guilty of the Sin, than the
Interceding Saints in Heaven for Sinners on Earth; but if the Pleader should be
Condemned for the Cause of his Client, neither Truth would be Heard, nor Right
Decided, so that all Justice would be Overthrown with Malicious Accusers, and
False Witnesses. But howsoever, Most Reverend Judges, I am not to Decide the
Cause, though I Plead in the behalf of my Clients, and it is the Profession of
a Lawyer, to speak for his Clients, and not Against them, whatsoever their
Cause be; for this is the part of their Opposites, and I am not to fling the
first Stone.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, Howsoever he be Affected, whether evil or
not, yet the Cause he Pleads, is a Wicked Cause, and the Offenders ought to be
severely Punished, according to the Punishing Laws for such Offenses and
Offenders; and if Adultery should be suffered, Propriety and the Right of
Inheritance would be lost in the Obscurity of hidden Adultery, or in the
Uncertainty of the Right Children or Fathers.


A Cause Pleaded at the Bar before Judges, concerning Theft.
Most Reverend, and Just Judges,
Plaintiff. HEre is a man, which is Accused for Stealing privately, and Robbing
openly, against all Law and Right, the Goods of his Neighbors, for which we
have brought him before your Honors, appealing to the Laws for satisfaction of
the Injuries, Wrongs, and Loffes, leaving him to your Justice and Judgment.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, I am come here to Plead for this poor man, my
Client, who is Accused for Stealing, which is a silent obscure way of taking
the Goods of other men, for his own use; also this Poor man, (for so I may say
he is, having nothing of his own to Live on, but what he is Necessitated to
take from other men) is accused for Robbery, which is to take away the Goods of
other men in a Visible way and Forcible manner; All which he confesses, as
that the Accusation against him is true; for he did both Steal and Rob for his
own Livelihood, and Maintenance of his Old (...) Past Laboring, and for his
Young Children, (...) are not Able to help themselves, and for his Weak; Sick
Wife, that Labors in Child Birth; For which he appeals to Nature, who made all
things in Common, She made not some men to be Rich, and other men Poor, some to
Surfeit with overmuch Plenty, and others to be Starved for Want: for when she
made the World and the Creatures in it, She did not divide the Earth, nor the
rest of the Elements, but gave the use generally amongst them all. But when
Governmental Laws were devised by some Usurping Men, who were the greatest
Thieves and Robbers, (for they Robbed the rest of Mankind of their Natural
Liberties and Inheritances, which is to be Equal Possessors of the World;)
these Grand and Original Thieves and Robbers, which are called Moral
Philosophers, or Commonwealth makers, were not only Thieves and Tyrants to the
Generality of Mankind, but they were Rebels against Nature, Imprisoning Nature
within the Jail of Restraint, Keeping her to the spare Diet of Temperance,
Binding her with Laws, and Inslaving her with Propriety, whereas all is in
Common with Nature. Wherefore, being against Nature's Laws for any man to
Possess more of the World or the Goods of the World than an other man, those
that have more Wealth or Power than other men, ought to be Punished as Usurpers
and Robbers, and not those that are Poor and Powerless. Therefore, if you be
Just Judges of Nature, and not of Art, Judges for Right, and not for Wrong, if
you be Judges of the most Ancient Laws, and not Usurping Tyrants, you will not
only quit this Poor man, and set him free from his Accusers, which are His and
such Poor men's Abusers, but you will cause his Accusers, who are Rich, to
Divide their Wealth Equally with Him and all his Family; for which Judgment
you will gain Natures favor, which is the Empress of Mankind, Her Government
is the Ancientest, Noblest, Generousest, Heroickest, and Royalest, and her Laws
are not only the Ancientest, (for there are no Records before Nature's Laws, so
that they are the Fundamental Laws of the Universe, and the most Common Laws
extending to all Creatures,) but they are the Wisest Laws, and yet the Freest;
also Nature is the most Justest Judge, both for Rewards and Punishments; for
She Rewards her Creatures, that Observe her Laws as they ought to do, with
Delight and Pleasure, but those that Break or abuse her Laws, as in destroying
their fellow Creatures by untimely Deaths, or unnatural Torments, or do Riot
and oppress her with Excess, She Punishes them with Grief, Pains, and
Sicknesses, and if you will avoid the Punishment of Remorse, Grief, and
Repentance, Save this Poor necessitated man from Violence, and the Cruelty of
these Inhuman, Unnatural, Destroying Laws.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, This man, who is Nature's Lawyer and Pleader,
ought to be Banished from this Place, and his Profession of Pleading out of all
Civilest Governments; for he Talks he knows not what of Nature's Laws, whereas
there is no Law in Nature, for Nature is Lawless, and has made all her
Creatures so, as to be Wild and Ravenous, to be Unsatiable and Injurious, to be
Unjust, Cruel, Destructive, and so Disorderous, that, if it were not for Civil
Government, Ordained from an Higher Power, as from the Creator of Nature her
self, all her Works would be in a Confusion, and so their own Destruction. But
man is not all of Nature's Work, but only in his Outward Frame, having an
Inward Celestial and Divine Composition, and a Supreme Power given him by the
Gods to Rule and Govern Nature; So that if your Honors submit to the Plea of
this Babbler, you will make the Rulers and Governors of Nature, the Slaves of
Nature; Wherefore, if you be Celestial and not Natural Judges, and will give
Divine Judgment, and not Judge according to Brutal Senses, you will Condemn
this Notorious Thief and Wild Robber to the Gallows, that his Life may be the
Satisfaction for the Wrongs, and his Death an Example for a Warning to Prevent
the like Crimes.


A Cause Pleaded before Judges betwixt two Bastards.
Most Reverend Judges,
Plaintiff THere be Two Laws in this Kingdom, which seem to be very Unjust; the
One is, that if a Woman be Got / with Child by One Man, and Marries an Other
before her Child is Born, that Child must Inherit her Husbands Estate, if it be
a Son, so that One man's Son comes to be an Other man's Heir by the Law. The
Other is, that if a man Begets a Son before Marriage, and he Marries not the
Woman till After his Son is Born, and though the Marriage cancels the Fault of
Adultery, and is an Atonement for the Sin or Crime, both to God and the Law,
yet the Innocent Child, that was in No Fault, is put by the Inheritance by the
Law; indeed, the Son so Born, Inherits only the Disgrace of a Bastard, but not
his Fathers Estate; and thus if the Woman be Incontinent, a man's Own begotten
Son shall not Inherit, and an Other man's Bastard be his Heir. The same Case is
brought to be Pleaded before your Honors, for two Sons of One Woman, but not
of One Father, the Eldest being her Husbands, Begotten and Born before
Marriage, the other Begotten by an Other man, but Born a month after her
Marriage with the first Sons Father. The Son born after Marriage claims his
Mothers Husbands Estate as Inheritance by Law, the Other claims the Estate as a
Natural Right.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, The Son born to Inherit, claims the Estate by
the Right of Birth, and hopes your Honors will not suffer his Birthright to
be taken from him.


Plaintiff Most Reverend Judges, The Right Begotten Son does not Challenge his
Fathers Estate, as his Right by Birth, but as his Right by Gift; for his Father
by Deed gave him that which the Law took from him; for his Estate being not
Entailed, he might Give it to whom he would, and he could not Give it more
Justly, Honestly, and Lovingly, than to his Own Son; but had he not a Child of
his Own to have given it to, yet surely he would never have Left it, if he had
Power to Dispose of it, to a Son of his Inconstant Wife, or Friend, which bore
him to his Shame and Dishonor; but the Case is so clear for his true-Begotten
Son, as it needs no more Pleading.


A Cause Pleaded before the Judges between an Husband and his Wife.
Most Reverend Judges,
Plaintiff. HEre is a Woman Born of good Parents, brought a great Portion, and
makes a chaste Wife, yet her Husband is so Unkind, and so Cruel, as he does not
only Beat her often, but so Grievously and Sorely, as she is weary of her Life,
and therefore she beseeches your Honors to take so much Commiseration of her
Cause, as to Bind her Husband to a good Behavior, or to Grant her a Bill of
Divorce, and some Allowance from him, that she may Live Absent in Peace.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, A Husband Anger, nor yet his Corrections, is
not a sufficient Plea for a Wife to Part from her Husband; for a Woman when she
Marries, makes a Promise before God and his Divine Minister in the Sacred
Temple, that she takes her Husband to Have and to Hold, for Better for Worse,
and that she will be Dutiful and Obedient, as also Constant to him so long as
Life lasts, and so plights her troth; Wherefore, it is against the Laws of God
and his Church, to sue for a Divorce; also it is against her Duty to Complain;
Wherefore, she ought by the Laws of God, and consequently by all Other Laws, to
suffer Patiently, did she give her Husband No cause to use her so Severely.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, A Wife is not bound by any Laws but Religion,
to Hazard her Life, and she fears he will Kill her in his Fury, and therefore
for the Safety of her Life, she desires your Honors will quit her of the
Danger.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, A Wife is bound both by the Law of Nature,
and God, to Hazard her Life, not only for her Husbands Safety, Honor, and
Pleasure, but for his Humor; for a Wife is bound to Leave her Parents,
Country, and what else soever, to go with her Husband, wheresoever he goes, and
will have her go with him, were it on the Dangerous Seas, or into Barren
Deserts, or Perpetual Banishments, or Bloody Wars, besides Childbirth; all
which is more Dangerous and Painful than blows; but howsoever, it is as
Lawful for an Husband to Govern, Rule, and Correct his Wife, as for Parents
to Rule, Govern, and Correct their Children, or for Masters to Rule, Govern,
and Correct their Servants or Slaves.


Plaintiff. But Parents ought not Strike or Cruelly use their Children, nor
Masters their Servants or Slaves, without Faults committed.


Defendant Parents, Masters, and Husbands in the Case of Ruling, Governing,
Correcting, Punishing or using their Children, Servants, Slaves, and Wives,
ought to be their Own Judges, and no other. But, Most Reverend Judges, She is
not free from Fault, for though she be Chaste, yet she is a Scold, she gives her
Husband more unkind Words, than he gives her unkind Blows, and her Tongue
provokes his Hand to strike her; but as she is Lavish of her Words, so she is
of his Estate, not so much with what she Spends, as with that she Spoils, and
though he can keep her from the One, he cannot hinder her from the Other; for
she is not only Unhuswifely, and Careless of the main Stock, but she Breaks,
Rends, and Spoils all his Goods out of a Malicious Revenge, and Evil Nature;
Yet howsoever, were she the Best Wife that could be, and he the Worst Husband,
the Law has no Power to Mend him, and Help her, for the Law ought not to
intermeddle in their Quarrel, as having no more Power to take away the
Prerogative of a Husband, than the Prerogative of Parents and Masters; for
whenever the Law takes the part of a Servant against his Master, a Subject
against his Prince, a Child against his Parents, or a Wife against her Husband,
the Law does unjustly Usurp on their Rights and Privileges, which Rights and
Privileges they received from Nature, God and Morality.


A Widows Cause Pleaded before Judges in the Court of Equity.
Most Reverend Judges,
Plaintiff. HEre is a Poor Widow of a Rich Husband, who in his Lifetime did
allow her Little, and at his Death left her Less; for he only left her a small
Annuity during her Life, which is so Small, as cannot Maintain her, neither
Like his Widow, nor indeed in any Decent Fashion; for she having no Jointure,
he to Bar her of her Widows share, gave her this small Annuity, knowing that
otherwise she should have had the Third part of his Estate during Life, but he
by a Deed and Gift of a Little has cast out her Claim from the Common Law,
wherefore she does Appeal to this Court of Equity and Conscience, hoping to
have Justice accordingly.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, There is no Reason, Equity, nor Conscience,
that the Widow should carry away During her Life so Great a Part of her
Husbands Estate, as to Impoverish his Children, and Ruin his Family; besides,
it hinders the Paying of Debts, and there be very few Families, that have not
Debts as well as Children, which Creditors ought to be Paid as well, as
Children to have Portions: and were there no Debts, yet many Childrens
Portions, although but Small, would shrink a Great Estate almost into Nothing;
but if a Widow carries out the Third Part, there will be little left for
after Posterity, when every Child has had their Portion, indeed so Little, as
after Posterity will have Nothing to Live on, nor to be Bred up with, which is
the Cause there are so many Noble, Honorable, and Right Worshipful Beggars;
nay, it makes them not only Beggars, but Base and Wicked, for having not Means
according to their Births, nor Minds according to their Means, Despising their
Fortunes, they take Desperate Courses, or else their Minds are so Dejected, as
they Degenerate from their Births, and do Base Actions.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, It is against Conscience and Equity, that the
Mother, that Bred and Bore her Children, with Fear, Sorrow, Pain, and Danger of
her Life, should be left Poorer than the Children that were Born from her.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, It is against all Reason, Equity, and
Conscience, that Parents should Get and Bring forth Children, and not Provide
for those Children; for if they give them no Means to Live, as neither by
Education to Get Means, nor some Allowance or Means to Live, their Children
will have Small Reason to Thank their Parents, or Natural Affection to be
Dutiful to them, for giving them a Miserable Life, which Deserves no Thanks,
nor can Challenge a Duty; for as Children are Bound by the Laws of Nature to
Assist their Parents, so Parents are Bound by the Laws of Nature, to Provide
for their Childrens Subsistence, and when the Bonds are Broken of one Part, the
oath Part is Free. But, Most Reverend Judges, I do not Plead against the
Mothers or Wife's Livelihood; for it is not, that Mothers and Wives ought not
to be Provided for, for a Man ought to be a Kind Husband, as well as a Loving
Father, but a Wife ought not to be the Ruin either of her Own, or her Husbands
Children, and if she be a Natural Mother, she ought to Spare for her Children,
and not to Spend what her Children should have, but most Women do not only
Spend what their Children should have, but Give it away to a Second Husband, to
the Ruin of the First Husbands Children and Family; for this Reason, Wise men
that are Husbands, not knowing what their Wives will do, when they are Dead,
leave them as Little as they can, Securing their own Estates and Familes as
much as they possibly can from the Spoils and Ruins, which Strangers, as Second
Husbands make; for it were more Conscionable not to leave a Wife any
Maintenance, than Too much, and better, One should Suffer, than Many Perish, at
least it is better that a Widow should live Poorly all her Life, than that an
Honorable Family should be Poor to all Succession: Wherefore, this Widow in
Conscience ought to have no more out of her Dead Husbands Estate, than what he
has Left her, which is enough for Necessity, though not for Vanity, enoough to
Live a Solitary Widow, as she ought to do, although not enough to Enrich a
Second Husband, which a hundred to one, but she would do, if she had it; but
her Husband was a Wise Man, a Careful Father, and a Prudent Husband in not
giving his Wife the Liberty to play the Fool.


A Cause Pleaded before Judges betwixt a Master and his Servant.
Most Reverend Judges,
Plaintiff. HEre is a Poor Servant, which Served his Master Honestly, and his
Master has turned him out of his Service without his Wages, which are due
unto him by Right of Bargain and Agreement made betwixt them, which Bargain and
Agreement he has broken, and unjustly Detains his Wages.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, This Servant Accuses his Master Falsely, and
Challenges that which he ought not to have, as so much for his Wages, for the
Bargain was, that his Master would give him so much Wages to do so much Work,
he did not Hire him to be Idle, so that a Master is not bound to keep a Lasie
Servant, nor to Pay him his Wages, unless he had Done the Work he was Hired to
do, and not only to Do it, but to do according to his Masters Will and Good
Liking.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, If a Masters finding Fault shall be
sufficient to Bar a Servant of his Wages, no Servants could Live by their
Labors, for Masters would find Faults a purpose to Save their Hire.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, If Servants should live Idly, or
Disorderly, or Disobediently, or make VVast and Spoil of their Masters Goods
and Estate, and be maintained with Meat, Drink, Lodging, and Wages, their
Masters would become Poorer than their Servants, and Live in more Subjection,
rather than so, the Masters would Serve themselves, and keep no Servants; for
surely, men will rather be their Own Servants, than to be Servants, or rather
Slaves to their Servants, so that Servants would not only want Wages, but
Food, and Starve for want; for if they gain Nothing by their Labor, and have
no Means of their Own, they must upon necessity Perish; and for Examples sake,
as well as Justice, this Servant ought not to be Paid his Wages, for he does
not Deserve it, and therefore it is not his Right nor Due to Have it.


Two Lawyers Plead before Judges, a Cause betwixt a Father and his Son.
Most Reverend Judges,
Plaintiff against the Father. HEre is the Son which ought to be his Fathers
Heir, whom for Marryig against his Fathers Consent, his Father has
Dis-inherited, which is against all Law or Right, both of God, Nature, and Man.


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, Disobedient Children ought to have no Part
nor Parcel of their Parents Estate, as Lands, Goods, or whatsoever; for it the
Parents have no Duty, nor Obedience from their Child, their Child can challenge
no Part of their Parents Estate, and since he has Married Disobediently, he
ought to Live Poorly, or to get his Living by his Own Labor or Industry.


Plaintiff. Most Reverend Judges, There is no Reason, nor Law, that if one man
Commit a Fault to an other, that man should Commit an other to be quit with
him; and put the Case the Son were unnaturally Disobedient, must the Father be
unnaturally Cruel to be Revenged of him?


Defendant. Most Reverend Judges, Parents are the Fittest Judges of their
Childrens Faults and Crimes committed against them. But howsoever, Parents
cannot be thought Cruel or Unnatural to Punish the Crimes of their Children, no
more than God can be said to be Cruel or Unjust to Punish Sinners; for God who
Made Creatures, may do what he Pleases with them; for being his own Work, he
may Dispose or Order them as he Thinks best, or as he Pleases: So Parents that
Begot their Children, may do the like in things concerning themselves.


Plaintiff. But God is Merciful, wherefore Parents ought to be Natural.


Defendant. God is Just, and therefore Children ought to be Dutiful.


Plaintiff. But if God Should Punish his Creatures according to their Desert,
no man would be Saved.


Defendant. And if Children should do what they List, there would be no
Government; for Parents would be made Slaves, and their Children Masters: so if
God should not Punish Some of his Creatures, All would be Damned, and to make
up the Fullness of their Sins, they would Despise his Love, and not Fear his
Power, and so they would neither Love nor Fear God; so Children would have
neither Duty nor Obedience to their Parents: But to prove it a Clear cause, his
Estate is free from all Intails, and wholly in his own Power, to Dispose of it
as he Pleases, and to Give it to whom he will, and therefore his Son can
Challenge nothing by Law or Right.


SPEECHES TO The KING in Council.
PART V.
A Privy-Counsellours Speech to His Sovereign.
Dread Sovereign,
HEre are many of your Noble Subjects chosen out to be, I can not say
PrivyCounsellours, by reason there be too many to keep Secrets of State, which
shows we are rather Counselors for Form, than for Business, Counselors in
Name, rather than Counselors in Nature; Wherefore, we shall not need to
trouble your Majesty or our Selves, the one to Hear, the other to Speak long
Orations, or tedious Speeches; for should we Speak, we should rather speak like
Fools than Wise men, by reason we are not acquainted with your Majesty's
Cabinet Designs, or Intrigues; and so being your Majesty's General, and not
Particular Counselors, must needs speak at Random: Wherefore, we beseech
your Majesty, not to Censure our Judgments, but our Ignorances in not knowing
your Majesty's most Private, as Cabinet Desires, Designs, and Intrigues.

A Petition and Plea at the Council Table, before the King and his Council,
concerning two Brothers Condemned by the Laws to Dye.
May it Please your Most Sacred Majesty,
I Am come here to your Majesty's CouncilTable, to Plead the Cause of two
Brothers, whose Cause has been Heard, Judged, Cast, and Condemned by the
Judges of the Laws of this Land, and must suffer Death, unless your Majesty
acquit or Pardon them; Indeed their cause is Hard, for they were Forced either
to Offend the Laws of Government, or the Laws of Honor, the Laws of Government
threatened Bodily Death, the Laws of Honor threatened Infamy, and being Worthy
Persons, they chose rather to Venture Life, than to Live Dishonourably; But
their Crime, or (it may rather be called) their Justice, which the Laws of the
Land have Condemned them for, is for Killing, or rather Punishing their Sister
for the Impurity, Immodesty, Dishonesty, and Dishonor of Inchastity, which was
an Offense to the Gods, a Reproach to her Life, a Disgrace to her Race, a
Dishonor to her Kindred, and an Infamy to her Family; As for the Sin, they
past that by, to be Judged of by the Gods, her own Reproach they regarded not,
the Disgrace of her Race they endeavored to obscure; But as for the Dishonor
to her Kindred, and Infamy to her Family, her Brothers were resolved to Wash
off the Dishonor with her Blood, and to Rub out the Black spot of Infamy with
her Death, which Resolution they put in Execution, forcing a Surgeon to open an
Artery Vein; through which she Bled to Death. Besides, had they let her have
Lived, the Laws of the Land would have Punished her, which would have been a
Double Dishonor, and a Recorded Infamy, receiving as much Dishonor by her
Public Punishment, as her Private Crime. Wherefore, to prevent as well, as to
take off all Disgrace, they were her Executioners, by forcing the Surgeon to
strike an Artery, a very Easy Death for so Great an Offender: but the Natural
Affections from Brothers to a Sister, did desire she might Dye with as Little
Pain as might be: Now Dead she is, and they Condemned to Dye for her Death,
unless your Majesty will Pardon them, and it will be a Gracious Act, to pardon
Worthy Men, such men as preferred Honor before Life.

A Speech of one of the Privy-Counsellours, which is an Answer to the former
Plea and Petition.
May it Please your Majesty
TO give me leave as One of your Council to Answer this man. As for Parents to
Kill their Children, for Children to Kill their Parents, for Brethren to Kill
each other, and Sisters their Brothers, or Brothers their Sisters, or Neeces or
Nephews their Uncles or Aunts, or Uncles and Aunts to Kill their Nephews or
Neeces, or Cousin Germans, is Unnatural, or to be the Cause of their Death is
Unnatural, I may say a Great Sin in Nature; Wherefore these two Brothers, that
were the Cause, indeed the Actors in effect of their Sisters Death, have Sinned
against the Gods, Nature, and the Laws of good Government, for which they
Deserve Punishment, both in this World, and in the World after this Life; And
as for that which is called Honor, it is but the Opinion of some men, a mere
Fancy, not any Real Good, only a Name to persuade men to do Evil Actions, as to
Fight Duells, to make Wars, to Murder Friends, nay, to Murder Themselves; all
which is against Gods, Men's, and Natures Laws, which is Inhuman, Uncharitable,
Unnatural, and Impious.

The Petitioners Reply.
Most Dread Sovereign,
SInce your Majesty is pleased to hear the Suits of Humble Petitioners, and the
Causes of Pleaders, and the Defenses of Condemned Persons, as your Condemned
Subjects, at your Council-bord, their last Refuge in Extremity, appealing to
your Majesty's Self, where your Majesty sits in Person, to Hear not only
Counsels, but Complaints, I shall answer this PrivyCounsellour, whose Judgment
is more Severe, than I hope your Majesty will be in your Sentence; He says, it
is Inhuman, Uncharitable, Unnatural, and Impious for near Allies to Kill each
other; but neither your Majesty, nor your most Loyal Subjects, should nor would
think, nor believe so, if your Majesty had a Civil Rebellious War, which I
Pray the Gods to keep you from, yet in all Civil Wars near Allies Fight
against one an other, and Kill one another, believing they do not only their
King but God Good Service in so doing; for what Pious Men or Loyal Subjects
would not Kill their Fathers, or their Sons, that Fight against their King, or
do but Oppose his Will and Pleasure? nay, those that Speak against it, ought to
be accounted Traitors; and as for Honor, which is said only to be an Opinion
and Fancy of some men, yet it is such an Opinion and Fancy that without it men
would neither be Generous, nor Valiant, Just, nor Grateful, Faithful, nor
Trusty, but all men would be Sordid, Covetous, Cowards, False Cheats,
Unthankful, and Treacherous; besides, Wit and Learning would be quite
Abolished or Buried in Oblivion, and if men care not for Esteem, Respect, and
Praise, men would not care to do that which is Good, but on the contrary would
do all the Hurt and Evil they could; for Praise keeps men from Evil, more than
Laws or Punishment, and Praise is more Powerful to Persuade and to Allure men
to good, than Strength or Authority has Power to Enforce men to good, and
Honor Lives in Praise, and Praise Lives in Worthy Acts, which Worthy Acts Fame
Records, that After-ages may know, what Just, Valiant, Generous, Wise, Learned,
Witty, Ingenious, Industrious, Pious, Faithful, and Virtuous men Lived in
Former times, which Knowledge will make Posterity Desirous and Industrious to
do as their Forefathers have done. Thus do Good and Honorable Acts beget
their like in Afterages, which is a Race of Worthy Deeds. Wherefore, your
Majesty for the Good of the Present and Future times, will Favor these men
that Love Honor more than Life, and Fear Disgrace more than Death, which is
the Cause of the two Brothers, for whom I Plead and Beg your Majesty's Pardon.

The KINGS Answer.
I Neither ought to Approve the Act of those two Brothers, concerning the Death
of their Sister, nor to Obstruct or Oppose my Laws in their Condemnment: Yet
since their Act was to Take away Disgrace, and not out of Malice, and through a
Hate to the Crime, not to the Person, I am not willing to leave them to the
Punishment, and the Laws being Satisfied by their Arraignment, Judgment, and
Condemnment, I will give them their Lives, Lands, Goods, and Liberties, which
the Laws took from them, and so leave them to Gods Mercy for Grace, to Repent
their Sin.

A Privy-Counsellours Speech at the Councilbord to His Sovereign.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
THis your City, wherein your Majesty does chiefly Reside, grows Too big for
the rest of your Kingdom, indeed So big as it will be too Unruly and Unwieldy
to be Governed, and being fully Populated, it will not only be apt to Corrupt
the Air, and so cause Often and Great Plagues, which may Infect the whole
Kingdom; for where Many People are, there is much Dung and Filth, both within
the Streets and Houses, as also Foul Bodies and Corrupt Humors, which of
Necessity must be very Unwholesome; but it will Devour the rest of the
Kingdom, for it is the Mouth and Belly that Devours the Fruitful Increase of
the Land, yet Labors not to Husband the Ground: Besides, the Richest and
Noblest of your Subjects Residing for the most part in the City, as being the
Chief City, Rob the Country, and Enrich the City; for what they Receive in the
Country, they Spend in the City, so that they Feed on the Labors of the Poor
Countrymen, and are Enriched by the Vanities of the Nobles. Thus they Thrive
by Vanity, and Live by Spoils, Wasting the Plenty, Beggering the Gentry, and
Ruining the Country, and so the Kingdom. Also too Great and Populous a City is
not only a Head too Great for the Body of the Commonwealth, but like a Head
that is full of Gross Humors, indeed a Great City is a Head filled with Evil
Designs, and not only a Head with Evil Designs, but it is the Tongue of
Detraction, the Heart of Civil War, the Magazin of Warring Arms, and the
Treasury to maintain Rebellious Armies; for though they are more apt to Mutin
than to Fight, and more apt to Rise in Tumults than in Arms, yet more apt to
Take up Arms, than to Keep Peace; and though they have neither Conduct nor
Courage, yet they will Destroy with Force and Fury, whosoever will offer to
Oppose them; and their great Plenty will make them more apt to Rebel, than if
they were Pinched with Necessity; for their Wealth makes them Proud, their
Pride makes them Ambitious, their Ambition makes them Envious, their Envy makes
them Factious, their Faction makes them Mutinous, and in a Tumultuous Mutiny
they will endeavor to pull your Majesty from your Throne, break your Laws, and
make Havoc and Spoil of all the Goods and Lives of your Loyalst Ministers of
State, and Noblest Persons about you, and for the most part, the most Honest
and Worthiest Persons they can come to, they will Destroy. Thus a great City is
too Rich to be Obedient, too Proud to be Governed, too Populous to be Quiet,
and too Factious to Live Peaceably.

A Privy-Counsellours Speech to his Sovereign, concerning Trade.
Dread Sovereign,
I Think it my Duty to inform your Majesty, that Trade is so Decayed, as it
will in a short time Ruin your Kingdom, if not Timely Repaired; for this
Kingdom being an Island, Trade is the Foundation to Uphold it, without which
Foundation it will fall to Ruin; and the Chief Persons of and for Trading in
an Island are Merchants Adventurers, which are both Foreign and Home
Traffickers. These Merchants, your Majesty should Assist and Defend to the
Utmost of your Power. As for the Advancing of Trade, there be Three things, the
First is Easy Taxes for Customs; the Second is, to Secure them from Enemies at
Sea; the Third is, Not to Suffer your Neighbour-Nations to Incroach upon their
Privileges, or to Take the Trading from them: As for the first, to Lessen your
Customs, will Lessen your Revenue, and that ought not to be, by Reason your
Revenue is not so Great, as to admit of any Diminution, your Charge being
Extraordinary Great, but your Majesty may Secure them at Sea by your Shipping,
and Maintain their Privileges abroad and at home by your Power, which Actions
will not only cause your Neighbors to Fear you, but your Subjects to Love you,
the One for your Force, the Other for your Favor. And give me leave, Dread
Sovereign, to inform you, that the more Merchants Adventurers you have, the
more Power and Strength at Sea you have; for Shipping increases with their
Trade, in so much, as your Merchants Adventurers will both increase your Power
and Wealth; for if they be Rich, the Kingdom cannot be Poor, and if the
Kingdom be Rich, your Majesty cannot be Poor; besides, their Ships of Burden
are an Assistance to your Ships of War, both which I beseech the Gods to
increase for your Majesty's, and your Subjects Security.

An Oration to his Majesty, for Preventing Imminent Dangers.
Dread Sovereign,
I Think it my Duty, being one of your PrivyCounsellours, to give your Majesty
Advice, lest Sudden Dangers may Surprise you, or at least great Disorders may
give you great Troubles; for certainly, if your Majesty take not a speedy
Course to Rectify some Errors, you will soon have a Civil War, which I pray
the Gods to Avert: The first Error is, that Justice is Corrupted; the second,
that Vanity is Excessive; the third and worst, that your Treasury is Empty: To
Rectify Injustice, is, to suffer no Offices to be sold, nor Bribes to be
taken; To Rectify the Excess of Vanity, is, to see that a Law be made, that
every Degree or Quality is to be Known or Distinguished by their Habits, and to
set a Stint or Proportion in Feasting, as that the Greatest Feast shall not
Exceed such a Price or Charge, as your Majesty and your Great Council shall
think fit; And to Rectify your Empty Treasury, is, to provide that first your
Majesty's Expenses must not be above your Revenue; also to take great care,
that your Officers and Receivers do not Coosen your Majesty; for if your
Expenses be above your Revenue, and that your Officers and Receivers Deceive
you, your Majesty must be Necessitated to Tax your People, which will so much
Discontent your Subjects in General, as will cause them to Murmur, and make
them apt to Rebel, and if they should Rebel, your Majesty for want of Money,
would not be able to Resist them, or to Help your Self; also for want of Money,
your Majesty's Magazins are as Empty, as your Treasury. Wherefore, your Majesty
must be Industrious to Fill the One, and to Store the Other, that your Majesty
may have Arms and Ammunition for your use, if need Require.

A Privy-Counsellours Speech to the King, at the Council-bord.
May it Please your Majesty,
THere are some Needy, or rather Spending, or Wasting Unthrifts, that have got
from your Majesty leave for Monopolies, not caring what Harm they do your
Majesty, so they may Reap a Profit to Themselves; but were they as Meritorious
Subjects, as any your Majesty has, yet they cannot be so Deserving, as to
Displease many Thousands of your other Subjects, to Favor and Reward some Few
particular Persons, and for the Advancing and Enriching of those Persons, many
Hundreds, nay Thousands are Ruined, at least Impoverished; but if your Majesty
were any ways the Better, or received any Profit, either by Increasing and
Enriching your Treasures, or for the Service of your Wars, or that it were any
ways Beneficial for your Government, or that you did Receive any Pleasure or
Delight thereby, Monopolies ought not to be Spoken against, but it is so far
from that, as it Impoverishes your Majesty's Store, by Impoverishing your
Subjects, by their Engrossing, and then Inhansing particular Commodities, and
when the Generality of your Subjects are Poor, your Majesty cannot be Rich; for
your Revenue comes or is drawn from the Generality throughout your whole
Kingdom, and not from some Particular Persons; for though particular Persons
may make your Majesty Poor, by receiving from your Majesty Great Gifts, yet
particular Persons cannot make your Majesty Rich, with particular Presents or
Assessments. Thus particular Persons may Drain your Treasury, but not Fill it.
Neither can Monopolies nor Monopolizers serve you in your Wars; for though
Monopolies and Monopolizers may be the Cause of Civil Wars, by Discontenting
the People, yet they cannot Maintain your Wars, nor Defend your Person, nor
Pacify the People, unless by the Sacrifices of their Lives, and those will not
always Satisfy them; for whenever a Rebellion is Raised, and Civil Wars
begun, it is a long time, before there can be Peace again. Neither can
Monopolies be Beneficial to the Commonwealth, for the Commonwealth thrives in
Equal Distributions, whereas Incrochments, Ingrossings, and Hordings of several
and particular Commodities, Impoverish the Commonwealth, like as when some men
Hord up Corn, it causes a Dearth, Inhansing the Price so High as the Poorer
People are not able to Buy it, or at least not so much as daily to Feed them;
the like for Money; when Rich Miserable men Hord up Money, it makes such a
Scarcity of it, that the Poor People, although they Labor Painfully, yet
cannot get enough to Maintain Themselves, their Wives, and Children; for the
Scarcer Money is, the Cheaper is their Work, in so much as Poor Laboring men
cannot get Half the Worth of their Labor: Neither does your Majesty receive
any Pleasure or Delight by Granting Monopolies or Monopolizers; for what
Pleasure can it be to hear the Murmurs and Complaints of your Poor Subjects?
what Pleasure can it be for your Majesty to have Monopolizers, to Spend what
they get by their Monopolies, on Mistresses, Luxury, and Vanity? they are not
to Entertain your Majesty with Masks, Plays, Shows, Sports and Pastimes, for
you pay Dear for those Delights without their Assistance. The truth is, that
those Monopolizers get more, than they ought to do that way, and yet not so
much as the People loses; Like as those that Plunder a City, the City loses
more than the Soldiers get by their Plunder, for they can make little Profit
of those Commodities, that the Citizens grew Rich by, and the Soldiers do not
only Take the Goods, but Spoil the Trade; The like do Monopolizers; indeed they
are Devouring Worms in a Commonwealth, Eating out the very Bowels, which is
Trade, for without Trade a Commonwealth cannot well Subsist; for how should men
Live by one an other, but by Trading? But we are sure, that your Gracious
Majesty did not know or think what a Mischief Monopolies are in a
Commonwealth, otherwise we your Majesty's Counselors know, your Majesty
would never have Granted or Suffered such Sores upon your Loyal Subjects.

A Privy-Counsellours Speech to his Majesty at the Council-bord.
May it Please your Sacred Majesty,
THese Petitioners, that Petition for Reformations of Government, and Complain
for the Breach of their Privileges, and Exclame against their Magistrates, and
your Majesty's Ministers of State, are to be considered as Dangerous Persons,
for their Petitions are Forerunners of Civil Wars, if not Timely prevented;
for though they Cloak their Treacherous Designs under Fair and Humble Words at
the first, yet no doubt, but they will persist and go on in a Rough and Rude
manner; for what they call in their Petition, their Humble Complaints, are
Factious and Seditious Murmurings, and what they name their Humble Desires of
Redress, are Presumptuous Demands, and the Number of the Petitioners are a
Rebellious Insurrection, for which they ought to be Severely Punished, foam of
them with Imprisonment, and some with the Loss of their Goods, others to be
Punished with Death, and others with Banishment, and their Privileges ought
utterly to be Taken from them, as that they have Forfeited them to your
Majesty. Thus shall you raise Money from Mollits, Strength from Traitors, and
Peace from War.

A Privy-Counsellours Speech to his Majesty at the Council Table.
May it Please your Majesty,
THat I say I am of the opinion, that the Counsel of the Lord N. N. is too
Severe, and that it is Dangerous to Inveterate a Discontented People, but
rather they should be Palleated and Qualified with some Condescence, as also to
put out some Declarations in their Favor, which will be a means to Pacify
them, and to Allay their Discontents, and Hinder their Evil Designs; For if you
Rub a Sore, it will Fester, and may make it Gangreen, and cause a Part to fall
from the Whole: So, to Inrage a People may make them Rebel, and Fall from
their Allegiance, which otherwise it may be they would not do, and he is an Ill
Surgeon, that will Make a Wound, instead of Healing a Wound; So it were not
well to Make Traitors, that would be Loyal Subjects, or to make Wars instead
of keeping Peace, and when War is begun, it is not likely there will be any
good Agreement, until most of the Kingdom is Ruined, in which Ruin your
Majesty will be a Loser; for he is the Greatest King that has the most
Flourishing and Populous Kingdom, and he is the Happiest King, that has the
most Peaceable Subjects.

A Privy-Counsellours Speech to his Majesty at the Council-bord.
May it Please your Majesty,
THat I say I am neither of the Lord N. N. Opinion, as to put your Justice
against your Offending Subjects presently in Execution, nor of the Lord S. Y.
Opinion, to let your Offending Subjects go Unpunished, and Worse to Flatter
them, for that will make them Proud, and Pride will make them stand upon High
Terms, nay, it will make them Insult so Imperiously, as not any Condescence
will Satisfy them; for when as the People perceives their Sovereign is Afraid
of them, they become Unruly, but when they Fear their Sovereign, they are
Obedient; for it is impossible to Work upon their Good Nature, as to make them
Obey through Love and Good Will, because they have no Good Natures to Work on;
wherefore, there is none other way but Force, to make them Loyal, and to keep
them to their Allegiance; and my Advice is to your Majesty, to make your self
Strong, before you appear either to Favor them, or Disfavour them, but to be
so Long in your Results, as your Majesty has Gathered up your Strength, and
Settled your Power, and Secured your Person; otherwise you may Declare what you
will, but you shall have but Few Partakers, whilst you are Weak and Powerless;
for men Listen not so much to Words, as they are Afraid of what they See; for
Power Increases Power, whereas Words do but Multiply Words, and Lessen Power;
but when your Majesty has got a Sufficient Power to Oppose them, or to Command
them, then Declare your Will and Pleasure, and put your Justice in Execution.
Wherefore it is Requisite, that your Majesty should Store your Magazins, Man
your Forts, make Garrisons, Rigg your Navy, and Get what Money you can, to
Raise an Army if need require; also your Majesty must take great Care, that you
Employ and Entrust Honest Men and Loyal Subjects, such as have been always
Obedient, otherwise you will be Betrayed, and your own Designs will be turned
against you; for your Majesty's Affairs require now rather Honest than Subtle
men, and Wise rather than Crafty men.

ORATIONS IN Courts of MAJESTY, FROM Subjects to their KING, AND From the King
to his Subjects.
PART VI.
Complaints of the Subjects to their Sovereign.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
WE are come here not as Mutinous Rebels, but Humble Petitioners to implore
your Favor, as to redress our Grievances, and to take off our Heavy
Oppressions; for all the Profit of our Labors, which should maintain our
Lives, Wives and Children, is Forcibly Taken from us, and we do not only Pay
Taxes, but Intolerable Prices for all Commodities and Necessaries, occasioned
by Monopolies and Projects, which ingross all Particular Commodities, so that
we are Forced to Buy our Liberties to Sell, and Sell our Liberties to Buy; But
if your Majesty were a Gainer by our Loss, and were Enriched by our Poverty, we
could be well contented to be Miserable for your Majesty's Sake, either for
your Profit or Pleasure, but your Majesty injoyes it not, but Other men which
are called Courtiers, Promotors, Promooters, and Projectors, spend it Idly,
Vainly, Riotously, and we fear Wickedly; So that what we get with Labor, they
spend with Idleness, what we get with Care, they spend with Carelessness; the
truth of it is, they Wear our Lives upon their Backs, and Feed upon our Bowels;
but the worst is, that if we be Poor Half Starved, we shall neither be able to
Serve your Gracious Majesty either in Peace or War, and therefore we beseech
your Majesty for your Own sake as well as for Ours, you would be pleased to
Redress our Grievances.

The Subjects Complaint to their Sovereign, of the Abuses of their Magistrates.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
AS all Creatures make their Complaints to God, as the Highest and most
Powerful in Heaven: So we your Humble and Obedient Subjects make our
Complaints to your Majesty, as the Highest and most Powerful, being Gods
Vice-regent, on Earth; But though your Majesty is Loving and Careful of your
Poor Subjects, making Judges, Magistrates, and Officers, to keep Order, to do
Justice, to give Right, to rectify Errors, and to punish Crimes, that your
Subjects might Flourish in Peace and Plenty, yet they are so far from doing
Justice, as they make Wrongs, and do Injuries, and instead of Giving every one
their Right, they Take away our Rights from us, and instead of Order, they
commit Disorder, and instead of rectifying Errors, they make Errors, and
instead of punishing Crimes, they are the greatest Criminals themselves, and
those that are the most Honest and Peaceable of your Subjects, are most sure to
be Worst used by them, because they have not that Profit by Them, as by those
that are Disturbers, Destroyers, or Deceivers, for when They have committed
Faults, they get money for their Pardons, whereas those that commit no Fault,
need no Pardon: And as for Justice, or rather Injustice, it is sold at the Bar
or on the Bench; for Causes or Cases are not Pleaded or Decided for Truth or
Right, but for Bribes or Favor; also the Magistrate does not set the Poor
a-Work, but takes away the Poors Work, I mean not their Labor, but their
Getting, as the Profit, and so leaves them not any thing to Live on; Also they
do Rob the Subjects in General, and your Majesty in Particular; for though they
take away Much from Us, yet they pay your Majesty but Little in Comparison of
what they take, and they Use or rather Abuse your Majesty's Name, to the Ruin
of your Subjects; for they Extort by your Majesty's Name, and when we hear your
Majesty's Name, we humbly Submit and Yield to all they Demand; for not only
your Person, but your Name is Sacred to us: But give us leave to tell your
Majesty, that they are so Unsatiably Covetous, as all the Wealth of your other
Subjects will not Satisfy them, and their Covetousness makes them so
Unbelieving, and Hardhearted, as when they have taken All from us, they put us
in Prison, because we have Nothing left to Give them, and if we be not put in
Prison, we are put to Slavery, and many times our Wives and our Children are
Abused; And this is the Lamentable Condition of your Poor Subjects; for which
we implore your Majesty's Redress, knowing it is not your Majesty's Pleasure we
should suffer so miserably.

A Kings Speech to his Rebellious rout.
Beloved Subjects,
What is the Reason or Cause you gather together in such Rebellious Tumults?
Is it for fear of your Lives or Liberties? which you have no cause to Fear, for
I am not your Enemy, but your Gracious King; or is it that you are my Enemies,
and throng to Dethrone me? or is it that you would have the Absolute Power
amongst you? which Absolute Power cannot be Divided amongst Many; for if every
one has Liberty to do what he list, not any man will have Power to do what he
would; for Liberty will be lost, if every man will take upon him to Rule, and
Confusion will take place of Government. Thus striving for Liberty, you will
thrust your selves into Slavery, and out of Ambition to Rule, you will lose all
Government, and out of Covetousness to be Rich, you will make your selves
Miserably Poor; for if there be no Government, there can be no Order, if there
be no Order, there can be no Justice, and if no Justice, there can be no
Safety, if no Safety, no Peace, if no Peace, no Trade, and if no Trade, there
will be no Riches. Wherefore your best way is, to Submit and Obey, to be
Content, to be Ruled, and not seek to Govern, to enjoy your Rights, and to
revenge your Wrongs by Law and Justice, and not to make War and Confusion to
destroy your selves.

A Kings Speech to Rebellious Subjects.
I May call you Well-beloved Subjects, but I cannot call you Loving Subjects;
for although I have been Careful, Watchful, Prudent, and Just for your
Safeties, Peace, Prosperities, and Rights, yet you regard not my Safety. my
Peace, nor my Rights; Neither can I call you Good, for you are Factious,
Complaining, and full of Malice; nay, it may be a question whether I may call
you Subjects, for you Disobey all Authority, Resist the Laws, and will Obey no
Command, unless you be Forced; and though you have not Actually Rebelled, yet
you are in the Way to it, for you Dispute my Power, and would if you could,
take away my Prerogatives, but will not quit any of your Privileges, which
shows your Unconscionableness, Ungratefulness, and Unkindness to me, your
Sovereign; Besides, you are so Unreasonable, and so Evil, as you murmur at my
Harmless and Lawful Pleasures, but will abate none of your own Vanities,
Vices, and Wickednesses. The truth of it is. I have done like an Over-fond
Father, who through extreme Love and Tenderness to his Children, has given
them their Wills and Liberties So much, as they forget their Duties, and become
Disobedient through VVantonness; but had I used Severity instead of Clemency,
and had Rigorously kept you in Fear, and had Exacted More from you, and had
Yielded Less to you, and had I Curbed your Liberties, you had been more
Obedient, which would have been more Happy both for Me and for You; for then
you would have been Governed Easily, and Obeyed Willingly, by which we should
have Lived Peaceably, whereas now we are like to Ruin each other with Civil
Wars, unless Heaven open your Eyes of Understanding, to see your Faults,
Errors, and Dangers, you are like to fall into; but I hope Heaven will give you
Grace to Reform your Lives, and Conform your Manners to Live Peaceably.

A Kings Speech to Discontented Subjects.
Beloved Subjects,
I Perceive Frowning Countenances amongst my people, which does portend a
Storm, but let me advise you from raising a Storm, lest you Shipwreck the
whole Kingdom, and be Drowned your selves in the Waves of Rebellion; The
truth of it is, Raging Men are worse than Raging Billows, and worse, more
Devouring than the Sea. Yet if you are resolve'd to make War, rather make
War in Foreign Nations, than in your Own Country, and on Strangers, rather
than on your Friends; for to make War on Me, your King, and your Sovereign,
is against the Laws of God; to make War on the Protector of your Liberties,
and Father of your Country, is Unnatural; to spill your Friends Blood, is
Ungrateful and Inhuman; to Ruin your Native Country, is Barbarous; by which
Actions you will become worse than Beasts, and as bad as Devils; but if you be
so possessed with Fury, as no Entreaties will dispossess you, you must be
Scourged with Misery: the truth is, you seem by your Rebellious Actions to be
Mad, and then there is no Cure for you, but to be Let Blood in the Discontented
Veins, and I will be your Surgeon, on whom I Will try my Skill and Power, to bring
you into a Perfect Obedience; besides, I will Bind you with Bonds of Slavery,
and Whip you with Rods of Afflictions, unless you presently Conform your selves
to Peace, Law, and Government, and humbly crave Pardon for your Faults.

A Kings Speech to his Rebellious Subjects.
PRoud, Presumptuous Subjects, for so you are, that Dare bring your Sovereigns
Prerogatives in question, and to Dispute his Power; but who Gave you that
Authority? not my Ancestors, nor your Own; for my Ancestors Conquered your
Ancestors, and made them Slaves, in which Slavery you ought to have been Kept,
and not to have such Liberty as now you have, in so much as to come so Near and
so High in your Demands, as to Justle me in my Throne; only you cast a Veil of
Pretense over your Wicked Designs, the Pretense is your Rights and Privileges;
but what Rights had you, when you were Conquered? and what Privileges have you,
but what the Conqueror gave? he gave you not the Privilege to Dispute my
Power, or to Bring my Prerogatives in Question; neither have you Privilege to
Disobey my Command, to Resist my Authority, or to Break my Laws; and know,
rather than I will quit my Rights, my Birth, or my Power, I will Die first; but
my Death will not serve your turn, for I have Successors; and though your Idle
thoughts and Vain hopes persuade you you shall get more Liberty by Rebellious
Actions, yet you may be Deceived, and in the end thrust your selves in Absolute
Slavery; but it seems you had rather be Base Slaves, than Loyal Subjects, or
else you would not be so apt to Mutiny as you are, yet if you once Rebel; I
will endeavor to Destroy Every man that Opposes me, or Stands Neuter, and if I
cannot Destroy you with that Power I have, I will call in Foreign Nations that
shall Devour you; for believe, I will not be Ruined Alone, but the Ruin of the
whole Kingdom shall Accompany me.

A Recantation of the Poor Petitioning Subjects.
Most Dread Sovereign,
YOur most Sorrowful and poor Petitioning Subjects, hearing your Majesty was
Displeased at their Complaints, and Angry with them, for coming in a Company
together, imploring your Majesty's Favor and Redress of their Poor Condition,
not imagining that their Complaints would be taken as Factious and Seditious
Murmurings, or their Desires of Redress as Presumptuous Demands, or that their
Petitioning in a Company together would be taken for a Rebellious Insurrection,
they have sent Me a Poor man, not daring to Come Together as they did, to let
your Majesty know, how much Afflicted they are for your Displeasure, which
Displeasure they are more Grieved for, than for any other Affliction, that
could come either upon their Lives, Bodies, Goods, Wives, or Children; for they
do Assure your Majesty, and call Heaven to Witness for them, that they came not
for any Evil design to your Majesty, nor your Majesty's Government, but only
out of a Good Intent, believing your Majesty did not Know what they did Suffer;
but if they had Known, or but Imagined, it had been your Majesty's Will and
Pleasure they should Suffer, they would never have Complained, and rather have
Starved or Endured any Torment, than Opposed your Majesty in any thing: and if
your Majesty thinks their Ignorant Fault is beyond a Pardon, they are ready and
willing to Endure any Punishment, or to Dye at your Majesty's Command.

Repenting Subjects to their Sovereign.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
WE your most Penitent Subjects crave Pardon for our Faults, not only with
Tears in our Eyes, but Sorrow in our Hearts, for our Murmuring Speeches and
Rebellious Actions, for which we confess we Deserve to Die, or worse, as to
endure great and grievous Torments; but if your Majesty's Clemency Spare our
Bodies from Pain, and our Lives from Death, we are doubly, nay trebly bound to
your Majesty, first by our Duties, next for your Mercy, and last for our
Pardon, to be not only your Majesty's Loyal Subjects, but Loyal Slaves; And
since there is no man so Perfect, but is Subject to Offend, and not in Light or
Small Offenses, but Great and Grievous, as not only against Man and man, or
against Nature, but against God himself; We hope your Majesty will Consider our
Frail Natures, and will rather blame Nature for Making us so, than Us for Being
so. But since Repentance is the way to Forgiveness, and Absolution follows
Contrition, we with Contrite Hearts and Humble Spirits crave your Mercy.

A Kings Speech to his Good Subjects.
MY Beloved, and most Loving Subjects, (for so you are) I have required your
Assembling together, that I may see You, and you Me; for I do not Love to be as
a Stranger to my Subjects, nor I would not have my Subjects as Strangers to me;
and if it were possible, I would be acquainted with their Faces, Degrees,
Qualities, and Professions, and not only be their King, but their Friend, not
to Govern them in General, but to Counsel and Advise in Particulars. Indeed, I
have Reason to give you often Public Visits, as also Public Thanks for your
Loyalty and Love; for your Obedience seems such, as you seem to Watch for my
Commands, and your Love is such, as you seem to prefer my Safety before your
Own Lives, and my Pleasures before your Own Profits, in so much as you seem you
did Desire only to Live to Serve me; for which I Thank the Gods for making me
so Happy to be a King of such Subjects, whose only Strife is for my Favor, who
are Ambitious only for my Fame, and take a Pride in my Glory, whose Valors
Enlarge my Dominions, whose Industries Enrich my Treasuries, whose Delights are
my Pleasures, whose Love Protects my Person, and whose Prayers are for my
Health and Long Life; I can only say, that your Loyalty, Obedience, and Love,
is not to a King, that does not Regard it, nor to a Tyrant, that had rather be
Feared than Loved; but assure your selves, my Affection to my People is such,
as a Fond Fathers to his Only Son, who had rather Die for his Sons Good, than
Live to his Own Pleasure, and that all the Endeavors of his Life are for his
Sake, as to make his Son Rich, Noble, and Powerful, that he may have Respect,
Renown, and Fame amongst Strangers; The like do I for my Subjects. Indeed a
King is the Common Father of his People, and I Rejoice to See you as a Loving
Father does his Children, and so I Pray the Gods to Bless you.

SPEECHES OF Dying Persons.
PART VII.
A Kings Dying Speech to his Noble Subjects.
Faithful Counselors, Just Magistrates, Loving Friends, Noble Men, and Loyal
Subjects, you see me here Death's Prisoner; yet though I must part with my
Subjects, they shall not part with their Sovereign, for I shall leave them a
King, though I Die. I have been your Crowned King this Thirty Years, a Heavy
Weight, and a Long time of Trouble; But a King has more Title than Power, and
more Power than Pleasure: for were all his Subjects Slaves, and all did Obey
his Will, yet to Order and Govern them to his Will, requires Pains, Care, and
Study; but my Desire and Will was to make my Subjects Happy, to which end I
bent all my Industry, the which I wish, my Successor may do the like, for good
Subjects deserve a good Sovereign; Indeed, all good Subjects have not at all
times good Sovereigns, nor all good Sovereigns good Subjects, for all
Sovereigns are not Wise, nor all Subjects Loyal; for though good men make good
Subjects, yet good men do not always make good Sovereigns, as being not Piety,
nor Moral Honesty, that makes good Kings, but Industry, Observation,
Understanding, Judgment, Wit, Prudence, and Courage, that makes Kings Wise
Rulers; also Counsels, Experience, and Practice, which makes an Old King a
Better Governor than a Young King, and yet all Subjects for the most part grow
weary with their Sovereigns Age, and so consequently with their own Happiness;
but their Folly and Ingratitude is often Punished in having their Desires.
Indeed, most of mankind through Ignorance and Inconstancy desire their own
Hurt, which when they Feel, they are Displeased with the Gods for Granting that
they were Earnest with the Gods to Give them, so that they are seldom
Contented: But I wish they may have good Desires, contented Minds, and happy
Lives, and I pray the Gods, they may Flourish with my Successors in Peace and
Plenty, as they have done with Me, to whom I leave You, and Him to you:
Farewell.

A Daughters Dying Speech to her Father.
FAther, Farewell! and may that Life that Issues from My young and tender
Years, be added to Your Age! may all your Grief be Buried in my Grave, and may
the Joys, Pleasures and Delights, that did attend my Life, be Servants unto
Yours! may Comfort Dry your Eyes, God Cease your Sorrows, that, though I Die,
you may Live Happily. Why do you mourn that Death must be your Son-in-Law?
since he is a Better Husband, than any you could Choose me, or I could Choose
my Self, it is a Match that Nature and the Fates have made; Wherefore be
Content, for it is not in your Power to alter the Decrees of Fate, for Destiny
cannot be Opposed, but if you could, you would Rob me of the Happiness the Gods
intend me; for though my Body shall dwell with Death, my Soul shall dwell in
Heaven, and Holy Angels that are my Marriage Guests, will Conduct it to that
Glory, for which you have cause to Joy, and not to Grieve, for all Creatures
Live but to Die, but those that are Blessed Die to Live, and so do I. Farewell.

A Soldiers Dying Speech to his Friends.
Dear Friends,
YOu are come to see me Die, but I am sorry you shall see me Die in the Bed of
Sloth, and not in the Field of Action; for now I shall Die like a Coward,
whereas had I Died in the Field of War, I should have Died as a Valiant man;
indeed the Field of War is the Bed of Honor, wherein all Valiant and Gallant
men should Die; but Fortune has denied me that Honor, she has spared my Life
to my Loss, for those that Die in the Wars, have Greater Renowns and
Gloriouser Fame, than those that Die in Chambers of Peace; for whatsoever
Heroic Acts men have done, for the most part Die, if they Outlive them; for
such Actions Live by the Deaths of the Actors, I do not say Always, but for
the Most part, which makes me fear the Service I have done my King and Country,
will Die with me, and be Buried in Oblivions Grave, yet should the Service I
have done, be quite Forgotten, I should not Repent my Actions; for Honorable
persons and Gallant men should do what they Ought to do, although they were
certain Never to be Rewarded; for though few men are Rewarded according to
their Merits, and many have Favor, that did Never Merit a Reward, (so Unjust
is the World, Fortune, and Fame) yet their Injustice must not make men
Unworthy; but I have done my Part, and Death will do His. Farewell.

A Dying Speech of a Loving Mistress to her Beloved Servant.
SErvant, This day I should have been your Wife, and so Your Servant, as you
have been Mine, but Death has Robbed Hymen of his Rights, and now he Fights
with Life, which he will Overcome; for Death is Conqueror of All, and Triumphs
in his Spoils: Yet Death by taking my Life Prisoner, will set your Person Free
to choose an other Mistress to make a Wife, in whose Embraces I shall be Buried
and utterly Forgotten. I speak not this in Envy to Her Happiness, nor Yours,
for Envy dwells with Life, and not with Death; nor am I Loath to Die, nor Grieve
to be Forgotten, no, not by those that I Loved most and equal with my Soul; for
those I Love, I would not have them Mourn in Melancholy thoughts and Sad
remembrance of my Death, I only wish, that She that you Love next, may return
Love again, with as much Truth, Constancy, and Purity, as I have Loved you, and
may she be the Glory of her Sex, and Honor of her Husband, and may you Live to
Love each Other, and Love to Live for One an others Sake; may Nature, Time,
Fortune, Fate, and the Gods join in your Happiness. Farewell.

A Foreign Travelers Dying Speech.
Dear Friends,
I Have Traveled Far, and have seen Much of the World, and have gone Round
about the World, but now I shall Travel Out of the World, from which I shall
bring no News, I shall not come back to Relate my Journies, or to tell you what
Strange Creatures there are in the Other World, or what Dangers I escaped, or
what Adventures I have made, or what several Countries there are, and which is
good for Plantation, or what Commodities there are, or what Traffic there is
or may be; for though all Creatures are Transported, yet no Returns are Sent
back in Lieu of them, unless we believe Newborn Creatures are sent out of the
Other World into This, but that is not Probable, because they are Made in this
World, and of the same Substances of the World: But howsoever, those that are
Sent thither, as by Sickness, Casualties, Fortune, and Age, Return no more;
wherefore, I must take my Last leave of you; for though I have been at the
Confines of Death, and am Returned to my Friends again, yet I never was in the
Region of Death, a place I never was Ambitious or Desirous to go to; for though
I had the Curiosity to see the several Countries, Kingdoms, and Places in the
several parts of the World, yet I never had the Curiosity to Travel into
Death's Kingdom, no nor to see the Mansions of the Gods, which may be
Accounted a Sin. Indeed Travelers are accounted Atheistical, but if they were,
yet when they come to Die, they would change those Atheistical Opinions: and as
Bad as they are thought to be, yet they are not Afraid of Death; for then they
would not Venture their Lives so Often as they do; indeed Travelers have as
Great Courage as Soldiers have, and it is believed as Little Religion, but not
so much Hate, Envy, Malice, Revenge, nor Covetousness, unless they be
Merchants; nor they are not Robbers and Murderers, they do not Take away men's
Lives, nor Goods, as Soldiers do; but of all men, Travelers have most reason
to Adore and Worship God Best, for they see Most of his Wonderful works, which
show his Power, Might, Wisdom, and Majesty, the which makes his Creatures
Admire him, Praise him, Fear him, Love him, and Pray to him as the Great,
Omnipotent, Infinite, Eternal, Incomprehensible, and Everlasting God, to whom I
Resign my Soul, and Leave my Body to Death. Farewell.

A Lovers Dying Speech to his Beloved Mistress.
Dear Mistress,
THough I must Die, I leave my Life to Live with You, for You are the Life of
my Love, and the Love of my Life; you are the Palace of my Soul, wherein it
Lives, and will Remain, though Death does take my Body hence; for Souls Live,
though Bodies Die; yet do not Drown my Soul in Tears, nor Cloud it with your
Sorrows, but give it Light of Joy, and Please it with your Kind remembrance.
But O my Jealous thoughts do Torture more my Mind, than Pains of Death do
Torture my Weak Body, lest you should Banish the Love of Me, to Entertain a
Stranger, which if you do, the Gods will Punish you for your Inconstancy; But
pardon this my Jealousy, for Doubts proceed from Love, and your Virtue is the
Anchor of my Hopes, and Haven of Security, in which my Love lives safe,
Farewell.

A Sons Dying Speech to his Father.
FAther, I have been an Unprofitable Son, for I shall Die a Batchelour, and so
leave you no Posterity to keep alive your Name and Family, which is a Double
Grief, both to your Self and Me, indeed to Me it is a Treble Grief, because the
Fault is only Mine, loving Vain Pleasures and Liberty so much, as made me
unwilling to be Bound in Wedlock Bonds, believing that a Wife would be a
Hinderance to those Delights that Pleased me; besides, I trusted to my Youth
and Health, thinking I had time Enough to Marry and Increase; also I thought
that very Young men's Children would prove but Weak and Sickly in Body and
Mind; thus did I bring many Arguments to Live a Batchelour, until such time as
I had more Maturity of Years, and then I did intend to Choose a Wife with your
Consent, or else Consent to Marry whom you Pleased; but Death will alter that
Design, and you and I must both Submit to Heavens Decree. Yet have I this to
Comfort me, that you did never Command me to Marry, wherefore my Fault was not
a Fault of Disobedience, for I never Disobeyed you all my Life, which makes me
Die in Peace. Farewell.

A Young Virgins Dying Speech.
Dear Friends,
I Do Perceive, that Holy Angels hover about my Soul, to Bear it to the Gods,
when parted from my Body, a Virgin's Soul it is, Clothed with white Innocence,
and so fitter for their Company, as also for the Robe of Glory, which the Gods
will give me. As for my Body, though it be Young, yet is it only fit for Death,
as being Due to him, for that was made of Earth, and Death is Lord of all the
Earth does Form, Breed, and Bring forth; but Souls being of an other Nature,
those that are Celestial, Proceeding from the Gods, do to the Gods Return;
whereas Wicked Souls, that are Damned, and Proceed not from the Gods, but from
the Damned Spirits, Return to the Damned crew again: for all is Good, that does
Proceed from God, and though the Best of Souls does Sin, yet God does give them
Purging Grace, that Cleanses them from Evil, which Grace has Purified my Soul,
and made it Fit for Heaven, where I do wish all Souls may come. Farewell.

A Husbands Dying Speech to his Wife.
Wife, Farewell; for Death will Break our Marriage knot, and will Divorce our
Persons, but not Dissolve our Love, unless you be Inconstant; for Death has
not that Power to Disunite our Souls, for they may Live and Love Eternally; but
if you Marry a Second Husband, you separate our Loves, as Death will separate
our Bodies, for in that Marriage Bed you will Bury all Remembrance of me; and
so shall I doubly Die, and doubly be Buried; for your second Husband will be my
second Death; but if you Live a Widow, you will keep me still Alive, both in
your Name and Memory, where I desire to Live, until your Body Dies, and then
our Souls will meet with Joy, Delight, and Happiness; till then Farewell.

A common Courtisans Dying Speech.
KInd Friends, and Wanton Lovers, when I was in Health, you came to view my
Beauty, to hear my Voice, and to Enjoy my Person in Amorous Embraces, and all
for your own Pleasures and Delights, but I did Entertain such Visitors more for
the Lucre of Profit, than for the Pleasures of Love, more for your Presents,
than your Persons; the truth is, I was more Covetous of Wealth than Amorously
Affected; not, but that I took Pleasure in seeing my Beauty Admired, and
hearing my Wit Praised, and took delight to ensnare men's Affections with my
Attractive Graces, and was Proud of the Power I had by Nature's Favor, yet
that Power I only employed to Enrich my Self, that I might Live Bravely and
Luxuriously, or to Hord up to maintain me when I was Old. But O those Covetous
desires and Vain delights have Ruined both my Body and Soul, in Grievous Pains
I Live, and should Despairing Die, but that the Gods are Merciful, and Pardon
Penitent Sinners, for if I were to Live, I would not Live that Life I have
done, not only for my Souls sake, but for my Bodies; for had I thought of
Death, or could imagine the Pains that now I feel, the Pocky rotting Pains that
Torture my weak Body, I should have been less Covetous of Wealth, and more
Careful of Health, I should not have made my Beauty, Wit, and becoming Graces
and Adornments to entice Customers to buy Sinful Pleasures; or had I thought
of the Joys in Heaven, I should have Despised all worldly Delights; or had I
feared the Torments of Hell, I should have Spent my time in Prayers, and not in
Courtships: But Life is almost Past with me, for Death has stricken me with
his Wand so, that I cannot Live to Mend, but Die to be Forgiven, for I do
truly and unfeignedly Repent. Farewell.

A Vain young Ladies Dying Speech.
Dear Friends,
YOu are Charitable in Visiting the Sick, a Charity that I did seldom
Practice, for when I was in Health, I was so taken up with Vanities and worldly
Pleasures, as I could never Spare so much time as to Visit a sick Friend;
neither was I Charitable to the Poor, as to help to Relieve their Wants, for I
spent so much on my Braveries, as I left not any thing to give unto the Poor;
indeed, I did shun Visiting the Sick, because they put thoughts of Death in my
Mind, which thoughts did disturb my Mind, and obstruct my Delights; but if I
had thought of Death more, and had Visited the Sick oftener, I had never Lived
so Idly, nor Spent my time so Unprofitably, nor had been so Foolishly Vain,
as I have been; for I regarded nothing but Beauty, Fashions, Dressing, Dancing,
Feasting, Courtships, and Bravery, I never thought of Heaven, nor Read holy
Books of Divinity, but only lying Romances, and my Contemplation was all of
Wanton Love. It Is true, I went Often to Church, but not to Pray, but to be
Prayed to, not as a Saint, but as a Mistress, I may say as a Sinner; for I went
not to Church for Instruction, but for Destruction, more for to Show my Beauty,
than to Reform my Life, more to get VVanton Lovers, than to get Saving Grace; I
listened not to what the Preachers taught, but looked which of the Gallants eyed
me. Thus did I increase and multiply Sins under the Veil of Devotion, for which
I deserve great and grievous Punishments; but the Gods are merciful, and will
Forgive me, for now I do more Hate Vanities, than ever I did Love them, and all
my Evil thoughts are Banished from my mind; indeed Death has frighted all such
thoughts away, and Pious thoughts do take their place, and as the Gods come
near, the World shrinks from me, as Guilty of these Sins, and millions of
other Sins besides: but Death will stay no longer, for Blessed Angels bear away
my Soul. Farewell.

A Fathers Speech to his Son on his DeathBed.
Son,
I Have Lived a Long time, so Long, that, were not you a Good Son, you would
have Wished my Death, before Nature had Ordained me to Die; but as Heaven has
blessed me with Long Life, so with a Good, Loving, and Dutiful Son, which has
been a Help and Comfort to my Old Age; and as Heaven has given you Grace, and
Nature a Good Disposition to Love and Obey your Father, so Heaven and Nature
has given you Health and Ability to beget Posterity, in which I shall Live in
Name and Fame, though I Die in Body. But Son, as you have been a Helpful and
Dutiful Son, so I have been a Loving and Careful Father; for I have been more
Prudent for my Sons Good, than Vain for my Own Pleasure; I have been more
Industrions to Advance and Enrich my Son, than to Please or Delight my Self,
and I have thought my Self Happier in my Sons Life, than I have done in my Own.
Thus, Son, I have, and do Love You better than my Self, and all the Desire and
Request I have to you, is, that as I have been a Father to You, so you to be a
Father to Yours, and so I Pray the Gods to Bless you, Fortune to Favor you,
Wisdom to Help you, Nature to Strengthen you, Time to Prolong you, and when
your Time comes to Die, that we may meet in the other World with Joy and
Happiness; The Gods have Mercy of Me, and Bless You. Farewell.

FUNERAL ORATIONS.
PART VIII.
An Oration to the People concerning the Death of their Sovereign.
Dear Countrymen, and Loyal Mourners,
WE may see our Loss by our Love, and our Love by our Grief, and our Grief by
our Tears; but we have reason for our General Mourning and Sorrow in every
Heart, that our Dread Sovereign is Taken from us. He was our Earthly God, as
our Protector, Defender, Assister, Subsister, Ruler, and Governor; he
Protected us with his Justice, Defended us with his Arms, Assisted us with his
Prudence, Subsisted us with his Love, Ruled us with his Power, and Governed us
by his Laws; and such a Prince he was, as he was Dreadful to his Enemies,
Helpful to his Friends, and Careful of his Subjects; he has Enlarged his
Dominions with the Sword, and Enriched his People with the Spoils, and has
Increased his Power both by Sea and Land, and so Strengthened and Fortified his
Kingdoms, as his Subjects have no cause to Fear any Foreign Invasion, but may
safely sit with Pleasure under their own Vines: And so Wise and Good a Prince
he was, that, though he be Gone, yet he has left Peace and Plenty amongst his
People, and Power, Dominion, and Strength to his Successors, with which Heaven
grant they may Inherit his Wisdom, Moral Virtues, Divine Graces, Heroic
Spirit, Good Fortunes, and Great Fame, that though our Old Sovereign is gone to
the Gods above, yet our New Sovereign may be as a God to us here; for which let
us pray to our Sovereign Saint, to intercede for us to the Gods on High, to
indue their Deputy on Earth with Divine Influences, and Humane Wisdom, to
Govern and Rule us as he did.

A young Noble man's Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are met together as Funeral Guests to a Dead man, who died in the Flower
of his Age, and whilst he Lived, was Favored of Nature, Birth, Breeding, and
Fortune; for he was Handsome of Body, Understanding in Mind, Noble of Birth,
Knowing in Learning, and Rich in Wealth. He was Generous, Valiant, and Courtly;
he had a Pleasant Speech, and a Graceful Behavior; He was Beloved of the
Muses, Admired by the Sciences, and Attended by the Arts; he was Entertained
with the Pleasures of the World, and Feasted with the Varieties of Pleasures;
yet all could not Save him from Death. Indeed Death appears more Cruel to Youth
than to Age, because it takes Youth from the most Flourishing time of their
Life, although Youth Fears Death less than Age, not that Youth has more
Courage, but Youth does not Think of Death so often as Age does, for if Youth
had Death in their Mind, they would Fear Death more than Age does, by so much
more as they are Younger, and know the World less; but Youth thinks Death a
Long time off from them, although to many he is so Near, as ready to Seize on
them; Wherefore if those that are Young, did think they should Die Soon, they
would not be so Eager and Fond of the World as they are, nor be so Vain and
Intemperate as many Young Persons be; the brave Gallants would take little
Pleasure in New Modes, Gay Clothes, and Fair Mistresses; a Young Gallant would
be but a Dull Courtier, a Melancholy Lover, not Melancholy for his Mistress
disfavour, but at Death's approach, not for Love, but for Life; neither would
he take Pleasure in Music or Dancing, for the thoughts of Death would make him
Dance false, and put his Hearing out of Tune, and the Music would Sound to his
Ears as his Passing Bell; neither would he Eye Beauty, but if he did, the
Freshest Beauty would appear Faded; In truth all his Senses would be as Rough
and troubled Waters, disturbed by the Storms of Fear, raised in his Mind; for
the most Valiant minds are somewhat Disturbed with the thoughts of Death, by
reason the Terrors of Death are Natural to all mankind, not so much to Feel, as
to Think of, not only for the Parting of Soul and Body, and the dark Oblivion
in Death, but for the Uncertain condition after Death; for though Death is not
Sensible of Life, yet Life is Sensible of Death; so that it is the Thoughts of
Death that are Fearful, and not Death it self that is so Terrible, as being
neither Painful to Feel, nor Dreadful to Behold, because Invisible and
Insensible, having neither Shape, Sound, Sent, Taste, nor Touch; But this Noble
Person is past Thinking, and therefore past Fearing, also past Wishing; for he
does not Desire to live in this World again, he Thinks not of the World, or of
any thing in the World, he is free from all Trouble of Mind or Body; in which
Happiness let us lay him in the Tomb with his Forefathers, there to rest in
Peace and Ease.

A Generals Funeral Oration.
Beloved Friends,
THis Noble Person that lies here Dead, was once our General; a Valiant man he
was, a Skillful Soldier, a Wise Commander, and a Generous Giver; he Loved his
Soldiers more than Spoil, and Fame more than Life, he was full of Clemency and
Mercy, he would give his Enemies their Lives Freely, when he had Overcome them
Valiantly, and he was so Careful of his Own Soldiers Lives, as he would never
Adventure or put them to the Hazard, but when he saw great Probability of
Victory; Yet this Gallant man, this Excellent Soldier, whom his Enemies could
never Overcome, Death has Taken Prisoner, with whom he shall have but a dark
Lodging, and cold Entertainment. Thus Death is the most Absolute Conqueror
that is, for no Creature is able to Resist or defend themselves from Death,
whose Uncontroling Power makes him Dreadful, even to the most Valiant men, not
that they fear Death's Dart, but Death's Oblivion; for Valiant men love Life,
and fear Death more than Cowards, or else they would not Venture their Bodies
so often, were it not out of Love to Life, and Fear of Death; Yet is it not
that Life, which Cowards are so Fond of, nor that Death which they are so
Afraid of, but it is the Life of their Fame, and Death of their Name, that
Honorable and Valiant men so much Love and Fear, insomuch, that to gain the
One, and to shun the Other, they will Sacrifize their Bodily Life, and Embrace
their Bodily Death, with more Delight and Pleasure, than the Beautiful'st Woman
that ever Nature made; and they are to be Commended for it; for it is Life,
that the Gods themselves take delight in; for the Gods are pleased to Live in
the Minds of their Creatures, and are Angry if their Creatures Think or Speak
not Of them, as well as to Them: So all Worthy men Desire and Endeavor to Live
in the Minds of their own Kind, and to be Praised, at least Spoken of; for they
Desire and Endeavor to Live both in the Thoughts and Words of men, in all
Ages, and in all Nations, and by all Men, if it were possible; it being as
Natural for Worthy men to desire to be Remembered, as for all men to desire to
Live, and as Natural for men to desire to Live, as to Love themselves. But some
say, it does a man no Good to be Remembered when he is Dead: It may be answered,
that then it does a man no Good, to be Remembered whilst he Lives, for
Remembrance Lives in the Absent, and Absence is a kind of Death, but he is as
Evil a Natured man, that cares not to be Remembered by his Friends, as those
that never Remember their Friends; also he is Unnatural to his Kind, and it may
be said, that such men are Ungrateful Monsters, or Monstrous Unnatural: But
this Noble Person was Remembered and and Spoken often of by his Absent Friends,
and did Remember, and Spoke often of his Friends in their Absence, whilst he
was Living, and his Worthy and Valiant Actions will be Remembered and Spoken of
now he is Dead, in which Remembrance and Words he may Live so long as the
World lasts, as being the only Reward, this World can give to Worth and Merit,
as Piety, Moral Virtue, Valor and Generosity, Wit and Learning; for there is
no other Reward in this World, but Remembrance and Praise, which Remembrance
and Praise all Good men will give him as his due. Thus will the Tongues and
Minds of Living men Build him a Monument of Fame, wherein all his Worthy Acts
will be kept in Remembrance, though his Body be Dead, and Buried in Earth, in
which let us put it with devout Ceremony.

A judges Funeral Oration.
Dear Friends,
WE are met together to see Judge N. N's Body laid into the Grave, who in his
Lifetime was an Upright Judge, for he Judged according to Truth and Right, and
not for Fear nor Favor; he was free from Covetousness, or corrupting Bribes,
he was both a Good and a Wise Judge, for he would never Judge Over-hastily any
Cause for or against, until he had Heard all Sides; neither would he Retard or
Delay Suits Overlong, but in All Causes he was very Attentive, and in
Doubtful Causes very Cautious how to Judge, and in all Criminal Causes, or on
Life and Death, he would be very Inquisitive to Know the Truth, for he would
not Judge Rashly, as to Judge Before he had Examined strictly, and had
sufficient Proofs and Witnesses, or at least very Great Probabilities of the
Truth; Also he was neither a Temerarious nor an Over-bold Judge, neither Cruel
nor Foolishly Pitiful; for as he would not Pardon so Much nor so Many, as to
Encourage men to Offend or Commit Crimes, so he would not Condemn so Much nor
so Many, as to make a kind of a Massacre of Lives; all which made him Live with
a Good Conscience, and Die with a Good Courage, not Fearing a Condemnation,
neither in This World, nor the Next, but Desired to be Summoned to Gods
Tribunal, there to be Tried and Judged of the Course of his Life in This World,
to which Divine Judge we leave him, bearing his Body to the Grave, there to
leave that, but not to leave the Remembrance of Him, nor the due Praise his
Memory deserves.

A Sergeants or Barresters Funeral Oration.
Dear Friends,
YOu see the Body of Sergeant N. N. lies Dead, ready to be put into the Grave,
which shows, that he would not Plead for Life, or else Death had no Ears to
Hear his Suit; but if he Pleads as well for Himself at Gods Tribunal, as he did
for his Clients at the Bar, he will get Judgment on his side; the truth is,
Nature as well as Education made him a Pleader; for Naturally he had a Flowing
Speech, and a Fluent Wit, to Turn, Wind, and Form any Cause as he Liked best;
for his Wit and Eloquence was such, as to make a Doubtful Cause seem Clear,
and had he not Known by Learning the Laws so Well as he did, yet his Wit and
Eloquence would have Covered his Ignorance, and Supplied the Defect of his
Learning, but he was as Good and Learned a Lawyer, as an Excellent Pleader, and
as Honest a man as Either, for he took more Pains to Plead his Clients Cause,
than Pleasure to Take from his Clients Fees; neither would he Prolong his
Clients Suit to Drain their Purses, nor yet make his Clients Cause more
Doubtful than it was, to make them more Fearful of the Success of their
Suits, than they had Reason to fear, and all this to get More Fees; for Fears
and Desires are Prodigal Givers, as well as Promisers; But rather he Pleaded
Gratis for his Poor Clients, wherein he showed more Charity to the Poor, than
Covetousness to the Rich. Thus he was a Good and Generous Lawyer, a VVitty,
Ingenious, Eloquent Pleader; the truth is, he did not only take Pains for his
Clients, but Pleasure in his Own Wit, for he had more Delight, than Profit by
his Pleading, and yet he did not take so much Pleasure in his Own Wit and
Eloquency, as Others did which Heard him, insomuch, as more went to Hear him
Plead, than those that had Causes to be Pleaded; he Reproached not any man, nor
used Railing Speeches, or Violent Actions in his Pleading, as Many, nay Most
Pleaders do, but his Behavior was Civil, his Wit Sweet, and his Speech Gentle;
for though his Wit was Quick, Ready, and Free, yet it was neither Salt, Sour,
nor Bitter; and though his Speech was Flowing, yet it was not Rough, for it ran
in a Smooth though Full Stream; and his Behavior or Demeanor was so Graceful
and Becoming, as the One Delighted the Eyes of the Beholders, as much as the
Other the Ears of the Hearers; but though his Body be Dead, yet his Wit,
Eloquency, Elegancy, Honesty, and Abilities, are Living in the Memory of Living
men, which will Live by Tradition as Long as there are Men to Remember or
Speak: Wherefore let us Keep his Living parts in our Minds, and Bury his Dead
parts, as his Body, in the Grave, there to remain in Peace, as the other in
Fame.

A Magistrates Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are met here together to Mourn for our Loss; for the Death of This man is
not only a Loss to every Particular man, but to the whole Commonwealth; for he
was a Wise man, and an Upright and Just Magistrate, he did not Serve the
Commonwealth to Enrich Himself, as most Magistrates do, but took Pains to
Enrich the Commonwealth; nor did he Sell Justice for Bribes, but Punished
Bribe-takers; neither was he Partial, either to the Rich or Poor, but Judged
according to Right and Truth, at least to Great Probability: also he kept the
Rich from Riot, and the Poor from Idleness, and he took away Superfluities to
help Necessities, not that he Troubled any man for Living to their Degree and
Quality, but he would not Suffer any man to Live Above their Degree and
Quality; neither would he hinder men from their Lawful Pleasures and Delights,
but he would not Connive at their Disorders and Misrules, neither would he
Pardon their Wickednesses: He Regarded not the Slanders of his Enemies, nor was
he Revengefull, for he Suffered not his Enemies to be Injured, but gave them
all the Justice he could; neither was he Unjust to his Foes, nor Ungrateful to
his Friends, he had a tender Regard to the Old, Sick, Poor, and Shiftless;
Indeed he was such a Magistrate, as he was a Father, a Husband, a Brother, a
Friend, a Master, a Servant, a Slave for the Commonwealth, all which adds to
our Loss and Grief, but not to his Happiness; for his Happiness admits of no
Addition, he being as Happy as can be, in which Happiness let us leave him,
after we have Interred him with his Forefathers.

A Funeral Oration of a Student.
Fellow Students,
WE are met together to VVait upon the Dead Body of our Worthy Brother in
Learning, to be laid in Peace into the Bed of Earth, whose Life was so
Studious, as we may say, he was Partly Dead, whilst he Lived, for the most of
his Conversation was with Dead Authors, and his Study was as his Grave, so that
our Learned Brother has only Changed his Habitation and Lanlord, as from his
Study to the Earth, from his Bodily Life to Death; I confess, his Lanlord,
Death, is Covetous, for Death Exacts or Extorts the Flesh from the Bones as his
due, yet the Body is more Happy, dwelling more Peaceably with Death, than with
Life; and as his Body has made a Happy Change, so has his Soul, but his Soul
dwells not now with his Body, for the Soul is an Fnemy to Death, and Flies from
it, neither can the Soul live in the Body, when as the Body is turned into
Insipid Earth, for the Soul being of a Celestial Nature, cannot Live in a
Terrestrial place, but when Separated, being Pure in it Self, it is Light, and
being Free, as having Liberty, it is Agil, through which Propriety it Ascends
unto the Gods on High, and Lives with them Eternally. Thus our Learned Brothers
Body Resting Peaceably, and his Soul Living Blessedly, both shall meet
Gloriously, and so Let Us lay his Corpse into the Grave Humbly, Ceremoniously,
and Piously.

A Funeral Oration of a Divine.
Beloved Brethren,
THis our Dead Brother was an Holy man, both in Profession, and Life; as for
his Profession, he was a Divine, and his Practice was as Pious as his
Profession was Pure; he was Blessed of the Gods, for they Endued him with
Spiritual Graces, Inspired him with Spiritual Knowledge, and Enabled him with
Spiritual Eloquence, to Inform, Reform, and Perform the Church of God,
according to the Word of God, amongst men; but though his time of Life is
Expired, yet his true Doctrine will remain for the Satisfaction, Comfort, and
Salvation of the Souls in Living Bodies. Wherefore, let us lay his Body into
the Grave, and leave it to the time of Glorification.

A Funeral Oration of a Poet.
Beloved Brethren,
OUr Brother, whose Body is Dead, and is brought to this place to be Inurned,
was the most Fearful man that ever Nature made, not to Die, but to be
Forgotten; also he was the most Ambitious man, not for Wealth, Title, or Power,
but for Fame; In truth, he was so Ambitious, as his Body and Mind was Restless,
endeavoring to Live, like as Nature, or the Gods of Nature, which Live, and
are partly Known In their Works, and By their Works, which are their
Creatures, especially the Chief of their Creatures, which are Mankind; for we
cannot Perceive, but that the Chief Habitations of the Gods are in the Minds of
men, with which Habitations they are so Pleased and Delighted, as they Punish
those men that Neglect or Forget them; nay, the Gods Made Men, or such kind of
Creatures, to Remember them, as to Speak of them, Think of them, and to Admire
them in their Praises, Contemplations, and Adorations; also to have Visible
Worship to their Invisible Deities, as to have Altars, Priests, and
Sacrifices, to Offer Praise, Prayers, and Thanksgiving: So that the Gods are
not Satisfied to Live only To or In Themselves, but in their Creatures;
Wherefore, those men Resemble the Gods most, that desire Fame, which Fame is
to be Remembered and Praised by All Men in All Ages throughout the World;
whereas on the Contrary, those that Slight, Neglect, or Speak against Fame, as
being a Foolish Vainglory, in that it does a man No Good, to be Remembered and
Praised after the Bodily Life, are Irreligious, Ungrateful, and Unnatural:
Irreligious, not Desirous to Imitate the Gods; Ungrateful, not Divulging.
Natures Gifts; and Unnatural, caring not for the Memory of their Own Kind, as
not caring to Live with Them, which is to Live in their Minds: Also they are
Unjust to Themselves, not desiring their Own Good, as their Perpetual Name,
Memory, and Fame. But this our Brother was not of that sort of Mankind, as to
be Contented to be Buried in a Terrestrial Oblivion, but would have a Celestial
Remembrance, which the Gods Perpetuate for a Reward to his Merit. So let us lay
his Body in the Grave, and let his Praise Ring out his Peal.

A Funeral Oration of a Philosopher.
Beloved Brethren,
THis our Dead Brother, when he had Bodily Life, he was a Close Student, and
had a Great Library, wherein were more Works than he had Time to Learn, and
they were of more Several Languages, than he was Capable to Understand; but he
Endeavored, and was Advanced far in Knowledge; his Study was Natural and Moral
Philosophy, his Library the Universe, and his Several Books the Several
Creatures therein. As for Moral Philosophy, he knew well how to Compose
Commonwealths, and to Settle and Govern them; also he knew well the Natures,
Humors, Passions, and Appetites amongst Mankind, as also to Divide and
Distinguish them, and to Order, Form, and Reform them. As for Natural
Philosophy, he did not only Study the Outward Forms of several Creatures, but
their Inward Natures. In truth, his Conception was so Subtle and Peircing, his
Observation so Dilative, his Reason so Strong, his Wit so Agil, his Judgment
so Solid, his Understanding so Clear, and his Thoughts so Industrious, as they
went to the First Cause of several Effects, and he did not only Converse with
the Body, but the Soul of Nature, indeed he was Nature's Platonic Lover, and
She rewarded him in Discovering to him her most Hidden and Obscure Secrets, by
which he begot Great Wisdom and Everlasting Fame; for though his Body be Dead,
yet his Good Laws, Wise Sciences, Profitable Arts, VVitty Experiences, Graces,
Virtues, and Eloquence, will Live for the Benefit and Delight of Living men, in
all Nations and Ages; and though we have great reason to Mourn for his Bodily
Death, yet we have more reason to Rejoice for his Glorious Fame; but leaving
his Merits to Life, and his Body to Death, let us lay him into the Grave, to
Transmigrate as Nature pleases.

A Funeral Oration of a Dead Lady, Spoken by a Living Lady.
Dearly Beloved Sisters in God,
WE are met as Sorrowful Mourners, to attend this Dead Ladies Corpse to the
Grave; She was in her Life the Rule of our Actions, and will be in her Fame the
Honor of our Sex; She was Favored of Nature, the Gods, and Fortune; Nature
gave her Wit and Beauty, the Gods gave her Piety and Charity, and Fortune gave
her Wealth and Education; She was Adorned by the Graces, Beloved by the Muses,
and Attended by the Arts; She was Sociable in her Conversation, Just in her
Promises, and Generous in her Gifts; She was Industrious in all Good Actions,
Helpful to all Distressed Persons, and Grateful for all sorts of Courtisies;
She was Humble in her Own Prosperities, and full of Magnanimity in her Own
Adversities; her Mind had no Passage for any Evil, nor no Obstruction against
any Good; But to repeat or sum up the Number of this Ladies Merits, is beyond
my Rhetoric or Arithmetic; for certainly she was Composed of the Purest
Effence of Nature, and the Divinest Spirits of Heaven; She had the Piety of
Saints, the Chastity of Angels, and the Love of the Gods, in which Love let us
leave her Soul, and lay her Body in the Grave, till the time of Glorification.

A Foreiners or Strangers Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
YOu show your Charity and Humanity, and that they are not Bound up to
Particulars, or to your Friends, and Countrymen, but that they Extend to
Strangers, in coming to see this Stranger, who Died out of his Native Country,
Decently to be Buried in a Foreign Land, I mean Foreign, as from his Native
Country, although the truth is, that all the World is Common to Mankind, for
Nature has not assigned Men to any Particular place, or Part of the World, but
has given All the World freely to them, as if she made the World and all other
Creatures only for Man's sake; for all other Creatures are not so generally
Dispersed, or rather so Spreading and Branching throughout the World as Mankind
is, by reason they Belong, Breed, Prosper or Increase in Particular Climates,
as some in Cold, and others in Hot, and some in one Part of the World, and some
in Another, for some Creatures will be so far from Increasing in some
Particular Climates, as they cannot Live in them, but in all Parts of the World
that are Habitable, there be Men. It Is true, Different Climates may cause men
to be of Different Complexions, but what Complexions soever they have, they are
all of the same kind as Mankind, and of the same sort of Animals; for though
all Beasts are of Beast-kind, yet a Fox and an Ass is not one and the same sort
or kind of Beast; but there is no such different sort amongst Mankind, for
there is no difference of men in their Natural Shapes, Proprieties, Qualities,
Abilities, Capacities, Entities, or the like, unless some Defects to some
Particulars, which is nothing to the Generality, for all the kind of Mandkind
is all alike both in Body and Mind, as in their Shapes, Senses, Appetites,
Speech, Frowning, Laughing, Weeping, and the like, as also alike in their
Rational Parts, as Judging, Understanding, Conceiving, Remembering,
Apprehending, Considering, Imagining, Desiring, Joying, Grieving, Loving,
Hating, Fearing, Doubting, Hoping, Believing, and the like; And therefore,
since not any man can be accounted as a Stranger in any Part of the World,
because he has by Nature a Right as a Natural Inheritance, to Inhabit what
part or place of the World he will; But all Mankind are as Brethren, not only
by Kind, but by Inheritance, as being General Sharers and Possessors of the
World, so this Dead man ought not to be accounted as a Stranger, but a Brother;
Wherefore let us Mourn as we ought to do for a Dead Brother, and Accompany his
Hearse to the Grave with Religious Ceremony, there leaving it in Rest and Peace.

A Post-Riders Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
YOu have Expressed your Humanity and Charity in coming to this Poor, Unfortunate
man's Burial, which though he was a Poor man, yet he was an Honest man, and
therefore is much the more Worthy to be Praised; for Poverty and Necessity is a
great Temptation to Knavery, as much as Riches is a Temptation to Foolery,
which is Vanity, nay, Riches is not only Guilty of Vanity, but Vice, as Luxnry,
Pride, and Wantonness, whereas Knavery is Cheating, Coosening, Stealing, and
the like, of all which this Poor man was Free; And as he was an Honest man, so
he was a Laborious man, for his Profession of Life was a Post-Rider, an
Unfortunate Profession for him, for he Riding fast upon a Stumbling Jade, fell
down and Broke his Neck. Thus we see that Misfortunes as well as Sicknesses
bring many to their Lives ends, and many times to a Miserable end, for
Misfortunes take Life away Unawares, and sometimes Unprepared to Dye; so this
man did not Think, when he got on the Horses back, he should Ride Post to
Death, for had he thought so, he would have Chosen to Run a-Foot, a Safer,
though a Slower pace: But could his Soul Ride Post on Death to Heaven, as his
Body Rid Post on a Horse to Death, he might Outstrip many a Soul that is gone
before him; for though his Soul, as all Souls are Light, and of no Weight, yet
Death is no nimble Runner, being Cold and Numb, and nothing but Bare Bones, a
Hard Seat for a Tender Soul: Besides, the way to Heaven is so Narrow and Steep,
as Death cannot Get up, for should he Venture, his Soul would be in Danger to
be Overthrown, and cast into Hell, which is a Deep, Dark, Terrible, and
Dreadful Pit, wherein is no Hope of Getting out: The truth is, Death carries
many Evil Souls down into Hell, but Good Souls he leaves at the Bottom of the
Hill, that leads up to Heaven, from which those Souls Climb and Clamber up with
great Difficulty; for whatsoever is Excellent, is Hard to Get or Come to,
whereas that which is Bad, is Easy to be Had. But howsoever, this Poor man is
Dead, and we shall see him Buried, leaving his Soul in its Journey, and his
Body in the Grave.

A young Virgins Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren, and Sisters in God,
WE here meet, not only as Funeral Mourners, but as Marriage Guests, to Attend
and Wait upon a Young Virgin, to see her Laid into her Nuptial-bed, which is
the Grave; It Is true, her Husband, Death, is a Cold Bedfellow, but yet he
makes a Good Husband, for he will never Cross, Oppose, nor Anger her, nor give
her Cause of Grief or Sorrow, neither in his Rude Behavior, Inconstant
Appetite, nor Lewd Life, which, had she Married any other Husband, might have
made very Unhappy, whereas now she will know no Sorrow; for there is no
Whoring, Gaming, Drinking, Quarrelling, nor Prodigal Spending in the Grave, for
Death Banishes all Riot and Disorder out of his Habitations; there is no Noise
nor Disturbance in his Palace; Indeed Death's Palace is a place of Peace, Rest,
Quiet, and Silence, and therefore all are Happy that Dwell there, for there is
no Envy, Malice, Slander, nor Treachery; there Men are not Tempted with Beauty,
nor Women Flattered into Wantonness, they are Free from all Tentation or
Defamation, neither are they Troubled or Tormented with Pain or Sickness, for
Death has a Remedy for all Diseases, which is Insensibility; the truth is,
Death is not only Charitable to Help all Creatures out of Misery, but Generous,
as to be so Hopitable, that he sets Open his Gates for all Comers, insomuch, as
the Meanest Creatures that are, have a Free Entrance, and the Same
Entertainment with the Noblest, for there are no Ceremonies of State, All is in
Common; there is no Pride, nor Ambition, no Scorn, nor Disgrace; and Death's
Palace is so Spacious, as it is beyond all Measure or Circumference, being
sufficient to Receive all the Creatures Nature makes; and since there is such
Store of Company in Death, and Death so Generous and Hospitable, why should we
Fear, or be Loath to Dye? nay, why should not we Desire to Dye, and Rejoice for
those Friends that are Dead, especially Considering the Unhappiness of Life,
wherein Man is most Miserable, because he is most Sensible and Apprehensive of
what he Suffers, or what he may Suffer? But this Young Virgin is Happier by
Death than many Others are, because she has not Lived so Long to Suffer so
Much as those, that are Older, Have done, or as those that Live to be Old, Will
do. Wherefore, let us Rejoice for her Happiness, and put her into the Grave,
the Bed of Rest, there to Sleep Quietly.

A Young New-Married Wif's Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are met together at this time, to see a New-Married Wife, which is here
Dead, to be Buried; She has made an unequal Change from a Lively Hot Husband,
to a Deadly Cold Lover, yet will she be more Happy with her Dull, Dumb, Deaf,
Blind, Numb Lover, than with her Lively, Talking, Listening, Eying, Active
Husband, were he the Best Husband that could be; for Death is far the Happier
Condition than Marriage; and although Marriage at first is Pleasing, yet after
a time it is Displeasing, like Meat which is Sweet in the Mouth, but proves
Bitter in the Stomach; Indeed, the Stomach of Marriage is full of Evil Humors,
as Choler, and Melancholy; and of very Evil Disgestion, for it cannot Digest
Neglects, Disrespects, Absence, Dissembling, Adultery, Jealousy, Vain
Expenses, Waste, Spoil, Idle Time, Laziness, Examinations, Cross Answers,
Peevishness, Frowardness, Frowns, and many the like Meats, that Marriage Feeds
on: As for Pains, Sicknesses, Cares, Fears, and other Troubles in Marriage,
they are Accounted as wholesome Physic, which the Gods give them; for the Gods
are the Best Physicians, and Death is a very Good Surgeon, Curing his Patients
without Pain, for what Part soever he Touches is Insensible. Death is only
Cruel in Parting Friends from each other, for though they are Happy, whom he
Takes away, yet those that are Left behind, are Unhappy, Living in Sorrow for
their Loss; so that this Young New-Married Wife, that is Dead, is Happy, but
her Husband is a Sorrowful Widdower; But leaving Her to her Happiness, and Him
to be Comforted, let us put her into the Grave, there to Remain until the day
of Judgment, which Day will Imbody her Soul with Everlasting Glory.

A Widows Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
THis Widow, at whose Funeral we are met, Lived a very Intemperate and
Irregular Life all the time of her Widdow-hood, for which not only Nature, but
the Gods might be Angry with her; for though She did not Surfeit with Feasting,
yet She Starved her self with Fasting, and though She did not Drink her self
Drunken, as many Women in this Age will do, yet She did Weep her self Dry; She
grew not Fat and Lasie with overmuch Sleeping, but became Lean and Sick with
overmuch Watching; She VVatch'd not to Dance and Play, but to Mourn and Pray,
nor did She waste her Wealth in Vanities, but She did waste her Life in Sorrow;
She Sat not on the Knees of Amorous Lovers, but Kneeled on her Knees to God;
Her Cheeks were not Red with Paint, but Pale with Grief; She did not wear Black
Patches on her Face, but Black Mourning on her Body; She was Adorned with no
other Jewels than her Tears; She had no Diamond Pendents in her Ears, but
Transparent Tears in her Eyes, no Oriental Pearls about her Neck, but Drops of
Tears lay on her Breast; Thus was She Dressed in Tears. She suffered not Painters
to Draw the Picture of her Face, but her Thoughts did Form her Husbands Figure
in her Mind; She hung not her Chamber with Black, but her Mind with Melancholy;
She Banished all Stately Ceremonies, and Ceremonies of State, and set her self
Humbly on the Ground; She past not her time with Entertaining Visitors, but
Entertained her Self with the Remembrance of her Husband; She did not Speak
much, but Think much. In short, She was so Intemperate in her Grief, as her
Grief Killed her, it may be said she was Murdered with Grief, and no kind or
manner of Murder is Acceptable either to Nature or the Gods, but some sorts of
Murders are Hateful to both. Yet this Widow, howsoever she Offended in her
Overmuch Grieving, She had Pardon for her Praying, and to prove the Gods did
Pardon her, they Granted her Request, which was, to take her out of this World
without Painful Sickness, and so they did; for She was so free from Pains, as
She parted with Life with a Smiling Countenance, and lay as Still as if She lay
to Sleep, She breathed out her last Breath so softly, as those that stood Close
by her Bed, could not hear her Sigh, and when She was Dead, her Beauty, that
all the time of her Mourning was Obscured in her Sorrows, Appeared in her
Death, only the Gloss of her Eyes were Covered with their Lids, for Death had
Shut her Eyelids down, and Sealed up her Lips, which Lips seemed, as if they
had been Sealed with Red Colored Wax, although Death had Kissed them Cold; for
now Death is her Lover, not an Amorous, but a Deadly Lover, to whose Embraces
we must leave her Body, after we have laid it in the Bed of Earth.

An other Widdow's Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are met as Funeral or rather Marriage Guests of a Dead Widow, who is now
Re-married to her Husband in Death, and no question, but their Souls will Joy
in the Knowledge of each other; for though Bodies Dye, yet Souls do not, but
Live for ever, Death having Power only over the Sensitive, not over the
Rational Life; for Knowledge Lives, though Senses Dye; and if the Soul Lives,
no question, but all that is Inherent in the Soul Lives, as all the Passions,
Affections, Thoughts, Memory, Understanding, Judgment, Conceptions,
Speculations, Fancy, Knowledge, and the like, which are the Parts and
Ingrediences with which the Soul is Composed, Formed, and Made; Thus the Soul
being made of such Thin, Fine, Pure, and Rare Matter, Death can take no hold of
it, for Death's Power is only on Gross Corporeal Substances or Matter, not on
Celestial Bodies, but Terrestrial; but this Widows Soul was Purer than other
Souls usually are, (for there are Degrees of Purity in Souls, as well as
Degrees of Grossness in Bodies.) The truth might easily be Perceived in her
Life, for there was as much Difference between her Soul and Other Souls, as
between Souls and Bodies, at least as much Difference as between a Glorified
Soul, and a Soul Imbodied; Nay, her Soul was so Pure, as it did Purify her
Body, for it did Resine the Appetites, which Cleared the Senses; besides, her
Soul did Instruct the Senses, which made them More Sensible, so that they were
kept Clean, Clear, and Healthful by Temperance, and made Apt, Quick, and Ready
by Reason, insomuch, as Time had but a Little Power to Hurt them, and was not
Able to Destroy them without the Help of Death, had she Lived Long, but Death
to show his Power, destroyed her Body without the Help of Time, for she Lived
not to be so Old as for Time to make a Trial; yet her Body Lived Longer than
she was willing it should have done, desiring it might have Died when her
Husband Died, but the Gods Forbad it; for though any Creature, especially Man,
may Call Death when he Will, and Force him to take his Bodily Life away, yet
the Gods are Angry, if any man will not stay whilst Death comes of Himself
without Inforcement. Nevertheless, Death did Favor this Widow; for though he
did not take her so Soon as she would have Died, yet he suffered her not Long
to Live a weary Life, for which Favor she received Death with Joy, and a
Smiling Countenance, whereas Death for the most part is received with Fear and
Sadness; and since she Rejoiced at her Death, we have no Reason to Mourn now
she is Dead, especially in that she Lived and Died Virtuously, and Piously, for
which the Gods will Advance her to Everlasting Glory; For this Glory let us
Praise the Gods, and Bury her Body in her Husbands Tomb or Grave, that their
Dust or Ashes may lie together.

A Young Child's Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are the Funeral Guests to a Young Male Child, an Infant, who Died soon
after it was Born, and though all Men are Born to Live, and Live to Dye, yet
this Child was Born to Dye, Before it had Lived, I mean in Comparison of the
Age of men; Thus this Child was Born, Cried, and Died, a happy Conclusion for
the Child, that he had Finished what he was made for, in so Short a time, for
he could not have had less Pain, less Trouble, nor less Desires, to have left
the World, had he Lived longer, for Life is Restless with Desires, Sickly and
Painful with Diseases, Troublesome with Cares, Laborious with Labor, Grievous
with Losses, Fearful with Dangers, and Miserable in all; which Misery this
Child has Escaped, but had he Lived, he could not have Avoided it: besides, he
is not Guilty of Selfacting Sins, and so Deserves no Punishment, for neither
Commission nor Omission can be laid to his Charge, having no time for Either,
so that he is Free from Both, as also from Suffering, either in this World, or
the Next, unless there be such a severe Decree, as the Child shall Suffer for
his Parents faults, which Faults he could neither Hinder nor Annul, neither did
he Approve, nor Allow them, nor Assist them in Evil; But it is not probable, he
shall Suffer, being Innocent; and Death, that is Accounted the Wages of Sin,
may rather be taken as a Gift of Mercy; also Death might be said to be a
Purifier from Sin, as well as a Punisher of Sin; Wherefore, this Child is past
the Purgatory of Death, and is in the Heaven of Peace, Rest, Ease, and
Happiness, in which let us leave him, after we have Covered his Corpse with
Earth.

An Old Ladies Funeral Oration.
THis Old Lady was Favored by Nature, Fortune, and Time, Nature in her Youth
gave her Beauty, Fortune gave her Wealth, and Time and Nature gave her long
Life; She was Courted in her Youth for the Pleasures of her Beauty, and
Flattered in her Age for the Profit of her Wealth, but being Chaste and Wise,
She was neither Corrupted with the One, nor Deluded with the Other, not Tempted
with Courtship, nor Coosen'd with Flattery; and as She was Chaste and Wise, so
She was Pious, for the Gods gave her Grace, to bestow her Wealth to Charitable
uses; Thus what she Got by Fortune, she Gave to Heaven, indeed she Bought
Heaven with Fortune's Gifts, for none can get into Heaven but by Faith and Good
Deeds, and her Faith did Believe, that her Good Works would be as an Advocate
to Plead for her, and no question, but they have gotten her Suit, and her
Charity will Live here on Earth, though she be Dead, and those she Relieved
will make her their Saint; Thus she will be Sainted both on Earth and in
Heaven, which is as Great an Honor, and a more Blessed Condition, than the
Emperors had with all their Conquefts, Power, Pride, and Vanity, for the
height of their Ambition was to be Deified on Earth, and to be Sainted in as
much; They were Worshipped for Fear, She Prayed to for Love; They had
Idolatrous Worshippers, She Sanctified Petitioners; Their Idols lasted but a
time, She shall be Blessed for Evermore.

An Ancient Man's Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
AGe has Ushered our Friend to Death, and we are here met to attend him to the
Grave; it is an Human, Charitable, and Pious Service, to see the Dead laid
Decently and Ceremoniously into the Earth, and it is an Happiness for the Dead,
to be Inurned with their Forefathers; for who knows to the Contrary, but that
there may be a Natural Sympathetical Intermixing with their Dust, and an
Earthly Pleasure in their Mixture? for certainly there is a mutual Society In
the Earth, as well as On the Earth, and why may not the Earth have a
Sympathetical Intermixing and Conjunction as well as the other Elements? I
Perceive no Reason against it; but whether there be an Incorporating,
Associating, and Friendship, as Dust with Dust, I know not, surely there is a
Peaceable Abiding, having not a Sensible Feeling or Knowledge, whereas Life,
wherein Sense and Knowledge Dwells, is Restless, full of Troubles, Misfortunes,
Pains, and Sicknesses to the Body, and Perturbations in the Mind, so that the
Body is Seldom at Ease, or the Mind at Quiet; But Life has tried the
Patience, and Death the Courage of our Friend, for he was neither Impatient
with Life, nor Fearful of Death, he had such Great Experience living so Long,
as to Know, there is neither Constancy, Certainty, nor Felicity, amongst or
with the Creatures in this World, and Time had made him so Wise a man, as he
knew by Himself, that there was no man Perfect, nor truly Happy, for Happiness
and Imperfection cannot Associate together: yet by his Wisdom, he did Inform,
Reform, Rule and Govern himself as well, as Nature and the World would give
way or leave to; for he would never Command any, but those that were Willing to
Obey, and he did Obey those, he Could not Command, he would never make a
fruitless Opposition, but was free from Faction and Sedition, Ambition and
Covetousness, for he knew, there is not any VVorldly thing worth an
over-earnest Desire, nor any thing so Permanent, as could be kept Long; he
would Temperately make use of what he Had, and what he VVanted for his Use, he
did Honestly Endeavor for it, and what he could not have Easily and Freely, he
was Content to be without; Moreover, he was so Moderate in his Desires, as he
did Scarcely desire what was Necessary, and oftentimes he would Part from his
Own Maintenance to Relieve the Distresses of Others, believing he could Suffer
want more Patiently; indeed he had such a Power and Command of Himself, as the
Appetites of his Body, and Passions of his Mind, were as Obedient to his Will,
as Saints on Earth, or Angels in Heaven are to the Gods; and this Wise
Government of Himself, made him fit for the Company of the Gods, with whom we
Leave his Soul, and will Interr his Body as we ought.

An Old Begger-Womans Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
THis Woman, that is here to be Buried, was Old when she Died, very Old, and
as Poor as Old, and though she was Old, yet she had Longer Acquaintance with
her Poverty than Age, being always Poor from her Youth, indeed so Poor, as she
was Forced to Beg for her Livelihood: Thus she was a Double Beggar; but now she
is gone to Beg at Heavens Gate, both for Food and Raiment, where, if Heavens
Porter lets her In, she will be Fed with Beatifical Food, and Clothed with
Celestial Glory, a great and good Change, for here she was Fed with nothing but
Scraps, and Clothed with Rags, and much ado to Get them, not without long Stay
and earnest Entreaties; so Hard are men's Hearts and Cold are men's Charities;
the truth is, men in Prosperity feel not the Misery of Adversity, and being not
Sensible of their Want, are not Ready in their Relief: besides, they think all
that is given from their Vanities and Luxuries' is a Prodigal waste, and it is
to be Observed, that those that are Richest, are the most Uncharitable, whereas
those that have but Little, yet will give to those that have Nothing to Live
on, feeling in some sort what Want is; And to show the Hard Hearts of Mankind
to their own Kind, this Woman, although she had Begged almost Fourscore Years,
yet she got so Little, as she had nothing to Leave, not so much as to Bury her.
But as she Lived on Cold Charity, so now she Lies with Cold Death, a Cold
Condition, both Alive and Dead; the first Cold she Felt to her Grief, this last
Cold she is Insensible of to her Happiness, in which Happiness we will leave
her, and put her into the Grave of Peace.

A Young Brides Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
THis Young Virgin, that lies here Dead, ready to be Buried, this very day had
she Lived, she had been Married, for so her Lover and She had Designed, at
which designed time she little thought Death should have been her Bridegroom,
and that her VVinding sheet should be her Wedding Smock, and her Grave her
Bride-Bed, there to lie with Death, but doubtless Death was as far from her
Thoughts, as her Lover near to her Heart: for had she Believed she should have
Died so soon, or but Feared it, she would not have made such Preparations, as
usually Young Maids do for their Wedding days; indeed Young Maids have Reason
enough to Esteem much of That day, for it is the only Happy day of their Life,
it is a day which is wholly Consecrated to Love, Joy, Pleasure, Bravery,
Feasting, Dancing, Mirth and Music, on that day their Hearts are Merry, and
their Heels are Light, but after their Bridal Shoos are off, their Dancing
days are done, I mean they are done in respect of Happiness; for though
Married Wives keep more Company, and Dance and Feast oftener than Maids, having
more Liberty, yet they are not so Merry at the Heart, nor have they so Lively
Countenances, nor are so Galliard after they have been Married some time, as
they were Before they were Married, or as they were on their Wedding day, for
their Mirth is Forced, and their Actions more Constrained, though not so much
Restrained; whereas Maids and Brides, their very Thoughts as well as their
Persons Dance, Sport, and Play in their Minds: But this Young Virgin, and Dead
Bride, can neither Dance nor be Merry, neither has she Cause to Weep or be
Sad, nor she has no Amorous Thoughts toward her Bridegroom, she takes no
Notice of him, his kind Embraces do not make her Blush, neither does she Hate
or Fear him; she Grieves not for the Change, nor Thinks she of her Living
Lover, that should have been her Living Husband, but is now her Living Mourner,
whose Tears like Raining Showers have all Bedewed her Hearse; and though she
was not led with Bridemaids to the Church, yet she is brought by Virgins to the
Grave, her Hearse is Crowned, though not her Head, and Covered with white
Satin, like as a Marriage Gown, and all her Tomb is Strewn with Flowers sweet,
like to a Bridal-Bed, in which Tomb let us lay her, and then Sing Anthems
instead of Epithalamiums, and so leave her to her Rest.

A Childbed Woman's Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are met together to see a Young Dead Woman, who Died in ChildBed, to be
laid into the Bed of Earth, a Cold Bed, but yet she will not take any Harm
there, nor we shall not fear she will Catch her Death, for Death has Caught
her; the truth is, that although all Women are Tender Creatures, yet they
Endure more than Men, and do oftener Venture and Endanger their Lives than Men,
and their Lives are more Profitable than men's Lives are, for they Increase
Life, when Men for the most part Destroy Life, as witness Wars, wherein
Thousands of Lives are Destroyed, Men Fighting and Killing each other, and yet
Men think all Women mere Cowards, although they do not only Venture and
Endanger their Lives more than they do, but endure greater Pains with greater
Patience than Men usually do: Nay, Women do not only endure the Extremity of
Pain in Childbirth, but in Breeding, the Child being for the most part Sick,
and seldom at Ease; Indeed, Nature seems both Unjust and Cruel to her Femal
Creatures, especially Women, making them to endure all the Pain and Sickness in
Breeding and Bringing forth of their Young Children, and the Males to bear no
part of their Pain or Danger; the truth is, Nature has made her Male
Creatures, especially Mankind, only for Pleasure, and her Female Creatures for
Misery; Men are made for Liberty, and Women for Slavery, and not only Slaves to
Sickness, Pains, and Troubles, in Breeding, Bearing, and Bringing up their
Children, but they are Slaves to Men's Humors, nay, to their Vices and
Wickednesses, so that they are more Inslaved than any other Female Creatures,
for other Female Creatures are not so Inslaved as they; Wherefore, those Women
are most Happy that Never Marry, or Dye whilst they be Young, so that this
Young Woman that Died in Childbed is Happy, in that she Lives not to Endure
more Pain or Slavery, in which Happiness let us leave her, after we have laid
her Corpse to Rest in the Grave.

A Soldiers Funeral Oration.
Beloved Brethren,
THis Dead man, whom you attend to the Grave, was, whilst he Lived, a Valiant,
Gallant man, and an Excellent Soldier, for that was his Profession in times of
War, a Noble Profession, for all Valiant Soldiers are Honor's Sons, Death's
Friends, and Life's Enemies, for a Soldiers Profession is to Destroy Lives to
get Honor and Fame, by which Destruction Death is a Gainer; In truth, Death is
a Soldiers Companion, Camerade, and Familiar Acquaintance, but not a Soldiers
Friend, though Soldiers be Death's Friends; he is no Stranger to Soldiers,
for they see him in all Shapes, Postures, and Humors; yet the most Terrible
Aspects of Death could not Affright nor Terrify this Soldier, nor cause him
to Remove an Inch back, for he would Venture to the very Jaws of Death. Thus
Bold, Adventurous Soldiers do more Affright Death, than Death does Affright
them, insomuch that Death for the most part Runs away from Valiant men, and
Seizes on Cowards, and daring not Assault Valiant men in the Forefront, he
Steals upon them as it were Unawares, for he comes Behind Valiant men, when he
takes hold of them, or else he Seizes on them by Treachery, or Weakens their
Bodies so much by Sickness, as they are Forced to Yield; Indeed there was no
other way for Death to take this Valiant Soldier but by Sickness, for he could
never take him in the Field; But Death is of the Nature of Ungrateful men, who
Endeavor to do those most. Mischief, that have been most Bountiful to them,
and are Ready to take the Lives of those they were most Obliged to; for Valiant
men give Death Thousands of Lives to Feed on, yet he is like some Gluttons, the
more they Eat, the Leaner they are, nay, Death is so Lean, as to be only Bare
Bones, and by his Empty Scul he may be thought a Fool, having no Brains, though
he be rather a Knave than a Fool, for the Deceives or Robbs Nature and Time of
many Lives, taking them away before Nature and Time had Ordained them to Dye;
But leaving Death to Ingratitude, Cheats, and Robberies, we must also leave him
this Dead Soldiers Body for to Feed upon, for all Heroic men are Death's most
Nourishing food, they make him Strong and Lusty; and since there is no Remedy,
let us place this Dead Heroes on Deaths Table, which is to put him into the
Grave, and there leave him.

An Oration concerning the Joys of Heaven, and Torments of Hell.
Beloved Brethren,
YOu have heard of Heaven and Hell, Gods and Devils, Damnation and Salvation,
and that you shall have a Fullness of Bliss in Heaven, and be Everlastingly
Tormented in Hell; also you have heard Hell and Heaven described to you, as
that Heaven is Composed and Built all of Precious Stones, and Rich Metal, as
Gold, Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, Saphyrs, and the like; as also what Degrees and
Powers there be; and for Hell, it is described, to be Dark as Night, and yet
great Elemental Fires, in which the Damned shall be Tormented, the like for
other Torments, that Devils use as their Rods and Scourges to Punish the
Damned; also that the Devils do Curse, and the Blessed Sing and Rejoice;
Moreover, you have heard by your Teacher, and seen Painted in Pictures, both
the Shapes of Devils and Angels, the Angels with Wings, and the Devils with
Horns and Cloven feet, like Beasts; all which may be True, for any thing we
sensibly know to the Contrary, and yet Perchance all these Relations may be
False, as the Relation of the Situation of Heaven and Hell, and the
Architecture of either, or the Shapes of Devils or Angels, or the manner and
ways of their Pleasures and Delights, and their Pains and Torments; all which
may not be so, as they are Usually Described to us, but made by men's Fancies,
for no Mortal man is come either from Heaven or Hell, to tell us Punctually of
every particular Truth. Yet a Heaven and Hell, Good and Bad Angels, Pains and
Torments, Joys and Pleasures there are, for both Reason and Faith informs us,
also God himself tells us in his Holy Writs, and by his Inspired Priests and
Prophets, that there is Reward for the Good in Heaven, and Punishment for the
Bad in Hell; but if we will give our Imaginations leave to Work upon that we
cannot Know, whilst we Live here in this World, let us Imagine what is most
Probable; and first for the Situation of Heaven and Hell, or the Architecture
of either, or the Shapes of Devils or Angels, it is beyond my Imagination; yet
some Imagination may beget a Belief, at least some Probability of the Joys in
Heaven, and the Torments in Hell; Wherefore, I Will begin with the Glorified
Bodies in Heaven, which Bodies in their Glorified Condition shall have their
Senses more Perfect, and their Appetites more Quick, the Body being Purified
into a Celestial Purity, than when their Bodies were Clogged with a Terrestrial
Grossness, which made their Senses Weak, and their Appetites Dull; these
Glorified Bodies shall have their Senses Filled, and their Appetites Satisfied
in a Spiritual manner, as thus: The Sight shall have the most Beautiful,
Splendorous, Pleasant, and Glorious Objects, not that those Objects are
Corporally Without them, but only in their Sight; and such Varieties of such
Sights, as they shall see each Sight Fully to Admire them, but not to Tire
them, and being Satisfied, they shall have New, and with every New Sight a New
Admiration, and after every Admiration a New Sight: The like for the Sense of
Hearing, which shall be Filled sometimes with Eloquent Language, Witty
Expressions, and Fancy, Expressed both in Verse and Prose, sometimes Rational
Discourses, Wise Sentences, Oratory Speeches, and Learned Arguments, also
Harmonious Music, Melodious Voices, and Pleasing Vocal Sounds, with such
Variety and Delight, as Art nor Nature never knew; yet nothing shall Come from
Without to the Ear, or be Conveyed into it, but be Within it: And as for the
Sense of Sent, such Sweet Perfumes, and Ravishing Sweets shall it Smell, as
every Sent shall breed a New Desire, and every Desire a New Sent, and have in
all a Satisfaction; yet nothing of these Various Sweets, or Sweet Perfumes,
shall enter from Without into the Nostrils, but be Within them: And as for
Taste, Delitiously and with Gusto shall it Feed and Satisfy the Stomach, not
with Food, but Taste, for Taste shall be the Food, and every Appetite shall
bring a New Taste, and every Taste a New Appetite, and every Appetite shall be
Satisfied, yet in the Mouth shall not any Meat be: The like for Touch, which is
a kind of Taste, there shall be a Feeling Pleasure, where every Touch shall be
a New Pleasure, and every Pleasure shall bring a New Touch, there shall Touch
feel a Comfortable Heat from a Freezing Cold, and a Refreshing Cold, upon great
Sultry Heats, and yet no Fire nor Frost shall Touch their Bodies; there shall
it feel a Scratching Pleasure, to take off Itching Pain, yet nothing Hurt the
Body; there shall it feel a Soft and Downy Touch, as from a Hard Rough Pain,
yet nothing Press the Body, and all the Body shall feel such Ease, as if it
came from Hard Labor, and such Rest, as from a Tedious Traveling, and
Infinite of other Pleasurable and Delightful Touches, as are not to be
Expressed. Thus every Sense shall be Satisfied in a Spiritual way, without a
Gross Corporeal Substance, and the Blessed Souls of these Glorified Bodies, and
Spiritual Satisfactions of Glorified Senses and Appetites, shall be filled with
all Perfection, as a Clear Understanding, a Perfect Knowledge, a Pure Wit, a
Sound Judgment, and a Free Will, and all the Passions Regulated and Governed,
as they ought to be, into Love and Hate, as Hate to the Wicked and Damned, and
Love to the Blessed and Glorified; and such Delights shall they have not only
in the Pleasures of their Glorified Bodies, but in Themselves, such as God
himself Injoys; thus shall Souls and Bodies be Blessed and Glorified in Heaven.
And after the same manner and way, as Blessed Souls and Bodies have Delight and
Pleasure, and Fullness of Joy in Heaven, so shall the Souls and Bodies of the
Damned have Terror and Torments, and Fullness of Horror in Hell; for as the
Senses and Appetitces have Variety and Satisfation of Pleasures in Heaven, so
shall the Senses and Appetites have Variety of Terror, Dread, and Horror, and
be Surfeited with Aversion, Loathing and Reluctance, and filled with Misery and
Evil: As for the Sense of Touch in Damned Bodies, it is not probable they are
Burnt with Elemental Fire, as many Think, but their Sense of Touch has such a
Burning Feeling, as is so far beyond the Elemental Burning, as that Burning is
a Pleasure to it, and such Excessive Variety of Pains, it is probable they
have, as Art could never Invent, nor Nature make, nor Sense Feel in this World,
nor Thought of man Imagine: And for the Sense of Sent, it is not probable there
is the Smell of Brimstone and Sulphur, for that may be endured without a great
Dislike, but it is Probable and to be Believed, that their Sense of Sent smells
Varieties of filthy Stinks, yet not from Without them, as of the Devils making,
but Within themselves: And as for their Sense of Hearing, it is not probable,
that the Devils do Vocally Roar or Verbally Curse, but that the Damned have in
the Sense of Hearing, Infinite, Confused, Fearful, and Dreadful Noises,
Reproaching, Exclaming, and Cursing Words and Speeches: And as for the Sense of
Sight, it is not so much the Devils Ugly and Monstrous Shapes, which they see,
but their Sense of Sight is filled with Infinite Varieties of Ugly, Deformed,
Monstrous, and Terrible Sights. Thus it is probable the Damned are Tormented.
Also it is probable, that both the Damned and Blessed are Fixed to their Places;
for the Blessed having Fullness of Joy and a Fruition of Desire, have no
Occasion or Desire to Wander from Place to Place, for it is Restless Desire,
and Unsatisfied Appetite, that Moves and Removes, seeking for that they would
Have, and cannot Get, or for Something, they know not What, for which the
Damned may desire to Remove; but as the Blessed Saints are Fixed with a Fullness
of Joy and Admiration, not caring to Remove therefrom, so the Damned are so
Stricken with Fear and Terror, as they Dare not Remove, if they Could; and as
the Satisfaction, Variety, Pleasure, Delight and Joy of the Blessed, begins and
continues without End, so the Variety of Aversion, Terror, and Torments,
begins and continues for Ever; But the most Probable Opinion is, that the
Fullness of Joy is the Love of God, and the Fullness of Pleasure the Glory of
God, and the Horror and Torments of the Damned is the Want of that Love and
Glory.

An Oration to a Congregation.
Dearly Beloved Brethren,
MAn has not only Vain or Erroneous Imaginations or Opinions, but Beliefs,
being without Ground or Foundation, which is without Sense and Reason; for what
Sense and Reason has Man to Imagine or Believe, that Heaven, which is
Celestial, should be Composed of Terrestrial Materials, as of Pure Gold,
Crystal, and Precious Stones, and not rather Believe it to be only the
Beatifical Vision of God? and what Sense and Reason has man to Believe that
Hell is Hell, for Want of the Presence of God, whereas the Omnipotent God must
Necessarily be all Fulfilling? and is it not a strange Contradicting Opinion or
Belief, that Hell is Dark, and yet that in Hell is Elemental Fire and
Terrestrial Brimstone? and what Sense and Reason has Man to believe, that
Celestial Bodies have Terrestrial Shapes, whereas we may easily Perceive, that
all outward Shapes, Forms or Figures, are according to the Degrees of the
Purity or Grossness of the Substance or Matter they are Composed of? Wherefore,
Man has not any Reason to Believe, that Angels, which are Celestial
Substances, can have Terrestrial Shapes; and what Reason has Man to Believe,
that Angels in Heaven have the Shapes of Men on Earth; but if they should
believe they have Terrestrial Shapes, why should they believe them to have Men's
Shapes, and not the Shapes of other Creatures? it might be Answered, the Belief
Proceeds from the Son of God, who did Take upon Him the Shape of Man, but then
we may believe, that Angels are of the Shape of Doves, because the Holy Ghost,
which is Coequal and Coeternal with the Son, did Take upon Him the Shape of
that Bird. Also what Reason has man to Believe, that the Devils Shapes are
partly of the Shape of Beasts, as to have Tails, Horns, Claws, and Cloven feet?
do they believe that the Shape of Beasts is a more Wicked or Cursed Shape than
any other Animal Shape? But these Opinions or Beliefs proceed from Gross
Conceptions, made by Irregular Motions, in Gross Terrestrial Bodies, or Brains
in Mankind, who make Hell and Heaven, God, Angels and Devils, according to
their Fancies, and not according to Truth, for Man cannot Know what is not in
his Portion of Reason and Sense to Know, and yet man will Judge and Believe
that, which he cannot possibly Know, which is Ridiculous even to Human Sense
and Reason. But to Conclude, Dearly Beloved, men's Thoughts are too Weak, their
Brains too Little, their Knowledge too Obscure, and their Understandings too
Cloudy to Conceive Gods Celestial Works or Workings, or his Will or Decrees,
Fates or Destinies; Wherefore, Pray without Forming, Obey without Censuring,
Fear his Power, Love his Goodness, and Hope in his Mercy, and the Blessing of
God be amongst you.

An Oration to a Sinful Congregation.
Beloved Brethren,
YOu Live so Lewdly, Riotously, and Wickedly, as if you did not Believe there
are Gods or Devils, Heaven or Hell, Punishment or Bliss, and as if there were
none other Life after this Life, but you will find you shall be so Punished for
your Wickedness, unless you Amend, as you will Curse your Birth, Life, and
Death; for so Bad and Wicked you are, that the Seven Deadly Sins are not sins
enough for you, but Daily, nay Hourly, you Study to make more Deadly sins, nay
you are so Ingenious in Devising Sin, as you are the most subtle Artisans
therein that ever were; you are a Vitruvius for Desigining Sins, a Pygmalion
for Carving out Sins, an Apelles for Painting out Sins, a Galileus for Espying
out Sins, an Euclid for Numbering and Multiplying Sins, so that your Sins are
now past all Account, an Archimedes for Inventing Sins, an Aristoteles to Find
out Sins, a Cicero in Pleading for Sins, an Alexander in Fighting for Sins, an
Homerus in Describing Sins, and your Lives and Actions are the Foundations, and
Materials, the Stones and Chisals of Sins, the Boords and Planks, the Light,
Shaddows, and Colors of Sins, the Perspective Glasses of Sins, the Figures of
Sins, the Instruments and Engines of Sins, the Lines, Circles, and Squares of
Sins, the Bodies, Parts, and Lives of Sins, the Tongue and Speech of Sin, the
Arms of Sin, the Brains and Wit of Sin: Thus you are nothing but Sin Within and
Without, for Life, Soul, Thoughts, Bodies and Actions are all Sin; Indeed you
seem, as if you were neither Made by Nature nor God, but Begotten or Produced
from Devils; for Nature Exclames against you, and God Abhorrs you, the Devils
will Own you, but God of his Mercy give you Grace to Repent and Amend your
Lives, that what Sin is Past, may be Blotted out, and that your Lives, Thoughts
and Actions may be such, as may Gain upon Eternal Blessedness, and Everlasting
Glory, for which let us Pray.

An Oration, which is an Exhortation to a Pious Life.
Beloved Brethren,
YOu come here to be Instructed, but yet you do not Amend your Lives, for you
Live Idly and Wickedly, you make no Profit of your Instructions or
Exhortations, for it seems by you, that the more you are Taught, the more
Ignorant you are, like those that become Blind, or their Sight Dazzled with Too
much Light; Indeed you Live as if you had not Rational Souls, or that you
thought Souls Die as Bodies do, but you will find you have Souls that shall
Live to endure Torment, if you do not Reform your Lives: It Is true, many have
Strange, and some, Atheistical Opinions concerning the Soul, for Some have had
Opinions, that Man has no other Soul, but such as Beasts have, and Others,
that the Souls of all Creatures Go out of one Body into an other, and that
Death does but Change the Souls Lodging; and Some have had an Opinion, that
there is no such thing as a Soul, but that which is called a Soul, is only
Animal Life; and Others believe there be Souls, but they Die as Bodies do;
Others, that there is but One great Soul, which is the Soul of the World; but
the Right and Truth is, that men have Particular Souls, which not any other
Creature has, which are called Rational Souls, and shall Live for Ever, either
in Torment or Bliss, according to their Merit; But the Best and Wisest men make
no question of the Rational Soul of Mankind, though many Learned men Trouble
their Heads to prove What the Soul is, for some believe the Soul is Corporeal,
others it is Incorporeal. Also many Trouble themselves to know, When the Souls
of Mankind Enter into their Bodies, some think Before the Body is Born; others
hold, it enters not Until the Body is Born; and some think, that the Body
receives the Soul so soon as it receives Life in the Womb; and some think
Before, as when it is newly Conceived: but those that are of an Opinion, that
Life and Soul enters into the Body together, believe their Departs together by
Death; and those that think the Soul enters not into the Body until it be
Born, believe the Soul is but a Weakling at first, and grows Stronger as the
Body grows Older. Thus they Trouble their Heads, and Exercise their Wits
concerning the Soul, to know What it is, and How it is, but never take Thought
as how it Will be when they Dye, like the Dog that left the Substance to seek
for the Shadow, so men leave the Salvation, and Dispute about the Creation:
But my Exhortation is, that you would Pray more, and Dispute less; for what
shall we need to Trouble our Minds, whether the Soul be Corporeal or
Incorporeal? or if Corporeal, of what Matter it is made of, so that it be
Capable of Glory? nor shall we need to Trouble our Minds, When it Enters the
Body, so it Enters Heaven. Wherefore those that are Truly Wise, and Wisely
Devout, will Endeavor with all their Power, Faith, and Industry of their
Minds, Thoughts, and Life, to Do such Charitable Deeds, and to Think such Pious
Thoughts in Holy Contemplations, and Pray with so much Zeal and Faith,
Penitence and Thanksgiving, as God may be so well Pleased with them, as to
Glorify their Souls in Heaven; where there is all Joy and Happiness, which Joy
and Happiness I Pray the Gods may give you.

MARRIAGE ORATIONS.
PART IX.
A Marriage-Oration to a Congregation, and a Young Bride and Bridegroom.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are met together as Bridal-Guests to see this Young Man and Woman Married,
who are to be Bound, Tied, and Manacled with Holy Ceremony, Vows and Promises,
yet all too little to Tie some Couples Fast, for many do not only Loosen those
Bonds with taking Unlawful Liberty, but quite Break them by Divorce, which
shows the Unruliness and Untowardness of Married People, or else it shows the
Unsufferable Condition of a Married Life, and yet for all the Proofs, Trials,
and Examples of the Evils that are in Marriage, Men and Women will take no
Warning, for not only Maids and Batchelours, but VViddows and VViddowers run
Headlong into the Noose or Marriage Halter; I do not say this, to Discourage
this Young Couple, but to Advise them, when they are Married, to Live
Temperately, Prudently, Lovingly, and Peaceably, that they may not Surseit
their Fond and Eager Appetites, which Causes the Sickness of Aversion, and
Death of Affection, or Prodigally Waste their Maintenance, or Idly Spend
their Time, for Poverty breaks Friendship, and turns near Friends to Foes; nor
Live Inconstantly, for that makes Jealousy, and Jealousy Hate; nor Live
Quarrelsome, for that makes Faction, Faction Division, and Division Divorce;
whereas Temperance makes Constancy, Prudence Plenty, Love keeps Peace, and
Peace makes Happiness, which Happiness I wish this Young Couple, and so I will
Join their Hands, Praying that God will Join their Hearts with an United Love
and Felicity.

A Marriage-Oration to a Congregation, and an Old Bride and Young Bridegroom.
Beloved Brethren,
WE are met together as MarriageGuests, to see this Couple Married together,
although it be an Unequal match, the Bride being Aged, and the Bridegroom
Young, She too Old for him, and He too Young for her; which shows, as if She
wanted Wit, and He Wealth; but I hope neither of them will want that Love,
which ought to be betwixt a Man and Wife: I say not this, to Hinder their
Marriage, for if They do Agree, every one ought to Approve it, and if they
should not Agree, None will Suffer but Themselves, either in the Opinion of
their Neighbors and Friends, or in their Own Discontents; for their Neighbors
will Censure Both, as if She was too Amorous for her Age, and He too Covetous
for his Youth, and that Time will Cool the One, and Riot Consume the Other;
which if it prove so, you will wish one another Dead, but not Love one another
Living; whereas when you Agree Kindly, and Live Orderly, you will be Praised.
VVorthily, and so much the More, as being Unusual, and therefore not Expected:
for who would not believe, but that an Old Wife should be Jealous, and a Young
Husband VVanton? or who will believe an Old Wife to be Pleasing, and a Young
Husband Continent? But this true Pleasure and Constancy I wish you, and will
Join your Hands, Praying for your Happiness.

A Marriage-Oration to a Congregation, and a Young Bride and Aged Bridegroom.
Beloved Brethren,
HEre is a Loving Aged Man, and a Chaste Young Woman to be Joined in Holy
Matrimony, which shows the Man to have Courage, the Woman to be Prudent; for
surely it is very Dangerous for an Aged man to Marry a Young Woman, especially
an Handsome Young Woman, not only that Youth is apt to be Inconstant and Loves
Variety, but Youth and Beauty is a Temptation to Amorous Lovers, which will lay
Siege and make Assaults, endeavoring with all their Flattery, Bribes, Vanity,
and Prodigality, to Corrupt, Betray, and Win her; But she is Prudent to Choose
an Expericed man, Preferring VVisdome before Youth, Wit before Beauty, Love
before Courtship, and Temperance before Pleasure: all which Fore-shews, she
will make a Chaste Wife, which will keep her Husbands Love, and her Own
Reputation, which Love and Chastity will make them Happy, and both will make
them Honorable, to which Respect and Happiness I Join them inseparably.

A Marriage-Oration of two Poor Servants.
Beloved Brethren,
YOu have attended these two Poor Servants to the Church, as their
Bridal-Guests, to VVitness their Lawful Marriage, by which you do them Honor,
and if you will also do them Good, you will bestow on them an Offering, for
though each Person should give but a Small Gift, yet in the whole Sum it will
be Great to them, so that it will not be Mist in your Purses, and yet be a
Benefit to their Lives, for it may make them Rich, and your selves not Poor;
but if you give them not Any, they may nevertheless by their Industry Thrive,
for as they have Wrought Honestly for their Master and Mistress, so they will
Labor Honestly for Themselves, and as their Master did Thrive by their
Service, so they Hope to Thrive in Serving themselves, and so in time they may
become Master and Mistress to Servants, as they were Servants to Master and
Mistress; for Prudent Industry and Thrifty Sparing makes the Poor Rich, and
Riches does Advance them to Honor, whereas Carelessness, Riot, and Vain
Expenses make Rich men Poor, and Noble men Mean, so that in time Laboring
Peasants, and Thriving Citizens Posterities, come to be Rich Men and Great
Lords, when as the Posterity of Rich Men and Great Lords, through their
Prodigality comes to be Poor Laboring men and Slaves, for Heaven Blesses the
Industry of the Poor, but Punishes the Riot of the Rich; which Blessing be upon
This Couple, and so let us Join their Hands with Holy Ceremony, and Heaven Join
their Hearts with Love.

ORATIONS TO CITIZENS In the Marketplace.
PART X.
An Oration against Excess and Vanity.
Fellow Citizens,
I Observe great Excess in Stately and Chargeable Buildings, Rich and Costly
Furnishings, Vain Adornings, Wastefull Feasting, Idle Enter taining, and
Unprofitable Attendances, and the like Vanities. First for your Building, you
Build not only for Convenience and Decency, but for State and Magnificence, and
you Build not only Large and High, as if you would Spread to the Circumference
of the Earth, and Ascend to the Mansions of the Gods, but you Endeavor to Work
beyond Nature for Curiosities in Cutting, Carving, Ingraving, and Painting to
the Life; also you Dig to the Abyfs, as to the Center of the Earth, for several
Materials, as Diverse sorts of Stones and Metalls, and Endeavor to make your
Palaces to Outshine the Sun with Gold, wherein you waste so much Gold and
Silver, in Vain and Improfitable Gilding and Interlaying, that there is not
Enough left to make Coin for Traffic; also your Stately Building does not only
Ruin your Posterity, leaving them more Houses than Land, but you Ruin the
Poor, enclosing the Land with your VValls, and filling up Lands with Houses,
whereas Corn and Fruits should Grow; thus you Tread upon the Bellies, Backs,
and Heads of the Poor. And as for your Rich and Costly Furniture, it Cost much
and VVears out soon, yielding no Profit, for the Principal of so much Money is
Waste, and no Use made thereof. Secondly, for your Feasting, wherewith you
Eat rather to be Sick, than to Prolong Life, you Spoil more than you Eat, and
Eat more than you have Appetite; you are like Misers in your Feeding, stuffing
your Stomachs with Meat, as they do their Trunks and Baggs with Money, and the
Superfluity of meat Destroys the Gluttonous Eater with Surfeits. Thirdly, your
Adorning or rather Deforming your selves in Antic Fashions, and Toyish
Vanities, which shows your Heads to be Brainless, and sometimes your Purses
to be Moneyless, for Spending so much on your Backs, you cannot Keep any thing
in your Coffers, nor for your Necessary use. Fourthly, your Idle Visits and
Unprofitable Discourses, wherein is more Words than Wit, and more Time lost
than Knowledge gained, for you become more Ignorant with Talking, than Learned
with Contemplating, for Brains are not Manured with Foolish Discourses, but
Wise Considerations. Lastly, your Numerous Trains, which are Unprofitable
Servants, being maintained for Show, and not for Use, they Spending much, and
doing little Service, is the Cause not only of great Disorders, but the Ruin
of many Noble Families. The Short is, you Drink to be Drunk, Eat to be Sick,
Live to be Idle, Spend to be Poor, and Talk to be Fools: Thus you Lose Time,
Waste your Estate, Trouble your Minds, and Shorten your Lives, Living with more
Cost than Worship, and more Worship than Pleasure; for you are Stewards for
your Servants, Hosts for your Guests, and Slaves to your Vain Humors.

An Oration Contradicting the Former.
Noble Citizens,
THe Former Oration was against the Lawful Delights and Pleasures of our
Citizens, nay, of all Mankind, which Expresses the Orator either to be so Poor
of Means, as he Cannot Attain to such Delights and Pleasures; or that his
Senses are Imperfect, as not Capable to Receive them, or that he is of so Evil
a Disposition, as to Desire all men to be Miserable, or that he is a Fool, as
not Knowing how to Speak or Live wisely, whereas had he Spoken against Hurtful
and Destroying Vices, he had Spoken as a Good man ought to do, for Vices are
Vices, no otherwise but that they are Hurtful or Destructive to Mankind, which
makes them Vices, for the Gods Forbid them, because of the Evil Effects; as
Drunkenness, which Disorders the Reason, Distempers the Brain, and Obstructs
the Senses, making men Senseless, or to be as Mad, and causes oftentimes
Quarrels, Wounds, and Death, at least Breaks Peace, and makes Enemies of
Friends; besides, Drunkenness makes men Sick, and is apt to Shorten their
Lives, all which makes it a Vice, and so a Sin; But did Drunkenness cause no
Evil Effect, it ought not to be Forbidden, nor could it be accounted a Crime.
The like I may say for Gluttony, for would men Eat only to Please them, and not
so much as to Disease them, it would be no Fault to Eat well; or to Please
their Palate, but it is the Surfeits; Sickness, and oftentimes Untimely Death,
that makes Gluttony a Vice; and for Adultery, it would be so far from a Crime,
as it would be a Virtue in the Increase of Mankind, were it not for the Loss of
Propriety, in that no man would Know his Own Child, nor be sure to Enjoy his
Own Wife, or that Woman he makes Choice of. As for Theft and Murder, they are
not of that Sort to be named Vices only, but Damnable Sins, wherein can neither
be Society, Safety, nor Security of Life, for Thieves and Murderers endeavor
an Utter Destruction without Mercy or Remorse; Wherefore, since Vices and Sins
are Vices and Sins, for their Hurt and Evil Effects, those things that are
called Vanities, which produce Pleasure and Delight without Death and
Destruction, ought not to be Spoken against; for Vanities are Profitable to the
Poor, and not Hurtful to the Rich; But yet Moralists and Divines Plead,
Preach, and Write, Rail and Exclame against all Honest, Harmless Delights and
Pleasures, as if they were Sins to God and Nature, as if Nature and the God of
Nature should make Senses and Appetites in Vain, or only to the Hurt and
Dislike of the Creature, and not for their Good and Pleasure, as to make a Body
for Pain and Sickness, and not for Health and Ease, and to make a Mind for
Trouble and Discontent, and not for Peace and Tranqullity, to make Desires, but
not Fruitions: Indeed Nature and the God of Nature is more Just to Mankind; for
as they have made Eyes and Seeing, so they have made Light, Splendor, and
Beauty to be Seen; and as they have made Ears to Hear, so they have made
Harmony to be Heard; and as they have made Nostrils to Smell, so they have made
Perfumes to be Smelt; and as they have made Taste, so they have made Relishes;
and as they have made Hunger, so they have made Food; and as they have made
Appetites, so they have given Satisfaction or Satiety. Thus we may perceive,
that every Particular Sense is Fitted or Matched to Particular Pleasures; but
because Nature has made some Aversion, therefore Moralists and Divines would
not have men Enjoy the Pleasure in Nature, whereas the most Rational men
perceive, that Aversions were only made to Highten and Re-double the Pleasures
and Delights both of Body and Mind; but these Men are so Rigid in their
Doctrine, (I will not say, in their own particular Practice) as they would have
men Choose the Worst part, and Refuse the Better, and would have all Mankind
Struggle, Strive, and Oppose all Nature's Delights and Benefits; the truth is,
they seem to Desire a Perpetual War between the Senses and the Objects, as
also between the Mind and the Body, as between the Reason and Sense; but in my
opinion, their Doctrine has neither Sense nor Reason, and their Authors would
have as Little, if they should Practice what they Preach. Wherefore, Noble
Citizens, my Advise is, that you Take your Pleasures, yet so, as you may Enjoy
them Long, as to Warm your Selves, not to Burn your Selves, to View the Light,
but not to Gaze out your Sight, to Bathe your Selves, but not to Drown your
Selves, to Please your Selves, but not to Destroy your Selves with Excess.

An Oration against Usurers, and MoneyHorders.
Noble Citizens,
WE have some Citizens amongst us, that are Rich, and yet Miserable, they
Covet Much, yet Enjoy but Little, for they Hord up their Wealth, and Starve
Themselves; and if they did Starve None but Themselves, it were no great
matter, being fitter for Death than Life, but their Hords impoverish the
Commonwealth, and so Starve the Poor; for there cannot be a Greater Evil in a
Commonwealth, set a-side War, than to have many Rich Usurers, as Covetous
Getters, and Spare Spenders; for their Great Wealth is like as a Great
Dunghill, which, whilst it lies on a Heap together, does no Good, but Hurt,
whereas if it were Dispersed and Spread upon the Barren Lands, it would Enrich
much Ground, producing Increase and Plenty. The like should Money or such sort
of Riches be Spread equally, to make a Commonwealth Live Happily; Indeed, a
Prodigal is more Beneficial, and Profitable to a Commonwealth than a Usurer,
for a Prodigal makes only Himself Poor, and the Commonwealth Rich, whereas a
Miserable man makes only Himself Rich, and the Commonwealth Poor. It Is true,
Riches is accounted a great Blessing, and Surely it is so, but I take Riches to
be only a Blessing in the Use, and not Barely in the Possession, for Riches is
not what we Have, but what we Enjoy; for he that has Delicious Fruits, and
will Eat Sour Crabs; has Reviving Wines, and will Drink Insipid Water; has
Stately Houses, and will Live in a Thatched Cottage; has Store of Fuel, and
will Freeze with Cold; and has great Sums of Money, but will Spend none,
those are Poorer than they that Have but a Little, and will Spend according to
their Estate; yet these Miserable men that Live Starvingly, Slovenly, and
Unwholesomely, are Commended by the Moralists, and Accounted Wise men, as not
taking Pleasure in that they call Vanities, which is to make Use of their
Riches, as to Live Plentifully; Pleasantly, Gloriously, and Magnificently, if
they have wherewithal to Live so, pleasing Themselves with what Good Fortune
has given them. I for my part, I had rather Live Rich, and Dye Poor, than Dye
Rich, and Live Poor, and leave my Wealth to those, that will be so far from
Acknowledging my Gifts with Thanks, by Praising me for them, as it is likely
they would Rail on my Memory, so that my Wealth would only Build me a Tomb of
Reproaches, and a Monument of Infamy, which would be a Just Judgment for being
so Unnatural to my Self. But Miserable men believe, they are Masters to their
Wealth, because they have it in Keeping, when as they are Slaves, not Daring to
Use it, unless it be in getting Ten in the Hundred: I Confess, if such men had
Children, being for the most part Childless, there were some Excuse for them,
but yet Fathers should not make Themselves Miserable, to make their Sons
Prodigal, for a Rich Son of a Miserable Father is commonly a Spend-thrist; and
as Fathers are bound by Nature to Provide for their Children in a Wise
Proportion, so they are bound by Nature to Maintain Themselves so Plentifully,
as to Enjoy a Happy Life. But to Conclude, those that are Miserable Horders, or
Uncnscionable Usurers, are like as Weesels, or such like Vermin; for as these
Suck out the Meat of an Egg, so they Suck out Silver and Gold, and leave the
Commonwealth like as an Empty Egg-shell, which is a Penny-less Purse or
Treasury.

An Oration concerning the Education of Children.
Fellow Citizens,
I Commend your Love and Care, which you seem to have of your Sons, as to have
them Taught and Instructed in Arts and Sciences, as also when they are Grown up
toward Manhood, to send them abroad to see Foreign and several Nations, for to
be acquainted with their Fashions, Manners, and Behaviors, and to Learn their
several Languages, all which is Profitable, and will make them Worthy men if
they Profit; Yet though I Commend your Love, I cannot Commend your Judgments,
for putting your Sons to be Instructed by Young Pedants, and to be Guided by
Young Governors, which are but Boys themselves in Comparison of Experienced,
Understanding, Knowing, Wise men, that is Aged men, who have Seen, Heard, and
Learned Much, and so Know Much, whereas Young men have not had Time to Hear,
See, and Learn Much, and so cannot Understand, nor Know Much, but must of
Necessity be Ignorant. Wherefore, it is not to be Wondered at, that Fathers
Reap not the Profit, or have not the Return of their Care and Expenses in their
Sons Educations; for Youth breeding up Youth, makes many Men to be Boys all
their Lifetime, and being not Instructed as they ought, become Wild, like
Plants that want Manuring, and Fathers mistaking the Cause through long Custom,
think it is the Incapacity of their Sons, and not the Insufficiency of their
Tutors and Governors, if they prove not according to their Hopes and
Expectations; But most Fathers being Bred as Ignorantly as their Sons, think
their Sons Completely bred, if they have been some time at the University, and
have made some short time of Travel, although without Profiting either in
Knowledge or Manners. Thus it may be Thought, that one Fool Begets an other;
but the truth is, that one Fool Breeds an other, for the Fault is not in
Nature, but in Education, at least not so Generally and Constantly, for Nature
does not Commit so many Errors, and make so many Defects, as Breeding does.

An Oration concerning the Plague.
Fellow Citizens,
I Shall not need to tell you, that the Plague is in this City, or that it
Increases Daily, I may say Hourly, or that this City has been formerly
Infested or Infected with this Disease, in so much as sometimes it has almost
made a Depopulation; but by Reason it is such a Deadly destroying, Disease, as
to sweep Thousands into Oblivious Death, and not only a Destroying but a
Murderous Disease, for it takes men Suddenly, Unawares, and Unprepared, being
in perfect Health and full Strength, and Wounds so deadly, as to be Past
Remedy, not to be Cured, either by Medicines or Salve, when it has Strongly
Seized on the Body; Wherefore, to hinder it from such a strong Affault and
Ruin, let me Advise you, Citizens, especially the Magistrates, who have Power
and Authority to Order and Govern this City, as they shall think Good and
Expedient for it; First, to set out a Declaration to all Householders, upon
Paying Fine, if Neglected and not Performed, to Cleanse their Houses, Pumps,
Springs, Sinks, Gutters, and Privy-Offices; also that Officers in every Parish,
and other Particular Person, may be Authorized for that Employment, to see the
Streets, Lanes, and Out-corners in and of the City Cleansed from Dunghils, and
Dung of Men and Beast, and from Carrion, Mud, and such like filth; also to have
the Common Sewers, Sinks, Channels, Wells, as also the Lakes, Ponds, and such
like Places without the City near adjoining, well Cleansed, and all this foul
Filth Buried deep in the Earth, that no Ill Savor or Vapor may Ascend
therefrom; for Foul, Gross, Stinking Vapors arising, especially from several
places, as several Houses, Streets, Ditches, Sewers, and the like, dispersing
Corruption about, Infect the Air, which Spreads far, and Enters into the very
Bowels and Inward Parts of men, nay, it does not only Poison the Bodies of men,
but all other Animal Creatures, as also the Fruits of the Earth; and so Strong
it is, that it Bursts forth in Sores, Ulcers, and Spots on the Bodies of Men
and Beasts, Inflaming their Spirits, and Consuming their Lives in a Moment;
Wherefore, to help to Purify the Air, let there be Pitch and Tar burnt in the
Open Streets, and Frankincense, Storax, and Benzoin in the Houses, or at least
Juniper; and after the City is thus Cleansed, and the Air Purified, you must
endeavor to Cleanse and Purify the Bodies of the Inhabitants, by Commanding
Every one to be Purged with Drugs or Simples, and to be let Blood, or else it
will be a Vain Work, as to Cleanse their Houses from Filth, and let their
Bodies be full of Foul Humors, to Cleanse their Sinks and Gutters, and let
their Veins be full of Corrupted or Inflamed Blood; Yet must the Bodies of men
not be Cleansed, until the City be Cleansed, lest the Infected Air from Without
should more easily Get Into them and Kill them. But I hope, I shall not need
much Rhetoric to persuade you, to take a Care of your Own Lives, for Life is
Sweet, and Death is Terrible; although I have Observed, that Men, though they
Desire to Live, nay, are Afraid to Dye, yet are so Careless, Obstinate, and
Confident, as not to Endeavor to Prolong their Lives, or to Defend their Lives
from Diseases, which are Death's Sergeants; for although all Creatures were
made to Consume into other Forms, and Men are Born to Dye, yet no Creature was
made to Dye and be Consumed, or Transmigrated before their Natural time, for
Nature has given her Creatures Defenses and Remedies against the Spoilers and
Destroyers of Life, which Spoilers and Destroyers, as also their Remedies and
Defenses are not easily to be Numbered; but Men are often their own Lives
Enemies, Killing themselves with Riot and Excess, or being Over-bold in
Adventuring or Entering into Dangers, or so Careless as to pass by Remedies: Yet
I hope you will be Careful, and Speedily Industrious to Prevent, if possibly
you can, the Increase and Fury of this Plague.

An Oration against Idle Expenses.
Fellow Citizens,
I Observe great Excess and Luxury in this City, Prodigally Spending your
Estates, and Wasting your Lives with Riot, which I cannot enough Wonder at,
that although men will Hazard their Lives to Get Wealth, and to Keep it from
those that would Take it from them, yet will Spend it Lavishly, as
Extravagantly, and Vainly, nay, more Readily to make them Sick, than to make
themselves Well when they are Sick, for they will Spend it Freely in Luxury,
and be Sparing to a Physician, which shows, men Love Pleasure more than Health,
whereas, Health is the Greatest Pleasure, for Sensual Pleasures are always
Followed with Sickness and Pain, which lasts Long, even so long, as many times
they do Accompany them to the Grave; and as Pains and Sickness follow Sensual
Pleasures, so Poverty and Scorn follows Vain Expenses, all which makes a
Discontented mind: Wherefore, what man, if he were Wise, would Destroy his
Body, Disquiet his Mind, and Ruin his Estate for that which is called
Pleasure? which is nothing but Sensual Appetites, that are no sooner Enjoyed,
but are Forgotten, or Loathed with the Fruition; and for Pleasures of the Mind,
those are only Opinions, which are nothing in Substance, and therefore not to
be Truly or Really Enjoyed. But as Temperance is the Greatest Bodily Pleasure,
because it gives Health, so Judgment is the Minds Physic, Purging out Vain
Opinions, Idle Thoughts, and Restless Desires, which give it the Health of
Peace and Tranquillity. Thus your Body and Mind will Live Healthfully, Happily,
and Honestly, Employing their Time and Labors in the Service of God, their
Country, and Friends, Living Wisely, Parting with the World Willingly, Leaving
a Good Fame behind them, and Ascend to a Crown of Glory and Eternal Life.

An Oration for Men to Please themselves.
Fellow Citizens,
GIve me leave to tell you, that Moral Orations are more Proper to be Spoken in
Schools, than in the Marketplace, where they will sooner Spoil Young Students,
than Reform Old Citizens; But those that Speak against Pleasure, Speak against
the Darling of Life, and therefore I do not VVonder at any for Taking his
Pleasures, but at those that Speak against it, since it is the Quintessence or
Elixir of Nature, as we may Know by the Scarcity of it, for Nature being Just
in all her Works, has Ordered them so, as what is Curious, Excellent, and
Good, She has Sparingly made, but what is Indifferent and Bad, She has made
Plentifully, Countervaluing the Worth of the One Sort, with the Quantity of the
Other, as we may Observe, She has made more Iron than Silver, more Silver than
Gold, more Stones than Diamonds, more Weeds than Flowers, more Beast than Men,
and of Men she has made more Fools than Wise men, more Cowards than Valiant
men, more Bad men than Good men, more Enemies than Friends, and so more Pains
than Pleasures; but because there is but a Little of that which is Good, shall
not we Enjoy it? Shall we refuse the Best, because we have not so Much as we
Would? that would be Unreasonable; but as Men will give a Great quantity of Led
for a Little Gold, so Men will Endure a Great deal of Pain for a Little
Pleasure, and they have Reason, for a Little Pleasure is of Great Value, being
the most Delitious Sweets in Nature; but you will ask What is the Delitious
Pleasure? I Answer, all that is Pleasure, is Delitious, yet every man is to
Judge of Pleasure by his own Delectation, for Pleasures are as Different as
Men; for although all men are of Mankind, yet every man is not alike, neither
in Mind nor Body, so although all Pleasure is Pleasure, yet not One and the
Same.

An Oration against Vice-Actors.
Noble Citizens,
OUr City does so Increase with Vice, as I fear, the Numerous Vices will be
like as the Plagues of Egypt to Destroy our City, if you do not use Speedy
remedy, to Punish the Vice-Actors; But we are so far from Punishing them, as we
Admire, Applaud, and Advance such, as have Most Vices, or Least Honesty; the
truth is, that Vice and Injustice is the only way or means to Advance men to
Office, Power, Authority, Respect, and Credit in our City, for those men that
are Temperate, Honest, and Just, are thought Fools and Unprofitable Drones, and
those that are Wisely Provident, and not Vainly Prodigal, are believed to be
Miserable men, which know not how to Live; and as for our Grand Magistrates,
they have more Formality than Reality, more Good Words than Good Deeds, more
Covetousness than Justice; they Regard not the Poor man's Cause, but the Rich
man's Money; for they decide Causes not according to Right, but according to
Bribes; Humility, and Honesty are Strangers to them, they Study their
Self-interest, but Regard not the Public Good, all which will bring a
Confusion, and so a Dissolution to this Commonwealth, if that you do not
Carefully and Suddenly Choose Wise and Conscionable men for Magistrates, to
Wit, such as will Punish Extorsions, Wrongs, and Injuries, Suppress Pride,
Vanity, and Luxury, Banish Quarrels, put away Idleness, and Administer Right
and Justice for Right and Justice's sake, as also Do as they would be Done unto.

An Oration against a Foolish Custom.
Worthy Citizens,
HEre is an Unjust and Unhandsome Custom in this City, and therefore ought to
be Abolished, which is, that whenever a Wife Beats her Husband, the next
Neighbor Rides through the City Disgracefully, not only Striding upon a Horse
with his Face toward the Tail, or Sitting astride upon a Staff, but having
Foul things flung at or on him, and all the Vulgar People follows with Shouts,
and all this to Shame an Innocent Person, who has not Committed a Fault,
whereas the Fault-makers are neither Troubled nor Disgraced, which is a great
Injustice, that those Escape, that Ought to have the Punishment; For the
Foolish Husband of such a Wife Rampant, should Ride in Disgrace, Scorn, and
Pain, by Reason he Suffers himself to be Degraded of his Masculine Authority;
yet is this not the only Foolish and Unjust Custom, but we have Many more,
which ought not to be Suffered in a Peaceable and Well-governed Commonwealth;
Wherefore the Public Magistrates, that are the Public Fathers, should Order
Private Families, that they may not Disorder the Public Tranquillity.

An Oration against the Liberty of Women.
Citizens of N. N.
ALthough I am sure to be Hated of all the Women in this City, and Perchance
elsewhere, yet by Reason I think it fit to Reprove their Liberties, Vanities,
and Expenses, I shall not be Silent, although I were sure to be Tortured with
their Railing Tongues, and to be Exclamed in all their Femal Societies', which
Societies ought to be Dissolved, allowing no Public Meetings to that Sex, no
not Childbed Gossipings, for Women Corrupt and Spoil each other, Striving to
Out-brave, Out-beauty, and Out-talk each other, with their Vanities, Paintings,
and Gossipings; wherefore it were fit, that Women should be Restrained not
only from the Company of Men, but their own Sex, unless it be those they have
near Relations to, and not to Suffer them to make Acquaintance with Strangers;
this would Cause Moderation, Sobriety, and Silence amongst them; also it would
Cause them to be Huswifely in their Families, Obedient to their Husbands, and
Careful of their Children, but Liberty is an Enemy to Women, nay it is an
Enemy to Men, not only to Fathers, Husbands, and Sons, but even to Wanton
Lovers, or rather Courtiers, making them as Vain and Expensive as Women, to
Gain their Mistresses Favors, Knowing Women, especially Amorous Women, are
soonest won with Gayes, Toys, and Shows; but Women are so far from being
Restrained in this Age, and in these Nations round about, that they have
Liberty to Spend what they will, to Keep what Company they will, and to Use
their Husbands and Natural Friends as they please; the truth is, Liberty makes
all Women Wild and Wanton, both Maids, Wives, and Widows, which Defames
Themselves and their Families. Thus in short, Women are the chief Ruiners of
Men in their Estates, Fortunes, and Honors, and so I leave them.

An Oration for the Liberty of Women.
Noble Citizens,
IT is not only Uncivil and Ignoble, but Unnatural, for Men to Speak against
Women and their Liberties, for Women were made by Nature for Men, to be
Loved, Accompanied, Assisted, and Protected; and if Men are Bound to Love them
by Nature, should they Restrain them by Force? should they make them Slaves,
which Nature made to be their Dearest Associates, their Beautiful'st Objects,
and Sweetest Delights? and shall Man Restrain them of their Harmless Pleasures,
Chaste Societies, and Gentle Conversations? And as it is Natural for Men to Love
Women, so it is Natural for Love to Please what they Love, and not to Cross,
Oppose, or Restrain them, but to Grant them all their Lawful Requests and
Desires, as far as lies in their Powers; for can Men Dispose of their Estates
more Generously than to Women? or think any Fortune Better, than when they can
Serve them? or is there a greater Happiness than to be Beloved of them? whereas
they are the Chiefest Good, that Nature has made for Men, and the greatest
Delight, She has given to Men; for can there be any Sound Sweeter than their
Voices? any Object Brighter than their Beauties, or any Society more Divine
than theirs? Yet these Celestial Creatures, a Terrestrial Man in the former
Oration did Plead against them, Persuading you, O Horrid Persuasions to use
them as your Slaves, which ought to be your Goddesses on Earth, for Nature made
them to be Beloved, Admired, Desired, Adored, and Worshipped, Sued and Praised
to by our Sex.

FEMAL ORATIONS.
PART XI.
I.
LAdies, Gentlewomen, and other Inferiors, but not Less Worthy, I have been
Industrious to Assemble you together, and wish I were so Fortunate, as to
persuade you to make a Frequentation, Association, and Combination amongst our
Sex, that we may Unite in Prudent Counsels, to make our Selves as Free, Happy,
and Famous as Men, whereas now we Live and Dye, as if we were Produced from
Beast rather than from Men; for Men are Happy, and we Women are Miserable, they
Possess all the Ease, Rest, Pleasure, Wealth, Power, and Fame, whereas Women
are Restless with Labor, Easeless with Pain, Melancholy for want of Pleasures,
Helpless for want of Power, and Dye in Oblivion for want of Fame; Nevertheless,
Men are so Unconscionable and Cruel against us, as they Endeavor to Bar us of
all Sorts or Kinds of Liberty, as not to Suffer us Freely to Associate amongst
our Own Sex, but would fain Bury us in their Houses or Beds, as in a Grave; the
truth is, we Live like Bats or Owls, Labor like Beasts, and Dye like Worms.

II.
LAdies, Gentlewomen, and other Inferior Women, The Lady that Spoke to you,
has spoken Wisely and Eloquently in Expressing our Unhappiness, but she has
not Declared a Remedy, or Showed us a way to come Out of our Miseries; but if
she could or would be our Guide, to lead us out of the Labyrinth Men have put
us into, we should not only Praise and Admire her, but Adore and Worship her as
our Goddess; but Alas, Men, that are not only our Tyrants, but our Devils, keep
us in the Hell of Subjection, from whence I cannot Perceive any Redemption or
Getting out; we may Complain, and Bewail our Condition, yet that will not Free
us; we may Murmur and Rail against Men, yet they Regard not what we say: In
short, our Words to Men are as Empty Sounds, our Sighs as Puffs of VVind, and
our Tears as Fruitless Showers, and our Power is so Inconsiderable, as Men
Laugh at our Weakness.

III.
LAdies, Gentlewomen, and other more Inferiors, The former Orations were
Exclamations against Men, Repining at Their Condition, and Mourning for our
Own; but we have no Reason to Speak against Men, who are our Admirers, and
Lovers; they are our Protectors, Defenders, and Maintainers; they Admire our
Beauties, and Love our Persons; they Protect us from Injuries, Defend us from
Dangers, are Industrious for our Subsistence, and Provide for our Children;
they Swim great Voyages by Sea, Travel long Journies by Land, to Get us
Rarities and Curiosities; they Dig to the Center of the Earth for Gold for us;
they Dive to the Bottom of the Sea for Jewels for us; they Build to the Skies
Houses for us; they Hunt, Foul, Fish, Plant, and Reap for Food for us; all
which we could not do our Selves, and yet we Complain of Men, as if they were
our Enemies, when as we could not possibly Live without them: which shows, we
are as Ungrateful, as Inconstant; But we have more Reason to Murmur against
Nature than against Men, who has made Men more Ingenious, VVitty, and Wife
than Women, more Strong, Industrious, and Laborious than Women, for Women are
Witless, and Strengthless, and Unprofitable Creatures, did they not Bear
Children. Wherefore, let us Love men, Praise men, and Pray for men, for without
Men we should be the most Miserable Creatures that Nature Has, or Could make.

IV.
NOble Ladies, Gentlewomen, and other Inferior Women, The former Oratoress
says, we are Witless, and Strengthless; if so, it is that we Neglect the One,
and make no Use of the Other, for Strength is Increased by Exercise, and Wit is
Lost for want of Conversation; but to show Men we are not so Weak and Foolish,
as the former Oratoress does Express us to be, let us Hawk, Hunt, Race, and do
the like Exercises as Men have, and let us Converse in Camps, Courts, and
Cities, in Schools, Colleges, and Courts of Judicature, in Taverns, Brothels,
and Gaming Houses, all which will make our Strength and Wit known, both to Men,
and to our own Selves, for we are as Ignorant of our Selves, as Men are of us.
And how should we Know our Selves, when as we never made a Trial of our Selves?
or how should Men know us, when as they never Put us to the Proof? Wherefore,
my Advice is, we should Imitate Men, so will our Bodies and Minds appear more
Masculine, and our Power will Increase by our Actions.

V.
NOble, Honorable, and Virtuous Women, The former Oration was to Persuade us
to Change the Custom of our Sex, which is a Strange and Unwise Persuasion,
since we cannot Change the Nature of our Sex, for we cannot make our selves
Men; and to have Femal Bodies, and yet to Act Masculine Parts, will be very
Preposterous and Unnatural; In truth, we shall make our Selves like as the
Defects of Nature, as to be Hermaphroditical, as neither to be Perfect Women
nor Perfect Men, but Corrupt and Imperfect Creatures; Wherefore, let me
Persuade you, since we cannot Alter the Nature of our Persons, not to Alter the
Course of our Lives, but to Rule our Lives and Behaviors, as to be Acceptable
and Pleasing to God and Men, which is to be Modest, Chaste, Temperate, Humble,
Patient, and Pious; also to be Huswifely, Cleanly, and of few Words, all which
will Gain us Praise from Men, and Blessing from Heaven, and Love in this World,
and Glory in the Next.

VI.
Worthy. Women, The former Oratoress's Oration endeavors to Persuade us, that
it would not only be a Reproach and Disgrace, but Unnatural for Women in their
Actions and Behavior to Imitate Men; we may as well say, it will be a
Reproach, Disgrace, and Unnatural to Imitate the Gods, which Imitation we are
Commanded both by the Gods and their Ministers, and shall we Neglect the
Imitation of Men, which is more Easy and Natural than the Imitation of the
Gods? for how can Terrestrial Creatures Imitate Celestial Deities? yet one
Terrestrial may Imitate an other, although in different sorts of Creatures;
Wherefore, since all Terrestrial Imitations ought to Ascend to the Better, and
not to Descend to the Worse, Women ought to Imitate Men, as being a Degree in
Nature more Perfect, than they Themselves, and all Masculine Women ought to be
as much Praised as Effeminate Men to be Dispraifed, for the one Advances to
Perfection, the other Sinks to Imperfection, that so by our Industry we may
come at last to Equal Men both in Perfection and Power.

VII.
NOble Ladies, Honorable Gentlewomen, and Worthy Femal Commoners, The former
Oratoress's Oration or Speech was to Persuade us Out of our Selves, as to be
That, which Nature never Intended us to be, to wit Masculine; but why should we
Desire to be Masculine, since our Own Sex and Condition is far the Better? for
if Men have more Courage, they have more Danger; and if Men have more Strength,
they have more Labor than Women have; if Men are more Eloquent in Speech,
Women are more Harmonious in Voice; if Men be more Active, Women are more
Graceful; if Men have more Liberty, Women have more Safety; for wenever Fight
Duels, nor Battles, nor do we go Long Travels or Dangerous Voyages; we Labor
not in Building, nor Digging in Mines, Quarries, or Pits, for Metal, Stone, or
Coals; neither do we Waste or Shorten our Lives with University or Scholastical
Studies, Questions, and Disputes; we Burn not our Faces with Smiths Forges, or
Chemist Furnaces, and Hundreds of other Actions, which Men are Employed in; for
they would not only Fade the Fresh Beauty, Spoil the Lovely Features, and Decay
the Youth of Women, causing them to appear Old, whilst they are Young, but
would Break their Small Limbs, and Destroy their Tender Lives. Wherefore, Women
have no Reason to Complain against Nature, or the God of Nature, for though the
Gifts are not the Same they have given to Men, yet those Gifts they have given
to Women, are much Better; for we Women are much more Favored by Nature than
Men, in Giving us such Beauties, Features, Shapes, Graceful Derncanour, and
such Infinuating and Enticing Attractives, as Men are Forced to Admire us, Love
us, and be Desirous of us, in so much as rather than not Have and Enjoy us,
they will Deliver to our Disposals, their Power, Persons, and Lives, Inslaving
Themselves to our Will and Pleasures; also we are their Saints, whom they Adore
and Worship, and what can we Desire more, than to be Men's Tyrants, Destinies,
and Goddesses?

ORATIONS IN Country Market Towns, where Country Gentlemen meet.
PART XII.
I.
Noble Gentlemen,
WHo are Innobled by Time, and not by Favor, give me Leave, since we are
Sociably met here in this Town, that I Remember you of our Happy Condition of
Life we Live in, as on our Own Lands, amongst our Own Tenants, like as Petty
Kings in our Little Monarchies, in Peace, with moderate Plenty and Pleasure,
our Recreations are both Healthful and Delightful, which are Hunting,
Hawking, and Racing, as being far Nobler Pastimes than Carding, Dicing, and
Tennis-Playing; for whereas Gamesters meet for Covetousness, we meet for Love,
they leave most of their Gettings to the Box, we bring most of our Gettings to
our Tables, and whereas we make our selves Merry with Our Games, they make
Quarrels with Theirs. Thus we Live more Friendly than Gamesters, and more
Happily than Great Monarchs, we neither Quarrel, nor fear Usurpers.

II.
Noble Gentlemen,
THe Gentleman that formerly Spoke, said, we were Petty Kings, making our
Tenants our Subjects; but if they be as Subjects, they are Rebellious Subjects,
not Paying us our Rents Duly nor Truly; besides, they are apt to Murmur at the
Least Increase of our Farms, although they Sell their Commodities they get out
of our Lands at a Double Rate; and as for our Pleasures, as Hawking, Hunting,
and Racing, they may be Sociable, but they are very Chargeable, for Hawks,
Hounds, and Horses, with their Attendance, will Devour a Great Estate in a
Short time, besides Open Housekeeping in Christmas time; All which makes
Gentlemen Beggars, and Beggars Gentlemen, for the Servants and Tenants grow
Rich, but their Masters and Landlords become Poor, the one sort Buyeth, the
other sort Sells, and the Title of a Gentleman is Buried in the Ruin of his
Estate.

III.
Noble Gentlemen,
THe Gentleman that Spoke last, spoke rather like a Cottager than a Gentleman,
or rather like a Miser than a Noble Hospitable Person, for he Spoke as if he
would have Gentlemen rather to Follow the Plough than the Race, the Cart rather
than the Deer, the Puttuck rather than the Hawk, to Eat Cheese instead of
Venison, Sour Curds instead of Patridge, Fried Pease for young Leverets, Rusty
Bacon for Chines of Beef, Rye Bread instead of White Manchet: all which is to
Live like a Clown, and not like a Gentleman, Burying his Birth in the Dung of
his Earth. But, Noble Gentlemen, I have Observed, that a Gentleman, although of
Small Fortune, if he Live Wisely, may Live Plentifully, and Honorably, without
his own Personal Drudgery; the Wisdom is, to Look into his Own Estate
Industriously, to Know and Understand the Value of his Lands Justly, to
Endeavor to have his Rents Paid Duly, and not Suffer his Servants to Coosen
him either by Flattery or Excess; all which will Cause a Country Gentleman to
Live as the first Gentleman said, like a Petty King, yet not like a Tyrant, but
like a Generous Prince, with Delight and Pleasure, Generosity and Magnificence
amongst his Tenants, Servants, and Acquaintance, also he will be an Assistance
to Travelers, and a Relief to the Poor, and his Fame and Name will not only
Sound Loud, but Long.

IV.
Noble Gentlemen,
THe Gentleman that Spoke last, spoke well for those Gentlemen that can Content
themselves in that Condition their Forefathers left them in, but Gentlemen of
great Estates desire great Titles, Offices, and Authorities, which cannot be
had in the Country, but from the Court, which Ambition persuades them to Leave
the Country, to Live near the Court, where they may be Seen and Known unto the
Grand Monarch, in which Courts are such Delights and Pleasures, as the Country
is not Capable to have, as Masks, Plays, Balls, Braveries, and Courtships,
which Ravish and Transport their Thoughts beyond the Country Region; indeed,
they are as if they were Transported into the Third Heaven, until such time as
their Money is Spent, their Land Sold, and their Creditors are Numberless, and
then they are Cast out as Evil Angels into the Hell of Poverty, and become Poor
Devilish Sharks Living upon their Wits, which is, to Live upon their Cheats,
which cannot last Long. Thus Gentlemen in the Country are Proud, in the Court
Vain, in the City Base, and at last Unfortunate, as being much Indebred and
Miserably Poor.

V.
Noble Gentlemen,
THe Gentleman that Spoke last, Declares our Ambitions at Court, but not our
Luxury in the Country, and though we have not Court Ladies and City Dames to
our Mistresses, yet we have Country Wives and Tenants Daughters for our
Wenches, and we Eat and Drink our Selves into Surfeiting Diseases, and our
Expenses are far more in Riotous Hospitalities, than the Courtiers in their
Foolish Flattering Vanities: for the Natures of Gentlemen and Noble men are for
the most part Prodigal, whether they be in Court, City, or Country, and they
will never Rest until such time as their Money is Spent, and their Land Sold,
and then they become Idle Drones for want of Stings, which is Wealth, to Employ
them.

VI.
Noble Gentlemen,
WE have Argued much of our Humors, Actions, and Estates of our Follies,
Vanities, and Vices, but we have not Concluded what is Best for us to Settle
in: as for the Course of our Lives, there are but three ways, as to be either
Mere Clowns, or Perfect Gentlemen, or Between both; To be Mere Clowns, is to be
Drudges in our Estates, To be Perfect Gentlemen, is to be Careless of our
Expenses, and to be Between both, is to be Careful Overseers, and Moderate
Spenders, and of these three I judge the Last best, as not to be so much a
Gentleman, as to be a Beggar, nor so much a Clown, as to be a Beast.

VII.
Noble Gentlemen,
WE agreed to meet in this Town for Pastime and Mirth, and not for Study and
Disputation; we came not hither to Learn Good Husbandry, but to Spend our Money
Freely; our Intention was not to meet with Formality and Gravity, but with
Freedom and Jollity; our Design was not to Return to our Dwelling houses with
Heavy Hearts, but Light Heads; Wherefore, Leave of Arguing, and Settle to
Drinking, and let our Tongues Cease, and the Music Play, and when we are Dead
Drunk, let the Fiddles Ring out our Knells, and let our Coaches as our Hearses
carry us to our Home-Beds, as to our Designed Graves, where after our Long
Sleeps we may Rise, and in our Resurrections be like either Saints or Devils;
In short, let Good Wine and Good Brains be our Good Fortune.

VIII.
A Speech of a Quarter drunk Gentleman.
Noble Gentlemen,
YOu have made Eloquent Orations before you did Drink, but let that Pass, for
now you must Speak only Witty Expressions, and give me Leave to Tell you, that
Logic and Wine are as great Enemies, as Poetry and Water; Wherefore, let the
Orators Drink Water, and Poets Wine, for Wine begets Fancy, and Water Drowns
Reason, which is the cause Orators Speak so Much and Long until they Speak
Nonsense: But O Divine Wine, whose Sprightly Vapor does Manure the Brain to a
just Highth of Wit, it is the Serene Air of Wit, the Quint-essence of Wit,
the Sun and Light of Wit, the Spirit and Soul of Wit; for were it not for
Wine, the Mind would be as in a dark Hell of Ignorance, and the Brain would be
Lethargically Stupefied for want of Lively Heat; for Wine is the Food of Vital
Life and Animal Reason.

IX.
A Speech of a Half drunken Gentleman.
Noble Gentlemen,
YOu have made Eloquent Speeches, but of what, I am a Rogue if I can Tell, but
that they were Full of Words: I did hear Many Words, but I do not Remember any
Sense or Reason in them; the truth is, that the Spirits of Wine have Burnt out
the Sense of your Discourse, and have Rarefied my Memory so much, as no
Substantial matter will Remain therein, so that your Oratory is Dead and Buried
in the Vapor of Wine, a Blessed Death, and a Happy Funeral, and may it Rest in
Peace and Silence, and not Rise to Disturb our Drinking, to which Wish and Hope
I begin a Health, and Desire you all to Pledge it.

ORATIONS IN The Field of Peace.
PART XIII.
A Peasants Oration to his Fellow Clowns.
Fellow Peasants,
FOr we are all Fellows in Labor, Profit, and Pleasure, though not Fellows in
Arms, Spoils, and Danger, and though we Live in the Fields of Peace, and not in
the Fields of War, yet our Fields of Peace resemble the Fields of War, for we
are an Army of Clowns, though not of Soldiers, and our Commanders are our
Landlords, who often Deceive us of the Increase of our Labors, as the Warring
Commanders Deceive their Common Soldiers of the Profit of their Spoils; also
we have our Infantery, and our Cavallry, for all those that belong to the
Keeping and Breeding of Beast, as Shepherds, Grasiers, Herdmen, Goat-herds,
Swine-herds, and Carters, are of the Cavallry, but all they that belong to the
Earth, as Sowers, Planters, Reapers, Threshers, Hedgers, Ditchers, Diggers,
Delvers, are our Infantery; also we have Arms and Ammunition, for we are Armed
with our Beast Skins, and our Arms of use are Pikes, Forks, Cutting Sickles,
Mowing Sithes, Pruning Knives, Thrashing Flails, Plough-sherds, Shepherds
Hooks, Herd-mens Staves, and the like, and our Match, Powder, and Bullets, are
Puddings, Pease, and Porradge, and our Grenades are Eggs of all Sorts and
Sizes, our Carts are our Wagons, our Cottages our Tents, and our Victuals and
Country Huswives our Bagg and Baggage, and the Lowing of our Herds, and
Bleating of our Sheep, are our Drums and Trumpets, not to Alarm us to Fight,
but to Feed; also we have Enemies, which are Unseasonable Seasons, Rotting
Moistures, Drowning Showers and Over-flows, Chilling Frost, Scorching Heat, and
Devouring Worms, all which we Fight against, not with Force, but with Industry.
And our Army of Clowns is more Skillful to Destroy our Enemies, than an Army of
Soldiers is to Destroy their Enemies, nay, our Army is an Army wherein is
Peace and Plenty, whereas in their Army is War and Want: we become Rich with
Safety, they become Poor with Danger, we be Gentle to Beast, they be Cruel to
Men, they Thrive by Blood, we by Milk, we get Health by our Labors, and Long
Life by our Temperance, and they get Diseases in their Riots, and Death in
their Wars: Thus they Live Painfully, Die Violently, and only Leave their Bare
Name to their Posterity and Beggarly Race, we Live Healthfully, Die Peaceably,
and Leave our Goods to our Posterity, who by their Wealth come to be Gentlemen.

A Peasants, or Clowns Oration Spoken in the Field of Peace, concerning
Husbandry.
Fellow Peasants,
I Must tell you, we Live in a Happy Age, where Peace Sows, and Plenty Reaps,
for whereas Wars Destroy our Increase, now Peace Increases our Stores; also I
would have you Know, that our Profession which is Husbandry, is one of the
Noblest and Generousest Professions, which is, to Employ our Selves like as the
Gods and Nature; for though we cannot Create Creatures, as Nature does, yet we
by our Industry Increase Nature's Creatures, not only Vegetables, that we
Produce in our Fields, and Store in our Barns, but Animals, which we Breed in
our Farms, and Feed in our Fields; But as Nature Commits Errors and Defects in
Producing her Creatures, so we for want of Knowledge have not the Good effect
of our Labors; for though we are Bred up to Husbandry, yet we are not all so
Knowing in Husbandry, as to Thrive and Grow Rich by our Labors; for as all
Scholars are not Learned, that have Lived and Spent most of their time in
Studies in Universities, but are mere Dunces; or as Artisans, are not all
Excellent Workmen, although they have been Bound to their Trade, and have
Wrought long in it, yet are but Bunglers: So for Husbandry, all Husbandmen are
not so Knowing in their Profession as to Thrive, but they Labor at Random,
without Judgment or Observation, and like those that Learn to Read by Rote,
may Understand the Words or Letters, but not the Sense and Meaning: So we may
be brought up to Labor, but not Understand to make a Profitable Increase, not
Knowing the Nature of the several Soils, as what for Pasture, or Meddow, or
Tillage; nor to Foresee the Change of VVeather, nor to Take the most
Seasonable Times, nor to Observe the Course of the Planets, all which is very
Requisite for the Breed of our Animals, and Increase of our Vegetables.
Wherefore, in my Opinion, it were very Necessary for us, to Choose the most
Observing and Experienced men amongst us, that Understand Husbandry best, to be
our Public and General Teachers, Instructers, Informers, and Reformers in our
Profession of Husbandry: For as there are Divine Teachers for the Souls of Men,
Moral Teachers for the Manners of Men, Human Teachers for the Bodies of Men,
and Physicians for the Lives of Men, so there should be Natural Teachers and
Informers for the Profitable Increase for Men, such as have not only Experience
by Practice, and Judgment by Observation, but have both Learning and
Conceptions of Natural Philosophy, as to Learn and Search into the Causes and
Effects of Natures Works, and to Know and Observe the Influences of the
Heavens on Earth, and on the Diverse and Sundry Creatures In and On the Earth;
also the Sympathies and Antipathies of the several Creatures to Each other, as
also the Natures and Proprieties of every Kind and Sort of Creature; so shall
we know how to Increase our Breed of Animals, and our Stores of Vegetables, and
to find out the Minerals for our Use; for as Learning without Practice is of No
Effect, so Practice without Knowledge is of Small Profit; yet many will Take
upon them to Instruct Others, that want Instructions Themselves, but such
Instructers Instructions are more in Words than for Use, as Plutarch's
Commonwealth, or Virgilius Georgics, two Famous Men, the One a Moral
Philosopher, the Other a Poet; the One did Form such a Commonwealth, as Men
would nor could not Live in it, and so not fit for Use; the Other could better
set his Wit to Work than his Hands, for if Virgil had left his Husbandary in
Verse, to Practice it in Prose, he had Lived Poorly, and Died Obscurely, as
having more Wit and Fancy to Write of Husbandry in his Georgics, than
Knowledge or Experience to Practice it in his Farms; Thus Poets get Fame, and
Farmers Wealth, the One by their Wit, the Other by their Experience, the One
by Imagination, the Other by Practice, for a Clown or Peasant Gains more
Knowledge by his Practice, than a Poet by his Contemplations; but when Practice
and Wit are joined together, they beget Wisdom and Wealth, the One being
Adorned with Gold, the Other Inthroned with Fame, for Emperors have Ascended
from the Plough, and Kings from the Sheep-coats, Converting their Plough-sherds
to Thrones, their Sickles to Crowns, and their Sheep-hooks to Scepters. Thus
Clowns, Boors, or Peasants by Name, are become Princes in Power, and Princes in
Power are become Beasts by Name and Nature, witness Nebuchadnezzar.

A Peasants Oration to his Fellow Peasants.
Fellow Peasants,
GIve me Leave to Tell you, we are the most Unhappy People in the World, for
we Live to Labor, and Labor to Live; and we are not only the Unhappiest, but
the Basest men in the World, for we are not only Bred with Beasts, and Live
with Beasts, and Dye like Beasts, but we are the Bawds and Pimps too, to bring
Beasts to Act Bestially together; also we are the Dungers of the Earth, to
Carry and Spread the several Excrements of several Creatures thereon, which
makes us not only to have a Continual Stink in our Nostrils, but to be a mere
Stink our Selves; Thus we are Beastly Within and Without, for all our Thoughts
are Employed on our Labors, which Labors are Brutish; neither have we such
Fine and Pleasant Recreations as other Men, for our Recreation is only to
Whistle, Pipe, and sometimes to Dance in a Crowd together, or rather Jump and
Leap together, being Ignorant of Dancing Measures; and the only Pleasure we
have, is, to Rumble and Tumble our Country Lasses, who being more Foul than
Fair, more Gross than Fine, more Noisome than Sweet, we soon Surfeit of them,
and then they become a Trouble instead of a Delight, a Disease instead of a
Pleasure, a Hate instead of a Love; and as they are to Us, so no Doubt but in
the End we are to Them, a Loathing Surfeit; for we Meet Wildly, Associate
Brutishly, and Depart Rudely; and as for our Profits, though we Labor, yet our
Landlords have the Increase. In short, we are Slaves to Beasts, and Beasts in
Comparison of other Men.

A Peasants Oration to prove the Happiness of a Rural Life.
Fellow Peasants,
THe Peasant that formerly Spoke, has rather Shown his Ungratefulness to
Nature, and his Unthankfulness to the Gods, by his Complaining Speech, than the
Truth of our Condition and Life, for he says we are the Unhappiest,
Miserablest, and Bafest men in the World; all which is false; for can there be
more Happiness than Pease and Plenty? can there be more Happiness than in the
Repose of the Mind and Contemplations of Thoughts? can we Associate our Selves
more Contentedly than with Innocent, Harmless, and Sinless Creatures? are not
Men more Stinking, Foul, and Wicked than Beasts? can there be more Odoriferous
Perfumes, than the Sweet Vegetables on the Earth? or Finer Prospects than
Stately Hills, Humble Valleys, Shady Groves, Clear Brooks, Green Hedges, Corn
Fields, Feeding Cattle, and Flying Birds? can there be more Harmonious Music
than Warbling Nightingales and Singing Birds? can there be more Delighfull
Sounds than Purling Brooks, Whispering Winds, Humming Bees, and SmallVoiced
Grasshoppers? can there be a more Delicious Sweet than Honey? more Wholesome
Food than warm Milk, Fresh Butter, Pressed Curds, New laid Eggs, Seasoned Bacon,
Savory Bread, Cooling Sallets, and Moist Fruits? or more Refreshing Drink than
Whay, Whig, and Butter-milk? or more Strengthening Drink than Ale, Mead, Perry
and Sider? and are not we at our Own Vintage? nay, should we Desire to Feed
Highly, we may, for we are Masters of the Beasts of the Field, and the Poultry
in the Grange, and know well how to Catch the Fouls of the Air? can we have
Warmer and Softer Garments than Cloth Spun from the Fleece of our Flocks, to
keep out Freezing Cold? or can we be Cooler than under Shady Trees, Whose
Waving Leaves are Fans to Cool the Sultry Air? or can we Lie Softer than on the
Downy Feathers of Cocks and Hens? and can we be Happier, than to be Free from
Stately Ceremony Court Envy, City Faction, Law Suits, Corrupt Bribes, Malice,
Treachery, and Quarrels? and as for our Recreation, although we do not Dance,
Sing, and Play on Music Artificially, yet we Pipe, Dance, and Sing Merrily;
and if we do not Make Love Courtly, yet we Make Love Honestly; and for our
Women, whom our Fellow Peasant does Disgracefully, Scornfully, and
Slanderously speak of, although they are but Plain Country Huswives, and not
Fine Ladies, yet they be as Honest Women as They, for they Spend their time in
Huswifry, and Waste not their time in Vanity; and as for their Beauty, their
Faces are their Own, as Nature Gave them, not Borrowed of Art; and if they be
not so Fair, yet they are as Lovely, and as they use no Sweet Perfumes, So they
use no Stinking Pomatum, and though their Hands be not Smooth, yet they are
Clean, they use no Oiled Gloves to Grease them, but Rub their Hands, when
Washed, with Coasse Cloth to Cleanse them; and as for their Garments, they are
Plain, yet Commodious, Easy, and Decent, they are not Ribb'd up with
Whale-bones, nor Encumbered with Heavy Silver and Gold Laces, nor Troubled with
New Fashions; they Spend not half their time in Painting and Dressing, and
though they Patch their Clothes sometimes out of Good Huswifry, yet they Patch
not their Faces out of Vanity, as Ladies do; neither do our Women Sweat to make
their Faces Fair, but Sweat for their Childrens Livelihood, and though they
Breed not their Children Curiously, yet they Breed them up Carefully: But our
Discontented and Ambitious Peasant, would Turn from a Clown to a Gallant, as to
Waste Lavishly, to Spend Prodigally, to Live Idly, to be Accoustred
Fantastically, to Behave himself Proudly, to Boast Vaingloriously, to Speak
Words Constraintly, to Make Love Amorously, to Flatter Falsely, to Quarrel
Madly, and to Fight Foolishly, but not to Thrive Prudently, to Employ Time
Profitably, to Spend Wisely, to Live Temperately, to Speak Truly, to Behave
himself Friendly, to Demean himself Civilly, to Make Love Chastely, to Live
Peaceably, Innocently, and Safely, as we, that are of the Pesantry, do.

ORATIONS IN A Difordered and Unsettled State or Government.
PART XIV.
An Oration against Taxes.
Fellow Citizens,
THis City is Taxed to Pay a Great Sum of Money, which Tax is more than we are
Able to Pay without being Impover sh'd, yet if it were All that would be Laid
upon us, there were Some Comfort, but that is not Likely, unless our Ministers
of State, and Magistrates, were Less Covetous to Get, and More Sparing to Save;
for though they Get much, they Spend much, or rather Spoil much in Luxury,
Vanity, and Bravery, which makes them always Needy, and though they Pretend,
that their Taxing is for the Service of the Commonwealth, yet most of it is
Employed in their Common Expenses, or Horded up to Buy Lands, and Build Stately
Palaces for their Posterity to Enjoy and Live in; thus they Build upon our
Stocks, and Buy Lands with our Labors, so that we Take Pains for Their
Pleasure; but if they Tax us Often, we shall be so Poor, as we shall not only
have Nothing to Pay, but Nothing to Live on, which Poverty will either Starve
us, or Force us to be their Slaves for Maintenance, for when they have
Engrossed All the Wealth, they will become Lords of the People, or rather
their Tyrants. Thus if we Part with our Wealth, we Part with our Liberty, but
to Keep Both, let us not Part with our Money, until we know How it shall be
Employed, for if it be Employed in the Service of the Commonwealth, it will
Return to our Profit, which will be as Traffic to Enrich, and not as Robbery
to Impoverish us, but if they Robb the Commonwealth, Employing our Moneys to
their Own Use, we are Doubly Robbed, like as Men should take our Fathers Goods,
which is our Inheritance, and also that we have Gotten by our Own Industry; and
if it be Requisite for us to Part with our Money, it is Requisite they should
Give us an Account of the Distribution; for as the Magistrate or Ministers of
State are the Commonwealth's Stewards, so the People ought to be their
Overseers, lest they Coosen the Commonwealth, by which the Commonwealth will
Thrive and become so Rich, as to keep the Natives from Beggary and Slavery.

An Oration contrary to the Former.
Fellow Citizens,
THe last Oration that was Spoken concerning Taxes, was a Factious Oration,
endeavoring to bring in Innovation, and the Orator that Spoke that Mutinous
Oration, Spoke not for the Public Good, but his Own Advancement, Hoping by
this Oration to be a Popular Man, Imbroiling the Commonwealth in a Civil War,
to Work out his Own Designs; thus Men for Private Respects would make a Public
Ruin, and the People through Ignorance do never Perceive them, but rather do
Applaud and Praise them for Good Commonwealth-Men, when they are oftentimes the
Occasion of a Commonwealths Destruction; but if you should follow his
Instructions, you would not only Lose All your Wealth, which is worse than to
Part with Some on Necessary Occasions, but you would Part with Lives or
Liberties, for he Advises you to Rebel against your Magistrates and Ministers
of State, by Calling or Forcing them to give a Public Account of the States
Private Affairs: But to show you how Foolishly he has Advised you, give me
Leave to Speak to your Sense and Reason, in Hope you are not Void of either,
for in Sense and Reason a Commonwealth cannot be Guided, Ruled, and Governed
without a Sovereign Power, which Sovereign Power is in the Magistrates and
Ministers of State, they are the Head to the Body of the Commonwealth, and to
have a Body without a Head is against Nature, and your Reason and Sense shows
you, that if you Take off, or Divide the Head from the Body, both will Dye,
Rot, and Consume: So if you take a Sovereign Power from the Commonwealth, it
Dies, Dissolves, and Consumes with Disorder, War, and Ruin, and if your Sense
and Reason perceive a Commonwealth must of Necessity have a Supreme Power,
your Sense and Reason will show you, that you must Trust that Supreme Power,
otherwise it would not be a Supreme or Sovereign Power, which Power is to
Command, Order, and Dispose of all, as it shall Think fit, or as it Pleases,
without Giving any Account, for Giving an Account makes it of no Force or
Effect; for a Commonwealth cannot be Governed without Subtility and Secrecy,
which is called Policy, which Policy, if Divulged, is no Policy, wherefore a
Public Account ought not to be given of that, which is not fit Publicly to be
made Known; And give me Leave to tell you, that Policy is Chargeable, not only
that it Costs much Study and Labor of the Brain, but it Requires much Money,
or Moneys worth, to Execute the Designs; for though it be the Chief Design of
Policy to be a Gainer in the End, yet is is but a Contriver in the Beginning, a
Worker in the Continuance or Execution, and a Possessor in the End, and whilst
it Works, it must have Something to Work with, for the Old Philosophers say,
out of Nothing, Nothing can be Made; neither is it Fit, they should Give an
Account of the Receipts or Expenses they Receive or Distribute of the
Commonwealth, for much Moneys must be Employed to have Intelligence from
Foreign Parts and Nations, for Fear of Surprisals, and Perchance great Sums of
Moneys are Required to Corrupt some Enemies to Betray the Rest, and so to
Prevent Danger, if not Ruin, besides many other ways, Abroad and at Home,
which Expenses are not fit to be made Known, or an Account given for; for Wise
Ministers of State make Use of all Passions, Appetites, Vices and Vanities of
Mankind, as well as of their Virtues, Courages, Generosities, Ingenuities,
Abilities, and the like; for that which would be Base, Foolish, Dishonorable,
and Wicked, for Private and Particular Families, Persons, or Acts, is
Honorable, Justifiable, and Wise in the Publick-weal. Wherefore, let me
Persuade you, to Pay the Taxes Willingly and Readily, for Money is the
Materials to Repair, Strengthen, Enlarge, Enrich, and Adorn a Commonwealth,
that you may Live Safely, Magnificently, Plentifully, and Pleasantly, which
otherwise you will not do, but Ruin your selves, at least make your Lives
Unhappy through Covetousness; which to avoid, part with Some of your Wealth or
Profit Contentedly, that you may Enjoy the rest Quietly, Peaceably, and Freely,
and follow not the Advice of the former Orator, whose Speech, although it was
Plausible to you, yet you might easily perceive his Design was Dangerous, not
only to the Magistrates which are your Fathers, but to the whole State or
Kingdom, Endeavoring with his Speech to Imbroil the whole State in a Civil
War, persuading you to be the first Risers, Stirrers, and Disturbers. Thus
through Private, Particular, and Self-respects, Men often times make General
Wars, but I hope you will Live in Peace, and so I Will Leave you.

An Oration against Collectors.
Fellow Citizens,
THere ought some Order to be Taken, to Rectify the Abuses and Coosenages of
the Collectors and Receivers of Assessments, Contributions, and the like; for
they Collect and Receive much more than is Paid into the Common Treasury, so
that they Rob both the People and the Common Treasure, Impoverishing the
Commonwealth, and Dis-inabling the Rulers in the Discharges of Necessary
Expenses, which Thefts they Secretly Hord up, so that in the End, if they be
Suffered, there will be such a Scarcity of Money, as there will be None to Pay,
nor None to Receive, and like as those that Hord up Corn, make a Dearth, so
those that Hord up Money, make a Mutiny, so that Money-Horders Cause Civil
Wars, as Corn-Horders Cause Famine; for when there is but Little Money
Stirring in the Kingdom, they, that have Any, are so Loath to Part with it, as
they will rather Part with their Lives, and those that have None, are so Greedy
to have Some, as they will Venture their Lives to Get it; and if the Common
Treasure be Empty, and the People be Poor, we cannot Live in Security, if we
have no Means to Provide for our Safety, the Kingdom will Lie open to the
Enemy, for Money or Moneys worth is a Ward that Locks up a Kingdom in Safety,
and is a Key to Unlock the Gates of our Enemies, and Sets them Open for our
Entrance, and Money or Moneys worth is so Subtle and Insinuating, as it Enters
into the most Privy Counsels of our Enemies, brings us Intelligence of all
their Designs, or makes them Advise Treacherously, and give Counsel even
against Themselves, such Power has Riches! it Buys out Honesty, Corrupts
Justice, Betrays Lives, nay, even Souls, for men will Venture Damnation for
the Sake of Money; Wherefore it is Necessary, that the Common Treasure should
be well Stored, Good Common-wealth-men should be not only Industrious to Enrich
the Common Treasure, but Sparing in Spending the Common Treasure, and Severely
Punish those that Endeavor to Coosen and Rob the Common Treasure, and none
should be Suffered to Hord up Riches but in the Common Treasure, which is to be
Spent Generally for the Good of all the whole Kingdom, in time of Necessity,
as in the times of Plagues, Famines, and Wars, as also for the Strength and
Power of the Kingdom, for the Reward of Merit, Advancing of Trade, and such
like ways of Expenses, not in Gay Shows, and Idle Pastimes, nor in Vain or
Unprofitable Buildings, or the like. But if we Suffer the People to be
Impoverished by these Cheating, Coosening Purloiners, we shall never fill the
Common Coffers, for to Coofen and Rob the People, is to Coofen and Rob the
Common Treasure, which is the General Store of the whole People, Filled and
Enriched By Them, to be Profitably Laid out For Them.

An Oration for Taxes.
Fellow Citizens,
I Perceive a Discontent amongst you, by your Murmuring at the Tax that is Laid
upon you, which Murmuring is Dangerous, for many men's Murmurs may in a short
time Amount to the Sum of Rebellion, which will make a Civil War, in which
War you will Lose more than you are now Required to Pay: But give me Leave to
tell you, that you are both Unreasonable and Unjust, for you will Live in the
Common wealth, and yet not Help to Maintain or Uphold it; also you are
Ungrateful, as not to Return a Small Gratuity to the Commonwealth, for the
Many and Great Benefits you have Received therefrom; Indeed, in Denying this
Tax, you seem as Unnatural to your Country, as Children who should Suffer their
Parents to Starve whilst they Surfeit, which Causes Both their Untimely Deaths
through Want and Excess; So rather than you would Abate your Idle Expenses and
Vain Pleasures, to Pay Necessary Taxes, you would Suffer the Kingdom to be
Defenseless, and Open for an Enemy, to Invade and Destroy It, and your Selves.
But if Words cannot Persuade you, surely your Rational Understanding, Wife
Prudence, Careful Providence, Honest Minds, and Natural Affections will not
only make you Willing and Ready to Pay this Tax, but any other Tax at any time
you are Taxed, which is for the Common Benefit, Good, and Safety of your
Country, wherein you Desire to Live Safely, and to Dye Peaceably, and to Lie in
the Graves with your Forefathers.

An Oration to Hinder a Rebellion.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
I Perceive by your Humors, Dispositions, Factions, and Speeches, that you
intend to Rebel against your King and Noble Governors, Endeavoring to Alter
the Ancient Government of this Flourishing Kingdom, that has Continued in and
under the Reign and Rule of Kings these many Hundred years, which time has
Confirmed so strongly in the Monarchical Power, as you Cannot easily make a
Change; yet if you Could, the Action would be very Unjust, Unnatural, Wicked,
and Damnable; Unjust, to Force away the Rights of your King; Unnatural, as not
to Live under the Same Government your Forefathers did; Wicked, to Spill the
Blood of your Nobles; and Damnable, to Spill the Blood of your Sovereign. Thus
it will be Evil and Dangerous, for you cannot Think they will Part Peaceably
from that Power their Ancestors Left them, they will not become your Slaves, if
they can Help it, nay, they will sooner Part with their Lives than their
Honors, and you are not sure of Victory, for all Honest men will be of Their
Party; yet put the Case, you should have Victory, you will sooner make a
Confusion than Settle the Kingdom into a Republic, for the Nature and
Constitution is not for it, as having been Bred up a Long time to Monarchy, so
that you may sooner Change the Nature of Man into a Beast, than the Government
of this Kingdom into a Republic; and could you make it a Republic, you would
not be so Happy as you are Now, for now you are Governed Easily, without
Troubling your Selves, but then you would be Troubled, not Knowing how to
Govern your Selves, as also the Commonwealth, for you must be Forced to set up
Some to Govern you; and is it not Better to be Governed by your Superiors,
than your Equals? which Equals would Rule you by Corrupting Flattery, or
Terrify you with Reports of Dangers, and so Rule you by Fear. Thus by
Insinuations or Terrors, you would be more Inslaved than you are now, and
Poorer than you are now; for though you Commons have not Power to Rule as a
King, yet you have Wealth to Spend on what you Please, witness your Luxuries
and Vanities, which if you were Poor, you could not Exceed in Plenty as you Do,
insomuch as you can hardly Afford God some Fasting Days. Besides, those
Sycophants and Cheats, which persuade you to this Change, would not only Spend
your Wealth, but Waste your Lives, for they would Persuade you to make Wars
Abroad, to Keep you in Subjection, for in Wars they Command You, and in Time
of Peace they are Afraid you will Command Them, and rather than you should Live
in Peace, they would Corrupt your Neighbors with Bribes, or Provoke them with
Injuries, to make War with you. Thus you would be Inslaved by being Outwitted
by Those, that have more Brain than your Selves. O Foolish People, that will
quit your Present Happiness for a Voluntary Slavery! and as for a Monarchical
Government, which you seem to be Weary of, it is the most Ancient and Divinest,
as being an Imitation of God and his Angels in Heaven, wherein are Degrees, as
Higher and Lower, from, and to his Throne; But as God had Evil Angels, so our
King has Evil Subjects, which ought to be Cast out of the Kingdom like
Devils, as they are.

An Oration against Civil War.
Noble Auditors,
I Perceive this Kingdom has two Faces like a Janus, and Both Look with a
Lowering and Frowning Countenance, which does Fore-shew a Storm, and by your
Accusations and Factions your Hearts seem full of Malice, and your Heads full
of Design, as if you did Intend each others Ruin, and so the Kingdom's
Destruction by a Civil War, not Considering that a Civil War is far worse
than a Foreign War, for against a Foreign Enemy the whole Strength of a
Kingdom is United to Defend it Self, but in a Civil War the Strength is
Divided to Destroy the whole Kingdom, and so much Difference there is Between
each War, that a Foreign War is but like an Outward Sore on the Body, but a
Civil War is as an Inward Disease even in the Vital Parts, which Causes a
Consumption; Indeed, I may Similizing say, that in a Civil War the Kingdom
does, as if it did Spit up its Lungs, for Civil Wars oftentimes cause Famine
and Plagues, which is to a Kingdom as a Hectic Leanness, Heat and Corruption
in a Man's Body, which causes Death and Destruction. But, Dear Countrymen,
what can you Propound to your Selves in a Civil War? can any Man be Happy when
Injustice Reigns, and Force Rules? or can any Man hope to Enrich himself when
Fury and Malice makes a Spoil of all? or can any Man think to Advance himself,
when as every Particular Desires and Endeavors to be Superior? for though
Authority may be Pulled down, yet where no Single Authority is Suffered by the
Power of Many, no Particular person can be Advanced, they must All continue
Equal, or be all Destroyed to One Man, and That Man will only be Superior in
his Single Person and Life, but not have Authority or Power over Other Men; for
if there be None to be Governed, it cannot be said, he Governs, and when there
is None to Obey, there is None to Command; but should Several Parties Choose
Chiefs, yet if one Party should get the Better of the other Parties, it is
probable the Chief of that Party could not Rule Long, for there would be
always Divisions between the Head and the Body of that Party, and every
Several Party of that Body would be the Head; So that in Effect there would
neither be Head nor Body, but in the End the whole would be Destroyed: and as
for Spoils, if any be Gotten in Civil Wars, the Possessors have not Assurance
to Enjoy them, for Spoils in Civil Wars are Tossed from Man to Man, where
Every one Striving to Have them, not any One can Keep them: and as for Lands,
though they cannot be Removed, yet Several Claimers will move to them, and
Every one Strive to Posses them. Thus Civil Wars do Level Power and Wealth,
and in the end Destroy them; and since Men can neither have Rest, Safety,
Plenty, Honor, or Authority in Civil Wars, it were a Madness to make such
Wars, wherein they are sure to be Losers, at least no Gainers; nay, were
there any thing Left to be Enjoyed, those that never Ventured in the Wars,
would go away with the Spoils; for the Ruins of a Civil War are left to
Succeeding Ages, the Quarrellers and Fighters being for the most part Destroyed
in the War. In truth, there is Nothing so Miserable, Hateful, Cruel, and
Irreligious as Civil War, for it is an Enemy against Law, Nature, and God, it
Pulls down the Seats of Justice, Throws down the Altars of Religion, Diggs up
the Urns of their Parents, Disperses the Dust and Bones of their Dead
Ancestors, Spills the Blood of their Fathers, Sons, Brethren, Friends, and
Countrymen, and makes a Total Destruction and Dissolution, or at least their
Country so Weak, as it becomes a Prey to Foreign Enemies, and the Remainders of
the Natives become Slaves; so that Civil War begins with Liberty, but ends in
Slavery. Wherefore, those Turbulent Spirits, that will not Live in Peace, but
Endeavor to make Civil Varr, ought to be Hanged to Prevent it, so shall the
Peaceable and Innocent Live in Safety, which otherwise will be Devoured and
Destroyed by the Merciless men in Arms.

An Oration against a Tumultuous Sedition.
Fellow Citizens,
I Observe a Turbulent Spirit, or rather a Spirit of Fury has Possessed most
of this City, to Rise Tumultuously and Mutinously, as some against Others, and
they against Them; but what can you Propose to your Selves in this Civil Broil,
or rather Civil War, but Ruin, Death, and Destruction? and by what Authority
do you Thus? for Common, Canon, and Civil Laws forbid you, the like does
Humanity, Morality, Divinity, and Charity; also Nature forbids you, for what is
more Unnatural than for Fellow Citizens and Countrymen to Spill each others
Blood? and if Injuries have been Done, and Faults Committed, this is not the
way to Rectify them, but to the Contrary, to Heap Faults upon Faults, and
Injuries upon Injuries; and if it be for Justice, certainly you ought not to
Claim Justice in an Unjust way; and if for Right of Privileges, let me Tell
you, you have no Privilege to make Civil War or Disorders in this City, and so
Consequently through the Kingdom, by your Ill Examples; and if it be Several
Factions of Several Parties, that cause this Disorder, Know, you may sooner
Destroy each others Parties, than either Party be Victor; and if it be through
the Poverty of Some, and Envy of Others, in Hope to Plunder the Rich, and Pull
down the Powerful, though your Designs should have Success for the Present,
you may Chance to Suffer for this Disorder in the End, so as neither to Enjoy
your Plundered Goods, nor to Save your own Lives, for Plundering is Robbing,
and Killing in a Mutiny is Murder, so that, unless you can get Above the Laws,
the Laws will Accuse you; Wherefore, if you be Wise, you will Moderate your
Covetousness, Qualify your Spleens, Cast your Arms away, and Crave pardon for
your Faults, whilst you may Have it; but if you Consider not your Own Lives or
Tranquillities, yet have Pity and Compassion of your Old Parents, Young
Children, Chaste Wives, Dear Friends, Brethren, and Country, wherein Infallibly
many must Suffer in this great Disorder and Outrage; but if nothing can
Persuade you, Heaven Protect the Innocent, and Lay a Heavy Punishment upon the
Guilty, to which I Leave you, whether I Live, or Dye.

An Oration to Mutinous, yet Fearful Citizens.
Fellow Citizens,
GIve me Leave to Tell you, that I did not Wonder more at your Sudden Courages
in your Sudden Rebellion, than I do now at your Sudden Fear and Sudden
Obedience to those you Rebelled against, Obeying whatsoever they Command,
Delivering up your Purses and Arms in Hope to get Pardon for your Lives; for
your Fear was Such, as you no sooner saw an Army come Toward your City as an
Enemy, but you presently Drew up your Bridges, Shut fast your Gates, Chained up
your Streets, and Run to your Prayers for Heavens Help; I Confess, you had
great Reason to Fear, when as a Sharking Needy Army was at your Gates, which
would have Fought more Valiantly to Get into the City to Plunder, than you to
Keep them out from Plundering; besides, there is a Castle or Fort, that is
Built so Near your City, and Stands so Advantageous, as the Canons placed
thereon can easily Beat down your City over your Heads; but these Things at the
first you did or would not Consider, Resolving madly to Rebel, having at that
Time neither Fear nor Wit, for before such time as you Saw the Army, believing
it was Far off from you, a Stranger had he Seen and Heard your Boasts, Braggs,
and Bravadoes, your Arming, Drumming, and Trumpetting, might have Believed, at
least Thoughts, you had both Valor and Power Equal with the Old Romans, that
Conquered all the World, but you Appeared more Terrible than your Were, for
your Deeds were not Answerable to your Words and Behavior, and your
Countenances did Change with your Fear; the truth is, your Courage was a
Rebellious Courage, and your Fear seems as a Loyal Fear, for before your
Enemies did Appear, you did Boast like Soldiers, but now you ask Pardon, you
Flatter like Courtiers, yet for all your Flattery you must Pay for your
Disorders, and Buy your Peace with a Huge Sum of Money: and if I should Ask
you why you did put your Selves into a Warring Posture without Leave or Command
from your King or Ministers of State, you will Answer me, for the Defense of
some of your Privileges, so that for the Sake of Some you Endangered All, for
the Readiest way and Surest means to Lose your Privileges was to Rebel against
your Sovereign, all which shows your Ignorance, Folly, and great Simplicity;
Wherefore, by this Rebellious stir, you have not only Lost your Privileges,
but you are Forced to Pay more than your Privileges are Worth, might you Enjoy
them, so that you must Lose the One, and Pay the Other; and all this Loss and
Charge is Caused through your Factious Humors, and Restless Natures, being
Unprofitably Busy. Indeed, you are like Troubled Waters, Muddy and Foul, yet
it is Likely, at least Hoped, that the Fine that is set upon you, will draw you
Clean, making you Clear and Smooth, which is, to be Loyal and Peaceable, only
the Chief misery is, that in the Loss of your Privileges, and Payments of
Money, Good Men (for All were not Traitors, though Most were) must Suffer with
the Bad, the Fine being Generally laid upon the Whole City, wherein every
Particular must Pay his Share, and the Loss of the Privileges falls upon All,
by which we may Observe, that Peaceable Men Suffer with Troublers, and Honest
Men with Traitors, and it cannot easily be Avoided, not only that the Few that
are Good, are Obscured, and Hid amongst the Many that are Bad, and so cannot be
easily Culled out, but in Cases of Taxes and Privileges, it would make a
Confusion in Levies and Partments; Thus neither Good nor Wise Men can suddenly
avoid those Misfortunes that Fools and Knaves many times bring upon them; but
Wise Men did see at your first Rising, Arming and Souldiering, that you would
sooner Yield to your Opposers, than Fight them, and rather Pay for your
Follies, than Dispute for your Privileges; for you were all Body, and no Head,
and so consequently no Brains; But that I Wonder at most, is, that so Great a
Body as you were, should not only be Headless, but also Heartless, as having
neither Wit nor Courage. Wherefore, to Conclude, let me Persuade you, having
never a Head of your Own, to send to your Gracious Sovereign to send you a
Head, and he will not only send you a Head, but a Wise Head, to Rule and Govern
you, and as for a Heart, Fortune in time may Give you One.

An Oration concerning Trade and Shipping.
Dear Countrymen,
For some Small Errors in the former Government, and for some Few Oppressions
by our former Governors, we were Discontented, and through a Discontent began
to Murmur, then to Complain, and at last to Rebel, in which Rebellion we
Entered into a Civil War, wherein Fortune was our Friend, for Fortune for the
most part is a Friend to Fools and Knaves; and though we were Honest Men,
Fighting only for our Liberties, yet our Enemies say, we Fought for their Lands
and Riches, having none of our Own; but let them say what they Will, since we
have what we Desire; the Misery is only, that now we have both their Wealth and
Power, we Know not how to Use it, a Shrewd Sign, that we are more Covetous
than Provident, more Ambitious than Wise, for every Man Striving to make a
Particular Profit to Himself, we shall at Last bring the whole State or
Commonwealth to a Confusion; the truth is, that Striving to make Particular
Profits, you make a General Spoil, for you Cut down Woods, Pull down Houses,
set Open Enclosures, Live Idly upon the Fundamental Riches of the
Commonwealth, not Laboring to Manure the Land; But if you take not Care of
Two Things, your Ruin will be Sooner than you Imagine; these Two Necessary
Considerations and Actions, are Trade and Shipping; As for Trade, you give your
Neighbors leave to take Part of it away from you, and that you Trade your
Selves in, is so Ill Managed, as it brings but Small Profit or Advantage to
this Kingdom; for you Trade rather like as Pedlars, than Great Merchants;
besides, you Send out of the Kingdom the most Profitable Commodities, as those
that are called Staple Commodities, and Bring in the most Unprofitable
Commodities, such as are only for Vanities, and not such as are for Necessary
Use; Also, you Raise your Customs to so High a Rate, as the Custom is Beyond
the Profit of Trade; but could Merchants Gain, yet, if the Gain of their
far-fetched Commodities be Uncertain, and the Customs for those brought home
Commodities Certain, few would Venture or be Merchants, so that Trade upon
Necessity must Fall, and then the Kingdom cannot be Rich; And as the Kingdom
cannot be Rich without Foreign Trade, so it cannot be Safe without Home
Shipping, which is the other Necessary Consideration and Action; but you do not
Consider enough of it, as being Blinded with Covetousness, Regarding your
Particular Profits more than the General Safety, Cutting down and making a
Spoil of all such VVoods, as should Repair and Increase Shipping, which Wood is
Oak, whereof this Island had the Best in the World; Indeed, there is no such
Oak in any Part of the World, but in this Kingdom, which is the Reason, there
are no such Ships in the World as do belong to this Island, for one of our
Ships is Able to Vanquish two or more Ships of other Nations, by Reason our Oak
is not apt to Cleft or Splinter, being Smooth, Sound, and Strong, besides,
Close, not Porous or Spongy; but we for the Covetousness or Present Gain, Cut
down this Excellent full-Grown Timber to be Burnt into Coals for Iron Forges,
whereas our Ancestors were so Careful, as they would not Cut more than was for
Necessity, although there was great Store of it; for, by Reason this Sort of
Wood requires above a Hundred years Growth, to be Tall, Firm, Strong, Close,
and Free from Splintering, they would not Cut it before the Age made it fit for
Use, nay, our Ancestors did oftener Plant Young, than Cut down the Old, and all
for the Sake and Safety of their Posterity; But we do not Consider Posterity,
for if we did, we should not Do as we Do; Wherefore, what with a Standing Army,
no Trade, and daily Spoils, the Kingdom will be Impoverished, and of Necessity
fall to Ruin.

An Oration for the Disbanding of Soldiers.
Senators, and Citizens,
IF I might, I would Counsel you to Disband most of the Soldiers, since we
Perceive no Visible Enemy; for we have more Reason to Fear our own Soldiers
than any other Power, by Reason they are become so Proud, and Insolent with
their Victories, that We, that were their Masters, if not Speedily Prevented,
may Chance to become their Slaves, at least their Servants, as their Stewards
and Purveyors, to Get them Money and Provision; But were they as Obedient as
Insolent, yet it were fit, that most of them should be Disbanded, otherwise
they will Impoverish the Commonwealth; for there is no greater Expense and
Charge, than to Maintain an Idle Army, that Feeds upon others Labors, and is
Clothed upon others Cost; besides, they are not only Unprofitable through
their Idleness, and Chargeable to be Maintained, but they are great Destroyers
with the Spoils they daily make; for their Idleness makes them Mischievous, so
as they are Insolent and Proud, as we, their Masters dare not Speak roughly to
them; but when they are Disarmed, they will be Humble, and the Common Soldiers
will follow their former Trades, and several Occupations: Thus the Charge and
Expense of Maintainting the Army will not only be Taken off, but Trading will
then Increase, by which the Commonwealth will be Unburden'd and Enriched, and
we our Selves out of Danger and Fear of being Dispossessed of our Power.

A Soldiers Oration for the Continuance of their Army.
Fellow Soldiers,
THose, that would be our Masters, if you will give them Leave, will Disband
us, Turning us out of our Power by their Authority, but if we Submit and Yield
thereto, we shall not only Lose our Pay, at least Part of it, but we shall be
Subject to their Tyranny, Ruled by their Laws, and Commanded by their Power; in
Short, we shall be their Slaves, which are now their Masters, our Arms being
Stronger than their Laws; Wherefore, let us Keep our Strength, and Pull down
their Authority, for it were a shame for Swordmen to Yield to Gown-men, which
only Love to Talk, but Dare not Fight; and shall their Tongues wrest out the
Swords out of our Hands? shall their Gowns pull off our Arms? shall they give
Law to us that are Victorious? or shall we Suffer them to make Ill Laws, that
broke Good Laws? or shall we be Governed by them, that cannot Govern
themselves? shall they, that have sit in Safety, when we Ventured our Lives,
Reap the Profit of our Victories? shall we, that have Conquered with our
Swords, be Conquered by their Words? shall we, that have Fought for our
Liberty, be Subject at last to their Commands? No, Fellow Soldiers, let us
Subject them to our Commands, as being their Betters, and let not Us, that have
made our Selves Gentlemen by Arms, Noblemen by Victories, and Kings by
Absolute Conquest, and so Absolute Power, be Subject to the Common Cowardly
Rout, to Parish-Officers with their Tip-Staves, to Unjust Judges, Corrupt
Magistrates, Babbling Lawyers, Foolish Counselors, City Sergeants,
Tub-Preachers, and the like; No, we will Preach, Teach, Decide, Rule, and give
the Law our Selves, and we having Absolute Power can Command our Pay, for Every
Man's Purse is Ours; but it is Best, if it can be, to have our Pay gathered a
Legal way; Wherefore, let me Advise, that these Men, that are our Seeming
Masters, be made our Real Servants and Officers to Raise us Money and to
Collect it from every Particular throughout the whole Nation, whereby they will
only get the Hatred of the People, and we their Money.

An other Oration against the Former.
Senators, and Citizens,
WE that were the first Studiers and Stirrers to Alter the Government of the
Commonwealth, we that have Prayed, Preached, and Pleaded down Tyrannical
Power, which was in Monarchical hands, we that have Pulled down the Nobles, and
have Advanced the Lowly, Enriched the Poor, and Impoverished the Rich, shall we
now be Subjected and Ruled by those we Employed in our Service, as to Lead our
Armies to Fight our Battles, and to Keep our Cities, Towns, and Forts? shall
these I say, Command us, when we at first Commanded them? for you well Know,
this Army, that is now in this Kingdom, was Raised, Armed, and Paid by our
Order and Industry, for it was we, that Combined, Joined, Plotted, and
Contrived this War, and by our Subtility, Policy, and VVisdome, we made
Factions and Divisions, Drawing thereby Numbers to our Party, and by our
Ingenuity we Drained their Purses as well as Drew their Persons to Maintain
this War, and yet now this our Army Disputes with us, and are Disobedient to
our Command, nay, they Threaten to Overthrow our Counsels, and to Put us out of
our Authorities, forcing the Supreme Power from us, which ought not to be
Suffered, but Seriously Considered, how we may Disband them, for it is
Dangerous to let One and the same Men continue long in Arms, especially
Commanders, but rather to Change their Commanders often, lest they may Gain so
much the Love and Obedience of their Soldiers, as to make them Absolute; Yet I
Leave all to your Better Judgments.

A Soldiers Oration concerning the Form of Government.
Fellow Soldiers,
NOw we are Absolute Masters of this Kingdom, having cast out the Gown men out
of their Power and Authority, the question will be What Kind of Government we
shall Settle this Kingdom in, as in a Celestial, Aereal, or Terrestrial; The
Celestial is Monarchy, the Aereal is Aristocraty, the Terrestrial is Democraty;
The First is to be Governed by One, the Second by Few, the Third by Many; The
First is to be Governed by a King, the Second by Nobles, the Third by Commons;
But one of these Governments we must Settle in, otherwise all the Kingdom will
be in a Confusion; for if there be no Order and Method, there will be no Rule
nor Government, since Every one will do what he List, and then None will take
Care of any thing, so that there will be neither Tillage nor Trade, and if
there be no Tillage nor Trade, there will be neither Food nor Money, for where
there is no Government, there can be no Assurance, and who will take Pains for
that they are not Sure to Keep, or rather I may say, they are Sure to Lose?
Wherefore, some Government we must Choose, and all Kinds of Governments are
Divided into these three I have mentioned; as for Democraty, I like that the
Worst, for the Common people is not only Insolent, when they have Power,
Commanding Imperiously, Condeming Unjustly, Advancing Unworthily, but they are
so Inconstant, as there is no Assurance in them, and so Foolish, as they Know
not what to Choose, only like little Children, they will be Persuaded with a
Flattering Tongue, sometimes to Reason, but oftener against Reason, and
sometimes against all Reason and Sense; the truth is, though they seem to
Govern, yet they are Ruled by some Particulars, as first by One, and then an
Other, as those that can Flatter Best, or rather Most, by which they become
Slaves to an Insinuating Tongue; Wherefore, it is no fit Government for Us, for
we are Soldiers and not Pleaders, we are Fighters and not Flatterers; the
truth is, that a Pure Democraty is all Body and no Head, and an Absolute
Monarchy is all Head and no Body, whereas Aristocraty is both Head and Body, it
is a Select and Proportionable Number for a Good Government, which Number being
United, Represents and Acts as One Man, for like as Many Men's Voices Agreeing
and Consenting make it as One Man's Decree, so a Proportionable Number makes it
as One Man's Ruling or Governing: Wherefore, this is the Best Kind of Government
for Us, for so all the Chief Commanders in our Army, being United together, may
be this whole Person in this Aristocratical Government, in which the whole
Power of the Kingdom will be in Us, and so we may Govern as we shall Think
good.

An Other Soldiers Oration contrary to the Former.
Dear Countrymen, and Fellow Soldiers,
WE are Disputing with our Selves, what Government we shall Agree upon,
whether Democraty, or Aristocraty, or Monarchy, and I perceive you are Inclined
to Aristocraty, because that Government gives Room for all the Chief Commanders
to Share in the Government; but give me Leave to tell you, that we shall never
agree in that Government, for though we should be Fellow Statesmen, as we be
Fellow Soldiers, yet if we be Fellow Governors, we shall Ruin the
Commonwealth and our Selves; for we shall be like as a Kingdom Divided in it
self, which the Holy Writ says, cannot Stand, so we shall be Divided amongst
our Selves, striving which shall bear Sway; Wherefore, I am of the Opinion,
that Monarchy is the Best and Safest Government; for as there be Many Dangers,
and but One Courage, many Miseries, and but one Patience, many Appetites, and
but one Temperance, many Injuries and Wrongs, and but one Justice, many
Cheatings and Coosenages, and but one Honesty, many Falsehoods, and but one
Truth, many Creatures, and but one Creator, so where there are Many Subjects,
there ought to be but One Governor, which is a King, and he to have the
Sovereign Power.

An other Oration Different from the two Former.
Fellow Soldiers,
THe two former Orations were, One for Aristocraty, the Other for Monarchy; but
I am of an Opinion, as to have neither an Absolute Aristocraty, nor a
Monarchical Government, but a Government that shall be Mixed of the two Former,
as neither to have it Perfect Monarchy, nor Perfect Aristocraty, but mixed of
both; for as the Nobles are as the Head, to Guide, Direct, Rule, and Govern the
Common People, which are as the Body; so a King, or a Chief Governor, is as
the Brain to that Head, for without a Brain the Head would be but as an Empty
Scul, and without a Head and Brain the Body would be but as a Senseless Block;
Wherefore, a King or Chief Ruler, Joined to a Grand Counsel, is the Best
Government of all, for the Grand Counsel is the Eyes, Ears, Nose, Mouth, and
Tongue, for and in the Commonwealth, to spy our Errors, to see Advantages, to
hear Complaints, to smell out Dangers, and to Advise, Counsel, and Speak For
and Of that, which will be Best for the Commonwealth. The King, as the Brain,
is to Consider, Reason, Judge, Approve, and Conclude of what the Council has
Seen, Observed, Heard, Found, and Spoken; Wherefore, let us Choose out One
amongst us to make an Elective King, and he to give Judgment, drawing all the
several Opinions, Debates, and Disputes to a Conclusion, otherwise we shall
have a Division amongst us, for we shall Reason and Discourse of Many Things,
but Conclude not any.

An Oration, which is a Refusal of an Absolute Power.
Kind Countrymen,
YOu have Expressed not only your Good Opinion of me, but your Extraordinary
Love, by the Honor you Intend me, in making me your Absolute Governor and
Ruler, which is to be your King in Effect, though not in Name, which Honor I
neither Desire nor Deserve, for I never did my Country so much Service, as to
Merit such an Honor, neither have I those Abilities, or Capacities of
Knowledge, Understanding, Ingenuity, and Experience, as are Required for to
Manage and Govern a Kingdom, and to Conform the Diverse and Different Humors,
Extravagant Appetites, Unruly Passions, Various Dispositions, and Inconstant
Natures of a Numerous People, and Headstrong Multitude, to a Settled Order and
Obedience, as which is apter to Set up Authority, and Pull down Authority, than
to Obey Authority; but had I those Abilities, and Wisdom to Govern, and were
the whole Nation as Ready and Willing to Obey, and as Industrious and Careful
to Perform all my Commands, and were Devoted wholly to my Rule and Government,
yet Considering the Trouble and Continual Labor in the Employment and Affairs
of the State, and the Cares and Perturbations in the Mind, concerning those
Affairs, as the Maritime, Martial, and Judicial, as also the Civil, Common, and
Canonical, besides the Foreign, and Home Affairs, as Trade, and Intelligence,
and the like; I should not Willingly take upon me that Power, for a Kingly
Power is a Slavish Life, especially if he Governs as he Ought to do, as to be
the Chief Actor and Over-seer Himself, not Trusting those Affairs to the
Government and Ordering of some whom he Favors, only Keeping the Name and
Title to Himself, quitting the Labor and Trouble to Others; for he will not
have much Spare time for Himself, either for Soul or Body; the truth is, a Good
Governor is to be a Trusty, Industrious, Laborious Royal Slave; but if he be a
Tyrant, he Inslaves the People; And though I am willing to Take any Pains, and
to Employ all my Time, or to Lose my Life or Liberty for the Sake or Service of
my Country, yet, by Reason I am not Capable to Govern, nor fit to Rule so large
a Nation and many People, I cannot take this great Charge upon me, but most
Humbly Desire you to Excuse me, and Choose some other, who may better Deserve
it, and may more Wisely Govern it, that it may Flourish in it Self with Peace
and Plenty, and be Renowned and Famed through all the World, to which End, let
me Advise you to Choose one that is Born a King, and Bred a King, who will Rule
and Govern Magnificently, Majestically, Heroically, as a King ought to Do.

An Oration concerning Disorders, Rebellion, and Change of Governments.
Dear Countrymen,
YOu know well, without my Repeating, that Monarchy is a Government of One,
Aristocraty of Some, and a Republic of Most, or rather All; also you have
found by Woeful Experience, that this Kingdom has been Tossed from One Sort
of Government to an Other, that it is now so Exhausted, as to be almost
Expired: It was at first Monarchical, where in a Long Peace Flattery, Vanity,
and Prodigality, got into the Monarchical Court, all which caused Poverty, and
so Injustice, (for Poverty and Necessity is all times a Page to Prodigality,)
which Caused the Selling of all Offices and Places of Judicature, for those
that Buy Dear, are forced to Sell Dear, and this Caused Exactions and
Extorsions, besides, Bribes given and Bribes taken, insomuch, that no Justice
was done for Justice Sake, but Bribes Sake, and they, who gave the greatest
Bribes, had their Suit or Cause Judged of their side, whether Right or Wrong;
Nay, many Judges and Officers were so Ignorant, as they Knew not how to Judge
Rightly, or Execute any Public Affairs, as they should have done, had they a
Will to do Honestly; but how should they do either Wisely, Knowingly, or
Honestly, being not Chosen for Parts, Abilities, Understanding, or Merit, but
by Paying so much Money? this Fault in Government was a great Grievance; Also
Monopolizers Engrossed several and almost all Commodities in the Kingdom,
hightning their Price as they pleased, which hindered the General Trade and
Traffic, and this was an other great Grievance; Also there were great Taxes
laid upon the People and Kingdom, which was an other Grievance; Moreover,
needy Poor Courtiers would Beg that which ought not to be Granted, or Accuse
some Rich men to Get some of their Estates, at least to get a Bribe to be
Freed; all which begot such Dislike and Hatred, that the whole Kingdom
Rebelled with such a Fury, as they Pulled down Monarchy, and after much Blood
was Spilt in the War, they Set up a Repulick, in which Government the Commons
Chose the Magistrate and Officers of State, for which the Commons were grossly
Flattered by the Nobler Sort, which Vice of Flattery became a Studied and
Practiced Art, by which the Chief men became most Elegant and Eloquent Orators,
every Man striving to Out-Speak each other; but this Practice and Strife begat
Ambition and Envy in the Better Sort, and Pride in the Commons, which Pride was
hightned by their Power, to make Peace or War, to Choose Magistrates and
Officers, to Pull down or Advance, to give Life or Death, to Banish or Recall,
to Condemn or Reprieve; and all this Power lay in their Voices. O Powerful
Voice of a Headless Monster! this Power caused the Brainless People to be so
Proud, and withal so Envious, as also Malicious to those Men that had Merit
and Worth, having None Themselves, as they would often Banish, if not Put to
Death their Generous Nobles, Valiant Commanders, and Wise Magistrates, as also
those that were more Rich than their Neighbors; besides, they would Advance
Mean and Worthiless men, such as were of their own Degree and Quality, to
Places and Offices of Dignity, which Discontented the Nobles, and that
Discontent bred a Faction betwixt the Commons and Nobles, which Faction being
Increased by the Friends of the Banished or Executed Persons, brought forth a
Civil War, long was the Strife, but at last the Nobles got the Better, and
then the State or Government became Aristocraty, in which Government for some
time they Lived Agreeable, and Governed Justly and Orderly, but by Reason
Aristocraty is a Government of Some of the Nobles, and not of One, they could
not Long agree, Every one Striving to be Chief and most Powerful, insomuch
that through Envy and Ambition they would Cross and Oppose each other; for some
would keep Peace with their Neighbors, others would make War, and some would
have such or such Laws made, others would not, some would have some Old Laws
Abolished or Dissolved, others would Oppose them; neither was Justice Executed
as it ought, for some would Punish those, that others would Save, some would
Reward those, that others would Disgrace: Thus every one was Striving for
Supreme Power, although they did hinder One an Other, and by the means of Doing
and Undoing, Decreeing and Opposing, the People could not Tell whom to Address
their Suits, Causes, and Grievances to, for what one Spoke For, an other would
Speak Against, till at last by their Pulling several ways the Aristocratical
Government broke in Pieces, and then those Nobles set up each One for Himself,
and so there became another Civil War, Long was that War, for some times one
had the Better, and then an Other, and some times two or three Sides would Join
against the Rest, and then most against One, but now at last they being weary
with War, yet know not how to Agree in a Peace, insomuch, as we have neither
War, nor yet Peace, nor any Settled Government; the truth is, the Kingdom is
like as the Chaos and Confused Substance, and there is no way to bring it to an
Orderly Form, but to have a Native King, to bring Light out of Darkness, that
we may See our own Errors, and Reform our Faults and hereafter Live Happily
under the Government of a Good and Wise King, which I Prav the Gods to Send you.

An Oration to a Discontented People.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
AFter many Disorders, Several Governments, Cruel Wars, much Losses, and
almost Absolute Ruin, we desire to Associate and Agree in a Peace with our
First Government, which was Monarchy, a Government our Forefathers Chose for
the Best; But our Natures, I may say Mankind, are so Restless, as never to be
Contented with what we Have, were it the Best; for should the Gods Reign and
Rule Visibly upon Earth, we should find Fault, and be apt to Murmur, if not
Rebel against them; Wherefore I Fear, we shall never Continue long in Peace,
if a Celestial Power cannot Persuade us, a Terrestrial will never be able to
Keep us in Order; for if Mankind desire to be above the Gods, a Fellow Creature
will never be Satisfied with any Power, nor the Rest of Men will never be
Satissied with any Government, so as we shall never Live in a Settled Peace in
this World, nor never Dwell Peaceably but in the Grave, nor never be Happily
Governed, but by that Grim and Great Monarch Death.

An Oration in Complaint of the Former.
Noble Citizens, and Dear Countrymen,
THe Former Orators Oration, although it was Short, yet it was Sharp, for
though it was but a Dagger for Length, yet it was a Sword for Death, for he
partly Persuaded men to Dye Voluntarily, to Dwell in the Grave Peaceably, a
Cruel Persuasion, and a Wicked One, for Death is the Punishment of Sin, and
shall we Embrace our Punishment without Hopes of Redemption? shall we Dye
before a Repentance and Amendment? but Surely he Believes after this Life there
is none Other, but that is more than he Knows or can Prove, for I am Confident,
he has no Intelligence from Death, for Death is so Obscure, that there is not
any that Goes To him, which ever Returns From him into this World; But setting
aside the Former Orator and his Oration, give me Leave to Tell you, that you
are in the way of being Happy, in that you are Resolved to agree Peaceably
under a Monarchical Government, and to have a King, who shall have Absolute
Government, which Government, King and Power, is a Type of Heaven, God and his
Omnipotency, and I Hope we shall all Prove as Angels and Saints, for which I
Pray God to Grant, that we may Live in Unity, Peace, and Love.

A Kings Oration or Speech to his Subjects.
Beloved Subjects,
ANd I Hope you will Prove Such, you are Returned to your Obedience, and I to
my Rights, after along Absence the One from the Other; But since your Loyalty
and my Royalty have been Parted, we were never Happy, nay, we were never out of
Misery, and whose Fault was it, that Caused such Miseries? you in the Time of
Rebellion laid the Fault on Me, and I on You, which was a sign we were of
either Side Guilty, but of your Side Most; for though a King may Err in his
Government, yet a People Errs more in their Rebellion, for the Greatest Tyrant
that ever was, was never so Destroying or Cruel, as a Rebellion or Civil War,
for this makes a Dissolution, whereas the other makes but some Interruptions,
but now we have found our Errors, we shall mend our Faults, I in Governing, You
in Obeying, and I Pray the Gods to Bless us with Industry and Uniformity, Unity
and Love, Plenty and Tranquillity, that this Kingdom and People may Flourish
in all Ages, and have a Glorious Fame throughout the World.

A Generals Oration to his Chief Commanders.
Fellow Soldiers, and Gallant Commanders,
I Have Required your Assembly at this time, to Persuade you to Practice both
Riding and Fencing, when you have Spare time from Fighting; for it is
impossible you should Atchieve any Brave or Extraordinary Actions by your
Single Persons in the day of Battle, unless you be Excellent and Skillful in
the Manage of your Horses, and in the Use of your Swords, for your Horses well
Managed and well Rid, shall not only Overthrow your Opposites as Man and Horse,
that are Ignorant in the Art, but any One of you will be able to Disorder an
Enemies Troop; It Is true, an Ignorant HorseCommander has less Assurance than a
FootCommander, besides it is a Double Labor, and Requires a Double Art, as to
Manage a Horse and to Use a Sword Skilfully at one time, but then he has a
Double Advantage, if he can Ride well, and has a good Managed Horse, that
Obeyes well the Hand and the Heel, that can tell how to Turn, or to stop on the
Hanches, or to go Forward, or Side-wayes, and the like: The truth is, a good
Horseman, although not so well Skilled in the Use of the Sword, shall have
Advantage of an Ignorant Horseman, although well Skilled in the Use of the
Sword; but to Know both Arts is best for a good HorseSouldier. As for Foot
Commanders, they must Chiefly, if not only, Practice the Use of the Sword, for
it is the Sword that makes the greatest Execution; for though neither Horse nor
Sword is either Defensive or Offensive against Canon Bullets, yet they are both
Useful against Bodies of men; for all sorts of Bullets, either from Canons,
Muskets, or Pistols, will Miss ten times for Hitting once, whereas an Army when
Joining so Close as to Fight Hand to Hand, the Sword is the Chief and Prime
Executor, insomuch, that a Sword Skilfully or Artificially Used, has the
Advantage over the Strength of Clowns or their Clubs, or the But-ends of their
Muskets. Wherefore, a Complete Soldier should be as Knowing and well Practiced
in the Use of the Sword and the Management of his Horse, as in Drawing up a
Body of Men, and Setting or Pitching an Army in Battle Array; for by the
forementioned Arts you will make a great Slaughter, and a Quicker Dispatch to
Victory, and Gain a great Renown or Fame to each Particular Person, that are so
well Bred or Taught to be Horsemen and Swordmen.

SCHOLASTICAL ORATIONS
PART XV.
A Sleepy Speech to Students.
Fellow Students,
WHo Study to Think, and Think to Dream; As there are three Sorts of Worlds, so
there are three Kinds or Sorts of Life, viz. the Material, Poetical, and
Drowsy World, and the Dreaming, Contemplating, and Active Life; but of all
these three Worlds and three Lives, the Drowsy World and Dreaming Life is most
Wonderful, for it is as a Life in Death, and a Death in Life; and this Drowsy
World and Dreaming Life is a Type of an Unknown World, and an Unknown Life, for
Sleep is a Type of Death, and Dreaming is a Type of the Rewards and Punishments
in the other World; Good Dreams are like as the Rewards for the Blessed, and
Bad Dreams are like as Punishments for the Wicked, the One Receives Pleasure
and Joy, the Other Fear and Torments, and these Joys, Pleasures, Fears, and
Torments, are as Sensible to the Senses, and as Apparent to the Understanding
and Knowledge, as when Awake; also Memory and Remembrance, and the same
Appetites and Satisfactions are as Perfect in Dreams as when Awake, the
Passions of the Mind as Forcible; the Dispositions and Humors of the Nature as
Various, the Will as Obstinate, the Judgment as Deep, the Wit as Quick, the
Observation as Serious, Reason as Rational, Conception as Subtle, Courage as
Daring, Justice as Upright, Prudence as Wary, Temperance as Sparing, Anger as
Violent, Love as Kind, Fear as Great, Hopes and Doubts as Many, Joys as Full,
Hate as Deadly, Faith as Strong, Charity as Pitiful, and Devotion as Zealous
in Perfect Dreams as Awake: also they are as Uncharitable, Wicked, Foolish,
Cowardly, Base, Deboist, Furious, and the like in Perfect Dreams as Awake; but
Dreams in Sleeping Senses are Shorter, than the Actions of Waking Senses, and
not so Permanent, for they Suddenly Fade, and their Sudden Fading Oftentimes
makes a Confusion and more Disorder than in the Waking and Active Life; But to
Speak of the Sleeping Senses Generally and Particularly, have we not the same
Appetites, and Satisfactions? are not we Sensible of Dying, Living, Suffering,
Enjoying, Mourning, Weeping, Rejoicing, Laughing? are we not as Sensible of
Pain and Ease? of Accidents, Misfortunes, Dangers, and Escapes in Dreams, as in
Active Life? for if we Dream of Thieves and Murderers, are not we Sensible of
the Loss of our Goods, and of our Bonds, and Wounds? do we not See our Loss,
Feel our Bonds, and the Smarts and Pains of our Wounds as much as if we Saw and
Suffered Awake? and do not we Endeavor to Help our Selves? and do not we Beg
for Life, Call for Help, and Strive with Resistance as much in Dreams as Awake?
though not Vocally, Verbally, Locally, nor Materially, yet Spiritually, for it
is the Sensitive Spirits and not the Senses Gross Bodies or Parts that Travel
into Foreign Countries, and Unknown Lands, and make Voyages by Sea in Dreams; do
not we Hear and See in Dreams Lightning, Thunder, Wind, Storms, and Tempest,
Seas, Billows, Waves, Ships, Ship-wracks? and are not we Drowned in Dreams? and
do not we see Huge Precipices, Barren Deserts, Wide Forests, and VVild Beasts
and Serpents, and other hurtful Creatures, and Endeavor to Escape and Avoid
the Danger? do not we feel Stinging Serpents and Flies, Striking, Tearing,
Clawing, Biting Beasts, as Sensibly in Dreams as Awake? do not we see Flowery
Meddows, Low Valleys, High Hills, Cornfields, Green Meddows, Grazing Pastures
and Beasts, Clear Springs, Fruitful Orchards, and Small Villages, Laboring
Husbandmen, Great Cities and Many People? do not we see Light, Colors, Sun,
Moon, Stars, Clouds, Rain, Frost, Snow, Hail, Shade, Dawning Mornings, and
Closing Evenings, in Dreams, as Awake? do not we see Fish Swim, Birds Fly,
Beasts Run, Worms Creep, in Dreams, as Awake? do not we see our Friends
Living, and our Friends Dying, and those that be Dead, in Dreams, as Awake? do
not we feel Drought, VVetness, Heat, Cold, Itching, Scratching, Smarting,
Aching, Biting, Sickness, in Dreams, as Awake? do not we hear all Warring
Sounds, and see all Warring Actions, and feel all Warring Miseries? do not we
see Courts, Balls, Masks, Beauties, Plays, and Pastimes? do not we see Musical
Instruments, and hear Harmonious Music, and Several Tunes, Notes, Airs, Words,
Voices, distinctly? do not we see Feasts and Bankets, and do not we Taste the
several Meats distinctly, not only Fish, Flesh, and Fowls, but distinctly every
Sort and Particular Taste of every Part, also the Ingrediences of the Sauces
and their Particulars in them? and do not we Taste Bitter, Salt, Sour, Sharp,
and Sweet, distinctly in Dreams, and the several Sorts of them? and do not we
Smell the several Perfumes, that are by Art and Nature made, as also the
several Stinks, in Dreams, as Awake? And for Desires and Ambitions, would we
have our Dead Friends Living, have we not them in Dreams? or can we See and
Converse with Them, or they to Us, as if they were Alive, but in Dreams? nay,
in Dreams we may Rejoice with Them, Feast with Them, Sport and Play with Them,
Ask their Advice, or Give them Advice, and the like; would we have a Beautiful
Mistress, or many several Mistresses of different Beauties, Behaviors, Births,
Fortunes, Wits, and Humors, have not we them in Dreams? would we Enjoy a
Mistress, do not we so in Dreams? would we be Rich, Noble, Generous, Valiant,
are not we so in Dreams? would we see the Ruin of our Enemies, do not we so in
Dreams? would we have our Enemies Dye or be Killed, do not they Dye or are
Slain in Dreams? would we have Stately Palaces, have not we so in Dreams? would
we Feed Luxuriously, do not we so in Dreams? would we Live Riotously, do not we
so in Dreams? would we View our Selves, as to see our Faces and Bodies, do not
we so in Dreams? would we Ride, Race, Hunt, Hawk, and have the like Pastimes
and Exercises, do not we so in Dreams? would we Win at Carts, do not we so in
Dreams? would we Fight Duells and Battles, and have Victory, have not we
Victory in Dreams? would we Conquer all the World, do not we so in Dreams?
would we be Emperor to Rule and Govern all the World, do not we so in Dreams?
But as I said, that there are Pleasing and Delightful Dreams, so there are
Displeasing and Fearful Dreams, and there is as much Trouble, Disorder, and
Opposition in the Sleepy or Drowsy World, and as much Discontent, Faction,
Detraction, Defamation, Troubles, and the like, in this Dreaming Life, as there
is Method, Order, Agreement, Praise, Trust, and the like, therein; yet for all
that, this Drowsy World and Dreaming Life is the Best of the three; for can
there be greater Pleasure in the Material World and Active Life, than Rest to
the Weary Limbs, and Sleep to the Tired Senses, which have been Overpowered
with Gross Objects, which have Laid Heavy Burdens on them? or can we Enjoy any
thing so Easily, Freely, Suddenly, without Actual Trouble, as we do in Dreams?
or can we be Quit of all Sorts and Kinds of Trouble and Labor, but by Sleep?
Wherefore, if Dreams were but more Constant and of Longer Continuance, and that
we should always Dream Pleasing Dreams, the Greatest Happiness, Next to the
Blessed Life in Heaven, were to Sleep and Dream, for it would be much more
Pleasant than the Elyfian Fields. The Next World and Life that were to be
Preferred, were the Poetical World, and Contemplative Life, but all the Senses
are not Sensible in the Contemplative Life, whereas all the Senses are as
Sensible in the Dreaming Life, as Awake; the truth is, the Poetical World, and
Contemplative Life, is rather a World for the Thoughts, and a Life for the
Mind, than the Senses, yet if the Senses were as Sensible in Contemplation as
in Dreams, it would be the Best Life of all, because it might make the Life
what it Would, and the Pleasures of that Life to Continue as Long, and to Vary
as Often as it Thought Good, and for the Poetical World or rather Worlds, they
would be a Delight to View as well as to Live in.

A Waking Oration of the former Sleepy Discourse.
Fellow Students,
OUr Brother in Learning, or rather Dreaming, has Commended that which is an
Enemy to Study, viz. Sleeping and Dreaming, wherefore in the Drowsy World, and
Dreaming Life, there be no Scholars, for they cannot Sleep to Study, nor Dream
so much as to be very Learned; neither are there Poets, for Poets Live
altogether in their Own Poetical World, and Contemplative Life; neither are
there Eloquent Orators, for Dreams will be Faded before an Oration is half
Spoken, or else the Subject of their Oration will be Lost in the Variousness of
Dreams; neither can there be Pleaders at the Bar, nor Preachers in the Pulpit,
for their Text and Cases may be altered in a moment of Time, from Gospel to a
Romancy, from Law to Riot; neither can there be Justice on Life and Death, for
by the Alteration of Dreams the Thief may Escape, and the Honest man Hang, or
the Judge may Hang Himself; neither can there be a Settled Government in Dreams,
for the Government may End in a Piece of a Dream, or instead of a Commonwealth
of Men, be a Forest of Wild Beast; neither can there be Wise Counselors, or
Grave Statesmen, for their Gray Faces and Gray Beards may be Changed into
Monkies Faces and Goats-Beards, and the Wise Counselors in the midst of their
Serious Advices may on a sudden Sing a Wanton Song, or else there may Suddenly
appear a Tumultuous Monster, or a Monstrous Tumult, where in a great Fright
they will Run from their CouncilBord or Senate House; and as for School
Arguments and Disputations, they are quite Banished, and for Lovers, a Hundred
to One, that when a Dreaming Lover is Embracing a Young Fair Lady, she Suddenly
turns into an Old Illfavoured VVitch, or for a Plump, Smooth, Smiling Venetian
Courtisan, he Chances to Embrace Grim Death's Bare Rattling Bones, which will
Fright a Lover more than a Fair Mistress can Delight him: And as for Dancing
Balls, and French Fiddles, when the Gallants in Dreams are Dancing in Smooth
Measures, and with Fair Ladies, and the Music keeping Tune to the Dancing
Time, on a Sudden the Courtly Dancers or Dancing Courtiers turn Topsie Turvy,
Dancing with their Heads Downward, and Heels Upward, a very Unbecoming Posture
for Fair-faced Ladies; and as for the Music, that is quite out of Tune, and
the Fiddle-strings Broken, and the Musicians as Mad as March-hares, and many
other such like Disorders, Confusions, and Extravagancies, as Asses Heads or
Bulls Horns set on Men's Bodies, or a Wood-cocks Head to an Asses Tail, as also
Men turned to Beasts, Birds, and Fish; also walking Woods and Trees; but set
aside the Extravagancies, Deformities, and Monstrosities in Dreams, yet there
are more Bad Dreams than Good, more Fearful than Delightful, more Troublesome
than Quiet, more Painful than Easy; Wherefore, the Dreaming Life is a worse
Life than any, and the Drowsy or Sleepy World is only good for Dull, Lasie,
Unprofitable Creatures; and as the Dreaming Life is the Worst, so the
Contemplating Life is the Best, and the Poetical World the Pleasant'st, for all
Wise, Witty, Learned, Ingenious, Good, and Pious men dwell all in the
Contemplative Life, and for the most do Lovers of all Sorts, especially Amorous
Lovers, for they take more Pleasure to Think of their Mistresses, than to Speak
with their Mistresses, for they can Entertain the Idea of their Mistresses a
Long time with great Delight, whereas they grow Soon weary of their Real
Persons. Thus the Contemplative Life is Best, for true Pleasure and Delight is
not in the Senses, but in the Mind, for Delights and Pleasures are but
Passengers through the Senses, and Inhabitors in the Mind; besides, whatsoever
the Senses have Enjoyed, Lives in the Mind after their Enjoyment, and though
the like is for Pains and Surfeits, yet the Mind may Fling them out, or if it
Fling them not out, yet it may Fling them aside from Troubling it, and though
the Mind cannot Satisfy the Gross Appetites of the Senses, yet those
Satisfactions Live in the Mind, when as the Senses, though they would, cannot
longer Enjoy them; the truth is, that the Senses are but as Hired Laborers,
not Owners, they are Actors, not Possessors, for the Mind is the Lord of all,
and not only Possessor and Lord of all the Satisfactions of the Appetites, and
the Objects and Subjects of the Senses, but it is Lord of that which the Senses
cannot know, being beyond their Capacity, having a Power of Forming, Composing,
Altering, Changing, Making, Continuing, Prolonging, Keeping, Putting away, or
Destroying whatsoever it Pleases: All which makes the Contemplative Life the
Best, being Happiest and Pleasant'st; and as for the Poetical World, it is the
most Splendorous World that is, for it is Composed of all Curiosities,
Excellencies, Varieties, Numbers, and Unities: In short, it is a World that is
Extracted out of Infinite Wit, Ingeniosity, Judgment, Experiences,
Understanding, Knowledge, and good Nature, it is the Heaven, and Contemplation
is the Spiritual Life in this Poetical World.

Of Parts and Wholes.
Fellow Students,
THe Question in the School at this time is, whether a Part taken from a Whole,
remains a Part after the Dividing or Separating, or becomes a Whole of it
Self, when it is Divided; Some are of the Opinion, that after a Part is Divided
from the Whole, it is no longer a Part of such a Whole, either of Figure or
Matter, but is a Whole of it Self; but if it be as we believe, that the Bodies
of Men shall have a Resurrection, then it Proves that the several Divided,
Separated, and Dispersed Parts, with their Joining and Consistent Motions and
Essential Powers, shall Meet and Join to make the Whole Body; which Proves,
that although Parts be Separated, yet they are Parts of such, or such a Whole
Body or Figure; also they remain distinctly in Nature, as Parts to such a Body,
otherwise they could not Return at the Resurrection so Readily, to Compose the
Whole by the Joining and Uniting of every Part into One Whole Body. But to
Conclude, as all Creatures are Parts of Infinite Matter, so the Divided Parts
of every Creature are Parts the Whole Figur, or Body of every Creature and as
there is Infinite Matter, so Infinite Creatures, and Infinite Parts, and
Infinite Figures Of every and In every Part and Whole.

An other of the same Subject.
Fellow Students,
THe Former Student Endeavors to Prove that Parts pertain to their Wholes, and
I may Endeavor to Prove that Wholes pertain to Parts, as much as Parts pertain
to Wholes, for there can be no Whole without Parts, nor no Part without a
Whole; but howsoever, all Parts and Wholes of every Creature were from all
Eternity, and so Consequently shall be to all Eternity, for as they were, so
they will be; for if such Matter, Motions, Powers, Creatures, Parts, and
Figures, had not been formerly in Nature, they would, nor could not have been
in Nature's Power at this time to Produce them: but some might Question what
Nature is? I might Answer, that Nature is Matter, Motion, and Figure: Then some
might Question, what Power Nature has? It might be Answered, Nature has Power
to Create, and Uncreate: Again, others might Ask, who gave Nature that Power?
It might be Answered, that Natures Power proceeds from Infinite and Eternity,
and that it is not a Gift: and some may Question, how Infinite and Eternity
came but that is such an Infinite question, as not to be Answered: for
whatsoever is Infinite and Eternal, is God, which is something that cannot be
Described or Conceived, nor Prescribed, or Bound, for it has neither Beginning
nor Ending.

Of the Soul.
Fellow Students,
THe Argument at this time is to Prove, whether the Soul be a Thing or Nothing,
a Substance or no Substance; some of our Fellow Students endeavor to prove the
Soul Nothing, as not to be a Substance, but, as they call it, an Incorporeal
Thing, because it Alters or Forms every Thing to its own Likeness, or as it
Pleases; for say they, whatsoever the Senses bring Corporeal, the Soul makes
Incorporeal; but it may be Answered, that Fire makes all Things or at least
most Things or Substances like it Self, so long as it Works on Combustible
Matter; and shall we say, or can we believe, that Fire is an Incorporeal Thing,
because it Transforms most Things into its own Likeness? Wherefore, my Opinion
is, that the Soul is a Substance, yet such a Substance, as to be the Rarest and
Purest Substance in Nature, which makes it so apt to Ascend, as to make the
Brain the Residing place; it is the Celestial Part of Man, whereas the Body is
but the Terrestrial Part.

A Speech concerning Studies.
Fellow Students,
WE Study to Argue, and Argue to Study, for the chief Design of our Study is
only to Dispute, either by the Tongue, or Pen, or Both; but all Disputes are
more full of Contradictions than Informations, and all Contradictions Confound
the Sense and Reason, at least Obstruct the Understanding, and Delude the
Judgment; for it keeps the One from a Clear Insight, and the Other from a
Settled Conclusion; so as we Argue rather to make our Selves Fools, than to make
our Selves Wise.

An other of the same Subject.
Fellow Students,
THe Former Student Speaks against Arguing and Disputing, and so in Effect
against Study and Learning; but to what Purpose should we Study or Learn, if we
did not Inform each other of our Conceptions, or at least our Opinions, which
are Bred or Learned by our Studies? also what Advantage should Wise, or
Subtle, or Eloquent Orators, or great Schoolmen have, if they had not Studious
Disciples to Follow them, Admire, Praise, and Imitate them? But as it is
Honorable to be Learned, so it is Wise to Learn, for Knowledge is gotten by
Information, and the best Informers are Wise Books, which Books must first be
Read and Studied, before they can be Understood; also Arguing and Disputing is
a great Increase of Knowledge, for it Distinguishes Truth from Falsehood, Clears
the Understanding, Quickens the Wit, and Refines the Language; it Exercises the
Memory, makes the Tongue Volubile, and the Speech Tunable; and if it were not
for Study, Learning, and Practice, there would neither be Religion, Law, nor
Justice, neither would there be Preachers, Pleaders, nor General Orators; for
should Study be Neglected, and Arguments Rejected, men would intime Degenerate
their Kind from being Men to be like Beast, whereas Learning makes men Divine,
as to Resemble God and Nature, in Knowledge and Understanding; also it makes
Men in some things Creators, as in Conceptions, Imaginations, Fancies, Arts,
and Sciences.

An other Concerning the same Subject.
Fellow Students,
THe Former Student Contradicted the first Students Speech, and if I should
Contradict this second Students Speech, as he did the first, it would be the
Perfect Figure, Picture or Character of Controversy and Controversers; and if
every Disputant or Arguer should Contradict each other, in time there would be
a great Confusion, not only in the Schools, but in the Minds of Men, and not
only in the Minds, but in the Souls of Men; for if every Controverser or
Disputer were of a Several Opinion, and those Opinions should be Concerning
Religion, there would be more Several Religions, than the Son of God, as he was
Man, could Decide or Judge at the Last day; But all Controversers in Divinity,
are apt to breed Atheism; Wherefore, it were very Necessary, that all Divine
Scholars, or Scholars in Divinity, should Agree on One Ground and Substantial
Belief, otherwise the World in time will be Confounded in Factions, and Damned
through Atheism.

An other Concerning the same Subject.
Fellow Students,
OUr Former Fellow in Learning, persuades us to an Impossibility, as that All
Men should Agree in One Opinion or Belief, but how can that be? Since by, and
in Nature, all Men, especially Scholars, are so Opinative, and Conceited of
their own Wit and Judgment, as that Every Man thinks himself as Wise as his
Neighbor, and that his Opinion may be as Probable, and his Belief as well
Grounded as an other Man's; and they have Reason, for, why may not I think I am
as Wise as an Other, and why may not an Other think himself as Wise as I, and
yet be Both of Different Opinions? and though our Opinions be Different, yet
our Degrees of Judgment may be Equal; for I do not Perceive, that Nature has
made any One Man to Transcend all Other men in VVisdome, for Natures Gifts are
General, and not Particular, and if any One Man should say, he is Inspired from
Heaven, how can we Believe him, when as we cannot Tell, whether he be so or
not? also it is as Difficult, to find out an other man to Judge of his
Inspiration, as to know whether he be Inspired. Wherefore, to Conclude, all
Mankind will never Agree of One Teacher or Judge, and so not of One Opinion or
Belief.

An other of the same Subject.
Fellow Students,
WE Complain of the Differences in our Arguments, Disputes, and Opinions, but
we never Complain of the Subjects of our Studies, Arguments, or Disputes, for
we Spend our Time, and Wear out our Lives in our Studies and Discourses, to
prove Something Nothing, as witness, Motions, Notions, Thoughts, and the like;
nay, all Scholars and Student, Endeavor to make or at least to Persuade us to
Believe, that our Rational Souls are Nothing, a Incorporeal, which is, to have
a Being, but not the Substance of a Body, which is as Impossible, as to be a
Body, and no Body; also they Endeavor to make the Matter of the Universe to be
Nothing, as that it is made of Nothing, and shall return to Nothing; the Worst
of all is, that they Dispute so Elevating, as to make all Divinity like as a
Logistical Egg, which is Nothing; but if they could make Sin and Punishment
Nothing, their Arguments would be Something, whereas now their Arguments are
Empty Words, without Sense or Reason, only fit for Fools to Believe, and Wise
men to Laugh at; But I wish that our Studies and Arguments may be such, as to
Benefit our Lives, and not such as to Confound our Saving Belief.
