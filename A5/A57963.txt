CHRIST DYING AND DRAWING SINNERS TO HIMSELF.

OR A survey of our Savior in his soule-suffering, his lovelynesse in his
death, and the efficacy thereof.

In which Some cases of soule-trouble in weak believers, grounds of submission
under the absense of Christ, with the flowings and heightnings of Free grace,
are opened.

Delivered in Sermons on the Evangel according to S. John Chap. XII. Verse.
27.28.29.30.31.32.33.

Where also are interjected some necessary Digressions, for the times, touching
diverse Errors of Antinomians, and a short vindication of the Doctrine of
Protestants, from the Arminian pretended universality of Christ's dying for all,
and every one of mankind; the Moral and fained way of resistible conversion of
sinners, and what faith is required of all within the visible Church, for the
want whereof, many are condemned.

TO THE JUDICIOUS AND Godly Reader.
IF, in this luxuriant and wanton Age of proud and rank wits; any should write
of this kind, and be wanting to the exalting of the Plant of renown, the
flower of Issai, Jesus Christ, and to the dew of his youth, the free grace of
God, his heart may censure his pen, and he, who is greater then the man's heart,
should challenge him. The weak and low aim of a sinner, writing of a Savior,
and such a Savior should be, that Faith and sense may go along with tongue
and pen, but how short most men come, of reaching such an end, who cannot but
confess?

The mind may be calmed a little in this, that, though to speak highly of
Christ, be, in poor men, who are so low under, and unequal to so great a
Province, a marring rather of his dignity, and a flattering of Christ, then a
real praising of, or pointing him out in all his virtues and loveliness, in
regard that the foulness of the breath of a sinner may blacken the beauty of
such a transcendent and incomparable flower, that Esaiah a high, eminent, and
Gospel-Prophet is at his wits end, at a nonplus, a stand, and gives over the
matter as a high question; Who shall declare his generation? And another, What
is his name, Ps^^, 53 8.
and what is his Sons name, if thou can tell? All that ever wrote, lie down
under this load, and though many now a days give out, they have so much of the
Lord Jesus, that they are Christed and swallowed up in his love, yet should I
think it all happiness, if I could but tell Christ's name, and were so deep
learned as to know how they call him. In truth, in regard of any comprehensive
knowledge, we but speak and write our guessings, our far-off and twy-light
apprehensions of him; and, in regard of coming up to the clear vision of a
Gospel-noon-day light, as we are obliged; we but cast the blind man's club,
and but play (as children do with the golden covering, and silken ribbens of
an Arabicke Bible that they cannot read) about the borders and margent of the
knowledge of Christ? O how rawly do the Needle-headed Schoolmen writ of
Christ! O how subtle and Eagle-eyed seem they to be in speculations!
Grave-deepe, or rather hell-deep, touching his grave-linnens, what become of
them, when he rose from the dead, and the chesse-nut color of his hair, and
the wood of his Cross, and the three nails that wedged him to the tree, and
the adoring of any thing that touched his body, either wood, iron, or nails of
the holy grave? And how far from that. Cant. 8.6. Set me as a seal on thy
heart, as a signet on thine arm.

There be volumes written of Christ, Sermon upon Sermon, and not line upon line
only, but Book upon Book, and Tomb upon Tomb. And ah! we are but at the
first side of the single Catechism of Christ, spelling his first elements;
yea, Solomon was but at, What is his Name? I fear, too many of us know neither
name nor thing; nay, in this learned Age, when Antinomians wri^e book after
book of Christ, I should say, for all their crying, O the Gospel Spirit, the
Gospel-straine of Preaching, the Mystery of free grace, (which few of them
know) that one ounce, one grain of the spiritual and practical knowledge of
Christ is more to be valued then talent-weights, yea, Ship-loads, or
mountains of the knowledge of the dumb Schoole-letter.

They say, the Saints are perfect, and their works perfect. I slander them not,
read Master Town, Town asser. of (...), page 76 77.78 Eaton Honey comb of
justifi^ati^n, ca* 11 page 338.339.340.341, etc. Saltmarsh Free grace, page
140. Luther in an Epistle to D. Guttel against the Antinomians.
M. Eaton, and Saltmarsh. But how ignorant are they of the Gospel, how ill read
and little versed in Christ? Yea, as Luther said, Take away sin, and ye take
away Christ a Savior of sinners; how little acquainted with, and how great
strangers to their own hearts are they in writing so. There is a fullness (I
confess) and an all-fulnesse, and all-fulnesse of God, Ephesians. 3.19. But I much
doubt, if this complete all-fulnesse of God, be in this side of eternity; sure
it cannot stand with our halfe-penny candle, nor can it be that in our soul,
with the darkness of an in-dwelling body of sin, should shine the
noone-day-vision of glory, called Theologia Meridiana visionis.

It Is true, Paul's ravishment to the third heavens, John's being in the Spirit,
and seeing the heavens opened, and beholding the Throne, and him that sat on
it, and the troops clothed in white, that have come out of great tribulation,
do clearly evidence, Saints may in this life be in the Suburbs of heaven, but
the Suburbs is not the City. God may, and does open a window in the new
Jerusalem, and let them see, through that hole the young morning glances of the
daylight of glory, and a part of the Throne, and the half of his face that
sits on the Throne, and the glorious undefiled ones that stand before the
Throne, but this fullness does not overflow to brimme and bank; the Vessel is
in a capacity to receive many quarts and gallons more of the new Wine of glory,
that grows in that new Land of Harmony. Now Antinomians lay all our perfection
on J^stification and Remission of sins; yet pardon of sins (except in the
sense, which is a graduall accident of pardon, and not pardon it self) is not
like the new Moon that receives fuller, and more light till it be full Moon;
for Remission is as perfect and full a freedom from the Law guilt and wrath to
come, at the first moment of our justification, as ever it shall be, they
ascribe not our perfection in this life to Sanctification, which yet they must
do, if sin in its nature and being dwell not in us.

And for our engagement to Jesus Christ, for the price and ransom he has
paid for us, we have nothing to say, but pay praises to our Creditor Christ,
or rather suspend, while we be up before the Throne, with the millions of
broken men, the engaged Saints, that there we may sing our debts in an
everlasting Psalm, for here we can but sigh them; the book of our engagements
to Christ is written full, Page and Margent within and without; its a huge book
of many volumes, and the millions of Ange^s to whom Christ is head, Col. 2.10.
owe their Redemption from possible sins, and possible chains of eternal
vengeance, that their fellow-An^^ls actually lie under. Then, O what huge
sum^^^s are all the inhabitants of heaven owing to Christ?

And what can Angels and Men say, but Christ is the head of Principalities and
Powers, Col. 2.10. Yea, the Head over all things to the Church, which is his
body, the fullness of him that fills all in all, Ephesians. 1.22, 23. The
Chiefetaine of ten thousands, yea, of all the Lords millions, and hoasts in
heaven and earth, Cant. 5.10. When all the created expressions, and dainty
flowers of being, Heavens, Sun, Moon, Stars, Seas, Birds, Fishes, Trees,
Flowers, Herbs that are in the element of nature, or issued out of Christ,
there be infinite possibilities of more rich beings in him, when out of Christ
do stream such rivers of full grace to Angels and Men, and to all Creatures
beside, that by participation, in their kind, communicate with them in drops
and bedewings of free goodness; it being a result of courtesy and freeness
of Mediatory grace, that the systeme and body of the Creation, which for our
sin is condemned to perish, should continue and subsist in being and beauty,
Yet o what more, and infinite more of whole and entire Christ remains in him
never seen; nay, not comprehensible by created capacities; and when not only
in the Sphere of grace, but in that highest Orb and Region of glory, such
hoasts and numerous t^oups of glorified Pieces, redeemed Saints, and elect
Angels that are by anticipation ransommed from their contingent fall into
sin, and possible eternity of ^^ngeance, do stand beside him as created
emanations, and twigs that sprang out of Christ, there i^ an infiniteness
invisible and incomprehensible in him; y^a, yet when all these chips, created
leavings, small blossoms, daughters, and births of goodness and grace have
streamed out from him, he is the same infinite Godhead, and would, and does
out-tyre, and weary Men and Angels, and whatsoever is possible to be created,
with the only act of wondering, and surveying of so capacious and boundless a
Christ; here is Gospel-worke for all eternity to gloryfied workmen, Angels and
Ransomed Men, to dig into this Gold-mine, to roll this soule-delighting and
precious stone, to behold, view, inquire, and search into his excellency. And
this is the saciety, the top and prime of heavens glory and happiness, to see,
and never out-see, to wonder, and never over-wonder the virtues of him that
sits on the Throne; to be filled, but never satiate with Christ. And must it
then not be our sin, that we stand aloof from Christ? Surely, if we did not
love the part above the whole, and the dross of that part, even the froward
will, more then our soul; Christ should not be so far out of either request
or fashion, as he is.

If Antinomians offend, or such as are, out of ignorance, seduced, hate me for
heightning Christ, not in a Gospel-license, as they do; but in a strict and
acurate walking, in commanding of which, both law and Gospel do friendly
agree, and never did, and never could jarre, or contest; I threaten them, in
this I write, with the revenge of good will, to have them saved, in a weak
aim, and a far off, at least, desire, to offer to their view such a
Gospel-Idea, and rep^esentation of Christ, as the Prophets and Apostles have
shown in the word of his Kingdom, who opens the secrets of the Father to the
Sons of men.

And for Arminians now risen in England, and such as are both Arminians and
Antinomians, such as is M. Den, and others, they lie stated to me in no other
view, but as enemies of the grace of God; and when Antinomians and Anabaptists
now in England, join hands with Pelagians, Jesuits, and Arminians; I cannot
but wonder, why the Arminians, Socinians and Antichristian abusers of free
grace, and free-will-worshippers, should be more defended and patronized now,
as the godly party, then at that time, when the Godly cried out so much against
them, and out-prayed the unclean Prophet out of the Land; Sure a white and a
black Devil must be of the same kindred. Grace is always grace, never
wantonness.

Nor can we enough praise, and admire the flowings, the rich emanations, and
deep living Springs of the Sea, of that fullness of grace that is in Christ.
Come and draw, the Well is deep, and what drops or dewings fall on Angels or
Men, are but chips of of that huge and boundless body of the fullness of grace
that is in Christ; one Lilly is nothing to a boundless and broad field of
Lillies. Christ is the Mountain of Roses; O! how, high, how capacious how
full, how beautiful, how green; could we smell him who feeds among Lillies,
till the day break, and the shadows flee away, and dive into the gold veins
of the unsearchable Riches of Christ, and be drunken with his wine; we should
say, Its good to be here; and to gather up the fragments that fall from Christ.
His Crown shines with Diamonds and Pearls, to, and through all Generations:
The Land of Emanuel, is an excellent soil. O but his heaven lies well, and
warmely, and heartsomely, nigh to the Sun, the Sun of righteousness; the
fruit of the Land is excellent, glory grows on the very out-fields of it. O
what dewings of pure and unmixed joys lie for etern^ty, on these eternally
springing mountains and gardens of Spices; and what do we here* Why do we
toil our selves in gathering sticks to our nest, when to morrow we shall be
gone out of this? Would these considerations out-worke and tire us out of our
self to him, it were our all-happinesse.

1. Many Ambassadors God sent to us, none like Christ, he is God, and the
noble and substantial representation of God, the very self of God, God
sending, Zach. 13.7.
and God sent, the fellow of God, his companion; and God, and not another God,
but a Son, another subsistence and person.

2. For kindred and birth, a begotten Son, and never begun to be a Son,
nor to have a Father; of Gods most ancient house, a branch of the King of Ages
that was never young. And in reference to us, the first begotten of many
brethren.

3. For Office; never one like him, to make peace between God and Man, by the
blood of an eternal Covenant, a dayes-man wholly for God; God in nature, mind,
will, power, holiness, and infinite perfection, a dayes-man for himself, a
dayes-man wholly for us, on our side, by birth, blood, good will, for us, with
us, and us, in nature.

4. What unwearinesse of love suiting us in Marriage; what is Christ's good will
in pouring out his Spirit, his love, his soul, his life, himself for us; had
Christ more then his own noble and excellent self to give for us?

5. How long he seeks; how long a night-raine wet his locks and hair! How long
a night is it, he stands at the Church-doore knocking? Cant. 5.1. Revel. 3.20.
there be many hours in this night; since he was preached in Paradise, and yet
he stands to this day, how feign would he come, and how glad would he be of
lodging; the arm that has knocked five thousand years aches not yet, behold
he stands and knocks, and will not give over till all be his, and till the
Tribes in ones and twees be over Jordan, and up with him in the good land; he
cannot want one, nor half an one; yea Ioh 6 39. not a bit of a Saint.

6. The sinners on earth, and glorified in heaven are of one blood; they had
once as foul faces, and as guilty souls on earth, as you and I have; o but
now they are made fair, and stand before the Throne washed, and without spot;
grace and glory has put them out of your kenning, but they are your borne
brethren, all the Seas and Fountains on earth cannot wash asunder your blood
and theirs, and there is not upon any in that renowned Land, the mark,
impression, shadow, or stead of any blot of sin; and Christ washes as
clean now, as ever he did; you are not so black, nor so sin burnt, but he will
make you white like all the rest of the children of the house, that you shall
misken your self for beauty of glory; thou art at the worst a sinner, and but
a sinner, and a sinner is nothing to Christ.

7. There shall be use for free grace in the Land of glory, every new day and
month of glory (let us so apprehend, as if there were pieces of endless
Eternity, for our weakness) shall be a new debt of free grace, because Christ
is never, never shall be our debtor, merit of creatures cannot enter heaven
for eternity, the holding of glory shall be free grace without end, then must
Christ's relation of a Creditor, and ours of debtors grow, and be greener for
evermore in an eternal bud, ever spring, and never the top and flower of
harvest, and we ever pay, and ever praise, and ever wade in further and deeper
in in the Sea of free love, and the growing of the new contracted debts of
eternal grace, and the longer these white Companies and Regiments that
follows the Lamb live there, the more broken debtors are they, so as Christ
can never lay aside his Crown of grace, nor we our Diadem of glory, holden
still by the only Charter, and eternally continued, writing of free grace,
prorogated and spunne out daily (to borrow that word, where no Time grows) in
a thread as long as eter^ity, and the living of God; O the ^ast and endless
thoughts, and O the depth of unsearchable grace!

8. Better a thousand times live under the government and tutorie of Christ, as
be your own, and live at will. Live in Christ, and you are in the suburbs of
heaven, there is but a thin wall between you and the land of praises; ye
are within an hours sailing of the shore of the new Canaan. When death digges
a little hole in the wall, and takes down the sails, ye have no more ado
but set your foot down in the fairest of created Paradises.

9. Its unpossible Christ can be in heaven, and pieces and bitts of Christ
Mystical should be in hell, or yet long on earth. Christ will draw in his
l^gges, and his members on earth in to himself, and up nearer the head, and
Christ, and you must be under one roof. What* Mansions are nothing, many
Mansions are little; yea many Mansions in Christ's Fathers House, are created
chips of happiness, and of blood and kin to nothing; if they be created,
(...) we want himself, and I should refuse heaven if Christ were not there,
take Christ away from heaven, and its but a poor, unheart^ome, dark, waste
dwelling; heaven without Christ, should look like the direful land of death.
Ah! says Christ, your joy must be full, Ioh 14.3. I will come again, and
receive you to my self, that where I am, there ye may be also. I confess,
Mansions are but as places of briars and thorns without Christ, therefore I
would have heaven for Christ, and not Christ for heaven.

10. Formal blessedness is created, but objective happiness is an uncreated
Godhead. Let the waters an^ st^eames retire into the bosom of this deep^
Fountain and Spring of infiniteness, and there can they not rot, no^ so ^re,
nor deaden, but are kept fresh for ever; come and grow upon this stock the
eternally green and ever springing tree of life, and you live upon the
fatness, sap, sweetness, and life of this renowned plant of Paradise for ever.

11. An act of living in Christ, and on Christ, in the acts of loving, seeing,
enjoying, embracing, resting on him, is that noonday Divinity and Theology,
of beatifice vision. There is a general assembly of immediately illuminated
Divines round about the throne, who study, lecture, preach* praise Christ night
and day. O what rays, what irradiations and darttings of intellectual
fruition, beholding, enjoying, living in him, and fervor of loving, come from
that face, that God-visage of the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb that is in
the midst of them, and over-covers, weights, and loads the beholders within and
without, and then there must be reflections, and reachings of intellectual
vision, embracing, loving, wondedring, returning back to him again, in a
circle of glory; and then who but the Bridegroom, and the Spouse, the Lambs
wife, in an act of an eternal espousing, marrying, and banqueting together;
who but Christ and his followers? Who but the All in All? The I am? The Prince
of Ages?

12. And so eminent is the wisdom, and depth of the unsearchable riches of the
grace of Christ, that though God need not sin, and sin be contrary to his
holy and most righteous will, yet the design, the heavenly, lovely, most holy,
state-contrivance of sins entrance in the world, drawn through the fields of
free grace, proclaims the eminency and never-enough admired and adored art
and profound wisdom of God; had sin never been, the glorious second person
of the blessed Trinity, and the eternal Spirit had been, and must be the same,
one ever blessed God with the Father. For the glorious one Godhead in three
admirable subsistences comes under no acts of the free will and sovereign
counsels of God, the Godhead being most absolutely and essentially necessary.
But we should have wanted for eternity, the mysterious Emanuel, the beloved,
the white and ruddie, the chief among ten thousands Christ, God-man, the
Savior of sinners: for no sick sinners and no saving soule-physitian of
sinners, no captive no Redeemer, no slave of hell no lovely ransome-payer of
heaven. 2. There should have been no Gospel, no actual redemption on earth, no
Gospel-song of Ransomed ones in heaven, Worthy is the Lamb, etc. Had sin
never been, there had never been one whisper nor voice in heaven of a Lamb
sacrificed and slain for sinners, there had been no Gospel-tune of the
now-eternall song of free grace in heaven; there had been silence in that
blessed Assembly of the first borne of any Psalm, but of Law-musicke; men
obeyed a Law without being in debt to the grace of a Mediator, and therefore
they live eternally. 3. Grace, free grace, should never have come out on the
stage, as visible to the eye of Men and Angels. 4. If sin had never broken in
on the world, the Guests of free grace that now are before the throne, and once
were foul and uggly sinners on earth, Mary Magdalene with her seven Devils,
Paul with his hands once hot and smoking with the blood of the Saints, and his
heart sick with malice, and blasphemy against Christ and his followers, and
the rest of the now-whit and washen ones, whose robes are made fair in the
blood of the Lamb, and all the numerous millions which none can number, whose
heads now are warmed, in that best of lands, with a free crown, and are but
bits of free grace, should not have been in heaven at all, as the freeholders
and tenants of the exalted Redeemer, the man Jesus Christ; there had not been
one tenent of pardoning mercy in heaven. But O what depth of unsearchable
wisdom to contrive that lovely plot of free grace, and that, that River and
Sea of boundless love should run through, and within the banks of so muddy,
Inkie, and polluted a channel as the transgressions and sins of the Sons
of Adam, and then that on the sides and borders of that deep River should grow
green, budding, and blooming for evermore such Roses and Paradice-Lilies
smelling out heaven to Men and Angels, as pardoning mercy to sinners, free and
rich grace to traitors to the crown of heaven, the God-love of Christ Jesus to
man. Come warm your hearts all intellectual capacities, at this fire; O come
ye all created faculties, and smell the precious ointments of Christ, O come
sit down under his shadow, taste and eat the apples of life. O that Angels
would come, and generations of men, and wonder, admire, adore, fall down before
the unsearchable wisdom of this Gospel-art of the unsearchable riches of Christ.

13. If then love, and so deep Gospel-love be despised, broken men sleighting
surety-love, and marriage-love, and then dying in such a debt as trampled on
Covenant-love, bloud-love must be areasted with the saddest charge of
Gospel-vengeance. I would have saved you, and ye would not be saved, coming
from the mouth of Christ must be a seal to all the curses of the Law and a
vengeance of eternal fire beyond them* But we either, in these sad times, will
have the grace of Christ a Cipher, and yet to do all things, which is the
Antinomians wanton licentiousness, or free will to do all things, and grace
to do nothing, but that nature should be the umpire, and Sovereign, and grace
the servant and vassell, which is the Arminians pride for fear they be
beholden to Jesus Christ, and hold heaven on a writing of too free grace; sure,
the Gospel goes a middle way, and the difference of Devils white or black
should not delude us, for both are black, and tend to the blackness of
darkness; and shift the soul of Christ, and break up a new North-west way to
heaven, that our guide to glory may not be the Captain of our salvation, who
brings many children to glory, but either loose license without Law, or lordly
pride without Gospel Grace. Now the very God of peace establish us in his
truth, and in such a thorny wood of false Christ's, and false Teachers, give us
the morning star, and his conduct to glory, who knows the way, and is the way,
the truth, and the life.

Yours in the Lord Jesus, S. R.

lovely. 9. Christ in soule-trouble, and yet the union not dissolved. 9.
Familists teach that Christ is incarnate in believers. 10. Christ suffered in
his soul kindly, and not by concomitancie only. 11. Christ's precious soul
liable to suffering. 11. We are to bear death patiently, seeing Christ dyed.
12. No wonder all things be liable to change, since Christ was in
soule-trouble. 12.13. What love in Christ's undertaking for us. 13. Christ cast
up his accounts, and saw what he was to give out, and what to get in, in his
suffering for us. 14 Loves way of saving man. 14 Our softness and
selfe-wisdome in suffering. 15.16 Our mis-judging of God under the cross. 16
Our coldness of love to Christ. 17 Evangelick love is more then Law-love 18
Sins against love are wounding, 18 What a soul troubled for sin is. 19
Christ's being over-clowded, incomparably the greatest soule-trouble that ever
was. 19 Christ was to bleed for sin, as sin. 21 According to the fullness
of the presence of the Godhead, so heavy was Christ's love. 21 Antinomians
errors touching the nature of sin. 23 Antinomian errors touching doubtings,
sorrow for sin, confession, etc. 23.24 D. Crisps Libertinisme that Paul Romans
7. personateth the person of a scrupulous man, and had no real cause to sorrow
for, fear, or confess sin. 24.25 M. Archer in the like error. 25.26
Trouble of unbelief for sin is sinful 26 Some fits of the ague of the
Spirit of bondage, may recurre and trouble a believer. 26.27 Loves-Jelousies
and doubting argue faith. 27 Doubting may consist with faith. 27 Dangerous and
unsound positions of Antinomians, touching trouble for sin in the justified.
28 Doubtings proves not a soul to be under a covenant of works. 29 The Jews
under the Old Testament justified, might be troubled in soul for sin as we,
they and we justified by the same grace. 29 Trouble for sin is, and ought to
be in those, who are delivered from obligation to eternal wrath. 30.31 No
Law-wakening in us by nature. 32 How the Saints need joy after sin, rather then
after affliction. 33 Sin is pardoned otherwise then in removal of obligation
to eternal wrath. 34 The double dealing of Antinomian Preachers in confession
of sins, in public, their confession being only in regard of unbeleevers
mixed with believers. 34 A two fold pardon of sin. 1. A relaxation from
eternal. 2. From temporal wrath. 35 Sin is sometimes put for temporary
punishment, and to remove temporary punishment is to pardon sin in
Scripture-sense. 36 Soule-troubles in devils and men must be extreme. 38
Conscience the sorest enemy. 38 The terrors of an evil conscience. 38
Difference between the soule-torment of the damned, and the Saints, in 3.
points. 39 God punishes sometimes the sins of his children with spiritual
punishments. 40 Christ's soule-trouble different from ours. 43 The causes of
soul desertions. 43.44.45 Soul desertions sharpened with sense 44 Desertions
after evident and full manifestations of God. 44.45 Desertion under a
threefold consideration. 46 Patience requisite under soule-trouble. 46 We are
not so freed from sin, being justified, but there is a ground of distance
between the Lord and us. 46.47 Mis-judging thoughts of Christ in us by nature.
47 Sin not ever the cause of desertion. 47.48 External heavy judgments, and
soule-desertions not Pedagogicall, but common to the Saints under the N. Test.
48.49 Active desertion is not our sin, but the Lords trying of us. 49
Desertions more proper to the Saints, then to the unregenerat. 49 Christ's
desertion of another nature then ours. 49 Desertion not melancholy. 50 The
various dispensation of God in leading souls to heaven. 51 Diverse causes of
desertion. 51 Continuated manifestations of Christ necessary. 51.52 Diverse
reasons why we are not to quarrel with Divine dispensation in desertion. 52
Gods manifestations his own, and most free. 52 Submission and charity required
to Gods dispensations. 52 Apprehensions biggest and most terrible in desertion,
because of the darkness of the mind. 53 Satan can raise our apprehensions
to swelling thoughts of Gods dispensation, as too greevous to be borne. 54 Our
love is sweyed with jealousies and mis-giving. 54.55 Divine dispensation, not
our rule. 55 Unbelief is querulous: mis-beleeving of our state too frequent in
desertion, but more of Christ. 56 Mis-judging of our actions frequent in
desertion. 56.57 Antinomians mistake touching anxiety for sin. 57 We may long
for Christ absent, but not mis-judge him. 57.58 Diverse considerable reasons of
Christ's absence. 58.59 Mis-judging argues softness of nature, and weakness
of judgment. 59.60 Saints must look for a growing cross. 60 A growing faith
for growing crosses. 61 Anxitie in Christ. 61, 62 A sinnelesse oblivion in
Christ. 62 How Christ's sensitive affection are under a Law. 62 Christ's loss
great. 62 The personal union hindered not the operations of sinnelesse humane
infirmities. 62 Christ's anxiety sinnelesse. 63 No mistake in Christ's soul
deserted. 63 Christ's desertion real. 63 Judicial mispending of our
affections. 64 How Christ was forsaken. 64 The sinner shiftlesse in judgment.
64.65 No hypocrites formally in hell, and at the last judgment. 65 A wakened
conscience speechless. 65.66 Three demands of justice given in against Christ.
66 Help nearer in trouble, then we apprehend. 67 Christ made use of Faith in
trouble, for our cause. 68 Christ's death-gripe. 69 Doubtings for want of
qualifications, how cured. 69.70 Two false ways of curing doubting, whether
the soul be in Christ, or not. 70 To argue no faith from faint performances
of duties is unjust reasoning. 70 How far we may argue no faith from sinful
walking. 71 Antinomians doubts touching the spiritual estate of the soul,
discussed and disproved. 72 The immutabilitie of Gods love no ground, but
multitudes may doubt whether they be in Christ, or not. 72.73 Saltmarsh
examined in this point. 72.73* 74.75 A necessity of inherent signs and
qualifications to doubting souls. 73.74 How God loves his Son Christ, and
believers with the same love. 74 How far Sanctification may evidence that a
soul is in Christ. 76 From no sanctification we may conclude no justification.
77 Protestants make mortification and repentance some other thing then faith.
77 Regeneration and justification not one. 78 No assurance can flow from acts
performed by our good nature. 78 Antinomian Mortification a delusion. 79 How we
see forgiveness in our selves. 79 Antinomians deny all inherent holiness in
us. 80 How we are to see grace in our selves. 80 Nothingnesse in our selves
highteneth the price of Christ. 81 How Ministers are to deal with troubled
souls 82 Christ more to be chosen then the comforts of Christ. 82 Under
soule-trouble we are to do, but not to conside in what we do. 83
Love-jealousies under desertion. 84 Desertions have a time. 84 Christ
r^compences his absence with double smiling. 84 Works of sanctification though
polluted with sin, may bottom assurance. 85 We do not all times know that
we believe. 85.86 There is need of actual influence of grace to the reflect
knowledge of our spiritual state. 86 The witnessing of sanctification sometime
dark. 86 Duties performed in faith not contrary to grace. 87 Hard to be
comforted in desertion. 87 Sense of Christ's absence cannot be out-reasoned.
88.89 All in glory short of what they owe. 90 God cannot be quarrelled in
desertion. 90 We cannot bear fullness of glory in this life. 90 Longing after
Christ strongest in absence. 91 The languishing soul may pray home Christ. 92
Christ's love not Lordly. 92 The Lords return after sad desertion joyful.
92.93 How near Christ is in desertion. 93 Christ pardons and rarely
punishes love-errours. 94 Its a lie that none are to question their faith. as
Saltmarsh says. 94 We are to believe after Christ's fashion, not our own. 95
Saints may doubt whether they believe or no. 96 Doubting in believers proves
them not to be under the Law. 97 Sanctification of it self, is an infallible
sign of justification, but not ever so to us. 98 How acts of sanctication make
good that we believe. 99 Assurance may flow from other marks then the immediate
testimony of the Spirit. 99.100 The inward testimony of the Spirit. 100 The
Holy Ghost speaks by marks. 100 How Antinomians compare evidences of marks
and of faith together. 101 Degrees of freedom of grace. 101.102 Antinomians
denying preparation must be Pelagians. 102 The broad Seal of the Spirit
excludes not all doubting. 102 Doubting of the truth of Faith, is that
unbelief that excludes us out of our heavenly rest. 104 That we may know
justification by sanctification, proved. 105 Works done in faith are not
doubtsome evidences of justification. 106 Works may prove faith, and faith
Works. 107 How sanctification does prove justification. 108 Peace from
justification, and from sanctification, how different. 110 To be assured of
righteousness, and know that we are in that state, two different things.
111.112 M. Cornwel proves what is not in question. 112 Many things ours both
by debt of promise, and by grace. 112.113 Conditional Gospel-promises argue
free grace, not debt. 113 Gospel-promises made to acts of sanctification.
116.117 Antinomians deny all conditional promises. 117 What kind of faith was
in Christ. 117.118 How faith of Dependence was in Christ. 118 The not seeing of
God may stand with personal union. 118 A rare providence that Christ is put to
( God save me.) 119 We are not to storm that we are not heard at first. 120
Reasons why our prayers are not ever heard at first. 120 We are readier to
pray, then to praise. 121 Christ bottomed his prayer on the sweet relation of a
Father and a Son. 121.122 Sons only can pray. ibid. The power of Prayer.
123.124 Christ's houre-sufferings. 125 He suffered in value what we should have
suffered. ibid. Whence comes the dignity of Christ's suffering. 126 Christ's
loss great from his excellency. 127 How Christ's sufferings were bounded, being
infinite. ibid. Our debt of love to Christ eternal. 128 Our sufferings short.
ibid. We are not too weary for length of time in sufferings. 130.131 Christ's
death sour and black to nature and Christ, and why. 131.132 Christ sensible
of pain and death. ibid. Gods anger against Christ. ibid. The personal union
not dissolved in suffering. 133 Christ bare the whole Cross, and we but chips
of it. 134 Souls of great value with God, not so with us. 135.136 Strength of
Christ's love. 137 Death sweetened in Christ. ibid. Christ's will subordinate to
Gods; doubts removed. 138.1^9 Gods revealed will, not his decree our rule.
ibid. A conditional desire, though not agreeable to a positive Law, no sin.
140 Rules touching our submission to Gods will. 141 Nine considerable
objections, comfortably answered. 142.143.144.145 Thirteen considerable Rules
touching submission to Providence. 144.145.146.147.148.149.150.151, etc. Gods

man's measure. ibid. The Royal prerogative of providence. 152.153 It cannot be
counter-wrought. 154.155 We dote much on the sweet accidents of Christ, and
love himself too little. 155.156 Submission to the absence of God. 156.157
Christ's return no merit. ibid. The work of Redemption rational, and full of
causes and reasons. 158 Afflictions are to be weighed. 1. Who. 2. How. 3. For
what end. 159.160 Blind and dumb Crosses. ibid. Christ willing to suffer.

was glorified in Christ. 177.178 Omnipotency makes glory of any thing. 178.179
Man's glory vain. 199. The Gospel dark to us. 180 Our understanding,
affections, and heart, heretical in Gods will, word, and works. 181.182.183
Sin and error broody, truth but one. 184 Angels kept fast their birthright.

264.^65, etc. What conditions we reject, and we admit in the Gospel.
261.262.263 Obedience in the Law and Gospel the same, and how. 263.264 How

Arguments for indecl^^^ble and irresistible conversion pressed, 314.315, 316,
317, 318, 319. How loggish we are to be drawn to Christ. 319.320 Antinomians
reject Sanctification, 321 Will have us in this life completely saved, and
seem to deny with Familists, the life to come, and the resurrection. 32^.323,
3^4 Free will not forced. 326 Arminian indifferency of will refused. 326.327

living and loving in Christ. 360, 361, 362 The State of the question touching
universal atonement. 365, 366 The place, Romans 10.18. Have they not heard,
etc. discussed. 365 366, 367 Of universal grace. 368 Of Arminian election.
368, 369 Arminians go upon six universalities. 369, 370, 371 Universal, 1.
Will of God to save all. 2. Universal Redemption. 3. Covenant. 4.
Reconciliation. 5. Vocation. 6. Possible Apostasy of all. 370, 371 The Elect
particularly designed by persons, names, etc. 371 372, 373 Election and
Redemption of the same Sphere. 375 M* Moors and the Arminian opinion of
universal Redemption. 375, 376 The Arminian distinction of Redemption
purchased to all, possibly applied to none, examined. 376, 377, ^78 Moors
distinction of a reconciliation of all with God, and all to themselves, vain.
379 380, 381, 382, etc. 1 Pet. 2.21. Isai. 53.6. The Lord laid on him the
iniquity of us all, explaned and vindicated. 379* 380 1 Cor. 5.14.15. proves
no universal reconciliation. 381 Nor 1 Timothy 2.4.6. 381, 382, 383, 384* 385
Moors frivolous reasons answered. 385, 386, 387, 388, 389 Joh. 1.29. Behold
the Lamb of God, etc. vindicated. 389.390, 391 The Arminian condition of
preaching the Gospel not revealed to thousands, and so cannot oblige. 392, 393
Christ's dominion not a naked power to save, such as may consist with the
damnation of all. 393, 394, 395, etc. Proved by fifteen Arguments, to 399
There is as good ground in Scripture for the universal conversion and
salvation of all, and every one, as for the unive^sall redemption of all and
every one. 400, 401* 402 M. Den the Arminian and Antinomian answered, 40^,
405, 406, etc. The place of Joh. 3.16. God so loved the world, etc. v^ndicated
and opened. 409* 410 All Redeemed from wrath, redeemed from iniquity, 412, 413
Christ purchased faith to us by his death. 413.414 Other Arguments to prove
that Christ dyed not for all, and every one. 413, 414, 415, 416 What is never
done, is not Gods will simply. ibid. What the revealed will of God is. ibid.
All arguments from Gods will, love, mercy etc. against particular election and
redemption, with equal strength of reason, conclude against Arminians. 416*
417, 418 Gods revealed will expresses not to us his decree, intention, and
purpose that the thing be, but his approbation or hatred of it, be it, or be it
not. 418, 419 The word World proves nothing against us; the place Joh. 3.16.
again considered. 419, 420, 421 An elect World in Scripture. 422 5. Rules to
expound the particle All, (...), 422, 423, 424, 425 2 Pet. 3.9. The Lord will
have none to perish, etc. vindicated. 428 God wills not all and every one to
be saved. 4^8.429 The common nature of man assumed by Christ proves no more,
he redeemed all, and every one, then that all, and every one sits in that
nature with him on his throne. 430, 431 Hebr 2.9. He tasted death for every
man, vindicated, 4^1, 432 The place Romans 5. By one man's offense, etc. is for
particular, not for universal redemption. 432, 433, 434, 435 And 1 Cor. 15.
435, 436 The place 1 John 2.1. cleared for us. 436, 437, 438 And 2 Pet. 2.1.
ibid. And 1 Timothy 4.10. ibid. Christ has a serious good will to draw sinners to
himself. 438, 439 Four objections of weak ones answered. The Gospel framed
in the wisdom of God, that none might despair to open a door of faith. 1. To
believers. 2. To sinners. 3. To visible Saints. 4. To men. 5. To all. 6. To
that which is most comprehensive, the World. 440, 441, 442, 443 Christ sorry
that we come not ibid. What Gods revealed will is. 443, 444 Any will to save
all contrary to Gods nature and attributes. 444 445 Christ willing to draw all,
heart-exceptions removed. 446, 447, 448, 449 Ezech. 33.10. explained. 447, 448
Prove. 8.30. Ancient love explained. ibid. What sort of faith God requires of
all and every one, that hear the Gospel; Antinomians dream of a faith which
is the apprehension of the eternal love of election. 449, 450 451 This faith
has for its object a lie, that God has chosen all and every man to glory, a
lie, and is no faith. 451, 452 The faithfulness and mercy of a Gospel-Saviour;
the objects of saving faith. ibid. Arminians lay double dealing on God. 417 Its
a mystery, that God obliges all in the visible Church to rest on Christ as a
Savior, though salvation be not purchased to all. 417, 418 The Gospel
reveals not Gods decree and intention, whom he purposes to save or damn.
418, 419 How Christ dies for the world. 419 God deals sincerely with all,
whom he commands to believe. 419, 420 Gods wise framing of Gospel-invitations
without any man's name in particular. 420, 421 The sufficiency of power in
Christ to save, the object of that faith, for the want of which reprobates are
damned. 421, 422 The object of fiduciall resting on Christ. 423 Objections of
weak ones against their grounds of believing removed. 423, 424, 425 The
Arminian Argument against particular Redemption taken from hope, assurance,
con^ol^tion, propounded in all its strength, Answered, and retorted on
themselves 424, 425, 426, 427 Universal Redemption furnishes no grounds of
assurance and consolation, but such as may stand with the reprobation and
damnation of all. 425.426 M. Moore suggesteth hope and the Gospel-comforts of
the Spirit of Jesus Christ to Indians, Americans, Turks. ibid. Arminians render
God pendulous and doubtsome 426 Frustrated in his hope and ends. 427.428 Faith
the first morning and dawning of election. ibid. The Arminian hope and comfort,
and their wild Divinity not in Scripture. 428.429.430 The Lords general good
will to save all, and every one, comfortless. 432.433 The fountain good will
of God separateth elected persons, from others. 4^2.433 Arminians resolve all
in man's will and merits. 434.435 Paul^s outcry* O the depth, opened. 435.436
Only free grace, not freewill, makes one to differ from another. 437.438 The
abundance of grace. 439 440 All love, especially a three fold, effectual in
God, no lip love in him. 440 441 Christ's love cannot mis-carry. ibid. Very
active. 442 Ten objections from fear of Reprobation and sin, that se^ me to
hinder believing, removed. 4^3.^44.445 Christ can draw as guilty, as thou art.
447.448 The person to whom we are drawn most considerable from several
excellencies in him. 449.450.451.452 Christ a home and rest. 451 Three parts of
Christ's compleatnesse; 1. His fullness. 453 2. His primacy. 453.454 3. His
excellency. 454.455.456
Resisting of Christ a high sin. 457 Christ good at drawing of sinners. ibid.
458.459 Resisting a great sin. 459.460 Marks of a mere Moralist. 461.462
Errors of Libertines touching Free will. 462.463.464 What activitie we have in
our conversion. 464 The faculties of the soul not destroyed. 464.465 Grace
inherent in us, not the person of the Holy Ghost. 464.465.466.467 The Blasphemy
of the Libertine H. Nicholas, who said, he was Godded. ibid. The union of the
Holy Ghost with the Saints, not personal. 467.468.469 Grace and Free will
joined in acting, in a fourefold sense. 468 469.470 The covenant of grace how
conditional. 471.472.473 Crispe refuted. 472.473.474 Differences between Law
and Gospel. 472 Grace in the Old Testament, and Justification the same in
Nature, with that in the New Testament. 474.47^.476 How faith is a condition of
the Covenant. 476.477 How grace acts in all Christ's Members. 479.^80 Christ
only, not any creature, Man or Angel can calm a disquieted soul. 480.481 The
Lords denial of grace falls under a threefold consideration. 481.482.483
The freedom of grace evidenced in Angels. 482 In the conversion of men.

Spirit in their up's and downs. 485.486 In what cases God us^th to withdraw.
ibid. We are to stir and blow grace our selves. 486.487 How we sin in not
doing, though actual pred^terminating grace be not in our power. 487.488.489
How we leave God, ere he leave us. 489 How we are to believe that God will
join his influence of actual grace. 489.490 Grace not a Moral sparkle.

Christ's drawing. 492.493 Christ's and our leaving of the earth, and the reasons.

crucified to the World what it is. 497.498 How base the earth is to a Saint.
ibid. Antinomian Mortification fleshly, and refuted. 490.491.492 Libertines and
Antinomians compared together, from some passages of Calvine Instruct. advers.
Libertinos. 500.501.502.50^.504.505.506 Sins of the Justified, to Antinomians
no sins. 502.503 Sense and feeling of sins to Antinomians. 503.504 How a
Convert cannot fall in the same sin again. 506.507 Sorrow for sin,
habitual in the Saints, contrary to Saltmarsh. 507.508.509 Mortification not
an act of Faith. 509.510.511 Mortification personal, Physical, real, not the
Antinomian imputative and apprehensive Mortification, refuted. 509.510.511
Antinomians deny sin to be in the justified. 512.513 The fleshly distinction
of Den and other Antinomians, of sin in the conscience, and sin in the
conversation, refuted. 513.514 Mortification is in abstaining from sin, and
in the remissness and faintness of the powers of the soul to act sin.
516.517.518 To live by Faith, includes sanctification. ibid. A sinner, as a
sinner not humbled, is not to believe applicatorily. 518.519.520 Holiness and
Moral virtues much different. 520, 521 To add to Antinomian Mortification is
to add to Christ. 521.522 Eight Queries propounded to Antinomians, touching
the Law. Enthysiasmes, Gospel-commands, sins of the justified, etc. 522.523
Diverse Manifestations of Christ's deadness to the world. 524.525 The Lords
various dispensation in leading some to heaven, in flowings of free grace,
others in low desertions. 525.526 Christ strong to save. 528 Minded us much in
death. 528.529 The World a weak thing to Christ. 529.530 Christ strong on the

CHRIST DYING, AND Drawing Sinners to himself.
JOHN 12. 27. Now is my soul troubled: and what shall I say? Father, save me
from this hour: But for this cause came I unto this hour.

28. Father, glorify thy Name.


IT is a question whether these words of our Saviors Soule-trouble be nothing
but the same words and prayer which Matthew chap. 26. and Luke 22. relate, to
wit, O my Father, Opening of the words.
if it be possible, let this cup pass from me, when his soul was troubled in
the garden, in his agony: Some think them the same, others not. It is like
they are words of the same matter; for first, when Christ uttered these words,
he was near his sufferings, and on the brink of that hideous and dark sea of
his most extreme pain, and drew up against hell, and the Armies of darkness;
as the story shows. But that the Lord uttered these same words in the garden,
and not before, is not apparent; because upon this prayer it is said, Then came
there a voice from heaven, etc. A voice speaks to him from heaven: now, Mat.
26. Luke 22. no voice is like to have come from heaven; for when he prayed in
his agony, there were no people with him, as here, because of the voice the
people being present, Some said it thundered, others said, an Angel spoke from
heaven: there being now with Christ in the garden, when he prayed, O my
Father, etc. none save Peter, James, and John, the three famous witnesses of
his extreme suffering, and of his young heaven, of his transfiguration on the
Mount, when he acted the Preludium and the image and representation of heaven
before them, as is clear, Mat. 26. verse. 37. And he was removed from them
also, Mat. 26.39. Luke 22.41. and they were sleeping, in his agony, Mat.
26.40, 43, 45. But now there is a waking people with Christ, who heard this
voice. But I deny not but it is the same prayer in sense: even as suppose it
were revealed to a godly man, that he were to suffer an extreme, violent, and
painful death; and withal, some fearful soule-desertion, as an image of the
second death; it should much affright him to remember this, and he might pray
that the Lord would either save him from that sad hour, or then give him grace
with faith and courage, in the Lord, to endure it: so here; Christ, God and
man, knowing that he was to bear the terrors of the first and second death,
does act over aforehand (the time being near) the sorrow and anguish of heart
that he was to suffer in his extreme sufferings: Its good in our mind to act
our sufferings ere they come.
as it were good, ere the cross come, to act it in our mind, and take an essay
and a lift of Christ's cross, ere we bear it, to try how handsomely we would
set back and shoulders under the Lords cross. I do not intend that we are to
imitate the Martyr who put his hand in the fire, the night before he suffered,
to try how he could endure burning-quick; but that we are to lay the
supposition, what if i^ so fall out; (as Christ being persuaded his suffering
was to come, acted sorrow, trouble of soul and prayer beforehand;) and to
resolve the saddest, and antedate the cross, and say with our own hearts, Let
the worst come; or to suffer our fear to prophecy, as Job did, chap. 3. verse.
25. yet suppose the hardest befall me, I know what to do; as the unjust
Steward resolves on a way, beforehand, how to swimm^ through his necessities,
Luke 16.4. The Lord acts judgment* and what they shall pray in the time of
their extremity, who now spit at all praying and Religion; they shall be
religious in their kind, when they shall cry, Revel. 6.16. Mountains and
rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne,
and from the wrath of the Lamb. You cannot believe that a Lamb shall chase the
Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and every bondman,
and every freeman, into the dens and the rocks of the mountains, to hide
themselves. But the Lord acts wrath and judgment, before your eyes. Men will
not suppose the real story of hell. Say but with thy self, Oh! shall I weep,
and gnaw my tongue for pain, in a sea of fire and brimstone? Do but
fore-fancie, I pray you, how you shall look on it, what thoughts you will have,
what you shall do, when you shall 2 These. 1.9. be punished with everlasting
destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. 1.
Foreseen sorrows have not so sad an impression on the spirit. 2. Grace is a
well-advised and resolute thing, and has the eyes of providence to say in
possible events, What if my Scarlet embrace the Dunghill, and Providence turn
the Tables. 3. It is like wisdom (grace is wise to see afarre-off) to
fore-act faith, and resolve to lie under Gods feet, and intend humble yielding
to God; as 2 Samuel 15.25, 26.

In the Complaint we have 1. the Subject Matter of it, Parts of the Text.
The Lords troubled- soul. 2. The Time; Now, is my soul^ troubled. 3. Christ's
Anxiety wrought on him by this trouble; What shall I say? or, which is the
sense, What shall I do? 4. And a shore is seen at hand in the storm, a
present rock in the raging sea: What shall thou say? Lord Jesus, what shall
thou do? Pray: and he prays, Father, save me from this hour. 5. There is a
sort of correction, or rather a limitation; But for this cause came I to this
hour. The Lord forgetting his pain, embraces this evil hour. 6. Going on
in his resolution to embrace this sad hour, he prays, verse. 28. Father,
glorify thy Name.

Touching the first, the Soule-trouble of Christ, Five Particulars touching
Christ's soule-trouble.
we are to consider, 1. How it can consist with peace. 2. How with the
personal union. 3. What cause there was. 4. What love and mercy in Jesus to be
troubled for us. 5. What use we must make of this.

1. Pos. This holy soul thus troubled, How pure and heavenly Christ's
affections are.
was like the earth before the Fall, out of which grew roses without thorns, or
thistles, before it was cursed. Christ's anger, his sorrow, were flowers that
smelled of heaven, and not of sin: All his affections of fear, sorrow,
sadness, hope, joy, love, desire, were like a fountain of liquid and melted
silver; of which the banks, the head-spring, are all as clear from dross, as
pure Crystal: such a fountain can cast out no cl^y, no mudde, no dirt. When
his affections did rise and swell in their acts, every drop of the foun^aine
was sinlesse, perfumed and adorned with grace; so as the more you stir or
trouble a well of Rose Water, or some precious liquor, the more sweet a smell
it casts out: Or, as when a summer soft wind blows on a field of sweet Roses,
it diffuseth precious and delicious smells through the air. There is such
mudde and dregs in the bottom and banks of our affections, Our affections are
muddie.
that when our anger, sorrow, sadness, fear, does arise in their acts, our
fountain casts out sin. We cannot love, but we lust; nor fear, but we
despair; nor rejoice, but we are wanton and vain and gaudie; nor believe,
but we presume: we rest up, we breath out sin, we cast out a smell of hell,
when the wind blows on our field of weeds and thistles; our soul is all but
a plat of wild-corne, the imaginations of our heart being only evil from our
youth. O that Christ would plant some of his flowers in our soul, and bless
the soil, that they might grow kindly there, being warmed and nourished with
his grace: If grace be within, in sad pressures it comes out: A Saint is a
Saint in affliction; as an hypocrite is an hypocrite: and every man is
himself, and casts a smell like himself, when he is in the furnace. Troubled
Christ prays. Tempted Job believes, Job 19.25. The scourged Apostles rejoice,
Act. 5.41. Drowned Jonah looks to the holy Temple, Jonah 2.4.

2. Christ's affections were rational; reason starts up before fear: reason
and affection did not outrun one another. Joh. 11.33. when Christ sees his
friends weep, he weeps with them: and that which is expressed in our Text by a
Passive Verb, (...), My soul is troubled; is there expressed by an Active
Verb, He groned in the Spirit, (...), and he troubled himself: He called
upon his affections, and grace and light was Lord and Master of his
affection's. The perfection of Christ's af^^ctions..
There was in CHRIST three things which are not in us: First, The God-h^ad
personally united with a Man, and a Man's soul had an immediate influence on
his affections. This was Christ's personal privilege; and to want this, is not
our sin: to have it, was Christ's glory: But the nearer any is to God, the
more heavenly are the affections. Secondly, When God framed the humane nature
and humane soul of Christ, he created a more noble and curious piece, then
was the first Adam: It is true, he was like us in all things, except sin,
and essentially a man; but in his generation there was a cut of the art of
heaven in Christ more then in the forming of Adam, or then in the generation of
men, suppose man had never sinned; as Luke 1.35. The power of the most High
shall over-shadow thee: never man was thus to be borne. Whence give me leave to
think, that there was more of God in the humane nature of Christ, as nature is
a vessel coming out of the Potters house, then ever was in Adam, or living man;
though man had never sinned: And so, that he had a humane soul of a more
noble structure and fabric, in which the Holy Ghost, in the act of
sanctification, had a higher hand, then when Adam was created, according to the
image of God; though he was a man like us in all things, sin excepted.

3. Pos. Undeniably, Grace did so accompany Nature, that he could not fear
more then the object required. Had all the strength of men and Angels been
massed and contemperated in one, they should have been in a higher measure
troubled, then Christ was: So how much trouble was in Christ's affections, as
much there was of reason, perfumed and lustered with grace. He was not as man
in his intellectualls, wise, or desirous to be wise, (as Adam and Evah, and men
now are taken with the disease of curiosity) above what was fit: So neither
were his affections above banks; he saw the blackest and darkest hour, that
ever any saw; suppose all the sufferings of the damned, for eternity, were
before them in one sight, or came on them at once, it should annihilate all
that are now, or shall be in hell. Christ now saw, or foresaw as great
sufferings, and yet 1. believed, 2. prayed, 3. hoped, 4. was encouraged under
it, 5. suffered them to the bottom with all patience, 6. rejoiced in hope,
Psalm. 16.9. Now our affections rise and swell before reason: 1. They are often
imaginary, and are on horseback and in arms at the stirring of a straw. 2.
They want that clearness and serenity of grace that Christ had, through
habitual grace following nature from the womb. 3. We can raise our
affec^^ons, but cannot allay them: as some Magicians can raise the Devil, but
cannot conjure, or command him: or, some can make war, and cannot create
peace. It is a calumny of Papists, that say, that Calvin did teach there was
despair, or any distemper of reason in Christ; when as Calvin says, He still
believed with full assurance. And this extremity of soule-trouble was most
rational, coming from the infallible apprehension of the most pressing cause
of soule-trouble, that ever living man was under.

What peace Christ had with his soule-trouble.
4. Pos. Christ had now and always Moral peace, or the grace of peace, as
peace is opposed to culpable raging of Conscience. First, He never could want
faith, which is a serenity, quietness, and silence of the soul and assurance of
the love of God. Secondly, He could have no doubting, or sinful disturbance
of mind; because he could have no conscience of guilt, which could over-cloud
the love and tenderest favor of his Father to him. But as peace is opposed to
pain, and sense of wrath and punishment, for the guilt of our sins, so he
wanted Physical peace, and was now under penal disturbance and disquietnesse
of soul. So we see some have peace, but not pardon; as the secure sinners, 1
These. 5.3. Secondly, Some have pardon, but not peace; as David, Psalm. 38.3. who
had broken bones; and complains, verse. 8. I am feeble and sore broken, I have
roared by reason of the disquietnesse of my heart. And the troubled Church,
Psalm. 77.1, 2, 3, 4. Some have both peace and pardon; as some, like Steven,
that are so near to the Crown, as they are above any challenges of
Conscience: It Is like Satan gives over, and despaireth of these, whom he
cannot over-take, being so near the end of the race. When the sun rises
first, the beams over-gilde the tops of green mountains that look toward the
East, and the world cannot hinder the sun to rise: Some are so near heaven,
that the everlasting Sun has begun to make an everlasting day of glory on
them; the rays that come from his face that sits on the throne, so
over-goldeth the soul, that there is no possibility of clouding peace, or of
hindering daylight in the souls of such Some have neither peace nor pardon;
as those in who^e soul hell has taken fire. Christ never needed pardon, he
was able to pay all he was owing; he needed never the grace of forgiveness,
nor grace to be spared; God spared him not. God could exact no less blood of
him, then he shed; but he received an acquittance of justification, never a
pardon of grace; 1 Timothy 3.16. Justified in the Spirit.

The third Point is, How a troubled soul can stand with a personal union. Can
God, can the soul of God be troubled? A troubled soul consisted with the
personal union.

And how this must be;

And how it can be.


I shall show, first, How this must be: Secondly, How this can be. It must be,
first, Because the loss of heaven is the greatest loss. To ransom a King
requires more millions, then pence to ransom slaves. When we were cast and
forfeited, more than an hundred and forty four thousand Kings (in the Lords
decree they were Kings) were cast out of heaven: where Kings? And yet Justice
must have payment; a God-troubled Savior, and a Soule-troubled God was little
enough. Oh, says Love to infinite Justice, What will you give for me? will you
buy me? my dear children, the heirs of eternal grace? A price below the
worth of so many Kings, Justice cannot hear of; equal it must be, or more.

Secondly, Law cannot sleep satisfied with a Man's soule-trouble; for as sin
troubles an infinite Gods soul, so far God, expiate sin.

Thirdly, Heaven is not only a transcendent Jewel, dear in it self, but our
Father would propine Rebels with a Sonship What stands my Crown to God? Why
it could not possibly be dearer; The soul of God was weighed for it: that not
only freedom, but the dearest of prices might commend and cry up, above all
heaven's, Christ's love.

Fourthly, If my soul, or your souls, O redeemed of the Lord, could be valued
every one of them worth ten thousand millions of souls, and as many heavens,
they could not over-weigh the soul of God; the soul that lodges in a glorious
union with God: and the loss of heaven to the troubled soul of this noble,
and high and lofty one, though but for a time, was more, and infinitely greater
then my loss of heaven, and the loss of all the elect for eternity.

Fifthly, I love not to dispute here, but God, if we speak of his absolute
power, without respect to his free decree, could Mankind and fallen Angels with
heaven, without any satisfaction of either the sinner, God exacted not
satisfaction for sins by necessity of nature.
or his Surety; for he neither punishes sin, nor tenders heaven to Men or
Angels by necessity of nature, as the fire casts out heat, and the sun
light; but freely: only supposing that frame of providence, and decrees of
punishing, and redeeming sinners, that now is, the Lord could not but be
steaddie in his decrees; yet this is but necessity conditional, and at the
second hand. But here was the business, God, in the depth of his eternal
wisdom, did so frame and draw the design and plot of saving lost man, as
salvation was to run in no other channel, The way of grace how lovely.
but such an one, the bank whereof was the freest grace and tenderest love that
can enter in the heart of Men or Angels; for he drew the lines of our heaven
through grace, all the way.

Secondly, Grace hardly can work but by choice and voluntary Grace. Hence Grace
casts lots on Man, not fallen Angels; and the eternal lot of transcendent mercy
must fall on the bosom of Jacob, and some others, not on Esau and others. And
our Lord contrived this brave way, to out his grace on us.

Thirdly, And he would not have love to lodge for eternity Lord came under
bail, and lovely necessity, to strain himself to issue out love, in giving
his one Son (he had not another) to die for man: He framed a supernatural
providence of richest grace and love, to buy the refuse of creatures, foul
sinners, with an unparalled sampler of tender love, to give the Bloud-Royall
of heaven, the eternal Branch of the Princely and Kingly Godhead a ransom to
Justice. You sin (says the Love of loves) and I suffer: You did the wrong, I
make the mends: You sin and sing in your carnal joys, I sigh, I weep for
your joy. The fairest face that ever was, was foul with weeping for your
sinful rejoicing. It was fitting that free-love, in the bowels of Christ,
should contrive the way to heaven through free-love: we should never in
heaven, cast down our Crowns at the feet of him that sits on the throne, with
such sense and admiration, if we had come to the Crown by Law-doing, and not
by Gospel-confiding on a rich Ransom-payer. O that eternal banquet of the
honey-combe of the Love-debt of the Lamb that redeemed us, for nothing, all the
shoulders in heaven are for eternity on an act of lifting-up, and heightening
Christ's free-love, who has redeemed them, with so free a redemption; but they
are not all able, though Angels help them, to lift it up high enough: its so
weighty a Crown that is upon the head of the Prince-Redeemer, that, in a
manner, it wearies them, and they cannot over-extoll it.

Now, this must be a mystery; for though the essence of God, and more of God
then can be in a creature, were in Christ, Christ in soul-trouble an^ the union
not dissolved.
and in the most noble manner of union, which is personal; yet, as our soul
united to a vegetive body, which does grow, sleep, eat, drink, does not grow,
sleep, or eat; and, as fire is mixed or united with an hot iron, in which is
density and weight, and yet there is neither density nor weight in the fire; so
here, though the Godhead, in its fullness, was united, in a most strict union,
with a troubled and perplexed soul, and the suffering nature of man, yet is
the Godhead still free of suffering, or any penal infirmities of the soul:
The vigor and color of a fair Rose may suffer by the extreme heat of the
sun, when yet the* sweet smell does not suffer, but is rather enlarged by
exhalation: Yet is there great halting in these comparisons; because, though
the soul cannot be sick when the body is distempered, for there is nothing of
the Elementary nature, nor any contemperation of Physical humors in it,
because of a more sublime and pure constitution; yet there is such alliance and
entire society between the soul and the body, that the soul, through
concomitancie and sympathy, does suffer; as the In-dweller is put to the worse,
if the house be rainy and dropping: The soul finds smoke and leakings of
pain, in that its pinned in a lodging of sick clay, and so put to wish an hole
in the wall, or to escape out at door or window; as often our spirits are
over-swayed so with distaste of life, because of the four accidents that do
convey it, that they think the gain of life not so sweet, as it can quit the
cost. But the blessed Godhead, united to the Manhood, cannot so much as for
companies cause be sick, pained, or suffer; nor can the Godhead be weary of an
union with a troubled soul: We conceive, in the grave and death, that
glorious f^llowship was never dissolved.

Secondly, Many things may suffer by invasion of contraries; as, shoot an arrow
against a wall of brass, some impression may remain in the wall, to witness
the violence that has been there; and we know that, They shall fight against
thee, but they shall not prevail: But the blessed Godhead in Christ is
incapable of an arrow, or of repercussion; there is no action against God; he
is here not so much as a coast, a bank or bulwurke, capable of receiving one
spitting or drop of a sea-wave; only the Man Christ, the Rose of heaven, had
in his bosom, at his root, a fountain, Oh how deep and refreshing, that kept
the Flower green, under death and the grave! when it was plucked up, it was
fair, vigorous, green before the sun; and thus plucked up, and above earth,
blossomed fair!

Thirdly, Not only the influence and effects of the glorious Godhead did
water the Flower, and keep strength in Christ, (so, I think, God can keep a
damned man in the doubled torments of everlasting wrath, with strength of
grace, courage, faith, the love of Christ for ever, as he could not be
overcome by hell and devils;) but there was the fullness personal of the
Godhead, that immediately sustained the Man Christ; it was not a delegated
comfort, nor sent help, nor a message of created love, nor a borrowed flowing
of a sea of sweetness of consolation; Famulists teach that Christ is incarnate
in believers.
but God in proper person, infinite subsistence, the personality of the Son
of God bottomed all his sufferings; the Manhood was imped and stocked in the
subsistence of the tree of life. Its true, God is a present help to his Saints
in trouble; but his helping is in his operation and working; but he is not
personally united to the soul. Its abominable that some Famulists teach, Rise,
reign, of Antinom. er. 11.
that as Christ was once made flesh, so he is now first made flesh in us, ere
we be carried to perfection. Because, not any Saint on earth can be so united
personally to God, as the Son of Man; for he being made of a woman, of the
seed of David, the Son of Man, he, and not any but he, is the eternal Son of
God, God blessed for ever. The Child born to us, is the mighty God, the Father
of age, the Prince of peace, Isai. 9.6. Romans 9.5. Gal. 4.4. There is a wide
difference between him the second Adam, and all men, even the first Adam in his
perfection. 1 Cor. 15.47. If Christ suffered without dissolving of the union,
God keeping the tent of clay, and taking it to heaven with him, in a personal
union, then God can in the lowest desertion dwell in his Saints. We complain
in our soule-trouble, of Christ's departure from us, but he is not gone; our
sense is not our Bible, nor a good rule; there is an error in this Compass.

The third Particular was the Cause: What cause was there? Christ s^ffered in
his soul kindly, and not by concomitancy only.
Papists say there was no reason of Christ's soule-suffering, except for
sympathy with the body. We believe, that Christ becoming Surety for us, not
his body only, but his soul especially came under that necessity, that his
soul was in our souls stead; and so what was due to our souls for ever, our
Surety of justice behoved to suffer the same. Isai. 53.10. He Sure for our
sin. Nor must we restrict the soul to the body and temporary life, seeing he
expresses it in his own language, And now is my soul troubled.

Secondly, There was no reason of Christ's bodily sufferings, when, in the
garden, he did sweat blood for us; nor had any

Thirdly, Nor can it be more inconsistent with his blessed person, being God
and Man, and the Son of God, that he God for our sins, then that his soul
was troubled, and exceeding sorrowful, heavy to the deaths in an agony; and
that he complained, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? And the cause
of this soule-trouble was for sinners; this was Surety-suffering. The choicest
and most stately piece that ever God created, and dearest to God, Christ's
pre^ious soul liable to suffering
being the Second to God-man, was the Princely soul of Christ, it was a Kings
soul; yet death, by reason of sin, passes upon it; and not a common death,
but that which is the marrow of death; the firstborn and the strongest of
deaths, the wrath of God, the innocent pain of hell, void of despair and
hatred of God. If I had any hell on me, I should choose an innocent hell, like
Christ's: Better suffer ill a thousand times, than sin: Suffering is rather to
be chosen, than sin. It was pain, and nothing but pain: Damned men, and
reprobate devils, are not capable of a godly and innocent hell, they cannot
choose to suffer hell, and not spit on fair and spotless Justice; because
Christ's blood was to wash away sin, he could not both fully pay, and contract
debt also. But if it be so, that death finding so precious a Surety as Christ's
Princely and sinlesse soul, did make him obey the law of the Land, ere he
escaped out of that Land, what wonder that we die, who are born in the Land of
death? W^e are to bear (...) patiently, because Christ (...).
No creature but it travelleth in pain, with death in its bosom, or an
inclination to Mother-Nothing, whence it came. God only goes between the
mightiest Angel in heaven, and Nothing: All things under the Moon must be sick
of vanity and death, when the Heir of all things, coming in amongst dying
creatures, out of dispensation, by Law must dye. If the Lords soul, and the
soul of such a Lord dye and suffer wrath, then let the fair face of the
world, the heavens, look like the face of an old man, full of trembling, white
hairs, and wrinkles, Psalm. 102.26. Then let man make for his long home; let
Time it self wax old and gray-hair'd. Why should I desire to stay here, when
Christ could not but pass away?

No wonder all things be liable to change, since Christ was in soule-trouble.
And if this spotless soul that never sinned was troubled, what wonder then
many troubles be to the sinner? Our Savior, who promises soule-rest to
others, cannot have soule-rest himself: his soul is now on a wheel sore
tossed, and all the creatures are upon a wheel, and in motion; there is not a
creature since Adam sinned, sleeps sound. Weariness and motion is laid on
Moon and Sun, and all creatures on this side of the Moon. Seas ebb and flow,
and that is trouble; winds blow, rivers move heavens and stars these five
thousand years, except one time, have not had six minutes rest; living
creatures walk apace toward death; Kingdoms, Cities, are on the wheel of
changes, up, and down; Mankind run, and the disease of body-trouble, and
soule-trouble on them, they are motion-sick, going on their feet, and Kings
cannot have beds to rest in. The six days Creation has been traveling and
shouting for pain, and the Child is not born yet, Romans 8.22. This poor woman
has been groaning under the bondage of vanity, and shall not be brought to bed,
while Jesus come the second time to be Midwife to the birth. The great All of
heaven and earth, since God laid the first stone of this wide Hall, has been
groaning, and weeping, for the liberty of the sons of God, Romans 8.21. The
figure of the passing-away world, 1 Cor. 7.31. is like an old man's face, full
of wrinkles, and foul with weeping: we are waiting, when Jesus shall be
revealed from heaven, and shall come and wipe the old man's face. Every creature
here is on its feet, none of them can sit or lie. Christ's soul now is above
trouble, and rests sweetly in the bosom of God. Troubled Souls, Rejoice in
hope. Soft and childish Saints take it not well that they are not every day
feasted with Christ's love, that they lie not all the night between the
Redeemer's breasts, and are not dandled on his knee; but when the daintiest
piece of the Man Jesus, his precious soul was thus sick of soule-trouble, and
the noble and celebrious head-Heire of all, the first of his Kingly house, was
put to deep groans that pierced skies and heaven, and rent the rocks, why but
sinners should be submissive, when Christ is pleased to set children down to
walk on foot, and hide himself from them? But they forget the difference
between the Innes of clay, and the Home of glory. Our fields here are sown
with tears, grief grows in every furrow of this low-land. You shall lay
soul and head down in the bosom, and between the breasts of Jesus Christ; that
bed must be soft and delicious, its perfumed with uncreated glory. The thoughts
of all your now soule-troubles, shall be as shadows that passed away ten
thousand years ago, when Christ shall circle his glorious arm about your
head, and you rest in an infinite compass of surpassing glory; or when glory,
or ripened grace, shall be within you, and without you, above, and below, when
feet of clay shall walk upon pure surpassing glory: The street of the City was
pure gold: There is no gold there, but glory only; gold is but a shadow to all
that is there.

It were possibly no less edifying to speak a little of tho Fourth, What love
and tender mercy it was in Christ, to be so troubled in soul for us.

1. Pos. Self is precious, when free of sin, and withal selfe-happy. Christ
was both free of sin, and selfe-happy; What love is Christ's undertaking for us.
what then could have made him stir his foot out of heaven, so excellent a
Land, and come under the pain of a troubled soul, except free, strong and
vehement love, that was a bottomless river unpatient of banks? Infinite
goodness makes Love to swell without it self, Joh. 15.13. Goodness is much
moved with righteousness and innocence; but we had a bad cause, because
sinners: But goodness (for every man that has a good cause, is not a good
man) is moved with goodness: we were neither righteous, nor good; yet Christ,
though neither righteousness was in us, nor goodness, would dare to dye for
us, Romans 5.7, 8. Goodness and grace (which is goodness for no deserving) is
bold, daring, and venturous. Love, which could not flow within its own
channel, but that Christ's love might be out of measure love, and out of
measure loving, would outrun wickedness in man.

2. Pos. Had Christ seen, when he was to engage his soul in the pains of the
second death, Christ cast up his counts, and saw what he was to give out, and
what to get in, in his dying for us.
that the expense in giving out should be great, and the in-come small, and no
more then he had before, we might value his love more: But Christ had leisure
from eternity, and wisdom enough to cast up his counts, and knew what he was
to give out, and what to receive in; so he might have repented and given up
the bargain. He knew that his blood, and his one noble soul, that dwelt in a
personal union with God, was a greater sum, incomparably, then all his
redeemed ones. He should have in little, he should but gain lost sinners; he
should empty out (in a manner) a fair Godhead, and kill the Lord of glory,
and get in a black bride. But there is no lack in love; the love of Christ was
not private, nor mercenary. Christ the buyer, commended the wares ere he
bargained, Cant. 4.7. Thou art all fair, my love, there is not a spot in thee.
Christ judged he had gotten a noble prize, and made an heavens market, when
he got his Wife that he served for, in his arms, Esaias 53.11. He saw the
travel of his soul, and was satisfied: He was filled with delight, as a full
Banquetter. If that ransom he gave had been little, he would have given more.

3. Pos. It is much that nothing without Christ moved him to this engagement.
There was a sad and bloody war between divine Justice and sinners; Loves way
of saving man.
Love, Love pressed Christ to the war, to come and serve the great King, and
the State of lost Mankind, and to do it freely. This makes it two favors.
Its a conquering notion to think, that the sinners heaven bred first in Christ's
heart from eternity; and that Love, freest Love was the blossom, and the seed,
and the only contriver of our eternal glory: that free Grace drove on from
the beginning of the age of God* from everlasting, the saving plot and sweet
design of redemption of souls. This innocent and soule-rejoycing policy of
Christ's taking on him the seed of Abraham, not of Angels, and to come down in
the shape of a servant, to the land of his enemies, without a Pass, in regard
of his sufferings, speaks and cries the deep wisdom of infinite Love. Was
not this the wit of free Grace to find out such a mysterious and profound
dispensation, as that God and man personally should both do and suffer, so as
Justice should want nothing, Mercy be satisfied, Peace should kiss
righteousness, and war go on, in justice, against a sinlesse Redeemer?
Angels bowing and stooping down to behold the bottom of this depth, 1 Pet.
1.12. cannot read the perfect sense of the infinite turnings and foldings of
this mysterious love. O Love of heaven, and fairest of Beloveds, the flower of
Angels, why came thou so low down, as to be-spot and under-rate the spotless
love of all loves, with coming ^igh to black sinners? Who could have believed
that lumps of hell and sin could be capable of the warmings and sparkles of
so high and princely a Love? or that there could be place in the breast of the
High and lofty One, for forlorn and guilty clay. But we may know in whose
breast this bred; sure none but only the eternal Love and Delight of the
Father could have outed so much love: had another done it, the wonder had been
more. But of this more elsewhere.

We may hence chide our soft nature; Use 1.
the Lord Jesus his soul was troubled in our business, Our softness and
selfe-wisdome in suffering.
we start at a troubled body, at a scratch in a penny-broad of our hyde.
First, There is in nature a silent impatience, if we be not carried in a
chariot of love, in Christ's bosom, to heaven; and if we walk not upon
scarlet, and purple under our feet, we flinch and murmr.

Secondly, We would either have a silken, a soft, a perfumed Christ, or we
faint; and providence must either brew a cup of gall and wormwood mastered in
the mixing with joy and songs, else we cannot be Disciples. But Christ's Cross
did not smile on him, his Cross was a cross, and his ship sailed in blood,
and his blessed soul was sea-sick, and heavy even to death.

Thirdly, We love to sail in fresh waters, within a step to the shore, we
consider not that our Lord, though he afflict Lam. 3.33. yet he afflicts
not in sport: punishing of sin is in God a serious, grave, and real work: no
reason the cross should be a play; neither Stoics nor Christians can laugh it
over; the Cross cast a sad glowme upon Christ.

Prelates. What a sweet life, what a heaven, what a salvation is it, we have in
Christ? and we know the death, the grave, the soule-trouble of the Lord Jesus,
traveled in pain to bring forth these to us. Heaven is the more heaven, that
to Christ it was a purchase of blood. The Cross to all the Saints must have a
bloody bit, and Lions teeth, it was like it self to Christ, gallie and sour,
it must be so to us. We cannot have a Paper-crosse, except we would take on us
to make a golden providence, and put the creation in a new frame, and take the
world, and make it a great leaden vessel, melt it in the fire, and cast a new
mould of it.

Adam killed us, and buried us in two deaths, and sealed our grave in one piece
of an hour; he concluded all under wrath. Now how much of Christ is in this?
Omnipotency, infinite wisdom, (when Angels gave us over, and stood aloof at
our misery, as changed lovers) free Grace, boundless love, deepest and
richest mercy in Jesus Christ opened our graves, and raised the dead. Christ
died and rose again, and brought again from the dead all his buried brethren.

Sixthly, we can wrestle with the Almighty* as if we could discipline God can
do; Murmuring flees up against a dispensation of an infinite wisdom, because
its Gods dispensation, not our own, as if God had done the fault, Our
mis-judging of God, under the Cross.
but the murmuring man only can make amends, and right the slips of infinite
Wisdom. Why is it thus with me, Lord? (says the Wrestler.) Why do thou
mis-judge Christ? he who finds fault with what the Creator does, let him be
man or Angel, undo it, and do better himself, and carry it with him.

Seventhly, we judge God with sense, with the humor of water: Providence
halteth (say we) but what if sense and humor say, a straight line is a circle?
The world judged God in person a Samaritane, one that had a devil, if we
mis-judge his person, we may mis-judge his providence and ways. Suspend your
sense of Gods ways, while you see his ends that are under ground, and instead
of judging, wonder and adore, or then believe implicitly that the way of God is
equal, or do both, and submit, and be silent. Heart-dialogues, and
heart-speeches against God, that arises as smoke in the Chimney, are
challengings and summons against our highest Landlord, for his own house and
land.

Secondly, If Christ gave a soul for us, he had no choiser thing: the Father
had no nobler and dearer gift, Use 2.
then his only begotten son; the son had no thing dearer then himself, the
man Christ had nothing of value comparable to his soul, Our coldness of love
to Christ.
and that must run a hazard for man. The Father, the Son, the Man Christ,
gave the excellentest that was theirs, for us. In this giving and taking world,
we are hence obliged to give the best and choicest thing we have for Christ.
Should we make a table of Christ's acts of love, and free grace to us, and of
ou^ sins and acts of unthankefulnesse to him, this would be more evident; as
there was (1.) before time in the breast of Christ an eternal coal of burning
love to the sinner; this fire of heaven is everlasting, and the flames as hot
to day as ever; our coal of love to him in time, has scarce any fire or
warmenesse, all fire is hot: Oh, we cannot warm Christ with our love, but his
love to us is hotter then death, or as the flames of God: We were enemies in
our minds to him, by wicked works, Col. 1.21. Heirs of wrath by nature.
Christ began with love to us, we begin with hatred to him.

2. The Father gave his only begotten Son for us; how many Fathers, and
Elies will not let fall one tough word to all the sons and daughters they
have, for the Lord? God spared not his Son, but gave him to the death for us
all. Earthly Fathers spare, clap their Sons, Servants, Friends; Magistrates,
flattering Pastors, their people in their blasphemies for him.

3. Christ gave his soul to trouble, and to the horror of the second death
for you; consult with your heart, if you have quit one lust for him. Christ
laid aside his heaven for you; his whole heaven, his whole glory for you, and
his Fathers house; are you willing to part with an acre of earth, or house, and
inheritance for him.

4. In calling us out of the state of sin, to grace and glory; oh I must make
this sad reckoning with Jesus Christ. Oh, Christ turns his smiling face to
me, in calling, inviting, obtesting, praying, that I would be reconciled to
God, I turn my back to him; he opens his breast and heart to us, and says,
Friends, Doves, come in and dwell in the holes of this rock; and we lift our
heel against him. O what guilt is here to scratch Christ's breast? when he
wills you to come, and lay head and heart on his breast; this unkindnesse to
Christ's troubled soul, is more then sin: sin is but a transgression of the
Law. I grant it is an infinite But. But 'its a transgression of both Law and
Love, to spurn against the warm bowels of Love, to spit on grace, on
tenderness of infinite Love. The white and ruddie, the fairest of heaven,
offers to kiss Blacke-Moores on earth, they will not come near to him. 'Its
a heart of Flint and Adaman^, that spitteth at Evangelike love: Evangelicke
love it more then Law-love.
Law-Love is Love; Evangelike love is more then love, 'its the Gold, the flower
of Christ's Wheat, and of his finest Love. Cant. 5.6. I rose up to open to my
beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone, my soul passed
away when he spoke. There be two words here considerable, to prove how wounding
are sins against the love of Christ. Sins against Love are wounding.
1. My beloved has withdrawn himself; the Text is, (...) and my beloved had
turned about. Ari. Mont. circumj^rat, Pagnin. in the Margen, verterat se, the
old Version, declinaverat. Christ being unwilling to remove, and wholly go
away, he only turned aside, as Jer. 31.22. How long will thou go about,
(...) O thou backsliding daughter. This intimates so much, as Christ takes
not a direct journey to go away, and leave his own children, only he goes
a little aside from the door of the soul, to testify he would gladly, with
his soul, come in. Now what ingratitude is it to shut him violently away? 2.
My soul was gone, the old Version is, My soul melted, at his speaking (...)
my soul passed over, or went away; to remember his ravishing words, it broke
my life and made me die: (so is the word elsewhere used) that I remembered a
world of love in him, when he knocked, saying Open to me my sister, my love, my
dove; to sin against so great a bond as Grace, must be the sin of sins,
and amongst highest sins, as is clear, in these that sin against the Holy
Ghost; then it must be impossible to give Grace any thing, we but pay our debts
to grace; we cannot give the debt of Grace to Grace in the whole sum.

It cannot then be a sin intrinsecally and of it self to be troubled in
soul, if Christ was under soule-trouble, Use 3.
for sins imputed to him.

Hence let me stay a little on these two; First, what a troubled conscience is:
Secondly, what course the troubled in soul are to take in imitation of Christ.
What a Soul troubled for sin is.
A soul troubled for sin must either be a soul feared and perplexed, for
the penal displeasure, wrath, and indignation of God, or the eternal
punishment of sin, as these come under the apprehension of the evil of
punishment; or, for sin as it fails against the love of God, or for both.
In any of these three respects, it is no sin to be soule-troubled for sin,
upon these conditions: 1. That the soul be free of faithless doubting of
Gods love. Now Christ was free of this, he could not but have a fixed, entire,
and never broken confidence of his Fathers eternal love. If we have any sin
in our soule-trouble for sin, it is from unbelief, not from soule-trouble; if
their be mud and clay in the streams, it is from the banks, not from the
fountain. Or, 2. if the soul fear the ill of punishment, as the greatest
ill, and as a greater then the ill of sin, there is more passion, then sound
light in the fear, this could not be in Christ; the aversion of the Lords
heart, from the party in whom there is sin, either by real inherence, Or by
free imputation, and the in-drawing of rays, and irradiations, and
out-flowings of divine love is a high-evill in a soul that has any thing of
the nature of a son in him; now there was as much of a son in Christ, as a
man's nature could be capable of: and the more of God that was in Christ,
Christ's being overclouded incom^arably the greatest Soule-trouble that ever
wa^, be los^ng so much.
as the fullness, the boundless infinite Sea of the Godhead, overflowed
Christ over all the banks, then for Christ to be under a cloud, in regard of
the out-breathings of eternal love, was in a sort, most violent to Christ, as
if he had been torn from himself, and therefore it behoved to be an extreme
soule-trouble; Christ being deprived, in a manner* of himself, and of his
only souls substantial delight and Paradise. And this could not be a sin,
but an act of gracious Soule-sorrow, that sin and hell intervened between the
Moon and the Sun; the soul of Christ, and his Lord; the more of Heaven in
the soul, and the more of God: the want of God and of Heaven is the greater
Hell. Suppose we that the whole light in the body of the Sun were utterly
extinct, and that the Sun were turned in a body as dark as the outside of a
Caldron, that should be a greater loss, then if an half penny candle were
deprived of light. Christ had more to lose, then a world of millions of Angels;
Imagine a creature of as much Angelike capacity, as ten thousand times, ten
thousand thousand of Angels, all contemperated in one, if this glorious Angel
were filled, according to his capacity, with the highest, and most pure and
refined glory of heaven; and again were immediately stripped naked of all this
glory, and then plunged into the depth and heart of Holl, and of a lake of more
then Hells ordinary temper, of fire and brimstone; or suppose, God should add
millions of degrees of more pure and unmixed wrath and curses, this Angels
soul must be more troubled, then we can easily apprehend; yet this is but a
comparison below the thing; but the Lord Jesus in whole person, heaven in the
highest degree was carried about with him, being thrown down from the top of
so high a glory, to a sad and fearful condition, an agony, and swearing of
blood, ( God knows the cause) that shouting and tears of this low condition,
drew out that saddest complaint, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? his
loss must be incomparably more then all we can say in these shadows.

This shows the cause, why there is not among troubles any so grievous, as
the want of the presence of God, to a soul fattened, and feasted with the
continual marrow and fatness of the Lords house. No such complaints read you,
so bitter, so patheticke, and coming from deeper sense, then the want of the
sense of Christ's love. It Is broken bones, and a dried up body to David; it is
bitter weeping and crying, like the chattering of a Crane to Ezechiah; it is
more then strangling, and brings Job to pray he had been buried in the womb of
his mother, or that he had never been borne, or his mother had been always
great with him; it is swoning, and the souls departure out of the body,
sickness and death to the Spouse, Cant. 5. verse. 6.8. it is Hell and
distraction to Heman, Psalm. 88.15. It is to Jeremiah the cursing of the
Messenger that brought tidings to his Father, that a man-child was borne, and a
wishing that he never had being, nor life; it is death to part the lover from
the beloved, and the stronger love be, the death is the more death.

But in all that we yet have said, Christ was to bleed for sin, as sin.
Christ's greatest Soul trouble as a Son (for that he was essentially) was in
that his holy soul was sadded and made h^avie even to death, for sin, as
sin, and as contrary to his Fathers love. The Elect sinned against the Lord,
not looking to him, as either Lord, or Father: but Christ paid full dear for
sin; eying God as Lord, as Father. We look neither to Lord, to Law, nor to
Love, when we sin; Christ looked to all three, when he satisfied for sin.
Christ did more then pay our debts; it was a sum above price that he gave for
us; it is a great question, yea out of all question, if all mankind redeemed
came near to the worth, to the goodly price given for us.

So according to the sense of any happiness, According to the fullness of the
presence of the Godhead, so heavy was Christ's loss under desertion.
so must the Soule-trouble for the loss of that happiness be, in due
proportion. First, as we love, so is sorrow for the loss of what we love.
Jaakob would not have mourned so, for the loss of a servant, as of his Son
Joseph. Now no man enjoying God, could have a more quick and vigorous sense of
the enjoyed Godhead, then Christ* so his apprehension and vision of God must
have been strong. 2. Because the union with the Godhead, and communion of
fullness of Grace from the womb, must add to his natural faculties, a great
edge of sense; his soul and the faculties thereof were never blunted with
sin; and the larger the vessel be, the fullness must be the greater* What,
or who, of the highest Seraphims, or Dominions, or Principalities, among
Angels, had so large and capacious a a spirit to contain the fullness of God,
as Christ had? When Salomons heart was larger the^ the sand in the Seashore;
and he was but a shadow of such a soul, as was to devil personally with the
fullness of the Godhead bodily; O how capacious and wide must the heart of the
true Solomon be? it being to contain many Seas, and Rivers of Wisdom, Love,
Joy, Goodness, Mercy, above millions of Sands, in millions of Sea-shoares.
What bowels of compassion and love, of m^^^^nesse, gentleness, of free grace
must be in him? Since all thousands of Elected souls sat in these bowels, and
were in his heart, to die and live with him, and withal, since in his heart
was the love of God in the highest. Love must make a strong impression in the
heart of Christ, and the stronger, purer, and more vigorous that Christ's
intellectuals are, the deeper his holy thoughts and pure apprehensions were,
and more steeled with fullness of Grace; his fruition, sense, joy, and love of
God, must be the more elevated above what Angels and M^n are capable off. Hence
it must follow, that Christ was plunged in an uncouth, and new world of
extreme sorrow, even to the death, when this strong love was Ecclipsed.
Imagine that for one Spring and Summer season, that all the light, heat,
motion, vigor, influence of life, should retire into the body of the Sun,
and remain there, what darkeness, deadness, whithering, should be upon
flowers, herbs, trees, mountains, valleys, beasts, birds, and all things
living and moving on the earth? Then what wonder, that Christ's Soul was
extremely troubled, his blessed Sun was now down, his Spring and Summer
gone; his Father a forsaking God, was a new World to him, and I shall not
believe that his complaint came from any error of judgment, or mistakes, or
ungrounded jealousies of the love of God: As his Father could not at any time
hate him; so neither could he at this time, actu secundo, let out the sweet
fruits of his love* the cause of the former is the nature of God, ^s the ground
of the latter is a dispensation above the capacity of the reason of Men or
Angels. We may then conclude, that Jesus Christ's Soule-trouble, as it was
rational, and extremely penal; so also it was sinneless, and innocent,
seldom have we Soule-trouble sinneless* but it i^ by accident of the way. For
our passions can hardly rise in their extremity, (except when God is their
only object) but they go over score, yet Soule-trouble intrinsecally is not a
sin.

Then to be troubled for sin, though the person be fully persuaded of pardon,
Soule-trouble for sin, is intrins^cally no sin.
is neither sin, no^ inconsistent with the state of a justified person, nor is
it any act of unbeleefe, as Antinomians falsely suppose. For (1.) To be in
soule-trouble for sin which cannot, to the perfect knowledge of the person
troubled, Jesus Christ; in whom there was no spot of sin. And Antinomians say,
Sin remaining sin essentially, must have a condemnatory power: so as its
unpossible to separate the condemnatory power of the Law, Antinomians error
touching the nature of sin
from the mandatory and commanding power of the Law. (2.) Because as to
abstain from sin as it offends against the love of God sh^wing mercy, rather
then the Law of God inflicting Antinomians imagine) no more then a sons grief
of mind for offending a tenderhearted father can infer, that this grief
does conclude this son under a condition of doubting of his state of sonship
or filiation, or a fearing he be dis-inherited. We may fear the Lord and his
goodness, Hos. 3.5. as well as we fear his eternal displeasure. (4.)
Sanctified soule-trouble is a sonlie commotion and agony of spirit, for
trampling under feet Christ's Princely head was wet with the night-raine, while
he was kept out of his own house, and suffered to lodge in the streets; and
fear that the Beloved withdraw himself, and go seek his lodging elsewhere,
as Cant. 5.4, 5. Psalm. 5.9, 10* and that the Lord cover himself with a cloud,
and return to his place, and the influence of the rays and beams of love be
suspended; are sweet expressions of filial bowels, and tenderness of love to
Christ.

Libertines imagine, Antinomians errors touching doubtings, sorrow for sin,
confession* etc.
if the hazard and fear of hell be removed, there is no more place for fear,
soule-trouble, or confession: Therefore they teach, that there is no assurance
true and right, unless it be without fear and doubting Story of the rise,
reign, and ruin of Antinomians, error 41. page 8.
. (2.) That to call in question whether God be my dear Father, after, or upon
the commission of some heinous sins, (as murder, incest, etc.) does prove a
man to be under the covenant of works Ibid er. 20. page 4
* (3.) That a man must be so far from being troubled for sin, that he must
take no notice of his sin, nor of his repentance Ib. er. 64. p. 12*
. Yea, Dr. Crisp, vol. 3. Sermon. 1. page 20, 21, 22. says, There was no cause
why Paul (Romans 7.) should fear sin, or a body of death; because in that place
Paul does (says he) personate a scrupulous spirit, and does not speak out of
his own present c^se, as it was at this time, when he speaks it; but speaks
in the person of another, yet a believer: and my reason is, Paul in respect of
his own person, what became of his sin, was already resolved, Chap. 8.1. There
is now no condemnation, etc. he knew his sins were pardoned, and that they
could not hurt him.

Answ. Observe that Arminius, as also of old, Pelagius, exponed Romans 7. de semi
regenito, of a half renewed man, in whom sense, which inclines to venial
sins, fights with reason; that so the full and perfectly renewed man might
seem to be able to keep the Law, and be free of all mortal sin. And Crisp
does here manifestly free the justified man of all sin: why? because he is
pardoned. So then there is no battle between the Flesh and the Spirit in the
justified man, by the Antinomian way to heaven, which on the Fleshes part, that
lusts against the Spirit, deserves the name of sin, or a breach of the Law:
Only its Asinus meus qui peccat, non ego; as the old Libertines in Calvin's
time said, The flesh does the sin, not the man; D. Crisp his foul
Libertinisme, that Paul Romans 7. ^^^sonateth a scrupulous conscience, and had no
real cause to confess sin, or complain of it, or fear it.
for the man is under no Law, and so cannot sin. But that Paul, Romans 7. speaks
in the person of a scrupulous and troubled conscience, not as its the common
case of all the regenerate, in whom sin dwells, is a foul and fleshly untruth.
(1.) To be carnal in part, as Verse. 14. to do which we allow not, to do
what we would not, and what we hate, to do, is the common case, not peculiar
to a troubled conscience only, but to all the Saints, Gal. 5.17. (2.) Paul
speaks not of believing, as he must do, if he speak only of a scrupulous
and doubting conscience; but he speaks of (...), of working, verse. 15.
doing, 17, 18. willing, 15, 19. not of believing only, or doubting: Now it is
not like the Apostle does personate a scrupulous soul, of whom he insinuates
no such thing. (3.) A scrupulous and troubled conscience will never yield, so
long as he is in that condition, that he does any good, or that he belongs
to God; as is clear, Psalm. 88. Psalm. 38. Psalm. 77.1, 2, 3, 4. etc. but Paul in
this case yields, he does good, hates evil, delights in the Law of the Lord
in the inner man; has a desire to do good, has a law in his mind that
resists the motions of the flesh. (4.) Yea, the Apostle then had no cause to
fear the body of sin, or to judge himself wretched; this was his unbeleefe,
and there was no ground of his fear; because he was pardoned, he knew that
he was freed from condemnation. It was then Paul's sin, and is the sinful
scrupulosity of unbeleevers to say, being once justified, Sin dwells in me,
and there is a law in my members, rebelling against the law of my mind, and
bringing me into captivity unto the law of sin; and I am carnal, and sold
under sin; and I do evil, even that which I hate; for all these are lies, and
speeches of unbeleefe: The justified man sins not, his heart is clean, he
does nothing against a law. But I well remember that our Divines, and
particularly, Chemnitius, Calvin, Beza, prove against Papists, that
concupiscence is sin after baptism, even in the regenerate; and it is called
eleven or twelve times with the name of sin, Romans c. 6. c. 7. c. 8. and they
teach that of Augustine as a truth, Inest non ut non sit, sed ut non imputetur.
So we may use all these Arguments against Libertines, to prove we are, even
being justified, such as can sin, and do transgress the Law; and therefore
ought to confess these sins, be troubled in conscience for them, complain and
sigh in our fetters, though we know that we are justified and freed from the
guilt of sin, and the obligation to eternal wrath. But sin is one thing, and
the obligation to eternal wrath is another thing: Antinomians confound them,
and so mistake grossly the nature of sin, and of the Law, and of
Justification. Some imprudently go so far on, that they teach, Mr. Archer.
That believers are to be troubled in heart for nothing that befalls them,
either in sin, or in affliction. If their meaning were, that they should not
doubtingly, and from the principle of unbeleefe call in question their once
sealed Justification, we should not oppose such a tenent; but their reasons
do conclude, That we should no more be shaken in mind with sin, then with
afflictions, and the punishments of sin; and that notwithstanding of the
highest provocation we are guilty of, we are always to rejoice, to feast on
the consolations of Christ. 1. Because trouble for sin arises from ignorance,
or unbeleefe, that believers understand not the work of God for them, in the
three Persons; the Fathers everlasting decree about them; the Sons union with
them, and headship to them, his merits, and intercession; the holy Spirits
inhabitation in them, and his office toward them, to work all their works for
them, till he make them meet for glory. 2. Because such trouble is troublesome
to Gods heart, as a friend's trouble is to his friends; but especially, because
the Spirit of bondage never returns again to the justified, Romans 8.15. M.
Archer, Comfort for believers. page 5, 6, 7. on Joh. 14 1.
. But I crave leave to clear our Doctrine, touching soule-trouble for sin, in
the justified person.

save the elect, and the subscribed and resolved upon Act of atonement and free
redemption, in Christ, stands uncancelled and firm, being once received by
faith; the justified soul ought not so to be troubled for sin, as to mis-judge
the Lords bypast work of saving Grace. Trouble of unbeleefe for sin, i^
sinful.
1. Because the believer, once justified, is to believe remission of sins, and
a paid ransom: If now he should believe the Writs once signed, were
cancelled again, he were obliged to believe things contradictory. 2. To
believe that the Lord is changed, and off and on, in his free love and eternal
purposes, is a great slandering of the Almighty. 3. The Church Psalm. 77.
acknowledges such mis-judging of God, to be the souls infirmity, Psalm. 77.10.
I said, This is my infirmity.

Psalm. 32.3. When I kept silence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all

77.2. My sore ran in the night, and ceased not: either his hand was bedewed
with tears in the night, as the Hebrew bears; or a boil of unbeleefe broke
upon me in the night, and slacked not. Verse. 7. Will the Lord cast off for
ever? will he be merciful no more? Then faith and doubting both may as well
be in the soul, with the life of God, as health and sickness in one body, at
sundry times; and it is no argument at all of no spiritual assurance, and of a
soul under the Law or covenant of works, to doubt: as sickness argues life,
no dead poor soul cannot, in that exigence, believe, is of kin to the life of
God: the life of Jesus has infirmities, kindly to it, as some diseases are
hereditary to such a family. 2. The habit or state of unbeleefe is one thing,

soule-ship-wrack; but if it was sinful doubting, of Christ's care of them,
Master, carest thou not for us? the point is concluded, That doubting of
Christ's care and love may well infer, a soul is not utterly void of faith,
that is in a doubting condition. 4. The morning dawning of light, is light; the
first springing of the child in the belly, is a motion of life; the least
warmings Christ's breathings, is the heat of life: When the pulse of Christ new
framed in the soul moves most weakly, the new birth is not dead; the very
swonings of the love of Christ cannot be incident to a buried man. 5. When
Christ rebukes little faith and doubting, he supposes faith: he who is but
a Christ, is not drowned as yet. 6. The Disciples prayer, Lord increase our
faith; Christ's praying that be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
might, prove, the Saints faith may be at a stand, and may stagger and slide. 7.
The various condition of the Saints; now its full moon, again no moon light at
all, but a dark eclipse; Jesus Christ's mouth, and of sad absence, runs
through the Song of Solomon, the book of the Psalms, the book of Job, as
threeds through a web of silk, and veins that are the strings and spouts
carrying blood through all the body, less or more.

Asser. 3. The justified soul once pardoned, receives never the Spirit of
bondage, Romans 8.15. to fear again, eternal wrath; that is, This Spirit in
the intension of the habit, such as was at the first conversion, when there was
not a grain of faith; does never return, nor is it consistent with the Spirit
of Adoption. Yet happily it may be a question, if a convert brought in with
much sweetness, and quietness of Spirit, shall fall in some heinous sin,
like the adultery and murder of D^vid, have not greater vexation of Spirit,
then at his first conversion, but more supernatural.

Dangerous and unsound positions of Antinomians touching trouble for sin in
the justified


of that way, says in a dangerous medicine for wounded souls. Where there is
no Law, (as there is none in, or over the justified soul) there is no
transgression, and where there is no transgression, there is no trouble for
sin, all trouble arising from the obligement of the Law, which demands a
satisfaction of the soul, for the breach of it, and such satisfaction as the
soul knows it cannot give, and thereby remains unquiet; like a debtor that
has nothing to pay, and the Law too, being naturally in the soul, as the
Apostle says, The Conscience accusing, or else excusing. It is no marvel,
that such souls should be troubled for sin, and unpacified, the Law having
such a party, and engagement already within them; which holding an agreement
with the Law, in Tables and Letters of stone, must needs work strongly upon
the spirits of such as are but faintly and weakly enlightened, and are not
furnished with Gospel enough to answer the indictments, the convictions, the
terrors, the curses which the Law brings. And a third, Master Archer if he be
the Author. Sermon. Comfort for bel^evers, page 19.
And indeed, Gods people (says he) need more joys after sins, then after
afflictions, because they are more cast down by them; and therefore God uses
sins, as means by which he leads in his joys into them in this world, and
al^o in the world to come, their sins yield them great joys; Indeed, in some
respects, they shall joy-most at the last day, who have sinned least; But in
other respects, they have most joy, who have sinned most; (for sin they
little or much, they all shall enter into joy at last,) etc.

Now all this is but a turning of Faith into wantonness, whereas Faith of all
graces, moves with lowest sails; for Faith is not a lofty, and crying, but a
soft moving, and humble grace; for then David's being moved, Doubting proves
not a soul to be under a covenant of works.
and his heart smiting him at the renting of King Saul's garment, should be
under a covenant of works, and so not a man according to Gods own heart, for a
smitten heart is a troubled soul. David, Abraham; Romans 4. and all the Fathers
under the Law, were justified by the imputed righteousness of Christ,
apprehended by Faith, as we are Romans 4.23. Now it was not written for Abraham's
sake only, that it was imputed to him. Verse. 24. But for us also, etc. David
ought not to have been troubled in soul for sin, for his sins were then
pardoned; nor could the Spirit of the Lord so highly commend Josiahs
heart-melting trouble at the reading and hearing of the Law: nor Christ own
the tears and Soule-trouble of the Woman, as coming from no other spring, but
much love to Christ, because many sins were pardoned; if this Soule-trouble
for sin had argued these to be under the Law, and not in Christ; nor can it
be said, that the Saints of old were more under the Law, then now under the
Gospel, in the sense we have now in hand: that is, that we are to be less
troubled for sin then they, because our justification is more perfect, The
Jews justified, might be troubled in soul for sin, as we, they and we
justified by the same grace.
and the blood of Christ had less power to purge the Conscience, and to
satisfy the demands of the Law before it was shed, then now when it is shed:
or that more of the Law was naturally in the hearts of David, Josiah, and the
Saints of old, and so, more naturally, unbelief must be in them, then is in
us, by nature, under Gospel manifestations of Christ. Indeed, the Law was a
severer Pedagogue to awe the Saints, then in regard of the outward dispensation
of Ceremonies, and Legal strictness; keeping men as malefactors in close
prison, till Christ should come. But imputation of Christ's righteousness, and
blessedness in the pardon of sin, and so freedom from Soule-trouble for
eternal wrath; and the Laws demanding the Conscience to pay, what debts none
were able to pay, but the Surety only, was one, and the same to them, and to
us; as Psalm. 32.1, 2. compared with Romans 4* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and Psalm. 14.
with Romans 3.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.19.20. and Genesis 17.9. cap. 22.18. Deuteronomy.
27.26. with Gal. 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Heb. 6.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
Who dare say, that the believing Jews, dyed under the curse of the Law, Deuteronomy.
27.26? For so they must perish eternally. Gal. 3.10. For as many as are of the
works of the Law, are under the curse: Then there must be none redeemed under
the Old Testament, nor any justified, contrary to express Scriptures, Psalm.
32.1, ^. Romans 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Gal. 3.14. Act. 15.11. Acts 11.16, 17. Romans
10.1, 2, 3. Now Acts 15.11. We believe that through the grace of the Lord
Jesus, we shall be saved as well as they. And as they were blessed, in that
their transgression was forgiven, and their sin covered, and that the Lord
imputed no iniquity to them, Psalm. 32.1, 2. our blessedness is the same, Romans
4.6, 7, 8. and Christ as he was made a curse for them, so for us; that Gal.
3.14. the blessing of Abraham might come on us the Gentiles, through Jesus
Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit, through faith: And God
sent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law; for the Jews who as
heirs were under Tutors, as we are under the Moral Law by nature, that we
might be redeemed by him, That we, who are under the Law, might receive the
adoption of Sons, Gal. 4.1, 2, 3, 4. And God gave the like gift to the
Gentiles, that he gave to the Jews, even repentance unto life, Acts 11.16, 17.
Then the Law could crave them no harder then us; and they were no more
justi^ied by works, then we are, Yea following righteousness, they attained it
not, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the
Law; for they stumbled at the stumbling stone, that was laid in Sion, Romans
9.31, 32, 33. And they being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about
to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the
righteousness of God, Trouble f^r sin is, and ought to be in these, who are
delivered from obligation to eternal wrath,
Romans 10.1, 2, 3. and so came short of justification by Grace, so do we. If
then to the justified Jews, There was no Law, no transgression, and so no
trouble for sin; all trouble of Conscience arising from the obligement of the
Law; as it must be, because they were freed from the curse of the Law, and
justified in Jesus Christ, by his Grace, as we are; then were they under no
smiting of heart, nor wounding of Conscience more then we are; which is
manifestly false in David, and in Josiah, and many of the Saints under the Old
Testament. Hence what was sinful and unbeleeving Soule-trouble for sin to
them, must be sinful Soule-trouble to us in the same kind. The Law did urge
the Jews, harder then us, in regard of the Mosaicall burden of Ceremonies, and
bloody Sacrifices, that pointed out their guiltiness, except they should flee
to Christ; (2.) In regard of Gods dispensation of the severer punishing of
Law-transgression, and that with temporary punishments, and rewarding

upon the people, to cause them not rest on the letter of the law; but seek to
the promised Messiah, in whom only was their righteousness; as young heirs
and minors are kept under Tutors, while their Nonage expire: but (1.) Who dare
say, that the Saints under the Old Testament, who lived and dyed in the case of
remission of sins, of salvation and of peace with God, Genesis 49.18. Psalm.

Psalm. 144.14, 15. Psalm. 146.5. Job 5.17. Psalm. 84.4, 5. and dyed not under the
curse of God, or were in capacity to be delivered by Christ, after this life,
from the wrath to come, and the curse of the Law? (2.) That they were to trust
to the merit of their own works, or seek righteousness in themselves, more
then we? (3.) Or that they believed not, or that their Faith was not counted to
them for Righteousness, as it is with us? Genesis 15.5, 6. Romans 4.3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8. Psalm. 32.1, 2. (4.) Yea, they believing in the Messiah to come, were no more
under the Law, and the dominion of sin, then we are, Romans 6.6, 7, 8, 9. Romans
7.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Romans 8.1, 2. Micha 7.18, 19. Isai. 43.25. Jer. 50.20.
Psalm. 32.1, 2. but under grace, and pardoned, and saved by Faith, as we are,
Heb. 11.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Gal. 3.10, 13. Acts 11.16,
17. Romans 9.31, 32, 33. (5.) Yea, the Law was no less a Letter of condemnation
to them, then to us. Romans 8.3. Romans 10.3. Deuteronomy. 27.26. Gal. 3.10, 13. 2 Cor. 3,
7, 8.13.14, 15. (6.) They drank of the same spiritual Rock with u^, and the
Rock was Christ, 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4. Heb. 13.8. and were saved by grace, as
well as we, Acts 15.11.

2. It Is true, Josiahs tenderness of heart, David's smiting of heart, the
Woman's weeping, even to the washing of Christ's f^et with tears, Peter's weeping
bitterly for the denying of his Lord, as they were woundings, and
Gospel-affections, and commotions of love issuing from the Spirit of adoption,
of love, grace, and nothing but the Turtles love-sorrow; so it is, most false,
that they were no soul trouble for sin, as if these had been freed from all
Law of God, and these soule-commotions were not from any sense of the curse, or
the Law, or any demands of Law, to pay what justice may demand of the
selfe-condemned sinner; yet were they acts of soule-trouble for sin, as sin:
and it shall never follow, that the parties were under no transgression, and no
law, because under no obligement to eternal wrath; for such an obligation to
eternal wrath, is no chain which can tie the sons of adoption, who are washed,
justified, pardoned; and yet if the justified and pardoned say, they have no
sin, and so no reason to complain under their fetters, and sigh as captives in
prison, as Paul does, Romans 7.24. nor cause to mourn for in-dwelling of sin,
they are liars and strangers to their own heart, and do sleep in deep
security; as if sin were so fully removed both in guilt and blot, as if tears
for sin as sin should argue the mourning party to be in the condition of those
who weep in hell, or that they were no more obliged to weep; yea, by the
contrary, to exercise no such affection, but joy, comfort, and perpetuated acts
of solace and rejoicing; as if Christ had, in the threshold of glory, with his
own hand wiped all tears from their eyes already.

3. Nor see I any reason why any should affirm, That the Law is naturally as a
party in the soul, of the either regenerate Christ. (1.) For the Law's
in-dwelling, as a party engaging, by accusing and condemning, is not naturally
in any son of Adam; because there is a sleeping conscience, both dumb and
silent naturally in the soul: and if there be any challenging and accusing in
the Gentile-conscience, Romans 2. as stirring is opposed to a silent and dumb
conscience that speaks nothing, so the Law-accusing is not naturally in the
soul; a spirit above nature (I do not mean the Spirit of regeneration) must
work with the Law, else both the Law and sin lie dead in the soul: No
^aw-wakeni^gs in (...) by n^^ure.
the very law of nature lies as a dead letter, and stirs not, except some
wind blow more or less on the soul, Romans 7.8, 9. (2.) That the Law wakeneth
any sinner, and makes the drunken and mad sinner see himself to the chambers
of death, that he may but be occasioned to cast an eye on shore, on Jesus
Christ, and wish a landing on Christ, is a mercy that no man can father on
nature, or on himself. (3.) All sense of a sinful condition, to any purpose,
is a work above nature; though Christ teaches a man's soul, through the
shining of Gospel Light, to else the sinner can make but a poor and faint
advocation for himself; yet this cannot be made in the conscience without some
soule-trouble for sin. (5.) Its strange that Gods people need more joy after
sin, then after affliction; and that in some respect, How the Saints need
joy, rather after sin, then after affliction.
they have Sure, this is accidental to sin, this joy is not for sin; but its a
joy of loving much, because much is forgiven. Forgiveness is an act of free
grace, sin is no work of grace: Sin grieves the heart of God; as a friend's
trouble is trouble to a friend: the believer is made the friend of God, Joh.
15.15. and it must be cursed joy that lay in the womb of that which is most
against the heart of Christ; such as all sin is. Yea, to be more troubled in
soul for sins, then for afflictions, smells of a heart that keeps
correspondence with the heart and bowels of Christ, who wept more for
Jerusalems sins, then for his own afflictions and cross. As some ounces of
everlasting wrath in the Law, with a talent weight of free Gospel-mercy would
be contempered together to cure the sinner; so is there no rational way to
raise and heighten the price and worth of the soule-Redeemer of sinners, and
the weight of infinite love so much, as to make the sinner know how deep a hell
he was plunged in, when the bone aketh exceedingly: for that the Gospel-tongue
of the Physician Christ should lick the rotten blood of the souls wound,
speaks more then imaginable free-love. Nor do we say, that Gospel-mourning
is wrought by the Law's threatenings, then it were servile sorrow; but its
wrought by the doctrine of the Law, discovering the foulness and sinfulness
of sin, and by the doctrine of the Gospel; the Spirit of the Gospel shining on
both: Otherwise, sounds, breathings, letters of either Law or Gospel, except
the breathings of heaven shine on them and animate them, can do^ no good.

Asser. 4. Sins of youth already pardoned as touching the obligation to
eternal wrath, Sin is pardoned otherwise then in removal of obligation to
eternal wrath.
may so rise against the child of God, as he has need to ask the
forgiveness of them, as touching the removing of present wrath, sense of the
want of Gods presence, of the influence of his love, the cloud of sadness and
deadnes, through the want of the joy of the Holy Ghost, and ancient
consolations of the days of old. Psalm. 90.7. We are consumed in thy wrath,
and by thy hot displeasure we are terrified. Verse. 8. Thou have set our
iniquities before thee, and our secret sin in the light of thy face. This was
not a motion of the flesh in Moses the man of God. Antinomians may so dream,
the fury of the Lord waxed hot against his people: so says the Spirit of God:
nor is this conceit of theirs to be credited against the Text that Moses
speaks in regard of the reprobate party; Moses by immediate inspiration does
not pray for the beauty and glory of the Lord, in the sense of his love to be
manifested on a reprobate party. Antinomian Preachers in our times confess
sins in public, The double dealing of Antinomian Preachers in confessing of
sins in public, their confession being only in regard of the unbeleevers
mixed with believers.
but its the sins of the reprobate and carnal multitude, that are in the
Society mixed with the godly; they think it a work of the flesh to confess
their own sins: this is to steal the word of the Lord from his people. So
David, Psalm. 25.7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my trangressions.
The sins of his youth, as touching obligation to eternal wrath, were
pardoned, I question it not; but in regard, God was turned from him in the
flamings of love, and his sins sealed up in a bag in regard of innumerable
evils that lay on him: he prays, Verse. 16. Turn thee unto me. Hebr. Set thy
countenance on me. Gods favor in the sense of it, was turned away; and Verse.
18. Look upon mine affliction and pain, and forgive all my sins; the word
(...) with a point in the left side of (...). is to carry away. Jerome aufer,
take away all my sins Isai. 53.4. he carried, or did bear as a burden our
iniquities. Vatablus, portavit. Pagnin. parce, condona, Spare or pardon all my
sins: then sin here is pardoned only according to the present pain and
grief of body and soul that was on David, Psalm. 3^.4. For mine iniquities are
gone over mine head: as a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. We have no
reason to believe that David thought himself already a condemned man, and now
in hell, though some sparks of hell's wrath and fire, not in any sort as
satisfactory to divine justice, or as a fruit of Gods hatred and enmity, can
fall on the children of God; yet its not imaginary, but real anger. A twofold
pardon of sin: 1. a relaxing from eternal, 2. from temporary wrath.
God was really angry with Moses at the waters of strife. The thing that David
did against Vriah displeased the Lord: not in David's opinion only. And though
the hell for a time in the soul of God's children, and the hell of the
reprobate, differ in essence and nature, in that the hell of the reprobate is a
satisfactory pain, 2. and that i^ flows from the hatred of God; but the hell
of the godly not so: yet in this materially they are of the same size; that the
one as well as the other, are coals and flames of the same furnace; and
neither are imaginary. Then again, Sins of youth long-agoe pardoned, though
sometimes dearly beloved, are like the ghost of a dear friend some years ago
dead and buried, that re-appeareth to a man, as dead Samuel did to Saul; look
how loving and dear they were alive, they are now as terrible and dreadful,
when they appear to us living out from the land of death: so are sins of
youth, when they rise from the dead, and were pardoned in Christ long-agoe,
they appear again to David, and Job, and the Saints, with the veil and mask
or hew of hell, and sealed with temporary wrath. Psalm. 99.8. Thou wast a God
that pardonedst, or forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
inventions. The same word (...) is given to God, when he takes vengeance on
his enemies, Number. 31.2. Esaias 1.24. I will be avenged of mine enemies. 2 King.
9.7. That I may avenge the blood of my servants the Prophets. So is the word
(...) vengeance used, Deuteronomy. 32.43. He will render vengeance to his
adversaries. And if one and the same temporary judgment in the two Thieves
that were crucified with Christ, be so differenced, that mercy is stamped on
the same death to the one, and wrath to the other; we may well say there is a
temporary vengeance and wrath, that befalls both the Saints and the Reprobate
in this life; and the difference is in the mind and intention of God, in both.
And that God pardons sin, when he removes temporary wrath: So 2 Samuel 12.13.
Nathan says to David, The Lord also has caused thy sin to pass away, why?
Thou shall not die. This is meant of temporal death especially; as the context
clears, V. 10. The sword shall not depart from thine house. And V. 14. The
child borne to thee shall surely die. Then the Lords putting away of David's
sin, was in loosing him from the sword, in his own person, not in his house and
children; for by proportion of divine justice, (though tempered with mercy) the
Sword was punished with the Sword. I do not exclude relaxation from eternal
punishment, but remission going for relaxation of punishment. Sin is sometime
put for temporary punishment, and to remove temporary punishment is to pardon
sin, in Scripture-sense.
Then as there be two sorts of punishmen^s, one temporary, and another the
eternal wrath to come; so there are in Scripture two sorts of remissions, one
from the temporary, another from eternal punishment. Therefore sin is put for
punishment, Genesis 4.13. Mine iniquity (says Cain) is more then I can bear; or,
My punishment is more then I can bear. Levit. 24.15. He that curses his God,
shall bear his sin. Ezekiel. 23.49. And ye shall bear the sins of your
Idols. Number. 9.13. The man that is clean -- and forbeareth to eat the
Passe-over, -- that man shall bear his sin. So when God lays sin to the
charge of the sinner, in punishing it, he is said to lay a burden on the
sinner, 2 King. 9.25. And to remove this burden, is to pardon the sin. 2 Chronicles.
7.14. If my people humble themselves, then will I hear from heaven, and will
forgive their sin, and will heal their land; by removing the locusts and the
pestilence. See, the pardoning of their sin is exponed to be the removing of
the locusts and pestilence. And to call sins to remembrance, is to punish sin:
The Shunamite says, 1 King. 17.18. Art thou come to me (O man of God) to call
my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? Job complains, c. 13.26. Thou
make me to possess the iniquities of my youth. Now though out of unbeleefe
he might apprehend, that he was cast off of God, and a man rejected of God,
and that his sins were never pardoned, and he himself never delivered from
the wrath to come; these legal thoughts might keep Job in a distance from God,
to his own sinful apprehension; yet it shall be unpossible to prove, that Job
in all these complaints had no other but a mere legal esteem of Gods
dispensation; and that 2. God stamped not temporary wrath, and the pain of a
hidden and over-clouded God, the substraction of the sense of divine
manifestations of love, (the Lord standing behind the wall) in all these
afflictions. Now its known, that as these are often trialls of the faith of the
Saints, yet are they sour fruits of our fleshly indulgence to our carnal
delights, and of our not opening to our Beloved, when he knocks, Cant. 5.2,
3, 4, 5, 6. And though the godly do steadfastly believe their salvation is in a
Castle, above losing; yet in reason, sin bringing broken bones, Psalm. 51.10. a
sad cloud, the damming up of a spring of Christ's love spread abroad in the
heart, a temporary hell in the soul, it must be sorrowed for, hated, mourned
for, confessed; and yet in all these there is no necessity of such a Law-spirit
of bondage to work these, nor is faith in any sort diminished; but put to a
farther exercise. And the same sad fruits follow from the sins of the Saints
under the New Testament, as may be cleared from Revel. 2.5, 16, 22. Revel. 3.3,
17, 18. 2 Cor. 1.8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 2.7. 2 Cor. 7.5, 6, 7. Revel. 3.20. Joh.
14.1. Nor can we think, that the strictness of the Law gave those under the
Law an indulgence not to be a whit troubled in soul for sin, as it
over-clouded the influence and slowings of divine love, suppose they had
assurance of freedom from the wrath to come, as is evident in the Spouse,
Cant. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and chap. 2.16, 17. chap. 4.7. Nor is it true, that
Gospel Grace and liberty entitleth the Saints now to such wantonness of peace,
as that persons fully assured of deliverance from the curse of the Law, are
never to be troubled for sins committed in the state of free justification; nor
are they any more to mourn, nor groan under sins captivity, nor to confess
sin, in regard that Christ's blood has washed soul, and eyes, and faces from
all tears; and the salvation of the Saints in this life is not in hope only,
as wheat in the blade, but actual, as in the life to come; and therefore, holy
walking and good works can no more be means or the way to the Kingdom, (as M.
Town and other Antinomians say) then m^tion within the City can be a way to
the City, in regard the man is now in the City, before he walk at all.

Asser. 5. If Jesus Christ had soule-trouble, because of divine wrath, for our
sin, and was put to a sweat of blood, God roasting Christ quick in a furnace of
divine justice, though every blobe of sweat in the Garden was a sea of free
grace, not his eyes only, but his face and body did sweat out free love from
his soul, Luke 22.44. Heb. 5.7. what must soule-trouble be in a fired
conscience? Its no wonder that wicked men, wrestling with everlasting
vengeance, cannot endure it. The Devill's predominant sin being blasphemous
despair, Soule-trouble in devils and men must be extreme.
he tempts most to his own predominant sin; the issue and final intent of
all his temptations is despair: because Devils are living and swimming in the
sphere and element of justice, they cannot bear it; they cry to Christ, the
whole company and family making the despiting of Christ a common cause, Art
thou come hither (...), to torment us before the time? Mat. 8.29. Pro. 18.14.
The spirit of a man will bear his infirmity, the spirit is the finest metal
in the man, but a wounded spirit, who can bear that? So the Hebrew reads.
Any thing may be borne, but break the man's soul, Conscience the sorest enemy.
and break the choycest piece in the soul, the conscience, who can then
stand? As conscience is the sweetest bosome-friend of man, so it is the sorest
enemy. David is persecuted by his Prince, and he bears it; Jeremiah cast in
the dungeon by the Rulers, Priests, and Prophets, and he overcomes it; Job
persecuted by his friends, and he stands under it; Christ betrayed and
killed by his own servants and kinsmen, and he endures it; the Apostles
killed, scourged, and imprisoned by the Jews, and they rejoice in it. But
Judas is but once hunted by a Fury of hell in his own breast, and he leaps
overboard; in a sea of infinite wrath: Cain, Saul, Achitophel, cannot endure
it; Spira roareth as a Bear, and cries out, O that I were above God; though
we may hope well of his eternal state. The terrors of an evil conscience.
Nero after to his other bloods he had killed his Mother Agrippina, he could
not sleep, he did often leap out of the bed, and was terrified with the
visions of hell. Eternity, the resurrection, and the judgment to come, are
virtually in the conscience. 2. What is fear? A tormenting passion. To hang a
living man, by an untwisted thread, over a river of unmixt, pure vengeance, and
let the thread be wearing weaker and weaker, what horror and palenesse of
darkness must be on the soul? 3. What sorrow and sadness, when there is not
a shadow of comfort? But 4. positive despair, rancour, and malice against the
holy Majesty of God; when the soul shall wish, and die of burning desire, to
be above and beyond the spotless essence of the infinite Majesty of God; and
shall burn in a fire of wrath against the very existence of God, and blaspheme
the Holy One of Israel, without date. Job says of such, ( chap. 27.20.) in
this life, Terrors take hold of him as waters, and a tempest steals him away
in the night.

But consider what it is to the Saints; Job complains, chap. 14.16. Do
thou watch over my sin? V. 17. My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and
thou sewest up mine iniquity. Vatabl. Thou appearest to be a watchful observer
of mine iniquity, and addest (as Ari. Monta.) punishment to punishment, sewing
sin to sin, to make the bag greater then it is. Now though there be a
mis-judging unbeleefe in the Saints, yet it is certain God does inflict penal
desertions, as real pieces of hell, on the souls of his children, either for
trial, as in Job; or punishment of sin, as in David; whose bones were broken
for his adultery and murder, Psalm. 51.10. and whose moisture of body was
turned into the drought of summer, through the anger of God in his soul, till
the Lord brought him to the acknowledgement of his sin, and pardoned him, Psalm.
32.3, 4, 5, 6. But some will say, Can the Lord inflict spiritual punishment,
or any of hell, or the least coal of that black furnace upon the souls of his
own children? To which I answer, Its but curiosity to dispute whether the
pains of hell, and the flames and sparkles of real wrath, which I can prove
to be really inflicted on the souls of the Saints in this life, be penalties
spiritual, different in nature. Difference between the soul-torment of the
damned, and of the Saints, in 3. points.
Certain there be three characters sealed and engraven on the pains of the
damned, which are not on the real soule-punishments of divine wrath on the
souls of the Saints. As 1. What pieces of hell, or broken chips of wrath are
set on upon the souls of deserted Saints, are honied and dipped in heaven, and
sugared with eternal love. Gods heart is toward Ephraim as his dear child,
and his bowels turned within for their misery, even when he speaks against
them; Jer. 31.20, 21. But the coals of the furnace cast upon reprobates, are
dipped in the curse of God; yea so as in a small affliction, even in the
mis-carrying of a basket of bread, and the loss of one poor ox, there is a
great Law-curse, and intolerable vengeance; Deuteronomy. 27.26. Chap. 28.17, 31. And
again, in in the in-breaking of a sea and flood of hell in the soul of the
child of God, a rich heaven of a divine presence, Psalm. 22. V. 1, 89. Psalm.
18.4, 5, 6. (2.) The hellish pains inflicted on reprobates, hell on the
deserted Saints, are medicinal, or exploratory corrections, though relative to
justice and punishments of sin, yet is that justice mixed with mercy, and
exacteth no Law-payment in those afflictions. 3. Despair, and blasphemous
expostulating and God, and a silent Psalm of the praise of the glory of this
justice, in this temporary hell, no less then there is a new Song of the
praise of free grace in the eternal glory of the Saints, perfected with the
Lamb.

God punishes sometimes the sins of his children with spiritual punishments.
Nor should this seem strange, that God punishes the sins of his children with
such spiritual plagues of unbeleefe, and jealousies, and lying mis-judgings of
God in their sad desertions, more then that the Lord punished the lifted-up
heart of Hezekiah with leaving him to fall on his own weight; and David's
idleness and security, with letting him fall in adultery; and Peter's
selfe-confidence, with a foul denying of his Lord. But its a sad dispensation,
when God cleaves a Saint with a wedge of his own timber; and linketh one
sinful mis-judging of God, in this fever of soule-desertion, to another: and
justice seweth (in a permissive providence) one sin to another, to lengthen the
chain, if free Grace, a linck of Gold, did not put a period to the progress
thereof. Now we are not to look at this as an ordinary calamity: Job's
expressions are very full, chap. 6.4. For the arrows of the Almighty are
within me, The place Job 6.4. The arrows of the Almighty, etc opened.
the poison whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set
themselves in array against me. An arrow is a deadly weapon, when its shot by a
man, or by an Angel; but its soft as oil in comparison of the arrow of the
Almighty. 1. Its the arrow of (...). The Almighty did frame and mould, and whet
it in heaven. 2. The arrow was dipped in poison, and has art from hell and
divine justice. One Devil is stronger then an host of men; but legions of
Devils are mighty strong, when such Archers of hell are sent to shoot arrows
that are poisoned with the curse and bloody indignation of heaven. 3. What a
sad stroke must it be, when the arms of Omnipotency draws the bow? The arms
of God can shogge the mountains and make them tremble, and can move the
foundation of the earth out of its place, and take the globe of heaven and
earth and can cast it out of its place, more easily then a man casts a slung
stone out of his hand. When he puts forth the strength of Omnipotency
against the creature, what can the man do? 4. Every arrow is not a drinking
arrow, the arrows of divine wrath drink blood: Suppose a thousand
horse-leeches were set on a poor naked man, to drink blood at every part of
his body, and let them have power and art to suck out the marrow, the oil, the
sap of life, out of bones and joints; say also that one man had in his veins a
little sea of blood, and that they were of more then ordinary thirst and power
to drink the corpse of the living man, as dry as strawes or flax; what a pain
would this be? Yea, but it were tolerable. 5. Arrows can but drink blood;
arrows are shot against the body, the worst they can do is to drink life out
of liver and heart, and to pierce the strongest bones; but the arrows of the
Almighty are shot against spirits and souls: The spirit is a fine, subtle,
immortal thing. Isai. 31.3. The horses of Egypt are flesh, and not spirit. The
spirit is a more God-like nature, then any thing created of God. The Almighty's
arrows kill spirits, and souls: There Is an arrow that can pierce flesh,
joints, liver, heart, bones, yea but through the soul also: Never an Archer
can shoot an arrow at the soul; but this the Almighty can do. Say your arrow
killed the man, yet the soul is saved. 6. Many love not their life to death,
as the Witnesses of Jesus: Death is death, as clothed with apprehensions of
terror; no man is wretched, actu secundo, within and without, but he that
believes himself to be so: here are terrors, selfe-terrors: Jeremiah could
prophecy no harder thing against Pashur; The Lord (says he) has not called
thy name Pashur, but Magor-missa^ib. Jer. 20.3. Thou shall be a terror to thy
self. Compare this with other pains; Job would rather choose strangling, or
the dark grave; and the grave to nature is a sad, a black and dreadful house;
but a believer may get beyond the grave. What do the glorified spirits fear a
grave now; or are they afraid of a coffin, and a winding sheet, or of lodging
with the worms and corruption? or is burning quick a terror to them? No, not
any of these can run after or over-take them; and they know that. But
selfe-terrors are a hell carried about with the man in his bosom, he cannot
run from them. Oh! he lies down, and hell beddeth with him; he sleeps, and
hell and he dream together; he rises, and hell goes to the fields with him;
he goes to his garden, there is hell. Its observable, a Garden is a Paradise
by art; and Christ was as deep in the agony and wrestlings of hell for our
sins, in a garden, a place of pleasure, as on the cross, a place of torment.
The man goes to his table, O! he dare not eat, he has no right to the
creature; to eat is sin, and hell; so hell is in every dish: To live is sin,
he would feign choose strangling; every act of breathing is sin and hell. He
goes to Church, there is a dog as great as a mountain before his eye: Here be
terrors. But what, one or two terrors are not much; though too much to a soul
spoiled of all comfort. 7. The terrors of God (God is always in this sad play)
do set themselves in battle array against me. Or, Chap. 16.13. His archers
compassed me about round. Hebr. his great ones; or, his bow-men (because they
are many, or because the great ones did fight afarre-off) have besieged me. So
2 Chronicles. 17.9. 1 Samuel 7.16. Samuel went in a circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and
Mispeh. And Josh. 6.3. Ye shall besiege Jericho. The wrath of God and an army
of terrors blocked up poor Job, and stormed him. Now here be these sore
pressures on the soul, 1. The poor man cannot look out ^o any
creature-comfort, or creature-help* Say that an Angel from heaven would stand
for him, or a good conscience would plead comfort to him, it should solace him;
but the man cannot look out, nor can he look up, Psalm. 40.12. The enmity of
God is a sad thing. 2. A battle array is not of one man, but of many enemies:
Say the man had one soul, it should be his enemy; and that he had a hundred
souls, he should have a hundred enemies; but as many millions of thoughts, as
in his wearisome nights escape him, he has as many enemies; yea, as many
creatures, as many stones of the field, as many beasts, so many enemies. Job
5.23. Hos. 2.8. Christ gave to the Father Propositions of peace, and to the
poor soul under sense of wrath, they are nothing: The fear of hell is a part
of real hell to the man who knows no other thing, but that he is not
reconciled to God. Creatures behind him, and before him, heaven above, and
earth below, and creatures on every side, within and without, stand with the
weapons of heaven, and of an angry God, against him; friends, wife, servants,
acquaintance, have something of wrath and hell on them; the man in his own
thought is an outlaw to them all; and the Leader of all these Archers is God.
God, God is the chief party. See Job 19.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. And there you
see, brethren, acquaintance, kinsfolk, familiar friends, manservant,
maidservant, wife, young children, bone, skin, flesh, are all to Job as coals
of the fire of hell. And Isai. 8.21, 22. Men in this shall curse their king,
and their god.

Asser. 6. These being materially the same soule-troubles of deserted and
tempted Saints, and of plagued and cursed Reprobates, do differ formally and
essentially according to Gods heart, his dispensation and intentions, his mercy
and his justice regulating them: Christ soule-trouble different from ours
So I shall speak of the difference between Christ's troubled soul, and the
Saints trouble. 2. Of some ways of Gods dispensation, in the soule-trouble of
the Saints. Touching the former; there was in Christ's soule-trouble, 1. No
mis-judging of God; but a strong faith, in that he st^ll named God his Father,
and God. 2. In that as this trouble came to a height, and more fuel was added
to the fire of divine wrath, Luke 22.44. (...), he prayed with more extension
of body and spirit: he extended himself in fervor of praying. And, Heb. 5.7.
He offered prayers, and (...), humble supplications of the poor, or
oppressed, that make their address to one who can help them: he put in to God
an humble Petition, and a Bill to his Father, as an overwhelmed man, and he
offered this Bill, (...), with an hideous cry and tears. Revel. 14.18. The
Angel cried with a loud voice. To cry with a full and lifted up voice, or with
a shout; so is the Verb used, Joh. 18.40. When men cry. and cast away their
clothes, and cast dust in the air. 3. His soule-trouble and death was
satisfactory to divine justice, for our sins; he being free of sin himself:
which can agree to no soule-trouble of the holiest Saint on earth. But touching
the second: These Positions may speak somewhat, to clear the way of the
soule-trouble of Saints.

1. Position. Conscience, being a mass of knowledge, and if there be any oil
to give light, its here; its then likest it self, The causes of
soule-disertions.
when it most bears witness of well and ill-doing. Now, we are more in
sinning, then obeying God; and because of the corruption of nature, the number
of natural consciences that are awake to see sin, are but very few. And when
the renewed conscience is on the work of feeling and discerning guiltiness,
in its best temper, The more life the more sense: Sick ones in a swoon,
Soule-dissertions, sharpened with sense.
or dying persons that do neither hear, see, nor speak, are halfe-gate
amongst the dead. The conscience sick of over-feeling, and so under over-sense
of sin, is in so far in a fever: for often a fever is from the exsuperancy
of too much blood, and rankness of humors, the vessels being too full; and
therefore its like a river that cannot choose but go over banks, the channel
being a vessel too narrow to contain it all.

2. Pos. Therefore often the time of some extreme dissertion and soule-trouble
is, Dissertions after evident and full manifestations of God.
when Christ has been in the soul with a full, high spring-tyde of divine
manifestations of himself. And if we consider the efficient cause of
dissertion, which is Gods wise dispensation: when Paul has been in the third
heaven, on an hyperbole, a great excess of revelations, God thinks then good
to exercise him with a messenger of Satan; which by the weakness and
spiritual infirmity he was under, wanted not a dissertion, less or more,
what ever the messenger was; as it seems to be fleshly lust, after a spiritual
vision. Paul was ready to think himself an Angel, not flesh and blood; and
therefore, 2 Cor. 12.7. he says twice in one Verse, This befell me, (...),
That I should not be lifted up above ordinary Comets, up among the stars. But
if we consider the material cause, it may be, that extreme and high
overflowing of Christ's love brake our weak and narrow vessels: Cant. 5.1.
there is a rich and dainty feast of Christ, I am come into my garden, my
Sister* my Spouse, I have gathered my myrrh with my spices, I have eaten my
honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends,
drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved. Yet in that Song, the Spirit of God
speaks of a sad dissertion in the next words, I sleep, but mine heart waketh:
it is the voice of my Beloved that knocks, etc. There is not only impiety,
but want of humanity, that the Church had rather that wearied Jesus Christ
should fall down and dye in the streets, in a rainy and snowie night, when his
locks were wet with rain, then that he should come in and lodge in the soul.
And let us not think that the thread and tract of the Scriptures coherence,
one Verse following on another, as the Spirit of God has ordered them, is but
a cast of chance, or an humane thing: When the Spouse rides on the high places
of Jacob, and says, Isai. 49.13. Sing, O heaven, and be joyful, O earth, and
break forth into singing, O mountains: for God has comforted his people, and
will have mercy on his afflicted. Yet this was nothing to the afflicted people;
Verse 14. But Sion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten
me. When the Lord's Disciples, Mat. 17. are in the sweetest life that ever they
were in, at the transfiguration of Christ, when they saw his glory, and Peter
said, Master, it is good for us to be here, even then, they must appear to be
weak men; and Christ must forbid and rebuke their faithless fear, Verse. 6.
They fell on their faces, and were sore afraid. I leave it to the experience
of the godly, if Jeremiah his singing of praise in one Verse, Chap. 20.13. and
his cursing of the day that he was borne on, in the next Verse, verse. 14. the
order of Scripture being of divine inspiration, do not speak Gods dispensation
in this to be such, as to allay and temper the sweetness of the consolation of
a feast of Gods high manifestation, with a sad dissertion. So John his glorious
soule-ravishing comforts, in seeing the seven golden Candlesticks, and the
Son of man in such glory and majesty, Revel. 1.12, 13, 14, 15. Yet it
appears to be a dissertion that he is under, when Christ forbids him to
fear, and when he must have the hand of Christ laid on his head, and when he
falls down at Christ's feet as dead, V. 17.18. And when Isaiah saw the
glorious vision, Chap. 6. The Lord sitting on his throne, high and lifted up;
it must be a throne higher then the heaven of heavens, that he siteth on; and
his train filling the Temple. It Is a dissertion he falls in. verse. 5. Then
said I, woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I
dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the
King, the Lord of Hoasts; he was a pardoned man before. It Is so with us, while
the body of sin dwells in us, that we cannot, being old bottles, bear new
wine; and therefore the fullness of God, breaks crazie lumps of sinful flesh
and blood: as a full tide, is preparatorie to a low ebbing; and full vessels in
the body, to a fever. Would Christ in his fulness of the irradiations of glory,
break in upon us; he should break the bodily organs, and over-master the
souls faculties, that all the banks of the soul, should be like broken walls,
hedges, or clay channels; which the inundation of a river, has demolished, and
carried away from the bottom. Flesh and blood is not in a capacity of
over-joy, and can hold but little of heaven, no more then earth, cold bear
such a glorious creature as the Sun: we must be both more capacious, and
wider, and stronger vessels, before we be made fit to contain glory; we are
leaking, and running-out vessels, to contain grace. Manifestations, and rays
of Divine love; are too strong wine that grew up in the higher Canaan, for our
weak heads.

Desertion under a threefold consid^tions.
Asser. 3. Dissertion comes under these considerations: 1. As it is a cross,
and a punishment of sin; 2. As a trial from mere Divine Dispensation: 3. As
it is a sin on our part, full of sinful mis-representations of Christ.

In the first consideration; we are to submit to any penal over-clowding of
Christ: 1. Because the eye cannot water to look on any Cross of Christ, where
Faiths aspect goes before, and says, Though I sit in darkness, yet I shall
see light. 2. There is required a sort of patience under sin, as 'its either
a punishment of an other sin, Patience requisite under soule-trouble.
as David was submissive to the sinful railing of Shimei, and the wicked
treasons, and incestuous pollutions of his Concubines, by his son Absalom. Or
as sin dwells in us, and in Divine Dispensation must be our Cross, as well
as our sin; we are to be grieved at our sins, as they cross Gods holy
will: but as they are our own crosses, and thwart our own desires, and now
are committed by us, or dwell in us, we are not to bite at, and utter
heart-raylings against Divine providence, who might have prevented, and
efficaciously hindered these sins; and yet did not hinder them. 3. This
Dispensation should be adored, as a part of Divine wisdom; that broken souls
are not wholly cured, till they be in heaven. Sin is a disunion from God:
Jesus does not so completely soder the soul to God, We are not so freed from
sin, even being justified, but there is a ground of disunion between the Lord
and us.
but the seame has holes and gapings in it, by reason of the in-dwellings of
sin, Romans 7.17.18.19.22.23. And since Libertines will confound Justification
with Regeneration, we say, there Justification they speak off, is never
perfected in this life. And because sin, as sin which remains in our flesh,
must make God and the soul at a distance; there cannot be such perfect peace
as excudeth all soule-trouble; the blew scarre of the wound remains so, and
the dreggs of that domestic falling-ill, that we have of our first house of
Adam, are so s^ated in us, that as some diseases recurre, and some pain of the
head, when an East Wind blows; so the disease we have in our head, the first
Adam, sticks to us all our life; and when temptations blow, we find the
relicts of our disease working, and foaming out the smell of the lees, and sent
that remains. Christ has need to perfume our ill odours, with his merits, for
our begun Sanctification is so unperfect, as that yet our water smelles of the
rotten vessel, the flesh; and we cannot but have our ill hours, and our sick
days, and so a disposition to sinful dissertions. 4. Unbelief naturally
stocked in the body of sin, is humerous and ill minded to Christ: Mis-judging
thoughts of Christ in us by nature.
there is a liar in our house, and a slanderer of Christ, that upon light
occasions can raise an ill fame of Christ, That he is a hard man, and gathers
where he did not sow: that Christ is nice and dainty of his love, that he is
too fine, too excellent, and majestic to condescend to love me: and take this
as the mother-seed, of all sinful desertions, to blame Christ's sweet
inclination, to love us as well, as his love. I knew thou wast a hard man; it is
dangerous to have ill thoughts of Christ's nature, his constitution, actu primo.
The next will be to censure his ways, his saveing, and his gathering; which I
take to be the current objection of old Pelagians, and late Arminius. O, he
must gather where he did never sow, if he command all to believe under the
pain of damnation, and yet he judicially in Adam, removed all power of
believing: so he puts out the poor man's eyes, and cutteth off his two
legs, and commands him to see with no eyes, and walk with no legs, under
pain of damnation: men believe not they hate Christ by nature; and hatred has
an eye to see no color in Christ, but blackness; as the instance of the
Pharisees does clear; who saw but devilry in the fairest works of Christ, even
in his casting out of Devils.

Asser. 4. Dissertions on the Lords part, are so often mere trials; Sin not
ever the cause of desertion.
as we may not think they are greatest sinners who are most disserted.
Dissertion smells more of Heaven, and of Christ disserted for our sins,
then of any other thing; it is the disease that follows the Royal seed, and
the Kings blood; it is incident to the most heavenly spirits; Moses, David,
Heman, Asaph, Ezechiah, Job, Jeremiah, the Church, Psalm. 102. Lament. chap. 1.
chap. 2.3.4. it is oar that adhereth to the choicest gold. But how is it, say
some, that you read of so little soule-dissertion in the Apostles, and
Believers under the New Testament, and so much of it under the Old Testament?
Is it not, because it belongs to the Law and the Covenant of Works, and to
the Spirit of the Old Testament, and nothing to the Gospel of Grace? So
Antinomians dream. I answer, We read indeed of heavier and stronger external
pressures laid on men, to chase them to Christ under the Law, then under the
Gospel: Because the Gospel speaks of curses and judgment in the by;
External heavy judgments, and soule-dissertions not Pedagogicall, but common
to the Saints under the New Testament.
and the Law more kindly, and more frequently, because of our disobedience; and
of the preparing of an infant- Church, under none-age for Christ. But though
the Gospel speak less of Gods severitie in external judgments, as in
killing so many thousands, for looking into the Arc, for Idolatry; yet the
Apostle says, that these things were not merely Pedagogicall, and Jewish: so,
as because the like are not written in the New Testament, it follows not,
they belong not to us; for (says he) 1 Cor. 10.6. Now these things were our
examples verse. 11. Now all these things happened unto them for examples, and
they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
Ergo, the like for the like sins do, and may befall men under the Gospel.
Moreover, never greater plagues then were threatened, by Christ's own mouth;
never wrath to the full came upon any, in such a measure, as upon the City of
Jerusalem and the people of the Jews, for killing the Lord of glory. And
though no such dissertions, be read of in the Apostles, as of Job (who yet was
not a Jew, and yet more disserted then David, Heman, or any Prophet) Ezechiah,
the Church, Lament. Chap. 2. and 3. Yet we are not hence to believe, that there
were never such dissertions under the New Testament. For as external
judgments, so internal soule-trials, are common to both the Saints under the
Old, and New Testament: as is evident in Paul 2 Cor. 1.8, 9. 2 Cor. 5.11. 2
Cor. 7.4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. and as both were frequent under the
Old Testament, so were they written for our learning. And if it were to the
Jews merely Pedagogicall, to have terrors without, and fears within, and to
be pressed out of measure: or to afflict their souls for sin, were a work
of the law; then to be afflicted in conscience, were a denying that Christ is
come in the flesh. And simply unlawful, whereas the Lords absence is a
punishment of the Churches, not opening to Christ, Cant. 5.4, 5, 6. And Gods
act of withdrawing his lovely presence, is an act of mere free dispensation
in God, not our sin. For this would be well considered, that the Lords active
dissertion, in either not cooperating with us, Active d^ssertion is not (...)
sin, but the Lords ^^ying of us.
when we are tempted, or 2. his not calling, or the suspending of his active
pulsation and knocking at the door of our soul, or 3. the not returning of a
present comfortable answer, or 4. the withdrawing of his shining
manifestations, his comforts, and the sense of the presence of Jesus Christ,
cannot be formally our sins: indeed, our unbeleefe, our sinning which
resulteth from the Lords non-co-operating with us, when we are tempted, our
mis-judging of Christ, (as if it were a fault to him to stand behind the wall)
which are in our dissertions passive, are sins.

Asser. 5. Saddest dissertions are more incident to the godly, Dissertions more
proper to Saints then to the unregenerate.
then to the wicked and natural men; as some moth is most ordinary in
excellent timber, and a worm rather in a fair rose then in a thorn or
thistle. And sure, though unbeleefe, fears, doubtings, be more proper to
natural men, then to the Saints, yet unregenerate men are not capable of
sinful jealousies of Christ's love, nor of this unbeleefe, which is incident
to dissertion we now speak of; even as marriage jealousy falls not on the
heart of a Whore, but of a lawful Spouse. 2. According to the measure and
nature of love, so is the jealousy, and heart-suspitions for the want of the
love, whence the jealousy is occasioned: The soul which never felt the love
of Christ, can never be troubled, nor jealously displeased for the want of that
love. And because Christ had the love of God in another measure, possibly of
another nature, then any mortal man, his soule-trouble, for the want of the
sense and actual influence of that love, must be more, and of an higher, and
it may be of another nature, then can fall within the compass of our thoughts:
never man in his imagination, except the man Christ, could weigh, or take a
lift of the burden of Christ's soule-trouble. The lightest corner or bit of
Christ's satisfactory Cross, Christ's dissertion of another (...) then ours.
should be too heavy for the shoulders of Angels and Men. You may then know
how easy it is for many to stand on the shore, and censure David in the sea;
and what an oven, and how hot a fire must cause the moisture of his body turn
to the drought of summer. The Angels, Joh. 20. have but a theory and the
hearsay of a stander-by, when they say, Woman, why weepest thou? She had
slept little that night, and was up by the first glimmering of the dawning, and
sought her Savior with tears, and an heavy heart, and found nothing but an
empty grave; O they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have
laid him. And the daughters of Jerusalem stood but at the sick Spouses bed
side, and not so near when she complains, I am sick of love. To one whose
wanton reason denied the fire to be hot, another said, Put your finger in the
fire, Dissertion not me^a^choly,
and try if it be hot. Some have said, All this soule-trouble is but melancholy
and imagination: Would you try whether the body of an healthy and vigorous man,
turned as dry as chafe, or a withered halfe-burnt stick, through soule-paine,
be a cold fire, or an imagination; and what physic one of the smallest beams
of the irradiation of Christ's smiling countenance is to such a soul, you
would not speak so.

Asser. 6. Why some of the Saints are carried to Abraham's bosom, and to
heaven in Christ's bosom, and for the most, feast upon sweet manifestations
all the way, The various dispensations of God in leading souls to heaven.
and others are oftener in the hell of soule-trouble, then in any other
condition, is amongst the depths of holy Sovereignty. (1.) Some feed on honey,
and are carried in Christ's bosom to heaven; others are so quailed and kept
under water, in the floods of wrath, that their first smile of joy is when the
one foot is on the shore, and when the morning of eternities Sun dawnes in at
the window of the soul. Some sing, and live on sense all the way; others sigh,
and go in at heavens gates weeping, and Christ's first kiss of glory dryes
the tears off their face. (2.) Christ walks in a path of unsearchable liberty,
that some are in the suburbs of heaven, and feel the smell of the dainties of
the Kings higher house, ere they be in heaven; and others, children of the same
Father, passengers in the same journey, wade through hell, darkness of fears,
thrones of doubtings, have few love tokens till the marriage-day. (3.) There be
not two sundry ways to heaven; but there are (I doubt not) in the latitude of
Sovereignty, hundreds of various dispensations of God, in the same way.
Jerusalem is a great City, and has twelve, and many ports and angles and sides
to enter at; but Christ is the one only way: he keeps in all, and brings in
all; he keeps in Angels that they never came out, he brings in his many
children to glory. But some go to heaven, and till the twelfth hour know
nothing of sin, death, God, Christ, heaven and hell. Grace took a short cut,
and a compendious way with the repenting Thief. Christ cannot only run, but
fly post with some in few hours to heaven: Grace has Eagles wings to some;
and some wrestle with hell, fight with beasts, make war with lusts, and are
dipped in and out, as the oars in the river, in floods of wrath from their youth,
and a long time. Caleb and Joshua for two generations were in the Journey to
Canaan; many thousands not borne when they entered the Journey, yea new
generations arose, and entered into that good land with them, and were there as
soon as they

Asser. 7. In consideration of dissertions, as actively they come from God, and
passively they are received in us, Diverse causes of d^ssertions in diverse
respects.
and consecutively, or by abused resultance are our sins, they have sundry
and diverse causes.

1. Sorrow for the withdrawing sense and influence of Christ's love, as
formally a dissertion passive in us, is not sinful; except sorrow, which is a
luxuriant and too indulgent passion, exceed measure. For 1. Its a mark of a
soul that liv^th and breaths much on Christ's love: now, if love be the life
of some, it must be continued in sense, or some fruition of love, less or
more. Now, Continuated manifestations of Christ necessary.
as the irradiation of the sunne's beams and light in the air yesterday, or
the last year, cannot enlighten the air and earth this day; and the m^at I
did eat a year ago, the sleep I slept the last month, cannot feed and
refresh me now; but there must be a new application of new food, and new sleep:
So the irradiation of the manifested love of Christ in the years of old, must
go along with us; though as experiences of old favors, they may set faith on
foot again, when its fallen; yet the soul that lives by fruition of divine
love, must have a continuated influence of that love: and to live on divine
love, of it self, can be no sin. O its a life liable to many clouds,
over-castings of sadness and jealousies, that lives on the manifestations of
Christ's love: Its sweet and comfortable, but has mixtures of hardest trialls;
for such set on no duties comfortably, without hire in hand, as it were: when
Christ's love-letter from heaven miscarries, and is intercepted, the soul
swoons: its surer to live by faith.

2. To murmr, and impatiently to so sorrow, as if God had forgotten to be
merciful, Diverse reasons why we are not to quarrel with divine d^spensation
in dissertions.
is sinful sorrow. 1. Because the object of it is materially blasphemous, The
strength of Israel cannot lie, nor repent; nor can any change, or shadow of
change fall on him. 2. Its most unjust to complain and quarrel with him, who
has jus, (...), right, law, full and unconstrained liberty to do with his
own what he pleases; but the heavenly irradiations and out-shinings of
Christ's love, and the influence of his free grace, are all his own, and most
free; for if the Seaman have no just cause to quarrel with God, because the
wind blows out of the East, when he desires it may blow out of the West; and
the Husbandman cannot in reason plead male-government in the Almighty, Gods
(...) his own, and most free.
because he restraines the clouds, and binds up the womb of heaven, in
extreme drought, when he cries for rain and dew to his withered earth, and
meddowes, and valleys; so neither is there any just pleading (a sinlesse desire
of the contrary is a far other thing) with the Lord, because he binds up
the bowels of Christ* from outing his love, or restrains the winds and
breathings of the Spirit from blowing. 3. We may desire the wind of the Lord
to blow, because its an act of free grace in him, so to do; but to contend
with the Lord, because he will not act himself in works of free grace, at our
pleasure, is to complain that grace is grace; for if grace were obnoxious, in
all its sweet spirations and motions, to my will, or to your desires, it should
not be grace, but a work of my hireing and sweating. 4. This sorrowing must
accuse the free, holy, and innocent love of Christ, as if his love were proud,
nice, humorous, high, passionate; whereas infinite freedom, infinite majesty,
and loveliness and meekness of tenderest love, do all three concur
admirably in Jesus Christ. Love cannot be hired; Cant. 8.7. If a man would give
all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned. And for
the strength of tenderness of love, the same place pleads; Many waters
cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. And Paul asserteth, Ephesians.
3.18. Submission required and ^harity to Gods dispensations under dissertions.
The breadth, and length, and death, and height of it. 5. There is required a
submission under such a divine dispensation; else we upbraid grace, and will
be wicked, because God will not be (actu secundo,) as gracious in his
influence, as we are humorous in our sickly desires. 6. If we could
understand the sense of divine dispensation, the Lord often intends grace,
when he suspendeth grace; and his dissertions are wrapped up in more invisible
love and free grace, then we are aware of: and why should not we, in faith,
believe his way of dispensation to be mercy?

Asser. 8. Sometimes (2.) Gods immediate lashes on the soul, is the occasion
of our sinful mis-judging of God; Psalm. 38.2. Thine arrows stick fast in me,
and thine hand presses me sore. Hence comes a sad reckoning, Verse. 4. Mine
iniquities are gone over my head, as a heavy burden they are too heavy for
me. And Psalm. 77.4. Thou hold mine eye waking* I am so troubled that I
cannot speak. And what follows from this? A great mis-judging of God. Verse.
7. Will the Lord cast off for ever? will he be favorable no more? Verse. 8. Is
his mercy clean gone for ever? does his promise fail for evermore? Verse. 9.
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Its but a poor ground of inferring that God
has forgotten to be merciful, and Christ is changed, because there is night
and winter on your soul: Is the God of Nature changed, because its not ever
summer, and daylight? because a rose withers, and a flower casts its
bloome, and the sun is over-clouded, therefore God has forgotten himself?
Dispensations of God are no rules to his good pleasure; but his good pleasure
regulates all his dispensations. If the Soldiers of Christ quarter in the dry
wilderness, not in the suburbs of heaven, their Leader is wise.

3. Darkness and night are blind judges of colors; in dissertion, it is
night on the soul; Apprehensions biggest and most terrible in d^ssertion,
because of the darkness of the mind.
and imaginations are strongest and biggest in the darkness; the species of
terrible things plow deep furrows of strong impressions on the phancie in the
sleep, when the man walks in darkness, and has no light, either of sound
judgment, or soule-comfort: it is night with the soul, and then a bush moved
with the wind, is an armed man; every conviction of conscience is condemnation.
2 Cor. 1.8. We were pressed out of measure, above strength, in so much that we
dispaired even of our life, Ver. 9. But we had the sentence of death, there
were loads and weights laid on us above strength: darkened souls put on Christ's
deep representations of wrath, and blackness of indignation; and change him
in their apprehensions, in another Christ.

4. Satan can drink up at one draught, a grieving and sorrowing spirit, Satan
can raise our apprehensions to swelling thoughts of Gods dispensation, as too
grievous to be borne.
2 Cor. 2.7. and he has access to the phancie, and out-workes of the soul of
the child of God, so he can enlarge the species to a double bigness; let it
be considered, if the Grammar of Heman, be not a little swelled, in more then
ordinary Rhetoric, Psalm. 88.4. I am counted as these that go down to the pit,
as a man that has no strength. Verse. 5. free amongst the dead, like the
wounded that lie in grave, whom thou remembrest no more; and they are cut off
by thy hand. Ver. 7. Thy wrath lies hard on me, and thou have afflicted me
with all thy waves. If God forgot him as a buried man, and not a wave of Gods
wrath, but was gone over his soul, what could God do more? And Jobs words are
a little beyond the line, Chap. 1^.24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face from me,
and take me for thine enemy? Words arise up to Mountains. Job was not holden
of God to be an enemy: Satan can make every pin in the Cross an hell, and
put a new sense on Gods dealing, other then ever he meaned. When Christ opens a
vein, to blood a conscience, Satan if he may have leave, shall shut in his
Lyon-teeth to tear the vein, and make the hole of the wound as wide as heart
and life may come out; and therefore he raises up apprehensions, and sowes
strife, and pleas with Christ, and waters his own seed. Can love kill thee?
Were it Christ that does all this, would he not once come to the bedside of a
sick Son? Can Christ's love throw a poor friend into hell, and leave him
there? He has forgotten thee. Satan can argue from dispensation and trialls
to the state. Which is false Logic. This thou suffer: ergo thou art not in
the state of adoption. It Is not good that such a Mineon as Satan, have the
ear of a disserted soul; he can carry tales between Christ and the soul, to
separate between friends. Never believe ill of Christ; Love thinks no ill. If
ye love Christ, two Hells may cast water on your fire of love, but cannot
quench it. Christ will believe no ill of you, let Satan speak his will.

Our love is swayed with jealousy* and misgivings.
5. Even the love of a Saint to Christ, under an hard dispensation is sick with
jealousy, and travelleth in birth with phancied suspicions of Christ's love.
Our love is swayed with mis-givings; it is full of cares, and fears, and
doubtings; because it is not always edged with heavenly wisdom. It takes life
from sense, and felt embracings, from presence, and reciprocation of warmenesse
from Christ's bowels: and when face answers not face, Divine Disp^^s^tion not
our Rule.
and Christ's love does not echo and resound to our love, then it faints: we
too often measure Christ's love by our foot; we calculate Christ's love by our
own elevation, not by his: and Christ's mysterious dispensation, should not
point the hour; nor is the full Moon, nor the noonday Sun of Christ's
love, the compass that our affections and love, should sail by. Yea, having
not seen Christ, 1 Pet, 1.8. nor felt him, yet we love him, and believe in
him; and this is most spiritual love, and has most of love in it; the more
jealousy without ground, the less love of Christ, at least, the less solid
constancy of love.

6. Unbelief is a special cause of Soule-trouble. Unbelief is qu^r^lous.
1. In bodily diseases pain does not create it self; but sinful passive
dissertion does create it self. Christ cannot own unbelief, by him all
things were created. Unbelief spinning out new calumnies of Christ, adds
oil to the fire, and makes desertion a thousand talent weight heavier then it
would be. This may be evidenced in all the complaints of the Saints under
dissertion; in which more is laid on Christ's name, then is true. Unbelief is a
querulous thing. Isai. 49.14. But Sion said, unbeleeving Sion said, the Lord
has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me; this was an untruth, and is
confuted in the next verses. Mary Magd^len, thought they had taken away her
Lord, and he was as near her, as the turning about of her body; and she
within speaking to him face to face; and when unbelief does raise such
thoughts, as Christ has forgotten to be merciful; Christ is changed, he
loves not to the end. What pain must be at the souls bottom, where such
mis-judging of Christ, and his love is in the brimme? and yet there is a coal
of the love of Christ, smoking in the bottom of the soul? A loving opinion
of Christ is hardly expelled. Especially, one particular mis-report should not
make me receive a misunderstanding of Christ, I never heard ill of Christ
before, but much of his excellency and sweetness, and why should I admit an
untried impression, that the Sun that gives light to all, is dark; that
fire is cold, it is not true-like; that Christ is an enemy, if once a friend*
Had we a storehouse, and a high-bended habit of honorable, sublime, and high
thoughts of Jesus Christ, his excellency, the weight of his preciousnesse,
eminency, we should the more hardly give way to the lies that our unbeleeving
heart raises against him.

Believing of our state to frequent in d^ssertion, but more of Christ.
2. Our second mis-giving from unbelief, is in believing our state. Psalm.
31.22. I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes. I am none of
Christ's, is a too ordinary mimistake; as (he is changed, and not mine) often
goes before. Christ, if not only, ere we see our own provocations. Hence the
complaints of Job, chap. 6. chap. 13. chap. 16. chap. 19. and of Jeremiah,
chap. 20. chap. 15. of Ezechiah, Esai. 38. of Asaph, Psalm. 77. of Heman, Psalm.
88. of the Church, Esaias 49.14, 15. Esaias 63. chap. 64. Psalm 102. Psalm. 6. Psalm.
42. Psalm. 31. run more on the strain of complaning of God, and his unkind
dispensation, then of the Plaintiffes sins, and provocations; and where there
is one mistake of our selves under dissertion, the reader may find out ten
mistakes of Christ, and when the disserted soul mis-judgeth his own state; it
issues from, and reflecteth on the mis-judged apprehension of Christ.

3. From unbeleefe issues the mis-judging of our own actions: been, on the
right motives, Mis^judging of ou^ a^tions frequent in d^ss^rtion.
and for the right end, the good that I do. The antecedent is true, but not
the consequence: There is a cloud in our fairest sun, and clay in our water;
but because good works are not our Saviors, its no good ground to say, they
have no influence in the way of our salvation; and they are not way-marks in
our journey; because they are no part of the ransom that bought heaven. We
have a grand opinion of our own righteousness, and when we miss it, we
think we miss Christ himself; which is a great mis-judging, and argues a
believing in our selves, not in Christ. And often soule-trouble arises from
defects, omissions, and sins in our selves. If simple grief for sin as
offensive to love arise, that is good soule-trouble; but such soule-trouble as
shakes the bottom of faith, and turns the soul off Christ, to seek
righteousness in it self, is damnable: as it is hard for an unregenerate man to
see sin in it is dreadfullest colors, and not despair: so it is hard for a
regenerate person to see sin, as sin, and not to fall on unbelief, and
doubting of Christ's love. Antinomians think any anxiety for sin, which
expels actual rejoicing in Christ, our turning off Christ, Ant^nomians
mistake touching anxietie for sin.
and our casting of the conscience again under the Spirit of bondage, and
work of the Law. Which is contrary to truth, and the command of James, to be
afflicted and mourn; and Christ's saying, Blessed are they that mourn, for
they shall be comforted; and Peter, who says, there may be need, that the
Saints be in heaviness for a season.

It Is a great point of wisdom, 1. to know how far forth our spiritual
walking may be a seed of comfort, we may easily err on either hands. 2. The
Logic would be humble; Lord I am not hauty, Ergo, I am comforted in thee.
Paul says, well, I know nothing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified; we
would not build a Tower on a Moale-hill. 3. From our sinful walking, we may
draw grounds of godly sorrow, yet not grounds of unbelief; Faith and Godly
sorrow are consistent together. 4. It Is not safe to argue that we are not in
Christ, from the wants adhering to our sincere performances. While we slander
our selves, we may slander the Spirit of God. 5. The measure of our obedience,
cannot be a warrant to counter-argue Christ, as want is no warrant to stand
far off from Christ: no more then it is good Logic; to flee from the fire,
because you are cold; or to be at odds with gold, because you are needy, and
poor; poverty may conclude a sailing with low sails, and humility, but not
unbelief; your want of all things, should not empty rich Jesus Christ.

7. Absence of Christ mis-apprehended through unbelief, occasioneth
soul-trouble. In which there is something which evidenceth saving grace in the
troubled soul, as is before said. For the want of the thing loved, cannot but
here be a gracious torment to the lover. The Spouse is sick, and dies, when
she wanterh him whom her soul loves, We are extremly to long for Christ
absent, but there be many reasons why we may not mis-judge him in his absence.
Cant. 2.5. chap. 5. verse. 6, 8. David so expresses himself, Psalm. 84.2. My
soul longs, yea even faints, or dies, or is at an end, for the Courts of
the Lord, my flesh and my heart cries out for the living God. The word (...)
is to desire, or to be consumed, or to make an end of any thing. David's desire
of enjoying God, was such, as it was his death to want God; it may hold forth,
as Pagnine observes, that David's soul, either extremely desired the Lord, or
dyed upon the absence of God. But to be anxiously troubled in an unbeleeving
manner, is the sinful soule-trouble. Why does the soul doubt of Christ's
Winter, more then of his Summer? Absence and presence, his coming, and his
departing, are both his own works. God has liberty in the one, as in the
other; as it is Gods liberty to make fair weather and storms, to make a fair
day, and a cloudy day; To make David a King, and his brethren shepherds and
common soldiers, so has he his own freedom in the breathings of his own
Spirit, and the blowing of his own wind, or of the drawing a curtain over his
own face, and hiding himself: and neither in this, nor in any of his ways of
freedom, can we challenge the Lord, or plead against him. And if we think we
do well to be angry, even to the death, at the motions and breathings of
Christ's free love, then may we compel Christ to be kind, and visit us, as we
think good. What ever ye be, Christ is Lord of his own presence and visits,
and it is good the Kings Chamber of presence be a Dainty; and Christ's wine be
not so common as water: nor can we here force kindness, or acts of heavenly
manifestations on him; he hides himself. Why, he is as reasonable and wise, in
his going, as in his coming.

2. We should take on us to steward and husband the kisses Christ, better then
he can do himself; and should quarrel, because the Lord has not thought fit
to make Heirs and Minors, that are yet under Nonage, Masters and Lords of
their own young heaven; this were not a good world for us. Christ's love is
better then wine, Cant. 1. Neither our head, nor our heart could endure to
drink, at our own will, of this new wine of the higher Kingdom. Better for us
it is that Christ bear the key of the Well of life, then children have it; and
if the Government of the higher and lower family shoulders of Christ, the
leading of this or that single person to heaven, Diverse considerable reasons of
Christ's absence, to wit, 13.
is worthy Christ's care.

3. And consider, that Christ goes not behind the mountain, or hides
himself upon mere hazard, but so weighty reasons, that love may be sharpened
through absence; that the Christ's bed; that care may be had, when he rests
in his; that the high Tides and rich Feasts of Christ's love, after sad and
heavy desertions, may heighten the worth and esteem of Christ; that faith and
love, may with more of the violence of ven, lay hold on Christ, after long
seeking, and not part with Cant. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. that we may know, what
weakness is in our own clay legs, under desertion, and Christ's legs, which
are pillars of marble set on sockets of gold; that absence and presence, the
frownings and smilings of Christ, may be to the Saints the little images of
hell and heaven, and broken men may read their Christ's count-booke of free
grace, with tears in their eyes, and songs of praise in their mouth. That we
may be in high love, and sick for absent Christ; and may be at the pains
Christ absent, and kiss his veil, when we can

4. No thing does more allowd cry the softness and baseness of our nature,
then our impatiencie under sad dispensations, Mis^judging a^gue^^ s^ftn^sse of
nature and weakness of judgmens.
when we are positively resolved upon this, that God loves us; yet because of
a cloud over our Sun, and one scruple of Gall in our joy, to lodge a new
opinion, that Christ is changed in another God, and that his love does plot,
and contrive our destruction, argues a weak, and soon shaken Faith. It
speaks lightness of love to Christ, that it is loosed at the root, with the
scratch of a pin; he hides himself, and you say, oh, it is not Christ, but
some other like him; for Christ would not so go, and come. Well rooted
friendship can scarce suffer you to believe so much of a brother, or a
companion. But when ye thus mis-judge Christ, we may gather, if he should
appear in the garments of vengeance, as he does to the damned; it is to be
feared, this would drink up our faith and love, if Christ were not more
gracious, then we are constant; Lord, lead us not into temptation.

5. I deny not but seeming wrath, and Christ's intercepting of messengers of
love, and flamings of hell's fury on the soul, are prodigious-like Comets,
glimmering over a trembling conscience; and that its much to keep orthodox,
sound, and precious thoughts of Christ, when the Christian is not himself; yet
when the child myleth about in a round, to say, the earth runs about in a
circle, or to think the shore or the rock saileth from the ship that carries
you, when the ship moves, and the shore stands still, are but signs of a
weak-headed and green Sailer: So because you are deeply affected with a sad
absence, to believe Christ's love runs a circle, and that you stand still as
a rock, and the change is in Christ, argues a green, raw wit, and instability
of faith; and that the s^a-sands can no more easily drink-up a gallon of water,
then that temptation would swallow-up the poor man's faith thus fainting, if
the invisible strength of the Advocate, who intercedeth for the Saints, did not
uphold him.

Now is my soul troubled. 2. The second circumstance in the Text, is the time,
(...), Now is my soul troubled. There is an Emphasis in this Now: Christ had a
troubled soul before, and was sensible of afflictions; but now he saw more in
this cross, then in all afflictions; he saw the curse of the Law, and the
wrath of God stamped on this cross. Saints must look for a growing cross.
And the reasons.
Christ had never any Now, or juncture of time, before or after, comparable to
this Now. Observe that, Christ and his followers must look for growing and
swelling crosses. Mat. 26.37. Jesus began to be sorrowful, and very heavy. He
had all his life, Isai. 53. sorrow; verse. 3. he was a man of sorrows; Christ
had been sorrow, and had acquaintance with grief: Hebr. (...) and was known
and noted to all, marked out to all, by his griefs; but now he wadeth deeper
in troubles. Let all Christ's followers look for a growing cross, and a sadder
and sadder Now. Psalm. 3.^. Lord, how are they increased that trouble me? Psalm.
25.17. The troubles of my heart are enlarged. Hebr. become most broad. Psalm.
42.7. Deep calls unto deep, at the noise of thy water-spouts, all thy waves
and thy floods are gone over me. One cross calls to another, God raineth
them down, as one wave of the sea calls another. So Job's afflictions came
on him in a growing way. David, Psalm. 69.2. I sink in the deep mire, where
there is no standing. I wade on deeper and deeper, till I lose ground and
bottom. I am come into the deep waters, where the floods overflow me. (2.)
Christ's sufferings Christ weighs out in ounces and drams, so much gall in
the Cup, and yet some more; and because that works not the cure, yet an ounce
more. (3.) Christ can appoint clothes for David's faith would reach so far,
as that he should bear it well, that another should sacrifice a wicked son
Absalom to God's justice; O how did David mourn that he was killed! Yet the
Lord measured out to Abraham a Cup of deeper gall, to kill with his own hand
his one son, a believing son, an heir of the promise. (4.) What if twelve
years bloody issue be little enough Christ; yet another must be eighteen
years; and a sick-man thirty and eight years. Our Physician knows us well.
Let us study for a growing faith to growing crosses: A growing faith for
growi^g crosses.
and if a cross as broad and large as all Britain, and a sword as public as
three Kingdoms, yea as all the bounds of Christendom come; so that there be no
peace to him that goes out, or comes in, we are to be armed for it. Nor 2. is
it enough after pestilence and the sword to sit down, and say, Now I Will die in
my nest, and multiply my days as the sand. Stay, in heaven only there be
neither widows, nor killed husbands, nor beggars, nor plundered houses;
understand the sense of providence right; we have not yet resisted unto blood:
we have yet seas and floods of blood to swim through, ere we come to shore.
A private cross is too narrow a plaster to our sore; and therefore a public
one, as broad as all Scotland, as all your Mother-Countrey and Church is little
enough. It must be yet broader, and we must yet lose more blood.

What shall I say? 3. The third circumstance in Christ's soule-trouble, is his
anxiety of mind, What shall I say: it is as much as, Anxiety in Christ.
What shall I do? But what means this anxiety of Christ? Its like a doubting
of the event; but there is neither doubting nor despairing in it. There is
fear, exceeding great heaviness and sorrow in it; and as an anxious man
through extremity of suffering is put to his wits end, as destitute of
counsel, to say, I know neither what to do, nor say; so Christ had a sinlesse
anxiety. Learned Divines acknowledge there was an innocent and sinlesse
oblivion in the sensitive memory, A sinl^sse oblivion in Christ.
in regard it was intent only upon the extreme agony, and not obliged in all

2. Nor is faith actu^lly, always, without exception, to believe:

Christ's sensitive affections, in their physical and natural operations, How
Christ's sensitive affections are under a law.
so restrained and awed by a divine Law, as that they may not put forth
themselves to the utmost and highest degree of intension, when the light of
reason shows the object in the superlative degree of vehemence. Reason and
light could never show to any suffering man, at one time, such a great death of
evil of loss and positive evil of sense, as it did show to Christ, at this
instant of time. To be suspended from an immediate, full, perfect, personal,
intuitive fruition, Chris^'s l^sse great.
and vision of God, is a greater eclipse, then if ten thousand suns were
turned into pieces of sackcloth of hair, and the light totally extinguished;
or, then if all the Angels, all the glorified Saints that are, or shall be, in
heaven, were utterly excluded from the comfortable vision of God's face. You
cannot imagine what a sad suspension of the actual shining of the immediately
enjoyed majesty of God this was; and what a positive curse and wrath was
inflicted on Christ, so as his anxiety could not exceed.

4. Christ was to suffer in his natural affections, of joy, sorrow, The
personal union hindered not the operations of sinless humane infirmities.
yet it cannot be denied; for Grace does not destroy Nature, nor could the
vision of personal union hinder the exercise of all humane affections and
infirmities in Christ, in the state of his humiliation, as clothes of gold
cannot allay the pain of the head and stomach: Grace is a garment of cloth of
gold, and the union personal, the perfection of grace; yet it hindered not
Christ from being plunged in extreme horror and anxietie.

5. There were in Christ at this time some acts of innocent and sinnelesse
darken^sse in the sensitive soul, Christ's anxiety sinlesse.
that he actually thinking of the blackness and dreadful visage of the second
death, was now like a man destitute of counsel. But 1. This was merely
penal, and out of dispensation; for Christ's soule-paine is an excellent
skreen and shadow, or a sconce between the soule-troubled believer and hell;
and Christ's anxiety, and his, What shall I say? is a bank and a great high
coast between a distressed conscience who is at, What shall I do? whither
shall I go? where shall I have relief and help? and the extremity of his
forlorn condition.

2. Christ's anxiety was not opposite to any light of faith, or moral
holiness; as the simple want of light is not night, an eclipse of the sun
removes no light, nay not at all one beam of light from the body of the sun;
all is light that is on the other side of the covering, it removes only light
from us, who are on this side of the interposed covering which causes the
eclipse. This anxiety was only opposed to the actual happiness and natural
fruition of God enjoyed in the personal union, not to any light of a moral
duty required in Jesus Christ. But 2. We are not to conceive that Christ's
anxiety, fear and sorrow, were only imaginary, and supposed upon a mistake
that had not any fundamentum in re, ground in the thing it self; No mistake in
Christ's soul deserted.
as Jacob mourned and would not be comforted, at the supposed death of his
son Joseph, thinking he was torn with wild beasts, when the child was alive
and safe; and as the believer will sorrow that God has forsaken him, and has
forgotten to be merciful, and that he is turned of a friend an enemy, when
its not so, but a great mistake; God has not forgotten to be merciful, The
Strength of Israel cannot repent and change. Christ's darkness in this was
negative, and naturally negative, he looking wholly on real sadness, death,
wrath, the curse of the Law, but not privative, or morally and culpably
privative; for Christ h^d never a wrong thought of God, he did never bel^eve
God to be changed; nor did he upon a mis-judging of God conceive God had
forsaken him, when as he had not forsaken him, as if Christ's spiritual sense
were deceived, in taking up a mis-apprehension of God, or his dispensation. And
therefore that complaint, Why (...) have thou forsaken me? has not this
meaning, as it has in many places of Scripture, Psalm. 2.1. Psalm 74.1. Christ's
desertion real.
There is no cause why thou should forsake me; for there were just causes
why the Lord, at this time, should forsake his Son Christ. And therefore the
forsaking of Christ was real; because grounded upon justice. The elect had
forsaken God, Christ stood in their place, to bear their iniquities, Isai. 53.
that is, the punishment which the elect should have suffered eternally in hell,
for their own iniquities: And in justice God did for a time forsake his Son
Christ, not only in sense and apprehension, but really. 2. Satan does so mist
and delude the weak believers, The judicial mispending of our affections, and
the cause thereof.
that because they will not mourn, nor be humbled, for real objects, sins,
unbeleefe, mis-spending of time, which are true causes of sorrow and mourning,
they waste sorrow needlessly and sinfully, the righteous dispensation of God
intervening, for false and supposed causes, as through ignorance, for these
things that are not sins, yet are falsely conceived to be sins; or through
mis-apprehension, imagining that the Lord is changed, and become their utter
enemy, when he cannot forget them, Isai. 49.14, 15. or through mis-judging
their own state, conceiving they are reprobates, when there is no such matter.
So when we will not duly object, place and time our affections, its
righteousness with God that we lose our labor, and spill and feed away our
affections prodigally, in a wood of thorns, for nothing; because we do not
give them out for Christ: and so we must sow, and never reap. But Christ could
not thus lavish away his fear, sorrow, sadness. I know there is a forsaking
in God, In what respect* Christ was forsaken.
joined with hatred: God neither in this sense forsook Christ, nor did Christ
complain of this forsaking. God's forsaking of him, was in regard of the
influence of actual vision, 2. of the actual joy and comfort of union, 3. of
the penal inflicting of the curse, wrath, sorrow, sadness, stripes, death, on
the man Christ.

Use. If Christ was put to, What shall I say? what shall I do? How shiftlesse
the sinner is in judgment.
what a sad and forlorn condition are sinners in? how shiftlesse are they?
Isai. 10.3. When God asks of them, What will ye do in the day of
visitation, and in the desolation that shall come upon you from far? to whom
will ye flee for help? where will ye leave your glory? Jer. 5.31. What will
ye do in the end? Guiltiness is a shiftlesse and a forlorn thing. Take a
man pained and tormented with the stone, he cannot lie on this side, he
turns to the other, he cannot lie, his couch cannot ease him; he casts
himself out of the bed to the floor of the house, he cannot rest there; no
place, not Paradise, say a man were tortured up heaven before the throne, the
place of glory, simply considered, should not ease him. What a desperate course
do the damned take, to se^ke dens and rocks of the earth to hide themselves
in? Can thou lodge under the roof of the creature, when the Creator armed
with red and fiery wrath pursues thee? And when that fails them, and they
dare not pray to God, they petition hills and mountains to be graves above
them, to bury such lumps of wrath quick, Revel. 6.

2. I defy any man, with all his art, to be an Hypocrite, No hypocrites
formally in hell and at the last judgment.
and to play the Politician in hell, at the last judgment, in the hour of
death, or when the conscience is wakened. A robber does never mock the Law and
Justice at the Gallows, what ever he do in the woods and mountains. Men do
cry, and weep, and confess sins right down, and in sad earnests, when
Conscience speaks out wrath, there is no mind then of Fig-leave-coverings, or
of colors, veiles, masks, or excuses.

3. Conscience is a piece of eternity, a chip that f^ll from a Deity, and the
nearest shadow of God, Conscience ends with the sinner, as it begins.
and ends as it begins. At first, even by it is natural constitution,
Conscience warreth against Concupiscence, and speaks sadly out of Adam, while
it is hot, and not cold-dead; I was afraid, hearing thy voice, I hid my self;
and this it does, Romans 1.19. chap. 2.15. While lusts buy and bribe conscience
out of office, then it cooperateth with sin, and becomes dead, in the end,
when God shakes an eternal rod over conscience, then it gathers warm blood
again, as it had in Adams days; and has a resurrection from death, and
speaks gravely, and terribly, without going about the bush; O how ponderous
and heavy! How far from tergiversation, cloakings, and shifting, are the
words that dying Atheists utter, of the deceitfulness of sin, the vanity of
the World, the terrors of God? Was not Judas in sad earnest? did Saul speak
policy, when he weepeth on the Witch, and says, I am sore distressed? Did
Spira dissemble and sport, when he roared like a Bear against divine wrath?

What shall I say?

This says, A truly wakened Conscience is spechlesse.
that Christ answering for our sins had nothing to say; The sufferer of
Satisfactorie pain, has no words of Apology for sin. The friend that was to
be cast in utter darkness, for coming to the Supper of the great King, without
his wedding Garment, (...), his mouth was muzled, as the mouth of a mad dog; he
was speechless and could not bark, when Divine justice speaks out of God.
Job chap. 40. answers ver. 4. Behold, I am vile, what shall I answer thee? I
will lay my hand on my mouth. When the Church finds justice pleading against
her; It Is thus, Ezech. 16.63. That thou may remember (thy sins) and be
confounded, and there may be no more an openining of a mouth, because of thy
shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou have done, says the
Lord. I grant, satisfactory justice does not here put men to silence, but it
proves how little we can answer for sin. Even David remembering that Shimei,
and other Instruments had deservedly afflicted him, in relation to Divine
justice, says, Psalm. 39.9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou
did it. Three demands of Justice given in against Christ and answered by him.
There were three demands of justice given in against Christ, all which he
answered: Justice put it home upon Christ. 1. All the elect have sinned, and by
the law are under eternal wrath: To this claim, our Advocate and Surety
could say nothing on the contrary. It Is true Lord. Christ does satisfy the
Law, but not contradict it. The very word of the Gospel answers all these. In
this regard, Christ's silence was an answer; and to this, Christ said, What
shall I say? I have nothing to say.

2. Thou art the sinner in Law; to this Christ answered, A body thou have given
me. The Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give himself
a ransom for many. Matthew. 20.28. The whole Gospel says, Christ who knew no
sin, was made sin for us.

3. Thou must die for sinners. This was the third demand; and Christ answers
it, Psalm. 40. Hebr. 10. Thou have given me a body, here am I to do thy will.
To all these three Christ answered with silence: and though in regard of his
patience to men, it be said, Esai 53.7. He was brought as a Lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his
mouth. Yet it was most true, in relation to Divine justice, and the Spirit of
God has a higher respect to Christ's silence (which was a wonder to Pilate)
before the bar of Gods justice. O could we by faith see God giving in a black
and sad claim, a bill written within, and without, in which are all the sins
of all the elect, from Adam to the last man; and Christ with watery eyes
receiving the claim, and saying, Lord, It Is just debt, crave me, what shall I
say on the contrary? We should be more bold, not barely to name our sins, and
tell them over to God, but to confess them, and study more for the answer, of
a good Conscience; by faith to substitute an Advocate, to answer the demands of
Justice for our sins; and if men believed that Christ, as surety satisfieing
for their sins, could say nothing on the contrary, but granted all; they
should not make excuses and shifts, either to wipe their mouth with the whore,
and say, I have not sinned, nor be witty to make distinctions, and shifts, and
excuses to cover, mince, and extenuate their sins.

Father save me from this hour. The fourth part of this complaint, Help
nearer in trouble then we apprehend.
is an answer that Faith makes to Christ's question. What shall I say? What
shall I do? Say praying wise (says Faith) Father, save me from this hour. A
word of the Coherence, then of the words. We often dream, that in trouble,
help is beyond Sea, and far off; as far as heaven is from earth. When help
is at our elbow; and if the Spirit of Adoption be within, the prisoner has
the Key of his own Jayle within, in his own hand. God was in Christ's bosom,
when he was in a stormy Sea, and the light of Faith says, behold, the shore at
hand. Death takes feet and power of motion from a man; but, Psalm. 23.4. yet
Faith makes a supposition, that David may walk and live, breathe in the
grave, in the valley of the shadow of death. It Is the work of Faith to keep
the heat of life in the warm blood, even among clods of clay, when the man is
buried. This anxious condition Christ was in, as other straits are to the
Saints, is a strait and narrow pass, there was no help for him on the right
hand, nor on the left; nor before, nor behind, nor below. Christ, as David his
type, Psalm. 141.4. Looked round about, but refuge failed him, no man cared for
his soul; but there was a way of escape above him, it was a fair easy way to
heaven. The Church was in great danger and trouble of war and desolation,
when she spoke to God, Psalm. 46. Yet their faith seeing him to be very near
them; God is our refuge and strength: true, he can save (says sense) but that
is a foul flying in the woods, and over-Sea-hop, far off: Not far off (says
Faith) A very present help in trouble: or a help easily, or (...) Exceedingly
found in troubl^. So Psalm. 44*9. Thou have cast us off. Hebr. Thou art far
from us, thou have put us to shame. What lower could the people be? Verse. 19.
We are in the dungeon, in the place of dragons: We are in the cold grave,
beside the worms and corruption; and thou have covered us with the shadow of
death, a cold bed. Yet then see what Faith says, Verse. 20. We have not
forgotten the name of our God. Our God is a word of great faith. And to come to
Christ; his Soul was troubled; He was at, What shall I say? In a great
perplexity. Yet he has a strong faith, both of his Father, and of his own
condition. He believed God to be his Father, Christ used faith in tro^ble for
our cause.
and calls him Father. Yea, in this hell, he applies the relation of a
Father to himself, Matthew. 26.39. O my Father; this is the warmest love-thought
of God; and when his comfort was ebbest, his confidence in the Covenant
strongest. My God, my God, etc. Its much glory to our Lord, that Faith sparkle
fire and be hot, when comfort is cold and low. O what an honor to God, the
man is slain, and cold dead, yet he believes strongly the salvation of God.
Christ kills the poor man, and the man's faith kisseth and hangs about
Christ's neck, and says, If I must dye, let Christ's bosom be my deathbed.
Then he must believe, if God was his Father, by good Logic, he must be the
Son of God, and if God was his God, then the heir of all must claim the
privileges of all the Sons of the house in Covenant. God (I may say) was more
then Christ's God, and more then in covenant with God, as he was more then a
servant, so more then a Son, then a common one, and Christ's faith is so
rational, and so binding with strength of reason, that he will but use such a
weapon, as we may use, even the light of Faith, and he will claim but the
common benefit of all the Sons in covenant, when he says, My God, my God.
What ever Papists say, if ever Christ was in hell, it is now; but see, he has
heaven present with him in hell. If God could be apprehended by faith, in hell,
as a God in covenant, then should hell become heaven to that believing soul.
Christ took God, and his God, and his Father; as Jonah, a type of him, down
to the bowels of hell with him: and as we see some dying men, they lay hold on
some thing dying, and dye with that in their hand; which we call the
dead-gripe: so Christ died with his Father, by faith, Christ's death-gripe.
and his Spouse, in regard of love stronger then the grave, in his arms: this
was Christ's death embracings, his death-kisse; and Job professes so much.
Lower he could not be, then he complains he is, chap. 19. in all respects,
of body, which was a clod of bones and skin; in regard of wife, servants, dear
friends, of the hand of God in his soul. Yet verse. 25. I know that my goel, my
kinsman, Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand the last man on the earth.

This leads us, in our forlorn perplexities, Use.
to follow Christ's footsteps, both under evils of punishment and sin. The
people in their captivity in Babylon, Ezekiel. 37. were an host of dead and
(which is more) dry bones; the Churches in Germany, in Scotland, are dry bones,
and in their graves* the Churches in England and Scotland, in regard of the
sinful divisions, and blasphemous opinions in the worship of God, are in a
worse captivity, and lower then dry bones, and our woes are not at an end; yet
the faith of many sees, that deliverance, and union there must be, and that
our graves must be opened, and that the wind of the Lord must breathe upon the
dry bones, that they may live. God has in former times opened our graves, when
strange lords had dominion over us, I would we were freed of them now also,
but our yoke is heavier then it was; but God shall deliver his people from
those that oppress them.

Again, as you see in great perplexity Christ believed God to be his Father,
and that he himself was a Son; so are we under pressures of conscience, and
doubtings because of sin, to keep precious, high, and excellent love-thoughts
of Jesus Christ.

Object. 1. But what if a soul be brought to doubt of its conversion; because
he finds no good he either does, Object. 1.
or can do? true faith, is a working faith.

Answ. Some so cure this, as they prove Physicians of no value to poor souls,
I mean, Antinomians: For, say they, This is the disease that you in doubting of
your faith, Doubtings from want of qualifications how cured.
because you find not such and such qualifications in you, therefore seek a
righteousness in your self, and not in Christ. I should easily grant that
man's inherent righteousness is, in his carnal apprehension, his very Christ
and Redeemer; but in the mean time, These are two carnal and fleshly
extremities, and faith walks in the middle between them. 1. Its a fleshly way
to say, that, because I find sin reigning in me, I have killed my brother,
says a Cain; Saltma^sh, Free grace. c. 5. p 92, 93
I have betrayed the Lord of glory, says a Judas; yet I am not (says a
Libertine) to question whether I believe or no; for this puts fleshly and
profane men on a conceit, Be not solicitous what you are, Two false ways in
^uring doubtings whether the soul be in Christ or no.
take you no fear of serving sin and diverse lusts, but believe, and never
doubt, whether your faith be a dead, or a living faith, though you go on to
walk after the flesh; but believe, and doubt not whether you believe or no. The
other extremity is of some weak Christians, who because they find that in them,
that is in their flesh, dwells no good, and they sin daily, find much
untowardnesse and back-drawing in holy duties; therefore (say they) I have no
faith, I am none of Christ's: This is a false Conclusion, drawn from a true
Antecedent, and springs from a root of selfe-seeking, and righteousness
which we naturally seek in our selves; for I am not, being once justified, to
seek my justification in my sanctification; but being not justified, I may well
seek my non-justification in my non-sanctification: as Libertines say, this is
the fault of all, To argue from faint performance of duties no faith, is unjust
reasoning.
when it is the fault only of some weak mis-judging souls; so do they take
the Saints off from all disquietnesse and grief of mind for neglect of
spiritual duties, as if all godly sorrow and displeasure for our sinful
omissions, were nothing but a legal sorrow for want of selfe-righteousnesse,
and a sinful unbeleefe: but its formally not any such thing, but lawful and
necessary, to make the sinner go with a low sail, and esteem the more highly
of Christ; and its only sinful, when abused to such a legal inference, I
omit this and this, I sin in this and this, ergo, God is not my Father, nor
am I his son.

But I hold this Position, as evidently deducible out of the Text, In the
roughest and most bloody dispensation of God toward Saints, neither
soule-trouble, nor anxiety of spirit can be a sufficient ground to any, why
they should not believe, or question their sonship and relation to God, as
their Father. Its clear that Christ in his saddest condition believed, and
stood to it, that God was his Father: The only question will be, If sinful
and fleshly walking be a good warrant. To which I answer, If any be a servant
of sin, and walk after the flesh, and be given up to a reprobate mind to commit
sin with greediness, How f^rre we may a^g^e to conclude no faith, from sinful
walking.
such a one has good warrant to believe that God is not his Father, and that
he is not in Christ; because, 2 Cor. 5.17. If any man be in Christ, he is a
new creature. If any be risen with Christ, he seeks the things that are
above, where Christ is at the right hand of God. He is dead, and his life is
hid with Christ in God. And, He mortifieth his members on earth. Col. 3.1, 2,
3, 4. He is redeemed from this present evil world, Gal. 1.4. He is dead to
sins, and lives to righteousness. 1 Pet. 2.24. He is redeemed from his
vain conversation. 1 Pet. 1.18. He is the Temple of the Holy Ghost; he is
not his own, but bought with a price; and is, being washed in Christ's blood, a
King over his lusts, a Priest to offer himself to God, an holy, living, and
acceptable sacrifice, 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. Revel. 1.5, 6. Romans 12.1. But he that
remains the servant of sin, and walks after the flesh, and is given up to a
reprobate mind, etc. is no such man; ergo, such a man has no claim to God as
his Father: and upon good grounds may, and ought to question his being in
Christ. Only, let these cautions be observed. 1. It is not safe to argue from
the quantity of holy walking; for many sound believers may find untowardnesse
in well-doing, yet must not cast away themselves for that. A smoking flax is
not quenched by Christ, for that it has little heat, or little light; and
therefore ought not by us. 2. Beware we lean not too much to the quality of
walking holily, to infer, I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all I have;
then, God I thank him, I am not an hypocrite, as the Publican, and a wicked
man. Sincerity is a sensible, speaking grace; its seldom in the soul without
a witness. Lord, thou know that I love thee (says Peter;) he could answer
for sincerity, but not for quantity: he durst not answer Christ, that he knew
that he loved him more then these. Sincerity is humble, and walks on
positives, Lord, I love thee; but dare not adventure on comparatives, Lord, I
love thee more then others. 3. There be certain hours, when the believer
cannot make strong conclusions, to infer, I am holy, therefore I am
justified; because in darkness we see neither black nor white, and Gods light
hides our case from us, that we may be humbled, and believe. 4. Believing is
surer then too frequent gathering warmness from our own hot skin.

Saltmarsh, and other Libertines make three Doubts that persons have, as
sufficient grounds, to question their being in Christ: 1. Backsliding. 2. The
man's finding no change in the whole man. 3. Unbeleefe. Give me leave therefore
in all meekness to offer my thoughts, in sifting and scanning this Doctrine.

This is then (says he) your first doubt, that you are not therefore beloved
of God, Saltmarsh in hi^ Free Grace, or flowings of Christ's blood, etc. c. 4.
p. 79 80.
or in Christ, because you fell back again into your sin, so as you did.
Suppose I prove to you, that no sin can make one less beloved of God, or less
in Christ.

Answer.

Then I shall conclude, that sin cannot hinder the love of God to my soul.

Question.

Antinomians doubts touching the spiritual state of a s^ule, discussed and
improved.
This I prove* 1. The mercies of God are sure mercies, his love, his covenant
everlasting: Paul was persuaded that neither life, nor death, etc. could
separate him from the love of God. The Lord changes not in loving sinners. 2.
Whom the Lord loves, he loves in his Son, he accounts him as his Son;
for he is made to us, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. But God
loves his Son always alike; for he is the same yesterday, and to day, and
for ever: ergo, Nothing can make God love us less; because he loves us not
for our selves, or for any thing in our selves, etc. 3. God is not as man, or
the son of man. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's chosen? The
foundation of God stands sure. God's love is as himself, ever the same.

Answer 1. The thing in question to resolve the sinner, whether he be loved of
God, The immutability of Gods love no ground but multitudes may doubt whether
they be in Christ or not.
from eternity, as one chosen to glory, is never proved, because no sin can
make one less beloved from eternity; and sin cannot hinder the love of God,
(non concluditur negatum;) for its true, sin cannot hinder the flowings and
emanation of the love of election, it being eternal; else not any of the race
of mankind, God seeing them all as guilty sinners, could ever have been loved
with an eternal love. But the consequence is naught, ergo, back-sliders in
heart, and servants of sin, have no ground to question, whether they be loved
with the love of eternal election, or not.

2. This Physician lays down the conclusion in question, which is to be
proved, to the resolving of the man's conscience, that he may be cured; the
thing to be proved to the sick man, say he were a Judas, wakened in
conscience, is, that notwithstanding his betraying of Christ, yet God loved him
with an everlasting love, and he is in Christ. Now he cures Judas thus,
God's love is everlasting, his covenant everlasting, no sin can hinder God to
love Judas, or separate a traitor to Christ, from the love of Christ.
Separation, supposes an union; less loving, supposes loving: so he heals
the man thus; no disease can overcome or hinder the Art of such a skilled
Physician, to cure a dying man. But what if this skilled Physician will not
undertake to cure the man, nor to move his tongue for advice, nor to stir one
finger to feel the man's pulse: Ergo, The man must be cured. For if the man be a
back-slider in heart and a servant of sin, Christ never touched his pulse. He
has as yet sure grounds to question, whether he be loved of God, or be in
Christ, or no; for except you prove the man to be loved with an everlasting
love, you can prove nothing: And your argument will not conclude any thing for
the man's peace, except you prove him to be chosen of God; which is his only
question. But say that he is loved from everlasting, and that he is in
Christ, by faith, its easy to prove, that his sins cannot change everlasting
love, nor make him less beloved of God, A necessity of inherent signs and
qualifications to doubting souls.
nor separate him from the love of God. You must then either remove the man's
doubting, from signs inherent in the man, (and if he be a back-slider in
heart, you fetch fire and water from beyond the Moon to cure him;) or you must
fetch warrants to convince him, from the mind, eternal counsels of love and
free grace within God; and that is all the question between the poor man and
you. You cannot prove God has loved him from everlasting, because he has
loved him from everlasting. If Libertines in this Argument intend to prove,
that a chosen convert in Christ has no ground to question, that he is not
beloved of God, and not in Christ* 1. That is nothing to the Thesis of
Antinomians, maintained by all, that sinners, as sinners, are to believe Gods
eternal love in Christ to them; and so all sinners, elect or reprobate, are to
believe the same. 2. Its nothing to the universal commandment, that all and
every one in the visible Church, wearied and laden with sin, or not wearied
and laden, are immediately to come to Christ and rest on him, as made of God to
them their righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, without any inherent
qualification in them. 3. Its nothing to the point of freeing all, and building
a golden bridge to deliver all who are obliged to believe, elect or reprobate,
from doubting whether they be in Christ or not, that they may easily come to
Christ, and believe his eternal love and redemption in him, though they be in
the gall of bitterness, and bonds of iniquity, and that immediately. Which
golden Paradise to heaven and Christ, Antinomians liberally promise to all
sinners, as sinners. I cannot believe that its so easy a step to Christ.

How God loves his Son Christ, and beleeve^s wit^ with the same love.
For the second: It Is a dream, that God loves sinners with the same love every
way, wherewith he loves his own Son Christ. And why? Because God loves us
only for his own Son, and for nothing in us Ergo, Far more it must
follow, its a far other, an higher, fountain love, wherewith the Father
loves his own eternal and consubstantiall Son, the Mediator between God
and man; and that derived love wherewith he loves us sinners. As the one is 1.
Natural; the latter, free? 2. The love of the Father to the Son, as his
consubstantiall Son, and so far as it is essentially included in his love to
Jesus Christ Mediator, is not a love founded on grace and free-mercy, which
might never have been in God; because essentially, the Father must love his
Son Christ, as his Son; and being Mediator, he cannot for that renounce his
natural love to him, which is the fundamental cause, why he loves us for
Christ his Son, as Mediator; but the love wherewith the Father loves us for
his Son Christ, is founded on free Grace and mercy; and might possibly never
have been in God. For, 1. as he could not but beget his Son, he could not but
love him; nature, not election can have place in either: but it was his Free
will to create a man, or not create him. 2. He cannot but love his Son
Christ, but God might either have loved neither man nor Angel, so as to choose
them to Salvation, and he might have chosen other Men and Angels, then these
whom he has chosen; God has no such freedom in loving his own
Consubstantiall Son. 2. Its an untruth, that God loves his chosen ones, as
he does love his Son; that is, with the same degree of love, wherewith he
loves his Son; I think that not far from either gross ignorance, or
blasphemy. It possibly may be the same love by proportion, with which the
Father tendereth the Mediator, or Redeemer, and all his saved and ransomed
ones; but in regard of willing good to the creature loved, he neither loves
his redeemed with the same love, wherewith he loves his Son; except
blasphemously we say, God has as highly exalted all the redeemed, and given to
them a name above every name, as he has done to his own Son; nor does he so
love all his chosen ones, as he conferreth equal grace and glory upon all
alike; as if one star differed not from another star in glory, in the
highest heavens. Our own good works cannot make our Lord love us less or
more, with the love of eternal election; but they may make God love us more
with the love of compl^cency, and a sweeter manifestation of God in the fruits
and gracious effects of his love. According to that, John 14.23. Jesus said, if
a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will
come unto him, and make our abode with him.

The third reason is the same with the first, and proves nothing but a Major
Poposition, not denied by the disquieted sinner, which is this: Who ever is
justified and chosen, cannot be condemned; whom ever the Lord once loves to
salvation, he must always love to salvation; for his love is like himself,
and changes not. But the disquieted sinner is chosen and loved to salvation.
This Assumption is all the question: and the truth of a Major Proposition, can
never prove the truth of the Assumption.

Saltmarsh, Free Grace, Chap. 4. Page 83.84, 85.

Because you feel not your self sanctified, you fear you are not justified.
If you suppose that God takes in any part of your faith, repentance, new
obedience, or sanctification, as a ground upon which he justifies or forgiveth
1. you are clear against the Word; for if it be of Works, it is no more of
Grace. 2. It must then be the only evidence you seek for; and you ask for
sanctification to help your assurance of justification: but take it in the
Scriptures way.

1. In the Scriptures, Christ is revealed to be our sanctification. Christ is
made unto us righteousness, sanctification. I live, yet not I, but Christ
lives in me. Ye are Christ's, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in
the name of the Lord Jesus. He has quickened us together with Christ. We are
his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Jesus Christ himself
being the chief corner stone: That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;
that new man which after God was created in righteousness and true holiness;
We are members of his body, of his flesh, and his bones. And being found in
him, not having mine own righteousness. I can d^e all things through Christ
which strengthens me. But Christ is all in all. Your life is hid with Christ
in God, Heb. 13.20, 21. All these set forth Christ as our sanctification* the
fullness of his, the all in all. Christ has believed perfectly for us, he has
sorrowed for sin perfectly, he has obeyed perfectly, he has mortified sin
perfectly; and all is ours, and we are Christ's, and Christ is Gods.

2. The second thing is Faith about our own sanctification we must believe
more truth of our own graces then we can see or feel: the Lord in his
Dispensation has so ordered, that here our life should be hid with Christ in
God, that we should walk by faith, not by sight: So we are to believe our
repentance true in him, who has repented for us; our mortifying sin true in
him, through whom we are more then conquerors, our new obedience true in him,
who has obeyed for us, and is the end of the Law to every one that believes,
our change of the whole man true in him, who is righteousness and true
holiness. And thus without faith, its unpossible to please God. This is
Scripture-assurance to see every one in himself as nothing, and himself every
thing in Christ, Faith is the ground of things hoped for, and the evidence of
things not seen. All other assurances are rotten conclusions from the Word,
invented by Legal Teachers not understanding the mystery of the Kingdom of
Christ. The Scriptures bid you see nothing in your self, or all as nothing.
These teachers bid you see something in your self: so as the leaving out
Christ in Sanctification, is the foundation of all doubts, fears,
distractions. And he that looks on his repentance, on his love, on his
humility, on his obedience, and not in the tincture of the blood of Christ,
must needs believe weakly and uncomfortably.

Answer.

How far sanctification may evidence, that a soul is in Christ.
If a servant of sin, any Cain, wakened with the terrors of God, see his
sins, feel hell in his soul for them, and have no warm thoughts of love,
and farre-off-affiance, at least in Christ Jesus; but flee from Christ, and go
to the enemies of Christ for comfort, as Judas did, he may strongly conclude:
I feel, I am not sanctified; I hate the Physician Christ, and run from him:
Ergo, I am not justified. And from a true real non-feeling of sanctification,
its a strong consequence, there is no justification. But from a mis-prizing of
Grace and Sanctification in my self, I cannot conclude, I am not justified.
From non-sanctification* any may concl^de truly, non-j^stif^catio^.
We know Papists in point of certainty of salvation, argue so; many deluded
Hypocrites believe, or imagine, they have oil in their lamps, yet they are
deceived; therefore the Saints can have no certainty they are in Christ. Its
just like the answer now in hand. A mis-judging of sanctification, cannot argue
no justification: Ergo, A true and real judgment of no sanctification in
Hypocrites, and slaves of sin, cannot argue the persons to be justified, who
thus argue. It is as if I should argue thus; A frantic and a sleeping man
cannot know that he is frantic, and sleeping; therefore a sober and a waking
man, cannot know that he is sober and waking. For a deserted child of God is in
some spiritual Frenzy and sleep, and does mis-prize Christ in himself, and
sanctification; and therefore argues often, that he is not in Christ, upon
false principles. But a wakened conscience in Cain, and Judas, do strongly
conclude, I am not a new creature, but a servant of sin: Ergo, I am not
justified, and not in Christ; and Cain in this consequence is sober, and not
asleep.

2. Not any Protestant Divine, Protestants make mortification and repentance
some other thing then Faith.
whom the Author calls Legal Teachers, ignorant of the mystery of the
Gospel; did ever teach, that Faith, new Obedience, Repentance, are grounds upon
which God justifies a sinner. Antinomians, who make Repentance and
Mortification all one with Faith; and as Master Den says, they are but a
change of the mind, to seek righteousness and mortification in Christ* not
in our selves. Thus much (...) does signify, must say, as we are justified by
faith, so also by repentance, and mortification: if repentance be nothing but
faith, as they say.

3. We seek only the evidence of justification in our holy walking; as the
Scripture does, 1 Pet. 1.24. Galat. 1.4. 1 Pet. 1 18. 1 John 3.14. Infinite
places say, these that live to Christ, and are new Creatures must be in Christ,
and justified, 2 Cor. 5.17. 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11, 12. Gal. 2.20. Col. 3.1, 2, 3,
4. Then the arguing from the effect to the cause can be no rotten conclusion,
except by accident, in a soul distempered under desertion and weakness.

4. These places that make Christ our sanctification, and Christ to live in us,
and believers to be the workmanship of Jesus created in him, unto good works,
etc. Make not these to be acts of Christ formally repenting perfectly in us,
sorrowing for sin, mortifying sin perfectly in us: as if we were mere
patients, and were only obliged to repent, sorrow, mortify sin, when the
Spirit breaths ^n us, and not otherwise, as Libertines explain themselves;
which I hope to refute hereafter. Towns asser* of grace, page 32.

Regeneration and justification not one, as Antinomians teach.


2. Nor do these places make Justification and Regeneration all one; as Master
Town, with other Antinomians do. For we are not regenerated by faith, but
that we may believe; but we are justified by faith. 2. Regeneration puts in
us a new birth, the image of the second Adam; Justification formally is for the
imputed righteousness of Christ, which is in Christ, not in us. And it seems
to me, that they make Justification and Sanctification all one: for the Author
says, that Christ not only repents in us, but for us, Christ obeyed for us,
and is the end of the Law to every one that believes. Now what mysterious
sense can be here, I cannot dream; Sure, it is no Gospel-secret; if the
meaning (that Christ repents, and obeys for us,) be, that Christ by his
grace works in us repentance, and new obedience, and mortification, and the
change of the whole man; its a good and sound sense. But then how must all
assurances from repentance and new obedience, be the rotten conclusions of
Legal Teachers? To see all these wrought by Christ, as the efficient and
meritorious cause, and to ascribe them to the Spirit of Jesus, and thence
conclude, we are Justified, as all Protestant Divines teach, is no rotten
conclusion of Legal Teachers. For sure, if we ascribe them to nature, to free
will, to our selves, and confide in them, as parts of our righteousness, No
assurance can flow from acts of sanctification performed by our good nature.
and from them, in that notion, draw the assurance of our Justification, as
Papists, and Arminians do, and as the Saints out of fleshly presumption may
do; this is no doctrine of Protestants. Is the Sun obliged to me, because I
borrow light from it? Or the Floods and Rivers beholden to men because they
drink out of them? The new man is a creature of Christ's finding; cursed be
they that sacrifice to Free Will; Its a strange God. The kingdom of grace, is
a Hospital of free graces to sick men: all we do, the least good thought, or
gracious motion in the soul, is a flower, and a rose of Christ's planting, and
an Apple that grew on the tree of life; a sinner is the stock, but free Grace
the sap. Christ's Father the Husbandman, life and growing is from Jesus the wine
tree; we are but poor twigs that bring forth fruit in Christ. But I fear the
sense of this, that Christ repents for us, and obeys for us, he being the
end of the Law to overy one that believes; be far otherwise, to wit, that
Christ's obedience of the Law, The Antinom^an Mortification, a delusion.
he being the end of the Law, as also his passive obedience is ours. If this be
the intended sense, then all our Sanctification is nothing, but the
Sanctification and holy active obedience of Christ. I yield this to be a broad,
a fair and easy way to heaven. Christ does all for us, Christ weeped for my
sins, and that is all the repentance required in me, if I believe that Christ
was mortified, and dead to the world for me, that is my mortification; and if I
believe, that the Change of the whole man was truly in Christ, this is my true
holiness: then my walking in holiness cannot be rewarded with life eternal,
nor have any influence as a way, or means leading to the kingdom. 2. Christ's
active obedience imputed to the sinner, can be no evidence of justification,
because it is in Christ, not in me; any evidence, or mark of Justification
must be inherent in the believer, not in Christ. 3. And one and the same thing
cannot be a mark and a sign of it self. Now the active obedience of Christ
imputed to the sinner, is holden to be a part of Justification.

5. The Scripture does indeed bid you see nothing in your self, How we see
righteousness in our selves.
that can buy the righteousness of Christ, or be an hire and wages to ransom
imputed righteousness; and Legal Teachers, not any Protestant Divines, b^d
you see something, Rise, reign, er. 7. pa* 2.
a great something of merit, and selfe-righteousnesse in your self. And
Antinomians say, that the New creature, or the New man mentioned in the Gospel,
is not meant of Grace, but of Christ. The Scripture makes Christ and
Justification the cause, and Sanctification and the New creature the effect; 2
Cor. 5.17. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. And this assertion
makes Sanctification, as form^lly distinguished from Christ and Justification,
just nothing. And Antinomians say, Rise, reign, er. 15. page 3.
that in the regenerate and Saints there is no inherent righteousness, no
grace or graces in the souls of believers, but in Christ only. And M.
Saltmarsh says the same, that our sorrow, repentance, mortification, and
change of the whole man, are nothing in us; but they are in Christ, Holiness
and mortification, inherent in us.
and must be apprehended by faith, as things unseen: whereas the divine nature
is in the Saints, 2 Pet. 1.4. Faith dwells in us. 2 Timothy 1.5. The new
creation and image of Christ is in the mind, Ephesians. 4.23. The seed of God
abides in us, 1 John 3.9. The anointing that teaches all things, (...),
remains in you, 1 John 2.27. and Ezekiel. 36.^6. I will give you an heart of
flesh, and I will put my Spirit (...) in the inner part, or in the midst of you.

Antinomians teach, Rise reign er, 17. page 4.
That true poverty of spirit does kill and take away the sight of grace. And,
Rise, reign er, 77 page 15.

Antinomians deny all inherent holiness to be in us.


Sanctification is so far from evidencing a good estate, that it darkens it
rather; and a man may more clearly see Christ, when he sees no
sanctification, then when he sees it; the darker my sanctification is, the
brighter is my justification. So Saltmarsh, The Scriptures bid you see nothing
in your self, or all as nothing; these Teachers bid you see something in your
self. And its a walking by faith, and not by sight; and a life hid with Christ
in God, to believe more truth in our own graces, then we see or feel. Now its
true, How we are to see grace in our selves.
the Saints out of weakness mis-prize the Spirit's working in them, and while
they under-value themselves, they under-rate the new creation in themselves,
and tacitly upbraid and ^lander the grace of Christ, and lessen the heavenly
treasure, because it is in an earthen vessel; but poverty of spirit and grace
will see, and do see grace inherent in it self, though as the fruit of grace.
Cant. 1.5. I am black (O daughters of Jerusalem) but comely, as the tents of
Kedar. Verse. 11. While the King sits at his table, my spikenard sends
forth the smell thereof. The Saints as they make a judgment of Christ and his
beauty, so also of themselves; My heart waked. I am sick of love. Psalm. 116.16.
O Lord, truly I am thy servant. Psalm. 63.1. My soul thirsts for thee, my
flesh longs after thee. Psalm. 73.25. Whom have I in heaven but thee? and
there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. Psalm. 130.6. My soul
waits for the Lord, more then they that watch for the morning. So Ezekiah,
Esaias 38.3. Paul, 2 Cor. 1.12. 2 Timothy 4.7, 8. 1 Cor. 15.9, 10. And others have
set out in its colors the image of Christ in it self; but not as leaving out
Christ, and taking in merit; nor does the sense of sanctification darken
justification, or lessen it to nothing, except where we abuse it to merit, and
selfe-confidence, as Peter did; who in point of selfe-confidence ought to have
forgotten the things that are behind. 2. Yea, to say we see justification more
clearly, when we se^ no sanctification, is to make the water and the Spirit, 1 John 5.8. dumb or false witnesses, that either speak nothing, or tell lies. 3.
It is against the office of the Spirit, which is to make us know (...), the
things that are freely given us of God, such as faith, repentance, love,
mortification, Act. 5.^. 2 Timothy 2.25. Phil. 1.29. Ephesians. 2.8. Romans 5.5. Gal.
2.20. I grant by accident, when sin appears to a Saint out of measure
sinful, and he sees how little good he has, that he is blind, naked,
poor, and has no money, nor price, that he is sold as a wretched man under a
body of sin, Romans 7.14, 24. it heighteneth the excellency and worth of the
ransom and blood holden forth in Just^fication: And white righteousness,
Nothingn^sse in our selves heighteneth the price of Christ.
free and glorious, set beside black guiltiness, and no sanctification
compearing as price or hire, makes Christ appear to be choycer then gold or
rubies. Yea, when I see no sanctification to buy Christ, then justification is
more lovely, eye-sweet, taking, and soule-ravishing; as the more light, the
more darkness is discovered; and the more sin, the higher is Jesus Christ. And
by all this, the Saints professing their own integrity, and holy walking
before God, should see something in themselves, not understanding the mystery
of the Gospel, and err miserably with Legal Teachers, and darken free
justification by grace: And one grace of God should obscure and destroy
another; for to see, feel, and profess sanctification, is an act of
supernatural feeling, and of grace; how then can it darken the faith of the
remission of sins in Christ?

But it may be asked, When the Saints cannot be assured that God is their
Father, in regard of sin, unbeleefe, and present deadness, what reasons would
you use to raise their spirits up to the assurance of their interest and
relation to God, as to their Father?

Ans. There is no way of arguing Saints out of their unbeleefe, except he that
labors to strengthen them, being an Interpreter, How Ministers are to deal
with troubled souls.
one of a thousand, who can show a man his righteousness, be so acquainted
with the condition of the afflicted soul, that he see in him some inherent
qualification, that may argue to the Physician there is some, less or more of
Christ in the soul of the man; else if he know him to be a person yet utterly
void of Christ, sure he must deal with him that is under the Law, in a more
legal and violent manner, then with him whom he conceives to be under the
Gospel; for one and the same physic cannot suit with contrary complexions. The
Author professes he deals with sinners as sinners, and so with all sinners;
as if physic for the gut were fit physic for the stone in the bladder. I go
not so high, but speak to a weak son, who has God for his Father, but under
soule-trouble doubts whether God be his Father or not.

If he lay down a principle that he was never in Christ, because of such and
such sins; you are not, who ever intends to cure him, to yield so much, and
to deal with him according to a false supposall, as if he were not in Christ:
but must labor to prove he is in Christ; which to no purpose is done, by
proving fair generals, as Saltmarsh, with other Libertines, does; that is, you
but till the sand, and beat the air to prove, that Gods love is eternal, and
his covenant and decree of election to his chosen so stable and unalterable, as
no sin can hinder the flowings of eternal love, when you make not sure to the
man, that he is loved with an everlasting love.

Hence these considerations for easing the afflicted conscience of a weak child
of God.

Asser. 1. The soul laboring under doubts whether God be his Father, is to
hold off two rocks, either confiding or resting on duties, or neglecting of
duties: the former is to make a Christ of duties; as if Christ himself were
not more lovely and desirable, Christ more to be chosen then the comforts and
peace that results from duties.
then the comfortable accidents of joy, comfort, and peace in doing duties.
Yea, take the formal vision of God, in an immediate fruition in heaven, as a
duty, and as in that notion contra-distinguished from the objective vision of
Christ, then Christ is to be enjoyed, loved, rested on, infinitely above the
duties of vision, beatifice love, eternal resting on him, yea, above imputed
righteousness, assurance of pardon, reconciliation; as the King is more then
his bracelets of gold, his myrrh, Spikenard, perfumes, ointment, kisses; the
tree more desirable then a fleece of apples that grows on it for the fourth
part of a year. 2. Sin, it must be to sue and woe the Kings Attendants and
Courtiers by himself, or to make duties Christ, and Christ but a Manservant
and Mediator to duties, sense, comfort, assurance, or the like. 3. The Whelps
of the Bear are taken from her by swift riding away with them, and by casting
down one of them, that she may lose time in gaining the rest, while she
returns back again so many miles to bring that one to the den. And the smell
of some delicious fields, they say, so takes the dogs, that they forget the
prey, and follow it no more. To smell so much in duties, and to be so sick and
impotent in loving and resting on them, as to lie down in the way, and seek
Christ no more, is doubtless a neglect of Christ. And thus high our Doctrine
never advanced Sanctification, nor enthroned any acts, duties, or
qualifications, under the notion of witnesses, or creators of peace or
reconciliation; how our hearts may abuse them, is another thing.

Asser. 2. What, advise you then a deserted soul to go on in duties? and seek
righteousness in himself? By no means; to seek righteousness in himself,
that is highest pride: but will you call it pride for a starving man to beg? Is
it selfe-denyall for such a one to be stark dumb, and to pray none in his
famishing condition for food? Did the Spouse seek her self in this duty? Cant.
3. Watchmen, Under soule-trouble we are to do* but not to rest and (...) in
what we do.
saw ye him whom my soul loves? Was this a resolution of pride? Chap. 3.2. I
will rise now, and go about the City in the streets, and in the broad ways, I
will seek him whom my soul loves. And is it selfe-righteousnesse for the
Spouse to send her hearty respects of service to Christ, when she cannot have
one word from him, nor one smile? Cant. 5.6. Tell my beloved that I am sick of
love. Nor do I think Mary Magdalen was in a distemper of Pharisaicall
righteousness, when she rose and prevented the morning sky, and came weeping
to the grave; O Angels, saw ye the Lord? Gardener, whither have you carried
him? May I not do these duties, when I miss him? May I not wake in the night?
May I not do well to f^ed a love-feaver for the want of him? May I not both
pray, and say, Daughters of Jerusalem, pray for me? May I not make a din
through all the streets and the broad ways, and trouble all the Watchmen and
Shepherds, and pray them, Can you lead me to his tent, and tell me where he
lies? O but all these were to be done in faith: True; but are they not duties
of love-sicknesse I owe to Christ also? I know they cannot bring to me
everlasting righteousness; but is not seeking and knocking, stairs to finding
and opening?

Asser. 3. Another counsel is; force not a Lawsuit, seek not,
Love-Iealousies under desenti^n.
buy not a plea against Christ. Conscience a tender piece under Jealousies
says, O he loves not me, Christ has forgotten me, join not in such a
quarrel with conscience. Have not cold and low thoughts of Christ's love to
you, because he is out of sight, he is not out of languor of love for you.

Asser. 4. Unbelief is a Witch, an Inchantresse, and covers Christ's face with
a veil of hatred, wrath, displeasure. Examine what grounds of reason you have
to mis-beleeve, or break with Christ; say, he had broken with you, yet because
you know it not, for suspicion; lose not such a friend as Christ, if you get
never more of him, you may swear and vow to take to hell with you (if so he
deal with you) the pawnes, and love tokens you once received, that they may
be witnesses what Christ is, and may be the remnants, seeds, and leavings, of
the high esteem you once had of him.

Desertions have a time.
Asser. 5. A time Christ must have to go and come, and therefore must be
waited on. We give the Sea hours to ebb and slow, and the Moon days to
decrease and grow full; and the Winter-sunne and the Summer-sunne months to
go away, and return; and whether we will, or no, God and Nature take their
time, and ask us no leave: Why has God given to us eyes within, and without,
but that David may wear his eyes, while they be at the point of failing, in
looking up, and in waiting for God, Psalm. 69.

Christ recompenses his absence with doubled smilings.
Asser. 6. And though you were in hell, and he in heaven, he is worthy to be
waited on; the first warm smile of a new return, is sufficient to recompense
all sorrow in his absence, to say nothing of everlasting huggings, and
embracings.

Asser. 7. Nor is this a good reason; I find sin, rottenness, and so a
deserved curse in all my works of sanctification; Saltmarsh Free Grace, c. ^.
page ^8.
therefore why should I make them any bottom for assurance, but I must take in
Christ here for Sanctification: for if works of this kind be not done in
Faith, to the knowledge of the doer; they can witness nothing, but bear a
false testimony of Christ; nor do we ever teach, that Christ is to be
decourted from our works of Sanctification; Works of sanctification, though
polluted with sin may bottom assurance.
but even faith it self, which is a bottom of peace to Antinomians, by this
reason, must be cashiered; for as the love of Christ, our prayers, humility,
are not formally sins, but only concomitantly, in regard that sin adhereth
to them; as muddy water is not formally clay and mudde, but in mixture its
clayie, and muddie; so our Faith is concomitantly sinful; both because often
its weak, and so wanting many degrees, and mixed with sin, deserves a curse,
as well as works of Sanctification, but it apprehends Christ and righteousness
in him, and so it bottometh our assurance: If by apprehending, you mean to
bring to you certain knowledge, and assurance, that Christ is made my
righteousness; then you beg the question, if you deny this to works of
Sanctification. For, 1 John 2.3. Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep
his commandments. Ver. 5. And who so keeps his word, in him verily the love
of God is perfected: hereby, (that is, by keeping his word, called twice
before, verse. 3.4. The keeping of his Commandments; and verse. 6. Walking as he
walked:) Hereby (says he) know we, that we are in him, in Christ our
propitiation and righteousness; and thus are we justified by keeping the
Commandments of God, because by this we apprehend, and know that we are
justified. 2. But then all that are justified must be fully persuaded of their
justification, and that faith is essentially a persuasion and assurance of the
love of God to me in Christ, its more then I could ever learn to be the
nature of Faith, a cons^quent separable I believe it is. 3. If by apprehending
Christ and his righteousness, be understood a relying, and fiduciall
acquiescing and recumbencie on Christ for salvation: It is granted in this
sense, that Faith is a bottom to our assurance of our being in Christ; but
that it breeds assurance, in a reflect knowledge, always that a believer is
in Christ, is not true: for, 1. I may believe, and be justified, and not know;
yea positively doubt, that I believe and am justified; We do not at all times
know that we believe.
as thousands have pardon, and have no peace nor assurance of their pardon, and
have faith in Christ, and in his free love, and have no feeling of Christ, and
of his free love. For we believe Saltmarsh ibid. 84.
more truth of our own graces (and so of our faith and assurance of our
pardon) then we can see or feel, which is Gods dispensation, that our life
should be hid with Christ in God; Ergo, the life of Faith, by which the just
does live, is hid; and above the reach of feeling at all times. 2. As Faith
which is the direct act of knowing and relying on Christ for pardon, is a work
of the Spirit, above the reach of reason; so also the reflect act of my knowing
and feeling, that I believe and am in Christ, which proceeds sometime from
Faith, and the immediate Testimony of the Spirit; sometime from our walking in
Christ, 1 John 2.3, 4. 1 John 3.14. is a supernatural work, above the compass
and reach of our Free Will, and is dispensed according to the spirations and
stirrings of the free grace of God; and as the keeping of his Commandments,
There is need of the a^^uall influ^nce of grace to the refl^ct knowledge of ou^
faith, and spiritual condition.
actu primo, and in it self, gives Testimony that the soul is in Christ, and
justified, even as the act of believing in it self does the same; yet that we
actu secundo, efficaciously know and feel that we are in Christ, from the
irradiation and light of Faith, and sincere walking with God, is not necessary,
save only when the wind of the actual motion and flowing of the Spirit,
concur with these means; just as the Gospel-promises of themselves are life,
and power, but they then only actually, actu secundo, animate and quicken
whithered souls, when the Lord is pleased to contribute his influence, in the
shinin^ of his Spirit. Otherwise I may walk in darkness, yea, b^^eeve, pray,
love, die for pain of love, and have no ligh^ (...) reflect knowledge, and
feeling that I am in Christ, Esaias ^0.10. I may be sick of love for Christ,
call, knock, pray, conferr with the watchmen, and daughters of Jerusalem, and
be at a low ebb in my own sense; yea the beloved may to my feeling and actual
assurance have withdrawn himself, Cant. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Cant. 5.5, 6, 7, 8.
and all my inherent evidences cannot quicken me in any tolerable assurance.
It Is true, Sanctification may be darkened, yea, and Faith also, when there is
nothing to the faith-failing and outer dying but this only of Christ the head,
The witnessing of ^anctification sometime dark.
(all the life of a Saint retyring not to his faint heart, but to his strong
head,) I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: but the dark evening
of David's, both Faith and Sanctification, and of Peter in his denying of his
Master, and his Judaizing, Gal. 2. When he and others, ver. 14. (...), do crook
and halt between Grace and the Law, as the people did between Jehovah and
Baal; their profession of Jehovah, and Christ's grace being long, and their
practice short, and inclining too much to Baal, and salvation by the Law: as
halting is a walking with a long and a short leg, the body unevenly inclining
to both sides of the way: this darkening (I say) was in the second acts of
Faith and Sanctification: but life and sap was at the root of the Oake-tree,
when it was lopt, hewed, and by winter storms spoiled of the beauty of its
leaves. We do not say, that Sanctification does at all times, actually bear
witness, or a like sensibly, and convincingly, that the soul is justified, is
in Christ; there be degrees, and intermission, and sick days, both of Faith
and Sanctification. But we say, roses and flowers have been ever since the
creation, and shall be to the end of the world, because though they vanish in
winter, yet in their causes they are as eternal as the earth: so is Faith, and
the bloomings, and green blossomings of Sanctification, always; but there is
a Summer, when they cast forth their leaves and beauty.

Asser. 8. To press duties out of a principle of Faith, is to press Christ
upon souls, nor can the seeing of beams, Duties performed in faith, not
contrary to free Grace.
and light in the air, or of Wine-grapes on the tree, be a denying of the
Sun to be in the firmanent, or of life and sap to be in the Vine-tree: to see
and feel in our selves grapes, and fruits of righteousness, except we make
the grace of Christ a bastard, and mis father it, is no darkening of Christ,
and free Grace, 1 Cor. 15.9, 10.

Asser. 9. There is a great difficulty, yea an impossibility, when the Lord
hides himself, The difficulty of a^tai^i^g comfort when God deserteth
and goes behind the Mountain, to command the flowing and emanations of Free
grace.

1. Because desertion were not desertion, if it were under the dominion of our
Free Will. For desertion as a punishment of sin, cannot be in the free will
of him that is punished; every punishment, as such is contrary to the will of
the punished: and desertion as an act of free dispensation for trial, must be
a work of omnipotent dominion.

2. As in works of nature and art, so is it here, that God may be seen in
both; does not men sweat, till, sow much, and the sun and summer, and clouds,
warm dewes and raines smile upon corns and meddowes, yet God steppeth in
between the mouth of the Husbandman and the sickle, and blasteth all; and the
Lord takes away the physme, stay and staff of corn and grass; and there is
bread enough, and yet famine and starving for hunger. Do not some rise early,
and go late to bed, eat the bread of sorrow; yet the armed soldier of God,
extreme poverty, breaks in upon the house? Do not watchmen wake all the
night, yet the City is surprised and taken in the dawning, because the Lord
keeps not the City? The Lord does all this, to show that he is the supreme
and absolute Lord of all second causes. Why, but he has as eminent and
independent a Lordship in the acts of his free departure, and returns, in the
sense of his love. Has not the King of Saints a withdrawing room, and an
hiding place? Is not his presence and manifestations his own? The deserted
soul prays, cries, weepeth; the Pastor speaks with the tongue of the
learned; the Christian friend argues, exhorts; experience and the days of
old come to mind; the promises convince, and speak home to the soul; the
poor man remembers God, and he is troubled; the Church, and many Churches
pray, Christians weep and pray; yet Christ is still absent, the man cannot
have, from all these, one half smile from Christ's face; the vision will not
speak one word of joy: All these can no more command a raging sea and stormy
winds to be still, and create calmnesse in the soul, then a child is able to
wheel about the third heavens, in a course contrary to its natural motion.
Omnipotency is in this departure. God himself is in the dispensation, and
absolute freedom of an independent dominion acts in the Lord's covering of
himself with a cloud, and puts an iron crosse-barre on the door of his
pavilion; and can you stir Omnipotency, and remove it? Think you praying can
charm and break independent dominion, working to show it self as a dominion?

3. The sense of Christ which is wanting in desertion, cannot be enforced by
persuasion, no more then you can, by words, persuade the deaf to hear.
Oratory cannot make the taste feel the sweetness of honey. There is a light
that comes from heaven, Sense of Christ's absence cannot be out-reas^ned.
above the sun and moon; yea, above the Gospel; and is not extracted, or
educed out of the potency of either the soul, nay nor of the Gospel, (I
conceive,) that brings forth, in act, the white stone, and the new name: and
as nature and instincts natural perform their natural duties without any
oratory, so as persuasion cannot make the fire to burn, nor the sun to
shine, nor the bird to build its nest, nor the lamb to know its mother; nature
does all these: So neither does the persuasion of Paul, preaching the Gospel,
Act. 26.28. Act. 16.14. the same thing, and every way the same work, that the
Lord does, in persuading Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem, Genesis 9.27. I
could easily admit, that we are patients in receiving the predetermination
active of the Holy Ghost in either believing, or in actual enlightening, and
the actual witnesse-light by which Christ shines in the heart, for producing
actual assurance; though in the same moment and order of time (not of nature)
we be also agents.

Asser. 10. Though means must not be neglected, as praying, and waiting on the
watchtower, for the breathings of renewed assurance; yet as touching the time,
manner, way and measure of the speaking of the vision, God's absolute dominion
is more to be respected here, then all the stirrings and motions of the under
wheels of prayer, preaching, conference.

Asser. 11. The soul should be argued with, and convinced, thus: Why, We may
(...) argue a troubled soul.
will you not give Christ your good leave to tutor and guide you to heaven? He
has carried a world of Saints over the same seas you are now in, and Christ
paid the fare of the ship himself, not one of them are found dead on the
shore; they were all as black and sunburned as you are, but they are now a
fair and beautiful company, without spot before the throne, and clothed in
white; they are now on the sunny side of the river, in the good Land where
glory grows, far above sighing and jealousy. You are guilty of the breach
of the Privilege of Christ; 1. He is a free Prince, and his Prerogative
Royal is incapable of failing against the Fundamental Laws of
Righteousness, in the measuring out either work or wages, grace or glory.
Mat. 20.13. Friend, I do thee no wrong: mine own is mine own.

Object. O but he is sparing in his grace, his love-visits are thin sown, as
straw-berries in the rock.

Answ. I answer for him; 1. The quantity of grace is a branch of his freedom.
2. Why do you not complain of your sparing improving of two talents, rather
then of his niggard giving of one only. He cannot sin against his liberty in
his measuring out of grace; you cannot but sin in receiving. Never man, except
the man Christ, durst, since the creation, (the holiest I will not except) face
an account with God, for Evangelick receipts; All in glory far short of what
they owe to Christ.
Christ to this day is behind with Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Job, Peter,
John, Paul, and all the Saints, in the using of grace, they were below grace,
and Christ was necessitate to write in the close of their counts with a pen of
grace, and ink of his blood, Friend, you owe me this, but I forgive you. They
flew all up to heaven with millions of arrear^s, more then ever they wrought
for: As some godly rich man may say, This poor man was addebted to me
thousands, now he is dead in my debt, I forgive him, his grave is his
acquittance; I have done with it. Christ upbraids not you with old debts, that
would sink you; why cast ye up in his teeth, his free gifts? 3. Think it mercy
he made you not a gray-stone, but a believing Saint: And there is no
imaginable compari^on, between his free gifts, and your bad deserving.

God cannot ^e quarrelled in deserting.
2. The way of his going and coming should not be quarrelled. The Lord walks
here in a liberty of dispensation; a summer-sunne is heritage to no Land. It
was not a blood of a daily temper that Paul was in, when he said, Romans 8.38.
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, etc. shall be able to
separate us from the love of God in Christ. It was a high and great feast, when
Christ says to his Church, Cant. 5.1. I am come into my garden, my Sister, my
Spouse, I have gathered my myrrh with my spice, I have eaten my honeycomb
with my honey: eat, O friends, d^inke, yea drink abundantly, O beloved. Its
true, he is always in his Church, his Garden, gathering lillies; but storms
and snowes often cover his Garden.

We cannot bear fullness of glory in this life.
3. Were assurance always full moon, as Christ's faith in his saddest
soule-trouble was bank-full sea, and full moon; and were our joy ever full,
then should the Saints heaven on earth, and their heaven above the visible
heavens, differ in the accident of place, and happily, in some fewer degrees of
glory; but there is a wisdom of God to be reverenced here. The Saints in this
life are narrow vessels; and such old bottles could not contain the new wine
that Christ drinks with his, in his Fathers Kingdom, Mat. 17. When the
Disciples see the glory of Christ in the Mount, Peter says, Verse. 4. Lord, it
is good for us to be here: but when that glory comes nearer to them, and a
cloud over-shaddowes them, Luke 9.34. and they hear the voice of God speak out
of the cloud, Mark. 9.7. They fell down on their face, Mat. 17.6* (...), They
were sore afraid. Why afraid? Because of the exceeding glory, which they
testified was good, but knew not what they said. We know not that this joy is
unspeakable. We rejoice, (...), with joy that no man can relate: How then can a
man contain it? I may speak of a thousand millions of things more excellent
and glorious then I can feel. Should God pour in as much of Christ in us in
this life, as we would in our private wisdom, or folly desire, the vessel
would break, and the wine run out: We must cry sometimes, Lord, hold thy
hand. We are as unable to bear the joys of heaven in this life, as to endure
the pains of hell. Every drop of Christ's honeycomb is a talent weight; and
the fullness of it must be reserved, till we be enlarged vessels, sitted for
glory.

Asser. 12. We do not consider, that Christ absent has stronger impulsions
of love, Longings after Christ* strongest in absence.
then when present in sense and full assurance: as is clear in that large Song
of the high praises of Christ, which is uttered by the Church, Cant. 5. when he
had withdrawn himself, Verse. 6. and She was sick of love for him. Verse. 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 2. There is a sort of heavenly antiperistasis, a
desire of him kindled, through occasions of absence; as we are hottest in
seeking after precious things, when they are absent, and farthest from our
enjoying. Absence sets on fire love. The impression of his kissing, embracing,
lovely and patient knocking, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove; the print
of his footsteps, the remanents of the smell of his precious ointments, his
shadow when he goes out at doors, are coals to burn the soul. Psalm. 63.6.
When I remember thee, upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. I
cannot sleep, for the love of Christ, in the night. What follows? Verse. 8. My
soul follows hard, cleaves strong after thee. Psalm. 77.3. I remembered God,
and was troubled: rather, I remembered God, and rejoiced: But the memory of old
love, and of absent and withdrawing consolations, break the heart. How do
some weep, and cast-aside their harps, when they remember the seven year old
embracements of Christ, and Christ's virgin-love, and Sion-sweet songs in the
days of their youth? Cant. 5. when the Church rose, but after the time, to
open to Christ, when he was gone, and had withdrawn himself, Verse. 5. Mine
hands (says the Church) dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with
sweet smelling mirrhe upon the handles of the bar. Then her love to Christ
was strongest, her bowels moved, the smell of his love, like sweet smelling
myrrh, was mighty rank, and piercing.

Asser. 13. Why, but then when the wheels are on moving, and the longing after
Christ awaked, When the soul is in la^guishi^g disp^sition after Christ, its
fittest to pray him home again.
and one foot, we should pray Christ home again, and love him in to his own
house, and sigh him out of his place, from beyond the mountain into the soul
again; as the Spouse does, Cant. 3.1, 2, ^, 4, 5. if ever he be found, when he
is sought, it will be now, though time, and manner of returning be his own.

Asser. 14. Nor are we to believe that Christ's love is coy, or humorous in
absenting himself, Christ's love not lordly.
or that he is lordly, high, difficill, inexorable, in letting out the sense,
the assurance of his love, or his presence; as we dream a thousand false
opinions of Christ under absence, nor do we consider that security and
indulgence to our lusts loses Christ, and therefore its just, that as we sin
in roses, we should sorrow in thorns.

Asser. 15. If the Lords hiding himself, be not formally an act of Grace, yet
intentionally on Gods part, it is; as at his return again, he comes with
two heavens, and the gold chain sodered is strongest in that link which was
broken; and the result of Christ's return to his garden, Cant. 5.1. is a feast
of honey, The Lords joyful return after desertion.
and milk, and refined wines: when he is returned, then his Spicknand, his
perfume, his myrrh, aloes, and cassia, casts a smell even up to heaven; in
the falls of the Saints, this is seen; David after his fall hearing mercy,
feeling God had healed his bones, that were broken, Psalm. 51. there is more of
Gods praises within him, then he can vent, he prays God would broach the
vessel, that the new wine may come out, Verse. 15. O Lord open thou my lips,
that my mouth may show forth thy praise: and after the meeting of the Lord and
the forlorn Son, besides the poor sons expression, full of sense:
consider how much sense and joy is in the Father; It is a Parable, yet it
says much of God. Luke 15. verse. 20. And when he was yet a great way off, his
Father saw him. Christ the Father of age or eternity, (...) Esaias 9.6. knows a
friend a far off, and his heart kindles, and grows warm when he sees him,
Were he thousands and millions of miles from God, yet aiming to come, he sees
him, and had compassion; he sees with moved bowels, and ran, how swift is
Christ's love, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. O what expression of
tenderness! and to all these, is added a new robe, and a Ring for ornament,
and a feast, the fat Calfe is killed, and the Lord sings, and daunces, Verse.
23, 24, 25. Peter's denial of Christ, brought him to weeping, flowing from the
Spirit of Grace powered on David's house, Zach. 12.10. And Peter had the more
grace, that he losed grace, for a time. As after drawing blood and cutting a
vein, more comes in the place; and after a great Fever, and decay of
strength, in a recovery, Nature repaireth it self more copiously. And often in
our sad troubles, we have that complaint of God, which he rebukes his people
for; Esaias ^0.27. Why say thou O Jaakob, and speak O Israel, my way is hid
from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from God; that is, the Lord
takes no notice of my affliction, and he forgets to right me, as if I were hid
out of his sight: and David Psalm. 31.22. I said in my have, I am cut off from
before thine eyes. Its not unlike a word which Cain spoke, with a far other
mind, Genesis 4.14. From thy face shall I be hid. But this is 1. To judge God to
be faint and weak, as if he could do no more, but were expi^ing, Esaias 40.
verse. 28. He will be both weak and wearied, if he forget his own; and our
darkness cannot rob the Lord of light, and infinite knowledge, he cannot
forget his office as Redeemer. God is not like the Storke that leaves her eggs
in the Sand, and forgets that they may be crushed and broken. When Christ goes
away, he leaves his heart and love behind in the soul, till he return
again himself; if the young creation be in the soul, he must come back to
his nest, to warm with his wings, the young tender birth.

Asser. 16. Nor is Christ so far departed at any time, but you may know the
soul he has been in, yea he stands at the side of the sick bed, weeping for
his pained child; yea your groans pierces his bowels, Jer. 31.20. How near
Christ is in desertion.
For since I spoke against him (says the Lord) I do earnestly remember him;
its not the less true, that the head of a swoning son, lies in the bosom
and the two arms of Christ; that the weak man believes, that he is utterly
gone away.

Asser. 17. Nor will Christ more reckon in a Legal way, for the slips, Christ
pardons love-errors, and can hardy punish them.
mis-judgings, and love-rovings of a spiritual distemper, then a Father can
whip his child with a rod, because he mis-knoweth his Father, and utters
words of folly in the height of a feavor. Christ must pardon the fancy, and
sins of sick love; the errors of the love of Christ, are almost innocent
crimes, though unbelief make love-lyes of Jesus Christ. There be some
over-lovings, as it were, that foames out, rash and hasty jealousies of Christ,
when acts of fiery and flaming desires do out-runne acts of faith: as hunger
has no reason; so the inundations and swellings of the love of Christ, flow
over their banks, that we so strongly desire the Lord to return, that we
believe he will never return.

Asser. 18. Though hid Jewels be no Jewels, a losed Christ, no Christ, to
sense, yet is their an unvisible, and an undiscerned instinct of heaven, that
hindered the soul to give Christ over.

Shall we upon all this, extend all these Spiritual considerations to all men,
Saltmarsh in hi^ Free Grace, cap. V. page 92 93.

It is a lie and not a Gospel-secret, that none are to question their faith,
whether it be true or no.


whether they be in Christ, or not. Some teach us this, as the great
Gospel-secret concerning Faith; That none ought to question, whether they
believe God to be their Father, Christ their Redeemer, or no; but are to
believe till they be persuaded, that they do believe, and feel more and more
of the truth of their faith, or belief; righteousness being revealed from
faith to faith: The 1. ground of this is, Christ's command to believe; now
commands, of this nature are to be obeyed, not disputed.

But this is so far from being a Gospel-secret, that it is not a Gospel
truth; and sends poor souls to seek honey in a nest of Waspes, the pathway
to presumption. For though these who truly believe, ought not to doubt of their
belief, yet these who have lamps of faith, and no oil, ought to question,
whether there be oil in their lamps, or no, and true faith with their
profession, else the foolish Virgins were not far out, who never questioned
their faith, till it was out of time to buy oil; and that these Virgins
should believe, they had oil in their lamps, when they had none, till they
should be persuaded, that empty lamps, were full lamps, and a bastard faith,
true faith, were to oblige them to feed upon the East-winde, till there should
be a faith produced in the imagination, that the East is the West. 2. All the
Scriptures that charge us to try our selves, 1 Cor. 11.^8. To examine our
selves, whether we be in the faith, and to know our selves, We may so far
question our faith, as to try whether it be true or not.
that Jesus Christ is in us, except we be reprobats. 2 Cor. 13.5. and to know
the things that are freely given us of God. 1 Cor. 2.12. and so to know our
faith, Phil. 1.29. do evince that we are to try, and so far to question,
whether we believe, or not; as multitudes are obliged to acknowledge, their
faith is but fancy, and that there is a thing like faith, which is nothing
such; and that we are not to deceive our selves, with a vain presumption,
which looks like faith, and is no faith. And James 2. many who believe there
is a God, and imagine they have faith, being void of good works, and of love,
in which the life and efficacy of faith is much seen, have no more faith,
then Devils have, Verse. 18, ^9* 20. (^.) It is true that we are to believe on
the name of his Son Jesus Christ, without any disputing concerning the equity
of the command of believing, or of our obligation to believe: For both are most
just. And to dispute the holy and just will of God, is to oppose our carnal
reason, to the wisdom of God; but we are no^, because we cannot dispute the
holy command of God; nor to reason our duty, not to examine whether that which
we conceive, we do as a duty be a bastard and false conception, or a true
and genuine duty; We are to believe after Christ's fashion and order not after
our own.
nor, because I may not reason the precept of believing, given by Jesus Christ,
am I therefore to believe, in any order that I please, and to come to Christ,
whether I be weary and laden with sin, or not weary and laden. Christ
commands me to believe, Ergo, remaining in my wickedness, regarding
iniquity in my heart, without despairing of salvation in my self, I am to
believe, I shall deny this c^ns^quence. It is all one, as if Antinomians would
argue thus; All within the visibl^ Church are obliged to believe and r^st on
Christ for salvation; whether they be elect or reprobate? whether their
whoorish heart be broken with the sense of sin, or whole? Ergo, they are
obliged to presume, or to rest on Christ, their righteousness, whether they
distrust their own, or not.

Object. 2. We find not any, in the whole course of Christ's preaching, or the
Discioles, that asked the question, Saltmarsh, ^6.64.
whether they believed or not; or whether their faith were true faith or no. It
were a disparagement to the Lord of the feast to ask, whether his dainties
were real or delusions. -- The way to be sure of the truth of good things, is
tasting and feeling: Eat, O friends, drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved.

There is nothing in Scripture to prove that the Saints have not doubted of
their temptations.
Answ. This reason would infer, that there is not a Saint on earth capable of
such a sin, as to doubt whether they believe or not; because we read not of
it in any of the hearers of Christ, or the Apostles: This is a bad consequence,
except you say, All the various conditions of troubled consciences are set
down, in particular examples, in the New Testament. Which is contrary to all
experiences of the Saints. 2. It is one thing to doubt of the truth of the
promises, and another thing to doubt, whether my apprehension of the promise be
true or false: The latter is not always sin; for it may be my apprehension of
the truth of the promises be beside the line, and off the way; and then I
question not Christ's dainties (which to do were unbeleefe) but my own
deluded fancy, which may appear to be faith, and is nothing less: the former
is indeed unbeleefe, not the latter. 3. Its true, tasting makes sure the truth
of the Lord's good things, that are enclosed in the promises; but then, an
unconverted sinner, who is void of spiritual senses, cannot be the beloved,
nor the friend that Christ speaks to, Cant. 5.1. We do not say, a believer
ought to doubt, whether he has true faith or no: but because the command of
believing obliegeth the non-converted, as well as the converted, shall the
natural man eat as a friend and a beloved, he remaining in nature, and not
yet converted, and this man in nature ought not to doubt, whether his fancy be
faith or not, but he is obliged to believe, that is, to imagine that his
fancy is faith? 4. I see not how, if the faith of the Saints be tried as gold
in the fire, they may not through the prevalencie of temptation be shaken in
their faith, as Peter was, when he denied his Savior; Believers do doubt
whether they believe or not, under great temptations.
and Paul; who 2 Cor. 1, 8. was pressed out of measure, above strength,
despaired of life, had the sentence of death. 2 Cor. 7.5. was troubled on every
side, fightings without, and fears within: and the sons of God, who may
fear that they have received the spirit of bondage to fear again, opposite
to the Spirit of adoption, Romans 8.15. but that they may faint in their
tribulations, Ephesians. 3.13. and may be surprised with fear, which has torment,
and must be cast out, 1 John 4.18. and may be ready to faint and die, Revel.
3.2. and turn lukewarm, be wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked, and yet
believe the contrary of themselves, Revel. 3.16, 17. All these may come, and
often do come to that low condition of spirit, after Justification, as to say
and think that all men are liars, their faith is no faith, that they are
forsaken of God, to their own sense, and cast out of his sight, and question
whether they ever did believe, or no: And why would the Apostle say, Patience
brings forth experience, and experience hope, and hope makes not ashamed,
Romans 5.4. if experience that ever God loved me, or that ever I believed, to my
present sense, cannot be removed? But this is but the Doctrine of Story rise,
reign, er, 32*
Famulists; who teach, That after the revelation of the Spirit, neither devil
nor sin can make the soul to doubt. And Er. 10.
To question whether God be my dear Father, after, or upon the committing of
some heinous sins, (as murder, incest, etc.) does prove a man to be in the
Covenant of works. Do not they then teach us a way of despairing, who say,
that Saltmarsh Free Grace, cap. 5. page 93.
We find not in the whole course of Christ's preaching, or the Disciples, that
any asked the question, whether they believed, or no; whether their faith were
true faith, or no? What then shall thousands of smoking flaxes and weak reeds
do, who often ask this question, Doubting in believers no sign that they are
under the Law.
and say and think, Ah, I have no faith; my faith is but counterfeit metal?
And then by this Doctrine of despair, believers ought to conclude, I am not
under Grace, but under the Law, and a Covenant of works, and so not in Christ;
yea, whatever lusters were in me before, I am in no condition of any we read
of in the New Testament, who were hearers of Christ and the Apostles; for
Libertines, never true believers, doubted whether their faith was true, or not.

Object. 3. For any to doubt whether they believe or no, is a question, that
Christ only can satisfy, Saltmarsh, Ibid. page 64.
who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Who can more properly show one
that he sees, then the Light which enlightens him?

Answ. Christ solves not questions that no man ever made: S. thinks that
believers never doubt whether their faith be true faith, or not; which is a
strong way of believing: and those must be so strong in the faith, who doubt
not of this, as they are above all temptations. But this will be found against
the experience of all believers. It is most true, none can work faith, but the
only Creator and Author of faith: but will the Author hence infer, no man,
the most wicked, nor any that ever heard Christ or his Apostles preach, doubted
of their faith? 2. The sun, with all its light, cannot persuade a blind man
who sees not, that he sees: believers often think they see, when they see
not, and think they are blind, when they see; as experience and Scripture,
Revel. 3.16, 17. Joh. 9.38, 39. teach us.

Object. 4. Faith is truly and simply this, A being persuaded more or less of
Christ's love: and therefore it is called a believing with the heart. Now, what
infallible sign is there to persuade any that they are persuaded, when
themselves question the truth of their persuasion: God only shall persuade
Japhet. Who can more principally, and with clearer satisfaction persuade the
Spouse, Saltmarsh* page 95.
of the good will of him she loves, but himself? Can all the love tokens, or
testimonial rings and bracelets? They may concur and help in the
manifestation, but it is the voice of the beloved, that does the turn: My
beloved spoke and said unto me, Rise my love, my fair one; says the Spouse.

Answ. 1. Faith may be a persuasion in some sense, but that it is a persuasion
that my faith or persuasion is true, not counterfeit, and so formally, is
utterly denied. How many believe and love Christ with the heart, who are not
persuaded that they do so; yea, much doubt whether they believe with the
heart, and would give a world to know (if it were possible) that they truly
love God? No Divine, who knows that a direct act of faith and to believe, is,
when there is no reflexe act, can deny this. 2. Arguments or signs, in
accurate speech, are not called infallible, actu secundo; the word of God is in
it self infallible, Sanctification in it self is an infallible sign^ of
justification, but not ever so to us.
actu pr^^o: But to Aristotle, this, In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth, is not infallible, actu secundo; nor are the promises, He that
believes, shall be saved. Knock, and it shall be opened. He that overcomes,
shall inherit all things; actu secundo; to a believer, who, under a distemper,
does doubt of them, infallible. So, The love of the brethren, 1 John 3.14. The
keeping of the Commandments, and the word of Jesus, is infallible in it self.
That I know Christ savingly, and that he dwells in me, 1 John 2. verse. 3.5.
but that it infallibly concludes so to me, actu secundo, is not sure, except
the wind blow fair from heaven, and the Spirit act in me. So the love tokens
and testimonial rings and bracelets of the Husband, my love to the Saints, my
keeping of his word, my holy walking in Christ, being the works of his Spirit,
which dwelt in Jesus Christ, are actu primo, in themselves, as infallible
signs of the Bridegromes love to me; as the Beloved's word who spoke and said,
Arise, my love: And if the spirations and breathings of the Spirit go not
along, both the voice and the love-bracelets (for Christ is no more counterfeit
in his love tokens, then in his word, when he speaks as a Husband) are alike
ineffectuall to persuade the soul. I see no reason to call the works of
Sanctification inferior helps in the Manifestation, more then the voice of the
Beloved; for both without the Spirit are equally ineffectuall: and if the
Spirit breathe and move with them, both are effectual, and actu primo, and
secundo, and they infallibly persuade. It is then a weak Argument, None can
simply persuade Japhet but God; ergo, The word of the Bridegroom only can
infallibly persuade; or, therefore love-bracelets cannot infallibly persuade:
for the word not quickened by the Spirit of Jesus, cannot simply persuade; and
the Lords persuading of Japhet, is the Lords work of converting Japhet, not his
enlightening of Japhet to know his faith to be true faith. Hence for that which
infallibly persuades us, I say,

1. Our act of believing does no more persuade of it self that we do
believe, How acts of sanctification make good that we believe.
except the Spirit breathe with the act of believing, for actual illumination
and persuasion, then any other act of loving Christ, his Saints, or universal
intention, or sincerity of heart to obey, does prove to us that we believe;
for many believe who know not, yea, doubt of their believing, because the Holy
Ghost makes not the light of faith effectual to persuade, that they truly
believe.

assuring us that we are the sons of God. This light comes from inherent
acts of grace in us: 1 John 2.3, 4, ^. chap. 3.14. (2) From the testimony and
rejoicing which resulteth from a good conscience: 2 Cor. 1.12. 2 Timothy 4.6, 7,
8. 1 Timothy 6.17, 18. Heb. 13.18. (3.) From the experience they have had of the
Lords dealing with their souls, and the love of God spread abroad in the
heart, by the Holy Ghost: Romans 5.3, 4, 5. (4) From a sincere aim and respect
to all the Commandments of God, Psalm. 119.6. Acts 24.16. 1 John 3.20, 21. 1 Thessalonians. 5.23. Phil. 4.12. Revel. 22.14, 15. (5.) From the positive marks that

the Saints makes of themselves, and their own begun communion with God,

floorishes, if they had neither peace, consolation, nor assurance from these,
as from marks and signs which do infallibly convince, (the light, breathings
and irradiations of the Holy Ghost concurring with them) that they are in a
saving condition, who have these qualifications, in them. (7.) Because by holy
walking, the Saints make their calling and election sure and firm, not to God,
but to themselves, 2 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. verse. 5.6, 7.

The inward testimony of the Spirit.
Asser. 3. As there is in the eye, lumen innatum; in the ear, aer internus; a
certain inbred light, to make the eye see lights, and colors without; and a
sound and air in the ear within, to make it discern the sounds that are
without. So is there a grace, a new nature, an habitual instinct of heaven, to
discern the Lords Spirit immediately testifying, that we are the Sons of God,
Romans 8.16. 1 Cor. 1.12. Grace within knows Christ speaking without, the voice
of my beloved. As the Lamb knows, by an internal instinct, the mother; but
for wakening and quickening of the instinct to apprehend this, there is need
of opened eyes, and the presence of the mother to the eye, or of the bleating
of the mother, to a waking ear; for instincts cannot work in the sleep, if
the Spirit speak, and the voice behind be heard, the soul knows what sound
it hears, but not otherways; it is but curiosity so to compare the evidence
by signs and marks of Sanctification, The holy Ghost speaks by marks of
Sanctification.
with that evidence, that comes from the Spirits immediate voice, or
testimony, so as the former should be less sure, fallible, conjecturall; and
the latter infallible, sure and efficaciously convincing. For the evidences are
both supernatural, certain, divine, and strongly convincing, if there be any
deception in either, it is because of the dullness of our apprehension, or our
imagination, which fancieth, we see, what we see not, or from our unbelief who
will not be convinced. For the Holy Ghost speaks the same thing, by his
operations of grace, in holy walking, that he speaks by either the Word
preached, or by the Word, and immediate voice of the Spirit, witnessing to our
Spirit; and there is the same authority revealing to us a thing hid, and the
same thing revealed; it maybe, there be a variation of the degrees, of light
and divine irradiation: Or the one may carry in to the soul a more deep
impression of God then the other, and the radiation of light in the subject,
may be more strong in the one, then in the other; but of themselves they are
both infallible, supernatural, and convincing.

It is doubted which of these evidences be more free, and partake more of the
nature of Grace. How An^i^omians compare the evidence from marks of
sanctification, and that which is from faith, together.
Antinomians conceive that an evidence by marks in our self is more selfie,
less free, and nearer to a seeking of assurance in our self, then that
evidence which resulteth from the immediate testimony of the Spirit. But the
ground they build on is false, and the superstructure is less sure. If it were
a matter of giving and receiving, or of wages and work, it were something, but
its a matter of mere knowledge, God reveiling our condition to us one way, not
another. Possibly the more external, the more immediate, and far a thing be
from a condition, even of Grace, the more free, as the election to Glory, the
paying of the ransom of Christ's blood, or the act of atonement are most free,
for they require not so much as the condition of faith wrought by the free
Grace of God; but Justification (say our Divines) requires faith, as a
condition. And here God may keep his hands free of any knot, or obligation of
a condition; and it would seem that the immediate testimony of the Spirit,
Degrees of freedom of grace.
is more free then evidence from inherent marks, the wind seems to be freer
in its motion, which has not a restriction to fixed causes, rather at this
hour, then at that; the Sea again in its ebbing and flowing, and the Sun in
its rising and going down, are more fettered to set times, and condition of
natural causes, yet all these detract nothing from the freedom of God the
creator, in his concurring with these causes; nor do conditions that are
wrought in us irresistably by the grace of God, lay any tie on that
independent, sovereign, and high freedom of Grace, which does no less
justify, and save us freely, then choose us to glory, and redeem us with the
same freedom, without p^ice and hire: Antinomians who deny all preparations
before faith, must hold that faith ^loweth from natural principles in us, as
Pelagi^ns of old aid.
only I will mind Libertines, who deny that Justification, the covenant of
grace and salvation, have any the most gracious conditions in us; for that
should obscure the freedom of Grace, (they say) all within the visible Church,
without aany preparations, are immediately to believe salvation and remission of
sins to themselves in particular. But I hope, Faith is a work of free Grace,
and must presuppose, conversion and a new heart, as an essential condition,
else with Pelagians, they must say, that out of the principles of nature, all
are to believe; and this obscureth far more the freedom of the grace of God
working Faith in us, then all the conditions of Grace, which we hold to be
subservient, not contrary to the freedom of grace.

Object. 5. We ought to believe, till we be persuaded that we believe. Ephesians.
1.13. In whom after ye believed, ye were sealed. The way to be warm, is not
only to ask for a fire, or whether there be a fire or no, or to hold out the
hands a little toward it, and away, and wish for a greater; but to stand close
to that fire, and gather heat.

Answ. 1. That believing brings persuasion, I doubt not; but not such a
sealing with the broad and great seal of heaven, The broad seal of the Spirit
pulls no man beyond all hazard of doubting, is Libertines dream.
as excludes all doubting, as Antinomians teach; nor does the place prove it.
For these who can flee with such strong wings, and are above all doubting, (1.)
need not Christ's intercession, that their faith fail not, they are above, and
beyond the Sphere of all obligation to Grace: nor (2.) need they pray, Lead us
not into temptation. Nor (3.) need they bear in meekness, the overtaken
weak ones, who trip and stumble unawares, considering lest they also be
tempted, Gal. 6.1. (4.) The faith of the strongest is not full Moon, or
incapable of growing, Phil. 3.12. (5.) There is need of praising of Grace, for
the prevailing victory of a faith beyond doubting. (6.) Nor need such pray
Christ to increase their faith. Judge then of Libertines, who talk of a broad
seal, of perfect assurance, and say, Rise, reign, er, 42.
There is no assurance true and right, unless it be without fear and doubting.

2. The way to be warm at a painted fire, such as is the immediate revealing
of Christ to an unconverted sinner, never humbled, nor despairing of himself,
which is the Libertines dead faith, is not the way to be warmed, nor are we to
believe in Christ, but in Christ's own way and order: and its safe to call in
question, whether such a painted fire be fire; nor are we to go on in this
believing, till we be persuaded that we believe, truly this is no
Gospel-secret.

If Libertines say, its unpossible to believe, but we must despair in our
selves. I answer, So I believe; but then must it follow, that Libertines
deceive, and are deceived, when they teach, that sinners as sinners are to
believe, because sinners despairing of salvation in themselves, must be fewer
in number, then sinners as sinners; for sinners as sinners, comprehends
Pharisees, and all secure and malicious slaves of hell; but selfe-despairing
sinners include not any such, far less include they all sinners, they be
only such sinners as are half sick, looking a far off, with half an eye
to Jesus Christ, not daring fully to make out to Jesus Christ; proud Pharisees
despair not of salvation in themselves, for then they should not be proud
Pharisees in so far; but Libertines teach us, that Pharisees remaining
Pharisees, without any preparations going before, are immediately to believe in
Christ, if they say, Selfe-despaire is an essential part of Faith, not a
preparation going before faith; they err: Judas, Cain, despair of salvation
both in themselves and in Christ, yet have they not any essential part of
saving faith, nor can any essential part of saving faith be in such, nor can
any come to Christ, and believe in him, whil first they know sin by the law,
and their mouth be stopped, that the law cannot justify nor save them, Rom..19
20, 21. An^ M^. Eaton and the Antinomians that are not mere Familists, and
Enthysiasts rejecting all written Scripture, do also grant this; then it must
be unpossible, that any can believe, but some preparation foregoing there must
be; and because all sinners as sinners have not such preparation, all sinners
as sinners are not at the first clap, to believe in the soul Physician Christ,
but only such as in Christ's order are plowed, ere Christ sow on them, and
selfe-condemned ere they believe in Christ.

Object. 6. We are no more to question our faith, then we ought to question
Christ the foundation of our faith, Saltmarsh 65.
for salvation to the soul in particular is destroyed by unbelief, they
entered not in because of unbeleefe: The word profitted not, being not mixed
with faith.

Answ. 1. We cannot question Christ, more then we can question whether God be
God; but we may examine Paul's Doctrine, Doubting whether the sound believers
^aith be true or not, is not that unbeleefe that excludes us out of the
eternal rest.
as the Beroans did; we may try our own faith, if it can hold water. If some
would wash their false coin, and bring it to the touchstone, the false
metal would be seen. 2. The unbeleefe in weak ones doubting of their faith,
is not that which destroys salvation, and excludes men out of the holy Land:
they are cruel to weak reeds, who exclude them out of heaven, because in their
mis-judging distempers they exclude themselves; were Christ as cruel to a
faint believer, who is sick of mis-givings, as he is to himself, who could be
saved? But a believer may appeal from himself ill-informed, and doubting
groundlesly, to meek Jesus well-informed, and judging aright a weak reed, to be
a reed; a sick believer, and a swouning faith, to be a believer, and a faith,
that will bear a soul to heaven. A weak hackney, if spritie, may accomplish a
great journey.

Object. 7. Satan puts us clean back here; we are proving o^^ faith by our
works, Ibid. 69.
when as no works can be proved solidly good, but by our faith; for without
faith its unpossible to please God. We know that every piece of money is
valued according to the image and superscription; if Caesar be not there, though
it be silver, yet it is not coin, it is not so current: So there is not any
thing of Sanctification current, and of true practical use and comfort to a
believer, if Christ be not there. Crispe Crisp. Vol. 2. Ser. XV.
says, Sanctification and good works are litigious grounds of our faith. This
bordereth with the language of Libertines. Rise, reign, er, 72.
It is a fundamental and soule-damning error to make sanctification an
evidence of justification. And Ibid. 73.
Christ's work of grace can no more distinguish between an hypocrite and a
Saint, then the rain that falls from heaven, between the just and the unjust.
And Er. 75.
The Spirit gives such full evidence of my good estate spiritually, that I have
no need to be tried by the fruits of sanctification, this were to light a
candle to the sun.

Answ. 1. That which the Spirit of God calls saving knowledge, 1 John 3.14.
Hereby know we, etc. 1 John 2.3, 4, 5. that does Libertines affirm to be a
policy of Satan, leading us back again, and a soule-condemning error. (2) 1 John 3.10. In this are the children of God manifest, Scriptures and reasons
from thence make good that we know our justification by our sanctification.
and the children of the Devil: whosoever does not righteousness, is not of
God, neither he that loves not his brother. This is some other difference
then the rain can make between the just and the unjust. And 1 John 5.8. And
there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the
blood; and these three agree in one. And that we may know that the Spirit is
in us, is evident, 1 John 4.12, 13. No man has seen God at any time. If we
love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us. H^reby
we know that we dwell in him, and he in us; because he has given us of his
Spirit. Now, 1 John 3.3. Every man that has this hope in him, purifieth
himself, even as he is pure. And, Romans 8.1. There is therefore now no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, which walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit. 2 Cor. 7.1. Having therefore these promises (dearly
beloved) let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and
Spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Hence we argue, Whoever
walks after the Spirit, must know his Guide that leads the sons of God,
Romans 8.14. and whoever purges himself, and loves his brother, and perfecteth
holiness in the fear of God, he must know that he so does; but he that does
walk so, knows that he is in Christ, freed from condemnation, and that God
dwells in him; for it is express Scripture: He that is holy, may know he
is chosen to be holy, Ephesians. 1.4. Now, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of
Gods chosen? It is God that justifies, Romans 8.33. He that is conformed to the
image of his Son, and called, may know that he is predestined thereunto,
Romans 8.29, 30. and shall be glorified. Now, Crispe Ser. 15. Vol. 2.
labors to prove, that these which commonly go for marks and infallible
signs of our justification and interest in Christ, which are universal
obedience, sincerity, love to the brethren, Libertines say there be no m^rks in
the children of God of true sanctification, which can difference them from
hypocrites.
are either found in no man in their perfection, or they be such marks as agree
to good and bad, to hypocrites and Saints; and so are not infallible marks;
just as the falling of rain, and the shining of the sun, does not difference
between just and unjust men, because both have a like portion and share in
sun and rain. Now for the former reason; Faith and the light of it is
unperfect, capable of accession, and so tainted with sin: and if this be a
strong reason, it cannot give assurance; which Libertines do not all hold. The
other is the saying of Papists, teaching us to doubt of our salvation, because
there be such shifts, wiles, circuits, and lurking places in a man's heart, that
he can give no infallible judgment, with any divine certainty, of himself or
his own spiritual state. But is there not so much darkness, so much night
and blindness in our mind, as in admitting of the light of immediate
witnessing of the Spirit, (which they call, the Broad-seale of heaven) we may
no less be deceived, then we are in the light that resulteth from our signs
of sanctification? There is a like darkness, and no less delusions, from the
white Spirits, the day-light-ghosts and Angels of Enthusiasts, and dumb and
Scripture-lesse inspirations, then in black Spirits. But sure we walk not in
the ways of sanctification sleeping, Works of sanctification are not doubtsome
warrants and evidences of justification.
nor does the Spirit perfect holiness, in the Saints, as in a night-dreame;
we being led with fancy as frantic men are. Shall the Saints, when they
attest the Lord of their sincere desire and unfeigned intentions, though mixed
with great weakness, bring before God their integrity, and their rejoicing of
a good conscience, as Paul, the Apostles, Peter, John, James; Lord, thou
know that I love thee; David, who desired God might try him; Job, Ezekiah,
Jeremiah, Daniel, etc. hold forth to God their conjectures, fancies, and such
moth-eaten and rotten signs of their justification, as Crispe, and others say
may be, and were in Pharisees, in Papists, Hypocrites, and bloody Oppressors,
carnal Jews following the righteousness of the Law, Publicans, Heathen,
Harlots, all the wicked Sects? for Crispe says, All these have your marks Vol.
2. Ser. XV. page 434, 435, 436, 437 438, 439, 440 441, etc.
of sanctification, such as are universal obedience, sincerity, zeal for God,
love to the brethren. Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous before God,
walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless, Luke
1.6. was this such a righteousness, attested by the Holy Ghost, as is in Paul
a persecuter, in Heathens, in Pharisees, in carnal Jews? I grant it was not
that righteousness of God through faith, Phil. 3. yet it was a fruit and
infallible sign of that righteousness, and such as did prove them to be in
Christ. And 2. all our acts of sanctification are no acts, no infallible marks
of justification to my soul, except they be done in faith; yea, without faith
they are sin, Romans 14.23. but when I find they are done in faith, they add a
further degree of evidence and certitude, that they argue me to have saving
faith and interest in Christ, as in the Lord my righteousness, Jer. 23.6. for
that is his name. And this reason does conclude, its unlawful to seek any
ground of assurance in sanctification, except we would with Papists argue in a
circle, thus, How know you that your works are signs of justification? Because
they are stamped with faith. And how know you that your justification and faith
are not counterfeit? By your works.

But this is not the Papists circle, because works to my sense and spiritual
discerning, may, Works may prove faith, and faith works to be done in Christ
and do add evidence and light to faith, and faith adds evidence and light
to works; as we prove the cause from the effect, and the effect from the
cause, especially under desertion, without the fault of circular arguing; but
Papists believe the Scripture to be the word of God, because the Church says
so, else it should be no word of God, to them more then the Turks Alcaron; and
they believe that the Church says, that Scripture is the Word of God, because
the Scripture says, that the Church says so.

This is no proof at all, and a vain consequence, without Faith its unpossible
to please God, no work can be proved solidly Gods, without faith, but how
then follows it; Ergo, we cannot prove faith to be true from good works.
Saltmarsh can make no Logic out of this; nothing follows from this
antecedent, but ergo, by hypocritical works done without faith, we cannot
prove our faith to be true faith, valeat totum, the conclusion is not against
us. We acknowledge, except good works carry the stamp and image of faith,
they are not good works; but if they carry this stamp, as we presuppose they
do, in this debate, because works are more sensible to us then faith it
follows well, then we may know our faith by our works; and a believer doing
works in faith, and out of warmenesse of love to Christ, and a sincere sense
of his debt, he may be ignorant that he does them in faith, but a coal of
love to Christ, smoking in his soul, and the sincere sense of the debt that
love lays on him to do that; yea, and to swim through hell to pleasure
Christ, are ordinarily more sensible then faith, and led us to know, there must
be faith where these are.

3. Nor are ours litigious and disputable marks, except when our darkness
raises disputes, more then the Gospel it self, is litigious; for men of
corrupt minds, raise doubts against the Gospel, and weak believers sometime
would argue themselves out of faith, Christ, out of imputed righteousness,
election of grace and effectual calling; yet are not these litigious points,
and say, that the evidence of the Spirit be as light and evident as the Sun
light in it self: so is the Gospel, yet are we to seek evidences for our
faith and peace, in such marks as the Holy Ghost has made way-markes to
heaven; by this we know, etc. but we build our knowledge and sense on these
marks, as on secondary pillars and helps, which a divine, and supernatural
certitude, furnishes, though without the influence of the Spirit, they shine
not evidently to us; but our faith rests on the testimony of the Spirit,
witnessing to our hearts; and this is not to bring a candle to give light to
the Sun; but to add the light of supernatural sense, to the light of divine
faith; else they may as well say, that the confirming evidence that comes to
our sense from the Sacraments, adds some thing to the Word, which is a light,
and a Sunne-light to our eyes, if we did confide in them, as causes of our
justification, it were Pharisaicall: but divine motives, and secondary grounds,
though they be mixed of themselves with sinful imperfections, may be, by
divine Institution, helps and confirmatory grounds of our faith and joy; and
the Scripture says so, as we heard alleged.

The question proposed by F. Cornewell I shall not father upon that learned and
godly Divine, Master Cotton: Whether a man may evidence his justification by
his Sanctification: he should have added, whether he may evidence to himself,
or his own conscience, his justification; for that so, he may evidence i^, The
question mistated by M. Cornwell.
in a conjecturall way to others, no man doubts. 2. The question is mistated;
as if Sanctification did formally evidence Justification, as Justification, in
abstracto, and Faith in its actual working; its enough against Antinomians, if
it evidence to the sense of the person, that he is in the state of
justification, and that he has faith to lay hold on Christ's righteousness,
when he esteems the Saints precious, Wh^t wa^ Sanctifi^^^^on does evidence
Justification.
and places his delight in them. Sanctification does not as Libertines would
imagine, evidence justification, as faith does evidence it, with such a sort of
clearenesse, as light evidenceth colors, making them actually visible; now
light is no sign or evident mark of colors. Love and works of
sanctification do not so evidence justification; as if justification were the
object of good works; that way faith does evidence justification, but
sanctification does evidence justification to be in the soul, where
sanctification is, though it does not render justification actually visible to
the soul, as light makes colors to be actually visible; or as faith by the
light of the Spirit, renders justification visible: for even as smoke
evidenceth there is fire, there where smoke is, though smoke render no fire
visible to the eye; and the moving o^ the pulse evidenceth that there is yet
life, though the man be i^ a swoone, and no other acts of life do appear to
the eye, an^ the morning star in the East when its dark, evidenceth tha^ the
Sun shall shortly rise, yet it makes not the Sun visibl^ to the eye; and
the streams prove there is an head-spring, whence these streams issue; yet
they show not in what part of the earth the head-spring is; so as to make it
visible to the eye: so does Sanctification give evidence of Justification,
only as marks, signs, and gracious effects gives evidence of the cause; as
when I find love in my soul, and a care to please God in all things; and this
I may know to be in me, from the reflect light of the Spirit, and from these
I know there is faith in me, and justification, though I feel not the
operation of faith in the mean time, yet the effect and sign makes a report
of the cause; as acts of life, eating and drinking, and walking in me does
assure me, that I have the life of nature. So the vital acts of the life of
Faith do, as signs and effects give evidences of the cause and fountain; yet
there is no necessity that with the same light, by which I know the effect, I
know the cause; because this is but a light of arguing, and of heavenly Logic,
by which we know (by the light of the Spirits arguing) that we know God, by the
light of Faith; because we keep his Commandments: and know arguitive, by Gods
Logic, that we are translated from death to life, because we love the
Brethren; in effect we know, rather the person must be justified, in whom
these gracious evidences are, by hearsay, report, or consequence; then we
know, or see justification it self, in abstracto, or faith it self; but the
light of faith, the testimony of the Spirit, by the operation of free Grace,
will cause us, as it were, with our eyes see justification and faith, not by
report, but as we see the Sun light. A 3. Error there is in the state of the
question, that never a Protestant Divine ( Arminians and Socinians I disclame,
as no Protestants) made either Sanctification a cause of Justification, but an
effect; nor common Sanctification that goes before Justification, and union
with Christ, void of all feeling of our need of Christ, an evident sign of
Justification. If Master Cornewell dream, that we thus heighten preparations
before conversion, as he seems in his Arguments, against gracious conditions
in the soul, before faith; he knows not our mind; and as other Antinomians
do, refutes he knows not what. And 4. We had never a question with
Antinomians, touching the first assurance of justification, such as is proper
to the light of faith. He might have spared all his Arguments, to prove that
we are first assured of our justification by faith, not by good works; For we
grant the arguments of one sort of assurance, which is proper to Faith; and
they prove nothing against another sort of assurance; by signs and effects,
which is also Divine. To Antinomians 1. to be justified by Faith; 2. and to
come to the sense and knowledge of justification, which either was from
eternity, as some say; or when Christ dyed on the Cross, as others; or when
we first take life in the womb, as a third sort dream: And 3. to be assured
of our justification, are all one. And so to be justified by faith, Peace from
justification, and peace from sanctification how different.
should be, to be justified by works, which they in their conscience know, we
are as far against, as any men. But they should remember, that the peace and
comfort that the Saints extract out of their holy walking, is a far other
peace, then that peace which is the natural issue of justification, of which
Paul says, Romans 5.1. Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace (...)
with God through Jesus Christ our Lord; and the peace that issues from our
holy walking; or at least, if they be the same peace, it comes not one and the
same way. For 1. Peace which is the fruit of justification, is a peace in the
court of God, as the peace that a broken man has in the court of justice, when
he knows his Surety has paid the debts; he dare look Justice in the face
without any war, having assurance that war is removed, and enmity with God
cried down, and all sins are freely pardoned; the peace that issues from our
holy walking is in the court of conscience, and sense of sincerity, and
straightness of walking; and is grounded on holy walking, as on a secondary
help; and if there were not some confidence, that the sinfulness of these
works, are freely pardoned, there should be little peace at all. 2. The former
peace is immediately from pardon, that is the true cause of peace; the latter
from signs, which dwell as neighbors with pardon; and is only peace, as it
has a necessary relation to pardon; and is resolved in some promise of God,
and not as it is a work of our own: as hungering for Christ, as its not the
ground of pardon, so its not the ground of peace that issues from pardon; yet
it is the ground of a comfortable word of promise, Blessed are they that hunger
and thirst for Righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. And the like, I
say, of assurance, comfort, joy, that result from holy walking, and from
justifying faith; we never placed good works in so eminent a place, as to
ascribe these same effects to them, and to faith in Christ.

Then Master Cornewell loses his labor to prove, that God does not first
declare and pronounce us righteous, upon sight and evidence of our
sanctification, which is a righteousness of our own. For to pronounce us
righteous, is to justify us; and does Master Cornewell know any Protestant
Divines, who teach that God, either first or last does justify us for our
inherent Sanctification?

Then Mr. Cornwell does confound evidence and assurance of justification, as if
they were both one. To be ^ssured of righteo^snesse, and to know that we are in
that state, are two diffire^t things,
For many Saints have assurance of justification, so far as they are assuredly
justified, and doubt much of their estate, through want of evidence: as many
believe, and many times doubt, whether they believe or no. Therefore the
Argument to prove Abraham's assurance of justification, Romans 4. cannot conclude,
that Abraham had not divine evidence and assurance, that he was justified, by
his holy walking, as by signs and fruits of faith. The assurance of Christ's
righteousness is a direct act of faith, apprehending imputed righteousness:
the evidence of our justification we now speak of, is the reflect light, not by
which we are justified, but by which we know that we are justified: and the
Argument that proves the one, cannot prove the other.

Object. 3. If the promise be made sure of God unto faith, Cornwell* page 12.
of grace, then it is not first made sure of faith unto works;

But the promise is made sure of God, to faith, out of grace, Romans 4.5. to him
that works not, but believes: The opposition between grace and works, Romans
11.6. Romans 4.4. is not only between grace and the merits of works, but between
grace and the debt due to works: Now to him that works, is the reward not
reckoned of grace, but of debt, Romans 4.4. Right of promise makes a work to be
of debt, not of grace.

Answ. The promise is made of righteousness and free justification by the
grace of Christ; by the promise, that is, by the promised seed, Romans 4. but
these places speak not one word of the reflect evidence that a man has in his
own soul, by which he knows in himself he is justified. This Disputer
knows not what he says: M Cornwell proves what is not in question.
he proves we have no promise to be justified by works, nor any assurance
thereof from working; that is not the question now; but he should prove, that
we cannot know and make evident to our own souls that we are assuredly
justified, and that we believe, when we bring forth the fruits of faith: There
is one cause why there is life in this tree, and another cause, why all that
pass by, and the tree it self, (if we suppose it to be capable of reason, as
man is) does know it has life and sweet sap: this latter is known to the tree
and to others, by bringing forth good fruit. As if there may not be sundry
causes, (...) and (...), of the being of a thing, and to know the being of a
thing: Bringing forth fruit is not the cause of the life of the tree, good
works are not the cause of our justification; but we know well the tree has
life, when we see it brings forth fruit; as we know we are justified, and in
Christ, when we walk after the Spirit, and not after the flesh. The whole
Argument is of a direct assurance, called certitudo entis, or of the object:
The Question is, touching reflect certainty, how persons may be sure in their
own conscience, called certitudo mentis; and so it concludes not the Question.

Many things are made over to us, by the debt of promise, that a^e ours ou^ of
free gra^c also.
2. Its Antinomian doctrine to make opposition between the Gospel promise, and
the debt of the promise: the debt of works, Romans 4. and Romans 11. is Law-debt
due to the worker, as an hireling is worthy of his wages, because he has done
the work perfectly, according to a covenant made with his Master: In which
case, no man says the wages of the labourer is a free-gift. But if whatever
the Lord promise to us in the Gospel, make God a debtor, and the thing promised
to be debt, then let Antinomians speak out, for they say, Rise, reign, and
ruin, cr^.
The whole letter of Scripture (and so of the whole Gospel-promises) hold forth
a covenant of works, contrary to Gal. 4. where there be two covenants, one of
works, another of grace; and contrary to the promises of grace in the Gospel,
Joh. 2.16. Heb. 8.10, 11, 12. Mat. 11.28. 1 Timothy.1.15. (2) All the promises of
the Gospel must make salvation debt: was not Christ promised in the Prophets to
the lost world? Romans 1.2. The inheritance is not by Law, but by promise, Gal.
3.17, 18. Romans 9.8, 9. Luke 1.45, 54, 55, 68, 69, 70. Is Christ come to save
sinners by debt, or by grace? is salvation debt? its promised. Is not
righteousness promised to him that believes, Romans 4.5? then righteousness
must be debt, and so not of grace; for Cornwell tells us, Page 13. The right
which a man has by promise to a work, makes the assurance of the promise but
of debt unto him; and then the promise is not sure to him out of grace.
Conditional Gospel-promises argue free grace, not debt.
Then all the promises of an established Kingdom to David, and his seed, if
they should keep Gods commandments, all the blessings and salvation promised
to believers in the Old and New Testament, so they bring forth the fruits of a
lively faith, are mercies of debt, not of free grace. I well remember that the
Famulists Rise, reign, er. 62.
say, It is dangerous to close with Christ in a promise. And Rise, er. 38.
There can be no true closing with Christ in a promise that has a
qualification or condition expressed. I rather believe the Holy Ghost, Ho,
every one that thirsts, come to the water, come buy wine and milk without
money and without price, Isai. 55.1. And if any man thirst, let him come to me
and drink, Joh. 7.37. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life
freely, Revel. 22.17. Mar. 1.15. If Cornwell can free willing, thirsting,
desiring, from working, he has much divinity: Yet the water of life and
salvation promised to such cannot be debt, but free grace; for they are
promised to these freely, and to be bestowed without money. Of the same strain
is the fourth Argument of Cornwell.

Object. 5. When sanctification is not evident, Cornwell, page 15.
it cannot be an evidence of justification:

But when justification is hidden and doubtful, sanctification is not evident;

Therefore sanctification cannot be our first evidence of justification.

The Minor is proved, Because when faith is hidden and doubtful,
sanctification is not evident: But when justification is hidden and doubtful,
faith is hidden and doubtful; therefore when justification is hidden and
doubtful, sanctification is not evident.

The proof of the Major is, 1. Faith is the evidence of things not seen; and
so makes all things evident: then when faith is hidden, what can be clear?

2. Because no sanctification can be pure and sincere, but when it is wrought
in faith; and so it cannot be evident, but when it clearly appears to be
wrought in faith.

Answ. 1. There is in the Conclusion (first) the first evidence of
justification, that is not in the premises, against all art. The Proposition,
When sanctification is not evident, it cannot be an evidence of justification,
is weak, and weakly proved: For there is a twofold evidence, one of sense and
feeling spiritual, another of faith. When sanctification wants the evidence of
faith, that I cannot believe salvation from mine own Christian walking, yet
may the soul have evidence of feeling and sense, that we trust we have a good
conscience in all things, willing to live honestly, Heb. 13.18. and we dare
say, Lord, we delight to do thy will, and long for thee, O Lord, as the
night-watch watches for the morning; and, whom have we in heaven but thee,
etc. and can out of sense give a testimony of our selves, yea, and can place
all our delight in the excellent ones, Psalm. 16.3. and 119.62. 1 John 3.14. so
as the heart warmes, when we see the Saints; and in this case sanctification is
evident, when remission of sins may be under cloud; else this Argument does
conclude, if it have any feet, that sanctification ever and at all times is
dark, when justification is dark; and so sanctification is never an evidence of
justification, but when justification is evident: So the wisdom of God is
taxed, as if he would never have us to know that we are translated from death
to life, because we love the brethren, but when we evidently know, we are
thus translated, though we had no love to the brethren: Then the Lord has
provided a candle for his weak ones, by this Argument, when it is daylight;
but has denied any candlelight, moonlight, or starlight, when it is dark
night. 2. The Major is not proved: Faith is not so the evidence of all things,
as that it makes all things evident to our spiritual sense; for Cornwell
grants, faith may be hidden; then it can evidence nothing when it is is
hidden. Love to the brethren, keeping of his commandments, yield sensible
evidences that we are justified, even when faith is not evident; and how many
are convinced they have undoubted marks of faith and justification, who doubt
of their faith and justification? And so the Minor and Probation of it is
false; for it is most false, that when faith is hidden and doubtful,
sanctification is not evident: this is asserted gratis, not proved: As if ye
would say, Ever when the Wellhead is hidden, the streams are not seen; when
the sap and life of the tree is not seen, but hidden, the apples, leaves and
blossoms are not evident. This is a begging of the conclusion: for then should
a man never, neither first nor last, know that he is translated from death to
life, because he loves the brethren: Why? Because when translation from death
to life, or when faith and justification is hidden, the love to the brethren,
and all the works of sanctification are hidden; says this Author.

3. The second proof of the Major is lame; Sanctification is never pure and
sincere, without faith, (says he;) Ergo, It cannot be evident, but when it
appears to be wrought in faith. The consequence is null; just like this,
Sweet streams cannot flow but from a sweet spring; ergo, It cannot be evident
and clear to my taste that the streams are sweet, except I taste the water at
the fountaine-head, and see it with mine eyes; and my taste cannot discern the
sweetness of the fruit, except my senses were within the trunk or body of the
true, to feel, see, and taste the sap of life, from whence the fruit comes.
Yea, the contrary consequence is true, because I smell sincerity, love, single
intentions to please God in my works of sanctification; therefore I know they
came from Faith; so the Holy Ghost should delude us, when he says, We know,
we know, or believe in Christ, because we keep his commandments. Ergo, We
cannot know this, except it be evident, that our keeping of his Commandment
come from faith, and the knowledge of God.

Object. 6. Such a Faith as a Practical Syllogism can make, is not a faith
wrought by the Lords almighty power; Cornwell pa. 16.17.18*
for the conclusion follows, but from the strength of reasonings, not from
the power of God, by which alone divine things are wrought, Ephesians. 1.19, 20.
Col. 2.20.

But faith wrought by a word and a work, and the light of a renewed
conscience, without the testimony of the Spirit, is such a faith as a
practical Syllogism can make: Ergo, such a faith so wrought, is not wrought
by the Lords almighty power.

The Minor is proved, because all the three, the Word, the Work, and the light
of Conscience, are all created blessings and gifts, and therefore cannot
produce of themselves a word of almighty power; and the word of it self is a
dead letter, the work is less: for faith comes by hearing a word, not by a
work.

Answ. When Master Cornwell says, By the power of God alone, Divine things
(such as faith that lays hold on Christ's righteousness) are wrought, Ephesians.
1.19. Col. 2.20. he excludes the ministry of the Gospel, and all the
promises thereof, for they are created things, and so they have no hand nor
influence in begetting faith. Antinomians will have us believe, that Paul,
Ephesians. 1.19.20. Col. 1.20. thinks no ministry of the Word, nor any hearing of
the preached Word, begets faith; contrary to Romans 1.16. Romans 10.17. but by
the only immediate power of the Spirit we are converted without the Word. Nor
is here that which is in question concluded; never Protestant Divine taught,
that without the actual influence of omnipotent Grace, can faith or spiritual
sense that we are justified, be produced by the Word, work, or created light
alone; nor can the corn grow alone by power in the earth, clouds, or rain;
nor any Creature move without the actual influence of the omnipotent Lord, in
whom we move: therefore by this reason we could not know that the Sun shall
rise, by the rising of the morning star; nor can we have any supernatural
sense, by our holy walking, contrary to Scripture, 1 John 2.3. 1 John 3.14. But
we know by this, all faith is ascribed by Antinomians, to the immediate
testimony and Enthusiasticall inspiration of the Spirit, as for the searching
of Scripture (say Rise, er. 39.
they) its not a sure way of searching and finding Christ, its but a dead
letter, Er. 9.
and holds forth a covenant of works in this letter; and therefore, with the
old Anabaptist, they will have no teaching by Scripture, but only teaching by
the Spirit. We hold that conditional promises are made to duties of
Sanctification, Gospel-promises are made to acts of Sanctification.
therefore we may have comfort and assurance from them, in our drooping
condition. Cornewell answers, Pap. 23.24, 25. The promises are not made to
us, as qualified with such duties of sanctification; for then they should
belong to us of debt, not out of Grace, Romans 4.4. But in respect of our Union
with Christ, in whom they are tendered to us, Antinomians deny all conditional
promises.
and fulfilled to us. Satisfaction is made to the thirsty, not for any right
his thirst might give him in the promise, but because it directs to Christ,
who fulfilleth the condition, and satisfies the soul, and the soul must
first have come to Christ, and gotten his first assurance from faith in Christ,
not from these conditions and duties.

Answ. 1. This is a yielding of the cause. We say there be promises of the
water made to thirsty souls, not as if the right, jus, law, merit, debt, that
we have to them, belonged to us, for the deed done, but for Jesus Christ
only. 2. Not as if we upon our strength, and the sweating of free will did
conquer both the condition and reward. 3. But yet we have comfort and
assurance, when we by grace perform the duty, that our faithful Lord, who
cannot lie, will fulfill his own promise. 4. He knows nothing of the Gospel,
who thinks not God by his promise comes under a sweet debt of free grace to
fulfill his own promise; and that this debt and grace are consistent. But
Antinomians breath smell of fl^shly liberty, for they tell us, Rise, reign er.

Conditional promises are Legal, contrary to the Gospel, Romans 10.9. John
3.16. Joh. 5.25. That Er. 38.
that its not safe to close with Christ in a conditional promise, if Er. 30.
any thing be concluded from water and blood, its rather damnation then
salvation. That Er. 69.

done in me by Jesus Christ, were it even Faith; For we are Er. 37.

Its incompatible with the Covenant of Grace, to join faith with it. To be Er.
2^.
justified by faith, is to be justified by works. That Er. 38.
to say there must be faith on man's part to receive the Covenant, is to
undermine Christ. Neither Cornwell, nor Saltmarsh, oppose these blasphemies,
but extol the Patrones of them in New England.

Father save me from this hour. What kind of faith was in Christ.

Christ had not says of justifying the sinner, but of justifying his cause.


Father is a word of Faith. But had Christ need of Faith?

Answ. Not of faith of confiding in him that justifies the sinner, except he
had faith of the justifying of his cause, in Gods acquitting him of
suretieship, when he had paid all; but he had faith of dependencie on God in
his trouble, that God would deliver him, and he was heard in that which he
feared. And Q. 2. how could there be a faith of dependencie in Christ, for he
was the same independent, God with the Father?

Answ. There were two relations in Christ; one as Viator, going toward glory,
How faith of dependencie was in Christ.
and leading many children with him to glory; another, as comprehensor, seeing
and enjoying God. 2. There were two sights in Christ, one of Vision, another of
Union; the sight of Union of two natures, is the cause of the sight of vision.
Christ being on his journey traveling toward glory, did with a faith of
dependency rest on God, as his Father, seeing and knowing that the Union could
not be dissolved; but as a Comprehensor, and one at the end of the race,
enjoying God in habit, there was no necessity, that Christ should always, Et
in omni differentia temporis, actually see and enjoy God, in an immediate
vision of glory.

For, 1. this implies no contradiction to the personal union, How the
not-seeing of God might stand with the personal union.
even as the seeing of God habitually, which is the most joyful sight
intelligible, and by necessity of nature, does produce joy and gladness, may,
and did consist in Christ, with groanings and sadness of Spirit, even before
his last sufferings: so the interruption for a time, of the actual vision of
God, might stand with Christ's personal happiness, as God-man. 2. If we
suppose there were just reasons, why God should command that Angels, and
glorified Spirits, should not actually see God for a time, there were no
repugnancy in this, to their true blessedness, so it fell not out through
their sins, no more then the Sun should lose any of its nature, if we
suppose God should command it to stand still, and to be covered with darkness
many days, as in Joshuahs time, it stood still in the firmament some hours,
and for a time was covered with darkeness at the suffering of Christ. What an
enterposed cloud of covering it was, or what a skreene did interrupt the flux
of the beams and rays of the Godhead from actual irradiation on the soul
and faculties, and powers of the soul of the man Christ is more then I can
determine. Certain it is, God was with the Manhood, and so near as to make
one person, but there was no actual shining on the powers of the soul, no
heat and warmness of joy, but as if his own infinite Sea of comfort were
dried up, he needed a drop of the borrowed comfort of an Angel from heaven. Now
whether this Angel, Luke 22.43. did wipe the sweat of blood off his holy body,
and really serve him that way; or if the Angel was sent with good words from
the Father, to comfort him, and say to this sense, O glorious Lord, courage,
peace, and joy, and salvation, shall come; thy Father has not forsaken thee
utterly: it cannot be known, but Luke says, an Angel appeared from heaven
(...), strengthening him. But it was admirable, A rare providence that Christ is
put to, (God save me.)
that the Lord of all consolation, should stand in need of consolation, and a
good word from his own creature; or that the great Lord, the Lawgiver, should
need the comfort of Prayer, or any Ordinance. O what a providence! what a world
is this! that God-man, sweet Jesus, is put to his knees, and his prayers with
it. Come see the Lord of life at a weak pass, he is at, God help me, at
Tears and sighing, God save me. This is more then if the whole light of the
Sun were extinguished, and it behoved to borrow light from a candle on earth;
and the whole Sea and Rivers dried up, and they behoved to beg some drops of
dew from the clouds to supply their want.

2. Christ himself refused comfort to himself: There was a sea of joy in
Christ, within him; but not one drop can issue out on the powers of his soul:
joy is sad, fairness black, faith fears and trembles; the infinite All,
lies under the drop of the comfort of a creature-nothing. Riches beggeth at
poverty's door; the light is dark, greenness withers and casts the
bloome, life makes prayers against the death of deaths, the glory and flower
of heaven stands sad and heavy at the jaws and mouth of hell. 3. Mat. 26.
He prayed to this sense, fallen on his face to the earth once, O my Father,
remove this cup; but he is not answered: He knocks the second time, O my
Father, if it be possible, remove this cup. O but here is a hard world, the
substantial Son of God knocking and lying on his face on the earth, and his
Father's door of glory fast bolted, the Son cannot get in. The like of this
providence, you never read, nor hear of. The natural Son of God cries with
tears and strong cries, with a sad, heavy and low Spirit to his Father; he
cannot get one word from heaven, nor half a glympse of the wonted glory that
was natural and due to him as God. O rare and sad dispensation! He must cry
the third time, O my Father, remove this cup. We storm, ^f the Lord do not
open his door at the first knock: O what hard thoughts have some of God, if a
flood of love issue not from his face at the first word! We are not to be
discouraged* when we are not heard at first.
but the Lords Saints are not to look for a providence of the honey drops of
the fattest consolations of heaven, in every ordinance of prayer and praises. O
what a sad administration, Psalm. 22.2. O my God, I cry in the day time, and
thou hear not; and in the night season, and am not silent. The Church
speaks sadly to God. What can be worse then this? Lam. 3.7. He has hedged
me about, that I cannot get out; he has made my chain heavy. Yet to open a
sad heart in the bosom of a friend, far more to God, is much ease; but here
is worse, Verse. 8. Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer. Psalm.
69.3. I am weary of crying, my throat is dried: mine eyes fail, while I wait
for my God. It is grace to put a construction of love and faith on the Lord's
not answering our desires. Prayers of the Saints not ever heard ^t first; and
the Reasons.
These experiences may silence us; 1. It may be good that the Lord answer, and
not good that he answer now: The Saints are often ripe for praying, when they
are unripe for the mercy of a real answer and help from God. God hear us now.
No doubt Abraham and Sarah both prayed for a son, many years before the one was
an hundred, the other ninety and nine years old; but it was not good that God
should hear them till it be a miracle, and a new way, and more then ordinary
providence they were answered. 3. God refuses never to hear us, for Moses
might possibly not know a reason, but it was better for him that he saw
afarre-off the good land, (more for faith and mortification and heavenly
mindedness, which he saw not) then that he should enter with the people into
that land, which he prayed for. 4. Not any of the Saints, considering that all
things work together but as they praise God that he has heard their prayers,
so they praise God in some things that their prayers lie at a fast bolted
door, and take it well in other things that he was displeased with them, and
so that they have cause to be humbled, that God did grant their desire. Let it
be that David prayed for a son, and God gave him Absalom; its a question, if
David had not cause to wish he had never been born. 5. God has equally
regulated and We are readier to pray then to praise.
when we are not heard, then we are forward to praise; because necessity and
straits can more easily obtain of us to pray, and set on moving the wheels of
our affections, then grace can keep our spiritual affections in heat of
motion, or limit and border our natural affections in praising, when they take
them to their wings. David, Psalm. 22. Psalm. 69. O my God, I cry night and day,
till my throat be dry in asking: but where does he say, O my God, I praise
night and day, till my throat be pained in praising, and my heart and eyes are
wasted and spent in submissive waiting for thee, and praising, for not hearing
me in some things. 6. God is equally gracious to his own, in not hearing and
granting, as in fulfilling their desires. 7. No man should take it Christ
Fathers door. 8. Heard or not heard, the prayers of faith have a gracious
issue, though the dross God, not to our selves; so prayers in faith are to be
offered God as God, though nothing return in our bosom, that God may be
extolled. Christ knew deliverance from this hour cannot be granted, yet he
prays. 10 Faith is required no less to believe the good that the Lord minds
us in not hearing Christ lives.

Father, save me from this hour. Christ bottometh his prayer on the sweetest
relation of a Father and a Son; Father, save me. So Joh. 17. Father, Christ
bottometh his prayers on the sweet relation of a Father.
glorify thy Son. Verse. 5. And now Father* glorify me. Six times in that
prayer h^^ uses this style. Mat. 11.25. I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven
and earth. Mat. 26. O my Father, remove this cup. His Father was great in his
esteem: none like his Father. Its a strong argument to Christ, to persuade an
hearing and a deliverance; and he was heard in that which he feared. He had
no end in his coming into the world, but to do the will of his Father* Joh.
5.30. (2.) Love is a sweet ingredient in prayer: the beloved Disciple John, who
only of all the Ev^ngelists sets down Christ's love-prayer, chap. 17* uses
it more frequently then any of the other three Ev^ngelists. 3. Propriety,
interest, and covenant relation is a sweet bottom and a strong ground for
prayer: So in praying has Christ taught us to say, Our Father which art in
heaven. And Psalm. 5.2. Hearken unto my voice, my King, and my God. 2 King.
19.19. Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee save us out of his hand.
Ezra bottometh his prayer on this, Chap. 9.6. O my God, I am ashamed and blush.
And Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 20.12. O our God, will thou no^ judge them?

Use.
In prayer consider what claim and interest you have to God, if you be a son,
and he a Father: Bastards cannot pray; strangers without the Covenant, Sons
only can pray.
and Heathen, having no right to God as their God and Father, may petition God
as a subdued people do their Conqueror, or as ravens cry to God, for food, and
as some howl upon their beds for corn and wine, Hos. 7.14. but they cannot
pray; for praying aright to God there is required not only gracious
ingredients in the action, but also a new state of adoption and filiation: many
speak words to God, who do not pray; many tell over their sins, who
confess not their sins to God; many speak good of God, who do not praise
God; many sigh and groan in praying, and have no deep sense of God or their
own sinful condition. Trees growing together make not always a wood. Ah, our
prayers, God knows, are often out of their right wits. Many cry, Father, to
God, but lie; for they are not sons, and their words are equivocation.
Thousands claim Father-ship in God, where there is no Sonship, nor
fundamentum in re, no ground in the thing it self. A new nature is that only
best bottom of praying, that takes it off from being a taking of the Name of
God in vain. All creatures speak of God, and, in their kind, to God; but only
a son can speak to God in prayer, as to his Father: calling upon God, with a
pouring out of the soul to him in Christ, is essential to sons.

Father, save me from this hour. Christ had no means of refuge safer and
surer in his trouble, when he knew not what to do, then prayer. Christ had
never a greater business in hand, The power of prayer.
then now he was to transact with God, and divine Justice, the Law of God, in
the weighty bargain of paying a ransom of dearest and preciousest blood, to
open the new way to heaven; he had to do with devils, principalities and
powers, and hell, to subdue devils, and death and hell, and to redeem his
Catholic Church from the second death; and he was to offer himself a
Sacrifice to God, through the eternal Spirit, for the sins of the whole
elect, and he must use prayer in all this great work. The greatest works have
been thus effectuated. For the dividing of the red sea, Moses cried to the
Lord, and it was done. Hezechiah obtains 15. years lease of his house of
clay from Jehovah his Landlord; and how? 2 King. 20.2. He turned his face to
the wall, and prayed. Jonah broke the prison of hell by prayer. Jeremiah had
many against him, Chap. 20.12. Unto thee (says he to the Lord) I have opened
my cause. Daniel, in his captivity; Ezra, when the people were under wrath;
Ester and her maids, when the Churches destruction is warped, and in weaving,
by prayer loose the captive bands, and break death's jaws. So low a man as
Job, Chap. 7.20. was, What shall I say to thee, O preserver of man? David
looks back to his prayers, Psalm. 34.6. and when he is overwhelmed, Psalm.
61.2. From the ends of the earth will I cry to thee, when my heart is
overwhelmed. To Elias this is the key that opens heaven. The last great work,
the perfecting of Mystical Christ, the judgeing of the world, the putting
crowns on the heads of so many thousand Kings, must have prayer to bring it to
pass: Even so come Lord Jesus. The putting and keeping on the crown on
Christ's head, is by prayer: his Sword, Crown and Scepter, stand and prosper by
this prayer, Thy Kingdom come. 2. Though Christ kn^w of his own deliverance,
and was sure of it, yet he will not have it but by prayer. Christ had Son
right to heaven, yet he will take a new gift of heaven, by prayer-right: Christ
makes prayer his new Charter. Joh. 17.5. Father, glorify me, with the glory
which I had with thee before the world was. Christ will have his Spouse, though
his by conquest, and the law of buying, and ransom, made over to him by a De
novo damus, Psalm. 2.8. Ask of me, (pray to me) and I will give thee the
Heathen. His Kingdoms pillar is prayer. Psalm. 72.15. Prayer also shall be made
for him continually, that his Throne may stand, and he may bear the Crown.
What, must we pray for Christ, he prays for us? Yea, we pray for Mystical
Christ, and his Crown. Its better to hold lands of Christ by prayer, then by
conquest or industry, by right of redemption or heritage; even the rich who
have broad lands, when the bread is at their lip, and on the table before them,
are to pray, Give us this day our daily bread. Have you wisdom, honor,
learning, parts, eloquence, godliness, grace, a good name, children, peace,
ease, pleasure, wife, houses, lands, see how ye got them; if not by prayer, in
so far they are unjustly purchased: the next best is to get a new charter of
them by prayer. I grant, conversion is not obtained by my praying, because an
unconverted man cannot pray, no more then the birth can pray it self out of
the mothers womb; yet its gotten by Christ's prayer. Some after sickness have
health, as robbers have the Travelers purse, they have them by spoil, not
through Christ, or any prayer-right: Victories, and subdued Cities, are better
taken and enjoyed by prayer, then by bribes or money.

Use. They know not the use of prayer, who teach, that we are not to pray
against that which cannot be avoided: So Libertines Rise, reign, ruin, ^r. 34.
say, we are not to pray against all sin, because it cannot be avoided: but
the old man must be in us, so long as we live, The Lord has so decreed the
end, as that he has ordained Prayer to be a necessary way to accomplish his
end. Yea, Paul 1 Thessalonians. 5.23. prays, that the very God of peace may sanctify
the Thessalonians throughout, (...). And we know that we cannot be free of
temptations in this life; yet pray we not to be led into temptation, which is
not so much, that the body of sin may be fully rooted out of us, and inherent
Sanctification may be perfected in this life, as that we may be delivered
from guilt and damnation, and from the power and dominion of sin, and that
prayer may be stairs up to the laying of the last stone of the new building;
yea though it was revealed to Peter, and the Disciples, that they should deny
Christ, and as sheep be scattered away. When the sword should awake against
the Shepherd, and this was unavoidable, in regard of the decree of God, and
fulfilling of the Scripture, Zach. 13. Yet were the Disciples to pray they
might be so guarded against that temptation, as they might not leave, and
forsake Christ in his sufferings.

Father save me from this hour, (...). That which Christ deprecateth has two
things considerable. 1. That his sufferings were so tymed, and de^ined, as they
should endure, but for an hour. 2. But it was a sad hour; there is an
Emphasis put on it, this hour.

1. Christ's sufferings are but houre-sufferings, Christ's sufferings but for an
hour.
we behoved to suffer eternally.

Object. Ergo, Christ suffered not that same punishment that we were to suffer
for sin, if Christ had never dyed for us.

Answ. 1. He suffered not all, Christ suffered ^ value, what we should have
suffered*
according to every accident and circumstance, that we were to suffer; it is
true, we should have suffered sinful despair, and there could be no
mixture of sin in his cup. 2. We should have suffered for ever, he exhausted
all the pain, and the curse in some few hours. But he suffered all that we
were to suffer according to the due equivalencie, worth, and substance of the
suffering. Christ paid (as we say) as good; A d^bter owes ten thousand
Millions to a Prince, to be paid in silver, at so many several terms; the
Surety of this broken debtor pays the whole sum at one term, and in gold,
the excellentest metal: it is the very same debt, and the same bond
acquitted, as if the sum had been paid by the chief debtor. Christ, by
paction, paid all in cumulo, at one term, and in excellent metal and coin,
being the dear blood of God. A Traitor is to die, and suffer hanging, or
headding for such a high point of treason; the Princes Son will die the same
death for him; only, by paction, he has, because of the eminency of his
person, a privilege, which the principal man had not: what if he be hanged
in a chain of Gold, and a crown on his head, or be beheaded with a
silver-Axe, it is the same satisfactory death for Law and justice, as if the
other had dyed like himself, there were some sparkles of the Majesty and
Crown of heaven, or some glistering Rubies and Diamonds did shine in Christ's
death, which could not have been in ours, and it was convenient it should be so,

2. Christ's time-sufferings is more then our eternal sufferings, because of
the dignity of his person. Its true, a poor man's life is as sweet and dear to
him Physically, Whence comes the dignity of Christ's sufferings.
as the life of a Prince, in the court of nature, in curia naturae; its a like
taking to every man; but in curia forensi, if we speak legally, and in
relation to many. David a king is more, for his royal place, to save and judge
many thousands, then ten thousand of the people. 2. A prince shamed and
disgraced, shall lose more honor, then a man of a low, The more exce^lent the
life of Christ was, the more heavy was the l^sse thereof.
poor, and base condition; the honor of a free, and just prince, is by a
thousand degrees more then the loss of honor in a wicked and base slave.
Sinners had little to lose in comparison of the Prince of life, like us in all
things, except sin.

3. The more noble privilege that life has, as the more immediate communion
with God, the loss of life is a greater loss. It is more for glorious Angels
to lose their happy and blessed life in the fruition of God, then for damned
Devils to lose their being, who are in chains of darkness. It is more for
the Spirits of just and perfect men, who are now up before the throne, to be
made miserable, to lose life, and such a life; glory, and such a glory, then
for slaves of hell, living in wickedness, to be thrust down to hell with
everlasting shame; It is more that the whole Sea, and all the Rivers be dried
up, then that one winter-fountaine be dried up. Christ had more to lose then
all Angels and Men, even to be suspended of the vision of God, for a time was
more then all that Angels and Men could lose for ever.

4. Its true, the influence meritorious from Christ's person on his suffering is
not real, but infinite in a moral estimation. But give me leave to think it
disputable, whether or no, it depends not on the free decree and pleasure of
God, that the punishment of sin be infinite in duration, or if it depend on
the nature of sin, and of divine justice; so as essentially God be
necessitated, not from any free decree (that is not properly necessity) but
essentially from that spotless and holy justice, which is essentially in him,
to punish those who equally sinned on earth, with equal torments in hell, and
all with eternal punishment. Yet notwithstanding all this, Christ, by his
death, not only exhausted, the infinite punishment due to us; as infinite
mountains of Sands can drink up all the finite Seas, Rivers, Brooks, and
fountains of the earth; but he purchased to us an infinite and eternal weight
of glory, by the worth of his merit, Now, by this there must be more in Christ's
death, then we can easily conceive: as it is more to bring Israel out of Egypt
only, and devide the red Sea, and to present them living men on the shore,
then to do that, and also to give them in peaceable possession, that good land
which flows with milk and honey; And its much to deliver a slave from
perpetual poverty, misery, and bondage; and not only that, but positively to
make him a rich, honorable, and glorious King; all which Christ by his blood
purchased to us: I leave it then to be disputed, whether Christ's sufferings had
not only a moral, meritorious and legal worthynesse, from the free act of
Gods acceptance, or also an intrinsecall worth and weight, real, and
intrinsecally congruous, and proportionable to the pain and shame he delivered
us from, and the glory that positively he conquesed for us. It is more to pay a
poor man's debts, then to make him rich.

Quest. 1. If Christ's sufferings were limited, in regard of time and hours,
why then could he suffer infinite punishment? How Christ's sufferings were were
limited, being infinite.
It involleth a contradiction to limit that which is infinite; and if an Angel
was sent to comfort him, it is like, God did extend mercy, and not unmixed and
satisfactory justice to him.

Answ. Moderation in suffering, as an Angel to comfort him, that not a bone of
him should be broken; that he should not lie three full days in the grave,
that his body should not see corruption; all these may well stand with
sufferings, that are infinite, morally, and from the worth of his noble and
glorious person, who is God blessed for ever. And it proves that all the
exactest justice that the Lord followed in the persuing Christ to the second
death for our sins, was not in inflicting punishment on Christ intensively,
and intrinsecally infinite, and which should be infinitely satisfactory, if we
lay aside all supposition of the punishment of the person suffering, who was
infinite, and of the free and voluntary acceptance of God.

Quest. 2. But then was not all the infiniteness of justice in punishing
Christ, not in inflicting pain infinitely and intensively extreme on him, but
in that the person was infinite* but the pain finite, both in time and
otherwise.

Answ. We hold that the suffering for the time, was so extreme, that he and
he only could ^ndure the infinit^ wrath of God; but whether all the
infiniteness of pain flow from this, that the person was infinite, or that
the pain was intrinsecally infinite, we desire not too curiously to determine:
Sure the infiniteness of his person conferred infiniteness of worth to his
merit; so as he purchased a Church by the blood of God, Act. 20.28. The Lord
Jesus gave himself for his Church, Ephesians. 5.25, 26. and a ransom for many,
Mat. 20.28. 1 Timothy 2.6. But I see no reason, why Christ's suffering should be
thought finite, because he suffered in some few days; then the Lords acts of
creating the world, of raising the dead, working of miracles, should be finite
acts, because absolved in a short time.

Our debt of love to Christ eternal.
Hence we cannot say, what an obligation is on us to Jesus Christ, love for
love is too little; because our drop of dew can (...) no proportion to his
infinite and vast sea of tender love to us. As Christ gave himself an infinite
ransom, by Law, for us; so he brought us under an infinite debt of love and
service to him. Christ paid all our debts of Law to infinite Justice, but we
shall never pay all our debt of love to him. O how many thousand talents are
we owing to Christ? And because glory is a love-engagement to Christ, the
longer we enjoy the glory of heaven, through millions of Ages, the debt to the
Lamb, to him that sits on the throne, will be the greater, and shall grow
infinitely: Praises for eternity shall take nothing down of the debt. Know, you
are the sworn and over-engaged and drowned debtors of Jesus.

Use 2. The sufferings of Mystical Christ are but for an hour; Our sufferings
short, and measured by yards
for a night, and joy in the morning; Psalm. 30.5. A little season, Revel. 6.11.
Three days, Hos. 6.1. A short time, and the vision will speak, and will not
tarry, Hab. 2.3. Heb. 10.37. Its but tribulation ten days, Revel. 2.10. And
which is shorter then all, a moment, 2 Cor. 4.17. and the shortest of all,
Isai. 54.7. a little moment. All the generations of the firstborn, that were
in great tribulations, and in the womb and belly of the red sea, are now come
off safe, and landed on the shore, and are now up before the throne in white,
triumphing with the Lamb; the hour is ended, some of them two thousand years
ago are eased of burning quick, of the sword, of the t^^th of lions. Jobs face
now is not foul with weeping; David's soul droopeth away and melts no more
with heaviness, as Psalm. 119. The traces of tears on Christ's fair face, are
fifteen hundred years ago washed off, and dried with his Fathers hand. Paul
is now beyond fears without, terrors within, and the sentence of death. All the
Martyrs now are above the fire, the faggo^s, the rack, the gibbet, the axe.
What thoughts has John Baptist now of beheading? or Steven of stoning to
death? the gashes and wounds of the stripes of the Apostles, scourged for the
name of Jesus, are over now: There is not one sigh, nor one t^are, nor one cry,
nor one death, now in heaven, all the former things are gone. Afflictions are
but a short transe, for an hour; our short-living sufferings will be over
quickly: We are near the shore. Our inch of winter shall wear out, there is
but a little bit of sour death before us; the Ceremonies of death's
approaching, of the noise of its feet, of its awsome and dreadful gloome, the
train of little images of death, the aching of bones, the stiches of heart, the
pain of the side, and such soft passing accidents, and the name are more then
death it self; and all these shall pass over quickly. We have not Centuries
nor Millions of years to suffer; he who limited a time to the Head Christ's
suffering, has set so many sand-glasses, and determined so many hours for all
our sufferings. Yea, 2. the gall in our cup must be weighed by Gods own hand:
Not a man killed more in the two Kingdoms, nor a house burnt, nor a scratch in
the body, nor one wound in the poor soldier of Christ, but all are numbered;
all go by ounces, grains, and scruples in heaven: there is a pair of just
and discreet balances before the throne. Crucify Christ, and pierce his side,
but not one of his bones can be broken: there be broken bones of two, one at
either side of him, within the breadth of five fingers to him. Cast Joseph in
the dungeon, but he must not die there. Cast Moses in the river, when he is
an infant, to die there, but Pharaoh's daughter must bring him up as a Prince.
Let Job's body be afflicted, but save his life. Imprison and scourge the
Apostles, but there is more to do, by them, ere they be killed. Make the
Kingdom of Judah weeping captives in Babylon, but the dry bones must live
again. Let David be sore afflicted, but he cannot be delivered unto death,
Psalm. 118. Let Daniel be a captive, and meat for the lions, but he must be
saved and honored. Appoint a day for the destruction of the Jews under
Ahashuerus, let death be shaped and warped, but they shall not dye. Love, even
the love of Christ, whose seven spirits full of wisdom are before the throne,
is a straight line, a just measure, and weighs all to the tempted souls,
that nothing shall go above their strength: no burden more then their back, no
poison, no death in their cup, no gall, more then the stomach can endure. You
may, O redeemed ones, refer your hell to Christ's love, and make over all your
sorrows to his will; see if he will destroy you. Let Christ be Moderator to
brew your cup, and Free Grace be Judge of your portion of Christ's cross, and
the cross may bruise your shoulder, ^weetn^ss of love (...) Christ measures
by yards, and weighs by ounces all the sufferings of the Saints.
it shall not grind you to powder. Had I ten eternities of weal or woe, I
durst refer them to the bowels of Christ's boundless mercy and free love*
shall I be the first that Christ's warm love over-killed and over-destroyed?
Christ's love is infallible, and above error. Fatherly providence determines all
so equally, measures all so straightly, tempereth all so sweetly, that black
death is suggered with white heaven, the sad grave a palace royal for a living
and victorious King: Apples of life grow on the saddest cross that the Saints
bear. The love of Christ has soft and silken fingers; love measures out
strokes, Revel. 3.19. And can love kill and destroy a son of Gods love?

Use 3.
The sufferings of Christ and the Saints be measured by hours: God is the
Creator of Time, and tempereth the horologe. My times are in thy hands, Psalm.
31. How long Ephraim a raw cake Christ, the shorter while. 3. You think long to
Britains hour, or the ten days of Pestilence and Sword on Scotland, We are
not to weary for length of time under suffering
or the vastations of Ireland, the wars, divisions, and new blasphemies of
England, gone, and over; but though we lose much time, and have bidden
farewell to yesterday, and shall never see it again, yet the Lord of time
loses not one moment; if through acquaintance and familiarity you may become
good friends with the cross, and bear it patiently: do for Christ, what you
will do, for time the former is an act of grace, the Lord will thank you for
it; the latter is the work of a carnal man, and will yield you no thanks. 4.
Life is a burden to you, when it has such a sour and sad convoy as heavy
afflictions; and the soul looks out at the windows of the clay-^rison, O when
will the Jailer come with the keys, and enlarge a prisoner? But why would you
fall out with a friend, for a foes cause. Christ has sewed them together for a
time; the vision will not tarry. Christ is on his journey, wait on, let
patience have its perfect work, its a floor that lies long under ground, it
is a long quarter between sowing and earing, yet Faith has ay a good crop.

This hour. Among all the hours that Christ had, this was the saddest. 1.
Christ saw that his life in this hour would be taken from him; it was
convenient that Christ, who was a man, like us in all things except sin,
should not be a stock in dying; but have actual pain and sense in the losing
of his life, Death sour and black to nature, and to Christ, for sund^^ reason^
for Christ had as much nature, though no corruption, as any man; and life is a
sweet inheritance, its natures excellent freehold, and no man is willingly,
and without one sigh or tear cast out of this freehold, and Christ's nature
was not brass or iron. Sorrow Hebr. 2.15. he might deliver them, who through
the fear of death, were all their life time subject to bondage. He must in our
nature put on actual fear to deliver the Saints, from habitual fear. Nature
cannot, without horror, and a wrinkle on the brow, look straight out on the
breadth of deaths black face. The Martyr^ kissed death, because the joy of
heaven took lodgeing in their soul, by anticipation before the term day, to
confirm the truth of God; but death has a sour bite, and sharp teeth, with
all its kind kisses. Yea, but Christ must read in the face of Death more
millions of curses, (a curse for every elect, single man, Deuteronomy. 27.26. Gal.
3.10.) then would have affrighted millions of Angels. O! but there was black
and doleful paintrie, hell; and thousand thousands of deaths in one, all
written on the visage of death, which was presented to Christ now; and when
there was a sad, dark, and thick courten drawn over Christ's heaven, it must
be a sour kiss, to lay his holy mouth to such a black face as death now had.
Christ was in sad earnest, when he said, Matthew. ^6.38. My soul is (...),
extremely, out of measure, heavy, even to the death. 3. Christ having well
tempered affections, his soul never being bolde-life-wasting, or casting away
the soul for a straw, is forbidden in the sixth Commandment. Christ sensible
of pain and death as a^y man.
He saw sad and bloody bills given in against him. O how many thousands of
sins, were all made his sins, by imputation? And Justice was to sell all
the elect over to Christ, and to deliver them all, by tale, to free grace, at
no cheaper rate, then the rendering of the soul of Christ, to harder then ten
thousand millions of ordinary deaths. Christ behoved to earne heaven at the
hardest cost, for all his own, with no less then the noble and eminent life
and blood of God; such a sum was never told down in heaven, before or after.
4. There is much weight on this hour, in regard of Christ's opposites;
Coelestis ira quos premit miseros fa^it. Humana nullos.

Gods Anger against Christ. Many edges of words in Christ's complaint, My God,
my God why have thou, etc.


three hoasts came against Christ, Heaven, Hell, Earth; any Adversary but God,
the enimity of men cannot make me, or any man formally miserable. There be
great edges and Emphasis, in these words, My God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me. Not a point, not a letter of them can be wanting, they are so full
and Emphatick. 1. My God, my God, the forsaking of Angels is nothing, that Men,
all men, friends, all my inward friends, forsake me, is not much; they do more
then forsake, they abhor Job their friend, Job. 19.19. that father and
mother, and all my mothers sons forsake me, is hard, yet tolerable, Psalm.
27.10. Psalm. 31.11. Psalm. 88.18. Yea, that mine own heart, and flesh forsake
me, is an ordinary may be) amongst men, Psalm. 73.26. But Gods forsaking of a
man is sad. 2. If he be a God in covenant with me; God, and then my God, that
is a warm word, with child of love; if he forsake me, it is hard: When our
own leave us, we forgive all the world to leave us. 3. In forsaking there is a
great Emphasis; any thing but unkindnesse, and change of heart Love is well
taken; this speaks against Faith; though Christ could not apprehend this; the
Lord cannot change, Christ's could not believe such a blasphemy, yet the
extremity of so sad a condition, offered so much to the humane and sinnelesse
and innocent sense of Christ, a change of dispensation. 4. Me, Why have thou
forsaken me, the son of thy love, thy the Lord of glory, who never offended
thee; but the relation of Christ to God, was admirable; he was as the sinner,
made sin for us; in this contest, the enimity of a Lion and a Leopard is
nothing, Hos. 13.7.8. the renting of the caul, of the web that goes about
the heart is but a shadow of pain, to the Lords running on a man as a Giant,
in fury and indignation. 2. Hell, and all the powers of darkness, came
against Christ in this hour, Col. 2.14, 15. (3.) All the earth, and his
dearest friends, stood aloof from his calamity; there was no shore on earth
to receive this ship-broken man.

In regard of that which was taken from Christ, it was a sad hour; which I
desire to be considered thus. Christ's soule-s^ff^rings most (...) how his life
was invaded.
1. The most spiritual life that ever was, the life of him who saw and enjoyed
God, in a personal union was veiled and covered. (1. Possession in many
degrees was lessened: but in jure, in right, and in the foundation not removed.
2. The sense and actual fruition God, in vision, was over-clouded, but life in
the fountain God, between God, remained the same to Christ, without any
shadow of variation or change. Gods hand was against Christ, his heart was for
him. 4. Hence his saddest sufferings were by God could not hate the Son of his
love, in a free dispensation, he persued in wrath the surety, and loved the
Son of God. 5. It cannot be determined The persona^^ union not dissolved in
C^rists suffering.
that went between the two united natures, the union personal still remaining
entire, how the Godhead suspended its divine and soule-rejoycing influence,
and the man Christ suffered to the bottom of the highest and deepest pain, to
the full satisfaction of divine justice. As it is easy to conceive how the
body in death, falls to dust, and ill smelling clay, and yet the soul dies
not, but how the soul suffers not, and is not sadned, is another thing. How
a Bird is not killed, and does flee out, and escape, and sing, when a window is
broken, with a great noise in the cage, is conceivable: but how the bird should
not suffer, or be affected with no affrightment, is harder to our apprehension;
and how ship-broken men may swime to the shore, and live, when the ship is
dashed in an hundredth pieces, is nothing hard; but that they should be nothing
affrighted, not touch the water, and yet come living to shore, is not so
obvious to our consideration. Yea, that the soul should remain united with
the body, in death, and the Ship sink, the passengers remaining in the ship,
and not be drowned, is a strange thing. The Lord suffered, and dyed; the Ship
was broken and did sink, the soul and body separated, and yet the Godhead
remained in a personal uinion, one with the Manhood, as our soul and body
remain together, while we live and subsist entire persons.

Use 1. Christ has suffered much in these sad hours for us: he has drunken
Hell dry to the bottom, Use 1.
and has left no Hell behind for us, Christ did (...) the whole Cross, we but
(...) bit^ and (...) of it.
Heb. 12.2. Jesus the Author and finisher of our faith, he has not only
suffered so much of the Cross, but he has suffered all the cross; he has
endured the cross, despised shame. In the original, the words are without any
Article, (...). It is as much as he has left no cross, no shame at all to be
suffered by us; and Phil. 2.8. He was obedient to the Father: he says not to
the death, but to death, even death of the Cross, (...). It holds forth to
us, that Christ suffered so much for us, as he has taken up to heaven with
him the great Cross, and has carried up with him, as it were, the great
death; and has left us nothing, or very little to suffer; and indeed Christ
never denied, but affirmed, he himself behoved to dye: but for the believer,
he expressly denies, he shall dye, and that with two negations, Joh. 11.26.
(...), He shall never in any sort, dye; and for our sufferings, Paul calls
them, Col. 1.24. (...), the remnants, the leavings, the dregs, and after-drops
of the sufferings of Christ, the sips and dew-drops remaining in the bottom of
the cup, when Christ has drunken out the whole cup; so are our affections, and
being compared with what Christ suffered, they are but bitts, fragments, and
small pieces of death, that we suffer, for the first death that the Saints
suffer, is but the half, and the far least half of death; its but the lips,
the outer porch of death; the second death, which Christ suffered for us, is
only death, and the dominion, Lordship, and power of death is removed. Why do
you then murmur, fret, repine under aflictions, when you bear little wedges,
pinnes, and chips of the Cross? Your Lord Jesus did bear for you the great
and only Cross, that which is death, shame, and the Cross, (...), by way of
excellency so called. It is true, the Spouse of Christ, since the beginning of
the world, and since Christ's time these 1600. Years, has been crying as a
woman traveling in birth of a Man-child, and the Dragon near persuing her,
and is not yet brought to bed. Lord Jesus, when will the Man-child be borne,
and thy Spouse be eased of the birth? Yet is not this disease deadly; Sion, as
soon as she traveled, brought forth her child, Isai. 66.8. All her shadows
of sufferings shall be quickly gone. The Spouse cannot die of childbirth pain;
Christ will save both the Mothers life, and the Babe.

2. Sin is a dear and costly thing: In heaven, in the Count-book of Justice,
it goes for no less then the blood of God, Use 2.
the shaming of the Lord of glory; Justice, for the request of all the world,
and the prayers of Christ, could not abate one farthing. Souls are of great
value with God.
A man's soul is a dear thing: Exchange of commodities, of silks, purple,
fine linen, is much; exchange of Saphires, Diamonds, Rubies, and other
precious stones, for baser commodities, is much more; and that ships-full of
the gold of Ophir should be given for bread, and things obvious, is a rich
traffiquing: but the market and value of souls, as it has not, since God made
man on earth, fallen or risen; so it is ever above a world. Mat. 16.26. What
has a man profitted, if he lose this? God will not take Silks, nor Purples,
nor Saphires, nor Rubies, nor Navies laden with fine gold, nor any corruptible
thing, 1 Pet. 1.18. for souls. The price is one and the same; souls were
never bought, nor sold, nor exchanged, nor ransomed, but once; and the price is
one, and as high as the soul and blood of the Lord of life. Job 27.8. What is
the hope of an hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes his soul
from him? let him cast up his accounts, and lay his charges, he stands a poor
man, a man without a soul. What mad men are we, who sell souls daily for
prices so far below the Lords price? We sell souls at an easy rate.
A man that would wood-feet a Lord-ship of many thousands yearly, for a base
sum, some pence, or for a nights sleep in a straw-bed, and bind himself not
to redeem it, what a waster were he? how worthy to beg? Satan is going
through the world, and he gives some pence in hand; O how sad a reckoning,
when the Devil the cozening Creditor comes at night, with his back counts, Pay
me for your sweet lusts I gave you: answer my Bill for your idle oaths, your
lies, oppressions, cozening, Covenant Breaking, your unjust judging, your
starving, and murdering of the widow, and the fatherless, by detaining of
the wages of the Soldier, your sleighting of Christ, and reformation, and the
price is referred to God, and the market known. Satan can abate nothing, thy
soul he must have, and within few days the body too; is this wisdom to earne
hell? and to make away a noble soul for a straw?

3. What are we to give for Christ? what bonds of love has he laid on us, who
earned our Heaven for us at so dear ^ price? I desire only these
considerations to have place in our thoughts.

God had but one Son, and one only begotten Son, and he gave him for
sinners; How great and strong was Christ's love. God h^d one Son, he gave him
for us, Christ had 2. loves, ^. glories he bestowed them on us.
so Christ had two loves, one as God, and another as man, he gave them both out
for us; and two glories, one as God, one as Man, and Mediator, the one was
darkened for us, (...); he emptied a Sea of glory for us, he powered it out for
us, and for his other glory, he laid it down, as it were in hell, endured
infinite wrath for us.

2. He went to death and the grave, made his testament, and left his love,
grace, and peace in legacy to us.

3. Greater love then this has no man; but he says not, greater love then
this has no God. That God did let out so much love to men is the wonder of the
world, and of heaven. We may find words to paint out creatures, and the
garment may be wider then the thing; but should Angels come and help us to
find out expressions for Christ's love; words should be below and in this side
of Christ.

Christ, but behold him more then a man, behold the Lord in the Garden,
sweatting out of his holy body, great blobs and floods of Love, trickling down
upon sinners of clay. Men and Angels come see, and wonder, and adore.

5. Love was Christ's cannon-Royall, he battered down triumphed over
Principalities, and powers; Christ overcome with love.
Christ was judgement-proofe; he endured the wrath of God, and was not
destroyed: he was hell-proofe, and grave-proofe, he suffered, and rose again;
but he was not love-proofe, (to borrow that expression) he was not only
love-sicke for his Church; but sick to death, and dyed for his friends. Cant.
2.4. His banner over his Church, was love; Saints be sworn to his colors,
die and live with Christ: and take Christ in the one arm, his cause, and
Gospel in the other, and your life between both, and say to all enemies; take
one, take all. The midst of Christ's Chariot is paved with love, for the
daughters of Jerusalem, Cant. 3.10. Christ's royal seat, both in the Gospel, in
which he is carried through the world as a Conqueror, Revel. 6.2. and in the
souls of his children, is love. From the sense of this, it were our happiest
life, to live and love with Christ, for he has carried up to heaven with him,
the love and the heart, and the treasures of the sons of God; so as all ours
are with him above time.

6. We are not to fear death extremely, nor hell at all. Christ feared both
for our comfort: How death is sweetened to us ^n Christ.
he has taken away the worst of death; In that 1. He has subdued hell and
sin, and there remains to us, but the outer side of death. 2. The believer
but half dies, and swoneth, or rather sleeps in the grave. 3. He dies by
will, because he chooses to be with Christ, Phil. 1.23. rather then by nature,
or necessity. 4. As dying, and sufferings are the cup that Christ drank; so
are we to love the cup the better, that Christ's lip touched it, and left the
perfume of the breathings of the Holy Ghost in it. In common Innes, by the way
side, Princes, and common travelers, and thousands lie in one bed; the clothes
may be changed, but the bed is the same. Christ tasted of death, Heb. 2. for
us; but there was gall in his cup, that is not in ours: Christ's wormwood was
bitter with wrath, ours sweetened with consolation.

7. All the Saints are in Christ's debt, of infinite love. When we grieve the
Spirit purchased by Christ, Christ repents not of his love to us.
we draw blood of Christ suffered so much for us. The Father has sworn, and
will not repent, that he is an eternal Priest, and stands to it, that his
blood is of eternal worth; and when the Father swears this, Christ is the
same one God with him, and swears, that he thinks all his blood well
bestowed, and will never give over the bargain, his Bride is his Bride, though
dear bought, and his intercession in heaven speaks his hearty Amen, and
fullest consent of love to our Redemption.

8. All this was done by Christ for nothing; Grace fell God, on the creature,
by mere grace. Grace is the only hire of grace.

Love looked first on sinners, how ^glie and black did the Lord see and
foresee us to be? but Christ loved us, not according to what we were, but to
what Grace and Love was to make us; and that was fair and spotless. And this
love was so free in the secret of eternal election, that it was not increased
by Christ's merits and death; but the merits, death, and fruit of this love, had
being and worth from Christ's eternal love, and Christ's love has no fountain
and cause, but love.

Christ; for he has loved us. If the love of Christ be in us, it works
nothing in order to merit or hire; ( Libertines need not weaken Christ's love
from doing, upon this fear;) but love does all in order to the debt of love
and obliged expressions to love, which excludes not Law, but the Law's rigid
cursing and imperious commanding. Christ's love is most imperious, but is no
hireling, and looks not to the penny wages, but the free Crown.

But for this cause came I to this hour. The fifth article of Christ's prayer,
the Correction.
Here is the fifth Article in this Prayer; a sort of correction, in which Christ
does resign his will, as man, to the will of God; as Mat. 26.39. Luke 22.42.
Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.

In this there is offered to us a question, Whether or no there be in this
Prayer any repugnancy in the humane will of Christ to the will of God? For 1. a
correction of the humane will seems to import a jarring and a discord; 2.
Christ desired that, the contrary whereof, he knew was from eternity decreed
of God. 3. The Law of God is so spiritual, straight and holy, that it
requires not only a conformity to it, and our will, actions, Christ's will in
his suffering subordinate to Gods will. Doubts on the contrary removed.
words and purposes; but also in all our affections, desires, first motions,
and inclinations of our heart, that no unperfect and halfe-formed lustings
arise in us, even before the complete consent of the will, that may thwart or
cross the known Law and command of God; and by this, Thou shall not lust, Romans
7. and the duty of the highest love we owe to God, to love him with all the
heart, soul, mind, and whole strength, Mat. 22.37. Mark. 12.33. Luke 10.27.
Some Arians and Arminians, Joh. Geysteranus at the Synod of Dort, have said
blasphemously, that there was concupiscence and a will repugnant to Gods will
in the second Adam, as in the first. But this they spoke against the
consubstantiality and deity of the Son of God. To which we say,

Asser. 1. Jesus Christ that holy thing, Luke 1.35. was a fit high Priest,
holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, Heb. 7.26. Which of you
(says Christ to the Jews) convinces me of sin, Joh. 8.46. There could not
be a spot in this Lamb sacrificed for the sins of the world, no prick in this
Rose, no cloud in this fair Sun, no blemish in this beautiful Well-beloved.

Asser. 2. An absolute, resolved will or desire of heart, to lust after that
which God forbids in his Law, must be a sinful jarring between the
creature's and the Creator's will. Now, Christ's will was conditional, and
clearly submissive; it lay ever level with his Father's holy will.

Asser. 3. I shall not with some affirm, that, which in the general is true,
We are to conf^rme our will to Gods revealed will, as a rule; not to his
decree, as it is his decree.
a will contrary to Gods revealed command and will, called voluntas signi,
which is our moral rule to obliege us, is a sin; but a will contrary to Gods
decree, called voluntas bene-placiti, which is not our rule oblieging, except
the Lord be pleased to impose it on us, as a moral Law, is not a sin. Peter
and the Apostles, after they heard that prophecy of their denying of Christ,
and their being sinfully scandalized, and their forsaking of Christ, when the
Shepherd was smitten, were obliged to have a will contrary to that decree, and
to pray that they might not be led into temptation, but might have grace to
confess their Savior before men, and not flee, nor be scattered: Here is a
resolute will of men lawfully contrary to the revealed decree of God; yet not
sinful. But the Lords will that Christ should die for man, as it was a decree
of the wise and most gracious Lord, pitying lost man, so was it also a revealed
commandment to Christ, that he should be willing to die, and be obedient to
the death, even the death of the cross; Phil. 2.8. Yea, a rule of such humble
obedience, as we are obliged to follow; as is said, Verse. 5. Let this mind be
in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, etc. If the Lords will that Christ
should die be nothing, but his mere decree, it could not obliege us in the
like case to be willing, as John says, to lay down our life for the brethren.
Yea, Joh. 10.18. Christ has a commandment of God, and the revealed will of
God, to die for us; No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of my self: I
have power to lay it down, I have power to take it again: this commandment
have I received of my Father. Here is an express commandment given to Christ,
to die for sinners; and the Father loves Christ for obedience to this
commandment.

Asser. 4. A conditional and a submissive desire, though not agreeable to a
positive Law and Commandment of God, A conditional desire though not
a^^^eable to a positive l^w of God, no sin*
is no sin, nor does the Law require a conformity in all our inclinations,
and the first motions of our desires, to every command of God, though most
contrary to nature, and our natural and sinlesse inclinations.

1. If God command Abraham to kill his only begotten son, and offer him in a
sacrifice to God, which was a mere positive commandment; for its not a
command of the law of nature (nor any other then positive) for the father to
kill the son; if yet Abraham retain a natural inclination and love,
commanded also in the law of nature to save his sons life, and to desire that
he may live, this desire and inclination, though contradictory to a positive
command of God, is no sin; because the fifth command, grounded on the law of
nature, does command it. Nor did Gods precept (Abraham, kill now thy son,
even Isaac thine only begotten son) ever include this, Abraham, root out of
thine heart all desire and inclination natural in a father to preserve the
life of the child. So the positive command of the Father, that the Son of God
should lay down his life for his sheep, did never root out of the sinlesse
nature of the man Christ a natural desire to preserve his own being and life,
especially he desiring it with special reservation of the will of God
commanding that he should die.

2. A Martyr dying for the truth of Christ; may have a natural and
conditional desire and inclination to live, though his living be contrary to
the Lords revealed will, commanding him to seal the Gospel with his blood, and
to confess Christ before men.

3. If the brother, son, daughter, wife or friend, that is as a man's own
soul, Deuteronomy. 13.6. blaspheme God; yea, if father or mother do it, Deuteronomy. 33.8,
9. yet is a father obliged to stone the son or daughter; the son, being a
Magistrate or a Levite and Priest, to judge according to law, ( the Priests
lips should preserve knowledge, Mal. 2.8.) that his father or mother ought to
be stoned to death; yet ought not father or son^e to lay aside that natural
desire of being and life to son, father, brother, which the law of nature in
the fifth Command does require; especially the desire being conditional, with
submission to Gods will, as the desire of Christ is here; and the Command to
stone the blasphemer, that the father stone the son, the son the father, being
positive, and though founded on the law of nature, that a man prefer his Lord
Creator and God before son, or father and mother, yet are they not precepts
of the law of nature, such as is the precept of nature that a man desire his
own life and being, the father the life and being of the son.

Asser. 5. The apparent opposition (for it is not real) is rather between
Christ's sensitive and his sinlesse mere natural desire and affection, and
his reasonable will, then his will, and the will of God: Nor can any say there
is a fight or jarring between the conditional desire of Christ subjected, in
the same act of praying, to the Lords decre^, and the resolute and immutable
will of God. The Law of God, because holy and spiritual, does require a
conformity between all the inclinations and motions of our soul, and the law
of nature; but an absolute conformity between all our inclinations and every
positive command of God, such as was the Lords command that Christ should die
for sinners, is not required in the Law of God. If Adam submit his natural
hunger or desire to eat of the forbidden tree, to Gods Law, and eat not, there
is no sinful jarring between his will and Gods positive Law, Thou shall not
eat of the tree of Knowledge of good and evil.

It becomes us, as Christ's example goes before us, Rules touching our
submission to Gods will.
to submit in the hardest and most bloody providence, to the straight and
holy will of God. 1. Christ pr^^esseth he has no will divided from Gods will;
he lays down his glory, his heaven, his life, his fruition of the sweet
influence of an highest vision, love, presence, feeling of God in a personal
union at the feet of God, that the Lord may carve and cut and dispose of him,
and his blood, as he thought good. 2. All the difficulty in us, in whom
dwells a body of sin is to answer the objections, that flesh and blood has
against a sad providence; which I will labor to do, and then give some rules
for direction.

Obj. 1. This is a bloody and rough way that the Lord leads his people,
Providence mysterious.
that they drink wormwood, and gall of blood, and not tears only.

Ans. Providence is full of mysteries, let the way be shame, the crown is
glory, and the present condition be hell, the end is heaven; Providence is a
handwriting of mercy, though we cannot ever read it, more then Belshazzar
could read his bill of justice; we see a woman with child, but cannot tell
whether it be a living or a dead birth, she shall bring forth; or whether the
child shall be base and poor, or honorable and renowned, ere he die. The
births in the womb of providence are invisible to us; out of the ashes of a
burnt and destroyed Church, the Lord raises up a Phoenix, a Kings daughter, a
Princess that shall rule the Nations with a rod of iron, a Zion that has the
strength of an Unicorn; yea, Jacobs seed shall be in many waters, his King
shall be higher then Agag, and his Kingdom shall be exalted: God brought him
out of Egypt, Number. 24.7, 8. Christ breweth the water of life, out of drink of
gall, wormwood, and blood; if the head be gold, as Christ is, the body cannot
without great incongruity be base clay.

Confusions nothing against providence.
Obj. 2. But all go wrong, confusion and vastation lie on the people of God.

Ans. To him who sits on the Throne, and gives Law and Judgment to the most
unconstant things imaginable, the waves of the Sea, and orders them, and rules
a Sea of glass, a brittle and frail thing, and a Sea of most unnatural
confusions, a Sea mingled with fire, nothing can be out of order, hell, the
Beast and Dragon that make war with the Lamb, the laying wast the holy City,
the killing of the Witnesses; are all orderly means ranked by the Lord whose
Armies cannot reele, nor spill their march, when he draws them up to the
execution of his wife decrees, the confusion is to our eye; but judgment law,
and order there are, though not visible to us. Who can pull him out of his
invisible and high Throne of wisdom, counsel and power? it may be he sits
not always on his Throne of justice.

But what a providence is it, that those that open their mouth against heaven
are fat, Prosperity of the wicked, adversity of the godly not against
providence.
and shine, and prosper, and those that fear God are plagued every day; and
killed all the day long and counted as sheep for the slaughter?

Answ^ 1. Offend not against the generation of the children of God, as if it
were lost labor, and as good to sow wheat in the Sea, as serve the Lord, and
walk mournefully before him, you see their work, but not their wages. 2. It is
painful to trace in a moment. dream, Psalm. 73.12, 13, etc.

Obj. Means fail, men chan^e, creatures are weak.

Answ. So long as Christ changes not, All goes well, so long as Christ lives.
and your Head lives, and stirs the helm of heaven and earth, all must be
well, if all life, all health, and so much as eternal life be in the Head, how
can the heart ache or quake, except it first create, and then fancy fears, and
do not really suffer?

Obj. 5. Our Kingdoms strength is gone, we cannot subsist.

Ans. Col. 1.17, 18. In Christ all things subsist, Faith looks to God in sad
providence.
he is the head of the body the Church. Faith is the substance, Bude^s the
boldness and fortitude; Beza the firm and constant expectation; the Syrian,
and Arabian, the confident gloriation of, or in things hoped for, and a
convincing light and evidence of things not seen. There is good reason to
believe that God will lift up a fallen people, who desire to fear him, and wait
for his help.

Obj. 6. They plow upon Christ's back, and make long and deep furrows on Israel
from her youth, Psalm. 129.1. The enemy plow and sow, and Christ reaps.


Ans. True, plowing is a work of hope, but have you not seen Enemies digging a
grave for Christ, and preparing a coffin for him ere he be dead? and they have
been fain to fill up the living man's grave, and they plow, but Christ comes in
and sows joy in the hot furrow, and reaps the crop, and the quiet fruits of
righteousness. The enemies plant, and the Vintage is Christ's, one sowes, but
another reaps.

Object. 7. But the souls under the altar do cry to God, and their blood is
not avenged: their blood, Providence has a time for all things.
and their graves in their kind, make supplications before the throne for
justice, yet the enemies prosper.

Answ. Has not the Lord appointed a time for fighting, and suffering, and a
time for triumphing, when these that have gotten the victory over the Beast,
and over his Mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the Sea of
glass, having the harps of God, singing the song of Moses, the servant of God,
and the song of the Lamb: there was a time when the Lamb did weep, and in the
days of his flesh, offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying
and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death. Revel. 15.23. Heb.
5.7. It is a sin to carve a date of our own for justice.

Object. 8. But he delays his coming.

Answ. But he is not slack, as some count slacknesse. If general justice to a
world must be measured by thousands of years, as but one day to God; particular
judgments may have hundredth of years; and when the Saints are killed, Christ
surviveth them, to redeem them from blood, and disgrace, when they are dead,
when their cause is judged, and they rotten into powder in the grave, they are
redeemed, even when the souls under the altar, are avenged on their Murderers.

Object. 9. It stumbleth many, that wicked men are fat, and their faces shine,
as if God were with them.

Its a shame that the wicked are fat on common mercies, and not we on th^se
same perfumed with Christ.
Answ. If they be fat on common mercies, the more shame to the Saints, if they
be not fat, and their bones green as an herb upon the same fare, and the
same mercies, perfumed with Christ, and there is more fatness and marrow in
the higher, then in the lower house: Saints are lean through their own
unbelief.

Now for rules of submission to providence in order to the Text, let these be
considered;

Rule 1. Christ's patience, and so our submission must be bottomed on a looking
above-hand to the will of God; every wheel in a great work, All wheels of
provide n^e move according to the first.
moves according to the motion of the highest and first wheel that moves all
the rest. Every inferior Court acts, as ordered by the highest and supreme
Senate, the greatest in the Kingdom. Every inferior or be in the heaven is
moved in subordination to the Primum mobile, the highest that moves all the
rest; the motion of rivers regulate the flowings of lesser brooks. And things
that move on earth, as the heavens move, so are they carried; the principle of
motions and ways in all morals, begins at the Highest mover, the just and
wise will of God; all are to say, not my will, but thy will be done.

Rule 2. There is no ground of submission in a crosse-providence, but to look
to the end that Christ looked to, Looking to God, the only ground of faith in
a crosse-providence.
the Lords wise and holy will; He curses, because the Lord bideth him, says
David of Shimei; and there he fixes his stake. The Lord has taken away,
says Job, and upon the Lords taking away, he says, Blessed be the name of the
Lord; Any man can say, Blessed be the name of the Lord, who gives; the
greatest part of men break their teeth, in biting at the nearest link of the
chain of second causes, but they arise never up to God, the first Mover.

Rule 3. Christ not only submits to Gods will, but he approves that it may
be done. So Ezechiah, Esai. 39.8. We must both submit to, and approve of
providence.
He said moreover, good is the word of the Lord, the thing was hard, that all
in his house should be carried away to Babylon, and his sons should be
captives. Yet the will of the Lord was good and just, when the thing willed and
decreed of God was evil to him.

Rule 4. Christ will not hinder God to do what he thinks good; Thy will be
done. Murmuring is a stone in Gods way; We are not to murmr.
Murmuring is an Anti-providence, a little God, setting it self against the
true God, that stirs all in wisdom; and the Murmurer does what he can to
stop up Gods way. Old Eli, when he heard sad news, says, 1 Samuel 3.18. It is
the Lord, (...) Let him, I hinder him not to do, what is good in his eyes.
David says, 2 Samuel 15.26. If the Lord say, I have no delight in thee, behold
here am I, let him do to me, what seems good in his eyes, here am I; is as
much, as I will not flee him, nor hinder him, I lay my self under him to
receive his strokes. So Christ, Heb. 10.5. Psalm. 40. Thou have prepared my
ears, or my body, here am I; Verse 7. Here am I to do thy will.

Rule 5. Christ gave not away his natural will; but in the act of willing, he
submitted it; We make no^ away our will when we submit it to God*
it was a broken will that Christ reserved to himself, or a submitted will,
hic and nunc. Christ seeks not the resigning of natural faculties in heard
providence, but that we quite contest with God; and that our will be not
abolished, but broken: especially, that we do not quarrel with Justice.
Lament. 3.28. He sits alone, and keeps silence, because he has borne it
upon him. Verse. 29. He puts his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be
hope. Verse, 30. He gives his cheeks to him that smites them; he is filled
with reproach: there be here many sweet signs of a broken will. 1. Solitary
sadness. 2. Silence, the soul not daring to quarrel with God. 3. The stooping
to the dust, and putting clay in the mouth, for fear that it speak against
Gods dispensation, as Job 40.4.5. (4) A willing accepting of buffets on the
cheeks, and reproaches; So Micha 7.9. I will bear the indignation of the Lord,
because I have sinned. When the soul is made like a broken and daunted heifer,
or a silly heartlesse Dove, so as the man like a w^ll-nurtured child, kisseth
the rod of God. He is a bad Soldier, Mul^s est miles qui (...), ^ratorem
gemens s^quitur.
who follows his Captain sighing, and weeping; Faith sings at tears, and
rejoices under hope in the ill day.

Rule. 5. Its the child's happiness, that the wise fathers will be his rule,
not his own; and for the Orphane, the Tutors wit, Gods w^ll for us, better
then our own
is better then his own will. Our own will is our hell, Ezech. 18.31. Why
will ye dye, o house of Israel? Christ's will is heaven. Christ thinks it is
best, that his Fathers will stand, will be repealed. Romans 15.3. for even Christ
pleased not himself; to have no will of your own, is the Pearl in the ring,
a Jewel in submission. (2.) that the Lords God draw my way to heaven through
fire, tortures, blood, poverty, though he should traile me through hell, he
cannot err in leading, I may err in following.

Object. But there is a better way beside, and he leads others through a
rosy and green valley, and my way within few inches to it, is a wilderness
of thorns.

Answ. Gold absolutely is better then a draught of water: but comparatively,
water is better to Sampson, dying for thirst, then all the gold in the earth:
Gods wisdom in creating good, and framing evil.
So cutting a vein, is in it self ill; but comparatively, letting blood
through a cut vein, is good for a man in danger of an extreme Fever; there
is no better way out of heaven for thee, then the very way that the Lord leads
thee. God not only chooses persons, but also things; and every cross that
befalls thee, is a chosen, and selected cross, and it was shapen in length,
and breadth, and measure, and weight, up before the Throne, by Gods own wise
hand: Heaven is the workehouse of all befalls thee, every evil is the birth
that lay in the womb of an infinitely wise decree; so God is said to frame
evil, as a Potter does an earthen vessel, (so (...) jatsar signifies;) Jer.
18.11. to frame a vessel of clay is a work of art and wisdom; so its a work
of deliberation and choice: God is said to devise judgment against Babylon,
Jer. 51.12. And the Lord has done to his people the things which he devised
(...) is to think, meditate, study, devise, Deuteronomy. 19.18. and Isai. 45.7. he
creates darkness and evil, it is such a work of omnipotency and wisdom, as
the making of a world of nothing, then if God follow infinite art in shaping
vengeance against Babylon, far more must he wisely study to mould and shape
afflictions for his own; for no afflictions befalls the Saints, but they be
well framed, chosen, wisely studied, forged, and created crosses. A Potter
cannot frame by deeper Art and judgment, a water-pot for such an end and use;
a fashioner cannot frame clothes in proportion for a man's body so fitly as the
wise Lord in judgment and cunning, shapes and frames this affliction as a
measure for thy foot only, poverty for this man, Affl^ctions proport^ned to
every man's meas^re.
and its shapen to his measure; wicked children and the sword on David's house,
fittest for him; such a loathsome disease for this Saint; want of friends and
banishment for such a man, another more and heavier should be shapen to wide
for thy soul, and another lighter should have been too strait, short, and
narrow for thee. Its comfortable, when I believe the draught, portraiture, and
lineaments of my affliction, were framed and carved in all the limbs, bones,
parts, qualities of it, in the wise decree and in the heart and breast of
Christ: It were not good to bear a Cross of the Devils shaping; were there as
much wormwood and gall in the Saints cup as the Devil would have in it, then
hell should be in every cup, and how many hells should I drink; and how often
should the Church drink death? Its good I know Christ brewed the cup, then it
will work the end, for be it never so contrary and sour to my taste, and so
unsavory; Christ will not taste poison in it, he has purposed I should sail
with no other wind to heaven, and I know its better, then any wind to me, for
that Port.

Rule. 6. Christ prescribes no way to his Father, but in the general, The
Lords will be done on me, (says he) be what it will: Let hell, and death, and
Devils malice, and heavens indignation, Gods will for every Saint a safe rule^
and enmity, and war, ill will, and persecution from earth, hard measure from
friends and lovers, if the will of my Father so be, welcome with my soul;
welcome black cross, welcome pale death, Faith welcometh all.
welcome curses, and all the curses of God, that the just Law could lay on all
my children, (and they are a fair number) welcome wrath of God, welcome shame,
and the cold grave. The submission of faith subscribeth a blanke paper, let the
Lord write in what he pleases, patience dares not contest and stand upon
pennies or pounds, on hundreds or thousands with God; Moses and Paul dare
refer their heaven, and their share in Christ, and the book of life to
Christ, so the Lord may be glorified: Submissive faith puts much upon
Christ, Let him slay me, yet I will trust in him, said Job 13.15. Heman
alleges it was not one single cross, Psalm. 88.7. Thou have afflicted me with
all thy waves. And David Psalm. 42.7. All thy waves and thy billows are gone
over me: One of Gods waves could have drowned David, afflictions coming in
Armies, and in a battle-array, say that one single Soldier cannot subdue us.
Lawful war is the most violent, and the last remedy against a State, and it
argues a great necessity of the Sword. Job had an Army sent against him, and
from heaven too, cap. 6.4. The terrors of God do set themselves in array
against me. See what a catalogue of sufferings, Paul did refer to God, 2 Cor.
11.23, 24, 25, etc. one good violent death would have made away a stronger man
then Paul, Many afflictions must be referred to God.
yet he was willing for Christ to be in deaths ofen, (...), many deaths, many
stripes, many prisons, five times nine and thirty stripes, this was near two
hundred stripes, every one of them was a little death: Thrice beaten with rods,
once stoned, thrice in shipwreck, night and day sailing in the deep, in
journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of his
own country men, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the City, in perils in
the wilderness, in perils in the Sea, in perils among false brethren, in
weariness, and painfulnesse, in watching often, in hunger, in thirst, in
fasting often, in cold, in nakedness, etc. Many of us would either have a
cross of our own carving, We love will-suffering as well as will-duties.
as we love will worship, and will-duties, so we love will-suffering, and
desire nothing more then if that we must suffer, Christ with his tongue would
lick all the gall off our cross, and leave nothing but honey, and a cross of
sugar and milk, we love to suffer with a reserve, and to die upon a condition;
an indefinite and catholic resignation of our selves without exception to
Christ, and to undergo many furnaces, many hels, many deaths as Christ will,
is a rare grace of God, and not of ordinary capacity.

Rule 7. Christ, in submitting his will, In duties Gods revealed will should be
our rule, in suffering his high decree.
makes the Prophecies, the revealed Gospel his rule: and in the matter of
duty, is willing to be ruled by Gods revealed will; in the matter of suffering,
he is willing that the Lords will stand for a Law, to which he does willingly
submit, and will in no sort quarrel with everlasting decrees. To be ruled by
the one, is holiness; to submit to the other, is patience: For patience is
higher then any ordinary grace, in regard its willing to adore and reverence
something more and higher then a commanding, promising, and threatening will of
God. It was a grace in Christ most eminent, Patience an^ high grace.
in the Lamb of God, dumb, meek and silent before his shearers, the meekest in
earth and in heaven, that he did not only never resist the revealed will of
God, but never thought, motion, nor any hint of a desire was in him, against
the secret and o^ernall decree and counsel of God. The Image of God is in his
works.
Christ will not have us to make Images of him, who is the invisible God; but,
when in his works of justice, power, love, free grace, he sets before us
the image of his glorious nature and attributes, he will have us to adore him
in these. According to his decree of reprobation, he raised up Pharaoh to be
clay to all men; on whom, as on a voluntary and rational vessel of wrath,
they might read power, justice, truth, sovereignty; in these works we are to
tremble before him, and adore the Lord. So in works of Grace, that are the
Image of the invisible God, the Lord is to be loved. 1 Timothy 1.16. In Paul, the
chief of sinners, the Lord holds forth an image of the freest grace, no less
then in the revealed will of God; for, 1. Christ made an example of mercy and
free grace in him. 2. He made a speaking and crying spectacle to all Ages, an
(...), a printed copy of crying grace to all the world: and in this we are to
adore and submit to him. Such a limb of hell has received mercy, not I, who
before men was holier. O submit to this work of grace, as to the copy of his
eternal decree, and be silent.

Rule 8. Christ puts nature and natural reason, that his natural will
might seem to plead withal, under the Lords feet: So it would seem strange.
Many v^rtues in Christ's s^bmi^sion to his fathers will.
God has many sons, but none like Christ: he was a Son, his alone; he
had never a brother by an eternal generation; he was the only heir of the
house; but never a son so afflicted as he: This seems against all reason. But
Christ brings in his Fathers will with an (...), But, Mat. 26.39. Joh. 12.27.
Luke 22.42. Mark. 14.36. But thy will be done. Its against submission to put
absolute interrogatories upon the Lord: We love to have God make an account of
his providence to us, and that the last and final appeal of the ways of the
Lord should be to our reason, as to the great Senate and supremest Court in
heaven and earth. Its true, Christ puts a Why upon God, My God, my God, why
but, 1. with the greatest faith that ever was, What and how much reason was in
Christ's why, or (...) he ^uts on the Father.
a doubled act of believing, My God, my God. 2. With the extremest love, that
ever was in a man; its also a twofold cord of warmness of heart to his
Father, My God, my God. 3. Its a word relative to the covenant between the
Father and the Son; for My God is a covenant-expression, that the Father will
keep what he has promised to his Son; and relates God, Lord has, and
therefore that Christ will submit to him. Christ's complaint of the Lords
forsaking, shows the tenderness of his soul, in prizing the favor of his
Father, more then any thing in heaven and earth. And therefore Christ's why is a
note of 1. Admiration: 2. Of sinlesse Sorrow; conjoined with love, tenderness
and submission to God. Christ cannot speak to his Father, beside the truth: But
every man is a liar; and we seldom put questions and queries upon
Sovereignty, but we prefer our reason to infinite wisdom. Job is out, and
takes his marks by the Clouds, and the Moon, when he says, Job 13.24. Why
hold thou me for thine enemy? Chap. 3.11. Why died I not from the womb? why
did I not give up the ghost, when I came out of the belly? And Jeremiah 15.18.
Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, All Gods works are with
child of reason and causes.
which refuses to be healed? Chap. 20.18. Wherefore came I out of the womb,
to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame? All the
Lords works are full, yea with child of reason, wisdom, and grave, and weighty
causes: and though we see not his acts to have a why, yet there is a cause,
why he does all he does; reason is necessity to him, and an essential
ingredient in all his actions.

Rule 9. In this Administration of Providence, with Christ, Providence goes
many ways at once.
the Lord goes many ways at once: In this very act he redeemeth the world,
judges Satan, satisfies the Law and Justice, glorifieth Christ, destroys
sin, fulfilleth his own eternal will and counsel. In one war he can ripen
Babylon for wrath, humble his Church, deliver Jeremiah, punish Idolatry. In the
same war he can humble and correct Scotland, harden Malignants, that they
will not hearken to offers of peace; and blow up their haters, that they may be
lofty through victories, and be ripened for wrath through unthankfulness to
God. Providence has many eyes, so also many feet and hands under the wings, to
act and walk a thousand ways at once. There is a manifold wisdom in
Providence, as in the work of Redemption. In every work that God does, he
leaves a wonder behind him: No man can come after the Almighty, and say, I
could have done better then he. Its natural to blame God in his working, but
unpossible to mend his work.

Rule 10. Nor is Christ made a loser, by losing his will for the Lord, but his
will is fulfilled in that which he feared, Providence can do more then we can
expect.
Heb. 5.7. Providence submitted unto, rendereth an hundred fold in this life,
Matthew. 19.29. God makes the income above hope, Genesis 48.11. And Israel said to
Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face, and lo God has showed me also thy
seed. One berry is not a cluster, that two men cannot bear, but its a field, an
earth of Vine-trees in the seed, Ephesians. 3.20. He is able to do above all
things (...) more then abundantly above that we can ask or think, above the
shaping or frame of my words and thoughts. But I can ask heaven, he can give
more then heaven, and above heaven, yea I can think of Christ, but he can give
above the Christ that I can think on, because I cannot comprehend infinite
Jesus Christ.

Rule 11. Christ is not so intent and heart-bended on freedom from death and
this black and sad hour, Visible and invisible providence ^ow differenced.
but he reverences a higher providence, that Gods will be done; so are we to
look to providence, and we are not to stumble at an external stroke in sad
occurences, when Job 9.22. God destroys the perfect and the wicked. And he
furbishes his Sword Ezekiel. 21.3. and says, I will draw out my sword out of its
sheath, and will cut off from thee, the righteous and the wicked.

Arise, go down to the potters house, Jer. 18. The earth is Gods work-h^use;
for clay, good and bad are equally on the wheels; Christ as punishable for our
sins, though a vessel of burning Gold, is under art; Soveraignity rolls
about three in one wheel, the Blaspheming, the Repenting Thief, and Christ,
who is Virtue, Grace, yea Glory in the midst. An elect and a reprobate man may
be both sewed in the same winding sheet, they may touch others skins in the
same grave, but they are not rolled in, in the same hell. Yea Cham is saved in
the Arc, but as the unclean beasts are, he is preserved from drowning, but
reserved to cursing.

God a special love of free grace; the good and the bad figs are not in the
same invisible basket; there is a Pavilion, a Cabinet of silk in Gods privy
Chamber, seen to no eye: Psalm. 27.5. And upon all the glory shall be a
covering, Esai. 4.9. Christ's free and invisible love, is a fair white web of
gold, that a Saint is wrapped in in the ill day. Where is he? he is hid, yet he
goes through the sieve, and sifted he must be, but not a grain of him falls
to the earth, Amos 9.9.

3. There have been questions about the Prerogative of Kings Parliaments too,
but undeniably in the Market-roade of Providence, Royal Prerogative of
providence and the ways thereof.
the Lord has kept a Prerogative Royal of justice to himself, to cut off the
innocent and righteous with the wicked, in temporal judgments. 2. And of
special grace of Providence, when the godly man is blacked Gods Prerogative
Esai. 38.5. Ezechiah (says the high Landlord) is summoned to slit and remove,
yet he shall dwell in his Farm Christ's bride are upon the newfound sands in
the heart of the Sea. Yea with hungry Lions not to eat their meat, when they
have no food but the flesh of Daniel, beloved of the Lord. Christ here commits
himself unto an unseen Sovereignty. For Abraham to kill his own only
begotten son of promise; to reason, its a work of God, but its a providence
of nonsense. Neither Law nor Gospel, for ought that reason can see, shall
warrant it; yet Soveraignity commands it, and that is enough. Afflictions of
trialls, such as the prosperity of the wicked, and the trying sufferings of
the godly, seem more to contradict Gods promises, and revealed will in the
Word, then any other visitations of God, therefore beside that they require
patience, they must have faith in an eminent manner. To believe infinite
wisdom can tie the murdering of Isaak by his own Father, against the Law of
Nature (as it seems) with the Gospel, which cannot command unnatural bloods,
must require much faith.

Rule 12. Christ declares when matters are at the worst, there is good will for
him, in the done will of God; its an objection to sense, and to sinlesse Nature
in Christ-man: O do thou not see sad and four-faced death, is not thy soul
thy darling in the power of dogs? has not hell long and bloody teeth? is not
the furnace, the oven of the Lords highest indignation, for the sins of all the
chosen of God very hot? To stand at the will of God and go no farther, (...)
s^bmission.
when the flames of it makes thee a troubled soul, and causes thee to sweat
out blood; what blood shall be l^ft for scourging, for the Iron nails of that
sad cross? True (says Christ) I have (God knows) a heavy soul, my strength
is dried up like a potsheard: This cup casts a savor of hell and fiery
indignation, a sight of it would kill a man, yet i will drink it, the good and
just will of my Father be done, there I stand, further I go not. To be at a
stand, and to lay silence on our tumultuous thoughts, who are compassed with a
body of sin, and to be satisfied with the will of the Lord is our safest, we
should not be persuaded by the cross, or all that sense can say, far less
what sin can say from this, The will of the Lord be done. The friends of Paul
hearing what he must suffer, say, Acts 20.14. When he would not he persuaded,
we ceased saying, The will of the Lord be done. It is grace to cease and say no
more, when we see the Lord declare his mind to us; An holy heart will not go
one hairs breadth beyond the Lords revealed will.

1. Because love which thinks not ^ll, Faith s^^th (...) gra^e in a sad
provid^^ce.
does not black the spotless and fair will of God, when it is revealed to be
from God, though Hell were in that will.

2. Faith sees even in permitting of persecution from Pharaoh and Egypt, the
Lords good will in the burning bush, the very good will by which he saves his
people redeemed in Christ, Mat. 11.26. Phil. 1.13. who dwells in the bush,
Deuteronomy. 33.16. And it is considerable that the same good will which is the root of
reprobation, and of permitting hell and Devils, and Devils persecuting
instruments to turn his Church into ashes, and to a burnt bush; and Devils and
men to crucify Christ is free grace, and the root of Election to glory, and is
extended to the Saints, Romans 9.15, 16, 17. Ephesians. 1.11. Faith sees and reads
free grace in a providence, which of it self, is extended to Devils and
reprobate men, though not as extended to them; and it is an Argument of true
grace, if any can say Amen to Hell and the sadest indignation coming from this
will, though against a particular will of of our own.

God, and that which is the Soul and Formale of sin, Providence wise and
cannot be counter-wrought.
and the determination of a wicked and ill-stated question. Whether should my
short and pur-blind will, stand for eternity; or the holy and infinitely-wise
will of God, which had eternity of duration, infiniteness of wisdom, and not
seven, but millions of eyes, to advise what was decreed as fittest to be done.

4. Since there is not a Fatum, nor an Adamantine destiny Job 9.4. He is wise
in heart, and mighty in strength; who has hardened himself against him, and
prospered? There is infinite wisdom in God, and infinite power to bring to
pas^e his Decrees; will clay counterworke Gods infinite counsel? The Former of
all things makes fire-workes under the earth against sinners; can sinners make
counter-mines to out-worke the Almighty? Sure if he be wise in heart, who has
a most eminent, holy, and just providence in all that falls out, when we
hear that the Gospel, and the Church of Christ are oppressed in judgment, we
are to look on that oppression, as on the sin of other men, and as our
cross, and to mourn for it: In the former consideration, and in the latter,
as it troubles us, to judge it good, necessary, and better, then if it had been
otherwise. The formal reason of goodness is the will of God, and your
judgment is to esteem that good, which is ill to you, though it be sour and
heavy; for it has goodness from this, and goodness to you that the Lord
has decreed it; to be sour and sweet make up a middle taste most pleasant;
Christ twisteth black and white in one web; the Jews sins, which he wills
not; and their sin is the redemption of man, which he loves; and these two
are pleasant to behold, and when they are mixed in one, and come from the most
wise God, they have beauty to God, far be it from me, to judge them black,
or unjust, which are fair to him.

Rule 13. Christ submits his will to the will of God, in soule-desertions, so
should we do. Christ's love to his Father, is no Critic, no knotty Questionist
to spinne, and forge jealousies against Lords will, better then his own will.
We have too many querelous love-motions against the reality of Christ's love,
when he hides himself. O but we are covetous and soule-thirsty after our own
will, in the matter of soule-manifestations; either I see little here, or we
Idol comforts, We d^te to much on the sweet (...) dents of Christ, and love
^imselfe to l^ttle.
and would gladly have a Christ of created grace, rather then Christ, or his
grace; and when we are thirsting for Christ, it is his comforts, the Rings,
Jewels, Bracelets of the Bridegroom, we sick after, rather then himself; its
not an unmixed, nor a poor mariage-love, to ma^y the riches and possessions,
and not the person, Math. 22.2. The Kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain
King, which made a Marriage (...), for his Son, not for his daughter in law. The
glory of Gospel-dainties resembled to a Marriage, are for the Kings Son, and
the glory of Christ; not for our glory, but for our grace. Christ is the final
end, for whom all the Honey-combes, the Myrrh, the Spices, the Wine, and the
Milk of the banquet are prepared. Cant. 5.1. We have need of Christ to cure,
even our perfections: there be some wild oats, some grains of madness and
will-wit in our best graces. 2. You cannot Idolize Christ himself; love in
pounds, in talent weights is too little for him; his sweet accidents, his
delights, consolations love-embracements are sweet; but swel-ling, and too
fatning, and if Christ send these to a believer, in a box of gold, or in a case
made of a piece of the heaven, or of a chip of the noone-day-Sunne, and not
come himself, they should not satisfy the soul. Cant. 3.1. I sought him whom
my soul loved; Watchmen saw ye him? O it is the beloved himself, that is a
great man in the Spouses books, his Wine, his Spiknard, his Myrrh, his
Ointments, his Perfume, the Savor of his Garments, his Apples of love, are all
in that heavenly song set out for himself. Love Tokens are nothing, duties
nothing, inherent righteousness nothing, heaven nothing, if separated from
Christ; but Christ himself is all in all.

Christ in the heart, God who created supernatural love can rule it.
can only cure our love, when its sick for Christ: As he that created the
first World can rule it, so he that created the second new world, can guide it,
and all the creatures in it, though our faith stagger, touching his special
providence, in particulars of either, as we are deserted, and left to our
selves.

3. We often thirst after comforts, and sense, as the people Esai 58.5.) were
reproved for their fast: Is it such a Fast as I have chosen? And Zach. 7.5. Did
ye at all Fast to me, We desire Christ often for ourselves.
even to me? So may Christ blame us for the like sin, and say, Have ye
thirsted to me, and for me, and not rather for your selves? Let us examine
delusions, and not father them upon Christ, except we know he will own them.

God, whereas Christ submitted, to want it for a time; when he saw it was Gods
will so to do; and though we have not, nor can we have positively, always an
edge of actual hunger; yet we negatively can be submissive to want, when we
see it is his will, Submission to the absence of G^d is requ^red.
we want; whereas he is the same Christ, with the same immanent, and eternal
love of election, without variation of the Degrees of the altitude and height
thereof, the same infinite wisdom, when he frowns, and hides his face, and
when he shines and smiles in his kingly manifestations. Clouds alters not the
Sunne-light, coverings changes not Christ, that he cannot love behind the
curtain. Except we take a cloud to be the Sun, or created sweetness to be
Christ; were the beam separated from the Sun; what should it be but as good
as nothing? We dream that the curtains and robes of Christ's manifestations of
love, adds somewhat to his excellency; then he must be of more eminency, when
he expresses himself in love-embracements to us, then when he was from
eternity the flower of his Fathers delight. Christ's outside in revealed
sweetness, and in transient manifestations of his beauty, must then be more
excellent then himself; this is too selftie a conception of Christ. The Lord
Jesus is more within, then we can enjoy of him, in his love-expressions; he
loses none of that immanent sweetness, under his wise withdrawings; though
you, or I, or Men, or Angels, should never feed upon any time-injoyments of
sweetest love, and manifested glory from his revealed kindness.

5. Its a great Quere, if it be expedient, that our motion to heaven, should
be as the motion of the Sun that never rests, but moves as swiftly in the
night as in the day, and if we should ever be on wings, I know its our duty;
but even the falling on our own weight, and the conscience of our clay-mould,
our short breath, Natures weak legs in walking up the Mount, are good for the
adding wind and tide, (...) expedient that we (...) on our own legs some time.
and high sails to the praising of Christ, and free Grace: Vtile est
peccavisse, noc^t p^ccare. It is profitable that we have sinned, that Grace may
be extolled, it is ill to sin. Even to the nature of man its good that he
has dyed, and has been in the grave, yet its not good, but contrary to
nature, to die, and to ly in the grave. Oblisse bonum est n^turae, obire mulum.


6. Its our forgetfulness, that we see not the dearest to Christ has been
kept lowest, and most empty in their own eyes; hidden grace extolleth Christ.
2. That often the Saints are kept in a condition of sailing with as much wind
as blows, Return of Christ no merit.
nor promerit the renewed sense of Christ, so as Christ returns to eat his
honey-combe, and his wine, and milk, and banquet with the soul, rather at the
presence of these acts, then for them, as some have said, (thou^h with no
strength of reason) that fire burns not, the Sun enlighteneth not, the
^arth does not send forth flowers, and herbs; but God at the naked presence of
these causes, does produce all effects; yet in this case it has a truth; that
the sweating of all supernatural industry, cannot redeem the least half
glimpse of Gods presence, in the sense of eternal love, when God is pleased
for trial^ to hide himself.

7* Our great fault here is merit, that we tie the flowings and inundations of
Christ's love to the beck of our desires, whereas we may know: 1. That the
Sun does not shine, nor the rain water the earth, in order to merit. 2. We
should know that grace, and all the acts of grace are alms, not debt, and that
a rich Savior gives grace to us as beggars, and pays it not to hirelings,
as the due, or as wages we can crave for our work; but we love peny-worth's
better then free-gifts.

But for this cause came I to this hour. The work of redemption most rational
and full of causes
Christ's work of redemption was a most rational work, and was full of
causes, (...); this says, that to redeem losed sinners, was not a rash and
reasonlesse work.

1. There was no cause compelling. Love cannot be forced, John 3.16. God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten works more from an
intrinsecall cause, and more spontaneously then nature. For Nature often is
provoked by contraries for selfe-defence to work: as fire works on water, as
on a contrary; the wolf and the dog pursue one another as enemies. But
Grace, because grace has abundance of causality and power in it self, but
has no cause without it.

Tim. 1.15. Its a true saying, and by all means worthy to be received, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. If the thing be worthy (...),
of all receipt and embracing, then it must be good; an Agent working from a
Principle of goodness does in his kind work necessarily, though he may also
work from another principle freely. Grace a cause of it self.
John 10.11. I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd gives his life for his
sheep. Luke 19.10. For the Son of man is come to seek, and to save that
which is lost.

3. God will seek reasons or occasions without himself, to be gracious to
sinners. When no reason or cause moves a Physician to cure, but only
sickness and extreme misery; we know grace and compassion is the only
cause; Ezech. 36.23. I will sanctify my great name, Sin an occasion of acts
of grace.
Why? Which was profaned among the heathen; and which ye have profaned in the
midst of them; then the true cause must be expressed, Verse. 22. Thus says the
Lord God, I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy
Names sake.

4. The Lord takes a cause from the end of his coming, Math. 20.28. The Son
of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for
many. Joh. 18.37. To this end was I borne, and for this cause came into the
world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Joh. 10.10. I am come that
they might have life, and have it in abundance.

5. Some thing, yea very much of God, is in the creation; God in his common
providence; but most of all, Much of God in the work of redemption.
yea whole God in the redemption of man. God manifested in the flesh is the
matter and subject of it, Grace the moving cause, most of all his attributes,
working for the manifestation of the Glory of pardoning mercy, revenging
justice, exact faithfulness and truth, freest grace, omnipotency over hell,
devils, sin, the World; patience, longanimity to man, cooperate as the
formal and final causes, it is a piece so rational and full of causes, that
as he is happy, (Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,) who can know the
causes of things: so Angels delight to be Scholars to read and study this
mysterious art of free Grace, Ephesians. 3.10. 1 Pet. 1.12 Works without reasons and
causes are foolish. The cause why we do not submit to God, is, Afflictions are
to be weighed in all the caus^s. 1. Who afflicts. 2. How or in what manner. 3.
For what cause.
because we lie under blind and fatherless crosses: its true, Affliction
springs not out of the dust, and crosses considered without God, are twice
crosses. Three material circumstances in crosses are very considerable. Quis,
quare, quomodo. 1. Who, for what cause, and how does God afflict us. Who
afflicts is worthy to be known. Esai. 42.24. Who gave Jaakob for a spoil, and
Israel to the robbers? The highest cause of causes did it. Did not the Lord, he
against whom we have sinned? It is the Lord, let him do what seems good to
him. 2. For what end God the Lord did this, is a circumstance of comfort; Why
led the Lord Israel through a great Deuteronomy. 8.16. That he might prove thee, to
do thee good at thy latter end. 3. And how the Lord corrects, is worthy to
be known. He corrects Jaakob in measure, Christ's heart, and his stirred
bowels mixed in with the cup, is a merciful little hell. Psalm. 6.1. Jer.
31.18, 19, 20. The Law says, Blind and dumb cr^sses not good.
A Bastard has no father, because his father is not known. The Philistimes
are plagued with Emerods, but whether that ill was from the Lord, or from
Chance, they know not. The cross to many is a bastard. We suffer from Prelates,
because we suffered Prelates to persecute the Saints. Papists shed our blood,
why? Our forefathers burnt the witnesses of Christ, and we never repented.
Christ and Antichrist are at bloody blows in the camp: Antichrist has
killed many thousands in the three kingdoms for Religion; that is the
quarrel: and when England had often before, and have now opportunity, they
will not lift Christ up on his throne, nor put his Crown Royal on his head,
but do put it on their own head, but the judgment is not yet at an end.
Scotland has not walked worthy of the Gospel, but have fallen from their first
love. We take not a deliberate list of every limb, thigh, leg, and member of
this national wrath, and we neither see wherefore we are afflicted, nor how.

For this cause came I to this hour. There is some peculiar act of Christ's
will here holden forth, and that is Christ's peculiar intention, to die for his
people; in which we are to consider the activenesse of Christ's will in dying
for man, which may be seen.

1. In his free offering of himself, and his service to the Father. Psalm.
40.6. Sacrifice and offering thou did not desire, mine ears have thou
opened. How actively wil^ing Christ was to serve for us.
Heb. 10.5. A body (that is, the office house, and isntrumental subject of
obedience to the death, as the ear is of hearing, and obeying the
commandments of God) thou have prepared me. Verse. 7. Then said I, lo I come
(in the volumne of thy book it is written of me) to do thy will o God. In
these words Christ is brought in as a servant, with three excellent quallities.
Excellent qualities in Christ as he (...) a servant to God in the work of
redemption.
1. Physically, he is fitted with a body and a soul to offer to God for us; as
in a servant there are required strong limbs and arms to endure drudgery, in
this he was borne of his mother, for this sad service: his Master furnished him
for this, even the seed of man's flesh and blood for suffering.

2. There were moral habilities in him; promptitude of of will. So the Lord is
brought in, as a Lord and Master in justice crying, servant; O Son and
servant Jesus, I have a business for thee of great concernment. At the first
word, as all good servants do, Christ takes him to his feet, and compeares
before his God, his Master and Lord, Lo I come, here am I; so servants of old
answered their Master: What service will thou command so hard, which I will not
undergo? Master, here is a body for thy work, here be cheeks for the nippers,
a face for those that will pluck off the hair, a back for smiting, a body
for the cross and the grave. Christ as a servant uncovered, standing on feet,
would say; Lord, send me thy servant to the Garden, to work under the burden
of thy wrath, till I sweat blood; bid me go to shame, to scourging, and
spitting, is it thy will I go up on the cursed cross, and be made a curse
for sinners, that I be crucified and die, that I go lower in to the utter
half of hell, the grave, which is a sad journey; lo here am I, willing to
obey all.

3. There was in Christ, not only willingness, but delight, Psalm. 40.8. (...)
My God I delight to do thy will, thy Law is in the

2. His willingness to die was a part of his Testament and last Will, he dyed
with good will, and left in Legacy his death, and Heb. 9, 17. and John 14.27.
Peace I leave (in testament) with you. But the Orphane, and the poor friend
gets not all that his dying Father and friend leaves in Testament, but Christ
gives possession himself ere he die, My peace I give to you; but to the point:
His latter Will, was willingness to die.

3. No external force could take his life from him, against his will. John
10.18. No man takes my life from me, Christ^ willi^gnesse to die.
but I lay Yet lest it should seem a will-action in Christ, and ^o not
obedience, he adds. This Commandment (that is the will of a Superior) have
I received of my Father. Compelled obedience, is no obedience: exact
willingness was a substantial and essential ingredient in Christ's obedience.
Acts of Grace cannot be extorted; can ye tear a shoure of rain, from God in
an extreme drouth: or bread from him in your hunger, against his will? Far
less, since Christ's dying was an act of pure grace, can any compel him to dye
for man. Love arrested his holy will, and that made him run apace to dye for
us: O blessed be his good will, who burned himself in the Bush, in a fire of
free love.

4. Though dying be a passion; yet Christ's dying was both Christ an Agent in
his passion.
and an action. Will added as much perfume and strength of obedience, as
nature, and pain, shard-ship, shame, and abasement could do; his life was not
so much plucked from him, as out of his own hand, As an Agent he offered his
blood, and soul; yea, himself to God, through the eternal Spirit, Hebr.
9.14. Love was the coard, the chain that did bind Christ to the Altar.

Christ (...) on this intention came to this hour; so is (...) often in
Scripture. Christ specially intended to have a spouse in all his sufferings,
and labors.
Not only his will, but the flower of his will, his intention was to die, for
Christ's eye and his heart, and his love was on his Bride; the intention is the
most eminent act that Love can put forth. Christ's eye and his heart being upon
his Spouse, he made our salvation his end and measure of his love, to compass
this end: the Lord laid many Oars in the water; his rising early, his night
watching, his toyling, his sweating, his soar and hard Soule-travell, as being
heavy with Child of this end, (O might I have a redeemed people) was all his
care; and his soul was eased, when dying, bleeding, crying, he went thorough
hell and death, and slept in deaths black and cold prison, and his Redeemed
ones in his arms. When he came to the end of this sad journey, and found his
Ramsomed ones, he said; I have sought you with a heavy heart; fair and foul
way, sad and weary; and all is well bestowed, since I have gained you. Let us
up together to the hill of Spices, to our Fathers house, to the highest
mountain of Frankincense. All that Christ did, was for this end, That he might
deliver us from this present evil world, Galat. 1.4. That he might be a
ransom for many, Matthew. 20.28. That we might have life, and have it more
abundantly, Joh. 10.10. That he might seek and save the lost, Luke 19.10. That
he might present his wife a glorious Church to himself, not having spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing: but that she should be holy and without blemish,
Ephesians. 5.26, 27. that we being dead to sin, should live to righteousness, 1
Pet. 2.24. Christ came to seek, and traveled ever till he found his desire, a
redeemed and saved people, and then he rested; Even as he journyed through
all the Creation, but till he found man, a creature that he made according to
his own image, he had no Sabbath, no rest. His willingness to die, respected
his redeemed people, whom out of mere mercy he loved, and the worth of will
and merit respected infinite justice, which he exactly satisfied.

Hence we learn; Use 2.
1. To imitate and follow our pattern Christ, in voluntary obedience,
delighting to do Gods will, and to suffer Gods will. Its said of Christ, Hebr.
5.8. Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience through suffering. He
was the excellentest Scholar among all his Schoole-fellowes, and yet the rod
of God was heaviest, and most frequent on him; he learned his Lesson beyond
them all. He was quick in understanding, in the fear of the Lord, Esai. 11.3.
He had in him an excellent Spirit; The Spirit of Wisdom, of Counsel, Its much
to be active for God but more to be passive.
of Knowledge, and of the Fear of the Lord; And was holy and obedient to the
death, the death of the Cross. Its much to learn to be active for God, but
more to learn to be passive. That is a profound science. Phil. 4.12. I know
how to be abased, -- I am instructed to be hungry, -- and to suffer need. It Is
the singular art of Grace to know how to love, fear, and obey God, under
death, pain, and hell. It is a high lesson to learn the Mystery of that deep
Science, of hunger, want, suffering, stripes, and torment, and death for
Christ. This is high, Hebr. 10.34. Ye, took patiently the spoiling of your
goods, knowing that in heaven ye have a better, and more enduring substance.
They are but accidents we have here, and these very separable. Heaven is all
substance. Our obedience passive is not willing, its constrained. We might by
Grace turn clay into gold, hell into heaven: if we could look in faith and
patience, To look to highest providence a safe ground of sudmission.
on the persecution, and reproaches of men, as on the brutish and irrational
motion of a staff, or an axe that beats and cuts us; suppose we knew no hand
under God that wronged us; he curses, because the Lord has bidden him. For
the freedom of Christ's kingdom, and the right government of his house, and
for opposing blasphemies, and reproaching of Christ, his Word, Scripture,
Ordinances, We are killed all the day long, and counted the off-s^ourings of
men; could we over-looke unthankfulness, malice, wickedness, persecution
from men, whom we with our lives and blood have redeemed from persecution, and
behold the highest Mover, and first Wheel that moves all under wheels, as if
God only were our party, who humbles us, that we may be humbled; then should
we be silent, and our hearts should not rise at the exorbitances of men. There
is too much of nature in our sufferings, too little submissive willingness.
The more action of a sanctified will in our sufferings, its the more
acceptable, and comes nearest to Christ, who did both run for the Crown, and
was active, and endured the Cross, and was most passive in an heavenly manner,
Heb. 12.

2. Let us learn of Christ to intend obedience, to put a (...) to our
obedience. Use 2.
Many hear the word, but they intend not to hear; many pray, and intend not
to pray; many die in these wars for Christ, but intend not to spend their
life for Christ: The holy and clean cause of God comes through many dirty and
foul fingers. This is the deep art of Providence.

Quest. What is a right and straight intention in serving God?

Asser. 1. When the deliberation of a bended will concurres with the intention,
What is a right intention in serving God.
its right; as when there is an heart-conclusion for God. Psalm. 39.1. I said I
will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my tongue. Psalm. 31.14. But
I trusted in the Lord: I said, Thou art my God. Psalm. 102.24. I said, O my God,
take me not away in the midst of my days. This was an intended prayer. Psalm.
119.57. I have said that I would keep thy words.

Asser. 2. The Saints are not so perfect in their intentions, as God is their
only end. 1. Because a piece of our self is mixed with our end; there is some
crook in our straightest line; an angle in our perfectest circle: when we run
most swiftly, because of the in-dwelling of corruption, we halt a little. 2.
Self-denial is not perfect in this life.

Where Christ is the predominant, he is the over-swaying end in the soul.
Asser. 3. Its good, when God is so pre-conceived in the intention, as the
principal actions and motions both have being and denomination from their
predominant element. Honey is is honey, though not pure from wax. A b^leever is
not a simple element, nor all grace, and all sincerity. Now in bodies carried
with a predominant element, the predominant is affirmed, the subordinate
denied. 1 Cor. 15.10. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me. 2 Cor. 4.5. For
we preach not our selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and our selves your
servants for Christ's sake. Where Christ is the predominant element, he is of
weight to sway the whole soul in its motion. And its right-down sincerity
(whatever Crispe, with Papists say on the contrary) though it require some
grains of allowance to make it pass.

Asser. 4. Where Self is the predominant, Where Self is predominant, the
intention cannot be sincere.
the intention is bastard and adulterate. Jehu says, Come see my zeal for the
Lord; but he only says it. He could have said, Come see my zeal for my
self. In the Jews zeal, Romans 10.1. there is a pound of selfe-righteousnesse,
for one half grain of Christ, and of free grace; therefore its not the right
zeal of God.

Asser. 5. There be two characters of an intended end, Two Characters of the
thing which is our intended end.
which are also here: 1. All that the agent does, he refers to his end; for
his end is his God. The wretch does all in reference to gold, that is his end:
And Joab did all for Court and honor; for the chief end is the man's Master,
and uses a lord-ship over him. Christ is so mighty through God, that he
darkens the Scribes and Pharisees light; because their end lies in the fat
womb of the world, and it is gain and glory; all they do is to make Christ
out of the way. So when the believer sails all winds, rolleth every stone,
presses all means for Christ, as his end, and his weight, then stirs he to
the right port. Christ's love has a dominion over lord-will: One Adamant will
cut another; the sinner is a rock, Christ's love an Adamant. Christ's love
setting on the wills intention, burns the soul to the bone. The love of
Christ strong, and takes strength from difficulties.
Mary Magdalen cannot sleep, (and its a ticklesome game where the heart is at
the stake) and Christ she must have; Apostles, Angels, Christ himself shall
hear of it ere she want him. And the rougher and harder the means be, when
under-taken for Christ, Christ must be a stronger and more love-working end.
When torment and burning quick are chosen for Christ, its like he is the end;
for love over-comes a rough and dangerous journey: A sweet and desirable home,
is above a dirty and thorny way. Christ's love is stronger then hell. Our
affections often take fire from difficulties; as absence of the Beloved kindles
a new fire; Stolen bread, because stolen, is sweeter, and not our nature
only; but longing after Christ, nititur in vetitum, inclines to that which is
forbidden. What if Christ be longed for and loved more when absent, then
present?

2. The other Character is, That when the end is obtained, all operation for,
That is our e^d, which obtained (...) the desire in the pros^^ution of means
or about the means cease, and the soul has a complacency in the fruition
of the end. When the wretches chests are full, he has an heart-quietnesse in
gold; Luke 12. Soul, take thine ease; but if the soul have an akeing and a
disquieting motion after gold is obtained, it is not because gold was not his
end, but because he has not obtained it in such a large measure as he would;
or because its but a sick and lame end, and cannot satiate, but rather sharpen
soule-thirst after such corruptible things. When Christ is obtained, the soul
has sweet peace; He that drinks of the water of life thirsts no more,
appetitu desiderii, as longing with anxiety for this, as we do for earthly
things, which we want; though he have appetitum complac^ntiae, a desire of
complacency, and a sweet self-quietnesse, that his heritage pleases him well,
and his lines are fallen in pleasant parts, and rests on his portion, and would
not change it with ten thousand worlds. Men by this, who are fishing and
hunting after some other thing then Christ, may know what is their end: when
Christ and Reformation come to their doors, they will have neither; but cast
out their lines for another prey: Men now fish and angle for gain, in lieu of
godliness.

Verse. 28. Father, glorify thy Name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. Here is the last
Article of Christ's prayer, Father, glorify thy Name. 2. The Return of Christ's
prayer by an audible answer from heaven.

This Prayer, Glorify thy Name, Father; is of an higher strain: Father, I am
willing to die, so thou be glorified in giving to me strength to suffer, and
thou redeem lost man by me, and by so doing glorify thy Name. Christ never in
his hardest suffering would be wanting to glorify God. Now how far the glory
of God, in doing and suffering, should be intended and desired by us, in these
considerations I propose.

1. We are to prefer the Lords glory to our own life and salvation: no
point of self-denial, and renouncing of self-pleasing can reach higher then
this, when Christ is willing to be the passive object of the glory of God; Put
me, Father, We glorify God when we are willing that our loss may ^e the
gain of the Lords glory.
to shame and suffering, so thou may be glorified. Paul and Moses are not
far out, but they are far out of themselves, when the one for the glory of
the Lord, in savin^ the people of God, wills his name may be razed out of the
book of life: and the other, to be separated from Christ, for the salvation of
his kinsmen, Gods chosen people. When Abraham is willing that Glory to the Lord
should be written with the ink of his son Isaac's blood; and the Martyrs,
that their pain may praise God, they then level at the right end; for that
must be the most perfect intention, that comes nearest to the most perfect.
This is nearest to Gods intention; for he created, and still works all for
this end, that he may be glorified. Pro. 16.4. Revel. 4.11. Romans 11.37. Now if
Christ put all to sea, and hazard all he has to guard the Lords Name from
dishonor, and made his soul, his life, his heaven, his glory a bridge to keep
dry and safe the Glory of God, that it sink not; and if God would rather his
dear Son should be crowned with the Cross, and his blood squeezed out, with
his precious life, then that any shame should come to his Name, then are we to
interpose our selves, even to sufferings, and shame, for the glory of God.
Suppose a Saint were divided in four, and every member with life in it, and
torment of pain, fixed in the four corners of the heaven, East, and West, and
South, and North, and the soul in the convexity of heaven, under the pain of
the torment of the gnawing worm that can never die, We are to desire that our
pain may prais^ revengi^g justice, in hell, as grace ^e^g^t^neth the glory of
pardoning mercy, in heaven.
these five were obliged to cry with a loud voice, in the hearing of heaven,
of earth, of hell, of Men, and Angels, and all creatures, Glory, glory be to
the spotless and pure justice of the Lord, for this our pain: and when the
damned are noted to speak against their sentence of condemnation, When saw we
thee hungry, and fed thee not? etc. Mat. 25. it is clear they are obliged to
acquiesce to this, that they are made clay-vessels, passively to be filled to
the brim with the glory of revenging justice, and ought in hell to praise the
glory of revenging wrath, as the Saints in heaven are bottles and vessels of
mercy, from bottom to brim, filled with the glory of mercy, to praise his grace
in heaven, who redeemed them: the one Psalm is as due and just as the other.
What the damned do not, or do in the contrary, is their sin. One prayed,
his death, pain, torment, sad afflictions that may out-runne him, ere he
escape into the grave, yea, that his hell might with his own good will be a
printed book, on which Angels and Men may read the glory of inviolable justice.

2. We love that the holinesses and grace of others were God, but we glorify
him not with that which he has given us; We des^re God may be glorified by our
wishes, rather t^^n (...) endeavor to glorify him.
yea, we have a sort of wicked emulation and envy if others glorify God, not
we. Moses acquiesced to Gods dispensation, that the Lord might be glorified in
the peoples possessing of the holy Land, though he himself should not be
their leader, but not at the first. There is a cumbersome piece called, I, ego,
self, that has an itching soul for glory due to another.

Lords glory overweigh our ease, and humor? Master, forbid Eldad and Medad to
Prophecy, says Joshua. No, Moses will have God glorified, be the instruments
who will.

4. There is a two fold glory here due to God. 1. Active; Passive; the glory of
events, We care more for the Lords passiv^ gl^^y of (...) for his active glory
in our duties.
that results from the Lords government of the world; we are to care for both,
but we do it not orderly. We are more careful of Gods passive glory, which
belongs to himself, then we ought to be. Hence say we, what confusions be
there in the world? Nation breaks covenant with Nation; Heresies and
blasphemies prevail; Antichrist is yet on his throne; the Churches over Sea
oppressed, the people of God led to the Shambles, as slaughter-sheep, and
destroyed, and killed. Hundreds of Thousands killed in Ireland, many thousands
in England, and very many thousands about the space of one year taken away in
Scotland, with the Sword and the Pestilence. And ^he Lords justice is not yet
glorified, nor his mercy in avenging the enemies, the cry of the souls under
the Altar is not heard, the Church not delivered. We would here yield patience
to Divine providence; God has more care of his own glory, then we can have.
2. What men takes from God, he can repair infinitely another way. But we are
less anxious for the Lords active glory, to do what is our duty, and serve
him, and glorify him in the sincere use of means. Some learn their
Schoole-fellowes lesson better then their own. For Gods glory of events, we are
to be grieved, when he is dishonored, but not to take the helm of heaven and
earth out of his hand, but leave to God these, who would plunder Christ's Crown
off his head. We have nothing to do in the glory of events, but pray it
flourish: but we take too much ado in it, and we do too little in the other.

5. There is a glory of God; twofold also: one of holiness and grace; another
of bliss and happiness. This I consider, A glory of holiness, and of grace.
In Graces kingdom, the Saints for their holiness, and Titus and the
Brethren, 2 Cor. 8.23. are the glory of Christ. I will place (says the Lord
Esai. 46.13.) salvation in Sion, for Israel my glory. Faithful Pastors take in
cities, and subdue crowns, and kingdoms, to Christ. Paul conquered many
crowns to Christ, Saints are the glory of God, and God (...) the glory of
Saints.
1 Thessalonians. 2.19. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are not
even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? Christ wears
the Church on his head as a crown of glory, Esai. 62.3. How glorious is it to
be for holiness Christ's garland, his diadem, and crown? But in this there
is a rent of the crown of Heaven, a sovereign peculiar flower due to the King
of Ages, that no man must seek after: in this the contexture and frame of the
work of Redemption is so contrived, that 1 Cor. 1.29. No flesh should glory in
his presence. No man can devide the glory of grace with Christ. In the higher
Kingdom, there is a glory ordained for Saints. The Gospel is a glorious piece,
which 1 Cor. 2.7. God has ordained before the world was, unto our glory. 1
These. 2.12. God has called us unto his kingdom and glory. 1 Pet. 5.4. And
when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory,
that fades not away. This is the reward of faithful Elders, that feed the
flock of Christ. The heaven of glory is called the holy heaven, Psalm. 20.6. The
Lord will hear from his holy heaven, and the new Jerusalem the Church, has a
brave crown on her head. Revel. 21.10, 11. She comes down out of heaven from
God, having the glory of God. Grace, grace is a glorious thing.

6. O, but we come short in doing and suffering; when our Our ^ymes are low,
when we intend not the Lords glory.
wants this end of the glorifying God; that adds an excellent luster, beauty,
and glory to all that we do. When Christ, the Father, heaven, are tied to the
furthest end of all our actions, we are above our selves. But we differ little
in our aims from beasts, when the intention rises no higher then this side of
clay and time; Psalm. 49.11. That our houses may continue. Esai. 5.8. That we
may be placed, our alone on the earth.

Verse. ^8. And there came a voice from heaven, saying, I I have both glorified
it, and will glorify it again. In this Answer observe these. 1. The Answer.
2. The air it came from; Four particulars in the answer retur^ed to Christ.
From heaven. 3. The way and manner of its coming; by an audible Voice. 4. The
matter of the Answer. I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

Christ is always answered of his Father: either in the thing he sueth, Christ
praying ever heard.
Joh. 11.42. Or, in that which he fears, Heb. 5.7. Or, by real comfort, Luke
2^.42, 43. Or in a full and perfect deliverance, Psalm. 22.20, 21. compared
with Psalm. 16.10, 11. Acts 24.25. Acts 5.31. Or, in supply of strength for his
suffering, Esai. 50.7, 8.

Its a proof of the worth of Christ's advocation and intercession. If I know my
self to be in Christ's Prayer-booke, in his breast, among Christ's askings of
the Father; its comfortable. Psalm. 2.8. Ask of me, and I will give thee the
heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
possession. When Christ asks souls of the Father, he gives him his asking:
the Lord cannot withhold from this King, the desire of his heart, Psalm. 21.2.
He asked a wife of his Father, and it was granted. Christ will have them all in
one house to be copartners of the Crown of heaven with him: for its his
Prayer, Joh. 17.24. The King and the Queen in one Palace. We cannot fall from
grace, for we stand by Christ's prayers, Luke 22.31, 32. Heb. 9.24.

Our failings in expecti^g an answer of our Prayers.
We have many diseases, in the matter of the return of an answer. 1. We wait
not on an answer; we speak words, we pray not, we breath out natural desires
for spiritual mercies; we have no spiritual feeling of our wants, and there
is an end; Psalm. 18.41. The wicked cry, but there is none to save; they do
not pray, but cry. 2. We storm, and offend that our humor, rather then our
faith is not answered, either at our own time, or that the thing which we ask
to spend on our lusts (as James 4.3.) is not granted. 3. We are more careful,
and troubled, that we are not heard, then anxious to offer the rent, and pay
the calves of our lips, in praying, which is Gods due. Were we as serious in
worshipping in Prayer, as we are desirous of seeking wants, it were good; but
there is more seeking in our Prayer, for our selves, then there is adoring for
God. 4. We employ not Christ as Mediator, and High Priest in praying, and
exercising Faith so much, as we put forth pith and strength of words, that we
may extort rather our needs, then obtain grace; as if praying, and hearing of
prayers, were work and wages, rather then begging, and giving of mere grace.
5. We consider not when we pray, and prayer is not returned in the same coin
that we seek; That the Father hearing Christ's prayers, virtually, and
meritoriously answered all our prayers in substance, and for our good. For, 1.
Christ can cull out, and choose petitions more necessary and fundamental for my
salvation, then I can do. 2. He is answered in all points; We are answered
often in the general, and in as good only. 3. Christ could, with more
submission and sense pray, then we can do. Nature in Christ cannot boast and
compel God to hear prayers; Often our zeal is but natural boasting and
quarrelling, as if we could force God to answer. Grace in Christ (and grace is
the most lowly, and modest thing of the world) prays with all submission, Not
my will, but thy will be done. 4. All prayers are hard for Christ, Ergo, his
prayers are better heard, then the prayers of the Saints; except our prayers be
folded in his prayers, they cannot be answered. The perfume, the sweet odours
of Christ's prayers are so powerful and strong, as coming from God-man in one
person, they must be both asking and giving, desiring and granting, praying and
hearing, flowing from the same person, Christ. When our prayers go to heaven;
Christ, ere they come to the Father, must cast them in a new mould, and leaves
to them his heart, his mouth, though the Advocate takes not the sense and
meaning of the Spirit from them; yet Christ presenting them with his perfume,
he removes our corrupt sense, so as they are Christ's prayers, rather then
ours. Hebr. 13.15. Let us by him (as our High Priest) offer the sacrifice of
praise (then of prayers also) to God continually. The offering is the Priests,
as well as the peoples, Revel. 8.3. and far more here, because Christ by his
Office, is the only immediate person who makes request to God for us. Romans
8.34.

From heaven, All Christ's good, and all ours for him, came from heaven.
Hence, Christ troubled in soul, and afflicted believers on earth, keep
correspondence and compliance with heaven.

1. Christ's prayers, in his saddest days, have their return from heaven.
Posts and Messengers fly with wings between God and a Soul in a praying
disposition: possible, ten Posts in one night. Prayer has an Agent lying at
the Court of heaven, and an open ear there. Psalm. 18.6. He heard my voice out
of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. Christ takes
care that the Messenger get presence, and be quickly dispatched with a return.
Psalm. 102.19. The Lord (ere the Messenger come) looked down from the height of
his Sanctuary, Verse. 20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those
that are appointed to death. So Lam. 3. Tears lie in heaven as Solicitors with
God, until he hear; Mine eye trickleth down, and cease not, Verse. 50. Till
the Lord look down, and behold from heaven. 1 King. 8.30. Hear thou in the
heaven, thy dwelling place, and when thou hear, forgive: says Solomon.
Isai. 63.15. Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
holiness. Our Savior has appointed the Post-way in that Prayer, Our Father
which art in heaven. We have a Friend there who receives the Packet; An high
Priest set at the right hand of the throne of Majesty, Heb. 8.1. Who has
passed into the heavens, Heb. 4.14. And is made higher then the heavens, Heb.
7.26. And lives for ever to make intercession for us, Verse. 25.

Christ's hardest straits comfort came out of this air. Luke 22.43. When he
was in his saddest agony, there appeared to him an Angel from heaven
strengthening him. In his lowest condition, when he was in the cold grave
among the dead, heaven was his Magazin of help and comforts. Mat. 28.2. An
Angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone. Heaven came
to his bedside, when he was sleeping in the clods.

3. The Saints have daily traffiquing with heaven: O my dear Psalm. 73.25. Whom
have I in heaven but thee? What, are not Angels, Prophets, Apostles, and Saints
there? Yea; but we have no acquaintance by way of mediation in that Land, but
Christ: he is the choice Friend there. 1 Cor. 15.47. The second Man (both
first, highest, second and all) is the Lord from heaven.

4. All our good, every perfect gift comes from heaven, Jam. Manna came not
from the clouds. How then? Joh. 6.32. My Father gives you the true bread from
heaven. We are ill lodged in bits of sick and groaning clay; our best house is
in heaven. 2 Cor. 5.2. We groaning, desire to be clothed with our house from
heaven.

5. The earth is but the believers Sentinel, or at best, his These. 1.10. We
wait for the Son of God from heaven. Our life and treasure is there. Mat. 6.20.
Lay up treasure for your selves in heaven. Our (...), our city-dwelling and our
haunting is in heaven, Phil. 1.21.

What acquaintance have ye in heaven? what bloud-friend have you in that Land?
The wicked man, (...) is, Use.

the man of the earth. And Psalm. 17.14. Save me from men of time; men of this
life. Are you a Burgess of time, or a Citizen of the earth? or a man of the
higher Jerusalem? Imagine there were a newfound Land on earth, and in it there
be twelve Summers in one Year, all the stones of the Land are Sapphires,
Rubies, Diamonds; the clay of it, the choicest gold of Ophir; the trees do
bear Apples of life; How easy traffiquing with heaven is to the Saints.
the inhabitants can neither be sick nor die; the passage to it, by sea and
land, is safe; all things there are to be had for nothing, without money,
price, or change of commodities; and gold is there for the gathering: if there
were such a Land as this, what an huge navy would be lying in the Harbors and
Ports of that Land? how many Travelers would repair thither? Heaven is a new
Land that the Mediator Christ has found out, it is better then a Land where
there is a Summer for every Month of the Year; there is neither winter, nor
night there; the Land is very good, and the fruits of it delectable and
precious; grace and peace, righteousness, joy of the Holy Ghost, the fruits of
that Kingdom, Romans 14.17. are better then Rubies, Saphyrs, or Diamonds: Christ
the tree of life is above all Lands on earth, even his alone: and there is no
need of price or money in this Kingdom; grace is the cheapest thing of the
world; wine and milk are here without money, and without price, Esaias 55.1. Its
a Land that stands most by the one only commodity of Grace and Glory. Oh,
there is little traffiquing with heaven; when was you last there? It is an
easy passage to heaven; David, who often prayed even seven times a day, was
often a day there. Prayer in faith is but one short Post thither. Oh we have
too much compliance with the earth.

A voice. The third particular in this Return, is the Manner: In an Lord
answers him. The multitude heard this voice, though they understood it not.
We read not often of an audible voice from heaven to Christ; only at his
Baptism, there was a testimony given of him from heaven, Mat. 3.16, 17. and at
his Transfiguration, Mat. 17. of which Peter speaks, 2 Pet. 1.18. And this
voice we heard, when we were with him on the holy Mount. The Lord, in the
hearing of men, gives a testimony of his Son Christ, and his good cause. He
was accused because he made himself the Son of God; he prays to God, and
calls him Father, openly; a voice from heaven openly answering, acknowledges
him to be the Son of God; though they knew not the Lords testimony from heaven.
God makes a good cause, God ^^areth a good cause, though darkened.
though darkened, to shine as daylight, if men would open their eyes and see.
Psalm. ^7.5. Roll over thy way upon the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall
bring it to pass. But flesh and blood says, Innocence lies in the dark, and
weepeth in sackcloth in the dungeon, and is not seen. The Lord answers,
Verse. 6. And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
judgment as the noonday. It is true, (...) signifies to go from one place to
another; its here applied to the sun, and elsewhere to things that grow out of
the earth, Judge. 13.14. The sun in the night seems dead, and lost, as if there
were no such thing; yet the morning is a new life to the day, and the sun.
The grape of the wine tree sown in the earth, is a dead thing; yet it
springs in some days, and comes to be a fruitful tree. Christ was
crucified, and buried; yet the Wine-tree grew again: and, Romans 1.4. He was
declared to be the Son of God, with power, according to the Spirit of
sanctification, by the resurrection from the dead. The Gospel, and a good cause
seems buried, and weeps in a dungeon. Joseph in the prison, and a sold
stranger; yet in the eyes of his brethren he is exalted. The Lord cleared
Daniels cause. Psalm. 97.11. Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the
upright in heart. The light and joy of the Saints, are often under the clods of
the earth.

1. The Reformation of Religion goes veiled under the mask of Rebellion, and of
subverting Fundamental Laws; but God must give to this work, that is now on
the wheels, in Britain, the right name, and call it, The building of the old
waste places, The rearing up of the Tabernacle of David; and cause it come
above the earth.

2. The cross is that great stumbling block, The scandal of the cross
removed.
for which many are offended at Christ and the Gospel. It is a sad and
offensive Providence to see joy weep, glory shamed; this is the gall, the
wormwood, the salt of the cross, that the Lord of life should suffer in his
own person: yet here is heaven and the Father speaking, and returning a
comfortable answer to Christ, in that which he most feared. The cross makes
an ill report of the Gospel and Christ: for this the Apostles are made a
theater, a gasing-stock to Men and Angels, a worlds wonder; and Paul would take
this away, Ephesians. 3.13. Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my
tribulation. Then Saints may fall a swooning at the very sight of the cross in
others. And Peter, 1 Pet. 4.12. says, (...), Be not stricken with wonders, or
astonished, as at new things and miracles, Acts 17.20. when ye are put to a
fiery trial. The comforts of the cross are the sweet of it, and the
honey-combs of Christ, that drop upon that sour tree.

3. That the Father says from heaven, There shall grow the fairest and most
beautiful Rose that ever higher or lower Paradise yielded, out of this crabbed
thorn, A fair rose grows out of the cross when Christ waters it.
was much consolation to Christ. Here grows out of the side and banks of the
lake of that river of fire and wrath that Christ was plunged in, many sweet
flowers: as, 1. A victorious Redeemer, who overcame hell, sin, devils, death,
the world. 2. A fair and spotless righteousness. 3. A redeemed, a washed and
sanctified Spouse to the Lamb. 4. A new heaven and a new earth; behold, He
has made all things new, and has cast heaven and earth in a new mould. 5. A
new Kingdom, a new Crown to the Saints, a choiser Paradise then the first that
Adam lost. 6. Riches of Free Grace, unsearchable treasures of mercy and love:
all these blossom out of the Cross.

4. The Cross is bought by, and in its nature much altered to the Saints. Its
true, its become a necess^ry inlet, and an inevitable passage, The Cross a
p^sse that Christ keeps.
and a bridge to heaven; but the Lord Jesus, not Satan, keeps the pass, and
commands the bridge; and lets in, and leteth out Passengers at his
pleasure. But 1. Christ has strawed the way to heaven with blood and wars,
and forbids us to censure his sad Patrimony, in that the servants are no worse
then the Lord, and flower of all the Martyrs; though blood has been, and must
be the Rent and In-come of the Crown of the noble King of Kings, and the
consecrated Captain of our salvation. Yet it is short, and for a moment, and
Christ has a way of out-gate, that none of his shall be buried under the
Cross, Revel. 7.14. Psalm. 4.19. (2.) Christ has broken the iron chains of
the Cross, and the gates of brass: that the Cross has but a number of free
Prisoners, who have fair quarters, and must go out with flying colors, and
be ransomed from the grave, John 16.33. Hos. 13.14. (3.) When you are in glory,
and in a place above death; there shall be neither mark, nor print; no ceatrix
of the sad cross, on back or shoulder, but the very furrow of tears wiped
away, and perfectly washen off the face with the water of life, For the former
things shall be away. Death altered by Christ.
Revel. 21.4. Yea, the saddest of Crosses, the utmost and last blow that the
Cross can inflict, is death. I should think that Christ is the Saints factor
in the land of death; He was there himself, and though he will not adjourne
death, yet has our Factor made it cheap, and at an easy rate, all tole and
custom is removed, and he has put a negation upon death, Joh. 11.26. He that
believes shall not die. John 14.19. Much depends on our wise husbanding of
the rod of God; yet if Christ did not manage, order, and oversee our furnace,
it could not be well with us.

I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

This is the fourth considerable point, the matter of the Answer.

Here is a Lord-Speaker from heaven, testifying that the Lords name shall be,
and was glorified: How the Lord was glorified in Christ.
As 1. In Christ's person and incarnation, Joh. 1.14. The word was made flesh,
and dwelt amongst us, and we beheld his glory. So the Angels did sing at his
birth. Luke 2.14. Glory to God on the highest. Christ's laying aside of God.
Joh. 2.11. This first When he cured the Paralytick man, Luke 2.12. they were
amazed and glorified God. When he raised Jairus his daughter. Luke 7.16. There
3. In all his life he went about doing good; and sought ( John 8.49.) to
glorify God was in singular manner glorified. When the Centurion (Luke 23.49.)
saw what was done, he glorified God. The repenting Theife preached him on the
Cross to be a King: and this was a glorifying of Christ in his greatest
abusement and shame. Yea, his glory was preached by the Sun, when it was,
contrary to the course of nature, darkened: and by the Rocks, when they were
rent, and the Temple cloven asunder, and the Graves opened, when men weakly,
or wickedly denied him, and would not only not preach his glory, being
declared to be the Son of God, and obtained a name above all names, and was
by the right hand of God, exalted to be a Savior, and a Prince, to give
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins, Phil. 2.9. Ephesians. 1.20. Act.
5.31. Act. 3.13. (6.) He shall come again in his glory, Math. And shall be
glorified and admired in all his Saints. (2 Thessalonians. 1.10.) The fairest and most
glorious sight, that ever the eye of man saw, shall be, when Christ shall come
riding through the clouds, on his Chariot of glory, accompanied with his
mighty Angels, and with one pull, or shake of his mighty arms, shall cause the
Stars to fall from heaven, as figs fall from a fig tree, shaken with a
mighty wind, and blow out all these candles of heaven with one blast of his
ire; and A fire shall go before him, and burn up the earth with the works
that are therein; when the higher house of heaven, and the lower of the earth
shall meet together, and when Mystical Christ shall be glorified.

If there be so much glory in Jesus Christ, and his sufferings as he must bear
the glory, Zach. 6.13. Use 1.
And All the glory of his fathers house be upon him, Esai. 22.24. His Crown of
glory on his head, must be so weighty, and ponderous, with Rubies, Saphires,
Diamonds, that it will break the neck of any mortal man, King, or Parliament
to bear it. None on earth have a head or shoulders, for this so weighty a
Diadem; Parliaments have not necks worthy to carry Christ's golden bracelets,
nor a back to be honored with his robe Royal; if they will but take his
Scepter in their hand, it shall crush them as clay-vessels: this stone hewn
out of the Mountain without hands, shall crush the clay-leggs of Parliaments,
and then how shall they stand?

Use 2.
God properly glorifies himself; Angels and Men are but chamberlaines and
factors, to pay the rent of his glory; and because he will give himself, his
Son, his Spirit to us, and his grace, and yet will not give his glory to
another; let us beware to intercept the rents of the Crown. We have grace,
but must not share with the Lord in his glory.


Object. The Lord gives grace and glory, Psalm. 84. And he has a crown of
glory laid up for his Saints, in the heavens.

Answ. That glory is but matured and ripened grace, Gods glory is the eminent,
celebrious, and high esteem that Men and Angels have of God, as God, or the
foundation of this; to meddle with this is to encroach upon the Crown and
Prerogative royal of God. How the glory of God and grace do differ.
Glory imparted to Saints in heaven, is but a beam, a luster, shadow, or way
of that transcendent and high glory that is in God; and is as far different
from the incommunicable glory of God, as the shadow of the Sun in a Glass,
or in the bottom of a Fountain, and the Sun in firmament. We may desire the
chips, and shaddows, and rays of glory, but beware that we meddle not with
that which devels and men, always seek after, in a sacrilegious way.

Use 3.
3. We are hence taught, to admire the excellency of the unsearchable knowledge
and skill of Divine providence; out of Christ's abasing himself to take on him
our nature. 2. Out of his miracles, God art of omnipotency in extracting glory
out of all the b^sest and most shameful things of the world.
that were just nothing to blind-naturall-men. 3. Out of his death and shame,
the Lord extracteth the most eminent and high glory of his name. That
Omnipotency should triumph in the jaw bone of an Ass, in a straw, in a
crucified man, commends the glory of God, and the art of his workmanship; to
make Gold out of clay and iron, Diamonds and Rubies out of the basest stones,
would extol the art of man. A creation out of nothing; and Flowers, Roses,
Forests, Woods, out of cold earth, is the praise of the wisdom and power of
the Creator; the baser the matter be, the art of the Author is the more
glorious, if the work be curious and excellent.

God here 1. Out of death, shame, sinful oppressing of the Lord of glory,
raises the high work of man's Redemption. 2. When we spill business and mar
all, through sinning and provoking God, then Israel must bring a spilt
business to God, that he may right them, Judge. 3.10, 11. God can find the
right end of the thread, when matters are ravelled, and disordered. We see now,
Nations confounded, enemies rising against: us. But blood, wars, confusions,
oppression, and crushing down of Christ and his Church, are good and congruous
means, when they have the vantage of being handed by omnipotency. When we
work, the instrument must be as big as a mountain, and then our eye cannot
see God, All things most base are most corgruous for high ends, when
omnipotency handle^h them.
for the bigness of the Instrument. God regards not the nothings, and the
few that he works withal. Dead men can sight, when God puts a sword in
their hand; Men shall fall under wounded men: beware of robbing God of his
glory. Did ever a decree or a counsel of God part with child? Or can
Omnipotency bring forth untimely births, or prove abortive? You see Christ now
in the death-house of Adams sons, and wrestling with hell; yet God by Christ
at the weakest, works his end; death is a low thing, sin is far more base;
but when God acts at the end of either, they have a scope and end as high as
God, to glorify God.

3. If God has been, and must be glorified in all that is done* what do we
do, we trouble our selves to seek glory one of another. We are created for
this end, Glory from men a vaint thing.
and its our glory to fetch in glory to God. What? can the aerie applause of
men be golden stilts for creeples to walk to heaven withal? Or can the
peoples poor Hosannas be silken sails to our ship, or golden wings, that by
these you man sail and fly up to heaven? Where is Belshazzer, who but built a
house for the glory of his own name? Where is Herod, who did receive one word
of a God, which the people did steal? Do not these fools take little room
in print, and at this day, as little in the clods of the earth? The Roman State
would not permit Christ to be a God: What was their doom, must not a Kingdom
cast its bloome, fall, and wither, that will not suffer Christ to be a King in
his Church?

Verse. 29. The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said it thundered:
others said, an Angel spoke to him. Another effect of the Prayer of Christ,
does follow in the people. They had sundry judgments of this Answer from
heaven: Some said it was a thunder; for they understood it not. Others, nay,
but it is above nature; An Angel has spoken to him.

It thundered. Does not any rude shepherd, or the most simple idiot know a
thunder? Its a place that holds forth to us, how ignorant we are of God, and of
the Gospel-way. Consider what was in this Answer: Many false opinions touching
the Gospel.
1. It was the Gospel. In what language it was spoken, (belike not in a known
language) cannot be determined out of the Text. 2. It was a clear expression
of that Communion between Christ and his Father. 3. What God means, or what is
his sense in his word or works, is unknown to us. 4. That they say the Gospel
is a thunder, and a work of nature, is a mere imagination and a dream. Yet
these ways are among themselves all false, and they do not agree one with
another.

Consid. 1. The Gospel is the will of God from heaven; yet Mat. 13.14. In the
Law it is written, The Gospel dark to many.
With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people, 1 Cor.
14.21. And, Isai. 29.11. And the vision of all is become unto you as the words
of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying,
Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I cannot: for it is sealed. Verse. 12.
And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I
pray thee. And he says, I cannot; I am not learned. 1 Cor. 1.18. For the
preaching of the cross is to

God must use Logic to our affections, as well as to our mind, ere we know him
^^vingly.
Consid. 2. God reasons not only with men's minds, to convince them; but also
with their will and affections. Act. 9. Christ from heaven proposes a
Syllogism to Readiness fury, Its hard for thee to kick against pricks. God has
Logic against anger, which has neither cares nor reason; for if he could not
out-argue Laban's hatred, and the haters of the Saints, to whom he says,
Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm, Psalm. 107. he would not
speak to their affections, nor would it be said, that in their affections they
repute Christ and the Gospel foolishness, if there were not a contrariety
between the affections and the Gospel.

Consid. 3. The understanding is a dark-lanthorne, that has The mind dark in
the things of God.
to apprehend things above hand: and as the will is irony and stiff to heaven,
so is it waxy and apt to receive the impressions of the flesh, except Christ
draw-by the curtain of the flesh, to let you see the glory of the Gospel.
Otherwise, God speaks, and Samuel says, Eli, here am I; for thou calledst me.
To the woman of Samaria, Jacob is greater then Christ; and Jacob's Well, as
good as the water of life. Justice often puts one seal on the Gospel, and
another on the man's two eyelids, that the vision is as dark as midnight.

Consid. 4. The communion between Christ and the soul, Christ and the Father,
is quid pro quo, a thunder, a work of nature, or any thing to the natural man;
God speaking to the heart, is a mystery to him. Joh. 6.52. The Jews say among
themselves, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? Very hardly, according
to their Papisticall fancy of a bodily eating. 2. The high esteem of Christ
above other Beloveds, is a mystery to natural Saints, in so far as they are
natural. Its a strange question for Professors of the Gospel to say, What more
is in Christ then other Well-beloveds? Yet they say it, Cant. 5.9. (3.) The
natural understanding is the most whorish thing in the world: The
understanding vain.
There is a variety of fancied gods there. According to the number of thy
cities, were thy gods, O Judah, Jer. 2.29. They have made them molten images of
their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, Hos. 13.2. The
understanding, even in the search of truth amongst the creatures, is a rash,
precipitate, and unquiet thing; and like a Silk-worme, first makes a work of
many threads, and then lies fettered and entangled in that which came out of its
own bowels. The mind spins and weaves out of it self, fancies, dreams, lies,
and then its work must be spent on these, and so creates its own chains and
fetters. But in the matters of God it runs mad, plays the wanton; in the
Gospel-knowledge it turns frantic, and when it comes to move and act within
the sphere of supernatural truths, it but laughs and sports till it come out
again. 1 Cor. 1.23. If Christ preached be foolishness, then Christ himself
must be a fool to the Grecians, the excellentest wits in the world. 1 Cor.
2.14. The Gospel cannot come within the brain of a natural man, but as a
notionall fancy, a chymera. Yea, when the greatest wits came to the borders of
divine truth* to look on the outside of Divinity, called Theologia naturalis,
to look on the Lords back-parts, and contemplate and behold God in his works,
they knew not what to make of God, Romans 1.23. Some thought God to be a dainty
Bird of Paradise; nay, said other great wits, he is a foure-footed Beast; nay,
said another, but he is a creeping thing: and the most eminent of them, even
head of wit among them, said, he was a corruptible man: yea, all of them,
(...). They turned vain, foggie, reasonlosse, and stark naught in their finer
discourses and reasonings, in weighing and poyzing things. Genesis 6.5. The frame
of the heart of man is only evil. (...) Genesis 8.21. signifies, a Potters
vessel. Esaias 29.16. Your turning of things up-side-down, shall be reputed as
the clay (...) of the potter: From the root (...) to think, desire; to form a
thing of clay as the potter does. From this is the potter named (...) Zach.
11.13. Genesis 2.7. Deuteronomy. 31.21. I know their imaginations, or earthen pots, that
be in the heart, mind, and head of men. Many vain frames are in our heads, as
there be variety of pots, bottles, and earthen vessels in the potters house.
Many wind-mills, many pitchers and clay-frames are in the vain heart, but they
are evil, wicked, and only evil from the womb. But especially, how many
devices and new moulds of Religions, and sundry gods are in the heart of men?
How many sundry opinions of Christ, are in men's brains? for concerning Christ,
Mat. 16.14. Some said he was John Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah. 4.
The love and affections are most whorish, light, and wanton; if Martha seek not
one thing, The affections vain.
she seeks many things: no one God is the natural man's God. It may be
maintained, that an unrenewed man has not one predominant, but indefinitely,
sin is his king; and as many sins, as many kings. Romans 5.14, 17. Romans 6.7, 8,
9. A natural man has not one certain predominant.
Its true, pride, covetousness, or some particular sins may come to the throne
by turns, as either complexion, strength of corrupt nature, or times bear
sway; for as Satan is not divided against Satan, so not any natural man will
be a Martyr for a false god, or a predominant lust, in opposition to another
known false god, though all may oppose the Gospel. The Lord complains of a
whorish heart, that plays the harlot with many lovers, Jer. 3.1. and heaven
and saving grace stands on an indivisible point, like the number of seven; one
added, one removed, varieth the nature: no man is half in heaven, half in
hell: almost a Christian, is no Christian. When Adam fell from one God, he
fell upon many inventions; not upon one only, Eccles. 7.29. Our wandering is
infinite, and has no home: either God is a thunder, or then he is an Angel,
speaking from heaven.

Consid. 5. Men think the supernatural ways of God a thunder in the air,
which is a most natural work; We are heterodox and heretical in
mis-interpreting the works of God as well as his word.
the ebbing and Spirit, either natural joy or melancholy, naturally following
the complexion of the body. Its Grace that puts a right sense on the works of
God, as on the word: we are no less heterodox in mis-interpreting the ways
and works of God, then in putting false and unsound senses on his word. Emrods
plagues the Philistines; they doubt if chance, or if the God of Israel have
thus plagued them. Moses works miracles, the Magicians work miracles, and the
Egyptians doubt whether their false god, or the living God that made the heaven
and the earth, has wrought the miracles. When God and Nature both work,
natural men, or Saints as natural, betake themselves to the nearest God. As
sickness comes, the natural man says, Neglect of the body, health, the
moon, humors, the air, cold weather did it; but he looks not to God. And the
believer, guilty of a breach of the Sixth Command, in neglecting second causes,
and in needless hurting the body, sees not this; but fathers all upon God,
only in a spiritual dispensation, and considers only dispensation in God,
not sin in himself. 2. Mercies grow invisibly, and we see not; we are ready
to sleep at mercies offered. When Christ knocks in love, we are in bed; Cant.
5. (3.) Judgments speak in the dark, but we hear not: the Lord fatteneth
some slaughter-oxen for hell, and death, is on some men's faces, even the second
death on their person, but they see not. To hear the Lords rods, and who has
appointed it, is the man of Wisdoms part, Micha 6.9. There is an Orthodoxe
Wisdom and Will, A Heterodox will.
as there is an Orthodox Faith. Will, as well as the mind, can frame
Syllogismes; every unrenewed man has a faith of his own in the bottom of his
will. 2 Pet. 3. Some are willingly ignorant; Some Jer. 9. through deceit refuse
to know the Lord; whereas lusts puts out reason, and takes the chair. Lust
has stout Logic against Christ; a fleshly mind vainly puffed up, is a badge
of bastard wit, out-reasoning all the Gospel. O but grace is quick-eyed,
sharp, and a witty thing, to see God veiled in, under the curtain of flesh;
to see Christ and heaven through words, and the Gospel with child of so great
a salvation.

Consid. 6. What wonder that there be divisions about Christ. Division the
birth of weak minds.
Some will have the Lord speaking from heaven, a thunder; others, an Angel.
Christ is the most disputable thing in the world, Math. 16.13, 14. there be
five Religions, and sundry opinions touching Christ, the Scribes and Pharisees
had many sundry opinions, and one of them is the right way only, and ten
false. Joh. 7.40. Many say Christ is a Prophet. Verse. 41 Others said, this is
the Christ; Others no: Shall Christ come out of Galile, and there was a
division among them Luke 2.34. Christ is for a sign that shall be spoken
against. And amongst Christ's sufferings this is one, Hebr. 12.3. He sustained
(...), contradiction of sinners. Math. 24. Many false Christ's shall arise.
There is but one heaven, and one way to heaven; and there is but one hell: but
there be thousands of ways to hell: Sin and error broodie, truth but one.
from one point to another, you can draw but one straight line; but you may
draw tenn^ thousand crooked, and circular lines. The truth is one, and very
narrow, the lie is broad and very fertile, and broodie, error is infinite. Its
a blessed thing to find wisdom to hit upon Christ, and adhere to him; ^en
erri^g, though in non-fundamentals may displease God, and deface truth* and he
damned eternally.
there be some dicets and couseners, Ephesians. 4.14. that lie in wait to deceive
the simple; and they cast the dice for heaven, and can cast you up any thing on
the dice, either one, or seven; do ye then resign your selves in this wood of
false Religions that now is, to Christ, to be led to heaven. Many now teach,
there be some few fundamentals, believe them, and live well, and you are saved.
And many false Teachers that turn the Gospel upside down, say, it is the same
Gospel, though the head be where the feet should be; and for errors, we wrong
not truth, so long as we hold nothing against fundamentals: Should a man remove
the roof of your house, cut down the timber of it, and pick out all the fair
stones in the wall, and say, Friend, I wrong not your house, see, the
foundation stones are safe, and the four corner stones are sure, in the mean
time, the house can fence off neither wind nor rain, would not this man both
mock you, and wrong you? He that keeps the foundation Christ, shall be saved,
though he build on it hay and stubble, 1 Cor. 3. Its true. But it was never the
intent of the Holy Ghost, That a man believing some few fundamentals, though he
hold, and spread lies and false Doctrines, is in no hazard of damnation; or
that he has liberty of conscience, to add to the foundation hay, and
stubble, and untempered mortar: and to daube dirt upon the foundation Christ,
and not sin, the place speaks no such thing, but of this else where.

Others said it was an Angel. These come nearer to the truth; for they conceive
there is more in this voice, then a work of Nature, such as a thunder is; they
think, an Angel spoke to Christ; and they are convinced, that Christ keeps
correspondence with Heaven and Angels.

Angels have been, and are in high estimation among men always; and there is
reason for it.

1. There is more of Heaven in Angels, and more of God, then in any of their
fellow creatures. El^ct A^g^ls kept fast their ^t the right.
Sinful men have been stricken with fear at the sight of them; they are
persons of a more excellent country then the earth. John the Apostle did
overvalue an Angel, Revel. 19. Revel. 21. And fell down to worship him.

2. Angels elect and chosen, never lost their birthright of creation, as Men
and Devils have done; they were created as the Lilies and Roses, which no
doubt, had more sweetness of beauty and smell, before the sin of man made them
vanity-sick, To. 8.20. but they have kept their robes of innocence, their cloth
of gold above five thousand years, without one spark of dirt, or change of
color, for they never sinned; innocence and freedom from sin, has much of
God. Adam (as many think) kept not his garments clean one day. Courtiers of
heaven, and Saints should walk like Angels, and keep good quarters with
Christ. Grace is a pure, clean, innocent thing; teaches Saints to deny
ungodliness; and so much the more have Angels of God, that they are among
devils and sinful men, and yet by Grace are kept from falling; the more
grace, the more innocence. Grace as pardoning has its result from sin, but
is most contrary to sin. Grace pays debt for sin, but takes not on new
arreares; its abused grace that does so.

2. But these thus convinced, that the Lords voice is more then a thunder. Go
no further, they say here, others said it was an Angel.

Hence touching conviction.

Pos. 1. Conviction of conscience may be strong, and yet Never man spoke like
this man, say the Jews, yet they hate him. Conviction how far it goes.
Joh. 7.28. Jesus cried in the temple, as he taught, saying, Ye both know me,
and ye know whence I am; I am not come of my self, but he that sent me is
true, whom ye know not. Verse. 29. But I know him. Then they knew Christ, for
conviction, and they knew him not; for, they crucified the Lord of glory; and
if they had known him under the supernatural notion of the Lord of glory, they
would not have crucified him, Light is a cumbersome captive.
1 Cor. 2.8. Felix trembles, and is convinced, but imprisons Paul. The Devils
believe there is a God, and tremble, Iam. 2. but Light is made a captive, and
made a prisoner, Romans 1.18. Its a most troublesome prisoner, it holds the
conqueror waking, and yet he cannot be avenged on it.

Pos. 2. Conviction turned to malice, becomes a Devil; the Pharisees
convinced, go on against heaven, and the operation of the Holy Ghost.
Conviction with malice most devil-like.
And the Jews saw the face of Stephen, as it had been the face of an Angel,
Acts 6.15. Yet Acts 7.57* 58. they run on him, and stone him to death.

Pos. 3. Conviction makes more judicial hardening then any Joh. 12.37, ^8.
Though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not. A
reason is, He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their

Will heresy more dangerous then minde-heresie.
Pos. 4. Omnipotency of grace can only convince the will. heart.

Preachers may convince the mind, and remove mind-heresie, but Christ only
can give ^ares to love, fear, sorrow, and remove will-heresie, John 6.45.
There be reasonings and Logic in the will, stronger then these in the mind;
the will has reason why it will not be taken with Christ, Joh. 5.40. and a
Law, Romans 7.23. of sin, why it is sweet to perish, and death is to be chosen.

Pos. 5. It is the right conviction of the Spirit, to be convinced; 1. Of
unbelief: Its right conviction when love is convinced to duties that lie under
the drop of the cross.
2. Of the excellency of Jesus that I must have Christ, cost me what it will;
say it were all that the rich Merchant has, Math. 13.45, 46. There is a white
and red in his face, has convinced the man's love, and has bound his
affection, hand and foot; that he takes pains on despised duties that lie
under the very drop of the shame of the Cross, Acts 5.4.

Pos. 6. To be willing to do a duty that has shame written Apostles were, and
for an honorable Lord of counsel, as Joseph of Arimathea was, to petition to
have the body of a crucified man to bury, it being a duty near of blood to
the Cross; both apparent loss, and present shame, is a strong demonstration,
that the whole man, not the mind only, but the will and affections are
convinced. Some duties grow among thorns, as to be killed all the day long,
and to take patiently the spoiling of our goods, for Christ. Some duties grow
among Roses, and are honorable and glorious duties; as to kill and subdue, in
a lawful war, the enemies of God. The former are no sign of wrath, nor the
latter of being duly convinced of the excellency of Christ, except in so far
as we use them, through the grace of Christ, as becomes Saints; or abuse
them, but it is more like Christ to suffer for him, then to do for him.

Pos. 7. God will have some half gate to heaven, though they should dye by the
way; some are more, some less convinced: Gospel is not such a messenger as the
Raven that returns not again: Esaias 55.11. My word that goes forth out of my
mouth, it shall not return to me void, it shall accomplish that which I
please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. The Gospel, and
opportunity of reformation, falls not in the Sea-bottome, when a Nation
receive it not, but it returns to God to speak tidings: We will not give an
account of the Gospel, but the Gospel gives an account of us. 2. Even when the
Ordinances are rejected, they prosper, Esaias 55.11. to harden men: they are seed
sown, and rain fallen on the earth, they yield a crop of glory to God, even a
sweet savor to God, A d^spised Gospel prosperous.
in those that perish, as in those that are saved; 2 Cor. 2.15, 16. The lake of
fire and brimstone, as a just punishment of a despised Gospel, smells like
Roses to God.

30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your
sake.

31. Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the Prince of this world be
judged.

Now follows the other effect of Christ's Prayer, toward the world.

1. In general. The Prayer is answered (says Christ) not so much for my
cause, to comfort me, (for he might otherwise be comforted) as for you, that
ye may believe in me, hearing this testimony from heaven. 2. In particular:
He sets down the fruit of his death. 1. On the unbeleeving world, they shall
be judged and condemned. 2. On the spiritual enemies, and by a Synecdoche, the
head of them, Satan, the god of this world shall be cast out, and sin, and
death, and hell with him. 3. The prime fruit of all, Verse. 32. When I am
crucified, by my Spirit of grace, the fruit of the merit of my death, I will
draw all men to me.

This voice came not because of me. Christ's well and woe, his joy, his sorrow,
is relative, and for sinners. Christ as Christ is a very public person, and a
giving-out Mediator. And it adds much to the excellency of things, that they
are public, and made out to many: As the sun, the stars, the rain, the seas,
the earth, that are for many, are so much the more excellent: It is a broader
and a larger goodness, that is public. Heaven is an excellent thing, because
public, to receive so many crowned Kings, and Citizens, that are redeemed from
the earth. Christ a most public person.
The Gospel is a public good for all sinners: Eternity is not a particular
duration, as time is, that has a poor point to begin with, and end at; but
the public good of Angels and glorified Spirits. Time indeed is a public
thing, but because its the heritage of perishing things, it is not public in
comparison of eternity. And Christ, because a public Spirit, for the whole
family of elect Angels and Saints in heaven and earth, is a matchless
excellent one. Heaven and all things there most public, and so much the more
excellent.
And its observable, that there is nothing in heaven, that is the seat and
element of happiness, and the only Garden and Paradise of the Saints
felicity, but it is public and common to all: The inhabitants the glorified
Saints and Angels, all see the face of him that sits on the Throne, (of
degrees of fruition, I speak not;) they all drink of the river of water of
life; all have access to eat of the apples of the tree of life, there is no
forbidden fruit in heaven; all have the blessing of the immediate presence of
the Lamb, and there is neither need of Sun, or Moon, or light of a candle to
any; all equally enjoy eternity, there is one Lease and Terme-day to the lowest
inhabitant of glory, and that is eternity; there is common to them all one
City, the streets whereof are transparent gold; that the poorest inhabitants of
a Town, walk on a street of gold of Ophir, is a great praise to the City: it is
common to them all that they shall never sigh, never be sad, never sicken,
never be old, never die; and eternal life is common to them all: and then all
feel the smell of the fairest Rose that Angels or Men can think on, the
Flower, the only delight, the glory, the joy of heaven, the Lord Jesus; all
walk in white, and can sin no more. Then, a public Spirit, who is for many, is
the excellentest Spirit. Men of private spirits, who carry a reciprocation of
designs only to themselves, and die and live with their own private
interests, are bad men. When our self is the circle, both center and
circumference, we are so much like the devil, who is his own god, adores
himself, and would have God to adore him, Mat. 4.9. Now, Christ is the most
public, relative, and communicative Spirit and Lord that is. 1. All Christ's
offices are for others then himself: He is not a Mediator of one: A Redeemer
is for captives, a Savior for sinners, a Priest for offenders and trespassers,
a Prophet for the simple and ignorant, a King to vindicate from servitude, all
that are in bondage; the Physician for the si^k: and this speaks for you,
sinners. 2. Why did he empty himself, Luke 19.10. 1 Timothy 1.15. and come into
the world* (...) sinners. 3. Why was he a fitted Sacrifice to die? Joh. 7.19.
For their sake also sanctify I my self, that they also may be sanctified by
the truth. 4. His dying was a public and relative good. Joh. 10.10 For his
sheep. For, Joh. 15.13. his friends. For, Romans 5.10. his enemies. For his Wife,
to present a Bride without spot or wrinkle to God, Ephesians. 5.25, 26. Christ's
^ffi^e warrants us to apply him.
(5.) And he rose again for us, even for our justification, Romans 4.25. (6.)
And whose cause does Christ advocate in heaven now? Ours. For us, if we sin,
1 John 2.1. he intercedes for us, Heb. 7.25. That we may have boldness to
enter into the holy of holiest, Heb. 10.19. (7.) Christ has so public an
heart, that he longs to return again, and to see us, Joh. 14.3. I will come
again, and receive you to my self. A Surety is a very relative person, and
for another: the head is for all the members, the meanest and lowest: and it is
not enough to him to rent the heaven, and dig a hole in the skies once, when
he was incarnate, but he makes a second journey in coming down to rent the
heaven, and fetch his Bride up to himself. They are hence rebuked, that so
improve Christ, as if he were a Jewel locked up in a Cabinet in heaven, to be
touched and made use of by none: Oh, I am a sinner, I am a wretched captive*
what have I then to do with so precious a Lord, as Christ? But, I pray, (1.)
wherefore is Christ a Savior? is he not for sinners? Wherefore a Redeemer? is
it that he should lie by God, as useless? was he not a Redeemer for captives?
(2.) What if all the world should say so? Christ should be a Savior, and save
none; a Redeemer, and ransom none at all; for all are sinners, all are
captives. Christ's very office begets an interest in the sick to the Physician:
Claim thine interest, O sick sinner.

Now this voice was unknown to those that heard it, and yet it was for men
that understood it not: Christ acts for us, when we are sleeping. The people
of God were to be seventy years in Babylon, and were going on in their
obstinacy, yet Much of the busi^^sse of our salvation wa^ transacted without
our knowledge.
Jer. 29.11. I know the thoughts I think toward you, (you know them not; I
love you, but ye know not) even thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give
you an expected end. Many glorious mercies are transacted in Gods mind, without
our knowledge: Ere the corner stone of the earth was laid, he had made sure
work of our election to glory, Ephesians. 1.4. Romans 9.11. (2.) The everlasting
covenant between the Father that blessed bargain of free-redemption in Christ,
was closed from eternity, Jer. 32.39, 40. To do us good when we are
farre-off, and know no such thing, is a great and free expression of love. (3.)
We should be narrow vess^ls, not able to contain our joy, without breaking,
if we understood our life is hid with Christ in God, it appears not now what
we are. You never saw the Bride the Lambs Wife broydered with heaven,
free grace, and riches of glory. Every Saint is a mystery to another Saint, One
Saint a mystery to another.
and that is the cause that love to one another is so cold: Every Saint is a
riddle, and a secret to himself. It was a privileged sight, even a privilege
of the higher House, and of the Peers of Heaven, that John saw, Revel. 21.10.
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed
me the great City, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, Verse.
11. Having the glory of God: and the light was l^ke a stone most precious, even
like a Jaspar stone, clear as Crystal. Here is a Kings daughter, a
beautiful Princess, in the gold of heavens glory, arrayed with Christ; who
sees this while we are here? every one sees not such a sight of glory.

If there be such an active application on Gods part, Use 1.
that Christ is fitted and dressed for sinners, there should be a passive
application on our part: O what an incongruity and unsutablenesse between
Christ and us! he is a Savior for sinners, we are not sinners for a Savior:
he is open and forward to give, we narrow and drawing to receive. A Physician
that thrusts his art and compassion to cure, is unfitting for a sick one,
froward and unwilling to be cured. We should be for Christ, as for our only
perfecting end; but it is not so. Oh, men are for their own gain, from their
quarter, Esaias 56.10. Their eyes and hearts are not but for covetousness; Jer.
22.17. For the glory of their own name, Dan. 4.30. For the continuance of
their houses to many generations, Psalm. 49.11. For the flesh, to fulfill the
lusts thereof, Romans 13.14.

If Christ be for the Saints, then all other things are for them; Use 2.
all things are theirs: All things are for the Saints.
Death is a Water-man to carry them to the other side of time; the earth the
Saints Innes; the creatures their servants; as sun, moon, and stars, are
candles in the house for them: Providence for them, as the hedge of thorns, is
to fence the wheat, the flowers, the roses, not the thistles, and all because
Christ is their Savior. Verse 31. Now is the judgment of this world, now
shall the Prince of this world be cast out.

Two enemi^s are here judged, the World and Satan.

As touching the former enemy: We are to consider the time. What is the the
judged World.
Now; 2 the enemy, the World: 3 The restrictive Pronoune; This world: 4 That
which Christ acts, he judges the world. But what is meant by the judgment
of the world. Some understand, that now by Christ's death is the right
constitution of the world, as if the world were put in a right frame, and
delivered from vanity, and restored to its perfection by Jesus Christ's death.
Others think by the world, is meant the sin of the world, or the sinning
world; in that Christ condemned sin, in the flesh, by his death. But by the
World is meant the reprobate, and wicked world, that are here ranked with
Sa^an, for Christ in his death gives out a doom and sentence on the
unbeleeving World; because they receive not him; as John 3.19. This is the
((...)) judgment of the world) that light is come into the world, and men
loveh darkness, etc.

Now for the first of these: We see that Hope helps the weak; before Christ
yoke with devils, hell, and death, he sees and believes the victory: Hopes
goo^ prophesying in saddest times, and the sweet fruits thereof
It was now a dark, and a sad providence with Christ in his soule-trouble; but
hope lying on the cold clay, prophecieth good; Hope among the worms breathes
life and resurrection. Psalm. 16.10. Thou will not leave my soul in grave.
Verse. 11. Thou will show me the path of life. Psalm. 118.17. I shall not die,
but live; and declare the works of the Lord. He was at this time, in regard of
danger, almost in deaths cold bosom. Saw ye never Hope laugh out from under
dead bones in a bed? Boylie, rotten, and half dead, Job Chap. 19.^6. I know
that my Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the
earth: Verse. 26. And though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in
my flesh I shall see God. And 2 Cor. 5.1. Hope does both die, and at the same
time prophecy heaven and life: We know, if our earthly house of this
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with
hands, eternal in the heaven. Would any man say, Paul, how know ye that? the
Answer is; Faith holds the candle to Hope, and Hope sees the Sun in the
Firmament at midnight. We know if this house be destroyed, we have a better one.

2 Hope is one of the good Spies, that comes with good tidings, be not
dismayed, God will give us the good land; plucking the hair off Christ's face,
and nipping his cheeks, Hope speaks thus to him, and to all standers by, Esaias
50.7. For the Lord God will help me, therefore I shall not be confounded:
therefore have I set my face as flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
It is a long Cable, and a sure Anchor; Hebr. 6.19. Which Hope we have as an
Anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that which
is within the veil. Hope is Sea-proofe, and Hell-proofe, and Christ is
Anchor-fast in all storms: Christ in you the hope of glory, Col. 1.27.

3 A praying grace is such a prophesying grace; as both Father glorify thy
Name, and takes an answer: so does Christ here take an answer. Now is the
judgment of this world, now shall the prince of this world be cast out. He was
not yet cast out, but hope in Christ with one breath, prays, Father save me
from this hour; and answers, I shall be saved: the world, and the
prince-enemy shall be cast out. Its a wine-battel, all shall be well. Faith
and Hope laugh and triumph for to morrow, Psalm. 6. Rebuke me not, Lord, in
thine anger: Verse. 4. Return, O Lord, deliver my soul; Verse. 8. He takes an
answer, For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping: Verse. 9. The Lord has
heard my supplication. Psalm. 35. He prays that the Angel of the Lord would
chase his enemies. And he answers himself in Antedated praises, Verse 9. And
my soul shall be joyful in the Lord. Verse 10. All my bones shall say, Lord,
who is like unto thee, etc. He makes a bargain aforehand, Hope lays a debt
of praises upon every bone and joint of his body, Psalm 42. Banished,
forgotten, and whithered David, complains to God, and in hope takes an
Answer, Verse 8. Yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the day
time. We have need of this now. When Scotland is so low, Scotland though low,
is to hope in the Lord.
they cannot fall that are on the dust, and more thousands under the dust, with
the Pestilence, and the Sword, and the heartbreake of forsaking and cruel
friends, that not only have proved broken cisternes to us in our thirst, but
have rejoiced, as Edome did, at our fall, then ever Stories at one time, in
Ancient records can speak: and God grant friends turn not as cruel enemies,
as ever the Idolatrous and bloody Irish have been. Yet there is hope in Jsrael
concerning this thing. The Lord must arise, and pity the dust of Sion: Our
bones are scattered at the graves mouth, as when one heweth wood. Though we sit
in darkness, we shall see light. Some say, there is no help for them in God.
O say not so, they that are now highest, must be lowest. God must make the
truth of this appear in Britain, Ezech. 17.24. And all the trees of the field
shall know, that I the Lord, have brought down the high tree, and have exalted
the low tree, and have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to
flourish, I the Lord have spoken it, and have done it. Others say, we shall
be delivered, when we are ripened by humiliation for mercy. No, its not
needful it be ever so. God sometime first delivers, and then humbles, and
has done it; the Lord delivered his low Church, when they were in their
graves, Ezech. ^7. but they were never prouder, then when they loaded the
power, the faithfulness, and free grace of God with reproaches, and said,
Ezech. ^7.11. Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, we are cut off for our
parts.

This world. This is the lost World. 1. Because it is the judged World, John
3.19. (2.) It is that World of which Satan is Prince. The world being the
damned, is the worst of the creation; which I prove from the word, and withal
shall give the signs and characters of the men of the world.

1. The World is the black company that lies in sin, all Characters of the
world.
1 John 5.9. The whole world lies in sin; They are haters of Christ, and all
his. John 15.18. If the world hate you, ye know (says Christ) that it hated
me before you.

The world incapable of grace.
which is terrible, and have no part in Christ's prayers. Joh. 17.9. I pray not
for the world; nor of Sanctification; the Comforter that Christ was to send, is
Joh. 14.17. the Spirit that the world cannot receive.

Christ's contrary side that he overcommeth, and we in him. Joh. 16.33. In the
world you shall have tribulation. The world as enemy to Christ.
They are the only troublers of the Saints, But be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world. 1 John 5.4. Whosoever is borne of God overcomes the world.

4. Its a dirty and defiling thing, Pure religion (says James 1.27.) keeps a
man unspotted of the world. It is the praise of the Church of Sardis, The world
a (...),
Revel. 3.4. that there was amongst them a few names, that had not defiled
their garments; but kept themselves from the pollutions of the world; its a
sutty Pesthouse: there be drops of sutt that defiles men in it.

5. There can be no worse Character, then to be a child of It is a black mark,
Luke 16.8. A child of the world.
You know the Hebraisme; Children of disobedience: that is, much addicted to
disobedience; as the Son has the nature of Father and Mother in him:
Children of pride, of wrath; much addicted, and far under the power of wrath,
and pride: So the sparks of fire are called, Job 5. (...) the daughters of the
burning coal: then a child of the world, is one that lay in the womb of the
World, one of the worlds breeding, opposed to a Pilgrim and a stranger on
earth; for a stranger is one that is borne in a strange land, Psalm. 119.19.
Psalm. 39.12. Hebr. 11.13. and contrary to a child of light. Who has the
Pilgrims sigh, ordinarily night and day; The Pi^grimes sigh.
Oh if I were in my own Country. Wrong him not; his mother is a woman of
heaven, she is a mighty Princess, and a Kings daughter, Rev. 21.10. the New
Jerusalem, the Church of God came down from heaven; Father, Mother, Seed,
Principles, and all are from heaven. 2. There is a Spirit called the Spirit of
the world, 1 Cor. 2.12. This Spirit is the Genius, the nature, and disposition
of the World, 1 Ioh. 2.16. and is all for the lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life; and these be the Worlds, all things. Such a
soul knows not the white stone, and the new name, nor can he smell the rose
of the field, and the Lill^y of the valley; nor knows he the Kings banqueting
house, nor the absence, or presence of Christ in the soul; the man's portion is
in this world. Psalm. 17.14. within the four angles of this clay-globe.

This World. The World, the Lord Jesus judges, is this World; a thing that
comes within the compass of time, This world so differenced from that which
is to come.
and may be pointed with the finger.

1. It is near our senses, therefore called, Gal. 1.4. The present evil
world, the world that now is, on the stage: so 2 Timothy D^mas has forsaken me,
and has loved (...), the world that is upon its present Now. The World that is
on its Post, Why this World.
and Now, in its flux, motion and tendencie to corruption. 1 Timothy 6.17. Charge
them that are rich in THIS WORLD, that they be not high minded; this World is
opposed to eternity, and to life eternal, for the which the rich are to lay up
a sure foundation, Luke 20.34. The sons of THIS WORLD Marry, and are given
in Marriage* Verse. 35. But these that shall be counted worthy of that World and
the resurrection from the dead, neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage. Verse.
36. Neither can they do any more, (...), that world; this puts a great note of
excellency on the World to come.

2. This World is a thing that comes under our senses, and The world may be
pointed out with the finger; the world to come is above our senses.
Satan from the top of a mountain showed Christ, (...), All the kingdoms of
the World. and the glory, or opinion of them, Matthew. 4.8. and it is, Luke 4.5.
all the Kingdoms, (...), he showed him the phancie of the habitable earth in
a point of time; the life to come cannot come under your senses. Ye cannot
point out the throne of God, and the Lamb, and the Tree of life, and the pure
River of water of life, that proceeds out of the throne of God, and of the
Lamb, there be such various treasures of glory in the infinite Lord Jesus, so
many dwelling places in our Fathers house, that ye cannot number then all. The
Kingdoms of this world, and the glory of it comes within tale and reckoning; I
grant this is meant of the structure and dwellings of the World, but they are
the settled home of Reprobate men.

Use.
It were good, if we could believe that the (...) of the world, the figure and
paintrie of this house of lost men, 1 Cor. 7.30. is in a transe, and passing
away; ah! are ye conformed to the World? Your condition is woeful. The World
swears, and so do you, the World serves the time in Religion, and so do you;
the World is vain in their apparel; the World cousens, lies, whores, and so
do you; the world hates Christ, and his friends, and so do you; the World
lies in sin, it is the fashion of the World, and so do you. Oh! if you would
be conformed to the new World, in righteousness and holiness. 1. The
in-dwellers are all the children of a King, and Princes, and their mother a
Princes daughter. 2. The lowest piece of the dwelling house of that other
World, the heavens, we see are curious work; any one pearl, or candle of
Sun, or Moon, or Stars, is worth the whole Earth, setting aside the souls
of men. 3. The foundation of the City is precious Stones, Revel. 21. etc. What
fools are we, who kill every one another for pieces and bitts of the Lords
lowest footstool; for the earth, the seat of the worldly man, is but the
footstool of God.

The judgment of this World. How did Christ condemn and pass sentence on the
wicked world in his death?

1. He did it Legally, in that his offering of a sufficient Ransom How Christ
judged this world; and how many ways.
there is a seal put on the condemnation of all impenitent men, that they
shall not see life, but the wrath of God (that they were by nature under, being
the captives of the Law) abides on them, John 3.36. Because they believe not
in the Son of God, John 16.9. Christ's dying day was the unbeleevers Doomesday.

2. He condemns the World, Declaratorily; in removing the curse from all the
persecutions of the ill world; overcomming of the world, John 14.33. He has
removed all offense from the enemitie, and deadly fewd that the World bears
against the Saints. Christ's good will in dying, has sanctified, sweetened, and
perfumed the Worlds ill will to the Saints.

3. He judges the World in his death exemplarily; as its Hebr. 11.7. Christ's
dying exemplarily condemns the world.
Noah condemned the world in preparing an Arc. So Christ's example of obedience
in dying for the world, at his Fathers command John 10.16. condemns the Worlds
disobedience. Christ dying, and in his thirst, not Master of a cup of water, is
a judgment of the drunkard; his dying, being stripped of his garments, is a
condemning of vain and strange apparel; his face spitted on, says beauty is
vanity; his dying b^tweene two thieves says, a high place among Princes is not
much, when the Prince of the Kings of the earth was marrowed with thieves; his
being forsaken of lovers and friends, condemns trusting in men, and
confidence in Princes, or the Sonn^s of men: all this is for our mortification,
that we love not the World, for its Christ's condemned malefactor.

Now is the Prince of this world cast out. Here two things are considerable. 1.
Who is the Prince of this world. 2. How he is, by Christ cast out.

The Prince of this World is Satan, so called, John 14.30. And the Prince that
rules in the Children of disobedience, Ephesians. 2.2. called with a higher name, 2
Cor. 4.4. (...). The God of this world. What Princedome, or what Godhead can
the Devil have in the world? or who gave to him a Scepter, a Crown, and a
Throne? For Satan has a Throne, Revel. 2.3.

Devil is not 1. a free Prince. 2. Not an absolute Monarch. S^t^an not 1. a
^ree, not 2 a^ abs^lu^e, ^ot 3. a ju^t Prince.
3. Nor a lawful King; not free, because he is a captive Prince, reserved in
everlasting chains of darkness, unto the judgment of the great day, Jude 6.
The Son of God is the only free prince in the world, there be none
independently free in heaven and earth, but he, John 8.36. The kingdom of
grace is an ancient free estate; and never was, never can be conquered, not by
the gates of hell, Mat. 16.18. Zach. 12.3. and in that day will I make
Jerusalem a burdensome stone, though all people of the earth be gathered
together against it. Sure, Christ is a free king, by all the reason, and
lawful authority in heaven and earth, Psalm. 2.6, 7. Hell is no free
princedome, all in it are slaves of sin, John 8.34, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44.
The liberty of loving, enjoying, seeing, and praising God, and leisure, or
thoughts, or cares to do no other thing, is the only true liberty, and
liberty to be a King, and absolute over lusts, and wicked will is the only
liberty, Psalm. 119.45. I shall walk (...) in latitude, in breath, in liberty;
for I seek thy precepts. (2.) He is not an absolute Prince. 1. He is under
Satan's providence, in power, is narrower then his will and malice; otherwise
he had not left a Church on earth. 2. He can do nothing without leave asked
and given, against Job; nor could he winnow Peter, till he petitioned for it.
(3.) He is not a Monarch, but usurpeth; and therefore is called the god of
this world, 2 Cor. 4.4. not that he has any Godhead, properly so called.

1. Its true, a black Monarch wears Christ's fair Crown, Levit. 17. He that
kills ox, or goat, or lamb to the Lord, in the camp, and brings it not to
the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, unto the Priest, Verse. 7.
Offers sacrifice to devils. 2 Chronicles. 11.15. Jeroboam ordained him Priests
for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves that he had made.

2. To fear the Devil, the Sorcerer, or him that can kill the Satan may bear
the keys of prison houses, How Satan is a God.
and the sword, Revel. 2.10.) more then the Lord, is to put a Godhead on the
Devil.

3. Satan usurpeth a Godhead, over that which is the flower and most God-like
and divine piece in man, the mind. Satan has a God head over minds.
2 Cor. 4.4. In whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of them that
believe not: and he makes a workhouse of the souls of the children of
disobedience, Ephesians. 2.2. they are the Devill's forge and shop, in whom he
frames curious pieces for himself.

4. His crown stands in relations: Fathers, Tyrants by strong hand, and Lords
by free-election were Kings, of old; Satan's crown stands by relations.
Devil is a father, has children, and a seed, Act. 13.10. 1 John 3.10. the
world is his conquest, and his vassalls, Acts 10.38. 2 Timothy 2.26. 1 Pet. 4 3.
and 5.8. are the world which he governes and rules, by the three fundamental
principles of his Catholic Kingdom, which he has holden these 5000. years,
The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, 1 John 2.16.
Sinners hold the crown on the Devill's head; their loyalty to Prince Satan
acts on them to die in wars against the Lamb and his followers.

A cause is not good, because followed by many. Use.
Esaias 17.7. in that day, when the Church is but three or four berries on the
top of the olive tree, a man, one single man, shall look to his Maker. Few in
the way to heaven.
Men come to Sion, and follow Christ in ones and twoes of a whole Tribe, Jer.
3.14. They go to hell in thousands; a whole earth, Revel. 13. worships the
Western Beast; and the Eastern Leopard has the far greatest part of the
habitable world; Indians and Americans worship Satan. Christ's are but a little
flock; ah the way to heaven is overgrown with grass, there the traces of few
feet to be seen in the way: only you may see the print of our glorious
Forerunner Christ's foot, and of the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, and the
handful that follow the Lamb. Follow ye on, and miss not your lodging.

Shall be cast out. Satan twice judged.
There is a twofold casting out of Satan; one for his first sin, 2 Pet. 2.4.
God spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, Jude verse.
6. This is a personal casting out, not spoken of here: But Satan must have two
hells; for though the Gospel was never intended to Satan, yet Satan is guilty
of Gospel-rebellion, in that the Dragon fights with the Lamb, and the weak
woman traveling in birth, by the Gospel, to bring forth a man child to God.
And (2.) as Satan is the mystical head and Prince of that condemned body, he
is cast out; and he has a power, in regard of the guilt and dominion of sin,
both over the elect and the reprobate. Christ's death has broken hells bars,
and condemned sin in the flesh, Romans 8.3. and dissolved the works of the
devil, and taken his Forts and Castles; and, 1 John 3.8. taken many of Satan's
Soldiers captives. Death was the Devils Fort-royall; Death the devils
Fort-royall.
Hell is his great Prisonhouse, and principal Jayle; these he has taken, 1
Cor. 15.55, 56. Hos. 13.14. I will ransom them from the power of the grave, I
will redeem them from the power of death. O death, I will be thy plague: O
grave, I will be thy destruction. And these captives can never be ransomed out
of Christ's hand again; for (says he) repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
When Christ spoils, All the devils Forts taken from him, and his Courts cried
down, and his Laws annulled by Jesus Christ.
he will never restore the prey again. He has overcome the world, Joh.
16.33. and that was a strong Fort: and he has delivered the Saints from the
dominion of sin, because they are under a new Husband; Romans 6.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Romans 7.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. All crosses have lost their salt and their sting; even
as when a City is taken by storming, all the Commanders and Soldiers are
dis-armed: and when a Court is cried down, by Law, all the members and Officers
of the Court, Judge, and Scribe, and Advocates that can plead, Pursevants,
Jayles, are cried down; they cannot sit, nor lead a Process, nor summon a
Subject: So when Christ cried down Satan's Judicature, and triumphed over
principalities and powers, and annulled all Decrees, Laws, hand-writings of
Ordinances, that Satan could have against the Saints, Col. 2.14, 15. all the
Officers of hell are laid aside; the Devil is out of office by Law, jure, the
Jayles and pits are broken, Esaias 49.9. That thou may say to the prisoners,
Go forth: to them that are in darkness, Show your selves. Zech. 9.11. When a
righteous King comes to the crown, he puts down all unjust Usurpers.

If Satan be cast out, we are not debtors to the flesh, to fulfill the lusts
thereof, Romans 8.12. Sin has no law over us. Use.
There is a law of sin, a dictate of mad reason, by which the sinner thinks
he is under the Oath of Allegiance to Satan, and his crown, scepter, and
honor he must defend; but there is no reason, no law in hell, and in the
works of hell. Take not in a dislodged Spirit, lest you have eight for one.
And if he be once cast out, who is this usurping lawless lord, if you sweep
the house to him, and take him in again to a new lodging, one devil will be
eight devils; for Satan, thus cast out, will return with seven devils worse
then himself: Remember Lot's wife, if ye be escaped out of Sodom. Look not
over your shoulder with a wanton and lustful eye to old forsaken lovers, let
repentance and mortification be constant.

Now is the Prince of this world cast out. But yet to consider more
particularly, Satan's Princedome, and Satan's Power: I add yet more of these two
heads, 1. The Power of Satan. Satan's power and punishment.
2. The Punishment of Satan.


His Power is held forth, in that he is a Prince.

1. In his might and power natural. 2. In his power acquired. 3. In his power
sinful, and judicially inflicted.
The Devil's Power, he was created in, both in the mind, and will, and
executive faculty, by no Scripture or Reason can be imagined to be less,
before the fall of these miserable Spirits, then the power of their
fellow-Angels.

1. The Angels being all created holy, and according to Gods image, The ill
Angels created good, as the elect A^gels.
they must have been created with their face to God, and in their proper place
and sphere; and so with power to stand in their place. Now, what station can
these immortal Spirits be created in, rather then in a state of seeing God? 2.
Satan abode not in the truth, (says the Lord Jesus, Joh. 8.44) and the bad
Angels left, (says Jude verse. 6.) (...), their proper dwelling. These two
places compared together, seems to hold forth that truth, Ill angels saw God
before their fall, as did the elect.
and the first truth; God seen and known, though not immutably, was the first
element, native country of the Angels: They must then see God and his face.

It is a bold and groundless conjecture of some rotten Schoolmen, to say, That
truth from which the Angels are said to fall, was the Gospel Truth; and that,
They envied that man was in Christ, to be advanced above the Angelike nature.

The ill Angels before their fall knew nothing of the incarnation of Christ.
1. Its a dream, that the Gospel was revealed to the Devils before their fall;
for then their own fall and future misery, that they were to be kept eternally
in chains of darkness, on the same ground, must be revealed to them. What
horror and sadness must fill Adams mind, and the Angels spirit, if hell and
the necessity of God manifested in the flesh, was revealed to them in the state
of happiness? 2. The mystery of the riches of the glorious Gospel was hid,
from the beginning of the world; and the glorious elect Angels come in time,
Ephesians. 3.8, 9, 10. to learn that manifold wisdom of God; and delight, in
Peter's time, to look into it, as to a great secret of God, 1 Pet. 1.12. We
have not then reason to think this secret was whispered in the ears of the
Devils, before they fell.

2. Its true, Mat. 18. The elect Angels, (...), always now behold the face of
Christ's Father; for now they are confirmed, that they cannot look awry, and
turn their eyes off Gods face; even when they come down as servants, to the
heirs of glory on earth, they carry about with them their heaven, and the
pleasures of the Court they enjoy; no reason their posting among sinners should
decourt them, or deprive them of the actual vision of God: But it follows
not therefore, the fallen Angels never saw the face of Christ's Father; it
follows only, they saw it not immutably, and in a confirmed way of grace, and
(...), always, as now the elect Angels do.

^. Its no Princedome in Satan to know the thoughts of the heart; this is
proper to God only, 1 King. 8.39. Jer. 17.10. Psalm. 44.21. Nor has he, or
the good Angels, Satan knows not the thoughts of the heart.
any immediate Princedome over the will, to know what are my thoughts, or to
know one another thoughts, or to act immediately upon free will: not because
the thoughts of the heart are objects of themselves so abstruse and high, that
they are not intelligible; for a man's own spirit knows the things in
himself, 1 Cor. 2.11. Yea, (2.) then they could not be known by revelation;
for God cannot, by revelation, cause a finite understanding comprehend an
infinite object; because the object exceeds the faculty in proportion
infinitely. The thoughts of a man's heart, cannot so exceed the understanding
faculty of a man, far less of an Angel: Therefore God, in the depth of his
wisdom, by an act of his own free will, not from any mystinesse or
intrinsecall darkness of the object, has cast a covering over the thoughts of
man's heart, that they are not seen clearly to any other Men or Angels. Nor
could humane Societies, now in the state of sin, subsist, if but the father
could read the heart of the son.

Nor have Angels, good or bad, Satan has no immediate power over free will;
nor tempts he to a^l sins that are committed in the in-most Court of the
heart.
any immediate Princedome over free will: nor would I say, Satan is the Author,
yea, or the immediate Tempter to all sins: many sinful thoughts, and wicked
acts, are transacted in this dark chamber of presence, the heart of man, to
which Satan can have no personal access, neither with his eyes to see, nor
his hands of power to stir or move in them. The heart is the privy garden,
weeds grow there without Satan's immediate industry: he may knock, or cast
fireballs over the wall, or in at the windows, or send letters and messages
in, but he cannot immediately talk with the heart, or act immediately on the
will: we are to keep this virgin-love of the heart, to Christ; he can ravish
it, and none but he. Its the will that makes the bargain in sinning: With
all keeping keep the heart. We make away the created dominion over free will,
that God gave us in our creation.

3. Satan has a Princedome in 1. knowledge natural, 2. in acquired knowledge.
In natural; Satan's knowledge natural, and acquired.
because he is a piece of light, a lamp once shining in heaven; but now, for
his sin, smoking and glympsing in hell. The natural intellectualls of the
Devil are depraved, not removed. Its a question, if he can remain a Spirit,
if that candle were extinct, by which he believes there is a God, but
trembles, Jam. 2. The acquired knowledge of the Devil is great, he being an
advancing Student, and still learning now above five thousand years; and he
that teaches others, becomes more learned himself: He is the great
Mint-master and Coyner of knowledge, in Magicians, Wisemen, Soothsayers,
Sorcerers, is a careful Reader in turning over the pages of the book of
Nature, and the whole works of Creation. But still Satan studieth man, better
then man does himself: he knows nature, in general, may sin; and that
corrupt nature, must sin: he observes second inclinations, of humor,
complexion, temper of body, disposition, ere he tempt; as no Seaman sails,
till he know how the wind blows: and he learned that by the Prophets, and
experience, which he says, Luke 4.34. I know thee who thou art, the holy one
of God.

Satan has a l^gall power over man.
4. He has a particular Princedome of Power, legally, over mankind, till
Christ set them at liberty; as the Executioner has over the condemned man,
from the Judge. Heb. 2.14. Christ took part with the children of flesh and
blood, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death,
that is, the devil; Verse. 15. And deliver them, who, through the fear of
death, were all their life time subject to bondage. Satan, from men's sins, has
a sort of conquered Princedome, till the Son of God make us free, Joh. 8.36.
And this Princedome he keeps over all the sons of disobedience, as their
father, Joh. 8.44. as the king of the bottomless pit: And we have no ground to
say, Its not certain by Scripture that Beelzebub loses the Princedome over his
fellow-Angels at the last judgment
that Satan at the day of judgment leaves off to be king, because the damned
and the Devil and his Angels are said to be tormented together in everlasting
fire, Mat. 25. for communion in pain, makes not Satan to have no Angels under
him, or damned men, whom he torments.

Quest. But how keeps Satan still power over Job, Peter, to winnow them and
afflict them, in this life, if Christ have cast him out of his Princedome? How
Satan keeps still, and exercises his power of tempting, though he has lost
his Princedom, by Christ's death.


Answ. 1. Its mere service for the trying of the Saints, and mortifying of
their lusts, not dominion, not any legal power, such as he has over the
Sons of disobedience, whom he keeps captives at his will.

2. In relation to Satan it is a mere grant of permission; as a Nobleman
forfeited for treason, and kept, some years, in prison, before he dye, has
the life-rent of his own Lands, for his necessity, not by heritage as before,
but by a grant or gift of grace, from the bounty of the Prince and State; so
has Satan, not by grace to himself, but by a grant of mere permission, as
it were his life-rent to tempt, winnow, and try the Saints, so long as Satan is
in the way to his full doom in Hell. Now, if Christ had not spoiled Satan, and
dissolved his works; the use of this power had been, as it were, heritage, to
Satan, in regard the Law gives him a sort of right over sinners, not made free
in Christ. Yet I do not say, its his proper right, because Satan sins in
tempting any to sin; yet the temptation, as it falls passively on the
Sons of disobedience, is a work of Divine justice, and as it falls on the
Saints, an act of spotless, and holy dispensation, for most just reasons known
to God.

2. Satan is a prince in regard of magnificence, called a Prince, a Prince of
the air, a God, Satan a prince for his power over other.
for he has a royal army under him, the Devil and his Angels, are a great
host, Revel. 12.9. The Devil, and Satan, and his Angels, were cast out. Verse.
7. The Dragon and his Angels fought with Michael; and he has Legions garisoned
in one poor man, he has kept the fields above these five thousand years,
with a huge and mighty army, both by Sea, and Land. Ephesians. 6.12. For we
wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against Principalities, and powers,
against the rulers in the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places. Here be great persons in eminent places, and they
can lead armies against us, and have in every single soldier, a strong
garrison of concupiscence, and fleshly lusts, that war against the soul, 1
Pet. 2.11. And the flesh is a strong Fort-royall, a tower of imaginations,
which exalt themselves against a strong King, the Lord Jesus, and cannot be
his captives, Satan an en^mie not to be d^spised for his lowness.
but by the mighty power of God. 2 Cor. 10 5. The Devil is not a despic^ble
and poor enemy to be despised, it is not good warre-wisdome to despise a mean
enemy, far more should we not sleep, but watch and be sober; When the Peer^s
of hell, What it is to tempt, and how Satan's power is put forth in tempting.
and Princes and Rulers in high places, who have the vantage of the Mount above
us, are against us.

3. Satan's Princedome is especially seen in tempting to sin, which that it
may be better cleared. I shall shortly show what a temptation in general is.
2. Open Satan's power in tempting. To tempt is to take a trial of any, to try
what is in them; G^l. Pa^isiens t^act (...) Cha^twright Cat^^h. c. 4^.
therefore the nearest end of tempting is knowledge; Now the ways or manner of
bringing out this knowledge, renders the temptation good or ill: for God
tempts, and Satan tempts. So Temptation is a working upon the senses,
reason, inclin^tion, affections, by which any is, or may be moved under the
color of good, toward that which is offensive to God.

Satan can not fire the will, against our will.
1. Temptation is a working, or an act of stirring in the tempte^, not
Physical, but Moral, and Objectiv^; no tempter, who is only a tempter, can by
any real action fire the will. Satan does but knock, by his Logic, at the
outside of the door, but cannot open. Free Will is a tender, excellent, piece
of creation; and either the best or the worst of the whole creation of God. See
well to it, its a work of your whole life time to watch this door.

Every tempted cre^ture is a sufferer.
2. Tentation is an act of moving, or stirring the powers of the man: As when
wine is stirred, and wine and dreggs are jumbled through other; or a Fountain
troubled, and water and clay mixed in one; hence every tempted person is some
way a sufferer, (...), Perforo tento.
though he know not particularly it is so. As the Fish tempted with the ba^te,
the Bird with the Fowlers song, are sufferers, though they know not; there is a
breaking in upon the phancie, sense, reason, will, and affections to strike a
hole in the soul; So tempting is called piercing, though the fool going to
the chambers of death, knows not that it is for his life, Prove. 7.23. To be
tempted is a matter of great concernment; Its good to know when we are tempted,
and what God and Satan aim at.
illumination is most necessary here, and specially to know that God aymeth at
the trial of our Faith, and other glorious ends. And that 1. Satan seeks some
of his own work in us, as God seeks to bring out some of his work in us.
2. That Satan aims to go between the believer and his strong hold. 3. That
he aymeth at house-roome in the soul.

3. The temptation works upon both, the inward and outward man; on senses,
fancy, mind, inclination, will, and affection, but has a special design at
the soul.

4. By the temptation any is, or may be moved to sin; for all tempted, are
not actually induced to sin. Christ was really tempted of the Devil, but was
never induced to sin. Satan shot his arrows at Job for nothing; he lost his
labor in seeking the failing, and drinking up of Peter's faith. Therefore to be
tempted of the Devil, or the World, is not a sin.

5. The temptation works under the color of good. The first Printing iron
and Master samplar of tempting, Every temptation comes under the va^^ of good.
has this Character of apparent good. Genesis 3.6. The Woman saw that the fruit
was good. 1. Because tempted persons are reasonable creatures, and as instinct
takes with birds, and beasts, and poor nature swayeth elements in their
motion, so reason is a strong tying chain.

2. Every temptation has a garment, or rather a shirt of truth in the
understanding, and coming under the shadow and rooffe of the desiring
faculty as good, nothing hinders it to take, but a marring of the
understanding, in apprehending some black spot, in the fairness of it; When
Satan sayleth fair with favor of the wind, and comes in his Whites, and in
cloth of Gold, as an Angel of light, we are as readily moved often (such is
our childishness) with good-like as with good. Things are ^ligibl^, rat^er
because lawful and honest* then because good and pleasant.
Believe not therefore a white Devil, because white. O beware to yield your
tongue to lick a honey-temptation, under the veil of sweetness. Receive
things rather because lawful, then because good or pleasant. 2. Believe it,
there can be no reason for sin, no reason can wash the Devil to render him
fair; neither thirst, nor company, can be a reason of drunkenness. An injury
cannot justify every War and bloodshed; because injury is a sin, and to
wash one sin with another, is as if you should wash a foul face with
Inke-water. 3. Believe sin to be folly and darkness, and light of reason can
be neither father nor mother to folly and darkness: holiness is white and
fair, within and without.

6. The object of the temptation, in the definition; the terminus ad qu^m, How
temptations te^d to sin.
is that which is offensive to the majesty of God. That we may understand this,
remember four are said to tempt. 1. God, his tempting neither in the condition
of the work, or intention of the worker is sin, But the Lord proves you
(says Moses to Israel) that he might know, whether ye love the Lord your God.
2. Our own lusts tempt and lead aside. Jam. 1.14. And as fire cannot but make
fire; so both in the intention of the work, and the worker, the end of
temptation is sin. Concupiscence is a mother that cannot bring forth a good
daughter. 3. If men tempt to sin, as a Magistrate by good Laws tempts
wicked men, the end is not necessarily sin in the intention of the doer;
though no man can formally tempt another to sin, but he sins and tempts
to sin both ways. And when Satan tempts, he drives ever at sin; both
ways we are to fear God, to watch, to stand out, when he tempts

2. Now we are to consider, that though Satan be sentenced already, and as a
Malefactor under bail, and in chains, yet has he leave to walk too and fro
in the earth, and is not yet cast in prison, nor are we freed from his
temptation, the personal persecution and malice of Satan; as we are from the
persecution of the damned now in hell, who did persecute us here on earth, but
cannot now. No doubt but as the good Angels, Satan's power on the outward man.
struck the men of Sodom with blindness, so the ill Angels have the like
power on the senses, a man possessed with the Devil, was both dumb and deaf,
Job 2.7. Satan smote Job with sore boiles, from the sole of his foot unto his
crown; and so Devils have power over the senses, and bodily organes; and so of
necessity over the blood, to cause rottenness in it, which must be in boyles,
and to alter and infect the humors. Psalm. 78.49. Evil Angels were ministers of
the Lords plagues on the Egyptians. Its no good argument, we can d^e and all
this on our selves, therefore Satan can do it.
But I shall not think it a good Argument, to prove, that Angels can jumble
the humors, to make many things appear without that they are not; and that
they can work on the internal senses, the fancy and imagination, because we
our selves, by an act of free will, can stir up the memory of things, and
provoke our fancies to the apprehension of things. Ergo, Angels either good, or
evil, can do the like. This is but a sorry poor reason, for we our selves
can do many things within our selves, which the Angels cannot do; I know the
thoughts of my own heart, when they come forth in act, 1 Cor. 2.11. No Angels
good or ill can know them; I can with an obedientiall act of free will, by
grace, set my free will on acts to command my memory, fancy, imagination,
thoughts, to meditate on by-passed experiences of Divine favors, and sweetly
solace my self in God, with these thoughts; no Angels in heaven or hell, can
determine my free will to those Spiritual acts; yet, by the grace of God, I
can do it. Nor is that true, what ever an inferior power can do, that a
superior can much more do; if there be orders in Angels, a superior Angel
cannot determine the will of an inferior, as he himself can do. Sure my
knowledge and will are inferior powers, in comparison of Angels, 1 Cor. 13.1.
We have a greater power over our own u^d^^standi^g and will, then ^i^her good
or bad Angels can have.
Yet have I greater dominion over my own understanding and will, then the
Angels have over my understanding and will, and can know my own actual
thoughts, and determine mine own will, by grace, which no superior powers of
Angels, or any else, save the Almighty, can do.

I rather conceive that the outward and inward senses, humors, imagination,
fancy, memory, b^ing natural agents; and Scripture clearly showing, that
Angels and Devils can, and do work upon natural agents, Devils have power
over our naturals, ^^t our morals.
have a power over all our dispositions, temperature, senses, fancy,
imagination, memory; therefore what is natural in the acts of understanding
and memory, not moral, Angels do, and may know. What heart-secrets Devils
know from the disposition of body, palenesse, redness, trembling, dejected
countenance, are good conjectures; and surer it may be then we can apprehend,
but no certain knowledge.

God only knows all the thoughts of man, and his secrets, 1 King. 8.39. God
only knows the ^eart and thoughts, and acts thereof, considerable g^ounds
thereof.
For thou (even) thou only know the hearts of all the children of men,
Prove. 15.11. H^ll and destruction are before the Lord, how much more then the
hearts of the children of men. He that can read hell, and destruction, and all
the secrets of darkness, can also read, as a book opened at noonday, the
midnight-thoughts of all the children of men. Psalm. 44.21. Jerem. 17. Romans
8.27. 1 Thessalonians. 2.4. Rev. 2.23. Acts 1.24. Prove. 17.3. Prove. 21.2. Joh. 2.24*
25. Yea to know the present thoughts is prop^r to God, Matthew. 19.^. And Jesus
knowing their thoughts, said, wherefore think ye evil in your heart. Nor can
Angels see the present thoughts come out in action; for otherwise the man
himself knows his own thoughts, when he actually thinks them, 1 Cor.
2.11. else he could not be convinced of the sinnefuln^sse of them, nor comforted
in the spiritualnesse and preciousnesse of them.

Its a fond opinion of some, who say, Angels can see the thoughts of the heart,
when they are, but not what they are, whether they he good or bad, love or
hatred; for that is nonsense, to see Moral acts, and not be able to pass any
judgment on them: or that Angels see our thoughts, but not whether they be
intense, and vehement; or cold, and remiss; for its proper to God, as the
searcher of hearts, to know the secrets of the heart, and all the qualities of
it, that he may accordingly judge them. And if Angels see them as Moral acts,
they must know the vehemency, or slownesse of them, the Scripture places also
the difficulty of knowing the thoughts, and the distance, and remoteness of
them, from the understanding of men, or Angels in the thoughts themselves, not
in the vehemency or slownesse of the thoughts; and its but an evasion that
some have, that Angels may know the thoughts, and acts of the will in
themselves, but not know to what end they are directed, and that the intention
of the mind is the great secret that God has reserved to himself; because 1.
The Scripture places the secrecy of the free acts of will and understanding
in the acts themselves, and not in the intention; for so most of the actions of
Men and Angels, their speaking this, not that; their walking to this City,
their eating, sleeping, now, not another time, their praying, hearing, reading,
shall be secrets, known to God only, not to Angels, or Men, just as the acts
of understanding, the will, are, because the particular intention, whether we
do these sincerely, for a good or bad end; yea, often for what end we do
them, is amongst the secrets of the heart as far distant from the
understanding of Men or Angels, as any secret can be. 2. The intention of all
our elicite acts that issues from w^ll and understanding, are also acts of the
heart and reins, that fall under the present question, and the greatest
secrets in man, The true reason why God only knows the heart, the reason of
Suarez refused. Suarez tom. de D^o and Angel^s, lib 2* de potentia inte^lecti^a
Angelo^um natura. c^p. 23. n 17.
Hebr. 4.12.

Neither see I any reason, from the disproportion between the knowing faculty
and the understanding of Angels; why Angels may not know the thoughts of my
heart, as well as I may know them my self; nor can the reason be, as Suarez
says, Because Angels, though they have sufficient power in the facu^ty of
understanding to know these things; yet have not in their understanding the
species, the babies, images, and representations of heart-secrets, but with his
good leave; this is Petitio principij. For the question is, how comes it to
pass, that Angels, who have the species of higher and more profound things, as
of the natural knowledge, that there is a God, that he is infinite, eternal,
yet have not the species of an object, far inferior, and yet intelligible,
to wit, of the heart-actions of a man. 2. When I ask how comes it, that an
Angel, or a Man, knows not this; I ask indeed, how comes it to pass, that
an Angel, or a Man, wants such a species of such a thing, so Suarez says in
effect, Angels know not heart-secrets, because they know not heart-secrets. I
conceive God has laid a covering over the hearts of Men and Angels, from his
own free and wise will, and reserved that secret to himself: For God gave
speech to men, and a way how Angels should communicate their thoughts to
Angels, and Men, which is Angel-speaking; and this gift had bin useless, if
Angels and Men could intuitively read and behold the thoughts of one another
hearts, nor is it useful for the end of reasonable nature, for love and
society that we know the secrets of one another hearts, for the author of
nature gives not that by nature, which with less impeachment of love, and not
without danger of contention and hatred, may by industry be acquired. And we
should take heed, what is written in the book of our heart, when such a
searching eye reads it, as God; and will one day read out to the hearing of
Men and Angels, all these secrets, Eccles. 12.14. except we be pardoned in
Christ, many state-secrets, many foul contrivances may come out, to our
everlasting shame.

And for this cause, we are to bless the Lord, who has reserved from Satan's
Princedome, and left out of his charter any power to compel our will. Its
true, Satan has a bordering or (as it were) some out-land Prince-dome over
Saul's will, in that he can sit and ride on his melancholy; Satan has no power
over our ^ill* but wh^t leaves guiltiness on us.
so as he is moved to throw a Javeling at Jonathan, and to seek to kill David;
yet so as he, that is so acted by an evil Spirit, is blameworthy; and then it
must be presumed, he has some dominion over his will. Acts 5.2. Peter says to
Ananias, why has Satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy Ghost? Here the
Holy Ghost arraigneth not Satan, but Ananias for a lie, which yet came from the
Father of lies. Which is, 1. Because there was fuel and powder in the harth
before, and Satan did but blow the bellows, and brought forth the flame. 2.
Because we willingly join, and love to have it so. 3. Because the act of
sinning, comes formally from free will, which cannot be forced, but may keep
out the siedge without violence, but yet basely renders.

If Satan be the Prince of the air, and can raise mighty storms and winds,
Satan's power over the creatures.
that can smite the four corners of an house, which is not like an ordinary
wind, that blows from East, or West, or North, or South, but rather right
down, Job 1.19. If he have power of floods, and seas, and be a roaring Lion,
and, by reason of his sagacity and skill in the secrets of nature, can do
wonders, though no miracles, as to raise the dead, by applying actives and
passives together; no question, the Lord letting loose some links of the chain
he is fettered withal, he can work curiously and strongly on the walls of
bodily organs, on the shop that the understanding soul lodges in, and on the
necessary tools, organs, and powers, of fancy, imagination, memory, humors,
senses, spirits, blood, so nearely joined with the soul, as will,
understanding, conscience, and affections sit in dangerous neighboured, with
such malignant Spirits.

It is (no question) hard enough to give an exact delineation of the length and
breadth of the borders of the Princedome of Satan; nor is it necessary, for our
edification, to know all the secrets and mysteries of the Devils Power, how he
assumeth a body, what he can do in the sphere of nature, how he acts upon
men: Sure, he has some in his snare, as poor birds, who are taken captives
by him, at his will, 2 Timothy 2.26. and that he sits at the helm, as it
were, of some, and acts and stirs them so, the wind and tide of their lusts
complying with him, that they cannot choose but sail, and walk according to the
course of this world, according to the Prince of the power of the air, the
Spirit that now works in the children of disobedience, Ephesians. 2.2. And that
he can borrow tide and fair wind at his nod, and woe the soul by the shop
and office-house, the body, the flesh, the senses; and reciprocally, act,
indirectly, by foreign Embassies and missive Letters, on the will and
understanding, and the lusts, that are domestic friends within, to draw in the
senses, and the fancies and imagination, to join with him; as is clear in his
first dealing with Evah. It is not his way to deal with the senses only, or
with reason only, or to keep such a method, as peremptorily to begin at one
before another; but in Satan's first temptation of Evah, he acts collaterally
and reciprocally; he acts on the ear, by speaking; and on the mind, by
speaking reason; Has God said ye shall not eat of every tree? Does he so
strictly tie you? Satan acts at one time on sense and on reason.
Is that reason and justice, to put a Law on an Apple? Then you may not eat of
every tree, which God has made for eating. And Satan works on the sense by
reason, Genesis 3.5. For God does know, that in the day ye eat, then your eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil. And this
wrought upon the sense; for its added, Verse. 6. And the woman saw that the tree
was good for food. And again, by the sense of seeing, Satan wrought on the
will, to bring out the consent; Verse. 6. And when the woman saw that the tree
was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat. Sa^an
works on the soul thro^gh the body, and on the body thro^gh the soul.
So Satan can make the body a tempter to the soul, and the soul and reason a
tempter to the body: As when the husband is leprous, and the wife infected with
the pestilence, he rendereth her a leper, and she rendereth him sick with a
running botch. When the body is pampered, and the vessels full, it draws the
souls consent to fleshly lust; and the soul finds reason, but corrupt
reason, why the body should be a member of an harlot. And there is mutual help
between concupiscence and conscience; the one tempting with strong acts of
lusting, the other tempting with lustful reason, showing it should be so, and
may be so: As in a wa^er-work, drawing water from such a place, twenty empty
buckets come down, and twenty full buckets come up, and every one serves
another, for one common work. Nor is it a wond^r, that one Devil does kiss
and embrace another*

Cast out. The Prince of this world's casting out, leads us to a further
consideration of Satan's punishment: A double sin, and a double punishment of
Satan.
As there is a double sin in Satan, so a double punishing and casting out. The
ill Angels first sin I determine not; They abode not in the truth: They kept
not their first and proper station. God made all things good, and placed them
all in due and fit houses and stations, and God was the station and house of
the Angels; the Devils first I (...) God, and left their own house; its like
they would have been high^r, and aff^cted a Godhead: They would not sit,
contentedly, in the place God set them in. Shifting Spirits, Climbing menlike
the devil.
climbing men, that would be higher then God has placed them, and would be
without their own skin, and above their own element and proper sphere, have
this, as a grain of the ill seed, that the old Serpent spewed in Evah. The
Devil knew how to go out of his own house, and to climb above his own
proper station, and he would lead Evah up the stairs, whither he did climb
himself, to seek to be like God, knowing good and evil, Genesis 3.5. The whole
Creation was like a well-ordered Army, at the beginning, all kept rank, and
martched in order; the Devils were the first Soldiers in the Army that spilt
the comely rank, Satan first mar^ed the com^ly order of creation.
and marred the first order: the Prince of darkness, that great Lord of
confusion, made the first jarring, and Sampler and prime discord in the sweet
music and song of the praises of the Creator, that all creatures did sing:
Therefore God the Creator, in his justice, spared not him, and his
fellow-mutiners, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them unto chains of
darkness, to be reserved unto judgment, 2 Pet. 2.4. Christ, as Med^ator, did
not inflict this punishment on the fallen Angels.

Now, there is a second sin of the Devils, and that is not only the casting
down of man, Satan^ second sin, and how he is yet in acting his first sin.
but the continuing without retreiting in the first sin. 1 John 3.8. He that
commits sin is of the devil: for the devil sins from the beginning.
Joh. 8.44. Satan was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth; because there is no truth in him. What, is not Satan's first sin a
transient act gone and past? Is Satan this day in the very act of murdering
all mankind, and of murdering Adam and Evah, who many thousand years ago are
dead? Its true, the act physically considered, is gone; but morally, Satan is
yet on that same sin. 1. Because he did, and does spin out, in a long thread,
the very first sin; and all Satan's life, from that day to this, is one
continuated act of apostasy: In 1. the not retreiting, nor repenting his first
sin, and his first murder; Satan's hands are wet and hot this very day with the
blood of Adam and Evahs soul. 2. In the continuing in, and the approving of
the act of his first sinning, by still envying the glory of God, malicing his
workmanship and image, so as the guilt of that sin go^th along with him. Hence
Christ adds his seal, as Mediator, to the Lords first sentence of justice,
in casting him out of heaven; and in regard he continues in that sin, and
adds new soule-murthers, to his first transgression, in tempting, tormenting,
hating, opposing the redemption of man, the Gospel, the offices of Christ, the
Church of Christ, Christ comes in, by his office, as his Judge, to add to his
chains. In which a word, 1. Of the punishment of Devils. 2. Of Christ, as he
is the Judge of Devils.


The punishment has relation to his first sin: His first sin was against the
Holy Ghost, in that being a lamp of light, Satan's sin the s^nne in nature with
the sin against the holy Ghost.
shining up in the high Palace, and standing before the Throne, wanting not any
wicked principle of concupiscence within, or any habitual aversion from God,
looking God in the face, and beholding the first truth, he sinned against God,
and therefore was made an exemplary spectacle to Angels and Men of pure and
unmixed justice, without mercy, and cast down to hell without hope of a
Savior, or redemption; Heb. 2.16. For verily he took not on him the nature of
Angels, but the seed of Abraham.

The evils of punishment inflicted on Satan, are 1. His being cast out of the
presence of God, never to see his face again, Punishments infl^cted on Satan.
nor enjoy his favor. 2 Pet. 2.4. For God spared not the Angels that sinned,
but cast them down to hell. Hence from this Schoolmen infer a 2. punishment,
a perpetual sadness and dejection of mind, for the loss of that happy
fruition of God. But I much doubt, whether sadness for the want of Gods lovely
presence, can consist with the extreme hatred of God, What sadness is in Satan.
and fiery averseness, implacable wrath, and burning envy, that Satan has
against the glory of God, or image of God, or any thing of God; especially
against the Lamb and his followers; against whom he warreth continually. A
sadness there may be in him, because he is a rational creature, in regard
he is fallen from the good of happiness, not of holiness; but conjoined with
wrath and hatred against God: and this is without question in all the damned.

2. The pain inflicted on the understanding, is the hurting of his natural
speculative knowledge. Sure, Satan's natural knowledge hurt, his practical
knowledge that was found, is lost.
if he see not God as the first truth, he sees all deductions from the will,
sovereignty, wisdom, justice of God, etc. more darkly then he did before;
but, if his natural speculative knowledge was utterly lost, there should be no
foundation remaining in him of wrath and envy against God, and his creatures
and image. 2. His true and saving practical knowledge is lost, and in place
thereof a crafty, versutious, cunning, deceitfulness and subtilty to deceive
and tempt; such as is in the Serpent to sting; such a bloody instinct as is in
the Dragon, in the Lion to devour; but otherwise, the Devil is the first
fool of the creation of God, The devil a fool.
and has played the fool above five thousand years; for, in rational
policy, the tempting of our first Parents to sin, though it was a masterpiece
of wit, was the ruin of his Kingdom: and the Serpent, even in the crucifying
of Christ, did buy a scratch in Christ's heel at a dear rate, with the
bruising and grinding to powder the head and life of the Serpent, and the full
destruction of his Kingdom. And by experience Satan knows he is a loser, in
tempting and persecuting the Lord Jesus and his members, yet malice having put
out the light of prudence, he knowingly sows sin, blood, wrath, in Christ's
field; and in so doing he sweateth in laboring the vineyard of the Lord, to
make an harvest and vintage for Christ.

Satan has no infused grace.
3. Infused grace Satan has not at all; because, grace supernatural is a
stem and blossom of heaven: its hard to think that since Satan was thrust
out of heaven, any of the fruits or blossoms of that Paradise can grow in him.
Acquired knowledge Satan may have. And,

4. From this Satan has faith against his will, Jam. 2.19. Its necessary in

but in the exercise, as it were, forced, and compelled, he would wish to want
the constraining power of a natural knowledge: so as this is a wicked faith,
and a tormenting virtue in the Devil, as it is in many wicked men, who desire
nothing more then to have conscience cut off from their soul. As some men are
so pained with a Gangrene in the foot, that they are willing their leg be
sawen off. Or like a man that has a necessary servant, and most useful, yet
because he has one intolerable gadde, he must put him away. For light adds
fear and terror to some distracted persons, and makes them out of measure
furious; therefore ye must close door and window on them, and they are most
sober when they have least light: So here, glancings of conscience serve but to
make some see ghosts of hell, and terrifying sights.

5. Satan can have no hope of deliverance, but knows his prison-doore is
locked on him with a sad key, Satan's despair without all hope.
eternal despair, that so long as the Almighty lives and is God blessed for
ever, so long shall he be miserable. Would sinners lend their thoughts and
faith to eternity, that runs out in so long a thread as ever and ever, and
on pain, horror, and torment for ever and ever, it might be they would not run
and sweat so much in the way of sin.

6. Obstinacy, and invincible obduration and hardness lies on the mind, will,
and affections of the Devils; Satan's obduration.
the cause of which is his habitual continuance in, and love of the sin
against the fair shining and convincing light of seen and enjoyed God, the
justice of God, and the withdrawing of all grace and remedies against wilful
hardening the heart.

7. The breaking of Satan's hopes and counsels in all his ill attempts, his
burning hatred of God, the Lambs victories over the Dragon, the chaining and
bordering of his malicious power, etc. are great punishments.

8. I dare not, nor cannot determine what the fire is that tormenteth him; nor
the place of hell: its more praiseworthy labor, to seek to be delivered, in
Christ, from it, then to search curiously into it.

Satan's Judge and caster out is Christ; as may clearly be gathered from the
words, Now is the Prince of this world cast out. Hence,

Consid. 1. When Christ came to the office of Redeemer and Mediator of his
Church, to deliver his people out of the hands Satan, Christ is Satan's Judge
and caster out.
he found Satan under old treason committed against God; for before this he
kept mankind captive, and found him under a sentence for it, and cast down to
hell: and because Christ was God, and the same God equal with the Father,
therefore he made good his Fathers deed, and puts his seal and Amen to
that sentence; and for new treason against God, in man his Image, whom God had
made lord and little king of the earth, Christ gave out a new sentence against
Satan, Genesis 3.25. I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
seed and her seed: It shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.

Consid. 2. All punishment on Satan is now inflicted by the Mediator Christ;
for since Satan came in the Play, Christ Satan's Judge, and how.
to appear Satan and Adversary to man, he set up another kingdom of
darkness, opposite to the kingdom of the Son of God, Col. 1.13. Joh. 14.30.
he persecuteth the woman that brought forth the Man-child, Revel. 12.13. he
goes forth in his Instruments to gather the kings of the earth, and the whole
world, to the great battle of that great day of God almighty, Revel. 16.14.
and makes war with the Lamb. Revel. 17.13, 14. He is the accuser of the
brethren, Revel. 12.10. The king of the bottomless pit, whose name in the
Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon,
Revel. 9.11. He is the Arch-destroyer, and destroys all in relation to the
Man Christ and his Church; therefore is Christ raised up a Redeemer, a Savior,
to revenge the cause of his brethren, and came in the flesh to destroy Satan
his kingdom and works, to enter in Satan's house to bind the strong man, and
spoil him of his goods, Heb. 2.14. 1 John 3.8. Joh. 14.30. Mat. 12.29, 30.
Genesis 3.16. Col. 2.15, 16. And when Christ, by reconciling all things in heaven
and earth to God, Col. 1.20. became the head of Angels and Men, Col. 2.9. Col.
1.18. Col. 2.10. he was stated in an headship over all the tribes of men and
Angels, to confirm the good Angels that they should not fall, and to redeem
fallen Men; and when all State-solemnities at the Coronation of Jesus Christ are
performed, and the Father had said, Psalm. 2.6. Yet I have set my King on my
holy hill of Sion, Act. 5.31. he must, by his office and Royal place, reign
over the Rebels, that are mixed with the willing Subjects, and bruise them
with a rod of iron, whether they will or no: And as when there is fewd and
wars between two Houses, and blood on either side, there is an h^ire borne
of one of the Houses to make peace between them, and take order with, and
subdue the rebellious, who refuse peace, and to revenge the injuries; so were
there wars between the Sovereign Majesty of the Lord our God* and both
Angel-nature and Mankind. Angels and Men* had highly injured the Lord, and
wounded his honor; Christ Jesus, a borne Heir of the seed of David, and of
the Royal line of heaven, God equal with the Father, comes to the Crown, and
makes peace between the Lord and Men and so far reconcileth the good Angels,
that they cannot fall out with God, but stand by the grace of the new Heir;
and Christ revengeth upon the Devils and the world the wrongs done to God, and
subdueth both under God.

Consid. 3. It is considerable, what wisdom and counsel is here in war:
Satan foiled man, and subdued him as his vassal and slave, to the condemnation
he himself was under; and Man must be king, lord and Judge over Devils. Satan
foiled man as a tempter, a Man destroys Satan as a Judge.
Angels who envied Man's happiness, and destroyed mankind, must appear
personally, be arraigned, sentenced, and condemned before the Man Christ. Man
was shut out of Paradise by the envy of Angels; now has the Man Christ the
keys of Paradise, of heaven and hell, and death and the grave. Christ's
garments are wet and stained, not with Edoms blood, Esai. 62. but (to borrow
the expression) he goes to heaven in triumph, and his apparel red with
Angel-bloud, and so leads captivity it self captive. Other Warriors take
away the life of the living; but he takes away the life of death it self.
Others subdue captives; never one, save the Man Christ, subdued captivity.

Consid. 4. Victory over Devils, by the man Christ, is more glorious, then if
God had interposed absolute Soveraignity Vi^^o^y over the D^vils by the man
Christ m^r^ glori^us th^n ^f G^od a^so^ut^ly ha^ s^bdue^ him.
are the sweet ingredients, going out with the blood of God in it, and
omnipotency is much seen, in that one little despised man of clay, totally
rout^th and destroys Satan, and many legions, so that though Devils keep the
fields, and daily sight; yet they can never make head again against Christ,
nor win one battle, or pull one captive out of Christ's hand.

will cast a man, though he had a jury of Angels to absolve him, and all the men
on earth were on the Inquest and Assise, to carry him up above the skies, and

Angels and men were on you jury to condemn you, to be as foul and guilty, as

hell, as foul and black; we may instance in Jesus Christ, his Apostles, and
the Martyrs of Christ; and thousands, the blind world have written in heaven
amongst the stars, and Gods above the clouds, in the Quire of Angels, as
Augustus Caesar and thousands of these, whom Jesus Christ did never own, but
as enemies. O what is the worth and price of a conscience sprinkled in the
blood of the Lamb? And what a precious voice is the testimony of the Spirit?
And what a valide Pass and a Magna Charta, a noble testificate, is that in

they have not known me, they are sottish children, and they have no
understanding. Yet they are wise as the Devil is, They are wise to do evil,
but to do good, they have no knowledge. They go for heads of wit, and wise
men, who are deep, politic, profound State-Atheists, who can with their
contrivances, roll about the wheels of two Kingdoms, and can stir the helm
of Europe, and yet know nothing of God, but all their wit runs in the Devils
channel, to plot, brew, and hatch wickedness, lies, subvert the cause of the
just, crush the Widow, and murder and starve the Fatherless, bear down
Religion, set up a humane, earthly, civil structure of Government in Christ's
Kingdom. Let them go for wise men, but they are wise for the Devil, Let the
Lord speak to such, Jerem. 8.8. How do ye say, we are wise, and the Law of
the Lord is with us. Verse. 9. Lo they have rejected the Law of the Lord, and
what wisdom is in them? Can these be wise men and great State-wits, and not
rather State-sots, who reject the Wisdom of God? Its now counted State-wisdome
in Scotland, to patch up a false peace with Amaleck, contrary to the Covenant
of God, though Saul give the Amalekits, and their Kings peace, God will give
them no peace.

Use 3.
Use 3. If Satan be so understanding and subtle, so active a Spirit, Then the
Familists err, not knowing the Scriptures; For they say, the Devil is
nothing, yea, not the creature any thing; but God: as (says the Bright-starre,
cap. 8. page 68. 69.) Nothing is but God and his will; page 77. There is
nothing in the creature, which is not the Creator himself; and therefore the
Sun is no sooner hid, but the beams cease to be; So if God hide himself,
and withdraw his hand from the creatures, they suddenly return to their
nothing. But as the beam and beat, though they contain nothing but Sun and
Fire, yet looked upon essentially, as they are in themselves, they are not Sun
and Fire, but only a certain dependant, or a Spark of those: right so the
creature, though all it consists of, is God; yet considered in the own
proper nature depends upon God, its consequently somewhat. And that Blasphemous
piece, called Theologia Germanica, written by a Priest in High Dutch, and
Englished by Giles Randall, Printed at London 1646 by tolleration, says, Sin
and the Devil is nothing, Theolog. Germanica. chap. 2 p. 5.
but when the creature will challenge any good to it self; as to live, know,
briefly to be able to do any thing that can be termed good, as though that
good thing were appertaining to it, then the creature averteth it self from
God, and that aversion is sin. And the Devils sin was, that he did arrogate
this to himself, that he was some thing, and would be some thing, and that
some thing was his, and in his right and power, this arrogancy to be I, to my
self to be me, and to be mine, was Satan's aversion and fall, and this is
still in use. So this Author. Hell and the Devil cannot devise subtiller and
vainer blasphemy; for so the creature is not the creature, the Devil is not a
creature, not a Spirit, not a tempter, not the Prince of the air, not a
roaring Lion, not a liar; and the Holy Ghost in terming the Devil an Angel
created in the truth should sin. Its true, nothing has being of it self,
and independently, and as the cause of all being, but only God the cause of
causes, and prime fountain of being, goodness, and actions: but hence it
cannot follow, that creatures are not true beings, by participation of, and
dependence from the first Ocean, fountain, and cause of all being, and that
goodness and actions, may not be ascribed to them from their derived being
they have from God.

2. Christ-man in ascribing to himself that he is man, that he does the will
of his Father, that he loved his own to the death, should sin. Which is
blasphemy.

3. It is false for Men or Devils, and sinful arogancy to say, they can
subsist, or do keep their being, without a dependence on God, the only first
essential being; but it is contrary to all truth, that they sin, when they
say, they are the creatures of God, and the dependent rays and beams that
flow from God, and the good creatures of God (though by created and dependant
goodness) they neither lie, nor sin, not commit any act of arogancie; then
should it be sin to say that there were any creatures in the world, which is
to belie the Scripture.

4. Its the cursed self-denial of Familists, to say, when they do good or
ill, righteousness, or sin; Its not I, but God in me that does all. And so
that there is but one Spirit of life that acts, and working in all things in
heaven, and in earth, and that is essentially God, and the will of God, which
is all one with God.

5. That vain annihilation, and nothinging of our selves, in being and
working, yea to the annihilating of the man Christ, under pretense of extolling
God, because God works immediately all good and evil in us (say they) and
we but suffer Gods will, and when we thus are mere patient, and suffer G^d to
work his will in us, we are God himself, perfect as God, conform to his
will, nothing in our selves, we being no creatures, but the Creator. That God
manifested in the flesh, is God manifested in the flesh of all men, that the
passion of Christ, in it self is imaginary, but Christ crucified is our pains
and tribulation, which we should welcome as Jesus Christ, and so cast all our
afflictions into the furnace and flames of Christ's torments. As it is said, Let
that mind be in you, that was in Christ. Bright star. cap. 18. page 205.
This (I say) is the dreadful blasphemy now Printed and Preached at London,
without controlement, for the which the judgments of God, sad, and heavy,
cannot be far from the Land. I crave the Readers pardon, that I named such
non-senses and fooleries.

Use 4.
Use 4. By all means, beware of sins against light, such as the Devils first
sin was. Its to j^^low the Devil, to sin against light.
1. To sin with a witness, in the breast, and a witness in heaven, is to
laugh at Christ in his face. 2. Its the Devils back fall; he by such a sin,
fell first from heaven, by staring God on the face, and out-dating light, God,
Conscience, and actual conviction; the Devil, no question, by himself was
warned of his sin, and how dear it would cost him, before he sinned. Suppose
we, that there is a way in a mountain of ye, where thousands in former times
have slidden, and fallen, and bruised all their body and (...) to powder, would
we willingly climb the same rocks, and dream we should escape the same danger?
Legions and millions of Devils fell and bruised their souls to dust, on sins
against light and knowledge, yet do we too daringly climb the same rocks, and
sin daily, against the Sunne-light of the Gospel Grace of God, teaching us to
deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and the warnings of our own conscience;
yea, too many go on against supernatural illumination, and we will but leap
the damned Devils unhappy leap, we know not that victory over one grain weight
of light, leaves behind it pound weights of disposition, and bentnesse to
farther provoking of the Lord: a daring boldness to look God in the face, and
sin, turns quickly in the very sin, as near, in kin, to the Devols
sin, as can be; and renders its Devilish stonpe, and fall down before the
light of a shining command, as the Elect Angels do, who receive Gods commands
with wings, and flee upon obedience as ministering Spirits.

Use 4. Hearden not your hearts, be not obstinate in evil, Use 4.
that is the plague of Devils also, O^d^ration.
men render themselves Devils; with their own hands, they open hell and go
in, and lay the Devils chains and fetters on their own will and mind, when
they resolutely, and deliberately, resist God, and God in a deep judgment in
them binds them, and they cry not; he is deservedly a captive, who twists his
own coards and chains about himself. Selfe-induration is a selfe-hell, and a
selfe-bondage. How afraid should we be to keep loose watch over the heart,
or to give the raines to our own will, to go on against God. For he 1. needs
do no more, but loose an Army, and a strong armed Garrison of sinful thoughts,
as so many Spirits of hell, that are within the town already, and they can
destroy us. 2. The Devil is near by to put in our heart all wickedness, he
has the command of the out-workes; the humors, fancy, disposition, the
spies, and Posts that go in and out, the Sen^^s, we have need to lay the bands

earth give their power and strength to him, and so he is a Principality, 5.
Not that only, but he is a great army, Principalities, Powers, Rulers,
Potentates; we have a mighty army of Lords and Kings to fight against. 6. The
more Spiritual the enemy be, and the more subtle to come in at closed iron

You watch, and he is at your elbow, and covenanting with your watches on the
walls, to corrupt them. 7. When the enemy is strong, if he be wicked, so much
the worse. Now Ephesians. 6.12. we fight against wickedness it self, against
spiritual wickedness; the more wicked the enemy is, he has a greater mind
to fire, and destroy. 8. The more active, the worse is the enemy; Satan has no
office, but to be the butcherer and executioner of justice, and has no
distractions to withdraw him, he may attend upon bloods, and soule-murthers,
and walks in a circle, compassing the earth too and fro, and goes about like
a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour. 9. He has friends within us,
every Saint is a divided party.

5. We have Christ on our side, he has spoiled Principalities and powers; the
Lord, the master of the game, has promised us his might, his strength, all his
forces, grace, wisdom, power, his Angels, that are stronger then ill Angels;
here Angels against Angels. God engaged against hell.

Verse. 32. And I, If I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me. We
have spoken of the power of Christ's death, and of his enemies, the World, and
Satan. Now Christ speaks of the power of his death on the Elect, in drawing
sinners to himself.

The scop of the words is to hold forth the efficacy of Christ's death, ^ix
considerable points touching Christ's drawing of sinners.
in drawing sinners to him. In which we have these considerable points.

1. The drawing it self.

2. The Drawer. I will draw, says Christ. Christ is good, and of excellent
dexterity at drawing of men to God.

3. The persons drawn. All men.

4. The person to whom; the terminus ad quem; To me, says Christ.

5. The condition. If I be lifted up from the earth. Which is not a note of
doubting, whether he would die for us; as we shall hear, but of a sure
condition.

6. The way and manner of his lifting up from the earth is expounded, Verse 33.
To signify, to the hearers, what sort of death he would die, to wit, the death
of the Cross.

Four considerable points touching drawing.
Of drawing it self; these are considerable.

1. The expression and Metaphore of drawing.

2. The reasons moving Christ to draw; the fountain^, causes, and the
disposition and qualifications going before drawing, in the party drawn.

3. The manner of drawing, or the way, and if it be some other thing then
justification.

4. The power and efficacy of drawing.

(...) to draw; as the word (...) Cant. 1.4. Draw me we will run after thee.
Is first, a word of violence and strength. Drawing is by either violence,
wiles, or pers^asion.
1 King. 22.34. A certain man drew a bow, (...) Job 41.1. Will thou draw
Liviathan with thy hook? Joh. 21.11. Simon Peter, (...), drew a net to land.
Acts 16.19. They caught Paul and Silas (...), and drew them to the market place
to the rulers. 2. Drawing is by wiles, and perswation, or love; (For wiles is
covered, or pretended love,) Judge. 4.6. Draw them (by persuasion) to Mount
Tabor to battle. Hos. 11.3. I will draw them (...) with cords of man, with
bands of love. It is such a drawing as is ascribed to the Whore, (though
another word) Prove. 7.21. the Whore, which made the young man to decline, with
the softness of her lips, in fair words, forced him. Jam. 1.14. Every man is
tempted, when he is led, or drawn aside, by his own lust, and enticed. This
drawing is by wiles, to steal a man off his feet. So Psalm. 10.9. A bird is
drawn in the net. It is then a word borrowed from bodily strength, which
draws heavy bodies out of one place to another, by strong hand. The sinner is
a heavy creature. Grace is a strong thing to pull the man out of his element.
There be then in Christ's drawing. 1. Violence. 2. Persuasions of love, strong
love runs from the heart, through all the nerves and veins of Christ's right
arm, to draw a sinner to God. 3. There is art and wiles, He drawe^^.
which is nothing but masked love, for wiles cannot work upon the soul to
draw it, but by the taking of reason, with apprehension of good; Hope is the
painted net that draws men to Christ, and the hope of the prey draws the
Fox to the net, the hope of food, the bird to the snare. The violence that
Christ uses, is not on the reason, will, or any vital principles of the
soul; no principles of life, can act as principles of life, No proper violence
in drawing the will.
from external drawings, and stirrings, life is an internal thing; the line,
and first point of the line, in motions of life, is from within, all the
violence is done to the corrupt accidents, and sinful qualities of the
soul, as to darkness, and sinful ignorance, to unbelief; frowardness
and sowrenesse to Christ, hatred of God, enimity of the carnal mind to the
law of God; put the will once on moving, and set the wheels a stirring toward
Christ, (which is all the difficulty) and the principles of life smile on
Christ, and move apace; but the corruption of will must be removed first, as
suppose, a millstone were kept fast in the air by a strong chain of* iron,
there is violence required to snap in pieces the iron chain, How there is no
violence in being drawn, and yet a necessity from new principles
but none at all to draw the millstone down to the earth, it falls down of its
own accord; this is but a comparison; For the will in its motion to Christ
must not only be freed from the dominion of the clog of the body of sin,
and these natural chains and fetters; but Christ must put new principles, and
a new life, and new wings, and new wheels; and with them act, stir, and move
the will, and then, he drawing, we run, Cant. 1.4.

He that is drawn to Christ, Joh. 6.44. is not altogether willing; as the fish
has no propension of nature, to be haled out of its own element, all the
propension comes from that which sets the will on work. A child takes
medicine, but his propension is stirred from the sugar, that pleases his taste.
He learneth, being hired, that which sets him on work, is not the good that he
sees in the book, nor the beauty that he conceives to be in virtue and
learning, its the apples, the babies you give him as his hire, that acts him;
nor is the will here forced. A hireling caries a heavy burden, not with a
forced will, but there is nothing in the burden that does take his heart; but
the sweating under the burden, come all from money, he is hired, and therefore
does all from the stirrings of his will, that arises from his wages. Men's
coming to Christ, comes not from their natural good-liking they bear to
Christ, but from some higher principle within, and the discovered excellency,
that the Spirit lays open to the soul*

II.
Hence 2. The reasons moving a soul to yield to Christ's drawing, comes under a
twofold consideration; as 1. Natural dispositions. 2. As lustered with some
common grace, and so thought preparatory to conversion and drawing. A twofold
consideration of disp^sitions going before conversion.


In the former consideration, Divines with good reasons, look at them as
sins, and the greatest obstructions of conversion.

1. There is something that is taking with reason, why a man Men have reason
why they will perish. Hen tam dulce est perire.
and gratis. Hell is a death, but a golden death, and fair afar: Ah, its sweet
to men to perish; Hell is a most reasonable choice to the sinner, the chalmers
of death shine with fair paintry to the natural man's reason.

2. Its not single weakness, but wicked and wilful impotency, that keeps men
from Christ: as a beggar would be a king, Will the nearest cause, not weakness
only, why men are not drawn to Christ.
Joh. 15.24. But now they have seen, and hated both me and my Father. The
reason why men think they love Christ, is the luster that education and common
literal report, from the womb, has put upon Christ; our fathers and teachers
said ever, Christ is the Savior of man, and a merciful God, and therefore we
have that common esteem of him; but were we borne of Jewish parents, or among
Jews, We naturally hate Christ, but we see it not.
and taken from our parents, and heard nothing from the womb of Christ, but
what the Jews say, and that is, that he is a false Prophet, that he rose not
from the dead, but that his disciples, by night, stole him away out of the
grave, we should from the womb hate Christ, as well as the Jews. And the like
we may see in Indians, who love and adore the Devil from the womb; but with
this difference, they love Satan truly, because both nature, now corrupt, and
education carries them thereunto; but education can give no man a true love of
Christ. (2.) Whence is it that the world hates the children of God? It is from
instinct and nature, rather then from any imperated acts, Joh. 15.19. Because
ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
world hates you. Verse. 21. But all these things will they do unto you, for my
Names sake. To be chosen out of the world, to carry any thing of Christ and his
image and nature, and to be borne again, and of another seed then the world is
born of, is no ground of arbitrary and elective hatred; but of such hatred as
comes from diverse natural instincts, such as is the hatred between the Wolf
and the Lamb, the Raven and the Dove. If then the world hate the Saints, as
they do, Romans 1.30. and hate Christ, and hate the Saints upon this formal
ground, Because they have in them the nature of God, the image of Christ, Men
naturally hate Christ more then the Saints.
some of the excellency of Christ, then they must hate Christ far more; for,
Propter quodunumquodque tale, id ipsum magis tale. The world hated Christ for
God; for there was more of God in the Man Christ, then ever was in any
creature: then they hated God more, and with a higher hatred. So Christ is the
Sampler and Copy to all the Saints; therefore Christ must be more contrary to
the wicked world, then the Saints are. If you hate the servant for the masters
sake, then you hate the Master more* If you love the nurse for the child's sake,
then you love the child more. So the Jews killed the servants, the Prophets,
they stoned them, and beat them, Mat. 21.35. but they did more to Christ, Verse.
39. They caught him, slew him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and took the
inheritance to themselves. (3.) Men naturally hate the ways of God: If

2. Men have a sort of satisfaction in their natural condition: Men have no
stirrings of desires for a life above them.
he can have no acts of sorrow for want of life. (2.) We do not put forth
any stirring of life or desire toward that which is naturally above us: A child
in the belly has no acts toward a Crown or a Kingdom in this life, because,
desires are bottomed and founded on nature: As an Ape, or a Horse, has no
desire to be a man. Pilate, as if he were burdened with Christ, says, Mat.
27.22. What shall I then do with Jesus that is called Christ? What avails my
birthright to me, says Esau, seeing I die for hunger?

No similitude between the natural man's d^sires and Christ.
3. When beasts and birds are allured by the snare, and fishes by the bait,
death comes to them in the garments of life; for food is all their heaven: and
instinct helps them to prosecute their ends, and there is a natural
similitude and inclination between their nature and what they desire, bottomed
on an instinct, even when the object of their inclination is but dyed with the
hew and apparency of good. But there is no such instinct in the natural man,
nor similitude between a cage of hell, and the beauty and excellency of Christ;
between his sense and the hid manna, or the banqueting house of wine.

4. The natural man cannot come to Christ. In that place Ioh. 6.44. there be
four things considerable.

1. The best of men is unapt to come to Christ, No man, what ever his parts and
eminency be, had he a nature of gold, he cannot come to Christ.

2. He says not, No man comes, as denying the act, for so no man of himself
is an excellent Philosopher, but he denies a power, (...), He cannot come.

3. But help is much, happily if his eyes were open, the will is The place Ioh.
6.44. No m^n can come to me, etc. opened.
Nay says Christ, he is unwilling and unable both: He that cannot come, except
he be haled and drawn, and some violence offered to his corruption, has no
good liking of Christ. But

4. It is but little drawing possibly that will do the business, Angel, can do
much. No, but it is not so, no less (says Christ) can draw a sinner to me
then the arm of the Father, and a pull of his omnipotency, who is greater then
all, Ioh. 10. No man what ever metal he be of, the finest of men can come, or
has power to come to me, and to believe on the only begotten son of God,
except the Father who sent me draw him. We know Christ was much to extol his
Father, his Father was ever in his esteem an eminent one, as Matthew. 11.25, 26,
27. Mark. 14.^6. Luke 23.46. John 3.35. John 5.21. and 6.27. Matthew. 10.32. c.
24.37. John 2.16. and 5.43. and 10.29. c. 19.2. Rev. 2.27. Joh. 15.1.

So is there a power always denied to the natural man to close with Christ,
Romans 8.7. 2 Cor. ^.5.

5. A will to believe and to submit to Christ is denied to natural men, Joh.
5.^0. Ye will not come to me, Will most averse to Christ.
that ye may be 19.14. The enemies of Christ say, (...). We will not have
this man to reign over us. Verse 27. But these mine Enemies that would not
that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay them before me, (...),
these to me seem to be allusions to Isreal's wearying of the Lord of old, Isai.
43.23. I have not wearied thee with incense, Jer. 2.5. What iniquity have your
fathers found in me? Micah 6.3. O my people what have I done unto thee, and
wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. It is strange that sinners
can see a black spot on the Lords fair face, or that their will, that is
nearer of kin to reason, then the affections that are in beasts should be
averse to God; yet it is said of wicked men, that they are haters of God, Romans
1.30. His citizens hated him, Luke 19.14. Joh. 15.24. And especially these
speeches carry allusion to Ps. 81.11. Israel would have none of me. (...).
Israel had no liking of me, no will of me. So that weakness simply is not the
nearest cause of our not coming to Christ, but wilful weakness, or rather
weak-wilfulnesse. 1. Because in agents that cannot work, Will, not weakness
the nearest c^^se of our not coming to Christ.
there impotencie, or lowness of nature, is the cause, as the reason why a
horse cannot discourse as a man, is because his nature is inferior to the
reasonable nature of a man, and not because the Horse will not, but because he
cannot discourse. The cause why a lump of clay casts not such light in the
night, as a candle, or a star in the firmament, is the baseness and opacitie
of the nature of clay to produce such an action, as to give light; there is not
such a thing as will in the clay, which intervenes between its nature, and the
no-giving light in the night. But men hearing the Gospel do not believe, not
only because they cannot, for beasts cannot believe; but because, as Christ
says, They will not believe, Joh. 5.40. They will have none of Christ. Psalm.
81.11. They will not have Christ to reign over them Luke 19.14. And will
intervenes between the impotencie of their will, and their disobedience. 2.
Because that hatred of God, and of Christ, ascribed to unregenerate men, Romans
1.30. Luke 19.14. Joh. 15.24. is the birth that lay in the womb of Will, and
comes from Will as Will, and not only from Will as weak; so men's delighting,
and their loving to be estranged from Christ, and to satisfy themselves with
other lovers, beside Christ, are high bended acts of the Will. Which argues
that not only weakness, but wilfulness has influence in men's unbelief. 3.
The Lord charge men with this, Matthew. 23.37. I would, ye would not. 4.
Conscience takes it on its will, and fathers disobedience on the will. 1. Sam.
8.19. Nay, but we shall, or we will have a King, Jer. 44.16. The people avow
their will and peremptory resolution is, we will not hearken to thee.

6. But for the ground, Free grace the strong and only cause why men are drawn
reason and cause on Christ's part of drawing, it is free grace, and only free
grace, which are holden forth in these Positions.

Pos. 1. As there is no merit, good deserving, work, or hire in the miserable
sinner dying in his blood, dead in sins, out of his wit, and disobedient,
deceived, and serving diverse Lusts, Ezech. 16.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3,
4. Tit. 3.3, 4. So there is as much love, mankindnesse and free grace in
heaven, in the breast of Christ, as would save all in hell, or out of hell. I
speak this in regard, not of the Lords intention, as if he did bear all and
every one of mankind, a good will, purposing to save them. But because their
lies and flows such a Sea, and Ocean of infinite love about the heart, and in
the bowels of Jesus Christ, as would over-save, and out-love infinite worlds of
sinners; (so all could come and draw, and drink, and suck the breasts of
overflowings of Christ's free grace) in regard of the intrinsecall weight and
magnitude of this love, Christ's love can over-save and outlive the world.
that if you appoint banks to channel, or marches to bound this free love, God
should not be God, nor the Redeemer the Redeemer.

Pos. 2. Could any created eye of Men or Angels, reach or compass the thousand
thousand part of this love, The magnitude of free grace.
with one look; such an act of adoration and admiration must follow thereupon,
as should break the soul and breast of this creature, in a thousand pieces;
but Christ in heaven and out of heaven is hid. Infiniteness is a secret that
Angels, or Men never did, never shall comprehensively know, there is a secret
of love seen in heaven, but never seen; how little of the Sea do our
natural eyes behold? Only the superfice. We see but a little part of the
skin, or hide of the visible heavens with our bodily eyes, but so much as is
seen is of exceeding beauty. No eye bodily can see the bottom of the Seas, or
the large in-fields in the visible heavens. If the infinite lump of the
boundless love of Christ were seen at once, what a heavens wonder, what a
worlds miracle would Christ appear to be? But as much of Christ is seen as
vessels of glory, though wide enough, can comprehend. But if Angels and
glorified Saints see much of Christ, and so accordingly as they see and know,
do praise him, and yet cannot over-praise, and out-sing so much as they see;
and if the inside of infiniteness of love, free grace, mercy, majesty,
dominion, be an everlasting Mystery, Angels and Men are below merit, even in
heaven, and Angels and Saints must be ashamed of, and blush at the imagination
of merits; for an infinite lovely Majesty seen, and not praised, nor loved in
any measure of equality or commensuration to his dignity and worth, must lay
infinite, though sinlesse debt for eternity on all the Citizens of glory,
whether home-borne or natives of that Country, as elect Angels; or adopted
strangers, as glorified Saints.

The way of Graces working gracious and free.
Pos. 3. The manner of graces working on Saints is gracious, and so essentially
free; as is evident in our first drawing to Christ, when many sins are
forgiven, and so the soul loves much; and the sweetest burden in heaven, or
out of heaven, is a burden of the love of Christ: All debt must be a burden to
an ingenuous spirit; but the debt of free grace, that lies from eternity on
Angels and Men, is a lovely and a desirable pain. That men before they were
men, and had being, and before all eternity, were in the bosom of Christ the
engaged debtors of the Lamb, in the purpose of free grace loved with an
everlasting love, is a deep thought of love; and that being was gracious
being, before actual being, speaks and cries much love; and its the flower,
the glory, the crown of free grace, that Gods free love in Christ casts
forth the warming rays and beams of the Redeemers kind heart, on men who are
enemies, darkness, haters of God, dead in sin, dying in blood and
pollution. And how broad, how warm, and how ranckly must the fair and large
skirts of Christ's love smell of admirable grace, when they are spread over the
bleeding, the loathsome, the black, and unwashen sinner; is not every word a
heaven. The place Ezech, 16.8. And when I passed by thee, etc. Opened.
Ez. 16.8. Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time,
was the time of love, and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy
nakedness: yea I swear unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, says
the Lord God, and thou becamest mine, etc. Christ's passing by is as a traveller
on his journey, who finds a child without Father or Mother, in the open field
dying, and naked wallowing in blood, and then casting a covering of freelove,
(and love has broad skirts) over his people, and its an expression of much
tenderness, and warmenesse of love. Many articles in that place extol free
grace.

1. Christ is brought in as a passing by-passenger, Articles of free love.
to whom this fondling was no bloud-friend, but a mere stranger; so if
humanity, and man-kindnesse had not wrought on his heart, Christ nothing of
kindred or blood, by our first birth, but strangers from the womb to God, going
a whoring as soon as we are borne.

2. Christ looked on forlorn sinners and there is love in his two eyes; it may
be that bowels of iron, in which lodges I saw thee, my heart, my bowels had
eyes of love toward thee; there was tender compassion in my very look; my
bowels within me, turned and swonned at the cast of mine eye, when I saw thy
misery.

3. Behold, and behold, he would own his own mercy and love; let Angels and
Men wonder at it, that the great and God, should condescend to look on such
base sinners, so far below the free love, and Majesty of God. There is a
behold, a sign put upon this door; come hither Angels and Men, and wonder at
the condiscension. 2. Tenderness. 3. Strength of heat and warmenesse. 4.
Freedom and unhired motions. 5. Riches and abundance. 6. Efficacy and
virtue. 7. The bounty and reality of the free love of Christ.

4. Thy time was a time of loving. What? of loving: it was a time of loathing;
a time of love? when sinners were so God, in their mind by wicked works, Col.
1.21. Dead in sins and trespasses, walking according to the course of this
world, (^n ill Compass to stir by) according to the Prince of the power of
the air, the Spirit that now works in the children of disobedience? Was this
a time of love? Yea, Christ's love cannot be bowed or budded with any thing
without Christ: Its as strong as Christ himself, and sin and hell can
neither break, nor counter-worke the love of Christ; your hatred cannot
countermand his imperious love.

5. It was not a time of single love, but it was a time of loves, Thy time,
Christ has a time, and sinners have a time, when they are ripe for mercy, it
was a time (...) of loves; of much loves, of much love. He loved us, and showed
mercy on us, Ephesians. 2.4. (...), for his great and manifold love, Can. 7.12.
there I will give thee my loves. Cant. 6.2. Thy loves are better then wine, V.
4. We will remember thy loves, more then wine. Its a bundle, a wood of many
loves that is in Christ. Then V. 5. I spread my skirt over thee: He is a
warm-hearted passenger, who in a cold day, will take off his own garment, to
cloth a naked fondling, that he finds in the way; I (says Christ) laid on thee
a naked sinner, the skirt of that love, wherewith the Father loved me. O what a
strange word is that? Joh. 17.26. I have declared unto them thy name, and will
declare it; that the love wherewith thou have loved me, may be in them, and I
in them. Its true, Christ could not be stripped naked of the love, wherewith his
Father loved him, and that love being essential to God, cannot be formally
communicated to us, yet the fruit of it, is ours; and the Lord Jesus spreds
over his redeemed ones, a lap of the same love and bowels, in regard of the
fruits of free love, which the Father did from eternity spread over himself.

I covered (says Christ) thy nakedness. O what a garment of Glory is the
imputed righteousness of Christ? Bring forth the best robe, and put on him.
This is the white raiment that cloatheth the shame of our nakedness.

7. Yea I swear unto thee, and entered in covenant with Equals do much, if they
swear, and enter in covenant with equals; But O humble Majesty, of an infinite
God, who would enter in covenant with sinners, wretched sinners, at our worst
condition, and would quiet our very unbeleeving thoughts of sinful jealousy,
with an oath of the most high, who has no greater to swear by then himself.

And thou becammest mine, Hebr. thou wast for me, set a part for me. Here
stouping, and low condescending love to own sinners, and a claim and
propriety on wretched and far off strangers, to name dying, bleeding,
sinning, and God-hating dust, and guilty-perishing clay, his own proper goods.

Then washed I thee with water. That Christ's so fair hands should stoop to
wash such blacke-skinned and defiled sinners, in either free justification, or
in purging away the rotten blood, and filth of the daughter of Sion, in
regeneration, makes Good, that (to the free love of Christ, that which is
black is fair and beautiful.)

10. And I anointed thee with oil, free grace, and Christ dwelling by Faith,
Ephesians. 3.17. in Saints, that are the flower, Church, is a high expression of
free love. Sinners are worse then withered and dry clay, without saving grace.

11. And to all these, Christ clothed his naked Church with he puts
bracelets on her hands; a chain of gold of grace about her neck, a Jewel on
her forehead, eare-rings on her ears, and a beautfull crown on her head, the
grace to profess Christ, and carry on the forehead, the name of the Father, of
the Lamb, and of the new Jerusalem, the bride, the Lambs wife; before Men and
Angels, is a fair ornament.

12. Beside, a name, and the perfume of a sweet and precious report in the
World, adds a luster to the Saints, who Ezech. 16.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Ephesians.
2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Pos. 4. Its an abasement of Christ, that he who gives such a ransom to
justice for free grace, should wait for a penny from sinners, that sinners must
bid, and buy, and engage him to give, and Christ say, You must give me more, I
must sell, That Christ is gracious, for hire is an abasing of Christ.
not give grace, for nothing. Your penny worthes cannot roll about that
everlasting wheel of free grace, the decree of election, or bow, or break
Christ's free heart to save you, rather then another. 2. There is no more
proportion between wages and saving grace, then between wages and eternal
glory. Now there is much debt in heaven more then on earth, but no merit at all
in either heaven or earth, except Christ for all. Merit cannot grow in a land
of grace. 3. Grace is the sinners gain, but no gain to Christ; Is it gain to
the Sun, that all the earth borrowes light and Summer from it? Or to the
clouds that they give rain to the earth? Or to the Fountains, Christ
superlative.
that they yield water to men and beasts? Can ye make infinite Jesus Christ
rich? Ye may add to the Sea, though very little. The Creator could have made a
fairer Sun, then that which shines in the firmament, though it be fair
enough. But the Mediator Christ is a Savior so molded, and contrived, that
its unpossible to add to his beauty, excellency, loveliness; Man or Angels,
could not wish a choiser Redeemer, then Christ; if your wages could add to
him, he should be needy, as you are.

Pos. 5. Free Grace is the loveliest piece in heaven or earth, it makes us
partakers of the Divine Nature. How like free grace is to God
2 Pet. 1.4. And though the creature graced of God, keep an infinite distance
from God, and be not Goded, nor Christed, as some do blasphemously say. Yet it
is considerable that there is a shadow (though but a shadow) of proportion
between that expression of Paul, 1 Cor. 15.10. (...). By the grace of God, I
am that I am, and that which the Lord says of himself, Exodus 3.14. speaking
to Moses, (...) I am that I am. Grace is but a borrowed accident of the
creature; not heritage, not his essence. But Paul would say, all his
excellency was from free grace. Were any indifferent beholder up in the
highest Jerusalem after the day of judgment, The wonder of grace in heaven.
to see the company of the Lamb, and his court, so many thousand pieces of
clay, then clothed with highest grace, smiling on the face of him that sits on
the throne, made eternal Kings, that for glory and robes of grace, and the
weighty crown, you cannot see a bit of clay, and yet originally, all these are
but glistering bits of clay, and graced dust; it should tire the beholder with
admiration. O but the second Creation is a rare piece of workmanship. But
again come and see that heaven of wonders, Wh^ grace in Christ now glorified
the Man-Christ, who as man has, 1. Flesh and blood, and a man's soul, as we
have; but O so incomparably wonderful, as the grace of God without merit has
made the man Christ. Grace has exalted this man to a high throne, the God
head, in person dwells in this clay tent of endless glory, and God speaks
personally out of this man, and this Emmanuel is God, and the man is so
weighted with glory, as all that are there, (and they be a fair and numerous
company) are upon one continued act of admiring, enjoying, praising, loving
him, for no less date, then endless eternity, and they can never be able to
pull their eyes off him. And then grace seen, enjoyed as it grows at the
Wellhead, up in Emmanuels highest and newest land is of an other strain,
sweeter and more glorious then down here in the earth, which is not the
element of grace, they are but glympses, borrowed shadows, chips, and drops
of grace that are here. That is a world of nothing, but Graoe; all which I
speak, to let us see, how far free Grace is from base hire, and that we may
not dare, to make Christ, who is an absolute free King, an hireling.

Pos. 6. Grace is not educed or extracted out of the potency of any created
nature. Grace is borne in heaven, Grace the only birth of heaven.
and came from the inmost of the heart of Christ; it has neither seed nor
parent on earth, therefore the Lord challenges it as his own, 2 Cor. 12.9.
The Lord said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee. 2 Timothy 2.1. The grace
that is in Christ Jesus. 1 Cor. 15.10. The grace of God. 2 Cor. 13.14. The
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Gal. 1.15. He called me by his grace: If we
could engage the grace of God, or prevent it, then should grace be our birth;
but grace is not essential to Angels. Its a doubt if any creature can be
capable by nature of any possibility natural not to sin, it is much to know
the just owner of grace who begot it? It came out of the eternal womb and
bowels of Jesus Christ.

Quest. But are there no preparations either of nature or at least of grace
going before saving grace, What preparations go before conversion.
and the souls being drawn to Christ?

Ans. That we may come to consider preparations or previous qualifications to
conversion. Let us consider whether Christ coming to the soul has need of an
Usher.

Asser. 1. Dispositions going before conversion, come under a fourfold
consideration. 1. As ^fficient causes, A fourefold consideration of
preparations before conversion.
so some imagine them to be. 2. As materially and subjectively they dispose the
soul to receive grace. 3. Formally or morally, either as parts of conversion,
or moral preparations having a promise of conversion annexed to them. 4. As
means in reference to the final cause, or to the Lords end in sending these
before; and what is said of these, may have some truth proportionably in a
Churches low condition or humiliation, before they be delivered. We may also
speak here of dispositions going before the Lords renewed drawing of sinners
al-ready converted, after a fall, or under desertion, Cant. 1. Draw me, we will
run.

Asser. 2. No man but Pelagians, Arminians, and such do teach, No preparations
from nature.
if any shall improve their natural habilities to the uttermost, and stir up
themselves in good earnest to seek the grace of conversion, and Christ the
wisdom of God, they shall certainly, and without miscarrying, find what they
seek. 1. Because no man, not the finest and sweetest nature can engage the
grace of Christ, or with his penny or sweating, earne either the kingdom of
grace, or glory; whether by way of merit of condignitie, or congruity. Romans
9.16. So then, it is not in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but of
God that shows mercy. 1 Timothy 1.9^ Who has saved us, and called us, with an
holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began. So Ephesians.
2.1, 2, ^, 4, 5. Tit. 3.3, 4, 5. Ezech. 16.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. (2.) Because
there is no shadow of any engagement of promise on Gods part, or any word for
it. Do this by the strength of nature, and grace shall be given to you. 3.
Nor are we ashamed to say with the Scripture, its as unpossible to storm
heaven, or make purchase of Christ, by the strength of nature, as for the dead
man to take his grave in his two arms, and rise and lay death by him, and
walk: Nor does this impossibility free the sinner from guiltiness and
rebukes. 1. Because it is a sinfully contracted inability, except we would deny
original sin. 2. Its voluntary in us, and the bondage that we love. 3. The
Scripture both calls it impossibility, and also rebukes it as sinful. Joh. 6
44. Romans 8.^, 7, 8. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13. chap. 4.17, 18, 19. chap. 5.8.

Asser. 3. All preparations even wrought in us, by the common and general
restraining grace of God, No preparations can have effective influence in our
being drawn to Christ.
can have no effective influence to produce our conversion, from the Scriptures
alleged; for then should we be called, saved, and quickened, when we are dead
in sin, foolish, disobedient, and enemies to God, (...), and (...), According
to our works of righteousness which we had done, contrary to Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3,
4, 5.11.12, 13. 2 Timothy 1.9. Tit. 3.3. (2.) Then common general gifts might
also engage Christ's free grace. 3. Men might prevene Grace, and forestall
Christ and his merits, which overturnes the foundation of the Gospel, and
cries down Christ and free Grace. Preparations before conversion no formal
part of conversion.


Asser. 4. All these foregoing endeavors and sweatings being void of Faith,
cannot please God, Hebr. 11.6. These who act in the strength of them, are yet
in the flesh, and not in the Spirit, and so can do nothing acceptable to God,
being yet out of Christ, Romans 8.8. Joh. 15.4, 5, 6. and the tree being corrupt,
the fruit must be sour, and naught; humiliation, sorrow for sin, displeasure
with our selves, that go before conversion, can be no formal parts of
conversion, nor any essential limbs, members or degrees of the new creature;
nor so much as a stone or pin of the new building. Divines call them, gradus ad
rem, initium materiale conversionis; non gradus in re, nec initium formale: For
parts of the building remain in the building; when the house is come to some
perfect frame, all those bastard pieces, coming not from the new principle the
new heart, Christ formed in the soul, are cast out as unprofitable. Paul, when
he meets with Christ, casts off his silks and sattins, that he was lordly of
while he was a Pharisee, as old rags, loss and dung, and acts now with far
other principles and tools. Its all new work, after another Sampler; heaven
works in him now.

Asser. 5. There be no Mo^all precepts before conversion to which any promise
i^ annexed.
Those are not moral preparations which we perform before conversion, nor
have they any promise of Christ annexed to them; as, He that is humbled under
sin, shall be drawn to Christ: He that wishes the Physician, shall be
cured, and called to repentance: We read of no such promise in the word. 2. A
man not in Christ, is without the sphere or element of Christ, at the wrong
side of the door of the sheepfold, he is not in Emanuels land; and all the
promises of God are in Christ, Yea and Amen, 2 Cor. 1.20. The whole stock of
Gospel-promises are put in Christ, as the first Subject; No promises out of
Christ.
and believers have them from Christ, at the second hand. Christ keeps, as the
true Ark, the book of the Testament, the believers Bible. Its true, the new
heart is promised to the elect, even while they are not in Christ, but they
cannot make claim to that promise till they be first in Christ: but those
promises are made, in a special manner, to Christ, as to the head of the
redeemed, to be dispensed by Christ, to those only whom the Father gave him
before time. And as the promises are peculiar to Christ, so the persons and
grace promised, both the one and the other, are due to Christ, and result from
the Head, to those who in Gods decree only shall be members; as
righteousness, life eternal, and perseverance, are made to those that are
members. 3. Many run, and obtain not, 1 Cor. 9.24, 25, 26. Many strive to
enter in, and shall not be able, Luke 13.24. Many lay a foundation, and are not
able to finish, Luke 14.29. Many hunt, and catch nothing: Many have storms of
conscience, as Cain, and Judas, who go never one step further. When therefore
Antinomians impute to us, that we teach, That to desire to believe, is faith:
To desire to pray, Saltm^rsh ^ree-grace, c. 2. page 1^, 18.
is prayer. M Den Co^f^ren^e ^etw^e^e the Sick man and a (...). p 3. In what
sense a desire to pray and to b^leeve is prayer and faith.
They foulely mistake; for raw desires, and wishes after conversion, and
Christ, are to us no more conversion, and the souls being drawn to Christ,
then Esau's weeping for the blessing, was the blessing; or Balaam's wish to die
the death of the righteous, was the happy end of such as die in the Lord. But
the sincere desires and good will of justified persons, are accepted of the
Lord, for the deed: and when Christ pronounces such blessed as hunger for
righteousness, we say, in that sense, a sincere desire to pray, and believe,
is materially, and by concomitancy, a neighbor, and near of kin to believing,
and praying, A virtuall or seminall intention to pray, believe, love Christ,
do his will, is in the seed, praying, believing; when the intention is
supernatural, and of the same kind with the act; as the seed is the tree: We
say not so of natural intentions and desires. As Abraham's sincere intention to
offer his son, was the offering of his son; the widows casting in her mite,
was, in her honest desire, the casting in of all that she had; certainly, not
all simply, that had been against charity toward her self: but (2) single
desires, unfeigned aims, weigh as much with Christ, as actions, in their
reality. So we say many are, in affections, Martyrs, who never die nor suffer
loss for Christ; because nothing is wanting on the part of such Saints, thus
disposed, but that God call them to it. So Abraham offered his son Isaac to
God; because Abraham did all on his part, and he was not the cause, why he
was not offered and made an actual sacrifice to God; but Gods countermand and
his forbidding was the cause, and nothing else.

Asser. 6. The humiliation and sorrow for sin, and desire of the Physician, by
way of merit, or 2. by way of a moral disposition, having the favor of a
Gospel-promise, do no more render a soul nearer to Christ and saving grace,
then the want of these dispositions; for as a Horse, or an Ape, though they
come nearer to some shadow of reason, and to man's nature, then the Stork, or
the Ass, or then things void of life, as stones and the like; yet as there is
required the like omnipotency to turn an Ape into a Man, as to make a stone a
son of Abraham; so the like omnipotency of grace is required to turn an
unhumbled soul into a saved and redeemed Saint, as to turn a proud Pharisee
into a Saint. And merit is as far to seek in the one, as the other. So an
unconverted sinner, though some way humbled, if the Lord of free grace should
convert hi^, were no less obliged to free grace, and no less from laying any
tie or bands of merits, or obligation, by way of promise, on Christ, for his
conversion, then a stone made a believing son of Abraham, should be in the
same case of conversion. And 3. the humbled soul, for ought he know^s, (I
speak of legal humiliation) has no more any Gospel-title or promise that
saving grace shall be given to him, even of mere grace, upon condition of his
humiliation, or external hearing, or desire of the Physician, then the proud
Pharisee. Material (...) so more in some (...).
Yet as the body framed and organized is in a nearer disposition to be a house
to receive the soul, then a stone, or a block; so is an humbled and dejected
soul, such as cast-down Saul, and the bowed-down Jayler, and those that were
pricked in their hearts, Act. 2. in the moment before their conversion were
nearer to conversion, and in regard of passive and material dispositions made
by the Law-worke, readier to receive the impression and new life of Christ
formed in them, then the blaspheming Jews. Act. 13. and the proud Pharisees,
who despised the counsel of God, and would not be baptized, Luke 7.30. There
be some preparatory colors in dying of cloth, as blue, that dispose the cloth
for other colors more easily; so is it here: And a fish that has swallowed
the bait, and is in the bosom of the net, is nearer being taken, then a fish
free and swimming in the Ocean; yet a fish may break the net, and cut the
angle, and not be taken. A legally-sitted man may be not far from the
Kingdom of God, Mar. 12.34. and yet never enter in. And those same
dispositions, in relation to Gods and in saving the elect, are often means, and
disposing occasions, fitting souls for conversion: though some be like a piece
of gold lying in the dirt, Dispositions (...) conversion.
yet it is both true metal, and has the Kings stamp on it, and is of equal
worth with that which goes current in the market. So, in regard of Gods
eternal election, many are in the way of sin, and not converted as yet,
notwithstanding all the luster of foregoing preparations, though they be as
truly the elect of God, as either those that are converted, yea or glorified
in heaven; yet their preparations do lead them, in regard of an higher power,
(that they see not) to saving grace. And for any thing revealed to us, God
ordinarily prepares men by the Law, and some previous dispositions, before they
be drawn to Christ. I dare not peremptorily say, God may use a prerogativ^
Royal in co^verting without disp^s^tions, or in working them most swiftly.
that God uses no prerogative Royal, or no privileges of Sovereignty, in the
conversion of some who find mercy between the water and the bridge; yea, I
think that Christ comes to some like a Roe, or a young Heart, skipping and
leaping over hills and mountains, and passes over his own set line, and
snatcheth them out of hell, without these preparations; at least, he works
them suddenly: And I see no inconvenience, but as in Gods ways of nature, he
can make dispensations to himself, so in the ways of grace, we cannot find
him out. However, sure of crabbed and knotty timber he makes new buildings;
and it is very base and untoward clay that Christ, who makes all things new,
cannot frame a vessel of mercy of. To change one specie or kind of a creature
into another, a lion into a lamb, and to cause the wolf and the lamb dwell
together, and the leopard lie down with the kid, and the calfe and the young
lion and the fatling together, and a little child to lead them, is the proper
work of Omnipotency, whatever be the preparations, or undisposition of sinners.

Not any Protestants ever taught that Evangelike Repentance is a previous
preparation to conversion. Antinomians salumniate us in this.
Asser. 7. Not any Protestant Divines, I know, make true repentance a work of
the Law, going before faith in Christ. 1. The Law speaks not one word of
Repentance; but says, either do, or die. Repentance is an Evangelike
ingredient in a Saint. 2. Christ was made a Prince, and exalted to give
repentance, Act. 5.31. and the Law as the Law, has not one word of Christ,
though it cannot contradict Christ, except we say, that there be two
contradictory wills in Christ, which were blasphemy; but some dispositions
before conversition, I conceive Antinomians yield to us. Antinomians yield
preparations, which is refuted.
For one says, Saltmarsh Free grace, cap. 2. page 16.
speaking of the manner of his conversion. One maine thing, I am sure, was to
get some soule-saving-comfort, that moved me to reveal my troubled conscience
to godly Ministers, and not in general to allay my trouble. Yet I can make
good from Scripture, that this desire can be in no unconverted soul; a
Physician that mistakes the cure doctrinally, will prove a cousening comforter.
And another Eaton Honey-combe, ^a. 2. page 7.8.
says. The persons capable of justification are such, as truly feel what
lost creatures they are in themselves, and in all their works: this is all the
preparative condition that God requires on our part, to this high and heavenly
work, for hereby is a man truly humbled in himself, of whom God speaks,
saying, -- I dwell with him that is of an humble Spirit, etc. To make persons
capable of justification, here is required a true feeling that they are lost in
themselves, and in all their works. But this can be no preparative condition
of justification, as Eaton says, Because true feeling must follow Faith, not
go before it. True and lively feeling of sin (...) not go before, but must so
low after conversion.
And 2. true feeling is proper to justified persons; nothing going before
justification, and so, which is found in unjustified persons, can be proper to
justified persons only. 3. Antinomians say, Sinners as Sinners, and
consequently all sinners are to believe justification in Christ, without any
foregoing preparation. This man says, Prepared and feeling persons that are
sensible of sin, are only capable of justification. 4. To truly feel a
lost condition, cannot be all the Preparative condition, for the word has
annexed no promise of justification to the unjustified, who shall feel his
lost condition. For the place Esai 57. speaks of a justified sinner, not of
an unjustified, who is only prepared for justification. 1. Because God dwells
in this humbled soul, then he must be justified and converted. Ephesians. 3.17.
That Christ may dwell in your heart by faith. 2. This is a liver by faith, and
so justified; the just shall live by faith, Habak. 2.4. Romans 1.17. Gal. 3.11.
Hebr. 10.38. And he must live by Faith, whom the high and lofty One revives.
Objections of Antinomians especially of Saltmarsh, Free grace, c. ^. page 1,
20. etc. removed.


Object. 1. But to bid a troubled soul be humbled for sin, and pray, and set
upon duties, and speak nothing of Christ to them; whereas poor souls cannot
pray in that condition, is to teach them to seek righteousness in themselves.

Answ. 1. Satan cannot say, that we teach any to set on duties, and to silence
Christ's strength and grace, To do duties without relying on them, is not to
seek righteousness in our selves.
by which only duties may be done. 2. To bid them set on duties, as their
righteousness before God, and as the way to find rest and peace for their
souls, and that speaking nothing of Christ, we disclaim as Antichristian and
Pharisaicall^ 3. It is no argument, but the Arminian objection against free
Grace, not to bid a troubled soul pray, because he cannot pray without the
Spirit, for Peter, Act. 3. bids Simon Magus, who was in the gall of
bitterness, pray, yet without the Spirit, he could not pray. Antinomians
exhort troubled souls, though not converted, They are co^mand^ed to (...) have
not the Spirit, without which they cannot pray.
to believe in Christ: Yet they are as unable to believe without the Spirit, as
to pray without the Spirit. 4. To bid them set on Evangelike duties, without
trusting in them, that is, to feel their lost condition* to despair of
salvation in themselves, to look a far off to Christ, to desire him, are the
set way that Christ walks in, to fit us for saving Grace.

Object. 2. Despair of salvation in my self, is a part of Faith, so you
exhort the troubled in mind at first to believe.

Answ. Not so: Judas and Cain both dispaired of salvation in themselves,
Dispairing of salv^tion in our self no part of such, but w^^ught by the Law,
in ^^ry never converted.
yet had they no part of saving faith. Its unpossible that any can rely on
Christ while they leave resting on false bottomes; Faith is a saying and a
swimming, Ships cannot sail on mountains, its ^npossible to swim on dry
land; as it is impossible to have a soul, and not to have a love; so we cannot
have a love to lie by us, as useless; but a lover we must have, and Christ's
work of conversion is orderly; as first to plow, and pluck up, so then to sow
and plant; and first, Christ take us in our (...) before we ^eleeve.
to take the soul off old lovers. We are on a way of gadding to seek lovers.
Jer. 2.^6. On a high and lofty mountain to set our bed, Esai 57.7. God must
straw thorns and briars in our love-bed, and take Ephraim off his Idols, Hos.
14.6. and from riding on horses, and make the soul as white and clean paper,
that Christ may print a new lover on it. Therefore its young mortification in
the blossom, to give half a refusal to all old lovers; this is Christ's aim,

Object. 3. Desires to pray and believe, being sometimes cold, sometimes none at
all, cannot satisfy a troubled soul. I must have besides desires, endeavors:
And desires to desire, and sorrow, because I cannot sorrow for sin, are but
Legal works; not such as are required in a broken heart.

Answ. Desires going before conversion, are nothing less, then satisfactory,
nor are they such as can calm a storming conscience: he knows not Christ, who
dreams that a wakened conscience, can be calmed with any thing, less then
the blood of Jesus Christ, that speaks better things then the blood of Abel.
Never Protestant Divines promise soule-rest in preparations, that are wrought
by the law. Christ only, (...) to (...).
2. If Antinomians can give soule-rest to troubled consciences, by all the
promises of the Gospel, and raise up the Spirits of Judas, or Cain to found
comfort, let them be doing; yea, or to weak afflicted souls: while the Spirit
blows right down from the Advocat of sinners, at the right hand of God, we
much doubt. Sure there is a lock on a troubled conscience, that the
Gospel-letter, or the tongue of Man or Angel can be no key to open. Christ has
reserved a way of his own to give satisfaction to afflicted Spirits. But the
question is now, supposing ye deal with unconverted men, whether or no ye
are not. First, to convince them of the curses of the Law to come on them, to
humble them, and so to chase them to Christ; and if to bid them be humbled, and
know their dangerous condition, the state of damnation; and set to these
preparatory duties, be to teach them to seek righteousness in themselves. We
answer no.

Object. 4. If we preach wrath to believers, we must either make them believe,
they lie under that wrath, or no; Crisp Vol. ^. Ser. 1.130.1^1.132.1^3.134.135.
if they be not under that wrath, we had as good hold our tongues, if we say,
if they commit these and these sins, they are damned, and except they
perform such and such duties, and except they walk thus and thus holily, and
do these and these good works, they shall come under wrath, or at least, God
will be Angry with them; what do we in this, but abuse the Scriptures? We
undo all that Christ has done, we b^ly God, and tell believers that they are
under a covenant of works. -- I would have wrath preached to believers, that
they may abstain from sin, because they are delivered from wrath, not that
they may be delivered from wrath; for God has sworn, Isai 54. as the world
shall be no more destroyed with waters, so he will be no more wrath with his
people.

Answ. 1. We are to make believers know if they believe not, and walk not
worthy of Christ, in all holy duties; Wrath is to be preached to b^leevers, and
how.
their faith is a fancy, and a dead faith, and the wrath of God abides on
them, and they are not believers. 2. Though they be believers, wrath must be
preached to them, and is preached to them every where in the New Testament; as
death, To. 6.21.22. damnation, To. 14.23. the wrath of God, Ephesians. 5.6*
condemnation, 2 These. 1.8. perdition, flaming fire, eternal fire, 1 Cor. 3.17.
1 Cor. 11.32.34. Jude 7.8. 1 Timothy 6.9. 1 Cor. 16.22. to the end they may make
sure their calling and election. 3. What is this, but to make a mock of all the
threatenings of the Gospel? For by this argument, the threatenings are not to be
preached to the Elect before their conversion, except we would make them
believe a ly, that they are reprobats, and under wrath, when they are under no
wrath at all, but from eternity were delivered from wrath, nor should the
Gospel-threatnings be preached to reprobats. Why? show me one word where
Pastors are bidden tell men they are to believe, they are reprobats, and under
eternal wrath, peremptorily, except we know them to have sinned against the
Holy Ghost. 4. Nor is deliverance from wrath to be believed as absolutely by
us; whether we believe and walk worthy of Christ, or do no such thing, but
walk after the flesh as we are to believe the world shall never be destroyed
with waters; that is, a comparison to strengthen the peoples weak faith. Else I
retort it thus, whether the world believe in Christ, or not, they shall never
be drowned with water, and that we are to believe absolutely. A nam^l^sse
pamphlet of Antinomian answered ^y N. Hi^de.
Then by this reason, whether men believe on Christ, or no, there is no
condemnation, or wrath to be feared. The contrary is expressly, Joh. 3.18.36.
I take the mystery to be this; Antinomians, would have no moral, no
Ceremonial Law preached at all; and therefore one of them writes expressly.
1. That there be no commandments under the Gospel. 2. No threatenings or
penalties at all. 3. That the whole Law of Moses Moral, as well as
Ceremonial, is abrogated under the Gospel. That is a merry life.

Object. 5. Other Preachers bid the troubled soul be sorry for sin,
Saltmarsh.
lead a better life, and all shall be well.

Answ. Such as lead not men to Christ, with their sorrow for sin, or to any
good life, that is not, or fits not for the life of faith, are none of ours,
but the Antinomians.

Object. 6. But others bid the troubled soul believe, but he must first seek
in himself qualifications, Saltmarsh
or conditions, but this is to will them to walk in the light of their own
sparks.

Answ. If to bid men abstain from flagitious sins, and from seeking glory of
men, that are both neck-breakes of faith, Joh. 5.44. and bring men under
eternal displeasure, both before, and after we believe, be to walk in the
light of our own Sparks; then when the Lord forbids these in his Law, and
commands both the believer and unbeleever, the contrary virtues he must
counsel the same with us. To believe and not be humbled, and despair of
salvation in your self, is to presume, he that believes right is cast on that
broaken board, like a ship-broken man, either must I cast my self on the Rock
Christ, or then drown eternally and perish: The unjust Steward was at, ( what
shall I do) ere he came to a wise resolution; to go the road way that Christ
leads all believers, is not to walk in the light of our own sparks. Its one
thing to seek qualifications of our selves, trusting in them; and another
thing to seek qualifications in our selves, as preparatory duties wrought by
Christ's grace; the former we disclaim, not the latter.

Object. 7. I will relate mine own experience. First, when I was minded to make
away my self, for my sin; S^l^mar^hes own experience.
the Lord sent into my mind this word. I have loved thee with an everlasting
love. Ah thought I then, has God loved me with such an everlasting love, and
shall I sin against such a God? 2. Many doubts and fears arose from the
examination of my self, I was afraid of being deluded. 3. The Promise, Esai.
55.1. did sweetly stay my heart, Christ in his ordinances witnessed to me, that
he was mine. 4. I went on for some time full of joy. 5. I was in fears again,
that I could not pray, but I had a promise, I will fulfill the desires of them
that fear me, etc.

Answ. The method of the conversion of a deluded Antinomian, is no rule to
others. 2. Nor do I think that G^d keeps one way with all, especially, when
this m^^s ^^st st^p is from nature, and thoughts of selfe-murther, up to the
Lambs book of life, the secret of eternal election in the b^^ast of God, I
have loved thee with an eternal love. The ^zspan^ pr^sumpption and to believe a
lie.
How knew the Author this to be Gods voice from a qualification in his soul?
It kept him from selfe-murther. Ye see qualifications in our self, which the
Author says is the way of Legal Preachers, are required in any that believe.
2. It is utterly false that the Gospel-faith commanded to all the Elect and
Reprobate, is the apprehention of Gods eternal love to me in particular, the
Scripture says no such thing. Experience contrary to Scripture can be no
leading rule. So the Antinomian way of conversion is, that every soule-troubled
for sin, Elect, or Reprobate, is immediately, without any foregoing
preparations, or humiliation, or work of the law, to believe that God loved
him with an everlasting love. A manifest lie, for so Reprobats are to believe a
ly, as the first Gospel Truth. This is I confess a honey-way, and so
Evangelike, that all the damned are to believe, that God did bear to them the
same everlasting good will and love he had in heart toward Jacob. 2. All
Reprobates may abstain from selfe-murther, out of this principle, of the Lords
everlasting love of election, revealed immediately, at first without any
previous signs, or qualifications going before. 3. The Gospel we teach, says
eternal election, Faith is not formally the apprehension of Gods eternal love
of election.
is that secret in the heart of the Lamb, called his book; so as really God
first loves and chooses the sinner to salvation, and we are blacked with hell,
lying amongst the pots, till Christ take us up, and wash, and lick the Leopard
Spots off us; but to our sense and apprehension; we first love and choose him
as our only liking, and then by our faith, and his love on us, we know he has
first loved us, with an everlasting love: but there be many turnings, windings,
ups, and and downs, ere it come to this. I have not heard of such an
experience, that at the first, without any more ado, forthwith, the Lord
says, Come up hither, I will cause thee read thy name in the Lambs book of
life; The same Author says, Election is the secret of God, and belongs to
the Lord. Page 104. and shall the believing of the love of election to glory
be the first Medicine that you give to all troubled consciences, Elect and
Reprobate? This is to quench the fire, by casting in oil; but if Antinomians
take two ways, one with the unconverted Elect, troubled in conscience; another
with unconverted Reprobats, so troubled; we should be glad to hear these two
new ways. 4. In the second place, (he is so well acquainted with the way of
the Spirit, as if through the casement of the Cabinet-counsell of God, he had
seen and reckoned on his fingers all the steps of the stairs;) he says, He
had many doubts and fears to be deluded; that is, he doubted if his faith was
true and saving: for this is all the delusion to be feared upon
self-examination; So Page 24. c. 2. But you may read his words, chap. 5. page
93. I find not any (says the same Author) in the whole course of Christ's
preaching, or the Disciples, when they preached to them to believe, asking the
question, whether they believed, or no. then it is like this experience finds
no warrant or precedent in the Saints to whom Christ and the Apostles preached.
A contradiction in Sal^marsh.
5. The sweet witnessing of the Spirit, from Esai 55.1. Ho, every one that
thirsts, come to the waters, is Gospel-honey, but consider if there were no
law-worke preparing, no needle making a hole before Christ should sew together
the sides of the wound. Its but a delusion. All come to Christ with foul
faces, that ordinarily come.
1. Because Esai 61.1. no whole-hearted sinners meet with Christ; none come at
first laughing to Christ, all that come to Jesus for help, come with the tear
in their eye. 2. To come dry and withered to the waters, Esai 55.1. is the
required preparation. 3. The gold in a beggars purse in great abundance is to
be suspected for stolen gold, because he labored not for it. This, I say not,
because preparations, and sweatings, and running, that go before conversion,
are merits, or such as deserve conversion, or that conversion is due to them.
Antinomians impute this to us; but unjustly, I humbly conceive it not to be the
doctrine of Luther, Calvine, or Protestants, which Libertines charge us with:
that I may clear us in this, let these propositions speak for us.

Propos. 1. We cannot receive the Spirit, by the preaching of the Law, and
covenant of Works; but by the hearing Gal. 3. The Law its alone, can chase men
from Christ, but never make a new creature; nor can the letter of the Gospel
without the Spirit do it.

Propos. 2. when we look for any thing in our selves, or think that an
unrenewed man is a confiding person to purchase Christ, we bewilder our selves,
Not^ing in our selves can ^it^y (...) ^or (...).
and vanish in foolishness: This wrong Libertines do us; from which we are
as far as the East from the West.

Propos. ^. It is not our doctrine, but the weakness of sinners, and of the
flesh, that we should be shie to Christ, and not a young plant, but let it lie
above earth, till you see if it bear fruit,. No want of qualifications should
binder us to come to Christ.
Unworthiness in the court of justice is a good plea, why Christ should cast
us off; but unworthiness felt, though not savingly, is as good a ground to
cast your self on Christ, as poverty, want, and weakness, in place of a
Statute, and act of Parliament to beg, though the letter of the Law forbid any
to beg.

Propos. 4. Acting and doing thou^h neither savingly, nor Libertines should not
reject this, though it be not all, but a most poor All to engage Christ.

Propos. 5. Faith is a moral condition of life eternal, and God. I never saw
a contradiction between a condition wrought by irresistible grace* and the
gift, or free grace of life eternal; for life eternal given in the law, and
Adams doing and performing by the irresistible acting and assisting of God, are
not contrary; yet the former was never merit, but grace; the latter was Legal
doing.

Propos. 6. We do receive the promise of willing and doing, Christ, and yet we
are agents, and work under Christ.

Propos. 7. Luther (for I could fill a book with citations) Calvine, and all
our Protestant Divines, are for qualifications void of merit, or promise,
before conversion, and for gracious conditions after conversion under the
Gospel. Antinomians belie Luther.

Propos. 8. Antinomians yield the preaching of the Law, and preparations before
conversion, and conditions after, and peace from signs of sanctification, etc.
yet they are to be reputed enemies to grace and holiness, and turn all
sanctification in their imaginary faith and justification, of which they are
utterly ignorant. Never Antinomian knew rightly what free justification is.

Propos. 9. Immediate resting on Christ for all we do, and

Propos. 10. Holiness idolized or trusted in, is to make Christ,

Propos. 11. God is not provoked to reprobate whom he elected from eternity,
by new sins; yet is he displeased with David's adultery so far, as to correct
him for it; and Solomon for his backsliding, with the rod of men.

Propos. 12. Works before justification please not God; but it follows not,
that God keeps not such an order, as sense of sin, though not saving, should
go before pardon and conversion; no more then because Adams sin pleased not
God, therefore it should not go before the Sons taking on our flesh. If we are
not to do, nor act any thing, before conversion, neither to hea^e, confer,
know our sinful condition, nor be humbled for sin, despair of salvation in
our selves, because these are not merits before conversion, nor can they
procure conversion to us; neither are we after conversion to believe, for
believing cannot merit righteousness^ and l^fe eternal nor are we to hear,
pray, be patient, rejoice in tr^^^lation, for not any of these can procure life
eternal to us: And why is not the doing of the one, as w^ll as the other, a
seeking righteousness in our selves?

Propos. 13. The promise of Christ's coming in the flesh, (2.) and of giving a
new heart, are absolute promises; The order of redemption and of drawi^g
sinners to Christ, not one.
the former requires no order of providence, but that sin go before
redemption: the latter requires an order of providence, not of any
Gospel-promise, or merit, in any sort; there never was, never can be merit
betw^en a mere creature and God.

Propos. 14. There is no faith, no act of Christ's coin, or of the right stamp
before justification.

Propos. 15. We are justified in Christ virtually, as in the public Head, How
many ways we are justified.
when he rose again* and was justified in the Spirit. 2. In Christ, as h^s
merits are (...) cause of our justification. 3. In Christ, apprehended by
faith, form^lly, in the Scriptures sense, in the Epistle to the Romans and
Galathians; not that faith is the formal cause, or any merit in justification,
but because it lay^s ^old on imp^ted ri^^^eo^snesse, which is the formal cause
of our justi^^ca^ion. 4. We are justified in our own sense and feeling, not by
faith (...), (because we may believe, and neither know that we b^l^eve, nor
be sensible of our justification) but as we know that we believe; whether
this knowledge result from the ligh^ of faith, or from signs, as means of our
knowledge. 5. Ju^^i^ication by way of declaration to others, is not so
infallible, as that the Scripture calls it justification, properly so named.

Object. 8. I was, sixthly, in hearing the word shined upon, by a sweet
witnessing of the Spirit: But O how I did strive against this work! I was
called upon, but I put away all promises of mercy from me; I may justly say,
The Lord saved me, whether I would or no. Sometimes I was dead, and could not
pray; sometimes so quickened, that me thought that I could have spent a whole
night in prayer to God.

Answ. 1. If the faith of the eternal love of free election was his first
conversion, no wonder he was shined upon with light. But it was not
Scripture Light, but wildfire; for the method of Christ's drawing in the
Scripture is not Enthusiasticall, up at secret election at first. There is no
doubt we put Christ away from us after conversion, Cant. 5.1. and that so
Christ saves us against our will. That the principle of saving is free grace,
2. that free will is neither free nor willing till Christ first draw us, till
he renew and work upon the will: But I fear Antinomians will have free will a
block to do nothing at all; Antinomians make the Saints blocks in all the good
they ^oe

Doctrine, That we are not bound to keep a constant course of prayer in our
Families, or privately, unless the Spirit stir us up thereunto. Saltmarsh
says, he thought he could have spent a whole night in prayer; but 1. whether
he did so or no he expresses not, lest he should contradict his Brethren
the Familists of New England, who teach, That to take delight in the service of
God, is to go a whoring from God. 2. It would be asked, Whether this sit was
on him before, or after his conversion? To say before, would seem a delusion,
or a preparation of eminency: if after conversion, its to no purpose, except to
be a mark of a converted man. And Antinomians have no stomach to Marks: nor
belongs it to the way of his conversion; which he relates. It is true, we
cannot tie the Spirit to our hours; but then all the Lords-day-worship, all
set hours at morn or at night, in private or in families, set times and hours
for the Churches praying, preaching, heating, conference, reading, were
unlawful; for we cannot stint the Spirit to a set time, nor are we tied to
time, except to the Christian Sabbath. Some may say, Its no charity to impute
Familists errors of New England to Antinomians here. Answ. Seeing Saltmarsh and
others here do openly own Antinomian Doctrine as the way of Free grace, they
are to be charged with all those, till they clear themselves, or refute those
blasphemies; which they have never done to this day.

Object. 9. I seldom desired pardon of sin, till I were fitted for mercies;
but now I see we are pardoned freely. O rest not in your own duties.

Answ. To desire pardon of sin before we be sitted for pardon, by no Divinity
is contrary to free pardon, though such desires be fruitless, as coming from
no gracious principles.

Asser. 8. To believe and take Christ because I am a needy sinner, is one
thing; and to believe, What place we give to preparations before conversion.
because I am fitted for mercy and humbled, is another thing: This latter we
disclaim. Preparations are no righteousness of ours; nor is it our Doctrine
to desire any to rest on preparations, or to make them causes, foundations, or
formalia media, formal means of faith: they hold forth the mere order and
method of graces working; not to desire pardon, but in Gods way of foregoing
humiliation, is nothing contrary, but sweetly subordinate to free pardon. And
to cure too suddenly wounds, and to honey secure and proud sinners, and sweeten
and oil a Pharisee, and to reach the Mediators blood to an unhumbled soul, is
but to turn the Gospel into a charm; and when, by Magic, you have drawn all
the blood out of the sick man's veins, then to mix his blood with sweet
poison, and cause him drink, and swell, and say you have made him healthie and
fat. Now Peter, Act. 2. poured vin^ger and wine at first on the wounds of his
hearers, when he said, Ye murdered the Lord of glory; and they were pricked
in their heart. This is the Law's work, Romans 3. to condemn and stop the
sinners mouth. And you cannot say that Peter failed in curing too suddenly;
because he preached first the Law, to wound and prick them, for that they
crucified the Lord of glory, before he preached the Gospel of belief and
Baptism. And the Lord rebuking Saul from heaven, convincing him of
persecution, casting him down to the ground, striking him blind, while he
trembled: And the Lords dealing with the Jayler was fourer work, then proposing
and pouring the Gospel oil and honey of fre^ly imputed righteousness in their
wounds at the first; and a close unbottoming them of their own righteousness.
And the Lords way of justifying Jews and Gentiles, is a Law-way, as touching
the order, Romans 3. Having proved all to be under sin, Verse. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18. he says, Verse. 19. Now we know that what things soever
the Law says, it says to them who are under the Law, that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world become guilty before God. Indeed, if they be
convinced of sin by the Spirit, and so converted, and yet under trouble of
mind, a pound of the Gospel, for one ounce weight of the Law, is fit for them.
But Antinomians err, not knowing the Scriptures, in dreaming that converted
souls are so from under the Law, that they have no more to do with the Law,
no more then Angels and glorified Saints; so as the letter of the Gospel does
not lead them, Diverse fl^s^ly tenets that Antinomians hold, contrary to walking
in Christ.
but some immediate acting of the Spirit. And that 2. there is no commandment
under the Gospel, but to believe only. That 3. mortification and new
obedience, as M. Town and others say, is but faith in Christ, and not
abstinence from worldly lusts that war against the soul. 4. That the Gosp^l
commands nothing, but persuades rather, that we may be Libertines and serve
the flesh, and believe, and be saved. 5. That God has made no covenant with us
under the Gospel; the Gospel is all promise, that we shall be carried as mere
patients to heaven, in a chariot of love. 6. That the way is not strait and
narrow, but Christ has done all to our hands. 7. That its Legal, not
Gospel-conversion, to keep the soul so long under the Law for humiliation,
contrition and confession, and then bring them to the Gospel: whereas we
teach, that the Law purely and unmixed, without all Gospel, is not to be used
as a dyet-potion, only to purge, never to let the unconverted hear one
Gospel-promise. It is true, Peter preached not Law to Cornelius, nor Philip to
the Eunuch, nor Ananias to Paul; but these were all converted aforehand. We
think the unconverted man knows neither contrition nor confession aright. But
I was more confirmed that the way of Antinomians is for the flesh, not for the
Gospel, when I read that M. Crispe Vol. 3. Sermon. 4.160, 161, 162.
expounding Confession, 1. Joh. 1. makes it no humble acknowledging that the
sinner in person has sinned, and so is under wrath eternal, if God should
judge him; but he makes it a part of faith, by which a sinner believes and
confesses, that Christ paid for his sin, and he is pardoned in him. The
Antinomian confession of sins fleshly.
Sure Confession in Scripture is no such thing; Ezra 10.1. Neh. 9.2. In
Scripture, confession of sins is opposed to covering of sin, and not forsaking
of it, Pro. 28. Joshua sought not such a confession of Achan. James commands
not such a Confession. Daniel's, Ezra's, Peter's confession were some other
thing. Joh. 1.20. Act. 19.18. Heb. 11.13. Pro. 28.13. 1 John 4.2. Mar. 3.6.
Josh. 7.19. Dan. 9.4. Romans 10.10. 1 Timothy 6.13. Psalm. 32.5. Jam. 5.16. Levit.
5.5. chap. 16.21. and 26.40. 2 Chronicles. 6.24. In which places, faith and
confession of sins cannot be one; nor are we justified by confession, as by
faith. But these men have learned to pervert the Scriptures.

Asser. 9. There be more vehement stirrings and wrestlings in a natural spirit
under the Law; Vehement stirrings of lusts go before conversion.
as the bullock is most unruly at the first yoking: and green wood casts most
smoke. Paul, Romans 7. was slain by the Law; but this makes more way for Christ:
and though it do not morally soften, and facilitate the new birth; yet it
ripeneth the out-breaking. The right use of preparations, to facilitate, not to
merit.
Preparations are penal, to subdue; not moral, to deserve or merit; nor
conditional, to engage Christ to convert, or to facilitate conversion.

Asser. 10. There be no preparations at all required before Redemption,
Redemption has no foregoing preparations, Conversion has.
1 Timothy 1.15. Romans 5.8. But there is a far other order in the working of
Conversion: Those who Saltmarsh, Free grace, cap. 51. p 184, 185.
confound the one with the other, speak ignorantly of the ways of Grace; for
though both be of mere grace, without wages or merit, yet we are mere
patients in the one, not in the other. Saltmarsh and Antinomians argue from the
one to the other, most ignorantly.

Asser. 11. That the promises of the Gospel are holden forth to sinners, Vel
specificative, vel reduplicative.
as sinners, has a two fold sense: 1. As that they be sinners, and all in a
sinful condition to whom the promises are holden forth. How the promises of
the Gospel are held forth to sinners, as sinners.
This is most true and sound. The Kingdom of grace is an Hospital and
Guest-house of sick ones, fit for the art and mercy of the Physician Christ. 2.
So as they are all immediately to believe and apply Christ and the promises, who
are sinners; and there be nothing required of sinners, but that they may all
immediately challenge interest in Christ, after their own way and order,
without humiliation, or any Law-work. In this sense, it is most false, that the
Promises are holden forth to sinners, as sinners; because then Christ should
be holden forth to all sinners, Americans, Indians, and sinners who never, by
the least rumor, heard one word of Christ. 2. Peter desires not Simon Magus to
believe that God had loved him, in Christ Jesus, with an everlasting love; nor
does the Gospel-promise offer immediately soule-rest to the hardened, and proud
sinner, wallowing in his lusts, as he is a hardened sinner; nor is the
acceptable year of the Lord proclaimed, nor beauty and the oil of joy offered
immediately to any, but to those who are weary and laden, and who mourn in
Sion, and wallow in ashes, Mat. 11.28, 29, 30. Esaias 61.1, 2, 3. Its true, to
all within the visible Church, Christ is offered without price or money; but to
be received after Christ's fashion and order, not after our order; that is,
after the soul is under selfe-despaire of salvation, and in the sinners
month, when he has been with child of hell. How we cannot too soon come to
Christ, and yet we must not come presumptuously.
I grant, in regard of time, sinners cannot come too soon to Christ, nor too
early to Wisdom; but in regard of order, many come too soon, and unprepared.
Simon Magus too soon believed. Saltmarsh says, He mis-beleeved too soon; for
he falsely believed: none can believe too soon. Answ. To believe too soon, is to
mis-beleeve; and Saltmarsh and Antinomians teach us the method of
false-beleeving, when they teach us too soon to believe; that is, to believe
that God has loved you (be ye what ye will, Simon Magus, Judas, or others)
with an everlasting love; for that is the Antinomian Faith. Simon Magus is
without any foregoing humiliation, or sense of sin, or selfe-despaire, to
believe he was no less written in the Lambs book of life from eternity, then
Peter; and this he cannot believe soon enough. I say, neither soon or late
ought a reprobate to believe any such thing. A covetous man, who had great
possessions, had not yet bidden farewell to his old god Mammon, when he came
to Christ; therefore he departed sad from Christ. Another came before he had
buried his father; and some come, Luke 14.28, 29. before they advise with their
strength, and what Christ will cost them. I desire I be not mistaken: none can
be thoroughly fitted for Christ, before he come to Christ; but it is as true,
some would buy the pearl before they sell all they have, which is not the wise
Merchants part: and they err foully who argue thus, If I were not a sinner, or
if my sins were less heinous, and so I were less unworthy, I would come to
Christ and believe; but ah, I am so grievous an offender, and so unworthy, that
I cannot go. Their Antecedent is true, but the Consequence is naught and
wicked. It is true, I am sick, and good that I both say and feel that I am
sick; but, ergo, I cannot, I will not go to the Physician, that is wicked
Logic, and the contrary consequence is good: whereas the other consequence is
a seeking of righteousness in our selves. 2. Another false ground is here laid
by Libertines, That we place worth and righteousness in Preparations; or, 2.
That Preparations make us less unworthy, and less sinners. But Preparations
are not in any sort to us money nor hire; Preparations make us nothing less
sinners, and nothing less unworthy of conversion, if God would enter into
judgment with us.
we value them as dung, and sin; yet such sin, as sickness is in relation to
physic. 2. Preparations remove not one dram, or twentieth part of an ounce of
guiltiness, or sin. Christ, in practice of Free Grace, not by Law, yea not by
promise, gives grace to the thus prepared, and often he denies it also: Yea,
and there is a good hour appointed by God, when Christ comes. Other Physicians
take diseases so early as they can, lest the malice of the disease overcome
art; but Christ lets sin of purpose ripen, to the eleventh hour, often to the
twelfth hour: He knows his art can over-take and outrun seven devils, most
easily. The omnipotency of grace knows no such thing, as more or less
pardonable in sin; The Lord has a set time for ripening the sinner for
conversion.
yea of purpose to heighten grace, that sinfulness may contend with grace, and
be overcome, the Gentiles must be like corn ripe, white and yellow, ere the
sickle cut them down, and they be converted. Joh. 4.35. The boil must be ripe
ere it break; the sea full ere it turn; therefore the Lord appoints a time,
and sets a day for conversion. Tit. 3.3. We our selves were sometime (...),
mad; but the Lord has a gracious (...), when; When the kindness and man-love
of God appeared, he saved us. And, Jer. 50.4. In those days, and at that
time, says the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children
of Judah, going and weeping, they shall seek the Lord. Zech. 12.11. And in that
day, there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of
Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. Its good to lie and wait at the door
and posts of Wisdoms house, and to lie and attend Christ's tide, it may come in
an hour that you would never have believed. O what depth of mercy, when for
natural, or no saving-one-waiting, or upon a poor venture, What if I go to
Christ, I can have no less then I have? beside any gracious intention the Lord
saves, and the wind not looked for turns fair for a sea-voyage to heaven, in
the Lords time.

Asser. 12. The ground moving Christ to renew his love in drawing a fallen
Saint out of the pit, Christ is moved by the same love to renew his drawing,
that moved him at first to draw.
is the same that from heaven shined on him at the beginning. Love is an
undevided thing; there are not two loves, or three loves in Christ, that which
begins the good work, promoves it, even the same love which Christ has taken
up to heaven with him, and there ye find it before you, when ye come thither.

the sky devides and rents it self, and then the Sun is on its way to rise;
the birds begin to sing, then the Summer is near, the voice of the Turtle is
heard, then the winter is gone; when the affections grow warm, the welbeloved
is upon a return. 3. You die for want of Christ; absence seems to be at the
highest, when hunger for a renewed drawing in the way of comforting is great,
and the sad soul, lowest, he will come at night, and sup, if he dine not. 4.
Let Christ moderate his own pace; hope quietly waits; Hope is not a shouting
and a tumultuous grace. 5. Your disposition for Christ's return, can speak
much for a renewed drawing, as when the Church finds her own pace s^ow, and
prays, draw me, we will run; then he sends ushers before to tell that he
will come. 6. Sick nights for the Lords absence in not drawing, are most
spiritual signs.

Antinomians believe, that all the promises in the Gospel, made upon
conditions, to be performed by creatures, especially free will casting in its
share to the work, smell of some grains of the Law, and of obedience for
hire, The do^bt against condina^l Gos^el-promises propounded.
and that bargaining of this kind, cannot consist with free grace. And the
doubt may seem to have strength in that our Divines argue against the Arminian
decree of election to glory, upon condion of faith and perseverance, foreseen
in the persons so chosen, because then election to glory should not be of mere
grace, Antinomians imagine that conditions of grace, must be uncons^stent with
grace.
but depend on some thing in the creature, as on a condition or motive; at
least, if not as on a cause, work, or hire. But Arminians reply, the condition
being of grace, cannot make any thing against the freedom of the grace of
election; because, so justification and glorification should not be of mere
grace; for sure, we are justified and saved upon condition of faith, freely
given us of God. The question then must be, Whether there can be any
conditional promises in the Gospel of Grace, or whether a condition performed
by us, and free grace can consist together. Antinomians say they, are contrary
as fire and water.

Hence these positions for the clearing of this considerable question.

Pos. 1. The condition that Arminians fancy to be in the Gospel, can neither
consist with the grace of election, Antinomians reject only the Arminians
conditions.
justification, calling of grace, or crowning of believers with glory; this
condition they say we hold, but they err: because it is a condition of hire,
that they have borrowed from Lawyers, such as is between man and man, ex causa
onerosa, its absolutely in the power of men to do, or not to do, and bows and
determines the Lord and his free will, absolutely to this part of the
contradiction, which the creature choseth, though contrary to the natural
inclination, and Antecedent will and decree of God, wishing, desiring, and
earnestly inclining to the obedience and salvation of the creature. Now works
of grace and infinite grace, flow from the bowels, and in-most desire of God,
nothing without laying bonds, chains, or determination on the Lords grace, or
his holy will. Could our well-doing milk out of the breasts of Christ's free
grace, or extrinsecally determine the will or acts of free-bounty; The Arminian
condition disproved.
Grace should not be grace. But without money or hire, the Lord gives his wine
and milk, Isai 55.1. Ephesians. 2.1, 2. Ezech. 16.5, 6, 7. 2 Timothy 1.9. Tit. 3.3.
(2.) Because such a condition is of work, not of grace; and so of no less
Law-debt and bargaining, then can be between man and man. And the party that
fulfilleth the condition; is 1. most free to forfeit his wages, by working, or
not working, as the hireling, or labourer, in a vineyard; yea or any Merchant
engaged to another, to perform a condition, of which he is Lord and Master, to
do or not do. 2. He is no wise necessitate nor determined any way, but as the
hire or wages do determine his will, who so works; but the wages being
absolutely in his power to gain them, or lose them, determine his will; which
cannot fall in the Almighty. 3. Such a condition performed by the creature,
puts the Creature to glory, but not in the Lord, but in himself, Romans 4.2.
Conditions absolutely in our will, which we may perform or not perform as
see^eth good to free will, loosed from al divine predetermination, were neither
in Adam before the fall, nor in elect Angels.
For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory, but not
before God. Yea, Adam before the fall, and the elect Angels, hold not life
eternal by any such free condition of obedience as is absolutely referred to
their free will, to do, or not to do; so our Divines deny against Papists,
with good warrant, the freehold of life eternal, by any title of merit. Sure,
if God determine freewill in all good and gracious acts, as I prove undeniably
from Scripture. 2. From the dominion of providence. 3. The covenant between the
Father and the Son Christ. 4. the intercession of Christ. 5. The promises of
a new heart, and perseverance. 6. Our prayers to bow the heart to walk with
God, and not to lead us into temptation. 7. The faith and confidence we have,
that God will work in the Saints to will, and to do to the end. 8. The praise
and glory of all our good works; which are due to God only, etc. If God (I
say,) determine free will to all good, even before, as after the entrance of
sin into the world, and that of Grace, (for this grace has place in
Law-obedience, in Men and Angels) then such a condition cannot consist with
Grace. For such a condition puts the creature in a state above the Creator, and
all freedom in him.

Pos. 2. Evangelike conditions wrought in the Elect, by the irresistible grace
of God, and Grace do well consist together. Joh. 5.24. Verily, Verily, I say
unto you, Evangelike conditions wrought by the irresist^ble grace of God, do
well consist with free grace.
he that hears my word, and believes in him that sent me, has everlasting
life, and shall not come into condemnation: but is passed from death to life.
Chapter 7.37. If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink. Acts 13.39. And by
him, all that believe, are justified from all things, from which ye could not
be justified, by the Law of Moses. Acts 16.30. The Jailer says to Paul and
Silas, what must I do to be saved? Verse. 31. And they said, believe on the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shall be saved, and thy household. There
is an express required of the Jailer, which he must perform, if he would be
saved. And Romans 10. look as a condition is required in the Law, Verse. 5. For
Moses describes the righteousness of the Law, that the man that does these
things, shall live by them. So believing is required as a condition of the
Gospel. Verse. 6. But the righteousness which is of Faith, etc. Ver. 9. Says,
that if thou confess with thy mouth, the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in
thine heart, that God has raised him from the dead, thou shall be saved. Romans
3.27.28.29.30. chapter 4. chapter 5. Faith is the condition of the Covenant of Grace,
and the only condition of Justification, and of the title, right, and claim
that the Elect have, through Christ to life eternal. Holy walking, as a
witness of faith, is the way to the possession of the kingdom. As Romans 2.6.
Who will render to every man according to his deeds. Verse. 7. To them who by
patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality,
eternal life. Verse. 8. To them that are contentious. -- Verse. 9. Tribulation
and anguish upon every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also
of the Gentile. Matthew. 25.34. Then shall the King say to them on his right
hand, come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world. Ver. 33. For I was hungered, and ye gave me meat: I
was thirsty, and ye gave me drink, etc. Obedience commanded in the Law and in
the Gospel, how it is the same, and how different.
And let Antinomians say, we are freed from the Law, as a rule of holy walking,
sure the Gospel and the Apostles command the very same duties in the letter of
the Gospel, that Moses commanded in the letter of the Law, as that children
obey their parents, servants their masters, that we abstain from murder,
hatred of our brother, stealing, defrauding, lying, etc. that we keep our
selves from Idols, swearing, strange gods, I do not say, that these duties,
are commanded in the same way, in the Gospel, as in the Law. For, sure we are
out of a principle of Evangelike love, to render obedience; and our obedience
now is not Legal, as commanded by Moses, in strict terms of Law, but as
perfumed, oyled, honeyed, with the Gospel-sense of remission of sins, the
tender love of God in Christ. So that we justly challenge two extreme ways,
both blasphemous as we conceive.

1. Arminians object to us, that which the Antinomians truly teach, The two
extremes of Arminians and Antinomians the former d^stroying grace, and making
the letter of the Gospel Grace, the latter, destroying the letter of the
written Gospel, and all action in the regenerat, and turning a^l commands and
Evangelike exhortations into celestial and immediate rapts of the Spirit.
to wit, that we destroy all precepts, commands, exhortations, and active
obedience in the Gospel; and render men under the Gospel, mere blocks, and
stones, which are immediately acted by the Spirit, in all obedience, and freed
from the Letter of both Law and Gospel, as from a Legal bondage. This we
utterly disclaim, and do obtest, and beseech Antinomians, as they love
Christ, and his truth, to clear themselves of this, which to us is vilde
Libertinisme. And by this Arminians turn all the Gospel, in literalem gratiam,
in a Law-Gospel, in mere golden letters, and sweet-honeyed commandments of
Law-precepts, and will have the Law possible, justification by works,
conversion by the power of free will, and moral suasion, really without the
mighty power of the Spirit and Gospel Grace, and receive the doctrine of merit,
and set heaven and hell on new Polls to be rolled about, as Globes on these two
Poles, the nilling and willing of free will, and they make grace to be sweet
words of silk and gold; on the other hand, Antinomians, do exclude words,
letter-perswasions, our actions, conditions of Grace, promises written or
preached from the Gospel; and make the Spirit, and celestial rapts, immediate
inspirations, the Gospel it self, and turn men regenerate into blocks, and
how M. Den can be both an Antinomian, and loose us from the Law, and an
Arminian, defending both universal atonement, and the resistible working of
grace, and so subject us to the Law, and to the doctrine of Merit, and make us
lords of our own faith, and conversion to God; let him and his followers see
to it. We go a middle way here, and do judge the Gospel to be an Evangelike
command, and a promising and commanding Evangel, and that the Holy Ghost
graceth us to do, and the Letter of the Gospel obliges us to do.

Pos. 3. The decree of Election to glory, may be said to be more free and
gracious in one respect, and justification, How election is of free grace, and
justification, and salvation of free grace.
and glorification, and conversion, more free in another respect, and all the
four, of mere free grace. For Election, as the cause and fountaine-grace is
the great mother, the womb, the infinite spring, the bottomless ocean of all
grace; and we say, effects are more copiously and eminently in the cause then
in themselves; as water is more in the element and fountain, then in the
streams; the tree more in the life, and sapp of life, then in the branches;
and conversion, and justification have more freedom, and more of grace, by way
of extension, because good will stays within the bowels and heart of God, in
free election, but in conversion, and justification, infinite love comes out,
and here the Lord gives us the great gift, even himself, Christ, God, the
darling, the delight, the only, only well-beloved of the Father, and he
gives Faith to lay hold on Christ, and the life of God, and all the means of
life, in which there be many divided acts of grace (to speak so) which were
all one in the womb of the election of grace.

Pos. 4. Conversion, justification, are free for election; and therefore
election is more free, but all these as they are in God, How free ^ condition
says is.
are equally free, and are one simple good will. Though Christ justify and
crown none, but such as are quallified with the grace of believing, yet
believing is a condition that removes nothing of the freedom of grace. 1.
Because it works nothing in the bowels of mercy, and the free grace of God;
as a motive, cause, or moving condition, that does extract acts of grace out of
God, only we may conceive this order, that Grace of electing to glory stirs
another wheel, (to speak so) of free love to give Faith, effectual calling,
justification, and eternal glory. 2. Its no hire, nor work at all, nor does it
justify, as a work, but only lay hold on the Lord our righteousness.

Object. There is more of God in election to glory then in giving of Faith, or
at least of Christ's righteousness, and eternal glory; therefore there must be
more grace in the one, then in the other. The Antecedent is thus proved;
because God simply, and absolutely, may choose to glory Moses, Peter, or not
choose them to glory, and here is liberty of contradiction, and freedom, in the
highest degree: but having once chosen Moses and Peter to glory; if they
believe, the Lord cannot but justify them, and crown them with glory; because
his promise and decree does remove this liberty of contradiction, so as God
cannot choose, but justify and glorify these that believe, both in regard of
his immutable nature, who cannot repeal, what he has once decreed, and of his
fidelity, in that he cannot but stand to his own word, and promise, in
justifying and saving the ungodly that believe. Again, in election to glory,
there is nothing of men, but all is pure free grace, no condition, no merit, no
faith, no works required in the party chosen to glory; but in the justified
there is more of man, ere he can be justified and saved, he must hear,
consider, be humbled, know the need he has of a Savior, and believe, and
without these he cannot be justified.

Answ. 1. I deny, that Liberty of contradiction belongs to the essence and
nature of liberty. The nature of liberty, not in a liberty of contradiction
but in other ^hree things.
Its enough to make liberty, that 1. It proceeds not from a principle
determined by nature, to one kind of action, so the Sun is not free to give
light. 2. That the principle be free of all foreign force, the malefactor
goes not freely to the place of execution, when hailed to it. 3. That it
proceed from deliberation, reason, election, and wisdom, seeing no essential
connection, or necessary, or natural relation, between the action, and the end
thereof of themselves, but such as may be dispensed with; if these three be,
though there be a necessity, in some respect, from a free decree, and a free
promise, though there be not liberty of contradiction, simply to do, or not
to do, yet is not any degree, of the essence of liberty removed. I well
remember, Dr. Jackson, denying all decrees in God, that sets the Almighty to
one side of the contradiction, resembles God to the Pope, whose wisdom he
commends in that the Popes decrees, grants, laws, promises, are fast and
loose, and all made with a reserve of after-wit, so as if the morrowes
illumination be better, The Lords decrees and promises d^minish nothing of his
liberty and freedom of grace in his working.
then the days; whiles his life breaths in, and out, he may change and
retract his will; so says he, Papa nunquam sibi ligat manus, the Pope ties all
the world to himself by oaths, laws, promises; but that lawless beast is
tied to none. Now the Scripture teaches us, that the decrees and counsels of
God are surer, then mountains of brass and unchangeable, and that his promise
cannot fail. But who dare say, when he executes his decrees, and fulfilleth
his promise, that he forfeiteth or loses one inch, degree, or part of his
essential liberty, God should then be less free to create the world, then
if we suppose he had never decreed to create it, and yet does create it; as if
the Lords free decree lavished away, and should drink up, and waste any part
of his natural freedom in his actions: or as if his faithfulness to make
good what he promised, should render him lame, and dismember him of the
fullness and freedom of his grace, and so the more faithful and true, the
less gracious; and the more unchangeable in his counsels; the more fettered
and chained, and the less free in all these actions, that he does according to
the counsel of his will. A gross mis-conception: and I deny, that God is
less free in the justifying, and crowning the believer, then in electing, and
choosing him both to glory, and to faith. It may be men's decrees, and promises
that are rash, and may be at the second, or third edition, like their books,
corrected by a newborn wit, or because they aim at under-board-dealing,
diminsh of their liberty; but its not so in the Almighty. When the Lord by a
promise to men, makes himself debtor to his creature, and that of free grace,
with one and the same infinite freedom of grace, he contracteth the debt, and
pays the sum; for so the freedom of infinite grace, should ebb and slow,
as the Seas, and ascend and descend as the Sun; which I cannot conceive; the
effects of free grace I grant; being created and finite things in men, are more
or less according to the free dispensation of God.

Answ. 2. Its no marvel, that there be more of men in justification and
glorification, that are transient acts passing out of the creature, then in
election to glory, that is an immanent and eternal act; and so I grant
Justification to be more conditionate, then Election: but if more gracious;
that is the question: for the condition of Grace, is a thing of free grace;
indeed, we argue against the Arminian election that hangs upon a condition of
Free-wils carving, such as their faith is, and their perseverance; and from
thence we conclude, from such a condition, their election to glory cannot be
of free grace, but in him that wills and runs: because man's will
determining Gods will to choose this man to glory, not this man, is a running
will, and a mad, and a proud will, that will sit above Grace.

Pos. 4. Though it be true, that Grace is essentially in God, and in us by
participation; Grace properly, though not originally, in Saints.
yet is it false, that grace is not properly in us, but that Faith, Hope,
Repentance, and the like, that are in us, are gifts, not graces. For grace in
us may be called a gift, in that it is freely given us; as a fruit of the grace
and favor of election, and free redemption, which indeed is the only saving
fountaine-grace of God, but if grace be taken for a saving qualification, and a
supernatural act, work, or quality, given freely of the Father through
Christ, upon Gods gracious intention, to cause us freely believe, repent, love
Christ, rejoice in the hope of glory, work out our salvation in fear and
trembling: so Grace is not only in Christ, but in us properly, though
Antinomians hold all saving grace to be properly in Christ, and that there is
nothing inherent in a believer, that differenceth him from hypocrites, all the
difference must be in Christ (say they.) 1. The word says, there was another
Spirit in Caleb and Joshua, then was in the rest of the Spies; Ergo, there was
some distinguishing saving grace in them. 2 John 1.16. And of his fullness we
have all received, and grace for grace. When he ascended to heaven, he sent
down the holy Ghost, Joh. 14.17. He dwells in you, and shall abide in you.
Joh. 16.13. He will guide you in all truth -- he will show you things to come.
So there is a Spirit of grace powered on the Family of David. Zach. 12.10. On
the thirsty ground, Esai 44.3. A new heart, put in the midst of the covenanted
people. Ezech. 36.26. Fear of God put in their hearts. Jer. 32.40. Jer. 31.33.
1 John 3.9. 3. There is Grace in the Saints, that denominates them gracious. 1
Cor. 15.10. By the grace of God, I am that I am. Galat. 2.20. I am crucified
with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me, etc.

Use.
There is a great deceitfulness in our heart, in the matter of performed
conditions, Our abusing of gracious Gospel conditions.
so soon as we have performed a condition, though wrought in us by mere
grace, we hold out our hand, and cry, pay me, Lord, my wages, for I have done
my work; so near of kin to our corrupt hearts, is the conceit of merit.

2. A second deceit is, when an obligation of obedience presses us, we
overlooke the condition, and fix our eyes on the promise, when we should eye
the precept; and when it comes to the reward, when we should most look to
the promise of free grace, then we eye the precept, and challenge debt, and
forget grace.

3. When we are pressed with the supernatural duty of believing, and should
look only to free grace, which only must enable us to that high work of
believing, we look to our selves, and complain; oh, I am not weary and
laden, and therefore not qualified for Christ, and so we turn wickedly, and
proudly wise, to shift our selves of Christ; when we should look to our
selves, we look away from our selves, to a promise of our wages, but our bad
deservings, if looked to, would turn our eyes on our abominations, that we
might eye free grace, and when we should eye free grace, we look to our
sinful unfitness to believe, and come to Christ.

Use If God bestow saving-grace freely on us, without hire and price, The Lords
Method both after and before we be delivered from temporal afflictions.
then temporal deliverances may be bestowed on the Church, when they are not
yet humbled. Its true, 1. The people of God are low, and their strength is gone
before the Lord delivers, Deuteronomy. 32.36. (2.) He delivers his people when
then they are humbled, Levit. 26.41, 42. But, 3. God keeps not always this
method; nor is it like he will observe it with Scotland and England, first to
humble, and then deliver; but contrarily he first delivers, and then humbles.
As Ezekiel. 20.42. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you
unto the land of Israel, unto the country, for the which I lifted up mine
hand, to give it to your fathers. Verse. 43. And there, in that place, (...)
when ye are delivered, ye shall remember your ways, and all your doings,
wherein ye have been defiled, and ye shall loath your selves in your own
sight, for all your evils, that ye have committed. Ezekiel. 36.33. And I will
sanctify my great Name, which was profaned among the heathen, God delivers
his Church out of external afflictions before they be hu^b^ed.
which ye have profaned in the midst of the heathen. (Then they were not
humbled before they were delivered;) Verse. 24. For I will take you from among
the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and bring you unto your own
land. So when the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, were they humbled? nay,
their murmuring against Moses and Aaron, Exodus 5.20, 21, 22. testifies their
pride: and in that miraculous deliverance, and greatest danger, when they were
between Satan and the deep sea, they were not humbled, but, Psalm. 106.7. They
provoked him at the sea, even at the red sea. Exodus 14.11, 12. The Lord must
also now first deliver us, and shame and confound us in Scotland with mercy,
and so humble us; for mercy has more strength to melt hearts of iron and
brass, then the furnace of fire has, or a sea of blood, or a destroying
pestilence.

Use The third particular Use is, We have no gracious disposition to Christ:
Free grace only, not merit, the ca^se of our conversi^^.
Every man has a fore-stall'd opinion, and a prejudice against Christ; and our
humiliation before conversion should humble us. The merit of decency, devised
of late by Jesuits; of congruity, formed of old; or of condignity, to buy
grace or glory, are all but counterfeit metal. Grace, the only seed of our
salvation, is the freest thing in the world, and least tied to causes without.
1. That of two equal matches in nature, two borne brethren in one womb, the
Lord chooses one, and refuses another. 2. Of two sinners, of which one has
one devil, another has seven devils, he shows mercy upon one that has
seven devils, and forsakes the other. 3. Of two equally disposed and fitted
for conversion, though none be fitted aright, he calls one of mere grace,
and not the other. 4. Grace is so great that, Revel. 5.11. when ten thousand
times ten thousand, and thousand of thousands, are set on work to sing, Verse.
12. Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and
strength: Yea and to help them, every creature that is in heaven, and earth,
and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, cry, Blessing, and honor, and
power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb. And they have been
since the Creation upon this Song, and shall be for all eternity upon it; but
all of them for ever and ever, We have neither strength nor leisure to praise
grace to the bottom.
shall never out-sing these praises to the bottom; there is more yet, and more
yet to be said of Christ, and ever shall be. What wonder then that we have no
leisure to praise grace, being of so little strength, and being clothed with
time. Can you out-bottome the Song of Free grace? or can any soul say so much
of Christ's love, but there is a world more, and another world yet more to be
said? And when will ye end? or come to an height? I know not. O be in Graces
debt, and take the debt to eternity with you.

III.
Of the third Article. Touching the form and nature and manner of drawing: 1.
Its a question, Wherein the drawing consists.
Whether this drawing be Justification, or Sanctification? Antinomians say its
both: But withal, both is one, (say they.)

Answer.

Posit. 1. Drawing is relative to running and walking, Cant. 1.4. Now this is
rather in acts of Sanctification, and in running in the ways of Gods
commandments, Psalm. 119.32. then in Justification, though coming go for an
act of believing and approaching to Christ, Joh. 6.44. and so excludes not
faith.

Pos. 2. It is most unsound to affirm, that Justification and Regeneration are
all one; Libertines falsely t^ach, that justification and regeneration is one.
for this must confound all acts flowing from Justification, with those that
flow from Regeneration, or the infused habit of Sanctification. 1.
Justification is an indivisible act; the person is but once for all justified,
by grace. But Sanctification is a continued daily act. 2. Justification does
not grow; the sinner is either freed from the guilt of sin, and justified, or
not freed; there is not a third. But in Sanctification, we are said to grow in
grace, 2 Pet. 3.14. and advance in sanctification: nor is it ever consummate
and perfect, so long as we bear about a body of sin.

Pos. 3. To repent, to mortify sin, is not to condemn all our works, Town.
Assertion of Grace, page 115, 116. Repentance and Mortification are some other
thing then Faith.
(as M. Town says) righteousness, and judgment, and our best things in us,
and then by faith to fly to grace; nor is it to distrust our own
righteousness, and embrace Christ's in the promise. 1. Because this is faith;
and the Scripture says, we are justified by faith. 2. We receive Christ by
faith, Joh. 1.12. (3.) We receive and embrace the promise by faith, Heb.
11.11. and were persuaded of them. 4. We are to believe without staggering,
Romans 4.19. (5.) We have peace of conscience through faith, Romans 5.1. (6.) By
faith we have access into this grace, wherein we stand, Romans 5.2. And
boldness to enter into the holy of holiest, and draw near to our High Priest,
with full assurance of faith, Heb. 10.19, 20, 21, 22. Now we are not justified
by repentance and morti^ication; we neither receive Christ, nor embrace the
promises by repentance. The Apostle requires in repentance, sorrow,
carfulness to eschew sin, clearing, indignation, fear, zeal, desire,
revenge, 2 Cor. 7.10, 11. but no where does the Scripture require this as an
ingredient of repentance, that we have boldness and access, and full
assurance: nor do Antinomians admit, that by repentance we have peace, or
pardon, but this they ascribe to faith.

How far the Law draws a sinner to Christ.
A second Question is, How far the Law can draw a sinner to Christ?
Antinomians tell us of a Legal drawing and conversion, and of an Evangelike
drawing; the Legal drawing, they say, is ours; the latter theirs.

Asser. 1. The difference between the letter of the Law, and the Gospel, Both
Law and Gospel in the letter equally unable to draw a sinner to Christ.
is not in the manner of working; for the letter of either Law or Gospel, is
alike uneffectuall and fruitless to draw any to Christ. Christ preached the
Gospel to hard-hearted Pharisees, it moved them not. Moses preached the Law and
the curses thereof to the stiff-necked Jews, and they were as little humbled.
Sounds and syllables of ten hells, of twenty heavens and Gospels, without the
Spirits working, are alike fruitless. And we grant the Law is a sleepy Keeper
of a captive sinner; he may either steal away from his Keeper, or if he be
awed with his Keeper, he is not kept from any spiritual, internal breach of
the Law, nor moved thereby to sincere and spiritual walking. But the
difference between Law and Gospel, is not in the internal manner of working,
but in two other things. 1. In the matter contained in Law and Gospel: because
nature is refractory to violence, The difference between the Law and Gospel,
in the matter, not in that manner of ^o^king that Antinomians conceive.
and the Law can do nothing but curse sinners, therefore it can draw no man to
Christ. The Gospel again contains sweet and glorious promises of giving a new
heart, to the elect; of admitting to the Prince of peace, laden and
brokenhearted mourners in Sion; and in conferring on them a free imputed
righteousness; and this is in it self a taking-way; but without the
Gospel Spirit utterly ineffectuall. 2. To the Gospel there is a Spirit added,
which works as God does, with an omnipotent pull; and this Spirit does also
use the Law to prepare and humble; though this be by an higher power then goes
along with the Law, as the Law.

Asser. 2. The Gospel-love of Christ freeth a captive from under the Law, as a
Curser, and delivers him over to the Law, How law and love work dive^sly.
as to a Pedagogue to lead him to Christ, and as to an Instructor to rule and
lead him when he is come to Christ. Love is the immediate and nearest lord;
Law the mediate and remote lord. Love bids the man do all for Christ; the
Law now of it self, because of our sinfulness, is a bitter and sour thing;
but now the Law is dipped in Christ's Gospel-love, and is sugared and honeyed,
and evangelized with Free grace, and receives a new form from Christ, and is
become sweeter then the honey and the honey-combe, to draw and persuade: and
all the Law is made a new Commandment of love, and a Gospel-yoak, sweet and
easy; but still the Law obliges justified men to obedience, not only for the
matter of it, but for the supreme authority of the Lawgiver; now Christ, who
came to fulfill, not to dissolve the Law, does not remove this authority, but
adds a new bond of obligation, from the tie of Redemption in Jesus Christ,
and we are freed from the curse of the Law. 2. The rigid exaction of obedience,
every way perfect. 3. The seeking of life and justification by the Law.

Asser. 3. There be two things in the Law. A power to command, and a power to
pun^sh, are two d^fferent powers.
1. The authority and power to command, direct, and regulate the creature to an
end, in acts of righteousness and holiness. 2. A secondary authority, to
punish eternally the breakers of the Law, and to reward those that obey. These
are two different things; suppose Adam had never sinned, the Law had been the
Law; and suppose Adam had never obeyed, the Law also should have been the Law,
and in the former case, there should have been no punishment, in the latter no
reward. Antinomians confound these two. Mr. Town says, It cannot be said,
that my spirit does that voluntarily, Page 137.
which the command of the Law binds and forces unto. It is one thing for a
man at his own free lyberty to keep the Kings high way of the Law; and
another to keep it by pales and ditches, that he cannot without danger go out
of it. It cannot be denied, but that the Gospel both charge or aweth us to
believe in Christ, and to bring forth good fruits, worthy of Christ, except we
would be hewn down, and cast into the fire; and also that Grace works
Faith, and to will, and to do; and so voluntary obedience and obligation of a
command, may as well consist, as bearing Christ's yoke, and soule-rest; yea, and
delight, and joy unspeakable, and glorious, may be and are in one regenerate
person. Crisp and his followers are far wide, for Christ dyed freely, out of
extreme love, and yet he dyed out of a command laid on him, to lay down his
life for his sheep, though no penal power was above Christ's head, to punish
him if he should not dye, Joh. 10.18. Nor was there need of any power to force
him sub pena, or to awe him, if he should not obey; so do Angels, with wings
of most exact willingness, obey God, yet are they under the authority of a
Law, and command, but yet under no compelling punishment, Psalm. 103.20.21.
Psalm. 104.4. So in the Saints love has changed the chains, not the
subjection. H^w love and law work in us now.
Love has made the Law silken cords; and whereas corrupt will was a wicked
Landlord, and lust a lawless tyrant, and the Law had a dominion over the
sinner, in regard of the curse. Now the Spirit leads the will under the same
commanding power of the Lawgiver, frees the sinner from the curse, and turns
forcing and cursing power in fetters of love; so that the Spirit draws the will
sweetly to obey the same Lord, the same law, only Christ has taken the rod
out of the Laws hand, and the rod was broken and spent on his own back. The
fewd between the Law and the sinner is not so irreconcilable, as the
Antinomians conceive, so as it cannot be removed, except the Law be destroyed,
and the sinners free will loosed from law. It stands in blessing, and
cursing; salvation, and damnation: that are effects of the Law as observed, or
violated. Now, Christ was made a curse, and condemned to die for the sinner;
all the rest of the Law remains. It is most false that M. Town says, To
justify and condemn are as proper and essential to the Law, as to command.
2. It is false that we are freed from active obedience to the Moral Law,
because Christ came under active obedience to the Moral Law; for the Law
required obedience out of love. Antinomians cannot say, that we are freed from
obedience out of love; for it is clear, Antinomians will have us obliged by
no Law to love our brother; to abstain from worldly lusts, that war against
the soul; but in so doing, we must seek to be justified by the works of the
Law. This consequence we deny. To keep one Ceremony of Moses draws a bill on
us of debt to keep all the Ceremonial Law; because now its unlawful in any
sort. But to do the duties of the Moral Law, as by Christ we are enabled,
lays no such debt on us, but testifies our thankfulness to Christ, as to our
Husband and Redeemer.

The other considerable thing here, is the way and manner of Christ's drawing.

Asser. 1. The particular exact knowledge of the Lords manner of drawing of
sinners, The particular manner of drawing is unknown to us.
may be unknown to many that are drawn. 1. In the very works of nature, the
growing of bones in the womb, is a mystery; far more the way of the Spirit,
Eccles. 11.5. Know ye the ballancing of the clouds? Job could not answer this.
And who knows how the Lord patched together a piece of red clay, and made it a
fit shape to receive an heavenly and immortal spirit? and at what window the
soul came in? God is various in his dispensation, in drawing sou^e (...), some
r^ughly, some that to their sense they can tell you day and hour they were
borne over again; others are drawn, but know not when, where, or how.
2. How God with one key of omnipotency has opened so many millions of doors
sin^e the Creation, and has drawn so many to him, must be a mystery. There be
many sundry locks, and many various turnings and throwings of the same key, and
but one key. 1. Some Christ draws by the heart, as Lydia, Matthew: Love
sweetly and softly blows up the door, and the King is within doors in the
floor of the house before they be aware. Others Christ trailes and draggeth by
violence, rather by the hair of the head, then by the heart, as the Jayler,
Act. 16. and Saul, Act. 9. who are plunged over ears in hell, and pulled above
water by the hair of the head: sure thousands do wear a crown of glory
before the throne, who were never at making of themselves away by killing
themselves, as the Jayler was. A third sort know they are drawn, but how, or
when, or the Mathematical point of time, they know not: some are full of the
Holy Ghost from the womb, as John Baptist. Ye must not cast off all, nor must
Saints say they are none of Christ's, because they cannot tell you histories and
wonders of themselves, and of their own conversion: some are drawn by
miracles, some without miracles; the word of God is the Road-way. Arminians
have no ground to deny that we are irresistibly converted, because we know
not the particular way how Omnipotency conspireth strongly, but sweetly, to win
consent, without internal violence of our will, which so wills, as it may
refuse. Joh. 9. diverse times the Jews ask the blind man, What did he to
thee, how opened he thine eyes? He gives them one sure and true Answer, One
thing I know, once I was blind, now I see. All can give this testimony, early
or late, I know I am drawn. Its good the soul can say, Christ is here, I find
him and feel him; but whether he came in at the door, or the window, or
dug a hole in the wall, I know not. All may know they were blind as well as
others, and by nature the children of wrath; as ye know Adam has had a
building in you, (though now ye be renewed in the spirit of the mind) by the
old stones and rubbish in the house, and by the stirrings of the old man: When
ye see the bones of a half dead man, and his grave, and find some warmness
of life and heat, ye know there has been life and strength in the man; so
though ye cannot tell when Christ was first formed in you, yet ye find the
bones and some warm blood, and some life-stirring of concupiscence in the old
man, though Christ have made his grave, and he be well near completely
buried, and his one foot in the grave. God has appointed a time for the coming
of the Swallow; a season when flowers shall be on the earth, and when not; an
hour when the sea shall be full tide; but there is no set day, not a
determinate and set summer known to us, when the wind shall blow up doors and
locks of the soul, and Christ shall come in. But yet they are not Christ's who
neither know how they are drawn, nor can give any proofs that they are drawn.
The Apostle says, 1 Cor. 2.12. Now we have received not the Spirit of the
world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are
freely given to us of God. The converted can say, I was such a man, 1 Timothy
1.13. (...), but I obtained mercy; or, I was all be-mercied, filled with mercy.
A confluence of mercy in conversion.
As Ezekiel. 16. (...) Thy time was a time of loves. As a constellation is not one
single star, but many; so the converted soul observes a confluence, a
bundle, an army of free loves, all in one cluster, meeting and growing upon one
stalk: As to be borne where the voice of the Turtle is heard in the land, its
free love; to hear such a Sermon, free love; that the man spoke such an
excellent word, free love; that I was not sleeping when it was spoken, free
love; that the Holy Ghost drove that word into the soul, as a nail fastened
by the Master of the assembly, it was free mercy: so that there is a meeting of
shining favors of God, in obtaining mercy; and this would be observed.

Asser. 2. There be two ordinary ways of God, in drawing sinners: one Moral,
by words; another Physical and real, Two ways of drawing sinners; Moral,
and Physical.
by strong hand. Which may be cleared thus: Fancy, led with some gilding of
apparent or seeming good, as hope of food, does allure and draw the bird to the
grin; and sometime pleasure, as a glass, and the singing of the Fowler: So is
fish drawn to nibble at the angle and lines cast out, hoping to get food. Now
this is like Moral drawing in men; and all this is but objective, working on
the fancy. But when the foot and wing of the bird is entangled with the net,
and the fish has swallowed down the bait, and an instrument of death under it,
now the Fowler draws the bird, and the Fisher the fish, a far other way,
even by real violence. The Physician makes the sick child thirsty, then
allures him to drink physic, under the notion of drink to quench his thirst:
this is moral drawing of the child by wiles. But when the child has drunk,
the drink works not by wiles, or morally, but naturally, without freedom, and
whether the child will or no, it purges head and stomach.

That there is a Moral working by the word, in the drawing of sinners to
Christ, though most evident, yet must be proved against Antinomians and
Enthusiasts, who Rise, ^eign, etc. er. 9. page 2.
write, That the whole letter of the Scripture holds forth a covenant of works.
And, Er. 39. page 8,
The due search and knowledge of the holy Scripture, is not a safe and sure way
of searching and finding Christ. And, Er. 40. page 8.
There is a testimony of the Spirit, and voice unto the soul, merely
immediate, without any respect unto, or concurrence with the word. And, Francis
Cornwell, A Conference of M. Cotton at Boston, with the Elders of New England.
Page 17, 18. Libertines deny all moral working of the word.
Such a faith as is wrought by a practical Syllogism, or the word of God, is
but an humane faith; because the conclusion follows but from the strength of
reasonings, or reason, not from the power of God, by which alone divine things
are wrought; Ephesians. 1.19, 20. Col. 2.20. and that because such a faith wrought
by the word, the works (of sanctification in the regenerate) and light of a
renewed conscience, are all done by things that are created blessings and
gifts; and these cannot produce that which is only produced by an Almighty
power. For the word of it self without the Spirit, (yet the word is more then
works of sanctification) is but a dead letter; but that God works faith by the
word, his own Spirit concurring, is clear.

Thus says the Lord. That there is a moral working of the wor^.
Ergo, You must believe it. And one more and greater then all the Prophets, But
I say, so Christ God equal with the Father speaks.

2. Romans 10.17. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by Verse 14. How shall
they believe in him of whom they have not heard? Its true, the word, the works
of God, are not the principal object of faith, nor objectum quod; faith rests
only on God, and the Lord Jesus, Joh. 14.1. 1 These. 1.8. Your faith toward
God. 1 Pet. 1.21. Deuteronomy. 1.32. Joh. 3.12. Genesis 15.6. Dan. 6.23. Romans 4.3. Gal.
2.16. 2 Timothy 1.12. The word, promises, and Prophets and Apostles, are all
creatures, and but media fidei, the means of saving faith: they are objectum
quo, Joh. 5.46. Psalm. 106.12. Exodus 4.8. Psalm. 78.7. of themselves they are
dead letters, and dead things, and cannot without the Spirit produce faith:
Yea, all habits of grace, of faith, of love, in us, are like the streams of a
fountain that would dry up of themselves, if the spring did not, with a sort
of eternity, furnish them new supply; so would habits of grace, being but
created things, wither in us, if they were not supplied from the Fountain
Christ. And all beings created, in comparison of the first Being, are nothing;
and all nations to him are less then nothing, and vanity, Isai. 40.17. and so
are the infused habits of grace nothing. If this were the meaning of Familists
and Antinomians, who say that there is in us no inherent grace, but that grace
is only in Christ, we should not contend with them. We teach no such thing,
as that Reasonings, Syllogismes, or the Scriptures, without the Spirit can
produce Faith, yet is it vain arguing, to say rain, and dew, the
Summer-Sunne, good soil cannot bring forth roses, flowers, vines, corns;
because sure, it is a work of Omnipotency, that produces all these; and so
its vain to say, that because Faith is the work of the omnipotency of Grace.
therefore Faith comes not by hearing, and reasoning from Scripture: the
contrary whereof is evident in Christ's proving of the resurrection, by
consequence from Scripture, Mat. 22.31, 32. Luke 20.37.^8. Nor can any say,
Christ may make discourses from Scripture, and his reasonings, because he is
the King of the Church, are valid, and may produce faith, but we cannot do the
like, nor are our reasonings, Scriptures; for Christ r^buketh the Saduces, Ye
err not knowing the Scriptures, etc. because they believed not the
consequences of Scripture as Scripture, and made not the like discourse, for
the building of themselves in the faith.

3. The searching of the Scriptures is life eternal, the only Christ. Joh.
5.39. Acts 10.43. Romans 3.21. Esai 8.20.

4. Genesis 9.27. God shall persuade Japhet (by the Scriptures and he shall dwell
in the tents of Shem, Acts 16.14. Gods opening of the heart, and Lydia's
hearing and attending to the word that Paul spoke, go together.

5. The way of Enthusiasts, in rejecting both Law and Gospel, word of God,
Inspirations without Scripture, vain.
is because there is no light in them. Some immediate sense of God, and working
of the holy Ghost, on the soul of the child of God, witnessing to me in
particular, that I am the child of God, I deny not, and that my name expressly
is not in Scripture, is as true; but this testimony excludes not the
Scripture, as if the searching thereof were as they blasphemously say, 1.
Enthusiasme, excludes the only revealed rule, Some Prophetical impulsions
have been in many of our first Reformers and others that succeeded them but
these are not ordinary rules of rejecting Scriptures.
by which we try the Spirits, and we are forbidden to presume above that which
is written, 1 Cor. 4.16. and Enthusiasts have acted murders, and much
wickedness under this notion of inspirations of the Spirit. 2. Because if the
matter of that which is revealed, be not according to the written Word; Now
after the Scriptrue is signed by Christ's own hand, Revel. 22.18. I see not
what we are to believe of these inspirations. What extraordinary impulsions,
and prophetical instincts have been in holy men, and such as God has raised
to reform his Churches, can be no rule to us. 3. If there be any mark of
Scripturall Christ. For Christ is the most rational object that is, Christ is
a rational object
he being the wisdom of God. And man is led and taken with reason. Christ is a
convincing thing, and invincibly binds reason: so the forlorn Son, before
he return to his Father, argues, Luke 15.17. My Father has bread, he gives
it to servants, and I am a starving Son; therefore I Will return to my Father;
and the wise Merchant must discourse, Matthew. 13.45, 46. Christ is a precious
pearl, all that I have in the world are but common stones and clay to him;
therefore I cast my account thus, to sell all, and to buy him. So Matthew. 9.21.
the diseased Woman has heart-Logick within her self, Sinners ar^ue ^re th^^
^ee dr^wne to Christ.
if a touch of the border of his garment may heal me, then I Will go to Christ;
and the unjust Steward, cast Syllogism^s, thus; I cannot work, and a lodging
in heaven I must have, and there is but one way to come by it, to make me a
friend in heaven. Yea, a fools paradise, a wedge of gold, is a strong reason.
Prove. 7.21. The Whore forced the young man with gilded words and the outside
of reason. Faith is the deepest and soundest understanding, the gold, the
flower of reason. Christ can make me a King, therefore I Will be drawn to him.
Poor Adam outwitted himself, turned distracted, he studied an aple, so while
he studied all his postrity out of their wits, and now we are borne (...),
mad fools, Tit 3.3. What is the Gospel? but a mass, a Sea, a world of fair,
and precious truths, that says, come borne-Idiots to wisdom, and be made
eternal Kings: this is good reason. For the other way of drawing, we shall
speak of it here-after.

Asser. 3. In words and oratory there is no power, to make the blind see, and
the dead live. Will ye preach heaven, and Christ seven times, and let Angels
preach above a dead man's grave, Ye do just nothing. But Christ's word is more
then a word. Joh. 4.10. Jesus said, if thou knew that gift of God, and who
it is that says unto thee, give me drink, thou would have asked of him,
and he would have given thee living water. Psalm. 119.33. Teach me, O Lord,
the way of thy statutes, and I shall keep it unto the end. Psalm* 9.10. Those
that know thy name, will put their trust in thee. Christ said, but, Follow me,
to Matthew. And I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, live. Ezech. 16.6.
One word live, is with child of omnipotency; Majesty, and heaven, and glory
lie in the womb of one world, when Christ speaks as Christ, he speaks pounds
and talent-weights, Luke 24.32. The Disciples going to Emans, say one to
another; did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the
way, The oratory of Christ is effectual.
and while he opened to us the Scriptures? There be co^es of fire, and
firebrarnds in Christ's words. Christ is quick of understanding, to know what
word is the fittest key, to shoot the iron bar that keeps the heart closed;
he opens seal^s on the heart with authority, violence may break up sealed
letters, but it may be unjustly done; but authority can open Kings seals
justly. Christ not only teaches how to love, or modum rei, but he teaches
Love it self, he draws a lump of love out of his own heart, and casts it in
the sinners heart; the Spirit persuades God, Gal. 1.10. then he must persuade
Christ, and persuade heaven, this is more then to speak persuasive words of
God and Christ, it is to cast Christ in at the ear, and in the bottom of the
heart, with words. Men open things that they may be plain to the
understanding, Christ opens the faculty it self to understand. The Sun gives
light, but cannot create eyes to see, Christ can whole the broken optic
nerves. He creates both the Sun, and ties a knot upon the broken eye-strings,
that the blind man sees bravely.

Asser. 4. Christ's m^ver (...) ^s thr^ugh love.
One general is unseparable from Christ's drawing, that for the manner of
drawing, he does it out of mere free Love. The principle of drawing on Christ's
part, is great love. Ephesians. 2.4. God rich in mercy, for his great love, (...).
Wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sin quickened us in Christ.
Tit. 3.4. Christ's love (...), is 1. V^ol^^t. 2. (...) 4. Re^ll. 5 Lov^ly. (...).
But when the b^unty, and man-love, or rather, the man-kindnesse of God our
Savior appeared, he saved us. Thanks to the birth of love, and of felt love
Col. 1.12, 13. Giving thanks to the Father (...) who has delivered, who has
snatched us with haste and violence, from the power of darkness, and has
translated us to the kingdom of the Son of his love. ^. This love has in
regard of his fervor, much haste, and loses no time, Christ's love sp^edy and
swift a^ a Roe.
but comes and draws, and pulls the sinner out of hell, before he be past
recovery, and cold dead; as a Father seeing his child fall in the water, and
wrestling with the proud floods, he runs, ere he be dead, out of hand to pull
him out. Luke 15.10. The Father ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him. The
Fathers running says, that the love of Christ has need of haste to prevent a
sinner, and that he is eager and hot in his love; when Christ runs to save,
he would gladly save; he draws with good will, when he runs and sweats to
come in the nick of due time to save: So Cant. 2.8. when he comes to save his
Church, or comfort her in her faintings, loves pace is swift, like the running
of a Roe or a young Heart. Behold he comes leaping upon the mountains, In
drawing there is l^ss^ will then in leading.
skipping on the hills. And it is an expression of the extreme desire that
Christ has of an union with us, and how feign he would have the company of
sinners: So we difference between inviting or calling; yea, or leading and
drawing in calling and leading; Christ leaves more to our will, whether we
will come or refuse, but in drawing there is more of violence, less of will.

3. In drawing there is love-sicknesse, and lovely pain (...) Christ cannot
obtain and win the consent and good-liking of the sinner to his love, he
ravisheth, and with strong hand draws the sinner to himself, when invitations
do not the business, and he knocks, and we will not open, Christ dr^wes,
powerfully, compassionatly, patiently.
then a more powerful work must follow. Cant. 5.4. My beloved put in his hand
by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. Christ drives such
as will not his bowels are moved for Ephraim, Jer. 31. he draws while his
arms bleed. 3. And he stands and knocks, Revel. 3.20. His standing, notes his
importunity of mercy, how gladly he would be in, and he uses this as an
argument to moove his Spouse, out of humanity, to pity him, and give him one
nights lodging in the soul, Cant. 5.2. Open to me, my sister, my love, my
dove, my undefiled. Why, I stand long, I wait on in patience, forcing my love
on you. For my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the
night. Every word is love, Open, open my sister, I am a brother, not a
stranger; open my love, for I have interest in thee, every word is a talent
weight of free grace.

4. Not only is drawing an expression of his love of union into the Kingdom
of his dear Son, Col. 1.13. And the little lambs that have no legs of
their own, Christ shall be legs to them. Esai 40.11. He shall gather the
little lambs (and so the Hebrew) with his arm, and carry them in his bosom.
I should wish no higher happiness out of heaven, then to be carried in the
circle of Christ's arms, and to lie with the lambs, in his bosom, and be
warmed with the heart-love, that comes out of his breast. (...) is to carry on
the shoulders; and Aaron is said in the same word, Exodus 28. to carry the names
of the children of Israel on his breast, as a man is said to carry his child in
his arms, Deuteronomy. 1.31. And Christ, Luke 15.5. finding the lost sheep, lays it
on his shoulders, rejoicing. Legs I have none (says the sinner) and so
cannot go to the new kingdom. What then (says Christ) I have legs and arms
both for you, to serve you. I Will bear you if ye can neither lead nor drive. A
sinner is as heavy as a mountain of iron, and cannot be drawn or borne, but
they be heavy lumps of hell that Christ cannot bear to heaven. Christ's love
has mighty arms, and great and strong bones. Christ now above five thousand
years has been carrying tired lambs up to heaven, in ones and twoes, and is
not yet wearied, of bringing up his many children to glory, and will not rest
till there be not one lamb of all the flock out of that great and capacious
fold; and drawn they must be, whom Christ's love draws. Christ's love is not
so loose in griping as to miss any he intends to put in his bosom.

5. The particular way of loves drawing is lovely and sweetly, and with strong
allurements. Redemption and drawing by free love sweeter, then by strict law.


1 Redemption is a sweet word to a captive, but Redemption by Law is not so
sweet, as Redemption by Love. For Redemption is nothing comparable to
Redemption dipped and watered with free love, I ought no more to be Redeemed,
then the damed Devils, Christ is not my debtor, he owes me nothing, but
eternal vengeance^; nevertheless, he out of only strong love, Redeemed me. O
this is two Redemptions.

2. Drawing by free and strong love is an easy work, and Drawi^g strong and
easy: (...) consenti^g to be draw^, and there, an end.
because all works of love are easy, as the act of marrying is no great pain,
the Solemnities and Ceremonies of marriage are more toylsome th^n Marriage it
self. All the right Marriages in the world are made by love; and th^re is no
more, but I consent, I say Amen, to have Christ for my husband, and he says
Hosea 3.3. Captive woman bought for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer
of barley, and an half, thou shall be for me, and not for another, and I will
also be for thee, and there is an end. Christ's chariot runn^s on wheels of love,
and the pace is soft and sweet.

3. The way of loves working through delight is sweet, to The way of loves
working through delight, is sweet and conquering
when he comes in to the heart, his fingers drop pure myrrh. What honey, or
what heaven drops are these? Christ's honey-combe was gathered, and made out of
that flower that incomparable rose, never planted with hands, out of Christ
himself, from the bottom of eternity, from the head and root of infinite
ages, which have neither head nor bottom, and out of Christ freely loving,
freely choosing the creature to himself. Cant. 1.3. Because of the savor of thy
good ointments, thy name is as ointment powered forth, therefore do the Virgins
love thee. Cant. 5.11. Christ's head is of most fine gold. What think ye of the
golden and choice eminencies that are in Christ? of a clothing of increated
glory that goes about Christ? Cant. 2.3. I sat down under his shadow, with
great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. Christ's love casts so
sweet a smell, that his love leads not, but draws, yet loves cords are softer
then oil. The honey of Christ's love was gathered out of the flowers that grow
in that highest mountain of roses, a larger field of flowers then ten millions
of earths, and out of the fair blossoms, and sweet heavenly sop of the tree
of life; the glory of Lebanon, and excellency of Sharon, is nothing to this.
Bring all your senses, see, hear, feel, taste, and smell, what transcendent
sweetness of heaven is in this love; a Sea of love is nothing, it has a
bottom; a heaven of love is nothing, it has a brim; but infinite love has no
bounds.

4. Love draws strongly and irresistibly: Christ never wooed a soul with his
free love, but he wins the love and heart. Death and the grave and hell are
conquering things for strength, and have subdued huge multitudes, since the
Creation; but the love of Christ is stronger and more constraining, Cant. 8.6,
7. The coals of love burn more strongly then any other fire. The flames and
coals of God are mighty hot; they burnt up hell and death to ashes: how much
more will they take a sinner? Christ cast out coals of love with that word,
Matthew, follow me: and there is no resisting, he arose and followed him.
Christ's love draws till he bleed, and he loves till he die of love. His
love must prevail, for Omnipotency was in it. Had there been ten thousand
worlds more of sinners, Christ has love for them all. And had the elect world
had ten thousand millions more of rebellions then they have, all these sins
should have been infinitely below the conquering power of Christ's love. Never
sinner went to hell Victor, to ^ay, Love could not pardon me; I was in sin
above Christ's omnipotency of love. Never sinner went to heaven, but Christ's
love had the better of him. Great heaven is but an house full of millions of
vanquished captives, that Christ's love followed, and over-took, and subdued. O
loves prisoners, praise, praise the Prince of love. Sense of this love so
swells and so ascends, that the Spouse, Cant. 5.10. is not Master of words:
every word is like a mountain, if you come to his Person, Nature, Offices;
none speak like Christ, none breathe like him; Mirrhe, Aloes, and Cinnamon, all
the perfumes, Evincing and binding loveliness in Christ, in diverse respects.
all the trees of frankincense, all the powders of the Merchants, that Assyria,
or Egypt, or what Countries else ever had, are but short and poor shadows to
him: These are but hungry generals. 2. For beauty he has no match amongst
men; The virtues of Christ.
because he is fairer then all the sons of men. Christ has a most goodly
face. But of this hereafter. 3. For the sweetness and excellency of nature,
he is God equal with the Father: when ye say God; ye say all things. God is
a taking and a drawing excellency: The image of the invisible God; he that is,
he that was, and he which is to come, the Alpha and Omega, the be^inning and
the end, the first and the last, of time, of creation, of what possible
excellency we can conceive; for our conception can reach no higher then time,
and created things. 4. For greatness of Majesty. 5. For lowliness of tender
love. 6. For freeness^ of grace. 7. For glory diffused through all his
Attributes. 8. For sovereignty and absoluteness of power, etc. who is like to
our Lord Jesus? Sweet relations in Christ.
9. For sweetness and loveliness of relations; the only begotten Son of God,
no relation like this: The Creator of the ends of the earth, the Savior, the
good Shepherd, the Redeemer, the great Bishop of our souls, the Angel of the
Covenant, the head of the body the Church, and of Principalities and Powers,
the King of Ages, the Prince of peace, of the Kings of the earth; the living
Ark of heaven, the Song of Angels and glorified Saints, but they cannot outsing
him; the Joy and Glory of that land, the Flower and Crown of the Fathers
de^ights, the sweet Rose of that Garden of solace and joy. Compare other things
with Christ, and they bear no weight: cast into the balance with him Angels,
and he is Wisdom, they but wise Men; they are liars, and lighter then vanity,
and Christ is the Amen, the faithful Witness, the express Image of the
Fathers substantial glory: Cast into the scales kings, all kings, and all
their glory, he is the King of all these kings. Cast in millions of talents
weight of glory, and gain, they are but bits of paper, and chafe, weight they
have none to him. Cast in two worlds, that is nothing; add to the weight
millions of heavens of heavens, the balance cannot down, the scales are
unequal; Christ is a huge over-weight.

To all these drawing powers in Christ, in the general, because Christ is the
Master and King of the Land, where his own created kings dwell, we may add a
strong drawing argument, from the condition of the glorified in heaven; because
Christ uses this as a strong argum^nt to those that come to him, Christ's
Kingdom a drawi^g thing, in diverse considerations.
Joh. 6.37. Isai. 55.3. Joh. 5.40. Mat. 11.26. Revel. 21.6. and 22.17. we may
use it after him. The Earth is but a Potters house, that is full of
earth^n-pots and Venice-glasses, and withal taken by a Conqueror, who can make
no other use of these vessels, but break them all to sheards; it cannot be a
drawing and alluring thing. Death has conquered the earth, and these many
hundred Ages has been breaking of the clay-pots, both men and other
corruptible things, into broken chips and pieces of dust. But Christ draws,
by offering a more enduring City: That Christ can give, and promises heaven to
his followers, is a strong argument, and draws powerfully. 1. Heaven is not
one single Palace, but its a City; a Metropolis, a Mother-City, first City of
Gods Creation, for dignity and glory; Revel. 21. chap. 22. But a City is too
little; therefore its more, its a Kingdom, Luke 12.32. and 22.23. Yea but a
Kingdom may be too little; therefore its a World, Luke 20.35. It is a World,
and for eminency, a World to come; Heb. 6.5. the World of Ages. 2. The lowest
stones of it are not earth, as Gold? or dwell within walls of Gold? But under
the feet of the inhabitants there is Gold; all the streets and fields of that
Kingdom and World are, Revel. 21.21. Pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
4. Then all the inhabitants are kings, And they shall reign for ever and ever.
Whole heaven entirely and fully enjoyed by one glorified Saint, as if there
were not one but this one person alone; all and every one has the whole
Kingdom at his will, and is filled with God, as if there were no fellows
there to share with him. 5. O so broad and large as that Land is, being the
heaven of Joh. 14. and there lodges so many thousand Kings. O what fair
fields, mountains of roses and spices, gardens of length and breadth above
millions of miles are nothing; and among these, trees of Paradise; every bird
in every bush sings, Worthy is the Lamb; every bottle is filled with the new
wine of heaven: O the wines, the lillies, the roses, the precious trees that
grow in Immanuels Land! And they sweat out balm of prais^s in those
mountains. 6. If men knew what a drawing Christ himself the drawingst Lover in
heaven; and his virtues again holden forth.
the tree that bears at once twelve ^^nner of fruits, and yields her fruit
every month; an hundred harvests in one year are nothing here; and all are
but shadows, there is nothing so low as gold, as twelve manner of precious
stones, nothing so base in this high and glorious Kingdom as gardens, trees,
and the like: Comparisons are created shadows, that come not up to express
the glory of the thing. And for Christ himself, signified under this
expression, he is the most, yea the only drawing glory in heaven and earth.
1. He is the High King of all the made and crowned kings in all of all God
equal with the Father and Spirit, all one; and all the only heaven of all
heaven, and all in all, to the Saints. Then created delights there, as divided
from him, must be nothing in nothing, as he is all in all. 3. Nothing can take
the eyes and Abraham, Moses, Elias, the Prophets, the Apostles, all the
glorified Martyrs and Witnesses of Jesus Christ, especially now being clothed
with majesty and glory with Christ, must be more lovely objects then when they
were on earth, and if Christ were not there, would appear more then they do;
but the Saints have neither leisure nor heart to feed themselves with beholding
of creatures, but sure all the eyes in heaven, which are a fair and numerous
company, are upon, only, only Jesus Christ: The father has no leisure to
look over his shoulder to the son, nor the husband to the wife, in that City;
Christ takes all eyes off created things, there; its enough for Angels and Men
to study Christ for all eternity: it shall be their only labor to read
Christ, to smell Christ, to hear and see and taste Christ: All the eyes of
that numerous host of Angels and Men shall be on him; and he is worthy and
above the admiration, the thoughts Joh. 3.2. We shall then see him as he is.
What, do we not now see him as he is? No; we see him as he is in report,
and shadowed out to us in the Gospel, the Gospel is the Portraiture of the
King, which h^e sent to another Land to be seen by his Bride, but the Bride
never sees him as he is, in his best Sabbath-Robe-Royall of immediate glory,
till she be married unto him: So Kings and Queens on earth woo one another.
And, 5. In heaven Christ is (to Jesus Christ, and take them off the tree with
your own hand, is a desirable and excellent thing. The more excellent the
soil is, the wines, the apples, the pomegranates, the roses, the lillies must
be the more delicious; and the nearer the sun, the better; the more of summer,
the more of day, the more excellent the fruits of the Land are: Believe it, the
wines of that Paradise grow in a brave Land. O but Christ is a blessed soil;
roses and lillies, apples of love that are eternally summer-greene are sweet,
that grow out of him: the honey of that Land, the honey of heaven, is more then
honey; the honey of love, pure and unmixt, must be incomparable. 8. The
Mediators hand wipes the foul Joh. 14.3. Revel. 21.4. Death is cried down,
pain, sickness, crying, sadness, sorrow, are all acted and voted out of the
House, and out from all the inhabitants of the Land, for ever and ever. 9. It
must be a delightsome City that has because the Lord God gives them light,
Revel. 22.5. No danger of sunburning or summer-scorching, or winter-blasting:
all morning without twy-light, all noonday without one cloud for eternity, is
joyful: light, and day, and summer, flowing immediately Psalm. 16.10, 11. 11. O
the music of the Sanctuary, the sinlesse and well-tuned Psalms, the songs of
the high Temple, without a Temple or Ordinances as we have here, and these
exalting him that sits on the Throne for evermore. All which, with many other
considerations, are strong drawing invitations to come to Christ.

Asser. 5. Christ draws with three sorts of General Arguments, Drawing
arguments in Christ from beauty, gain, honor.
in this Moral way: The first is taken from pleasure; this is the beauty that
is in God, 1. That is in a communion with God. 2. The delectation we have in
God as love-worthy to the understanding. For the drawing beauty of God, a word:
1. Of Gods beauty. 2. Of Gods beauty in Christ. 3. Of the relative beauty of
God in Christ to Men and Angels. 1. Beauty, as we take it, is the loveliness
of face and person arising from 1. the natural well contempered color, Of the
beauty of God.
2. the due proportion of stature and members of body, 3. the integrity of
parts; as that there is nothing wanting for bodily perfection. So beauty
formally is not in God, who has not a body: Nor speak we of Christ's bodily
beauty, as Man. Then beauty, by analogy, and eminently, must be in God: So as
there be four things in the creature to make up beauty to the bodily eyes,
Four things in beauty that are by proportion in God.
and there be, by proportion, those same four things in God; for if beauty be
good, and a desirable perfection in the creature, it must be in an infinite
and eminent way in God; as the perfection of the effect, is in the cause. If
the roses, lillies, meadows be fair, he must be fairer who created them; but
in another kind. If the heavens, stars, and sun be beautiful, the lovely
Lord who made them must have their beauty in an high measure. Zech. 9.17. How
great is the Lords goodness, how great is his beauty? What then is the beauty
of God? I conceive it to be, The amenity and loveliness of his nature and all
infinite perfections, What the beauty of God is.
as this pleasantness offers it self to his own understanding, and the
understanding of men and Angels, and as bodily beauty satisfies the eyes, and
so acts on the heart to win love to beauty; so the truth of the Lords nature,
and all his Attributes offered to the understanding and mind, and drawing from
them admiration or wondering, and love is the beauty of God; David makes this
his one thing, Psalm. 27.4. That (says he) I may dwell in the house of the Lord
all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and inquire in his
Temple. See then as white and red excellently contempered makes pleasure and
delectation to the eyes, and through these windows to the mind and heart, so
there arises from the nature of God and his Attributes a sweet
intelligibility, as David desires no other life but to stand beside God, and
behold with his mind and faiths eyes, God in his Nature and Attributes, as he
reveals himself to the creature. The Queen of Sheba came a far journey to see
Solomon, because of his perfection; some common people desire to see the King;
the Lord is a fair and pleasant object to the understanding.

2. There is in beauty a due proportion of members. 1. quantity. 2. situation.
3. stature. Let a person have a most pleasant color, yet if the ears and nose
be as little as an Ant, or as big as an ordinary man's leg, he is not
beautiful. 2. If members be not right seated, if the one eye be two inches
lower in the face then the other, it mars the beauty; or if the head be in the
breast, it is a monster. Or 3. if the stature be not due, as if the person be
the stature of ten men, and too big; or the stature of an infant, or a Dove;
had he all other things for color and proportion, his beauty is no beauty, but
an error of nature, he is not as he should be, now the Lord is beautiful
because infiniteness, and sweetness of order is so spread over his nature and
Attributes, nothing can be added to him, nothing taken from him, and he is not
all mercy only, but infinitely just; were God infinitely true yet not meek and
gracious, he should not be beautiful; had he all perfections, but weak,
mortal, not omnipotent, not eternal, his beauty should be mar^ed; then one
attribute does not overtop, out-border or limit another; were he infinite in
power, but finite in mercy, the luster and amenity of God were defaced.

3. There is integrity of parts in beauty. Were a person fairer then Absalom,
and wanted a nose or an arm, the beauty should be lame. The Lord is complete
and absolutely perfect in his blessed nature, and attributes.

4. All these required in beauty, must be natural, and truly and really
there. Borrowed colors, and painting, and fair-ding of the face, as Jezabel
did, are not beauty: the Lord in all his perfections is truly that which he
seems to be. Now as there is in Roses, gardens, creatures that are fair,
something pl^^sant, that ravisheth eye and heart; so there are in God so many
fair and pleasant truths to take the mind, and God is so capatious, and so
comprehensive a truth, and so lovely, such a bottomless Sea of wonders, and to
the understanding that beholds Gods beauty, there is an amenity, goodlinesse, a
splendour, an irradiation of brightness, a loveliness, and drawing sweetness
of excellency, diffused through the Lords nature. Hence heaven is a seeing of
God face to face, Revel. 22.4. Matthew. 18.10. Now God has not a face; but the
face of a man is the most heavenly visible part in man, there is majesty and
gravitie in it, much of the art and goodlinesse of the creature is in his face.
To see Gods face, is to behold Gods blessed essence, so far as the creature
can see God. Now as we may be said to see the Suns face, when we see the
Sun, as we are able to behold it; but there is beauty, and such vehemence of
visibility in it, as it exceeds our faculty of seeing; so do we see Gods
face, when we nearly behold him, not by hearsay, but immediately. Let us
imagine that millions of Suns in the firmament, were all massed and framed in
one Sun, and that the sense of seeing that is in all men, that ever has
been, or may be, yet this Sun should far excel this faculty of seeing: so
suppose that the Lord should create an understanding faculty of man or Angels,
millions of degrees more vigorous and apprehensive, then if all the men and
Angels that are, or possibly may be created, were contemperated in one, yet
could not this understanding so see Gods transcendent and superexcellent
beauty, but there should remain unseene treasures of loveliness never seen,
yea, it involves an eternal contradiction, that the creature can see to the
bottom of the Creator.

The beauty in Chr^sts person.
All this bounty of God is holden forth to us in Christ. Psalm. 45.10. He is
fairer then the Sons of men. (...) the word is of a double form, to note a
double excellency. Cant. 1.16. Behold thou art fair my beloved, yea pleasant,
(...) signifies lovely, amiable, acceptable. The Seventy render it (...).
Psalm. 146. It is pleasant, and sweet. 2 Samuel 1.26. Thou wast very pleasant to
me. Cant. 5.10. He is white and ruddie Verse. 15. His countenance is as Lebanon,
excellent as the Cedars. Rev. 1.16. His countenance as when the Sun shines
in his (...) strength. All the beauty of God is put forth in Christ. Esai
33.17. Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty. Hebr. 1.3. Christ is the
brightness of his Fathers glory. The light of the Sun in the air is the
accidental reflection of the Suns beams; Christ is the substantial
reflection of the Fathers light and glory; for he is God equal with the
Father, and the same God.

3. This beauty to Men and Angels is an high beauty, Angels have eyes within
and without, Revel. 4.6. to behold the beauty of the Lord, and it takes up
their eyes always to behold his face; and there is no beauty of truth they
desire more to behold, (...), 1 Pet. 1.12. as to stoop down, and to look
into a dark and veiled thing, with the bowing of the head, and bending of the
neck; the Seventy use for (...), Cant. 2.9. Where Christ is said to stand
behind the wall, and look out at the casements, with great attention of mind;
It is to look down over a window, bending the head, Exodus 25.18, 19, 20. Joh.
20.5. They stooped down and saw the linen clothes. Luke 24.12. Angels are not
curious, but they must see exceeding great beauty, and wonder much at the
excellency of Christ, when they cannot get their eyes pulled off Jesus Christ.

2. There is a beauty of Christ in a communion with God, which is a ravishing
thing. When the soul comes to Christ, The beauty of a communion with Christ.
he sees a beauty of holiness, and Christ is taken with this beauty. Psalm.
110.3. So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty. Psalm. 45.11. Thou have
ravished my heart, (says Christ to his Spouse) Cant. 4.9. my sister, my
Spouse. -- Verse. 10. How fair is thy love, my Sister, my Spouse; how much
better is thy love then wine, and the smell of thine ointments then all spices.
Verse. 11. Thy lips, O my Spouse, drop as the honey-combe; honey and milk are
under thy tongue, and the smell of thy garments is as the smell of Lebanon.
Sion is the perfection of beauty, Psalm. 50.2. All this beauty and sweetness
comes from Christ, there is no such thing in the people of God, as they are
sinful men, considered in their natural condition; and therefore it must be
fountaine-beauty in him, as in the cause, and original of beauty.

2. There is a del^ct^tlon in a communion with God. This is one general,
Delectatio^ in g^dlin^sse to all the spiritual se^s^s.
Prove. 3.17. All Wisdoms ways are ways of pleasure; to the spiritual soul,
every step to heaven is a paradise.

1. What sweetness is in the sense of the love of Christ to delight all, the
spiritual senses? 1. The smell of Christ's Spicknurd, his Myrrh, Aloes, and
Cassia, his Yvorie chambers sm^ll of heaven; the ointment of his garments bring
God to the Sense. Psalm. 45.8. All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and
cassia: out of the yvorie palaces, there have they made th^e glad. Cant. 1.13.
A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall lie all night between my
breasts.

2.To the sight Christ is a delightful thing; To behold God, Christ
d^l^ghtf^ll to all the senses.
in Christ, is a changing sight. 2 Cor. 3.18. But we all with open
face-beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord, Ephesians.
1.17. Math. 16.17. 1 John 2.37. To see the King in his beauty, is a thing full
of ravishing delight. 3. It takes the third spiritual sense of hearing; the
Spouse, Christ's voice sweet.
Cant. 2.8. is so taken with the sweetness of Christ's tongue, that for joy she
can but speak broken and unperfect words. The voice of my beloved; It is not a
perfect speech, but for joy she can speak no more. Its the voice of joy and
gladness, that with the very sound can heal broken bones, Psalm. 51.8. and
which David desired to hear. O if you heard Christ speak, Cant. 5.13. His
lips are like Lilies, dropping sweet smelling Myrrh; Heavens music, the honey
of the new Land is in his tongue, the Church cheereth her soul with t^is.
Cant. 2.10. My beloved spoke, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
one, and come away. Christ's piping in the joyful Gospel-tiding, Verse. 5.
should make us dance. Matthew. 11.17. Christ harping and singing sinners, with
joyful promises out of he^l to heaven, must have a drawing sweetness to move
stones, if the sinner have ears to hear; and what heat and warmness of love
must it bring, when Christ is heard say, Esai 54.11. O thou afflicted, tossed
with tempest, and not comforted, behold I will lay thy stones with fair
colors, and lay thy foundations with Saphirs? He doubles his words, he
desires Jerusalems ears may own this cry, Esai 40.1. Comfort ye, comfort ye
my people, says the Lord, speak to the heart of Jerusalem.

4. Christ is sweet to the spiritual taste. Cant. 2.3. I sat down under his
shadow with great delight, Christ sweet to the taste.
and his fruit was sweet in my mouth. Psalm. 34.8. O taste and see that the Lord
is good. Christ is a curious banquet, the Wine, the Milk, the Honey, and the
fatted calfe killed, are all but shadows to Christ's excellent Gospel-dainties.

5. The sense of touching, which is the most spiritual, is the heavenly
feelings, sense, and experience of Gods consolations, and this sense is fed
with the kisses of Christ's mouth, Cant. 1.3. With the hid Manna, the White
stone, the new Name.

3. Joy is a drawing delight. Psalm. 16.11. In his face there is fullness of
joy. Look how far Gods face casts down from heaven, sparkles of joy on us,
as far goes our joy; and we are said in believing, 1 Pet. 1.8. to rejoice
with joy unspeakable, and glorious.

4. There is particularly delectation, Psalm. 36.8. They shall be abundantly
satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and thou shall make them drink of
the rivers of thy pleasures. Should not this draw men to Christ? And there must
be abundance of pleasures where there is a river of pleasures; as Psalm. 46.4.
There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the City of God. What a Sea of
Seas must God himself be? His full and bright face, his white throne, his
harpers and heavenly troops that surround the throne, the Lamb the heaven of
heavens it self, the tree of life eternally green, eternally adorned both at
once with soule-delighting blossoms, and laden with twelve manner of fruit
every month. Peace of conscience from the sense of reconciliation, the first
fruits of Emmanuels land, that lies beyond Time and Death; must all be above
expression. Real gain in Christ, in diverse part^^^lars.


There is a second drawing motive in Christ, and this is from gain; which is
eminently in Christ.

1. The drawn soul has bread by the covenant of grace, his yearly rent is
written in the New Testament, Christ is his rentall book and heritage. Esai
33.16. He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the munition of
Rocks; for his lodging, he shall not lie in the fields. Bread shall be given
him, his waters shall be sure; or faithful: bread and drink are unfaithful,
uncertain, and winged to natural men. 1 Timothy 6.17. Riches has an, (...), an
uncertainty, like Ghosts or Spirits that ye see, Rich^s uncertain.
but they evanish out of your sight, and disappeare; or like clouds, or
fire-lightnings in the air, that come and go suddenly; but bread is faithful
and sure to the soul drawn to Christ; when the covenanted people are so drawn,
that they receive a new heart; then God, says Ezech. 36.29. I will also save
you from all your uncleanness. What then? And I will call for the corn and
will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. Verse. 34. And the land shall be
tilled. Does the New Testament provide for the plowing of your land? No mark^t
or b^yi^g of Christ.
Yea, it does? Yea, know Wisdoms attendants and allacays. Pr^. 3.16. On her
right hand, is length of days, and on her left hand, riches and honor.
Eternity has the honor, and the right hand. Riches is the left hand blessing
of wisdom.

2. It should draw us in the own kind to Christ, in regard, Christ is more
then gain. Pro. 3.14. Wisdoms merchandise is better then silver, and her gain
then fine gold. Verse. 15. She is more precious then Rubies. (2) Job 28.1.
Wisdom cannot be gotten for gold. (3) Is there not some worth in Gold? Verse.
16. Wisdom cannot be valued with the gold of Ophyre, with the precious Onix,
with the Sapphire. Verse. 17. The Gold and the Crystal cannot equal it. (4)
May, there not be bidding and buying, and words of a market here? Nay, the
disproportion between Christ and Gold is so great, that a rational Merchant
can never speak of such a bargain. Verse. 18. No mention shall be made, of
Coral, or of Pearls, for the price of Wisdom is above Rubies. Say that
heaven and earth, and all within the bosom and circumference of heaven, and
millions of more worlds were turned into Gold, Pearl, Saphires, Rubies, and
what else ye can imagine; ye undervalue Christ, if ye speak of buying of
him.

3. Being drawn to Christ makes all yours; when ye are hungry, all the bread
of the earth is your Fathers: When ye are in a Ship, year in Christ's Fathers
waters; when ye travel in Summer, ye see your Redeemers fields, your Saviors
woods, trees, flowers, corns, cattels, birds; Yea, and all things are yours, 1
Cor. 3.21. Not in possession, but in a choiser free-holding, in free heritage,
Psalm. 37.11. Ye have the broad, rent, the fair In-come of all things. Your
land is named, All things. Revel. 21.7. He that overcomes shall inherit all
things.

4. All you have, a morsel of green herbs, a bed of straw, want, hunger,
wealth, are gilded and watered with Christ.

The third drawing thing in Christ, is Honor. The Church is a Princess

45.9. Real hon^ur in coming to Christ in diverse i^stanc^s.
Kings and Priests unto God. Revel. 1.5. Not young Kings only, but Crowned
Kings. And they had on their heads crowns of gold, Revel. 4.4. Every Saint
rules the Nations with a rod of iron. Every believer is a Catholic King, and
swaies the Scepter over all the Kingdoms of the world. (1.) In regard that his
head Christ guides all Kings, Courts, and Kingdoms; all the indirectly, and
only in ordine ad Spiritualia; but directly, and the weight of the Church
tryumphing, and the Church fighting, are upon the shoulders of our brother and
Savior. (2.) In that by faith he breaks and overcomes the world. (3.) And by
prayer, Europa, Africa, and Asia, he Christ, and shut and open heaven.

2. Consider what God makes them. To him that lays hold Esai 56.5. I will give
within my house, and my walls, a name. But what is a name? A name is but name?
A name better then the name of sons and daughters, even an everlasting name,
that shall not be cut off. An everlasting name (I confess) is more then a
name. Esai 43.4. Since thou wast precious in my sight, (...) thou have been
glorious, or honorable. 1 Chronicles. 4.9. And Jabez was more honorable then his
brethren; the same word, and way, Verse. 10. And Jabez called on the God of
Israel, saying, oh that thou would bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast.
It was said of Reuben, Genesis 49.4. Reuben thou shall not excel; (...) nor be an
overplus in praise, its to remain or abound either in quantity or quality; for
his incest deprived him of his excellency, Prove. 12.^6. The righteous is more
abundant (the same word) more honorable, glorious, or excellent then his
neighbor.

esteems highly of them. Cant. 5.2. My Sister, my Love, my Dove. The Spouse
must in Christ's heart, have an high respect, when he says, Cant. 4.1. Behold
thou art fair, my love; and that cannot content him, he adds. Behold, thou
art fair, Cant. 6.9. my dove, my undefiled is but one, she is the only one
of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The Saints in
Christ's books are jewels, Mal. 3.17. His only choice, the flower of the
earth. All the world is Christ's refuse, and King are but mortar to him; the
Saints are Christ's ass^ssors, and the Kings Peers to judge the world with him,

Cor. 6.2. Revel..21. The Lord so far honors them, as to put them on all
his secrets, Psalm. 25.4. The secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him,
Joh 14.21. I will manifest my self unto him they are of his Cabinet counsel,
Cant. 2.4. The King brought me into his house of Wine; his secrets of love, and
free grace are there.

Cant. 4.8. Com^ with me from Lebanon, my Spouse. Joh. 14.23. The Father and I

they must have, and will not be drawn to Christ, the pleasantest and fairest

Solomon) are flowers worme-eaten, and as garments torn and thread bare.

these work on their stomach, they are glad to vomit them out, and are pained

at the remembance of them; there is no drawing beauty to Christ, behold him in
all his excellencies. Cant. 5.10. My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest
among ten thousand. Verse. 11. His head is as the most fine gold, his locks
are bushie, and black as a raven. Verse. 12. His eyes are as the eyes of doves
by the rivers of water, washed with milk, and fitly set. Verse. 13. His cheeks
are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers; his lips like Lillies, dropping sweet
smelling myrrh. Verse. 14. His hands are as gold rings set with Berill; his
belly is as bright yvorie, over-laid with Saphires. Verse. 15. His legs are as
pillars of Marble, set upon sockets of fine gold, his countenance is as
Lebanon, excellent as the Cedars. Verse. 16. His mouth is most sweet; (...)
or in the abstract (...) sweetnesses, and he is all desires, all loves, and
all of him, or every piece of him is love; and when John sees him, Revel. 1. O
what a sight, Verse. 13. He was clothed with a garment down to the feet, and
girt about the paps, with a golden girdle. Uers. 14. His head and his hair
were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire.
Verse. 15. And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned into a furnace,
and his voice as the sound of many waters. Verse. 16. And he had in his right
hand seven stars. He has the Churches, and all the elect in his right hand,
and ou^ of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword, and his countenance was as
the Sun shines in his strength. When John saw him thus, he was so
over-gloried with the beauty and brightness of his Majesty, that whereas he
was wont to lean on his bosom in the days of his flesh, now he is not able
to stand, and endure one glance of his highest glory; but (says he) Ver. 17.
And when I saw him, I fell down at his feet as dead. And there was much lovely
and tender affection lapped up in this glory, when poor John fell a swouning
at his feet; Christ for all his glory, holds his head in his swoune. And he
laid his right hand on my head, saying unto me, fear not, I am the first, and
the last. I am good for swouning and dying sinners. Why, I am he that lives,
and was dead: And behold, I live for evermore. Would sinners but draw near,
and come and see this King Solomon in his chariot of love, behold his beauty,
the uncreated white and red in his counten^nce, he would draw souls to him;
there is omnipotency of love in his countenance, all that is said of him here,
are but created shadows; a^, words are short to express his nature, person,
office, lovelynesse, desirablenesse. What a broad and beautiful face must he
have, who with one smile, and one turning of his countenance, looks upon all
in heaven, and all in the earth, and casts a heaven of burning love, East, and
West, South, and North, through heaven and earth, and filles them all? Suppose
omnipotency would enlarge the globe of the world, and the heaven of heavens,
and cause it to swell to the quantity, and number of millions of millions of
worlds, and make it so huge and capacious a vessel* and fill it with so many
millions of elect Men and Angels, and then fill them, How ca^a^ious and great
Christ's lo^^ is.
and all this wide circle with love; it would no more come near to take in
Christ's lovely beauty, then a spoon can contain all the Seas; or then a child
can hide in his hand the globe of the world. Yea, suppose all the corns of
sand in all the earth and shores, all the flowers, all the herbs, and all the
leaves, all the twigs of trees in woods and forests since the creation, all
the drops of dew and rain that ever the clouds send down, all the stars in
heaven, all the lithes, joints, drops of blood, hairs, of all the elect on
earth, that are, have been, or shall be, were all rational creatures, and had
the wisdom and tongues of Angels, to speak of the loveliness, beauty,
virtues of Jesus Christ, they would in all their expressions stay, millions of
miles, on this side of Christ, and his loveliness, and beauty. It is the
wicked fleshly disposition of Libertines, who turn all the beauty, excellency,
freeness of grace in Christ, to a cloak of licentiousness, and a liberty of
all Religions; they highly under-value free grace, as any Heretics, that ever

that should be expressed in strict, precise, accurate walking with God,

or rather a presumptuous imagination, or Antinomian faith; that Christ has
obeyed, mortified the lusts of the flesh for the sinner; that no Law, no
commandment of God, no letter of the Word, obliges us to walk with God;
only an immediate Enthiasticall unwarrantable inspiration of a Spirit, without
the Word, or blasts of love when they come, and not but when they come,
ingageth believers to keep any commandment of God. Never Pelagian, Jesuit,
Arminian, were such disgraceful enemies to Jesus Christ, to free
justification, and the grace of the Gospel, as Antinomians, for they make the
Law of God and the love of God in commanding holy walking opposite; all the
doctrine of the New Testament that teaches and commands to deny
ungodliness; all the Old Testament, and particularly the 119. Psalm,
reconcileth the Law commanding to keep the Lords ways, and testimonies, and
the love of Christ, sweetning with delight and joy, holy walking, as one and
the same way of God.

hell to him; its a sweeter burden to bear the fire and coals of the love of
Christ in the heart, then the hell of envy in the soul: Nay, The sweetness of
a communion with God, far above the pleasures of sin.

chains of eternal wrath to the outermost door of heaven, and strike up a
window, and let them look in and behold the Throne, and the Lamb, and the
troops of glorified ones clothed in white, with crowns of gold on their head,
and palms in their hands showing their Kingly and victorious condition, and let
them through a window in heaven, hear the music of the new Song, the eternal
praises of the conquering King and Redeemer, they should not only be sweetened
in their pain, but convinced of their foolish choice that they hunted with
much sweating after carnal delights, and lost the fullness of joy and
pleasures that lasts for evermore in the Lords face.

Would we believe the Spies that have been visiting the new Land that Immanuel
God with us is Lord of; hear, for Moses he was in that Land, and he says,

the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency.
David was there a landed man, and what says he of that new Land that Christ

Canaan at its best is but a wilderness to it. Verse. 6. The lines are fallen

pleasures, not one only in God; My heritage is pleasant above me, above my
thoughts, or I have a goodly heritage. Solomon was a messenger who saw both
lands, and he says, Eccles. 2.13. Then I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as
far as light exceeds darkness. And the Spouse says, Cant. 1.12. When the
King sits at his table, my Spikenard sends forth the smell thereof. 13. A
bundle of Myrrh is my beloved, he shall lie all night between my breasts.
Cant. 2.4. He brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was
love. All the Song reports great things of the Kingdom of Grace. Ask of
Isaiah, What saw ye there, he answers, c. 25.6. It is a feast of fat things,
a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow. And Ezekiel says,
That there shall be a brave summer in that land. Chap. 47.12. By the river upon
the bank thereof on this side, and on that side, shall grow all trees for
meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed:
it shall bring forth new fruit according to his month, because their waters
issued out from the Sanctuary, and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the
leaf thereof for medicine; This has real truth even in the Kingdom of Grace.
And J^remiah saw the fruits of the Land, and a golden age there. Cap. 31.12.
Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Sion, and shall flow
together to the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and
for the young of the flock, and of the herd, and their soul shall be as a

that good land, can sufficienly praise this heart ravishing flour of Angels,
this heavens wonder, the spotless and infinitely beautiful Prince, the crown,

of Life, and to cast up your eyes and see a multitude without quantity of the
Apples of Glory, and to put up your hand, and not only feel, but touch, smell,

Object. 2. But discipline, and the rod, and censures of Christ's house, makes
the Church terrible as an army with banners. Christ's yoke is easy, he has
not cords and bands to cut the necks of those that follow him.

Answ. 1. Yea but this rod is a rod of love, only used that the spirit may be
saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 5.5. for the gaining of the soul,
Mat. 18.15. for building of souls. 2 Cor. 10.8. And Christ's cords are silken
and soft, and bands of love, every thread twisted out of the love of Christ.

the City of the great King. But is it so to all? Verse. 5. No: But lo, the
kings were assembled, they passed by together; they saw it, and so they
marvelled: they were troubled, and hasted away. Verse. 6. Terror took hold on
them, and pain, as a woman in travel. What cause is there here that the kings
should be afraid? They see a beautiful Princess, the daughter of a glorious
King, the joy of the whole earth; yet the Lords people works on them 1. a
wondering; 2. more, trouble of mind; 3. flying; they haste away, and cannot
behold the beauty of God in a Kings daughter: 4. terror takes hold on them, and
quaking of conscience: 5. when the Powers of the world, Princes, States,
Parliaments, see the convincing glory of another world in the Church, they part
with child for pain. It is known, some have such antipathy with a Rose, which
is a pleasant creature of God, that the smell of it has made them fall a
swooning. Jerusalem is the rebellious City, Ezr. 4.12. therefore men are
unwilling it should be built. Lusts in men's minds, either heresies, or any
other fleshly affection, is against the building of the house of God.

Use 4. A believer is a rich man, and an honorable, say he were a beggar on
the dunghill: Christ cannot be poor, and he is a fellow-heire with Christ,
Romans 8.17. We must think the father of a rich heir has bowels of iron, and
sucked a Tiger when he was young, who suffers the heir, remaining an heir,
to starve. As the natural man is but a fragment of clay, so he has a life
like an house let for money; and the rent and in-come that the house pays to
the Lord of the land, is but hungring clay, a dead rent, and some newborn
vanities of homage and service; but the promise, the Magna Charta, and the
Charter of food and raiment that is an article of the Covenant of grace, is a
full assurance that the Saints are the Noblemen Pensioners of the Prince of the
kings of the earth: And Christ has so broad a board, that he does pay all his
Pensioners. And the Saints are truly honorable, being come of the
bloud-royall, of the Princely seed, Joh. 1.13. 1 John 3.1, 9. And the Church is
a spiritual Monarchy: The Plant of renown, their Head, said of her, Isai.
62.3. Thou shall be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal
diadem in the hand of thy God.

Asser. 6. The other particular manner of drawing sinners to Christ, is real:
In which we are to consider these two. The manner of the Lords drawing the
will.


1. Gods fit application of his drawing of the will. 2. His irresistible pull
of omnipotency.
In the former way of working, I desire that notice be taken (for Doctrines
cause, rather then for Art of Logical method) of these four ways: 1. God
works by measure and proportion. 2. By condiscension. 3. By fit internal
application. 4. By external, providentiall accommodation of outward means.


1. In works of omnipotency without God, we see he keeps proportion with that
which he works upon: The Lord works by proportion in drawing the will.
When God waters the earth, he opens not all the windows of heaven, as he
did in the Deluge, to pour on mountains and valleys all his waters in one
heap; for he should then not refresh, but drown the earth: therefore he makes
the clouds like a sieve, and divides the rain in hoasts and millions of drops
of dew, that every single flower, and inch of earth may receive moistening,
according to its proportion. If the sun were as low down as the c^ouds, it
should, with heat, burn up every green herb, tree, rose, flower, and our
bodies; and if it were the highest of Planets, all vegetables on earth should
perish through extreme cold. It may be a question, though the omnipotent power
of God move the will invincibly and irresistibly, Whether Omnipotency puts
forth all its strength on the will; or, whether the will be able to bear the
swing of Omnipotency in its full strength? If the Fowler should apply all his
force and strength to catch the bird alive, he should strangle and kill it.
Divines say, that Christ's dominion in turning the will, is, Dominium forte, sed
suave; strong, but sweet and alluring: No wonder, if he carry the lambs in his
bosom, Isai. 40.11. the warmness and heat of his bosom must sweetly allure
the will* Drive a Chariot as swiftly as an Eagle flies, and ye fire and break
the wheels: Knock Crystal glasses with hammers, as if ye were cleaving wood,
and ye can make no vessels of them. This is not to deny that Gods omnipotent
power must turn the will, but to show how sweetly he leads the inclinations.

The Lord by holy wiles and art draws the will.
2. The Lord by wiles and art works upon the will: Hos. 2.14. I will allure her,
and bring her to the wilderness, and speak to her heart. The word of alluring
is (...) seductus, deceptus fuit; to be beguiled; and the Hebrew is, I will
beguile, or deceive her; The learned Gentleman M. Ed. Liegh in Critica Sacra on
the old Test. thinks, not without good reason, that the Greek word (...), to
persuade, comes from this.
as Deuteronomy* 11.26. Take heed to your selves that your heart be not deceived. So
Pethi is the simple man, that is facile and easily persuaded. Psalm. 116.6. The
Lord preserves the simple. Then he says he will speak to her heart, (...)
super, secundum, he will speak friendly to her; not according to the renewed
heart, for it was not yet renewed; not according to the corrupt and unrenewed
heart, for nothing that the Lord speaks according to sinners, is suitable, but
contrary to the renewed heart, and to internal persuading; but he speaks
all reason, according to the temper and natural frame of the heart, to
convince and persuade that there is more reason in turning to God, then that
the wit or engine of man can speak against it. Grace is pia fraus, a holy
deceit, that ere the soul be aware, it is catched: and though that be spoken
of Christ, Cant. 6.12. Ere ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots
of Amminadab; yet it has truth in this, that 1. No unconverted man intends to
be converted, till God convert him; because spiritual intention is a vital
act of the soul living to God: No living man can put forth a vital act of
life, till the Lord be pleased to give him a new life. 2. That spiritual love
alluring the soul, works by such art as cannot be resisted: Hence,
conversion and being drawn to Christ, is termed by the name of charming; The
Lords grace bewitcheth and charmeth the will.
even as turning off Christ is a bewitching, or killing with an evil eye, as
we say; Gal. 3.1. And so being drawn to God, is called a charming. And the
wicked are rebuked for this, Psalm. 58.4, 5. that being strangers to God, they
are like the deaf adder that stops her ear, and will not hearken to the
voice of Charmers, (or Singers, who sing as Witches and Inchanters do)
charming wisely. There be two words that signifie^inchanting; the former is to
(...) mussi^are, submissa voce loqui, quod occul^um velis.

2 S^m. 12 19. So Isai. 3.3. the prudent and wise man h^th such a name, as to
charm and bewitch as ^loquent Orators do, or Exorcists and Con^urers of
Spirits.

(...) conjungere, sociare, by enchanting. Deuteronomy. 18.11. Isai. 47.9.

Septuaginta. (...).


mutter with a low voice, as they do to serpents, to take and kill them: the
other is to conjoyne and associate in one, as Witches do, things most
contrary. Conversion to God, is to be allured, bewitched, overcome with the art
of heaven, that changes the heart. And the Lord made Peter and the Apostles
fishers of men. Christ lays out hooks and lines in the Gospel, Luke 5.10. to
catch men with hope, as fishes are taken. Christ so condiscendeth to work upon
the will, as with art, and unawares the will is taken, and made sick of love
for Christ, and the man intended no such thing; as sickness comes on men
beside their knowledge or intention: So Christ makes himself and heaven so
lovely, and such a proportion and similitude between the soul and his beauty,
as he app^ares most desirable, taking and alluring. Gal. 4.20. I desire to be
present among you (says Paul) and to change my voice: I desire not to speak
roughly, and with asperity, as I have written; but as a mother speaks to her
children, to allure you. The word of God is an arrow that kills afar off, and
ere ye see it. There is a great difficulty to persuade a man who is in another
element, and without the sphere of the Gospels activity; as Christ and the
natural man are in two contrary elements: There is required art for a man on
the earth, to take a bird flying in the air; or for a man in a ship, or on the
bank of the river, to catch a fish swimming in the element of the water. Christ
lays out the wit, the art, and the wiles of free grace to charm the sinner;
but the sinner stops his ear: there is need of the witchcraft of heaven to
do this. The love of Christ, and his tongue is a great Inchantresse; Ezekiel.
16.8. I said unto thee, when thou wast dying in thy blood, Live.

3. Christ knows how to apply himself internally to the will. Suppose one
were to persuade a stiff and inexorable man, Christ works on the w^ll by
internal application.
and knew what argument would win his heart, he would use that. The will is
like a great curious engine of a water-work, consisting of an hundred wheels,
of which one being moved, it moves all the ninety nine beside; because this is
the Master wheel, that stirs all the rest. Now the Lord knows how to
reach down his hand to the bottom of the elective faculty, and that wheel
being moved, without more ado, it draws all the affections, as subordinate
wheels. If the key be not so fitted in the work, wards and turnings of it, as
to remove the crosse-barre, it cannot open the door. Omnipotency of grace is
so framed and accommodated by infinite wisdom, as that it can shoot aside the
dissenting power, without any violence, and get open the door. God cannot be
the Creator of the will but he must effectually turn it whither soever he
pleases.
If free will be the workmanship of God, as we must confess, it is a
needless arguing of Arminians and Jesuits to say, that free will is
essentially a power absolutely loosed from predeterminating Providence; so as
whatever God does on the contrary, it may do, or not do; it may nill, will,
choose, refuse or suspend its action; for such a creature, so absolute, so
sovereign and independent, as he that made it cannot without violence to
nature, turn, move, bow, determine and master it in all its elective power for
his own ends, and as seems good to the Potter, for the manifestation of mercy
and justice, is to say, He that made the free will, cannot have mercy on it;
he that framed the clay-vessel, cannot use it for honor or dishonor, as he
pleases; he that molded and created the horologe, and all the pins, pieces
and parts, has not power to turn the wheels as he pleases.

4. Christ in external means accommodates himself so, in the revealing of
himself, as he thinks good.

1. In accommodating his influence with his word. 2. With externalls of
providence.
The breathings of the Holy Ghost go so along with the word, The word and the
Spirit.
as the word and the Spirit are united, as if they were one Agent; as sweet
smells are carried through the air to the nose. The word is the chariot, the
vehiculum, the horse; the Spirit the Rider. The word the arrow, the Spirit
steeleth and sharpeneth the arrow. The word the sword, the Spirit the
steel-mouth and edge that cutteth and divides asunder the soul and the
spirit, the marrow and the joints, Heb. 4.12. It is the same Christ in all his
loveliness and sweetness that is preached in the word, and conveyed to the
soul; not God or Christ as abstracted from the word, as Enthusiasts dream.
And though the Preacher add a Ministerial spirit to the word, to cause Felix
tremble; yet he is not Master of the saving and converting Spirit. Golden
words, though all Gospel, and honeyed with heaven and glory, planting and
watering, without the Spirit are nothing.

In externals of providence, God chooses, 1. Means. 2. Time. 3. Disposition.
4. Anticipation of the sinners intention. 5. Fit words.


1. In means. God appears to Moses, Means are accommodated to conversion.
acquainted with mountains, and woods, in a bush which burnt with fire; to the
Wisemen, skilled in the motions of the heaven, in a new star; to Peter a
fisher, in a draught of fishes.

2. He sets a time, and takes the sinner in his month, Time sitted of God
for conversion.
Jer. 2.24. In his time of love. Ezech. 16.8. When he is ripe, like the first
ripe in the fig tree, Hos. 9.10.

3. Often he chooses in the furnace, Hos. 5. Last verse, I will return to my
place. Hebrew, till they make defection, or be guilty; for the most part, man
is not guilty in his own eyes, while he be as Manasseh was in the briars;
the fire melting the silver portrait of a horse causes it loss the figure of
head, feet, legs, and turns all in liquid white water, and then the metal is
ready to receive a far other shape, of a man, or any other thing, the man is
ductill, and bowable, and ^npartiall, when God seals and stamps the rodd; he
is not so wedded to himself as before; it may be also, that mercies, and great
deliverances, and favors, melt the man, and bring him to some gracious
capacity to be wrought on by Christ.

4. Christ anticipates the current of the heart and intention. When Saul is on
a banquet of blood, Christ out-runnes him, God converts every man beside his
intension.
and turns him; all men are converted, contrary to their intentions, thousands
are in a channel and current of high provocations, and they are in the fury of
swelling over the banks, and Christ gets before them, to turn the current to
another channel. Christ is swift, and they are all chased men that are
converted. Sure, Matthew that morning he came to the receipt of custom, minded
nothing, but money, and his count book, and had not a forset purpose of Christ;
and because, intentions, purposes, counsels, are as it were, essential to
rational men, as men, and the refined'st acts of reason, and their noblest,
and most Angel-like works; and Christ catches sinners contrary to their
intentions; and in this sense, saves the sinner, blesses him, and gives him
Christ, and heaven, against his will, whether he will or not, that is, whether
he spiritually will or no* or whether he savingly intend his own conversion,
or not.

5. There is one golden word, (and God is in the word) one good word that is
fit, A fit word must be in conversion.
and dexterous, hic and nunc, Prove. 25.11. A word fitly spoken, Heb. a word
spoken on his wheels, is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. Sure
Christ's words to a sinner ripe for conversion, (...) a wheel
moves on wheels, that is, in such order, Prove* 20.26
as two wheels in one cart, they answer most friendly one to another in their
motion, because Christ observes due circumstances, of time, place, person,
congruency with the will and disposition; As Hos. 2.14. and Salomons Ecoles.
12.10. The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, Hebr. words of will,
or of good will; Christ was greater then Solomon, and is a higher Preacher then
he, and seeks out words to the heart, that burns the heart, Luke 24.32. Sure,
there is more of heaven, more life, and fire, in these words to Matthew, Follow
me; and to dying Jerusalem, Live; then in ordinary words, the Hebrews call
vain words. Esai 36.5. A word of lips. Prove. 14.23. (...) these be words of
wind, that are empty, and have no fruit; the words of the Lord fitted for
converting, are words of the heart, and words of power which want not the
effect, they are words fit for the heart, Esai 40.2. Hos. 2.14. Such words as
teach the heart, Esai 54.13. Joh. 6.45. there is an uncreated word suitable for
the heart, that goes along with the word spoken, and that meets with all the
byases, turnings, and contradictions of the heart, and takes the man; and no
word, but that only can do the business, there is a word that is with child
of love; a word comes from God, and its a coal from the Altar, that is
before the Lords throne, and it fires up all iron locks in the soul, that the
will must yield. The woman of Samaria, hears but these words, I am he that
talks with thee, and her will is burnt with a strong necessity of love; she
must leave her water-pot, and for joy, go and tell tidings in the City, Come
and see, I have found the Messiah. Christ makes a short preaching to Magdalen,
and in his own way says, but, Mary; and Christ himself is in that word, her
will is fettered with love. Peter makes a Sermon, Acts 2. and there be such
coals of Paradise in his words, that three thousand hearts must be captives to
Christ, and cry, what shall we do to be saved? Every key is not proportioned
to every lock, nor every word fit to open the heart.

But though Christ speak to men in the Grammar of their own heart and
calling, What congruous vocation, or the new calling and conversion of sinners,
devised by Je^uits, the Pelagians living ag^in, is.
I am far from defending the congruous vocation of Jesuits, once maintained
by Arminius, and his disciples, at the conference at Hage; but now, for shame,
forsaken by Arminians. For the Jesuits take this way; asking the Question. How
comes it to pass, that of two men equally called, and drawn to Christ, and
as they dream (but it is but a dream) affected and instructed with habitual
and prevening grace of four degrees; the one man believes, and is converted;
the other believes not, but resists the calling of God. They answer, Christ
calls, and draws the one man, when he foresees he is better disposed, and
shall obey; as his free will being in good blood, after sleep, and a good
banquet, and fitter to weigh reasons, and compare the way of godliness with
the other way: and he calls the other, though both in regard of grace and
nature, equal to him that is converted, when he foresees he is in that order
of providence, and accidental indisposition, of sadness, sleepiness, hunger,
and extrinsecall dispositions of mind, that he shall certainly resist, and
both these callings, are ordered and regulated by the two absolute decrees of
Election and Reprobation, from eternity.

The Arminians answer right down, the one is converted, because he wills, and
consents; whereas he might, The Arminian calling and conversion.
if it pleased him, dissent and refuse the calling of God; and the other is not
converted, because he will not be converted but refuses, whereas he has as
much grace as the other, and may, if he will, draw the actual co-operaton of
grace (the habitual he has equally, in as large a measure as the other) and
be converted, and believe; nor is there any cause of this disparity in the man
converted, and the man not converted in God, in his decree, in his free grace,
but in the will of the one, and the not-willing of the other.

Our Divines say, The conversion of Protestant Divines
1. There never were two men equal in all degrees, as touching the measure and
ounces of habitual saving internal grace; yea, that the never converted man
had never any such grace.

2. That the culpable and moral cause, why the one is not converted rather
then the other, is his actual resistance, and corruption of nature, never
cured by saving grace, but the adequate, Physical, and only separating cause,
is 1. The decree of free election drawing the one effectually, not the other.
2. Habitual saving grace, seconded with the Lords efficacious actual working
in the one, and the Lords denying of habitual and actual grace to the other;
not because the will of the creature casts the balance, but because the Lord
has mercy on the one, because he will, and leaves the other to his own
hardness, Romans 9.17.18.
because he will, and that the separting cause is not from the running,
willing, and sweating of the one, and the not-running, and not-willing of the
other; but from the free unhired, independent absolute grace of Christ.

But the Jesuits congruous calling we utterly reject. 1. Because this is the
Pelagian way, Reasons against the Jesuits congruous conversion of sinners
drawing one not another.
sacrilegiously robbing the grace of God, for the Lord fore-seeth this man
placed in such circumstances and course of providence will believe, the other
will not, because he will do so, and the other will not do so; and both the
placing of the one in such an opportunity, and his willing believing, and the
other man's nilling not believing is in order before the foreknowledge and far
more before the decree of God and his actual grace, and therefore free will is
the cause why the one is converted, not the other, for both had equal
habitual grace, and the one is not to give thanks for his conversion
comparatively, more then the non-converted, but to thank his own free will. 2.
The object of their fancy of their new middle science, is a foreseen
providence, of the conversion of all that are willing to be converted, and
voluntary perseverance in grace, and the non-conversion and final impenitency
of all the wicked that are willing to refuse Christ, and these two go before
the prescience, before the decrees of election and reprobation, so as God is
necessitated to choose these and no other; and to pass by these, and no other
what ever has a future being before any decree of God cannot by any decree be
altered or otherwise disposed of then it is to be: So the Lord in all things
decreed, and that come to pass contingently, The middle science fancied by
Jesuits and Arminians to be in God. Refuted.
must have nothing but an after-consent, and an after-will to approve them,
when they were now all future before his decree; this is to spoil God of all
free will, free decrees, liberty and sovereignty in his decrees, and that men's
free will may be free and Independent, to lay Gods freedom of Election and
Reprobation under the creatures feet. 3. Jesuits dream that Christ cannot
conquer the will to a free consent, except he lie in wait to catch the man when
he has been at a fat banquet after cups, has slept well, is merry, and when
he sees the man is in a good blood, then he draws and invites and so catches
the man; and when he sees the reprobate in a contrary ill blood, though he
seriously will and intend their salvation, and gave his son to die for them,
yet then he draws, when he foresees they by the dominion of free will shall
refuse, and he draws neither after, nor before, but at the time when he knows
free will is under such an ill hour, as it freely came under, without any act
of Gods providence and free decree, and in the which the called and drawn man
shall certainly spit on Christ, and resist the calling of God. But this
resolves heaven and hell, salvation and damnation, into such good or ill
humors, and orders of providence, as a banquet, no banquet, a crabbed
disposition, or a merry; whereas grace, which by an omnipotent and insuperable
power removes the stony heart, can more easily remove these humors and win the
consent, when the man is decreed for glory, and besides that all men
unconverted and in their own Element of corrupt nature are ill to speak to, and
in a sinful blood of resisting, except Christ tread upon their iron neck and
subdue it, and he spreads the skirts of his love over Jerusalem at the worst,
Ezekiel. 16.6.8. Scripture is silent of such a manner of drawing, and the grace of
Christ and his decree lies under no such hazard or lotterie, as such imaginary
dispositions o^ good humors, thousands being brought in to Christ in chains,
in saddest afflictions: Nor is grace being a plant of heaven, a flower that
grows out of such clay ground.

Asser. 7. Christ draws by such a power (and this is the last point in the
drawing) That it is not in the power of man to resist him.

1. He draws by the pull of that same arm and power by which he commanded
light to shine out of darkness, The omnipotency of Christ in drawing sinners.
2 Cor. 4.6. by which he raised the dead out of the graves, Ephesians. 1.18* 19. by
the exceeding greatness of his power, and the mighty power by which he raised
Christ from the death. Arminians answer, this was omnipotency of working
miracles, but what was it to the salvation of the Ephesians, and to the hope of
their glory to know with opened eyes such a power as Judas knew? and can the
dead choose but be quickened and come out of the grave, when God raises them,
Joh. 5.25. That Vaga necessitas, the strong moral necessity talked of by
Jesuits, when strong moral motives work, is a dream there, Did Ruiz to. de
provid. and predefinitionibus per totum.

The Vaga necessit^s, the confused, indefinite moral necessity of late devised
by Jesuits is not sufficient to conversion.

The Lord removes resisting power.


for it may come short; a man quickened in the grave and put to his feet as
Lazarus was, of necessity must come out, he will not lie down in the grave
again and kill himself. A man starving for hunger when meat is set before him
on any terms he desires, if he be in his right wits will necessarily eat, and
not kill himself, but the necessity of saving souls in the tender and loving
mind of God in Christ is much stronger, and if we consider the corruption of
will, this fancied vaging necessity cannot so bow the will, but it is necessary
that corrupt will dissent, rather then consent to Christ.

2. God takes away all resisting, and the vicious and wicked power of
resisting, he removes the stony heart, opens blind eyes, removes the vail
that is over the heart in hearing or reading the Scriptures, Ezekiel. 36.26. 2
Cor. ^.16, 17. Deuteronomy. 30.6. Col. 2.11. takes the man's sword, and armor from
him, cuts off his arms, so as he cannot fight or resist you. It is true,
Christ takes not from David, Abraham, Prophet, Apostle, or from any Men or
Angels that are to be saved the natural created power of nilling and willing,
purum (...) posse nolle, Christo trahente, but he takes away the moral
wicked, and godless power hic and nunc, and vicious and corrupt disposition of
resisting.

3. God lays bonds on himself by 1. Promise, 2. Covenant. 3, Gods promise and
covenant leads to draw iresistibly.
Oath, to circumcise the heart of his chosen ones, Deuteronomy. 30.6. to put his Law
in their inward parts, Jer. 31.32, 33. To give them one heart to fear God for
ever, not to depart from God. Jer. 32.39, 40. Heb. 8.6, 7, etc. to bless them,
Heb. 6.16, 17, 18. Genesis 22.16, 17. Psalm. 89.33, 34, 35, 36, 37. Heb. 1.5, 6. We
cannot imagine that God will keep Covenant, promise, and oath, upon a
condition, and with a reserve that we give him leave so to do; that is as much
as the Creator will be faithful, if the creature will be faithful: And there
is nothing glorious in the Gospel and second Covenant above the Law and first
Covenant, if God promise not to remove the power of resisting, for if God do
not promise to work our obedience absolutely, without any condition depending
on our free will, then must free will be so absolutely indifferent as it can
suspend God from fulfilling his oath. Now the Law had a promise of life, If ye
do this, ye live eternally, but God neither did work, nor was tied by the
tenor of that Covenant, to work in us to do, to will, to continue, to abide
in all written in the Law of God to the end, and therefore it was a broken
Covenant. Nor can Arminians make the Covenant, Gospel-promise, and oath of God
so conditional, as the Law of works, or as the promise of giving the holy Land
to the seed of Abraham upon condition of faith, because many could not enter
in, because of unbelief, except Arminians and Jesuits prove, 1. That all that
entered in to the holy Land, young and old, did believe and were elected to
salvation, redeemed and saved, as Caleb and Joshua were, as all that enter in
to the true promised Land are believers; otherwise they die, are condemned,
Conditional promis^s of conversion cannot help Arminians here.
and can never see God, John 3.18.36. v. 16. Joh. 11.26. and 5.24. Mark. 16.16.
Acts 15.11. Acts 11.17.18. but the former is most evidently false in the
History of Joshua and Judges, multitudes entered in who never believed; as
multitudes entered not in who believed, as Moses and many others. And therefore
from this, that many entered not in, because of unbelief; The Arminians shall
never prove, that as God makes a promise of life eternal, that believers
infallibly and only shall be saved, and unbeleevers excluded; so God made a
covenant and promise that all these of Abraham's seed infallibly, and all these
only should enter into the holy Land, who should believe as did Caleb and
Joshua. I put all Arminians and Papists and Patrons of universal atonement to
prove any such covenant or promise. 2. Let Arminians prove that faith and a new
heart was promised to all Abraham's seed who were to enter in t^ the holy Land,
as it is promised to all the Elect who are saved, and to enter in the Kingdom
of Heaven, Ezekiel. 36.26. Jer. 31.32, 3^. Jer. 32.39, 40. 3. That the promise of
eternal rest in heaven was typified by conversion to Christ, and conversion
upon condition of faith, as they say, but without ground; the holy Land was
promised to all Abraham's seed upon condition of Faith, the like we say to all
other conditional promises of God made in Scripture, that are as the legs of
the lame unequally paraleld with the Covenant of Grace. Because this is the
only answer Adversaries can give, though it be as a parable in a fools mouth.
Let it be considered, 1. The difference between the first Covenant which was
broken, Jer. 31, 32, 33, 34. and the better Covenant which is everlasting and
cannot be broken, The immutability of the Covenant of Grace a strong argument
for invincible dr^wing of a sinner.
Jer. 31.35, 36, 37. and 32.39, 40. Isai. 54.10, 11. Isai. 59.19, 20. Heb. 8.6,
7, etc. is expressly holden forth to make the new Covenant better then the Old;
But its close removed, for both are broken Covenants by this reasoning. 2. When
God promises the removing of an old and stony heart, and to give a new heart;
he promises to take away resisting in Apostles reason Heb. 6.13, 14, 15, 16.
of the That we might have strong consolation and hope: Now this makes
undeniably the consolation though never so strong, the hope never so sure, to
depend on our free will, if the sinner brue well, he drinks well, if he resist
not grace, as he may, or accept it as Gods free will thinks good, he is Tutor
and Lord of his own hope and consolation. Christ cannot help him to determine
his will, if so be he be a bad husband of his own nilling and willing, let him
see to

Arg. 4. Whom God predestinateth, them he also calls and glorifieth, as all
the predestined are indeclinably called and glorified, Romans 8.30. Acts 13.48.
1 Pet. 1.2. Now by this, multitudes should be predestinate, who are never
called and glorified, if they have it in their free and independent choice to
resist the drawing of Christ.

Arg. 5. God (as Augustine says) has a greater dominion over our wills, then
we have over them our selves; as he is more Master of the beings, so of the
operations, (that are created beings) then the creature is, and so he must use
the creatures operations at his own pleasure, otherwise he has made a
creature free will, which is without the Sphere of his own power; whereas the
freest will of a King the most Sovereign and Independent on earth, must run in
his channel, Pro. 21.1.

Arg. 6. Christ's Lordship and Princedome through his resurrection, is in
turning of hearts, Acts 5.31. Romans 11.23. Grace is stronger then Devils, sin,
hell and death, Romans 14.4. Ephesians. 3.20. Jude 24.1. John 2.14. 1 John 4.4,

Arg. 7. If it must lie at our door more then Christ's to apply the purchased
Redemption, and actually to be saved, then we share more, if not large, equally
with Christ, in the work of our salvation; nor can the Church pray, Draw me, we
shall run; why should we pray for that which is in our own power, says
Augustine, for we are drawn, and may not run. 2. Why should Peter give thanks,
rather then Judas or another Peter, both were equally drawn, free will lost
the day to the one, and wins it to the other. 3. Christ must but play an
after-game, and can do nothing, though with his soul he would save, but as
free will has first done, so must it be. 4. Nor am I to trust to omnipotency
of grace for conversion, for if I husband well natures hability, the crop is my
own. 5. I may engage the influence of free grace to follow me, and grace
leads not, draws not my will, I draw free grace.

Arg. 8. If free will be Lord carver of the sinners being drawn to Christ,
The covenant between the Father and the Son in making good the articles of
the treaty must depend on our free will, if Christ draw not sinners invi^cibly.
then the making good of the Articles of the bargain and covenant between the
father and the Son must depend on man's free will. Now 1. know, the covenant
between the Father and the Son is expressed first, by simple prophecy or
promise. The Father passes the word of a King, Christ shall be his first
borne, the flower of the Family, an Ensign of the people, nothing can stand
good, if the free will of Gentiles refuse to come under this Princes Royal
Standart. The Father prophecieth and promises, Psalm. 72.8. Christ shall have
dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. Psalm.
89.25. Articles of the covenant between the Father and the Son diversely
proposed.
The Lord shall set his hand in the Sea, and his right hand in the Rivers, he
shall call God his Father, his God, the Rock of his salvation. Now there must
be a condition in this Royal charter, in Christ's Magna Charta, nothing can be
done, even when Christ goes up to a mountain, and lifts up his Royal Ensign,
and Standart all mine, come hither; and when the people flock in about him,
except free will, as independent as God say Amen, and yet it far rather may
say, Nay, and refuse the bargain.

2. The Father bargaineth by asking and giving, Psalm. 2.8. Ask of me, and I
will give thee. Christ must be an heir, man's will, not by his Fathers
goodness; if Christ's suits, and demands, Father, give me the ends of the
earth, and Britain for my inheritance, Depend upon such an absolute ay, and no
of man's free will as may cast the bargain, Virg. Et penitus toto divisos orb
Britannos.
whereas our consent was not sought, nor were we called to the counsel, when
the Father bargained to make us over to his Son.

Father bargains by way of work, and hire or wages to give a seed to his
Son, Esai 53.10. When he shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall
see his seed; this is not a bare sight of his seed, but its an enjoying of
them, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, the pleasure of the
Lord shall prosper in his hand. We cannot say, it depends on men, that Christ
speed well in having a numerous seed, and that wages be paid to Christ for his
sore work of laying down his life to save his people, except we be more
play-maker, then God in this covenant.

Arg. 9. The Scripture right down determines this Controversy. Romans 9. No
man has resisted his will; and It is not in him that wills. Augustine uses
three Adverbs in the Lords manner of turning the heart; Omnipotenter,
Indeclinabiliter, Insuperabiliter; Omnipotently, Indeclinably, and without
short-coming.

How strongly and with what a sweet nec^ssity Christ draws us.
Use 1. O how sweet and strong is the grace of Christ; It is a conquering
thing, Col. 1.11. Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power.
2 Cor. 10.4. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through
God. Were they mighty through Angels and Men, that were but one creature
storming another. But when Christ besieges a soul, who can raise the siege?
Verse. 5. We bring down every height, (...), They go not to a counsel of
war, to advise upon quarters. 2. They cannot flee; For every thought is
brought captive to the obedience of Christ. Christ riding on his horse of the
Gospel, and strength of free grace, is swift and speedy, and has excellent
success. Revel. 6. He went out (...), both conquering, and that he might
conquer. Christ shoots not at the rovers, to come short, or beside the mark;
his arrows of love are sharp and conquering. The Spouse is out of her own
element, and sick, and pained with love, when she wants his presence, and
cannot dissemble, nor hide it, nor command her self, Cant. 3. no more then a
sick person can master death, or a swouning. Cant. 5.6. My soul departed out
of me; drink once of this strong wine of his love. O death, the Lions teeth,
burning quick, all these torments are nothing to the love of Christ. O, Christ
we cannot forsake. David's key is strong to open all hearts, to open hell, and
bring in a new heaven of love to the soul. Natural habits and powers are
strong, fire cannot but cast our heat, Lions cannot but prey upon lambs,
wicked habits are strong Devils, and cannot choose but be destroying Devils. The
coals of the fire of Christ's love burn not by election. 2 Cor. 5.14. The love
of Christ constrains us; there is a piece of eternity of heaven in the
breasts of the Martyrs of Jesus Christ. Abraham must go, when he is called.
Lydia cannot keep the door, when love removes the handles of the bar, and
must be in. The Lord casts in fire-workes of love, in at the windows of the
Apostles souls; O! their nets, and callings, and their All become nothing,
they must leave all, and follow Christ.

We must be loggish and crabbed timber, Use 2.
that take so much of Omnipotency, or else we cannot be drawn to the Son.
Men think it but a step to Christ, and Heaven; ah! we have but a poor and
timorous suspicion of heaven, We are hardly drawn
Devils, as may be gathered from Hebrew. 2.16. Devils, or any damned
whatsoever. 4. Not only at our first conversion must we be drawn; but the
Spouse prays, Cant. 1. to be drawn; there is need that Christ use violence to
save us, while we be in heaven; for Christ has said, Matthew. 7.14. Straight is
the gate, Crispe vol. ^. Sermon. 4 page 110.111.

Antinomians reject the narrow way that lead^ to life; their exposition of
Ma^h. 7.14. rejected as false and fleshly.


and narrow is the way that leads unto life. I grant Antinomians who loose us
from all duties, and say Christ has done all to our hand, make little
necessity of drawing at all. For Crispe says, The strictness of the way,
Math. 7.14. is not the strictness of the conversation, but all a man's own
righteousness must be cut out of the way, otherwise it is a broader way then
Christ allows of. I confess, if in this one point all the strictness of the
way to heaven were; then the way, 1. should be strait and narrow only to
those that trust in their own righteousness; but I hope, there is much more
strictness then in that one point; as in mortifying idol-lusts, loving our
enemy, feeding him when he is hungry, suffering for Christ, bearing his Cross,
denying our selves, becoming humble as children, being lowly and mock, and
following Christ's way in that.

2. Christ speaks of two ways, a wide, and a broad way, and a narrow way; Now
if the narrow way be all in a quitting our own righteousness only; as Crispe
says, perverting the Text, then all the latitude and easiness of the broad
way, must be that all the world that run to hell, they follow no sins sweet
and pleasant to the flesh; no delightful lusts, contrary to the duties of the
first and second Table, their only sin is to trust in their own
righteousness, which is against both Law and Gospel.

3. Christ commands his hearers to enter in this strait judge rashly, Verse.
1. to eye our own faults, rather then our brothers, Verse. 3.4, 5. not to
profane holy Ordinances, Verse. 6. to pray assiduously, Verse. 7.8, 9, 10. to
do to others, as we would they should do to us. Verse 12. to be good trees,
and bring forth good fruit, not to content our selves with an empty dead Faith;
as Dr. Crispe, and Libertines do, but to do the will of our heavenly Father,
to the end of the Chapter.

But let the Reader observe, as we do detest all confidence in our inherent
holiness, and all merit, and deny that our strictest walking can in any sort
justify us before God; so Libertines in all their writings and conference cast
shame upon strict walking, as Popish, Pharisaicall, and Legal; and will have
this our Christian liberty, that holy walking is not so much as no part of our
justification, which thing we grant; but (says Crispe) All our sanctification
of life is not a jot of the way of a justified person to heaven; Vol. 1. Ibid.
page 89.
the flat contrary of which Paul says, Ephesians. 2.10. For we are his
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus into good works, which God has before
ordained, that we should walk in them. That which we should walk in, must be a
jot and more of our way to heaven; and the same Crispe Sermon. 1. page ^2.
Believers are kept in holiness, sincerity, simplicity of heart, but all this
has nothing to do with the peace of their soul, and the salvation and
justification thereof. See, he confounds salvation and justification. As if
sincere walking were no way to salvation, because it is no way to
justification, and because its not the meritorious cause of our peace and
salvation; for Christ alone is so the cause: But therefore must it be no
condition of salvation? It is a profane and loose consequence. But do not
Libertines teach that no man is saved, but these that walk holyly, and that
sanctification is the unseparable fruit and effect of justification?

Answ. They say it in words, but fraudulently. Antinomians reject all
sanctification.
1. Because all Sanctification to them, all Repentance, all mortification, all
new obedience is but an apprehension, that Christ has done all these for them,
and that is their righteousness, and so Christ repented for them, and
mortified sin for them, and performed all active obedience for them. Now this
sanctification is Faith, not the personal walking in newness of life that
Christ requires.

2. This sanctification by their way is not commanded by God, nor are believers
obliged to it, under danger of sinning against God; for through the imputation
of Christ's righteousness (says Chrispe) Ser. 1. p. 18.
All our sins are so done away from us, that we stand as Christ's own person
did, and does stand in the sight of God, nor is there a body of sin in
Christ. I assume, but Christ is not obliged to our personal holiness, that
were an impossible immagination.

2. All acts of sanctification to the justified person are free, he may do
them; yea, he may not do them, and can be charged with no sin for the
omitting of them; for he is not under any moral Law, and where there is no
Law, there is no sin, (say Libertines.)

3. Men are kept in holiness, sincerity, simplicity of heart, says Crispe.
Crisp. vol. 1 Ser. 1. p. 21^*
What is that, kept? They are mere patients in all holy walking, and free will
does nothing, but the Spirit immediately works all these in us; if therefore we
omit them, it must be the fault of the Spirit, as Crispe speaks, not our
fault, nor ought we to pray, but when the Spirit moves us, as before you
heard; so that this sanctification is not any holiness opposite to the flesh,
and to sin forbidden in the Law of God, but a sort of free and arbitrary and
immediate acting of the Spirit, It was the old error of the Libertines* of
Antonius Po^quius Priest as Calvine says, I^struct. ad Libertinos cap 23. in
opuscu. page 460. so Pocquius existimabam me aliquid intelligere, nec quicquam
intelligo: deus enim intellectus meus est, and virtus mea, and salus mea.
Calv^ne answers excellently* Homo quidem fidelis, se nihil ex seipso
intelligere ceaset; sed an propteria debet ^^culos c^an^dere, ne quid
intueatur, ut vult iste insanus? A man (says Calvine) in Christ judges that
he understands nothing of himself, (and so that he can neither pray nor
believe, without the Spirit) but shall he therefore close his eyes, that he
may understand nothing at all, as this phrantick man imagines.
in the omission of which acts, the justified person no more sins against
God, then a tree, or a stone, which are creatures under no moral Law of God,
when these creatures do not pray, nor love Christ, nor out of sanctified
principles abstain from these acts of Adultery, Murder, Oppression, which
being committed, would make rational men under guiltiness, and sin before God.

4. Town Ass^rtion of Grace, Page 56.57. and page 58. page 156. A believer is
as well saved already, as justified by Christ, and in him. Page 159. Divines
say, our life and salvation is inchoate; but they speak of life, as it is here
subjective, page 160. Quantum ad nos spectat, Or in respect of our sense and
apprehension, here in grace, our faith, knowledge, sanctification is imperfect;
but in regard of imputation and donation, (page 162.) our righteousness is
perfect; and (page 160. he that believes ((...)) has life, not he shall have
it, or has it in hope.

Answ. If we have glory really, actually, perfectly, but we want it only in
sense; we have the resurrection from the dead also, actually, and perfectly,
and we are risen out of the grave already, and we want the resurrection only
in the sense: for sure by merit, and Christ's death, we have as really the
resurrection from the dead, as we have glory, and life; and the one we have as
really as the other; so we want nothing of the reality of heaven, but sense;
but we are not yet before the throne, nor risen from the dead, nor locally
above the visible heavens; except they say as Familists do, and as Hymeneus
and Philetus did, that the Resurrection is a spiritual thing in the mind; and
heaven is but a spiritual sense of Christ, and that Christ is heaven, and the
life to come is within the precincts of this life; this were to deny a life to
come, a heaven, a hell, a resurrection, which Antinomians will be found to do.

This one special ground is much pressed by Master Town, and the generality
of Libertines, to wit, that holy walking before God, is neither way to heaven
nor condition, nor means of salvation, in regard, we are not only in hope,
but actually saved, when we are first justified, and as really saved and passed
from death to life, when we believe, as we are said, Ephesians. 2.6. To be raised
up with Christ, to sit together with him in heavenly places. And therefore holy
walking can be no means, no way, no entrance, no condition of our possession
of the heavenly kingdom, and therefore no wonder they reject all
sanctification, as not necessary, and teach men to loose the raines to all
fleshly walking.

But 1. Romans 8.24. We are saved by hope, then we are not actually saved, but
the jus, the right through Christ's merits to life eternal is ours, and
purchased to us. The borne heir of a Prince, is in hope a Prince, but he comes
not out of the womb with the crown on his head. Christ coming out of the
grave, which is the womb and loins of death, as the first begotten of the
dead is borne a king, Acts 5.31. and all that are borne of this father of Ages,
Esai 9.6. his seed are heirs annexed with Christ the first heir, Romans 8.17.
but heirs under nonage, and minors, and waiting for the living and the
crown, they have it not in hand. Romans 8.24. Hope that is seen, is not hope:
for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for it. Verse. 25. But if we hope
for what we see not, then we do with patience wait for it. Hence I argue, what
we wait for and see not, that we do not actually enjoy. But we hope for
salvation, Romans 5.2. 1 John 3.1, 2, 3. The proposition is Scripture; no man can
hope for that which he enjoyes already. 2. We can be no otherwise said to be
saved, then the believer is said to be passed from death to life, and to be
risen again with Christ, and to sit with Christ in heavenly places. For as we
are saved and glorified in hope only, not actually, so are we passed from
death to life, and sit with Christ in heavenly places, and are partakers of the
resurrection in hope only, or in our flesh, in regard our flesh is in heaven
in Christ, who has infestment of heaven for us, as a man gets a stone or a
twigge in his hand, and that is to get the land, but yet he may want real
possession. Christ's presence in heaven is real in Law, we are there with him.
But it cannot infer our personal and bodily presence, and real
resurrection, which we hope for and want, not only in sense, but really. For
we are not in this life immortal, beyond death, and sickness, and burying and
corruption actually, nor yet are we in glory, that which we shall be, when
Christ our life and head shall appear, For, 1. we yet groan as sick
creatures in tabernacles of clay, 2 Cor. 5.1, 2. and carry about with us sick
and dying clay, and Christ promises that of all that the Father gives him, he
will lose nothing, but raise them from the dead; but that is, not in this life,
but at the last day, Joh. 6.39.

3. Such as are really and actually saved, can neither mary, nor be given in
marriage, How we are saved in this life.
neither can they dye any more, (marying and dying are bloud-friends together)
but are as the Angels in heaven, Luke ^2.36, 37, 38. their vile bodies are
changed, Henry Nicholas of low Germany taught the same doctrine, a hundred
years ago. Cha. 1. Sent. 9 For behold in this present day is the glorious
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the many thousands of his Saints, he
comes manifested, which has set himself now upon the seat of his Majesty,
for to judge in this same day, which the Lord has ordained, the whole world
with equity: and Chap. 35. Sent. 8. Behold, in this present day is this
Scripture fulfilled, Esai 26. Dan. 12* 4. Esdras 7. 1 Thessalonians. 4. Matthew. 24. and
25. Luke 17. Acts 1. Matthew. 24. Revel. 14. according to the testimony of the
Scripture, the raising up and resurrection of the Lords dead comes also to
pass presently in this same day, through the appearing of the coming of of
Christ in his Majesty, etc. So this man denies any life to come, or any
Resurrection, to which way Antinomians incline.
and are fashioned and made like the glorious body of our Savior the Lord
Jesus Christ. Phil. 3.20.21. And shall be heavenly bodies, spiritual, and as
the stars of the heaven in glory, 1 Cor. 15.40, 41, 42, 43. But we are not in
that condition in this life, this corruptible has not put on incorruption, nor
this mortal immortality. Then as we are saved in hope, and have jus ad rem, a
full right to life eternal, and the Resurrection of our bodies, in regard,
that the price is paid for us, a complete and perfect ransom, even the blood
of the Son of God is given for us, and so we are saved in hope, 2. in Law and
jure. But sure we have not actual possession of the Kingdom, in the full
income, rent, and complete harvest of glory, but only grapes, and the first
fruits of Canaan.

4. It is too evident to half an eye, that when Antinomians say we are
actually saved, and perfectly freed from sin in this life and as perfectly
sinlesse as Christ himself; That their meaning is, that which the old
Libertines in Calvinus in opuse. in instruc. advers libertinos. Cap. 23. p.
460, 461, and cap. 22. p. 458, 459 Pocquiu^ in libello Scriptum est, non tendes
ad malum, cavens ne adulteres in verbo, (id est, in litera Scripturae) ficut

scriptum est abstinete vos ab adulteratione, ut possitis vas vestrum in

Calvin's time said, 1. That our deliverance from sin in Christ is, in infernali
Spiritualitate, (as Calvin speaks) in such a Divelish and hellish
Spirituality; as that wicked Priest Anto Pocquius said, was in judging neither
murders, adulteries, perjurie, lying, oppression, -- Quaere re^e^quamus

to be sins, when once the pardoned and justified person committed such
villainies, because the Spirit of God was in him, and took sense from him. 2.
Because the justified person is made one with Christ, one person, or as
Antinomians speak, we are Christed, and made one with Christ, and he one with
us, or incarnate and made flesh in us, Hen Nicol. cap. 34. Christ has
anointed me, with his Godly being, he has Godded me.
and the Rise, reign, error 11.
new creature or the New man mentioned in the Gospel, is not meant of Grace,
but of Christ, and Er. 7.
by love 1 Cor. 13.13. and by the armor mentioned Ephesians. 6. are meant Christ.
So said that vile man Pocquius, that we and Christ are made one, as Evah was
formed out of a rib of Adams side, he means one person. 3. Man following his
lusts and committing all sin with greediness, is made spiritual and mortified
by Christ's death, so also Er. 8. Pocquius 16. apud Calv. in opus. 463.
Obdormivit, (Christus) in cruce, and suit apertum latus ut cesta repertretur
que est semina, Ecclesia dicta, and unio (personalis) totius naturae humanae,
and fieri omnes in un^ membro cujus Christus est caput.
Pocquius who said to sin without sense is the Spiritual life we are restored
to in Christ: So Antinomians aim at this, that what ever the regenerate do,
they are as free of sin before God, as Christ or the Elect Angels, and this is
the begun Spiritual Life. 4. Libertines in Calvin's time Pocquius 16. page 461.
Scriptum est omnia munda mundis, qui autem fide purificatus est, totus gratus
Deo Calvinus ibid. Putidus este hanc sententiam eo applicat ut latro^mia,
scortationes homicidia pro mundis and sanct^s rehus habeantur.
said that life eternal was in this life, and that the resurrection was past;
as Hymeneus and Phyletus who made shipwreck of the faith, because a man knows
his soul is an immortal Spirit living in the heavens, and because Christ has
taken away the opinion and sense of death, by his death, and so has restored
us to life. Mistress Hutchison and her Disciples, the Familists of Rise, reign,
ruin the body of the Story, p. 59, 60, 62.
New England denying the immortality of the soul, and the resurrection of
these our mortal bodies affirmed all the resurrection they knew, was the union
of the soul with Christ in this life. I never could observe any considerable
difference between the foul Diverse Antinomians deny the life to come, and the
Resurrection of the dead, as did Hymeneus and Phyletus
Heresies of the Familists of New England, and of Old England either by the
writings of, or conference with them, nor of either, from the damnable Doctrine
of Hymeneus and Phyletus, and the old Libertines who said, The Resurrection was
past.

Use 3. The drawing of sinners to Christ, if he draw so sweetly and with such a
loving condiscension, cannot be a violence offered to free will, by which the
natural and concreated liberty of the creature is destroyed, for there
remains a natural indifferency, by which reason and judgment proposes to
the elective faculty diverse objects, that have no natural connection with will;
so as the will should be bowed to any of them, as the fire casts out heat,
and the Sun light, and the stone falls downward, its true in drawing of a
sinner, Christ is carried into the heart with a greater weight of love, and a
stronger sway of grace, Free will free, in being drawn to Christ.
then any other object whatsoever, and with so prevailing a sway, as masters
the elective power, that it cannot will to refuse, yet it destroys not the
elective power; because this non posse repudiare, impotencie or unwillingnesse
to reject Christ, (to speak so) is a most free, vital, kindly, voluntary, and
delighting impotency, and comes from the bowels and innate power of will, and
this is the Virgin-liberty and power of will. But again, because Christ's
drawing is efficacious and strong and carries the business with a heavenly and
loving prevalency, the Arminian and Jesuiticall indifferency that New Pelagians
ascribes to free will, Arminian indifferency of will loosed from all
predetermination of God, blasphemous.
as an essential property of it, by which when God and the pull and nerves of
the right arm of Jesus Christ in his free grace, have done what they can to
draw a free Agent, nevertheless the man may refuse to be drawn, if so it
please free will, though it displease God, and cross his decree and most
hearty and natural desire, is a wicked fancy.

1. Because by this dream God has not a dominion and sovereign power over the
created will of man to determine it for his own ends, and to make use of it for
the glory of his grace, though the Lord with his soul desire so to do, but the
creature has an absolute, free and independent power, to cross the desire of
the Lords soul, for its own destruction and a far other end, which God intends
but at the second hand, and contrary to his natural and essential desire (as
they teach) to save his creature, to wit, that revenging justice may be
declared in the eternal destruction of the most part of mankind; whereas it
was his desire that not only the most part, but that all and every single Man
and Angel (the fallen Devils not excepted) should be eternally saved.

2. We believe that God the first cause, as he decrees to all things that were
from eternity in a state of poor possiblity; so as of themselves they might be,
or might not be; a futurition or a shall be, or a non-futurition, or a shall
never be: So he is midwife to his own blessed decrees, Gods decree gives a
shall be, or a shall not be, to all things possible.
and determines all created causes to bring forth these effects that were in
the womb of his holy decrees, for all things that were to be, and do fall out
in time, were births from eternity that lay in the womb of the decree of God;
evils of punishment, or sins as permitted, Acts 17.30. are not excepted. Zeph.
2.
So Zephaniah wills the people to flee to God, before the decree that is with
child, bring forth the birth: (...) Ante parere decretum.
Then God must in time open and unlock free will for all its actions. Isai.
44.7. And who, as I shall call and set it in order for me, since I appointed or
decreed the ancient people? and the things that are coming or shall come, let
them show unto them. So God takes this to him as proper to appoint things to
come, and no supposed God, nor power what ever can share with him in it, and
let any man answer and give a reason why of ten thousand possible worlds of
infinite things, actions of Men and Angels that from eternity of themselves
were only possible, and might be, or not be; so many of them, not more, not
fewer received a futurition, that they shall come to pass, and so fall out in
time, and others remained only possible, and came never further to being, and
never fall out, but from the only free decree and will of God, who conceived in
that infinite womb of his eternal counsel and wisdom, such things shall
be, such things shall only remain possible, and shall never be, nor never come
to pass? As it was decreed that wicked men should break the legs of the two
Thieves crucified with Christ, and that they should not break Christ's legs, yet
the breaking of Christ's legs was in it self, and from eternity no less
possible, then the breaking of the legs of the fellow sufferers with him; but
Gods only decree gave a futurition and an actual being to the one, not to the
other: So are all the actions, the chusings, refusings, ^illings, willings of
free will determined to be, or not be; and come to pass, or not come to pass,
according as they were births conceived in the mother-decree of God from
eternity, Psalm. 139.16. In thy book were all my members written, which in
continuance were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them.

God the f^rst efficient, and last final cause of all beings and acts of free
will
3. He that works all things according to the counsel of his will, as Ephesians.
1.11. He of whom, and through whom, and for whom are all things, as Romans
11.36. He that made all things for himself, Pro. 16.4. even the wicked for
the ill day, and for whose pleasure all things are, Revel. 4.11. must be such
an Efficient and Author, such a final cause of all, as shapeth a particular
being to things, (...)
actions, and every creature, as their determinate being must be from him. If
the being of the actions of free will, rather then their not-being, be from
free will, not from God, but in a general, universal, or disjunctive
influence; that is, in such a way as whatever God decreed from eternity,
touching Peter's acts of willing or nilling, The Remonstrants at the ^ynod of
Dort, with shame denied that the word (...) was in the Text, an easy way of
^l^di^g Scripture. The genera^l, universa^l, and indifferent concurrence and
influence of God with second causes, devised by Jesuits and Arminians, a
dream.
embracing or repudiating Christ, or what way soever the Lord shape and mould
his influence and concurrence in time, either the one or the other may fall
out, and Peter may embrace Christ or not embrace him, and so may Judas, and all
Men and Angels; then shall I say, The Kings heart, and his nilling and willing,
is in the hand of his own heart; so the King turns his own heart, whither
soever he determines his own will, and not as Solomon says, Pro. 21.1. in
the hands of the Lord: and the creature is master of work; Angels, Men, free
and contingent, necessary and natural causes are Mint-masters to coin what
actions they will, this or this; election and reprobation, vessels of mercy and
of wrath, believing or not-beleeving, are in the hands of Angels and Men, the
creature shall be both Potter and clay: The great Lord and former of all
things, and the vessel for Gods conditional decree, his collateral and
universal, his disjunctive and dependent influence has no force to cast the
scale of free will to willing, and so to salvation, election, inscription in
the book of life, more then to nilling, damnation, and blotting out, or
not-inrolling in the book of life; Indifferency of free will loosed from the
d^minion of providence, ^nthro^es fortune and contingency in Gods room.
but is indifferent to either, is determined and bowed by the free will of man
to which of the two shall seem good to lord will, and the Lord cannot turn
the heart whither soever he will. Which close sets up fortune, independent and
absolute contingency, and a supremacy and principality of working every effect
and event on both sides of the sun, and above the sun, in order of nature, by
the creature, before and without the efficiency of the cause of causes, and the
intention or counsel of God: yea, it involves the Lord in a fatal chain, he
must either concur, or the creature disposes of the militia, laws, and
affairs of heaven and earth without the King of ages. 1. I cannot make prayers
to the Lord, to determine my will to his obedience, not to lead me into
temptation. 2. I cannot thank his free grace for either. 3. I cannot entrust
God with working in me to will and to do: Nor, 4. comfort my self in the
Lord: 5. Nor be patiently submissive to God under all my calamities that befall
me, by the hand of men, devils, or creatures. Why? The Lord can do no more
then he can; he had no more will nor counsel before time, nor hand and
disposing of the business in time, for all these, then for the just
contradicent of these; say the lord-patrones of indifferent and so absolute a
free will. 6. How does Jacob pray that the Lord would give his sons favor
with the Governor of Egypt, whom he believed to be a heathen; and pray that
God would change his brother Esau's heart; and Esther and her maids pray, that
God would grant her favor in the eyes of Ahashuerus, if God have not in his
hand power to turn their hearts from hatred to favor, as pleases him? 7. The
Lord takes on him to turn men's free will in mercy or judgment, as pleases
him: Pro. 3. My son, forget not my law, so shall thou find favor (Verse. 4.)
with God and man. The Lord gave Joseph favor in the eyes of Potiphar, Genesis
39.21. God brought Daniel in favor and tender love with the Prince of the
Eunuchs, Dan. 1.9. The Lord made his people to be pitied of all those that
carried them captives, Psalm. 106.46. The Lord turned the hearts of the
Egyptians, to hate his people, Psalm. 105.25. War and peace are from the free
wills of men, as second causes, yet the Lord says, according to his absolute
dominion, Isai. 45.7. I form the light and create darkness; I make peace and
create evil. And Isai. 7.8. The Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the
uttermost part of the river of Egypt, and for the be that is in the land of
Assyria, and they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate
valleys. Isai. 10.6. I will send the Assyrian against an hypocritical nation.
So Jer. 1.15, 16. Isai. 13.1, 2, 3. Chap. 15.1, 2, ^. and 17.1, 2, 3. and 19.1,
2, 3, 4. Now God could not be the Author of war and peace, as God and
Sovereign all-Disposer, if it were in the indifferent arbitriment and free
election of men, that war should freely issue from man's free will; so as God
could neither decree, command, ordain it in his providence, threaten it in his
justice, foresee it in his wisdom, and foretell it by his Prophets,
determine it by his free grace, except the free will of nations and men first
pass an act in this poor low Court of clay, in the heads and breasts of little
lords, free-will-men, and make sure work on earth of its coming to pass; and
so the Almighty Sovereign of all things should have the second conditional
vote of an after-game in heaven, of all actions contingent and managed by free
will of Angels and Men, such as peace, war, honor, infamy, riches, poverty,
health, sickness, life, or violent death, by sword, gibbet, poison, etc.
hatred, favor, learning, ignorance, faith, unbeleefe, obedience to God,
disobedience, salvation, damnation, long, or short life, sailing, selling,
buying, eating, speaking, joying, weeping, building, planting, praying,
praising, cursing, Christ's coming of the seed of David, the use of Prophets,
prophesying, etc.

Object. Is it not contrary to the nature of freedom, to be determined by a
foreign and external agent, and that by a power stronger then the free will
can resist or master? If ye with a stronger power tie a sword to my arm, and
strongly and irresistibly throw my arm and sword both, to kill a man, can I be
the murderer of this man?

Answ. All the question here is, Whether the Lords freedom and dominion in
these actions of clay-vessels or men's must stand? How God determines free will,
and forces it not.
We had rather contend for the Lord and grace, than for the creature and free
will.

2. It is contrary to the nature of freedom to be determined with one sort of
determination, not with another: 1. With such a determination natural, as is
in the stone to fall down, the sun to give light, Two sorts of determinations
of will.
its true; but now the assumption is false. 2. Should we suppose that he who
ties the sword to your arm, so as he carries along with him in that motion
your reason, judgment, elective power, so as you join in your arbitrary and
free election, yea and with delight and joy, (which is somewhat more then free
will) to strike with the sword, and he that lifts both arm and sword did not
thwart, or cross your internal, vital, and elective power, as the Lord moves
the will in natural acts, as acts in all sinful deviations from a Law, he
should not free you from the guilt of murder: and so yet the assumption is
false; for Christ so moves and determines the will to believe, as all the
in-workes and vital wheels of will, reason, judgment, freedom, are so moved
with such an accommodation and fit and congruous attemperation to free will, as
it goes along sweetly, gladly, freely with the grace of Christ in conversion;
and too gladly and willingly in acts to which wickedness and murder are
annexed; as there can be no other straining or compulsion here dreamed of, but
such as when a Virgin is said to be ravished, who freely and deliberately
appoints time, place, persons, opportunities, and gladly comes to the place
in which she is carried away; which neither Law nor Reason can make a rape.
Now, I grant, neither Man nor Angel can so work upon the will; it is proper to
the Lord, and communicable to no creature to know what congruous ways can
efficaciously draw the will. And, 2. Its God only who can attemper
irresistible strength, and sweetness and delectation of consent together.

Use 4. Its not a good, nor a comfortable way, Its our happiness that free
will be not the (...) of our heaven.
nor would I love a heaven that is referred to a may be, or a may not be; its
not a good heaven that is referred to a venture. 2. Weakness left of God
turns wickedness: It is kindly to our corruption to be uncouth, strange,
froward to Christ, and undiscreet to strong love. 3. Free will is now like a
bankrupt Merchant, or a young and loose heir, who has lost all credit; Christ
dare not venture a stock in our hand. 4. Christ is a Shepherd who in feeding*
his flock stands on his feet, Isai. 40.11. and sits not down, to lie and sleep:
the first Adam sat down; all his sons lie down: never man on his own bottom
can come to heaven. Let us choose this sure way, that broken men may be tutored
by Jesus Christ.

and pride makes them high and lofty; how then is withdrawing from God, so base
and low a word in the Apostles style, expressed by the Prophet Habbacuc in so
high a word, as the towering up the soul? There is a reciprocation of things in
the word signified; for unbeleefe, resisting of Christ, and the sinners
withdrawing, is an act of the highest pride: he that will not be converted,
and refuses Christ, thinks he can fend without Christ, he has a stronger
Castle to run to then Christ, and imagines that his sins and lusts shall
shelter him in the ill day: And unbeleefe is a base, timorous, and cowardly
thing, when men, for fear of a less evil and a poorer loss, steal away
from Christ: And both is base or poor pride, and high or lofty beggarlinesse,
in stealing away from Christ's colors; which the Lord abhorres. 2. Withdrawing
looks hell-like: He that is not saved in the nick of conversion, is eternally
lost. Heb. 10.38. But we are not of the withdrawing to perdition. Withdrawing
has no home but hell. 3. Its a sign of an obdurate heart. Zech. 7.11. But they
have refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ear,
lest they should hear. And so judgement-like is withdrawing, and smells so of
vengeance, that God plagues withdrawing with withdrawing: Hos. 5.4. They will
not frame their doings to turn unto their God. And what is the issue of that?
They shall go with their flocks and herds to seek the Lord, but they shall not
find him; for he has withdrawn himself from them. Pro. 1.24. I called, and
ye refused; Verse. 26. then this must follow, Verse. 28. (as also Joh. 8.21. the
like is) they shall call upon me, but I will not answer.

Use 6. Its a terrible plague of God, which we would eschew as hell, to wit,
provoking of God by such sins as may procure that God should in his judgment
mar the lock of the heart, the will, that the door should neither shut nor
open; and cast poison into the soul, so as Angels and Men, heaven and earth
cannot help or cure it: Christ is good at opening hearts, and drawing sinners;
and he is as good at judicial closing of hearts: If he but put his finger in
the eye, and snap in pieces the optic nerves, all the world cannot restore
sight, or open the heart. He that is nearest to be drawn to Christ, and yet
never drawn, is deepest in hell: An Evangelike-fire of Gods fury is worse then
a Sinai-fire, though it burn up to mid-heaven. 1. Sinning against the light of
nature and the known will of God, as Idolatry and the principles of your own
Religion, true and known to be so, brings delivering up to judicial
blindness, Romans 1.21. (2.) If ye put your finger in natures eye, and blow out
that candle, God will give you up to vile affections, Romans 1.24. and a
reprobate mind, Verse. 26, 27, 28. Some blow out the candle of nature, and God
blows out the sun of the Gospel, that it is to them like sackcloth of hair,
and a moon like blood. 3. Resisting of the call of God, brings on the plague of
hardness of heart; Pro. 1.24, 25, 26, 27. Act. 28.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Joh.
8.21.

Use 7. We are hence taught, to put our heart in Christ's hand; he, and he
only who makes all things new, We are to await Christ's work of conversion.
has a singular faculty in making old hearts new hearts. Now there is no such
way as to lie at the tide, and wait on a full sea and a fair wind, and ship in
with Christ; attend the ordinances, watch at the posts of the door of Wisdom

Object. I have been a hearer thirty, forty years, I am as far from being
drawn this day, as the first day.

Answ. 1. Such a soul would not be oyled at the first with the persuaded
assurance of an everlasting love of election, How to deal with any that are
troubled for non-conversion.
as Libertines cure poor souls; but would be brought to see sin, and be
humbled and plowed, that Christ may sow.

2. They would be taken off their own bottom, and discharged to confide and
rest on humiliation, or any thing in themselves.

3. The manner, motives, and grounds of their complaining would be examined.
Seldom or never is it seen that a reprobate man can be in sad earnest heavy
in heart, touching his deadness of heart, and fruitless hearing of the word
of God thirty or forty years: and withal, if there be a dram of sincerity,
the least grain of Christ, as if the soul do but look afarre-off, with half
an eye, yet greedily after the Lord Jesus, its a sweet beginning. Its true, Its
no Gospel Truth, that God loves no man less for sin, or more for inherent
righteousness.
a talent weight of iron or sand is as weighty as a talent weight of gold, but
in a Saint an ounce weight of grace has more weight then a pound of
corruption. It is no Gospel Truth that Antinomians teach, That God loves no man
less for sin, or no man more for inherent holiness. Its true of the love of
election and reconciliation, in the work of justification; but most false of
the love of divine manifestation, in the work of sanctification; as is clear,
Joh. 14.21, 23. Nor are men by this taught to seek righteousness in
themselves; because they are commanded to try and examine themselves, as 1 Cor.
11.28. 2 Cor. 13.5.

4. Such souls would upon any terms be brought to reason and debate the
question with Christ, that as the Law may stop their mouth before God, so mercy
may stop the mouth of the Law and sin, and it may convincingly be cleared, that
though scarlet or crimson can by no art be made white, yet Christ, who is above
art, can make them white, Isai. 1.18. as wool and snow. And therefore such
would be brought in an high esteem and deep judgment of Christ's fairness,
beauty, excellency, incompatable and transcendent worth: and though a soul
have a too high esteem of his sins, yet say that he dies with an high esteem
of Jesus Christ, he is in no danger; for faith is but a swelled, an high and
broad opinion and thought of the incomparable excellency and sweetness of
Jesus Christ.

Use 8. This powerful drawing teaches humble thankfulness. Christ's gra^e in
(...), in (...).
(1.) The most harmless and innocent sinner must be in Christ's book for the
debt of ten thousand Talents. (2.) The sense of drawing grace is mighty
engaging, every act of thankful obedience should come out of this womb, as
the birth and child of the felt love of God. Christ did bid such a man battle.
2. He was Christ's enemy when he took him. (3.) It cost Christ blood he died to
conquer an enemy, Romans 5.10. (4.) He kept the taken enemy alive, he might have
killed him, he gave him more then quarters, he made a captive a King, Rev. 1.6.
Suppose we, Christ should in his own person come locally down to hell, and look
upon so many thousands scorching and flaming in that unsufferable lake of fire
and brimstone, if he should cull out by the head and name; so many thousands of
them, even while they were spitting on Christ, blaspheming his name, and
scratching his face, and should loose off the fetters of everlasting vengeance,
and draw them from amongst millions of damned Spirits, lay them in his bosom,
carry them to heaven, set them on Thrones of glory, crown them as Kings to
reign with him for evermore. Would they not be shamed, and overcome with this
love, kiss and adore so free a Redeemer? and thus really has Christ dealt
with sinners, look on your debts written in Christ's grace-book, would not such
a redeemed one praise his Ransomer, and say, O if every finger, every inch of a
bone, every lith, every drop of blood of my body, every hair of my head, were
in an Angels perfection to praise Jesus Christ; O the weight of the debt of
love; O the gold Mines and the depths of Christ's free love.

3. Consider what expressions vessels of grace have used of free grace? how far
below grace Paul sets himself, lo here, Ephesians. 3.8. Riches or grace.
To me who am, 1. Less then a Saint. 2. Not that only, but less then the
least. 3. Less then the least of Saints. But 4. yet a little lower, less then
the least of all Saints is this grace given, that I should preach the
unsearchable riches of Christ. Gospel riches is grace and mercy but there is a
great abundance of it; its a speech from quick-sented hounds, who have neither
footstep, nor trace, nor sent left them of the game they pursue. Christ defies
men and Angels to trace him in the ways of grace. So Paul 1 Timothy 1.13. I was a
blasphemer and a persecuter, and an injurious person (...), but I was
be-mercied, as if dipped in a river, in a Sea of mercy. Verse. 14. And the grace
of the Lord Jesus to me was abundant. No, that is to low a word, (...), his
grace was more, or over-abundant, one Paul obtained as much grace, even so
whole and complete a ransom without diminishing, as would have saved a world.
Romans 5.15. If through the offense of one, many be dead, Overflowings of grace.
much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jesus
Christ, has abounded unto many. (...), the word is exceedingly to abound, and
borrowed from fountains and rivers which have flowed with waters since the
creation; but there is a higher word, Verse. 12. Where sin abounded, grace
far more, or exceedingly over-abounded, or more then over-abounded. -- (...).
And Verse. 21. Sin reigned unto death, that grace might reign unto life, (...),
that Christ's grace might play the King. The saving knowledge of God under the
Kingdom of the Messiah, Esai 11.9. fills the earth, as the Sea is covered with
waters. A Sea of Faith, and a Earthfull of the grace of saving light, and a
Sun sevenfold, as the light of seven days. Esai 30.26. hold forth to us a
large measure of grace, and righteousness^ and peace like a river, and the
waves of the sea, Esai 48.18. All these say Christ is no niggard of grace.

And 4. can they not wear and out-spend their harps, who fall down before the
Lamb, Revel. 14. and Revel. 5.8. Who with a loud voice, praise the grace of
God. Verse. 12. For ever and ever? Thankefulnes^ for grace required.
Consider if it must not be a loud voice, when ten thousand times ten thousand,
and thousand thousands, all join in one song to extol grace; if we be not in
word and deed obliged to express the virtues and praises of him, who has
called us from darkness to his marveilous light.

Verse. 32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.
Article II.

The next thing we consider is the person that draws. I (says Christ) I will
draw all men to me.

There is a peculiar aptitude in Jesus Christ to draw sinners to himself. The
virtues in Christ sitting him to draw sinners.


1. As concerning his person he is fit, for neither is the Father, nor the Holy
Ghost, in person, Lord Redeemer, but Christ; as in the deep of Gods wisdom,
the Son was thought fittest to make Sons, Galat. 4.4. the heir to
communicate the right of heire-ship to the nearest of the blood, to his
brethren to make them joynt-heires with him; so is Christ a fit person, as Lord
Savior, to rescue captives, and to draw them to the state of Sonne-ship, which
I speak not to exclude the other two persons; for Joh. 6.44. The Father draws
to the Son; and the Spirit of grace in the work of conversion, must be a
special agent, but Christ is made in a personal consideration, a drawer of
sinners; God works and caries on all his state-designes of heaven by Christ,
Hebr. 2.10. He brings or drives many Sons to glory.

2. Christ by office is a congregating and uniting Mediator, Col. 1.20. He
makes heaven and earth one, He is our peace, and made of twain on, Ephesians.
2.14. The Shepherd that gathers the Sons of God in one, Joh. 11.52. And he
by the merit of his blood makes sinners Legally one with God; he is Emmanuel,
God with us: fit to draw us in a Law-union to God. We were banished out of
Paradise, the Son by office, was sent out to bring in the outlaw sons.

3. God has laid down, (in a manner) his compassion, mercy, gentleness, to
sinners in Christ, and Christ has taken off infinite wrath, and satisfied
justice in his nature and office. God is no where (to speak so) so much mercy,
graciousnesse, kindness, tender compassion to sinners, such a Sea of love as
in the Lord Jesus. O but he is a most lovely, desirable compassionate God in
Christ. The sinner finds all that God can have in him, or do for saving, in
the Mediator Christ; there can nothing come out of God to the sinner, but
through Christ. There is no golden pipe, no channel but this; all God, and
whol^ God is in Christ, and all God as communicable to the creature; and were
God seen in his lovelynesse, his beauty would be strong coards and chains to
draw hell up to heaven. Love, grace, mercy, are sodering and uniting attributes
in God; now though these same essential attributes that are in one, be in all
the three persons; yet the Mediatory manifestation of love, grace, and free
mercy is only in the Son; so as Christ is the treasury, storehouse, How
the ou^i^g of Gods (...) in the Son.
and magazene of the free goodness and mercy of the Godhead. As the Sea is a
congregation of waters, so is Christ a conf^u^nce of these lovely and drawing
attributes that are in the Godhead. Christ is the face of God* 2 Cor. 4.6. The
beauty and lovelynesse of the person, much of the majesty and glory of the man
is i^ the face; now the beauty, and majesty and glory of God is manif^sted i^
Christ; So Hebr. 1.3. He is the brightness of his glory; the Father is as it
(...) all Sun, and all p^^rle, the Son Christ is the substantial rays,
light-shining, the eternal, and ^ss^^tiall irradiation of this Sun of glory;
the Suns glory is manifested to the world, in the light and beams that it
sends out to the wo^l^; and if the Sun should keep its beams and light
within i^s body, we should see nothing of the Suns beauty and glory. No M^n
no Angel, could see any thing of Go^, i^ (...) had not had a consubstantiall
Son begotten of himself by ^n eternal generation; but Christ is the beam^s,
and splendour, and the shining, but the consubstantiall shining of the infinite
p^arle, and outs God, as the s^^le does the st^mp^; and as God inc^^nate h^
reveals the excellency, glory, and beauty of God. (...) pearl is a drawing
and an alluring creature from its shining b^^uty; so Christ is the drawing
lovelynesse of God, ye cannot s^e the creatures beauty, or the man's face, but
ye see the creature and the man; so says Christ to Philip* Joh. 14.9. He
that has seen me, has seen the Father. I am as like the Father, as God is
like himself; there is a perfect, indivisible, essential unity between the
Father and me. I and the Father are one; one very God; he the begetter, I the
begotten. So God has laid down and empawned all his beauty, his lovelynesse,
and his drawing virtue in Christ the lodestone of heaven; he is the
substantial rose, that grew out of the Father from eternity. A man's wisdom
makes his face to shine. Wisdom is a fair, lovely, and an alluring beauty.
Now Christ is the essential wisdom of God; were your eyes once fastened upon
that dainty lovely thing Christ, that uncreated golden Arc, the eternal, that
infinite flower and Lilie, that sprang out of the essence, and beautiful
nature of God, with eternal infinite greenness, fairness, smell, vigor,
life, never to fade, that essential wisdom, and substantial word, the
intellectual birth of the Lords infinite understanding, if your eyes were once
on him in a vision of glory, it should be unpossible to get your eyes off him
again, there would come such drawing rays, and visuall lines of lovely
beauty, and glory, from his face to your eyes, and should dart in through these
created windows, to the understanding, heart, and affection, such arrows and
darts of love, as ye shall be a captive of glory for ever and ever. Psalm,
16.11. In thy presence is fullness of joy. Revel. 22.4. They shall see his
face, -- its a Kings face, and a kingly glory to see it. -- Ver. 5. And they
shall reign for ever and ever.

Christ man in a lovely posture of drawing sinners.
such a stock of free grace, so wide, so tender, so large bowels of mercy and
compassion toward sinners, as he would put himself into a posture of mercy,
and in such a station of clay, as he might conveniently get a strong pull of
sinners to draw them, a large and wide handful, or his arms full of sinners,
as he would be a man for us, to get all the organes of lovely drawing of
sinners to him: a man's heart to love man, a man's bowels to compassionate man, a
man's hands to touch the foul leapers skin, a man's mouth and tongue to pray for
man, to preach to men, and in our nature to publish the everlasting Gospel; a
man's legs to be the good Shepherd to go over mountain and wildern^sse, to
seek or to save lost sheep; a man's soul to sigh and groan for man; a man's
eyes to weep for sinners* his nature to lay down his life for his poor
friends, he would be a created clay-tent of free grace, a shop, and an
office-house of compassion toward us, he would borrow the womb of a sinner to
be borne, suck the breasts of a woman that needed a Savior, eat and drink
with sinners and publicans, came to seek and to save lost sinners, was numbered
with sinners, dyed between two sinners; made his grave with sinners, (says
Esaiah, Esai 53.9.) borrowed a sinners tomb to be buried in. And now he keeps
the old relation with sinners, when he is in heaven, honor has not changed
him, as he has forgotten his old friends, Hebr. 4.15. For we have not a high
Priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in
all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Christ cannot now sigh,
but he can feel sighing, he cannot weep, he has a man's heart to
compassionate our weeping, in such a way as is suitable to his glorr^ed
condition; the head is in heaven, but he has left his heart in earth with
sinners: there can be nothing dearer to Christ, then the holy Spirit; he has
sent us down that comforter, the Spirit, to abid^ with us.

Use 1. O that men would come and look into this Ark, and that Christ would
draw the curtain? Behold Christ's (...).
Do^ but hear himself crying to the Cities of Judah, Isai. 40.9. Behold your
God. Isai. 65.1. I said to a Nation that was not called by any Name, Behold me,
Behold me: The doubling of the word says, Christ desires to out his beauty,
Shall your farm, and you^ ^ve yoke of Oxen keep you from him? Men will not be
drawn to him to satisfy their love.

Use 2. Christ is a drawing and a uniting Spirit, then all that are in Christ
should be united; Divisions and wars ^t from congregating Christ.
certainly the divisions now in Britain cannot be of God: The wolf and the
good Shepherd are contrary in this; the good Shepherd loves to have the flock
gathered in one, and to save them, that they may find pasture and the flock may
be saved: The wolf scatters the flock, or if the wolf would have the flock
gathered together, it is that they may be destroyed, then it would be
considered, if a bloody intention of war between two Protestant Kingdoms for
carnal ends, and upon forced and groundless jealousies be from an uniting
Spirit, and not rather from him, who was a Murderer from the beginning.

Use 3. Jews and Turks and civil men, that are but Moral Pagans, are not in
Christ, While civility dangerous.
nor can they have any communion with God, nor be drawn to Christ, because no
man can be in love with God, except he see God as opened and made lovely to the
soul in Christ: Moral civility and Pharisaicall holiness is one of the most
heaven-like, and whitest ways to hell that Satan can devise; Many moral m^n
go, by theft, to hell, Satan by open violence pulls the profane and openly
wicked men to perdition; but he steals millions of civil Saints, honest
married men that have whereon to live in the world plen^ifully, to hell in
their whit^s, as if they were Saints* because civil and clean in the Morals of
the second Table, yet not being borne again, they cannot see the Kingdom of
God; and most men deceive themselves with country Religion and Moralities, but
such be but civil honest Antichrists, and deny there is any need that Christ
should come in the flesh to die for sinners, for they can live honestly for
sinners, and save themselves and not be beholding to Christ for heaven, or
mortification, or faith.

Verse 32. And I if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men. This
drawing of sinners to Christ, is bottomed on Christ's dying on the Cross, and
his dying on the Cross, is an act of extreme and highest love, Joh. 3.16. Joh.
15.13. 1 John 4.9, 10. Hence let us consider a little further what drawing and
alluring power is in the love of God, and what way we may come to the sweet
fruit of the strongest pull of Christ, Which may be consi^dered in 1. The
revelation of the drawing lovelines of Christ's dying. The revelation of Christ's
drawing loveliness and the fu^nesse thereof.
2. The fullness of this loveliness.


For the former, Christ opens himself to us, we cannot discover him first;
and there be two Acts of this. 1. Christ opens the understanding, Luke 24.45.
and the heart, Acts 16.14. He takes away the thick vail, that is over the
heart, 2 Cor. 3.15, 16. and rendereth the Medium, the Air (as it were) thin,
clear, visible, The revelation of Christ's drawing loveliness from Christ
only, and two acts thereof.
as when the Sun expels night-shadowes, and thick clouds, so David's key,
That opens, and no man shuts, Rev. 3.7. removes the door, and the seal
that the first Adams sin puts on the heart, Joh. 14.21. He that loves me
shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self to
him. And Christ can show the Father, The Lord Jesus comes out of his depth and
Ocean of glory, and Yvory chamber, as it were, and the Son of God reveals the
Son of God, as Gal. 1. v. 12. compared with v. 15* 16. shows. He would not
say, Beh^ld me, behold me, Isai. 65.1. and th^n get into a thick cloud and hide
himself, if he had not had a mind to reveal his glory, and to show himself, The
King in his beauty, I^ai. 33.17. all his loveliness, the mysteries ^f his
love, the rosiness, whiteness, redness, comeliness of his face, Cant 5.10. Nor
would the Spouse pray for a noonday sight of Christ, Cant. 1.7. If he could
not offer himself to be seen in his loveliness of beauty. Thus Christ does
make manifest the savor of his knowledge, in the Ministry of the Gospel, 2
Cor. 2.14. When he lets out to the soul the smell of Myrrh, Aloes, of all
the sweet ointments of his death, and wounds; that the soul sees, smells
tastes the Apples of love, in the believed mercy, free grace, satisfied
justice, peace reconciled with righteousness, purchased redemption in his
blood, and he stands behind the wall of our flesh, and so is called, Our
w^ll. Cant. 2.9. Behold ^e stands behind our wall, Or, Behold that is he
standing behind our wall, he looks forth at the window, showing himself,
(...) bewraying himself through the lat^esse: Yet this is not a perfect vision
of God attainable in this life, as the Author of the Bright Star dreameth,
Bright Star, c. 5. p. 38.
I see a man more distinctly in the field and before the Sun, then when he
looks out at the grates or lattesse of a window, and a window behind a wall,
for so we but see Christ in this life.

The compleatnesse of the loveliness is, 1. In that there is no spot in Christ
crucified when he is seen spiritually, The compleatnesse of Christ's love^inesse.
no blemish, no lamenesse, no defect, for an eternal and infinite Redemption,
and an absolute righteousness, more cannot be required, nay, not by God. 2.
Nothing that the desiring faculty and appetite can stumble at; Paul's
determination, the last resolved judgment of his mind, and his ripest
resolution and purpose was to know nothing save Jesus Christ and him crucified,
1 Cor. 2.2. Christ's beauty can fill all the corners and emptiness of the wide
desires of the soul. 3. There is an actual fullness of God spoken of, Ephesians.
3. Paul praying that the Ephesians may comprehend the great love of God. v. 19.
says, That ye may know the love of God that passes knowledge, that ye may
be filled with all the fullness of God. This is a satisfying fullness, and is an
admirable expression. To be filled with God must be a soul-delighting fill. But
2. To be filled with the fuln^sse of God is more, Bright Star c 4. p 30. T^wn
Ass^^tion of Grace, p. 76* 77* 7^. Theolog Germ c. 8. p. 16.
for there is unspeakable fullness in God. ^, The expression is yet higher, That
ye may be filled with all the fullness of God.

Of this fullness, 1. A word of the measure of it. 2. Of the means of it. 3. Of
the sufficiency of it in the kind and nature. Randall in his Epistle before the
Treatise called, The Bright Star, I have therefore observed the ever to be
bewailed Non-proficiency of many ingenious Spirits, who through the policy of
others, and the too too much modesty and temerity of themselves, have precluded
the way of progress to the top and pitch of rest and perfection against
themselves, as being altogether unattainable, and have shortened the cut with a
Non datur ultra, and are become such who are ever learning and never come to
the knowledge of the truth. But for the measure, sure it is not as Antinomians
and Familists dream, complete and full in this life.

Perfection (...) attaine^ble in this life.
1. Because according to the manner and measure of the manifestation of Christ,
and knowledge; so is love and the perfection of believers. This is a truth in
it self undeniable, and granted by the Author of the Bright Star, cap. 5. p.
52. For Christ's excellency and drawing beauty in love goes in to the soul by
the port and eye of knowledge. But 1 Cor. 13.9. We know in part, and we
prophecy in part.

2. Paul disclaimeth perfection as being but in the way and journeying toward
it, Phil. 3.12. Not as though I had already attained, either were already
perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
apprehended of Jesus Christ. Now this perfection which Paul professes he
wants, is opposed v. 13.14. To his pressing toward the garland, For the price
of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ, Heb. 11, 40.

3. Perfection, such as we expect in heaven, is in no capacity to receive any
farther addition, or accession of grace or glory; nor is there a growing in
grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, enjoined us
there, as is expressly here in the way to our Country, 2 Pet. 3.14. and to
run our race to the end, Heb. 12.1. and be carried on to perfection, Heb.
6.1. Its true, our good works are washed in the Fountain opened for David's
house, in which our persons are washed; but that washing removes the sinful
guilt, and Law-obligation from them, but not the inherent blot and sinful
imperfection of our works, to make them perfect; for then might we be
justified by our good works, if Christ's blood make them to leave off to be
sins; but that blood hinders them to be imputed to us only, but removes not
their sinful imperfections, as Antinomians say, that so they may make us
perfect in this life: nor does that blood (as Papists say) add a meriting
dignity and virtue to them, by which we are justified by works made white and
meritorious in Christ's blood and merits. God has so portraicted and chalked
the way to heaven, that all the most supernatural acts, even those that have
immediate bordering with the vision of glory, should need a pass of pardoning
grace; and to believe that Christ's grace shall work in us acts void of sin, is
not faith. Therefore we are to believe the pardon of such ere they have being,
and not sanctifying grace to eschew them. It seems to me unbeleeving
murmuring to be cast down at these sins, in such a way as to imagine we can
eschew them, or that grace sanctifying is wanting to us in these; for grace is
not due to sinlesse acts. Nor does the growing in grace which lies on us, by
an obligation of a command, stop the way to the journeying toward perfection
and heaven, nor shorten the cut to heaven, because heaven is not attainable in
this life; but by the contrary, if perfection were attainable in this life, the
man that attaineth it might sit down, rest there, and go not one step farther;
for except he should go beyond the crown, and to the other side of heaven,
and over-journey Christ at the right hand of God, whither should he go? And
those that are ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth,
are, 2 Timothy 3.5. lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God; such as we are
to turn away from; as have a form of godliness, and have denied the power
thereof; and are led away with diverse lusts; and are never entered into one
only degree or step of the way of the saving knowledge of the truth, of which
Paul speaks, and not the truly regenerate, who believe, wit^ Paul and the
Scriptures, that our great^st perfection is to sweat and contend for the
highest pitch of perfection, even that which is beyond time.

4. Those that are perfected, as we hope we shall be in heaven, feed not with
the Beloved among the lillies till the day break, and the shadows fly away;
but the perfectest, the Spouse of Christ, so feeds on Church-ordinances,
Cant. 2.17. The perfect ones have the fullest pitch of the noonday Sun of
glory; it shall never be afternoon, nor the evening or twy-light sky with
them; nor shall any night-shaddow, nor cloud go over their Sun.

5. In the Kingdom of perfect on there shall be no in-dwelling of a body of
sin, no sin, no uncleanness of heart, no turning of the love and liking of the
soul off God; but the perfectest in this life sin, and carry an in-dwelling
body of sin with them; Pro. 20.9. Eccles. 7.20. Job says, chap. 14.4. The
perfectest that beget children are unclean. Romans 7.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 2, 23. 1 John 1.8, 9* 10. 1 John 2.1. What perfection of (...) is in Christ in the life

All that have need of an High Priest at the right hand of God to intercede for
them, have sin, and in so far are imperfect, as all the Saints are, H^^ 7.25.

Love never fails: (...) abundantly, and is filled to satisfaction, that the
(...) I can contain no more of God; and is transformed in (...) of
transcendent light, and highest love, as it were l^st in the deep fountain of
universal and immensurable love, and light; and the creatures soul and love
lives and breaths, rests in the bosom, in the heart, in the bowels of him
who is an infinite mass of love; is wrapped in the sugared floods, in the
honey-brooks, and overflowing waves and rivers of pure and unmixed joy,
sleeps and solaceth it self in the innocent embracings of the glory that
shines, rayeth, and darteth, world without end, out of Christ, exalted far
above all heavens, all principalities, and powers, the souls there are
sweetened, more then sweetened, over-solaced with the noone-day-light of the
Bridegromes glory, having in it the sweetest perfections of the Morning-Sun;
they flee with Doves-wings of beauty after the Lamb, they never want the
actual breathings of the Spirit of glory, they can never have enough of the
chaste fruition of the glorious Prince Immanu^l and they never want his inmost
pr^s^nce to the full; they ^uck the honey, the floods of milk of eterna^l
consolations, and ^ll all empty desires; and as if the soul were without
bottom, afresh they suck again, in acts for ^ternity continued, there be no
such thing here in this life. Yet has Christ crucified in his bosom, the
promise and full purchase of this life on the cross, and holds it out to
sinners to draw them.

5. We have not yet attained to the resurrection of our bodies, but carry about
such clods of death, as the worms must sweetly feed on, and have a seed, and
subject of distempers in our clay-tabernacles; all which we are incapable of in
the state of perfection, when the body shall be more naturally clothed with
immortality, then the greenest and most delitious Rose, or flower, which we
could suppose were growing fresh, green, and beautiful for ever, in such a
happy soil, as the fields that lie on the banks, and within the drawings of
sap from the river of life.

6. We are not masters of the invasion, at least, of temptations of devils, of
men, here.

7. Perfection makes the general assembly of all the Sons of Sion, the
heavenly family is never convened, but in place, country, condition separated,
some borne, some not borne, some w^king, some sleeping in the dust, some in
their country, some in the way to their country.

Now for the means of attaining this f^l^^^se, we have no other known and

and Faith; the one without, and external, and the other within. Under these,
I comprehend all the ordinances of G^d. Familists rejecting Scripture, terming
it an humane devise of Ink and Letters, as Antichrist did before them, they
call their perfect ones, from all acting, praying, hearing the word; yea, from
knowing, apprehending, willing; to a resting on God as mere patients; God as
their form and Spirit immediately acting on them. Familists place their perfect
one^ above all use of Ordinances.
The active annihilation (says the Bright-starre, Chap. 11. page 106.) is a
ceasing from all acts, vanishing of Images, a doing of nothing, and a resting
of all motion, or from doing the exterior will of God, expressed in the Law and
Gospel in their letter. Page 107. Passive annihilation is when the man
himself, and all other things (Meditation, knowing, desiring of God, praying,
and the practice of a holy life) are cast asleep, The active and passive
annihilation of Famil^sts.
and are made nothing. The active annihilation is when the man himself, and
all other things are annihilated, not only sufferingly, as in the passive; but
doingly, I mean by light in the understanding, as well natural, as
supernatural: wherein he sees, and most infallibly knows, that all those
things are nothing, and rests upon this knowledge in despite of feeling. Page
140. Its not best to forsake the passive annihilation, and the fruitive love,
(the loving of God* as our last enjoyed end) depending thereupon, to take in
hand by acts to practice the active annihilation; provided tha^ by simple
remembrance she stand to her part. For there it is, (Page 141.) that the soul
is so transported, enlarged, enlightened, To desist from Monkish contemplation
and to return to a practical life, to Familists, is a work of the old man*
and united to God. There she tastes the chaste embraces, sweet intercourses,
and divine kisses; there she sees her self sublimed, innobled, and glorified
with Angels, at the celestial table. There she relisheth the fruits of her
mortification, the treasures of her repentance, and the comforts of all her
selfe-denials. Page 144.145. To forsake such an experimental union with God,
and that men should leap back to themselves, and re-betake themselves to
their own acts, refuse to endure this emptiness, poverty of Spirit, this
will of God, and all Spiritly intercourse, super-celestiall, or essential
illumination, though indeed the true and divine Wisdom and naked seeing of
God. -- So that by their flying back and returning to themselves, (that is
leaving the contemplative life of Monks, and return to a practical walking
with God) they do no other but far estrange themselves from all poor and
empire all knowledge, and from all union and transformation into God, and so
bide always straightned within themselves, and their own bowels, and in the
fetters of the old man. Now if you ask what it is to put off the old man; the
Theologia Germanica says, Cap. 5. Page 9.10. What it is to put off the old
man, and to be poor in Spirit according to the divinity of Familists.
It is to ascribe neither being, action, knowledge, nor goodness to your
self, but to God the eternal wisdom, -- and thus Man, and the Creature
evanisheth, -- thus ought man to become void of all things; that is, not to
arrogate them to himself; and the less knowledge the creature does arrogate
to it self, it becomes the more perfect: the like we must conceive of Love,
Will, Desire, and all such things, for the less that man does arrogate these
things to himself, the nobler, excellenter, and diviner he becomes, and the
more he does assume these things to himself, so much is he made the more
blockish, base and imperfect. Theologia, Germanica. cap. 14. page 32. that a
man die to himself, it is as much as if you would say as himself, or egoity
should die. Saint Paul says, put off the old man with his works. page ^4. If
it could come to pass that any man might wholly and absolutely cast off
himself; so as that he lived without all things in true obedience, as the
humanity of Christ was, then he should be void^ himself and one with Christ,
and should be the same by grace, that Christ was by nature. -- Page 35. This
also is written, the more selfe-ends and egoity, the more there is of sin and
unrighteousness; and the lesser there is of the one, the greater want there is
of the other. This also is written, What is sin to Familists.
the more that my self does decrease (that is egoity or self^enesse) the more
does GOD in me increase. -- Hence GOD is a Spirit acting, and all in all men,
and for men to ascribe the good to God, and the ill to themselves is obedience,
and to arrogate being, or good to themselves, is sin. So Theologia Germanica
takes away the incarnation of Christ thus, Chap. 22. page 52.53. Yet are there
ways to the life of Christ, as we have already said; when, God is man to
Familists.
and wherein God and man are joined together, so that it may be truly said,
and truth it self may acknowledge it; that the true and perfect God, and true
and perfect man are one; and man does so yield, and give place to God, that
where God himself is, there is man, and that God also be there present, and
work alone, and do, and leave any thing undone, without any I, to ^e, mine, or
the like; wh^re th^se things are, and exist, there is true Christ, and no where
^l^e. -- Its the property of God to consist, and to be without (...) or that,
without selfenesse, egoity, or the like* but it is the ^^^perty of the creature
to seek and will, (in all things (...) does, or leaves undone) it self; ^
and those things which (...) its own, and this or that, here or there.
Theologia (...) Cap. ^9. page 109* 110. He who is illumin^ted with (...) and
divine love, (...) divine and deified man. Th^olog. (...) cap. ^8. page 7^.
Those who are led by the Spirit of God, (...) the Sons of God, and not
subject to the Law, the sen^^ of which words is, they are not to be taught what
they should (...), or leave undone, seeing the Spirit of God which is their
instructor, will teach them sufficiently, neither is any thing to be commanded,
or enjoined them, -- For he that teaches them, commands them, -- they need
no law, by means thereof to get profit to themselves, for they have obtained
all already; and thus Page 70. Christ needed no Law, but was above Law, and
removes Ordinances, etc. Theol. German. cap. 11. page 23. The mind of Familists
touching heaven and hell
The soul of Christ was to descend to Hell, before it could ascend to heaven,
and the same must befall the soul of man, and this comes to pass, when he
knows, and beholds, and finds himself so evil, that he supposes it to
be just, Page 24 25,
he should suffer all, even be damned for ever; and when he neither will, nor
can desire deliverance and comfort, but does bear damnation neither waywardly,
nor unwillingly, but loves damnation and pain, because it is just and
agreeable to Gods will. And (page 25.) when man desires in this hell, nothing
but the eternal good, and understands the eternal good, to be above
measure good, and this is his peace, joy, rest, satisfaction to him; -- this
good becomes man's, and so man is in the kingdom of heaven, -- this hell has
an end, Page 25.
this heaven shall never end; -- Man in this hell cannot think that ever he
shall be comforted again, or delivered; and when he is in this heaven,
nothing can hurt him, -- nether can he believe, that he can be hurt or
discomforted, and yet after this hell, he is comforted, and delivered; and
after this heaven, he is troubled and deprived of comfort. -- Man can do or
omit nothing, by his own means, whereby this heaven should come to him, or
this hell depart from him, -- For the wind blows, where it lists, etc. and
when man is in either of these, he is in good case, and he may be as safe in
hell as in heaven; and so long as man is in this life, he may often pass from
the one to the other.

In opposition to these wicked fooleries, and for further clearing of the
truths formerly proposed, let these Positions for the unfolding of the drawing
lovelynesse of Christ be considered.

The excellency, divinity, necessity of the Scriptures, as the means of our
union with Christ.
Posit. 1. The Scriptures are given by divine inspiration, able to make the man
of God perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works, 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. the
only mean to find Christ, for they bear witness of him, Jo. 5.39. And are
written that we might believe, and in believing have life eternal, Joh. 20.31.
And all that Christ Jesus heard of his Father, he made known to his Apostles,
Joh. 15.15. Genesis 17.1. Psalm. 50 1. Isai. 44.24. Exodus 20.1, 2. Psalm. ^9 7, 8, 9,
10. 1 Cor. ^ 23. Ioh* 3 3^. 1 Cor. 1.23, ^^el ^.1, 2. Psalm ^*9 8. Rom 15 4. Rom
7 7. Z^p^. ^. 1^. Z^ch. 13, 2. Acts 5.^9. Acts ^.5 20. Phil. ^^.^2, 13. Genesis
3.15. Dan 9.24. Matthew. 1.18. Acts 10.43. Psalm 119.129 138.172. D^ut. 4.5, 6. 2
Pet. 1.19. Heb. 4.12. All ordinances are creatures, and not the ultimate object
of faith.
And of these one Apostle Paul who also received the Gospel, not from flesh and
blood, but by revelation from Jesus Christ, Gal. 1.12. 2 Pet. 3.15.16. Acts
9.1, 2, etc. did declare to the Ephesians the whole counsel of God, Acts
20.27. and yet believed and preached no other things then the^e that are witten
in the Law, or in Moses and the Prophets, Acts 24.14. Acts 26.22. And the
Maj^stie, divinity, power, harmony, doctrine, above the reach of flesh and
blood, the and which is not in this side of time and death but beyond both, (as
the places in the Margin witness) do demonstrate that the one Book of the Old
and New Testament can be fathered upon none, but on God only.

Position 2. The Scripture and all the ordinances are but created things, and
not the ultimate object of our faith, and highest and compleatest love, that is
reserved to God in Jesus Christ, yea, the most perfect we read of, Paul a
chosen vessel stood in need of comfort from Titus, 2 Cor 7.5, 6. and the
Saints at Rome, Romans 1.11, 12. and Peter of a rebuke, Gal. 2. and the beloved
Disciple John of the joy and comfort of the walking of the children of Gaius in
the truth, Ep. 3. v. 4, 5. And of a commandment of the Law which forbids
Idolatry, and Angel-worship, Rev. 19.10. Rev. 22.8, 9. and of an Evangelike
precept to believe, and not to fear, Rev. 1.17. and the excellentest and
perfectest member of the body has need of counsel, exhortations from the
lowest member, Romans 12.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Gal. 6.2. 1 Cor. 12.14, etc. and all
the Saints to whom Paul, Peter, James, John wrote, amongst whom there were that
had the anointing, that teaches them all things, must hear and obey many
exhortations, precepts and commandments out of the Law, as Evangelized, then
the most perfect are not above the Law, the Gospel and Ordinances, as Familists
say, else all the New Testament and Canonical Epistles were written to the
Saints for no purpose. But that we may understand this the better, we are to
remember that 1. There is a a twofold happiness of the Saints, one formal,
and another objective. 2. That there is a mediate seeing of God, one by
ordinances and means; another immediate. 3. That there is a twofold will of
God; one that is revealed in Scripture, or the Law of Nature, and that is the
Moral good that God approves and injoyneth to us, rather then the will of
God; this the Familists call the exterior or accidental will of God, because
Gods will, as his essence, should have been entire and selfe-sufficient,
though God had never revealed any such will to Men or Angels, yea though he had
never made the World, or Men, or Angel. There is another will essential in
God, which is not the thing willed, but the essential faculty of desiring, or
willing in God. Now to come nearer the point, the formal blessedness of the
Sain^s is in the act of seeing, knowing, loving, enjoying God, which on our
part are created things, and so empty nothin^s, and are not essentially the
happiness of man, but means by the which we enjoy God our happiness, so the
using of all the means and ordinances are not our happiness. Its true, our
Savior says, Its life eternal to know God, and his Son Christ, Ordinances
not our blessedness, but God only.
Joh. 17. But he means, it is the way and necessary means to happiness, and
life eternal. God in Christ, and in the in-commings, and out-slowings of the
Spirit of glory, or the Blessed one God, in three persons, is the object and
happiness of the Saints, and therefore we are to prefer Christ himself, to
all the kisses, visions, out-slowings of glory, and all ou^ acts of seeing,
lovi^g, and enjoying of God; we may love ordinances, and prize highly, the
vision of God, but God himself, and Jesus Christ, we must not only prize, but
be ravished, overcharged with himself; as the Bridgrome is far more
excellent then his bracelets, chains, rings. In this sense I would in my
heart, and esteem, make away all ordinances, yea, all the honey-combes, all
the apples, all the created roses that grow on Christ, all the sweet results,
and out-flowings of glory, yea, whole created heaven for Christ; Christ God
himself; the bulk, the body, the stalk of the tree of life, is infinitely to
be valued above an apple; yea all the created apples and sweet blossoms, and
soule-delighting flowers that grows on the tree. Now here on earth we are
happy as heirs, not as Lords and possessors, and in an union with the
exterior, and revealed will of God, in believing, fearing, serving God, in
Christ, in a practical union with God, but all this is but the way to the
weell, not the weell it self, and the union with, or vision of God is mediate,
far off, in a mirror, in the image, form, characters, elements, or
looking-glass, of Word, Sacraments, Ministry, Ordinances, of hearing,
praying, praising, but in heaven we see God face to face, that is without
means, or the intervention of messengers, or ordinances, I cannot determine
whether, when we shall know, and see the Lord, in an immediate vision of glory,
our understanding shall receive created forms, intellectual species, images,
characters of the lovely essence, the white, ruddy, pleasant, lovely
countenance, of that desirable Prince, the Lord Jesus; its a nicety not for our
edification, sure Christ shall infuse and pour in into every vessel of glory,
so much of himself, his presence, lovliness^, image, beauty, as from bottom
to brimme, the soul shall be full, and who knows what the eternal milkings,
the everlasting intellectual suckings of the glorified ones are, by which they
draw in, and drink from the honey-combe of uncreated glory, and the deep,
deep fountain and river of endless life, the streams of joy, consolation,
love, fruition of Jehovah, the soul being the channel, whose banks are
eternally green with glory? what are the emanations, the out-flowings of
blessedness, from the pure essence, and bright face of him that sits on the
throne? and what can these in-commings, and the eternal flowings of the tide
of that Sea of matchless felicity be? who knows? Come up and see, can best
resolve; come up and drink, be drunk and giddie, and satiated with glory, and
move no curious question of that fruition of God. Christ will solve all these
doubts, to the quieting of your mind, when ye come up thither; nor is it
needful to say, that there is a vision of God in this life, which is heaven,
and all the heaven we shall ever have, and this vision is without receiving
any images, forms, characters of God, because it is purely spiritual, and
abstracted from all acts of imagination, and in it we are mere patients, not
agents, God pouring the immediate brightness of his own essence in us:
truly, this is to be wise above what is written, and I crave leave to doubt,
if Familists have the images and species of this opinion from the Spirit of
God. For that spirit is a Spirit of sobriety, and the most spiritual and
extaticall visions that the Prophets, the men of God were taken up with; in
them all, to me, there seems to be visions of forms, images, characters, a
Throne, Angels with six wings, smoke, a woman clothed with the Sun* etc. A
pot toward the North, a cloud and a fire enfolding it self, -- a color of
Amber out of the midst of the fire; but a vision of God immediate in this life,
and that ordinary, without forms, images, without Word, Sacraments, Ordinances,
I know not, I understand it not.

Pos. 3. The Monkish conceit of the excellency of a contemplative life
separated from all obligation to duties of the second Table, The rise of
Familisme.
above the practical life has been the first seed of wicked Familisme; the
Authors of both these books called Theologia Germanica, and The Brighs Star
being professed Papists, though Mr. Randall extol both as pieces of rare
price, and Doctrines suiting only for the perfect (as if the Scripture were not
such a piece) yet professed gross Idolatry and the adoring of the wood of the
Cross, is in The Bright Star, cap. 19. and diverse other Popish principles are
in both.

Pos. 4. There is a twofold fulness of loveliness in Christ; one attainable in
this life, the other reserved for the life to come. The full and highest pitch
of the drawing loveliness of Christ, I think excludes all Ordinances,
Scripture, Sacraments, and means we now use. Because Old Monks and late
Familists make no heaven, but in this life only (as if a Monks coul were the
very crown of eternal glory) and say the Resurrection is past; as their
Fathers Hymeneus and Phyletus said, and doubt of the immortality of the Soul;
therefore they, that they may be true to their own principles, must say that
there be a number of perfect men, that are above and higher then Law, duties,
ordinances, teaching of men, ministry, because these are for the unperfect and
unregenerate, (and the Monks and Familists are not such, but do already enjoy
God, in a fruition of Glory) But the Scripture says, No ceasing of the use of
Ordinances in this ^ife.
That means, ordinances, are ever in use in this life, and only excluded from
the life to come. 1 Cor. 13.8. Charity never fails: But whether there be
prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease,
whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. Ver. 9. For we know in part,
and we prophecy in part. 10. But when that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part shall be done away. v, 12. For now (in this life) we see
through a glass darkly. But then (in the life to come) face to face: Now I
know in part, but then I shall know, even as also I am known. And that this is
a Parallel between this life and the life to come, is clear from the 1 John
3.2. Behold now we are the Sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we
shall be; but we know when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall
see him, as he is. 2. The life to come is holden forth Revel. 21.22. to want
all Ordinances. And I saw no Temple therein, (says John when he saw the New
Jerusalem) for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it. Nor
is there any ignorance there, Rev. 22.5. And there shall be no night there, and
they need no Candle, neither light of the Sun, for the Lord God gives them
light, and they shall reign for ever and ever. What ever any say of a personal
reign of Christ on earth, the words prove that while that life come, all the
regenerate here have need of a Temple, and Ordinances, so long as there is
night and darkness, and use for Sun and Moon; so the date of Church ordinances
is holden forth, Cant. 2.16. My well-beloved is mine, and I am his, he feeds
among the Lillies. 17. Until the day break, and the shadows flee away. Then
there is a night on the Church, and need of the Moon light of Ordinances, so
long as Christ by his Ministry remains in the Shepherds tents, feeding his
flock in the strength of the Lord, and holding forth his presence to his
justified ones, spotless and fair through the imputed righteousness of
Christ; as Lillies, while the fairest and most desirable day of that
illustrious and glorious appearance of Christ dawn, and Paul clearly expounds
these words, Ephesians. 4. showing the term day of Christ's reign, in his Saints,
by the Ministry of the Gospel, and that the Saints and body of Christ, are but
in the way to be perfected and edified, by Pastors and Teachers, verse 13. Till
we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
Hence Saints are not perfected till that day. 2. The body of Christ is low of
stature, capable of growing, the brides hair grows, she is not of a perfect
^all stature, but like a young girl not yet fit for Marriage to the Lamb, Till
we meet all in the unity of Faith: So I know no active anihilation, no
evanishing of, and ceasing from, all acts of the will of God revealed in the
law and Gospel; that is, from praying, hearing, meditating, loving, desiring,
longing after Christ, till the day that the shadows flee away; Then I
confess I shall have no leisure to read on the book of the Old and New
Testament, or to attend Preaching, Sacraments, or other ordinances, because I
need no mirror, no portrait of Christ, no message of Ministers, when I see and
enjoy himself. 3. All who have God for their Father, and need daily bread, and
are clothed with a body of clay, are to pray for remission of sins, not to be
led into temptation, or sinful omitting of duties; all for whom the blood of
Jesus is shed, are to declare the Lords death till he come again. What ceasing
then from duties of Law, Love, the Spirit, and Christ is this? where is this
fancied annihilation to be dreamed of? Scripture knows it not.

Pos. 5. There is a fullness of loveliness in Christ, that is begun in us, by
possession and title in this life, but never perfect till the life to come, in
which there be these 1. Union. 2. Fruition. 3. Rest. 4. Satisfaction. 5. Sense.
6. Living and acting in Christ. 7. Loving and solacing of the soul, of which
to hold forth more of the drawing of Christ, we say.

Pos. 6. Christ's inviting us to come to him, and that before we can invite him,
speaks union. 1. Such an union as faith can make, What an union there is
between Christ and the Saints in this life.
which arises not to the pitch of sight, and immediate fruition, for its the
union of those that are absent one from another, in regard of fullness of
presence. 2 Cor. 5.6. Knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we are
absent from the Lord, John 16.7. Nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
expedient that I go away. Luke 19.12. He said therefore a certain Nobleman
went into a far country, to receive for himself a Kingdom, and to return.
Yet it is the union of those that are so near as the house and the guest, or as
two friends that tables together, Ephesians. 3.17. Ioh. 14.23. Rev. 3.21. 2. Its an
union of fruition, for Christ in some measure is enjoyed in this life, yet so,
as the fruition is in part, not complete and full in degrees as it shall be in
the life to come; it is there for both a fruition of rest and of motion; of
rest, in regard of the present fruition; of motion, in regard of advancing in
the way to a complete fruition; so as is in a journey, The soul enjoying
Christ here, both at rest, and in motion.
in regard of practical love, and at its home in regard of love and union of
fruition; so the soul is both satisfied with bread, and hungers no more, Isai.
55.2. but delights it self in fatness and thirsts no more, having a
present sense of complac^ncy and content in the water of life, Joh. 4.14. and
also the soul is so far forth not satisfied, and its thirst not quenched,
but that it hungreth and thirsts for a fuller union and an immediate
fruition, in which regard the soul is both abroad in its way and motion to
have more of Christ, and at home, and at rest, in regard it is fully satisfied
exclusively, not inclusively; because this satisfaction excludes and
anihilateth all choice of another lover then Christ, and denies all deliberate
comparing of Christ with any other lover, as holding and prizing him the chief
of ten thousand, and resolving never to fix the desire on another Husband or
Lover but Christ, as Cant. 3.4. It was but a little, that I passed from the
watchmen, but I found him whom my soul loves; I held him, and would not let
him go, until I had brought him into my mothers house, and the chamber of her
that conceived me. Finding and holding of Christ, is as much as there is
satisfaction and rest in the fruition of him; and yet the Spouses aim to go
hand in hand on a journey to the house of the high Jerusalem the mother of us
all; which with submission I conceive the Spouse calls her Mothers house,
does clearly prove that she is not perfect, but in a motion; not yet at her
journeys end, till she come with Christ to the Palace of the Princes daughter,
the Bride the Lambs wife, Revel. 21.10, 11, 12. Hence we see how true that is,
that the desires are swallowed up into the bosom of infinite Jesus Christ, as
a little brook is swallowed up when it comes into the Ocean, and yet the
desires remain: They are swallowed up in Christ in that the soul is at home,
being quieted and perfected in Christ, and are no more restless and pained in
the journey toward Christ; but as heaven is begun on earth, so has David
quietness of mind, and breaks forth in praises, That the Lord gave him
counsel to choose God himself for his portion, Psalm. 16.5, 6, 7. So goodly and
pleasant is the heritage; And now there is no more desire for Christ as a thing
absent, and the thirst is swallowed up in Christ, the soul thirsts no more,
Ioh. 4.14. How the desi^es are swallowed up in Christ, and how in him they are
perfected.
And yet the desire remains both in the sweet complacency and liking of the
Saints, delighting in present fruition, and also in an act of longing for the
highest pitch of degrees of union, just as in the act of drinking, thirst is
half swallowed up in begun satisfaction, and thirst remains in a liking, and
a farther desire of a perfect cooling, and refreshing overcomming of a full
quenching of the appetite.

Pos. 7. Yet can it not be said, but here is a begun satisfaction, for Joh.
4.14. Christ enjoyed is a draught of the water of life freely given Revel.
22.17. That whosoever will, may drink of the water of life freely Joh. 7.37. In
the last, and great day of the feast, The abundant satisfaction for the soul
in Christ, illustrated in five expressions.
Jesus stood, and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and
drink. 2. Not a drink only is offered, but a well, a fountain. Psa. 36.9. For
with thee is the fountain of life; a fountain is more then a drink, because
the whole is more then the part. But 3. every thirsty man cannot have a
fountain within him, but yet it is so here, Joh. 4.14. But the water that I
shall give him, shall be in him a well of water, springing up to life eternal.
And 4. the Scripture rises higher, even to a river, and abundance of fatness.
Psalm. 36.8. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house,
Hebr. (...) they shall be drunk with the fatness of thy house. Its a river of
sweet oil and fatness, that over-joyeth the soul; thou will give them to
drink of the river of thy pleasures: A river of which every drop is joy, and a
whole well of pleasures must be a Sea of delights. But grace must make the
soul a capacious vessel, when not a fountain, but a whole river; yea rivers
of life are within the soul: So Christ, Joh. 7.38. He that believes on me, as
the Scripture has said, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.
Yea, 5. That no expression might be wanting, The peace and righteousness of
believers, is as the waves of the Sea; the Sea is more then a River, its the
lodging that receives all fountains and rivers in it, Isai. 48.18.

Pos. 8. There must be much sense of God, in the fruition of Christ; because
believing, though we see him not, (as we hope to see him) causes joy
unspeakeable and full of glory. 1 Pet. 1.8. Thus a high tide, a flood of joy
and glory, a rich portion of an antedated heaven, comes down on the heirs of
heaven before hand. Psalm. 63.5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and
fatnes; a rich feast of only marrow and fatnes, and a satisfying table holds
forth a great banquet, abundant and glorious; such as is made at the marriage of
a great Kings Son.

Positi. 9. And this is not a ceasing from all actings of the soul, because
there is an acting and living in Christ. 2 Cor. 3.18. But we all with open
face, beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
same image from glory to glory, as it were by the Spirit of the Lord. 1. The
veil, The wonderfu^l charge and new beauty the soul acquireth by an union
with God, in this life.
that by the laws ministry, which can darken, but not inlighten, in the gospel
is removed; and we with uncovered face see God revealed in Christ, in the
brightness of the gospel-day. 2. We see, behold and enjoy glory: heaven
darteth in the rays, and beams of God in Christ, at our soul. 3. This is a
changing glory: precious stones in the night-darkenesse cast out light, but
bring them before the Sun, and the beams and light of the Sun changes
them into a greater measure of resplendencie, and shining irradiation: we
seeing the unspeakeable resplendencie, and heavenly glancing of divine
majesty, in the mediator Christ, are transformed and changed, into the Lord
Jesus, his beauty of holiness; the Gospel Light makes us holy, as he is
holy: as there is beauty in the feathers of a Dove; but when the Sun
illuminateth, and shines on them, they carry the glanceing of silver and
golden feathers, yet it is but a show: And so red and white roses of themselves
have excellent beauty; but set them between you and the Sun, and they are far
more beautiful: And the eastern sky of it self, is but a dark thin
formlesse air, that ye can scarcely behold and see; but when the Sun rises,
and shines upon that sky, it does create and beget the fairest and most
beautiful color of red, and aizure, that is possible; for no bodily creature,
casts a fairer and a sweeter resplendencie and color, then the morning-red
and purple-skie: So when the glorious Son of righteousness Christ, shines on
Saints, in the morning daylight of the Gospel, he creates the image of the
glory of God in the soul, and changes them into a luster and beauty fairer
to Christ's eye, then the Sun, or the red morning sky; now the Sun, by
beholding any creature cannot change that creature into another Sun; but Christ
beholding his bride, and the bride beholding with the eye of knowledge, and
faith, in the rays and beams of the Gospel Light, is changed into the
glorious image of Christ. Cant. 6.10. Who is she that looks forth as the
morning, as Aurora, the first birth of the young day, when the Sun casts
golden beams, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun. 4. We live and act in
Christ, and are changed from glory to glory; its but a growing change by
degrees. Then the kingdom of heaven and glory is not in this life, nor hell in
this life, as these dreamers say; the conditions of happiness, and misery,
that follows Lazarus, and the rich glutton, The Familists heaven and hell
refuted.
after they die, and are buried. Luke 16.22, 23, 24, 25 say the contrary. 2.
There is such a gulf between heaven and hell, that there is no passage, no
sailing, nor posting between the one and the other. Luke 16.26. as Familists
imagine. 3. That Saints should believe they can never be delivered, nor
comforted; in the hell they are pained with all in this life, when yet God has
promised to them in their saddest nights, deliverance and comfort; is against
the faith and lively hope of the Saints, and a sinful unbelief; and the man
in sin cannot be as safe in a hell of sin, as if he were in heaven. 4. Hell is
a condition of sinning and blaspheming of God, but to desire nothing, but the
eternal good, and to understand the eternal good to be above measure good, is
not a condition of sinning, but of happiness, and holiness, and so cannot be
hell. 5. These two conditions, sort not with the everlasting fire prepared for
the Devil and his Angels; and life eternal prepared for the blessed of the
Father. Mat. 25. But to return, if life be the greatest perfection of being,
the believer in Christ must enjoy an intellectual life, in Christ, We lose not
our selves in enjoying Christ.
and live, see, know, enjoy God; and though the enjoying of Christ, be the
highest degree of self-denial, and the man loose himself in Christ; that is,
his sinful and fleshly, I, egoitie, and selfinesse in Christ, yet he loses
not, but finds in in Christ, his sinlesse created self, his self perfected,
with that high and supernatural ornament of Christ living in him. It is also
most true, self, as all created beings are but mere dependencies on God: as
the beams of the Sun are but fluxes, results, and issues, that have no being;
but in the Sun, sure creatures depend more in their being, God is not the being
of things as Familists say.
and working on God; then accidents depend on their subject: but it is nothing
less then blasphemy, against all reason and common sense, and subverteth all
the Scriptures of God, to say that God is formally all things, that God is man,
A holy man is not God incarnate or deified, as Familists blasphemously say.
that God is the Spirit and form that acts in all, that a holy man is God
incarnate, and Christ God man, and that Christ the Mediator is nothing; but God
humanized, and man Godded, and deified, and that Christ dwelling in a believer
by faith, and the inhabitation of the holy Ghost, is but God manifested in the
flesh of every man. This destroys many articles of Faith (as Familists care
not boldly to subvert all Scriptures) for Christ then is not true man, borne of
the seed of David, and he is not God blessed for ever, in one person. 2. All
creatures and created beings compared with God, How creatures h^ve no being,
being compared with God, and yet have truly a borrowed being.
the first being of himself subsisting, and the infinite God may be denied, to
be beings comparatively: And so our created self is nothing, to wit, nothing
in dignity, or excellency beside God, or nothing in the kind of a being that
essentially is of it self: as God is in genere entis per essentiam, yet man is
a being in the kind of being by participation, in genere entis per
participationem; man compared with God, is a poor, worthless, sorry,
little-nothing, a weeping, melting, evanishing Cipher. Yea, sweetest
ordinances, because its but created sweetness that is in them, are near of
blood to nothing, and in comparison of God mere shaddows; that cannot bottom
the immortal soul; and nothing, and partake of vanity common to all
creatures. So the Scripture says, Man at his best state is altogether vanity.
Psalm. 39.5. Behold, thou have made my days as a hand breadth, and mine age is
nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity
Esai. 40.17. All nations before him are nothing, and less then nothing, and
vanity. Yet a heathen may say and think, and demonstrate by reason, that
self, and man, and all the world are less in incomparison of the infinite
God, then nothing to all things, a drop of water to the Sea, the shadow to
the body, a peny-torch to the light of ten thousand millions of Suns in one;
and yet be as far from selfe-denyall, Creatures without sin may desire to
keep, and to seek their sinlesse being and themselves.
from putting off the old man, and mortifying the lusts of the flesh, as light
is from darkness. It is most vain to say as its the property of the creature
to seek and will it self, and its own, and this or that, here or there: as it
is the property of God to be without this or that, without selfiness, egoity,
or the like. Because every thing created, even worms, frogs, trees, elements,
such creatures as beget creatures like themselves; they have such a sweet and
natural interest in being, that without sin or deviation from law, or rule, or
any leading, or directing principle of nature, they desire themselves, their
own being: and when they cannot keep being in themselves, they desire to keep
it in the kind, by propagation, and will fight it out against all contraries,
and enemies, to preserve their own being, though but borrowed from God, and I
know no sin they are guilty of, in so doing; nor was Christ's conditional desire
of life, and deprecating death, any whit contrary to innocent selfe-denyall. 2.
The Lord seeks himself and his own glory, and made all things for himself,
God seek^th himself and his own glory most of all, witho^t any impea^hment of
his spotless holiness.
even the wicked for the evil day. Prove. 16.4. And that is a most holy and
pure act, which God ascribes to himself. Esai. 43, 21. This people have I
formed for my self, they shall show forth my praise.

Now in all dwelling in Christ, there is a continual acting of life, by
believing, joying, resting in God. As Phillip says, John 14.8. Lord, show us
the father and it suffices us. Here life seeks a soule-satisfying union with
life, for life is only a satisfactorie object to life. Living things seek no
dead things as such, to be their happiness, if reason do rightly act them,
and God as revealed in Jesus Christ, is that in which the Saints find a soul
sufficiency for themselves; and the act of seeing God in Christ whether in this
life, When the soul injoyeth Christ it acts in Christ.
or in the life to come, is an act of life, for the soul lives in the Ocean,
Sea, and bosom of a fair eternal truth. But does it act there? yea, it does,
and the Scripture expresses its acting; by seeing God, drinking the fountain
of life. Then the soul thus in Christ drinks in love, and milketh and
sucketh in the soule-reioycing irradiations of Christ, and Christ letting out
the breathings of the sweetness of his excellency on the face of the soul
draws and sucketh in reciprocally acts of admiration and wondering, Cant.
2.8. The voice of my beloved, behold he comes leaping upon the mountains,
When the soul injoyeth Christ, Christ draws admiration and love out of it.
and skipping on the hills; behold is a word of wonder, 1 John 3.1. Behold what
manner of love the father has bestowed on us. Not love only, but the manner
and the kind of the Fathers love in Christ, is a worlds wonder, and 2 Thessalonians.
1.10. Christ when he comes shall be wondered in them that believe. 2. Then
again when we see, and enjoy the drawing loveliness of Christ; he as the
fountain and well of life, powers in, in our intellectual love, and in the
glancings, and rays of our understanding, acts of divine light, lumpes of
fresh love from the spring of heavens love, and the soul opens its mouth
wide, and takes in the streams of Christ's nectar, honey, and milk, his
consolations, and love breathings; and in his light we seeing light, and in his
love, feeling love, he makes out light and love (as it were) coeternall with
borrowed eternity; and we go along with the out-shinings of Christ's bright
countenance, to shine in borrowed light, to flame in borrowed coals of love;
and as Christ is said, to feed his flock among the Lilies, the garden of
Christ, his Church being the common pasture for the lambs of the flock; so he
feeds the souls of the Saints that enjoys him, with the marrow, fatness, and
dainties of his light, and love that shine in his face, even as the oil feeds
the lamp; but with this difference, Christ's dainties are not lessened, because
we feed upon them, as the oil is consumed with burning.

Pos. 10. There is a living and solacing of the soul in Christ, even to
saciety in this enjoying of Christ.

Hence, 1. Love gives strong legs, and swift wings to the soul, to pursue an
union with Christ. Christ's beauty and excellency of it self inviteth comers.
Love puts the hand to the bottom of the desire, and draws with strong
coards, the lover to it; we have heard of Christ's invitation, Come to me. But
suppose Christ had never outed his love, in such a love-expression, Come to me.
Christ himself is such a drawing object, that beauty, the smell of his
garments, his mountain of myrrh, and hill of Frankincense, the Sea and rivers
of salvation, that capacious and wide heaven of redemption are intrinsecally,
and of themselves crying, drawing, and ravishing objects: as gold is dumb and
cannot speak, yet the beauty and gain of it, cries, Come hither poor, and
be made rich.

2. Loves wings move sweetly, Open my sister, etc. My head is full of dew, and
my locks with the drops of the night; there is no dumb and silent violence so
strong, so piercing as Christ's love.

3. When the soul in any measure comprehends this love, the Soul is filled
with all the fullness of God, Ephesians. 3.19. The soul filled with God is so far
above created lovers that they lose all capacity to reach it.
Hence must follow a stretching out of the soul to its widest capacity and
circumference, being filled with God, and the fullness of Christ, that all
created objects, because of their littleness and lowness, and the souls
stretched out and wide capacity, looses proportion with the soul; as if a man
were in the top of a Castle higher then the third region of the air, or near
the sphere of the Moon, should he look down to the fairest and sweetest
meddowes, and to a garden rich with roses and flowers, of all sweet colors,
delitious smells, he should not see any sweetness in them all; yea, the
pleasantness, color, and smell of all these, could never reach his senses,
because he is so far above them. So the soul filled with the love of Christ
is high above all created lovers, and they so far below the souls eye, that
their loveliness cannot reach or ascend to the high and large capacity of a
spiritualized soul; as the light of a penny-candle put in a house of some
miles in length, in breadth, and height, in a dark night, should not be able
to illuminate all the house, and render the air of a mile in quantity,
lightsome and transparent, as the daylight Sun would do.

4. Because the glory of Christ's beauty seen and loved, changes the soul
into a globe or mass of divine love and glory, The soul overcomed with the
love of Christ.
as it were by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Cor. 3.18. Therefore the soul sees
Christ so near in his love-embracements, and close inchaining of Christ's left
arm under the souls head, and the right hand embracing it, that it cannot see
it self, it cannot see another lover, it can see nothing but Christ's
faireness, hear nothing but the beloved's voice, taste nothing but his Aples
of love, his Flagons of wine, can smell nothing but his Spicknard, and precious
ointments; so that the soul is clothed with Christ, and his love, and can but
breath out love to him again; and Christ infuseth himself in his sweetness
and excellency, so as the believer is apprehended by Jesus Christ, Phil. 3.12.
violently, but sweetly and strongly drawn in and holden in the Kings house of
Wine, Cant. 2.4. Sickned and overcomed with love, Cant. 2.5. Cant. 5.8. chained
and compelled, 2 Cor. 5.14. wounded with the arrows of love; so as death, the
grave, Hell, Angels, things present, or to come, cannot lick these wounds, nor
embalme, or bind them up, or cure them, Psalm. 45.5. Revel. 6.1.2. Cant. 8.6.7.
Romans 8.38.39. Yea, the soul must yield over it self; as a Spouse under the
power of her husband, and lose her self, and her fathers house, in such a deep
Ocean of delights of Love's stronger then wine, Psalm. 45.10. Cant. 5.1. Cant.
1.2. As melted, dissolved, and fallen a swoune in Christ, Cant. 5.6. and
therefore needs in that swoune, to be recovered with the flagons of the wine
and aples of his consolations, Cant. 2.4.

5. Nor can Jesus Christ but tenderly, lovingly, and compassionately deal with
his beloved; Insinuations of Christ's tenderness of bowels to sinners.
for Christ must draw them, Joh. 6.44. sweetly allure them, Hos. 2.14. Esai
40.1. Take them by the two arms, and teach them to walk, as the mother does
the young child, who has not yet legs to walk alone, Hos. 11.3. Bears
them in his arms, and dandleth them on his knee, Esai 46.3, 4. Exodus 19.4.
They are carried on Christ's warm wings, as the young Eagles by the Mother,
Devt 32.11. they are laid in Christ's bosom, and nourished with the warmness
and the heat of life that comes from Christ's heart, Esai 40.11. carried on
the shoulders of Christ, the good Shepherd, Luke 15.5. and yet nearer Christ,
as a bracelet about Christ's arms; so he wears his Church as a favor, and a
love-token, Jer. 22.24. Cant. 8.6. and engraven in letters of blood upon
Christ's flesh, stamped and printed on the palms of his hands, Esai 49.16. and
yet nearer him, set as a seal upon the heart of Christ, so precious to him, as
to lodge in his bowels and heart, Cant. 8.6. and they dwell in Christ, 1 John
4.13. and dwell in God, and God is love, and so they dwell in the love of
Christ, 1 John 4.16. are kissed with the kisses of Christ's mouth, Cant. 1.2.
and lie between the right and left arm of Christ, Cant. 2.6. Yet all these
takes not the soul off, but inflameth it to duties, for Christ's sake who is
so highly loved; nor are these raptures inconsistent with sinful infirmities.

6. As love moves swiftly to the soul, as a Roe, or a young Heart, (for that
is Christ's pace to his Church, Cant. 2.) so it acts upon the soul
co-naturally, as being a price to it self, apprehending the dignity and
excellency of Christ the beloved. Love is not irrational as a fury, and a fit
of madness, that has no reason, but its own fire. Therefore the secrets of
Christ, the deep and hidden things of his treasures of love and wisdom, must
be opened up to the soul. The soul sees new gold mines, new found-out
Jewels, never known to be in the the world before, opened and unfolded in
Christ. Here is the in-commings of the beams of light inaccessible, the veins
of the unserchable riches of Christ, as if ye saw every moment a new heaven, a
new treasure of love, the deep bottomless bottomes of an ocean of delights,
and rivers of pleasures; the bosom of Christ is opened, new breathings and
spirations of love that passes knowledge, Ephesians. 3.19. are manifested; nor
has the eye seen, nor the ear heard, nor has it entered in the heart of man
to conceive the things that God has prepared for them that love him, 1 Cor.
2.9. yet are they revealed, in some measure, in this life.

7. And it is most considerable, how the soul in loving Christ is not her
own; and in regard of loving, Christ is not his own, but every one makes over
it self to another, and propriety or interest to it self in both sides (as it
were) cease, Hos. 3.3. And I said unto her, thou shall abide for me many
days, thou shall not play the harlot, and thou shall not be for another man,
so will I also be for thee; so the Marriage covenant of grace says: I will be
your God, and ye shall be my people. And the Spouse, Cant. 2.16. My
well-beloved is mine, and I am his. It is true, Christ leaves not off to be
his own, or to be a free God when he becomes ours; but he demeaneth
himself, as if he were not his own, and puts on relations, and assumeth
offices of engagement; a Savior, an Anointed, a Redeemer, a King, a Priest, a
Prophet, a Shepherd, a Husband, a Ransomer, a Friend, a Head, a guide, and
leader of the people, all which are for us: and the soul enjoying Christ,
possesses Christ, and not it self; loves Christ, not it self; lives in
Christ, not in it self; injoyeth Christ, not it self; solaceth it self in
Christ, not in it self; beholds Christ and his beauty, not it self, nor his
own beauty; so that mind, will, love, desire, hope, joy, sight, wondering,
delighting, are all over in Christ, not in it self. And all this further
confirms the point in hand, that Christ crucified, and laid hold on by faith,
is a desirable and a drawing lover.

PART. III. All men.
I will draw all men. The parties drawn to Christ, is the third Article in the
doctrine of Christ's drawing; and they are here called (...), All men. It is a
great question between us, and such as are for universal atonement, and
grace universal, as many Anabaptists in England now are; what is meant by All
men, in which these are to be observed.

1. The state of the question. 2. The mind of the Adversaries. 3. Our mind. 4.
The clearing of places alleged by the Adversaries. 5. The answering of that
principal doubt, what faith is required of all within the visible Church. 6.
The uses of the Doctrine.
Of all these shortly.

The state of the Question.

The Question touches, 1. Gods intention and purpose to save man. 2. In
choosing some to salvation, not others. 3. Gods purpose in sending Christ to dye
for some, not for others.

The first Article is called universal grace, the second conditional; or
which to me is all one, universal election to glory, and so no Election. The
third is, the question touching the universalitie of Christ's death, or a
fancied universal attonment made by Christ for all* I cannot particularly
handle all the three.

For the first: God ingageth all men as Christ's debtors thus far; What sparkles
of grace all have.
that it is mercy that they live or have any opportunity of seeking God, what
ever be the means natural or super-naturall; whereas for the sin of Adam God
might by a like justice have destroyed the world and all mankind, vanity is
penally inflicted on all the servants, for treason of the Master against the
King of Heaven and earth, but in Christ there be two mitigations. 1. One is,
that the servants are not destroid for the sin of the Master. 2. That as the
fore-fated Lord is restored, The creature restored from its forfeiture in
Christ. The place Romans ^0 18. have they not heard, etc. is not for universal
grace, and is clearly expounded.
so the sick servants groaning under vanity shall be delivered from that
bondage they come under for the sin of man, Romans 8.20, 21, 22. Hence it is,
though we be outlaws by nature, that now by a privilege of grace from the
Mediator, the Tenants receive and lodge the Master, because Christ has taken
off the Statute and Act of forfeiture. 2. No man living on earth, but he is
beholding to Christ (though many know him not) for common helps of providence,
and experiences do teach him some more of God by nature. 3. The sound of
Christ, God revealed in the Gospel, in the Apostles ministry is declared, and
is gone to the ends of the earth, and to the Nations, Psalm. 19.4. Romans 10.18.
But some say these words, Have they not heard, have relation to v. 14. the
hearing of the Gospel, or the publishing of the glad tidings of the Gospel to
all and every one of mankind, and must be meant of that same hearing.

Ans. It relates to hearing of God revealing himself in the means of
salvation, say the Adversaries. But then the question is, Whether these means
be the preaching of the Gospel, or of the same God revealed as Creator, by the
Sun, Moon, and Stars, who is revealed in the Gospel, and salvation by him. Now
the Sun, and Stars, and heaven declare the glory of God, and sound forth his
praises and salvation through Christ, by this sense, to all and every Nation,
and to every single person without exception; not only when Paul wrote this to
the Romans, but when David penned the 19. Psalm, what difference then between
the Jews to whom God revealed his Testimonies, and the Gentiles to whom God
made no such revelation? Psalm. 147.19, 20. Deuteronomy. 4.33, 34, etc. Deuteronomy. 5.25, 26.
Psalm. 78.1, 2, etc. Psalm. 81* 4, 5. and this sound, if it be the Gospel
preached to as many as see the Sun, and ever when they see the Sun; then at
that time, and to this day, the Sun and Moon, must be sent Apostles and
Preachers, by whose words and Ministry all, and every man, that sees the Sun,
then and now, and to Christ's second coming are obliged to pray to God in
Christ, and to believe, and Faith comes by hearing; Their sound is gone out
thro^gh all the ear^^, R^m. 1 is not a ^t^tion of, b^t an allusion to the place
Psalm. 19 and can be understood of none ^ut the Apostles.
the Sun, Stars, night and day preach Christ, for sure the same hearing of the
Gospel, v. 18. must be understood which is spoken, v. 14.15. for if the one be
an hearing of the Gospel, by the Apostles, which produces faith and salvation,
and the other a hearing of Sun and Stars in the book of the Creation. This
produces not faith and salvation, by the confession of the Adversaries. 2. The
Apostle shall not answer his own Objection. Ver. 18. If all both Jew and
Gentile have not heard the Gospel, its unpossible they can believe, for faith
comes by hearing the Gospel from their mouth who are sent of God; and if they
hear not, they must be excused, because they believe not in Christ, of whom
they never heard. The Apostle must answer, yea, but they have heard the Gospel.
Why? they heard the Sun, and the Stars preach Christ, and salvation by him, to
the farthest ends of the earth, for sure David in the literal and native sense
of that 19. Psalm speaks of such dumb Preachers. Now this is no answer at
all, for Sun and Stars are not sent of God to preach salvation by Christ. 2.
Faith comes not by hearing the creatures preach Christ. 3. The Prophets and
Apostles, not the dumb and livelesse creatures have pleasant feet on the
Mountains to preach peace, as it is verse 14, 15, 16. cited from Isai. 52.7.
Nah. 1.15. But the native sense of the words, v. 18. is but a mere allusion in
Scripture phrase, to David's words Psalm. 19. It is neither citation nor
exposition of them, but an using of Scripture language in comparing the Gospel
to the Sun, the sound of the Gospel preached to the sound of the glory of the
Creator in the works of heaven and earth, to show how ample the preaching of
the Gospel under the New Testament is; to wit, that it is not preached to one
Nation of the Jews only, as of old; but to all nations, to the Jews, and to
the foolish people, by whom the Lord provokes the Jews to jealousy, as is
clear, v. 19, 20. and that voice (...); their voice is gone to the ends of the
earth, is the voice of the twelve Apostles, of the Lamb, who preached the
Gospel to Nations of all kinds, to Jews and Gentiles, its not the voice of the
creatures, the heaven and earth, but a mere allusion to that voice, Psalm. 19.
for the words have no sense otherwise, for the Apostle avoucheth the Gospel is
preached, the promise of salvation published to all that call on the Lords
Name, v. 12. Be they Jews or Grecians, that is, Gentiles, and believe they
must, or else they cannot pray, and needs they must hear, or then they cannot
believe, and hear they cannot except God send Preachers. But God has sent
Preachers with pleasant feet to both Jews and Gentiles, as the Prophets Isaiah
and Nahum f^retold, v. 13, 14, 15. and they have not all obeyed, v. 16, 17, 18.
But it may be said, They have not all heard the Gospel preached, this must
certainly excuse the Gentiles if they believe not, having never heard of
Christ, how can they believe, as it is v. 14. Its a rational excuse, I cannot
sin in not believing, the Gospel, says the Gentile; yea, and Christ frees them
from the sin of unbelief also, Ioh. 15.22. If I had not come, and spoken unto
them (and so if they had not had a Lord Speaker from heaven) they had not had
sin. That is, they should have been free of the Gospel-sin of unbelief; but now
they have no cloak for their sin. Now they cannot say, Lord, we cannot believe
a Gospel, never spoken to us by any, nor heard of, by us. But sure the Jews
heard these creatures and works of God that preached his glory, Psalm. 19.6. And
if they preach Christ objectively, as Amyrald, and other Arminians fancy; then
the not hearing, and not obeying the Gospel thus preached, had been their sin,
though Christ, or his Apostles had never spoken the Gospel, which is contrary
to Christ's word, Ioh. 15.22. And contrary to Paul, how shall they believe in
him of whom they have not heard, by the preaching of a sent Minister, who
subjectively, and vocally must preach the Gospel.

How all have sufficient grace.
But to return to the state of the question. 4. So much of God is revealed to
all, even to those who never heard of Christ, as serves to make all unexcusable
for that knowing willingly, and knowingly, they glorify not God as God, Romans
1.19, 20, 21. 5. All within the visible Church, have means sufficient in their
kind, in genere mediorum externorum, to save them.

No salvation without the Gospel preached.
6. As none can be saved by the light of nature, nor ever any used, or could use
it so far forth, as to improve it for their sufficient preparation, to receive
the tidings of the Gospel, either from Men, or Angels sent to preach to them;
or by any inspiration, bringing the sense, or things signified in the Gospel:
so saved they cannot be, by any name under heaven, but by the Name of Christ;
that is, Christ named, preached, and revealed in the Gospel. Act. 4.10, 11, 12.
Joh. 14.6. Heb. 11.6. Joh. 5.40. and 1 John 5.12. He that has the Son, has
life, and he that has not the Son, has not life.

7. The question is, whether or no God so far forth wills, desires, 1.
Question Touching universal, grace.
intends, that all and every one, within, and without the visible Church,
Tartarians, and Indians (who never by any rumor, hard of Christ) not excepted,
that he gives them sufficient means and helps of a common and universal
grace; which if they would use well, the Lord should so reward, pro-move, or
increase, whether out of decency, or a congruous disposition of goodness, or
of equity, or of free promise, or any obligation? so far as to send the
Gospel to them, and bestow on them a larger measure of saving and internal
grace; by which they should, if they so would, be converted to the Faith of
Christ, and saved? We deny, Arminians affirm.

2. Question touching absolute election to glory, and so of reprobation.
2. Whether the Lord from eternity (late Arminians are for time-election) has
absolutely, without any provision in, or pre-science, or foreknowledge of good
works; Faith, perseverance in both, or of condition, reason, cause, merit,
qualification in some certain and definite persons; rather then others
predestined, and chosen them to glory and life eternal. And all the means
conducing to this end, and that of mere free grace; because he so wills, or
if the Lord pass no definite, complete, peremptory, and irrevocable decree,
to save some certain persons while he forsees them expiring, and dying, in
faith and holy conversation? Arminians hold, that the Lords decree of election
of men to glory; is general, conditional, incomplete, changeable, while he
forsees they have ended their course in the Faith, and then peremptorily, and
irrevocably, he passes a fixed decree to save such, and not others; we deny
any such loose decrees in the Almighty, and believe that of free grace; he
chooses some absolutely without conditions in them, or respect to any good
foreseen to be in them, rather then in others, because He has mercy on whom
he will, and hardens whom he will. Romans 9.17.18.

3. Upon this general, indefinite, revocable, and conditional good will and

whether or no did the Father give his Son, and the Son dye for all, and
every one; intending absolutely to impetrate and obtain to all, and every one
of mankind, remission of sins, and especially, expiation of sin original,
and all sins against the covenant of works; and salvation to them all, both
within, and without the visible Church, and the opening of the gates of heaven;
so as God has laid aside his anger for all these sins, has made all savable,
reconciliable, that notwithstanding of divine Justices plea against men, all
and every one, Arminians are for s^x universalities in the matter of Gods good
will to save and redeem all without exception.
may according to the intention of God be saved in his blood, so they would,
as they may, and can, believe in Christ; we deny, Arminans here affirm.

2. The mind of Arminians. Arminians run upon six Universalities.

1. They say God bears to all, and every man, of what kind soever, an equal,
universal, and Catholic good will; y^a, to Esau, Pharaoh, Judas, as to
Jaakob, Moses, and Peter, An universal intention of God to save al
so as this love is not stinted to any certain persons, precisely, and
absolutely; loved and chosen, to salvation.

2. That there is a Catholic price, an universal ransom, given by Christ,
dying on the Cross, for all and every one, Universal redemption of all.
an Pharaoh, Judas, Cain, all the heathens, Tartarians, Americans, Virginians,
that never heard of Christ, are made savable, and reconcil^iable, and God made
placable and exorable to them, so a^ though they be lost in the first Adam, yet
have they a new venture of heaven; and in Christ's death, the Lord has a
general antecedent, and pri^^ry intention to save all without exception; yet
no more to save Moses and Peter, then Judas and Pharaoh; Yea, that the fruit of
Christ's death, and the effect of it may stand, though all and every one of
mankind, were eternally lost, and not one person saved.

An universal covenant of grace made with all, and every mortal man.

wrath, all the heathen are reconciled and justified by Christ, in his blood;
and all sins now, are against the 1. Covenant of grace, Christ and all
mankind now, begin to reckon on a new score. 2. Though the ship be broken,

Christ the surety of a better Covenant, is made the great vessel, that
ship-broken men, may, if it seem good to Lord free will, swim unto, and so
come safe, the second time, to land. 3. So as there be two Redemptions in
Christ two Justifications by grace. 4. Yet neither the tidings of this new
covenant made with all men, nor this state of reconciliation, or justification,
are ever revealed to the thousand part of mankind; and though all and every one
be under this Law of Faith, and Covenant of Grace; yet is this obliging and
supernatural Law never promulgate to millions of mankind, whom it obliges to
obedience, so far forth as by the good industry* and improving of common
gifts of nature, or rather the hire and merit of men out of Christ, to make a
conquest of the preached Gospel and Christ, free will doing its best.

common gifts, or relicts of nature, and their new sufficient grace, (if they
could give it a name to us) a farther degree of grace, while they conquesse the
Preaching of the Gospel, and the grace of conversion. Yet so are they, (let
Christ do his best) as all may be converted, or not any one at all, but all
lost, and all may persevere in grace and be saved, as not one men shall be
damned, and all may so totally and finally fall away from grace, as not one man

5. It was no blind bargain that Christ made; he knew Christ told down a
definite and certain Ransom, as a told sum of money, every penny reckoned
and laid, and he knew who was his own, Particularly marked between the Father
and the Son.
and whom, and how many, by the head and name, he bought; there is no hazard
that one come in, in the lieu and room of another. Joh. 10.14. I am the good
Shepherd, how is that made good? He has particular care of all the flock, by
the head he knows how many, and who are his; if any be not his, if any be
sick, or lost, or wandered away, that proves a good Shepherd, I know my
sheep, and am known of mine. The sheep that Christ dyed for, are particularly
designed and circumscribed with such nots as are in none other.
I know them, and they know me. Sure it is Relative to that. 2 Timothy 2.19.
Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, the Lord
knows them that are his. Sure, the sheep that Christ dies for, Joh. 10. are
the sheep that he gives his life for, verse. 11. and dies for; and these 1.
verse. 10. That have life in abundance. 2. The sheep known in the Lords eternal
Predestination, and known by Christ in time. 3. Such as he minds to call in,

his own sheep, as he goes before, and they follow him, and know his voice,
verse. 4. and will not follow a stranger, verse. 5. (5) Such as hear not a
stranger, verse. 5. but verse. 27 hear and know the voice of Christ, are known
of him, and follow Christ. (6) Such sheep as are gifted with life eternal, and
shall never perish; and cannot fall away, no more then there can be a greater
then the Father, that can pluck them out of the hands of Christ; for verse.
28.29. the standing of these that shall not be plucked out of the Fathers hand,
depends on the greatness and power of Christ's Father. None can pluck them out
of my hand, (says Christ) Why? The Father, that gave them me, is greater then
all. Then he must be greater then Christ's Father, who plucks one of the Sheep
of Christ out of his hand; and where dwells he who is greater then the Father?
Neither in heaven, nor hell. And for such Christ dyed.

6. He dyed for such sheep, as infallibly believes, because he says, verse.
26. Ye believe not. Why? Because ye; then certainly they should believe, if
they were of such sheep, as Christ dyed for. I shall never believe that this
Reply can stand. David says, and Job says, Thou, Lord, formedst me in the
womb; and the Church, Esai 64. Thou art the Potter, and we the clay; but it
will never follow; therefore God has created none but David, Job, and his
chosen Church, so it follows not here. Christ dyed for his sheep, therefore he
dyed for no other, but his sheep.

1. Because dying of sinners is a work of mere grace, bestowed only on some,
Creation larger th^n Redemption
as all the Texts that ever Papists, Jesuits, Arminians, allege, Resrict ever
these that Christ dyed for, to some certain persons, to believers, the sheep
of Christ, these for whom Christ is an Advocate at the right hand of G^d, etc.
And there is not a Text in Scripture, in Old or New Testament, in which, we
may not limit the persons, on whom grace universal, and redemption in Christ's
blood, are pretended to be bestowed, to the elect and believers only; these
places I except, in which some are said to be Redeemed in profession only, as
may be demonstrated; and therefore this answer of (...) is pe^i^io principii,
and a begging of what they cannot prove And Verse. 2. upon the same reason,
because God created man on the earth, and dyed for men, and for the world (as
the Scripture says) they might infer; as God created not m^n only, but
Angels, beasts, birds, fish^s, trees, Sun, Moon, so Christ dyed not for men
only, but for Angels, Devils, beasts, birds, fishes, trees; yea, for worms.
creeping thin^s, and all, and every creature: for if we regard the free decree
of God, Devils are as capable of Redemption by Christ, as men; if so God had
purposed from eternity; and in regard of the same decree, the Reprobate can no
more be saved, and believe of their own strength, then ston^s of themselves
can be sons of Abraham, except God elevate them above their nature and
Omnipotency effectuate the same.

O he has forgotten me; but that is to say, Christ is not faithful in his
charge, and the Father gave so many th^usands to his keeping; but he loosed the
largest half of them, now to be given of the Father to Christ, must note
Ch^^^ts accepting of the recept of them, by dying for those so given of the
Father to him, for another way of giving, bu^ ^ither in election from
eternity, or of sitting them in time for actual believing, no man knows; but
either ways all given, are raised up at the last day. Ioh. 6.39. and so all
redeemed must either be chosen from eternity, or then in time believe, and so
be raised at the last day; then there can be none Redeemed, but such as are
chosen and saved. Master Moors universal atonement page 4.5. Tells us of a
twofold reconciliation or redemption, on which Christ effected in his own body
with God for men. This is perfect and accomplished fully, so as the Father is
well pleased with his Son, Matthew. 3.17. and this is done by sh^dding of
blood. There is a Reconciliation, Redemption, and Salvation which Christ
effects, by the Spirit, in men to God, and this is by washing and
blood-sprinkling; his proofs after shall be heard. Thus the belgic Arminians,
explain the matter Script. Sinodal. ar. 2. They say the former redemption,
Remonst. Script. Sinod. a^. 2. Redemptio se^ reconciliatio, nihil aliud est

and reconciliation, is the pacifying of the offended party; or such an
action, or passion, by which satisfaction, so far forth is made to the
offended party, that he is willing to return in favor, and grace, with the
offender; and the effect of this reconciliation is the obtaining of the favor
of God, that is the restoring of men to such a state, in which God without
impeachment of revenging justice, according to the tender affection of his
mercy, of new, may, and will bestow his benefits; and transact with man
touching his salvation, and the conditions thereof, after the way, and manner,
seems good to God, whether by a covenant of works, or of grace, or of
commanding faith in God, or faith in an Angel, if so it seem good to him. And
by his law, the affection of saving man, which is in God from a natural
instinct of mercy, does break forth, as it were, in a full and complete
purpose of Gods will to save: now when the impediment is removed, by
satisfaction given to justice; And when Christ has completely performed the
former redemption, The Arminian distinction of a redemption purchased to all,
but never applied, or which may be applied to none, vain and comfortless.
and by his death has obtained this redemption; yet it may fall out, that not
one man be saved. But as we deny not this distinction of salvation purchased,
or the purchased redemption, and the applied redemption, as our Divines
acknowledge Christ to be a Savior by merit, and efficacy; so that the members
of the distinction are different, but that they are separated, we deny: yea,
the distinction, in the Arminian sense, we deny.

1. Because, Christ Redeemer, is a relative person, there is a full redemption
in Christ, but not for Christ, but that he might make over that Redemption to
his poor brethren; there is a purchased salvation in Christ, not to lie by him
like a treasure of silver rousted through not using; but they were so many
heavens and salvations, and so much grace and gracious redemptions to be made
away, as now purchased, and all these Christ disbursed; he was not a Treasurer
who kept from sinners the pensions of grace and glory, that the Father and King
of the Church allowed on his people. Redemption was purchased by Christ out
of-an efficacious intention that it should be applied to Gods chosen ones, not
to keep within himself*
What Christ bought with his blood, that he gave out, and so much the places
alleged by Mr. Moor the Arminian, proves just contrary to himself, Joh. 4.42.
he is the Savior, not of himself to save God, and justice, and the Law; but
the Savior of the world, of poor sinners, not of the Jews only, but of the
Samaritans and Gentiles, as Isai. 49.6. I will also give thee for a light to
the Gentiles. that thou may be my savation to the ends of the earth. This is
the mystery hidden from the beginning of the world, that Christ should be
preached among the Gentiles, Ephesians. 3.8, 9. Now (...) is not a Magazine and
treasure of Redemption to remain within the corners of Christ's heart and his
bowels, but it is the mystery of the New Covenant to be made out to the world
of Gentiles, heirs of the same promise. This heritage Christ never purchased
to keep to himself, and whereas Mr. Moor will have Christ to be 1 John 2. a
propitiation for the sins of the whole world, by obtaining of reconciliation
of God to men; he is far wide, for that place clearly speaks of
reconciliation of this whole world, the New Testament world, if I may so speak;
or Christ's new conquest of the world of Gentiles; so is Christ the Savior and
Redeemer of the world of Gentiles in opposition to Moses, How Christ is the
Redeemer of the world.
the Judges who were Saviors and Redeemers of the people of Israel, who were
but a spot and a poor fragment of the world in comparison of Christ's large
world, God redeemed Israel by the hand of Moses, but never the world; so is
Christ a propitiation for the sins of the whole world, in opposition to the
propitiatory sacrifices of Aaron and the Leviticall Priests (for to these he
alludeth) which were propitiations only for the sins of a bit of the world; but
sure as the Leviticall Sacrifices were offered only in faith for the true
Israel of God, otherwise they were no better then the cutting off of a dogs
neck, in a Sacrifice which was abomination, A propitiation for the sins of the
world by no Scripture or reason, can be a power to transact with men, for
remission of sins in a Gospell-way, or a Law-way.
so were they types of that Sacrifice which was to be offered for the elect
world, which is a whole world of Jews and Gentiles, in comparison of little
Judea. And by what Scripture is a propitiation for the sins of the world, which
is only an acquiring of a new power to Christ to trans-act with men on what
terms he thinks best to pardon sins; this or that way, for faith or good
works, a Redemption of men? Or how is it a taking away the sins of the world,
an everlasting Redemption, a suffering all that men should have suffered, a
bearing of our sins on the Tree; an answering as Surety for the debts of broken
men.

Object. But if Christ purchased no salvation for me, how can I sin in not
resting on Christ for a shadow, for a salvation not purchased to me, is no
salvation at all, but a very nothing.

Ans. If you were to believe first a salvation purchased to you by name, this
Objection were strong, but you are at first and immediately to believe no such
thing, but only that Christ is able to save to the utmost all that come, that
is, that believes, and you, if ye believe. 2. A salvation purchased by Christ
without an efficacious intention in God to apply it to all, and every one is no
less a shadow and a very nothing, then the salvation purchased to all and
every one, and this makes as much against Arminians, as against us. Now sure
salvation is purchased with an efficacious intention in God to apply it to
those only who shall be saved, and the smallest part of mankind. 3. This way
sends me at first to believe Gods secret and efficacious good will to save me
by name, before ever I believe the Gospel, That Jesus Christ came to save all
believers, which is no Gospel Order of believing; and raises in my mind
jealousies against Christ, that he out of his love died for me, but puts
me on a ground of doubting, if he will apply his death to me, except I begin
first to love him and with free will apply Christ, so Christ first extends
raw wishes to save me, but I must extend to him real deeds of applying, by
faith, his wishing and halfe-love to me, and the most real kindness begins at
me, not at Christ.

But say I by what Scripture is a naked power to justify, pardon, wash,
sprinkle sinners, and such a power which may consist with the eternal
perishing of all men, (says Moor p. 5. with the Arminians) an eternal perfect
Redemption, a perfect satisfaction of justice and the Law of God? Are not so
the sins of the world taken away, and yet they remain? Does not Christ bear the
sins of all the world; yet it may fall out, that all the world bear their own
sins, and not one man be saved; yea, as it is, the greatest part of mankind
bear their own iniquities, die in these same sins that were imputed to Christ,
suffer the curses of the Law which Christ suffered for them.

Yea, Mr. Moor says, Gods reconciling of the world, and his not imputing their
sins to them, is the reconciling of all Adams sons in Christ's body before God;
yet Paul and David both say, Blessed are they to whom the Lord imputes no sin.
Moor says, a whole world to whom the Lord imputes no sin, may be under the
curse of the second death. 2. To put reconciling of the world to God, as Paul
does 2 Cor. 5. for the reconciling of Christ in his own body with God, as M.
Moor does, is strange divinity; for it is reconciling of God to man, in stead
of a reconciling of man to God, Heb. 9.14. and cannot be meant of only
reconciling of God in Christ's body, or of obtaining only of redemption without
application. 1. Because the blood of Christ is compared with the blood of Bulls
and Goats, which was offered for the reconciling of men to God, not of God to
men. 2. Because that blood is said to sanctify and purge the conscience from
dead works to serve the living God, which cannot be said of God, but clearly
holds forth, that Christ having offered himself without spot to God, through
the eternal Spirit, those for whom he offers himself, cannot eternally
perish, as M. Moor says p. 5. but that their consciences, by this blood are
purged from dead works to serve the living God.

And the place 1 Pet. 2.24. does not prove that Christ bare the sins of many,
on the tree, 1 Pet. 2.24. explained, and Isai. 53.6. The Lord laid on him the
iniquities of us all.
who are not actually saved by his death. 1. The place says the contrary, and
no such thing, as that the Lord laid on Christ the iniquities of all, and every
one of mankind. 1 Peter restraines it to believers, elect according to the
foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctification of the Spirit --
begotten again unto a lively hope -- who are kept through the power of God by
faith, unto salvation. 1 Pet. 1.2, 3, 4, 5. And there is no color that Peter
speaks of all Adams sons, of all the heathen, because he says, Christ
bare our sins. Which be these? The sins of these that be called to patient
suffering, for well doing, who are to follow Christ, who left us an example of
patient suffering; who when he was, verse. 23. reviled, reviled not again. Now
what? is this the Indians and Tartarians patient suffering, after Christ's
example; to whose ears the name of Christ, and his suffering never came by a
dream, or imagination? 2. The sins of these, which Christ bare on his own
body, on the tree, are these that are healed with Christ's strips, and these
that are returned to the Shepherd, and Bishop of their souls; and are to live
to righteousness, being dead to sin by the death of Christ, who bare their
sins. v. 24, 25. now these are the All that Isai speaks of, c. 53. when he
says 53.6. The Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all. That is, (if we
believe Arminians) of all Moab, Ammon, Egypt, Philistims, Caldeans, Ethiopians,
and all Adams Children, who never heard of Christ; for the thousand part of
Adams Sons never heard of Christ, then are they not obliged to believe in him
of whom they never heard, nor is it their sin, that they believe not, Romans
10.14. Ioh. 15.22. Ergo, they are not obliged to live to righteousness, being
dead to sin through Christ's death; because they never heard of Christ's death.
Far less are all Adams sons healed with Christ's stripes, and returned to the
shepherd, and Bishop of souls: nor was the chastisement of all the heathens,
peace upon Christ. And Esaiah expounds who be these all (...) whose
iniquities were laid upon Christ, v. 8. for the transgressions of my people was
he stricken, and v. 12. he bare the sins of many, as Matthew. 20.28. and 26.28.
The blood which is shed for many, and he made intercession for sinners. What?
does he bear stripes for all the heathen? and is he entered as High Priest for
all Adams sons into the Holy of Holiest, to plead and Advocate for such, as
Cicero, Regulus, Scipio, Cato, such as Pharaoh, Cain, Judas, Julian? If he bare
their iniquities, he must bear their apostacy, and final infidelity: or does
he intercede, for all and every one of mankind. 1 Ioh. 1.2. compared with 1
Ioh. 1.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and Hebrew. 9. He appears for us, ver. 24. for those
that are sprinkled, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and look for him the second time verse,
28. He makes intercession for them that come to God through him, Heb. 7.25.
Who have a High Priest over the house of God, Heb. 10.20, 21, 22. All these and
many other places shows the contrary. And the redemption that is in Jesus
Christ, Romans 3.24. is not a Redemption which might have been confined within
Christ to reconcile God to himself, and which might consist with the final,
total and utter perishing of all mankind. 1. We are justified through this
redemption, and not by the works of the law 2. V. 25. God set forth Christ this
redeemer to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood. 3. That Christ might
appear the justifier of the ungodly. verse. 26. and exclude boasting, by the
law of faith. ver. 27. and be the God of Jews and Gentiles ver. 30.31. so that
it was never Gods mind to imprison a reconciliation, within the Father and the
Son: and leave our heaven at such a dead and cold venture, as the discretion
of indifferent free will; so as it might fall out, if men pleased, that the
surety Christ should die, and all his poor broken friends die eternally, and
suffer the second death also. Arminians turn the Gospel in the sadest, and
bloodiest bargain that ever was, and yet the new English Arminians worse then
their fathers: say they preach not the Gospel of grace, The new English
Arminia^s worse then ^^e old.
nor Christ who preach not their universal atonement, in a grosser way then
ever Arminians did, for. 1. Arminians durst not say Christ died vice, and loco
omnium and singulorum, sed tantum in bonum eorum; he died not in the person,
place, and room of all mankind, but only for their good, as Socinus taught
them: But Master Moore says this right down. page 3. 2. Arminians durst not
say, Christ died and rose again, and pleads as high Priest and Advocate for
all, but only for believers, Mr. Moore says, that for all he rose, and
acquiteth us of all our sins. page 4.

The place, 2 Cor. 5.14.15. does not prove a Reconciliation of all, within God,
as Mr. Moore dreameth. 2 Cor. 5.14* 15. explained.


1. The All that Christ died for, ( if one died for all, then were all dead) by
no reason must be in number equivalent to all that died in the first Adam. Nor
is there any reason, in the text to make all those that are actually made alive
in Christ, and live not to themselves; but to Christ, equal in number, to all
that died in Adam. 1. God gave not Christ to die for heathen, who were never to
hear of Christ, that they might live to Christ. 2. These words, hence forth
know we no man, not Christ after the flesh, nor for the outward privilege of
Jewish dignity, circumcision, or a temporal kindgome, which fleshly dignity
the Apostles sometime knew Christ for, and expected in him; but now this is
taken away, and Christ has died for all,: that is, for Jews and Gentiles,
without respect of any such differencie, for Christ gave his life for the
Gentiles, as well as for the Jews. 3 (...) for All is a word of efficacy, and
holds forth the Lords effectual intention; but if Mr. Moors gloss stand,
there is no effectual intention in Christ to save all and every one. 1 Timothy
1.4. How Christ gave himself a ransom for all.


Nor does the place, 1 Timothy 2.4.6. signify any reconciliation, not applied to
persons, for his being given a ransom for all, notes clearly an interest and
propriety in these, for whom he gave himself a ransom, as Luke 22, 20. for
many, Matthew. 20.28. Matthew. 26.28. So (...), does in all Greek Authors
insinuate, Joh. 6.51. Joh. 10.11. Romans 5.6. such an interest. Mr. Moors
objections removed.


Object. 1. But the reason were frivolous; we are to pray for all, except we
know that God wills salvation to all, how can we with the certainety of faith
pray for all? It must be a doubting faith, and so no faith at all.

Answ. But seeing God will not have Nero, Persecutors, Apostates, Rebellious
unbeleevers, men obstinate against the Gospel, such as Paul was before his
conversion, to be excluded out of our prayers. What certainty of faith have
Arminians to pray for all? Or for the twenty, or hundredth part of all mankind?
This therefore is denied. Christ gave himself for as many, as we are to pray
for, but we are to pray for all without exception. The proposition and the
assumption both are false, nor does our prayers for men, depend on the
certitude of Gods decree of election of men to glory, which is Gods secret will
not known to us, to whom the Lambs book of life is not opened, but on the
revealed will of God, commanding us to pray for all, that sin not to death,
but conditionally, and with a special reserve of the Lords decrees of
Election, and Reprobation; and this in effect, is to pray for the Elect only;
nor am I warranted, by the Word of God, the rule of my prayers, No war^^nt in
the Word to pray for all, and every one, without exception.
to pray for any others. Nor is there promise, precept, or practice in
Scripture to pray for all, and every one of mankind; Therefore I retort the
Argument thus; we are to think God wills so many to be saved, and his Son
to give himself a ransom for so many, as we are warranted to pray for, that
they may be saved, but we are not warranted to pray for all, and every one that
they may be saved, but only for the Elect. Ergo, God will have them only to be
saved and his Son to give himself a ransom for them only.

Object. 2. Judgment of charity is no ground of our prayers. We have no
charity to believe all, and every one shall be saved, nor have we any faith or
certainety in these prayers.

Answ. I may have judgment of charity touching this or that man, to pray for
him; but this judgment is a motive to my affection, not a foundation to my
faith. My faith is bottomed on a word of precept, to pray for the salvation of
all, conditionally, but not for the salvation of any, but for my own only,
absolutely.

Object. 3. God will have as many to be saved, as he will have to come to the
knowledge of the truth; But he will have all to come to the knowledge of the
truth.

Answ. The argument is strong for us; the Apostle speaks of the Gospel Truth;
but he will not have the Gospel preached to Samaritans, Mat. 10. to Bithinians,
and thousands others. 2. He will not open the hearts of housands that hear the
Gospel, because he will, Mat. 11.28. Romans 9.17. and many he blinds, and
judicially hardneth. Math. 13.14. Joh. 1^.37, 38. Esai 6.9, 10. Acts 28.24, 25,
26, 27.

Object. 4. Its uncertain whether ye pray for Magistrates as such, or for
vulgar men as such, and uncertain, whether ye pray for this or that rank.

Answ. It is certain we are to pray for Kings, Subjects, Men, Women, Jews,
Gentiles, reserving the Lords decrees to his own Sovereign liberty.

Object. If we are to pray but for some, because God wills the salvation of
some, he should have said, we are to pray for no man, for the far largest
part of the world are lost.

Answ. This is to censure the Holy Ghosts speaking, not us. Upon the same
ground, a Physician in a City cannot be called the healer of all diseased;
nor a Professor, a teacher of Philosophy to all in the City, because many in
the City dye of the Pest, and the twentieth person remain ignorant of
Philosophy; if God will have all to be saved, that he predestinate to life,
he is rightly said to will all men to be saved, and in that sense, we are to
pray that all may be saved. 2. God, by his consequent will, God will have none
to be saved, by the Arminian way.
desires the far greatest part of the world to be damned. Ergo, By the
Arminian way, he should say, God wills not any man to be saved, nor any to
come to the knowledge of the truth, but that all may be damned: and because
they say, there is in the Almighty an Antecedent natural affection and desire,
that justice may be satifyed in Men and Angels, which affection is in order of
nature prior, and before Gods full, peremptory, and deliberate will of damning
all, that are finally obstinate; as there is a natural antecedent will in God,
to call, invite to repentance, offer Christ to all, and will the salvation of
all and every one, which is before and precedent to his peremptory, complete,
and irrevocable decree of electing to glory, all that God foreseeth shall dye
in the faith of Christ. Upon the same ground, it may well be said, GOD wills
the damnation of all, and every one of mankind, and the salvation and
repentance of none at all, and that Christ dyed upon no intention natural to
redeem, or save any, but upon a conditional and natural desire, that justice
might be declared in the just destruction of all; for sure all Gods natural
affections and desires of justice, are as natural and essential to him, and
so as universally extended toward the creature, as his desires and antecedent
natural affections of mercy.

Object. 5. The sense of the word All, appears to be of Adam, M. Moor
Universal at^onement, c. 11. p. 55, 56.
and all that come by propagation of him. 1. The word Men is used for Adam, and
all his Sons, Hebr. 9.27. (2.) Often in the fullest sense, not regenerated, nor
wholly reprobated, are called Men, Job 11.11, 12. Psalm. 12.1. and 4.2. and
53.2. (3) Believers are called Men, Acts 1.11. 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. In regard of
passions, Acts 14.15. Of carnal walking, 1 Cor. 3.3. Yet they are called
something more, Sons of God. Joh. 1.12. 1 John 3.1. Saints, 1 Cor. 1.1.
Brethren, faithful, Ephesians. 1.1. Christians, Acts 11.26. Some who have heardned
their heart, are called Men, but something more, reprobate, Jer. 6.28, 30. Seed
of the Serpent, Genesis 3.15. Children of Belial, Deuteronomy. 1.3. Of the Devil, Joh.
8.4^. and with an Emphasis, the wicked, Psalm. 9.17.

Answ. In these Grammattications M. Moor shows how weak his cause is, and
how dubious from the word men, and all; for Heb. 9.27. Its said, its appointed
for all men to die, and the Holy Ghost insinuates clearly, that Christ died
for all men that die, in the very next words, v. 28. So Christ was once offered
to bear the sins of many; he says not all men: Observe the change of words. 2.
We deny not but all men in Scripture signifies all descended of the first Adam
by propagation. Ergo, It signifies so here? This is to be proved. 3. What Mr.
Moor means by some not wholly reprobated, I know not, except he make in God
answerable thereunto a whole and complete decree of Reprobation, and so of
Election, and a half, and incomplete decree of both, as Arminians do. Which
Scripture knows not, and removes all certainty of salvation, of
perseverance, joy, comfort, earnest of the Spirit, seal of Spirit. 4. We
contend not that by all men here must be meant believers and regenerated
persons only, and so he fights with his own shadow. 5. He grants believers
are called men, and I hope to prove that the elect and believers, are called
all, and all flesh, and us all, etc. though it be true, believers are called
men, because of their humane passions and carnal walking, and some more, to
wit, Sons of God, Saints, faithful Christians; it follows not, that here
they should be called Sons of God, Saints, because Christ dies not for them as
Saints, but as men, and sinners chosen to life: Else Paul should not say,
Ephesians. 2.1. God has quickened you who were dead in sins, etc. for those whom
God quickneth are something more then dead in sin; sure they are chosen Saints,
new creatures, etc. after they are converted.

Object. 6. All men here 1 Timothy 2.6. intentionally, expressly, principally and
especially is meant of the first sort, Mr. Moor ib.
for natural men, sons of Adam, sinners, unbeleevers. 1. Because this sense
includes all, at first all men, having some in which they are such, and
neither better nor worse then such before they be borne of God, Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3.
Tit. 3.3. Romans 3.9.20.

Answ. We deny not but all men includes unregenerate men, but Master Moor
proves idem per idem, the same thing by the same thing. All men must be meant
of all Adams sons, Why? because all includes all, at first, all men; That is,
all includes all, but not all men distributively, all and every one without
exception. 2. Its denied that all men includes all as unregenerate, or under
that reduplication, it is meant of all men unregenerate as fallen under the
good will of GODS Election of Grace, God quickneth not men dead in sins, as
they are such, but a^ they a^e ch^s^n of him.
and as stated in his eye as objects of special favor and grace. Nor does the
Lord quicken men as dead in sins, Ephesians. 2.1. as foolish and disobedient, Tit.
3.3. as under sin, Romans 3.9. for then he should quicken all dead in sin, all
foolish and disobedient, all under sin, and this will prove the conversion and
salvation of all and every Son of Adam, the Lord quickneth dead sinners, as
they lie under his free choice of election to glory.

Object. 7. Because Christ died to make a propitiation for them, as they are
sinners.

Answ. That is denied, he died for them as they were sinners, Christ died not
for ^inners as sinners, nor for the righteous as r^ghteous, but for sinners as
chosen to glory.
but as within the pale and under the covering of the fair and sweet shadow of
eternally choosing love, otherwise, if Christ died for sinners as sinners; he
died for all sinners; and for those that are finally obstinate, for these with
the first come under the reduplication of sinners as sinners.

Object. 8. It is no where said Christ died for good men, for righteous for
believers, neither when they were such, nor as they were such; but for the
unjust, ungodly, his enemies, Romans 5, 6, 8. 1 Pet. 3.18. Gal. 1.14.

Answ. Christ neither died for sinners as sinners, nor for sinners as
righteous, as Jacob neither served for his wife as a wife, nor for his wif^ as
a sinful woman, datur tertium. This is an imperfect enumeration, Christ died
for the ungodly, the unjust, his enemi^s; as fre^ly chosen to be made
righteous, and the friends of Christ; as Jacob served for a wife, that is, for
Rachel, whom he freely chos^d before Leah, that he might make her his wife;
neither when she was his wife, nor as she was his wife; and as the Scripture
says, Christ died for the ungodly, the unjust, his enemies so also f^r his
friends, Joh. 15.13. his sheep, Joh. 10.11. his beloved Church and Spouse,
Ephesians. 5.25, 26. And the places cit^d, Romans 5. Gal. 1.4. 1 Pet. ^.^8. are all
restrictive of these for whom Christ died, as Romans 5. he died for us who are
justified by faith, have peace with God, access by faith, who glory in
tribulation, rejoice in hope, Gal. 1.4. He gave himself for us. The Churches
of Galatia, to whom Paul prays, Grace and peace. 1 Pet. 3.18. for those that
he was to br^ng to God, and in no place of Scripture, nor yet 1 Timothy 1.15. Is
it said, Christ died for sinners, as sinners, but only for those that were
sinners, which can never prove the Arminian conclusion, That he died for all
sinners.

Object. 8. He says not, pray for some of all sorts, but for all men, Moor p.
57.
and names but one sort.

Answ. His naming one sort, infers, we should exclude no sort out of our
prayers; seeing this one sort were persecuters, that may seem farthest from our
prayers.

Moor. We are not to pray for such as are known to sin against the Holy Ghost,
because they cast aside the sacrifice and ransom of Christ's blood, and there
is no more sacrifice for them, and so they are blotted out of the hopeful book
of life, and separated from all men of which they were once, being now
reprobated of God, Jer. 16.5. 1 Ioh. 5.16.

Answ. But either Christ did bear on his body on the tree, that sin of casting
aside the sacrifice of Christ, How Christ died not for obstinate sinners.
or not; if the first be said, Christ died for them, and we are to pray for
them, and further such as sin against the Holy Ghost, as such must come under
the reduplication of Gods enemies, the ungodly sinners, disobedient, dead in
sins and trespasses, in the highest degree, and so Christ must have died for
them under that sin; or then there is a sin of some of the sons of Adam, that
Christ did no more bear on his body on the tree, then the sin of Devils which
should render that sin intrinsecally unpardonable, even in relation to Christ's
blood, which Arminians cannot bear. 2. A blotting out of the book of life, and
time-reprobation here asserted by Mr. Moor, is the highest indignity done to
the unchangeable love and grace of God, and gross Arminianisme.

Object. 9. Praying for their brethren could not be doubted of, Page 58.
but the doubt was to pray for opposers and persecuters; The Apostle says,
th^s to pray for all men was good according to Matthew. 5.44.48.

Answ. To pray for all ranks of men, Nero and others was the doubt; but Matthew.
5. Which says, we must pray for, and bless our enemies, with submission to
Gods decree, and in imitation of God, who causes the Sun to shine on the
unjust, cannot infer that we are to pray for all and every one, absolutely, as
Arminians dream, That Christ died for all absolutely.

Object. 10. The motives to pray for all men are from only Gods good will to
man, How Christ died for believers.
and what Christ has done to ransom us, like Matthew. 5.44.45. Motives to pray
for believers are sweeter, as their uprightness with God, faith in Christ,
love in the Saints, fellowship to the Gospel.

Answ. The thing in question is not concluded; we say not we are to pray for
the salvation of none but believers only, and that Christ died for none but
those that already believed: We are to pray for all ranks, believers or
unbeleevers, as Christ died for thousands of both, but ever in order to faith,
and election to glory. 2. Its a ^lasphemous comparison to say the gracious good
will of God to choose men to glory, and the highest and most matchless love of
Christ, Ioh. 3.16. and 15.13. Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27. Acts 20.28. Tit. 3.3, 4. is
but a common motive to induce us to pray for all men, C^rists thing for sinne^s
the high (...) o^ love.
and such belly-blessings as a shining Sun, and raining clouds, which God
bestows on blasphemers, apostates, and cru^ifyers of the Lord Jesus, Psalm.
73.1, 2, etc. Ier. 12.1, 2. Job 21.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Yea, the giving of Christ
to die for sinners, is an argument to prove that far more Christ will give us
all other things, Romans 8.32. even righteousness, faith, love, and all graces,
and therefore there can be no sweeter motive to move us to pray for all men
conditionally, then because for any thing our charity is to deem on the
contrary; they may even though persecuters, be within the circumference and
sweet lists of Gods free love, and greatest good will, and affection of
Election and Redemption, Romans 9.11, 12, 13. Ephesians. 1.9 Ioh. 15.13. and 3.16.
Gal. 2.20. and we are to pray for them under this reduplication and notion, as
freely loved of God, and redeemed of his rich grace, and in no other
consideration, which is the far sweeter motive then any inherent uprightness,
faith, or love that can be in us.

Object. 11. We are to pray without wrath, ver. 8. which is incident, when we
pray for those that cross and persecute us, not when we pray for believers.

Answ. Non concluditur negatum; Ergo, We are to pray for all, and every man,
because we can hardly pray without wrath and grudging for such as Nero. 2. If
believers injure us (as they often do now adays) he knows not his own
heart, who is not tempted to wrath in praying for them. 3. Verse. 8. All prayers
in general must be without wrath, and with pure hands, and not prayers only
for persecuters.

Ob. 12. The thing prayed for, is that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life,
that so the Gospel might run and be glorified. 2 These. ^.1. Joh. 17.22, 23.
But things to be prayed for to the believers are higher, as increase of love,
sincerity, filling with the fruits of Righteousness, Phil. 1.9, etc.

Answ. All these prove this place will prove only, we are to pray for
Magistrates under whom we have peace, and the Gospel, nor for believers, and so
not for all Adams sons; as the next words, Page 59. prove.

Object. 13. Here is a ground to preach the Gospel to all men, Moore p 59.
to every Creature, Matthew. 28.20. Mark. 16.15. And how far to all men, Joh.
16.12. 1 Cor. 3.12. Hebr. 5.12. even though they hate and persecute us.

Answ. If every creature be no Senechdoche, it must warrant us to preach to
Devils. 2. Its evident by the story of the Acts that the Apostles, obeyed not
this command, in the letter, ^s Master Moore presses it; there be many
Nations, and thousands of people, to whom the Apostles never preached the
Gospel, neither to fathers, nor sons. 3. Gods decree is no warrant to the to
preach the Gospel, except God confer miraculously the gift of tongus, and this
strongly proves the contrary; the Lord never yet sent the means of the
knowledge of the truth to all and every Son of Adam, then he cannot will all,
and every Son of Adam to be saved, and Christ dyed not for all and every
creature, then he commanded not to preach the Gospel to all and every creature,
but only to every creature, that is, to all Nations, Jews, and Gentiles: now
when the partition wall is broken down.

Object. 14. He shows the will of God touching the Mediator to save and
ransom all. Page 60.61.
2. To bring all to the knowledge of the truth. 3. By this knowledge sin is
removed, death abolished, enmity slain, peace obtained, so far for all men,
that God has given all over to the dispose of Christ, and made him Lord and
Judge of all. 4. The other part of Gods will, Jesus Christ performs, to wit,
to preach the Gospel to all, and will perform it in due time. 5. The Gospel
may be preached to all, verse. 7. 6. Prayers made for all, v. 1, 2, 3, 4, and
here is no more then Christ does to all men.

Answ. Here be fair Positions, but not a word to prove that this is Gods will
concerning all and every son of Adam. He supposes all this as granted,
because he says, not because the Text says it, and therefore we deny what he
proves not.

Master Moore alleges, that Joh. 1.29. Page 67. Joh 1.9. behold the lamb of
God that takes away the sins of the world, vindicated
Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world.

Answ. The word World, is the Nations and Gentiles, and believers are elect of
both Jews and Gentiles, Joh. 3, 16. God so loved the world. Romans 11.12. If the
fall of them be the riches of the world; if the casting away of them be the
reconcilement of the world; of the Gentiles, and especially of Jews and
Gentiles. Math. 24.14. And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all
the world, for a witness to all Nations; that is, Jews and Gentiles. A
personal witness to every single man it cannot be, except every single man
heard it. Romans 10.14. How shall they believe in him of whom they have not
heard? Joh. 15.22. Romans 2.12. So is the world all Nations, taken, Mar. 14.9,
10. and the word World, Mark. 16.15. (2) Taking away of sin is the actual
free complete pardoning of sin; so as Judas sin is sought, and not found,
Jer, 50.20. As 2 Samuel 24.10. David having numbered the people, prays, What is
the taking away of sin
O Lord take away the iniquity of thy servant; any Arminian in conscience
answer, Did David pray for no more, then is due to Judas, Cain, and all
mankind, of whom many never, in faith, can pray, as David here does? Or does he
not seek the effectual pardon of his numbering the people? Job 7.21. And why
do thou not pardon mine iniquity, and take away my transgression? Esai 27.9.
This is all the fruit, to take away his sin: this cannot be the potentiall,
and ineffectuall removing of sin, common to all the world, but proper to the
Church, and brought to pass by particular afflictions on the Church. Romans
11.27. This is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.
These words are not fulfilled, till all Israel be saved, both elect Jews and
Gentiles, and the Jews converted. But Arminians say, Though the Jews were
never converted, and not a man of Israel saved, yet the Lamb of God takes
away the sins of the world; So Esai 6.7. Thine iniquity is taken away, and
thy sin purged; this is no half pardon, such as Esaiah had before the Lord
touched his lips. 1 John 3.5. And ye know that he was manifested to take away
our sins. John speaks of the taking away of the sins of us, John and the
Saints, who were loved, Verse. 1. with a wonderful love to be called the
Sons of God, us whom the World knows not, verse. 2. us who shall be like
Christ, when he appears. Arminians are obliged to give us parallel places,
where the redemption of all, and every man, and Christ's naked power and desire
to be friends with all men, and to make any covenant, of grace, or works, as he
pleases, is called the taking away the sins of the world; and yet the whole
world may possibly dye in their sins, and not a man be saved; the taking away
of the worlds sins to us, is the complete pardoning of them. Remission of
sins in his blood, Ephesians. 1.7. Col. 1.14. Blotting out of transgressions,
Esai 4^.25. as a thick cloud, Esai 44.23. a not remembering of sins, Isai
43.25. Ier. 31.^4. Such a taking away of sins, as is promised in the covenant
of grace to the house of Judah, to the Church under the Messiah, that hears
the Gospel, Ier. 31.34, Hebr. 8.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Romans 11.26, 27. Esai 59.20.
This is the taking away of the sins of the world, a new world, in whose inner
parts the Lord writes his Law, and with whom the Lord makes an everlasting
covenant, never to turn away from them, Jer. 31.33, 34, 5, 36, 37. in whom the
Lord puts his Spirit, and in whose mouth, he puteth his Word, and in the
mouth of their seed, and their seeds seed, Esai 59.20, 21. The Arminian taking
away of sins is of all, and every one of Adams seed, of such as never heard of
a Covenant, of a Word, of a Spirit, of a Seed, a holy Seed, of a new heart.
Finally the taking away of the sins of the world, is the removing of them as
far from us, as the East is from the West, Psalm. 103.12. bestowed on these
that fear the Lord, verse. 11. and are pitied of the Lord, as the Father
pitieth the Son; and the subduing of our iniquities, and the casting of our
sins in the depths of the Sea, Mich. 7.19.^0. a mercy bestowed only on the
remnant of the Lords inheritance. The Arminian taking away of sins, is a broad
pardon of sins to all the world: let them show Scripture for theirs, as we do
for ours, and carry it with them.

Object. 15. Though Reconciliation be purchased to all and every one, yet it
is not necessary that it be preached to all, Remonstr. 1^. Scrip. Syno..
and every one: but only it is required that God be willing, it be preached
to all; now it is free to God before he be willing to make offer of the
purchased reconciliation to all; to require before hand, such acts of obedience*
and duties, which being performed, he may publish the Gospel to them; or
being not performed, he may be unwilling to publish the Gospel to them. Yea,
though reconciliation be purchased to all, yet its free to God, to communicate
the benefits of his death, upon what terms, he thinks good: And Christ died
(says Master Moore) to obtain a lordship over all, and a power to save
believers, and destroy such as will not have him to reign over them, as we
heard before.

Answ. 1. We have in this Doctrine that Argument yielded. God commanded to
preach to all and every one: Ergo, Christ died for all, and every one. For 1.
The consequence is true absolutely, by the Arminians doctrine, Christ
absolutely died for all, and every one, without prescribing any condition to
those for whom he dies; he says not, my son dies to purchase reconciliation
to all, upon condition all believe, or perform some other duty; but believe
they, or believe they not, the (...) is paid, and salvation purchased for all,
without exception: but the antecedent is not true, but upon condition. God is
not willing the Gospel be preached to all, but to such as perform such
conditions.

2. If they perform not the condition, Christ should have said, preach not the
Gospel to all nations, nor to every creature; but only to such as ye find
fit hearers of the Gospel, and have performed such acts of obedience, as I
require; for conditional threatenings are set down in the Gospel, as well as
conditional promises: he that believes shall be saved, he that believes not
shall be damned. But in Old or New Testament, Arminians never show us where
the preaching of the word of Grace is referred to our free will: Do this, O
Ammonits, O Indians, and the glad tyding shall come to you; if ye do not
this, ye shall never hear the Gospel. Arminians say, God sends his Grace and
Gospel, both genti minus dignae, and indigniori negat, to the unworthy Nation,
and denies both to the worthier.

Arminian conditions of preaching the Gospel, never revealed in thousands, and
so cannot oblige them to perform these conditions.
3. Arminians say, in Script. Synod. Dordr. page 6. Lex non lata, aut non
intellecta, cum intelligi non possit, non obligat* a law not made, or not
understood, when it cannot be understood, does not oblige, then God cannot deny
a salvation, and the benefit of a preached Gospel to Indians; though both were
purchased in Christ, if they never heard (as hundreths of Nations could by no
rumor, hear, or dream of Christ and the Gospel) of Christ.

4. How can God with the same natural, and half-will; equally will that all
be saved; when he absolutely, without merit, or condition, wills the means
of salvation to some, and denies the means of salvation, to the far largest
part of mankind, for want of a condition unpossible; because it neither was,
nor could be known to them.

5. By the Arminian way, sin original, is no sin, it brings wrath and
condemnation on no man. God begins upon a new score, and the reckoning of
the covenant of Grace, to count with all men: and God is so reconciled to all
mortal men, and transacteth with them, in such a way of free grace; that he
will punish no man, for any new breach, except committed actually by such as
are come to age, as have the use of reason; and are obliged to believe in
Christ. page 285, 286, 287. Dordr. scrip. Synod. Yet has God decreed never to
reveal any such gracious transactions, to millions of men, that better deserve
to hear these secrets of grace, then thousands, to whom they are proclaimed in
their ears; ere they can discern the right hand, by the left: This Arminians
say was Gods dispensation, Matthew. 11. with Capernaum, and Tyrus, and Sidon. But
it will be found, that Arminians deny the prescience, and foreknowledge of God.

6. Most abominable, and comfortless, must the doctrine of the death of our
Lord Jesus be; if Christ died only to be a Lord, and such a Lord, as he
might have power; without impeachment of revenging justice, to save men upon a
new transaction, either of grace or works; and to destroy his enemies that
would not accept of that new transaction, yet so as when Christ has dyed, and
taken away the sins of all, and is made Lord and King of dead and quick; all
mankind may freely reject all covenants Christ makes, or can make, and be
eternally lost, and perish.

For 1. Christ's Princedome and Dominion, Christ's Dominion is not a naked power
to save, such as may consist with the damnation of all.
that he has acquired by death, is not a free-will-power or possibility, by
which, he may, upon such and such conditions, kill, or save, though all may
eternally perish. But Christ is made Lord of quick and dead, by dying, Romans
14.9. that he might be judge of all; but so, that we should live and dye to our
selves, but that whether we live or dye we should be Christ's; though we change
conditions, yet not Masters in both, we should be the Lords, v. 7.8. as Christ
lived again after death, that he might be the husband of his own wife, the
Church, that he dyed of love for.

2. Upon what terms Christ was by death, made a Lord, and acquired a
Princedome, upon these terms he was made a Prince over his Church; for Lord,
and Prince, and King, are all one. But the Lord makes David, that is Jesus the
Son of David, Prince over his people, not with power to save or destroy his
redeemed slocke, and so as all the slock may eternally perish. Ezech. 34.22.
Therefore will I save my slocke, and they shall no more be a prey. -- Verse. 23.
And I will set one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, and my servant
David he shall feed them, and he shall be their Shepherd. Verse. 24. And I the
Lord will be their God, and my servant David a Prince among them, I the Lord
have spoken it. Verse. 25. And I will make with them a covenant of peace. Now
was Christ by the blood of the eternal covenant, brought back from the death,
and made a Shepherd of souls, to the end he might have power to destroy all
the slock? Ezechiel says, to feed them, the Apostle, to make the Saints
perfect in every good work, working in them (actually and efficaciously) that
which is wel-pleasing in his sight, Heb. 13.20, 21. Its true, Christ obtains
by his death a mediatory power to crush as a Potters clay vessel, with a rod
of iron, all his rebellious enemies. But 1. this is not a power to crush any
enemies, but such as have heard of the Gospel, and will not have Christ to
reign over them, in his Gospel-government; but not to crush all his enemies,
that never heard of the Gospel, and so are not Evangelically guilty in sinning
against the Lord Jesus, as Mediator, for they cannot be guilty of any such
sin. Romans 10.14. Joh. 15.22. He had, and has power as God, equal with the
Father, to judge and punish all such as have sinned without the Law. 2. Its not
merit, or acquired by way of merit of Christ's death, that a Crown is given to
Jesus Christ, for this end, to destroy such enemies as are not capable of
sinning against his Mediatorie Crown, especially, when as God, he had power to
destroy them, as his enemies, though he had never been Mediator.

Yea, Act. 5.31. Its said, him (whom ye slew, and hanged on a tree) has God
exalted, with his right hand, to be a Prince and Savior, (not to destroy all
his subjects, upon foreseen condition of rebellion, to which they were,
through corruption of nature, inclinable) but that he might by his Spirit,
subdue corruption of nature, and give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
sins.

3. By what title Christ is made a King and Lord, by the same he is made head
of the body the Church. For Ephesians. 1.20.21, 22, 23. By raising him from the
dead, God conferred a headship upon him. Now he was not made head of the body,
that he might destroy all the members, or most of them, as Arminians must say;
but his headship is for this end, that the whole body, by his spirit fitly
joined together might grow up in love, Ephesians. 4.16. and that the members might
receive life and Spirit from him.

4. By the same title he is made Lord, by which he is made King, Governor,
and Leader of the people; for power of Dominion and Lordship is nothing but
Royal power, now he was made King, not on such terms, as he might destroy
all his subjects, (for all mankind are his subjects to Arminians.) But he is
made King, Psalm. 72.11. That all Nations may serve him; that he should deliver
the poor, needy, and helpless; and redeem their souls from violence, and
esteem their death precious, and he reigns and prospers as a King, that in
his days Judah may be saved, and Israel dwell safely, Jer. 23.7.8. and God
raises the horn of David, Luke 1. And so sets Christ on the throne to
perform his mercy promised to our Fathers, and remember his holy covenant.
Ver. 69.7. That we might serve him in holiness and righteousness. Now by the
Arminian way, he is set upon the throne of David to execute vengeance on all
his Subjects and that he may utterly destroy all, if all rebel, and not to
save one of Judah and Israel; for he may be a King without any subject; suppose
all his Subjects were cast in hell; yea, he grows out of the root of Jesse,
a Royal branch of King David's house; not that these Wars may be perpetuated
between God and all the children of men: but that the Wolf should dwell with
the Lamb, and the Leopard lie down with the Kid, and the Calfe, and the young
Lion together, and a little Child should lead them, and the earth should be
filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea, Isai 11.1,
2. -- 6.7, 8, 9. And Christ is given for a guide and leader of the people;
Sure, for the good of the slock, and that he may carry the lambs in his
bosom. Esai 40.11. That they should not hunger nor thirst, that neither the
heat nor the Sun should smite them: because he that has mercy on them, does
lead them, and by the springs of water does he guide them, Esai 49.10.
Salvation is engraven on the Crown of Christ: by office, Christ must be a
destroyer, and a Lord crusher of his people, as a Jesus, and a Savior, by this
conceit.

5. And what more contrary to the intrinsecall end of Christ's death, then that
he should obtain no other end, by dying, but a placability, a possible
salvation, a softning only of Gods mind, whereby justice should only stand
by, and a door be opened, by which God might be willing, if he pleased, to
confer salvation, by this or that Law, a covenant of grace, or of works, or a
mixed way, or by exacting faith in an Angel, or an holy man, and this possible
salvation, this virtuall, or half reconciliation does consist with the
eternal damnation of all the world, whereas the genuine con-naturall end of
Christ's death is, Joh. 10.10. That his sheep may have life, and have it more
abundantly; The intrinsecall end of Christ's death, actual reconciliation,
sanctification, and salvation of ^is redeemed ones.
he suffered, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, 1 Pet.
3.18. and in the very act of suffering (to speak so) or in that he was
stripped and dyed. The chastisement of our peace was on him, Esai 53.5. This
cannot be such a possible heaven, a foul sleeing in the air, a ( may be) as
far off as a ( never may be) which may consist with an inevitable hell. So as
Christ dyed not, but on a poor hopeless venture, and a forlorn contingencie,
that might as soon fill Hell, with the damned souls of all the world, as
grace Paradise with redeemed ones.

6. His coming in the world has no such Arminian end, that we read of, as a
possible saving, or an obtained salvation, that thousands, yea not one in the
world may ever enjoy; but he came to seek, and actually, and intentionaly, to
save that which was lost, Luke 19.10. to save sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15. and Paul
the first of sinners; and not for wrath, but that we might obtain salvation,
by our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 These. 5.9.

7. Nor did he so die, that we should not live to our selves, but unto
Righteousness, but that we might be 1 Pet. 2.24. redeemed from this present
evil world. Gal. 1.4. from our vain conversation; 1 Peter 1.18. That he
might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people,
zealous of good works, Titus 2.14. That we should glorify God in our bodies
and Spirits, which are Gods, 1 Cor. 6.20. That he might present to himself, a
glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it
should be holy and without blemish, Ephesians. 5.27. Now Christ may obtain the
native and intrinsecall end of his death; though all the Redeemed ones (say the
Arminians) Live to themselves, and never be redeemed from the present evil
world, nor from their vain conversation, and live and die to themselves, and
walking in their lusts.

8. And upon what ground Christ is made Lord, he is made also a husband to the
Church; for the husband as an husband is made head of the wife. Now the
intrinsecall end, and so the specific acts of this husband, who is joined to
us, by the marriage-covenant of free grace, must be free love to his Spouse;
as Paul expounds it, Ephesians. 5.25. and the native fruit, and end of Marriage,
is that the Spouse might have interest in the righteousness, glory, spirit,
wisdom, and sanctification, the kingdom and throne of the Husband and Lord,
not that he might condemn and destroy his Spouse.

9. It is a reasonlesse conceit, that after Christ dyed, he has a freedom to
transact for our actual saving and glorifying in what terms he will, Law, or
Gospel, Grace or Works; because he dyed the surety of the covenant of grace,
Hebr. 7.2. and made his Testament, and last will, and confirmed it by his death
as our friend, and bequeathed to his poor friends the promise of an eternal
inheritance, Heb. 9.15. and so he died as the Mediator of the New Testament,
and sealed the Covenant with his blood, which is therefore called the blood of
the eternal covenant, Heb. 13.20. Zach. 9.11. Christ having died has not
freedom by his death, to transact with sinners by a covenant of grace, or any
other way, because his dying is an essential Article of the Covenant of Grace.
And therefore neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood, Heb.
9.18, 19, 20, 21. and Christ by his blood entered into heaven, as a Priest to
intercede for us, v. 23, 24. And this Arminian way over-turneth the whole
Gospel, which is a bargain of blood, between the Father and the son Christ,
and Christ dying and justifying, pardoning the iniquities of his people, making
them heirs of the same Covenant and Kingdom with himself, is in this
Indenture of free Grace, the chief man: Now unpossible it is that this can be
an effect of Christ's death, that he may set up a covenant of grace, and a
Gospel-way to Heaven, or set up another way; when as by the Gospel Covenant
only God gave Christ a body, indented with him to do the work, to make his
soul an offering for sin; and God promised to him if he would die, a seed; and
that the pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand, that his soul should
be satisfied, that he should justify many, intercede for many, Isai. 53.10,
11, 12, 13. Now if all might eternally perish, notwithstanding that Christ died
for them, and it were free to Christ to make such a Covenant after his death,
in which not one man possibly may be saved. Christ then should do his work,
and yet not have his wages, nor have a seed, nor justify his people, nor have
a willing people to serve him; yea, then should Christ offer the sacrifice of
his body, as our Priest on earth, in sheding his blood, and yet not enter into
Heaven, and the Holy of Holiest to intercede for us, as our High Priest there
also.

10. All the offices and relations of Christ and comfortable promises of the
Gospel shall be overturned, All the comfortable relations in Christ, as King,
Head, Husband, Shepherd, Priest, etc. are nothing but empty words, if the end
of Christ's death be only a possible salvation.
for it is in the free will of man, that Christ be King, or no King; Head, or
no Head of the Church; a Husband or no Husband: Clear it is, Christ is a Gospel
King; now if his death might stand and attain its intrinsecall end and effect,
which is a mere possible reconciliation, and a salvation to his people standing
only in ( a may be) or a ( may never be); then Christ is a Gospel-King, without
a Kingdom of Grace, the fruits whereof are righteousness, joy of the Holy
Ghost, and peace, Romans 14.17. He is a King, but Judah shall never be saved in
his days; there shall be no righteousness, no peace, no joy in his Kingdom,
he is a Redeemer and a Savior; but his people all are eternally lost, and die
in bondage and misery, and in their sins; he is a Savior, but saves not his
people from their sins, he is the chief corner stone, but no other living
stones are built on him; he is a head, but has not a living body quickened by
his Spirit; nor a body that is, the fullness of Christ; he is a Husband, but
the essence of his maritall and husbandly power stands in that he has power
to destroy his Spouse eternally, That he hates his own flesh, he is a
Shepherd, and a good Shepherd, and lays down his life for his Sheep; but
the roaring Lion devoureth all his Flock, he carries not the Lambs in his
bosom, he feeds them not in the strength of the Lord, he causes them not
lie down safely, he leads them not to the living waters, they hunger and
starve eternally; he is the vine-tree, but no man brings forth fruit in him.
He is an eternal Priest, but the sins of all he offers for remain in heaven
before the Lord for ever, he is the promised seed, and by death, triumphs
over Devils and Principalities and powers; but the Serpents head is not
bruised, Satan is not cast out, Satan reigns and rules in all mankind: He
has much in Christ, all the world of Elect and Reprobate; all Adams Sons live
and die in sin, and are tormented with the Devil and his Angels eternally,
such a thing as life eternal and the Kingdom of heaven is for no use offered
or purchased to the redeemed, who stand before the Throne, and sing praises to
the Lamb. He is the Lord and builder of his house, the Church; but he has no
Church, but that which cannot be called a Church: I know no Article of the
Gospel, that this new and wicked Religion of universal atonement does not
contradict.

11. To believe in Christ is to believe that omnipotency can save Judas,
Pharaoh and all, every mortal man, so they believe in Christ; But Christ has
purchased sufficient grace to no mortal man, because in the obtaining of
eternal life to all the world, as Arminians say, neither faith, repentance or
grace to believe and repent has any place. God might after Christ's death have
required nothing for our actual salvation, but abstain from eating the fruit
of such a tree, and ye have life eternal in Christ.

12. How can Christ's satisfaction be imputed to any man, seeing it is a mere
possible salvation, or a power to save, that may, and does stand, with the
damnation of millions that Christ died for?

13. Christ's dying had in his eye the Sanctification, the giving of the Spirit,
the raising to life, the eternal glory of not one man more then another, not
of Peter, of Moses, more then of Cain, or Judas; though he said, Joh. 17.19.
For their sakes sanctify I my self. And v. 24. Father I will that those whom
thou have given me, should be where I am, that they may behold the glory that
thou have given me. 9. I pray not for the world, but for them that thou have
given me.

14. Christ has died, yet he must by the Arminian way, make no Testament,
appoint no certain heirs, but win the dead man's Legacy by free will, and have
it who will.

15. Christ obtained by his death that the Gospel should no more be preached
then the Law, or faith in an Angel, that men may be saved.

Use All the doctrine contrary to universal atonement, does highly advance
Christ, for by it the Lord Jesus as Mediator, and our High Priest must be
essentially grace, and essentially an Ambassador of Grace. It is kindly to
Christ to save, salvation belongs to Christ as Christ; enjoy him as a
Savior, and ye cannot perish; be joined to him as a Husband, and he cannot
but love and save his Spouse; submit to him as a King, and ye must share with
him in his Throne, his Kings royal Crown was never ordained for another end,
but that the luster of the precious stones in that Crown, should shine on the
face and souls of his Redeemed ones; Christ came not to destroy but to seek and
to save the lost, get in union with Christ by faith and the Spirit of the Lord
Jesus, and he will save you (to speak so) whether you will or no; ye complain
of corruption, he is a King over the body of sin, he is a Priest to sacrifice
lusts; to preach Christ a dying Redeemer of all and every one of mankind, when
millions redeemed do eternally perish, is to steal away Christ from the
people, as thieves in Ieremiahs days did steal the word of the Lord; it is to
make the Lord Jesus as weak and powerless a Priest, as ever any son of Aaron,
for his blood no more can take away their sins, then the blood of Bullocks or
Goats could do it, its to enthrone free will, and dethrone the grace of
Christ, and to put shame on the Lord Jesus and his blood; and though these
enemies of the cross of Christ, now crowd in, in England, under the Name of
the Godly party; yet it was a good Observation of that Learned and gracious
servant of Christ Doctor Ames who conversed with Arminans, that he could never
see a proof of the grace of Christ, in the conversation of such men, as in
doctrine, were declared enemies of the grace of Christ.

Now for the world, All, and the World, and all Nations, it may be demonstrate
from Christ's will in the Scriptures, There is as good ground in Scripture for
the conversion and salvation of all, and every one, as for the redemption of
all and every one.
that if universal atonement and Redemption of all and every one, can be
proved from these Grammattications: Then with the like strength I can prove, 1.
The conversion of all and every mortal man to saving Faith. 2. The eternal
salvation of all and every man. 3. The eternal perishing of all and every one,
which must be infinitely absurd and blasphemous: And if the good will of God
cannot be extended to the end, and the efficacious and only saving means
tending to this end, which are salvation and saving faith; with no color of
reason can it be extended to one means of redeeming all and every one, rather
then to another.

1.There is an universal conversion, and saving illumination, which is called
in the Text, A drawing of all. And I, when I am lifted up, on the cross, will
draw all men to me. Here is a drawing of all men, and so an effectual
conversion, but not of all and every man, Drag-net, p. 80, 81.
as Mr Den says, 1. Because v. 33. This drawing is by the power of Christ,
lifted up on the Cross, and by the Holy Spirit given by Christ, Joh. 7.39. and
14.16, 7. and 15.26, ^7. and 16.7, 1^, 14. Now it can be no Gospel Truth that
Christ draws by the lifting of himself on the Cross, and by his death, all
and every man to himself, even thousands and millions of the sons of Adam,
that never heard one letter or the least sound of the Gospel, or of his lifting
up on the Cross; for sure, Christ's death-drawing must be by proposing the
beauty and loveliness of Christ crucified, which thousands never heard of. 2.
This drawing must be all one with the drawing which effectually produces
running Cant. 1.4. after Christ. And which is Ioh. 6.44. Now when Christ says,
No man can come, except he be drawn: He clearly shows that the drawing of the
Father is a peculiar privilege of some, and not common to all, as the other
two expressions beside of being taught of God, and hearing and learning of the
Father. 3. Because all the drawn are raised up, by Christ their life and head
at the last day, v. 44.4. The Adversary cannot show any drawing of Christ, or
to Christ, that is common to all, and every one of mankind.

So, All Israel shall know the Lord, as its Heb. 8.10. for this is the covenant
that I will make with the house of Israel (says the Lord) I will put my laws
into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God,
and they shall be to me a people. verse. 11. And they shall not teach every
one his neighbor, and every man his brother, (...). They shall all know me
from the least of them, even to the greatest: When was this covenant made?
under the Mesiah, when both the Jews to whom this Apostle wrote, and the
Gentiles came in. After those days, Arminians cannot deny, but the putting of
the law in the mind, and writing it in their hearts; and this knowing of the
Lord, not by the ministry of man; but by the inward teaching of the Spirit,
must be saving conversion and there is no more reason to expound Israel, all
Israel, both Jews and Gentiles, of all of every kind, and some few (except
they flee to our universalitie of the elect) in the matter of conversion, then
in the matter of redemption by Christ, when it is said, Christ gave himself a
ransom for all. 1 Timothy 2. Because it is their constant doctrine to make all
and every one of Adams Sons, as many as Christ died for, to be the parties
with whom the covenant is made: so in the same covenant, it is said, Ioh. 6.
45. (...). They shall be all taught of God as Jeremiah says Chap. 31.34.
(...) etc. Because they shall all know me, for I will forgive their iniquity,
and remember their sin no more: except they admit an universalitie of the
redeemed of God, then as they contend for an universal redemption, and all and
every one of mankind, in Christ to be taken in, within the covenant of grace
(for they expound all those of the visible Church) there is as good reason,
that we prove from the Grammar of (...) and (...) All. An universal
Regeneration, and an universal justification of all, as they can prove an
universal redemption: so is the same promise Isai. 54.11. and clearly Romans
11.26. All Israel shall be saved. He means Jews and Gentiles, when the
fullness of the Gentiles shall come in, here is universal salvation of all.

So by John Baptists ministry, all and every one of his hearers must be
converted, why? As Arminians expound many that Christ died for, Matthew. 20.28.
To be all and every man without exception. 1 Timothy 2 6. Heb. ^.9. 1 Ioh. 2.1.
so they are debtors to us for the same liberty. Mal. 4. He shall turn the
hearts of the fathers to the children, Luke 1.16. Many of the children of
Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God: these we must expound by the
Arminian Grammar of the conversion of all and every one* that heard ^ohn preach
contrary to Luke 7.29.30. for Pharisees and Lawyers were not converted. Yea, it
is said Isai. 40. (...)
Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain shall be made low, and
the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain, and the glory
of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. Matthew 3.
expounds it of the preaching of repentance, and the coming of the kingdom of
God, by the ministry of John: so does Mark 2.3. and John 1.2. And the filling
of vall^yes, and making straight crooked things; is sure the humbling of the
proud, and the exalting of the humble, and the conversion of the disobedient:
But who can say that all and every mountain was made low? and by John's
ministry, or Christ either: Was the Gospel preached to all and every man? or
the heart of every son, converted to the father, or did all flesh see, or
enjoy the salvation of God? Then they must flee to our exposition: yea, the
seeing of the salvation of God is no less the saving of all, which Arminians
cannot say. Mr. Den says, That the seeing of God, is in that when they knew
God, Dr^g-net, p. 8^, 8^. How all flesh see the salvation of God.
they glorified him not as God, Romans 1.21. And they liked not to retain God in
their knowledge, as that is, they have both seen and hated both me and my
Father, and Mat. 13.1^. And seeing, they see not, but (says he) it is not to
be understood of saving knowledge.

Answ. 1. This is contrary to the scope of the Prophet Isaiah and of the
Evangelists, who aim at holding forth the fruits of the Gospel in John Baptist
his Ministry, which was the conversion of souls, as Malachy says, and the
bringing down the proud and in tu^ning many of the children of Israel to the
Lord their God; and in going before C^ri^t in the Spirit and power of Elias, to
turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the
wisdom of the just, and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord, Luke
1.16, 17. Which is a clear Exposition of laying every proud Mountain level to
Christ, and of fitting souls for the Messiah. Which no man can say, by
teaching such a knowledge of Christ, as Idolatrous Heathen had of God as
Creator, or blind and obstinate Pharisees had of Christ and his Father, whom
they both saw and hated, Joh. 15. Romans 21. That seeing of the salvation of God,
is neither conversion, nor preparation of a people for Christ. 2. The phrase of
seeing God, and the salvation of God, being set down as a powerful fruit of
the Gospel, has never in Scripture so low a meaning as is not wanting to
natural men, and Atheists, and Pharisees: But is meant of an eff^ctuall
knowledge of God, and the enjoying of God, as Job 19.25. I shall see God. Psalm.
106.5. That I may see, that is enjoy, the good of thy chosen, Isai. 33.17 Thine
eyes shall see the King in his beauty. Isai. 52.10. The ends of the earth shall
see the salvation of our God. Matthew. 5.8. Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God. Joh. 3.3. Except a man be born again, he cannot see the
Kingdom of God. Acts 22.14. Then Ananias said to Saul the God of our Fathers
has chosen thee, that thou should know his will, and see that just one Heb.
12.14. Follow holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. But if Mr.
Den and others will contend that this seeing of the salvation of God, is the
revelation of the literal knowledge of Christ, that saving thing which is
bestowed on the Nations by the Ministry of John and the coming of the Messiah,
they must with us confess a large Synecdoche and figure in this, when it is
said, All flesh shall see the salvation of God, because there are thousands
that live and die in the region and shadow of death, to whom the least taste of
literal knowledge of Christ, or of his Name never came. Psalm. ^9.9. In his
Temple shall every one speak of his glory, not every one, but converts only can
utter the glory of God savingly, in the Temple of the Lord, otherwise many
speak and do in his Temple, to his dishonor, Jer. 7.4.10* 11. Ezech. 23.38,
39. Acts 2.4. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost. 17. And it shall come
to pass in the last days (says GOD) I will pour out my Spirit upon all
flesh. Now it is clear, This is a prophesying of all flesh within the Church:
Your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, your young men shall dream
dreams, etc. Now all flesh did never prophecy, nor was the Holy Ghost on
Ananias and Saphira. Romans 4. Abraham is called the father of us all. A
spiritual father by faith, he is to those that are of the faith of Abraham:
Now Arminians will not suffer us to expound us all in the matter of Redemption
of us all, the elect of God, and believers; but of all and every one within the
visible Church, Joh. 1.16. And of his fullness have all we received, and grace
for grace. There is as good ground for saving grace given to all in Christ, as
for Universal Redemption, except the words be restricted. For Arminians have
ground from the words to allege, All we among whom Christ dwelt have received
grace, all we who saw his glory, as the only begotten Son of God, v. 14. which
sight is the sight of saving faith, not given to all and every Son of Adam. 14.
And he dwelt personally in the flesh and nature of all Adams Sons. So is it
said, 1 Cor. 12.13. For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body,
whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all
made to drink unto one Spirit (...). How can Arminians decourt from a
spiritual communion, in both Sacraments; all Jews and Gentiles in the visible
body of Christ, except they restrict all (...), as we do? And 2 Cor. 3.18. But
we all with open face (...), beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of
the Lord. Now Paul speaks of all under the Gospel, and under the glorious
ministration of the Spirit, opposite to the condition of the children of
Israel, who were under the Law, which was the ministration of death, v. 6, 7,
8. Whose minds are blinded, through the veil that was, and yet is over the
hearts of that stiffenecked people in reading of the Old Testament, whereas
this vail is taken away in Christ, and we all under the Gospel have the Spirit
and are free, and see the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same
glory, being in the Suburbs of Heaven; all of us having our faces shining with
the rays and beams of the glory of the Gospel, in the face of God, in a more
glorious manner then the face of Moses did shine when he came down from the
Mount, with a glory that was to be done away, whereas this is eternal, v. 9,
10, 11, 12. compared with v. 17, 18. Now let Arminians speak, if they think
all, and every one that hears the Gospel are partakers of this vision of God
in the Kingdom of Grace? And Ephesians 4. Christ ascending on high gifted his
Church with a Ministry, v. 13. Till we all come in the unity of the faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man, unto the measure of
the stature of the fulness of Christ. When we to decline the absolute
universality of the redemption of all and every one, do say, We all, and he
tasted death for all men, and Christ gave himself a ransom for all. All must
be restricted according to the Scope, the antecedent and consequent of the
Text, we cannot be heard. Master Moore says, we make the Holy Ghost to speak
untruth, because we expound, all men, to be few men, yet must they either use
the same restriction, and acknowledge an universality of converted and saved
men, and so expound, All, to be few, as we do, or they can no more decline the
universal salvation of all, and every one, then we can decline the Catholic
redemption of all, and every one. So they must say, that the number of the
perfected Saints, that attain to the fullness of grace and glory, and to a
perfect man in Christ, is equal to that visible body, the Church, gifted with
Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, and Pastors, and Teachers. For all the like
places Arminians expound of the body, of the whole body of the visible Church,
externally called; now this is most absurd, that all and every one should be
saved, to whom Apostles, and Pastors were sent to preach the Gospel, then need
force All must be restricted to the chosen flock only. So Luke 16.16. The
kingdom of God is preached, (...), and every man presses violently to it. The
meaning is not, Den Drag-net page 96.
as Master Den says, that every one is pressed by command, and
Gospell-exhortation to repent. For 1. from John Baptists time, all and every
one hears not the Gospel, Matthew. 10.5. (2) Matthew. 11. ver. 2. is clearly
expounded by an Active verb, these that take heaven violenly, (...), take it
by force; but do all, and every Son of Adam, take heaven by force? No, then
there must be an All, and a Catholic company of converted and saved persons,
by this conceit. And 1 Thessalonians. 5.5. Yea, are all (...) the children of light,
and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of the darkness;
these All that are called the children of the day, are opposed in the foregoing
Verses, to the children of darkness, on whom the last day comes suddenly,
as childbirth pains on a woman. 2. All these are the children of light, who
are exhorted to be sober, not to sleep, Verse. 6, 7, 8. And whom God has not
appointed for wrath, but for salvation, by the means of our Lord Jesus. But
these be all the visible Church of Thessalonica; Ergo, there were no children
of darkness among them, which is absurd; and will be denied by Arminians.
When Christ speaks to the multitude, he says, Matthew. 25.8. All ye are
brethren: they must be brethren, by the new birth. Verse. 8. Call no man your
Father on earth, etc. Philip. 1.7 Ye are all partakers of my grace. Now he
speaks of these in whom Christ had begun the good work, and would perfect
it into the day of Christ, Verse. 6. Such the Arminians do say, were all the
visible Saints at Philippi. Then by this, all and every one of them were
converted, 1 Cor. 11.4. The head (...), of every man is Christ, of every man
without exception? No, these of whom Christ is h^ad, these are his body, the
Church, that have life from him, and are knit to him by the Spirit, and among
themselves by spiritual ligatures, Ephesians. 1.22.23. and Christ's fullness,
Ephesians. 4 ^6. Col. 1.18. Genesis 21.6. All that hears shall laugh with me; Sarah
means the laughter of faith; then must all that hear of Sarahs bearing o^
Isaak in her old age, believe in Christ, as Sarah did? Psalm. 65.2. O thou that
hear prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come; a figure there must be in the
word flesh; and if there be no figure in the particle, (...) then must all
flesh, and all Adams Sons put up prayers to God, contrary to experience, and
to Scripture, Psalm. 14.4. Psalm. 53.4. Jer. 10.25. So Psalm. 72.12. All Nations,
(...) shall serve him, its meant of Christ, and in the letter cannot be true,
if many refuse him to be their King, Psalm. 2.9.2.3. L^k. 19 14. Psalm. 110.1.
So is it said, Psalm. 22.27. All the ends of the world shall remember, and turn
to the Lord: and all the kindreds of ^he Nations shall worship before thee. Now
that he means of spiritual turning to God, and of Repentance is clear.
Verse. 18. For the Kingdom is the Lords, and he is the Governor among the
Nations. Verse. ^3. A seed shall serve him, it shall be counted to the Lord for
a Generation. Except there be a restriction of this ( All) how will Arminians
eschew this, that all, and every man of the heathen, shall repent, and be a
holy seed devoted to the Lord, as his Righteous ones? For sure the same
expression of all Nations, Esai 40.16. are taken for all and every one of
mankind. Psalm. 66 9. All Nations, whom thou have made, shall come and worship
before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name. (...)
Esai. 66.23. And it shall come to pass, that from one new Moon to another,
and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come ^o worship before me,
says the Lord. Let Arminians speak, if all flesh, that comes before God,
from Sabbath to Sabbath, under the New Testament to worship, (...)
be as large and comprehensive as the same expression, Esai 40.6. All flesh is
grass. Sure the latter comprehends all Adams Sons, without exception, even
including infants; the former cannot bear so wide a sense. So Genesis 12.3. In
thee shall all the Families of the earth be blessed. Genesis 22.18. If the meaning
be that, without any figure or exception, all and every family be blessed in
Christ, then shall I infer that, all the families of the earth, without
exception, are justified by faith in Christ, Gal. 3.10, 11, 12, 13.14. And that
the Nations of the earth, without exception, are heirs of the promise, have
right to strong consolation, are fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope laid
before them, and have anchored their hope up within the veilo, whither the
forerunner Christ has entered; for of these Nations the Apostle expounds the
promise, Hebr. 6.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. So Esai 27.6. Israel shall
blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit; then shall there
be none on earth, but the blossoming I^rael of God? Romans 11.26. And so all
Israel shall be saved, as it is written, there shall come out of Sion a
deliverer, etc. These that Paul calls all Israel, Esaiah 69.20, 21. calls
Jaakob and the seed, and the seeds seed. Esaiah 59.19. So shall they fear the
name of the Lord from the West, and his glory from the rising of the Sun.
(...)
Mal. 1.11. For from the rising of the Sun, even to the going down of the
same, any name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place, incense
shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great
among the heathen, says the Lord of Hosts; If from the East to the West, and
in all places of the Gentiles, men fear the name of the Lord; then sure, the
whole inhabitants of the earth, between the rising of the Sun to the going
down of the same, must be converted to Christ, and offer prayers, praises,
spiritual service to Christ, except some restriction be made, the most part
from the East to the West are enemies to the Gospel; And how would Arminians
triumph, if so much were said for universal Redemption, as here is said for
universal Regeneration and Conversion of all, except we say there must be a
figure, a Senechdoche, of All, for many? Or Christ's all, and universalitie of
converted ones must be here meant? Joh. 1.9. That was the true light that
inlighteneth every one that comes into the world. What? Even infants who come
into the world? and all, and every one of Adams Sons; it cannot be true, in
any sense; except it be meant of the light of the Gospel, that yet never came
to the half part of the world; For Verse. 10. The world knew him not, and Verse.
6. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John ver. 7. the same came for
a witness, to bear w^tnesse of the light, that all men through him might
believe. Can any divinity teach that God intended, that all and every mortal
man should believe by him, that is, by the Ministry of John; the morning
star which was to fall, and disappeare, and shine no more at the rising of
Christ, the Sun of righteousness? 1 John 2.27. Ye need not that any teach
you, but the anointing that ye have received teaches you all things. Why
should then fewer have the Spirit of holy unction in them, then the world for
whom Christ is a propitiation, and all the visible Saints that John writes
unto? All ordinarily is put for many in scripture.
1 John 1, 2. and 2.1.2. and 4.9. God sent his only begotten Son to the
world, that we through him might live; nor need we flee to that exposition ever
and anon, that Christ dyed for all, that is, all ranks of men. For All, is put
in Scripture ordinarily for many; as Deuteronomy. 1.21. Psalm. 71.18. Ier. 15.10. and
19.9. and 20.7. and 23.30. and 49.17. Ezech. 16.27. Exodus 33.10. Col. 1.28.
Isai. 61.9. Genesis 41.57. Mark 14.4. Joh. 3.26. Acts 17.31. and 10.38. Mark.
1.37. 2 Cor. ^.2. Luke 24.47. and 4.15. Isai 2.2, 3. Otherwise I could say
Christ died for no man, because the Scripture ascribes an universality to the
wicked, Jer. 6.28. c. 9.2. Mic. 1.7. 1 John 2.15, 16. and 1 John 5.19.

And surely that election and redemption, move both in the same sphere, and or
be of the free love of God, is clear to me; from that place Ioh. 3.16. on
which Arminians confide much, for Gods love to save mankind, by the death of
Christ is the very love of election to glory, of such certain persons, as the
Lord therefore gives grace to believe; because they are ordained to life
eternal: so that the (...) as many, and the number of believers, and of the
chosen to life are equal. Acts 13.48. Ioh. 10.26. Romans 8.29.30.

1. That love cannot be a general, confused, antecedent, conditional love,
offered to all the world, on condition they believe; for that the Scripture
freeth thousands of the sin of unbelief of that love, if Christ come not to
them, and speak not, Ioh. 15.22. and Paul says Romans 1.14. How shall they
believe in him, of whom they have not heard? Now the loved world, Ioh. 3.16. is
obliged to believe.

2. That love that is the cause of Christ's death, is Ioh. 15.13. the greatest
love that is; it is such a giving love, whereby Christ gives his Son, The
(...) John 3.16. dis^^^ssed, that love ^s a particular love proper to the (...)
only.
that with him he cannot but give his Holy Spirit, faith and salvation, yea,
and all things, Romans 8.32. But the conditional general love is not the
greatest love, for the Lord bears not the greatest love to all and every man,
nor gives he faith and salvation to all and every man; yea, the known and
believed love of God in sending his Son to die for us is proper to the
believer, 1 Ioh. 4.16.9, 10. We have known and believed the love God has to
us, God is love, and he that dwells in love, (its a noble Princely palace to
lodge in) dwells in God, and God in him. This cannot be said of the love that
God bears to the Reprobate, yea, and to the fallen Angels; for Arminians say
that God loved them with such a love; but that love to Devils, is now dried up
long ago, and so that to Pharaoh, Judas, Cain, now in hell, but this love is
gone; so dream they, that love in God is like summer brooks that go dry in time
of drought; but the truth is, Gods general love to Arminians, What the love of
God is.
is a faint desire, and a wish that all and every one, men and Angels be saved,
and a bestowing on them means, 1. Which the Lord knows shall plunge them
deeper in hell, and make their everlasting chains heavier and more fiery;
better he love them not. 2. Such means as can be demonstrated free will
without God, or any determination or bowing to one hand, rather then to
another, can, and may absolutely master and over-master equally to conversion,
or obstinacy, or to final rebellion, to salvation, or damnation, to make
themselves free Princes and Lords of the book of life, and the writing pen of
eternal Election, and Artists, causes, and masters of the decrees of Election,
or Reprobation. For, 1. Let God do what he can, or omnipotency, or sweetness
of free grace, all that is possible, free will has the free and absolute
casting of the balance to will, receive Christ, open to the King of glory, and
be converted, Arminian election faint and weak for the salvation of one more
then another.
or to the contrary. 2. In Election and Reprobation from eternity, (as
Arminians in their last Apology go no higher then time, coepta est in temporo
electio, contra quam creditum est, etc.) God does no more in his general
decree for choosing of Jacob or Peter, then of Pharaoh, Esau or Judas; but
chooses all indefinitely who shall believe. But for the Assumption that Peter,
John, Pharaoh, Judas, Esau, believe, or not believe, the eternal decree of God
does nothing, his means, Gospel, his inward grace (such grace as they can
grant) do no more, nor can do any more to determine the will to either side,
to believing, or not believing; then he can work contradictions, or make free
will, and free ob^dience to be no free will, and no obedience, for its
repugnant (say they) to the nature of free will that it should be determined by
God; And (...), such as is required of us now who are under comm^^^ements,
threatenings, promises, were no obedience at all, for if the Lord should
determine the will (say they) and therefore Gods last decree of choosing those
to life, whom he foresees shall expire in faith, and persevere to the end, and
of rejecting such, as he foresees shall go on, in final obstinacy against the
Gospel, is not any Scripturall decree of Election or Reprobation, nor has God
any liberty in this, to choose this man, not this man, but all men choose God,
and are foreseen finally to believe, or not believe, before, and without any
free decree of God; so that the number of chosen Angels or men is in the power
of the creatures free will; not in the liberty of the former of all things; so
as we choose God, but God chooses not us. But 2. So none are within the compass
of Election or Reprobation, but such as hear the Gospel; and so all the Heathen
are saved or damned by chance, or without any will or decree of God, or they
must be neither capable of salvation, nor damnat^on, contrary to Scripture and
experience, for terrible judgments temporal, and great external favors
befall Indians, Americans, and such as never heard of Christ, and not without
the counsel of Gods will, if there be a providence that rules the world. 2.
God does nothing in the Election of Peter, more then of Judas; nor can grace
and mercy have place in the choosing of the one, rather then the other; but as
free will is foreseen to play the game ill, or well, so go the eternal
decrees of Election and Reprobation, and there can be no such thing as that
grace and the free pleasure of God, who has mercy on whom he will, or because
he will, and hardens whom he will, can have any place here.

4. The Scripture no where speaks of any love of God in Christ to man, but
such as is efficacious in saving; Gods love in Christ, efficacious.
any other love is lip-love, not real; and so to allege this one place,
without authority of the Word, is petitio principii, a begging of the
question; for the love Ez^ch. 16.8. Called the time of loves, was such as
saved, all that were to b^ saved, amongst the people of God; and cannot be
understood of such a love as God did bear to the Heathen, and the Cannanits,
for it separates them from all the world: so Deuteronomy. 7.7. Psalm. 146.19.20 Isai.
51.1, 2, 3. Isai. 52.3, 4. Psalm. 132.1^. Psalm. 1^5.4. Zech. 3.2. 1 King. 1.13.
2 Chronicles. 6.6. Isai. 4^.8, 9. Deuteronomy. 14.2. Isai. 43 20. Dan. 1^. 15. 1 Chronicles.
16.13. Ezech. 20.5. Act. 13.17. Ye shall not find that the love of God in
Christ can consist with Reprobation, or Damnation, in all the Scripture; but by
the contrary, it is a love that Christ has to his wife, in giving himself for
her; sanctifying, washing and presenting her, without spot or wrinkle before
(...) a husband-love, Ephesians. 5.25, 26. a love saving, b^ the washing of
Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost ^i^us 3.4, 5, 6. a great love,
quickening us together with Christ, saving us by grace, raising us up, and
making us ^it together with Jesus Christ, in heavenly places. Ephesians. 2.4.5. a
love causing washing of us, and advancing us to be Kings and Priests to God,
Revel. 1.5, 6. a love to Paul in particular, and working life in Paul, Gal.
2.20. I live no more, but Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live
in the flesh; I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
himself for me. It is the love of God our Father, who has loved us, and has
given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace. 2 These. 2.16. an
everlasting love. Jer. 31.3. a love before the foundation of the world, Ephesians.
1.3, 4, before we do good or evil, Romans 9.11. Not a love that falls to
nothing; by a consequent act of hatred, nor a love to which the hatred of
reprobation may succeed every hour, and out of which we may be decourted; a
love that puts the honor of sons on us, 1 Ioh. 3.1. It is a saving and a
pitying love Isai. 63.9. a love which the Lord rests in, Zeph. 3.17. a love
continuing to the end, Ioh. 13.1. a love that makes us more then conquerors.
R^m. 8.37. It is a separating love that differenceth the loved of God, from all
others, Psalm. 87.2. Psalm. 1.6.8. otherwise all the world, should in regard of
this general, and antecedent, and conditional love of God, be so the beloved
of God; as Christ in the song of Solomon, esteems the Spouse his love, his
welbeloved: Its a love better then life, Psalm. 6^.3. and the dowry Christ
bestows on his spouse, Hos. 2.19. now the Scripture no where speaks of that
conditional love, which the Lord bears to Heathens, All redeemed from w^ath
to come, are redeeme^ from all iniquity and this present evil world.
Reprobates, and to all Men and Angels.

5. Such as the Lord so loved, as he has redeemed them from perishing, he
has redeemed them from sin and Gentilisme; to wit, from this present evil
world, Gal. 1.4. yea, the blood of the Lamb, unspoted, and undefiled, has
bought them from their vain conversation, received by tradition, from their
fathers, 1 Pet. 1.18. yea, from fornication, that they should be members of
Christ, temples of the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 6.20. yea, Christ bare their sins
in his own body on the tree, that they should live to righteousness. Now all
and every one of mankind, Heathen and Turks, are not thus bought with a price,
and deliv^^^d from idolatry, blasphemy, killing of child^^^ to their god, from
the world of Gentilisme. 1. They liv^ in these sins, as serving God in them;
the Gospel nev^^ forbade them any such si^n^s, in regard they never heard the
Gospel. 2 They cannot sin on a n^w score, or a new reckning; these being to
them, no sins against the Gospel; but against the law written in their heart.
3. There is a p^ice then given: for all the reprobate vice reproborum, it is
(...) as they had paid the price to redeem them from sin, and unbelief;
yea, from final impenitencie against the Gospel: If this be a sin, as it is
the sin of sins, Christ must bear it on the tree, 1 Pet. 1.24. The lamb
of God must take it away. Ioh. 1.29. Except it were possible final unbelief
were pardonable without shedding of blood. Heb. 10. Now here the ransom paid,
but the captive is never delivered, for the reprobate die in their sins Ioh.
8.21. There be some say, there is a ransom given for these Gospel-sinnes of
the reprobate, conditionally, so they believe.

An^w. That is, they are freed from final impenitencie, so they be freed from
final impenitencie: is this a wife bargain? 2. Where is there is all the Word,
a warrant that Christ laid down his life for his sheep conditionally; so he
foresaw they would be his sheep; so they would believe and repent? Now this he
could not do: for Christ out of deliberation, and his Fathers eternal
counsel, absolutely, gratis, freely di^d for these; he died not for those,
that he foresaw would never fulfill the condition, nunquam posita condition,
nunquam ponitur conditionatum.

6. Christ bought by his blood of the eternal Covenant, all the Jewels of the
Covenant, all things that belong to life and go^linesse, and all spiritual
blessings, 2 Pet. 1.3. Ephesians. 1.3. A new heart and a new Spirit, Christ
purchased says to us by his death
Ezech. 36.26. Jer. 31.33, 34, 35, 36. Ezekiel. 11, 19, 20. He bought all that God
gives to us, then he must have purchased faith, Phil. 1.29. Joh. 6.29. and if
he was made a Prince to give repentance and remission, then to give faith, for
it is a grace above nature, and out of this fountain, we have grace for grace,
Ioh. 1.14. Now this is not given to all men.

7. All these graces are particular, 1. Election to glory is particular, Few
are chosen, Mat. 22.14. Joh. 10.26.29. Ephesians. 1.4. Romans 9.11. The promise is
particular to the sons of the promise, Romans 9.8, 9. made to Christ, and his
seed only, Gal. 3.16, 17, 18. All graces in Christ are peculiar to the el^ct
^nly, how can then Redemption be universal?
Gal. 4.22, 23, etc. the calling particular, Isai. 55.1, 2. Matthew. 11.27, 28.
Acts 2.39. the Covenant particular, and takes in only the House of Judah, the
elect and such as cannot fall away, Ier. 31.34, 35, etc. and 32.39, 40. Isai.
54.10. and 59.19, 20. The surety of the Covenant, Christ, Heb. 7.22. promised
to be King over the House of David, over his people only; the intention of God
particular to a foreknown people only, Romans 11.1. The circumference and extent
of Grace then cannot be so wide, as to take in all, nor can Redemption be
universal, because conditional. For 1. Arminians make Election conditional,
but they deny it in words to be universal; further glorification is
conditional, justification conditional, upon condition of Faith, but because
the condition never is, all men have not faith; therefore glorification and
justification is particular, and redemption on the same ground must be
particular; none are actually redeemed but the believers, so as glorification
actual (the decree of glorifying is another thing, and absolute) and Election
to glory are commensurable, the one not larger then the other, Romans 8.29, 30.
how can Redemption, which is a mid-linke between both, be of a wider Sphere to
take in all? for 1 These. 5.9. Gods counsel set us on Christ as Redeemer, and
gives us to Christ.

8. These two (Christ redeemeth all) and (Christ intends to redeem all) are
most different: Now Gods intention to redeem all if they believe, suspendeth
either redemption, or the intention of God to redeem: If the former be said,
redemption of all, is no Redemption, except all believe, but all do not
believe: If the latter, God must wave and hang by his intention in millions of
souls, and cannot fix his foot to be peremptory in his intentions except they
believe, and he sees they shall never believe, for he knows what is in man,
and beholds the thoughts a far off.

Yea, as I said elsewhere, if we speak properly in reference to God, the very
promises of the Gospel are not conditional; because both the condition, The
promises of the Gospel not properly conditional in relation to God.
and the thing that falls under the condition, depend on his own absolute
will, and free gift; if a father promise to his child an inheritance upon
condition the child pay him ten thousand crowns, and the Father only do give,
and can give the child these ten thousand crowns; we cannot say, this is a
bargain between the father and the son, that leans upon conditions, especially
if we suppose, as the case is between God and the creature, that this father
can and does indeclinably determine the will of his son to consent, and to give
back again to his father this sum of money, and to consent to the bargain;
there is here no condition relating to the father, but he does all freely.
Believing is a condition, and life eternal is conditionatum, a thing that
falls under promise, but both d^pend upon the absolute, free and irresistible
will of the Lord; as there is no condition here properly so called, either laid
upon the will, or limiting the external action of God.

9. Hence the promises of the Gospel are indefinite, not universal, and in the
Lords purpose and intention made with the Elect only, not with the Reprobate
at all, for when God says, if Judas, Cain, Pharaoh, believe they shall be
saved, the Lords purpose being ^o deny to them the grace of believing, without
which it is unpossible they can believe, the promise in Gods purpose is not
made with them: He that so wills what he promises upon a condition, which he
that so wills, only can do and work, and yet will not do or work the
condition; he does indeed not will to the party, what is so promised, if John
send Peter to work in his garden upon condition, that if he work, he shall
give him a talent a day, and in the mean while John only can give to Peter
strength of legs, and arms, and body to work, can determine his consent to the
work, and yet refuse to give strength, and to win his consent to the work; Sure
he never wi^led either to give him a talent for his work, nor intended he
should work at all. Hence I ar^ue, it is against the wisdom of God to intend
and will that the Reprobate be redeemed, pardoned, saved, upon a condition,
which he himself only can work by his grace, and absolutely and irresistibly
will not work. What is never done is not Gods will simply.
Now in Scripture such a thing is argued not to be done, because the Scripture
must be fulfill^^; and the decree of God and his will ful^^lled, as Christ's
bones upon this ground, could not be broken, and such a thing is done that the
Scripture, and so the will and decree of God might be fulfilled, so that which
is never done, is simply Gods will it shall never be done; that which is done
is simply Gods will it must be; I mean either his permissive or approving will;
The revealed will of God called voluntas signi, is not simply Gods will, but
only so called by a figure.
and the will of God revealing, what is the duty of Reprobates though it never
be done, argu^s it was not simply the will of God; hence that voluntas signi,
in which God reveals what is our duty, and what we ought to do; not what is
his decree, or what he either will, or ought to do, is not Gods will properly,
but by a figure only, for commands, and promises, and threatenings revealed,
argue not the will and purpose, decree or intention of God, which are properly
his will.

10. It is against the wisdom of God to intend the actual Redemption and
salvation of all, and every one, and not to will, nor work such conditions,
which only he himself can work, and are in his power only, and without the
which the creature cannot be redeemed and saved, but he neither will, nor does
work faith in all; then he never intended the actual redemption and salvation
of all and every one.

Hence what ever wanton and lascivious reason can object against absolute
Reprobation, the absolute Redemption of some few, a particular atton^ment of
some few, equally fights with the opinion of adversaries, as against ours,
they say;

1. God intends the eternal destruction of the innocent sinlesse and greatest
part of mankind.

2. Mercy, bowels of compassion, by your particular, absolute Redemption is
extended to few; What can, in shadow of vain reason, be objected against
absolute el^ction, and reprobation, and particular redemption, fall with equal
strength, upon conditional, and universal ^l^ction and redemption.
and all the rest of the lost world, left to sincke eternally, notwithstanding
of the infinite and boundless love and man-kindnesse of God. Its answered,
these fall with equal strength of wanton reason, upon conditional and
universal Redemption, or Gods conditional and universal will to save all,
and every one; for say that a father did foresee, if he beget twenty sons,
that eighteen of them shall be cast in a river of fire, to be burnt quick,
where they shall be tormented ten thousand years, ever dying, and not able to
find death, to end their miseries, and that they may be Kings in great riches
and honor, upon a condition of such and such a carriage of them in their
education, and young years, which this father can easily work with one word;
yet he willingly begets these children, he can work such a condition in
them, as they may all be kings, yet deliberatly this he will not do, but acts
so upon the will of these children, as he knows indeclinably the greatest part
of them all shall be tormented for ten thousand years in this extreme fire.
Who can say, 1. that this father, quantum in se, as far as he can, has
redeemed all, and every one of his children from ten thousand years pain? Who
can say, this father intended and willed the life and honor of these eighteen
children, when as he might with no pain to himself, most easily have wrought
the condition in them, which he wrought in others, and would not? Hence, if
there must be a mystery in the Gospel, and the Lords ways and thoughts must
be above ours, as far as the heaven is above the earth, if the Lord did
foresee the greatest part of mankind, and many legions of Angels should be cast
in chains of darkness, and in a lake of fire and brimstone for ever and ever.
1. Vain reason would say, why did he create them? if he foresaw their
misery would be so deplorable; and how can he earnestly and ardently, with
prayers, obtestations, wishes, threatenings, precepts, promises, desire their
eternal salvation? 2. If he could have hindered them to sin (as no question
he could) without hurting Adams freewill, and without strangling the nature of
free obedience, in reference to threatening of ill, and promising of good, and
life, as we see all Angels, being equally under one law, he kept some from
sin, of free grace, and permitted others to fall in eternal misery; if he
could have hindered them to sin, how created he them, and gave them a law,
which he saw, they would violate, and make themselves eternally miserable? 3.
When the same Gospel was preached to some, yea, and to a huge multitude within
the visible Church, if the Lord willed all and every one to be saved, and gave
his Son to redeem all and every one; was there not an eternal and absolute
will most unlike and disparous to some, beside others, when as he took a way
of working with the Gospel, preached on some, which he saw would eternally,
indeclinably, and inevitably save them, and a contrary way of working with
others, which he foresaw would be fruitless, ineffectuall, and null, and tend
to their sadder condemnation; now can he will both the redemption and salvation
of these that he moves ineffectually to obey, and also efficaciously to obey?
Corvinus says in this, He wills all, ex aequo, equally to be saved, in
regard of his affection, and will to all; but he wills not all equally to be
saved, ex part boni voliti, in regard of the thing willed; for he wills the
Gospel to be preached to some, and of these that hear the Gospel he gives more
grace; yea more grace actu secundo, efficaciously effectual, and denies both
to other Nations and people, and with this distinction, he wills, and wills
not; equally, ex aequo, the salvation of all. But this is Petitio principii,
the disparitie of favors bestowed on persons and Nations, do argue in
Scripture disparitie of good-wills in the Lord; as because God sent his Law and
Testimonies to Israel and Jaakob, and dealt not so with every nation, Psalm.
147.19, 20. Every Page almost in the old Testament, and the Lords Spirit, and
all Divines argue, that the Lord chose Israel, and loved them and saved them,
and with a higher and more peculiar love, as his chosen people, then he loved
all the Nations, Deuteronomy. 7.7. Psalm. 132.12.13.14. Psalm. 135.3, 4. Because he
bestowed on them the means of salvation; his Law and his Testimonies which he
denied to the Nations, then the Nations were not his beloved and chosen ones.

10. That will of God, called voluntas signi, the revealed will of God, that
precepts, promises, and threatenings hold forth, do not express to us the
decree, intention and purpose of God, that he wills the thing commanded to
be, but only that he approves of the thing commanded, as just and good,
whether it be, or be not, what ever the event be: then Gods revealed will is
no more formally, but his approbation of the moral goodness and obedience, of
elect and reprobate, whether they obey, or not.

11. These that Christ offered his body for, as a Priest, for these as a Priest
he intercedes and prays; for these two cannot be separated; but he prays not
for all, not for the world, Joh. 17.9. I pray for them, I pray not for the
world.

12. These for whom Christ is a Priest to offer his body, for them, he is a
King to make them Kings, and to save them, and a Prophet to teach them; but he
is not King and Prophet to any but to his people, kingdom, conquest,
disciples, seed, children, subjects.

13. These that Christ dyed for cannot be condemned, Rom, 8.33, 34. but are
chosen, and cannot be impeached; but the reprobate can be condemned and
impeached.

14. Those whom God wills to save, and whom he redeemed, to these he willed
the means of salvation; but he wills not the means, nor that the Gospel be
preached to the Gentiles, Matthew. 10.5. Nor to Asia, nor Bithynia, Acts 16.6, 7.

15. All that Christ dyed for, are justified and reconciled by his death, and
shall much more be saved by his life, Romans 5.9. 1 John 1.7. And God requires
not one debt twice; if Christ sustained the person of all the el^cted, as he
dyed for his friends, Joh. 15.13. for his Sheep, Joh. 10.11. For his Church,
Ephesians. 5.25. For many, Mat. 20.28. For his enemies, Romans 5.10. For the ungodly,
and unjust, 1 Pet. 3.18. For his brethren, Hebr. 2. 1 John 3.16. and not for
their good only, so as they might all and every one have perished eternally,
that Christ dyed for; then cannot they dye eternally, for then Christ should
first have paid their debt, and they must pay for that debt over again,
eternally in hell; then might Christ be a Redeemer, a King, a Priest, a
Husband, a Savior, and head, and have no ransomed ones, no subjects, no Israel
that he interceds for, and offers his soul, no Spouse, no saved people, no
memhers, no Church.

Artic. 4. Places of Scripture seeming to favor universal atonement,
vindicated.

For the fourth particular, and the clearing of places alleged; We are 1. to
consider if the place John 3.16. prove any thing against us. 2. If all men, and
all the world that are said to be redeemed, be concludent against us. 3. There
be some particular places to be considered.

1. The word (...), World, must be a figurative speech, the whole for the
part, otherwise in its latitude it comprehends the Angels, Acts 17.24. Romans
3.6. 1 Cor. 6.2. Romans 1.20. Joh. 17.5. Now its certain, God has not so loved
Angels, good and bad, that he has given his only begotten Son for them,
Hebr. 2.16. therefore it must sometime signify, a great part of the world; as
John 12.19. The world goes after him. 1 Ioh. 5.19. Yhe whole world lies in
evil; The Adversary yields, that the ( world) here, is not all, and every
one of mankind, without exception. I deny not but it signifies so, Romans 3.13.
That all the world may become guilty before God. But the Arminians take on them
a hard task, duram proviciam; to prove that it is so taken here. For 1. the
word (...), God so loved the world, is the highest love that ever was, above
Gods love to the Angels, The place, Ioh 3.16. favors not universal Redemption.
Heb. 2.16. So God must carry the most superlative love; that is, then which
there is none greater, John 15.13. Such a love as is manifested to us, to the
beloved John the Apostle, and all the Saints, 1 Ioh. 49. to Cain, Judas, and
all the heathen; and God love giving his Son, differenceth men from Angels,
but not one man from another; the contrary of which Paul says, Gal. 2.20 and
must Paul say no more? Who loved me, and gave himself for me, then Judas,
Pharaoh, all the lost heathen, who never heard of Christ, can, and may say?
believe it who will, it sounds not like Christ's love.

2. They have two sorts of love in Christ's dying for men, to make out two
Redemptions, one general, one potentiall, or half a Redemption; where life is
purchased, never applied, standing with the eternal destruction of the
greatest part of mankind; another special, in which men are Redeemed from
sin, preached to few, applied to far fewer.

3. Two Reconciliations; two non-imputations of sin; one 2 Cor 5. another
Romans 4. and so two justifications; one Rom 5. and two blessednesses, and two
salvations, or deliveries from wrath, and the curse of the Law.

4. This giving love, with which God must give all other things, faith, the
Gospel, Romans 8.32. must be bestowed on heathen that never heard such a thing.

5. God by this must intend life eternal, as an end to all the heathen; Faith
as a mean, which are clearly intended to this loved world; and yet God
forbids Paul and his Apostles to preach the word of faith to them, Acts 16.6,
7. Math. 10.5. and contrives businesses so, that the hearing of the word of
faith, and of this highest love, and rarest gift, and given Redeemer, shall be
simply unpossible to them.

The loved world cannot mean all and every individual person of the world.
6. Therefore better by the ( World) understand the elect of Jews and Gentiles,
opposed every where in the New Testament, to the narrow Church of Judea; the
Gospel-world, the Messiahs-world, larger then the little world of Moses; yea,
all Nations, Math. 28.19. Every creature, that is most of all the Nations,
Mark. 16.15. all the world, the hearing world, almost all the Nations Colloss.
1.6. sure not every individual person; as they would have this loved world to
include.

Ob. But (...) that every one that believes etc. these words, limit, and draw
narrow the world, and so divides it in believers, and not believers, and by
your exposition, some of the elect world believes, and are saved; some believes
not, and perishes, which is absurd; therefore the (world) must be
comprehensive of all, elect, and reprobate.

An^w. 1. I shall deny that (...) whosoever, is here a distributive or dividing
particle: Whosoever, or everyone (...) ^oldeth not forth a d^strubation ever.
If he had said (...) or (...) as Gal. 5.4. 1 Cor. 11.27. There had been some
color for this; but I deny that (...) or (...) all must be restrictive here,
more then. 2 Thessalonians. 2.11.12. God gave them over to the efficacy of error to
believe a lie, that (...) that all those might be damned, that believe not the
truth; but have pleasure in unrighteousness. It follows not that (...) here,
that all or who ever believe not the truth; should be fewer in number then
those that are given over to the efficacy of error: yea, the number of the one
and the other is equal, so Ioh. 5.22. The Father judges no man, but has
committed all judgment to the Son. verse. 23. (...) that all men should
honor the Son, as they honor the Father who sent him. I see no ground to
say, that some may honor the Father, and be raised from the dead and
quickened, as ver. 21. who do not honor the Son. And therefore it ought not
to be translated, God so loved the world, etc. That whosoever believes should
not perish; but far more agreeably to the original, God so loved the world,
that every one believing should not perish: as in multitude of places it is
translated, unusquisque, non quicunque; and therefore faith is not set down
here so much ad modum conditionis, as ad modum medi^, as a condition, as a
means to bring this loved world to glory: as if ye would say, he so loves
letters, as all learned are dear to him; See Amesius in his Anti-synodala.
so God so loved his chosen world, that he gave his Son to die for them, (now
this love is eternal) that all these believing in their own time, might never
be lost, but have eternal life. Nor can Arminians take the world ( world) for
all and every one of mankind, for they exclude all infants dying so, as
incapable of faith; and they say these words contain Gods special decree of
election, and reprobation; to wit, Ioh. 3.16. God decreed to save all that
believe, and God decreed all that believe not should perish. Now from Election,
and Reprobation, they exclude all the Heathen, and all their infants, and all
infants whatsoever, and such as never heard the Gospel: so I fear they make as
narrow a world here; as we do, let them see to it: Whereas Arminians say that
the word world, never signifies in Scripture the elect only; what then? Let
me answer. 1. Their world of elect and reprobate, excluding the best part of
mankind, all infants, all that never heard the Gospel; sure is not in the
Scripture, nor speaks it of such a world. 2. This is a begging of the question,
for Ioh. 1.29. The world whose sins the Lamb of God takes away; the Reconciled
world to whom the Lord imputes no sin (...), One elect worldu Script^re.
its the same word that is ascribed to Abraham's believing, Romans 4.3. verse. 4.5.
And that David speaks of Psalm. 32.2. Romans 4.6. The imputing of righteousness,
and of Faith to righteousness; that in which blessedness coming through
Christ consists, Romans 4.8, 9, 10, 11. This world is the only believing elect
world, the loved world Joh. 3.16. the world saved, verse. 17. the world of which
Christ is Savior, Ioh. 4.42. the world that Christ gives his life unto, Ioh.
6.33. and for whose life, he gives his life, v. 55. the world of which
Abraham; but much more, Christ is heir, Romans 4.13. The reconciled world,
occasioned by the Jews falling off Christ, Romans 11.15. all these are the elect
believing, and Redeemed world, this they can never disprove.

The other ground of our answer to all the places on the contrary, is that the
word (...), and (...); Christ died for all: does never signify all and every
one of mankind, by neither Scripture, nor the doctrine of adversaries: But is
as all Divines say, to be expounded according to the subject in hand, secundum
materiam substratam.

The 1. rule for expounding the particle all
Hence our 1. Rule, All; often signifies, the most part, Mark 1.64. (...) they
all condemned him to be guilty of death (...), the whole counsel, Matthew.
26.59. yet Joseph of Arimathea, consented not to his death, Luke 23.51. and the
flood destroyed (...) them all Luke 17.27. yet eight persons were saved; so all
Judah, Jer. 13.19. (...) was carried into captivity, (...) All is often the
same with many, all the sheep of Kedar shall be gathered to thee, (...) that is
many, and Genesis 41. (...) and all the land came to Egypt, when the matter bears
a clear exception, and other Scriptures expound it; then sure Christ's dying for
all, must be expounded for his giving himself a ransom for many. Matthew.
20.28. compared with 1. Tim. 2.6. (...) is here, and there (...), Omnes
videntur sacere (vel pat^) quod (...) major p^^s. Pande^t quod major.
So the Law says all do that which the most part do; men's will does not
limit what God speaks, but let the text it self be diligently considered,
Exodus 9.6. All the castle of Egypt died, that was in the field. Christ gave
himself a ransom for all, capable of a ransom; Arminians say that the
finally obdured, those that sin against the Holy Ghost, and infants of
Heathen, or any dying infants, cannot be ransomed by Christ, Exodus 32.26. All
the sons of Levi came to Moses; not all without exception. Many adhered to
Aaron in his idolatry, v. 29. Deuteronomy. 33.9. so Matt. 3.5. Then went out to him
Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country near to Jordan. Now this
signification being applied to our use, Christ giving himself a ransom for
all men, his dying for all, can be no larger then the saving of all, the
believing of all flesh, and the blessing of all nations in Christ; but Genesis
18.18. all in him (...) all the nations of the earth shall be blessed Genesis
22.18. In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, the whole
world that John says Christ is a propitiation for, 1 John 2.1. cannot be
larger then this; now this cannot carry any tolerable sense, Arminians have as
good reason to say all, and every one are saved, and eternally glorif^ed in
Christ, a^ all and every one are Redeemed in him.
that all and every man of the Nations are actually blessed in Christ, more
then all and every one are redeemed, reconciled, received in favor, within the
Covenant of Grace: And therefore Arminians have as good reason from (...) and
(...), all that are said to be ransomed, are all actually saved; and hell
shall be empty and to no purpose, as to contend for a universal Redemption.
As a wicked pamphlet printed of late faith, all the Creation of God, Men, and
Angels are redeemed, and shall at length be saved in Christ. Now we can
undenyably prove, that all and every Nation, and all and every man descended of
Abraham, are not blessed in Christ. (1.) Romans 9.7. Because they that are the
seed of Abraham, they are not all children, but in Isaac shall thy seed be
called. v. 8. They which are the children of the flesh, are not the children of
God, but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. Now Christ has
a spiritual seed of a more narrow compass, then all the Nations of the earth.
Isaiah 53.10. He shall see his seed. Christ marries not with the cursed seed,
and many Nations such as for many Generations never heard of Christ, are under
the Law and under a curse; but the Nations are blessed, and all Nations (say
they) quantum ad Deum, in Gods intention, in the Covenant of Grace that God
made with all the Nations, if they would embrace and receive Christ, but that
they are not actually blessed, fully redeemed, and saved in Christ is their
fault.

Ans. The Scripture expounds Scripture better then Arminians, and the Apostle
Hebr. 6. resolves us that All the Nations of the earth, v. 17. are the heirs
of promise, those who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before
them, who have anchored their souls by hope within the vail, and has Jesus
for their forerunner, v. 17, 18, 19, 20. 2. He expounds the blessing of Abraham
and of his seed, not of any conditional and far-off intention of God, but of
Gods actual blessing of Abraham and his spiritual seed whom the Lord
multiplied, v. 14. Nor was it ever fulfilled in all the Nations of the earth,
they were never heirs of the promise; our Exposition is made good, and by it
the promise and oath of God fullfilled, and his Covenant accomplished; not by
the Arminian gloss. 3. Paul expounds Abraham's seed, Gal. 3.16. to be Christ
and his seed, Romans 11.26. So all Israel shall be saved. This was the Israel to
whom the Covenant by oath and promise was made. For the Redeemer shall come out
of Zion, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. 27. For this is my
covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. Acts 4.33. Great grace
was on them all, yet not on Ananias and Saphira who were of that visible
number, Isai. 40.5. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
shall see it, Psalm. 86.9. All Nations whom thou have made, shall come and
worship before thee, and shall glorify thy Name, O Lord: That is expounded,
Isa. 2.1. All Nations shall flow to the mountain of the Lords house. What? All
nations without exception? No, v. 2. Many people shall say, Come ye, and let
us go to the mountain of the Lords House, Hag. 2.7. And the desire of all
Nations shall come; did all Nations quantum in se, so far as lay in them
desire Christ? no such thing.

2. All skilled in the Mother languages, and all Divines say that the Particle
Ali is taken pro singulis generum, vel pro generibus singulorum; all and every
one of kinds, and for the kinds of all, though not absolutely excluding any
kind.

1. The word All is, in materia necessaria, in a necessary matter, taken for
all, and every one. God made all Nations of one blood, Acts 17.26. He knows
the hearts of all men, Acts 1.24. Romans 3.12. All have sinned, Romans 5.12. 2 Cor.
5.10. 1 Timothy 4.10. Jam. 1.5. Phil. 2.10, 11.

2. All without exclusion of particular men, in a contingent matter is sometime
so taken, Matthew. 26.33. Though all be offended, Luke 6.26. Rev. 4.26.

3. When all is spoken of Gods works for men, or in men, especially works of
mere grace opposite to men's works: All men, then is not taken in the largest
sense, as M. Moor imagines: So our Text; I when I am lifted up from the earth,
will draw all men to me, cannot be meant of all men without exception. 1.
Because its a clear restriction of calling of multitudes, under the Messiahs
Kingdom after his death, and cannot but speak against an universal drawing in
the times of the Old Testament. 2. Christ draws not all to himself by the
Gospel, because thousands hear not of him; not virtually, for we read of no
calling or drawing of Christ, lifted up on the Cross, and crucified by the
works of Nature: So God blesses all Nations, not all and every one; God saves
all Israel, and turns away iniquity from Jacob, and forgiveth the sins of
Israel; and God only saves, and only pardons believers. But will Mr. Moor
say, God saves and pardons all, and every man in Israel?

Rule 3. There is hence a third Rule, that many is placed for all the elect, as
Matthew. 10.28. He gave himself a ransom for many. Mark. 14.14. This is my
blood of the New Testament, that is shed for many, as Romans 5.15. Through the
offense of one, many were dead, that is, all were dead: So the sheep of Christ,
Joh. 10.11. the scattered sons of God, Joh. 11.52. His people, Matthew. 1.21. His
brethren, Hebr. 2. That he died, for, must be exclusive of those that are not
his sheep, not his brethren, not his people, not the Sons of God. When there is
mention of a singular privilege bestowed on friends, whom Christ is to make
friends, Ioh. 15.13. though it be bestowed on them in regard of their present
ill deserving, when they are enemies, Romans 5.10. sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15. unjust,
1 Pet. 3.18. lost, Luke 19.10. As the necessity of the prerogative of
redemption and ransom of free grace clears; As, In thy seed shall all the
Nations of the earth be blessed. Paul expounds it exclusively in thy seed
only, Gal. 3.16. So Deuteronomy. 10.20. Thou shall fear the Lord thy God, and serve
him. Christ expounds it, Luke 4.8. exclusively, Thou shall serve only the
Lord, because its the prerogative of God, to be worshipped, as its a
prerogative of grace, to be the ransomed and redeemed of God, Deuteronomy. 21.8. and
7.8. Exodus* 15.15. Luke 1.68. Gal. 3.13. 1 Pet, 1.18. Revel. 5.9. and Revel.
14.4. Isai. 1.24. and 44.23. and 35.10. and 51.10. Jer. 31.1^. and the manner
of Christ's dying in regard of application is exclusive by confession of party,
and as is clear, Luke 2.11. and 1.68, 69, 70. Luke 2.30, 31. Heb. 2.17. Romans
8.34. Revel. 5.9.

Rule 4. In the matter of our Redemption, especially in the New Testament, and
prophecies of the Old of the same subject, Christ died for all pro generibus
singulorum, for men of all Nations, some of all kinds. 1. Because God speaks
so of our salvation, as Io^l* 3.28. which was fulfilled, Acts 2.17. And it
shall come to pass in the last days, (says God) I will pour out my Spirit
on all flesh; that is, people of all Nations, as v. 9. Parthians, and Medes and
Elamites* and the dwellers in Mesopotamia* and Judea, Cappado^ia, etc. And of
all Sexes, v. 17. Sons and daughters. Of all ages, ^ong and old* All
conditions, servants and handmaids. Verse 5. And there were dwelling at
Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every Nation under heaven; nor will this
include all and every Nation without exception. Erasmus would ask of those
that will not admit an Hyperbole in Scripture, if there were English and Scots
there. Ye tithe every herb, that is, Herbs of all kinds. Luke 11.42. Christ
cured every disease, Matthew. 4. 23. Ye shall eat of every tree of the garden,
Genesis 2.16. (...) all his masters goods are in his hand (...) Genesis 24.10. Now
thus God will have all to be saved, and Christ is the Mediator of all men, 1 Timothy 2. which is not to be understood of all and every man, but of Kings and
low men, and all conditions of men; the word (...); is thrice used in the Text.
1. We are no where, but in this place only commanded to pray for all men, but
if for the eternal salvation of all and every one without exception, is the
doubt. You shall not find a warrant in the Word to pray that all mankind may
be saved absolutely, for God has revealed in his Word, that he has decrees of
Election and Reprobation of men. 2. And has expressly forbidden to pray for
their salvation, that sin to death, 1 John 5.16. And what Faith have we to
pray for such; for the salvation of Magistrates in that notion only we may
pray; for the peace of Babylon, The pla^^ 1 Timothy ^. God will have all men to be
saved, He gave himself a ransom for all men, discussed.
and for peace of Heathen Princes, the Church being under them. 3. God will
have all men to be saved, no other ways then he will have all to come to the
knowledge of the truth, that is, of the Gospel. Now how he will have all men
without exception to come to the knowledge of the Gospel, since this natural
Antecedent and conditional will to save all was in God toward the fallen
Angels and the Gentiles in the time of the Old Testament, when the Law of God
and his will touching salvation, through the Messiah to come was only revealed
to the Jews, Deuteronomy. 7.7. Psalm. 1 47.19, 20. Let Arminians see, for sure the
Gospel is not, and has never been preached to all and every rational
creature, and to all men, yet he wills all men (by Arminians grounds) to come
to the knowledge of the Gospel. Now we know not how God who has this natural
will eternally in him, as they say, wills the heathens to come ^o the
knowledge of the Gospel, except he send Apostles with the miraculous gift of
tongues, to them to preach in their language. 4. He instances in a specie of
the all he spoke of v. 1. in Magistrates though Heathen. Thanksgiving here for
all and every man must also be commanded as well as prayer, even for Julian and
the greatest scourges and bloody Scorpions, that lay heaviest stripes on the
back of the Church; Sure we have no faith to believe this in reference to their
salvation.

5. Paul must here speak of the Lords effectual will, whom he saves, The
place 2. Pet. 3.9. The Lord will have no^e to perish, and^, opened.
and will have to be saved, and to hear the Gospel, they must be saved. So the
Apostle, 2 Pet. 3.9. (8.) The Lord is long-suffering, (...), to us, willing
none (of us to whom he is long-suffering) to perish, but will have all us, to
whom he extends this long-suffering, to come to repentance. For he gives a
reason why the day of judgment comes not so quickly, but is so delayed, that
lustful men scoffs at it; because God waits till all the elect be gathered
in; they should perish, and should not come to the knowledge of the truth, if
the Lord should hasten that day, as Matthew. 24. For the Elects sake, the ill
days are shortened, not for the reprobate. So to this ransom, Paul verse. 7. is
appointed a Preacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth; this must be the
Gentiles that believe and come to the knowledge of the truth; nor did Paul bear
this testimony to all, and every one of the Gentiles, yet Arminians say, God
will have all and every one of Jews and Gentiles saved and ransomed; as also
he restricts the peaceable and godly life to the Church, taking in himself,
(...), etc. that we may lead, etc.

6. His reason; There is one God; so much as of all orders in the Christian
Church, there is one God: the King and Magistrate, as touching his office has
not one God, and the poor another God, Calvin. Comment* in loc. ^e.
the Jews have not one God, and these I preach to, the Gentiles verse. 7.
another; the husband has not one God, and the wife another: for these three
orders. Magistrates, and these that are under them, Jews, Gentiles, Husband,
Wives, are in the Text; and if that poor argument of Master Moors had blood
or nerves, because there is one God; and because he names (...), Men, therefore
God will save all, and the Ransom must be as wide and spacious as the reason,
God is God to all, and every one, and all and every man is a man; it may prove
that these that blaspheme and sin to death; these of Bythinia, and Samaria,
and all the Gentiles, that the Lord wincked at, and did not invite to
repentance, Act. 14.17. they left off to be men; and God was not a God in
relation to them, as to the work of his hands; for sure God is not in covenant
with all and every one of mankind, for thousands that are men, are without the
covenant. I demand of this universal will of God, to save all and every one,
and the ransom for all and every one, was it ever heard off, in one letter in
the Old Testament, except, by prophesying what was to be under the New? Never.
Now was there not one God, and one Mediator, in the Old, as in the New? And
natural and universal desires and wills in God, to save men as men, and that
God should save men as one God, do not rise and fall in God; but sure his will
called his command, and revealed in the Gospel is larger under the Gospel, nor
it was before the Messiahs time; otherwise God no otherwise willed all men to
be saved, amongst the Jews, as their God, in covenant with them, then he
willed all the Gentiles, and every man of the heathen to be saved, which
contradicts Old and New Testament broadly; for in the time of the Old
Testament, God willed not, Moab, Ammon, Tire, Sidon, Philistims, Egyptians, to
come to the knowledge of the truth, and Gospel, 2 Samuel 7.23. Deuteronomy. 4.34. Psalm.
147.19.

7. God no more wills all, and every man to be saved, and come to believe; so
they will all, and every one believe; then he wills all and every one to be
damned; so they believe not and refuse the Gospel: the one will is as
universal as the other.

8. It is no justice, that the ransom should be paid for all, and every one,
A^l the ra^somed are saved.
and the captives remain in prison eternally; its against the law, Exodus
21.^0. Exodus 30.12, 15. Ye the Lords Ransomed, Esai. 35.9, 10. Must obtain
everlasting joy in Sion. Esai. 51.10, 11. They shall obtain joy and gladness,
and sorrow and mourning shall fly away; And Hos. 13.14. 1 Cor. 15.54. They are
ransomed from the grave. Let them find in all the Old or New Testament, any
ransomed of the Lord, and ransomed from the grave, cast in outer darkness, where
there is weeping and gnashing of teeth; they are redeemed from all iniquity,
purified as a peculiar people, Tit. 2.14. 1 Pet. 1.18. Gal. 1.4. 1 Pet. 2.24.

9. This ransom is to be testified in due time, or as 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. was
manifest in these last last times, (...); For you (the elect of God) that
believe by him.

Rule 5. (...), or (...), is undeniably expounded of all that are saved only,
and is restrictive; Rule. 5.

in wearing out his Spirit, and taking the burden of judging all the people
himself alone, Number 11.13. and his words bear not, that all the people without
exception came for judgment, that had been unpossible; but because there was
then no other Judge, but Moses; the sense is clear, all that were to be
judged, they were to be judged by no other, but by Moses only. Revel. 13.8.
And all that dwell in the earth worshipped the beast, that is, all seduced to
Popish Idolatry, were seduced by the beastly Vicar of Christ, and his limbs.
Joh. 11.48. If we let him alone, all will believe in him; that is, none will
believe in us, nor follow us; and all seduced men, shall be seduced by him.
Joh. 3.26. John's disciples a little emulous, that Christ drew all the water
from their Masters Mill; say, Behold he baptizeth, and (...), all men come to
him; that is, there be now no comers, nor followers of men, but such as follow
this Jesus. That Christ in this sense should be the Savior of all men, that he
should have a negative voice in the salvation of all, that all the ransomed
ones should come through his hands, is no other thing then Peter says, Act.
4.11. That there is no other Name under heaven, by which men may be saved, and
none comes to the Father, but by him, Joh. 14.6. then all that come to God,
come by him only. Christ is the heir of blessings, and in him all the kindreds
of the earth are blessed, Act. 3.25. but it follows as well all, and every
mortal man, are glorified, as redeemed, by this Logic; Out of his fullness, we
All, (...), all that receive, do receive from him, Joh. 1.16.

The common nature of man proves not Christ to redeem all, and every one.
Upon this is grounded the common nature of all that Christ assumed, that no man
should be saved, but by a man. Hence (say Arminians) Look how far the nature
of man extendes the ransom extends as far: But (says Master Moore) the
nature is common to Adams Sons, all, and every one, as Men
contra-distinguished from Angels, Hebr. 29, 16. But there is a wide difference
between the fitness and aptitude that man should dye for man, Universality of
free grace, cap 1^. page 63.64.65.
not an Angel for a man, and the intention and good will of God, that Christ
should either take on him the nature of man to die for mankind, rather then for
Angel-kind, Heb. 2.16. And why he should dye for this man, Peter, or John, not
that man Pharaoh or Judas; the reason of the former was the infinite wisdom of
God, seeing a cong^uity of justice in it, that the nature that sins should
suffer for sin. Whether Christ having a soul of a spiritual nature as
Angels, might have fitly been a suffering Savior for them, (which may be
thought possible) is another question. But the reason of the other is only the
grace of God, who could give a hire, or a price to Christ, to move him to die
for you, and effectually, and savingly, by gifting you with faith, and not for
another? All the Jesuits, Arminians, Papists, Socinians, for their selves if
provoked, shall not answer, except there be a Fountaine-will, that solveth
all, touching Men and Angels, He has mercy on whom he will, and hardens whom
he will: and who has giv^n to him first, and it shall be recompensed? And with
as good reason; Because Christ is glorified at the right hand of God, in man's
nature, common to all Adams sons, may they infer, that all, and every man, is
risen again from the dead with Christ. As Col. 3.1, 2. and all, and every man,
is set with Christ in heavenly places, Ephesians. 2.6. and so all and every man
must be glorified with Christ. For as Christ dyed, in a nature common to all
men; so in a nature common to all, he rose again, ascended to heaven, is
glorified at the right hand of God. But the truth is, Christ assumed that
nature that is common to all men, but not as common to all men, but as the seed
of Abraham, Hebr. 2.16. as the flesh and blood of the children, verse. 14. of
his brethren, not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, that
are, or were to be borne again.

And it is true, Jesus. Hebr. 2.9. is made a little lower then the Angels. The
place Heb. 2.9. He tasted death for every man opened.
I hope the comparison is not with all and every one of the Angels: he was
never made a little lower then all Angels, even evil Angels. Nor (^.) has he
tasted of death for every man; that is, for all and every son of Adam. 1. We
know no grace as common to all and every one of Adams sons, as nature. 2.
Because the Scripture makes nature, wrath, sin, death, common to all. Romans
5.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Romans 3.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Job 14.4.
Psalm. 51.5. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3. Hebr. 9.27. But for grace, the word of the
covenant, a covenant of grace, Reconciliation into grace and favor with God;
justification, we know no such things common to all, and every one of Adams
sons; for then all must be borne, the covenanted, justified, reconciled,
beloved with the greatest love that is, Joh. 15.13. ransomed, redeemed, in
Christ's blood, a people, near in the beloved, chosen as peculiar to God, as
well as heirs of wrath. (2) That some sins against the first covenant are
taken away in Christ, and not all, as 1 John 1.8. or some halfe-redeemed in
Christ's blood, not wholly, we know not. (3) That Christ should taste death for
all, it being as good, as if all in person had not only sipped, but drunken
death out to the bottom, and yet that the greatest part must drink death to
the bottom again, is no Gospel Truth. (4) Nor is the Apostles argument of
weight, to exalt Christ, as he entendeth, Hebr. 2. to say, Christ so tasted
death for all; as all and every one, notwithstanding many never have, either
saving faith, or fruit of his death, but eternally perish: whereas clear it
is, that these (...), all that he dyed for are the many sons he actually
brings to glory, verse. 10. these who are one with him, as the Sanctifyer
Christ, and the Sanctified, verse. 11. His brethren, whom he is not ashamed to
own, verse. 11. the Church, verse. 12. the children that God has given him,
verse. 13. the children partakers of flesh and blood. verse. 14. these for whom
he through death, which he tasted for all, and for whom he destroyed him that
had the power of death, that is, the devil; if the devil reign in the sons
of disobedience, Ephesians. 2.2. If they be borne of the devil, Joh. 8.44. Taken
captives at his will, 2 Timothy 2.26. Let Arminians see how Christ by tasting
death for them, as they phancie, Hebr. 2.9. has for them by death, Destroyed
the Devil. verse. 14. Loosed his works, 1 Ioh. 3.8. Triumphed over devils, Col.
2.15. Judged and cast out the devil, Ioh. 12.31. Ioh. 14.30. Yea, these all,
these are delivered from bondage of death, Heb. 2.15. The seed of Abraham,
verse. 16. His brethren that he is made like to in all things, except sin.
Hebr. 2.17. His people, verse. 17. The tempted that Christ succoureth, verse. 18.
I defy any Divine to make sense of that Chapter, as Arminians expound, tasting
of death for all men.

And the second Adam must come short of the first Adam, Romans 5. by the Arminian
exposition; The place, Romans 5 disc^ss^d.
and the comparison must be as the legs of a cripple, both here, and 1 Cor.
15. for by the first Adam many be dead. What be these many? All and every one
of mankind, that are the natural heirs coming forth of the loins of the
first Adam: Then who be the (...), many to whom the grace of God has abounded?
verse. 15. sure the second Adam is no dry tree, no Eunuch; the Scripture says,
He has a seed, Isai. 53.10. many sons, Heb. 2.10. children that God has
given him, that are for signs and wonders, Isai. 8.18. Heb. 2.13. a seed in
covenant with God, David's spiritual seed, who shall never fall away, Psalm.
89.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. Then as all the first Adams sons,
and heirs were through his offense dead; so all Christ's spiritual seed, and
heirs, have grace communicated to them, ver. 15. this is far from grace,
Compare the heirs of first Adam, and the heirs of the second, and the place,
Romans 5. is for us much.
abounding to all and every one of the heirs of the first Adam; then as the
first Adam killed none but heirs naturally descended of him: so the second
Adam derives grace, and the gift of life to none, but to his spiritual heirs;
make an union by birth, between the first Adam and all his, and between the
second Adam and all his; and stretch the comparison no farther then Paul, and
let Arminians enjoy their gain by this Argument.

2. Verse. 16. Sin and judgment to condemnation not intended only; but real
and efficacious came on all by the first Adam, for all that live, incur
sin, and actual condemnation by the first Adam; but the free gift is of many
unto justification: then justification not intended only, which may never fall
out, but real, not virtuall, or potentiall, or conditional, if their
forefathers have not rejected the covenant; but efficacious and actual, came
upon all the heirs, and seed, (...).
of the second Adam.

3. Paul compares ver. 15. the offense (...) of one, the first sin of Adam
that came on all, with the justification (...), from many offenses. The
justification spoken of here, which we have in the second Adam, is not a
pardon of sin original, and of a breach of the first covenant; so as we
begin to sin, and God reckons with us on a new score, but the justification
here is from many offenses, and the blood of Jesus, purges us from all sins.
1 John 1.8. This justification runs not up from the womb, as the offense of
Adam does. For, 1. Where are there two justifications in Christ's blood? 2.
Where is there in Scripture a righteousness of all and every one, a
justification in Christ's blood, by nature or from the belly, and that of Turks,
Indians, Americans, and their seed, and of all infants, in all the Scripture?

4. Verse. 17. By one man's offense there was a cruel King, Death the King of
terrors, who has a black scepter, set over all and every man without
exception. Here we grant an universal King the first and second death; As when
a Conqueror subdues a Land, he sets over them a little King, a Lieutenant in
his place: now the other part of the similitude, and the antitype is so much
more, they that receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness
shall reign, shall be Kings in life (eternal) through one Jesus Christ. ver.
17. See the heirs and sons of the second Adam, are not all and every one of
the mortal stock of Adam, redeemed, reconciled, saved; but (...), these that
receive abundance of Grace, and of the gift of righteousness; only I appeal
to the conscience of Arminians, if Turks, Jews, Tartarians, Americans, Indians,
all Heathen, and all infants come in as (...), and as these that for the
present, are under the fat drops of the second Adam, and receive abundance of
grace and righteousness. For their universal righteousness is poor and
thin, and may be augmented. 2. If they receive it conditionally, so they
believe, then its not universal. 3. Then they are not (...), all are not
believers by nature, all are not by this, within the new covenant actually:
They have but a far off venture, and a cast off abundance of grace. Farther,
Paul by this makes glory as well as grace universal, and all and every one
must be borne heirs of Heaven; for Paul says of the heirs of the second
Adam (...): Here be Kings for a King; there was one Catholic Tyrant Death,
set over all men; But there be here heirs of the second Adam, made Kings of
life and glory through Jesus Christ. ver. 18. If it be said, its life
conditionally, if they believe; consider then, if the second Adam be not
weaker then the first; the first indeclinably, really, without a miss
transmitted death to all his; the second Adam cannot transmit life to the
thousand part of his; but as he misseth in the far greatest part of his
heirs (if all mortal men be his heirs) he may miss in all, Arminius
Antiperkins.
if free will so think good. Arminius says, constare potuit integer fructus
mortis, etc. The fruit of the second Adams death might stand entire, through
all and every one of mankind were damned; If this be a potentiall
justification: its good, its not Paul's justification, Romans 8. Whom he
justified, them he also glorified, nor speaks the Scripture of any such
justification, but of such as makes the party justified, blessed, Romans 4.6, 7.
as has faith joined with it, Romans 3.26. Romans 5.1. as cleanses us from all our
sins. 1 John 1.8. (5.) The Reconciled shall much more be saved, Romans 5.10.
they are friends, not enemies, (enemies and reconciled are opposed in the text)
and then they cannot be strangers, nor far off; but built upon the
foundation of the Prophets, and Apostles, who of enemies are reconciled, Ephesians.
2. Col. 1.19.20. And so shall far more be saved, by the life of Christ; but
all and every one of mankind, shall not much more be saved by the life of
Christ, 6. There is an ( all men) under condemnation, and an ( all men)
justified: Let any of common sense judge, if ye ought not in equity, to
compare the Heirs, Sons, Seed, of the first and second Adam together, and
then let the two Alls run on equal wheels, and see what Arminians gain by
this; for if ye compare all in the loins of the first Adam on the one side,
with all in the loins of the second, and yet never in the second Adam; but as
great strangers to Christ, as those that are out of Christ, enemies, sons of
the bondwoman, strangers to Christ, without God and Christ in the world; on the
other side, the sides are unequal, and beside the holy Ghosts mind; except
ye show us a second birth, a communion supernatural of justification, of free
grace, of sonne-ship, of redemption of mercy, between Jesus Christ, and all and
every one of mankind, Heathens, Jews, Gentiles; This I fear must send all the
Arminians in Europe to their Book, to seek what cannot be found. The place 1
Cor. 15. in Christ all shall be made alive, cleared.


And its as easy to answer, 1 Cor. 15. for as many in number as die in Adam,
are not by that Text, made alive in the second Adam; for (...) all notes not
equality of number. But as the heirs of the first Adam have death in heritage
by him, so the heirs of the second Adam have life by him, and all in each,
notes all of each quality, not of each number, for the all quickened by Christ,

Such as are the first fruits, of the same kind of dead with Christ; for Christ
and all his, are as one corn-field of wheat gathered into one barn, v. 23. 5.
They are quickened with the same Spirit, that Christ was quickened withal, but
in their own order, life comes to the head first; and if Paul's mind be that
Christ as Head and Redeemer raises all the Elect and Reprobate by this Text,
then sure the Reprobate must be a part of the field whereof Christ is the first
sheafe, else the Text shall not run; but for Paul's purpose it was enough to
prove the resurrection of believers principally.

The place 1 John 2.1, 2. cleared.
The place 1 John 2.1. the world and the whole world, is the world that has an
Advocate established in heaven, for if we sin, we have an advocate, who is a
propitiation not for us Jews only to whom I write, but for the sins of the
whole world both of Jews and Gentiles, for the propitiation and the Advocation
are of the same circumference, and sphere; else the Argument should be null;
but the Advo^ation of our High Priest in the holy of holiest at the right hand
of God is for the people of God, only Hebr. 9.24. for us, as the High Priest
carried only the iniquity of the people of Israel, and their names engraven on
his breast, for those for whom he has purchased an eternal Redemption, with
the sprinkling of blood to purge the conscience from dead works to serve the
living God, v. 12, 13, 14. For those to whom he left peace in his Testament,
and the promise of eternal inheritance, v. 15, 16, 17. And for those that look
for Christ's second appearing to salvation, and for those for whose faith he
prays, Luke 22.31, 32, 33. and for whom he prays the Father, that he may
send the holy Spirit, Joh. 14.16, 17. and 16.7. For all these Christ does as
our High Priest Hebr. 9.10. intercede.

2. It is clear the persons cannot be so changed, if we sin we have a
propitiation; if we confess, the blood of Jesus shall cleanse us from all
sins: And by the sins of the whole world, he understands all that did, or
should believe, of Jew or Gentile, Romans 11.15. 2 Cor. 5.19. Joh. 1.29. and
^.16. the whole world, loved, pardoned, reconciled, to whom sins are not
impu^ed, and so blessed and justified, Psalm. 32.1, 2, 3, 4. and wh^^^as the
Apostle ascends, and not for our sins only, etc. it is not to extend
propitiation, further then advocation, confession, knowing that we know him;
that is, petitio principii, for John does not conclude a comfort of Christ's
advocation, which is undeniably peculiar and proper only to those that have
fellowship with the Father and Son, and have believed in the Word of life, are
purged from all their sins, from a general propitiation common to those that
are eternally damned, and which may have its full and entire fruit, though all
the world were eternally damned: It were a poor comfort to weak ones, who sin
daily, and are liars, if they should say they have no sin, that there is no
better salve in heaven for their sin, then such a one, as they may no less
perish eternally having it, then Pharaoh, Cain, Judas, it were better for them
to want it, as have it.

as if Christ had redeemed those from their vain conversation, 1 Pet. 1.18. and
from the present evil world, Gal, 1.4. for then he should have redeemed them
from Apostasy, and the power of damnable heresies, which he did not, but in
their profession they were bought, and so the Apostle more sharply convinces
them, for they were teachers in profession, but really wolves that devoured the
flock, but professed themselves to be Shepherds sent to seek the lost. 2. They
were Heretical Teachers, and brought in damnable Heresies, and therefore
Christians and professed Christ to be their Lord; for if they had been without
and open enemies, they could not bring in Heresies. 3. They did it covertly and
privily, teaching and doing one thing, and professing another; they professed
the Lord to be their Redeemer who bought them, but that they were Hypocrites is
clear, verse 1. (...) they shall bring in heresies in the by, at a side,
privily. 2. By reason of them the way of truth shall be blasphemed; enemies
shall speak ill of the Gospel, because these men profess the Redeemer who
bought them, but yet they are covetous men, v. 3. (3.) They buy and sell you
(...) with decked up and well kammed fair words. O our Redeemer that bought us,
our Savior! O free grace! O free Redemption! as Libertines now do, and yet
they that deny sanctification, deny Christ who in their profession bought them;
and its ordinary for Scripture to affirm things of men as they speak and
profess; as the Scripture calls wolves, Prophets, Jer. 23. because they so
profess themselves; Christ called Judas friend, but he was but a face friend,
and a real enemy, so Pharisees are styled by the Holy Ghost, Matthew. 9.12, 13.
whole and righteous, just persons that need no repentance, Luke 15.7. such as
need not the Physician, Mark 2.17. because they are such only in their own
conceit and vain opinion, not really; if any man say Christ bought these, in
regard that by his death, he purchases a dominion over Elect and Reprobate,
that all knees should bow to him, Men and Angels, Romans 14.8, 9, etc. Isai.
45.2^. Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. Joh. 5.27. Acts 17.31. So that there is a difference
between buying as conquerours, and buying from our vain conversation; I think
it has truth in it, Christ by his death has acquired a dominion; but I much
doubt, if in that sense Scripture say, Christ has bought the Reprobate by his
blood; for so by his blood he has bought Angels, Devils, all things, and all
knees in heaven and earth, and under the earth, for by his death and
resurrection he has acquired this dominion, 1 Timothy 4 10. opened.
Romans 14. God is the Savior of all men, 1 Timothy 4.10. Its not spoken of Christ
as Mediator, but of the living God the Savior of all men, Psalm. 106.8.10.
Matthew. 8.25. Nehem. 9, 27. Psalm. 36.6. (...) is here, and the living God is
given indefinitely to God as one with all the three, but God in Christ is
specially the Savior of believers. Other places for Universal grace, and the
Apostasy of the Saints, I pass here.

Article 5.

The fifth Particular is touching the Faith required of the Elect, and of the
Reprobate, within the visible Church: which ere I enter in, let this one
necessary doctrine clearing that point much, be observed; That if Christ draw
all men to him.

Doct. He must have a singular and special good will and liking to save
sinners, in that strongly and seriously, he draws all sorts of men to
himself.

as touching the revealed damnation of any sort of persons; Christ is no
ingrosser, and never loved to make a Monopoly of Grace; he sets down his will
in positive comfortable positions, Ioh. 6.39. This is the Fathers will which
has sent me, that of all which he has given me, I should loose nothing, but
raise it up at the last day. Joh. 5.24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he has
hears my word and believes in him that has sent me, has everlasting life,
and shall never come to condemnation.

2. Christ had so good mind to save, That 1. He did not send only, but the King
came in person, 1 Timothy 1.15. How low and near Christ came to save.
Luke 19.10. The Son of man came to seek and to save, etc. 2. He cried not
afar off, but came near hand to draw, he came so near as within the reach of
his arm to save us. 3. When a rope is cast down to prisoners in a pit, if it
come not within the compass of their reach, and if it be too far for a
short arm, it can do no good for the help of the prisoner; therefore he came
below us, and under all our infirmities, to put his shoulders under the lost
sheep, Luke 15.5. Love must sweet, and stoop low to save.

3. Christ's good will is held forth in as large terms, saving the Lords
liberty of Election and Reprobation, as can be; and that in six wide
expressions, that no man should complain, Oh, I am a dry tree, because we are
inclined to forge forced quarrels against the Lamb of God, as if he loved not
us; and its an answer to those that naturally complain of absolute Election; As
1. The weakest are readiest to move doubts.

Object. 1. I am sinful, and sinfully sick, and I have jealousies of the
Physician. Doubts of those that our of weakness cannot believe.


Ans. The Physician came to force himself on the sick, Mat. 9.12, 13. sick of
body, are often sick of mind, and passions of the soul rise with humors of
the body; the sick are soon angry and jealous. Christ says, he has a tender
soul for a sick sinner.

Object. 2. But I have little grace or goodness?

Ans. I, can ye have less (says Christ) then a reed? its far below a Tree and
a Cedar; and I will not break a reed, but a broken reed is out of hope, it
cannot do any more good, a reed is weak, but a broken reed, sure, can never
grow: yea, but he cannot break the bruised reed, but powers in oil at the
root of the broken reed, and makes it green and causes it to blossom. So the
fire or light in flax must be less then the fire in timber or wood; but he
will not throw water on flax that has fire, yea, nor on smoking flax that
seems to have fire, and has but smoke.

Object. 3. A broken bone in a living man may be splinted and cured; but the
heart is, ultimum moriens, the last thing of life; if it be broken, the man is
gone; he dies, when the last seat of life the heart is broken. Yea but says
Christ, I can bind u^ the broken in heart, Esai. 61.1. Psalm. 147.3.

Object. 4. If the man be dead and buried, then farewell he, there is an end,
no more of him. Yea, but Christ 2 Cor. 1.9. Ioh. 5.25. raises the dead, and
gives life to dry bones, Ezech. ^7.

2. Some fear they have nothing but an empty profession. To be amongst vis^ble
professors gives a fair h^nt of laying hold on Christ by faith.


Answ. Then the Scripture holds forth the promises to visible Saints, 2 Cor.
7.1. Can ye come in among the crowd of visible Saints? this is preached to all
within the wide Gospel-Nett, and Christ's visible court; Whosoever believes,
shall be saved, Joh. ^.16. Romans 10.9. Ioh. 5.24.

3. Say thou can not come so near as visible Professors, but thou art
nothing but a Publican and a sinner, and that may be thought to be without
Christ's line of mercy. Yet 1. Tim. 1.15. This is a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners. Be
what thou will, as unbelief estrangeth a sinner far enough from Christ, thou
may claim blood and kin to a sinner; then Christ came to call sinners, How
low down and to what general terms, to take all in, the Gospel descends.
1. To indefinite terms of believers. 2. To larger, to sinners. 3 To visible
Saints. 4. To men. 5. To most comprehensive of all. 6. To the world.
and to save sinners, can thou deny thy self to be a sinner.

4. Can thou crowd in amongst the ( We) that are the godly party; there is
h^re room for thee, not to cast off Christ, but that thou may let out a
warm look, and half an hope thou may be one of his; the Gospel-grammar,
is fair and sweet; art not thou amongst an ( Us) that there may be hope. 1
Ioh. 4.9. In this was the love of God toward us, because God sent his only
begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

5. The Scripture casts out a longer rope yet, that thou may reach to
Christ; art thou not a Man; if thou be not a sinner, nor a visible Saint, nor a
bruised Reed; thou art one of mankind; see the Gospel will not have thee to
despair, or to foment and harbor strange, and far-off thoughts of Christ,
Tit. 3.4. But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior, to man
appeared -- he saved us. 1 Timothy 2.3. God our Savior will have (...), all men
to be saved.

6. The farthest from Christ, must be creatures that are nothing, but bits of
the world; now the name World, is a Man, or Sinners, its the farest off-word;
for fallen Angels are members and citizens of the World, therefore the Gospel
is preached to the World, Christ is brought in in the Gospel, as a World-lover;
as if he were a whole World-Saviour, he takes away the sins of the world,
Ioh. 1.29. He so loves the world, Joh. 3.16. He gives his flesh for the life
of the world, Joh. 6.51.

In this Grammar of the Holy Ghost, observe we, by the way, for resoluton, the
wisdom of God, in framing the words of the Gospel. It cannot be said that God
loved all the world in Christ, his beloved, and all, and every sinner, and all
the race of mankind. Yet laying down this ground, that God keeps up in his
mind, the secrets of Election and Reprobation, till he, in his own time, be
pleased to reveal them, the Lord has framed the Gospel-offer of Christ in
such indefinite words, and so general (yet without all double dealing, lying,
or equivocating, for his own good pleasure is a rule both of his doings and
speeches, How wisely the Gospel is contrived in giving to none ground to
despair, and taking in many in Christ's bosom.
) As 1. seldom does the Lord open Election and Reprobation to men, till they,
by grace, or in the order of his justice, open both the one and the other, in
their own ways; and therefore he holds out the offer of Christ, so as none
may cavell at the Gospel, or begin a plea with Christ. 2. Seldom does the
Gospel speak, who they be that are Elect, who Reprobate; yet does the Gospel
offer no ground of presuming on the one hand, or of despairing on the other.
For if thou be not a believer, nor a weak reed, nor a Saint, yet thou ar^ a
sinner, if not that, Nota.
thou art a man, if not that, thou art one of the world; and though the
Affirmative conclude not; I am a sinner, I am a man, I am one of the world, but
it follows not, therefore I am elected to glory, or, Ergo, I am ransomed of
the Lord. Yet the Negative, touching Reprobation, holds. I am a Sinner, I am
of the World, I am a man; hence it follows not, therefore I am a reprobate,
and therefore I have warrant to refuse the promise, and Christ offered in the
Gospel. It follows well therefore, I must be humbled for sin, and believe
in Christ, there is room left for all the Elect, that they have no ground of
standing aloof from Christ, (and the rest never come, and most willingly
refuse to come) nor have the Reprobate ground to quarrel at the decrees of
God, though they be not chosen, yet they are called, as if they were chosen,
and they have no cause to quarrel at conjectures, they have as fair a
revealed warrant to believe, as the Elect have; they are men, sinners of the
world, to whom Christ is offered, why refuse they him upon an unrevealed
warrant?

4. The fourth ground of Christ's good will to draw all men, is that Christ
goes as far in the dispensation of free grace, Grace g^eth along with the
most d^sperate sinners
as sinners, as the chief of sinners; Grace journies all along, and can go no
further then Hell and Damnation, Luke 19.10. The Son of man came to seek,
and to save that which is lost; as if Christ would say, is any man a sinner;
(and who are not) and a lost sinner; see and behold, I am a Savior for that
man. Christ went as low down to Hell, in the freedom of grace, to save, as
Zacheus, in evil doing, to destroy: Mary Magdalen, went as far on toward
Hell, as seven Devils. Grace in Christ went as far on, as to redeem from
seven Devils. Manasseh, as if he had intended to make sure work of Hell,
runs on to empawnd soul and salvation, and gives himself to witchcraft;
observing of times; to cause the streets of Jerusalem, run with blood, to
all abominable idolatry: mercy in the Lord went as near hell to save him. Paul
goes so far on the mouth of the furnace, as to waste the Church of God, and
(...), Act. 8.3. to make heaps of dead men in the Church; and there came
nothing out of his nostrils for breathing and respiration, Act. 9.1. but
threatenings, that is ripe purposes of blood; yea, murdering of the Saints came
out of his mouth; with every word he spoke, but Christ's free grace pursues him
hard, and out-runnes him. Christ's grace came as it were a step below Paul and
saved him. 1 Timothy 1.14. And the grace of our Lord (says he) was more, (...).
or over-abundant in me through faith and love. Jer. 3.1. And thou have played
the harlot with many companions, or lovers, yet return to m^^^ says the Lord.
Its here, as if Christ's rich grace; and our extreme wickedness should strive,
who should descend to the lowest room in Hell, the latter to destroy, the
former to save; and here Christ defies the sinner, to be more wicked, then he
can be gracious.

5. Christ in the Gospel, as a great Conqueror, sends out Writs signed under
his Excellencies hand, The s^rr^w of Chr^sts love t^^t w^ come not to him.
come and meet me, who will, and be saved, as far as graced will can go, as
far goes the good will of the conquering Prince, R^vel. 22.17. Its much
worthy of observation, how that sweet Evangelicke invitation is conceived,
Esai. 55.1. Ho, every one that thirsts, (...) is alas, or ah, every one that
thirsts, come to the waters, and he that has no silver, come buy, and eat: as
if the Lord were grieved, and said, woe is me, alas that thirsty souls should
die in their thirst, and will not come to the water of life, Christ, and drink
gratis, freely, and live. For the Interjection, (...) Ho, is a mark of
sorrowing; as Ah, or woe; every one that thirsts, Esai. 1.4. Ah sinful
nation, or woe, (...) Ah omnis sitie^ s^^e. (...)
(...) to the sinful nation. Verse. 24. Ah, I will ease me, or alas, (...) I
will ease me of my adversaries, Jer. 22.18. They shall not say of Jehojachim,
ho, or alas, or woe to my brother, ah, Sister; It expresses two things, 1. A
vehemency, and a serious and unfamed ardencie of desire, that we do what is
our duty, and the concatenation of these two, extremely desired of God, our
coming to Christ, and our salvation: this moral connection between faith and
salvation, is desired of God with his will of approbation, complacency, and
moral liking, without all dissimulation, most unfainedly; and whereas
Arminians say, we make counterfeit, fained, and hypocritical desires in God,
they calumniate and cavil egregiously, What the revea^e^ will of God is.
as their custom is. 2. The other thing expressed in these invitations, is a
sort of dislike, grief, or sorrow; (its a speech borrowed from man, for there
is no disapointing of the Lords will, nor sorrow in him for the not fulfilling
of it) or an earn^st nilling and hating dislike, that these two should not go
along, as approved efficatiously by us, to wit, the creatures obedience of
Faith, and life eternal. God loves, approves the believing of Jerusalem,
and of her children, as a moral duty, as the hen does love to warm and
nourish her chickens; and he hates, with an exceeding and unfeigned dislike of
improbation and hatred, their rebellious disobedience, and refusing to be
gathered: but there is no purpose, intention, or decree of God holden forth in
these invitations called his revealed will, by which he says, he intends and
wills that all he makes the offer unto, shall obey and be saved. But its to
be observed, that the revealed will of God, Nota.
holden forth to all, called voluntas signi, does not hold forth formally, that
God intends, decrees, or purposes in his eternal counsel, that any man
shall actually obey, either elect or reprobate; it formally is the expression
only of the good liking of that moral and duty-conjunction between the
obedience of the creature, and the reward, but holds forth not any intention
or decree of God, that any shall obey, or that all shall obey, or that none at
all shall obey; and what Arminians say of Christ's intention to die for all, and
every one; and of the Lords intention and Catholic good will, to save all and
every one; to wit, that these desires may be in God, though not any be saved at
all, but all eternally perish, which makes the Lords desires irrational,
unwise, and frustraneous, that we say with good reason of Gods good will,
called voluntas signi, it might have its complete and entire end and effect,
though not any one of men or Angel obey, if there were not going along with
this will of God, another will, and eternal decree and purpose in God, of
working by free grace in some chosen ones, what the Lord wills in his
approving will; and another decree in the which the Lord purposes to deny his
saving grace, upon his absolute liberty to others, that being left to the
hardness of their own hearts, they may freely disobey, and be the sole
Authors of their own damnation. Now because Arminians deny any such two
decrees in God, but assert only such as depend wholly in their fulfilling, A
will to save all, that com^s short of the salvation ^f all, it contrary to the
Lords attributes.
on the free will of Men and Angels, and all the decrees of God may be
frustrated and disappointed by Men and Angels; as if the poor short-sighted
creature, not the Sovereign Creator were carver, and Lord of the decrees, and
Master of work in fulfilling of these counsels. We reject their Catholic
intentions and decrees, to save and redeem all and every one, which they
vainly fancy to be in God, as repugnant to his will, which is irrisistible,
and cannot miss its end. 2. To his immutability, which cannot be compelled to
take a second port, whereas he cannot sail the first. 3. To his Omnipotency,
who cannot be resisted, 4. To his happiness, who cannot come short of what his
soul desires. 5. To his wisdom, who cannot aim at an end, and desire it with
his soul, and go about it, by such means, as he sees shall be utterly
uneffectuall, and never produce his end, and not use these means, which he
knows may, and infallibly does, produce the same end in others. Now this
desire of approbation is an abundantly sufficient closing of the mouth, of such
as stumble at the Gospel, being appointed thereunto, and an expression of
Christ's good liking to save sinners. Expressed in his borrowed wishes, Deuteronomy.
5.29. O that there were such a heart in them, The Lords wishes, exp^s^alations
and crying, bold forth, how ea^nest he is in drawing sinners to himself.
that they would fear me, and keep my commandments. Psalm. 81.13. O that my
people had hearkened unto me, and Israel walked in my ways. Which wish, as
relating to disobeying Israel, is a Figure, or Metaphore borrowed from men, but
otherwise shows how acceptable the duty is to God, how obligatory to the
creature. 2. By the Lords expostulations, Ezekiel. 18.31 Why will ye dye, O house
of Israel. Verse 32. For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies. 3.
In the Lords crying to sinners. Prove. 1.20. Wisdom cries, she utters her
voice in the streets. The Word is to cry with strong shouting, either for joy,
(...)
Psalm. 81.2. or sorrow, Lament. 2.19. which expresses Christ's desire to save
sinners.

6. For the ground and warrant of Christ's willingness to I will draw all men
to me; It is as if he would say, I will baulk no Nation, nor any man, upon a
national respect; the first covenant to the Jews, suffered a mighty exception.
What is God, the God of the Jews only? How Christ draws All.
Have all the Nations of the earth done with their part of Heaven, and
salvation; but only the narrow trinket, and bit of the earth, in po^rel^^^le
Judea? This made the Gospel despised, and liable, to sad and heavy calumnies.
Christ must have narrow bowels, and must be ebb, short, and thin, in free
grace; if the matter be so. Nay but, Christ has mercy for all men; I will
draw all men, that is, multitudes of Jews and Gentiles: for that Christ draws
all and every one without exception, and that by his death, is against
Scripture, and experience; but he has an all that he draws, Tit. 2.11. The
grace of God has appeared to all men (...) what grace? the teaching grace of
God, that teaches us to wait for the blessed hope, and the appearance of the
glory, and of our Savior Jesus Christ: sure, this must be the preached
Gospel; now the Gospel by Scripture experience, consent of Arminians never
appeared, in the least sound, to all and every son of Adam; then Christ must
have another all, a fair and numerous multitude, whom he saves and draws, and
this says he, had a good will to save all, and that his elect ones believe,
Revel. 5.11. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many Angels round about the
Throne, and the beasts, Christ has an all which he saves.
and the Elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand,
and thousands of thousands, v. 12. Saying worthy is the Lamb. Revel. 7.9.
After this, I beheld, and loc, a great multitude, which no man could number, of
all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne,
and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands. It is
true in civil assemblies, and judicatures, Christ has a few number; yet he
has a fair and numerous offspring of children, and when they are gathered
together, they are a fair beloved world: In the Hebrew many and great, are
often one and the same. As one Rubie is worth ten hundredth, one Saphir worth
thousands of common stones; so one Saint, is more then ten thousand wicked men;
then all together they must be an All, a world, a whole world of ransomed ones,
hidden ones, Christ removes all exceptions, that m^n have against their own
believing.
Psalm. 83.4. of the Lords Jewels, Mal. 3.17. and of Christ's precious ones,
Isai. 43.4. they are the flower, and the choice of mankind.

2. Christ is willing to take away all heart-exceptions of unbelief from men.
As. 1. Can God be borne of a woman to save men, not Angels? Believe it, says
the Lords Spirit, with a sort of oath, Heb. 2.16. Verily he took on him the
seed of Abraham, not the nature of Angels. Halt not at Christ's man-kindnesse,
and not Angel-love, to the excellenter child by nature, the Angel when he
fell: and its to remove our doubts, that God is brought in promising, and
swearing the covenant; Christ is a sworn covenanter, Heb. 6.12. When God made
promise to Abraham; because he could swear by no greater, he swear by
himself. Ezech. 33. The people slandred the Lord, he delighted so to have the
people pine away in their iniquities, that he would punish them for no fault;
but the childrens teeth should be set on edge, for the sins of the father,
and the grapes that they eat not themselves. The place Eze^h 33.1^. and c. 18.
expl^^ned.
The Lord answers that calumny, Ezech. 18. And here, as I live, I delight not
so (so as you slanderously, and blasphemously say) in the death of a sinner, by
my life, I desire you may repent and live, nor have I pleasure to punish
innocent men, for no sin at all.

And the second Exception is, But Christ's heart is not engaged with a
heart-burning purpose, or desire to save man; The exception, that it was not
s^reth^^^^t love in Christ, to sav^, ^emov^d.
the purpose of saving came upon him but yesterday; yea, but (says Christ) it
was not a yesterdayes business, but was contrived from eternity, Proverb. 8.
before the Lord made Sea, or Land. verse. 30. I was by him as one brought up (as
a son nourished with him) I was daily (when there was neither night nor day)
his delights rejoicing in the habitable earth, and my deligh^s were with the
sons of men. Two words express Christ old, and eternal love to men, his
delights was with the sons of men, as Christ was his Fathers delight, from
eternity; so was Christ feasting himself on the thoughts of love, delight,
The place Pro* 8.30. I was by him as one brought up with him* etc. opened.
and free grace to men; sure not to Pharaoh, Judas, and all the race of the
wicked, and with such a love as (if free will please) should never enjoy one
son of Adam. 2. I was (says Christ) playing, and sporting, in the habitable
earth, the word (...) is to play in a dance, it is, 2 Samuel 6.21. spoken of
David's dancing before the Ark, and 1 Samuel 18.7. The women in Israel playing,
answered one another in their songs. It holds forth this, that it resolves the
question, that Augustine loosed to a curious head, asking what the Lord was
doing before the world was, he was delighting in his son Christ, and the
thoughts of the Lord Jesus, in that long and endless age, were solacing him;
and they were skipping, and passing time, in loving and longing for the
fellowship of lost men, and since God was God (O boundless duration) the Lord
Jesus, in a manner, was loving, and longing, for the dawning of the day of
Creation, and his second coming again to judgment; the marriage day of union
with sinners. Christ was (as it were) from eternity with child of infinite
love to man, and in time in the fullness of time, it blossomed forth, and the
birth came out, in a high expression of love; the man-child, the love of
Christ was borne, and saw the light, Gal. 4.4. Tit. 3.4. when Christ was ripe
of love, to bring forth free salvation; glory, glory to the Womb and the Birth.

Christ most willing to die for sinners.
And a third Exception is, But sinners dis-obliged Christ, and provoked him as
his enemies, can it be that in time, seeing how undeserving we were, he could
heartily and seriously die for man, offer himself to all? God may have mercy
on the work of his hand, but he cannot have mercy on sinners?

Answ. 1. Its true the Gospel is contrary to nature, and not one Article more
thwarteth and crosses carnal wisdom, The difficulty of believing the Gospel.
then that of imputed righteousness; That crosses Moral Philosophy so much,
as we can more easily believe the rising of the dead, or any the greatest
miracle, the drying up of the red Sea, then believe the Gospel; for we believe
the Gospel for miracles as motives, (...), Piscator. Obfirmav^t faciem suam.
not as causes of Faith, not Miracles for the Gospel, and if at the first we
believe the Gospel for Miracles; then we naturally rather believe Miracles, and
the dividing of the Red Sea, and the raising of the dead, then we can believe
that Christ came to die for sinners.

Christ had a strong good will to die for sinners.
2. Consider with what a strong good will Christ died, Luke 9.51. And it came to
pass when his time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set
his face to go to Jerusalem. He hardened his face, he emboldned himself to go
to Jerusalem to suffer, he mended his pace, and went more swiftly with a strong
fire of love to expend his blood. Luke 12.50. I have a baptism to be baptized
with (...) how am I fettered or besieged (as the word is used Luke 19.43.) till
it be perfected?

3. What could move Christ to lie and fancy? were his weeping and tears
counterfeit? were his dying, bleeding, sweating, Isai. 53.44. Surely, really,
(...).
he bare our sorrows.

4. His offer must be real, Joh. 7.37. for with vehemence he speaks (...) He
stood and shouted in the Temple, Here is a dear fountain to all thirsty souls
and most free: Christ thirsts and longs to have thirsty sinners come gratis
and drink.

But I doubt he bears not me in particular at good will, The last and special
doubt, Does Christ love me by name?
are the promises made for me? Did he love me before the world was? Did Christ
dying intend salvation for me?

This doubt draws us to the fifth particular, (that so I may hasten to the
uses) which is what sort of Faith it is that God requires of all within the
visible Church, for the want whereof Reprobates are condemned.

Assertion 1. Saving Faith required of all within the visible Church, is not as
Antinomians conceive, Antinomians dream that faith is an apprehension of the
eternal love of election.

Saltmarsh part. ^. 5^. p. 191, 192.


the apprehension of Gods everlasting love of Election to glory of all and
every one that are charged to believe. Saltmarsh in an ignorant, and confused
Treatise tells us, To believe now is the only work of the Gospel, -- that is,
that ye be persuaded of such a thing that Christ was crucified for sins, and
for your sins, -- so as salvation is not a business of our working and doing,
it was done by Christ with the Father, -- all our work is no work of salvation,
but in salvation we receive all, not doing any thing, that we may receive more;
but doing because we receive so much, and because we are saved, and yet we are
to work as much, as if we were to be saved by what we do, because we should
do as much by what is done already for us, and to our hands, as if we were to
receive it, for what we did our selves: So here is short work (says the man)
Believe and be saved -- there are yet these grounds why salvation is so soon
done. Page 193, 194
1. Because it was done before by Christ, but not believed on before, by thee
till now. 2. Because it is the Gospel-way of dispensation, to assure an^ pass
over salvation in Christ, to any that will believe it. 3. There needs no more
on our sides to work or warrant salvation to us, but to be persuaded that
Jesus Christ died for us, because Christ has suffered, and God is satisfied,
now suffering and satisfaction is that great work of salvation. And the man
taking on him to determine controversies of Arminians touching the extent of
free Grace, Page 199, ^0^, 201, 202.
whether Christ died for all, (in which questions I dare make Apology for his
innocence, that he is not guilty of wading too deep in them) he would father on
the Reformed Churches of Protestant Divines, that we make this a rational way
of justice, That God will merely and arbitrarily damn men, because he will, so
as God has put every one under a state of Redemption and power of salvation;
and they are damned not from their own will, but from Gods. The opinion by
Arminians is fathered upon that Apostolic light of the Church of Christ,
Eminent and divine Calvine, and Saltmarsh will but second them, that he may
appear a star in the Firmament, with others of some great magnitude.

But (says he) the other way is, Christ died only for his, but is offered to
all, Page 202, 203
that his who are amongst this all might believe, and though he died not for
all, yet none are excepted (that is as he says, all and every one to whom
Christ is preached, elect or reprobate, are to be persuaded that Christ died
for them in particular) and yet none are accepted but they that believe, and
none believe, but they to whom it is given: And having shown some dreams of
his own touching these controversies, he concludes with a Truth I believe
easily. Thus have I opened, though weakly the mystery: Weakly, but wilfully and
daringly.

But Faith is formally no such persuasion, as to be persuaded, Every man is
loved with an everlasting love, chosen and redeemed in Christ; for it changes
the whole Gospel in a lie, Christ obliges no man to believe an untruth: Now
all are charged to believe in the Son of God, The Gospel obliges none to
believe an untruth.
and Elect and Reprobate (as there be of both sorts within the net of the
Kingdom) are not loved with an everlasting love, nor did Christ die for them
all.

2. Its mere presumption, not Faith, that all Hypocrites, fleshly men, slaves
to their lusts, idolaters, covetous men, remaining such, never broken with any
Law-work; should immediately believe Christ is their Savior, died for them,
and the Father loved them to salvation, before the world was. True it is,
before a sinner believe, he is an unpardoned, an ungodly and guilty sinner; but
that he is unbroken, yea, or unconverted before he believe; (I speak of order
of Nature) its as unpossible, as that a thristle can bring forth figs, for then
he should believe having no new heart in him, which is the only principle of
Faith.

3. Its a more ingenuous opinion that Christ died for all and every one, though
it have no truth in it self, then to hold that he died for the Elect only, and
yet oblige men (as Antinomians do) against their conscience to believe he died
for all and every one that are engaged in the practice of believing.

4. He that believes not, makes God a liar, then that which is to be believed
must be an Evangelike truth.

5. Faith lays bands on all within the visible Church, to be knit together in
love, unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ, Col.
2.1, 2. to be persuaded that nothing can separate us from the love of God in
Christ, Romans 8.37, 38, 39. To full assurance, Heb. 10. without wavering or
declining, or bowing like a tottering wall. Now sure all and every one within
the visible Church, to whom the command of believing comes, Reprobate or Elect;
are not holden to have a full assurance that they are chosen in Christ to
salvation, and redeemed in his blood. (...)


Assertion 2. The object of saving Faith, required of all within the visible
Church is, The faithfulness of God in saving, one of the objects of saving
faith.
1. Christ's faithfulness to save believers, Heb. 10.23. Let us hold fast the
profession of our faith without wavering; and the Apostle backs it with an
Argument, that saving faith must lean upon, ( for he is faithful that has
promised) And Paul 1 Cor. 1.9. presses the same, God is faithful, by whom ye
were called, unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

2. We do not read in the Old or New Testament, that the decree, purpose, or
intention of God to save, and redeem persons in particular is the object of
that saving Faith required in the Gospel. For the second object of this Faith
is the truth and goodness of that Mother promise of the Gospel, The second
object of faith is Gods mercy in saving all that believe.
Ioh. 3.16. and 5.25. that Gospel-record 1 John 5.10, 11, 12. He that believes
has life eternal, and Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15. To seek and to save the lost, Luke 19.1^. that he came to save me in
particular is apprehended by sense, not by faith; for the Election of me by
name to glory, and the Lords intention to die for me, is neither promise, nor
precept, nor threatening; if it be a History that I must believe, its good, show
me Histories of particular men; now to be believed, except of the Antichrist,
the second coming of Jesus Christ to judge the world. Election to glory is not
held forth as a promise; If ye do this, ye shall be elected to glory,
Election of some persons to glory is a divine truth, but its neither precept,
promise, nor threatening of the Gospel.
nor is the contrary holden forth as a threatening; If ye believe not, ye shall
be reprobated, nor does the Lord command me to be chosen in Christ to
salvation, before the foundation of the world, nor does he command all men
within the visible Church to believe they are chosen to salvation, or that any
one Elect person, should believe a thing as revealed, which is not revealed;
when he is pleased to give to any Elect person the white stone, and the new
name, and to give him Faith, by which he chooses Christ for his portion, he is
then, and never till then to believe; or rather by spiritual sense to
apprehend that he is chosen to salvation from eternity, so Election is neither
precept, nor promise, but a truth of Gods gracious good will and pleasure hid
in Gods mind, till he be pleased to reveal it, by the fruits thereof.

There can be no such imaginable double dealing in the world, as Arminians lay
upon God: Arminians lay d^^ble dealing on God by the faith they enjoin to all.
For they make the Lord to say thus, as imagine a King should speak to twenty
thousand captives, I have a good will, purpose, hearty intention, and earnest
desire to make you all and every one free Princes; and pray, wish, obtest, and
beseech you subscribe such a Writ of grace for that end, but I only can lead
your hand at the Pen, and give you eyes to see, and a willing heart to consent
to your own happiness, and if you refuse to sign the Bill of grace, you shall
be tormented for ever and ever in a river of fire and brimstone: Again, I have
a like good will to my own justice, and purpose so to carry on the design as
that sixteen thousand of you shall not have the benefit of my hand, or of one
finger to lead your hand at the pen, nor any efficacious motion to act upon
your will, to obtain your consent to subscribe the Writ, yea by the contrary
though I of exceeding great free love, will, intend, decree, and purpose you
be all Princes of glory; yet I purpose that these sixt^e^ thousand whose
salvation and happiness I extremely desire shall for their former rebellion,
which I with the like desire of spirit could, and I only might have removed,
never be mo^od to consent to this Bill of grace. Now were not this the outside
of a good will, and should not this Prince be said rather to will and desire
the destruction of these sixteen thousand, and not their honor and happiness?

Asser. 3. This is the mystery of the Gospel, in which I must profess
ignorance, and that the Lords thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways
as ourwayes: he has by the preaching of the gospel engaged thousand thousands
within the visible Church, to the duty of their fidutiall adherence and heart
resting on Christ, as they would be saved; and yet has the Lord never purpos^d
to work their hearts (and he only can do it) to this heart-resting on Christ by
faith, nor has he purchased either remission of sins, or pardon for them. If
any object, God may obliege all to rest on Christ as their Savior though
salvation (...) not purchased to all.
how can Christ in equity judge and condemn them for not believing pardon and
salvation in his blood, when as neither pardon nor salvation are purchased in
this blood to them, nor purposes he to give them faith? Yet we may plead for
the Lord: we conceive of the decree of God as of a deep policy and a stratagem
and snare laid for us: whereas the Lord lies not in wait for our ruin, nor
carries he on a secret design in the gospel to destroy men: If Christ should
say in the Gospel-precepts, promises, or threatenings, I decree purpose and
intend to redeem all and every man, but I purpose to carry on the designs so,
as the far greatest part of mankind inevitably shall be lost, it should be a
stratagem; but the gospel as the gospel reveals not any decree or intention
of God, The Gospel as the Gospel reveals not Gods intention touching the
salvation and damnation of certain men from eternity; the Gospel as finally
obeyed or refused reveals such intentions.
touching the salvation or damnation of men intended from eternity: Indeed the
gospel as obeyed or dis^beyed, reveals Gods intentions and decrees, the gospel
reveals nothing but the Lords complacencie, approbation, and good-liking of
the sweet connection between faith and salvation; the just concatenation between
unbelief, disobedience, and eternal damnation: so the gospel reveals duties,
but not the persons saved, or damned; the Lords working with the gospel or the
efficacy of the gospel (which is a far other thing) reveals the persons.

Now the difficulty is, how the Lord can command the reprobate to believe life
and salvation in Christ, when there is no life and salvation either intended to
them, or purchased for them.

To which I answer, 1. God gave a law to all the angels created in the truth,
All in the visible Churuh are obliged to rest on Christ as the Savior of all
that believe, but they are not al obliged to believe that he intends
salvation to them proved by clear^ insta^ces.
If ye abide in the truth, ye shall be eternally happy: ye cannot say that the
devils in that instant were to believe that God intended and dec^eed them for
eternal happiness, and to give them ^fficacious grace, by which they should
abide in the truth, as their fellow-Angels did: Gods command and promise did
reveal no such intention of God. So the Lord said to Adam and to all his seed,
If ye keep the law perfectly, ye shall have life eternal; according to that Do
this and live: yet was not Adam then, far less these that are now under the
Law, to believe that God ordained them from eternity, to eternal life,
legally purchased; or that any flesh should be justified by the works of the
Law.

Arminians tell us that there be numbers judicially blinded and hardened within
the visible Church, who cannot believe, and whom the Lord has destined for
destruction, yet the word is preached to them, they hear and read the promises
of the gospel, and the precepts; Whither are they to believe that God intended
from eternity to them salvation and grace to believe? I think not, For they
teach that Christ neither prays for, nor intends to die for the unbeleeving
and obstinate world as such, nor decreed their salvation, and except men may
fancy senses on the words of Gods Spirit: where learned they to expound the
word World, (when it makes for them) for all and every one of mankind;
Arminians expound the word world as fitteth most for their own ends in
contrary senses.
and when it makes against them, for the least part of mankind, and that
e^ther within the visible Church only, or yet without the visible Church? for
in both, Satan's world of disobedient ones is the far greatest part, s^eing the
whole world lies in sin, as John says. Let it be also remembered when
Arminians say, the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world, that is of
all and every mortal man, they mean Christ takes not away, nor sheddeth he his
blood for the sins of the rebellious world; so the worlds rebellion, How
Christ dies for the world, and the rebellious world conditionally.
contu^^acie and infidelity against Christ must be pardoned without shedding
of blood, and if Christ did bear all the sins of the world on the cross
conditionally, and none of them absolutely: ^hen our act of believing must be
the only nearest cause of satisfaction for sins: but why then, if Christ
satisfied on the cross for the final impenitencie and unbeli^fe of the
rebellious world conditionally, so they believe and be not rebellious; but
Arminians should say right down Christ died for the rebellious and
contumatious world, and he prays for the contumacious world as such, but
conditionally; for he prays and dies for the not rebellious world of all
mortal men, not absolutely, but conditionally, so they believe in Christ; if
they believe not, neither the prayers of Christ nor his death, are more
effectual for them, then for Devils.

To all these we may add, that the Lord in commanding reprobates to rest on
Christ for salvation, though no salvation be purchased for them, deals
sincerely and heartily with them: for first he commands them to believe no
intention in God to save them by the death of his Son, How God deals sincerly
with all whom he commands to believe.
nor says he any such thing to them, but only commands them to rely on
Christ as an alsufficient Savior. Secondly, God commands all the reprobate,
even by their way, to believe that Christ in his death intended their
salvation, justification, conversion, and yet whereas God takes ways
effectual, and such as he foreseeth shall be effectual for the efficacious
working of justification and conversion, and actual glorification of some few,
yet he takes ways which he knows shall be utterly ineffectuall for the
salvation, justification, and conversion of all these reprobates, and yet
commands them to believe that he decree: and intends their salvation and
conversion with no less ardency and vehemence of serious affection then he
does intend the salvation and conversion of all that shall be glorified. Sure
this we would call double dealing in men, and the Scripture says he is a God
of truth, Deuteronomy. 32. and the Lord who cannot lie.

Object. If a rich Inne-keeper should dig a Fountain in his Field for all
passengers, thirsty and diseased, which were able to cure them, and quench
their thirst; and invite them all to come and drink and be cured, upon
condition they come and believe the virtue of the water to be such; and ye^
should intend and decree absolutely and irresistibly the tenth man invited,
should never be cured; Gospel invitations o^^en to intentions of God to us.
this Innekeeper should not deal sincerely with them. So you make God to deal
with sinners in the Gospel. He does all, in inviting s^ck sinners to come and
drin^ life and salvation at Christ the Fountain of life, which expresses with
men who speak as they think, their sincere intention, but he intends no such
thing.

Answ. Make the comparison run as it should do, and it makes more against
Arminians; say that this Inne-keeper had dominion over the heart and will, as
the Lord has, Prove. 21.1. Psalm. 119.36, 37. Hebr. 13.20, 21. Matthew. 6.13. and
that he could and does without straining of the heart, work in all the
passengers, a sense of their disease, grace actually to come and drink, and yet
he takes a dealing with the souls of some few, and causes them come to the
waters and drink, and heals them, and he uses such means and so acts upon
the will of the far most part that they shall never come, never be sensible
of their disease, and yet he invites them to come to the waters and drink; its
clear this Inne-keeper never intended the health of all and every one of the
passengers, but only of these few that come and drink; nor does invitations
with men upon condition, which the party invited is obliged to perform, but
does never perform, and which the inviter only of grace can work in the
invited, but does not work them, as being not obliged thereunto, Gods wise
framing of the Gospel invitations in not e^pressing the ^^mes of any.
speak any such intention.

Again, let it be considered, that here 1 God lies in wait for no man's
destruction. 2 God is not obliged to reveal his eternal purpose and intentions
touching men's salvation and damnation, but in the way and manner seems best to
him. 3 God never says in all the Gospel, that from eternity he has passed a
resolve to save all mankind, if they will, and to yield them the bridle on
their own necks, that they may be indifferent and absolute Lords of Heaven and
Hell. 4 Nor should the Gospel be framed in such wisdom^, if the Lord had set
down particularly the names of all the Elect and Reprobate in the world, and
have proponed salvation upon condition of obedience and faith to some few, it
should evidently have raised a hard opinion in the minds of thousands touching
Christ.

Asser. 4. The third object of Faith is the sufficiency and power of Christ to
save. The sufficiency of power in Christ to save, is the object of that faith
for the want of which Reproba^es within the visible Church are damned.
1 The Scripture makes the object of coming which is believing, Ioh. 5.40.
Ioh. 6.35. Matthew. 11.27. to be Christ's ability and power, Hebr. 7.25. to save
them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make
intercession for them. What the Scripture presses us to believe savingly, that
we must be inclined to misbeleeve, and for the misbeleeving thereof, the
reprobates are condemned, and not because they believe not the Lords intention
to save all, or his decrees of election and reprobation. But the Scripture
presses faith in the power of mercy, Romans 4.21. Abraham staggered not, but was
strong in the faith, giving glory to God, being fully persuaded that what he
had promised, he was able also to perform. Now Abraham is commended for that he
savingly and for his justification, believed the power of God in the Gospel
promise that God was able of his mercy to give him the son of promise in his
old age; otherwise to believe simply the power of God to give a child to a
mother who is passed the natural date of bearing children, is but the faith of
miracles, which of it self is not s^ving, and may be in workers of iniquity,
Matthew. 7.21, 22. so this power then is the power of saving conjoined with the
mercy and good will of Christ. 2 The Scripture holds forth to our faith the
power of God to graffe in the Jews again in Christ, Romans 11.23. to make a weak
believer stand, Romans 14.4. to keep the Saints from falling, and to present them
faultlesse before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, Jude v. 24. 3
The good Land was a type of the heavenly rest, Heb 4.1. and Heb. 3.19. some
entered not in through unbeleefe: why, what unbeleefe? the Story shows us,
Psal^ 93.7. Number. 14.9. Number. 13.28. they doubted of the power of God, and
believed the report of the unbeleeving Spies, who said, The people be strong
that dwell in the Land, the Cities are walled, and very great, and moreover we
saw the child^en of Anak there. Joshua and Caleb chap. 14.9. said they should
not be bread for them, and their strength was gone; then the question was,
whether God was able to give them that good Land. So then men enter not into
the heavenly rest because they believe not that Jesus is able to save to the
uttermost those that come through him to God, Heb. 7.23. 4 The Scripture is as
much in proving the alsufficiency, power, and perfection of Christ our Savior,
to save, as in demonstrating his tenderness of mercy and goodwill to save; as
in the Epistle to the Hebrews the Apostle labors much for to prove the
Godhead of Christ, his excellency above Angels, and that the Angels were to
adore him, his dignity and greatness above Moses and all the mortal and dying
Priests, the virtue of his blood above all the bloods of Bulls and Goats, to
purge the conscience from dead works, to expiate sin, to sanctify his
people, to open a way, a new and living way to the holy of holiest, by his
blood, that we with full assurance may draw near to God, that he with one
Sacrif^ce, never to be repeated, did that which all the thousands of
reit^rated Sacrifices were never able to do; that he is no dying Priest, but
lives for ever to intercede for us at the right hand of God. And for what is
all this, but that we should believe the a^sufficiency of Christ to save? and
because we have too low thoughts of Christ, as conceiving him to be but a
man, or less then an Angel, or a common Priest that can do no more by his
blood as touch^ng remission of sins, then dying Priests could do wi^h the
blood of beasts, and that he is dead, and now when we sin, he cannot advocate
for us at the right hand of God, that his redemption he brings in is not
eternal, yea all this says that saving faith rests upon Christ as God, as
able and completely perfect and sufficient to save, though sinners do not in
the formal act of faith believe his good will, decree, and intention to redeem
and save them by name. 5 I should think that these who have high and precious
thoughts of the grace, tend^r mercy, perfection and sufficiency of Christ to
save all that believe, and fiducially rely on Christ as a Savior sealed for
the w^rk of Redemption, though they know not Gods mind touching their own
salvation in particular, have such a faith as the Gospel speaks of, and do
savingly believe that Christ came to seek, and to s^ve that which is lost, to
save sinners, The obj^ct of fiducial resting on Christ.
that Christ is the Son of the living God, the Savior of mankind; and this no
Devil, no temporary believer, no hypocrite can attain unto.

Obj. 1. But I believe not then that I am in particular redeemed, and without
that I am a stranger to Christ; for Devils and Reprobates may believe all the
general promises of the Gospel.

Answ. 1. Its true, in that act formally you believe not you are redeemed in
particular; yet virtually and by good cons^quence you believe your own
redemption in particular, and so you are not a stranger to Christ. 2. Its true,
Devils and Reprobates may yield an assent of mind to the general promises, as
true, but its denied that they can rest on them as good, as worthy by all
means to be embraced; or that in heart and affections they can entrust the
weight and burden of their soul on these general promises, or that there is
any taste of the honey and sweetness of Christ in these promises to their
soul, as it is with the souls that fiducially rest upon Christ in these
promises.

Object. 2. Suppose I know of a ship offering to carry all to a land of life,
where people are never sick, never die, have Summer and day light, and peace
and plenty for ever, upon condition, I should believe the good will of the
Ship-master to carry me to that land; if I know nothing of his good will to me
in particular, I have no ground to believe I shall ever enjoy that good land;
so here if I know nothing of Chr^sts good will to me, how can I believe he
shall carry me to the heavenly Canaan?

Answ. Yea suppose, what is in question, that to be persuaded of the good will
of Christ the owner of the ship to carry you in particular is the condition
upon which he must carry you, but that is to be proved; there is no other
condition, but that you rest on his good will to carry all who so rest on him,
and that is all.

Object. 3. But I cannot believe.

Answ. You are to believe you cannot believe of your self, and of your own
strength; but you are not farther from Christ, tha^ you are far from your
self.

Object 4. Its comfortable that Christ the Physician came to heal the sick; but
what is that to me, who am not sick, nor of the number of these sick, that
Christ came to heal for any thing I know?

That I am sinful and not excluded by name, is a good warrant to me to believe
indefinite promises, and to rest on Christ for salvation.
Ans. Its true, its nothing to you that Christ came to heal the sick, cure the
distemper of sin is on you; you want nothing but that the Spirit working with
the Law, let you see your lost condition, and the Gospel-offer be considered,
and compared with your estate. But whether you be of the number of these sick
that Christ came to heal, is no lawful doubt and comes not from God; for what
that number is, or whether you be one of that number or no, is a secret of the
hid counsel of election to glory, a negative certainty, that for any thing ye
know you are not of the contrary number, nor are ye excluded out of that
number, is enough for you to father kindness upon Christ, though he should
say, from heaven, thou art not a Son.

The Arminian argument against particular redemption, from the hope, assuran^e
and comfort of all, proposed with all its nerves and strength.
Object. 5. I shall never have ground of assurance to believe Christ's good will,
nor either hope or comfort in the Gospel, covenant or promises, if Christ dyed
for a few elected and chosen absolutely to glory, for all must be resolved on
doubtsome, hopeless, sad and comfortless grounds by your way thus.

These for whom Christ laid down his life, and have ground of assurance of
hope, and comfort in Christ's death and in the Gospel promises, are not all men
and all sinners, but only some few handful of chosen ones, by name, such as
Abraham, David, Peter, Mary, Hannah, etc. and not one more, not any other.

But I am one of these few handful of chosen ours by name, I am, Abraham,
David, Peter, Mary, Hanna, etc. and of no other number; therefore I have ground
of assurance of hope, and comfort in Christ's death and in the Gospel-promises.

Now the Proposition is poor, comfortless, and a very hopeless field to all
within the visible Church; and the assumption to the greatest part of mankind
evidently false, because many are called but few are chosen, and so the
syllogism shall suggest a field of comfortless, and hopeless unbelief and
doubting, yea, of dispairing to the far largest part of mankind, whereas the
doctrine of the Lords good will to save all and every one of mankind, and of
redeeming all, and covenanting in Christ with all, removes all ground of
unbelief and doubting, from any; offers grounds of faith, hope, and comfort
in the Gospel, of peace to all.

Answ. 1. We shall consider what certainty and assurance of faith Arminian^
furnish to all and every on from the Gospel. Universal Rede^^^ion furnish^th
no grounds of assu^a^ce, hope and c^mfor^ to all.


2. What the Scripture speaks of the assurance, hope and comfort of al and
every one; and

3. The argument shortly shall be answered: as for the first, that Arminians
may make their syllog^sm of assurance, hope, and comfort in Christ's death as
large as Christ's death, they must ex^end the Gospel-comfort and hope to the
heathen, who never ^eard of these comforts; now how this can be, let us judge;
a very learned and eminent Divine, ^reder. (...). de Reprobat.
shows from the matter it self, and confession of Amayrald an Arminian, that
twelve Apostles could not in so short a time have gone through the whole world,
yea, they must have passed many part^cular Nations who never by an^ sound heard
of the Gospel; and Arminians yield to us that this was done arcan^ Dei
dispensatione, by the secret and unsearchable providence of God; they would
say, if they would speak truth, by the Lords absolute, highe^t, independent and
unsea^chable good pleasure in his dec^ees of absolute election and reprobation.
2. Again, they are made unexcusable and freed from all guiltiness of unbe^ief,
and hoplesnesse of comfort or ground of comfort in the Gospel promises, who
never heard of the Gospel: y^a, even these who heard the Gospel as the
Athenians, Act. 17. who ^udged Paul to be a babbler, and Festus who thought him
mad, and the Grecians who esteemed the preaching of the Gospel foolishness, 1
Cor. 1. And so must have heard the Gospel, yet ^re not condemned so much for
doub^^^ng of the ^^fficiency of Christ's death, seei^g ^hey believed Christ to
be a ^a^se Prophet, as for the^r not hearing men sent of God, Christ and the
Apostles, speaking with the power of God, and en^ued with the power of working
Miracles. The Title of Thomas Mo^^^s. (...), ^eathenish, and ^uggests c^m^o^t
a^^ hop^ of salvation in Christ's death to (...) T^rtarians, Indians, Turks and
Pagans, also never hard of Christ's death.
3. ^ut what assurance, bo^e and comfort of salvation do A^minians give? One
^homas Moore has written book inti^^led, The Universality of Gods free grace in
christ to mankind; that all might be comforted, encouraged, every one
confirmed and assured of the p^o^itation and death of Christ for the whole race
of mankind, and so for himself in particular: Hear then what Armini^s, and Mr
Moore says, Comfort ye, comfort ye my people says ^he Lord comfort and
encourage with the joy of the holy Ghost, with the lively hope f^ternall life,
with the comforts of the Scripture, Scipio, Aristotle, Cato, Regulus, Seneca,
all the Turks, Americans, Indians, Virginians, such as worship the Devils, the
Sun and Moon; such as have no hope, and are without God, and without Christ
in the world; bid them be assured Christ dyed for them, prays and intercedes
for them, intends and will their salvation upon good condition, no less then
the salvation of his chosen people.

But 1. The object of this faith, hope, and comfort, may stand and consist,
though all and every one of the race of mankind should belive it, with no
less certainty of eternal damnation then Indians, all the reprobate and
condemned Devils are under; now saving faith removes all hazard of damnation,
Joh. 3.16. Joh. 5.25. Joh. 11.26. 1 Timothy 1.15.16. Gal. 2.10. but thousands
believe, yea, the damned Devils who assent to the letter of the Gospel, and
gave testimony that Jesus is the Son of the living God, by the judgment of
the Arminians believe that Christ dyed for all and every one of the race of
mankind. Ergo, all the Reprobates may have this faith, assurance, The hope of
assurance and comfort flowing from universal redemption vain and fruitless and
false.
comfort and hope, 2. Saving faith bringing peace, justification, rejoicing in
tribulation, purifieth the heart: But I am not a whit nearer peace that I
believe that Christ intends to redeemn, save, justify all and every one of
mankind, upon condition they believe; for this remains ever a hole in the
heart; God either efficaciously intends to save all, or inefficaciously
committing the event to the good guiding of free will which once lost all
mankind; now the former neither can be known to any living; Anti- Perkins. God
intends not his ends ever according to certain knowledge say Arminians.
its a doubt to Arminians, if it be known to God himself: Arminians says,
Deum posse excide^e fine suo, quia non semper intendit finem secundum
praescientiam; God may sail and come short of his end, because he does not,
especially in events that fall out freely, and may not fall out, intend the end
according to foreknowledge; See then here the Arminian courage, hope and
comfort; God intends to redeem and save me in Christ; but ah it is as the
blind man casts his club, or shoots his arrow, he winks and draws the
string, it may come up to the white, but it runs a hazard to fall short and
wide; Arminians fancy* God to hang pendulous, uncertain between two ^nds.
Again, its false that God intends efficaciously to save all; therefore
Bellarmine and Arminius say, the Lord does here as Politicians, who have two
strings in their bow; for God (say they) lies at the wait between two ends,
and intends either the obedience, conversion and salvation of all, or if he
miss, he has another string in his bow, and intends the declaration of the
glory of his justice; if free will shall thwart and cross the former intention
of God, and this is the latter intention, all and every man is to believe that
God intends his conversion and salvation ineffectually: but ah this is cold
comfort and dubious, hazard-some and far off hope; the poor man is here
between hope to be saved, Arminians hope and comfort is that all mankind must
hang between hope and despair.
(if the fortune or loose contingency of free will be lucky) and fear to be
eternally thrice more miserable then if God had never born him any good will
(if free will miscarry as it does in the far greatest part of mankind) for
Arminians do not say, one man is more saved by their pendulous and venturous
good wishes and doubtsome intentions to save all and every one, then we do by
the Lords most wise, s^aid, poysed, fixed, and absolute decrees; so it is but a
toome and an empty spoon, they thrust in the mouths of the whole race of
mankind, when they will them thus to hope for salvation.

2. By this means God intending two ends, either the salvation or damnation of
all and every one, he puts all mankind upon large as great fear and despair,
as upon comfort and hope, and he intends and wills the destruction of all
mankind more efficaciously and with far greater success, then he wills
their salvation; only here is a comfort men may take to Hell with them, and an
East-winde hope they may feed on; God primarily, antec^dently, and first wills
my salvation, but secundarily and with better certainty of the black event, he
wills in justice, my damnation and the eternal destruction of the far
greatest part of mankind; and this is the Arminian comfort, and white hopes
that the Tenent of Arminian universal grace, liberally bestows on all, much
good do it them.

3. They stand not to make God to fluctuate between two ends; either this or
this, justice or mercy; Arm^nians fancy God to be expelled from his far best
and, and compelled against his will to a worse end, in the far largest part
of mankind.
mercy is the port God desires to sail to, and to carry all to heaven; but
because he cannot be master of tide and wind, and free will blows out of the
East, when God expects a fair West wind, the Lord is compelled to arrive
with a second wind as a crossed Seaman must do^, and to land his Vessel in
the sad port of revenging justice, and make such a Sea-voyage, as against the
heart of God (what will ye say of the destiny of free-wils ill luck?) must cast
the far greatest part of mankind, as ship broken men into eternal damnation,
and except God would have strangled free will and destroyed the nature of that
obedience which is obnoxious to threatenings and rewards, he could not for his
soul mend the matter; and here good Reader, you have the Arminian hope and
consolations, if you list to harken to the Arminians of England now risen to
comfort all mankind in these sad times. Faith cannot rest on a common general
good.
3. Saving faith lays hold on salvation, righteousness and everlasting
redemption as proper heritage, faith being a supernatural instinct, that
lays a peculiar claim to Christ, as the natural instinct in the lamb
claims the mother; its property that faith pe^sueth; let e^perience speak, if
there be not a peculiar warmness of heart in a believer at the sight of
Christ; now to believe a common salvation hanging in the air, the heaven of
Turks and Armenians, and the righteousness and redemption of Indians, of
Seneca, and Catiline, Clodius, and Camillus, I confess must be far from such
a property.

4 Saving faith is the first dawning, the morning sky and the first day light
of the appearance of election to glory. Act. 13.48. Saving Faith the f^rst
dawning of election to glory.
The man never has a fair venture of heaven, nor comes in handy-gripes with
eternal love revealed till he believe, because the poor man's believing is his
act of choosing God for his portion, and so cannot be an assent to a common
good, general to all men, Heathens, Pagans, Jews, Turks* and believers; faith
makes him say, I have now found a ransom, I have found a pearl of great price,
I make no other choice, my lot is well fallen upon Christ; whether Christ cast
his love or his lot on me from e^erni^y, I cannot dispute; but sure, The
Arminian hope and comfort not in Scripture.
I have chosen him in time. Now for the second, The Scripture shows us of an
ho^e of ^ighteous^esse by faith, this we wait for through the spirit Gal. 5.5.
and of the hope laid up for the Saints in heav^n, ^ol. 1.15. and Christ in the
Saints the hope of glory, v. 27. and of the hope of the appearing of our life
Christ, Ti^. 2.13. Which hope makes a man ^o purg^ himself and to be holy, 1
Ioh. 3.3. and of a rejoicing in hope in the glory of God, Romans 5.2 Romans 12.12.
the hope to come, for the which the Twelve Tribes of Israel serve God
instantly, Act. ^6.7. and that lively hope unto which we are regenerated by the
resurrection of Jesus christ from the dead, 1 Pet. 1, 5. and the hope that we
have through patience and comfort of the Scripture, Romans 15.4. and the hope
which is not confined within the narrow sphere and Region of time and this
corruptible life, 1 Cor. 15.19. the hope which experience brings forth, Heb.
5.4. Now whether we take hope for the object of hope, the thing hoped for, or
the supernatural or gracious faculty of hoping, in neither respects have
Seneca, Scipio, Regulus, Jews, Turks, Americans, and such as never by any
rumor heard of Christ any hope from Scripture; Paul says of them, and of the
Ephesians in their condition, Ephesians. 2.12. At that time ye were without Christ,
being Aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world; and for the grace of
hope the Scripture says, its an Anchor cast in heaven by these who upon life
and death make Jesus t^eir City of refuge, Heb. 6.19.20. it is a fruit of the
Spirit, Gal. 5.5. where ever it is, it makes a man purify himself, 1 Ioh.
3.2. its a lively hope and a fruit of predestination and of the sprinkling of
the blood of Jesus, 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. Now such a hope as Arminians allow to
Heathen and Indians, to Reprobates, who believe that Christ dyed for all and
every one, and such as perish eternally, we gladly leave to themselves; and if
our doctrine of particular redemption furnish ground of despair as opposite to
thi^ hope, we profess it: But let Arminians answer this of their own way; So
God must speak to the most part of the Christian world. Be of good courage,
hope for salvation in Christ, be comforted in this that Christ dyed for you all
without exception, and be fully assured and believe there is a perfect ransom
given for you, and salvation and righteousness purchased to you in Christ's
blood; but I have decreed so to act upon the wills of the far greatest part of
you, that you shall have no mo^e shaire in that redemption and purchased
salvation then the damned Devils, whereas if I had so drawn you as I have done
others, as sinful by nature as you are, you should certainly have been
eternally saved in Christ's blood; and the like, and fa^re more I could say, of
the dream of the middle science and knowledge of God; for Arminians spoil the
Almighty of all grace, compassion, mercy, or power to save; for this is the
Gospel and no other, that God must utter by their doctrine: The Arminian
Divinit^, their faith and hope, etc.
I have chosen out of grace and mercy all to salvation, who shall believe, and
have given my Son, to give his life and blood a ransom for all and every one;
and I will desire and wish, that all m^nkinde were with me in eternal glory,
and that my revenging justice had never been experimentally known to Men or
Angel, and that death, hell, sin, had never had being in the world; but the
far greatest part of mankind were to sin, and finally and obstinately to
resist, both my general universal grace given to all, and my special and
Evangelick calling, and that they were to do before any act of my knowledge,
free decree, strong grace, or tender mercy; and I cannot bow their wills
indeclinably to final obedience, nor could I so powerfully by moral swasion,
draw them to constant faith and perseverance, except I would act against that
which is decent and convenient for a Lawgiver to do, and destroy the nature
of that free obedience that lies under the sweet droppings of free reward,
which must be earned by sweating, and under the lash and hazard of eternal
punishments to be inflicted, (which I will not do) yea, though in all things
even done by free agents, as translations of Kingdoms from one Prince to
another, and bringing enemies against a land, which are done by free agents, I
do what ever I will, and my decree stands and cannot be recalled Dan. 4.35.
Esa. 14.24, 25, 26, 27. chap. 46.10.11. Psalm. 115.3. Psalm. 135.6. Yet in matters
of salvation or damnation, or of turning the hearts and free actions of men and
Angels that most highly concern my glory above all; I cannot but bring all the
arrows of my Decrees, to the bow of that slippery contingent ind^fferency of
the up and down free will of Men and Angels; and here am fast fettered, that I
can but dance as free will pipeth and say amen to created will in all things
good or bad. I cannot cut of the abundance of my rich grace and free mercy
(though earnestly and vehemently I desire it) save one person more then are
saved, or damn one more then are damned, or write one man more in the book of
life, and bestow on them the fruits of my dear Sons death, then such as in
order of nature, were finally to believe before any act of my middle science,
or my conditional free Decree, or drawing grace; therefore am I compelled as a
Merchant who against his will casts his goods in the Sea, to save his own life,
because the winds and storms ^ver-master his desire, to take a second course,
contrary to my natural desire, and g^acious and mild inclination to m^rcy, to
decree and ordain that all who before the acts also of my middle science, free
decree, and just will were finally to resist my calling shall eternally perish,
and to will that Pharaoh should not at the first or second command obey my
will, and let my people go: and therefore with a consequent or constrained
will to suffer sin to be, Collat. Piscat. and Vo^s^i^s non tam su^i^o
sor^asse Deus vo^^it Pharao^em populum dimittere.
to appoint death and hell, and the eternal destruction of the greatest part
of mankind, to be in the world, for the declaration of my revenging justice,
because I could not hinder the entrance of sin into the world, not Master free
will as free, if my dispensation of the first covenant made with Adam in
Paradise should stand: Whereupon I was compelled to take a second herbrie, and
a second wind, like a Seaman, who is with a stronger cross wind, driven
from his first wished port; and to send my Son Jesus Christ into the world,
to die for sinners, for that I could not better do, and out of love to save
all, offer him to all, one way or other, though I did foresee my desire and
natural kindness to save all, should be far more thwarted and crossed by this
way; because force my consequent will must needs prepare a far hotter furnance
in hell, for the greatest part of mankind, since thousands of them, must
reject Christ, in resisting the light of nature, and the universal sufficient
grace, given to all; which if free will should use well, would have procured to
them more grace, and the benefit of the preached Gospel. But a heavier plague
of hardness of heart, and far greater torments of fire, then these, I foresee
must be the doom of such, within the visible Church as resist my calling, or
having once obeyed, may according to the liberty of independent free will
persevere if they will; and notwithstanding of the power of God, by which they
are kept to salvation, the promises of the eternal covenant, the efficacy of
Christ's perpetual intercession, of the in-dwelling of the holy Ghost, that
everlasting fountain of life, etc. may fully and finally fall away, and turn
Apostats; and therefore all their hope of eternal life, their assurance of
glory, their joy, their consolation and comforts in any claim to life eternal,
and the state of adoption is not bottomed on my power to keep them, my eternal
covenant, my Sons intercession. I can do no more then I can, but upon their own
free will, if they please (and its too pleasant to many) they may all fall
away, and perish eternally, and leave my Son a widow, without a wife, a head
without members, a king without subjects.

And if Arminians will be so liberal or lavish of the comforts of God proper
to the lords people, Esa. 40.1. c. 49.13. the proper work of the holy Ghost the
comforter. Ioh. 14.16. c. 15.26. c. 16.7. the consolations of Christ, Phil.

Cor. 1.4.6.7 coming from the God of all comfort, the Lord that comfort Zion,
Esai. 51.3. 2. Cor. 1.3. Esai. 51.12. bl^ssing promised to the mourners, Matthew.
5.4. We desire Mr. Moore, The comforts of Armi^ia^s not in Sc^ip^ure.
and other Arminians to enjoy them; but for us, we a lo^^v neither assurance,
courage hope, nor comforts in Christ or h^s death, but on the regenerate and
believers; and this makes the doctrine of universal redemption more suspicious
to us as not coming from God, that they allow to all, (even dogs and swine) the
holy Ghost and the precious privilege of the Saints. Therefore thirdly, we
answer, that the assumption is not ours, but theirs, let the assump^^on be; But
I believe, and he proposition be corrected thus. These for whom Christ laid
down his life, are some few cho^en believers. B^t I am chosen and a beleeve^:
Ergo etc. and we grant all, so the assumption be made sure. The general good
will of God to save all comfortless.


But I have no assurance, hope, nor comfort to rest on a general good will
that God bears to all, to Judas, Pharaoh, Cain, and to all mankind, no less
then to me. For I am of the same very metal, and by nature am heir of wrath,
as well as they.

2. That far-off Good will, that all be saved, and that all obey: the Lord from
eternity did bear it to the fallen devils, as well as to me. O cold comfort!
and it works nothing in order to my actu^ll salvation, more then to the a^^u^ll
salvation of Judas the Traitor: it (...) on moving no wheels, no c^uses, no
effectual means to p^ocure the powerful ap^lica^ion o^ the purchased
Redemption to m^, more then to all t^a^ are now spitting out blasphemy against
eternal just^ce, and are in fi^^e chains of wrath, cursing this Lord, and his
general good will to save them.

The fountain Good will of God separated electe^ persons from others.
But the fountain good will of God, to save the elect, runs in another
channel of free grace, that separates person from person, Jacob from Esau, and
sets the heart of God from eternity, and the tender bowels of Christ, both
from eve^lasti^g: and as touching the execution of this good will, and in time,
upon this man, not this man, without hire mon^y or price. 1. because Angels or
Men, can never answer that of Romans 9.13.14.15. as it is written, I have loved
Jacob, and have hated Esau, and that before the one, or the other had done good
or evil. Then the natural Arminian objecteth, what our Arminian does this day,
that must be unrighteousness to hate men absolutely, and cast them off when
they are not born, and have neither done good nor evil. Paul answers, it
follows in no sort that there is unrighteousness with God, because verse 15.
all is resolved on the will of God, because it is his will; for he says to
Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
on whom I will have compassi^n: (...)
and upon this h^e infe^ies then the business of sep^^ating Iaakob from Esau,
^unnes not upon such wheels as ^unning and willing, sw^ating and hunting by
good endeavors; Iaakob d^d here less, and E^au more; but all goes on this, on
Gods free goodness and mercy; all the difference between person and person,
is, God has mercy, because he will, not because men will. Now because Arminians
say, th^s is not mean^ of election and reprobation, but of temporary savours
bestowed on Iaakob, nor on Esau, he a^eadgeth the example of Pharaoh a cruel
Athe^st and a Tyrant, who never sought justification by the works of the Law;
the reason why Pharaoh obtained not the mercy that others obtained: I, says
the Lord, verse 17. told Pharaoh to his face, for this purpose I raised thee
up, that I might make an example of the glory of my power, and name, that is,
the glory of justice in thee, to all the world who hears of thee: and then
verse 18. he returns to the Lords free will, and unhired and absolute
liberty, in differencing person from person. Why has h^e mercy upon this man,
and not on this man, if there had been such a conceit as a general catholic
good will in God, to Pharaoh, to Esau, the Apostle should now h^ve denied any
absolute will in God, to separate one person from another. Arminians can
instruct the spirit of the Lord, and the Apostle to say, he has an equal
general goodwill and desire to save all and every one; Esau as well as Iaakob;
Ishmael as ^saac, the son of promise, Pharaoh as Moses, or any other man; but
then two great doubts should remain: How then hated he Esau, when he was not
yet born, and had not done good or evil? All the Arminians on earth, answer
that. 2. But the doubt is not removed: How is it, that God loves Iaacob,
blesses, and has mercy on him, and hates Esau, and yet Esau has neither done
good nor ill? Arminians answer, in an antecedent general good will, God indeed
loved Esau, as well as Jaakob, Pharaoh as well as another man: Arminians
resolve all one man's will.
but here is the thing that makes the separation, Jacob runs, and wills,
Esau is a wicked man; Pharaoh and others like him, bloody tyrants; and God
shows mercy with another posterior, and consequent will on Jacobs, because he
runs, and wills, and has mercy on him, because he pays well for mercy; and has
not mercy on Esau, because he neither ^uns, nor wills. Now this is to
contradict God; therefore we must bear with it, that men of corrupt minds,
destitute of the truth, rising up to plead for universal atonement, contradict
us. But Paul resolves all the mercy bestowed on this man, not on this man, v.
18. on this saying (...), he will, Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have
mercy, and hardens whom he will. (2) unpossible it is that conversion should
be grace and matter of the praise of the glory of the Lords grace, (...).
to Peter rather then to Judas, except the grace of God separate Peter from
Judas, by moving effectually the one to believe, and not moving the other. All
the wit of men cannot say, but I may glory in my own free will, that I am
efficaciously redeemed and saved, rather then another; except grace
efficaciously move me in a way of separating me from another, if he had alike
good will to save me, We cannot choose but glory in our selves and not in the
Lord, ^f free gr^c^ sep^rate not the believ^ng man from the not believing.
and Judas and all the world; but he committed the casting of the balance in
differencing the one from the other, to free will, so as the creatures
free will made the cons^quent will of God different toward the one, and toward
the other.

3. The God who is willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, in
^nduring with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction,
that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which
he had before prepared to glory, Romans 9.2^, 23, is also willing because he is
willing to declare these two ends equally; in some because he will; the glory
of power justice and long suffering; in others the glory of grace and mercy,
because he will; nor did I ever see a reason wherefore God should carry on the
two great state designs of justice and mercy, God equ^lly intended his two
great ends in men and Angels.
in such an order as he should incline more to declare and bring to pass the
design of mercy then the design of justice; for out of the freedom of high and
deep sovereignty he most freely intended both these glorious ends. Now as the
attaining of his freely intended end of manifested mercy in some, both Angels
and Men, makes visible in an eminent manner the glory of justice in other some,
so the attaining of his freely intended end of pure grace in the Elect, does
highly indeare Jesus Christ that we should prize the blood of the Covenant, the
riches of free grace to us whom he has freely chosen, leaving others as good
as we to perish everlastingly. And as Arminians cannot deny, but that the Lord
might so have contrived the business, as all that are saved, and to praise the
Lord that sits one the Thron in heaven, might have been damned and should
blaspheme eternally in hell the holy just Judge of the world: as he can make a
revolution of all things in heaven and in earth, to a providence contrary to
that which is now; so they cannot deny an eminent sovereignty, deliberate and
fix^d free will in God before any of the Elect and Reprobate were placed in
such a condition of providence in which he foresaw all that are saved or
damned, should be saved or damned, and that this will was the prime fountain
cause of election and reprobation.

4. Paul showing, Romans 11. That God concludes all in unbelief that he might
have mercy on all, and showing a reason why the Lord was pleased to cast off
his ancient people for a time, and to engraffe the Gentiles, the wild Olive,
in their place, says O the depth; and another reason he cannot find, but
bottomless and unsearchable freedom of grace and free dispensation to some
people and persons, and not to others. The ground of Paul's crying out, O the
depth, etc.
I confess it had been no such depth, if the Lord from eternity had equally
loved all to salvation, but through the running and willing, or not running and
not willing of the creature had been put upon later, wiser and riper thoughts
and a consequent will to save or not save, as Men and Angels in the high and
indifferent court of their free will shall think good; there had been no other
depth then is in earthly Iudge^, who reward well doers, and punish ill doers,
or in a Lord of a V^ne-yard, who gives wages to him that labors, and no wages
to him that stands idle and does nothing; this is the Law of nature, of
Nations, and no depth, its but God rewarding men according to their works, and
God showing mercy in such as cooperate with, and improve well the benefit of
Gods antecedent will, and not showing mercy on such as do not cooperate
therewith, but out of the absoluteness of indifferent free will are wanting
thereunto. But the great and unsearchable depth, is, how God should so carry on
the great designs of the declaration of the glory of pardoning mercy and
punishing justice, as their should be some persons and Nations, the Jews first
and not the Gentiles, as of old, and now the Gentiles taken into Christ, and
the Jews cast off; and again, the Jews with the riches of the world of Elect
both Jews and Gentiles who are chosen and must obey the Gospel, and be called
without any respect to works, but of grace, Romans 11.5.6 7. and when the
children had neither done good nor evil and were not born, Romans 9.11. and
these who were nearest to Christ, and did wo^k more for the attaining
righteousness and life, then other strangers to Christ and Gentiles, Romans
9.30, 31, 32, 33. Romans 10.1.2, 3, 4. Romans 11.1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc.
rejected, and there should be others as good as these by nature, that the Lord
should have mercy on; now in both these; first, God is free in his grace;
secondly, just in his judgments, though he neither call, nor choose acco^ding
to works; thirdly, the damned creature most guilty; and fourthly, the Lord both
j^stly s^vere, and graciously me^cifull; fifthly, none have cause to complain
or quarrel with God; and yet God might have carried the matter a far other
way; sixthly, the head cause of this various administration, with Nations and
persons, is the deep, high, sovereign, innocent, holy, independent will of the
great Potter and Former of all things who has mercy on whom he will, and
hardneth whom he will, and this is the depth without a bottom; no creature Angel
or Men can so behave them selves to their fellow creatures, and yet be free,
just, holy, wise, etc. but sure one creature can deal with his fellow creature
according to the rules and road-way of an antecedent and consequent will; so
may the King deal with his people, the Governor with those he governes, the
Father with his children, the Commander with his soldiers, the Lord of a
Vineyard with his hired servants, all these may order their goodness, mercy,
rewards, punishments in a way levill with the use, industry improvement of
free will, or the rebe^lion, unjustice, wickedness and slothfulness of their
underlings; but no Master nor Lord can call Laborers to his Vineyard, and
exhort, ob^est, beseech them all to labor and promise them hire, and yet keep
from the greatest part of them the power of ^^^rring arms or legs, of free
consenting to labor, and suspend his so acting on the greatest part of them,
as they shall willingly be ca^^ied on to wilful disobedience, and to be the
passive objects of his revenging justice according to the determinate counsel
of the Lord of this Vineyard, because so he willed out of his absolute
sovereignty to deal with some, and deal a just contrary way with the least
part of the laborers, because he p^^posed to declare the glory of his grace
on them; either there is here an unsearchable depth, or Paul knew nothing, and
this calmes my mind and answers all that reason can say for universal
atonement: and the

1. Use. I aim at, is, that no Doctrine so endeareth Christ to a soul, as this
of particular redemption and free grace separating one from another, Psalm.
147.1^. Praise the Lord, Its grace and free grace ^nly that makes o^^
diff^r^r^m another.
O Jerusalem; and amongst man^ ground^ here is one, verse. 19. he shows his
word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his judgments to Israel, ver. 20. he has
not dealt so with any Nation; and he speaks not of the measure, as if God had
revealed the same grace in nature, but in an inferior degree to other Nations;
for he says, as for his judgments they have not known them; and th^n being
full of God, for this separating mercy, he adde^h, praise ye the Lord; Christ
esteems this the flower of grace, the grace, of grace and blesses his Father
for it; Matthew. 11.25. I bless thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, because
thou have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to
babes; now because Arminians say, the pride of the self-wise, and the humility
of babes, are the causes separating the one from the other, and so free will is
to share with the Father in the praise of the reveiled glory of the Gospel, and
the discovered excellency of Christ to babes, rather then to wise men; a
literal revelation no doubt was common to all babes and prudent, the swelled
Pharisees, and humbled sinners; Christ prai^eth the eminency, the blossom of
grace, the bloom of free-love in that the free will of the humble and the proud
made not the separation, (...).
but the good pleasure of God, ver. 27. No man knows the Son but the Father,
and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me, and
given himself for me; (...), Ephesians. 2.1. (...) and you who were dead in sins
and trespasses, has he quickened, ver. 4. for his great love wherewith he loved
us (...), v. 5. even when we were dead in sins and trespasses he has quickened
us, (...) together with Christ, ver. 13. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who
sometimes were far off, are made near by the blood of Christ; the passing by
my Father and mother, and brother and sister, neighbor and friend; and taking
me, is a most indearing favor.

3. Of all in Scotland and England, all in Europe, all Adams seed, that ever
were masters of a living soul in the womb or out of it; How inde^ring is
separating grace.
the Lord passed by so many thousands and millions, and the lot of free grace
fell upon me precisely by name, and upon us, and not upon thousands, besides no
less eligible then I was; what thoughts will you have of the f^^e lot of love
that fell upon you ever since God was God, when Christ shall lay such a load of
love, such a high weight and mass of love on you; ye shall then think, O how
came I hither to sit in heavenly places with Christ! that body that is trimmed,
clothed, and doubly embroydered with pure and unmixed glory, is just made of
the same lump of earth, with the body of Judas or Cain, that are now flaming
and sinking to the bottom of the black and sad river of brimstone; the Lord
says, Ezekiel. 18.4. behold all souls are mine; and when your soul shall be
laden with glory and thousands of souls blowing and spitting out blasphemies
on the Majesty of God, out of the sense of the torment of the gnawing worm that
never dies; and ye consider the soul of Judas might have been in my souls
stead, and my soul in the same place of torment that his is now in, what
wonder then John cry out, behold what love!

4. How much love for extention, and intention: for one man, and every one in
covenant, What a^oundance o^ grace b^st^wed on single persons and yet nothing
of it can be wanting.
Psalm, 106.45. multitudes of mercies, and Ps. 130.7. plentious redemption; one
David must have multitude of tender mercies Psalm. 51.1. Psalm. 69.13.16. Its not
one love, but loves, many loves, Ezech. 16.8. Cant. 1.2. He gives many
salvations to one, as if one heaven, and one crown of glory, were not enough;
Ephesians. 2.4. he is rich in mercy: and he quickened us when we were dead in sins
(...) For his multiplied love: every man has a particular act of love, a
particular act of atonement bestowed on him: can ye multiply figures with a
pen, and write from the east to the west, and then begin again, and make the
heaven of heavens, all circular lines, of figures; it should weary the arm of
Angels to write the multiplied loves of Christ. Christ's love desires to engage
many; how many millions be there of elect Angels and men? every one of them,
for his own part, must have a heaven of love; and Christ thinks it little
enough that the first-bornes love, be on them all, and that they all be
firstborn: Col. 1.20. It pleased the Father by Christ to reconcile all things
in heaven, and in earth, to himself: All the Angels are Christ's vassals, and he
is their head; Col. 2.10. then Christ must have two eyes; you seven eyes, to
see for every one, and two legs for every Angel to walk withal; Christ must
have a huge host, and numerous troops in his family. (2) Who then can number
the sums of all the debts of free grace, that Angels and me now Christ, and
when they shall be paid? though sins shall be acquitted, yet debts of
undeserved love shall stand for ever and ever. O how unsearchable is the riches
of Christ's grace! Know y^, O Angels, O gloryfied Spirits, where is the Brim, or
where is the bottom of free grace? Yet not one sinner can have less grace then
he has, he has need of all, he has no oil to spare, to lend to his neighbour^
Matthew. 25. Our deep diseases, and festered wounds could have no less to cure
them, then infinite love, and free grace, passing all knowledge. It was a broad
wound, that required a plaster as long and broad, as infinite jesus Christ.

Paul bows his knee to the Master of the families of heaven and earth, for this
act of grace, to weigh the love of Christ* Ephesians. 3.18. I pray (says he) that
ye may comprehend, (...).
or overtake the love of God.

2. How many are set on work to compass that love? as if one man could not be
able to do it: Yet I pray, that ye with all the Saints may comprehend what is
the breadth; its broader then the Sea, (...).
or the earth: and what is the length of it? its longer then between East and
West; though ye could measure between the extremity of the higest ci^cle of the
heaven of heavens, and then it has depth and height more then from the center
of the earth to the circle of the Moon and up through all the orbs of the
s^ven Planets, and to the orb of S^atrre^, and highest heavens: who can
comprehend either the diameter or circum^^rence of so great a love? Love is an
Element that all the Elect, Men and Angels, swim in; the the banks of the river
swell above the circle of the Sun, to the highest of the highest heavens.

Christ's love in the Gospel takes all alive, as a mighty Conqueror; How active
love is.
his seed for multitude is like the drops of dew that come out of the womb of
the morning, Psalm. 110. and they are the dew of the youth of Christ; for Christ
as a strong and vigorous young man full of strength, who never fails through
old age, brings in the forces of the Gentiles like the flocks of Kedar, Esai.
^0.5, 6.

5 Christ's love outworks Hell and Devils. Can ye seal up the Sun that it
cannot rise? or can ye hinder the flowing of the Sea? or lay a Law upon the
Winds that they blow not? far less can ye hinder Christ's wilderness to
blossom as a Rose, or his grace to blow, to flow over banks, o^ ^o flee with
Eagles wings. No lip-love, nor any ^m^ty love in God, but that which is
effectual and r^all to work the good he d^si^eth to the party loved.
O how strong an agent i^ Christ's love, that bears the sins of the world!
^oh. 1.29. It works as fire does by nature, rather then by will, and none can
bind up Christ's heart or restrain his bowels, but he must work all to heaven
that he has loved.

Use 2. We are hence taught to acknowledge no love to be in God, which is not
effectual in doing good to the crea^ure; there is no lip-love, no raw
wel-wishing to the creature which God does not make good: we know but three
sorts of love, that God has to the creature, all the three are like the
fruitful womb; there is no miscarrying, no barrenness in the womb of divine
love; he loves all that he has made; so far as to give them a being, to
conserve them in being as long as he pleases: he had a desire to have Sun,
Moon, Stars, Earth, Heaven, Sea, Clouds, Air; he created them out of the
womb of love and out of goodness, and keeps them in being; he can hate
nothing that he made, now according to Arminians, he wish^d a being to many
things in then seed and causes, as he wished the earth to be more fruitful
before the fall then now it is, so that against Gods will, A threefold love in
God effectual.
and his good will to the creatures, he comes short of that natural antecedent
love, that he bears to creatures; he could have wished death never to be, no^
sickness, nor old age, (say Arminians) nor barrenness of the earth, nor
corruption. Nay, but though these have causes by rule of justice, in the sins
of men, yet we have no cause to say God falls short of his love, and wished and
desired such and such a good to the creature; but things mscarried in his hand;
his love was like a mother that conceives with many children, but they die in
the womb; so God willed and loved the being of many things; but they could not
be, the love of God was like the miscarrying womb that parts with the dead
child, we cannot acknowledge any such love in God.

2. There is a second love and mercy in God, by which he loves all Men and
Angels; yea, even his enemies, makes the Sun to shine on the unjust man, as
well as the just, and cau^eth dew and rain to fall on the orchard and fields
of the bloody and deceitful man, whom the Lord abhors; as Christ teaches us,
Matthew. 5.43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. nor does God miscarry in this love, he desires
the eternal being of damned Angels and Men; he sends the Gospel to many
Reprobates, and invites them to repentance and with longanimity and
forebearance, suffers pieces of froward dust to fill the measure of their
iniquity, yet does not the Lords general love fall short of what he wills to
them.

3. There is a love of special election to glory; far less can God come short
in the end of this love: Christ's love of election cannot miscarry.
For 1. the work of redemption prospers in the hands of Christ, even to the
satisfaction of his soul; saving of sinne^s, (all glory to the Lamb) is a
thriving work and successful in Christ's hands, Esa. 53.10, 11. He shall see
of the travel ^f his soul and be satisfied. 2. Christ cannot shoot at the
rovers and miss his mark: I should desire no more, but to be once in Christ's
chariot paved with love, Cant. 3. Were I once assured I am within the circle
and compass of that love of Election; I should not be affrayd that the chariot
can be broken or ^urned off its Wheels; Christ's char^ot can go through the red
Sea, though not dried up: he shoots arrows of love and cannot miss, he r^d^s
through hell and the grave, and makes the dead his living captives and
prisoners. 3. This love is natively of it self active; Ezechiah says in his
s^ng, Esai. 38.17. Behold for peace I had bitterness, (...)
but thou have in love to my soul (delivered) me from the pit of corruption,
but in hebrew it is, thou have loved my ^oule out off the pit of corruption,
because thou have cast all my sins behind thy back: he speaks of Gods love,
as if it were a living man with flesh and bones, arms, Christ's love active.
hands, and feet, went down to the pit, and lifted up Ezechiahs soul out of the
pit; so has the love of Christ loved us out of hell, or loved hell away to
hell, and loved death down to the grave, and loved sin away, and loved us out
of the arms of the Devil; Christ's love is a persuing and a conq^ering thing;
I shall never believe that this love of redemption stands so many hundredth
miles aloof on the shore; and the bank of the river, and lake of fire and
brimstone, and ^^yes afar off and wishes all mankind may come to land and
shoa^, and cas^eth to them, being so many hundredth miles from them, word^ of
milk, wine and honey, out of the Gospel, and cries that Christ loves all and
every one to salvation; and if wishes could make men happy, Christ earnestly
w^shes and desires, if all men were alike well minded to their own salvation,
that all and every one might be saved, that there were not a Hell; but he will
not put the top of his little finger in their ^ear^ to ^ow and incline their
will, and Christ cries to the whole world perishing in sin, I have shed my
blood for you all, and wish you much happiness; but if ye will not come to me
to believe: I purpose not to pass over the line of Arminian decency or
Jesuitical congruity, nor can I come to you to draw your hearts, by way of
efficacious determination, if ye will do for your selves and your own
salvation, the greatest part of the work, which is to apply redemption, by your
own free will (though I know you cannot be masters of your selves, of one good
thought, and are dead in sins as I have done the other lesser part, purchased
salvation for you, or made you all reconciliable and savabl^, its well;
o^herwise I love the salvations of you and every one; but I will not procure
it, but leave that to your free will; chose fire or water, heaven or hell as
the counsels of your own heart shall lead you; and I have done with you; Oh
such a love as this could never save me! If the young heir had wisdom, he
should pray that the wise Tutor lay not the falling or the standing of the
house on his green head and raw glassie and weathercock free will; we shall
cast down our crowns at the feet of him that sits on the Throne, because he
has redeemed us out of all nations, tongues and languages and l^ft these
nations to pe^ish in their own wicked way: sure in heaven I shall have no
Arminian ^houghts as now I have, through corruption of nature. I shall not then
divide the song of free Redemption between the Lamb and free will: and give the
larg^st share to free will; my soul enter not into their counsels or secrets,
who thus black Christ, an^ shame that fair spotless and excellent grace of
God.

Use 3. Here is excellent ground of encouragements to the Elect to the believe;
for the fear of reprobation from eternity is no ground that thou should not
believe.

Object. 1. I fear that I am a reprobate.

Answ. If thou will know the need that a Reprobate man has of that saving
Savior Jesus Christ, thou would upon any terms, cast thy soul upon Christ;
which if thou do, now thou have answered the question and removed the fear
that thou art a reprobate; for a reprobate cannot believe.

Object. 2. But sin and unworthiness inclines more to reprobation, then to
be loved eternally of God. Sin proves not rep^obation.


Answ. Not a whit, except the Lord had revealed reprobation to thee; sinful
clay, nothing but the great Potter may wash the clay, and frame thee a vessel
of honor. Sin continued is no argument why I should not bel^eve.


Objct. 3. But sin continued in, such as my sin is, is the first morning
dawning of reprobation, as faith and sorrow for sin is the first opening of
election to glory.

Answ. Sin finally and obstinately continued in is a sign of repro^ation; but
say you had obstinately gone on in sin (as I love not to cu^e spiritual
wounds by smoothing and lessening them) yet your duty lies on you in a sense of
your need of Christ, to come to Christ; the event is Christ's, you may say; Its
fitting, Lord, I be a r^prob^te, but many thousands of bad deserving as I am,
are singing the praises of free grace before the Throne.

Objct. 4. But if my sin evidence to me reprobation, its a cold comfort to
go to Christ and believe; for sure I have obstinately gone on against Christ,
and re^sted his call.

Answ. Though we are not to lessen the sins of any, yet a Physician may say,
Final obstinacy and ^ea^, s^r^ow and n^pp^ng ^^e of mind to believe seld^m*
fall in one person.
its not so desperate a disease as ye say it is; so may we say, its a strong
disease that overcomes the art of Christ; though it falls seldom out never to
my observing, that any finally obstinate can attain to wide, broad and auxious
wishes to enjoy Christ, with some seen and acknowledged need of Christ.

Object. 5. But what encouraging comfort have I to believe, since I have gone
farther on in obstinacy then any?

Answ. There cannot be such an encouraging comfort in a non-convert as is
satisfactory; no work can be in a non-convert of that strain with such as are
in converts; No unconv^rted one capabl^ of ^uch are (...) to beli^ve a^ a
bel^ever.
ye are not to look for so much in your self as in others; but he is far
behind, who may not follow.

Object. 6. Nay, I find nothing in me that may qualify me^ for Christ.

Answ. Fit and sufficient qualifications for Christ is the hire of merit, that
we naturally seek in our selves. Antinomians do not a little injure us,
because we teach that obstinate sinners as obstinate and proud are not
immediately to believe; (...) us to b^lieve, yet the proud as proud cannot
b^lieve.
not that it is not their duty to believe, but because believing is physically
incompatible with these persons that are to believe; since believing is the
going of the sinner out off himself to Christ; and a proud obstinate and
rebellious sinner never broken, nor in no sort humbled under that
reduplication, stays in himself. But we are far from exhorting any to stand
aloof and afar off from Christ, because they cannot be prepared sufficiently
for him, or because they have not a present to bring the King. Yea come, as ye
are bidden, kiss the son, but tremble and stoop, faith is a lowly thing;
merit or hire sufficient, in half or in whole, penny, or penny worth, to give
to Christ, before a sinner come to Christ, or after, we utterly disclaim.

Ob. 7. But I have low thoughts of Christ, and am afraid he will cast me
away; how then can J have low thoughts of my self, and be humbled, ere I
believe?

Answ. There be not any of us who teach that saving humility goes before
faith. It is one thing to be broken, No saving humil^tie before faith.
and plowed, another to be humble and harrowed: the law must break the r^ckie
ground, ere ye believe. But Christ must break the clods, and harrow, and soften
the soul; true humiliation follows faith.

Ob. 8. But base thoughts of Christ, which I find in my self are most
contrary to faith: I think Christ not so meek a lamb, as to put a Wolf, a
Tiger, or a Leopard in his bosom.

Answ. Not any, but they have too low thoughts of Christ, ere they can come to
him; for the Gospel in whole and in part, All the Gospel expressi^n^ of the
^eek^e^ of Christ argue a di^ease in us to conceive Christ to be rough,
lordly, cruel, to have a heart li^e the nether millstone.
is medicine. Christ has a healing tongue; medicine is relative to sickness:
Christ would never have said to unbeleevers, John. 6.39. him that comes, J
will in no wise cast away: If m^n had not naturally had such thoughts of
Christ, as he is rough, and strange, and Lordly, and so far from meekness
that he casts thousands of poor sinners out that come to him: so Christ's
tongue in speaking these words, is good physic: all of us have j^alous and
strange thoughts of Christ; Ye may know the dis^ase by the phy^^ck: contraria
contrarijs curantur. The wear^e and laden sinners take Christ to be rough,
and not meek* therefore says Christ, come unto me, all ye that are weary, and
laden; and I will ease you: If he be a shepherd, we natura^ly think* if we
cannot go on our own feet, he has a club to beat u^; Therefore Esai 40.11.
The Lord says, Not so, he will not beat those that want l^gs of their own to
follow him: but he shall carry the Lambs in his bosom, and gently lead those
that are with young: yea, if converts and weak ones had not jealousies, Ah,
Christ is above us, and so lordly, so just, that if we be not as strong as
others, he will break us, it had not been prophesied of him* Esai. 43. a bruis^
dreed shall he not break, a smoking flax shall he not quench: Now precious
thoughts of Christ ye cannot have till ye come to Christ, and buy from him a
new mind, and new thoughts, without money.

Ob. 9. But believing is fruitless, and unpossible, if I be excluded from the
number of those that Christ died for; for then I am to believe remission of
sins without shedding of blood; and Christ shed no blood for me.

Answ. You are neither to lay such a supposition down, th^^ either you are
excluded from the number of those that Christ died for, or included in that
number: neither of the two are revea^ed to you, and secret things belong to the
Lord. It is enough to you, How all are to believe, though salvation be not
purchased for all.
that (1.) you are not excluded, for any thing that is revealed to you. 2. That
thou have need of Christ, and art a guilty sinner. 3. That thou art commanded
to believe: As for Christ's not shedding of his blood for thee; say it were so:
its no more absurd that you are obliged to believe on Christ, as an al
sufficient Redeemer for remission of sins, (though remission be not purchased
to you in Christ's blood) then that you are obliged to believe that God will
infallibly save you, when as God has peremptorily reprobated you, upon foreseen
final impenitencie; and has decreed not to work in you to believe, and has not
purchased by his blood, the grace of believing; without the which, he sees
believing is unpossible. Let Arminians answer the one doubt, and we can answer
the other; only, their way makes God to say, he wills the salvation of
reprobats; which in very truth, he wills not; for its protestatio facto
contraria: a will contrary to his dispensation toward them* and so no will;
whereas we acknowledge God in his promises, commands, charges to be most
sincere, and that the promises belong only to the children of the promise, not
to the rebrobate.

Ob 10. But its unpossible I can be fitted with sorrow for sin or repentance,
before I believe in Christ. Answ. We teach not that you must first repent,
Neither is faith before all Repentance, nor eevry Repentance before all faith.
then believe; or first believe, then repent; but that some legal acts of
sorrow, and bruisings of Spirit, and self despair go before faith, then acts of
believing, and then evangelick repentance, in seeing by faith, him whom ye have
pie^ced with your sins, and the mourning for piercing of him. Zach. 12.10.
But your need, beggarlinesse, sinfulness may well be a spur to chase you to
Christ: seeing Christ heighteneth his fair grace by occasion of your black
sins, Romans 3.5.20.2. Romans 3.24.25.

If Christ have such a good will to draw all men; ah! shall he draw all men*
and such a fair number of all ranks, and not draw me? Lord Jesus, what a^ls
thee at me? If Christ draw all, we should be drawn.
when offices of estate are distributed, and livings and pensions given to men,
there be some malcontents; this man is preferred, no^ I: It were good there
were spiritual male-contentednesse, with se^f-discontent, at our own
rebellion* and no envying of others: O that Christ who draws all men, would
draw me, and he that has love for so many, would out of his love cause me say,
Whether is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy bel^ved
turned aside, that we may seek him with thee? say there were a free gold mine
in India, that loadeth with gold all ships, and enriches multitudes that go
thither, and it has never drawn thee to make a journey thither, blame thy self,
if thou be poor, when many are enriched. 1. Has not Christ knocked at the
door of thy soul, with a rainie head, and frozen lo^ks, and thou had rather
he should fall into a swoone, in the streets, as open to him, and lodge him;
and have had open back doors for harlot lovers: O be ashamed of sleighting
free love. 2 Despised love turns into a flame of Go^pel-vengeance: a
Gospel-hell is a hotter furnance, then a law-hell.

No man spinn hell to himself, out of the wool of unbeleeving despair; Christ
can dra^ as g^ilty as thou art.
If Christ be so willing to redeem and draw his own all, and can go as near
hell as seven devils: Have noble and broad thoughts of the sufficiency of Jesus
to save. 1. Consider and say with feeling and warmness of bowels to Christ,
all the redeemed family that are standing up before the throne, now in white,
and are fair and clean and without spot, were once as Black mores on earth, as
I am now: some of them were stables of uncleanness to Satan; now they a^e
cha^t virgins, who defiled not themselves with women, before the Lamb; the
mou^hs that sometimes blasphemed, are now singing the new song of the Lamb, of
Moses the servant of the Lord. 2 What love is that, that there is a hole in the
rock, for ravens of hell to fly into as doves of heaven; and a chalmer of love
in the heart of Christ, for pieces of sinful clay? 3. Fair Jesus Christ can
love the black daughter of Pharaoh; he has found in his heart to melt in love
and tender compassion, toward a forlorn Amorite, a poluted Hittite; it breaks
his heart to see the naked foundling cast out into the open fields, dying in
goared blood: Christ can love, where all do loath; Its much he can love a
sinner, thou art but a sinner; he has not blotted thy name out of the New
Testament; imagine thou heard him say, sinner come to me: Lost man, suffer me
to love thee, and to cast my skirt of love over thee: Do^ but give him an
hearty (^ay Lord) cons^nt, and take him at his word; Never rest, till thou be
at such a nick of the way to heaven, Use 6.
as no backslider can attain to: We are too soon satisfied with our own
Godliness, and go not one step beyond these that has cast out of
themselves, one Devil, and the next day take in seven new f^esh devils, and the
end of these men is worse then their beginning; they are redemned, and bought
and washen in profession, and righteous in themselves; those that have no more,
must fall away: a Sheep in the eyes of men, and a Sow at the heart, must to the
mire again, sit not down, till ye come (1.) to be willing to sell all, Be not
satisfied till you come to such a n^ck of Christian walking, as is attainable
by no hypocrite.
and buy the pearl: 2. Till ye attain to some real and personal
mortification; that is a subduing of lusts, a bringing under the body of sin,
a heart-deadnesse to the world, (from this) because your Lord died for you, and
has crucified the old man; I mean not a moral mortification of Antinomians, to
believe Christ has crucified your lusts for you, as if you were obliged by
command of the letter of Law and Gospel, to no personal mortification, that ye
may be saved: never think ye are redeemed, till ye be redeemed from the
walking in the ways of the present evil world* from all iniquity, from your
vain conversation: draw not breath, rest not, till ye come to this, as ye would
not turn back sliders in heart.

Redemption believed, makes men crown Christ as their King; Use 7.
and such to whom Christ is made redemption, must assert and confess Christ a
perfect Red^emer, the King of his Church: Those that are unpatient of his yoke
of Government, would set another king over Christ, a Magistrate who by office
rules, not by the wo^d, but by civil Laws, testify they are unwilling to have
Christ their Lord, in their life, who will not have him their Lord in the
Church, and his ordinances: the great controversy that God has with England,
is sleighting of Religion, the not building the Temple, the increase of
blasphemies and heresies; fear that Christ reign over them, 33. If I be lifted
up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.

The fourth considerable article in the drawing* is the terminus ad qu^m, the
person to whom all m^n are drawn. It is (says Christ) (...), to me: This is
not a word which might have been spared, as there is no redundancie, Christ
cannon be spared as not nec^ssary in the work of redemption.
nothing more then enough in the Gospel, so Christ is no person who may be
spared; but who ever be one, Christ must be the first person; take away Christ
out of the Gospel, and there remains nothing but words, and remove him from
the work of redemption, ^t is but an empty shadow; Yea, remove Christ out of
heaven, I should not seek to be there; this is a noble and divine ( to me) I
will draw all men to me. Doct. It is a matter of great conce^^ment that
sin^^^st come to Christ, and to Christ only.
1. It concern^th us much what we^ leave. If we leave the earth, it is but a
clay footstool, and a mortal p^rishing stage, and the house of sorrow* and my
dying fellow creature: if we leave sin we leave hell, the worm that never
dies; v^ngeance and eternal vengeance is in the womb o^ s^nne; to leave
father and mother, and all the idols of a fancied happiness is nothing; But to
whom we go; to Christ, or not, to such an one as God, the substantial and
eternal delight of God, O that is of h^gh concernment.

2. This (to me) coming out of the mouth of Jesus Christ, is all and all its
heaven, its glory, its salvation, its new paradise, Gr^unds of the excellency
of being drawn to Christ only.
its the new city, i^s the new life, its the new precious elect stone laid on
Zion, the new glory, the new kingdom: There is a greater emphasis, an edge and
marrow of words and things, in this (to me) then in all the sc^ipture, in all
earth and heaven and all possible and imaginable heavens. 1. Why is Israel
loosed? hear the cause, Psalm. 81.11. Israel would none of me. Why drink they
^otten waters, and Ci^terns of hell? Oh here is the cause, Ier, 2^ 1^. Be
astonished O heavens, why? for my people have committed two evils: (Ah, these
two are hundreds, and million^) they have forsaken me, the fountain of living
waters. Is not Christ crying in all the Gospel, who will have me? who will
receive me? is not this the Gospel-quarrell, John 5.40? Ye will not come to me,
that ye might have life; its no sport to die in sin* its a sad fall to fall
into hell, Ioh. 8.21. Then said Jesus again unto them I go my way, and ye shall
seek me, and shall die in your sins* whither I go ye cannot come.

3. If ye look to any other, it cannot save you, but one look on him would make
you eternally happy, and you have i^, Esa. 45.22. Look unto me, and be saved,
all the ends of the Earth, for I am God, and there is none else; come and have
heaven for one look, for one turning of your eye; and when destruction comes,
that the Church shall be like two or three olive berries lef^, and all the rest
destroyed; what shall save the remnant? Esa. 17.7. At that day shall a man look
to his maker, and when Jerusalem is saved, and the Spirit of grace and
supplication is poured on the house of David, Zach. 12.10. And they shall look
upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns
for his only Son.

4. You are poor and naked; then says Christ, lean and hungry, and ye that
want bread, and ye that sweat, and give out money, Esa. 55.3. Hear^ ^n
diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight
it self in fatness, ver. 3. Incline your care to me, and hear, and your soul
shall live, and I will make an everlasting Cov^nant with you even the sure
merries of David; Then a soul dies a souls death, he is lean, he eats
dirt, he has no bread, while he comes to Christ, Revel. 3.18. I counsel thee
to buy of me. O this noble me! this brave, celebrious, this glorious me; I
counsel thee to buy of me (and not of others who are but cousening hucksters)
gold tried in the fire; gold buyeth all things, and is not bought; but this is
not a common Merchant; and buy of me white raiment that thou may be
clothed. But thou may^t have a burden on thee heavier then ^hy back or bones
can stand under; then hear him, Ma^th. 11.28. Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are laden, and I will give you rest: and because all are thirsty for
some happiness, the desires are gaping for some heaven, Christ crye^h at
Ie^usalem with a loud voice, with a good will ^o save, Ioh. 7.37. If any man
thirst let him come to me, and drink, Ioh. 11.26. He that lives and b^lieveth
in me, shall never die.

5. What greater reason then to hear this, Cant. 5.2. O^en to me, my sister,
my dove, my love, my undefiled; and wisdoms voice is swee^, Prove. 7.14.
Hearken unto me therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth,
Esa. 49.1. Listen O Isle^ to me, so he speaks to his redeemed, Esa. 48.16.
Come ye near to me: and

6. There is nothing more fitting then that his oath stand, that the knee that
will not bow to him shall break. Esa. 45.23 I h^ve sworn by my self, Romans
14.11. For it is written, as I live (says the Lord) every knee shall bow to
me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

7. What greater honor can be then such alliance? then that Christ speak so to
his bride, Hos. 3.3. And I said unto her, thou shall abide for me many days,
thou shall not play the harlot, and thou shall not be for another man, so will
I be for thee: and Hos 2.19. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea I
will betr^th thee unto me, ver. 20. I will even betroth thee unto me in
faithfulness.

8. To him is that which may be ground of faith and confidence, Luke 10.22. All
things are delivered to me of my Father, Math. 28.19. All power is given to me
in Heaven and in earth; there is a great trust put upon christ, Ioh. 17.^.
Thine they were, and thou gave them me, Heb. ^.13. Behold I and the child^en
that God has given me. Luke 22.29. The father has appointed a Kingdom to me.

This, to me* has yet a greater edge and fullness of Christ's soul-taking and
drawing expressions: 1. To Christ, we are drawn as to a friend; approaching to
Christ is expressed by coming to him; 1. We come to him as to our home, Christ
an^ home and a house of rest and of love.
the man that comes to Christ is in a friends house; Christ will not cast him
out, Ioh. 6.39. The man may throw down his loads and burdens, and cast him
self and his burden on him, and find rest for his soul; he does not stand,
nor run any mo^e, but sit down under the shadow of the tree of life, Cant.
2.3. I sat down under his shadow with great delight; Heb. I lusted or desired
him, and sat down and his fruit was sweet in my mouth. And how did Christ take
with the soul? O most kindly! v. 4. He led me into a house of wine. What do you
think of a house of joy? every stone, every rafter, every piece of covering,
wall, and floor is the cheering consolation of the holy Ghost, and what
futher? his banner over me is love, the colors and ensign of this
Chieftaine, is the love of Christ. 6. And what love-rest is here? his left hand
is under my head, and his right hand does embrace me. What a bed of love must
that be, to lie in a corner, in a circle infolded in the two everlasting arms?
the left arm is near the heart, such a soul must lie with heart and head
upon the breast and heart of Jesus Christ; and above, and underneath for
pillow, for covering, for curtains, arms of everlasting love: an house all
made, within and without, of eternal joy and consolations, is incomparable:
such a chamber of a King, such cullou^s and hangings as love, such a bed as the
embracings of Christ, you never heard of.

2. Life is the sweete^^ flower of any being, its a taking thing now, A noble
life in Ch^^st which cannot be brought.
1 John 5.12. He that has the Son has life; all out of Christ are dead men;
so we come to Christ as our life, 1 ^er. ^.4. To whom coming as to a living
stone, disallowed indeed of men; but that's no ma^ter; chosen of God, and
precious: who cr^^d we, but here, o^ a stone with life, and so noble a life as
an intellectual life, and then the life of God? O death come to thy life, that
is hid with Christ in God, Col. 3.3. Here a breathing living stone, and then a
chosen one, of great p^ice; should all the crowned Kings, since Adam to the
dissolving of this world sell themselves, their Globe of the earth, and all
their precious stones, they should not buy a days glory in heaven; but say
that they should sell the earth and the heavens, and oppignorate or lay in
pledge Sun and Moon and Stars, if they were their moveable inheritance, and
sell them all millions of times, they should be far from any comparable
buying of the elect precious stone that is dug out of Mount Sion, Job 28.13.
Man knows not the price of wisdom, of this wisdom, v. 18. no mention shall
be made of coralls, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above Rubies,
ver. 19. The To^az of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued
with pure Gold; there is no talking, no bidding in this market so precious is the
s^one, but its the stone living, and breathing out heaven, and God, infinitely
more ex^ell^nt then heaven.

3. To me (says Christ) because no excellency can be comparable to him, What
excellency is Christ.
who only can give God to the sinner, Joh. 14.6. No man comes to the Father
but by me; it must be an incomparable privilege to come by Jesus Christ, to
God; God, God is a^l in all. I can^o^ savi^gly be drawn to any but to him, who
can reveal God to me. Christ is the bosom, the heart, the only new and living
way and door to God* all creatures, Angels, Men, Saints are strangers to God.
The substantial, the essential, the l^ving intellectual Image, and being God
must reveal God; Christ says to Philip, Ioh. 14.9. He that has seen me, has
seen the Father: open Christ and you open God; enjoy Christ, and you enjoy God;
come into Christ and you come to a new world, to a new all, to an new infinite
Ocean, and you fall in the bosom of a Godhead.

4. To me] as to all perfection and compleatnesse of fullness; they are but all
streams and shaddows, and emptiness while you come to Christ, Three parts of
Christ's compleatness^, 1. (...) or fuln^sse, 2. primacy, 3. excellency.
poor nothing is an empty bottom to a sinner, Ioh 1.16. Out of his fullness
have all we received even grace for grace; this is fountain fullness, Gods
fullness, Col. 2.9. For in Christ is fullness it self: 2. Not fullness going
and coming; there a fullness in the Sea, but it is ebbing and flowing; a
fullness in the Moon, but decreasing and growing; an fullness in the creature,
but going and coming up and and down; but in Christ there dwells a fullness;
it is with Christ new Moon and full Moon, and dawning and noonday all at once:
3. All fullness dwells in Christ, What fullness is in Christ.
there is fullness of beauty in Absalom, but not of truth and sincerity;
fullness of wisdom in Solomon, but not fullness of constancy; he gave his
heart to pleasure and folly; fullness of policy in Achitophel, but not fullness
of holiness and faithfulness to his Prince; yea, it was fullness of folly to
hang himself; fullness of strength in Sampson, but not fullness of faith and
soundness and courage of mind, he was strong in body, but soft and impotent
in mind and was overcome by an woman; there is an hiatus, a hole, and some
emptiness in every creature: an Angels fullness sits neighbor to pure
nothing, the Angel may be turned unto nothing, and is by nature capable of
folly: But in Christ there is all fullness; 4 But as every fullness is not all
fullness, so every fullness is not the fullness of the Godhead; the^, to me
its as much as the Elect are drawn to Christ as the choycest, the rarest
amongst all.

2. So amongst all choice things and all relat^ons, C^^ist the first and
principa^l of all things.
he is the first and most eminent and glo^ious among Kings, Revel. 1.5. The
Prince of the kings of the earth, Revel. 10.16. The King of kings, the Lord of
lords; Among Prophets, the P^ophet, raised out of the inw^rd part of the
Breth^en, Deuteronomy. 18.18. among Priests, the highest and great, the eternal
Priest, after the order of Melchizedech: Heb. ^.1. Heb. 7.17. among gods, he
stands, he is alone the only wise God; 1 Timothy 1.17. Among Angels, the Angel of
the Lords substanciall presence, the Archangel, the head of Angels: Esai.
63.9. 1. These. 4.16. Col. 2.10. Among beautiful things, the flower of Jesse,
the rose of Sharon, the lil^y of the valleys, fai^er then the children of men;
Isai. 11.1^. Cant. 2.1. Psalm. 45.2. there is such grace created in no lips, yea
uncreated grace is in no face, but in his only: among shepherds, the chief
shepherd, 1 Pet. 5.4. among Armies the standard bearer, and Chief amongst ten
thousand, Cant. 5.10. amongst Creatures, the firstborn of every creature,
Col. 1.15. among H^irs, the Heir of all things, Heb. 1.2. among those that were
dead, and is alive again, and the fruit that grows out of death; Christ is
the fi^st-born from the dead, Col. 1.18. and the first fruits of them that
sleep, 1 Cor. 15.20. among sons he is Gods first begotten son, Heb. 1.6.
his only begotten son, 1 ^ohn 4.9. among Saviors none to be named a Savio^^
under heaven but he only, Acts 4, 12. neither is there salvation in any other:
the first among brethren, Romans 8.29. the first born among many brethren. In a
word, he i^ the choice and the first of the flock, the flower, the first
glory, the standerd-bearer of heaven, the heart, the rose, the prime delight of
heaven, the choicest of heaven and earth, the nonesuch, the chief of all
b^loveds. Some have one single excellency, some another; Abraham was excellent
in faith, Moses in his cho^se of Christ above all the treasures of Egypt; David
in his sincerity, having a heart like Gods heart. But Christ has all eminency
of grace in one. Some are Gods that shall die as men. Christ the Prince of life
was dead, but can die no more. Some are wise, but he is w^sdome it self; some
are fair, but Christ is the beauty and brightness of the Fathers glory. We
are apt to have low and creeping thoughts of Jesus Christ, and to undervalue
Christ.

3. There Is need of an Angel-engine framed in heaven, of a tongue immediate^y
created by God, The singular excellency of Christ.
and by the infinite Art of omnipotency, above other tongues to speak of the
praises of christ; and that Pen must be molded of God, and the Ink made of the
river of the water of life, None c^n write or speak of Christ as he is.
and the Paper fairer then the body of the Sun, and the heart as pure, as
innocent and sinlesse Angels, who should write a Book of the virtue and
supereminent excellency of Jesus Christ: All words even uttered by Prophets and
Apostles, come short of Christ. Imagine that Angels and Men, and millions of
created heavens of more then now are should build a Temple and a high Seat or
Throne of Glory, raised from the earth to the highest circumference of the
heaven of heavens, and millions of miles above that highest of heavens, and let
the timber not be Cedar or Almugge trees, nor the inside Gold of Ophir seven
times refined, but such trees as should grow out of the banks of the pure River
of water of Life, that runs through the street of the New Jerusalem, and
overlayd with a new sort of Gold that was found above the Sun and Stars,
many degrees above the Gold of Ophir; and let the stones not be Marble, nor
Saphires, nor Rubies, nor dug out of the excellentest earth imaginable, but
more re^^ined then elementary nature can furnish; let every stone be a star,
or a piece of the body of the Sun, and let the whole fabric of the House
exceed the glory of Solomon's Temple as far as all precious stones exceed the
mire in the streets, and let Jesus Christ sit above in the highest Seat of
Glory in this Temple, as he dwelt in Solomon's Temple, the chair should be but
a created shadow, too low and to base for him. This is not yet like the Lords
expression by the Apostle, showing how eminent and high Christ is, Phil. 2.9.
Wherefore God also has more then exalted him; he says not (...). God has
highted or exalted Christ; but God has (...) over-highted and super-exalted
him, and has gifted to him (...), a name above all names that is real honor,
above all expression, above all thoughts; if such a temple and seat of Majesty
might be named, it should not be above every name, nor a glory above every
glory that can be named either in this world, or in the world to come.

To me] Conversion is the drawing of a sinner to Christ, its a supernatural
journey, its not a common way; to come to this eternal wisdom of God, as
says Job 28.7. A path which no foul knows and the vultures eye has not
seen; where is the place of understanding, ver. 21. seeing it is hid from all
living, and kept close from the fowls of the air, v. 22. destruction and death
say we^* have heard the fame thereof with our ^ares, ver. 23. where is it then?
Natures dark candle cannot show it, ver. 23. God und^rstandeth the way thereof,
and he knows the place thereof, Prove. 15.24. The way of life is on high; the
way of the life of all excellent lives is an high and an exalted way, every man
knows it not.

2. Christ says, by way of exclusion, that he gets not one soul to him,
but by strong hand and violence; never man comes to Christ on his own
clay-leggs, To be d^a^en to Christ, i^ a ^igh wo^k.
and with the strength of his own good will, Ioh. 6.44. No man can come to me,
except the Father, which has sent me, draw him.

3. There be other acts of God, of an high reach, in these that come to Christ,
as there must be resigning over, a making over of the Father to the Son, v.
39. All that the Father gives me, The Father gives us to the Son^e, not by
ali^nation.
shall come; The Fathers making over of any soul, or his giving one to Christ,
is not by way of alienation, as if the man belonged no more to the Father, or
were no more under the tutorie, and guidance of the Father, but under the
son. Familists teach us Story of the ^ise, reign and ^uine, of the
Antinomians error. 41.8 p.

Libert^nes tea^h that we are several seasons under the working ^f every person
of the Trinity.


That there be distinct seasons of the working of the several persons of the
Trinity, so as the soul may be said to be so long under the fathers, and not
the Sons, and so long under the Sons work, and not the Spirits.

We know no such destinct posts to heaven, nor such shifting from hand to
hand; the Saints have many bouts, in their way to glory, but all the three
jointly at the same season help at the lifting of the dead out of the graves,
Ioh. 6.39.44.45. Ioh. 5 24.25. All the three in one dead list, opens blind
eyes, and converteth lost sinners, Matthew. 11.25.26.27. Ephesians. 1.17.18. Mat.
16.17. Ioh. 12.32. 2 Cor. 3.14.15.16.17. Ioh. 14.23. Ioh. 16.7, 8.9.10. Ioh.
14.16. Ephesians. 2.1.2.3.4. 1 I^^. 2.27. 1 Ioh. 5.6.7. Grace mercy and peace, comes
that the same season, to the seven Chu^ches* from all the three: From him which
is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the seven Spirits that is
before the throne, and from Ie^us Christ, who is the faithful witness, etc. 2
Cor. 13.14. Revel. 1.45. Then the Father so gives the elect to the son, as I
should not desire to be out from under the care and tutory of the Father; the
Father makes them over, and keeps them in his own bowels, and in the truth,
Ioh. 17.2.10.11. So there is the Fathers teaching, and the hearing and learning
from the Father, Ioh. 6.15. It is written in the Prophets, and they shall all
be taugh^ of God, Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the
Father, comes to me.

In the uses of the doctrine, I have three things to speak of; 1. What a sin
they be under, who resist the right arm of the Father. 2. What free will and
moral honesty can do, or how nothing they are to work a communion with God.
3. These are to be refuted, who think we are neither to p^ay, nor to do, nor
to work out our salvation in fear and trembling, but when the Lord by saving
Grace acts in us, and draws irresistibly. Now to the end that this common
Gospel-sinne may be the better seen in all its spots, consider, 1. What is in
Christ the drawer. 2. What is in Grace, by which sinners are drawn.

1. In Christ the drawer: What a sin it is to resist Christ's* drawing.
There be many drawers suiting us: the world is the tail of the great red
Dragon, and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast
them down to the earth, Revel. 12.4. Glorious professors like glistering
stars up in heaven, are drawn away, after the dirty world: should there be
more power in Satan's tail to draw down stars from heaven, None so good at
drawing of sinners as Christ.
then there is beauty and sweetness in Christ's face to ravish hearts? and
Deuteronomy. 30.17. Some turn away their hearts, and are drawn away* and worship other
gods, and serve them; yet they are but bastard gods: Christ has a true, real
Godhead in himself. Why will you not be drawn after the smell of his
precious ointments? and Act. 5.37. Judas of Galilee arose, and drew away much
people after him, and they were destroyed, and Iam. 1.14. every tempted man
(and who is not tempted?) is drawn away of his own lust; and this is a mother
with child of death and hell: supposed goodness is an angle, a vast net, that
draws millions of souls to eternal perdition; every man has a soule-drawer
about him, devils, and false teachers are pulling at, and hailing souls. O be
drawn by Christ; he is the rose without a thorn, the Sun without a cloud,
the beauty of the Godh^ad without a spot; he draws his Fathers heart to love
him, and delight in him: Christ's love and the art of free grace, are good at
drawing of souls; there is not a soule-drawer comparable to him: Ah our hearts
are as heavy as hell; suppose that hell were of the bigness of ten worlds, all
of Sand, iron, or the heaviest stones in the world, nay, all fancies that
pretend loveliness are but lies, and Christ true: every piece of fair clay is
hell, and Christ heaven; every beauty blackness, and he all loves, Cant. 5.16.

2. For alluring souls in a moral way, nothing like Christ in the Gospel;
David is called by the holy Ghost, the sweet singer of Israel; N^thing like
Christ to allure souls.
when Christ speaks to hearts, he sings like heaven, and like the glory of a
new unseen world, Deuteronomy. 3^.16. Joseph was blessed of the Lord, for the good
will of him that dwelt in the bush; Its most alluring in Christ that he is the
bird in the bush, the bird of Paradise, the Turtle in our Land, Can. 2.12. that
sings the sweet Gospel-hymnes, Christ the sweet singer of Israel.
and Psalms of good tidings from Sion, peace, peace from heaven to the
brokenhearted mourners in Sion; all the Gospel is a love-song of Christ dying
for love to enjoy sinners of clay, and to have them with him in heaven; are not
these love-songs of the bird whose nest was in the bush? If any man thirst
(says Christ) let him come to me and drink; and whosoever will, let him take
of the water of life freely; if this cannot draw to Christ: the law, curses,
rewards, cannot draw; Christ pipeth a spring of joyful news, but few dance,
Matthew. 11.16.

3. The lower that high love discendeth, the sweeter and the more drawing, and
the greatest guiltiness not to be drawn. Christ came down from a Godhead, The
lower Christ is in his love, he is the more drawing.
and emptied himself for us to be a worm, and no man, Psalm. 22.6. The last of
men, Esa. 53.3. a doubt it was, if he were in the number of men, so the word
imports; and he dwelt in the bush; he made not his nest amongst Cedars, but
in the bush (...) a bush, whence comes Sinah, or a desert and wilderness,
such as was in Arabia; Christ takes it hard, and weepeth for it, Matthew. 23.37.
Luk 19.42. that he came down as a hen in the bush; (O but Christ has broad
wings, far above the Eagle) and would have made sinners in Jerusalem his
young ones, to nourish them with heat, from his own bosom and heart; but they
would not be drawn: And when he appears in a time of captivity, Zach. 1. to
save his people out of captivity, many would not be saved; he is seen, ver. 8.
amongst the myrtle trees in the bottom. It is true, the myrtle tree is far^e
above the bry^r and the thorn, Esai. 55.13. yet its as much, a^ Christ dwells
amongst the bushes, and came down to the lowest plants, for the Myrtle is a
bush rather then a tree, and grows in Valleys, Deserts, in the Sea-shoar:
Christ is a young low Pla^^, and a root out of a dry ground; its a matter of
challenge that none believed his report, and few were drawn by the Lord Jesus,
who is Gods arm, all the strength of God and the drawing power of grace being
in Christ, and in Christ who came down so low in his love to us; low-stooping
love refused is a great deal of guiltiness; salvation it self cannot save,
when love submitting it self to hell, to death, to shame, to the grave, cannot
save: you think little to let a love song of the Gospel four times a week
pass by you; but you know not what a guiltiness it is.

4. The greater the happiness you are drawn to, the higher is the sin,
should Christ d^aw you to the Mount burning with fire, to the Law-curses, to
the terrible sight of the fiery indignation of God, men would say it were less
sin to refuse him; but he draws you, Heb. 12.22. To Mount Sion, to the City
of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of
Angels, to the general assembly and Church of the first born which are written
in Heaven, and to God the Iugde of all, and to the spirits of just men made
perfect; And to Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of
sprinkling; and he adds, despise not this; he is a Speaker from heaven: Its
but ene house, one family, which is in earth and heaven; Heaven and the Church
on earth but ene house.
they differ but as elder and younger brethren. Paul, Romans 16.7. puts a note
of respect on Andronicus and Junia, Who says he) also were in Christ before
me. There is more honor put on them that are in glory before us, then on us,
as the first born of nature and grace; It is an honor to d^e in the Lord young.
so the first born of glory are honored before us (we should not weep for our
friends crown and honor, when they die) yet they be all one house; then to be
drawn to Christ is to be drawn to heaven; he should deservedly weep for ever,
and gnash his te^^h in hell, who in right down terms refuses to be drawn to
heaven.

There is another ground of showing what a high provocation it is, to resist
the Gosp^l-drawings of Christ's arm, and it is the way of resisting the
operation of grace Interpreters* say on the Text that Christ's drawing, when he
is lifted upon the cross, Christ dying and drawing sinne^s in his death ^^d
c^m^^nds his love to us.
is a clear allusion to the manner of Christ's crucifying, for he with his two
arms stretched out, holds out his breast, opens his bosom and heart, and
cries who will come and lodge in Ch^^st's heart; And again, favors proffered
by a great friend in his death, ought not to be refused; and the sour^ tree of
the Cross was Christ's dead bed; here he made his last will, and which no dying
friend does, Christ dying left his heart, and bowels of tender love to his dear
friends, he dyed drawing and pulling in sinners to his heart; What a sin must
it be to meet his love with hatred and disdain? 2. Grace moves in a circle of
life, the spring and fountain is the heart of Christ, and it reflecteth back
to Chri^ts heart; he rests not with stretched out-armes, to pull, while he
have his friends and Church in at his heart. 3. The motion of free grace is a
subduing, and a conquering thing, and strong to captivate our love; when ye
see Christ dying and leaping for joy to die for you, and when ye see him set
to his head a cup of thick wrath, of death and hell, and see him smile and
sing, and sigh and drink hell and death for you, it lays bands of love on the
heart. What iron bowels must he have who would break the cup on his face, and
despise his love? Grace applied to the heart makes it ingenuous, free,
thankful; how can the sinner withold his love without the greatest
guiltiness, that ever Devils committed? for they cannot resist Christ's drawing
love: O what sweetness of strongest and captivating love to see Christ and the
tear in his eye, and his face foul with weeping, and his visage more marred
then any of the sons of men, Esai. 52.14. and a flood of blood on his body,
Luke 22.44. and yet good will, and joy, and delight to do and suffer Gods will
for us, sitting on his brows, Psalm. 40.6.7, 8. Heb. 10.5, 6, 7. Now when
Christ is burnt up with love, and sick of tender kindness; to cast water on
this love by resisting it, is the highest Gospel-sinne that can be, except
despiting of the holy Ghost; and a third ground of aggravating to the full,
this sin of resisting Christ's drawing, Resisting of Christ's drawing of
sinners, near to the sin against the holy Gho^t.
I take from the judgment and the plague and Gospel-vengeance on such as
Christ draws, and they will not be drawn, and is the sin of the times; I
refer these to two heads.

1. This Gospel despising of Christ now reigning in the Age and Kingdoms that
we live in, comes near to the borders of the sin against the holy Ghost, for
the more men be convinced and enlightened, if they be not drawn to Christ, they
are the nearer to this sin, Heb. 6.4.5. chap. 10.26.27. now may we not think
hardly of these who are convinced of many Gospel Truths, and yet oppose them?
does not Christ's love come near them, and they fly from i^? now but to
neighbor or border on the coasts of a sin, like to the sin against the holy
Ghost, may cost men as dear as the loss^ of their soul and the next furnace
for torment and pain, to these that sin against the holy G^o^t.

2. The ^^mporall p^ague tha^ comm^th nearest to eternal, is the judgment o^
God on the Jews that refused and resisted Christ; see what exp^^ssion is put
on the last judgment, that same is on the judgem^nt of Ierusalems destruction
for resisting Christ: For 1. Its hell-like, when mothers shall wish their
children had never been born; and when they shall as damned in the day of
judgment, pray, Mountains fall on us, and Hills cover us, Luke 23.29.30.

Use 2. If Christ draw all men to him, then they are far wide who think that
free will and moral honesty can bring men to heaven; there be no Moralists in
heaven who were pure Moralists on Earth, and had nothing of the Gospel-drawing
and of supernatural work in them; civil Saints can never be glorified Saints;
thousands are deceived with this; they think their lamp can show them light to
know the Bride-grooms chamber-doore; but ta^e these for marks of deluded men.

1. Such men will shoot and cry at adultery, as he that took Abraham's Wife from
him; Ma^ks of mee^ Moralists never drawn to Christ.
and a Cain may be madded with murdering his brother; but was Cain touched for
Gospel sins? is Judas wakened in conscience for that which is the special
condemning gospel-sinne, the cause of condemnation and dying in sin, Ioh. 3.36.
Ioh. 16.9. chap. 8.24. No, but for murdering his Master; its the light of the
Spirit that sees spiritual sins spiritually.

2. Profession looks like Paradise and the Rainbow; Naked pro^ession a
vain thing.
its big in its own eyes, and the fairest for variety of coulors; but its a
self-plague and does carry millions of souls to hell without din and noise of
feet, its Christ acting judicially on the hypocrite within pistol shot of a
besieged soul, making fireworks under the earth; and when all within are
sleeping, Christ springs a powder-Mine, and burns up all forward:
Gospel-fire-works makes more then ordinary fury in the soul; open, open to
Christ; multiplied fastings, and taking Christ's crown from him are dreadful.

3. They had never a sick-night for the want of Christ; Gospel profession is a
light to let men see to sin, a candle to let men see to go to hell, and lie
down in sorrow with art. Ah what comfort is it that I go to hell, no man
seeing me, and by stealth, and my back to the Pit? What a poor comfort to go
to eternal perdition, fasting and praying monthly, multiplying days of
thanksgiving, and withal plundering Christ of his Royal Crown, following the
sins of Prelates whom God cast out before us, exercising rapine, and
unjustice, giving new laws to Christ, and planting plants, which God will root
out? The manner of perishing is a poor acc^d^nt of death. O but heart-boyling
of love, a faint pulse, a pale and a lean sinner dying for the absence of
Christ, no man but the Spirit and Physician knowing what ails him, are sweet
diseases; let the love of Christ abs^nt be in the man's soul a deep river: how
sweet were it to be drowned in that river, and to die an hundredth deaths in one
day, because he whom the soul loves, is gone away? O watchmen know you not
where he is? O daughters of Jerusalem, can you tell him that I am sick of love?
O shepherds, where is Christ's Tent? where dwells he? what is profession to
this? a shadow, a straw, nothing, vanity.

4 What a decitfull thing is it make free will the great Idol, and to hire an
house in heaven, for the income and rent of merit? can it be imagined that the
love of Christ can be hired? so much as it should have of hire, so much it
should want of free-love; how can the heart of God be taken with the merit of
man? grace is the flower, and the freeness of grace like the beautiful bloome
of the flower; and this freeness is so taking that it lays bands and chains
on the heart; were there a good deserving in the man to buy grace, the cord
should be as a single and untwisted thread. Errors of Libe^tins touching
free-w^ll.

Gods commandments are no conditions of the Covenant of Grace; where is there
one word, that God says to man thou shall do this? if God had put man upon
these things, then they were conditions indeed: but when God takes all upon
himself, where are then the conditions on man's part? -- If there be a
condition, he that undertakes all things in the covenant must needs be in the
fault; if the Lord work not in us a clean heart, and cause us not walk in his
commandments, its then the Lords fault ( abs^t blasphemia) if we sin against
the covenant.

14. The To. Town assertion of Grace, against D. Tailor page 47 48, 49.
blessedness of a man, is only passive, not active in his holy, and
unblameable walking.

To the end that these errors may the more fully be discovered, we are to
enquire in these Assertions, what activitie we have in works of grace.

Asser. 1. In the first moment of our conversion, called actus primus
conversionis, What activity we have in our conversion.
we are mere patients.

1. Because the infusion of the new heart, Ezech. 36.26. the pouring of the
Spirit of Grace and supplication on the family of David, In our first
conversion we are mere patients.
Zach. 12.10. and of the Spirit on the thirsty ground, Esai. 44.3. is a work of
creation, Ephesians. 2.10. Psalm. 51.10. a quickening of the dead, Ephesians. 2.1.2.3.4.
Ioh. 5.25. 2 Cor. 4.6. and the wilderness is not here a coagent for the
causing roses to blossom out of the earth.

2. The effect is not wholly denied of the collateral cause, and ascribed
wholly to another. If Peter and John draw a ship between them, with joint
strength, you cannot say, the one drew the ship, not the other: But Christ said
flesh and blood makes no revelations of Christ, but his father only, Mat.
16.17. Mat. 11.25.26.27. Iam. 1.18. Ioh. 1.18. Then neither blood, nor the will
of man contribute any active in^^uence to the first framing of the new birth;
nor can clay divide the glory of regeneration, with the God of grace, who
makes all things new.

The natural powers in our conversion are not destroyed.
Asser. 2. The soul or its faculties are not destroyed in conversion: Peter's
will which he had when he was young, was the same when converted, but renewed,
Ioh. 21.18. the Saints that Peter writes to, are not to ^unne to the same
excess of riot as of old they wrought the will of the Gentiles 1 Pet. 4.3.4.
Paul and Titus were the same men, when d^sobedient and ser^ing diverse lusts,
and when converted, and now washen, regenerat^d, and justified heirs, Tit.
3.1.2.3.4. Paul the same man, a persecuter and an Apostle, but Grace made a
change, 1 Cor. 15.9.10. the same mind and spirit remains in nature; but they
are renewed in the spirit of the mind. Romans 12.2. Ephesians. 4.23. It is the same
heart, but turned to the Lo^d, 2 Cor. 3.15.16. Christ but removes the scum,
and the dross, and the false metal, The Grace in us inherent is not the
person of the holy Ghost,
and frames the man a new vessel of mercy,

Asser. 3. The person of the holy Ghost is not united to the soul of a
believer, nor are there two persons here united or made one Spirit by union of
person with person; but the person is said to come to the Saints, and to dwell
with them, and to be in them, Ioh. 14.16.17. and God has sent the Spirit of
his son in our hearts, crying, Abba Father, not that the holy Ghost, in propper
person, does in us formally, and immediately believe, pray, love, repent, etc.
We being mere patients in understanding, will, affections, memory, as
Libertines* teach. But the holy Ghost comes to the Saints and dwells in
them, in the spiritual gifts, and saving graces, and supernatural qualities
c^eated in us, by the holy spirit, and acted, excited, and moved, as
supernatural and heavenly habits, to act with the vital influence of our
understanding, will, and affe^^ions.

I prove the former part: Henry Nicholas a German, a blasphemous Libertine,
says, c. 34 sent. 10. God has raised up me, H. N. the ^ast among the the
Holy ones of God, which lay altogether dead, and without breath, and life among
the dead, from the death, and made me alive through Christ, as als^ anointed
me with his godly being manned himself with me, and Godded me with him, etc.
The holy ghost in person immediately works not in the Saints.
1. Because such a union of the person of the holy Ghost in us, believing,
loving, joying, praying, and immediately in us, were that blasphemous dei-fying
and Goding of the Saints, so as believing, loving, praying, were not our works,
but the immediate acts of the holy Ghost, and either the faint manner of
believing, or the cold slacked loving, and praying of Saints, or their not
believing, and sinful omission of the acts of faith, love, praying rejoicing,
could not be more imputed to Saints, as their sinful defects, and
transgressions, (but must be laid on the holy Ghosts score) then we can impute
the splitting of a ship, to the ship it self and not to the negligent and
wilful pilot who of purpose dashed the vessel on a rock; but we must not in
reason blame the ship, but the Pilot; for the loss of the ship, is the only
and proper fault of the man that stirred the ship, and the ship is innocent and
harmless timber: Now what sin can be in the Saints in these supernatural
acts, if the holy Ghost immediately in his own person, stir the helm, and
only, without us, act these in us? we might with as good reason say, the shop
that a man works in does make the portrait, which is a great untruth, since
the artificer in the shop does it* as say that the Saints do pray, believe,
rejoice, if the holy Ghost immediate^y do all these in them, as in a shop

2. Upon the same ground the Lords coming down and filling John Baptist from
his mothers womb, and the Apostles and Steven full of the holy Ghost, should be
the holy Ghosts personal filling of them, and his immediate acting in them,
without any action of them, in preaching, praying, and their heavenly bold
confessing of Christ before men; and there should be no difference between the
Ark and Temple of Jerusalem, filled with the immediate presence of God, in the
Lords manifestation of his glory there, and these Saints filled with God, in
these works of free grace. I shall not believe that the person of God, can be
said to be united to either Ark, Temple, Apostle, or Martyr; all the union is
in the effects and manifestations of graces, or tokens of Divine presence,
which are creatures rising and falling with time.

3. That excellent and living ^rk, the most glo^ious and admirable thing that
heaven has, the Lord Jesus, is God and man, two nature^ united in one person.
But both the word of God making that He* that same Holy thing, borne of the
virgin Mary, the Son of God, Luke 1.5. and that same He, and person who came of
the Jews, according to the flesh, to be God blessed for ever. Romans 9.5. H^br.
7.3. Matthew. 16.13.16, and the third general Council, called that of Ephesus,
and after the counsel of Chalcedone, ver. 4. and 5. do evidence to us that
Christ cannot be two persons as Nestorius dreamed, and one person. Paul spread
the Gospel from Jerusalem to Iliricum, about ten hundredth miles. I know not he,
but the Grace of God that was with him, 1 Cor. 15.9.10. not he, but the Lord:
True, but the question now is whether Paul and the holy Ghost in all these
works of grace, were two persons become one Spirit by union, as some dreamers
affirm; because both did the work; I believe not: God and cloud^ rained down
Manna to Israel; O but Christ's father, John 6. gave the Manna, but the question
is if the person of God were united with the clouds or any second ca^ses
producing Manna; so the Lord makes rich and poor, killet^, and makes alive,
makes snow, froast, fair weather, d^outh, and rain, the Sun to rise, and go
down, and that in his own person, Father, Son, and Spirit; He, he only
made Heaven, Earth, Sea, and all creatures, and the world; (...) Acts 17.25.
and (...) Psalm. 33.9. do prove him to be a person who does all these. But we
cannot say that the person of God must be united with Clouds, Ship, Sea, Sun,
Heavens, Men fighting, and Men Saving, and Killing; and that God personally
fills all creatures, only God in the immensitie of ^is nature, is all these
and every where, and is in them by his operation; so the holy Ghost is with the
Saints, and dwells in (...), not by union of his person to them or the
immensitie of his essence, which is, as David says, every where, Ps. 139.7.
Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? but so he is in Heaven, in Hell, in the
Sea. 2. But he dwells in the Saints, in regard of the works, operations,
gifts, and graces of the holy Ghost.

1. Because the holy Spirit is in them, in that they have in them the fruits of
the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. such as love, joy, peace, Reasons proving that the
person of the Holy Ghost is not un^ted to our souls, but he is in us in his
operations and his effects of graces and gifts.
long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith; now these are not the holy
Ghost, who is eternal, and God uncreated, but are created in time, out of mere
nothing, not out of the potency of the subject, but ere God produce grace, so
knotty and so rocky are we, and so contrary to grace, that he must fall upon a
new and second creation, Ephesians. 2.10. Col. 2.10. Psalm. 51.10. the same word
that is used for creating heaven and earth, Genesis 1.^. is here used; it is not
like the repairing of a fallen house, where the same timber and stones may do
the work, or the repairing of decayed nature, when a healthy body recovereth
out of a fever, Grace is a rare and curious workmanship.

2. We are said to grow in grace, 2 Pet. 3.18. and by grace to increase to the
edifying of the body in love, Ephesians. 4.16. and to the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ, 13. and to add grace to grace, 2 Pet. 1.5.6.7. and to
go on to perfection, Heb. 6.1. Phil. 3.12. But the person of the holy Ghost,
is no^ capable of growing, or addition, nor like the morning light, or the New
Moon, that can grow and advance in perfection, being God blessed for ever.

3. If there be an union of the person of the Holy Ghost with the soul, and
not an in-dwelling by graces, the believer as a believer, must live by the
uncreated and eternal life of the Holy Ghost, or a created life. Creatum vel
increatum dividunt omne ens immediate, sicut finitum and infinitum: Not the
former, neither any man, nor the man Christ can in any capacity be elevated so
above it self, as to partake of the infinite life of God; how the manhood of
Christ partaketh of the personal subsistence of the Godhead, is
incomprehensible to me, except that it is not by such a union as my singular
nature stands under personality created, and is by assumption rather then
union, how ever if there be an union of the person of the Holy Gho^^ to our
souls, it cannot be conceived, nor does Scripture speak of it; if the Saints
live the life of God, it must be by created Graces, and this is that we
conceive.

4 The person of the Holy Ghost immediately acting in the Saints, without them
or any active and vital influence of the natural faculties, cannot be guilty
of sin, because David and Christ are absolved of sin in this. They l^yd to
my charge things that I knew not, that is, things I never acted, crimes in
which I had no action or hand: but we are blamed in the word, for all the
omissions of holy duties; and the Holy Ghost cannot be blamed, for he blows
when, and where he lists, and is under no Law, in his motions of free grace;
then he who cannot be blamed in not acting, cannot be united as one spirit,
person with person, with him who is justly to be blamed in not acting.

Asser. 4 It must evidently follow that there is in the Saints a grace created
that is neither Christ, Christ and the inherent grace of Christ i^ us are two
different things.
nor the Holy Ghost in person; for what reason any has to fancy an union of
the person of Christ or the Holy Ghost in the Saints, the same reason have they
to say that all the three are united to the person of the believer in all
supernatural actions, for the Father is said to draw men to the Son, John
6.44. and Christ to reveal the Father, and to draw men, John 1.18. John 12.32
and the Holy Ghost to reveal the deep things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10, 11. now all
the three in person do these, but all the three persons are not united to
believers in person; this were a mystery greater then God manisted in the
flesh, and unknown to Scripture.

2. If Christ be all the grace of believers, faith in Christ, and the love of
Christ, should be Christ.

3. Then should a believer having a new heart, and a new Spirit, be Christed,
or Godded; and God should be inca^nate in every believer, and how many Christ's
should there be? and the new heart in one Saint, and the grace given to Paul,
should be the new heart given to Peter, whereas God has g^ven grace to every
man, according to his measure, and there are diversity of gifts, but one
Spirit, 2 Pet. 3.15. Phil. 1.9. Ephesians. 3.3.4.5. ^ Cor. 12.3, ^.5.6. Ephesians. 4.16.

Grace and ou^ free^will are said to act together in a fourfold s^nse*
Asser. 5. The Grace of God and our free will in a fourfold sense may be said
to concur in the same works of Grace.

1. When free will receives no more from Grace and the Lords drawing, but only
literal instruction, and if by our industry an habit of the knowledge of the
letter of the word be acquired, its necessary only to the easier believing, as
Pelagius said, I may believe without Preaching the Gospel, Grace is simply
necessary in all supernatural actions.
by Reading, but more easily by fair and powerful preaching, and by grace
helping and assisting preaching, but yet without grace, but with greater
difficulty, as I may go a journey on foot, but more easily on horseback; then
a horse is not simply necessary for the journey; and a ship may sail more
easily and expeditely with sails, yet also without sails with the help of
Oars though with more difficulty; thus Christ and his Grace may be spared, we
may sail to heaven by natures sweating and free-wils industry, though the sails
of grace could more expeditely promove our journey. Golden words and moral
swasion cannot give l^fe.
Now we think not that Christ draws when men speak, but the bare letter of
the Gospel; and softly requests the dead with only sound of words and syllabls
to live, and Orators with golden words do pray and persuade the blind to see,
and the creeples to walk; but its long err words fetch a soul to dry bones
that they may live, or tie the broken eye-strings, or add vital power and
life to eyes and ankle-bones.

2. Grace and free will (as Bellarmaine and the rest of the Jesuits with
Arminians teach) may be thought to be two joint causes, the one not depending
on the other, as two carrying one stone or burden, neither he helps him, nor
he him, Grace and free will are not two collateral, and independent causes in
the same supernatural act, as two men drawing a boat.
but both join their independent strength to one common effect. Bellarmine and
Grevinchovius with the like comparisons do prove that* we may storm heaven, by
the strength of free-w^ll, without dependence on Christ; for three untruths are
here taught: 1. That Grace determines not free will; a saying destructive to
providence; if God determine not all second causes, he is not Master of all
events, nor has he a dominion of providence in all things that fall out, good
and evil: 2. Grace does not begin in all things that concern salvation, nor
does the Lord work in us to will and to do; if we will not do without any
prior dependence on the ^nfluence of the grace of God, we as much work in our
selves willing and doing, as the Lord does, and the Lord in his grace shall
follow, and not lead our will. 3. Grace does not confer any help on the will
to ^ctuate it, and to strengthen it in doing good, in believing, ^epenting,
loving God, hoping, (as Grevinchovius says) but will and grace do both
jointly meet in one and the same effect, in which 4 Free Will divides the
spoil with Christ; and what need we say, worthy is the Lamb who has redeemed
us, if free will in the application of redemption share equally with the Grace
of Christ?

Free Will in supernatural a^tio^s not a mere patient, but an Agent.
3. The third way is that free will is said to believe, repent, love God, by a
mere extrinsecall denomination^, because it carries that grace^ which formally
and only does perform all these supernatural actions; so Grace does all, and
free will is a mere patient that conferreth no vital subordinate and active
influence in these acts; as we say, the Apothecaries glass heals the wound,
because the oil in the glass works the cure; when the glass does actively
contribute nothing to the cure; or the Ass makes rich, when it carries the
gold that enricheth only; this sense Antinomians hold forth, and make us mere
patients, and blocks in the way to heaven, and this sense Jesuits, Martinez de
Ripalda de ente su (...). 1. d^sp. 29. sect. 1. n. 3.4.

Council. (...). sess. 6. c. 5. c. 4.


especially Martinez de Ripald^ falsely charge upon Luther and Calvin; and the
Council of Trent, inspired with the same lying Spirit says the same.

4. The fourth sense is that Grace and free will does work so as Grace is the
principal, first inspiring and fountane cause: 1. It being a new supernatural
disposition and habit in the soul, Joh. 14.23. 1 John 2.27. 1 Ioh. 3.9. Ioh.
4.14. Esai. 44.3.4. Ezech. 36.26.27. Deuteronomy. 30.6. Free Will an agent acting by
the strength of grace in supernatural actions, and not a patient Antinomians
dream.
A good treasure or stock of grace, Matthew. 12.35. Luke 6.45. And also actually
it determines, sweetly enclineth and stirs the will to these acts; yet so
as free will moves actively, freely, and confe^reth a radical, vital, and
subordinate influence and is not a mere patient in all these, as Antinomians
dream, Psalm. 119.32. I will run the way of thy Commandments, when thou shall
enlarge my heart, Ioh. 14.12. he that believes in me, the works that I do, he
shall do, and greater then these, Matthew. 12.50. He that does the will of my
heavenly Father, the same is my brother, etc. 1 Cor. 9.24. So run, that ye
may obtain, Revel. 2.2. I know thy works and thy labor, 1 Thessalonians. 1.3.
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience
of Hope: 1. We are not dead in supernatural works, and mere blocks, Romans 6.11.
We are alive unto God in Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 2.1. He has quickened us, Revel.
2.3. For my names sake thou have labored, and had not fainted, 1 Cor. 15.58.
Be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abundant in the work of the Lord* there
is activity in the Spirit to lust against the flesh, Gal. 5.17. Romans 7.15. Nor
is the blessedness of the Saints only passive in receiving: The blessedn^sse
of the Saints acti^e and not passive only as Antin^mians say.
though to be just^fied and receive Christ's righteousness, be the fountain
blessedness, Psalm. 32.1. Romans 4.6.7. Gal. 3.13. But the Scripture speaks of
a true and solid blessedness in action, Psalm. 119.1. Blessed are the
undefiled in the way, Esai. 56.2. Blessed is the man that does this, Iam. 1.12.
Blessed is the man that endures temptation, Psalm. 119.2. Blessed are they that
keep his testimonies, Psalm. 106.3. Blessed are they that keep judgment, Revel.
22.14. Blessed are they that do his Commandments, Math. 5. Blessed are they
that mourn, that hunger and thirst; Then there must be a part of blessedness
in sanctification, as in justification; though the one be the cause, the other
the effect.

Asser. 6. The Lords working in us the condition of the Covenant of Grace, such
as faith is, by his efficacious grace, does not free us from sin, when we
believe not, nor involve God in the fault, when he works not in us to
believe, as Crispe imagines; D. Crispe Sermon. 6. page 160.
Here let me by the way remove the arguments of Dr Crispe by the which he
imagines, that there is no condition at all in the covenant of grace.

Argum. 1. The Covenant should not be everlasting, if it depended on a
condition of faith to be performed by us; for we fail in our performances
daily, and the Covenant is anulled and broken so soon as the condition is
broken.

Ans. ^. We speak not so, that the Covenant of grace depends on a condition in
us; dependency includes a causality in that of which the thing has de^endency,
we know nothing in us, either faith, or any other thing that is the cause of
the covenant of grace, or of the fulfilling of it: a cause is one thing, a
condition caused by grace is an other thing; for the pe^p^^uity of the covenant
there is not requi^ed a condition always in act. 1. If at the eleven^h or at
the twelf hour, you come to Christ, the nature of this covenant promises you
welc^me. 2. Particular failings and acts of unbeleif, do well consist with the
habit and stock of faith that remains in him that i^ borne (...) God, (...)
is the act so tied to a time. But 3. There is, by ^enuure of ^he Covenant, a
Privilege twofold here. 1. If by the Law a man step a haire-breath wide off
the way, the door of Paradise is bolted on him, and in again can he never
enter, he must seek another entery, the man has done with heaven that way, the
law knows not such a thing as repentance; Comfortable differences between the
Law and the Cov^nant of Grace.
but the Covenant of grace being made with a sinner, a slip, an act of
unbelief does not forfeit the mercy of this covenant. But Christ says, if you
fall, there is place to rise again; if you sin, there is an Advocate, there is
a blood of an eternal covenant; the covenant stands still to make up room for
repeated grace, for a thread, and continued tract of free grace and mercy all
along that your foot never go out of the traces of renewed pardon, while you be
in heaven: though the child of God ought not to sin, yet can he not out-sin
the eternity of the new covenant, nor can he sin an eternal priest out of
heaven. 2. The Law requires a stinted measure of obedience, even to the
superlative, with all the soul, and the whole strength; any less is the
forfeiting of salvation. But the covenant of grace stinteth no weak soul,
Christ racketh not, nor does he (as it were) play the extortioner, and say,
either the strongest faith, or none at all; he makes not Abraham's foot a
measure to every poor sinner; many smoking flaxes, and broken reeds on earth
are now up before the throne; mighty Cedars, high, tall, green, planted on the
banks of the river of life; if Adam be the first in Heaven, what though I be
the last that enter in, though I close the door in the lowest room, so I see
the throne, and him that sits on it, it is enough to me.

2. Arg. All the tie of the covenant lies on God, not any on man, D^ Crispe,
2. arg.
as bond or obligation for the fulfilling of the covenant, or partaking of the
benefits thereof, Heb. 8.10. Ezech. 36.25.26. Jer. 1. the Lord promises to do
all and the new heart is but a consequent of the covenant; where is thee in all
this covenant, one Word that God says to man, Thou must do this? If God had
put man on these conditions, then they were conditions indeed: But when God
takes all upon himself, where are then the conditions on Man's part? Give me
leave; suppose there should be a fault of performing in this covenant: whose
were the fault? must not the fault or failing be in him who is tied and bound
to every thing in the covenant, and says, he will do it? If there be a
condition, and there should be a failing in the condition, he that undertaketh
all things in the covenant must needs be in the fault, -- God says not, make
your selves clean; get you the Law of God in your mind, get you power to walk
in my Statutes, and when you do this, then I will be your God, and enter in
Covenant with you.

Answ. 1. We never teach that the making to our selves a new heart is an
antecedent condition required before the Lord can make the New Covenant with
us, as this m^n would charge Protestant Divines, but that it is a condition
required in the party covenanting; which is conditio federatorum, nonfederis,
and such a condition without which its unpossible they can fulfill the other
condition which is to believe and so lay hold on the Covenant: but it is clear,
Antinomians think the new heart no inherent grace in us, but that Christ is
grace working immediately in us as in stones, and the new heart is
justification, without us in Christ only: let Crispe show where the making of a
new heart is commanded to us as a consequent and an effect of the Covenant;
surely the new heart, the washing of us with clean water, be it an antecedent,
or be it a consequent of the Covenant of Grace, it is a promise that God does
freely and of mere grace undertake to perform in us, Ezech. 36.26. A new heart
will I give you, so Ier. 32.39, 40. Ier. 31.33. E^ech. 11.19.20. Esa. 54.13.
Ioh. 6.45. Ezech. 36.32. Not for your sakes, do I this, says the Lord God, be
it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of
Israel, ver. 22. I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine
holy names sake, which ye have profaned amongst the heathen, whether ye went;
and Crispe says the Covenant in the old Testament had annexed to it diverse
conditions, of legal washing and sacrifices, whereas the New Covenant under
the New Testament is every way of free grace: He is far wide; conditions
wrought in us by grace, such as we assert, take not one jot or title of the
freedom of Grace away, and though there be major gratia a larger measure of
grace under the New Testament, yet there is not magis gratia, Grace in the old
and New Testament the same grace in nature and essence, but different in
degrees.
there is no more of the essence of free grace in the one, then in the other;
for all was free grace to them, as to us; why did the Lord enter in Covenant
with the Jews more then with other Nations? Deuteronomy. 7.7. The Lord loved you
because he loved you. Was Jerusalem, Ezech. 16. holier then the Ephesians, Ephesians.
2. No, their nativity was of the land of Canaan, their Father an Amorite, their
Mother an Hitti^e, Ezech. 16.5. Thou wast cast out in the open field, to the
loathing of thy person, in the day that thou wast borne, ver. 6. And when I
passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said to thee in thy
blood, live* And to cause grace have a deeper impression and sinking down into
the hearts bottom, he repeateth it again, I said unto thee in thy blood,
live; And will Crispe say, that this i^ not a history of free grace, as far
from bribe or hire of merit^ as in the world? or, will he say, it was Gods
meaning, First, wash you with holy water, and sacrifice to me, and perform all
these legal conditions to me while you are Amorites and Hittites by kind, and
that being done, He enter in Covenant with you, when ye have done your work,
He pay your wages, and be your God.

2. This Argument militateth strongly against every Gospel duty, and the whole
course of Sanctification. God must so be the cause and only cause of all our
sinful omissions, and sins under the Covenant of grace, in that he promises
to work in us to will and to do, and to give us grace to abstain from sin, but
does not stand to his word as Antinomians teach, which is an Argument
unanswerable to me, that its the mind of Antinomians that no justified person
can sin, but that they omit good, or commit ill, God is in the fault, not
they; and that the justified are mere blocks in all the course of their
sanctification; in all the sins they do, they are patients; God should more
carefully see to his own honor, and not suffer them to sin; so they and the
old Libertines go on together. For say, that the new heart, that to will and
to do, to persevere steadfastly in the Grace of God, were no conditions of the
Covenant (sure believing in the Lord Jesus is clearly a condition of the
righteousness of faith, as doing is of the righteousness which is of the Law,
Romans 10.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Gal. 4.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28) say that to
repent, pray, love God, and serve him, were not from God through the tie of the
New Covenant, yet Gods promise, his single word when he says he will do such
and such things, is as strong a tie as his Covenant and oath, when he knows
its unpossible these things that he says he will do, can be done, except he,
of his mere grace, work, them in us. Now the Lord clearly promises, that he
will give repentance, Act. 5.31. Sorrow for sin, the Spirit of grace and
supplication, Zach. 12.10. a circumcised heart to love and serve the Lord,
Deuteronomy. 30.6. Ezech. 36.26. perseverance in Grace, Ier. 32.40, 41. Esai. 54.10.
chap. 59.20.21. Psalm. 1.3. Joh. 4.14. chap. 10.28. Phil. 1.6. Ephesians. 5.26.27. 1
Ioh. 2.1. The justified cannot sin, according to the doctrine of Libertines.
Then let D. Crispe or any Libertine say, when the Saints sin, in not
praying, in not sorrowing for sin, in not willing, and doing, in their sins
and falls in their Christian race to heaven, let me speak in the words of
Crisp, whose fault is it, or failing not to perform the word, or promise of God?
God undertaketh by promise, yea by his simple word, to fulfill what he
promises, and says he will work all these in us, yea to will and to do;
Ergo, if it be not done, the fault cannot be man's, but it must be, (which I
abhor to writ or speak) the Lords.

3. God takes all upon himself, in genere causae gratiosae, Liberrimae,
independentis, primae, non obligatae ad agendum ex ullae lege; in the kind of a
cause that works by mere grace, freely, Indepdenently, without any Law above
him to obliege him to do otherwise with his own, then he freely wills,
decrees, promises; for men carnally divide Gods decree, which is most free,
from his promise which is as free as his decree^ but it follows in no sort,
as Arminians and Jesuits object to us; therefore men who do not believe,
pray, walk holily, are not in the fault, being under a Law to obey; for
sinful inability to obey can ransom no man from the obligation of
obedience; and most blasphemous it is, that because, God undertaketh in the
Covenant, that we shall walk in his commandments, as he does promise, Ezech.
36.27. and that we shall fear him, Ier. 32.39.40. That God should therefore be
in the fault, and we free of all fault, when in many particulars we offend all.
Iam. 3.2. and we fear not God, in this or this sin; as is possible and may be
gathered from Joseph's speech to his brethren; who says he would not wrong
them, for he feared God; and Jobs word, God never promised in his Covenant, to
keep the Saints from these particular sins they fall in, nor are these such
sins as break, far less anull the Covenant of grace.
that he durst not despise the cause of his servant, because he was afraid of
God. Yet God promises, that he will keep Joseph, Job and all the elect in the
way of Gods Commandments, that they shall not fully fall away from him: God
never by promise, covenant, oath, or word, undertaketh o keep his elect from
this or this particular breach and act of unbelief, against the Covenant of
grace.

4. The fault against the Gospel or any sin in a believer must justly be
imputed to him, because he is tied by the Evangelick Law not to sin in any
thing, the Gospel grants pardons, but not dispensations in any sins; and it
can in no sort be imputed to God, because if any believer fall in a particula^
sin or act of unbelief against the covenant of grace, the Lord neither
decreed, nor did ever undertake by Covenant or promise to keep him, by his
effectual grace from falling in that sin; for the Lord would then certainly
have kept him, as he did Peter, and does all the Elect that are effectually
called, that in mighty temptations their faith fail them no^. Nor is the act
of believ^ng, that is wanting in that particular fall, such a condition of the
Covenant as Christ either promised to work, Faith is a condition of the
Covenant, but not this ^r that particular act of faith which we ought to
perform, when we misbel^ve God.
or the necessary condition of the Covenant of Grace, or such a condition the
want whereof does annull and make void the eternal Covenant of grace.

5. I here smell in Antinomians, that God must be in fault, as the author of
our unbelief, our stony hearts, our walking in our fleshly ways, because God
has promised to give us faith, and a heart of flesh, to walk in his ways, as
the old Libertines said God was the principal and chief cause of sin, and that
God did all things, both good and ill, the Creatures did nothing. So Calvine in
ins^itut. adversus Libertines, chap. 14. in opus. page 446. Mr. Archer down
right says, God is the author of sin. what end is there of er^ing, if God
leave us? It is true, the tie, and all the tie of giving a new heart, and the
Spirit of grace and supplication lies on the Lord who promised so to do, Deuteronomy.
30.6. Ezech. 11.19.20. chap. ^6.26.27. Ier. 31.33. 34.35.36. But yet so that we
are under the obligation of divine precepts to do our part, Ezech. 18.31. make
you a new heart and a new Spirit for why will ye die, O house of Israel? Ier.
4.4. Circumcise your selves to the Lord, and take away the fore-skinne of your
heart, Ephesians. 4.23. be renewed in the Spirit of your mind, Romans 12.2. Romans
13.14. and 1 Thessal. 5.17. pray without ceasing, Psalm. 50.15. Call upon me.
Matthew. 26.41. Watch and pray: Therefore all the tie and obligation of what ever
k^nd cannot so free us from sinful omissions, nor can the tie ly on God;
evangelick commandments are accompanied with grace to obey and grace lays a
tie on us also to yield obedience. The Covenant of grace is ^ot formally the
love of God but flows from the love of God.


6. Its a foul and ignorant mistake in Crispe to make the Covenant nothing but
that love of God to man, which he cast on man before the Children had done
good or evil, Romans 9.1. That love is eternal and has no respect to faith as
to a condition, but its not the covenant it self, because it is the cause of
the covenant. 2. To the love of election, there is no love, no work, no act of
believing required on our part; Yea, no mediator, no shedding of blood; we are
loved with an everlasting love, before all these; but the covenant though as
decreed of God, it be everlasting, (as all the works of creation and divine
providence which fall out in time, The love of God is prior to our faith, to
redemption, to a M^di^ or, o^ shedding of blood.
and have beginning and end are so everlasting, for God decreed from eternity
that they should be) yet it is not in being formally while it be preached to
Adam after his fall, and there is required faith on all the Saints part, to lay
hold on the Covenant, Esai. 56.4. and to make it a covenant of peace to the
Saints in particular. 2. Faith is the condition of the covenant. 3. Christ the
mediator of it. 4. Christ's blood the seal of it. 5. The Spirit must write it in
our heart: But the love of election is a complete free, full love, before our
faith, or shedding of blood, or a mediator be at all.

Object. We are not saved, nor justified, nor taken in Covenant by faith, as a
work, (says Crispe for then we should not be saved by grace; and grace should
not be grace; but we are justified by faith, that is, by that Christ which
faith knows, according to that, by his knowledge shall my righteous servant
justify many; therefore faith is no condition of this covenant.

Answ. The contrary rather follows: 1. Seeing Crisp: does say, none under
heaven can be saved till they have believed; We are not taken in covenant by
faith; neither we nor scripture speak so; taking us in covenant is before we
can believe, but we lay hold on Christ, and righteousness by faith, not as a
work, but a necessary condition required of us. 2. I leave it to the
consideration of the Godly; if believing in him who just^fieth the ungodl^ be
no condition; (a work justifying, I do not think it) but only I believe and
know that Christ justified me before I believed, from eternity, as some say;
when I was conceived in the womb, ^s Crispe says; and that the threatening, he
that believes not, i^ condemned already, To believe is not to (...) was
justif^ed, e^e ^ver I believed.
carries this sense, he that believes not that he is not condem^^d, he is
already condemned: Who can believe such toys?

2. Believing is a receiving of Christ, Ioh. (...) Christ's dwelling in the
heart Ephesians. 3.17. Then to (...), must be to know that Christ was in me,
before I believed, and tha^ I received him from eternity, or from my conception.

3. To believe makes me a son borne, not of flesh and blood, Ioh. 1.12.13.
and Gal. 3.26. and by faith we receive the Spirit: This then must be nothing
else but I know by the light of faith, I was a son before, and had received
the Spirit, before I believed: What more absurd?

4. And by faith I live not, Christ lives in me, and I am crucified and
mortified; that is, by faith I know that I did live the life of God, and was
crucified to the world; whereas I was dead in sins, before I believed.

5. And because believing is somewhat more then a naked act of the mind, it
being a fiduciall adherence unto, and an affiance, acquiescence, and
heart-relyance, and staying on Christ, or a rolling of our selves on God for
salvation, as is clear in the original holy languages of scripture, Psalm.
18.18. Esai. 26.3. Psalm. 112.8. Esai. 10.21. Mich. 3.11. Psalm. 22, 8. Psalm.
55.22. 1 Pet. 5.7. Cant. 8.5. Ioh. 1.12. Its too hungry a notion of faith, to
make it nothing but a knowing of that which really was before; for
heart-adherence is not an act of the mind, and so not an act of knowledge, but
of the will and affection, in which there is no act of knowledge formally,
though it presuppose an act of knowledge.

6. Then wicked men must be in their sins, not justified in his blood,
because they will not know that Christ dyed for them in particular, and that
Christ bore their sins on the cross, and justified and pardoned them long
ago, all which to believe is to hold a lie in the right hand. But to return.

Asser. 7. How the Lord works in us to will and to do, the power and the act,
and yet we are guilty in our omissions of good, or in our sinful and remiss
manner of working with the grace of God, is a point more mysterious, then I
dare undertake to explain, if these may give light, I offer them to the Reader.

Grace changes both the principles, the action and the State.
Posit. 1. Grace, free grace, is the great and Master-wheele, that carries
about heart, senses, foot, and hand, and not that only, but seed and tree and
fruit, the flower, the principle depends necessarily on free grace; and for a
third, the state and condition is higher then either principle or seed, or
fruit; to be an heir of glory, is more then a supernatural principle of gift,
and more then one single action above nature: Grace must make the principle
gracious, and grace must inact and quicken the principle to bring forth, and
graces policy makes natural men, citizens of heaven, sons of God, heirs of
life, Ioh. 1.12.13. Gal. 4.4.5.

Positi. 2. This must stand as a ground, that there is not any gracious act
performed by the members, The head of grace acts in all the members, and
moves their natural faculties.
but the head Christ, is so interessed in it, that as even the finger and toe,
in the natural body, cannot stir without the motion takes its beginning from
life, and head, so neither can the mystical body or any joint or member of it,
act or move in its supernatural or be of grace, but every individual act of
grace must pay the rent of glory, to the mystical head, whose predeterminating
influence does act and stir the ship; for Christ is not only the compass,
and Day Star, according to which spiritual motions are directed, and hand
and finger, foot, and all see with the visive power seated in the head, (for
they have no faculty of seeing in themselves) and the Saints in these actions
stir with the light, in the two eyes, or seven eyes and lamps that are in the
head Christ, but also the real motions of grace in their physical, as well as
in their moral sphere are shapen and acted by Christ* It is not much, (though
it be a wonder) that a huge great ship made up of so many pieces of dry and
dead timber can move regularly through so many circles, compasses, turnings of
many coasts, countries, change of winds, ten thousand miles, to a certain
herbrie, when timber is acted and moved with the borrowed art and reason of a
man stirring the helm; so there is a (...), a reason, a wisdom in him, who is
made our wisdom, to act the Saints in their heavenward motion, that are
carried through so many sea-circles, turnings, contrary winds of temptations,
afflictions, various soule-dispensations of sweet and sour, absence, presence,
going and coming again, of Christ, to such a determinate home as heaven, for
the Father must thank the stires-man Christ, his son, that the broken bark
and all his poor friends are landed, with the borrowed art of Christ, and no
more thanks and praise to us, The actual influence of grace, is most
necessary to every act above nature.
then to dead timber. That we should be (...) to the praise of his glory, Ep.
1.12. as if our passive being (it is a borrowed expression, for we are coagents
with, and under Christ, in the work) were destinated to the praise of the glory
of his grace; but we are so drawn as Christ is great Lord, moderator, and
author, and God in the second and new world of grace, as God creator is in all
actions of nature, Ioh. 15.5. without me, (as your vine tree, in whom you
grow, and a stock in whom you bring forth fruit, every blossom of of life,
every apple) ye can do nothing, Phil. 2.13. For it is God that works in you
to will and to do, according to his good pleasure, 2 Cor. 13.3. Since ye seek
a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you ward is not weak, but is mighty
in you; then every word that Paul spoke, Christ in him spoke it not formally,
as if Paul had been a m^er patient, but efficaciously, Romans 15.18. for I will
not dare to speak of any of these things which Christ has not wroughtly me, to
make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed, Esa. 27.3. I the Lord do keep
(the Church the garden of red wine) I will water it every moment, lest any hurt
it, I will keep it night and day; keeping and watering every moment, is grace
actual every moment to make his tender Vines grow, and preserving his own from
succumbring under every temptation.

2. There were no ground for Adams thankfulness and praise, that he stood one
moment, or that he gave names to every thing according to their nature, or ever
heard with patience the command of God, thou shall not eat, if in every act of
obedience, he had not need of the actual predeterminating influence of God,
nor were there ground for this prayer in faith, and in patient submission to
God, as to one to whom we owe the praises of the not failing of our faith, Lead
us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil, nor were there 3 any glory
due to Christ's advocation and intercession, that we fall not fully* and finally
off Christ and from Christ; and the state of Grace, when we are tempted, if
free will, not the actual influence of predeterminating grace did keep the
Saints, and stir them to every act.

3. Who is the Author and finisher of our faith? Christ; and who perfecteth the
good work once begun, but Christ? and who but he brings many children to
glory? Not we, when Christ only, not a creature, Man or Angel can calm a
s^ule-feaver of desertion.
love so curious and rare a work of Christ, that let all the Angels in heaven
Seraphims, and Dominions, and Thrones set their shoulders and strength
together, they cannot with Angell-tongues, (let them speak heaven, and Christ,
and glory) calm a soul-feaver, and words of silk, and oil dropped from the
clouds, cannot command the love-sicknesse of a sad soul. Will ye look to
heaven, while your sight fail, and weep out two eyes while Christ's time come,
you cannot find ease for a broken spirit; when Christ breaks, can Angels make
whole? The conscience is a hell-feaver, the comforter is gone; can you wi^h a
nodde bring the physician back again? can golden words charm and calm a
fever of hell? can you with all the love-waters on earth quench a coal of
fire that came from heaven? Send up to heaven a Mandate against the decree and
dispensation of God, if you can; if the gates of death can open to thee; or if
thou have se^ne the doors of the shadow of death; or can do such great works
of creation, as to lay the cornerstone of the earth, or hang the world on
nothing, which Job could not do, chap. 37. chap. 38. But who can command
soule-furies? only only Christ.

The soul is down amongst the dead, wandering from one grave to another. Can
you make a dead Spirit, a Gospel-harp to play on of the springs of Zion, the
songs of the holy Ghost? Christ can do it. Can you cry, and find obedience to
your call, O North, O South wind blow upon the Garden? Christ has his own
wind at command; he is master of his own mercies: Can you prophecy to the
wind to come, and breathe on dead bones? Christ only can: Can you breathe
life, soul, and five senses on a coffin? could you make way for breathing in
the narrow and deep grave, when clods of clay closes the passage of the
nostrils? Christ can; Isai. 26.19. Thy dead men shall live, together with my
body they shall arise* awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust, for thy dew is as
the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. Can you draw the
virgins after the strong and delitio^s smell of the ointments of Christ? but if
he draw, the virgings ^unne after his love, Cant. 1.3. Christ indictes war,
are you a creator to make peace? he cries Hell, and wrath; can you speak joy,
and consolation? are you an anti-creator, to undo what Christ does? Christ
commands fury against a people, or person; can men, The Lords denial of
grace falls under a threefold consideration.
can angels, can heaven countermand?

Position. 3. The Lords suspending of his grace comes under a twofold
consideration. 1. As the Lord denies it to his own children. 2. As to wicked
men also. As he witholdeth grace, especially actual and predeterminating: It
falls under a threefold respect; 1. As it is a work of the free and good
pleasure and Sovereignty of God.

2. As it is a punishment of former sins.

3. As from it resulteth our sin, even as the night has its being from the
absence of the Sun; Death from the removal of life.

4. The Lords denial of Grace, is seen most eminently in two cases: Asser.
1. In the parting asunder of the two decrees of election and reprobation.

2. In Gods, with drawing of himself and his assistance, in the case of ^^ying
the Saints.

In the former the Lord has put forth his soveraigntie in his two excellentest
creatures: Angels and men; if we make any cause in the free will of Angels: I
speak of a separating and discriminating cause, The freedom of grace evidenced
highly in Ang^ls.
wh^ some Angels did stand, and never sin, some fall, and become devils, we
must deny freedom of Gods grace in the predestination of Angels: now the
Scripture calls them Elect Angels; how then came it that they fell not? from
fre-will? No; Angels are made of God, and for God, and to God; then by the
Apostles reason, they could not give first to God, to engage the Almighty to a
recompense, they could not first set their free will to work their own
standing in Court, before God did with his grace separate them from Angels that
fell, Romans 11.36. Esai. 40.13. 2. Make an election of Angels, as the Scripture
does, when some are called Elect Angels, and some not, then it must be an
Election of grace; an election of works it cannot be; because Angels must glory
in the Lord* that they stand, when others fell, Rom 4.2. as men do Proverb.
16.4. Ier. 9.23.24. 2 Cor. 10.17. Romans 11.^6. for no creature, Angels or Men,
can glory in his sight; for Angels are for him, and of him, as their last end,
and first Author, Romans 11.36. then they gave not first to God, to engage the
Lord in their debt, vesr. 35. for if so, then glory should be to the Angels:
but now upon this ground, that none can engage the Lord in their debt, Paul,
vesr. 36 says to him be glory for ever; because none can give to him first,
and all are for him, and of him; then so are Angels.

3. Angels are associated in the Element and orb of free grace to move as men,
with graces wings, to fly over the Lake prepared for the devil and his Angels,
whereas others fell in; otherwise Christ the Lord Treasurer of free grace,
cannot be the head of Angels, Col. 2.9. as of men, Col. 1.8. Ephesians. 1.20.21.22
23. for as art, not nature, can prevent a dangerous fever, by drawing blood,
or some other way, even as the same art can recover a sick man out of a fever,
whereas another sick of that same disease, yet wanting the help of art, dies:
So the same free grace in nature, speece, and kind, not free will, hinde^^^
the elected Angels to fall, where as by constitution of na^u^e and mutabilitie,
being descended of that first common po^r (...) ^ase house, the first spring of
all the creation of God, mere and simple Nothing, the mother of change and of
all defects natural, and moral, in every the most excellent creature; they
were as an humorous gross body, in which the vessels are full and in a
nearest propension to the same fever that devils fell into, even to the ill of
the second death, if the grace of God had not prevented them.

2. In men, God has declared the deep Sovereignty and dominion of free grace in
calling effectually one man, Iaakob, not Esau, Peter, not Judas, in having
mercy, in time, on whom he will, and hardening whom he will; I humbly provoke
all Arminians, all Libertines who dash themselves, the contrary way against the
same stone, to show a reason why one obeys and actively joyneth with the
draught and pull of the right arm of Jesus Christ, Ioh. 12.32. and his father,
The freedom of grace is evidenced in the conversion of one man, not of another.
Ioh. 6.44. and another refuses, and actively and wilfully withdraws from
the call of God, if the omnipotency of never enough praised grace, be not the
cause, the adequate, highest, and principal cause; I deny not but corrupt and
rebellious will is the inferior, culpable, and only culpable and moral cause
why Judas denies obedience to the holy call of Christ.

It is a sweet contemplation that Angels and Men sing the same song and Psalm
of free grace in heaven, to the Lamb, to him that sits on the Throne; and a
question it is, if a more engaging and obliging way to free grace could be
devised, then that as many as are in the glorified Troops and triumphing armies
in heaven clothed in white, should be also the sworn subjects, and the
eternal debtors of the freest grace of him, who is the high Lord Redeemer, and
head of Angels and Men.

But in the engagement it self of the wind of the Spirit, for the trial of
the Saints there is great ground of admiration, as 1. the blowing of the soft
and pleasant breathings of the South-winde of free grace lying under the only
work of sovereignty, when, and where, and in the measure, the Lord pleases* is
a high and deep expression of the freedom of grace, for in one and the same
prayer (the like by proportion may be said of the acts of faith, love,
patience, hope) we often begin to pray, with sad and fleshly complaints of
unbelief, as is evident in many Psalms and Prayers of the Saints in Scripture,
Jeremy, Lament. 3. of Job, of David; yet going on, the breathings of the holy
Ghost will fill the sails, and he returns: therefore this, is a ground, yea,
a demonstration to me; then when I find no motion of the holy Ghost, We are
to pray and (...) our s^lv^s to supernatural du^i^s when we are ^ndisposed.
no spiritual disposition, but mere deadness, I am not to abstain from
praying, because I find the Spirit not acting nor stirring in me, as
Antinomians say; but 1. I am to act and do, though the principle of motion be
natural; as if the first stroke on flint make not fire, we are to strike
again and again: and if the fire blowing of the bellows kindle not the sticks
let us be doing, and the Lord will be with us. A kindling and a flame may come
from heaven; say that the Lord were wanting to me in a dead and low ebb; he
will not once roll about the sight of his eye, nor let out one blast or
stirring of air and wind of the Spirit toward me; yet my deadness is my sin,
and freeth not me from an obligation to pray and to seek to God; the door is
fast bolted, shall I not therefore knock? access is denied, and the Lord in
ang^r shuteth out my prayer, Lam. 3.8. May not I look and sigh and groan
toward his holy Temple? deadness is not the Lords revealed will forbidding me
to pray, because I am dead and indisposed.

2. Deadness and indisposition is a sin, then must we confess to God, and
tell the Lord when we are indisposed to pray, that we cannot pray; and let the
dead and the blind but bow his knee and lay a dead Spirit, and naked wretched
soul, a pair of blind eyes before God: for we are commanded to confess this
to God, We are oblieg^d to pray, when under ^ndisposition (...).
as may be gathered from, Revel, 3.17. 1 John 1.9. Prove. 28.13. Psalm. 32.5.

3. We are expressly commanded in the day of trouble and of our temptation to
pray, and seek help from God under our temptations, Psalm. 50.15. Matthew. 6.13. 1 Thessalonians. 5.17. As the Saints have done, Psalm. 18.6. Psalm. 34.6. Psalm. 61.2. 2
Cor. 12 ver. 7.8.9. If then we judge the no breathing of the holy Ghost a
temptation, and a cause of humiliation, as it is, and the Saints do judge it,
then are we to pray though most indisposed; why does David complain that he was
as a bottle in the smoke, and pray so often that God would quicken him, if
under a dead disposition we were not to pray?

4. If often the Saints beginning to pray, do speak words of unbelief and
from a principle of nature, and if words flowing from the deadness and
misgivings and rovings of the flesh interwoven in with the spiritual and
heavenly ravishments of the Spirit of grace and supplication in one and the
same complaint and prayer to God, as Psalm. 38. Psalm. 102. Psalm. 77. Psalm. 88.
Lament. 3. Ier. 20. Flesh and spirit in their several ups and downs in one
and the same prayer.
Job 8. chapter 16. chapter 19. and in many other passages, where the Spirit and the
flesh have Dialogues and Speeches by turns, and by course, then may and ought
the Saints to pray under deadness, and do as much as their present
indisposition can permit them, and the Spirit is seen to come and blow, not by
obligation of Covenant or promise, on Gods part, as Jesuits and Arminians with
Pelagians have taught, but in his ordinary free practices of grace as Philip
was commanded to come and preach Christ to the Eunuch while he was reading the
Book of the Prophet Esaias, not because he was reading Scripture, or because such
a promise is made to these who read Scripture, as the Angels revealed the glad
tidings of the birth of Christ, while the shepherds were attending their
flocks in the field, not because they were so doing, as if a promise of the
Gospel b^longed to men because they wait one their calling; and Annanias is
sent to preach Christ to Saul and open his eyes, while he was praying, not
because he was praying, but of mere free grace, which moves in this ord^nary
current and sphere of free love cong^uously to the Lords freely intended end to
save his people; even as the Lord joyneth his influence and blessing to give
bread and a Harvest to the sower, Esaias 55. yet not that he has tied himself by
promise to give a good Harvest to every industrious husbandman; yet this
ordinary practice of Grace with the Commandment of God is enough to set us on
work to pray, to believe, to acts of love to Christ, in the saddest and deadest
times.

5. It should be no sinful omission in us, not to pray when the Spirit
stirs us not, if our deadness should free us from all sin, because we
cannot run, when the Bridegroom does not draw. Christ's drawing goes along
with the secret decree of Election, but is not to us a signification of the
Lords revealed will, that we should not follow Christ, when he suspendeth the
influence of his drawing power.

6. Now as in nature, men may so dare the Almighty in his face, Assert. 1.
that God in ju^tice may deny his influence to natural In what cas^s God uses
to (...) are his influence.
that the Lord refuses to concur with the oil in Iereboams whithered a^m,
that he cannot pull it in again to him. 2. When the Lord is put to a contest
with false god's to work a miracle, as in his refusing to concur with the
fire in burning the three children; for in all causes natural, or moral, or
whatever they be, God has a negative voice and more. 3. When the axe or the saw
boasts it self against him that lifted it; the Lord may use his liberty. So
(to come to the second consideration) when Peter proudly trusts in himself:
I will dye with thee ere I deny thee; the Lord to punish his pride, must deny
his assisting grace, when Peter is tempred, that he may know that nature is a
s^rry undertaker; that the man rides to heaven on a whithered reed, who aymeth
to climb that up-hill-city one his own fles^y and clay, strength; and God to
show a black spot on a fair face in heaven, will have it said, there stands
David before the Throne, who once committed adult^ry and to cover the shame of
it from men, killed most treacherously an innocent godly man: God here out of
the ashes of our sin will have a rose of free grace, that fills the four
corners of heaven with its smell, to grow green up in the higher Paradise, for
a summer of eternity; and will have no Tenants in heaven but the freeholders
of grace; it is a question w^ith^r there be more grace or more glory in heaven;
for the crown of glory is a crown of grace* We are to stir up grace in
ourselves and ^low the m^.
that va^ie sea of the redemption of grace issued from under our s^nfull falls.

7. Yea, upon this reasonlesse and fleshly ground, if we may omit pray^ng, and
so believing, loving, repenting, mortifying our lusts, when the Spirit stirs
us not to these acts, and say, if God will suffer me to sin, let him see to
it, then upon the same ground all the justified Saints (I should think them
Devils, not Saints) might sin, mu^ther, blaspheme, whore, oppress, commit
Sodomy, Incest as Lot, deny Jesus Christ, as Peter did, and say as w^ are not
to pray, nor obliged to a constant course in prayer, when Christ draws not,
and when the Spirit moves us not (as Antimonians say (with Mr Crispe and
others) error, 49. page 9.10. Rise, Reign) so neither are we to abstain from
murder, denying of Christ, blasphemy, Sodomy, when the spirit of Christ
draws us not, and moves and stirs not our soul to abstinency and a holy
fear and circumspection that we commit not such abominations, and Peter might
say, I am not obliged to a constant course of confessing Christ before men,
unless the Spirit stir me thereunto, and David or any Saint might say, If
the Lord will suffer me to murder the innocent, let him see to it; for the
Lords drawing and the Spirits st^^^ing is as necessary in a holy eschewing of
sins ^f commission, as in sins of omission; and by as great, and an every way
equal necessity, if the Lord withdraw himself and the Spirit stir not, we
must f^ll^n such abominations, when tempted by Satan and the flesh, as in the
sins of sinful omitting of praying, praising, believing, when the Spirit
stirs us not thereunto; but the truth is, this necessity can neith^r lay the
blame on the holy and spotless dispensation of God, nor free us from
guiltiness, because between Gods withdrawing influence, and the sin, there
does interveen an obliging Law that forbids sin, and our free-w^ll and reason
acting the sin freely. But we are commanded, 2 Timothy 1.6. To stir up the grace
of God in us, (...) its on allusion to the Priests, who were to keep in the
fire that came from heaven; grace is resembled to fire under ashes, which with
blowing of bellows is made to revive and burn again; it is the Prophets
complaint. Esa. 64.^. There is none that calls upon thy name, or stirs up
himself to lay hold on thee; the habit of grace may be warmed, ^lown upon, and
kindled, that as fire makes fire, so grace may put forth it self, in acts of
grace; and the seed of God, in the Saints, 1 John 2.9. may bring forth births
like it self; motion here produces heat.

Object. But the actual predetermination of grace is not in your hand; and
without this, acts of praying and believing, are unpossible to me.

Answ. If this were a sufficient reason, then all works of nature, whatever the
creature does were unpossible; for the plowman should not go to till, sow,
and reap, because, without the blessing of the common and natural influence
of the first cause he could do none of these things.

2. Because the Saints know not the counsel and mind of God in his decree of
joining of his supernatural influence, or his suspending of the same, to this
or this act of praying, believing, hoping, loving of Christ, etc. Therefore
upon all occasions, the Saints, what ever be their present deadness and
indisposition, are to pray, believe, and to stir up themselves to lay hold on
God. 1. Because as in natural and moral actions, men are not to neglect
plowing, earing, journeying, eating, drinking, sleeping, buying, and selling,
upon this ground because they are ignorant, whether in the work, the Lord shall
be pleased to join his influence, as the first cause without whom all
inferior causes can do nothing: So are not the Saints to neglect to pray,
because they are dead and indisposed, upon the ground of their doubting and not
knowing whether the Lord of grace will be pleased to add his actual
assistance of grace, to work in them to will, and to do; for the Lord may be
pleased to add his supernatural influence in a moment, his wind blows when
it lists, his grace moves swiftly, when, and where he pleases: our good
disposition is neither rule, condition, work, nor hire to move him to work.

2. It is all one, as if we wilfully neglected to pray, and resisted the
predeterminating grace of God, when we know not whether the Lord shall deny
his influence or no; Yet we disobey the Lord commanding and so obliging us to
pray; for as if we had his influence at our elbow, attending us, so we are to
pray, and set to work: yea, our voluntary refusing to pray, How o^r ^ot
praying, and sinful omissions are w^llfull sins, even though we be
indisposed and not Masters of the Lords predeterminating grace.
we only conjecturing evil of God, and of his free grace, without ground,
must come from sinful wickedness, not from impotency and weakness; for who
told you that Christ would be wanting in his influence? You knew it not from
any word of God; and shall you fancy a jealousy against Christ's love, without
any warrant? even as a servant commanded to lift a burden, upon a
sluggishnesse should say, It came thither in a Cart and two horses when he
would never move an arm to take a trial what he could do, though the burden
were above his strength, when he will not do as much as he can, his
disobedience is wilful: Therefore we may say, if we speak of a voluntary,
wilful and groundless forsaking of God, in order of time, we first fors^ke
God ere he desert us; but in order of nature, God first forsakes us, that is,
How we leave God ^re he leave us, and God leaves us first also.
he withdraws his heavenly influence from us, but so as before and after the
act of withdrawing, we are willing that God should withdraw, and be gone; for
we love in all the acts of sinning to have a world of our own.

3. We are to believe in the general, we being within the covenant, the Lord
will keep his promise, Deuteronomy. ^0.6. How we are to believe the Lord will join his
influence of actual grace for our perseve^ance.
And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed, to
love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul that thou
may live, Ezech. 11.19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new
Spirit within you, -- 20. that they may walk in my Statutes, Ezech. 36.27.
then are we so to set to these duties of wa^king in the Lords way, as we are
to believe he will nor deny actual grace, necessary for our perseverance,
because it is his express promise, Ier. 31.33.34.35.36. Ier. 32.39.^0. Esai.
59.19 20 21. Esai. 54 10.11. Ezech. 36.26.27. 1 Ioh, 2.1.2. Matthew. 16.18. Luke
2^.3^.32. though in acts not fundamental, and simply n^cessary for our being
in the state of grace, the Lord has reserved a latitude of independent
Sov^raigntie to act the soul in these and these particular a^ts, as seems
good to him, that every new breathing of the Spirit of jesus, may be a new
debt, and obligation of free grace* to Christ.

We are absolutely to p^ay for the breathings of Christ's Spirit, to go a^ong
wi^h us, in all the particular acts of a gracious and spiritual walking* but
we know the Lords absolute good pleasure is his rule he walks by: so here our
desires may be absolute in seeking, where the Lord gives upon condition of ^is
own good will; nor are our desi^es in prayer to be conformable to Gods
decree, or free pleasure, but to his revealed will.

Grace is the culours of the inhabitants and citiz^ns of the house of the lower
and higher rooms of the new Jerusalem; all the way, and all the home the
Sain^s walk in this white; Christ keeps not his Spouse in a close chamber, it
is not one great act of free grace only, when all were in one day redeemed on
the cross, but daily Christ wears his Church as a bracelet about his neck,
as a seal on his heart, as his Royal diadem, Christ cannot be weary of b^ing
gracious
and a crown of glory on his ^ead, as his love-ring on his hand; this day
grace, to morrow new and fresh supply of grace: the next hour grace; he has
strowed all the way to heaven with new grace* every day new wine, new Spiknard
new pe^fume, new ointments.

When will Christ grow old, and gray-haired? Never: Will his heart ev^r grow
cold of love? No: Will he tire of love? will he wear out of delight in the
Spouse that lies for eternity between his breasts? No, no: The love of christ
is always green^, as young-like, as fair, and white today, as from eternity;
Grace a^ immo^tal sparkle and ray of God.
this rose is not altered a whit. Who knows how grace and love in Christ's
breast solaced themselves in these infinite revolutions of ages, before the
creation: how Christ's heart was cheering it self, and rejoicing to have the
first day of the creation dawning, that he might enjoy the love of the sons
of men, not then created, Proverb. 8.3^.31. as if grace and love had thought
long to find a channel with wide banks to flow in; as if Christ having
infinite love within him, in that long, long age (to borrow that expression)
should say, when shall time begin? and sinful men and my mystical body, and
desired spouse my Church, have being in the world, that I may out that grace on
her? I have love within me, and lying beside me; I rejoice to have a lover: as
if grace in Christ, h^d been in too na^row banks, in the in^^nite acts of the
infinite mind of God and the heart of Christ, and longed to have Men and
Angels to give a vent to his love.

And that long avum, the ages that were before the world was, brought it green
to us, that long, long endless and vast duration, when time shall be no more,
cannot make Christ's love change the color, or grow less, or root one Saint
out of his heart; When God leaves off to be God, ^r^ce will leave off to be
Grace: Make Christ repent of Grace, if you can; as Christ has washen his
Spouse, and in regard of the guilt of sin, has made her all fair and spotless;
so does he daily lick and purge, and cleanse her, in regard of the inherent
b^ot, while she be fair as the Sun, and all a new heaven.

Asser. 7. In the third consideration, from this suspension of divine influence
comes our sin, as a necessary consequent and result; yet so as the Lords
suspension, and our transgression fall both in the bosom of divine providence:
The Lord knows why be withdraws his grace, that we might know how weighty a
thing great heaven is laid upon our poor shoulders, and that we would make
foul wo^k out of all we have received, and the flock the second Adam has
given is, if we had not Christ to stir the ship, to lead the minors to
heaven, to keep the inheritance to the little heirs of Christ, should evanish
to nothing.

Po^tion 9. If we consider the Lords denial of Christ, from wicked men; they
c^nnot turn to God, Wicked men's impot^ncy to com^ to Ch^^st essentially
wilful.
but that impotency lay in the womb of will; it is not weakness only, but
also wilfulness, Matthew. 23. verse 37. I would have gathered you, (says
Christ) ye would not, Ioh. 5.6. Christ says to the sick man, will thou be
made whole? Then there was a stop in his will, as well as in his weakness, er.
44.16. As for the word that thou have spoken to us, in the Name of the Lord, we
will not hea^ken to thee.

2. Love and delight to do ill, is from the strength and marrow of the will,
not from weakness only; the servant that would not leave his master, because he
loved him; is a slave for ever, through love to slavery, rather then through
impotency to be free? In those that d^light to do e^il, Will has a strong
influence in the evil they do: every sinner esteems his prison of hell, a
heaven; hi^ fetters of sin on his legs, as a gold chain about his neck.

3. It is a journey of a hundredth miles to Christ, it is unpossible to the
natural man to compass it, Natural men do not obtain Christ, as they can
do.
yet he may walk two of these hundredth miles, though not as a part of the way;
he will not so much as cast a sad look after Christ, the will not bestow one
sigh after Christ, nor know his own weakness, nor d^spair of his own hability,
nor lie at the waterside, and c^y, Lord Jesus come carry me over; he
positively hates Christ; were it possible that the unrenewed man had the two
eyes of a renewed man, to see the beauty and high excellen^y of Jesus, though
he had still his own lame legs, he would weep out his eyes for a Chariot to
carry him to Christ, If natural men should see, they would be much affect^d
with Christ.
he would send sad love-challenges, after Christ; could these that' are
scortched in hellfire and hear the howling of their fellow prisoners, and see
the ugly Devils, the bloody Scorpions with which Satan lasheth miserable
souls, and the huge, deep, broad furnace of eternal vengence, have but a
window opened to see heaven, the ^horne, the tree of life, the glory of the
Troops clothed in white, and hear the music of these that praise him that
sits on the the Throne, or say but one of the apples of the tree of life
were sent down to Hell, and that the damned had senses to taste and smell a
grain weight of the glory that is in it, what thoughts would they have of
Christ and heaven? It is like they would hate themselves, and send up sad
wishes at least, for the continuance of that sight. O could but natural men
see Christ with his own light, it may be they would make out for him: but when
all is said of this subject, the grace of God is a desirable thing, better have
Chris^'s heart and love and soul toward you, then what else your thoughts
could imagine above or below heaven.

If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to me.

Articl. 5. I come now to the fifth Article, the condition of Christ's drawing,
(...); If I be lifted up from the Earth; The condition of Chr^sts drawing.
this particle (...) ( if) is not as in other places, a note of doubting or of
a thing of a contingent and uncertain event; Yea, it signifies here that
Christ was not on any deliberation; Shall I die, or shall I not die, for lost
man? Christ is not wavering, dubious and uncertain in his love; love in Christ
is more f^xed and resolved upon, then the Covenant of night and day, and the
standing of mountains and hills, Ier. 31.35. Esai. 54.10. in other places of
Scripture, it is not a matter of debate; as ^oh. 14.3. If I go away (...).
Christ made no qu^stion whither he would go to his father, 1 Ioh. 2.^. (...),
if any man sin, we have an Advocate; there is no doubt but the Saints sin,
and if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in
us, 1 Ioh. 1.8.

To be lifted up from the earth, is expounded to be crucified, v. 33. this is
Christ's Metaphrase of the kind of death which he suffered.

Crucifying was a cursed shameful and base death, Deuteronomy. 21* 23. yet Christ
exp^esseth it by a word of exaltation, Phil. 2.9. lifting up from the earth:
Christ's death is life, his shame glory; there be pearls and sa^hirs of heaven
in Christ's hell; and christ keeps warm b^eath of life and hot blood in the
cold grave; when he is in an agony, which materially was hell, a glorious
Angel of Heaven is in that hell with him to comfo^t him; when h^ i^ born a
poor man on earth, and lies in a horses manger, there ^s a new bon fire in
Heaven for joy that a great Prince is born, a new star appears; the
weakness of Christ is stronger then men. The blackness of Christ's marred
visage is fa^re; in Christ's poverty, when he has not to pay Tribute to the
Emperor Caesar, the Sea pays Tribute to the King and Prince of Kings, Jesus;
a (...) yields him a piece of moeny; the lowest and basest rep^o^ches of
Christ, his Cross and suffering^ drops the honey* the sweet smell of heaven;
Christ's thorn is a rose, his sadness joy; O what most immediate rays of
glory that comes from his face be? the very second ^able of Heaven must be
exceeding fatness, the back pa^ts of the glorious King that sits on the
Throne must be desirable; the fragments and the broken meat of the Lords higher
Table must be incompa^ably dainty: all the earth to these are husks; the
reproaches of Christ must be not so sower as they are reported of. 2. He makes
it the cause of Christ's drawing all m^n to him. 1. The Holy Ghost will express
the cursed and shameful death of Christ, by a word of glory to be lifted up.

1. The dying of Christ is a leaving of the earth.

2. It is a ma^ter of exaltation that Christ was thus abased; Of these two only
in this place in the New Testament, and Ioh. 3.15. is Christ's dying so
expressed; It is considerable that in this manner of death, Christ will hold
forth to us, that the dying of Christ i^ in a specia^l manner a leaving of the
earth; so Ezechiah, Es^i. 37.11. Christ's dying, a leaving o^ the earth.
I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world, that is, I must
leave the earth, and see the Sun no more; and Christ, Ioh. 13.1. Jesus knew
that his hour was come, and that he should depart out of this world into the
Father; Hence his own word to the repenting ^heife, Luke 23.43. To day thou
shall be with me in Paradise, Ioh. 8.21. I go my way, and ye shall seek me,
and shall die in your ^^nnes: whither I go ye cannot come.

Doct. Christ choosed a kind of death which was a visible leaving of the
earth, and a going to ^eaven ere he came down again off the Cross; for that
day his soul was in Paradise; as the Serpent was lifted up in the wilderness,
Ioh. 3.15. Christ's motion in death is from the earth; Christ was tired of the
earth, and had his fill of it, he desired no more of it. It is not a place much
to be loved by you, Saints for your dear Savior had but few and sad days
on the earth, he was served as a stranger here, and has now left the earth, and
gone to the Father; consider but a few reasons to move you to leave the earth:
1. The earth was Christ's prison, he could not escape out of it, till he paid
his sweet life for it; only two that we read of, Enoch and Elias left the
earth, and went to heaven and saw not death; these that shall be changed and
shall not die, at Christ's coming have this privilege; but otherwise all have
a bruise in the heel, ere they go out of earth. 2. When Christ was on his
journey, he was not so much in love with the earth, as to repent and turn back
again; as Christ's head and face was toward heaven, Grounds of leaving of the
earth.
so his heart and soul followed, he went from the Cross straight way to
Paradise. 3. What does Christ leave? the earth. It is thy fellow creature of
God.

But 1. the footstool for the soles of Christ's feet, Esa. 66.1. Math. 5.35.

2. A footstool of clay far from the the throne of glory, the office house
of sin, Esaias 24.5. The earth also is defiled under the Inhabitants thereof,
chap. 26.21. For the Lord comes out of his place, to punish the Inhabitants
of the earth for their inity; It is Satan's walk, Job 2.2. And the Lord said
unto Satan from whence comes thou? and Satan answered the Lord and said from
going too and from the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

3. Its the poor heritage of the Sons of men, a clay patrimony, Psalm.
115.16. The heav^n even the heavens are Lords; but the earth has he given to
the children of men; and oppressors are the Landlords of it. Psalm. 10. God
arises to judge, ver. 18. that the man of the earth may no more oppress, Io^.
9.24. The earth is given to the hand of the wicked.

4. Yea, it is not only the slaughterhouse and shamble^ where Christ was
slain, The earth the slaughter house of the Saints.
but all the Martyrs and witnesses of Jesus were butchered here; for its said
of Babylon, Rev. 18.2^. And in her was found the blood of Prophets and of the
Saints, and of all that were slain on the earth; then the earth is the scaffold
of the Lambs of Christ where the^ throats have been cut.

5. Its a common Inn where bed and board is free to men, Devils, Sons,
Bastards, Elect and Reprobate; yea, The earth the Saints Pilgrimes-Innes.
to beasts called from their Country, Genesis 1.25. beasts of the earth; an
earthly minded man, is a fellow-citizen with beasts; it is a home to all but
the Saints, its their Pilgrime-Innes; it is a strange land and the house of
their Pilgrimage; Psalm. 119.19. I am a stranger in the earth; so David; so
Abraham and his; though they had the heritage of a pleasant spot of the earth
by prom^se, even the Land of Canaan; yet they sojourned in it as a strange
Country; and Heb. 11.13. Confessed they were strangers and Pilgrims on Earth,
2 Cor, 5.6. While we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord.

6. The first doomes-day fell upon the earth, for man's sin, Genes. 3.17.
Cu^sed shall the earth be for thy sake, The earths Dooms, day.
in sorrow shall thou eat of it all thy days. Its a cursed table to man: And
the other doomes-day is ripening for it, Revel. 14.15.16. Antichrists seat the
Earth of the false Church, is a ripe harvest for the Lords sickle of
destruction. The last doomes-day is approaching when this clay-stage shall be
removed, 2 Pet. 3.10. The earth and the works therein, the house and all the
plenishing shall be burnt with fire: Its no long time that we are here, if we
believe, Job chap. 7.1. Is there not an appointed time to man upon Earth? are
not his days like the days of an hireling? The earth is a sho^t enduring
stage.
Job 14.2. He comes forth as a flower, and is cut down, he flees also as a
shadow, and continu^th not. Many generations of hirelings have ended their
days task, and have now their wages, many sh^ddowe^ are gone down, many
Acters have closed their gam^, as it may be, and some have fulfilled their
course with joy, and are now within the curtine, since the creation.

7. It is a poor narrow ^oom^; Some, Esai. 5.8. make house to touch house, and
lay field to field, till there be want of place, The earth a poor narrow
piece.
that they only may be placed alone on the earth: if they report right of the
earth, who make it one and twenty thousand miles in circuit, if new found Lands
add to this some poor ^kers, and the Western Beast have much of this, Revel.
13.8. and the other Beast of the East, the Turk, the enemy of Jesus Christ,
have eight thousand miles of the Land, and other eight thousand miles of Sea,
making sixteen thousand miles of the two little Globes, (I leave others to
examine their Geographie) then it must be a base plea, and a poor lodging to
contend for; it were a good use for us to argue, Was the earth my Saviors
refuse, and his Inn, not his home, and if Christ left the earth long ago, We
should will^ngly leave the earth and follow Christ.
and was tired of it, then let us (Heb. 13.13.) go forth therefore unto him,
without the camp, bearing his reproach: for here have we no continuing city,
but we seek one to come: We cannot lodge, far less can we dwell in a house
that shall be burnt with fire; Nor is there room for us here; there is a more
excellent country above, where men have no winter, no night, no sighing, no
sickness, no death, but they live for evermore: we are thronged here for want
of room, and its a narrow tent; O what a large land is that above, in which we
shall not strive for Akers, Land, Kingdoms? Ioh. 14.2.
In my Fathers house (says Christ) there are (...) many dwelling places,
houses, great and fair, and numerous; all these are holden forth to us; the
earth is a creature near of kin and blood to the half of us, and our body.
When a Son of Adam dies, Psalm. 146.4.
he returns (...) to his own earth; had he no free heritage on the world,
though he were no landed man, yet when he goes to his grave, he returns
to his own free heritage, to his own earth, 32. If I be lifted up from the
earth. I will draw etc.

Here is a s^eciall condition of drawing sinners to Christ; the manner of
Christ^ death, his being lifted up from the earth, holds forth a drawing of
sinners up after him from the earth to heaven; hence Christ's death is a
special m^anes of heavenly-mindnesse and mortification. Christ's dying a
special ground of mortification.
So 1 Pet. 2.24. Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
that we being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness, Col. 3.2. Set your
affections on things above, not on things on the earth. 3. For you are dead*
and your life is hid with Christ in God, etc. 5. Mortify therefore your
members, that are on earth, fornication, uncleanness, etc.

Beza, Piscator, and others think it probable that Christ uttered this prayer
to his father, in the Syriack tongue, because the Evangelist uses the word
(...), to be lifted up from the earth, and the word (...) signifies both to
cut off, as (...) does, as Daniel 8.11. by him the daily sacrifice (...) was
taken away; and to exalt and lift on high, 1 Samuel 2.1. my horn is exalted,
Psalm. 99.2. the Lord is high, (...) above all the people, Psalm. 18.47. Let the
Lord be exalted Numb. 24.7. Psalm. 46.11. Esai. 49.11. Genesis 14.22. so ^e holds
forth such an exalting of Christ, as is to cut off, and to slay; this does come
home to drawing of man from sin, and the earth, by that Spirit purchased to
us by Christ's death: Now Christ's dying, thus being a taking of him away from
the earth, and from sinners, and that in a shameful manner, he being lifted
up on the cross, and he in this posture drawing us after him, its a clear
working in us the death of sin, and our deadness to the pleasures and glory
of the world. 1. Christ dyed pulling his brethren out of hell and sin, he
dyed, and his Spouse in his arms; and this shows how desirous Christ is to
have an union with us; its a posture of love and grace, his head bowed down to
kiss sinner* his arms stretched out to embrace them, his bosom open to
receive them* his sides pierced that the doves may fly into the holes of the
rock, and lodge there; Christ on the cross, broached and pierced, as a full
vessel, The manner of Christ's dying speaks the love we ow to him.
out of whom issues blood and water, justification and redemption from the
guilt of sin, and sanctification, is a drawing lover. 2 Here is fullness of
power, to reconcile to himself all things, whether they be things in heaven,
or things on earth, by the blood of his cross; here we are made Chrrsts
friends, to do whatsoever he commands us, Col. 1.20 Ioh. 15.15.

3. Nor is there a stronger band or cord to draw men from sin, then the faith
of Christ's death, Gal. 2.20. I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
yet not I, but Christ liv^th in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh,
To be crucified to the world what it is.
I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for
me, Gal. 6.14. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world;
here is reciprocation of death's: Paul is crucified to the world, as a dead
man, not in the world, nor one of the worlds number* A mortified Saint drawn
up to heaven from the earth, is an odd person, not under tale, he may be
spared well enough; the world and the Town he lives in may be well without
him; as Joseph was the odd ladde* separated foom his brethren, and David none
of the seven, miscounted in the telling among the Ewes at the sheepfolds, and
forgotten as a bastard, or as a dead man out of thought: And again the world
is crucified to Paul, for it looks like a hanged man, it smells like a dead
corpse to a Saints senses. Now thus they have not eyes more affected with the
world, nor ears more taken with their music, How base the world is to a Saint.
nor a heart more overcome with the lusts of the world, nor a dead man set to a
rich table is affected with all the dainties there, or with the harping of the
sweetest musician; the man has escaped the (...) the pollutions ^f the wo^ld,
to him the world has sooty fingers, and dirty and picky hands, it defiles
washen souls but to the unmortified man the world smells like the garden of
God: Lust casts in, and well comes to eye and heart and fancy, Grenades and
fire-bals of uncleanness; sinful pleasure has a rosy face, profit has golden
fingers, Court and honor has a sweet breath, the world is not to him an ill
smelled stinking corpse, fit for nothing but for a hole under the earth; Nay but
god-Mammon looks like heaven; the world a poor thing, yea the world of it self
is but a bag of empty wind, a fancy: (1.) It has no weight, as touching the
part of it we count most of, the earth, but so many pounds of clay, the
dreggs, the earthie bottom of the creation: (2.) the stage that pieces of
brittle clay comes upon* and weeps, and laughs, and lives, speaks and dies:
(3.) The flowers of it, that we are most in love withal, the lusts of the eye,
the lust of the flesh, the pride of life, are not of God, 1 Ioh. 3.16. (4) It
is a house of glass, or of Ice that stands for the fourth part of the year,
for winter, but is removed in the Spring, and is never to be seen again, for
it passes away like a figure written on the Sea-shoar, when the sea flows, 1
Cor. 7.31. (5.) the frenizes, or passements of it pleasure profit, honor, are
all sick of vanity and change, to the Saints that are crucified, and buried
with Christ, in whom lust is nailed to the cross of Christ, the world is a
dead bag of despised dust, and though a toe or a finger of a crucified Saint
will make a motion and a sti^re, and break a wedge of the Cross, because of
the indwelling of a body of death, yet hear his arguing. O vain clay-god,
dirty Earth, I ow thee no love, because my Lord was lifted up from the earth,
and has drawn me after him. I care not for this bubble of a vain life, this
transient shadow, seeing Christ could not brook it: What is the fancy of a
plaistered and fairded worldly glory to me, if Jesus his face was spitted on?
what is this painted globe of an empty perishing, and death-condemned world to
my happiness, seeing my Savior was a borrowed body, a stranger and slaughtered
in the world, and had all against him, and always the wind on his face?

Now let us consider what Antinomians say of mortification; Den his doctrine
of John Baptist, page 48.
What is mortification (says (a) Mr Den) but the apprehension of sin slain by
the body of Christ? What is vivification but our new life? The just shall live
by faith, I may know (says the Antinomian) Rise Reign unsavory speeches, cr.
7. page 10.

Antinomians fleshly doctrine of mortification.


I am Christ's, not because I do crucify the lu^^s of the flesh but because I
do not crucify them, but believe in Christ that crucified my lusts for me:
Much of this lawless and carnal mortification is to be found in Saltmarsh his
unexperienced treatise of free Grace, in which he labors to make Protestant
Divines Antichristian Legalists in the doctrine of mortification; for his way
is Free Grace chap. page 84.85.
that we are to believe our Repentance true in Christ, who has repented for
us; our mortifying sin true in him through whom we are more then conquerers;
our new obedience true in him who has obeyed the Law for us, and is the end of
the Law to every one that believes, our change of the whole man is true in
him, who is righteousness and true holiness; and thus without faith it is
possible to please God, for there is (says he) Free Grace chap. 3. observe. 5.
page 60.
great deceitfulness in mortification of sin, as it is commonly taken, (he
must point at Calvin, and other Protestant Divines, for as Papists and
Arminians commonly speak and teach, we are justified by works of penance and
mortification) for the not acting of sin, or conceivings of lust is not pure
mortification; for then page 66.
children, and civilly moral men were mortified persons, etc. It is not in the
mere absence of the body of sin, for then dead or sick men were mortified
persons.

Eatons Honey comb of justification, chap. 8. page 164.165. We mortify our
selves only declaratively, to the sight of men -- whereby the holy Ghost sees
not us properly mortifying our sins out of the sight of God; for then he
should see us robbing Christ of that glory which his blood has freely done
before we begin; nay but when the wedding garment has freely curified us in
the sight of God then the Spirit enters in us to dwell, which otherwise he
would not do, and enableth us to walk holtly and righteously, to avoid and
purify out of our own sight, sense, and feeling, and out of the sight of
other men that sin which the wedding garment has purified and abolished before
out of the sight of God.

But this in name, and thing, is the doctrine of the old Libertines in Calvines
time, Chap. 18. page 450 Si Dei samus, veterem hominem i^ nobis crucifigi oport
re, veterum Adamum interire.
as ^e may read, Calvin opuscul. instructio adversus Libertinos chap. 18. page
450.451. The Libertines (says Calvine) seem to be of the same mind with us,
and extol Mortification and Regeneration, and say we cannot be the sons of
God, except we be borne again, and if we belong to God, the old man must in us
be crucified, the old Adam must perish, and our flesh must be mortified; but
they destroy all holiness, and tansforme themselves into beasts, when they
explain to us their regeneration and Mortification; they say, regeneration is
the restitution of man, Antinomian Mortification is the brood of the fleshly
senslesnes of the old Libertines page 541.
to that innocence in the which Adam was created.

And they expound it thus; This state of innocence was to know nothing, neither
good nor ill, black nor white, not to know or feel sin; because this was
Adams sin to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; so by the mind
of Libertines, to crucify old Adam is no other thing then to discern nothing,
not to feel sin in our selves, Quia hoe Ade peccatum suit comedere de
fractuscienti^e boni and mali, Sic, ex Libertinorum sententia veterem Ada mum
mortifica renihil a^rud est quam n^d dis cernere, quasi ma icognitione sublata:
ac puero, um more naturalem sensum etque inclinationem sequi; hu^c Orationi
Locos Scripturae accommodant, quibus puertis simplicitas commendatur. 451.
Calvi. ibid.
as Mr Eaton says, but all knowledge of sin being removed, it is, according
to the custom of children, to follow sense and natural inclination; hence
they drew into their mortification all the places of Scripture in which the
simplicity of children is commended; Eaton just so, Honeycomb, p. 165. unto
natural reason (or sense) objecting, if we be perfectly holy in the sight of
God, then we may live freely, as we list in sin; Paul Answers, Nay, that is
unpossible; for (says he) how can we that are dead unto sin live yet
therein? that is as if a man be by justification restored to the case of the
first Adam or perfectly freed from all sin in the sight of God, as he is freed
from the troffick and business of this life that is dead, which must needs be,
if we be made perfectly holy in the sight of God from all spot of sin? Nay,
he cannot choose but show and declare the same by holy and righteous living, to
the sight of men, and mortify them to himself and to his own feeling and
sense, as he is by justification dead to them in the sight of God. Consider if
Antinomians and Libertines do not both join in this; that though sin in our
conversation and before men, as to walk after our lusts, we being once
justified, is truly contrary to the Law of God, yet to mortify sin to our
sense is to attain to a sense and feeling that it is no sin to us and before
men, as it is no sin in the sight of God, and in the Court of Justice, because
its freely pardoned; this is the current Doctrine of Antinomians.

When Libertines saw any man troubled in conscience with sin, they said to
him, O Adam, know thou somewhat yet? Page 451. Calvin. Ibid. Si quem vident
mali consci^ntia move^i: O Adam, inq^iu nt, adh^n^ a^iquid cernis? vetus homo
nondum in te c^ucifixus est? Si quem videant ^^mo^e iudicii divini percelli,
adhuc, inqu unt pomi gustum Labes? cave ne buccella ista te strangulet; si quis
peccata sua considerans sibi displce^^, ac marore af^^siatur: seccatum ad^uc in
ipso regnare aiunt: and sensu carnis s^ae captivum te^e^i.
Is not the old man yet crucified in thee? If they saw any stricken with the
fear of the judgment of God; have thou yet (said they) a taste of the apple?
beware that that morsel strangle thee not; sin yet reigns in thee. So Mr
Town the Antinomian said, page 103. David confessed his sin, not according to
the truth and confession of faith, but from want and weakness of faith and
effectual apprehension of forgiveness, page 97. I can look on my self my
actions, yea, into my conscience, and my sins remain (this is the sense of the
old Adam, the unmortified flesh) but look into the records of Heaven, and Gods
justice, and since the bloodshed of Christ (why were no the fathers pardoned
before Christ shed his blood?) I can find there nothing against me, but the
band by my surety is satisfied* and cancelled, and even these present sins,
which so fearfully stare in my face, are there bl^tted out, and become a
nullity with the Lord; I need not cite Mr Den, Eaton, Crispe, Saltmarsh; for
Town and all the Antinomian race teach that it is unbelief, a work of the
flesh of the old Adam, and our weak sense, and want of mortification, that the
justified person feels sin; sorroweth for sin, complains of the body of
sin, as Paul does, Romans 7. For in that Chapter (says Crispe) he does not act
the person of a regenerate person, but of a scrupulous and doubting unbeliever:
But for the justified person, its more then he ought to do, if he confess
sin, crave pardon, mourn, fast, wal^ in sack cloth, he has peace (says
Town, page 34) Security, consolation, joy, contentment and hap^inesse, except
his flesh rob him of these: Its legal and bewrays the man to be under a
Covenant of works, if upon the committing of Incest, or the greatest sins, he
doubt whether God be his dear Father, Rise, ^aign, error. 20. And after the
revelation of the Spirit, neither the Devil nor sin can make the soul to
doubt. Error 32.

Libertines said, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man was nothing but an
opinion or an imagination, and these were new creatures, that were free of that
opinion that sin was any thing, Calvin. opuse. advers. Libert. cap. 13. p 451.
Vtautem (inqu^t) sacilius Libe^tinorum turpitudo innotescat, No^andu est

or such as believed sin to be nothing, and the benefit of Christ's death they
place in taking away that opinion, by which the first sin of Adam entered
into the world, and under this opinion they comprehended all scruple of
conscience, sense of judgment or remorse or sorrow for sin; and when this
opinion is taken away then there is no more sin, nor the world, nor the
Devil, nor the flesh.

Antinomians come well-neere fully up to Libertines in this, for in their
writings they tell us, that what sins justified persons fall in, being once
justified, are sins (sath H. Den) of our conversation, and before men, not
sins in the conscience and in the Court of Divine justice, or as Eaton says,
Honey-Combe, page 165.166. Before God they are no sins, and in his sight they
are perfectly abolished; yea, and become nullities, says Mr Town Assert. of
grace, page 97. But to our carnal sense and feeling says Eaton, they are
sins, till our sense be mortified, and when we look on our selves, our own
actions, yea on our own conscience. Now the adulteries, murders, denying of
the Lord Jesus; that David and Peter and other Saints fall in after their
justification, cannot be sins in themselves; but only in the opinion and sense
and feeling of such as commit these sins, and in such a sense as is contrary to
faith and the light of faith that believes (...) jus^ification in Christ's
death, The sins of the justified to Antinomians are not sins in themselves,
and in the sight of God, but only sins to their crooked sense and erroneous
opinion.
and must be abolished and removed by perfect mortification, then all the
justified are to believe what ^ver sins they commit in their conversation, and
before men, are no sins in themseves, or the court of Divine Justice, or in
relation to a Divine Law; but they are sins in their sense or er^oneous
opinion. If Joseph be only dead in the opinion and in his Fathers mistaking
judgment, then he is not really dead, but lives. 2. Under this head
Libertines said mortification was not in abstaining from fleshly lusts that
war against the soul; but in removing the opinion and sense of apprehending
sin to be sin; and so Saltmarsh forbids: 1. Any man to doubt whither
his faith be true faith or no, and it is true faith, and wills all within the
visible Church to believe God loved them with an everlasting love, and its true
they are all chosen to salvation and that Christ died for all, and that opinion
makes it true, that Christ died for them all, and they are all justified in
Christ blood; there is here strong power in opinions. 3. Saltmarsh, Den, Town,
s^y mortification is not in personal abstinence from worldly lusts, but in
faith apprehending that Christ dying on the Cross satisfied for the body of
sin; then if they abstain from adultery, murder, perj^ry, being once
justified, its of mere courtesy, and of no obligation to either Law or Gospel
command, and if they commit such fleshly sins, they are only sins to their
weak flesh and opinion, not in themselves; and if they lay aside that opinion
and carnal sense, by the which they believe these to be sins, and believe
that Christ has abolished them, then these sins are no sins, but perfectly
mortified and abolished; that I do them no wrong, I repeat Mr Eaton's words;
Honey-Combe, chap. 8. page 165. The Holy Ghost sees us not properly
mortifying, cleansing and purifying our sins out of the sight of God our
selves, for then he should see us robbing Christ of that glory which his blood
has freely done, before we begin; but when the wedding garment wrought by his
blood, has freely purified them out of Gods sight, then the spirit (we being
thus first clean in his sight) enters into us to dwell in us, which otherwise
he would not do; but being entered and dwelling in us, he inableth us by
walking holily and righteously to avoid and purify out of our own sight, and
out of the sight of other men, that sin which the wedding garment has purified
and abolished before out of the sight of God and so we merely declare before
the Spirit, What sense and feel^ng o^ sin is to Antinomians.
that he himself and Christ's righteousness have originally and properly
cleansed and purified away and utterly abolished them out of Gods sight freely.
But this holy walking, they talk of is not opposed to sinning or walking after
the flesh, it is but a removing of the sinful sense and feeling or knowledge
of unbelief, by which we apprehended sin pardoned to be sin, when it was no
such thing; but our erroneous sense or opinion as the taste of the forbidden
apple remaining, could not rightly judge of these sins, because our life of
justification is hid with Christ in God, and we apprehended our selves to be
under a Law, and our lying, adulteries, swearing, etc. to be sins before God
and contrary to his holy Law, when they were no such thing; for we being
justified, are under no Law, and so as clean from sin as Christ himself, but
our dreaming sense judged so, but erroneously and falsely; for abolished sins
are no sins.

Parall. 5.

Libertines, (says Cal^ine^) because the Scripture says we are freed from the
curse of the Law, and made free in Christ, P^^mum cum Scrip^u^ae ^stenda^t^^s a

without all distinction, will have the whole Law abolished, and that we are to
have no regard of ^he Law a^ all.

Now I need not cite Mr Town and others Antinomians, who will have believers
freed not only from the curse and rigor of the Law, but from the Law as a rule
of righteousness, its obvious to all that read their writings. to which Calvine
Answers well, There is not (says he) any Epistle of Paul, in which he does not
send believers to the Law, as to a rule of holy living, to the which they all
must co^form their life: Yet Antinomians are not ashamed to pretend Calvin's
name and authority for their opini^n* when Calvine in a learned Treatis^
refuting the Libertines of his time, does clearly condemn the Antinomians of
our time; and proves from the necessity of sanctification, that we are not
f^eed from the Law.

Some a little legally biassed (says Saltmarsh Page 68.
) are carried to mortify sin by vows, promises, shunning occasions, removing
temptations, strictness and severity in duties* (what aileth him at w^lking
(...), strictly, Ephesians. 5.15. Psalm. 16.4. Iud^ v. 23?) fear of hell and
judgment, -- watchfuln^sse, scarce rising so h^gh for their mortification as

mystical mortification is being planted together in Christ's death, in our
union with Christ. So as a believer is to consider himself dead to sin only
in the fellowship of Christ's death mystically, and to consider himself only
dying to sin in his own nature spi^itually, so as in Christ he is only
complete; and in himself imperfect at the best. I find (says Saltmarsh) Page
70.71^
no promise made against the never committing such a particular act or sin
which a man lived in, in his unregenerated condition; there are differences
made, but it puzzles both D^vines and the godliest to find a difference
between sins committed before, and after regeneration; for take a man in the
strength of natural or common light, l^ving under a powerful word or
preacher, by which his candle is better lighted then it was, such a man shall
sin against as seeming strong conviction, as the other, if not more; This to
me is that which the Libe^tines of New England Rise, Reign, o^^or, 16. p 4.

a living faith, that has living fruits may grow from the living law. I see
not but all these must follow, if a regenerate David* or Peter may commit the
same act of relapse and falling in the same sin of adultery and murder after
conversion, How a Convert cannot fall in the same sin after conversion that
he committed before conversion.
which he committed before conversion: then he must commit the same sin with
the like intension and hight of bensill of will after as before conversion, and
he mu^t now after he is converted, fall again in the same act of murder,
denial of Christ, being now converted, which he committed before conversion,
that is as the unconverted man with the rankest and highest strength of lust,
and unrenewed will in its fervor of strength and rebellion did murder and d^ny
Christ, without any reluctance and pr^testation on the contrary from the
renewed will or the Spirit, he may, being converted, fall in the same sin;
yea, with a higher hand, and without any reluctance from the regenerate part;
this to me must infer necessarily the Apostasy of the Saints, as that
believers may fall again in these same sins with as high and up-lifted hand
against God, with as strong, full and high bended acts of the will after, as
before conversion, so as the battle of the Spirit against the ^lesh in this
wicked relapse does utterly cease: for Perkins who denies a man can fall in
the same sin, of which he once sync^rly repented, and whom Saltmarsh judges
a Legalist and Antichristian in this point, denies that a Convert may fall in
the same sin that he committed in his unregenerated state, or that a Convert
can fall in the same sin, every way the same with the like strength of
corruption that this Convert before acted in his unregenerated condition, yea,
or regenerate, he having a further growth of habitual renovation in the second
fall, and so a higher habitual reluctance of the renewed part, then when he
formerly fell in the same sin, and so it cannot be the same sin but a
lesser, otherwise he never sincerly repented of the former sin, if this be
more grievous and committed with a higher hand: Now Saltmarsh his ground is
different from all Pro^estant Divines, to wit, Saltmarshs free grace, p. 70.
That the wound, pricking or sorrow for sin in an enlightened soul leaves no
such habitual impression of remorse as the man dare never adventure to commit
the like again; for (says he) the gales and breathings of the Spirit of sorrow
for sin are like the wind that makes a thing move or tremble while the power
of the air is upon it, but as that slackens or breaths, so does it.

But this is to say right down that the Spirit of Grace, Sorrow for sin is
habitual in the Saints.
that causes sorrow according to God, and repentance which is never to be
repented of, is but an evanishing and transient act like the blowing of the
wind on a tree; the Scripture makes the spirit that produces mourning and
remorse for sin, when the sinner sees him whom he has pierced, an habitual
in-dwelling Spirit, and calls him, Zach. 12.10. The Spirit of grace and
supplication; if then the Spirit of Adoption be no transient, but an habitual
and inbiding grace, as is evident, Romans 8.23, 24, 25, 26. It is a received
spirit, abiding in us helping our infirmities, teaching us what to pray; it is
Esa. 44.^, 4, 5, 6. Water poured on the thirsty, making us confess and
subscribe the Covenant, and if it be, as it is the New heart, Ezech. 36.26, 27.
The Law in the inner parts, Ier. 31.33 the seed of God, 1 Ioh. 3.9. the
anointing abiding in us, 1 Ioh. 3.27. A well of water of an everlasting spring
within us, Ioh. 4.14. I se^ not how a Spirit groaning in us, when we pray, Romans
8.26. sighing, sorrowing for the in-dwelling body of sin, Rom 7.14, 23, 27. can
be but a passing away motion like a blast of air; but this is the mystery of
Libertines that the^e is no inheren^ grace in-biding in the Saints, no spring
of sanctification; all grace is in Christ and his imputed righteousness, and
so they destroy sanctification: 2. The aim of Sal. is here, that if we sorrow
once, and scarce that, at the beginning of conversion, we are never more to
confess or sorrow for sin, when that transient motion, like a fire-flaught
in the air is gone. But for mortification against all contrary blasphemies we
say.

Asser. 1. Mortification is not as Mr Den says, An apprehension of sin sl^in
by the body of Christ: Den Doctrine of I. Baptist, p. 48.

Mortification is not formally an apprehension of the mi^d, nor an act of
faith, as Antinomians say.


1. Because this apprehension is an act of faith, in the understanding faculty,
believing that Christ has mortified sin for me, and so Mr Den says,
vivification is to live by faith, that is to believe that I am justified and
have life and righteousness freely in Christ. Now mortification is not formally
any such apprehension, it does flow from faith as the effect from the cause;
but mortification denominates the man mortified not in his apprehending and
knowing that Christ wa^ mortified and dyed for him; but in that he really
himself is dead, when it is said, ^ol. 3.3. for you are dead, Gal. 6.14. by
Christ I am crucified to the world and the world crucified to me: by this
fancy, the world and the sinful pleasures crucified must be the faith and
apprehension that is in the fleshly pleasures and lawlesse-lusts by which these
lusts apprehend and know that Christ dyed for them; for Paul says, as well
that the world is crucified to him, as he unto the world.

2. Mortification is a deadness in will and affections, and the abaiting,
Mortification is a deadness of the powers of the soul to the pleasures of the
creature.
half death, the languor and dying of the power of our lusts to sin; as a
believer is dead to vainglory, when contentedly he can be despised, have his
name trampled on, be called a Deceiver, a Samaritan, and when the Apostles went
out from the Council Act. 5.41. Rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
suffer shame; and the Saints are pers^cuted, reviled, and men speak all manner
of evil against them falsely, for the name of Christ, Matthew. 5.11, 12. and yet
are so far from the boiling and rising of sinful lusts in them* that as if
choir lusts were dead, they rejoice under the hope of glory, then are they
mortified to these lusts and the like, I say, of fleshly pleasures, of
unlawful gain. 2. Mortification is when the heart runs not out wantonly and
whoorishly upon the pleasures of the creature, we are too ready to take the
creature in our bosom; but mortification is when the heart stands at a
distance from creatures; as Job says of himself, Chap. 31.24. If I have made
gold my hope, or said to the fine gold, thou art my confidence, ver. 25. if I
rejoiced because my wealth was great. 3. Its to be from under the power or
bondage to the creature or the world, the believer is above the creature, and
the world is under his feet as a drudge or servant; they have no Dominion over
the heart; he has a wife as if he had no wife; the man buys and possesses not;
because when he has bought houses, gardens, lands, they are no more in the
center and heart of his love, then if they were the houses and lands of an
other man; mortification is a Lord over the creature. But there is nothing more
contrary to the Gospel and the grace of Christ, then that the Apostles
rejoicing, when they we^e scourged and shamed for Christ, had nothing of realty
of scourging of shame, nor of real joy and deadness to the world in their
persons; only they believed and apprehended that Christ was scourged, shamed,
crucified for their sins; this is but opinative, not real mortification; The
Scripture knows nothing of imputed mortification, as contra-distinguished
from real personal and inherent mortification.

3. When Paul says, Col. 3.5. Mortify therefore your members* which are upon
earth, fornication, uncleanness, inord^nate affection, evil concupiscence --
for which things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience; h^s
sense must be, The Scripture holds forth a real and physical and personal
mortification inherent in us, and says nothing or the putative or apprehensive
mor^ification in Christ.
believe and appreh^nd that fornication, uncleanness, are mortified to your
hand, and that Christ has slain the body of sin on the cross, and the^e is an
end; now this is to annihilate sanctification, and to make justification all;
whereas justification, it alone is no justification being separated from
sanctification, as Libertines do, and the Popish sanctification, or the moral
acquiring of a new habit of holiness, and the infusion of supernatural habits
is not justification at all, yea, nor true sanctification, for they separate it
from the free imputation of Christ's righteousness, to a believing sinner: The
Libertine takes away sanctification and makes justification all; the Papist
takes away justification by faith and the free grace of God, and in the place
thereof substitutes a supposed moral, or civil sanctification; which to him
is all in all; further if this ( Mortify your members and the body of sin)
be nothing but believe that Christ has mortified the body of sin already, then
as we are justified from eternity, as some Libertines say, or as all say,
before we believe remission of sins in Christ's blood: so to be mortified to our
lusts, must he to believe we are mortified to our lusts long before we believe.
Paul thinks not so of the Colossians, set he says, v. 7. chap. 3. In which
also ye walked some time, when ye lived in them, v. 8. But now also put off
all these, wrath, malice, etc. Then before they were converted, and did
believe, they we^e not mortified nor freed from uncleanness, fornication,
because then they walked in these; except Libertines say that they were
mortified and did not walk in uncleanness, before they believed, but were
delivered in themselves from walking in these lusts, only they were not in
their own sense delivered, but in their own sense, though not really, they did
walk in fornication and uncleanness; this is not sober divinity; for they say,
before we believe we are justified, though not to, or in our own sense and
feeling till we believe; and why are we not also sanctified and effectually
called before we believe? for whom he called and predestined, them also be
justified, Romans 8.3^. And the Scripture never shows us of a man in time
justified, before he be sanctified, and mortified in some measure.

4. When Paul says Col. 2.6. As ye have therefore received Christ, so walk in
him, he means so mortify your lusts; then he must intend this; walk in
Christ, that is believe that Christ walked in Christ for you; and put on love
and brotherly-kindnesse, and pray continually, in all things give thanks,
abstain from worldly lusts, love one another, keep your selves from Idols,
seek the thinks that are above, etc. must have no other meaning but believe
that Christ has put on love for you, that he abstaines from fornication for
you, gives thanks, abstains from wordly lusts for you, keeps himself from
Idols, seeks the things that are above, mortifies his members that are on
earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, for you; all which are
blasphemies; or they can have this sense at the best, love one another; that
is, believe that Christ has satisfied for your hating one another, and then
ye love one another; and keep your selves from Idods, that is, apprehend and
believe that Christ has died for your Idolatry. Now this is a mocking of
sanctification, not a commanding of it.

Then to do all these and abstain from fornication, must be commanded and
forbidden in sou^^ other Gospel, otherwise we perform will worship, and
will-obedience to God, without warrant of his word, and the grace of God in the
Gospel does not teach us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, in our own
person, but only to believe that Jesus Christ has and does deny ^ngodlinesse
and worldly lusts, and perform active and personal obedience for us, and to
our hand; for Libertines cannot expound one Gospel charge one way, and another
Gospel command another way, and that we are obliged to personal active
obedience in one precept, If one Gospel p^ecept for ^cts o^ sanct^fica^ion l^y
no o^lig^t^on or personal or inherent obedi^^ce on us, then neither ca^ any of
them a^ al^ o^lige us.
and to imputed active or fidei jussory, or mediatory obedience in Christ, in
another; yea when we are in the Gospel to believe with a promise of ^ife and
righteousness, and that damnation is threatened, if we believe not, so are we
commanded to mortify our lusts, and seek the things that are above with
promises, and forbidden to walk after our lusts, because for these things the
wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience, then I may with equal
strength of reason say that the sense of these passages, Believe in Jesus
Christ who justifies the ungodly, and believe the immediate testimony of the
holy Ghost witnessing to your hearts that ye are the sons of God, must be
not to believe in your own persons, but believe that jesus Christ believes
for you, on Christ that justifies sinners and believe that the Spirit^:
witnesses to Christ's Spirit, that ye are the sons of God: Now if the
^ommands of the Gospel urge us not to personal obedience, but to believe that
Christ (as S. says) has obeyed for us, and that in the Gospel way, they cannot
oblige us in a law-way, as they teach, so by law and Gospel we shall be freed
from all personal obedience and morti^^cation, Saltmarsh and Libertines bid us
be merry, and believe that Christ has done all these for us.

5. A fle^^ly presumer walking after his lusts may believe that Christ
mortified sin for him, obeyed the Law, and repented for him: so if a hypocrite
as an h^pocrite, a presumer vainly puffed up, void of all down-casting and
conscience of sin, believe that Christ has repented and mortified sin, and
believed for him, though he live as the devil believing and trembling, he is
not to doubt his faith.

If they say, that men believing savingly and sincerely, cannot go on in a
constant walking after their lusts, never humbled for sin, never dispairing
in themselves, never out of love constraining them to please God and strive to
walk in Christ, as they have learned him; for if they be such, their faith is
but wild oats, and empty presumption: then they say, 1. Men know their faith
to be found, by holy walking: 2. Men may call in question their faith, if their
works b^lie their faith: 3. They deny that a fleshly man, as such, and never
humbled, can believe, (this is our doctrine.)

Asser. 2 Never any of our Divines said that pure mortification is the not
acting of sin, or the not conceiving of lusts; nor that it is the mere
absence of the body of sin; this is a foul slander; which if wilful,
Antinomians, though in their own eyes perfectly holy, in the sight of God must
answer to God for: nor is that any argument of weight to prove that
mortification is not the absence of the body of sin, because then (says he)
dead and sick men were mortified persons, except w^e admit such new vain
divinity that a bodily ague or sickness does extirpate the body of sin out
of the soul, which mad or frantic men would not say; and if it be truth that
the body of sin dwells in us, in this life, this body of sin is either
sin, or no sin; if it be no sin, let Libertines speak plain truth, we
deceive our selves, if we have no sin; If it be sin; Then let Libertines
resolve us, how Crispe and Eaton and Den say we are all as holy and clean
from sin, being once justified, as our surety Christ is, and as spotless on
earth as the Angels and glorified that are in heaven that stand before the
throne; now certain, neither in Christ, nor in Angels, is there any spot of
sin, or any indwelling body of lust: Crisp Sermon. 4. volu^. 2. page 1.^.
and Crispe gives this reason why sin dwelling in the Saints, is no sin; It
cannot sink (says he) into the head of any reasonable person, that sin should
be taken away (by the Lamb of God, Ioh. 1.29) and yet be left behind; it is ^
flat contradiction; if a man be to receive money at such a place, Antin^m^ans
deny any sin to be in the ^ust^fi^d, and so that they can si^, or that the body
of sin can be sin.
and he does take this money away with him, is the money left in that place,
when he has taken it away? Mr ^enne has a fine (...) for this; he says,
there is sin in the conscience, and sin in the conversation: Christ has
taken away sin out of the conscience of his called people, 1 Pet. 3.21. Heb.
10.22. The while raiment wherewith the Saints are clothed ^^gnifieth not only
cleanness before God, but also purity and cleanness of conscience confi^ing
in the apprehension of that glorious estate and ^ondition in Christ's death;
Den Sermon. The man of sin discovered, page 9.10.11, 12, 13.
so there is no sin at all in the Saints, 1 Ioh. 1.8. and the blood of Jesus
Christ shall purge you from all sin: in the conscience does joy and gladness
dwell, and there is no more place for sorrow and sighing; and there is sin in
the conversation or hands: now a man may be strict in conversation, and yet not
pure and clean in Conscience: So its possible a man has been an exceeding
sinner, and yet is not wholly cleansed from all wickedness in conversation; if
this seem a mystery to you that sin in the flesh (in the body, outward man
or conversation) should stand wi^h purity of conscience take these reasons, if
purity of conscience could not be found, but where there is purity in the
flesh, a pure conscience could not at all be found on earth, for there is none
that does good, no not one, Romans 3.12. (2.) Purity of conscience arises not
from purity of conversation; but the original of purity of conversation is
from the consciences apprehension that all our impurities and sins were laid on
Christ; and in regard of sin in the conversation, if we say we have no sin we
deceive our selves, 1 Ioh. 1. and 1 Ioh. 3.9. He that is born of God does not
commit sin.

Answ. 1. Sin in the conversation, Mr. Dens ^le^hly distin^tion of sin in
the con^cience (...) in the conversation re^uted.
and outward man is essentially sin; to ^ill my neighbor with my hands, to
speak with an unbridled tongue, to the Apostle James, argues a vain religion,
and must be pardoned, else such sins condemn; for he that offends in one, is
guilty of the breach of the whole law. Ergo, sin in the conversation must be
sin in the conscience, and the distinction must be vain; for the one member
is essentially affirmed of the other.

Now when John says, if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves; he
must mean of sin in the conscience, and of sin before God, and not in the
flesh and conversation only, because if sin in the conversation be no sin,
then when we commit sin in the conversation, we fail against no Law of God,
and do nothing that can bring us under eternal condemnation, and if in
committing sin in the conversation, we do nothing contrary to Gods Law, we
may well say we sin not, and yet not lie in saying so.

2. John must understand sin in the conscience, and in the sight of God, when
he says, if we say we have no sin, we lie, because that of that same sin
of conversation of which Mr. Den supposes John to speak, he adds in the
next words, 1 Ioh. 2.1. If we sin, we have an advocate; but the sin which
has need of an advocate, has need also of a pardon, and is a sin against the
Law, and in the sight of God, and in the conscience.

3. By this we may be pardoned, pure in conscience, justified in Christ's
blood* and yet before men, in the flesh, outwa^d man, No sin in the j^st^fied
according to the Antinomians.
and conversation under sin, and yet not be guilty before God; so
drunkenness, murder, Sodomy, incest, den^ing of the Lord Jesus Christ before
men, shall be no sins before God; for that which is p^rdoned is no more
sin then if it never had been committed, as Libertines say, and is no more
sin then any thing that ever our Savior Christ did, or the elect Angels; now
the sins which they call sins of conversation, and the Apostle Peter's denial
of Christ, and all the sins of the Iust^fied Saints, their Murders,
Adulteries, Parricids, etc. are pardoned, before they have the being or ess^nce
of sin, ere they be committed; ergo, when they are committed they are no
more sins before God, and in the Court of Conscience, and no more capable of
pardon, Sin in the conversati^n is ^n in the conscience, and before God.
then they were before they had any being, and were not as yet committed at
all: the murder that David is to commit some twenty years before ever he be
King of Israel, and shall commit, it is no more his sin to be charged on him
in the sight of God, then original sin can be charged on David before David
or his father less be borne; what may be charged as a sin on David, in
regard he is not yet borne, is no more his guiltiness, as yet* then the
guiltines of any other man: Now David's murthe^, Peter's denial, they being
justified from these sins, and pardoned ere the sins have any being in the
world, cannot be sins at all, nor such as are charged on Mankind, Romans 3.
Psalm. 14. There is none that does good, no not one; for this sin stops the
mouth of all the world, makes them silent, guilty and under condemnation
before God, v. 19.20. and how Mr, Den can cite this to prove that there be
some sins of conversation distin^t from sins in the conscience, let the
Reader judge; Yea, to my best understanding by these reasons while I be
resolved, Otherwise Libertines must hold neither the elect before or after
justification can sin any at all.

4. It is most false that a man strict and upright in conversation, can have a
foul and polluted conscience, if you speak of true sincere strictness and
u^rightnesse of conversation, as the scripture speaks, Psalm. 50.23. To him
that orders his conversation aright, I will show the salvation of God, Psalm.
37.14. The wicked draws his bow to slay such as be of upright conversation;
the principle of a soun^ conversation is the grace of G^d, 2 Cor. 1.12. the
sound conversation is heavenly mindedness, Phil. 3.20. and is in heaven, and
must be, as becomes the Gospel of Christ, Phil. 1.27. a good conversation,
Iam. 3.13. we are to be holy in all manner of conversation, 1 Pet. 1.15. and
so even before men; God beholdes the sins that we do to men, no less then our
secret sins we commit against God, and the scripture requires in our
conversation that it be holy, 1 Pet. 1.15. honest, 1 Pet. 2.12. chas^e, 1 Pet.
3.2. without coveteousnesse, Heb. 1^.5. not vain, 1 Pet. 3.16. not as in times
past in the lusts of the flesh Ephesians. 2.3. But the putting off of the old man,
Ephesians. 4.22. In charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in purity, 1 Timothy 4.12. Now
every conversation contrary to this, argues an unjustified and unpardoned
man*, and must ^e an unpardoned and sinful conversation, so as there is
neither strictness nor uprightness, nor any thing but sin and an unpardoned
estate, where this conversation is not, what ever Antinomians say on the
contrary, being in this, as in other points, declared enemies to the grace of
sanctification. But if we speak of a strict and upright conversation, in an
hypocritical outside, Its true, many are as Paul was, strict Pharisee^,
precise Civilians, painted tombs without, but within full of rottenness and
dead men's bon^s: But this way Satan only says Job is a strict walker, and
serves God for hire, and the enemies of Christ join with Antinomians in this,
to say, that the justified in Christ, have but sin in their conversation, but
wide consciences, because they study strictness of walking with God; but
purity of conversation, (as the places cited prove) must be unseparably
conjoined with purity of conscience; separate them who will, Christ has
joined them.

Mr. Eaton and Mr. Town call the sins of justified persons sins according
to their sense or the flesh, but in regard of faith they are clean of all sin,
and without spot in the sight of God. So Eaton Honey comb, chap. 5. page 87.
God freeth us not of sins to our sense and feeling, till death, for the
exercise of our faith. yet in his own sight he has perfectly healed us. chap.
5. page 95. So Saltmarsh Free grace, page 57. chap. 3. article 3. calls it the
lust of sin, the just (says he) shall live by faith, which is not a life of
sense and sanctification merely, but by believing of life in another.

I should gladly know, if sin in the justified be sin really and indeed, or
against any Law? I believe not. 1. Eaton says, ^in has lost its being in the
justified: Saltmarsh part. 2. chap. 32. If a believer live only by sense,
reason, ex^erience of himself as he lives to men, he lives both under the
power and fe^ling o^ sin and the Law: Now he should not live so; this is the
use of unbeleefe; ergo, He ought to believe that h^ has no sin; and so he
has no sin, nor does he sin, only the blind flesh falsely thinks that
is sin which is no sin:

But faith is not to believe a lie; then a believer may say, he has no sin;
John says, that is a lie.

Assert. 3. Mortification essential is in abstaining from w^rldly lusts,
Mortification is in abstaining from si^ and in the remissenes and faintnes of
the powers of the soul to act sin.
and in remiss and slacked acts of sinning, and in begun walking with God, and
acts of holy living, yet so as all these do flow from faith in Christ; another
mystical or Gospel-mortification is unknown to the Gospel, Romans 6.^. Therefore
we are buried with him by Baptism unto death, that like as Christ was raised up
from the dead, by the glory of the Father, so we also (consider the formal
acts of mortification) should walk in newness of life, ver. 5. For if we have
been planted together in the likness^ of his death: we shall be also in the
likeness of his resurrection, ver. 6. ^nowing this that our old man is
crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth
we should not serve sin; Then as it is one thing to sin, and another thing to
serve sin; so acts of mortification must be in abstaining from greedy sin,
as hired servants make it their life and work to sin; and in remiss and
weakened acts of sin, as a dying man's operation are less intended and
hightned then of a strong man in vigor* and health; as for the plenary
mortification, expiring, and death of the body of sin, we think i^ cannot be,
so long as we are in the body, Col. 3.3. Ye are dead, ver. 5. mortify
therefore your members that are upon earth, fornication, uncleanness, etc. To
mortify fornication, must be the none-acting of fo^n^cation: 1. Because it is
an abominable sense to imagine that we mortify fornication, when we believe
that Christ abstained from fornication for us* 2. On to believe that Christ
dyed for our fornication and uncleanness; for both these may hold forth
mortification of fornication and committing of fornication. 2. Because for not
mortifying of fornication, the wrath of God comes on the children of
disobedience, ver. 6 Now wrath com^s not on wicked men because they believe not
that Christ abstained from fornication for them; many walk in uncleanness,
covetousness, who are therefore under wrath, who are not obliged to believe
that, because they never ^eard the Gospel. 3. Such an abstinence from
fornication is here commanded, as the Colossians and other Gentiles walked in,
ver. 7. and which they had now put off with the old man, ver. 8. But the
Colossians, while they were Gentiles, and heard not of the Gospel, did not walk
in this as in a sin, that they believed not that Christ abstained from
fornication for them and satisfied divine justice for their fornication; but
their sin was, that in person, they committed these sins, 1 Pet. 2.11.
Dearly beloved* I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fl^s^ly
lusts that war against the soul, ver. 24. Who his own self bare our sins
in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sins should live to
righteousness Romans 8.11. And if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the
dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall als^ quicken
your mortal bodies, ver. 12. Therefore brethren, we are debtors not to the
flesh, to live after the flesh, verse. 13. for if ye live after the flesh ye
shall die: But if ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body ye
shall live, ver. 10. If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, Gal.
5.24. They that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts, Gal. 2.1^. For I, through the Law, am d^ad to the Law, that I might live
unto God; all Gospel-commands to subdue the lusts of flesh, not to serve the
flesh as debtors paying rent thereun^o: to mortify the deeds of the body, not
to live to our selves etc. were mere precepts for justification, not for
sanctification and mortification of lusts, and should ^urn the Saints into
mere Solifidians, Gnostics, empty Professors and fruitless trees, if ou^
mortification were not in the weakening of lusts, ^bstinence from sin???service,
and living to him who is our ransomner. There is nothing more false then that
ever our Divines taught to mortify sins by vows, promises strictness and
severity o^ duties, watchfulness scarce rising so high for mortification as
Christ: For its Christ and faith in his death that is the spring and fountain
of mortification; yet is mortification formally in holy walking, and not
formally in bel^eving, for then should we be justified by mortification, for
sure we are justified by faith: 2. Faith is a duty of the first Table
respecting God in Christ as its object: mortification to uncleanness,
vainglory or the like, is a duty of the second Table respecting men.

Asser. 4. The living of the just by faith, is as well the life of
sanctification, To live be (...) sanctification a^ the (...).
as of justification; its true the life of justification is the cause, more
complete and perfect, and the other the effect and unperfect; but our
spiritual condition is not only in sanctification, but also in justification.
And only enemies of free grace, separate the one from the other; and highten
the one to feed men on the East wind, and lessen the other, as if
sanctification were an accident, and some indifferent Ceremony, that men walk
after the flesh and believe, that Christ for them walked after the Spirit, and
that is enough: nor do we teach men to weigh their state of Grace in the
scales of mortification or simple not acting of sin, as mortification comes
from moral and natural principles, but as it flows from faith apprehending
Christ crucified, and from the Spirit of the Father and the Son drawing the
sinner to Christ, and our blessedness is no less in that corruption is
subdued, and the dominion removed, then in that the curse is taken away. A
sinner as a sinner not humbled i^ no^ to believe ^pplic^^orily.
Saltmarsh when he wills the sinner as a sinner, a Parricide, a Manslayer, a
slave to his lusts, to be^ieve and apply Christ as his Redeemer without any
sense of sin or humiliation at all, and then says the man's blessedness is
more to have the curse of sin, then the corruption of sin removed, clearly
concludes that a man that walks after his lusts in actual lusting against the
Lord Jesus and the Gospel; proud, vain, selfe-righteous, is as such a man to
believe, and so blessed and may promise to himself peace, though he walk after
the imaginations of his own heart.

Nor is arguing against the tentation with spiritual reason from the word as
Joseph did Genesis 39.8.9. and Job chapter 2.9.10. and David, 2 Samuel 16.7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14. our own power or contrary to the fighting by the shield of
faith, the Word of God; as Saltmarsh imagines.

Assert. 5. It is to be reputed as a most blasphemous assertion, that we know
we are Christ's, not because we crucify the lusts of the flesh, but because we
do not c^ucifie them; Pet 1. Crucifying of our lusts is a mark of our being in
^hris^ Gal. ^.24 Romans 8.13. This makes walking after the Spirit, and a parting
from iniquity and being pure in Spirit and dying to an (...) of no interest in
Christ, contrary to Romans 8.1, 2. 2 Timothy 2.19. Math. 5.8. 1 Pet. 24. Gal. 1.4. 1
Pet. 1.18. and contrary to the whole Gospel: which was that blasphemy of David
George who taught mortification was to act all uncleanness without shame or
sense of sin; The mortificati^n of David George.
and the more men are v^yd of the common passion that follows sin, the more
mortified and spiritual they are; and this is very like ^^e Libertines way,
who teach Ris^, R^ign error. 57 p. 11.
That to take delight in the holy service of God is to go a whooring from God;
and that they are Saltmarsh free grace, chapter 5. page 58.
legally biassed, that would mortify the flesh by watchfulness and
strictness of walking; whereas to put our duties on the Throne with Christ,
and to put Christ's crown on our mortification, as if we were thereby justified
is the Idolatry; But the delighting in the Law of the Lord, and taking of the
Lords testimonines for our heritage, a serving the Lord with cheerfulness and
fervor of Spirit, Psalm. 1.2. Psalm. 119.111.262. Isai. 58.13. Psalm. 112.1. Romans
7.22. Romans 12.8. 2 Cor. 9.7. Phil. 4.4. Act. 20.24. Iaem. 1.2. are marks of a
blessed condition. If any teach that we mortify the flesh by watchfulness
and strictness of walking, as if these did merit mortification, we judge it
cursed doctrine; but if Libertines deny, as they do, that acts of
mortification do formally consist in watchful, strict and accurate walking
with God, in being not taken, nor madly drunken with the lusts of sin, but dead
to pleasures, as these acts flow from the Spirit of Christ, we curse their
fleshly doctrine also.

Its no consequent to say, because Saltmarsh free grace, c. 5. page 71.72.
Regeneration is not a work of nature, but of the Spirit of God, and the way of
the Spirit is not so gross and carnal as the Divinity of former times, it
being hard to trace and find the impressions of the Spirit, therefore we are
not to take experience so low, and carnally, by the feelings of flesh and
blood, and signs not infallible, as to write of Regeneration as Philosophers do
of moral virtues.

Answ. 1. Regeneration is above nature every way, but in this its most suitable
to nature. That as a man come to age does not at all times, even when he is
sick, in a swon, in a deep sleep know that he lives; yet ordinarily life has
reflect acts on it self, so as a living man may know that he lives by many
signs of life; so a regenerate man, except he be deserted may know that he
lives the life of God.

Antinomians (...)
2 If Antinomians find out new Divinity less cernall, more spiritual, then in
former times, how is it that Christians are to live from under all rule of
life? and not to pray, forgive us our sins, when they pray for daily bread?
and that none justified are to confess their sins and to sorrow for them: that
new obedience, mortification, repentance, is to believe that Christ has done
these for us; that we are not to pray continually but only when the Spirit
stirs us? an hundredth of these false ways may be shown; is this more
spiritual Divinity then in former ages? is it not the most carnal divinity
that we read of? for when D. Tailor objecteth to Antinomians, as a limb of
their fleshly divinity, No action of the Believer after justification is sin,
Mr Town answers nothing at all but of the way, Mr Tow^e Asser. o^ grace, page
71.72.73.
no action is sin, the disorder and ataxie of the action is the sin. But D.
Tailor meaned that there is no disorder in the actions of a justified man by
their way; to this Mr Town replyeth not one word, but says unto faith there is
no sin, because there is not one spot in a justified person; and he cites Rev.
1.5. Ephesians. 5.26. Cant. 4.7. and 6.9. 1 Cor. 6.11. because Christ has washed
Rev. 1.5. purged, Heb. 1.3. abolished, Heb. ^.26. all our sins, and has made
us holy and unblamable and unrebukable in the sight of God; we are like Christ
void of sin; which is not the removal of sin, but of the guilt, that is, of
the obligation to eternal wrath and the curse of the Law; for if we say we
(even though justified as John the Apostle was) have no sin, we are liars; can
this be any but a divinity of the flesh that Antinomians teach?

3. Sanctification is a far other thing then moral virtues: 1. A moralist
that is ^emperate, chaste, is never so over-clouded in his faith, as to doubt,
whither he be a temperate man or not; Holiness and moral virtues far
different.
a sanctified soul will often doubt if ^e have any sanctification at all: 2. A
sanctified man must ^^ve the use of the light of the Spirit to know his ^tare,
and these things that are freely given him of God, 1 Cor. 2.12. A Mo^^li^^
knows with the light of his own sparks, what he is; does Saltmarsh know of
any desertions or overcloudings of the Spirit, in a moral Seneca, Aristides,
Plato? 3. The Moralist dreams of justification by his virtues. 4 He needs only
natural reason, not the breathings and stirring of the Spirit to act according
to his moral habits. 5. Nor are his habits infused from heaven, but his own
conquest. 6. Nor knows he an absence or a presence of the Spirit, all which
are peculiar to sanctified and just^fied persons.

We are not completely (says Saltmarsh) or perfectly mortified to sin, by our
being planted into Christ, and the fellowship of his death.

Answ. But if mortification be the faith and apprehension that Christ
mortified sin for us, then as we are perfectly justified, so are we
perfectly mortified; now Antinomians teach the former.

Let not (says he) mortification of sin in Christ, tempt any to a neglect of
mortification of sin in the body, no more then the free grace of God in
forgiveness of sin ought to tempt any to take liberty to sin.

Answ. 1. Surely as to add an thing to justification, so to advance in
mortification must be as wicked and blasphemous, according to the way of
Antinomians, To add to Antinomians mortification is to add to Christ's merits.
for if mortification be the believing that Christ has slain the body of sin,
as Mr Den says (and Saltmarsh seconds him as a brother) ^hen our neglecting of
mortification is no sin, for we are to believe that Christ has removed all
neglects of mortification, if mortification be faith and belief that Christ
mortified sin for us.

2. I cannot neglect justification or apprehension that Christ mortified sin
for me, any otherwise but by a remiss act of believing, or neglect of a higher
measure, and a more intense and strong act of faith, and not by an abstinence
from fleshly lusts; such an abstinence is no faith or apprehension that Christ
has slain and mort^fied the body of sin for me; for non-sinning cannot
formally be believing; that were nonsense.

3. If the meaning be that we are not to abstain from fleshly lusts* that is
from sins that the flesh or the body of sin acts in us, this is neither
mortification nor any part thereof, to Antinomians. But I desire and provoke
Antinomians to satisfy us in these; if Salmarsh one of their Patrons can.

1. Whither or no sins of the body, or in the body, as Saltmarsh calls them
here, or sins of conversation, as Mr Den says, or sins, as Mr Town speaks,
arising out of these earthly members of our flesh, Mr Twn asser. of grace, page
72.

Queries that Antin^mi^ns can never Answer,


he sins against the Law of God; if so, they involve the justified under a
curse, and so they a^e sins formally, and the justified either cannot sin a^
all, which I fear is the fleshly way of Libertines, a way that my soul
abhorre^, if I be not deceived, or then, the sins, the adultery o^ a
just^fied man, the m^rther, the denial of Christ in Peter, is no less a
breach of the Law of God, then the denial of Christ in Judas (it may be the
one with a greater bensill of will denies Christ, then the other; sed magis and
minus non variant speciim) and so the jus^ified do as truly and essentially
sin against the Law, as the unregenerate does; then they are not as clean from
sin as Christ the surety is.

2. If murders, adulteries committed by the justified be sins of their
flesh and body that is, such sins as they are not by any Prophet or Nathan to
be rebuked for; because the Spirit that is not in their power, in his actions
and motions did assist not them to abstain, and they are under no other Law,
but the only irresistible action of the Spirit to hinder them physically in all
sins, to abstain from any sin, this must be Antinomians spiritual divinity;
to make no Rule no Law of ordering the life and conversation of an justified
man; but only the motions of a Spirit separated from the world.

3. Whither or not when Paul said, Romans 7.17. Now it is no more I (that sin)
but sin that dwells in me, ver. 18. I know that in me, that is, in my
flesh, dwells no good thing, his meaning be according to the Antinomians
divinity, that no regenerate man sins, but his flesh and sensitive part
which is not capable of any Law, sins: but he who acts the sin being above
or from under Law, Rule, or direction, sins not against God, or any Law?

4. Whither or no the Enthysiasts Rule, which is the immediate and irresistible
inspiration of a Spirit, which does press a brother to kill a brother, and has
done it, as Bullinger says of the practice of diverse Anabatists, and some of
New England said, though they resisted the Christian Magis^rate, and fired the
Churches of Christ there, yet they should be miraculously delivered from the
Court, as Daniel was from the den of Lions; whither or no this Rule of the
Spirits immediate acting without Law and Gospel be the only Law and Rule that
the justified are under and led by?

5. Whither from this spring does not flow the rejecting of all the Scriptures
or written Law or Gospel, as if they were but a covenant of works, and the
walking by the Spirit separated from the word, and the denying any marks as
love to the brethren sincerity, keeping of the commandments of God recommended
in the word, Ioh. 14.15. 1 Ioh. 2.3.4.5. 1 Ioh 3.14? and if this be the
spiritual divinity spoken of here?

6. Whither or no sins of the body and of the flesh or conversation (as
Antinomians call them) be not sins against the Law of God, and make the
justified truly guilty, if the Lord should enter in judgment with them, and
though they that commit them be justified, and so absolved from obligation to
eternal wrath, are not formally and inherently blotted, and sinful in those
sinful acts?

7. If they are not to be sad for them as offensive to the authority of the
Lawgiver, and the love of Christ, though they be not to fear the ete^nall
punishment of them? for sorrow for sin, and fear for sin, are most different
to us.

8. Whither the free-g^ace of God does not tempt men to sin, most kindly and
from the nature of free grace, according to the Antinomian way, if the
free grace of justification do free the justified so from sinning; as their
indulgence to the flesh and sinful pleasure, can be no sin in Gods court,
no more then there can be sin in Christ; and if they be as free,
notwithstanding of all the sin they do, being once justified, as if they never
had sinned, or as the sinlesse Angels; and if the essence of sin and all they
do against the Law of God, be as clean removed as money taken away out of a
place, which sure cannot be said without a contradiction, to remain in that
place, as Dr Crispe speaks, and that before the sin be committed? whither can
a thing in its essence be wholly removed, as if it never had been, before it
have any being at all; can a rose be said to be whithered and destroyed as if
it had never been, before ever that same rose spring out of the earth? sure
faith cannot fancy lies and contradictions.

How ever it be, Christ's death teaches us mortification of our lusts, it is a
mortified like death, for he dies on a visible journey leaving the earth; his
back was toward life, pleasure, profit, he is not dead to his lusts, whatever
be his boasting who is not dead in, or with Christ to sin.

For 1. Christ's death and his contempt of the world teaches that we should
follow him. 1. He looked even straight before him, Diverse manif^sta^ions of
Christ's deadness to the world.
neither to the right, nor left hand, nor behind him; the meddows, buildings,
fair flowers and roses in the way of this passenger, did never allure him to
stay in the way and fall in love with any thing on this side of heaven, Heb.
12.2. as our (...) the captain of our faith (...) for the joy that was set
before him, 1. Christ mind^d h^aven exc^edingly in his ^ac^.
he endured the cross; his heart was so upon the crown, and that which was his
garland, his conquered Spouse, that he did run his race with all his breath
and wearied not; his heart was much upon the p^ize that he did run for.

2. H^ was nothing beholding to the world, he came to the house o^ his friends,
they refused him house room and lodgeing, Ioh. 1.11. His own received him not,
and therefore he was fame to lie with the birds of heaven, and the Foxes of the
earth; Christ was no landed man on earth, he had never a free house of his own
above his head; he had a purse, but no fi^e rent, no income by year, Matthew.
8.20. he had not whereon to buy a grave when he dyed, Ioh. 19.41. The earth was
his Fathers land; but he lodged in a borrowed grave; his coat was all his
legacy, yet it could not buy a winding sheet to him; the soldiers thought it
too little see for their pains in crucifying him, and it was not of much
worth, when they put it to the hazard of lots, take it that wins it; his heart
was never on the world, he refused a Kings Crown when it was offered to him
without stroke of sword, Ioh. 6.15. He had neither heart nor leisure to enjoy
the world, Christ dead ^^ the ga^n^ and glory of the world.
Ioh. 4. when he wanted his dinner, he begged a drink of water from a stranger,
and was wea^y with walking on foot, yet he was the one great Bishop, the head
of the body of the Church, and had neither horse nor coach, and he could have
made the clouds his chariot; he became poor that we might be made rich. Was
sweet Jesus thy Savior a poor man in the world? learn to be a stranger and to
want, and to be content to borrow, and to lie in the fields, and to have a dead
heart to the world: 1. O glory worldly', O all crowns, and gold, and stately
Palaces, blush, be ashamed, take not such a wide lodging in the hearts of
Saints, go not with so broad and fair Peacock-wings, ye are too big in men's
eyes, Christ our dear Savior refused you: 2. Rich Saints, drink at leisure,
use the world at the by, as if you used it not. Look with half an eye, the
least half of your desire upon this borrowed shadow: Let not thy heart water,
nor itch after white and yellow clay: 3. Gold, thou art not God, Saints look
over crowns and court; see, see what a Kingdom is above your hand; Pilgrims,
drink, but la^ not down your burden and your staff: let it be a standing
drink, and be gone; 4. Ye are longed for in heaven, 5. Your King lodged with
poverty and abasement, and shame; love the lodging the better that he was
there before you. Christ's love is languishing to have you soon cut of this
passing ^ransi^ory world and to be at your best home.

3. Christ did never laugh on earth that we read of, but he wept; O what a sad
world! Psalm. 69.11. I made sackcloth my garment; O precious Redeemer, cloth of
gold is too con^fe for thee, v. 20. Reproach has broken my heart, Christ a sad
man in the world.
I am full of heaviness; he was a man made of sorrow, Esa. 53.3. and had
experience and familiar acquaintance with grief; there be a multitude that goes
laughing, harping, piping and danceing to heaven as whole and unbroken-hearted
Christians mystical mortification (say they) is only faith, and joy; we have
nothing to do with weeping, confessing, sorrow for sin, that is a dish of
the Law Vinegar and Gall, it belongs not to us; we are not under the Law, but
under grace; that sour sauce is the due of carnal men under the bond^ge of
the Law; but will Christ wipe away tears from the eyes of laughing men, when
they come to heaven? believe (...), there goes no unbroken and whole professors
to heaven; that is far from mortification; heaven will not lodge whole
souls, with their Iron sinnew in the neck never cracked by the death of Christ.

Object. But godliness is not melancholy, but joy of the holy Ghost.

Answ. 1. True; but whom does Christ, The v^rious disp^nsation of G^d in
leading some to heaven, through sweet, some thr^ugh sour.
with the bowels and hand of a Savior bind up, but the brokenhearted
mourners in Zion, and such as lie in ashes? Esa. 61.1.2.3. sorrow and joy may
lodge in one soul.

2. Christ feasts some in the way to heaven, and dyets them daintily; some feed
ordinarily on the fat and marrow of the Lords house, Psalm. 63.5. And there is a
feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of
ma^row, of wines on the lees-well refined Esai. 25.6. and has not the King a
banqueting house, a wine-celler (Cant. 2.4.) for some? and do they not feed
upon the honeycomb, and the wine, the spiced wine and the milk? Cant. 5.1.
Cant. 8.2. But these that drink wine at some time, must at another time be
glad of a drink of water.

2. And if there be varieties of temperature of Saints, some rough and stiff,
some mild, some old men, and some babes, 1 Ioh. 2.13. and as there be some
Lambs, The various Tempers of the Saints require that some feast on fatt things
and wines, and others drink water.
some fainting weak and swooning tender things that Christ feeds like Kings
son^, with wine of heaven: so there be others that are under the care of the
steward Christ, who are heifers and young bullocks, like Ephraim not well
broken yet. Ierem. 31.18.19. and there be hoping and waiting Saints, that must
bear the yoke in their youth, Lament. 3.26.27. and sundry kinds and sizes of
children; every one must have their own portion and diet, 2 Timothy 2.15. Matthew.
24.45. One man's meat is another poison, and yet they are both the sons of
one Father.

3 Can every head that shall wear a crown in heaven, bear this wine, on the
earth, being clothed with such a nature? and must every one be taken into the
Kings house of wine, and sit between the Fathers knees, at the high table, and
eat marrow, and drink spiced wine? are there not some set at the by-board, that
must be content with browne-bread and small drink or water?

4. Though the word should be silent, it is easy to prove that Saints have not
the like fare of Christ's dainties at all times; for the Church, Cant. 2.4. is
taken into the banqueting house, and feasts on fatness of free love; and yet
again, Cant. 3. cries hunger, and seeks and finds not; and Cant. 5.1. feasts
with Christ on wine and honey and milk; but verse. 5.6. there is a dinner of
gall, hunger, and swooning, my soul (says the Spouse) went out of me.

Christ and the Saints have a sad journey to heaven in regard of afflictions.
5. How many Saints go to heaven, and you never heard another word from them
but complaints, want of access, straitning of Spirit, deadness, absence,
withdrawings of the beloved, at every slip, scourged, chastised every
morning? their complainings cannot be praised; yea till they land, they are
ever sea-sick, till they be at shore, never see a fa^re day, nor one joyful
hour, ^sal. 88.15. I am afflicted and ready to die (...) from my youth I
suffer thy terrors, and am distracted sore, for the Lords dispensation, we may
^ay, who has been upon his counsels and who has instructed him? Antinomians
allow daily feasts and the strongest of the Gospel wine for daily food to all
that are sinners; this we^ dare not do; but as we judge it a sin to stand
a^o^fe from free grace, because we have no mon^y nor hire: so to fill out the
wine of the the Gospel more largely and p^ofusely then the King of the feast
allows, even to sinners as sinners, and all unhumbled and high minded
Pharisees, is to be stewards to men's lusts, and to turn the Gospel in to the
doctrine of license to the flesh, and not to extol Free grace.

4. Christ in his way had no reason to glory in friends, 1. How was he
despised of them? Esai. 53.3. We did hide our faces from him; all his friends
thought shame of him, and fled the way for him, they refuse to give him one
look of their eye, 2. Psalm. 31.11. I was a reproach amongst all mine enemies,
but especially among my neighbors, and a fear to mine acquaintance, they that
see me without, fled from me; this is more to be a^pproach and a fear to
neighbor and friend. 3. Nature and blood went against it self, Psalm. 69.8. I
am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mothers children.

All the Saints Idols are broken, to the end God may be one for all; this is a
good ground of mortification; men shall be cruel brethren, and redeemed ones
shall have the iron bowels of an Ostrich, a Lion to kill you and to consent to
make war against you, that Christ's meekness may appear; friends must be
sour, that Christ may be sweet; and you may be deadned in love to brethren
and friends, yea to a forsaking father and mother, Psalm. 27.10.5. Christ free
from lusts, so we are not.
No lust had any life or stirring in Christ, this cannot be in us; the old man
that has lived five thousand years and above, is not so gray haired as to dye,
in any Saint while he die, his deceiveable lusts at best come to a staff and
trembling, and gray hairs in the holiest and most mortified, but expire not
till dust return to dust.

If I be lifted up, I will draw, When Christ is weakest and bleeding to death
on the cross, he is strongest, Col. 2.15. he triumphed over principalities and
powers; there is more of strength and omnipotency in Christ's weakness, then in
all the power and might of Men and Angels; the weakness of God is stronger
then men, 1 Cor. 1.25. there is more of life in Christ's death, then in all the
world; Christ weakest is strong.
he was a grain of wheat cast in the earth, and sown in the grave, and there
sprung out of dead Christ a numerous offspring of children, a^l the redee^ed
ones grew out of the womb of his grave, his Catholic Church was formed out of
the side of the second Adam, when he was fast asleep on the cross.

2. This makes the way of redemption so much the more admirable, that out of a
way of weakness, of death and shame, the Lord should out-work sin and the
Devil, and rear up to himself out of dust and hell and death, glory heaven and
eternal life: Infinite glory made a chariot of shame, and from it highly
honored Christ: Omnipotency did ride upon death, and triumph over hell and
devi^s, 1 Cor. 1.27. God has chosen the weak things of the world, to confound
things that are mighty, 28. and (...) the base, the kinlesse things that are of
no noble blood, and (...), things that are despised, the nothings of the world
he has chosen, and things that are not, (...) that he may make idle and
fruitless, or bring to nothing, things that are.

Use If the Lord Jesus at the lowest and weakest, his dying and shamed
condition be so strong as to pull his bride from under the water, Christ now
strong to save his Church.
and out of the bottom of hell, up to heaven, what power has he now, when he
is exalted at the right hand of the Majesty of God, and has obtained a name
above all names, and is crowned King in Zion? It is better to be weak, and
sick, and weep and sigh with Christ then to be strong, and live, dance, sing,
laugh, and ride upon the skies with men in the world; sure his enemies will be
now less then bread to him, and shall be his footestoole.

Christ minded us much in death.
2. Christ had cause to mind himself, and forget us, being now lifted up to
the cross under extreme pain and shame; but love has a sharp memory, even
in death.

Two things help our memory, and they were both in Christ: 1. Extreme love;
the mothers memory cannot fail in minding her child, because the child is in
her heart, and deep in her love: the wretch cannot forget his treasure, his
gold is in his heart; Christ loved his Church, both by will, and nature, and
cannot forget her, she is Christ's gold, and his treasure, Esai. 49.14, 15.
Christ could not cast off nature, the husband cannot forget the wife of his
youth; and the deeper love is rooted, the memory of the thing loved is the
stronger. O but it is many years since Christ loved his redeemed ones: 2.
Sense helps memory; a man cannot go abroad in cold weather and forget to put
on his clothes; sense will teach him to do that; a paining boil will keep a
man in mind of pain; the Church is a fragment and a piece of mystical
Christ; he cannot forget his own body; the Church is bone of his bone; the
head forgets not a wound in the hand. Love did sweat up an high and mighty
mountain with thousands on his back: 1. O what sweating for us even in death,
and sweating of blood: 2. O what praying, and praying more earnestly; Lord help
me up the mountain with this burden; and all this time, he is drawing and
carrying on his shoulders hell up to heaven. 3. What a sight was it to behold
Christ dying, bleeding, pained, shamed, tormented in soul, wrestling in an
agony with divine justice and wrath, receiving strokes and lashes from an angry
God, and yet he kept fast in his bosom his redeemed ones, and said, death and
hell, pain and wrath shall not part us. It pleased the Lord to bruise him, to
afflict his soul, not to spare him, to smite the shepherd, but it pleased him
in that condition out of deep love to draw his redeemed ones from the earth up
after him to heaven. Christ was a good servant, he always minded his work,
even to his dying day.

Use. If he in his weakest condition draw all men.

1. How easily can he with one look, blast the beauty and strength of his
enemies being a God of such majesty and glory? how weak is hell and all the
Iron gates of it? All weak, and Christ strong.
when Christ at the weakest, plucks his Church out of the jaws of death; and
triumphs over death and hell.

2. It shall be nothing to him with a pull of his finger, when he appears the
second time in power and great glory, to break the pillars that bear up heaven
and earth, and to dissolve with the heat and sparkles of fire that comes from
his angry face, the great Globe of the whole world, The world a weak thing to
Christ.
as a hot hand can melt a little snow-ball of some few ounces weight, and to
loose with one shake of his arm all the Stars in heaven, especially since
the world is now but an old thred-bare-worn case, and the best jewel in the
case is man, who is old and failed, and passes away like a figure; and it
shall be but a case of dead bones, and of old broken earthen shards at Christ's
coming, and Christ with no labor or pain, can crush down the Potters house,
mar all the clay-vessels, and burn with fire all the work of the house, the
Houses, Castles, Towe^s, Cities, A^kers, Lands, Woods, Gold, Silver, Silks, and
whatever is in it; glory not in the creatures, but glory in Christ.

3. Death and the cross are the weakest things in the world, but being on
Christ's back they are the strongest things in the world, 2 Cor. 13.4. Though he
was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God: 1. The
cross was Christ's triumphing Chariot; Christ strong in the Cross.
there is power and strength in Christ's tears, in his sighs, in the holes
that the thorns made in his head, in the stone laid above him, when he is
buried: 2. His shame, death, and burial, made the greatest turning of wheels
in the earth and heaven that ever the ears of man heard; Providence (...)
spe^iall ^o things most ^^calle^^.
the more providence does concern God, his highness, his glory, the more
special it is and accurate, not that infinite wisdom is not infinite in the
care over a worm, as over an Angel; but because there is more art of seen and
external visible providence in whole Kingdoms, in Kings, in the Church, then
toward one man or one Saint; so providence must have more of the art, wisdom,
special care of God toward his Catholic Church, and his own only begotten Son
in redeeming the whole Catholic Church, then in caring for the Lilies of the
field, and the worms of the earth, or some one particular Saint: What wonder
then there be an eminent providence observed in the disposing of Christ's coat
when he dyed, and in the borrowing of an Ass for him to ride on, and in
casting a garment on the Ass for a Saddle, or a foot-mantell when he rode into
Jerusalem? so in Christ's suffering there is much of God; there was a more noble
work in his dying on the cross, then the creating of the world; and there were
four things of the greatest baseness imaginable upon Christ, in this
providence; for there were upon Christ. 1. The weakness of death. 2. Extreme
pain. 3. The openest shame, Christ dying poor, despised, forsaken of all
friend and unfriend. 4. The curse of the Law in the manner of his death; yet in
all these he acted the part of a triumphing redeemer, Col. 1.19. For it pleased
the Father that in him all fullness should dwell, ver. 20. and (having made
peace through the blood of his cross) by him, to reconcile all things to
himself, whither they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

Use. Yea, we see Christ has never loosed any thing by the cross, but has
gained much, Romans 8.37. in all these we are more then conquerours, in death we
die not, (...) and h^^ C^^rch lose nothing by suff^^i^g.
a dead man is more then a conqueror, and if he should not live and triumph,
he could not be capable of conquering, far less could he be more then a
Conqueror, Revel. 12.11. The Saints overcome, but its a bloody victory; They
overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Testimony; Then if
the word be an overcomming and prevailing thing, the cause overcame; but what
if the persons be killed, then they are overcome? No; for the victory is
personal, the followers of the Lamb, overcame by dying, because they loved not
their lives unto death* Triumphing in the grave is admirable. Things work in a
threefold consideration: 1. According to excellency of their being, modus
operandi sequitur modum essendi, men's operations flowing from reason are more
excellent then actions of beasts. A threefold exc^llency of working in Christ
dying
And Angels excel men in their actions. Its a noble and excellent being that
is in Christ, being the only begotten Son of God; what excellency of working is
this, that not only the dead, but death should live? and shame should shine in
glory? the dumb may speak, and the deaf hear; but that dumbness should speak,
and deafness hear, is more then a miracle; here Christ causes death, shame,
cursing be immediate organs and instruments of life, glory, immortality and
honor. 2. Christ was never weaker and lower then now, and never more glo^ious
in his working, Esai. 63.2. Wherefore are thou red in thy apparel, and thy
garments like one that treads in the wine fat? R^v. 19.15. he himself was
trodden on in the wine press, and fierceness, and wrath of Almighty God? but
Esa. 63.1. he is glorious in his apparel and travelleth in the greatness of
his strength; so in his lowest condition, when he is shamed, he is glorious;
when he is weak and lying on his back, he walks and walks in the greatness
of his strength; from the baseness of the instruments, in excellent works, we
collect that there must be a high, noble and excellent cause, who acts on
these instruments: 3. Agents work according to the distance they are to that
they wo^k upon; a shot afar off is weaker. Now on the cross, 1. Christ is
nearer to us, and so gets a heartier lift of us; death and blood are near
of kindred to us; 2. Christ coming so near death, has a fairer shot and visie
of death, and the grave, and Hell, and all our enemies, Heb 2.14, 15. He dyed
that by death he might destroy him that had the power of death.

1. Drawing when he is on the Cross, does most extol Christ's love: Christ in
drawing sinners in his death, draws, 1. Lovingly, 2. Suffering pain, 3.
Strongly, 4. completely, 5. Finally, dying and drawing,
death parts company amongst men, and often parts loves; but Christ dying
draws his Church into his bosom and heart, as not willing that the grave
should part them and him Ioh. 14.1. Christ having loved his own, that were in
the world, to the end he loved them: Christ dyed loving, and dyed drawing.

2. The cords of love with which he draws sinners, were woven and spunne, in
all their threads and twistings, out of the bowels and heart of Christ, out of
his blood, death, and pain; though it be sweet to Christ to draw, yet its
laborious and and painful to Christ. It cost Christ a pained back, and holed
sides, and pierced hands and feet, an head harrowed with thorns and a bleeding
body, and a bruis^d soul to draw sinners; he drew while he did bleed again,
he dyed under the work.

3. All the bones of all mankind that have been, are, or shall be, all the
strength of Angels in one arm could not have drawn one sinner out of Hell. But
O the strength of the merits of his lifting upon the Cross^! one sinner is as
heavy as hell, as a mountain of Iron; what burden must it be to Christ to
have millions of souls and all their sins hanging on him? What strength of
love to draw the weight of so many sinners,
He carried on his body on the tree, so many millions of sinners, and drew up
after him so many thousand redeemed ones, as would have made the world to
crack, the whole earth to groan and cry for pain like a sick woman in
childbirth pain.

4. The white and red in a flower or rose contempered together, make up a
beautiful color and pleasant to the eye; 1. Love in Christ; 2. Lowliness; 3.
And singular care to save, made up a sweet mixture ^n Jesus that flower of
Iesse, to draw strongly sinners to him. See a Father carrying seven or eight
children on his back; through a deep river, he binds them all in his garment
that none of them fall in the water, he leanes on his staff; how does he with
advised choice and ele^^ion order every step, that he s^eme not to them to slip
or fall? and he cries comfort over his shoulder to them, Fear not, Christ and
all his in his bosom did wa^le strongly through all the sl^uds of his
suffering.
be not dismayed, I will present you safe on dry land: so Christ with all his
children, great jesus Christ had his offspring laped up in his merits, and did
wade through the floods of death and hell and the curse of the Law with
redeemed ones in his arms crying, Fear not worm Jacob, be not dismayed: I will
help thee, the fl^nds shall not drown thee; and for his own condition, his
faith was that he should safely swim through the Sea, and the mighty waters of
all his deepest sufferings, and that he and his mystical body (for Christ was
a public surety, not one private man in this case) should shore on the land of
prayse^, and this is above all doubting, when he says, Esai. 50.7. For the
Lord God will help me, Loving and drawing sinners Christ's last work in his
deathbed.
therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a
flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed; and then Christ had a most
watchful and prudent care, Esa. 52. that not one pin, not one wheel in the
work of our salvation should miscary, but all should go right, nothing
neglected, in doing, comforting, preaching, praying, suffering, sweating,
weeping, believing, hoping in patience, in being shamed, spitted on, scourg^d,
accused, railed on, traduced, condemned, belyed, pained, crucified between two
Thieves, buried in a sinners grave; there was not one hole, one want, one
stumble, one slip in all or any thing, but the work was whole entire and
perfectly finished to Gods satisfaction, Esa. 53.11. Luke 22.37. Ioh. 19.30.

5. That drawing of sinners to Christ was his last work in his deathbed and
departure out of this life, cries that he was desirous to lie in one grave
with his Spouse the Lambs wife, and dyed enclosed in an union with Saints; it
says also, O how admirable was his love! and that love was Christ's last work
in this life, he dyed of no other sickness but love, love, love was Christ's
death-work, Christ's Testament, Christ's winding sheet, Christ's grave, he took
his Bride lapped in his love and heart to Paradise with him, his last breath was
love. The myrrh, when it is withered has the same smell (and a sweeter) that
it had while it was g^een. Christ that bundle of myrrh that lies all the
night between the Churches breasts, when withered and dead, smelled of love,
for he opened the graves and raised the dead, and took a repenting sinner to
Paradise with him, which are acts of great love; its considerable that he is
at one time a dying, a drawing and a loving Saviou^; and ask what was Christ's
last act on earth, its answered, he dyed in the very act of loving, and drawing
sinners to his heart.

Use, We are engaged to love him, and if so, to keep his commandments, and to
draw him after us; his own image, ho^inesse in the Saint^ takes Christ, and
causes him fall in love with us, Cant. 4.9. Thou have ravished my heart, my
sister, my Spouse, thou have ravished my heart, with one of thine eyes, with a
chain of thy neck; Its much love that ravishes Christ; y^a it so overcomes
him, that he professes its above him, he must desire his Spouse to look
away, Cant. 6.5. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me,
Cant. 7.5. The king is held in his galleries; holiness make^ our king, the
Lord Jesus a captive, for eternity he will delight to see the Lambs wife his
bride, when she shall be decked up with endless glory; Be holy, and the
king shall desire your beauty; engage Christ more to love you, deck your selves
with chains, with bracelets, be attired in raiment of needle work, the braver
in this apparel you are, ye are the lovelier to Christ, the wedding garment
makes you fair to the king; put on the crown of grace on your head, and be
highly beloved of this Prince.

Ver. 33. Now this he spoke signifying what death he should dye.

The last article in Christ's draw^ng of sinners, is the exposition of the
Evangelist John, who opens to us the sense of Christ's words, to wit, what was
meant by Christ's lifting up from the earth; for it is not an ordinary phrase to
express dying on the cross; therefore says John he meaned by his lifting up
from the earth, the kind and manner of his death, to wit, that he should be
crucified, and dye the shameful and ignominious death of the cross; it would
seem that the exposition of John may be referred to the whole verse, 32. What
is the sense of this? If Christ be lifted up he will draw all men up to him,
What it is to be lifted up from the earth.
that is, if he be crucified, by that shameful and painful death and the
merito thereof he will draw all men to him, and translate them from the
kingdom of darkness to the state of saving grace, which is true in it self,
but seems not to be the sense of the words.

1. Because the Evangelists use to expound what may appear ambiguous to the
hearers, as Ioh. 7.8.39. But this he spoke of the Spirit, ^oh. 20.23. Then went
this saying abroad among the Brethren, that that disciple (John) should not
dye: yet Jesus said not to him, he shall not dye: So Matthew. 2.16.17, 18. But
that Christ draws sinners by his death, was not so much controverted; for to
come to Christ, to believe in Christ, to be drawn to Christ, were Phrases
obvious enough, and known to all.

2. It is most pertinent to the text, that lifting up from the earth, which is
ambiguous, and may seem to allude to Elias his being carried up to heaven,
should be expounded by Chri^^s manner of death, to wi^, by crucifying.

3. Because the holy Ghost expounds not the connection of the conditional
proposition, If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men after me,
which he must do, if the sense go thus; but only speaks of the kind and
nature of Christ's death, which was known to the ^ewes to be both shameful and
cursed; but in his exposition he speaks nothing of the fruit of Christ's death,
but of the kind and manner of death.

Now that the Evangelist expounds the sense of Christ's words, what he meaned,
by being lift up from the earth, it holds forth to us a necessity that the
Lord speak plain language to us in scripture, and that one scripture expound
another.

In finding the meaning of scripture, these considerations may give light.

1. The Scripture in the plainest expressions is dark, that is, The Scripture
plain.
high and deep in regard of the matter which is deep; high, above the reach
of reason, and yet the language plain, obvious easy, that a virgin shall be a
mother, the ancient of days a young sucking infant; that through one man,
death dug a hole in the world, and sin passed on all; through a second Man
life and heaven entered again; The matter of the Scripture deep and high but
the Scripture is not obscure as Papists say.
are high and deep mysteries, yet is not the Gospel obscure, as Papists say.

2. In mere historical narrations and prophecies foretelling the wars of the
Lamb, the Dragon and the Beast, the Antichrist, their persuing the woman in
traveling in birth, to bring forth a man child, the matter subject is not
profound, nor deep, yet the expressions are dark and covered, while the works
of the Lord be a key to open his word; Here Is the wisdom of God, that in
deep and high mysteries necessary for salvation, the Lord is plain, and lower
and easier stories are foretold more darkly; articles of faith are not set
down in dark and enigmaticall prophesies, but plainly, whereas histories of
things to come are more mysteriously proposed.

3. The Scripture in no place is in the popish sense dark, that is, that we are
not to take any sense for the word of life, and the object of our faith, but
that which the Church gives as the sense, in regard the Scripture is a nose of
wax, with equal propension to contradictory senses, except the mistress of our
faith, the witch of Babel expound it, and then it is for such formally the word
of God, as she expounds it.

4. The holy Ghost the Author of Scripture has concreated with the words, the
true native sense, which all the powers on earth cannot alter.

Then when we swear a covenant with the Lord in plain easy country
language, not devised of purpose to be ambiguous or to hold forth that all
sects, Antinomians, Socinians, Arminians, Prelati^all halters, Anabaptists,
Seekers, etc. may salve every one his own way, and his (...), what he thinks
good; to obtrude any authoritative interpretation on this covenant, which it
holds not forth in its own simple words, to the reader, is the greatest
tyranny and equivocating juggling in the world, and we may easily distinguish
and dispute our selves out of a good conscience, or rather confess we had
never any intent to keep it, or acknowledge it was our sin we did swear it, and
because unlawful, it obliges us not.

When we accuse the scripture of darkness, we would but snuf the Sun, and
blow at it with a pair of bellows, to cause it shine more brightly. But the
mischief is, that we either charge our souls beyond their stint, We accuse
the Scripture as hard because it lies not level with our lusts.
thinking to compass that world of the de^pe wisdom of God with our shor^
fingers, or we stumble at the wisdom of the Scripture, because it is
eccentrick to, and compl^es not with our lusts; and here is a deep not seen;
God intends to carry Pharaoh and blinded reprobates to hell, through the wood
of his mysterious works and word, they being blinded and hardened and they
intend the same, but in another notion; God aims at the same end materially
with them, but God levels at the glory of his own unviolable justice; they
level at the word, the works of God to flatter their lusts, and take up a plea
with both from the womb.

What death he should die.

Two things offer themselves to our consideration. Christ's dying and his kind
o^ death he died.


1. Christ's dying, 2. The kind of his death, What death he should dye.
Christ came into the world with as strong intention to dye as to live, and to
be a pained, an afflicted man, as to be a man. In Christ's dying these
considerations have place.

1. The love of man can go no farther then death, greater love then this has
no man, 1 Consideration.
that a man should give his life for his friends, Ioh. 15.13. For this Love can
go no farther then the living Lover; now he cannot go one ^eppe beyond
death; Christ's love went to death and beyond it.
Christ went on to the first and second death, so far as to satisfy justice:
love is like lawful necessity, neither of them can live, when God is
dishonored. Christ's love burnt and consumed him, till he dyed; love followed
and persued his lost Spouse through the land of death, through Hell, the grave,
the c^^ses of an angry God, though Christ's love was both ancienter then his
manhood, and survived his death; love was of longer life in Christ, then his
life as man, this Sun of love bu^nes hard down from heaven to this day.

2. It was a hard law that Christ subjected himself unto; 2 Consideration.

Christ must love and will to die.


that die he must; Heaven, Angels, the World could not save his life; This
fa^re ^ose had life and greenesse in abundance, and yet it must wither; this
fountain of heaven had Sea's of waters, yet dried up it must be; this beauty
of highest glory was full and vigorous, yet it must fade; the Lilly of the
excellentest Paradise that cast Rays of glory and Majesty over the four
corners of the Heaven of Heavens, and out-shadowed Angels, Men, and the large
circuit of the whole Creation, must find its death-moneth, and must cast its
fair and timely bloome: The love of loves must become pale and droup, that
fire of love, that warmes Angels and men, must become cold; and there was
strong and invincible necessity; thus it must be (...), Matthew. 26.54. Christ
must die, Mar. 8.31. the Son of man must suffer many things, Luke 22.27. For
I say unto you (says Christ) that that which is written must have an end in
me. Ioh. 3.14. The Son of man must be lifted upon the Cross. Christ could not
pass to heaven another way; death was that one inevitable pass that he
behoved to go through; there was no passable foord in the river but one;
Christ behoved to take the only strait pass between Earth and H^aven.
there was but one strait pass and fort between Christ and his Father, his
glory and a saved Church, and justice kept this pass. Christ must lay out
himself, his life, blood, estate and glory for his Church to gain this fort,
and save his people from their sins. The Law laid it on him; 2. Love laid it
on him: 3. Our necessities and everlasting perishing burdened him.

3. Might not the dead all wonder? there was never before nor after, 3*
Consideration.

A wondering in the creatures to see Christ their Creator in death suffer such
hardship.


nor never shall be such a Christ amongst the dead as the Lord of life; all
these in the dust could say, O life, what do thou here among the dead! the
worms and clay might say, O Creator can thou lie near to us! Would not the
fountains be offended, that they could not have leave to furnish a draught of
cold water to their Creator, who made the the Seas and the Rivers, and divided
Jordan with his Word? would not life it self grieve at such a dispensation,
that it could stay and lodge no longer in the body of the Lord of life, but
behoved to be gone and leave the Prince of life, to fall, that he could not
stand on his own feet? was not bodily strength discontented, that sweet Jesus
complained, Psalm. 22.15. My strength is dried up like a Pot-shard, ver. 17. I
may tell all my bones. Would not joy and beauty take it ill that sweet Jesus
was a sad Savior, and his face foul with weeping, and his fair countenance
that was like Lebanon, all marred, and our lovely Redeemer was put to his knees
to pray with strong cries and tears? Esai. 52.14. Heb. 7.5. If there had been
sense and reason, in all the Purples, Silks, Fleeces, wool, fine linnins that
ever the earth had, they would think themselves unhappy, that they could not
cover the holy body of the Redeemer of men and their Creator, when he
complained, Psalm. 22.18. They part my garments among them, and cast lo^s on my
Vesture.

^ Consider.
4. It was to much in regard of our deservings, that the Lord of life should
descend to a natural life, to be under the ^owly condition of base clay;
Reason would say Christ's body should be precious as the Sun.
but that this tent of clay, that the Lord was to dwell in, should be of the
finest and most precious earth that can be, would seem reason; it might be
said, it were fitting for the glory of the Godhead united in a personal union
with the Man Christ, that the body of the Son of God should be above pain,
weakness or the Law of death, that it should be more glorious then all the
pearelesse and precious stones of the earth; yea, then the Sun in the
Firmament; yea, but Esai. 53.2. he has no form, nor comeliness, and when we
shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. But this was
incomparable condiscension of love that the Lord would take his own death upon
him, and assume the manhood of sick, weak, pained, sad, sighing and dying clay,
Esai. 53.4. Surely he has born our sicknesses, and carried our sorrows.

5. If there be any that ever tasted the sweet of life, it being the most noble
and desirable of created beings, 5 Consider.
if it were from a glorious Angel to a poor gnat or a base worm, they keep
possession of life with all their desire; It is much that Christ should part
with the sweatest inheritance of a living man his life.
they will part with all things, men even with teeth and skin, ere they quit
their life, Job 2.4. The more excellent life is, they struggle the more to keep
it; a young man will do more then an old man for it; and the old man who ha^
but a chip of life, the dregs of it, or the hundredth part of an hand-breath,
the twentieth part of an inch, yet holds it so long as there is so much as the
fourth part of a dram of natural vigorin him; Now Christ had cause to love his
life, as any man else. It was about the flower of his age, the thirty three
year of this life; and it must be a noble life, that dwelt personally with the
Godhead; yet when he was called to a treaty for rendering his life, he gave
it not up, but upon princely and honorable quarters, even that he should see
his seed, have a noble prize, and a ransomed spouse, a fair crown, a rich
Kingdom to mystical Christ, but he parted with his noble and glorious life
deliberatly, intentionally, most willingly, Ioh. 10.18. there was more will,
more love in Christ dying, then in the dying of all men from the creation to
the last judgment; O how he thirsted and longed to pay that Ransom, he had it
by him, to give it out on demand; he did not first die, and bow his head, but
he first bowed his head, and beckened with his hand, and called upon death, and
then rendered his Spirit.

6. O what a wonder, this rose of life on the Cross withers in his full
beauty, 6 Consider.
the Sun of life would shine no more on it. The prime delight of the Sons of
men, the second Adam from Heaven fades, and life can breath no more, and beauty
shine no more, and green^sse blossom no more; and when most lowly and low,
clothed with a curse, most lovely, most Lordly and Princely, because in the
act of Redeeming.

7 Consideration including other three. Christ's death comes under a three old
notion.
7. Christ's death must come under a threefold notion: 1. At a torment inflicted
by Gods enemies: 2. As a punishment inflicted of God or sin, as a Ransom
pa^^ to justice: 3. As the crown and and of Christ's journey.

In the first notion, Christ's death as coming from wicked men, wanted three
ingredients, that all the wicked world and Hell could not give it: 1. All the
world cannot add a curse to the death of any man, Three ingredients in Christ's
death which men could not give: 1. The Cu^se: 2. Infinite merit: 3 Divine
acceptance.
God only is the Master and Lord of cursing and blessing: God cast this in from
heaven of his own, for 2 Cor. 5.21. God made him sin, Esai. 53.6. Jehovah,
the Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all. Who said that, Cursed be every
one that abides not in all that is written in the Law to do it, Gal. 3.10.13.
Deuteronomy. 21.23. Deuteronomy. 27.26? the only Lawgiver who can dispense curses, he made
Christ's death a curse: One death has not a curse more then another, and Christ's
death of the cross had not a Ceremonial curse only in it, for that was common
to the deaths of all that hangs on a tree, Deuteronomy. 21.23. But the curse of the
Moral Law which is upon the sinner, Deuteronomy. 27.26. Gal. 3.10* 13. was laid upon
Christ; and this is heavier then ten millions of deaths of the cross: O how
many thousands and what millions of talents weight of gall, and vengeance did
the Lord from heaven add to the cup of Christ? 2. Because Christ was made sin,
he behoved to be made the sinner, and from Christ's person his death had the
sweet perfume of infinite merit and a sweet smell of a savor of rest to God,
above all sacrifices and offerings that ever were offered to God, infiniteness
of merit, this Christ gave to his own death. 3. The Lord gave it a third
ingredient, that it had acceptance even in point of Law and Justice, which no
man could give; to feel a smell of everlasting love, peace, reconciliation in
blood, is the sure mercies of David; O but it was white blood to God, crying
blood, or rather singing blood that sings the sweet Gospel-song. Abels blood
cried a song of vengeance; ye are come to the blood of sprinkling (...), that
sounds better things then the blood of Abel, Heb. 12.24.

In the second notion that Christ came under the Law of dying ( for it is
appointed for all men to die) speaks much love* To come to sleep which is
deaths brother, to come under pain, weakness, bleeding, that are the near
bloud-friends of death, is great love expression. But to die, the lowest, and
the saddest and sowrest of bodily infirmities, and then for other men's faults,
it sets out the love of God.

In this respect Christ dying was a Ransom for justice; Four sad cond^tions
which were in the ransom^ that Christ gave for sinners.
there be four of the sadest things in a ransom that are here.

1. To give person for person is the hardest bargain; by the Law of Nations
they are meeker wars where moneys and gold may buy a captive. God in this
bargain could send captives away for neither silver, nor gold, nor any
corruptible thing, 1 Pet. 1.18. A gift a reward will not bow justice; Rubies,
Saphires, let ten earths be turned into gold of Ophir, 1. Gold for persons may
be given in ra^ome, but here person for person must be given.
they cannot buy the offended Law of God; therefore it must be man for man,
person for person or nothing, a man is more precious then gold.

2. If you must have man for man, then let proportion of common justice be
kept; a soldier for a soldier, a servant for a servant, a freeman for a
freeman, In ransom a servant is given for a servant, but here a King for a
servant.
a master for a master; ye cannot demand a King to ransom a servant: Yea,
(says justice) but I will; they are but men and slaves, and servants of sin;
their Father Adam was indeed a King, but by Law, he is fallen from the crown
and all his children are traitors and born servants; therefore justice would
have no less ransom then one of the Kings line, one of the blood royal; and
more, the only heir of the crown of heaven and earth, the King of Kings and the
Lord of Lords; he is more then an over-ransome and over-summe; this is hard;
but infinite wisdom cannot be against justice, but it was the strictest
justice that ever was, the Kings Son for the Traitors son, the Prince for
the Slave, the Lord of Lords for the poor c^ay-subject.

3. But the ransom King must have honorable conditions, like himself; if he
must be a captive, Here a King is not served as a King but as a servant.
let him have some freedom befitting his birth and condition; now because this
bargain was to be stretched out to the utmost line and border of strict justice
(as also it wanted not deepest mercy shining in glorious rays through justice)
therefore the King standing a ransom was as far below his place as a servant
is below a King, Phil. 2.6, 7. You have the lowest and the highest steps, who
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but
made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant: a
King and God made a servant, Matthew. 20.28. for even the Son of man came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many: See here
the Son of God a ransom in his own person, and the lowest of ransomes, a
servant, far below a King.

4. It is not universal in these persons that are given to ransom others,
Here the person given in ransom ^ust die.
but poor souls, if they be turned in servants, their life should be spared;
but Christ was such a ransom as must lay down his life for the captives,
Matthew. 20.28. No ransom can come lower then a man, and an innocent man's death:
If the captive be wounded and sickly, the man that goes a ramsome for him, by
no Law, should be sickly and wounded also: 1. It is not ordinary that he that
stands as a ransom for captives, should take their natural infirmities, their
body, sighs, sadness, sorrow, wants, and be like them in all things, but
Christ was like us in all things except sin: 2. And what greater hardship can
you put on a ransom captive then death? all these Christ did ^ndergoe for us.

The third and last consideration of Christ's death, is as it was the end of
Christ's journey, and all his labors in the flesh, and this I desire to be
considered in these repects.

1. As death is Christ's last enemy. 2. In the concomitants of it. 1. As in his
triumph of victory. 2. His welcome to his Father.

1. As death was Christ's last enemy, dying was to him as to man the last day
and moment of his week, when he entered into his Sabbath and rest, Death the
end of Christ's labors and his S^bbath.
and dyed never to die again; the world, and devils chased him into the grave,
and when he was there, he was in his own land, in Paradise, in a Kingdom:
Death was the wearied way-faring-mans home, the end of his race, and at this
place was the forerunners gold, his garland, and prize, even the glory set
before him, for the which he endured the Cross and despised shame, he then
sat down; it was Christ's landing port after his stormy sailing. 2. He had no
more to do: in the merit of redemption, in the way of satisfying justice; for
Christ's burial or lying in the grave was but his mora, his lodging all night
with death or a continuation of his death; when he dyed, all was finished, the
Law of God for satisfaction could crave no more: as the last enemy of the body
is death, 1 Cor. 15.26. so it was the head Christ's lasts enemy on earth: 3.
Heaven was Christ's place of refuge, his sanctuary and his asylum; when Christ
was in the other side of death and of time, he was in his castle, in his
strong Fort; enemies can neither besiege him nor take him, he cares not now for
the worlds feud, or for death or the grave, Revel. 1.18. There was no more law
against Christ after his soul was in Paradise; the believer has a perfect
acquittance of all crosses, when he is once in the land of glory.

2. There be two considerable concomitants in Christ's death: 1. His victory: 2.
His welcome: Christ's victory in death.
His victory was in his very act of dying, that death and the justice of a
divine law had their will of Christ, and could demand no more of him for all
engagements, and to answer the bill, but death and such a death it was a sort
of overplus and abundance of ransom to God, that death was put to the worse,
and could in justice never arrest any believer or Saint after Christ. O death,
what would thou have more! Or, what can thou demand in law? 2. Christ and
all his, l^gally were crucified, and dyed, and Christ and all his were not
destroyed under death, but Christ lived and all his with him, Ioh. 14.19. when
two strong enemies do conflict, and put out their strength one against another
to the full, and the one lives in his full strength, the other must be foiled.
Christ after death lived and can die no more, and is strong and omnipotent; now
death did all it could against Christ in that he dyed; then he must be the
Victor, and death the vanquished party; death was Christ's Land-port, his shore
after sad Sea-sailing, his last stage in which he posted to glory; and he came
into Paradise and his Fathers Kingdom, in a sweat of blood (and the Cross
accompanied him in over the threshold of the gates of heaven) so he was
welcomed, he, and all his feed (who then were legally in him) as one who had
acquitted himself bravely and honorably in the business that most highly
concerned the Lord, and the glory of all his blessed attributes, mercy,
justice, grace, wisdom, power, sovereignty, etc. There was a most joyful
acclamation in heaven, a welcome and embracing, and a hand-shaking (as we say:)
1. Between the Father and the Son, and this is a sweet medi^ation, Dan. 7.13.
I saw in the night visions, Christ welcomm^ ^^to G^d afte^ his death.
and behold one like the Son of man, came with the clouds of heaven, and came
to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him, ver. 14. And
there was given him dominion and glory, and a Kingdom, that all People and
Nations and Languages should serve him: Now who be these that brought Christ to
the Father when he ascended? who but the holy Angels his ministering Spirits or
servants; they attend his ascension to heaven, as the Estates of a King wait
on, and convey the Prince and Heir of a Crown, in his Coronation day, Heb.
1.6, 14. the Disciples, Act. 1.10. See two men in white apparel, at his
ascension; go up to heaven; sure there must have been a host of them, as
there were at his birth, and shall be at his second coming, and its little
enough that the Peers of Heaven, such a glorious Parliament of the High House,
bear the tail of his Robe Royal and attend to welcome to heaven their Lord
Creator, and their head Christ by whom they stand in Court, they are the
servants of the Bridgroome; it was much joy to them, when Christ returned a
triumphing Lord to heaven, having done all gloriously and completely. The
Father after his death made him a great Prince, and gave him a name above all
names, and set him at the right hand of the Majesty of God: 2. And if the Lord
shall say to sinful men, Well done, good servant, enter into the joy of thy
Lord; Far more, being infinitely satisfied with the travels and service of
his Son, he must say, Well done, well suffered, O Son of my love, enter into
the joy of thy Fathers soul: For the Fathers soul ever delighted in him, Esa.
42.1. 3. And to see the Father embrace his Son in his arms after the
battles, and put the Crown on his Head, and set him down at his right hand and
exalt him as an eternal Prince for evermore, and accept all his labors, and
his faithful and most successful acquitting of himself, in all his offices,
as Redeemer, King, Priest, and Prophet, must be a joyful sight.

Use 1. No Believer take it ill to die; death sips at every blood, Comforts
against death because Christ dyed.
noble or low, and would but drink the blood of this celebrious and eminent
Prince of the Kings of the earth: 1. For besides, that God has stinted our
months, and the ship cannot pass farther then the length of the cable; here
is the matter, Christ for imputed sin, behoved to bleed to death: 2. Only
Enoch and Elias were reprieved, by the prerogative of free grace; we are by
birth and sin, but some ounces or pieces and fragments of death and its
appointed for all men to die; there is more reason we should die then the Lord
of life; for life was essential to the Prince of life, but life is a stranger
to us; man is but man, but a handful of hot dust, a clay-vessell tunned up
with the breathing of warm wind that smoaks in and out at his nostrils, for a
inch of flietting away time. And sin adds wings to the wheels of his life,
and lays a Law of death on man, and if Christ had not come into this clay*
city, he had been under no law of death; he dies for us; then we should ^arre
rather have died, p^opter quod unumquodque tale, etc. Now because your Redeemer
laid his skin to death, and was willing to kiss death, believers are to
esteem of death as the cross that Christ went through, love the winding sheet
and the coffin the better, that they were the sleep-bed and night-clothes that
your Savior sleeped in. 3. And Christ had the more cause to be willing to die,
that he was little beholden to this life; it looked ever with a frowning face
on Christ: 1. The first morning salutation of this life when Christ was new
born, it boasted and threatened Christ with the cutting of his throat in the
cradle, and banishment out of his own land to Egypt: 2. He had good hap all his
life to sufferings, he had ever the wind on his fair face, and the smoke
blowing on his eyes, Christ had good hap to the Cross all his life.
as if his whole day had been a feast of tears and sorrow; yea, life and the
sad and glowing cross parted both together with Christ, as if the world had
sworn never to lend the Son of God one smile, or one glimpse of a glad hour.
3. Christ thought himself well away and out of the gate (as he fore-telleth,
when the people mourned for his death, Luke 23. ver. 28, 29, 30, 31.) before
the destruction that came on the City of Jerusalem, that killed many of the
Lord of the wine-yards servants, and at last killed the righteous heir. 4. You
may remember Christ message that he sent to Herod, Luke 13.32. I do ^uers to
day and to morrow, and the third day (...), I shall be perfected, Death
perfected Christ.
Heb. 2.12. It became him from whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salv^tion perfect
through sufferings, (...): Death made Christ perfect for the Lo^d put the fair
crown of Redemption on Christ's head with a very black hand; it was a black
boat-man that carried our Prince Jesus over the water to Paradise, but sweet
Jesus would have it his perfection, his crown, his glory to be swallowed up in
deaths womb for us. Its considerable that death perfecteth the head: 1. As a
Priest; he had been an unperfect sacrifice, if he had not dyed; and being
offered dead to God, Christ's dead corpse had an infinitely sweet smell in the
nostrils of a just God; never sacrifice, never burnt offering like this which
perfected all: 2. He had not been a perfect King and Conqueror, had he not
persued the enemy to his own land, and made the enemies land the seat of war,
and triumphed dead upon the cross. 3. He had not been a perfect Redeemer, had
he not dyed, and paid life for life: no satisfaction without death, no
remission of sins without blood, Heb. 10. but it was the heart-blood, and
blood with the life that was shed to God. Now these same befall the dying
Saints: 1. While the Saints are here they are from home, and not at their
Fathers fireside, and this world their Stepmother looks ever asquint on them,
Ioh. 16.33. And the cross gets a charge from God concerning a Saint, w^it on
him, as his keeper while he die, leave him not; the cross follows the house of
Christ and all the children of the house, its kindly to all the second Adams
seed, it is an in-come by year that follows the stock: The Cross kindly to
the Saints.
every child may in his suffering say my father the Prince of ages even the
head of the house, my brother Jesus, and all our kine were sufferers: the sad
cross runs in a blood to us, Psalm. 34.19. Matthew. 19.24. This is not our home,
1 Timothy 2.12.
I would I were ashoare, and at home, in my Fathers house.

2. The Lord takes the righteous away from the ill to come, Esai. 57. When
Christ was taken away, vengeance came to the full on the jews, The Saints
out-runne crosses.
when he was in heaven. Christ's followers, that die, out-runne many Crosses, as
we see a man upon his life chased by his enemies, gets into a strong house and
with speed of foot wins his life; sad days pursue the Saints and they escape
to their Castle, before the affliction can reach or overtake; there be some
cruces posthume late-borne crosses, calamities and ill days that come on the
posterity of the godly, the Lord closes their eyes that they never see them.
The grave is a house the Devil and the World and aff^ictions cannot besiege;
sure when a Saint is in heaven, he is beyond Doomesday, death, and tears, he
defies the malignants of this world then, and the wars and blood that his own
brethren can raise against him.

3. What shall we say, that as Christ thought himself maimed, and he wanted a
piece, or an arm or leg of a Savior and a perfect Redeemer till he dyed, and
then when he dyed he was perfected; indeed our redemption had been lame and
unperfect, had not Christ dyed; and his escape through death and the land of
darkness the grave to his Fathers old crown that he had with him befere the
world was, The life we have, is lame so long as we want our life hid up with
Christ in God.
was a perfecting of Christ: 1. So dying to a Saint is the Sun rising, the
morning birthday of eternity, the opening of the prisoners door, the
Coronation-day, the marriage-night: 2. He is ever a lame man, he wants
incomparably his best half, so long as he wants Christ in a fruition of glory;
all the traveling and way-fairing men in their journey toward heaven are but
sick men, for sickness is but a lamenesse of life, a want of so many degrees
as make up a perf^ct life (because good health is but the flower and perfection
of life) and the only perfect life Col. 3. ver. 3.4. is the life of glory; then
all the Saints yet wanting the life of heaven, must be crazie, weak, groaning
men, not healthy in a spiritual consideration, while they be in heaven: 3.
When a Saint dies, he but takes an essay of the garment and robe of glory
(though death make it seem strait and pinching) and enters in the joy of his
Lord, Rev. 14.13. There is both Word and Writ, and from a land where there can
be no lies, from heaven, blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, that they
may rest from their labors, (...) that the travelers may over-rest, or
exceedingly breath, and refresh or comfort themselves after much toil and
sweating in the way; therefore is death, 2 Timothy 4.6. (...) an unfolding of the
net, or of the tent, that the man may go out, or a taking up the burden and
laying it down in another Inn, or a loosing the cabels of ships to sail, or
an untying of cords of a tabernacle to go to a choycer place.

Use 2. From Christ's dying we learn to die to sin, and live to him that dyed
for us, 1 Pet. 2.24. Romans 6.2, 6. 2 Cor. 5.15. Mortification to this goodly and
God-like Idol the World, is a special lesson of the death of Christ, Gal.
6.14. It is a great distance and many miles about and off the roade-way to
heaven to go through such a thorny, thick, and bushy-wood of honors, riches,
pleasures wordly, its a shorter and easier way to stand at a distance from the
silken and golden creature, and despise the fairest created excellencies that
fill both sides of the Sun. Antinomians would have us rest satisfied with a
moral mortification, Real Mortifica^ion required and the moral mortifca^ion
and sa^cti^ication of A^^i^mians, as if ^t were enough that Christ dyed for us,

and the body thereof on the Cross, and there is an end, and that we are

mortification, and that we are to be holy as he is holy, perfect as he is
perfect; that is, a new covenant command, Genesis 17.1. That we should walk before

justifies the sinner, or of holy walking as a fruit and witness of our faith
and justification obliges these that are in Christ, as if, in regard of any
Scripturall command of law or Gospel, we might live as we list, and follow the
inspiration and leading of a lawless spirit separated from all word either Law
or Gospel, either commanding or conditionally promising or threatening. We are
not so to live after flesh in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine,

Use 3. We have rich consolation, from the Article of Christ's dying; the
sinners debts are paid, his band and the hand-writting of blood, and eternal
vengeance is cancelled, and taken out of the way; the gates of the p^ison
broken, and the prisoners brought out, by the blood of the everlasting
Covenant, 1 Pet. 2.24. with his stripes we are healed, Esai. 53.5. The
chastisement of our peaces, or treaties of peace, as the word bears were upon

is a mark of a wound where blood and humors are neighboured together, it
leads us to this that the only medicine of sick and dead sinners, was that
which is sickness, pain, swellings from nails in hands and feet to Jesus
Christ. Christ the Physicians pain was our case, his wounds the healing and
cover^ng of our wounds with his skin, and his death the life of sinners; to
visit the sick and help him at his bed side with consell and art is favor, but
its physic of grace, not of nature, that the Physician should be the sick man,
the pained, the groaning and dying Patient^, and lie down in his bed, and make
his life and blood, and medicine to cure our diseases and wounds; In a
Law-challenge the believer is so freed from eternal wrath, that if Satan and
conscience say, Thou art a sinner and under the curse of the Law, he can say,
its true, I am a sinner, but I was hanged on a tree and dyed, and was made a
curse in my head and Law-surety Christ, and his payment and suffering is my
payment and suffering.

Sin sweet; suffering for (...) sad and so^er to Christ.
Use 4. Sin is a sad debt, the Law is a severe crave^: 1. Its pastime to a
fool to sin: it is no pastime nor sport to Christ to satisfy for sin. 2.
There is as much justice and vengeance in the Gospel, as in the Law; the
Gospel-suffering for our sin was as salt and sour to Christ as the Law
vengeance would have been to us. The Lord never minded that any should bear
sin, either by acting or suffering gratis, and at an easy rate. 3. Will ye
not read bloody justice persuing sin on the blew stripes and scarlet wounds,
on innocent Jesus back and sides, his head and hands and fe^t? will ye young
men, Eccles. 11.9. laugh and sin, and must Christ weep and shout and cry for
pain, when he suffers for sin? Sinners ye have merry days in your lusts, O
but it was a doleful and a wearisome time to Christ to pay for sin. The
drunkard sings and drinks, when Christ answers his bill he sighs. Solomon,
Eccles. 2. in the days of his vanity sought to give himself to wine, ver. 3.
to lay hold on folly; and ver. 10. and what ever his eyes desired he withheld
not from them, he kept no joy from his heart. But Christ had a sad night in the
garden, O but he had a heavy soul, when with tears and strong cries, he
prayed, when justice squeazeth a sweat of blood out of Christ's body, and he
looks like sorrow and sadness it self dying, and b^eeding, and crying My God,
my God, why have thou forsaken me: never mothers son after this, make a sport
of sin, or sin with good will and delight.

What death, (...), what quality or kind of death, he was to dye. The three
special qualities of Christ's death. 1. Pain. 2. Shame. 3. A Curse.



The quality and kind of Christ's death is most remarkable; for three
characters were printed and engraven on the death of the Cross which Christ
dyed.

1. Pain. 2. Reproach and shame. 3. The Curse of God and man*

The pain in Christ's death comes under a twofold consideration: 1. Naturally:
2. Legally; the nature of the death was painful, for death of it self is
painful; no man pays that debt with ease and nature smiling and sporting: die
who will, it will cost you of your flesh; when Asa dies, The pain of Christ's
death and ^he causes of it.
he cries, ah my feet; when David dies, he complains, O my cold body; the
Shunamites child, ah my pained head; Vzzah, Oh my lep^ous skin; do not pamper
nor idolize your body; if wicked men have not one band or coard in their death*
but steal down to the grave in a moment beside deaths knowledge, yet they pay
dear for it, Job 24.20. The worms shall feed sweetly on them; life is a great
pearl* But there be three things besides, that made the death of Christ
painful. 1. Violence. 2. Slownesse of dying. 3. Many degrees of life taken
from him.


Violence, it is to die of any disease or of pain: 1. But when five or six
deaths do all start equally at one land-port, and at one race, and strive which
of them shall dispatch the poor man soonest, the pain is the more; ye know
the complaint of our blessed Savior, Psalm. 22.16. They pierced my hands and my
feet, and Ioh. 19.34. one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and
forthwith came there out blood and water: Many deaths at once on Christ.
here by Scripture, be five deaths, that invade a living man, death on every
hand, and death on every leg, and death on his side; though this last came a
little too late; the Soldiers had no law to pierce his side, but to make sure
work he should be dead, by a sort of chance to men, which yet sweetly was
subservient to the decree of God and the Prophecies; Christ was thus served. 2.
Now a violent death it must be when strong and great nails did pierce the most
nervous parts of his body, his hands and his feet; one Iron wedge thrust in at
his left pape, to pierce his heart, or to pierce through the temples of the
head would quickly have dispatched him. 2. As for the slownesse of his death,
four leasurely and slow violent deaths to cause him to bleed to death were
hard: the word says the blood is the life of the living creature; then look
how long his blood was coming out, his life was dropping out as long. They
say, the death of the Cross will keep a man aliv with his life in on the
Cross, above three or four hourese the man dying and yet cannot die; these
languishing deaths procuring a cruel favor such as is deaths slow pace, and
yet quick torment, are images of hell, where men seek death, but cannot find
it, because death sleeth from them.

2. The lentnesse of death is much when death is divided into four quarters;
The l^ntnesse and slownesse of death when its on its j^ur^ey, (...).
death at every hand, and at every foot makes the pain greater; when the
weight and trunck of Christ's living body lifted up from the earth, hangs upon
four paining and tormenting pillars, the Lords pierced hands and feet; as if
death had delighted to hold Christ long at Sea, and denied him the last sad
service. 3. And Christ had been before dying a terrible death in the garden,
when he had been see^hed and boiled in a blood of sweat, and two circumstances
evidence that the two Theives death was nothing in slownesse of torment
comparable to Christ's death: 1. The sad and direful Prefaces and preparatories
to Christ's death, as he was in the night before in a soul death in the garden
and in a sweat of blood there trickled out of his body down upon the ground
(...) as it were drops great hailstones of blood frozen or h^ardened together
as Stephanu^ thinks, through extreme terror; he was scourged against all Law
and crowned with thorns: 2. And so was he weakened in body as he was not able
to bear his own cross; it was his own complaint, Psalm. 22.17. I may tell all
my bones, what ever the story of passion say, how Christ could have been so
lean in twen^y and four hours, its evident he complains his ^^rength was
dried up like a pot-sheard, and that death was more painful to Christ then to
these tha^ dyed the same death; yea, Christ began to die the night before; he
was then under violent death of soul and body above* the hours that he was
on the Cross, when others are long tormented with pain, that pain is rather
the forerunner of death, then death; for death stays but a moment in doing
that sad service in bringing the soul out, but death all this time twenty
four hours was acting upon Christ, both the second death, the Lords anger and
curse being on him, Christ did suffer many deaths.
and then bodily pain with the curse of the law all this time wrought upon
him. Some say gall and vinegar were given to men to be crucified to make them
less sensible of that extreme pain. And consider his death legally, may we
not say, as Christ in bearing the pains of the second death did suffer that
which all the Elect should have sustained in their souls for ever so Christ did
bear many millions of bodily deaths? it may be a question, if Christ's suffering
for Peter be Christ's suffering for David; for sure Peter's sins and David's sins
together, are more then David's sins alone, and if on Christ the Lord laid the
iniquity of us all, ^sai 53.6. it must be a greater punishment, then if the
Lord had laid the iniquity o^ some few, one or two upon Christ; say that the
Elect were three millions of rede^med ones, as we cannot de^erm^ne the number,
sure thi^ must be a sadder death, then if Christ had dyed but for ten men; it
is true, it was an infinite pain in regard of the one infinite person that did
bear our iniquiti^s, yea, and so subjective it was an infinite love with which
in election and free redemption Christ followed all the Elect of God withal,
Many l^ves t^rm^natively from Christ on a^l the Elect* but o^e l^ve in him
subject^vi^y.
but terminative as his love is bounded on sundry persons, Paul speaks of it as
if there had been not one man loved but himself, Gal. 3.20. Christ loved me,
and gave himself for me. Though the Lord Jesus passed in one bill, the
election and redemption of all the family of the first born, yet every soul
has a white stone, and a new name, that no other elect man knows, but he
himself; as every flower, every rose, every meadow and several garden has its
several rays, beams, and comfort, and vigor of hear from the Sun, yet all
these rays and beams are but one in the Suns body; so though Christ dyed
but on death for all the Elect, yet in the hight of pain it was many de^ths to
him.

3. Again, consider how much of life Christ had, the removing of it by
violence must be so much the more painful; life natural had in Christ a sweet
and peaceable dwelling, The sweeter that Christ's life was, the lo^^e of it wa^
the more.
the possession of life was with excellent deligh^s, like a tree growing on the
bank of a sweet river of oil, wine and honey; it was planted beside the
glorious Godhead pers^nally, and had sweet company, and that made it pleasant;
the more beautiful, pleasant, and green the flower of less was, the more
violence and pain it was to hew down this delitious tree of life, and to cut
him out of the land of the living; it had not been so much to cut down a
thistle or a thorn tree, or to take away the life of a common man, whose life
is not privileged with grace and the grace of a personal union with God; yea,
the destroying of the life of an Angel, could never have been such violence.
And then its considerable that Christ was not suffered to go to the grave
without blood, and that his skine, his winding sheet, were bespotted with
blood. Christ paid not this sum quickly, as many die; its true, there was more
will and love infinitely in his blood, then violence and pain, every stream
of blood flowing in a channel of love; and its also sure the soul and the
Godhead were not separated, but the precious life of Christ was expelled, and
that by a bloody death, out of a sweet Paradise, and death was a rough, sad and
thorny journey to Christ; weapons of Iron on hands and feet came against the
Lord to fetch the soul out of the body.

2. Shame.

The second character engraven on Christ's death was shame and reproach, in
which consider 1. How shame could be on Christ dying. 2. What sh^me was on him.
3. How it stood with his honor as King.


1. Shame, is taken either fundamentally in the cause, or formally; sin and
sin acted by men against the Law of God is the only foundation of shame, How
Christ was not capable of sham^.
when the people fell in idolatry, Exodus 32.25. Aaron made the people naked to
their shame; so when Tamar disswads her brother from incest, 2 Samuel 13.13. she
says, and I, whether shall I cause my shame to go? and as for th^e, thou
shall be as one of the fools of Israel. Shame and sin are of one blood; for
sinning is a shameful reproaching of the crea^ure; and thus, Christ was no
more capable of shame, nor of sin; for he had done no violence, neither was
there any guile in his mouth. Christ-man came out of the womb clothed with a
precious white Robe of innocence and abundance of grace, Isa. 53.9.
he never contracted one black spot on that fair Robe of the highest image of
God, from the womb to the grave; and so there was no shame, but fundamentally
glory in Christ all his life; but there is shame formally in sin; and that:
1. Which we call thinking of shame or being ashamed actively: How Christ was
capable of shame.
2. In bearing of shame passively. In the former consideration; because sin
is a shameful thing in self, Ier. 11.13. Ye set up Altars to that shameful
thing, even Altars to burn incense to Baal; there is an internal blushing and
shame rising from sin, when the sinner, if the conscience through a habit of
sin be not turned brazen and hard, thinks ill of sin and esteems it self
base in doing ill; Romans 6.21. What fruit had ye then of these things whereof
ye are now ashamed? Adam and Eve were not ashamed before they sinned: now
Christ man had this ingenuity which Heathens called half a virtue;
shamefastness or a power to think ill of sin. Christ of himself (though he
could not sin, as Adam had a power, before the fall to pity and commiserate
the sick and miserable, though there was no formal object for that power before
men sinned) could think it of sin. Christ (I say) thought ill of sin, and
esteemed the creature base in sinning; Heathens said virtue was of a red
blushing color; and the Scripture condems the shamelessness of sinners that
are not abased themselves, for sin and cannot be ashamed; so the Lord
burdens his people with this Ier. 3.3. And thou had a whores forehead, thou
refusedst to ashamed, Heb. to blush, Esai. 3.9. The show of their countenance
(that cannot blush at sin) does witness against them, and they declare their
sin as Sodom, How shame passively w^e in Christ.
they hid it not. Zeph. 3.5. But the unjust knows no shame. In this, Christ
our Lord, (to come to the second point) being our surety though he could not be
ashamed of any sin he did himself, for that he never sinned, yet being made
sin for us, he did did bear the shame of our sin. And so Christ was not
free of shame passively, as it is a punishment of sin; for it is penal evil
of the creature, Dan. 12.2. Many that sleep in the dust shall awake some to
shame and everlasting contempt. Ezech. 32.24. Elam and all her multitude are
slain -- they have born their shame, with them that go down to the pit. That
which is penal in shame, the Lord Jesus did bear; he says of himself, Esai.
50.6. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the
hair, I hid not my face from shame and spiting, Heb. 12.2. He endured the
cross, despising the shame; in these respects he did bear our shame; 1. That
he being the Lord of glory, and thought it no robbery to be equal with the
father, he abased himself to come so low as to be a man, and the lowest of
men, a servant, Phil. 2.6, 7, 8. Matthew. 20.28. and Esai. 49.7. Thus says the
Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his holy One to him whom man dispiseth, Hebr.
to one despised in soul, (...)
a contemned soul abhorred by the nation, to a servant of Lords: 2. All the
tokens of reproach and shame was on his suffering: As 1. In gestures, What
tokens of shame were on Christ.
the putting a crown of thorns on his head, and a Reed for a Scepter in his
hand, to scorn his Kingly power, saluting him with mocking and bowing the knee
to him: 2. In words, saying, Hail King of the Jews; a scorning his
Prophetical dignity, in blind-folding him and covering his face and saying,
Prophecy who is he that smot thee? and to deride his Prie^^hood, they put a
Roab on him, and when he is on the Cross and offering himself as our Priest,
in a sacrifice to God, all that passed by wagged their head, and shot out the
lip, saying he trusted in God, let God save him: then the spitting on his face,
in the Law was great shame, Deuteronomy. 25.9. the wife of the brother that would not
build his brothers house, did spit on his face; so Job complains, chap. 30.10.
that the children of fools and base men abhorred him, and spared not to spit
on his face. O but there is now much glory and beauty of glory on that face,
its more glorious then the Sun. 3. His death had a special note of shame,
the death of a robber and an ill doer; so it is called Christ's reproach, Heb.
13.13. Let us go forth therefore unto him, without the Camp, bearing his
reproach, or bearing his cross, which was a reproachful thing; for it is a
clear allusion to the manner of Christ's going out of the City of Jerusalem to
Mount Calvary bearing his own Cross; it was a reproachful thing to see the
Lord of glory bear shame on his back, and to behold Jesus going through the
City, out at the Ports of Jerusalem with a shameful Cross between his
shoulders, and all the children and boys and base ones of the City wondering
at him, and crying hue after him; O woe to Jerusalem when they shut Christ out
at their Po^ts, and will lodge him no longer, and woe to them that put that
shame on him, as to lay the reproachful and cursed Cross on his back, and no
man would bear it for him: And the suffering of Christ, Heb. 11.26. is called
the reproach and the shame of Christ, Psalm. 22.7. But I am a worm (...) no man
of note, the reproach, the manifest or published shame or reproach of Adam, of
frail men, the contempt of the people, the public disgrace or neglect of the
people. (...) publicavit, probris aftesi^.
Now the third particular is how could it consist with the glory of Christ as
King to be shamed. It is, I must confess, a strange expression, the Son of God
shamed, yet its Scripture expression, Heb. 12.2. Esai. 50.7. But such a shame
as they could put on Christ, may well stand with the personal union.

For 1. Shame as arising from the ill conscience o^ sin, they could not put
on Christ, Ier. 2.26. How shame c^uld con^^st with the dign^ty of Christ's
person.
As the Thief is ashamed, when he is found, so is the house of Israel
ashamed, They could not catch Christ in any sin and so though they shamed
him, he was not shamed, nor could he hide his face for confusion.

2. Shame is a breaking of the hope and confidence of these who look for great
things, as 2 Chronicles. 32.21. The Lord sent an Angel which cut off all the mighty
men of valor and the Leaders and Captains in the Camp of the King of Assyria:
So he returned, with shame of face, to his own land; and Esa. 30. Ye trust
(says the Lord) in the shadow of Egypt, ver. 3. Therefore shall the strength
of Pharaoh be your shame, ver. 5. They are all ashamed of a people that could
not profit t^em, nor be a help nor profit, but a shame and also a reproach: now
thus the confidence that Christ had in God could not be broken. God could not
fail Christ; his hope was ever green before the Sun: he said it, and it was
true Esa. 50.7. (Christ's faith and boldness in his father was as hard as
flint) for the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded,
therefore have I set my face as flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

3. But it is clear, in pulling off his garments and scourging him, so they
shamed him, as Ier. 13.26. Therefore will I discover thy skirts on thy face,
that thy shame may appear: they brought Jesus bound, as if he had been a common
Thief, to Pilate, Matthew. 26.2. And in regard of this, Esaias prophesied 53.3. He
was despised and rejected of men (the text will bear) Christ was no body --
and we hid as it were our faces from him; they put so much disgrace and shame
on blessed Jesus, he was so basely ^andled, that we blushed and were ashamed to
look upon him, all his friends thought shame of him. 1. But this was but the
lying estimation of unbelieving men, who could not see his glory; but the
repenting Thief, when they render him most shameful and abased by faith, saw
him a King who had the keys of Paradise at his girdle, when he prayed, Lord
remember me when thou come to thy Kingdom; and he was most un-King-like at
that time; and he had as much shame on him, as he was able to bear; he was
branded as the greatest Thief of the three, dying a Thiefes death, going out
at the ports of life, bleeding, pained, cursed, shamed, forsaken, despised,
mocked; all his glory was now under the ashes, and covered with shame; the
Sun seemed to be ashamed to see the Creator of the Sun in so painful and so
shameful a condition, and therefore the Sun runs away and hides it self,
and is not able to behold the Lord of glory hanged on a tree; the Rocks and
Mountains, the stones and fair Temple, as if they would burst for sorrow,
cannot endure so base a condition as the Creator was in now. And as if death
and the graves were grieved and male content to serve the justice of God, for
the sin of man, they will lodge their prisoners the dead no longer; but the
graves are opened: 2. Shame is but an opinion, and men can bestow their opinion
amiss, and so did the world on Christ; there was glory and fullness, yea,
infinite glory in Christ, but they saw it not; few see the worth, fewer can
weigh the weight of Christ's excellency; Men's glory is but (...), a mere
opinion, and often but a lie; and it took nothing of real glory from Christ,
whatever they esteemed him; (...) Devove^ d^ris, imp^ccor* (...), an execration
verbal or real.

(...) V^rbo vel ^e ^^le dixit. Job 3.6. Genesis 3.17. (...) m^ledicta terra, its
ascribed to Cain, Genesis 4.1^. and Number. 22.6. he shall be cursed that thou cur^^st
(...) to blasp^^^^^ is from (...) l^ght, of no weight, (...) Deuteronomy. 21.23


say that the sense of a man would judge the Sun no better then a two penny
candle, this takes nothing from the excellency of the Sun. 3. The Sun is
the Sun when it hides its beams and rays of light and heat; Christ was the
Lord of glory, when he drew in all his majesty and caused the Rays of glory
and honor retire and hid themselves under all the shame, baseness and
disgrace that men could lay on him; a voluntary condiscension of Christ was all
here.

3. A Curse.

The third Character engraven on Christ's death, is the curse of God, in which
consider 1. What a curse was on Christ dying. 2. How he was a curse, and the
causes of it.


To curse in both languages, is to pray evil, to devote to destruction either
in word or deed; now the curse that Christ was made: 1. Was the Lords
pronouncing him a curse: 2. The setting of him a part, as appointed for wrath
and judgment. 3. The dishonor done to him, the nothinging or dispising of
Christ, was a part of his curse; now in the first of these three, we know,
Deuteronomy. 21.23. The Lord pronounces him accursed that hangs on a tree. Paul in
Gal. 3.10.13. applies it to Christ; What sort of curse was on Christ.
it was a Ceremonial curse, I grant, Deuteronomy. 21. but had a special relation to
Christ, who was under a real and moral cu^se, for such a curse is upon the
sinner for Idolatry, and the highest breaches of the moral Law, Deuteronomy. 27. as
to s^t light by Father and Mother, to remove the neighbors landmark, and by
fraud or rapine, to take his Lands from him; such a curse was laid on Christ;
an higher curse then to be hanged on a tree; to be hanged was a note of a
temporal curse, but except the man dyed in sin, no mark of the eternal
displeasure of God, but as typical and relative to Christ, for whose sake only
this cu^se was put on the death of the Cross, it was in equivalency an
eternal vengeance, and that wrath which all the Elect were for ever to suffer
in hell; the Apostle says, A moral not a C^r^m^ni^ll curse only on Christ.
Gal. 3.10, 11, 12, 13. Such a curse as is due to these that abide not in all
that is written in the Law of God to do it, was upon Christ; now this was a
real and moral curse; because first, due to the Gentiles who were not obliged
to the Law of Ceremonies; and was, secondly, due to thousands that dyed not on
the tree.

2. Christ was devoted and set apart, in the eternal counsel of God for
suffering the punishment of sin; when God first purposed (if there be order
of first and second in the eternal decrees of God) the Lord devoted and set
apart this Lamb, before the foundation of the world was laid, to be a bloody
sacrifice for sin; He was separated from the flock to be killed, and for our
sakes he devoted vowed and sanctified himself for that work; Christ was of all
mankind separated to be an atonement and an expiation for sin; he was dieted
for the race to run, through death and hell, he was fitted; to suffer, The
70. rendereth the word (...) in (...) (...) to di^hono^ to count of no price,
to ^i^^eg^rd.
no man so furnished to undergo the wrath of God, as he.

3. As to be accursed comes under the third notion, to wit, to be dishonou^ed,
so was Christ under a curse, Psalm. 22.7. no man, Esa. 53.3. the last of men;
the contempt and the refuse of men, Act. 4.11. the stone rejected by you
builders (says Peter) (...) that Nothinged stone, not so much esteemed as an
errand murderer Barrabas; and this death of the Cross, now especially in the
Christian world, is become most base; as the burial of an Ass, Ier. 22. was a
sign of Gods displeasure, so is hanging, N^tions having not without Gods
providence, casten their consent together, that it should be the death of the
poor and basest of men; so Peter, as if it had been only of men's choosing, Act.
5.30. The God of our Fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew, and hanged on a
tree; And Act. 2.23. whom by wicked hands ye have crucified and slain; hanging
on a ^^ee is more then slaying; to kill a man is all ye can do, but to put
him to a base death* that is cursed both of God and man, is far worse, its
more then the wo^st; and that a King lineally descended of Kings and of the
blood Royal, the Kingly Tribe of Judah, the man on earth that only by birth,
and law, had Title to the Crown of Judea, should be put to so base a death, is
the worst that wicked men and devils could do.

I may add yet a fourth consideration, Genesis 3.17. Al^ the creatu^es are put
under the curse of man's sins: Christ dyed such a death as took the creatures
off the cu^se, and Col. 1.20. Christ having made peace through the blood of his
cross reconciled all things to himself, whither they be things in earth, or
things in heaven. 2. Now how Christ could be a curse is harder; there is a
thing intrinsecally and fundamentally cursed; and there is a thing
extrinsecally and effectively cursed; none, but he that sins, is
intrinsecally and fundamentally cursed; for in this regard its a personal
ev^ll. Christ was not intrinsecally abominable, hateful and an execrable
thing to God.

Obj^ct. But if Christ suffered all that we was to suffer for our sins, then
as God must in justice abhor and hate with a hatred of abomination the
sinner, and the sinner is such an one as God must let out his displeasure
against him, so must God hate and abhor his person, therefore Gods
displeasure not only persued Christ by way of punishment, that extrinsecally he
was cursed, but also the Lord in justice behoved to hate and abho^re the person
of the Son of God with the hatred of abomination, that he intrinsecally should
be a curse, as well as the sinner, in whose person he stands. Christ
extrins^cally a curse, ^ut never hate^ or abhorred of G^d.


Ans. Christ the surety behoved to suffer all and every punishment due to the
Elect, either in the same kind and coin, as death, or in the equivalency and
in as good; for there were some punishments that may be well changed the one in
the other: as death natural, or by violence was changed in the death of the
cross; we have no ground to think, if Christ had never come to die for us,
that the death of all mankind must have been the death of the cross; so Gods
hating and abominating the sinner must be and was changed in Gods forsaking of
Christ, when he complained, My God, my God, etc. in regard this was all as
penal and sad to Christ, as the other, to wit, to be abominated and hated in
our persons as cursed of God,, not to say that it was not congruous to the
condition of him who is the Son of the eternal God by nature, and by an
unspeakable generation, to be in his person abominated and abhorred of God, as
a man intrinsecally cursed, as the sinner who sins in person is, and not to
add also (which may be said* the kind of punishment; this, not this is
arbitrary to the Lawgiver, now the Apostle says not Christ was cursed, but
Gal. 3.10. (...), he was made a curse for us, extrinsecally a curse, as 2 Cor.
5.21. God made him sin for us, that is, what was penal in the curse and
sin, and whatever was congruous and suitable to his holy person, that the Lord
Jesus came under; sure as Christ took on him our nature, so he changed persons
and names with us legally; he was made the sinner, and the sinner made the
Son; there was reciprocation of imputation here. Christ was you legally and
by law, and ye are Sons in him. The Law was a bloody bond and our names and
souls were inked with the blood of the eternal curse; Christ changed persons
and places with sinners.
but blot out (says Christ) my brethrens names out of the bloody bond, and
writ in my name, for blood and the curse of God, and there was a white
Gospel-bond drawn up and the Elects names therein. Then the two writs run
this in the new Covenant; Christ was made a curse and liable to pay all our
debts and law-penalties to the blood and death, and the poor sinner eternally
blessed in Jesus Christ even to perfect imputed righteousness and everlasting
life. Christ changed your bleeding even to the second death, and made it
blessings for evermore to new and everlasting life.

Use 1. If Christ dyed such a violent and painful death; then death violent or
natural is not much up or down.

(1) Sweet Jesus had it to his choice, he would choose the sowerest of deaths,
Death natural or viol^nt, the indifferent accidents of death; but to die in
Christ is all and ^o^e and the right qualification of well dying.
to go to the grave in blood; Christ's winding sheet was blooded; a good prince,
a reformer of the house of God Josiah dyed in blood: Many of the worthiest that
dyed in faith, dyed not in their beds, were (Heb. 11.35.36.37.) tortured, had
trial of bonds and imprisonment, they were stoned, they were sawne asunder,
were tempted, were slain with the sword. The first witness in the Christian
Church after the Lords ascension, Steven a man full of the holy Ghost and of
faith, was stoned to death: Psalm. 79.2 The bodies of thy servants have they
given to be meat to the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy Saints to the
beasts of the earth: Many thousand Martyrs have been burnt quick, extremely
tormented with new devised most exquisite torments, as to be roasted on a
brander, to be devoured with Lions and wild beasts.

2. Violence more or less is an accident of death, as it is the same hand
folded in, or the fingers stretched out; violent death is but death on
horseback, and with wings, or a stroke with the fist, as the other death is a
blow with the palms of the hand; Natural death is death going on foot, and
creeping with a slower pace; violent death unites all its forces at once, and
takes the City by storm, and comes with sowrer and blacker visage; Death
natural divides it self in many several bits of deaths; old age being a long
spun out death, and nature seems to render the City more willingly, and death
comes with a whiter and a milder visage; the one has a salter bite, and teeth
of steel and iron; the other has softer fingers, and takes asunder the boards
of the clay-tabernacle more leasurely, softly, tenderly and with less din, as
not willing that death should appear death, but a sleep; the violent death is
as when apples green and raw are plucked off the tree, or when flowers in the
budde, and young, are plucked up by the roots; the other way of dying is, as
when apples are ripened and are filled with well boyld summer-sap, and fall off
the tree of their own accord in the eaters mouth: or when flowers wither on the
stalk: He that is in Christ, lives, speaks, walks, prays, sickens and dies in
Christ,
Some dying full of days have like banquetters, a surfeit of time, others are
suddenly plucked away when they are green; but which of ^he ways you die, not
to d^e in the Lord is terrible; ye may know ye shall dye by the fields ye
grow on, while ye live; a believer on Christ, breaths in Christ, speaks, walks,
prays, believes, eats, drinks, sickens, dies in Christ; Christ is the soil
he is planted in, he grows on the banks of the paradise of God; when he
falls, he cannot fall wrong; some are trees growing on the banks of the
river of fire and brimstone; when God h^ws down the tree, and death fells
them, the tree can fall no otherwise then in hell; O how sweet to be in Christ,
and to grow as a tree planted on the banks of the river of life, when such dye
they fall in Christ's lap and in his bosom; be the death violent or natural!
its all one whether a strong gale and a rough stormy shore the child of God
on the new Ierusalems dry land, or if a small calm blast even with rowing of
oars bring the passenger to heaven, if once he be in that goodly land.

2. To dye in faith, (the righteous has hope in his death) is the essential
qualification to be most regarded, that is the all and sum of well dying; make
sure work of heaven, and let the way or manner, violent or natural, be as God
will, its amongst the indifferents of death; Saints have dy^d either way; to
dye in Christ, in the hope of the resurection is the fair and good death: to
die in sin, Ioh. 8.21. that is the ill death, and the black death.

3. To dye ripened for eternity is all and some, its said of some, they dyed
full of days.

Object. How is a man full and ripe for death?

Answ. In these respects, 1. When the man is mortified to time, and is
satisfied with days, he desires no more life, he lies at the water side, near
by death, waiting for wind and tide, like a passenger who would fain be over
the water; so dying Jacob in the midst of his testament, Genesis 49.18. Lord I
have waited for thy salvation, Lord, when shall I have fair passage? Job says,
chap. 14.14. All the time I am on the sentinel, or the time of my warfare, I
will wait till my las^ change come. So Paul says, Phil. 1.2^. having a desire
to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is far better, the man desires
not to stay here any longer.

2. He would go to Sea, when all his land-busines is ended, the Courts are
closed, and if the Sun be low and near his setting, lo the way ends with
the day, see the lodging hard at hand, 2 Timothy 4.7. I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith, 8. henceforth is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness: Sweet Jesus ere he dyed, said It is finished, all is done, he
is on the skaffold* and nods on his executioner Death, friend, come do your
office, I pray you see your task be ended.

3. The man sees the crown, he is come to the stone wall or the hedge of
Paradise, and sees the apples of life hanging on the tree, and hears the
music of heaven: Steven Acts 7.50. I saw heaven opened.

4. He goes not away pulled by the hair, but willingly, gladly, Heb. 11.8.15.
They desire a better country, Job 5.26. Like a shock of corn in his season; it
would be the loss of the corn to be longer out of the barn; death shall
not come while it be welcome, Job. 7.3. As the hired servant pants for the
shadow, so he for death. All these four were in Jesus Christ.

Had Christ so much pain in his death, that his death and the cross were all
one, Use 2.
so as he had five deaths on him at once, four on his body, death on every
hand, death on every foot, and a death on his soul, ten thousand millions of
pounds weightier and sadder? then let us correct all our errors, and
mis-judgings touching the cross.

Error 1. We love to go to Paradise through a Paradise of roses, and a
land-way to heaven, and a dry fair white death; we would have Christ and the
cross changed, How many diverse false senses we fancy in our mis-giving humor
under the cross.
which says who ever would follow Christ let him take up his cross (...)
daily and follow him, Luke 9.23.

2. We forget that heaven is fenced with a huge great wood of thorns, we must
crowd through, though our skin be scratched even to blood and death; life
eternal is like a fair pleasant, rich and glorious City in the midst of a
waste wilderness, and there lies round about this City, at all the corners of
it, a Wood of Briats and Thorns, Scorpions and Serpents and Lions abounding in
it, Heaven is fenced with a wood of thorns there is no way to it, but through
many afflictions.
and the Wood is ten thousand miles of bounds on all hands, of a journey of
threescore years at some parts, there no high road-way in the Wood, no back
entry about; wise Professors seek away about the cross; God has given wings to
none to fly over the wood; or its like a fair Kings Palace in an Island of the
Sea; its a most pleasant Isle for all kind of delights, but there is no way to
it by dry land. Would ye have valley ground, Summer medows, fields and gardens
of flowers and roses all your way? and how is it that the Lord will not give
peace to his Church? nay, but there is not a way to heaven on this side of the
cross, or on that side of the cross, but directly, straight through we must
go; when the Apostles went through the Churches confirming the brethren, Act.
14.22. they preached that the cross was Gospel; and (...), through the midst
of affliction, or under flailing and threshing we must go, there is not a way
about to shift the cross, but we must enter into the Kingdom of God, this
very way and no other.

3. The blood was not dried off Christ's hands and feet, and his winding sheet,
The blood not dried off Christ while he was in heav^n.
till he was in the flower of the higher Palace of his Fathers Kingdom and
within the walls, and so his Church must not think hard of it, if she go not a
dry death to heaven.

Error 2. We tacitly condemn the wisdom of God in our murmuring under the
cross; cannot Christ lead his people to heaven a better way, then through the
swords, spears and teeth of malignants, and must new Armies of Irish
murderers land on us again? these would be considered: 1. Paul encouraging
the Thessalonians, says, 2 Thessalonians. 3.3. no man should be moved by these
afflictions; why, for your selves know we are appointed thereunto from
eternity, the wise Lord did brew a cup of bloody sufferings for his Church, and
did mould and shape every Saints cross in length and breadth for him; our
afflictions are not of yesterdayes date and standing; before the Lord set up
the world, as it now is, he had all the wheels, pinnes, wedges, works and every
material by him, in his eternal mind; all your tears, your blood, all the
ounces and pounds of gall and wormwood ye now drink, they were an eternal
design and plot of Gods wise decree before the world was, they were the lot God
did appoint for your back, they are no sourer, no heavier this day, then they
were in the Lords purpose before time; your grave, O Saints, is no deeper then
of old the Lord dug it, your wound no nearer the bone then mercy made it;
your death is no blacker, no more thorny and devouring then Christ's soft hands
framed it; ere God gave you flesh and skin and heat in your blood, Christ's
doom and the Churches doom of the black cross was written in Heaven: So
Christ smiles and drinks with this word, Ioh. 18.11. shall I not drink the cup
that my Father has given me? 2. Romans 8. Predestination is the first act of
free grace, and ver. 29. in that act a communion with Christ in his cross is
passed, this we consider not: will ye not think good to set your shoulders and
bones under the same burden that was on Christ's back? we fear the cross less
at our heels and behind our back, then when its in our bosom; the Lord Jesus
speaks of his suffering often aforehand* and its wisdom to make it less, by
antidated patience and submission, before we s^ffer; it were good, would we
give our thoughts and lend some words to death, as Christ here does ere it
come: Opinion which is the pencill that draws the face, arms and legs of
death and sufferings, might honey our gall; if a Martyr judge a Prison a
Palace, and his Iron chains golden bracelets, sure his bonds are as good as
liberty; if a Saint count death Christ's master-usher to make way to him for
heaven, then death cannot be a Mill to grind the man's life to powder; faith can
oil and sugar our wormwood; and if Christ come with the cross, it has no
strength; the believer has two skins on his face against the s^ittings of
storm and haile-stones; Christ can make a Saint sing in hell, as impatient
unbelief could cause a man sigh and weep in heaven. 3. We forget that the
Church is the Vineyard of the Lord of hoasts, and that the owner of the Farm
must hire Satan and wicked men to be his Vine-dressers and his Reapers; but the
crop is the Lords, not theirs, they are plowers; but they neither know the
soil, nor the husbandman, Psalm. 129.2.

Error 3. When we see we must suffer, we tacitly are offended that Christ will
not give us the first vote in our own jury, and that he would not seek our own
advise in this kind of cross, not this; except to one man, David, God never
referred the choice of a cross, but then grace made the choice; sure Scotland
would have chosen famine or the Pestilence, rather then the sword of a
barbarous* unnatural enemy; but it must not be referred to the wisdom of the
sick, what should be his physic; we often say any cross but this; especially
if there be any letter of reproach on the cross, a shameful death, or
distraction of mind; but the Lord sees nothing out of heaven, or hell so good
for you as that; that, and no other. 2. We would have the pound weights of
affliction weighted in our balance: oh this is too heavy, hence David's, and
Jobs over-complaining, Oh my calamity is heavier then the sand of the Sea, Job
6.3, and am I a Sea or a Whale, that thou setest a watch over me? chap. 7.12.
Should God deal with a man as with a fish, or a beast? How far we may chu^e
our own Cross.
3. We desire to be creators of such and such circumstances of our own grief:
So we storm often at the circumstances, as at the very poison of the cross,
as if God had through forgetfulness, and a slip of wisdom, left that
circumstance out of his decree, The cir^umstance that is sal^est in our ^rosse,
is d^e^sed by an in^i^i^el^ wise decree.
as the Painter that draws the whole body exactly, but forgets to draw one
of the five fingers, and in the mean while, that circumstance which we wrestle
most against in our thoughts, was specially intended of God: how often does
this fire our thoughts and burn them up with fretting? Had I done this, I might
have eschewed this heaviest and saddest calamity: Had I gone to Sea when the
wind and Sailers called me, but the fourth part of an hour sooner, I had not
been in dry land, where I am now butchered to death; so had I but spoken a
word, I might have saved all this loss and labor; had not this man come in
with an ill counsel and one unhappy word, many hundredth thousands had not been
killed in battle; and Martha, Ioh. 11.21. is upon this distemper, for she
says to Jesus, Lord, if thou had been here, my brother had not dyed: She
would say, it was an ill hap, Christ was unluckily in another place when my
brother dyed; but the wise decree of God had carved these circumstances so;
that Christ's absence was especially decreed in that affli^tion, ver. 15. Jesus
said plainly, Lazarus is dead, and I am glad for your sakes, that I was not
there, (to the intent that ye may believe,) etc. Look up in the affliction to
the sadest and blackest circum^^ance in the cross, infinite wisdom was not
sleeping, but from eternity with understanding and counsel; the Lo^d decreed
and fr^med that sadest circumstance, even that Shemei a subject should curse
David his Prince; and that he should harge him with blood against Saul of which
he was m^st free, and at that time, and no other time, when he was flying, for
his life from his Son Absalom; but all these sad circumstances, were molded
and framed on the wheels of the decree of him who devises all, shapes our
woes, according to the counsel of his will. We would have our Lord to remove
the gall, the wormwood, and the fire-edge out of our cross, and we lust for
some more honey and sugar of consolation to be mixed with it; it were good if
we could by grace, desire three ills to be removed from our cross: Three ills
in the Cross, we are to deprecate.
1. That of its nature, it be not sinful; such as hardness of heart; we may
in our election and choice, pray that it be not both a sinful plague of God on
the soul and a judgment to us: 1. We may pray that the affliction may be
circumstanced, and honeyed with the consolations of Christ, and with faith and
patience, and a spiritual use of the affliction: 3. We may pray, it may not be
a burden above our back, and such as we are not able to bear; and this we may
as lawfully choose and pray, as say, Lord lead us not into temptation.

The worl^s Hosanna a poor thing, and the glory short, base, low.
Use 3. Was there shame and reproach on Christ's cross? fie on all the glory of
the world; let us not think 1. too much of this piece, airy, windy, vain
opinion of men's esteem and the applause; its but a short living, hungry
Hosanna, when your name is carried through a spot or bit of this clay-stage,
for a day or two, they will wonder at you but nine nights. Christ's fame spread
abroad through all the country, and now he is shamed and a reproached man;
now the whole people cry out away with him, away with him, crucify him; the
ground of man's glory is his goodlinesse or graciousnesse, his (...), all his
endowments and brave parts, and all this glory, Esai. 40.6. is as the flower of
the field, his glory has a month, and lives the poor twelfth part of a year,
and Herod is gone to the worms, and his silks rotten and gone, and Shebna is
tossed like a ball in a large place, and must hear this, Esai. 22.18. Thou
shall die (in a strange land) and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the
shame of thy Lords house: its an earthly thing, Phil. 3.19. Whose glory is
their shame, who mind earthly things, Hos. 4.7. I Will change their glory into
shame; and when Epharim glories in children, God sews wings to that glory, and
it flies away, Hos. 9.11. As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away as a
bird. The ten Tribes boasted of their strength and multitude; but the Lord
says, Esai. 17.4. The glory of Jacob shall be made thin: 2. God in a special
manner sets himself in person against this glory; Esa. 23.9. The Lord of Hoasts
has purposed to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all
the honorable of the earth, Esai. 10.12. I Will punish the glory of the high
looks of the King of Assyria; Habac. 2.16. The Lord lays a right curse on
Chaldees glory; the cup of the Lords right hand shall be turned into thee, and
shameful sp^ing shall be on thy glory: 3. Its the sweet fruit of Christ's death
and abasement that we learn to lay down our credit under the Lords feet, Phil.
2. Let the same mind be in you, that was in Christ Jesus: O that must be a
high and an aspiring mind, for he was the high and lofty one; n^, he teaches
all his to be abased, ver. 6. who being in the form of God, thought it no
robbery to be equal with God, ver. 7. but he emptied himself; he was full of
majesty and glory, but he made himself of no reputation, and an empty thing,
and took upon him the form of servant, and was made in the likeness of men --
and humbled himself: ah let never man go with high sails, nor count much of
worlds glory, after Jesus Christ: ah our reputation and name is as tender to us
as paiper, as our skin; a scratch in it, or a rub is a provocation cannot be
expiated; as if we minded, in the airy cloud of men's fame, to fly up to heaven,
and frothy fame were as good to lay hold on Christ as fervent faith; breach of
our privileges of State is more now then blasphemy against God.

Use. 4. Now if Christ was made a curse for us, that we might be delivered from
the curse, we are comforted in Christ's being made a curse for us in regard of,
1. Extreme love. 2. Perfection of blessedness.


For this act of love; we are assured he that will be made the curse of God for
us, will be any thing; four great steps of love were here, every one of them
greater then another: Four steps of love in Christ's being made a curse for us.
1. To be a man. 2. To be a dying man. 3. To be as a sinning man. 4. To be a
cursed man.


Consider these four as they grow out of the root of love; For a Spirit to be
a man is a great condiscension.
A Spirit sinlesse, and holy is a happy thing; the Son of God being God, is a
Spirit, and so in another condition then man, he was above bones and clay, and
the motion of hot air going in and out at the nostrils; its a sort of cumber to
carry about a piece of dust of more then a hundredth and fifty bits of clay
organs, five senses, two hands, two legs, head, tongue, lips, throat,
shoulders, breast, back, so many fingers, toes, lithes, joints. veins,
muscles, then belly, stomach, heart, liver, bowels, and a number of cumbersome
vessels, let them be a hundredth and fifty fragments of warm, red and bloody
clay, they require more then a hundredth and fifty servants of clay, of meat,
raiment, medicine, to serve them, and the more needy a creature is, the more
miserable; a Spirit is above all these, and needs not senses, nor servants to
serve the senses and life; O but Christ was happy from eternity, and consider
what a low lowp of love was this, the Word made flesh? God manifested in the
flesh, is the greatest mystery of love in the world: here God an infinite
Spirit made man, has need of two eyes of clay, two ears, two legs, two hands,
he must come under the necessities of all these hundredth and fifty organs; can
ye tell what secrets of love are here? God looks out at two clay windows, the
two eyes of a Man; God walks with the two clay legs of a man, He dwelt
amongst us (says Ioh. 1.14) he pitched his clay-tent with us, (...).
full of grace and glory; grace and glory dwelling in clay is one of the deep
wonders of the World.

But 2. We would accept to be men; but if it were referred to our choice, we
must die in pain and be tumbled in a cold hole of clay in the earth and see
the Sun no more it may be, That a sinlesse Spirit, take on him to be a dying
man is more.
we would take it to our advisement, ere we chused life: Christ knew on such
terms, if he should be made a creature of clay, and if the high and lofty God
should be clothed with such rags, a coat of clay, so far below his beauty,
he must die; yet he would be a man a dying man; and we know what sad and sour
accidents were in his death.

But 3. Ye will kill an honest hearted and ingenuous innocent man, ere ye
move him to take with a fault, when he has done no fault: That a Spirit take on
him to be as a sinning man is yet more.
Job was called an hypocrite by his friends, but he would never take with it,
he would maintain his own righteousness, till he dyed; the Martyrs, ere
they would take sin on them by acting it, and deny Jesus Christ, they would
rather choose the gallous, torture, the teeth of Lions, burning quick or any
thing: but Christ Jesus takes it patiently to stand as the thief, the bloody
man, the false man, and as all the wicked men of the world; he could not act
sin; but he said, Father, make me the sinner; I never stole, but let my face be
blacked with theft, I never shed innocent blood, but let the stain, and blot
off the murderer be upon me; I never lied, but let me be as a liar and stand
so before justice; and God made him sin; 2 Cor. 5.21. when a man willingly
goes to prison for a broken man, its a real acknowledgement that he takes on
him the broken man's debts: Its as good as if he had said, crave me for him; a
moral blot to be put on an honest, holy, harmless man, is a high measure of
selfe-denyall and love; Christ said, here am I, crave me Lord.

But this is nothing, Christ was a man: 2. A dying man: 3. Made as a sinner,
and as a wicked and unhonest man; That a happy Spirit take on him to be a
sinner accursed of God, is far more.
but God blessed him, he was made a blessing of God, and that is comfort
enough; No, it was not so, God made him a curse, an execrable thing, all the
broad curses written in the book of the Law, came on him; see Christ made clay,
dying clay, as sinning clay, cursed clay; what would ye have more; Christ is
as if his Father abhorred him, and would not once give him on cast of his eye.

2. All perfection of blessedness comes to us by this that Christ was made a
curse for us, Gal. 3.14. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the
Gentiles, through Jesus Christ: that we might receive the promise of the
Spirit, through faith: This is the true freedom from the Law, to be freed from
the curse thereof, in believing Christ was made a curse for you, according to
that Romans 6.14. For sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not
under the Law, but under grace, which doctrine is clear, Romans 7. where
expressly we are said to be freed from the dominion of the Law, as the wife is
freed from the Law of subjection to her husband, if the husband be dead, which
is a comparison, and holds not in all, but only in so far as the two
husbands, the Law and Christ, stand in opposition the one to the other; now the
opposition is that the Law has dominion to justify the legal observers of it,
and guide the wife to life eternal; but the conditions are hard, and now
because of the flesh unpossible; Christ again, the better husband, leads his
Bride to heaven in sweeter terms, by believing in him that justifies the
ungodly, who has satisfied for our breach of the Law.

2. The Law has dominion over the wife that is in subjection to it, to condem
her, if she break to this spiritual husband, in thought, word, or deed; but
the two husbands both agree in this, that both command holy walking; as the
Apostle excellently shows, 1 Cor. 9.20. to them that are under the Law, I am
as under the Law, that I might gain them that are urder Law, ver. 21. to them
that are without Law, as without Law (being not without Law to God, but under
the Law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without Law: Hence we teach
that the believer married to the second and better husband Christ, is not freed
from the rule and directing power of the Law to lead us in the ways of
sanctification and holiness, but we are freed from the dominion of the Law
that it cannot justify us, nor condem us, because in Christ we are justified
by his imputed righteousness laid hold on by faith, and saved freely in him by
his blood, hence give me leave to vindicate our doctrine in this, from the
wicked aspersions cast on it, by Antinomians especially by Mr Town.

Mr Towne's assertion of grace against Doctor Tailor, Page 3. When its said, we
are not under the Law, but under grace, Romans 6. by the word (Law) I understand
the moral Law or decalogue, with all its authority, dominion, offices and
effects; and by grace is understood the Gospel of Christ; if ye were (says
he) under the power and teaching of the Law, We are not freed from the Law as a
rule of righteousness.
its true, sin would, then lord it over you, in that the Law is the strength of
sin, 1 Cor. 15. But ye are translated unto another Kingdom, where the enemy
ye so fear, is spoiled of all its armor, and power whereon it depends; and
your King you now live under, does freely communicate abundant and effectual
grace of justification and sanctification, so to fortify you, that ye shall
be more then Conquerours; therefore fear not, only be strong in the faith
thereof.

Answ. 1. Not to mind Mr Town that elsewhere he means by the Law, that we
are not under, not the Moral Law only, but the Ceremonial also; if we be
freed from all authority of the Law, We are under the teaching and directing
office of the Law.
then has the sixth command no authority from God to teach that murdering of
our brother (...) sin, that Idolatry is contrary to the second command (...)
acts of holiness and worship performed by (...) wil-service and will worship;
for if (...) and direct us, what is holy walking (...) by the Antinomian way,
does not teach any such thing in the letter; then its all unwritten
wil-walking, that a believer does; this is license, not holiness we are
called unto.

2. Then is it not the Laws office to reveal sin to us? Paul says
contrary, Romans 3.20. for by the Law is the knowledge of sin, Romans 7.7. I had
not known lust, except the Law had said, thou shall not covet; free a believer
from all the offices of the Law; Then the believer when he lies and whores, and
murders, is not obliged, to know or open his eyes, and see from the light of
the Law that these be sins; for Mr Town loses him from all the offices of the
Law: Paul mis-judged himself, when in his believing condition, he says; Romans
7.14.15. for we know that the Law is spirituall^, but I am carnal sold under
sin.

3. From the Laws teaching of believers, to infer that the Law lordeth it
over a beliver, is a great fallacy

4. If the enemy sin be spoiled of all power, even of indwelling and lusting
against the Spirit, then the believer cannot fail against a Law; then he may
say, he has no sin, which John says is a lie.

5. If Christ communicate abundant effectual grace of sanctification, then is
sanctification perfect; but the Scripture says the contrary, in many things we
offend all; and we are not perfect in this life, nor are we more then
Conquerours in every act of sanct^fication, nor is that Paul's meaning, Romans 8.
that we are never foiled, and that lusts in some particular acts have not the
better of us too often, but that finally in the strength of Christ, the Saints
are so far forth more then Conquerors, that nothing can work the Apostasy and
separation of the Saints from the love God in Christ.

Mr Towne's assertion of Grace, Page 4.5. Mark three grounds of mistakes: 1.
That justification and sanctification are separable, if not in the person, yet
in regard of time and word of Ministration, as if the Gospel revealed
justification; the Law were now become an effectual instrument of
sanctification: 2. That to ease men of the Laws yoke, is to suffer them to
range after the course of the world, and (...) lu^s not considering that the
righteousn^sse of (...) to Christ their Lord, head and Governor, that they may
be led by his free Spirit, and swayd by the Scepter of his Kingdom: 3. That
all zealous and strict conformity to the Law of works, though but in the
letter, is right sanctification.

Answ. 1. Not any of these are owned by Protestant Divines; they are Mr. Towns
forged calumnies; to the first, I cannot see that sanctification is any thing
at all by Antinomian grounds but mere justification, and that he is an
Antinomian saint that believes Christ satisfied, Neither Law nor Gospel
obliges a believ^r to sanctification by the Antinomian way.
and performed the Law for him, but no letter of Law or Gospel lays any
obligation on him to walk in holiness. But the Gospel only reveals
engraffting of the branch, in Christ the Vine-tree and stock of life, and the
bringing forth fruits, by the faith of Christ to be the only true
sanctification; but if the apples be not of the right seed, and conform to the
derecting rule of all righteousness the Law of God, they are but wild grapes,
we never made the Law the effectual instrument of sanctification; a help it
is, being preached with the Gospel; but neither is the Gospel of it self the
effectual instrument of sanctification, except the spirit of grace accompany
it, nor the law of it self.

2. The second is a calumny also; But we would desire to know how Antinomians
can free themselves of it, for the righteousness of faith does not so unite
believers to Christ as to their Governor, so as Christ governs them by the
Spirit and the Word, for the letter of the whole Word both Law and Gospel (say
Rise, reign error, 9.
they) holds forth nothing but a covenant of works, to search the Scripture
Error, 39.
either Law or Gospel, is not a sure way of searching and finding of Christ;
and Mr Town passes in silence all guidance of the Saints, By the Antinomian
way, we are no more under the Gospel, then under the Law.
by commandments of either Law or Gospel, and tells us of a leading by a free
Spirit only. So that by Antinomians, we are no more under the Gospel as a
directing and commanding rule, then we are under the Law; what hinders then
but Antinomian justification bids us live as we list; we think the Gospel
commands every duty, and forbids every sin as the Law does, under
damnation; what is sin to the one, is to the other. But the Gospel forbids
nothing to a justified believer under the pain of damnation, more then to
Jesus Christ. 2. A dead l^r^er forbids no sin, commands no duty; but the
Gospel of it self without the Spirit, is a dead letter, as well as the Law;
the major is the Antinomian doctrine, the assumption is undeniable.

3. Pharisaicall conformity to the Law we disclaim, but if any could be
strictly and perfectly conform to the Law of works, as Christ was, we should
think such a man perfectly sanctified; but, through the weakness of the flesh,
that is unpossible; I know not what Mr Town means by a conformity to the Law
though but in the Letter; if he means that the literal meaning and sense of
the Law requires no spiritual, inward^, and completely perfect obedience; he
is no good Doctor of the Law; and if it be not such an obedience, Antinomians
blame close walking with God as Pharisaicall Puritanisme, as Prelates did of
old.
it is not zealous and strict obedience; but its ordinary to Antinomians now to
term these whom the Prelaticall party of late called Puritans and strict
Precisians, because they strove to walk closely with God, Pharisees, and
outside Professors, who think to be justified and saved by their own
righteousness, so far are they at odds with sanctification; if by conformity
to the Law in the Letter. Mr Town means external obedience without faith in
Jesus Christ, or union with him; he knows Protestant Divines acknowledge no
^ound sanctification, but that which is the natural issue and fruit of
justification, The law alone works not sanctification, nor did we ever teach
it.
and flows from faith which purifieth the heart; and such strict conformity to
the Law as flows from saving faith, we hold to be true sanctification, though
all enemies to holy walking cry out against it, such as mockers of all
religion, the Prelaticall and Antinomian party who mock strict walking, and
long prayer, and humble confession of sins, and smiting of conscience for
sin.

Town, Page 5. Blind and sinister suspicion, and causeless fear inclined
Doctor Tailor to this exposition, to say our Apostle loses no Christian from
obedience and rule of the Law, but he dares not trust a believer to walk
without his keeper, as if he judged no otherwise of him then of a Malector of
Newgate, who would run away, rob, kill, and play his former Pranks, if the
jailer, or his man be not with him, when he is abroad.

Answ. 1. There is a twofold keeping in of sinners, one merely legal, such as
that of wicked men, Psalm. 32.9. Who are like the horse or mule and have no
understanding, How the law restraines men from sin.
whose mouth must be held in with bite and bridle, least they come near unto
you; The Law has not power over wicked men ever with terrors of hell and the
curse of God, because often they be given up to a hard heart, and what cared
Pharaoh, who was under the Law, for this keeper? and to a reprobate mind, and
to any that commit sin with greediness, having the conscience burnt with a hot
Iron, and being passed feeling, Romans 1.28.29. E^hes. 4.17, 18, 19. 1 Timothy 4.2.
The Law is no keeper; they care no more for Mr Towns goal, that a Lion does
for the crying of a shepherd, he will not abase himself for it: all the
restraint that Law lays on a natural man, is when the conscience is wakened
or some great plague is on Pharaoh, then he dare not keep the people captive;
but Antinomians have a good opinion of slaves of Satan, who judge them to be
civil and externally honest Devils, and make lims of hell of a good sweet
calm nature, who stand naturally in awe of Gods Law, but Romans 3.9, 10, 11.
among the whole Tribe and race of mankind, Jews and Gentiles see what they
care for the Antinomian Jailer, the law, they believe not one word of the Law
says, ver. 11. there is none that understands, there is none that seeks
God, Men naturally are not awed by the Law.
ver. 12. They are all gone out of the way (where is the keeper, now and his
sword, and spear?) they are altogether become unprofitable, there is none that
does good, no not one, ver. 13. their throat is an open grave, with their
tongues they have used deceit, the poison of Asps is under their lips, etc. The
law lays not naturally a bridle on the outer man; but observe that the
conscience be restrained and awed by the Law, and under any natural remorse
for sin committed or to be committed, is a sinful bondage that Christ must
deliver us us from. 1. Then stupefaction and deadness of conscience not to
care for the law of God, more then a prisoner who has broken goal, and now is
in hedges and highways robbing and murdering, cares for his old keeper, is
to Antinomians mortification, and a crucifying of old Adam. 2. So Jobs not
daring to lift his arm against the fatherless, chap. 31. must be the power of
old Adam in him; David's bones broken for his adultery and murder, must be the
power of old lusts in him. 3. Then the less tenderness of conscience and
fear for sin as sin, the more mortification of lust. 4. Grace as grace
stupifieth and deadeth conscience, so Antinomians must teach.

2. Men naturally do more good for the praise of men, and are more afraid to
do ill, for the Axe and the Gibbet of the Magistrate, then for any fear of
Hell or Judgment of the Law of God. Town cannot speak of this keeper, there
is a second restraint that the Law mixed with the love of Christ lays on the
godly and believer; and he has need of this keeper; so Joseph says. Genesis 42
18. this do and live for I fear God: There was a keeper over Job, that he
durst not lift up his hand against the Fatherless, cap. 31. why, ver. 27. For
destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I
could not endure: and this keeper in the conscience, smites David's heart, when
he renteth but the lap of Saul's garment, and keeps him that he dare not kill
him; this was not legal bondage; for Christ commands (Math. 10.28, 29. Luke
12 5.) us to fear him that can cast both soul and body in Hell, rather ere we
deny him before men who can but kill the body, and 1 Pet. 2.17. Col. 3.22. Act.
9.31. Act. 13.16. it is commanded to us: I grant the object of this fear is
not so much Hell, as the offending of God, but it is commanded in the Law of
God; but Mr Town will have the believer so free, so perfect, as the Law needs
not to teach and direct him in one step, he does all without a keeper or one
letter of a command, by the free impulsion of a Spirit separated from
Scripture; that is right down, a believer is neither under Law nor Gospel; but
a Spirit separated from the Gospel and all letter of it, and from the Law,
guides him.

Town, Page 5.6. But I muse why you omit to show what it is to be under gra^e,
which is the member opposite to being under the Law. Paul treat^th of
sanctification, and yet makes this contrariety of being under the Law, and
under grace, the Law must be taken comprehensively, with all his offices and
authority, and that the reason is firm that sin shall not have dominion over
him who lives under the grace of the Gospel, because it has a sanctifying
v^rtue and power in it to subdue sin.

Answ. Dr Tailor did not omit to expound what it is to be under grace, if you
had not omitted to read his words, he is clear to any unpartiall Reader; but
let your exposion stand; sin shall have no dominion over you, for ye are not
under the Law, as teaching, directing regulating believers in the way of
righteousness, but under grace, that is, under the Gospel which gives power
to subdue sin, without any ruling, teaching or directing power of the Law:
but what is the power of subduing sin to Antinomions, I pray you? not
sanctification, as in words they say, but justification, that is a power to
believe Christ by doing and suffering has fulfilled and obeyed the Law for you,
but ye are under no command to walk according to the rule of righteousness in
the Law; We are not obliged to personal sanct^fication, and to walk holy, by
the Antinomi^n Doctrine.
so that to be under the Law is just contrary to personal and real
sanctification and walking in love and in Evangelick duties, even as to be
under the Law, and to be under grace, are opposed by the Apostle; then as we
are obliged, not to be under the Law, but under grace, so are we obliged to no
personal sanctification or holy walking, but to objective and imputative
sanctification only, that is, only to believe in Christ as made our
righteousness and sanctification; now as we are not obliged to be inherently
righteous, so are we not obliged to be inherently and personally sanctified and
holy, for that is to be under the Law, as the rule of righteousness; now we
are freed from the Law as our rule of righteousness and from the Law with all
its offices and authority, says Mr Town; and to remain under the Law as a
rule of rightenesse and to walk holily as being obliged from the conscience of
any command either of Law or Gospel, is legal bondage from which Christ has
set us free; as to be circumcised is a part of the Law-yoke so they teach; then
to be inherently holy is unlawful to Antinomians.

Mr Town, Page 6. Yet I wish that I be not mis-taken, for I never deny the Law
to be an eternal and inviolable rule of righteousness: But yet affirm that
its the grace of the Gospel which effectually and truly conformeth us thereunto.

Answ. 1. I wish Mr Town do mistake, for he that teaches that believers are
freed from the Law, Mr Town grants the Law to be an eternal and inviolable
rule of righteousness to all, and yet denies the believer to be under (...)
as a rule teaching, directing, and from the Law with all its offices and
authority; he denies the Law to believers to be an eternal and inviolable
rule of righteousness, or then he must speak contradictions, to wit, that the
believer is not under the Law as a rule of righteousness, for so (says Town)
he should not be under grace, which is contrary to the Apostle, Romans 6.14. and
yet he is under the Law as an eternal and inviolable rule of righteousness;
for I ask to whom is the Law an eternal and inviolable rule of justice? to the
believer, or no? If to the believer, then he must be under it; but Antinomians
say, that is Pharisaicall and Popish; that is to put Christ's freeman (says
Twone) under his old keeper the Law, as if he were a malefactor; if the Law be
no eternal and inviolable rule of righteousness, why does Mr Town say so?

2. That rule to the which the grace of the Gospel does conform us, that rule
we must be under; but Mr Town says The grace of the Gospel truly conformeth
us to the eternal and inviolable rule of righteousness, Ergo, etc.

3. An inviolable rule of justice cannot be violated and contravened by these
to whom it is a rule without sin, else its not an unviolable rule; then if
believers cannot violate the Law, and murder, and commit adultery, but they
must sin, by violating the rule, then as believers are obliged not to
murder, not to commit adultery, so must they be under the inviolable rule of
righteousness, contrary to which Antinomians teach. All that Mr Town can say
against us in this argument is a calumny, that we make the Law, not the Gospel
to give power to subdue sin; but the truth is neither Law nor Gospel gives
grace, but the God of grace has promised in the Gospel grace and a new heart
and a new spirit to the Elect, and grace goes not along with the Gospel, The
Law leaves not of to be a rule of righteousness, because it gives not* grace
to obey, for then the Gospel should be no rule of faith* because it gives no
grace t^ believe to all that hates it.
as a favor of equal extension with the preached Gospel, but millions hear
the Gospel who remain void of grace, and have no right to any promise or
grace; the Law leaves not off to be the rule of tighreousnesse, though it
cannot effectually make its disciples holy and conform to the rule, no more
then the Gospel should not be the Law and rule of faith, because without the
influence of the Spirit of grace it can make no Disciples conform to Jesus
Christ and his image; for many Elect for a long time, hear the Gospel and have
no grace to obey, while the time of conversion come, and many are more blinded
and hardened that the Gospel is preached to them, and it were better they had
never heard nor known the way of truth.

Town page 6.7. Romans 7.6. The meaning is, through faith is bred assured
confidence, lively hope, pure love toward God, invocation of his name, without
all wavering or doubting or questioning his good will, audience and acceptance,
which could never be attained by all the zeal and conscience toward God
according to the Law of works. -- and the knowledge of the glory of God, is
given according to a covenant of mere grace, without addition or mixture of
works -- and the opposition is plain to be not so much b^tweene the gross
hypocrite (who is only brought to outward subjection, and correspondency to the
Law) as between him that in good earnest and in down uprightness of heart,
gives over himself wholly to the Law of God, Romans 10.2. ( as the wife to the
husband and guide of her youth) to be ordered in all things inwardly and
outwardly after the mind of God therein, according to his legal conscience,
which is never pacified with works, and the man who knows and worshippeth God
alone according to the Gospel of Grace.

Answ. This is a close perverting of the word of truth. 1. The Antinomian faith
may here be smelled, that by faith is bred assured confidence, without all
wavering, fear or doubting, etc. Then whoever once doubt or waver, are yet
under the Law of works; a doctrine of despair to broken reeds, who are not
under the ^aw, but married to a new husband Christ, and yet cry, Lord, I
believe, help my unbelief: Why fear ye, O ye of little faith, is there not
doubting here and a broken faith which Christ softly binds up?

2. The Covenant of Grace and Gospel commands faith, and also good works as
witnesses of our faith; but Town will have good works in any notion of an
evangelick command to stand at defiance with a covenant of mere grace: when
Grace is the fountain and cause of our walking in Christ, 2 Cor. 1.10. by the
grace of God, we had our conversation in tht world, in simplicity and godly
sincerity, 1 Cor. 15.10. I labored more abundantly then they all, yet not I,
but the grace of God, that is in me. Its true, Holy walking by the grace of
God, and Christ's righteousness in justification, is a wicked mixture, which we
detest.

3. The opposition. Romans 7. is between any unconverted man under the Law, be
he hypocrite, or a civil devil, or be he any other man on the one part, and a
believer married to Christ, and dead to the Law on the other; for that which is
common not to gross hypo^rites only, but to all natural men out of Christ, is
ascribed to the man that is under the Law, by the Apostle, as 1. He is under
the Laws dominion and condemnation, verse. 1. 2. The Law has power over him, as
the living husband over the wife, verse. 2.3. The poor man cannot look to Jesus
to another lover and husband, Every natural man is under the Law in the
Apostles sense Romans 7.
the Law as a hard husband leads him, and cries, obey perfectly, or be
eternally damned. (3) He is a man in the flesh, in whose members concupiscence
and lust rages, as a young vigorus mother brings forth children, lusts of
the flesh to death, as married to hell and the second death, verse. 5. (4) He
serves God according to the oldnesse of the letter, that is carnally,
hypocritically, like an outside of a rotten Pharisee, and not according to the
newness of the Spirit, that is in a Spiritual manner.

Yet Mr. Town extolls him, as one that in good earnest and downe-rightnesse of
heart yields and gives over himself to the Law of God, The man under the
Law, Romans 7. cannot give himself to be ruled by the Law after the mind and
will of God, as Mr. Town says.
(as the wife to the husband) to be instructed and ordered in all things
inwardly and outwardly after the mind of God; but no unconverted man can be
said so to do, except Antinomians be gross Pelagians; But I think
Antinomians, with Mr. Crispe think the person under the Law in all this chapter
to be the believer personating or acting the person of a scrupulous believer
under a temptation of doubting: but clear it is, Paul speaks of a man under
the Law, in the flesh, and in opposition to him, of one under grace, of one
married to the Law, and of one married to Christ; in the first part of the
chapter, of one in the flesh, and so unrenewed, verse. 5. For when we was in
the flesh, etc. and of one that is dead to the Law, married to Christ, and
serves the Lord spiritually; and its clear that the Apostle counts it a part
of deliverance from the Law, and a fruit of our marriage to God, that (verse. 4)
we^ bring forth fruits to God, and walk holily. 2. That the motions of sins
bring forth wicked works, as children to the second death, verse. 5. (3) that
we serve the Lord (verse. 6.) in newness of Spirit, and walk in Christ.

Now Mr. Town as setting himself to contradict Paul, says page 6. This is an
addition and mixture of works and faith, and cannot stand with a covenant of
mere grace.

Town page 8. How can Christ red^eme us from the Law, being under the Law, for
us* except believers be redeemed from the Law in that same very sense, and
extent that Christ was under it as a mediator? But was not Christ under the
Rule and obedience also as well as under the Reign to death, seeing he came to
do the will of his father, and fulfill all righteousness, Mat. 3.15.

Answ. 1. We cannot every way be said to be redeemed from the Law, in that
same sense that Christ was under it: For Christ was under the Law of Ceremonies
to free the Jews from observing that Law; I hope we Gentiles are not that way
freed from the Law of Ceremonies; for that Law did never oblige the Gentiles
except the Gentiles had adjoined themselves in some profession, to the then
visible Church.

2. If Christ was under the Law as the rule, to free us from the Law as the
rule, then why did Christ command us to imitate him in doing his fathers will,
and submitting to that same Ru^e, that he submitted to, as is clear, Matthew.
11.29. learn of me that am meek, Ioh. 15.10. If ye keep my commandments, ye
shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my fathers commandments, and abide
in his love, Ioh. 14.15. If ye love me, keep my commandments, Ioh. 13.15. For
I have given you example, that ye should do as I have done unto you, Ephesians.
5.1.2. Rev. 3.21. Heb. 12.1. 1 Pet. 2.21.22. Ioh. 15.23. but Antinomians Rise,
reign er. 4.5.
say that these that be in Christ are not under the Law, or commands of the
word, (even of the letter of the Gospel) as the rule of life, and that
Christians are not bound to conform themselves in their life to the directions
of the word, contrary to Psalm. 119.9. Esai. 8.20. and contrary to all the
gospel-exhortations given in the New Testament by Christ and his Apostles; and
they say er. 6.
that the example of Christ's life, (even in subjecting himself to the law as a
rule of righteousness) is not a pattern according to which we are to act and
live: In a word, they will have the Spirit separated from the word, and from
the example of Christ, and all the cloud of witnesses to be no rule to us; to
which I oppose that one precious word of the beloved disciple, 1 Ioh. 2.26. A
mystery of Antinomians that all means not effectually moving the will are not
means laying bonds on the conscience.
He that says he abides in him, ought so to walk even as he has walked. But
observe, 1. All means that do not efficaciously bow the will to obedience to
God, and convert the soul, are rejected by them, as not obliging the
conscience, such as are the Law, the letter of the Gospel, all the promises,
exhor^^tions and precepts of the Gospel, the example of the Lord, who
commands us, 1 Pet. 1. to be holy as he is holy, the example of Christ, of
all the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs and Saints, because all these are some
other thing then grace, and may prove ineffectuall: hence

1. The Gospel as contradistinguished from the Law, is not the Gospel written
or preached, Rise, and reign
but the grace that resideth no where but in God and in Jesus Christ, is the
Gospel; so say they er. 26.
The faith that justifies us is in Jesus Christ, and never had any actual
being out of Christ. 2. There i^ no habitual grace inherent in believers, all
such must be a created thing, Grace is an uncreated favor only in God: for
all that which is called habitual grace in us is in effectual to act
graciously, and cannot produce supernatural acts, except the holy Ghost act
and move it: Hence they say Rise, reign er. 7. Cornwall conference of Mr. John
Cotton q. 2. arg. 6. p. 16.17.

Antinomians acknowledge no grace but what is uncreated and so no habits of
grace Ezech. 36.26. Deuteronomy. 30.6. Act. 16.14. Ier. 31.33. Ezech. 11.19. Romans
12.2. Romans 7.22.23. Ephesians. 3.17.


that the new creature or the man, (or the new heart, or new Spirit, the
circumcised, the opened heart, the Law in the inward parts, the one heart, the
renewed mind, the inner man, the Law of the mind, Christ dwelling in the heart
by faith) mentioned in the Gospel, is not meant of Grace, but of Christ, and
therefore Rise, reign, er. 23. p. 5.
we must not pray for gifts and graces, but only for Christ: and er. 25.
Antinomians take away all use of teaching, exhorting, of the Gospel, or
promises thereof.
so a man may have all graces and poverty of Spirit, and yet want Christ.

2. We are patients in justification, Sanctification, believing in Christ, and
we are blocks all the way to heaven; mind, will, affection, memory, love,
desir^, joy, fear and all in us act nothing in supernatural acts; there is
not such a thing as grace, in any of the Saints, but Grace is nothing but
Christ without us drawing us as blocks, as dead stones, in the way to heaven,
having no activitie, but to sin, er. 36. p. 7.
even after we believe in Christ: and er. 14. p. 3.
Christ works in the regenerate as in deadmen.

3. Omissions of duties commanded in the Gospel are no sins, for none are, er.
22. p. 5.
to be exhorted to believe, but such whom we know to be the elect of God, or to
have his Spirit in them effectually, and er: 59. p. 1^,
a man may not be exhorted to any duty, because he has no power to do it;
then Law, Gospel, exhortations, commands, promises, threatning^, are to no
purpose: these that want grace to obey, are not liable to obey, nor guilty, nor
under wrath, because they believe not in the Son of God, and these that are
under grace are under obligation to no commands at all, and farewell all
Scripture from henceforth; Yea, Mr. Town is frequent in this, we are not under
the Law, as our rule; Why? because, (says he) it cannot effectually work
obedience in us; but so all the word of God, the Gospel without the Spirit must
be no rule of obedience at all, because the Scripture, the Gospel and all the
promises without the Spirit are just alike and uneffectuall to work us to
obedience. No scripture freeth us from the Law as a rule of righteousness, but
all that speak of our freedom from the law, speak of our freedom from the
rigor and curse thereof.


But not one word of old or new Testament frees us from the Law as our rule of
righteousness, and all the scriptures that speak of our freedom from the
Law, do directly speak of our freedom from the curse and condemnation of it,
because we cannot be justified thereby, as Gal. 3.10. For as many as are of the
work of the Law, are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one
that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to
do them: this must be to do them in a legal way, 1. He must do them all in
thought, inclinations, motions of the heart, and all the strength of the soul,
in all his actions, in all his words, and in a spiritual manner as the law
charges, otherwise he is cursed; then all mankind, both such as are in
Christ, or out of Christ are cursed; now if the simple doing of the things of
the law, as its a rule of our life, did involve us in a curse, then to honor
Father and mother which Paul certainly commands as a Gospel-dutie, Ephesians.
6.1.2. and the loving of our brother to which John. 1. Epist. c. 2. c. 3. c. 4.
c. 5. exhorts us unto, should involve us in a curse; Faith loses us not
from the Law and holy walking simply, but only in the matter of justification.
which is absurd.

2. He must continue to the end in doing all the Law; if ever he fail, he is
under a curse: Now thus it is clea^ Paul says we are freed in Christ, from a
necessity of justification by the works of the law: For Paul adds in the
next words, verse. 11. But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of
God, is evident, for the just shall live by faith; if the living by faith did
exclude work^, and keeping of the law in an^ respect at all, as the keeping of
the law is a witness of the life of faith: then to do the things of the law,
as its an eternal rule of righteousness, We cannot be (as Mr. Town imagines)
the same way freed from the Moral Law, as we are freed from the Ceremonial Law
should also involve us in the curse, and argue that we seek to be justified
by the law, and so that we are fallen from Christ, even as to be circumcised
does involve a man to be a debtor to the whole law, and argues a falling from
Christ and the grace of the Gospel; for Antinomians contend that we are the
same way freed from the moral law, as it is a rule of Righteousness, that we
are freed from the Ceremonial law; But we are freed, under the pain of a
curse, and of falling from Christ, and the grace of the Gospel, from the
literal observing of circumcision, Act. 15. and Gal. ^.1, 2, ^, 4. as the
Ceremonial Law is a rule of righteousness; and if any should pretend the
impulsion and leading of the Spirit, not any letter of the Law, and thereupon
be circumcised, and should renounce the law of ^eremonies as a rule of
righteous walking as Antinomians profess they obey father and mother and love
their brother, and abstain from Idolatry, not because the Law is their rule,
or the letter of the Law swayeth their conscience, but because the Spirit of
Christ leads them; if (I say) any upon this Spirit would be circumcised, and
eat the passover, and sacrifice Lambs and blood to God now, this Spirit is no
Gospel S^irit, but the spirit of Satan leading such from Christ: If then we
are not to obey the Moral Law, as a rule of life and righteousness; but are
f^^ed from it the same way, that we are freed from the Ceremonial Law; then to
love God and our brethren in any notion should be sin, as to be c^rcumcised
in any notion is to fall from Christ, Act. 15. Gal. 5.

Mr Town has a strange evasion for this, Page 138.

The Spirit is free, why will ye control and rule it by the Law, whereas the
nature of the Spirit is freely to conform the heart and life to the outward
rule of the Law without the help of the Law, as a crooked thing is made
straight according to the line and square, and not by them; and thus while a
believer serves in newness of the Spirit, the Spirit freely and cheerfully
moving him and inclining him to keep the Law which is merely passive, herein
they do wickedly who hence take liberty to sin.

Answ. 1. To do the will of God merely as commanded from the power of an
outward commandment or precept in the word is but legal, and brings forth but
mixed obedience or finer hypoc^isie (says Saltmarsh flowings of free grace,
last part, c 4. p. 178.
Saltmarsh) and Mr Town says that it is to control the free Spirit, and to
rule it by a Law; and Familists of new England (as the old Libertines) say all
R^se, reign, 7^.
verbal Covenants or covenants expressed in words are covenants of works and
such as strike men off from Christ; and Error 9.
the whole letter of the Scripture holds forth a covenant of works; and Error
62.
its dangerous to close with Christ in a promise of the Gospel; because the
promise is an external created letter, Obeying of God because of the direction
of Law or Gospel, is to Antinomians a controuling of the fr^e Spirit of God.
and the Spirit is all; this is to make a battle and contrariety between the
Word of God and the Gospel as written or preached, and the Spirit, whereas 1.
that which the Scripture says, the Spirit of God says; the command and Gospel
promise is the sense and mind of the holy Spirit; for that the Scripture is
q^ickned by the Spirit, 2 Timothy 3.16. and the Word is the seed of God, and of
the new birth, 1 Pet. 1.23. and mighty in operation, and powerful and sharper
then a two-edged sword, Hebr. 8.12. nor is it possible that any can believe the
report of the Gospel, because it is the Gospel-report, but the arm of the Lord
and the power of God in the Gospel must be revealed to them; Esai. 53.1. Ioh.
12.37.38.39. For John says, the not receiving the report of the Gospel is
judicial blindness and unbelief; when Joseph dare not oppress his brethren,
and Job dare not lift his arm against the Fatherless, because the sixth
command says, thou shall not murder; this is but finer hypocrisy in Joseph
and Job, and a controuling of the free Spirit; better believe David, Psalm.
119.6. Then shall I not be ashamed when I have a respect to all thy
Commandments; no doubt the Lord concurred freely with Adam in the act of
obeying God in abstaining from the fruit of the forbidden tree, if therefore
Adam should obey God out of conscience to Gods command ( eat not) he should
either control the free Lord in his working, which none in conscience can
say, or then Adam must have been loosed from obedience to that command, if ye
eat, ye shall die, as we are now loosed from the Law and the second death,
though we break the Law, according to the Antinomian way; yea, its
unconceivable how these that are under grace, do obey the Gospel enjoining
faith, because the Lord jesus commands them, but they must sin in so doing
because they control the free Spirit of God, in not obeying for the free
impulsion of the Spirit, *but for the literal command *of God; for sure to
control the free Spirit is sin, and to obey for the letter of the command, to
Antinomians, is to control the free Spirit; but its blasphemy to say that
there is a contraiety between the letter of the Lords command either in Law or
Gospel, and the free impulsion of the Spirit working ^in us by grace to will,
do, and obey the command: ^or to obey the voice of the Lord in his Prophets
and Apostles, and to obey the Lord himself are all one, in the word; but this
is the error of old Anabaptists and Enthysiasts, to reject the word, and all
teaching by men and the word, and to lean to the only immediate inspirations
and free motions of the Holy Ghost; and to do or obey, for any other teaching
is the way of legal and law-men led by the letter, not by the Spirit. If any
obey or do Gods will out of by respects, or for fear of punishment or hope of
reward, they do not Gods will, nor obey they from the power of an outward
command, nor do they control the free Spirit, because the very letter and
outward commandment enjoyneth inward, spiri^uall sincere obedience far from
hypocrisy, and forbids in the sense of the letter of it, all servile
respects and service of God for hire. Antinomians believe that the Law as the
law does ommand men to obey for fear of hell, as a servant for beating obeys
his Master, or that it commands perfect obedience for hire of life eternal.
I do^bt not to say this is not far from blasphemy; for the Law is spiritual
and holy, and good, and most just, its a clean and undefiled Law, Psalm. 119.
and Romans 7. is the express and image of the good, acceptable, and perfect will
of God, Romans 12.2. then the Law as the Law can command no finer hypocrisy, no
servile, no mercenary obedience for hire, for the Law cannot command sin; its
true Luther says, that the Law compels men to obey God, but he speaks of
the accidental operation and fruit of the Law, because of our sinful
disposition, and of the condemning Law as it works on our corruption, the holy
Law commands no man to obey God wickedly.

2. The letter of the Gospel carries to us and holds forth free grace,
opens the bowels and heart of Christ, calls on the weary and laden, to
come to Christ, speaks heaven, glory, and the promise in the womb of it;
though it be but the foolishness of preaching of men, yet its the power o^ God
to salvation, and there is such a Majesty, so much of heaven, in the womb and
bowels of the word, that as I never read or heard the like of it, so I shall
hate that Religion that joins with popery, to call it Ink-divinity, and a
letter, and a legal servile thing; so did the Libertines, in Calvines time.

3. All tends to this, that we despise prophesying, neglect the word,
commands, promises, covenant of grace and all these inferior means, and so
praying, experience, conference, hearing, reading, Sacraments, because without
the Spirit these are livelesse and dead; for (says Town) the means are
passive, shall be also many restraints laid on the free Spirit of God. But so
we should not sail nor traffi^k, we should not plew, nor ear, we should not
watch the City, nor build houses, because all these are fruitless without the
influence of a blessing from heaven; if their meaning be that we are not to
trust or rest on the means, the word, promises, covenant of grace, but to seek
Christ himself in all these, its good, but then to seek Christ in his own way,
is not to control his spirit, as Mr Town phancieth.

Now what Town does mean in saying that the Spirit freely conformeth the heart
and life to the outward rule of the law, without the help of the Law, is heard
to conjecture; for ^f the meaning be that the Spirit needs the he^p of the
Law to make us know our sins, to humble us and chase us to him who is the end
of the Law: then surely the Spirit by the help of the Law works these in us,
as God makes corns to grow by husbandry, rain, good soil and by nature his
handmaide, no man can say God works here without the help of the Law; if the
meaning be that the law of it self cannot convert a man to God, Antinomians
father most falsely such a dream on us, nay, the Gospel of it self cannot
effectuate this without the Spirit: But if the Spirit conform us to the
outward rule of the law; then must the law be yet a rule of our obedience: how
are we then freed from the law as a rule of our obedience, if the Spirit led us
back to this rule?

And Romans 3. Romans 7. Gal. 3. and 2 Cor. 3. where the Apostle speaks of our
freedom from the law, he ever speaks of our freedom from the law as it
condemns, as it works wrath, as it involveth us in a curse, as it can
justify us, or give life; never as it does regulate, direct, teach, and lead
us in the way of righteousness.

Mr Town, Page 9. What freeth a believer from the curse, but because he is a
new creature in Christ and is made personally, perfectly and everlastingly
righteous? and the principal debt is obedience, the failing wherein binds
^ver to the curse and death. The new crea^ure, 2 Cor. 5.17. is sanctifi^a^ion.


Answ. That new creature is sanctification not justificatification, 2 Cor.
5.17. If any man be in Christ, that is, if he be justified, h^ is a new
creature, that is, he is sanctified; else by the Antinomian gloss the meaning
must be ( if any man be justified in Christ, he is justified in Christ) Paul
speaks not so non sense.

2. It is true, we owe active obedience to the law as a debt, but that is the
d^bt of absolute^y perfect ob^dience; how shall it follow that Christ has
loosed us from all debt of active obedience, The Law requir^th p^rf^ct
obedience as the Law; but the La^ a^ ^vangeli^ed req^iret^ not p^rfect
ob^dience that we may be Eva^ge^ic^lly justified.
because he has loosed us from a necessity of perfect active obedience under
the pain of damnation; but the Law as in the hand of Jesus the Mediator, or
the law (...) spiritualized and lustered with Gospel law and free grace, and
drawn down to a Covenant of free grace, req^ireth not exact perfect obedience
under pain of losing salvation; yea, it requires obedience as the poor man
is able to give it, by the grace of God that the man enter in the possession of
life eternal; but that he may have ransome-right by merit and conquest to
heaven, or to free justification in Christ, the law cannot crave either legal
or Evangelick obedience: This then is no more a good consequence, then to say
Christ has by his death freed us from death and suffering as they are caused by
the Law, and satisfactory to justice, therefore Christ has freed us from death
and sufferings in any respect.

Yea, Paul shows what Law it is that we are freed from Romans 8.2. it is the
Law condemning and killing called the law of sin and death, and he says
expressly Christ dyed for this end, Diverse ^easons Romans 8. Gal 5. etc. pr^^i^g
tha^ we are yet un^er the ^sword^ a ^ule of ri^hte^usnesse.
ver. 4. that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Hen^e I argue, these that ought to
fulfill the righteousness of the Law, by walking after the Spirit, and
mortifying the deeds of the flesh, are not freed from the Law as a rule of
right^ousnesse, but are obliged by virtue of command, to this rule; for Paul
proves that there is a commanding power enjoining rightous walking, above us,
even when we are led by the Spirit. 1. Because we are obliged to mind the
things of the Spirit, not of the flesh, ver. 5. 2. To be spiritually minded is
life* as to be carnally minded is death eternal, ver. 6. 3. We are to be
subject to the Law; then we must be spiritually, not carnally minded; for the
carnal mind cannot come under such subjection, ver. 7. 4. We are to please
God in our walking; then we cannot walk in the flesh, ver. 8. 5. Because we
are dead to sin, v. 9.10. We are not debtors, nor owe we to the flesh any
service, v. 10. But sure by a commandment, we owe service to Christ; again
the Apostle, Gal. 5. treating of that common place of Christian liberty,
especially moves the Antinomian doubt, and says ver. 13. Christian liberty is
not licentiousness, nor an occasion to the flesh; and commands, that we
serve on another in love, ver. 13. Now here was a fit place, if Paul had been
an Antinomian to say, but ye are freed from the Law as a rule of
righteousness, and if I command you to love one another, I bring you back to
bondage again, I clap you up in goal again and deliver you to your old
keeper; no says he, But 1. this is Liberty to serve one anot^er in love; and
its an Evangel^ck fulfilling of the law; for all the Law (says he ver. 14.) is
fulfilled in this one word, thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, and
ver. 16. There is an express command walk in the Spirit: and ver. 18. It might
be said then we may live as we list, we are free from all Lords; its true
(says the Apostle, ver. 18. ye are not under the Law to condemn you, but yet
ye are not lawless, ye must be led by the Spirit, and ver. 19. fly the
works of the flesh, ver. 19. such as adultery, fornication, etc. now the law
expressly forbids the works of the flesh. he Anti^omian Doctrine is
propounded by the carnal Libertine, Romans 7.
And Romans 7. the very Antinomian doctrine is obviated for ver. 6. But now we
are delivered from the Law; O then might some say, then we are free men; he
answers not so; we are delivered from the Law that we should serve God in a
Spiritual manner: But again, ver. 7. Paul proponeth the special objection of
the Carnal Libertine, if we be freed from the Law, what shall we say then? is
the Law sin? this doubt arises both from ver 5. and ver. 6. ver. 5. he said
the motions of sin that were by the Law, did work in our members sinful
motions; he inferres then it may appear to some that the Law is a factor and
ag^nt for sin; is the Law sin? b^ way of sollici^ation, ver. 6. We are not
under the Law: then it would appear that the rem^ved Law is not a dispens^tion
to sin, and so the law is sin; if we be freed from it, we may sin; Paul
says the Law is not so removed and dead, but t^ere is a good and holy ^se of
the law; it remains as a rule of righteousness touching what we should fly,
and what we should follow, thus the law is neither a factor for sin nor a
dispensation to sin; because it discovers and forbids sin; for (says
he) I had not known lust to be sin, but by the Law: and this the Antinomi^n
now moves; we are freed from the law being once justified; what ever we do,
it is not against a law nor a rule, for we are under no law as a rule; and what
we do, though to our sense and feeling it be adultery and a debt against the
seventh command, yet truly in the sight of God, it is no more sin, then any
thing Christ does, is sin, we are as clean of it, ere we commit, it as
Christ or the glorified Spirits in heaven, and therefore the law gives us a
dispensation to do these things being justified, which the unjustified cannot
do, but they must in doing it, sin, because the unjustified man is under the
law as a rule of justice, which we are not under; and so we have a dispensation
and an an^idated one to sin, before hand, but because we are under no rule of
righteousness it is to us no sin. Take two servants, the master commands
one of them, eat all fruit of the garden; but I forbid you, the fellow servant,
under a pain, eat not of this tree in the east end of the garden; to the other
he gives no such charge or command; the former servant eating of the tree in
the east transgresses not his masters command, because he is under no law
forbidding, the other cating of that same tree is a transgressor, because he is
under a forbidding command; so here, if the justified be not under the ten
Commandments as a rule of life, though they swerve from all the ten, yet
they sin not; for Saltmarsh says, where there is no law, there is no sin.

Mr Town says, Although the Spirit bring forth in the Saints the fruits of
holiness according to the law, Gal. 5.22. Ephesians. 5.9. Yet without Christ we
can do nothing, Lex jubet, non juvat. Quod lex imperat, Evangel^um impetrat.
unless as the imp or branch we suck, and derive life and sap from him which
is the Spirit of faith; what if it be affirmed even in true sanctification the
law of works is a mere passive thing, as the Kings high way, which a Christian
freely walks in, you have not a face to deny it, Psalm. 119.31. The Law has
an active power to teach, and is not merely passive; as Mr Town says.


Answ. If the Spirit of Grace bring forth in the Saints fruits of holiness
according to the law, then is the law to the Saints a rule of their walking,
which the Antinomians deny: Its true, It may be the law to the holy Spirit in
his person acting immediately in the Saints, is passive, for the law cannot
work on the holy Spirit; but that the ^aints are mere patients, and blocks in
all their holy walking, is gross Lib^rtinis^e, and makes God the Author of
sin, as before is said, and this way also the Saints are freed from the Gospel,
and the command of faith and all the promises no less then from the law;
because neither law nor Gospel can be a rule to the person of the holy Ghost,
in his immediate actions; the Spirit is free in his operations, and subjecteth
both law and Gospel to his gracious breathings, but is subject to none.

2. Mr. Town and Antinomians would lay upon Protestant Divines, that they
teach the Saints may walk in holiness without the grace of Christ, because they
will have the Saints under the law ruling and directing, and this law-ruling of
it self gives no grace to obey; bu^ this is a calumnious consequence; the
promises of the Gospel in the letter gives no grace to obey; the Spirit
blows when and where ^e lists, and gives grace freely to the gospel
preached: yet we reach not that any can believe and obey the gospel without the
grace of Christ.

3. The law so is passive of it self to Christ, to Adam in the s^ate of
innocence, in this sense, that the law, as the law, commands obedience to
both, but contains not any legal promise of giving grace to obey to either
Adam or Christ, As the Gospel contains a promise of bestowing grace to
believe in all the elect. Now if this be the cause why the justified are freed
from the law as a rule of Righteousness, because there is no legal promise
made to them by which they a^e enabled to keep the law: then was Christ Ie^us
and Adam in his innocence freed from the law as a rule of R^ghteousn^sse, which
is most absurd; for the law as the law, commanded Christ to fu^fill all
righteousness, Matthew. 3.15. but so did it Adam; ^u^ show a legal promise made
to Christ, by the law, that he should have grace to obey the law; indeed the
Lord prom^sed hi^ the Spirit above measure, but this was no law-promise: So God
created Adam according to his own image, with perfect conc^eated strength and
power to keep the law; but the law, as the law, made no promise to Adam, that
h^e should be k^pt in obedience, But if this be called action, or activitie in
the law, to rule, guide, direct and command obedience as a rule, then the law
is no wise passive; its more then the Kings highway; No way cries to the
conscience of the traveler, this is the way, no Kings way shows the traveller
his error, as the law, in its directing, ruling and teaching power, breaks
in upon the conscience, and declares to the justified man the way he should
walk in, and convinces him of his unrighteousness, and daily faults.

Town page 10. The Law wrappeth every man in sin, for the least
transgression; so that while a man remains a sinner, he necessarily abides
under this fearful curse.

Answ. Still Antinomians bewray their engine; If we say, even being justified
we have no sin, we lie; and who can say I have cleansed my heart, I am pure
from sin? and There is not a just man on earth, that sins not: 1 Ioh.
1.10. Prove. 20.9. Eccles. 7.20. Then there cannot be a man on earth, but he is
under the curse of God, but Antinomians say, and that truly, that the justified
persons are freed from the curse, then they have no sin, nay they cannot
sin, by their arguing, for they will have the curse essentially and
unseparably to follow sin, which is most false, sin dwells in all the
justified so long as they are here, but they are here delivered from the curse.

Our deliverance from misery and the bondage of the law is two fold, as our
misery is twofold. 1. There is a guilt of sin, How faith and New obedience are
the means of our deliverie from the misery of sin; the former from the guilt,
and that perfectly and at once, in justification; and the other from the blot
and indwelling and that by degrees, in sanctification.
or our obligation to eternal wrath, and all the punishments of sin
according to the order of justice by the law of God; The other misery is the
blot of internal guilt of sin, by which sin dwells in us by nature, as a
King and lord, Tyrant, awing us by the law of sin.

In regard of the former Christ is our Savior, merito by the merit of his
death; in regard of the latter Christ is our Savior, efficacia, by giving us
the holy Ghost, and faith to lay hold on Righteousness in Christ, and grace to
walk holily before him.

In regard of the former, we are freely and perfectly justified and pardoned
at once, from all sins, in our person and state, through the sense of this,
and in regard of deliverance from temporal judgments and doubtings, and fears
of eternal wrath, every day while we seek daily bread, we des^^e that our
sins may be forgiven; nor is this prayer a tempor^rie pattern that perished
with Christ, as some perve^sly (...); for Peter after the Lords ascension says
to Simo^ Magus, Act. 8.22. pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may
^e forgiven th^^.

In regard (...) are sanctified by d^g^ees never (...) sin is removed in (...)
th^reof, in justification; only sin ^welle^h in us, while we a^^ here.

In regard of the ^ormer misery, faith in Christ is the only (...), and way to
g^t out of our bondage and misery; in ^ega^d of the ^^^ter, R^pentance and the
whole trace of our new obedience, are the the means to escape out of this
misery; nor do we make acts of sanctification compartners and joint causes or
conditions in the work of justification; for this is from Christ alone, solely,
immediately; as by looking on the brazen serpent only, the stung Israelites
were cured: Nor does weeping or acts of men's obedience move the Lord to wash,
justify and pardon our sins, but repentance and new obedience are means
tending to our escaping out of the latter bondage; as the rising of the sun
is a way to the full noone-light day; though we can attain to no Meridian nor
full noone day of sanctifications, while the body of sin keeps lodging in us,
in this life; but the Law of works is not so enwrapt and entwined together (as
Mr. Town dreameth) that if a man lay hands on any, (...). of Grace. p. 1^.
even the least link, he inevitably pulls the whole chain on himself, as
he that is circumcised, Gal. 5. made himself debtor to the whole Law; For
circumcision, not only in the matter of justification, but also of
sanctification is now unlawful; So to repent and love the brethren, to obey
our parents, as looking thereby for remission of sins, should be unlawful
and a falling from Christ, but in the matter of Sanctification, and of
testifying our thankfulness to Christ for the work of our redemption, and as
the way to the possession of the kingdom, they are no^ unlawful, but
commanded as necessary duties, by which an entrance is ministered to us into
the heavenly kingdom.

How we are saved without works.
Yea our holy walking, since it is no merit, but a fruit of grace, and a
condition required in such as are saved, and have opportunity to honor Christ
that w^y, takes not away the freedom of Grace, for where the Scripture says,
we are s^ved by Grace, without works, as Tit. 3 Ephesians. 2. salvation is spoken
of there in regard of the title, right, jus, or claim the Saints have to heaven
excluding all merits of works; our obedience is not full, complete and perfect;
only they are counted so, and accepted in Christ, Phil. 4.18. Heb. 13.15, 16.
Col. 3.17.

Mr Town answers with other Antinomians; The just and wise God who accepts
every thing by due weight and measure* as it is found to be, he does not,
Asser. (...) page 22.
nay cannot account that which is but inchoat and partial for full and
complete obedience; nor can it stand with justice to accept any thing which is
not first perfect, seeing that perfection and absoluteness is the ground of
acceptance, both of our persons and performances; ye must make both the tree
and the fruit perfectly good before God.

2. What God (says he) has manifested to be detestable and accursed, that he
cannot accept: but he has manifested by scripture, that what ever is not
absolutely perfect, Asser. p^g. 7^.
is detestable and accursed, Gal. 3.10. Hab. 1.13. Romans 1.18. The proposition
is grounded on the immutablenesse of Gods nature, who cannot deny himself,
Iam. 1.18 and his exact justice, who will not suffer the loss of the least
title of his righteousness, Mat. 5.18. God is no respecter of persons, his Law
inviolable, and can suffer no abatement. H^w God accou^ts the g^od wor^s of the
justif^e^ perfect.


Answ. God in justification accounts us righteous in Christ, and positively
guiltless, as freed from obligation to eternal wrath, and clothed with
Christ's righteousness; but he accounts not us non-sinnets and free from
indwelling s^nne, that should be an unjust account, for we are not so; but God
accounts our works perfect only negatively, that is, such they are before
God, as he will not enter in judgment with us for them* but graciously
pardons the sins of th^se works, but God does not account these works
positively worthy of life eternal, even in Christ, as he accounts our
persons, far less does he judge them meritorious: hence there is a twofold
acc^eptation; one of Good will to our persons in Christ; that is that Good will
of free election, by which he render^^h us accepted in his beloved: there is
another acceptance of complacencie, according to which God is said to love and
reward our good works, even to a cup of cold water, Ioh. 14.21.23. Matthew.
10.42. 2 Thessalonians. 1.7. Heb. 6.10. and that of free grace, they are called
perfect as perfection is opposed to hypocritical; but not perfect simply,
Phil. 3.12. but the acceptance of our works in Christ is an acceptance inferior
to the acceptance of our persons in justification; hence God takes pleasure in
th^se that fear him, because they fear him, not as though his love quoad
affectum, in it self had a cause in the creature, or can wax or increase, or
can admit of a change, but because he bestows the fruits of his love out of
free grace and a gracious promise, to our sincere walking, and this is rather
the fruit of his love, amor quoad effectum, then Gods love it self; all this
proceeds from a gross mistake of the nature of justification.

I answer, 2. to that: That which is inchoat sinfully defective, and
imcompleat, that the righteous and unchangeable God cannot account perfect and
complete, or that which is sinfully defective, or that which is sinful, God
cannot account not sinful; It is true, it were an erroneous and unjust
account; now the proposition is true; but the assumption most false; the good
works of the regenerate and justified are sinful. But Gods accounting of them
perfect* puts no contradiction on them to account them not sinful: God
accounts not David's adultery to be an act of chastity; This is the Papists
argument against the imputed righteousness of Christ, which Antinomians being*
utterly ignorant of the nature of justification, bring against us; the other
part of the distinction is, That which is sinful and defective in it self,
and inherently, or really and physically, that God cannot account perfect, that
is, God cannot account it and the doer, legally free from obligation to
eternal wrath, for the satisfaction of another, the surety of sinners, who has
paid and suffered for it; that is most false, and should destroy the Protestant
justification, when we say God accounts the good works of believers good and
perfect, so as the imperfection and sin of them is removed; we mean not by
removing of the sin of these works, the total annihilation of sin, in its
essence root and branch, it dwells in us in its complete essence while we are
here, Romans 7.17.23. Prove. 20.9. 1 Ioh. 1.8.10. only the dominion, by
sanctification, is abated, and the guilt or obligation to eternal wrath is
removed in justification; and this Argument may well be retorted: Who ever is a
sinner, the righteous and immutable God whose judg^ment is ac^ording to verity,
and cannot suffer the loss of the least titl^ of his righteousness, Matthew.
5.18. cannot esteem him just, and perfectly righteous: But all men even the
regenerate, are sinners: No answer, no distinction can be accommodated to this
Argument, which may not be applied to their argument; for God is no less,
just, righteous, immutable, true, no respecter of persons, and his Law
inviolable in his accounting of persons righteous and perfect, then in
accounting of works righteous and perfect. Now that the fruits and the tree are
both good, and simply perfect and all the works of the justified perfect in
Christ, is a point of new divinity very contrary, first to Scripture which
says Iam. 3.2. in many things we offend all, 1 Ioh. 1.8. If we say we have no
sin, we deceive our selves, ver. 10. If we say we have not sinned, we make
him a liar, and his word is not in us* Antinomians say, John speaking of a mixed
multitude, is to be meant to speak of the unregenerate mixed with the
justified.

Answ. 1. John takes in himself. 2. He speaks of such as confess their
sins and are pardoned, ver. 9. (2) of such as have an Advocate in heaven, if
they sin, chap. 2.1. and these are the justified, and regenerate, and Prove.
20.9. Who can say I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? he
speaks not there of a mixed multitude, but sends a Law-defiance to all
mankind, justified, or not justified; yea, Eccles. 7.20. There is not a just
man on earth, that does good and sins, no; these words are so wisely framed,
that they exclude not the justified in Christ, who undoubtly do good, but they
do not so good (says Solomon) but they sin; so Paul complains, of sin
dwelling in him, Romans 7. (2) Sin original after justification, to
Antinomians must be no sin, as to Papists its no sin, after baptism; (3)
If our works be perfect in the sight of God, then we may be justified by our
works; for Antinomians say if Christ esteem our works perfect, he may account
us righteous for them and we may be said to be justified both by works and by
grace, because its free grace that the Lord accounts our works Righteous: (4)
We constantly deny that Christ by his death, has given to our good works a
power of meriting heaven, but if God in Christ, count then simply perfect,
there is no reason to deny this, because our works are simply perfect by
Antinomians way; this is more Pharisaicall then Popish justification.

FINIS.
