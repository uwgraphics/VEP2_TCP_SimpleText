Eugenia: OR, AN ELEGY UPON The DEATH of the HONORABLE Madam --.

Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus
Tam Chari Capitis? praecipe lugubres
Cantus, Melpomene, cui liquidam Pater
Vocem cum cithara dedit.
-- Utinam modo dicere possem
Carmina digna Dea, certe est Dea carmina digna.

TO Lycophron.
I Received a Letter from the best of Men, enriched with all those Strains of
Civility and Goodness, which are so natural to him: There was one thing in it,
which I could not at first distinguish, whether it was a Complement, or a
Reproach; when, with so serious an Air, you Congratulate my late Repulse; You
seem to be as glad, as if I was saved from Shipwreck, or retrieved from a
Precipice. I have another Ingenuous, Gentile Friend in the World, who can bear
witness how Cold and Reserved I was in that Matter, and what slender
Encouragement I gave to those Advances, which were afterward made in my
behalf: I must needs say, I weighed every Consequence to a Grain, and easily
foresaw, what Childish and Revengeful Hands I was falling into; who only waited
for such a luscious Opportunity, that they might Grin, and show the foulness
and rancour of their Teeth for my last Poem: Did their ill Humor only
terminate in my self, it would require but little Stoicism to digest it, and I
could throw it off with a great Indifference; for it is but only passing by,
and disregarding these little Creatures, and their Clamours are quickly
silenced: But when they are sapping the Foundation of our Religion, and English
Liberty, -- Quis tam ferreus ut teneat se? This would unlosse Dumbness it self
into an Exclamation, when he sees his Country going to be Destroyed.

These were the Men, who, in the Two last Reigns, were made the wretched
Instruments to bring in Tyranny, and Superstition upon us in a full Torrent,
and Impunity has hardened their Foreheads to nibble at the same Attempts in
this: Indeed they were like Puppets managed upon a Wire by the Craft and Finess
of the Jesuits, a Race of Men sprung up in the World to extinguish all that is
Just, Honest, or Merciful in it; So that the Character, which wise Tacitus
gives of one of the Roman Emperors, exactly Quadrates with them: He says that
he was Natura factus, and consuetudine exercitus, velare odium fallacibus
blanditiis: So these are framed by Nature, and trained up by Custom, to
dissemble their Hatred with false Caresses. It was by these Cajoleries, which
any, but themselves, might have seen through; the Cheat was so Transparent, that
they were wrought upon to give up the vital Privileges of their City without
the least Regret; and so not only Enslaved themselves, but Betrayed their
Posterity too, for which they were only Guardians, and Trustees, and that with
the Breach of the most Solemn Oath that ever was Administered. And here I think
it a just Opportunity to record an Action of one, who was nearly related to me;
Who though the Rites of a Father's Funeral were to be performed that very day,
Yet he left the Body Dead upon the Table, and went in his Mourning (a very
proper Habit even upon that Occasion too) to Assert his native City in its last
Agonies, and gave his Vote against the Surrender: This was such an Instance of
honest Gallantry in our Family, that it may serve to Expiate for all the
Misfortunes which have since befallen it; and yet these Designs are farded
over with very specious Pretenses, and as an illiterate Person preferred to an
Office, does his Name, so they Stamp the Church upon every thing that comes
under their Hands, but she does not stand in need of such Defenders; It Is not
the Vollies of their Oaths, nor the Noise of their profane Healths, that, like
a Tempest, must root Her the faster: And I think it extremely hard that the
best Constituted, and most equally poised Government upon the Face of the
Earth, should be undermined by every turbulent Pretender, and railed at by
every saucy Mechanic: But their Ignorance is an Antidote against their Malice,
and the File will be too hard for their Teeth, let them be never so Venomous.

There is one thing (my Lycophron) would kindle Resentment even in the most
sedate Temper, to see a bold Fellow mount the Pulpit, and there Desecrate, and
Profane that solemn Place, by almost downright Ribaldry against the
Government; where, without any regard to Sense, Civility, or good Manners, he
Vomits up his ill-bred Choler, manfully Encounters with his own Shadow, and
makes Passes at the Air; Whilst the Audience are Tortured upon the Rack, and
are in Pain for him, when he has not one Blush of Modesty to be ashamed for
himself: He seems to be a Compound made up of Brass and Lead, which Aldrovandus
tells us was a Metal once found in the Mines of Germany, all Effrontery and
Dullness; He is an Ordeal Plough-share Red-hot, or rather a Rocket-Candle, which
sputters out a ridiculous Fire for a time, and then goes out with a Crack, and
proves Offensive to the whole Company: Indeed an Embargo should be laid upon
his Text, and be strictly examined, whether Contraband-Divinity does not lie
under it, for a Bible and a Sword are equally dangerous in the Hands of such
Men. I have often applied a Story to them in my Thoughts, which I have
somewhere read in a Physician; He relates that the Heir of an Honorable Family
made his Addresses to a Young Lady, which she answered with a mutual
Complaisance; there was no Exception to his Person, for it was very Inviting,
there was a plentiful Estate, and a firm Consent on both Sides: But it seems
the unhappy Gentleman had formerly been bit by a Dog, which he did not then
apprehend to be Mad; and Books tell you amazing Stories of those, who are so
assaulted, that they have been almost changed into the Nature of those
Creatures, which have so infected them, that they will Lap, Foam, and Bark like
them; So here the poisonous Ferment, which had lain so long Dormant in his
Blood, took this fatal Occasion to exert it self; For upon his Wedding-Night,
he made most dreadful Howlings, and with a Violence so sudden, that it admitted
no rescue, he tore the poor Bride to pieces: So these furious Bigots devour the
Church, they make Court to, and pour out their precious Balms, only in order to
her Funeral.

I believe (Lycophron) you Concur with all those, who love the Prosperity of
England, in wishing a Fortunate and Glorious Descent upon France; and that our
Great Scipio would Transport the War to the Walls of the Modern Carthage, which
is as Cruel, and Perfidious, as the Old; and the Gallick is as false as the
Punick Faith: We will then be a Convulsion in their Bowels, and Tear them worse
than the Earthquake did Sicily. Our English Stomachs will never be Satisfied,
till they have swallowed those Mushrooms, as Aelian tells us, in his Natural
History, That a sick Lion cannot be recovered, till he has eaten an Ape. There
is one thing you cannot but observe, which runs with a very popular Train, That
some People are very liberal of their Invectives against the Dutch, when take
them on every Side of the Prospect, they are useful Neighbors, and a
seasonable Allie; the Proofs they have given of their Courage, in Vindicating
their Liberty against Spain, with the Heroes of Nassau at the Head of them, are
not to be paralleled in History: And as for Learning, the Church of Rome, as
diffusive as it is, never equaled them; Petau, though a Nervous Writer, never
came up to Grotius; Bidderman, a delicious Poet, is distanc'd by Daniel, and
Nicolas Heinsius; and all the Doctors of the Sorbon, and Jesuits of the
Minerve, did never reach either Vossius, Father or Son: As for a Climate we
should cease to Ridicule that, unless we had a better of our own, where we have
not Sun enough to ripen any generous Fruit; And I heard a smart Italian once
say, Il mezzo dell' anno fra voi Inglesi e spaventole borasca and l' altro
mezzo e invierno, Half of your English Year is terrible Wind and Rain; and the
other half is Winter. Some Men are very apt to charge others with Ingratitude,
when they are enormously Guilty of it themselves, and that accompanied with
Stupidity too; For though they were relieved with Manna in the Wilderness, yet
they still long for the Darkness and Slavery of Egypt: These, though Masters of
so much Knowledge, yet were so Senseless as to worship the Leeks and Oynions in
their Gardens; and we have some who can match them in that Point of their
Idolatry too: For as they swallowed their Deities in a Salade, so the Papists
chew down their God in a Wafer. If they should ever bring the French in upon us
(but I hope Heaven and Earth, and the Stars in their Courses will fight against
them) we shall be all shut up in one common Dungeon together; and then we shall
have nothing left to do, but to Revile, and shake our Chains one at another; or
if there is any Civility remaining, it will be like that which passed between
Two French Porters at the going through a Gate: They had both heavy Burdens
upon their Necks, but were resolved to stoop down lower with a Complement; and
the Seen of nice Behavior between these well-bred Gentlemen was after this
manner, C'est a vous, pardonnez moy, C'est a vous, passez; Which I will take
the liberty thus to Translate; The Pre-eminence of place belongs to You, Noble
Sir; To whom the other submissively Reparteed, I most humbly beg your Pardon,
and kiss your Hands, it is more strictly your due as the Elder Slave, therefore
move on without any more Ceremony. I would make an Apology to any one but your
self for this Poem, but you can Witness how long it has lain by me, and by
what Importunities it is at last Solicited out of that Retirement: Besides, I
am certain, you will be pleased with any thing that contributes to my
Recreation; For you know I only use Poetry as a Relaxation from severer
Studies: and as I disturb no Man's Diversion, so I desire the fair Liberty to
be allowed mine. I must confess, when I am stuck fast in an Antiquary, have
lost my way in a dark Author, and made my Head Ache with Polemical Gladiators; I
then refresh my wearied Spirits with more brisk and lively Meditations; that
is, I walk up an Hill to throw off so much Phlegm and Indigestion. There is a
Notion obtains amongst some Weak People, that if a Man is not at the Anvil, or
the Hammer, that he is Lazy and Vn-employ'd: They can form no Idea of the
Fatigues of the Mind, what a Labor it is to lay down Propositions, and draw
true Inferences from them, to reconcile the repugnancy of Authors, and rightly
to understand the Meaning and Customs of the Ancients: But I will for the
future Abridge my self of this Pleasure too, least what is Innocent at first,
by too much Indulgence, may become an ill habit, and the Distemper growing
Chronical, I shall relapse into Rhiming every Spring and Fall. You will find in
one place, that I have Translated a piece of Tasso, Composed in that sort of
measure, which they call their Octaves; and which the Italians extremely
delight in, beyond their Terzetti, Sciolti and Sdruccioli, a sort of Verses
which you are well acquainted with: Mine is but a rude Essay, and it is only
fit for the Sublime Genius of Mr. Dryden, to imitate and pursue to an
Excellence.

And now (Lycophron, Dulcissime rerum) I must be farther removed from You,
almost out of the Commerce of the World, at least the Beau Monde; I shall now
more than ever Lament the loss of your Polite, and Obliging Conversation, when
I am deprived of One who was so Judicious in his Remarks, and Candid in his
Censures; and whom I never saw the least Passion to dis-compose: I never
observed him Uneasy, but when the Calamities of Mankind made him so, and then a
generous Pity touched him, and he Languish'd, when others were in Distress: He
had always a serene Countenance, and cheerful Spirit, and an attracting Gayety
displaying it self in all his Discourses: His Raillery was very Just and
In-offensive, and only had due Picquancy, which is the relish of the Fruit; but
when any Points of Learning came before him, no Difficulty was too hard for his
Solution. Then like another Xerxes he cut through Mount Athos to make a passage
for his Eloquence to flow; and he levelled the harsh and irregular Soil into a
smooth and equal Surface: His Reason was Free and Vnconfin'd, not fettered by
the Barbarous Terms of the Schools; and his Rhetoric streamed from him with a
gentile Easiness, without the least Affectation. Indeed always Profit and
Delight were derived from his Mouth, as if the Swarm of Bees which pitched upon
St. Ambrose's Face, had lighted upon his too, and Sweetness has distilled from
his Lips ever since, with a Source never to be exhausted. There is One thing
Particular in our Friendship, That it has hitherto shined without a Cloud, and
there has not been the least Pique or Disgust to over-cast it; if any thing
had been capable to give it Disturbance, I fancy it would be like the Well
mentioned by Pliny, which if any Dirt was thrown into it, it would Rage and
grow Impetuous, till it had cleared it self from the impure Mixture, and
recovered its limpid Beauty again: And as it first rose with a Luster, so in
this Decline of our Years, let it go down so too; but if Providence ordains,
that I must never see that Face again, which is the seat of Modesty, Courtesy
and good Nature, yet let your Correspondence reach me, though at this distance:
A Letter from you, like one fixed to an Arrow, and shot into a Besieged Town,
will flatter me with some hopes that Succors are approaching. Though I am
Buried to all the World besides, yet let me live in the Thoughts of Lycophron,
and find a shelter in that Breast, whereon I have so often taken delight to lay
my Head: As Dying Augustus to his Livia, Let me enjoin You to cherish the
Remembrance of our former Endearments, and constantly to believe, That
Lycophron was Loved with the strongest and most Sincere Passion that ever Heart
was capable of, By

His most Faithful, and, Affectionate Servant, MAT. MORGAN.

AN ELEGY Upon the DEATH of the Honorable Madam --
THE feathered Race had left their downy Nest,
Aurora, like a Bride was early Dressed;
Gayly Attired, in all her Nuptial Beams,
Her Dawn had chased away deluding Dreams;
Fancy too faithfully Records does keep,
Doubly disturbs us, waking and asleep;
False Lights the Traveller no longer tire,
Led in a Round by a fantastic Fire:
Now Melibaeus did his Flocks unfold,
And the day broke through Portals made of Gold,
Which Nature had mixed up with vivid Blew,
And his strong Beams exhaled the Pearls of Dew;
Now the Bolognian Stone imbibing Light,
Impregnated with Luster scattered Night;
It was upon this most delicious Morn,
When all things the Creation did adorn,
That Damon to an Eminence did repair,
There to suck in refreshing Gales of Air;
A Double benefit we by Walking find,
It does dilate our Lungs, but more our Mind;
Unactive into Lethargies we sink,
But there without Constraint we Breath and Think;
His Eyes did various Objects here pursue,
And something showed peculiar to his View;
Below a Precipice there flows a Tide,
Whose narrow Water does Two Shores divide,
Just makes a Passage for it self to Glide;
Yet this thick Lake transports the Merchant's wealth,
Below is Riches, and above is Health;
Here lofty Rocks before the Deluge stood,
A stately Guard to such an homely Flood;
And the hard Stones are clothed with verdant wood:
And here they had their Primitive abode,
The breaking of the Vortex we Explode;
Small Trees sprought up unto the waters nigh,
But Oaks do grow upon the Mountains high,
As if they from the Ocean did fly;
In vain it self the cautious Timber saves,
It must be pressed for Battles on the waves;
Diverting Lawns do both the Summets Crown,
For on each Top there is a lovely Down;
Here you enjoy a free and open Sky,
And underneath do shining Pebbles ly;
False and Transparent as an Hypocrite,
Or like a Fop that glitters to your sight,
But with intrinsic Value is not Bright;
With precious Gems the Eastern Country Teems,
Assisted by the Sun's prolifick Beams;
Our Climate does depreciate their worth,
It has not strength to bring a Jewel forth;
In an harsh Soil Nature like Mandrakes groans,
And is delivered of abortive Stones.
There runs along the Valiant Britains Coast,
Which haughtily Plinlimmon's Hills does boast;
The Severn there does rise, it is so high,
The River seems Extracted from the Sky;
But what exalts your Admiration most,
Here you grow well with very little Cost;
A Sovereign water through a Spout does flow,
Which Nature, like her Treasures, has placed low;
With Pain to things of Value we arrive,
We climb for Cocoes, and for Pearls we dive;
It Is of a Temper betwixt hot and cool,
As Sanative as was Bethesda's Pool;
Inveterate Ulcers here dried up are seen,
Gehasi's Leprosy might here be Clean;
Concretions of Gravel it does wast,
Strong in Effect, but soft unto the Taste;
It for the Diabetes does provide,
And stops that Current with a Counter-tide;
So in the narrow Streights of Gibraltar,
Which both from Spain and Africa is not far,
The waters flow out of a mighty Urn,
Those Issues under the same Sea return;
For a Sub-aqueous passage they obtain,
The Plummet turns, and they creep back again:
And now they are carrying on a brave Design,
The rugged Situation to refine;
To raise the Stream, and to retrieve its Heat
Like the Projector's Humor, wise and great;
Nature her obvious Largesses does deal,
Her Fountains quench, her Mineral-waters heal:
This does a Confluence of People draw,
It we may justly call the Bristol Spaw;
Here the delicious hand of skilful White,
Who with Taille Douce does all the world delight,
Should with his nicest Touch describe its site;
A coarse Engraver rudely does disgrace,
With his harsh Strokes so Beautiful a place;
That Art and Verse are both beyond his ken,
One cannot tell which is duller, Tool or Pen;
Of Conversation would engross the Sense,
A Man of voluble Impertinence;
Though he talks on at such a furious rate,
It Is harder to Perform than it is to Prate:
It Is only you the brighter Powers above,
Know how sincerely I that City love;
For only you are conscious to those Sighs,
Which thick and frequent unto Heaven do rise;
When their Calamities do make me smart,
And what they suffer, wounds me to the Heart:
But when indulgent Fortune proves more soft,
The Scale that is deprest does mount aloft;
Then their Prosperity brings me Relief,
The Joy does equal then my former Grief;
You a fresh suppliant I again invoke,
And with new Incense let your Altars smoke;
Let there a Guardian-Angel always be,
To mitigate the Tempests of the Sea;
That they of prosperous Gales may never fail,
Let a full Trafick always fill the sail;
Of mutual Love let them the influence feel,
Their Feudes let a Balsamic Temper heal;
Let Charity like to their Wealth increase,
And what all other Joys consummates, Peace;
This Living is my passionate Desire,
And with these fervent Wishes would Expire.
Whilst this bright Landscape Damon's Thoughts delight,
An ancient Object did arrest his sight;
This quickened with fresh speed his joyful Feet,
He hastily advanced his Friend to meet,
And with this courteous Language him did greet.
Dam. I of this happy Meeting now am proud,
But a false Lover may my Alcon shroud;
When from afflicted me he did withdraw,
The Face I so much loved, I never saw;
You on a Journey upwards then was bent,
And since you have not a kind Message sent;
Though we from thence do never footsteps trace,
Yet by a Patent of peculiar Grace,
You're come to tell the Wonders of the Place;
So that a Patriarch's Blessing I do gain,
I both a Friend and Angel entertain.

Alc. Damon, I would be rightly understood,
I still am Alcon, real Flesh and Blood.

Dam. I know it is not Civility to look,
On what you Read, nor pry into a Book;
But you I am sure will answer the Demand,
What is it you hold in your Obliging Hand?
Which such a dazzling Ornament receives
From Marble Colors, and from Gilded Leaves.

Alc. It is a Poem, reeking from the Mint,
Which a great Personage Celebrates in Print;
Two Things in me did raise a curious Flame,
The Greatness of the Task and Author's Fame;
For a just Praise here is a mighty Theme,
He still has mine, as once the World's Esteem;
The Nation did his Genius extol,
He rid in Triumph to the Capitol;
Over Words obsolete a Conquest gains,
And Barbarous Language Captive led in Chains;
Nay, France and Italy he did Subdue,
And forced them to an Homage that was Due;
He made them all their Contributions bring,
To Form those Lines this ancient Bard did Sing;
Our English Tongue He doubly did Refine,
When in a proper Sphere this Star did shine;
Support his Laurels, which begin to fade,
He was not Born to be Condemned to Shade;
A public Fund should furnish his Expense,
Not live a Rent Charge upon Providence;
Our Enemies as a Reproach may vaunt,
That England suffered such a Pen to want;
Though a Deserter from our Church He ran,
Pity his Errors, but Admire the Man;
Consider that we had him in the Prime,
In his Ascendant of delicious Rhyme,
When Honey was extracted from his Thyme.
His Measures did with Light and Vigor run,
We had his Rising, Rome his Setting-Sun;
Blood in our Age grows Vappid and Austere,
And then he past the Alps with Vinegar;
But our Fair Albion did his Youth delight,
Whose Shore is safe, and all her Rocks are white.

Dam. That Lady all Parnassus might Command,
And Incense she deserved from every Hand;
The Native matter does exceed all Cost,
On rich Materials the Painting's lost;
You don't Leaf-Gold on Orient Jewels lay,
Nor dawb fine Parcclane with common Clay;
Encomiums on her unforced did flow,
Chaplets of Roses every one did throw;
With suitable Presents did the Subject treat,
Like her Looks, florid, as her Manners, sweet.

Alc. Another Heroine (my Damon) Died
In Blood, but yet in Virtue more allied;
We the Ledaean Stars will now displace,
And these Two Sisters shall the Heavens grace;
Now in one Orb this most Illustrious Pair,
Shall with an Aspect radiate more fair,
Then Ariadne's Crown, or Berenice's Hair.

Dam. Slight words with vast Resentments do not suit,
Th'importance of the Sorrow stuck us mute.
Once an Assassin with a Barbarous will,
The Lydian Monarch did attempt to kill;
But filial Pity to prevent the Blow,
Unloos'd his Tongue, and made strange Accents flow:
But here our Anguish silent did become,
The Horror of her Fate here struck us Dumb;
And Chlio the Majestic Queen of Wit,
With the News blasted fell into a Fit;
But now her Spirits with fresh Vigor run,
For in her Face they have sprinkled Helican:
Her Death for melting Elegies does call,
And all the Muses should hold up the Pall;
Mix with her Funeral Unguents Giliad's Balm,
And bind the Cypress with Triumphant Palm;
She still aspired unto her blessed abode,
Her Soul rose higher with the Bodies load.

Alc. She was (my Damon) Pious and Devout,
Not like the Custom of the vulgar Rout,
Who Herd themselves under an holy Roof,
To make wry Faces, and fold down a Proof;
In a new Dress their Neighbors to outshine,
And show the staring Parish that they are Fine:
She listened with as strict Religious Awe,
As when the Israelites received the Law;
Though the Instructor might by her be led,
For She had all his Topics in her Head;
Was drowned in Ecstasy with David's Lyre,
Like Sheba's Queen his Son she did admire:
Shunned his Example, did his Precepts mind,
Though to her Sex he was profusely Kind.

Dam. In a contracted Sphere She brighter shone,
(We Grieve and Pray most heartily alone;)
And She would often privately withdraw,
Then her Omniscience only kneeling saw;
She many Hours and late did then bestow,
And then her Tears in silent Streams did flow;
They Piously, but yet in vain were spilt,
'Cause for Ablution they found no Guilt;
For the superfluous Tribute of her Eyes,
To weep out others Debts might well suffice;
On her Account so much they might abate,
And with her Merit Superarrogate;
Fervent and Constant she her Vows did pay,
She did her self and not by Proxy pray,
Like to the Roman Lady's easy way:
When too much Holiness the Priest commands,
Which like a Drug does ly upon their hands,
In Gaming they a Remedy do seek,
And his Injunctions they throw off at Gleek;
They do not Louis-d'ors, or Guinneys take,
Pater's and Ave-Mary's down they stake;
The Looser's forced to pray, but she that Wins,
Transfers this Expiation for her Sins.
Horace's Rustic once his Eyes did Tire,
The current of the Flood he did admire;
How that with Windings did it self embrace,
The former still successive Waves did trace;
His Time and Patience fruitlesly did wast,
He gaped in vain till all the Stream was past;
With an Eternal Volume that did glide,
He might as well have sprouted by its side:
So Envy here Consumed her self in vain,
To see of Virtues such a mighty Train;
Vast Numbers were before, and she did find,
That still a long Retinue was behind;
Thick Volumes on her loaded Shelves did stand,
So ranged, that they were ready at Command;
Like Soldiers waiting Orders they did stay,
Were not false Musters, but in real Pay.
EVGENIA in a finer Mold was made,
Then only to keep Authors for Parade;
She to divert her did not stand in need
Of Monsieur Scudery, or Calprenede;
But their elaborate Trifles she did slight,
She spoke more Wit than both those Two could Write:
When the fond Ladies for their Heroes smart,
And Pity Tiridates from their Heart,
Then to her Closet was a liberal Door,
For the Rich Learning, Medicines for the Poor.
The Labourer who at the Plow does tug,
When he is Sick, then Ginger is his Drug;
Or some Specific of a Charlatan,
They Live and Dye as Cheap as e're they can
The Place she did with her own Products fill,
Administered what she did first Distill;
Diseases, never so Monstrous, she could tame,
An healing Spirit on her Waters came;
With a calm Influence it there did move,
And peaceful Health was brought you by a Dove;
Without his sting you did the Serpent feel,
The Viper in her Treacles too did heal.

Alc. EVGENIA was the Minion of Fate,
Learning, Wit, Beauty, and a great Estate,
And what can richer Blessings Complicate?
But Wealth's like Fresco-Painting on a wall,
Where Shades with curious Adjustment fall;
Although the Coloring looks very Gay
Saltpeter without time will it betray,
And Siegnior Verrio's Pencil must decay.
But Wit to after-Ages down will pass,
A Monument more durable than Brass;
Some Husbands wealthy Heiresses do get,
And their own Fortunes like to Moths they fret;
Upon their mighty Portions they presume,
And in the Flame at last themselves consume;
They at each Check do into Anger flash,
The passive Tool is Keeper of their Cash;
He like a Steward daily must provide,
Materials for their Wantonness and Pride,
Their Faults must never see, or else must hide;
EVGENIA wisely managed what she brought,
And other Wives by her Example taught.

Dam. Don't you remember that some Years ago,
I praised this noble Lady;

Alc. Yes I do;
You were Transported beyond usual bounds,
So much the Ecstasy of Joy confounds;
So heated we could scarce come near the Fire,

Dam. It was EVGENIA did my Breast inspire;
Still on my mind the strong Impression lies,
Liking at first to wonder did arise;
So sweet, yet so commanding was her Meene,
In her an Unaffected Air was seen;
Her Questions all were Pertinent and Wise,
With easy turns of Wit in her Replies:
The Author had the Honor to show her St. John 's College.
The curious Workmanship she did applaud,
The Structure great, as was the Founder, Laud:
Here Two successively they can relate,
The Props and Ornaments of Church and State;
Them in a different Character you must seek,
One was Magnanimous, the other Meek;
A Third has now a Mitre on his Head,
Whose Virtues equal, cannot surpass the Dead;
Here Famous Men do constantly Preside,
Still as the hopeful Blossoms dropped and died,
Emergent Wits have still that Loss supplied.
This Mansion sweet Amariel does grace,
Goodness is in his Temper, and his Face;
And once the public Fasces he did weild,
For such a Prudence 'twas a proper Field;
He was not Partial, justly was Severe,
They did not dread their Punisher, but revere;
And upright Lycidas does there reside,
Seems Rough at first, but not one Grain of Pride,
Integrity cannot be known until it is tried.
But then with rich Discoveries you are blessed,
When you have dived into his honest Breast;
His Fortune is proportioned to his Mind,
Though not his Merit, Generous and Kind:
Menalcas by the Learned is admired,
He seems, in what he Prints, to be inspired;
With such Address he for that Subject fights,
He the Example is of what he writes;
Under an happy Aspect he is Born,
Knowledge, both to enlarge and to adorn;
With such a charming Gravity does move,
That whilst you Reverence you needs must Love;
As Courtiers surfeited with being Great,
For their Retirement choose an homely Seat,
And there accept a clean, though course-spun Treat.
So since EVGENIA me so far did Bless,
As to be pleased with such a mean Address;
I on that happy Favor still will Dote,
It is a Canton added to my Coat:

Alc. Oh! Damon, She was exquisitely Bred,
Traversed her own, did foreign Countries tread;
To Paris went, but did not there repair
For Toys, to raffle at St. German's Fair;
Of learned Conference she reaped the Fruits,
Heard their Harangues, and managed their Disputes.
Madam Le Feure did her Friendship court,
Nature exactly did their Tempers sort;
So that betwixt them Wit was current pay,
The English Bullion with the French allay;
This Lady Monsieur d'Acier did Wed,
The Partner of his Studies and his Bed;
Nothing in her was Trivial or Light,
Like polished Armor ponderous and bright.

Dam. Nature did Children to her Womb deny,
But did that want (if one it is) supply,
For where in them does the great Pleasure lie?
If wicked grown, their Birth you do deplore,
And they are greater Burdens then before;
Heavier then that a Mother once did feel,
With whom harsh Nature cruelly did deal,
Her Torments sharper than Ixion's Wheel;
She could not be unloaded of her Freight,
But Swelled and Labored with a monstrous Weight;
The Ligatures almost to breaking strains,
And she had all but those of Childbed Pains;
So in her Bed the mournful Wretch was laid,
Beyond all Remedies, and Lucina's Aid.
Till Death the kinder Midwife cut her Life,
And this made way for the incision-Knife,
Her Belly opened after that she died,
An Infant in her Womb was petrified;
In their Enquiry thus they were beguiled,
For there they found a Statue for a Child:
This happened at Sens in France, related by Roussett.
And Nostredame with his Divining Care,
It did foretell, the Instance was so rare;
Augustus with his Poets did Converse,
Horace and Virgil to him did rehearse:
Although they cheerful Subjects did Compose,
Yet they were Pensive both, though not Morose;
For Wits they say are melancholy Men,
As the Ink shines that is Blackest in the Pen;
Mecoenas did the Emperor surprise,
Betwixt a sighing Breast, and streaming Eyes;
So Mothers of their Children the most proud
On Phantasms dote, and hug a weeping Cloud;
And when she sung her own melodious Songs,
The Quire of cheerful Birds about her throngs;
As Strada's Nightingal once strained her Throat,
Of a sweet Shell to imitate the Note;
Her Voice unto the loftiest Pitch did raise,
For even Birds ambitious are of Praise;
And when her Warbles she could mount no higher,
Fell dead with emulous Pangs upon the Lyre;
Alexandrinus says, a Chord did lie,
Sadly dismembered, when 'twas strained too high:
And then a Grasshopper the Rupture healed,
Who is the harmless Syrene of the Field;
He to the Wound a quick relief did bring,
The loving Insect gratefully did Sing,
And in the vacant place supplied the string;
Music the secret exquisitely knows,
Our Passions how to move and to Compose;
With lively Strokes it makes our Spirits bright,
And Martial ones inflame us for a Fight,
Fit for a Warrier and a Carpet-Knight;
For all agreeable purposes it serves,
When a sweet Palsy shakes the tuneful Nerves;
Some Men Religion in sower Faces place,
Learning and Sense despise, are all for Grace;
Who scatter Dullness wheresoever they come,
And at a mighty distance can benumb;
Like the Torpedo whose cold Blood is such,
It stupifies the Hand that does it touch;
Are like the Animal with capricious root,
A mixture it is betwixt a Plant and Brute;
He has not tender Feet or Flesh to walk,
But grows upon an heterogeneous Stalk;
The Ground of its adjacent Grass deprives,
As wild and strange as Tartary where it Thrives;
With bleating Life does such a likeness keep
A ravenous Woolf mistook it for a Sheep;
These with malicious Spasms do always grin,
And think to be Harmonious is a Sin;
When Protestants did first begin in France,
Had Calvin but indulged the Folk to Dance,
The Reformation then had farther spread,
They would not Converts be with Heels of Lead;
Their Genius was discouraged by these Men,
Who against innocent Fiddles drew their Pen;
Against that with dire Anathema's did write,
Which is the noblest of Mankind's delight,
I mean besides these Men of Grace and Spite.
Whereas one Orpheus with his strains of Love
Had given them Heaven below, and one above.

Alc. Nothing Impertinent did her Time devour,
Of frivolous Visits did not make a Tour;
Where they for Fashions strive as for a prize,
And absent Reputation Sacrifice;
There in consult each does her part dissect,
And there lay open every small defect;
Some are Devout, but then are seeming Saints,
Another's Fair, but then I fear she Paints;
One is good-natured, but an arrant fool,
Her Color Fucus is, and Spanish-Wool;
Another has a quick Majestic Eye,
But then her ill-set Body is a-wry;
So every one her chattering Rival Apes,
And when they once fall out we know their shapes.
Some do their Passion and their Time abuse,
And others Patience, with their billet doux;
For as the Learned Petrarch has defined,
Love drawn from Phlegm, and to its height refined,
Is when we muse, or weep, or write our Mind.
These three it in a golden Chain does link,
It does consist of Thoughts, and Tears, and Ink; Pensieri e lagrime e
inchiostro. Petr.

Her Offspring was of a more lasting race,
Which Sickness cannot deform, nor Time deface;
As Pallas in the Thunderer was bred,
Nothing but wisdom issued from her Head;
On sly Detractors she did always frown,
Tender of others Credit, as her Own.
The Royal Ermin loves the sweetest Grass,
Nothing can force it through the Dirt to pass;
'Twill rather fall into the Hunters toil,
Then its Prerogative-skin with Foulness spoil.

Dam. EVGENIA too in Painting did delight,
Music does charm the Ear, and this the Sight;
She with a skilful readiness could tell,
In what nice Touches each one did excel;
The Pieces when produced did quickly know,
This to be Raphael's, that of Angelo;
To what bold flights the noble Titian flew,
And the sweet Passion that old Palma drew;
These Men do on their Darling fancies dote,
As Bega on his Burdock and his Goat.
A curious Piece within the spacious Hall
Of Sir Henry
Wotton, hung too low upon the wall;
The Pencil here two snarling Dogs did draw,
With flaming Nostrils and a threatening Paw;
Blood in their angry Veins did seem to beat,
What lay before them both, was painted Meat;
A living Mastiff did decide the fray,
And from the colored Rivals tore the Prey,
The Picture thus deformed he more did prize,
And Valued it beyond his Embassies.

Alc. Some do with sudden indignation flush,
And Anger is mistaken for a Blush;
A sweet Complexion on her Cheeks did spread,
'Twas a pacifick Sea although 'twas Red;
Rich Clothes on vulgar Carcasses we see,
But Jewels do distinguish Quality.
EVGENIA was not proud of Varnished dust
She by the Body did her Soul adjust:
As once a wise Philosopher did say,
That we in Mirrours should our selves survey,
That suitable Customs might our Features grace,
The Life be correspondent to the Face.

Dam. She like --

Alc. Nay more --

Dam. You interrupt me Sir,

Alc. Who would not in this Case himself prefer?
More than seven Cities should contend for Her,
As once for Homer; for what eager Earth
Would not Ambitious be of such a Birth?
So that betwixt us only's the Contest,
By whom she should be Celebrated best.

Dam. She like a Jewel curiously was set,
But not to be a talkative Coquet,
Who Is prating wheresoever she does come,
As troublesome as was Mompesson's Drum;
But Modesty in EVGENIA was refined,
She like the Morning, blushed before she shined;
Things of Importance still her silence broke,
But you the Oracle must first invoke,
Not like those old Impostors in the Oak;
Who doubtful Resolutions did dispense,
And always whispered in a cloven Sense;
Then Moreland's Trumpet had been right applied,
As good an Oracle as ever ly'd.
If any thing had happened to displease,
She turned it off with an obliging Ease.
As once a Man who mixeth up Deceits;
Was bold to practice with his filled Receipts;
Who with false Succedaneums you does jilt,
But his smooth Tongue was like his Boxes Gilt;
A strict and Solemn Embassy did bring,
Unto Alphonso that Great Naples King;
Who Apothegmes spoke, and always wit,
And by Panormitan his Life is writ;
When the Harangue was by that Emp'rick made,
An Ear-wig Courtier told the Prince his Trade;
He smiled, and with a courteous Air replied,
A Reprimand to check the other's Pride;
How shall we (Friend) those great Physicians prize,
If that their Med'cine-makers are so wise?

Alc. Her injured Countrey's Part she still did take,
Nothing her upright Constancy could shake;
Though then the times had got a Calenture,
And inflamed Bigots raged beyond a Cure;
Then in Addresses fulsome Ink was spent,
And they Vowed solemnly what they never meant.
If one with words too lavishly does treat,
You always may suspect him for a Cheat;
With flatteries they did the Throne beguile,
And only in a Complement did smile;
Showed their Brass Faces, and their Leaden Style;
They called it Peace when 'twas a stupid Calm,
When Jesuits did false wares upon us palm;
As now in Venice, they in Masks did play,
And when detected they all sneaked away;
Nay then the Council Table was forsook
By an Old, Sharping, Antiquated F. P.
Rook;
Went to the Pope for a new Bale of Dice,
Who is the Head infallible of Vice;
These are the saucy Censurers of Kings,
Whose charitable Heat does give them wings;
Who otherwise within their Holes must keep,
And scarce are warmed with Life enough to creep;
With an affected, swelling Air they walk,
Stare, and look Big, but not much given to Talk;
The Devil that possesses them is Dumb,
And you may crack these Vermin on your Thumb;
Nay from a Field of Thistles they will run,
As once in Related by Philip de Comines.
France that great Exploit was done;
When these Scotch Pike-men raised their panick Fears,
And their armed Heads they did mistake for Spears;
These wretches desecrate the Holy day,
And come to Church to show they cannot Pray;
They draw their Swords in Poland at the Creed,
To manifest that for that Faith they would Bleed;
These Men would utter a malignant Joy,
If they our Laws and Gospel could destroy;
They are the wild Chimaera's of a Dream,
Are slavish Creatures harnessed in a Teem;
Sometimes you're Killed by an officious Friend,
So these subvert the Church they would defend.
As once a miserable King did lie
Half dead with Palsy, and the Lethargy;
The fits almost of Sense did him deprive,
And this great Person they Embalmed alive;
To wrap the Carcass in they daubed a cloth,
To warm and rouse up his Diseases sloth;
The Surgeon by an evil Genius led,
The Candle he applied to burn the Thread;
The Monarch was Calcined, He did expire
Another Hercules, in an unctuous Fire.
EVGENIA saw the mighty Torrent come,
Seine with the Tiber mixed, and France with Rome;
But righteous Moses did command the flood,
And then the liquid Crystal solid stood;
The Waters to arrest their Course he bids,
And now the Sea too had its Pyramids;
That Element turned Rock, it could not run,
He stopped the Ocean, Joshua the Sun;
With the last Hand to finish her Renown,
We'll to her Laurel add the Civick Crown.

Dam. And now methinks I see EVGENIA Dye,
And I my self a sable Mourner by;
Each took about her Bed a mournful Post,
Did by their Looks anticipate her Ghost;
Torquato Tasso.
Smarrisce il bell volto in un color,
Che non e pallidezza, ma candore;
EVGENIA'S Death was like a Summer's Night,
Where Darkness still is Checkered over with Light,
'Twas not a Paleness, but a lovely White.
And now apace the vital Heat abates,
And now the languid Pulse vermiculates:
There with her last Regrets she struggling lay,
Her Soul contending with reluctant Clay,
And Death by gradual Conquest forced its way;
It first attacked, and then dissolved the Eye,
Where Goodness lodged, and Wit did sparkling lie:
The traces of the Soul in it we find,
It is the legible Index of the Mind:
Nature with Outworks does this Fortress hold,
With curious Coats the texture does enfold:
Death passed them all, and made a Lodgment there,
And the last Pang destroyed the Crystal sphere:
No dismal Screech-Owl with fore-boding Wings,
Of her approaching Fate the message brings:
And then no Ominous worm Proclaimed her Dead,
A Maggot in the Board, or in the Head:
But a Seraphick Lover there did stay,
Her Soul when 'twas dis-lodg'd to waft away;
Waller, who Living, Her below did praise,
His Head encircled with immortal Rays,
And now with Luster Crowned instead of Bays;
With a fresh transport did renew his Theme,
Being defaecated now from Earthly phlegm;
Cowley darts out Extravagantly bright,
In a Pindarick, flowing Robe of Light;
The fair Orinda glitters by his side,
To a chaste Lover joined a virtuous Bride;
This Guest they with their choice Regards did prize,
And showed her the Apartments of the skies;
For here a Magazine of Sighs appears,
There Vials stood with penitential Tears;
Here was the Court of Register for Prayer,
And there the Ventiducts of Incensed Air;
Of mighty Grace there the Dispatches lay,
Were ready for the Envoys to convey;
Who unto Death-bed-sinners bring relief,
As once unto the Crucified Thief;
And here in Capital Beams their Names were filled,
Who under Popish persecutions smiled;
The Smithfield Confessors are Recorded here,
And Saints of the Parisian Massacre.
A Katharine de Medices.
Mother taught her Stripling to destroy,
A cruel Mother and a wicked Boy!
With some this fond Opinion does pass,
The melted Globe shall be a Venice Glass;
For when the Furnace has the Metal tried,
With its last Efforts it is vitrify'd;
Lightning with fury uncontrolled shall run,
Being re-inforc'd with Legions from the Sun;
Then Bolts of roaring Thunder shall be hurled,
And Heaven shall Bomb this Sublunary World;
An horrid Luster shines into the Cave,
In have they break the Ligaments of the Grave;
Out of its Niche Egyptian Mummey comes,
With mystic Characters and hardened Gums;
Fish on the scalded Shore shall panting lie,
And now for want of Element must die;
Then Earthquakes shall the Bars of Minerals wrench,
Flame shall absorp the waters of the Trench;
Then every Bird will like a Phoenix burn,
But no fresh Offspring rises from the Urn;
The Sea from tribute shall release the Streams,
And the pale Moon refund her borrowed Beams;
Her Quota to the Conflagration pays,
For by this Tenure she did hold her Rays:
The Silkworm does our Resurrection show,
If any thing resembles it Below,
That Gentile Infect does with changes grow;
Before in its soft Apartment it does lie,
Has speckled Wings, and is a Butter-flye;
Then unto higher Stages does arise,
Is an Aurelia, and a Chrysalis;
So we through various Revolutions pass,
We first are Earth, and that springs up to Grass,
When the Earth's moistened with a fertile Shower,
This Herbage bellowing Cattle does devour;
Then they by un-relenting Hands must die
The gnawing, acid Juice to satisfy;
So that the World we in a Circle beat,
Alternately are Eaten, and do Eat;
But now the scattered Atoms shall Unite,
Which were dispersed in Shipwreck or a Fight:
All wicked Authors now must Prostrate lie,
And dread those heavenly Powers they did defy,
Old Hobbs, Occhinus, and the Turkish-Spy;
Now they shall be condemned unto a Flame,
As here their Writings did deserve the same;
That Scribler with a stalking-Horse does advance,
And his sly Atheism lurks behind Romance;
That Masquerading, ill-dissembled Man,
Before the Scriptures puts the Alcoran;
And does prefer that Grand Impostor's Dove,
To that blessed Spirit of Immortal Love,
Who with Good motions in our Minds does move;
Young Rake-Hells with these Principles are imbued,
Who from their Cradles Swear, are early Lewd;
At a cheap rate their Consciences do sell,
Are very forward Candidates for Hell;
And then they imitate the Character
Of Clodius, or Unconverted R -- r;
His Soul grew Vigorous in his Health's decay,
With Tears of Penitence washed his Sins away;
His Reason which so long did smothered lie,
At last broke forth with stronger Energy;
On his last Scene of Life The Almighty smiled,
For Heaven is easy to be reconciled;
And now the haughty Monarchs must appear,
They who made others Tremble now must Fear;
Now they must give Account with Sanguine guilt,
For all the Blood they wantonly have spilt:
He that whole Nations offered to his Lust,
At last was crumbled into common Dust;
Stern Death did the Imperial Carcass shake,
And now the Trumpet does those Bones a wake;
But with this Thundering noise he is not called,
To make a War by which the World's enthralled,
Justice an Expiation will require,
For every Cottage that he set on fire;
And Divine Vengeance shall that Monster tame,
Who a whole Country kindled into flame;
Did impiously on sacred Ashes tread,
And rifl'd all the Monuments of the Dead;
A Promise only was a specious Lie,
And a repeated Oath a Perjury:
The Lives his Sword did shed are now Divine,
The humble Plants his Lillies shall outshine;
They languish all, with drooping Heads they fade,
And those now Triumph which he Martyrs made;
But in a Lake of Brimstone he shall swim,
And Lucifer's a Tyrant over him.
* Chiama gli habitator de l'ombre eterne,
Il rauco suon de la tartarea tromba,
Treman le spatiose, atre Caverne,
E l'aer cieco a quel rumor ribomba;
Ne si stridendo may de le superne,
Regioni del Cielo il folgor piomba;
Ne si Scossa gianmai trema la Terra,
Quando i vapori in sen; Tasso.
gravida Serra
* Then the hoarse Trump with its Tartarian sound,
Shades of eternal Darkness shall awake,
When the blind Air shall with the Noise rebound,
And the sad spacious Caverns all shall quake;
Lightning when hasty Flashes strike the ground,
Not from the Sky so swift a Flight shall make;
Nor shall the Earth such strong Convulsions shock,
When in her pregnant womb she Winds does lock.
EVGENIA'S Humor never was severe,
Nor made an injured Eye to shed a Tear,
Unless when Dead, as we lament Her here;
She does partake of other streams of Joy,
And the repeated Pleasure cannot cloy:
This is the rich Reward of all our Toil,
As in a River hunted Deer take Soil;
She now her Throne with just Grandeur does fill,
Whilst we poor Mortals pant it up the Hill.

Alc. Unjustly against Women we inveigh,
When their Ingredients are the finer Clay;
Hippolyta Taurella did complain,
Of a long Absence in a melting Strain;
Sweetly allured Castiglione home,
And made him quit for her the Charms of Rome:
Her Verses moved on easy, tender Feet,
Courtly as Ovid, like Tibullus sweet:
Scurman with great Accomplishments did shine,
A quick Philosopher, and deep Divine.
She at the noblest Quarries still did fly,
The Gordian Knots of Learning could unty;
Our Women should, who Government debate,
Her Modesty and Wisdom imitate;
Although at Holland they do Rail so much,
This Lady was a Scholar, yet was Dutch:
We should not Merit by a Climate Scan,
For Anacharsis was a Scythian;
One says that Countrey's very deep with Boggs,
And so is Ours, and the Air fat with Frogs;
This motive does the French Ambition whet,
That this delicious Morsel they might get;
A Dish of Grenovilles is their chiefest Treat,
Nay Spawn their eager Appetites would Eat;
They are by Hunger not by Courage led,
Glory's their Feint, but they do fight for Bread;
Padua did show it had a lively Sense,
When that It Is a thing highly Unusual to give a Woman a Degree, but this they
did out of Deference to her Worth.
Cornara Doctor did commence;
'Twas a just Favor they did they then confer,
And once they recompensed Desert in Her;
It otherwise has solemn Idiots reared,
Who what they want in Skill make out in Beard,
And then the Goat's the Leader of an Herd;
As Spaniard on you with Toledoe flies,
If you dare say Mustachoes are not wise;
Upon a seat of Learning it is a Blot,
To Dubb these Interlopers on the spot;
In Honor without Merit they improve,
Nothing for Money, but it is all for Love;
It Is like Chapines on which you raise a Dwarf,
Or as each whifler Arrogates a Scarf;
When the Venetian Zecca comes to fail,
The Senate offers Dignity to Sale:
Cheap Penny-worths of Titles they afford,
And you by inch of Candle are a Lord;
Although this Lady could not Ducats pay,
Her Learning all their Honor did Outweigh;
That The Lady Jane Gray.
Lady whom Misfortunes could not break,
Did Plato Read in his Mellifluous Greek;
When by the Axe the harmless Victim bled,
They struck off many Languages with one Head;
How Good and how Ingenuous they can be,
We in EVGENIA'S Example see.

Dam. We Have done with Praise, now Alcon Satyr bring,

Alc. Eugenia's Character has Dis-arm'd my Sting;
My Just Remarks would otherwise pursue,
And say there is no Man Honest, Just or True.

Dam. Kind Heaven avert the Omen!

Alc. Very few:
For the two Principles which Govern here,
And turn this Globe, are Interest and Fear;
Satyr we as a Remedy should prize,
Which does our Vice impartially Chastise;
You don't with easy Blasts the wounded Fan,
You cut off Limbs, and do the Skull Trepan;
Though the wracked Patient does with Torture groan,
They use the Caustic and the Vitriol-stone;
A Gentle here would be a Murdering Hand,
For Rhubarb is the Health of Reprimand;
Virtue never strictly has what it deserves,
And Honesty is praised, but yet it Starves;
Rapine and Luxury do bear the Sway,
And fierce Mankind on one another Prey;
Nay sometimes you Two Enemies pursue,
To thread the Labyrinth you want a Clue:
Like that unhappy Fish that is forced to fly,
From the wet Element into the dry;
From his keen Hunter does a Refuge get,
And there he hovers whilst his Wings are wet;
But then the Pirates of the Air with Claws,
Force him into his first Pursuer's Jaws;
So that betwixt them both he cannot forego,
Or his Domestic, or his Foreign Foe;
Men wheedle first, and then they do Destroy,
The World's a standing Pool, a great Decoy;
Where Fourberies on one another pass
As in a Country that is deep Morass;
A Race of Feathered Sicophants they breed,
The Politician lurks behind the Reed,
And tempts the Fowl along by throwing Seed:
For the Winged Travelers frequent this Lake,
Which they a Stygian by their Death do make,
That they of Food and Company may partake;
But Hunger thus makes them an easy Prey,
And the Associates do their Friends betray;
But first a rigid Silence you must keep,
It must as undisturbed be, and as deep
As when at midnight the tired World does sleep:
Then not to stir you must a Caution have,
As when Men mean to Cheat with Visage Grave;
And there in Ambuscade Perdue must lie,
These Creatures still hear quicker than they fly;
And now comes Sailing on the Caravan,
Which when so near that he may them Trapan,
Up starts the Shrewd, Inhospitable Man;
The Denisons of the Stream away do get,
Whilst the wild Captives flutter in the Net.
I Would be that happy man who spent his Age
Within the Circle of an Hermitage:
Not the least Curiosity did use;
Nor heard, nor made Enquiry after News;
Three Kings of France successively had Reigned,
And all the Realm with Civil Blood was stained;
He free and undisturbed did Live alone,
Knew not who left, or who did fill the Throne.

Dam. The Histories of Sicily do tell,
That once a Man did in the Ocean dwell;
Forsook the Hills and all the fruitful Dales,
And only did Converse with Fins and Scales;
Men Horned and Hoof'd have dwelt within the Woods,
But this was the first Satyr of the Floods;
His Life might properly be said to flow,
And a kind Dolphin was his Bedfellow;
Sometimes for Air he would come upon the Beech,
Within Men's Eyesight, though beyond their reach:
If them he first Espied, away he fled,
And Dived again into his Coral Bed;
For that they say is in the Water soft,
And hardened grows when it is brought aloft:
Within an hollow Rock he had a Room,
Which Amber-Grease did with its Scent Perfume;
That precious Earth does in those Bottomes grow,
Till furious Tempests do it upwards throw;
At last he in the Dark mis-took his way,
Or to his Fellow-Citizens was a Prey.

Alc. I would (my Damon) Live within these Fields,
Where Nature Genuine Satisfaction yields;
Here I Would Erect a solitary Cell,
Wild Beasts do only in the Cities dwell:
A Life abstracted here a Man enjoys,
Not mixed with Falsehood, nor debauched with Noise:
Here in offensive Company I Would keep,
With honest Cows, and undesigning Sheep:
Poverty pincheth, a great Fortune loads,
And nothing pleases You which Incommodes;
Great Empire did Proud Dioclesian tire,
Marcellus wept, and Scipio did retire;
Antiochus thanked the Senators of Rome,
That by their Consuls he was overcome:
Acknowledged all their Triumphs to be kind,
Their Victory his swelling Thoughts confined;
I would not be a Cully, nor would Cheat,
Nor flatter Ladies Lap-dogs to be Great:
I would not be distinguished by a Tribe,
Nor cringe to Courtiers, nor the Lawyer's Bribe;
A slender Diet for my Health I Would choose,
Physicians I Would admire, but seldom use:
This of my Life I would propose the End,
To read a Book, and to enjoy a Friend;
I would not be Morose, but sometimes Sad,
For this allays the Excess of being Glad;
Sanguine and Melancholy both should meet,
One equal makes the Blood, the other Sweet;
I Would welcome the approaches of my Fate,
With Thoughts not conscious, and a Mind sedate;
Jean d' Albret, Queen of Navarre, the Mother of Henry the IV of France.
Albret a mighty Genius did bring
Into the World, and in her Pangs did Sing;
'Twas a Presage of what he after won,
It was an Io Paean for her Son;
As quiet in my Bed of Death I Would lie,
And with the ease as she brought forth, would die;
Or like to Saxonies brave Tempered Duke,
Who scorned of Fortune the severe Rebuke;
The Fifth.
Charles, whose Ambition with the World did Jarr,
Did Beat him with the Rooking Dice of War:
And when he had this noble Person down,
His Smiles never altered for the others Frown;
A messenger of Death to him was sent,
Which was the last and fatal Complement:
The Tidings did not chill him, nor inflame,
Only desired that he might play out his Game;
For some few Minutes would the Axe delay,
Till he had finished Stratagems at play;
That wise removes as Pensive Chess might yield,
That Luck, which was denied him in the Field:
His Doom reversed this Resolution gains,
He triumphed over his Conqueror in Chains;
In such an easy, obvious Style I Would write,
Which Damon might, and Lycophron delight;
Unto this Talent very few attain,
At once to be both Elegant and Plain.
A Famous French Poet.
Malherbe did to his Fille de Suite rehearse
His Poems, made his Chambermaid Judge of Verse;
If that the Sense upon her Mind did dart,
He knew where lay the Touches of his Art:
Then Mathematics closely I Would pursue,
It is not only Plausible, but True;
My chiefest Labor should on this be spent,
The want of which I do too late Repent;
Instruction in a Vehicle of Delight,
Number and Time, and Space seem Infinite;
The Greek and Latin Tongues must always please,
The Orientals you may learn with ease;
They at first Entrance Difficult appear,
Are only frightful in the Character;
The Arabic requires Expensive toil,
But every thing is easy smoothed with Oil;
Objects of Terror I would still forsake,
Upon the Fancy they Impression make;
A Mother once by curious Eyes was led,
To see a Malefactor how he Bled;
Was made a Spectacle upon the Greve,
Did all things else, but could not Death deceive;
Tinctured all over with Blood of murdered Men,
And one Life suffered now for double Ten;
He lay in Agonies stretched upon the Wheel,
The Hangman with repeated Blows did reel:
His Strong-knit Bones he gradually did break,
The Villain roared, the tender Women squeak;
Then he is mounted almost out of sight,
His Carcass does the griping Vultures fright;
But he is a Prey unto the ravenous Skies,
And vomits out his Soul in Blasphemies:
Now they have reversed the Sentence of that Place,
And they dispatch him with a Coup de Grace;
This of her fancy took up all the Room,
And made a Signature upon her Womb;
She with fierce Pangs, short Sighs, and melting Groans,
Brought forth an Infant all with broken Bones.

Dam. These Speculations Charmingly amuse,
But's hard to bring a Theory to use;
Nay when it is tried you always cannot prevail,
The Project in the first Attempt may fail,
These Wounds we do in our Experience feel,
Like unto Learned Petties double Keel;
The Toy in the first Voyage did not hit,
The Waves broke in, and did the Vessel split;
Drebell a wonderful invention found,
He scorned all things 'bove Water or the Ground;
No cracked Projector ever was like him,
He taught a Ship as does a Fish to swim;
Some at him laughed, whilst keener Wits did rail,
He swore his Hulk should under Water Sail:
In vain the strange Experiment did try,
As well on Ganza's he to Heaven might fly.

Alc. These were the whimsies of Capricious Art,
Which Men forged out until their Brains did smart;
Thoughts too Exalted do our time devour,
Virtue is Easy, and within our Power;
I Would keep my mind in such an equal Poise,
As not to Grieve too much, nor to Rejoice:
Afflictions should not Conquer, though they tire,
I Would be that Cloth that is whitened with the fire;
And this the Ancients called their Asbeston,
And from the Amianthus now is spun;
Though Flame does all things into Ashes turn,
This never Consumes let it the fiercest Burn;
The Earth with Cultivation I Would manure,
And with Phlebotomy my Vines would cure:
But my chief Care should be my mind to Wed,
Least Rankness should the worm of Conscience breed;
All our Luxuriant Vices we should kill,
We may be Good and Happy if we will;
Since to desert all Avenues are barred,
Love Virtue (Damon) though without Reward;
I with the Trees I Planted would grow Old,
And when my Clay, like that I laid, proves Cold,
Then a Translation should to me be given,
I Would leave this Paradise and go to Heaven.

Dam. Ah! Give me Notice (Alcon) when you Dye,
That I may fit my Wings and with you fly;
All the Creation will insipid grow,
When I must Live with half a Soul below:
What can precarious Being recommend,
When Death divorceth me from such a Friend?
It does not only shake the drooping Fruit,
The Earth convulseth and tears up the Root:
Oh! let my Fibers with yours kindly twist.
That when Death strikes You, I can not be mist;
But I Conjure you by these melting Tears,
Live on, and rid me of these Pensive Fears.

Alc. The World's a Load, and is uneasy grown,
Yet for your sake I Would live, though not my own:
You raise a Tempest when I hear your Sighs,
My grief must pay a tribute to your Eyes;
It does my Love and my Obedience show,
As lesser Streams unto the Ocean flow:
All Passions as rude Guests we will remove,
We'll give Reception to naught else but Love.
Anger a whip for its own fury makes,
Envy is stung by its envenomed Snakes;
A magic Furnace does her Entrails boil,
Revenge o're-charg'd with Malice does recoil:
As when an Hawk does at an Heron fly,
Pursues him through a whole Campaign of Sky,
He upwards turns, and does his Hunter Kill,
Swooping he splits himself upon the Bill;
But now our different Paths we must pursue,
And to these lovely Plains must bid adieu;
And since we have the City now in view,
May all the Blessings of kind Heaven light there,
And may I happy be as I Am Sincere;
May not their Feuds on them provoke thy Curse;
Hail native Earth! of Industry the Nurse:
Just so the Hybla Citizens do Thrive,
The Slothful interferers they do drive
With their sharp Stings, out of the painful Hive,
Where they a Labyrinth of Honey build,
The Cells they with extracted Lackar Gild;
The work grows warm by the Joint Stock of all,
Beyond the L'oeuvre and Escurial;
It Is like a Conclave with its Stanza's full,
Where one amongst the Purple Herd they cull,
To be their Pope, who is exquisitely Dull:
With him they Lodge the fulminating Powder,
Who best can Court them in a Golden Shower:
Then puny Princes do that Thunder dread,
And he commands their Wealth with Seals of Lead;
Since in their Labor they resemble Bees,
Who from each Flower and Plant exact their Fees;
Let them so far the Parallel pursue,
As to be like them in their Sweetness too:
Let no malign Event their Traffic bilk,
Their Manners be as pleasant as their Milk:
As Codrus to prevent a dire mis-hap,
His Country saved, and leaped into the Gap;
Them to Redeem his Life he did not prize,
To stop their Breach I Would fall a Sacrifice.

FINIS.
