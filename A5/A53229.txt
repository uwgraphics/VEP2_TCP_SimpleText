The Final Conclusion Up-shutting of Mr. OGILBY's Standing LOTTERY Of BOOKS;

that took Cognition thereof, Especially the Adventurers.
THE Author therefore, that he may the better please his former Adventurers,
many of them being earnest once more to try their Fortunes, and also several
others that wanting notice Lapsed their time, and now stand ready with the
foremost to put in their money, resolves to make a clear Warehouse by a General
dispatch of those few Remainders, which to continue the work, He (when they
were Delatory) Drew for himself. And also those Supernumeraries Printed, to
satisfy the several Claims of the Many that might draw only Blanks, bringing
all down in the same manner to the like low Markets and Under-rated Vendition,
expecting thereby to set at Rights his vast charge of re-Printing;
extraordinary cost in expedition, and former deplorable Loss by the Fire: so
making himself a small pittance from a competent Gain: the Proposals are the
same with the former, only this Additional encouragement, That whereas the
Adventurers were so kind as to part with their money, and stay for their
Prizes, till Printed and prepared, Reposing so much trust and confidence in the
Authors Integrity; Now shall, at one and the same instant, know their Chance,
and Receive their Books.

The value of the Books as above, being sufficiently known to be the Prizes
they have been usually sold at, Amounts to 4111 l bu^ the Lots with their
proportion of Blanks, Amounts but to 1255 l. so that the Author receives for
his Books little more than one Fourth of the value, which with the possibility
of the Great Lots, or the probability of Seven Prizes in Nine Lots, as were
drawn in the last, and the Certainty of Receiving in Books much more than their
money, is Encouragement enough to the Adventurer. But this is sufficiently
understood by many.

Those that please to put in part of their money, Enter their Names and so be
Drawn in Course, may be pleased to come or send to the Author's (...) at the
Black boy, over against St. Dunstans Church in Fleet Street. The time will be
Certain, within Two Months from (...) Sixth of January, 1668.
