Warning or Lanthorn to London, by the doleful destruction Of fair Jerusalem,
whose misery and unspeakable Plague does most justly declare Gods heavy wrath
and judgment for the sins and wickedness of the people, except by Repentance
we call to God for Mercy.
To the tune of, B^^g^ndary.


WHen fair Jerusalem did stand,
whom God did love so dear,
Whom he did keep with his right hand,
as plainly did appear:
^or when the people went awry.
That plagues he sent them presently:
With O sorrow, pitiful sorrow,
Good Lord thy vengeance spare.
Although his Temple there did stand,
whose beauty did surpass:
^he only beauty of the Land
where Gods true honor was;
^et when the Lord did on them ^rown,
^he same was spoiled and thrown down.
with O sorrow, etc.
And for the peoples wickedness
which in the City dwelt
The Land was brought to great distress
and many plagues they ^^^t:
Their Enemies they did abound.
That they besieged the City round:
with O sorrow, etc.
The mighty Emperor then of Rome,
the Lord in fury sent,
To bring them all to deadly doom,
who would not once repent:
When half a year he there had line,
The people then began to pine:
with O sorrow, etc.
The vomit which one man did cast,
another man did eat,
Their very ^ung they laid not wast,
but made thereof their meat;
And through this famine long begun,
The Mother was glad to eat her Son:
with O sorrow, etc.
The gallant Ladies of that place,
whose pride did late excel,
Full lean and withered was her fare
their bones a man might tell:
And they that were so dainty fine.
Through hunger great to death did pine:
with O sorrow,
The dead men covered all the ground
of fair Jerusalem,
Such ^es^ilence did there abound,
and so infecte^ them,
That many a thousand there did dye
Which still unhurted there did lie:
with O sorrow, etc.
Yet would not they give over the Town,
for all this grievous case,
Until their Enemies pulled it down,
and all the Walls did race:
And all the Jews that lived then,
They took them prisoners every one:
with O sorrow, etc.
And those that were of Noble birth,
the Conqueror took away,
The rest the Emperor did make
his hardy Soldiers prey,
Who then for Slaves did sell them bound,
Even thirty for a penny round:
with O sorrow, etc.
For ^^o years space before the war,
within the sky so bright,
Most like a Sword a blasing Star
hung over the City right
And in the skies they might see plain
How men of war did fight amain
With O sorrow, etc.
Yet would they not their life's lament
in any kind of case,
Nor once within their hearts repent,
and call to God for grace,
Until his wrath on them did fall,
And that they were destroyed all:
with O sorrow, etc.
O noble London warning take
by fair Jerusalem,
And so the Lord thy prayers make,
lest thou be like to them,
For if he will not spare the Jews,
Think thou he will thy sins excuse?
with O sorrow, etc.
Thy sins as greatly do abound,
fair London then beware,
Lest God in wrath do thee confound,
with sorrow grief and care.
For many signs he thee has sent
That thou may yet thy life lament:
with O sorrow, etc.
Let not the wealthy of the Land
in riches put their trust
They cannot keep them from the hand
of him that is most just;
Their Gold will do them little good,
If he withold their daily food;
With O sorrow, etc.
The woman eke so fair a face,
and of such dainty taste.
Let them think on their grievous case,
whom Famine did so waste:
And not despise the poor to feed,
Lest they do cry when they have need:
with O sorrow, etc,
O Lord we pray for Christ his sake
our grievous plagues remove,
And on the Land some mercy sake,
for jesus Christ his love:
Preserve our King from casualty,
Whose loss would make us weep and cry,
with O sorrovv, pitiful sorrow,
good Lord thy vengeance spare.

Of the horrible and woeful destruction of Jerusalem and the signs and tokens
that were seen before it was destroyed, which d^struction was after Chr^s^
Ascension xlii, years.
To the tune of The Queens Almaine.
AN Emperor Ves^a^n
Sometime in Rome there was
Through whom much d^^^rs then began
of mortal wars alas,
Within two years that he did reign,
He put the Jews to mickle pain.
With fire and sword both took and slain,
his power so brought to pass:
His son Titus having no dread
His Army over Judah spread,
The people to the City fled,
hoping to have redress.
Before Titus Vespatians son
Unto these wars did go,
Was utter Ascension
long forty years and (...) O:
Even did the Romans with such pride,
Beset the Land both far and wide,
And being then on every side.
to their great pain and woe.
They brought the Jews in such a case,
The Prophecy to bring to pass,
Spoke by the Lord when he there was,
the Scripture so does say.
That prudent Jew Josephus says,
Who did not write in vain,
That he was present in those days,
and saw this mortal pain.
When that Titus both bold and stout,
Beset Jerusalem about,
That none might in or issue out
no way but to be stain:
For Titus his chief Captain was
The siege when he had brought to pass,
Great was the cry woe and alas,
the story both make plain.
He stopped their Pipes and Conduits all,
That no water might pass,
With famine they were in great ^^all,
most woeful was their case:
They were constrained to that need,
With horse and ass themselves to feed,
Both Dog and Cat thus do I read,
most ugly meat it was:
The hunger there it was so great,
Ones vomit was another meat,
There was no way for to entreat,
but present death alas.
Six months this siege it did hold on,
About the City great,
Wherein was many a Mothers son,
did starve for lack of meat.
The famous Ladies of that town,
That were before of high renown,
For want of food fell in a sown,
there was nothing to get:
The story thus both specify,
The Mothers most unnaturally,
They slew their children ruefully,
And roasted them to eat.
This Ti^u^ then of high renown,
Mo^^ valiantly (...) bold,
The wails so strong he did ca^^ down
resistance w^red ^old;
The people in the streets lay dead,
They ha^ no succor drink nor bread,
Much was the blood that then was shed,
alas lament (...):
The Rom^^^ (...) with such might,
With (...) s^ords so bright,
They slew all that come in their sight,
no mercy they did hold.
The Gates that covered were with gold,
They threw them to the ground,
That famous City to behold,
for sin it was confound:
Ele^en hundred thousand slain,
through hunger, sword and po^^^ent pain,
In this the story does not fain,
of many a bloody wound:
The stinck of Carkas in the street,
The feeble ^oules that could not ^leet,
For faint of hunger scarce could creep,
full heavy was their sound.
Then Titus gave his sentence blive,
Which Romans liked well,
As many as you find alive,
after this rate them sell:
As Christ was sold for thirty pence
By Judas and his false pretense,
So Titus makes them recompense,
the story thus does tell:
Thirty Jews for a penny bought,
As many more were sold for naught.
Their own confusion thus they wrought
because they did rebel.
And many Prisoners more I ween,
To Egypt they were sent,
Fourscore thousand and seventeen,
in prison had their end:
And Titus and his company,
Took many such as were worthy,
And led them bound all captively,
to Rome with him to wend:
There was no help for to revok,
As Josephus says in his Book,
His Chronsc^ who lists to look
of truth they do depend.
Thirty years God gave them space,
That they might yet repent,
Their lives amend and call for grace,
for them Christ did lament:
This loving Lord often did them call
By sundry signs as here you shall.
Before his wrath on them did fall,
or anger fully bent:
Twelve days eclipsed was the Moon,
That they might be converted soon,
But they wist not what to be done,
but sin did still augment.
Before the sign of any war,
The s^^^^ of all one year
Over the town was soon a war,
most blazing bright and clear:
So like a sword in ^ape it (...),
VVhereat great grief and wonder was,
Yet (...) they nor their wickedness,
when these signs of appear;
More over in the air so bright,
In place of May and Armor bright,
^^^re seen men ready for to ^^^ht,
to show their time was near,
A (...) day in April.
To hallow they were dight,
And suddenly among them fell
a mavelous strange sight:
So bright and clear with such a gleam,
Passing the Sun as it did seem,
But what it meant no man could deem,
but were all in sore fright:
But while the Priest did this endure,
To offer a ^^ise they did their cure,
Which Calfe a thing against nature,
brought forth a Lamb in sight.
Such many tokens contrary,
Which did Prognosticate,
And to the Jews did signify
their woeful fall and fate;
Before that Titus wars began,
Four years of space this prove ^ can,
How that the son of one rude man,
Ananias low of state:
He ran the streets in such a rage,
Being a Child of tender age,
To call and cry he did not swage,
repent ere it be too late.
But for his pains he was well bent,
This had he for his hire,
For truth they did him evil entreat,
and against him did conspire:
But yet he cried and would not l^^,
While he was able yet to run,
Saying, Woe to Jerusalem,
for kindling of Gods ire;
Woe be to thee and to thy Land,
Thou art beset in woeful band,
Thy day of sorrow is at hand,
of famine sword and fire.
Now seeing that this Jerusalem,
As Scripture does tell true,
Was plagued for the sins of men
which Romans overthrew
What shall the Lord to us express
That do live in such excess
Of whordom pride and covetousness,
more now then did the Jew?
There ore is our example this.
Amend the thing that is amiss,
That we may have eternal bliss,
by Christ our Lord Jesus.
