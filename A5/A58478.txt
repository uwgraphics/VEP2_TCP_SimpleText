The Scene, Germany.

Act. 1 Scen. 1.
Enter Hildebrand and Brazutus. Hill. MAss! thou have got a luckie hand Brazutus,
The Septicollis now of Rome is levelled,
My way made even to St. Peter's chair,
The Popedom mine!

Bra. God bless your Holiness!
Never had men quicker dispatch to Heaven,
(I Judge Sir) that those seven your predecessors,
Thanks to my luckey stars, and pills! (then which
There can be nothing more Infallible)
(Your Holiness excepted)

Hill. Here Is my hand.

Bra. Your Toe, good Sir, your Toe's too great a honor.

Hill. Murder as many as thou can, Brazutus,
(Husband it likewise to thy best advantage,
I know men's Deaths must be thy Livelihood)
You freely have my Dispensation for it.

Bra. All thanks, Sir,
My study shall be to deserve it.

Hill. Hark.
a shout within, They come, I must retire.

Enter Cardinal Victor, with a Mitre, other Cardinals, Monks Friars, with a
mixed company. Car. God save the Pope!

All. Peter the Apostle chooses Hildebrand!
Exeunt, manet Brazutus.
Enter to Brazutus, Jocoso. Jo. Master! the Kettle-drumms past by just now.

Bra. Peace fool, those were religious men, called Friars.

Joc. Men! shave they for the scabb? or were half poisoned?
Pox on the bungler! could his feeble dosse,
But fetch the hair off?

Bra. No Jests now, Jocoso.
Exit Jocoso. Hasten home, I am with you straight; but first
Will fetch my Patent, to prepare for travel:
I cannot think it safe, abiding here,
So near the Pope, should once his Magic prompt
Him to believe, some liberal bribes might tempt
Me to ridd him hence (by one slight or other)
(To make all sure) he would send me packing first.
For all his fair pretenses I confess,
I dare not too much trust his Holiness.

Act. 1. Scen. 2.
Enter Honorio, Prudentio, to them Junio: Ho. How can the Emperor take this
Prudentio:

Pru. Pride and Ambition ruins all the world.
Truth, Sir, I fear 'twill breed bad blood, if not
Timely made up; He Is a Prince wise and valiant,
And wont be balked thus of his ancient right.

Ho. Hildebrand reckons all the Roman Empire,
May I not say the the whole fourth Monarchy?
For Peter's Patrimony, falling now,
To him, whereof he will be sole, supreme;
Making the Scepter level to his Mitre.

Pru. Must none arrive to heaven without his leave,
Nor yet possess the earth in any quiet?
Would he be Metropolitan of both?
I must confess, to men in Sacred Orders,
We owe all love, awful respect and honor;
Yet there are two extremes do ill become
Their cloth Honorio, Pride and Poverty:
I Would neither have them swell, nor starve to death.

Ho. Here comes mad Junio.

Enter Junio. Pru. God save you, Sir!

Jun. Yours Prudentio, Honorio I am yours!

Ho. Junio, sweet Junio! prithee lad, what news?

Jun. Faith, that which makes me laugh, Sir, The new Pope
(Talking against Massing-Preists Wives already:)
Has wrought the prettiest different effect:
Some storm, and some are glad on it: The one swears
(Should he nere use bead more) he will never quit
His pretty Bet^y for an Ave Marie.
^h' other complains, Nets Lectures spoil his Sermons.

Pru. Mad Junio still.

Jun. Troth, I am serious, Sir.

Ho. Prithee speak

Jun. I am, and can tell you further,
The Archbishops Grace of Mentz, the other day,
Pressing this Order, from his Holiness,
Narrowly escaped his life.

Ho. What project's this?
I warrant you Prudentio, Some cunning
Citizen Miser (to preserve his purse)
(Fearing least his Impropriated Priest
Might Marry, and so leave a parish charge)
Has put it in his head.

Pru. With this persuasion.
Most Beneficed men dying Batchelours,
Would make him Heir, and so enrich his See.

Jun. I had almost forgot to tell you too:
Those who contrive the thriftiest way to live,
Think Wives, will be as cheap as Concubines.
Cardinal Cremensis the other day,
(Arguing fiercely 'ganst Priests-Matrimonie)
Was caught that night bedding a common strumpet.

Pru. I fear this design will but promote
Lusts more, and secret Murders to conceal 'um.
Restraint often creates those unruly passions,
Which Freedom, slights.

Jun. But Gentlemen! before
We part let us clash one pint of Wine together,
I Will give you that shall be most excellent.

Pru. All thanks kind Junio. Ho. We'll accept your proffer.

Jun. With all my heart; now I could hugg you dearly.
Let times go how they will, the Grape-juyce merits
My praises still, for that preserves my spirits.

Pru. Poetical!

Jun. Whether or no, you know it:
The very thoughts of Sack will make a Poet.

Ho. Ha. ha. ha.

Exeunt. Act. 1. Scen. 3.
Enter Emperor, Henry, Conrade, Attendants. to them Otho. Emp. It cannot be
born! Princes are things too holy
For Popes to ^oole: Has kind fate blessed me with
Such conquest over the Saxons, and will this
Religious Rebel, now spoil all at home?
To make a Pope without me, is all one
As to unmake me.

Henry. Sir, I thought that past
Off! The reach of mortals, dare they snarch that Crown off,
Which none, but a Divine hand settled on you?

Con. They had as good seek to unravel Heaven,
And fetch the Diety thence.

Emp. My Sons talk,
As if descended, from Imperial Loins;
But what wont human Impudence attempt,
Spurred with ambition?
Enter Otho. What means this haste?

Otho. Hildebrand's Nuntio, is arrived, Sir, And --

Emp. And what, Sends for my Scepter does he not?
May I nere more ask pardon of my sins!
If this steel does not make him cry me mercy.

Otho. And so he does, Sir, may it please your Highness!

Emp. He shall know that there was a Caesar long
Before St. Peter, or his Successor
Were ever thought on. Otho. May it please your Highness!

Emp. The Election of the Pope from Constantine
Descended to Me, Otho, Reckon that.

Otho. It Is now Seven Hundred years agon, and upwards.

Emp. Nor shall this ^ome-Usurper stand a day,
Can I but once reach Italy.

Otho. Please you --
Sir, Hear me, Hildebrand is sorry.

Emp. How?

Hen. For that he cannot, Sir, play Prester John.
Be Prince and Prelate too.

Emp, Grant he were so,
Could it be thought these twins of government,
Might ever wrangle in the self-same breast
For the Supremacy; It would be found,
(I lay my life on it) that St. Peter's Chair
Must owe it self upheld by Caesar's Throne.

Otho. Sir, --

Con. No Bull like the roaring Cannon, No
Anathama like a good Sword and Pistol.

Otho. I see I am still disturbed.

Emp. Go on, Otho.

Otho. For ought we hear, Sir, Hildibrand is sorry,
The lawless rout of common people should
Cry him up Pope: which Title he protests
He never will own, Sir, without your Election.

Hen. I hate this flattering.

Con. It takes too much.

aside. Otho. Till when he has refused Inauguration.

Emp. Now thou say somewhat.

Otho. For this very purpose,
Comes th'Embassie.

Emp. This is some satisfaction.
Receive 'um, we will give 'um some Audience.

Exit Otho. Hen. Were it not fit Hildebrand should have made
Most Royal, Sir, a Personal submission?

Con. Proxy humility seems but presumption.

Emp. I see Youth's rash and inconsiderate,
It was the giddie factious multitude,
Not he (my Boys) intruded on my right.

Hen. Con. Sir, we submit.

Emp. Haste then without delay,
To grace the Entertainment.

Both. We obey.

Exeunt. Act 1. Scen. 4.
Enter Rodolphus, Magnus, Frederick in Prison. Fred. And is the Emperors
promise come to this?
Is this his Liberty?

Mag. A Princes word
I took to be, as true as Heaven it self.

To. For this I Will n'ere believe a Conquest more,
But what shall meet me over ears in blood.

Mag. 'Twas not we feared death as to be thought
Foolishly lavish of our lives: to fight
For that liberty, we might have with peace.

To. Would we had dyed before we yielded.

Fred. Hark! They sing and dring within.

A Song.
Here Is to that Noble Soul;
Drowns his sins in a Bowl;
And cares not a fig for the Pope.
Here Is to him a full Glasss,
That counts him an Ass,
Who will stinch at the sight of the Rope.
All within. Ho Boys!

First. A merry life and a short.

2. About with it.

3. Where lies the fault?

1. Roger it is your liquor.

To. O plague, I drank the very last but one,
Ralph wants it.

They sing again. Fred. O Brave Roarers! They know no other prayers.
These are their Mattins, and their Evening Songs.

To. Is there such mirth in death?

Mag. Or are they rather
Glad that the friendly Halter shortly will
Free them from Goal, which I count worse then death.
What man that has that Noble thing called Soul
But hates confinement? This whole world would be
To narrow for him, were he always tied to'r.

Fred. But these poor souls are hardened in their Irons.

To. I was in hopes that breach like to have bin
Betwixt the Emperor and the Pope of late,
Would have made our way out

Fred. But that is all dash't.

To. Could not our old friend ( Otho having got
Into such favor) do us here a kindness?

Mag. We are but here kept like West-Indian captives,
To be devoured at some solemn meeting,
With Mirth and Jollitie; endure't who list
Let our wits work our freedom

To. Fred. We Will all assist.

Act. 1. Scen. 5.
Exeunt. Enter Aurelia, Silvia, to them Sophrona, Matilda, Attendants. Au. May
not one guess affection by a glance?

Syl. Madam!

Au. 'Twas but one look, and that look did it.
Those lights like Archimedes burning-glasse
Set me on Fire at that distance from him.

Syl. Your meaning, Madam.

Aur. Sylvia, thou art dull,
I see, for had thou any sense at all,
How could thou choose but feel the self-same heat?

Syl. Explain your self, pray Madam.

Aur. Then I will.
I Am conquered by my Fathers Captive.

Syl. Which?

Aur. Now I could chide thee for a silly Gitle:
Do ask me which?

Syl. Otho's fair, Frederick smiling.

Aur. I see my error. Love is such a madness;
What we love, we'd have all love; and yet cannot
Endure a Rival: Did not mind him Sylvia
With the Majestic countenance? My love
Is not Effeminate, although a Woman's.

Syl. Bold Magnus!

Aur. Magnus!

Syl. In your cheeks I read it,
That blush betraies you; He is --

Aur. Hush the Empress.

Enter Empress, Matilda, Attendants. Soph. Aurelia! Why were you wanting at
The sport but now?

Aur. Madam I was just coming.

Mat. 'Twas excellent, I love to see men active.

Soph. They Are gone to visit now the Saxon Captives,
Nothing that is tending to your Fathers glory,
Must be concealed from these noble strangers.

Aur. Must Magnus make them sport?

Syl. Pray Madam!

weeps aside. Soph. What says Aurelia? What Is that Sylvia?

Syl. She Is sorry, Madam, she should loose the sport.

Soph. I thought 'twould trouble her, there is more behind,

Mat. But Madam, shall we never visit Rome?

Sop. We may perchance, Matilda, danger it
Now there is made this happy reconcilement.

Mat. I long to see his Holiness, methinks
I fancy most those by Religion tied
From lust and wedlock; am (you must concieve)
A chaste Platonic Lover.

Aur. What is that?
To Love, to love, and not to enjoy?

Mat. Fruition
Does but allay those hightned flames, which are
The very life of love.

Aur. I am but raw,
(Yet give me leave) you seem, as if Matilda
You owned no Paradise to scorching Aetna.
Platonic loves, (like Purgatorian sires)
Do but prepare us for a perfect bliss,
And make us worthy of a free possession.

Soph. Aurelia, have a care my Girl, I fear
By your Romantic tongue, you may be smitten.

Aur. If my discourse offend (my Royal Mother)
May I be ever silent rather then
Provoke your hand.

Mat. You do mistake the Empress.

Soph. No matter, keep her still in Ignorance.

Mat. Ours is but talk, Madam, you will pardon it.

Soph. It is Ingenious, I gladly could
Hear more on it: but I dare believe by this
They are returned. It Is high time to be gone,
We must be all there: This night puts anen'd
To the Solemnity.

All. We shall attend.

Finis Act. Primi. Act. II. Scen. I.
Enter Pope, Card. Victor, other Cardinals, Attendants. The Pope ascends his
Chair. Vict. God save Pope Gregory the Seventh! All. Long live!

1. Card. Caesar confirms it!

Pope. Who Is that mentions Caesar?
For Policy I did complie a while,
It was but to procure the surer ground,
To give the Emperor the stronger blow.
Must Peter stoop to Caesar?

2 Card. That rests fully,
Sir, in your Holiness to remedy.

Po. My Keys already look and unlock Heaven,
And if they wont fit, I will add a ward
Wherewith they shall serve Earthly Kingdoms,
To make and unmake Princes at my pleasure.

Vict. Nobly Resolved, Sir, This will grace your See,
With the more awe and splendor.

2. Car. And restore
Rome to itsformer fame, that it shall be
Once more the worlds renowned Metropolis.

1. Card. Henry's accused --

Pope. I may as well ask him
Forgiveness of my sins, as to be Pope.

1. Card. He needs pardon, Sir, or punishment,
Who is so loudly taxed for a truce-breaker.

2. Card. The Saxons gladly would help to depose him.

1. Card. A Tyrant.

Vict. Cruel, Symoniacal,
A buisie Bodger of Church Livings, Sir.

Pope. I hear enough: makes him incapable,
starts up. Both of Heavens mercy, and of man's protection.
Let him be Excommunicated! less
Cannot be done to him, does so transgress.

Act. 2. Scen. 2.
Enter Brazutus to him Jocoso. Bra. All things succeed as well as heart could
wish.

Enter Jocoso telling Money, Joc. So, this is somewhat toward my Journey now.

Bra. What have thou there Jocoso?

Joc. Nothing Sir,
But a piece for killing an good old woman,
That did so lave the house still with her nose
As she swept it.

Bra. Did it accurately.

Joc. To a hair, Sir, no Juggler ever played
Legerdemaine neater, then I shook that same
Into her Hallow tooth.

Bra. And is she dead?

Joc. Dead, and at heaven I hope. Her son was mad
For haste to bury her the Rushian fashion,
With Hose and Shoes, she was so troublesome
To the chymney-corner (he said) and lived
So unmercifully, to keep that little
She had from him.

Bra. 'Twas he then gave the piece.

Joc. It was, and to say truth, I well deserved it.
It did so plague me Sir, to hatch a cry,
And pray an hours nonsense by the clock.
I must not touch her, if I touched abook.

Bra. I warrant 'twas one of those good women
That used to fetch an ill contrived sigh
At Church, in the wrong place; (not hearing well)

Joc. She was, all said, hugely well given Sir,

Bra. And so art thou, nay if thou can Jocoso
Fanatick-like, murder with prayers and tears,
N'ere fear a livelihood Joc. and when thy ^orks done,
My Fee will make me a Thanksgiving day.

Bra. All such odd jobs I give thee.

Joc. I thank you Sir.

Bra. Come hasten, fetch our things, we must be gone.

Bra. Now the Popes License without peradventure
Will be excepted from the Emperor
Exit Joc. To gain me leave, (since they are both agreed)
To practice near his Court: My man may play
At lower stakes, and kill men for a trisle:
But where I venture Soul, Life and Estate,
It shall, believe me, cost a saucie rate.

Exit. Act 2. Scen. 3.
Enter Prudentio, Honorio, Junio. Jun. What! we are likely to be all to pieces
Again, Honorio, with the Emperor.

Ho. So the news goes, and the Popes Arrogance
Has raised a civil war amongst the Clergy.

Jun. I am resolved I Will be of no religion
Till all agree.

Pru. I must confess these failings
Show they are but men, but what they would have us learn,
Is of an higher and diviner nature,
In that themselves so hardly practice it.

Ho. I cannot blame the German Bishops
To stand for their custom and prerogative.
Is there no Patriarchal seat but Rome?

Jun. I Am apt to think they shortly will determine
No Baptized Infant, shall be called a Christian
Except his Name be Peter.

Ho. Can there be
Nothing decreed without the Pope Prudentio?
Ought he, and only he, command a Council,
How, where, and when, he please?

Pru. This is in Truth,
Novel Encroachment, and he is like to smart for it,
Should the Prelates now join with the Emperor.

Jun. Would they were at it once.

Ho. Will you engage?

Jun. There Is nothing better, Boy, then Wars or Women,
To tame this Fact, and I abhor a Mistress.

Ho. The better Warrior.

Jun. Those desperate Dam-hims
Who for a while may force the fare of Valor.
To stand a prick or two in vindicating
Their Ladies naughty title to her Honor,
(To gain some Commendation, or a kindness)
Can never serve their Country worth a rush.

Pru. Why now I like you: Gentlemen, your Hands,
You Will side with me.

Both. May we else never speed:

Exeunt. Pru. Resolve then for the Emperor.

Both. Agreed.

Act. 2. Scen. 4.
Enter Magnus to him Otho, Frederick. Mag. Can her soft nature sport with the
afflicted?
I Will never think it, this were to blaspheme
Thy love Aurelia! She comes. --

Enter Aurelia, Sylvia Aur. I Will try him, Sylvia.

Syl. It Is prudence!

aside. Magnus! I bring enlargemen and delight to be
The early messenger of welcome news.

Mag. All thanks kind Princess: Madam you are noble:
Your Presence is a freedom.

Aur. Yours a Prison.

Mag. I see I was but mocked; What Scenes are these?
Such Calmes and Tempests in the self-same breath
Am I offensive?

Syl. You have moved him Madam.

aside. Aur. Yes, and Love-Sympathy now makes me suffer
A double torture, Magnus! Imust --

Draws and gives her his Sword. aside to Silvia, gives him his Sword. Mag.
Here is a Weapon, if you must dispatch me.

Aur. He still misaprenends me Sylvia,
And how undauntedly he talks of death!
Dear Magnus! sheath, the Prison that I talked of
Was nothing else but loves ensnarement.

Mag. Now,
You surfeit me with joy, tell't by peice-meales.

Aur. My Fathers purpose is to set you free.

Magnus I owe it you.

Syl. Heaven bless these meeting flames.

Aur. Some German Princes lately proving Rebels,
Join with the Saxons now again in Arms.

Syl. You Noble Magnus must be one of us.

Aur. Swear Loyalty t'assist the Emperor.
Thy Valor's know.

Mag. If I must take this oath,
I Will go and bid the Saxons, fight and help 'um;
And then return and willingly submit
To that just death my perjury deserves.
I Will prove as false to you, as to my Country.

Exit. Syl. Sir you are unhandsome to your Princess.

Aur. Peace.

Sylvia, what was it he said? He Would prove as falls
To me as to his Country, was it not so?
This is no slighting but does argue rather
That strong and holy zeal he has for both.
I like him better for this Resolution,
His Constancy to me and that together
Must sind a way He may be falls to neither.

Exeunt. Act. 2. Scen. 5.
Enter Emperor, Sophrona, Matilda, Henry, Conrade, Otho. Attendants. Emp.
Were It not for these Apostatizing Germans
The Pope should feel by sad Experience,
No curse so heavy, as a Princes anger.

Otho. These Rebels must be looked to timely Sir,

Emp. I first must make my peace with Rome; or else
His Holiness will have in every Corner,
Blind zealots, that will strive by murdering me
To merit Heaven:

Soph. Can man be thought so stupid?

Mat. O Madam! Ignorance leads to all mischief.
This makes some bid good marrow to a Snaile,
Or Serpent, and Adore 'um for that day;
The Vulgar learn Rebellion still without book,
Which the Pope shuts and bids 'um read their Lessons
In his commands, which needs must be (he says)
Always Infallible.

Emp. I see Matilda,
Thou art Ingenious, and talkst handsomely.
(together with the Empress) I have thought on
Employment for you.

Sop. May we serve you Sir.

Mat. Thus (...) I beg this Houour.

Emp. Rise, it is granted.
Have courage think, to face his Holiness?

Sop. You Are like now to enjoy thy wish Matilda.

Emp. You see, my Boys, Princes are sometimes made
The Tennis-balls of Fortune, to be bandy'd
At her unconstant pleasure; now full fraught
With good success, soon after wrackt with crosses.

Hen. Sir! we are rash and inconsiderate.

Con. He first usurped the Mitre, then asked leave.

Emp. My Children blame me Otho, that I did not
Tread upon Hildebrands submissive neck.

Otho. You were more Noble, Sir, and Mercyful,
Who could have thought on such Hypocrisy?

Emp. We must not now spend all our time in talk,
Aurelia is to tender for this Journey.
Henry, and Conrade, you are iuclin'd to travel.

Hen. We must Sir, if it be your Royal pleasure.

Emp. Sophrona, you, and you, Matilda shall
Receive your charge anon.

Both. With diligence.

Emp. Otho, to you we shall commend the care
Of our affairs at Home.

Otho. I shall be faithful.

Emp. The Sun sometimes is darkened with Ecclipses;
And the most fixed Stats do seem to twinkle;
So must my splendor for a while be clouded:
And I! The Pilgrim-Prince, now plainly show,
Monarchs, like Tides, do Ebb, as well as Flow.

Finis Act. Secundi. Act. 3. Scen. 1,
Enter Aurelia, Sylvia, to them Otho, Magnus, Frederick, Rodolphus. Aur. The
powers above must needs approve our love.
Their secret wisdom does so prosper it.
How Melancholy would the Court be now?
Were it nor for, you know my meaning Sylvia.

Syl. Madam, for some divertisement, let us go
To see the Mask acted to day.

Aur. Agreed.
And let us go disguised without Attendants.

Enter Otho, Magnus, Erederick, Rodolphus. Otho. Aurelia you are Queen we will
only act
At your command, now in your Fathers absence.

Aur. You Are Generous. Then my first endeavour's for
Some worthy Honor on your Country men.
(For your sake Otho) what shall Magnus be?

Mag. Thanks to our Noble Viceroy, I enjoy,
A Happiness ample enough in my
Freedom from Prison, and that Oath I hated.
But cheisly, Madam, in your government.

Otho. This is handsome, I fear I come to late.

aside Rod. What shall be Magnus? Nothing for Rodolphus.

Fred. Nor Frederick.

aside Rod. We Will make our selves, when once
We come in the field, good Otho, give us quickly
Some Martial Office or our Swords will rust.

Otho. We Will meet to night (if it may please the Princess!)
In Council, where we all may know our charge.

Aur. You may Command it Sir.

All. We shall attend.

Syl. Madam you are forgetful.

ex. Fred. Mag. Rod. Aur. Now we will go.
Most Noble Viceroy I must crave your leave
This afternoon to take some private repast.

Otho. Madam, you degrade your self to ask it.

Au. I in my Fathers absence owe you duty.

Otho. Might I entreat your Love it were an Honor.

Aur. You cannot choose but have it in obedience.

Otho. Adeiu sweet Princess.

Both. Yours

Otho. Farewell Sylvia.
Excunt Aur. I am resolved Harrie shall never come here,
Nor his two Sons; yet we usurpers love
To guild our Titles with some show of ^ight.
There is but one let and I Will straight remove it.
Aurelia could I once make thee my own,
I were for ever stablish'd in my Throne.

Act, 3. Scen. 2.
Enter Brazutus and Jocoso, there appears an Apothecharies shop. Bra. Dull
times Jocoso.

Joc. They can never hold.

Bra. Why Prithee.

Joc. I Faith if they do Master,
I must like the Peruvian Cannibals,
Feast it with man's flesh, and it must be mine own.
Cur Collops here, Sir, and be merry with 'um
They Will ast as long as I, and there is an end.

Bra. Thou talkst too frolic, to be starved Jocoso.
I am already got into their fashion,
Who make their meals either with Mear, or Drink,
Not both together, our trade will not maintain it.

Bra. My takings are but small, the wars spoil all.

Joc. Pox on it, Men are grown both hard, and holy;
I would now murder, half as cheap again
As I did formerly, to gain some custom.

Bra. My takings too lie all in Preservations,
Were it not for the French --

Joc. I have observed
That is the prettiest strange distemper Master,
It like a cunning Gamester has its salf pass,
Makes at the lower parts, and hits the Nose.

Bra. And then there is fine work that will pay us well.
TO erect a new bridge, or uphold the old one.
Here comes a Customer.

Enter Otho. Joc. What want you Sir?

Otho. Dwells here Brazutus?

Joc. There Is my Master Sir.

Otho. A word or two in private.

They whisper. Bra. I shall Sir.

Joc. O pox! I warrant he is peppered by's stradling.

Enter Aurelia, Sylvia, Disguised. Aur. Are we not somewhat of the latest
Sylvia?

Syl. Madam, they say it don't begin till four.

Aur. Let us make haste.

Joc. What want you Ladies, pray?
They pass by Here dweleth that Renowned Don Brazutus,
That most famous Italian Physician.

Aur. Heaven bless me, is not Otho yonder whispering?

Syl. The very same, what makes he here so private?

Aur. I strange! pass on, he cannot know us Sylvia.

Ex. Aur. and Sylvia. Joc. Those two past by, were pretty Girls I swear
If those Faces I saw were all their own.
But if they were, they are not for our purpose:
We cannot live, but by good Gentlewomen,
That undress Nature, as they dress to bed.
At night throw off their Perewigs, and their Noses.
Pull out their Teeth, and lay aside their Eyes.

Bra. I warrant Sir.

Jocoso orders his things in his shop. Otho. There is on other way
But this to gain Aurelia, and prepare
A free and valid passage to my suit.
Her carriage I confess seems plausible,
aside Yet it is nothing but Dissimulation.
Did not I see which way her amorous eye went,
And how 'twas only fixed on him? Brazutus,
Be quick and private.

Bra. As your own breast Sir.
I am beholding to my good old Master.
Ex. Otho. The Pope has taught me here a blessed Lesson.
Now Mental Reservation, saves my neck,
And no way hurts my Purse, I Will out with all:
Should she love Magnus, as I am persuaded,
Aurelia's pay will excel that of Otho's.
Jocoso, Let Us go in I Will give thee, Boy,
One point of Wine, to cheer thee, these sad times.

Joc. My Master has a piece, I warrant you
Ex. Brazutus. He is so free, this looked like a good chapman,
A curse upon this Primogeniture!
But a few minutes create all this trouble;
My Elder Brother carries all the Land,
And I may feed on Gallipots, and glasses.
Before I Will starve thus like a silly Elfe,
I am a Knave, if I don't Hang my self

Exit. Act. 3. Scen. 3.
Enter Honorio, Prudentio, Junio. Jun. The Emperor's arrived.

Ho. Fully Incensed I guess
Against the Pope.

Jun. We Will tame this mad usurper.

Pru. I wish, Honorio, this Religious Rebel,
Were well chastis'd.

Jun. If his Revenge be dull,
We Will whet his sword, Sir, with our active spirits.

Pru. First, we must understand the Princes mind,
Before we be to forward, Junio.
Only we will give him leave to pick our meaning,
And our designs, out of our costly banquets,
And bounteous Entertainments.

Ho. He shall read
These civil discords in the neat-wrought Sweet meats.

Jun. I am not for these woman's toys, but if
The Wine be good, I Will carouse wholeones to Him,
And Fancy the Pope merrily tumbling down.

Ho. Ha, ha, ha.

Pru. This is a sharp and bitter season for 'um.

Ho. I hear the Empress comes, and her two Sons
With a most Noble Train of handsome Ladies.

Jun. They do not come, I hope, to fight with these.
If any thing does make me run away,
'Twill be a woman's shreicks.

Ho. Ill, and harsh sounds
But you cannot hear 'um, for the Drums and Trumpets.

Pru. They will secure these in the Littadel.

Ho. Poor souls! It cannot but be hard servise to 'um.
They never saw such weather in their Chambers,
Which they do always keep this winter quarters.
They know no Snow, but what their Wash-ball makes,
Nor Ice, but curious artificial Jellies:
Bold Boreas will disturb this Lock, that Curle,
So put them to it.

Jun. Shame on their tenderness!
If I marry it shall de some Amazon,
Can fight with one hand, and give suck with the other.

Pru. For all your merry talking, Gentlemen,
Let Us not be tardy to salute the Prince.

Ho. True, they deserve our early loves. No age,
Can Parrallel, this Royal Pilgrimage.

In our cold progress; nor grudge we this penance,

But now such dangers cease:
Those Mortal Gods,
That were at odds,
Conclude an happy Peace.

Sad darkness near,
When Heaven's Two great Lights fight:
Whilst Prince and Pope
Clash; there is no hope,
But the worlds fatal night.

When Crown and Mitre do agree.

With Pardons in their Pockets, and hopes of

With a fair promise to be Canonized.

Hen. How now Brazutus?

Braz. Sir, this is but malice.

Mag. If clear in this yet they may both be faulty.

Hen. Declare Brazutus what you're committed,
And on a Princes word, you shall have mercy.
(For your sake Magnus and Aurelia's.)

Braz. If I am guilty, Sir, of this I Am taxed of,
May I for ever be debarred your bounty.

Hen. Speak all you know, or ever did, Jocoso.
If you are found in a tittle falls, you dye.

Joc. I never murdered any but my Mother,
Which Nature had almost done to my Hand.
Besides it was my Elder Brothers doings.
She lived so long He thought she was Immortal.
His mind was once, to try whether she would drown:
But I was forced at last to do her work
For a mean Fee; I might have starved else, Sir.
Your mercy, Sir, your mercy!

Hen. Horrid Villain!

Mag. But that your word joined with the Jubilee
Of your first Reign, pleads somewhat, Sir, for life,
There could be no escaping of the Gallows:
However pray think on some punishment
That may be next to it.

Hen. Friends, hear your sentence.
Brazutus! You Equivocated with us,
More then Jocoso in your sly confession.
(Who poisoned a Septinary of Popes!
Both shall live in perpetual Prisonment:
look to them Officers, and see that daily
A hard allowance, mind them of their faults.

Off. Sir We obey.

1. It Is well ye escape so

2. Off. Come my Friend, Jocoso.

Exeunt Officers with Bra. and Jocoso. Joc. Pox on your Friendship, would we
n'ere had met!
How Intimate I must be now with Hell!

Braz. The best on it is, old age, ill-us'd
Cannot suffer me, to be Tenant to a Prison long!

Hen. Magnus! whatever the German Empire now
Rightly descended to me, will afford,
Command it freely.

Mag. May Heaven prosper Caesar!

The Embrace. Enter Aurelia, Sylvia. Aur. Look yonder Sylvia.

Syl. I like this well.

Aur. Must Magnus now be Banished?

Hen. Sweet Aurelia!
I can as soon be banished from my self.
(Give me leave Sister) You will have a man,
Made up of Love, of Justice, and of Honor.
I might have called these Virtues into question,
Had he yielded to me in hindering
My Fathers Return, to his Empire: which
None but the Fates prevented.

All. Heaven Bless Caesar!

Mag. Next we must Palliate Sophrona's grief.

Hen. That must be Magnus in your Nuptials.
Great Duke of Saxony! accept your Duchess,
Accept of your Aurelia!

Aur. I fly to Him.

Syl. Blessed pair, may yours no more prove April-joyes!

Mag. We prize things most got through a world of Crosses.

Hen. When those are quite blown over: and now may
You (like the City Alexandria)
Enjoy a constant Sunshine every day!

Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.
EPIGOLUE.
I am to tell you (Gentlemen!) The Play
Caesar 's sad Tragoedie, you saw to day.
Should any Momus cry, it cannot be true.
A man Religious, and a Rebel, too.
Carp at the Title first, and next the Plot,
And then the Sense, the Language, and what not!
Condemn this Poison, this Lust, and that Treason,
And swear, our Pilgrim-Prince cannot stand to reason;
(But as a Vulgar Error straight must be
Damned with the Belisarian Poverty.)
Our Poet does confess, and it is His glory,
He played the Theif, he says, and stole the story
From men of Trust, who write, the thing was so,
Acted about Six Hundred years ago.
But yet all this will not do He understands,
Nothing will pass for good, without your Hands.
For which great favor, (she who did express
Her self so handsome to his Holiness.)
-- Witty Matilda pleads; and it is hard hap,
If such a freindly Girl don't get a clap.
