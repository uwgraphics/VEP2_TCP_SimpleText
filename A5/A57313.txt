TO THE Whole Flock of GOD EVERY WHERE, The Church of the Firstborn written in
Heaven, and, to every Member thereof, whose God is the Lord, and whose Redeemer
is the Holy One of Israel; Grace Mercy, Peace, Truth and Love from the God of
Peace and Love be multiplied amongst you, and to you all, AMEN.
YOu are as a City that is set on an Hill, that cannot be hid, you chosen ones
of the Lord God, who has followed the Lamb in the regeneration, You has God
brought through many and great tribulations, and has washed your garments in
the blood of his Son, you has he compassed about as with a Munition of Rocks,
and has redeemed you, and made you a purchased possession unto himself; You
has he clothed with strength and beauty, and has made you as bold as Lions,
he has gathered you by his Arm, and has upheld you by his mighty power, and
often has he spread your Table in the sight of your enemies; he has tried you
as Gold is tried in the Furance, and he has purified you by his Spirit of
Judgment, and burning, that he might take away your dross, and purge away
your Tin; he has suffered the wicked to plow long and deep surrows upon your
backs, that he might try your faith and patience; And in all this you have not
fainted, for your Bread has been sure, and your refreshment has not failed;
He brought you out of Egypt by a high hand, and through the Sea by his mighty
Power; His wonders you have seen in the deep, and his mavelous acts among the
Sons of men; He has given you the necks of your Enemies to tread upon, Yea, he
has not withheld any good thing from you, whose ways has been directed
according to his Truth; Many has been the hard-ships and difficulties which he
has led you through, and great has been the deliverances which he has wrought
for you, many strong Oaks have bowed before you, because the Lord was ith you,
and the shout of a King was amongst you; You have been smitten, but not
destroyed, you have been cast down, but not forsaken, the Lord has been with
you in all things, and has not failed you, who have put your trust in him; Oh!
let the high praises o^ the Lord be in your mouths, as a two edged sword in
your hands, for strong is the Lord who pleads your cause, at his rebuke the
Mountains of the Earth tremble, and the little Hills are moved; O^! continue
you steadfast in his power, and keep ye the Word of his patience unto the end,
that you may be crowned with everlasting Dominion, over all your Enemies for
ever.

And now, Oh my dear brethren and sisters, who are called chosen and faithful,
a peculiar people unto God, and zealous of good works, whom God has known
above all the families of the Earth; Dear is my love unto you, beyond what at
present I can express, through the strength of which I cannot but express, and
declare openly, what the Lord in secret has showed me; I have seen the Camp of
the Lord in ENGLAND compassed about with many Enemies of several sorts, the
B^lwarks is laid round about, and a snare at every Corner is prepared, and laid
by the enemies of ZIONS converts, the Enemy as a roaring I you, is now going
about seeking whom be may devour, for in great wrath he is with the woman who
i^ clothed with the Sun, and with the remant of her seed, who keep the
Testimony of Jesus, and the Word of God; Many has he stirred up to betray the
Innocent, who lies lurking in holes and corners, to catch their prey; Great
mischief there is intended against the Lords chosen, now must the Beast exalt
his horn as hi^h as the Host of Heaven, for the purging of the Sanctuary of the
Lord; And now shall baits of diverse colors be laid whereby to snare them whom
God has made free, and now will the Enemy of God muster up all his forces,
that will bear a weapon for him, in hopes to overcome them that keep the
Testimony o^ Jesus, and the Word of God, but they shall turn against them one
way, and fly before them seven ways, for a total overthrow has God decreed
to come upon all who exalt themselves against him and his children, but first
must their iniquiries come to a full growth, which is nigh at hand; Therefore
my beloved, put on strength as a Garment, and courage as a B^est-plate, and
live out of mortal terror, and beware unto whom you let forth your selve; for
perilous times are come, wherein brother shall betray brother to death, and
the murderer shall walk in the twilight, who seeks for the precious life; Many
false spirits are now abroad in the World, the reign of Antichrist draws near
an end; And blessid are they who now watches and keeps their Garments clean,
for now must the beast be taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought
miracles before him, and be cast together into the Lake of fire, for it is
their portion from the Lord; The great whore must now be plagued, who has long
sitten as a Queen, and seen no sorrow, she now must be cast into a bed of
endless torments, then shall JUDAH be saved, and ISRAEL shall dwell safely,
for the Lord i^ in the midst of them, who feeds them of the finest of the
Wheat, and with honey out of the Rock; So all dear hearts, who are of the Camp
of the Lord, go not forth least you be taken in the snares of the wicked, which
they have prepared for you.

Let neither their frowns nor f^atteries overcome you, both of which you will
be much assaulted with, and when the Enemy cannot overcome you one way, he will
try another, for many will speak fair to your faces, which has murder in their
hearts toward you; and because iniquity does abound, the love of many shall
decay, and turn into hatred, and then blessed are you who are not offended, but
patiently waits for the salvation of God, which assaredly he will accomplish in
his appointed time.

And though the Seas rage and swell, and lift up themselves against the banks,
yet he that did decree that it should not pass its bounds, is the same to day
to them who trust in him, and not a hair of your head shall fall to the ground
without him; So be bold and valiant for Truth upon the Earth, that God in all
things may be glorified, for he is now getting himself a Name in the Earth, and
rearing up a Government that shall stand for ever, against which the gates of
Hell shall not prevail; And though the Mountains be cast into the midst of the
Sea, yet his decree shall stand sure and firm, for his word is an everlasting
Covenant, which who does believe shall never be moved.

Now therefore all you chosen ones of the Lord God, who are the Lords Host, be
ye all wise as Serpents, and put on strength and courage, for the Lord is with
us of a truth; and walk all circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, for
Wisdom is better then strength; In the Eternal Light of the Son of God, have I
seen spies sent from far to behold your strength, and plottings among many how
to invade you, and enter into your fenced City, that has Salvation for its
Wall; great courage has the enemy taken to invade you, because they see not
your strength; but I have seen them as driven stubble before you, and as the
wind scatters the chaff, so the breath of the Lord scatters them, never
more to come together; But first, must you suffer many things by this
Generation, whom God has raised up for that end, that your utmost strength may
be tried, the trial of which will be much more precious then Gold, to all them
who are found faithful in that day which now approaches near, where in the
whole strength of Antichrist shall appear, and his last engagement very great
and subtle, such as was not yet known; But the day is the Lords, and the
conquest is by him alone, for his is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for
evermore; Then shall Judgment be given to the Saints, and the Ancient of days
shall sit upon the wicked, and they shall eat the fruit of their doings; but
the Lord shall be unto his Saints and Servants, an everlasting Light, and the
days of their mourning shall come to an end.

So all dear Brethren and Sisters, be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of
his Might, and put on the whole Armor of God, and give no place to the enemy
in the particular nor in the general, let not the Multitude of Pharaohs host
make you afraid, nor the strength of Antichrist cause you to fly, for though
they turn against you one way they shall fly before you seven ways, and though
they flourish as a green Bay tree Winter and Summer, yet in a moment shall they
be consumed from the Earth, and their glory be turned into everlasting
contempt, the mouth of the Lord of Hosts has spoken it.

And all dear hearts who are convinced of the Eternal truth, and are not yet
come to feel deliverance from the bondage of Corruption, but sees your enemies
many within and without, and are as it were between hope and fear, trust you
perfectly in the Name of the Lord by which you are called, that you may see him
your Wall in the time of storm; for many will the assaults of the enemy be, to
draw you back again into Egypt, and many dangers will he set before you, that
he may overthrow your faith and patience, and he will seek by all means to
veil that which should let you see the Lords strength; and then will he bring
in weakness and fears upon you, and cause you to stumble and stagger at the
promises which are yea and Amen to the seed of God in you; for he will sift you
as wheat, and fan you in the wind of his wrath; but the Lord will be with you
in all these things, who will not suffer your feet to be moved, but will be a
present help to all you who trusts perfectly in his Name, by which you are
called.

And though he may suffer the wicked to triumph for a time, and to incompass
his heritage as a flood, yet their root shall soon become rotten, and their
blossom shall fly up as the dust, for Gods controversy is nigh to be Sealed
against them (never more to be revoked,) who have hardened their hearts and
stifned their necks against his Government, and they that will not that he
should now rule over them, must now be slain by the word of his mouth.

Therefore dearly beloved, be not soon moved from the hope of the Gospel in
Christ Jesus, but remain steadfast in him, that your strength by him may be
renewed, and be kindly affectionated one to another and bear one another
burdens, that so you may be strengthened one in another, and be refreshed one
by another, that so the Eternal Name of God by which you are called may be
Adorned by you and in you; for God has not called you to wrath, but to obtain
Salvation through his Son Jesus Christ, who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
to whom be Glory an^ Immortality for ever and ever, Amen.

Again, all you plants of the Lord God who are Rooted in the Truth, wait upon
the Lord that you may grow in the same, and let your moderation be known unto
all men, For the Lord has a Glorious work to accomplish through you, which few
yet understands; and for that end is he now fitting you for himself, and giving
you a heart to do his will, that he may abide with you for ever; for he has
chosen you for his Portion and for his peculiar Treasure; Oh therefore be you
Zealous for his Name and his Truth upon the Earth, and walk circumspectly, not
as fools, but as wise, ^edeeming the time because the days are evil, not in
chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envy, but in truth and sincerity,
be ye patterns one to another in the way of life, that you may increase your
strength in him, who has all Power in his hand, who assuredly will now make a
short work in the Earth, for his ^lect sake, which has long cried, How long
Lord holy and true, etc. for this has he remembered in the multitude of his
mercies, and nothing shall be able to hinder him from relieving of it, for it
is his own, and his delight is in it, and he will rebuke oppressors of it, and
chasten them with his Iron Rod, and break them to pieces as a Potters vessel,
and none shall be able to rescue them out of his hand; for he is jealous of his
honor, and his renown will he not give to another, his Name shall be great in
the Earth, and his truth among the sons of men, his glory is appearing as the
morning without Clouds, and his brightness is going forth as the Noonday, the
whole Earth shall be filled with his glory, and the ends thereof shall look
unto to him for Salvation, which he is now accomplishing for all who truly wait
upon him, they shall say the Lord is our God alone, our strength alone, our
deliverer alone, our Rock, our refuge, and there is none besides him in Heaven
or Earth that is able to save or destroy, the Kingdom is his, the power is his,
and the glory his for evermore.

Then shall the Lord be known to be one, his Name one, and all the Gods of the
Heathen shall be famished, and the Idols of the World shall come into
everlasting contempt, and perpetual shame which shall never be blotted out, and
the living God shall be the God of the whole Earth, and all Nations shall flow
unto him, then shall a little Child play upon the hole of an Asp, and the
weaned Child shall put his hand in the Cockatrice Den without any harm; for the
destroyer shall be cast out, and there shall be none to hurt in all the Holy
Mountain of the Lord, for it shall be restored into its former perfect Beauty;
and the Earth shall be filled with the knowl^dge of the glory of God, as the
waters cover the Sea; and many shall say come let us walk in the Light of the
Lord, up unto the Mountain of the Lord, and he will teach us of his way, and we
will walk therein, for the Lord is our God, and we are his people, and the
sheep of his Pasture, who will make mention of his Name in the deep, and his
glory upon an Instrument of ten Strings; for the beauty of holiness is come to
be seen, and the Image of the Heavenly is fully renewed; This thing God is
hastening to accomplish, and he will assuredly bring it to pass in his
appointed time, for all who continues in patience and well-doing unto the end;
for this is the reward of the Righteous whom the Lord is now bringing thorew
many Tribulations, in whose Mouths shall be the high praises of the Lord God
for ever more.

Then shall the Merchants of ^abylon be plagued with a fore destruction, for
the reward of iniquity shall be given unto them, they shall howl for pain of
heart, and rore for grief of spirit, and none shall pity them, reprobate
silver shall they be called, because God has rejected them, for their manifold
transgressions has reached to Heaven which has provoked the most high to
wrath days without Number, Oh! that my head were as waters, and mine eyes a
Fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the misery that is
coming upon them; for they have been treacherous both to God and man, and has
far overpassed the deeds of the wicked deceivers in the days of Old; what
shall I say of them, they are fit objects for Gods eternal vengeance to be
poured upon without mix^ure, which will be their reward from the God of Heaven
for ever; all the I mean King, Parliam^nts and Protect^r^.
Mountains which from time to time they have cried unto to cover them, under
which they have crept many ages shall not then hide them from the heavy stroke
of the Almighty God, who is now arising to plead with them by his sword and by
fire; they shall not cumber the Earth very long, neither shall they grieve the
Lord many years longer, but he will ease himself of them, in over-throwing them
in his hot displeasure; for they have long slighted his mercy and often
disp^^sed the offers of his grace, therefore will he laugh at their
destruction, and mock when their fear comes, which now hasteneth apace, out of
which none shall be able to deliver them.

So all my dear brethren and Sisters in the Lord, and in his precious truth,
which shall abide for ever, let not your hearts be troubled, neither be ye
dismayed, for the Lord will r^store Sion as at the first, and Jerusal^m as at
the beginning; and his Name shall be great among his Children, and his blessing
shall rest upon them for ever; therefore all prize his Eternal love, and walk
all worthy of it in your particular places and callings, where the Lord has
set you, that you may blossom as the Rose, and spring as the Lilly in the
field, and may send forth a sweet Savor to the Lord God in the Land of the
Living; often are you in my remembrance, even in the night season, when deep
sleep falls upon men, then do I enter into the Sanctuary of the Lord, and
behold your beauty and comeliness which my Heavenly Father has adorned you
withal, with which my heart is ravished; and when I consider the unexpressible
love and mercy of God to usward, I am even overcome therewith; So this I write
unto you, being part of the overflowings of the Fathers love in me toward you,
which runs forth freely unto the elect of God every where, among whom I
desire this may be read in their particular assemblies in Gods fear and
wisdom, to the edifying, preserving, and strengthening of the whole flock of
God, for which end it was given forth.

or to suffer all things according to the will of God in Christ Jesus, for the
hope that is set before me, who am called of men Ambrose Rigge.

THE END.
