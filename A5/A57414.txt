Robin Hoods progress to Nottingham,
Where he met with fifteen Forresters all on a row,
And he desired of them some news for to know,
But with cross graind words they did him thwart,
For which at last he made them smart.
To the Tune of, bold Robin Hood.


RObin Hood he was and a fall young man,
Derry derry down,
And fifteen Winters old,
And Robin Hood he was a proper young man,
Of courage stout and bold
Hey down derry derry down.
Robin Hood he would and to fair Nottingham,
Derry derry down.
With the general for to bine,
There was be ware of fifteen Forresters
And a drinking Bear, Ale and Wine,
Hey down, derry derry down,
What news, what news, said bold Robin Hood;
derry derry down.
What news fain would thou know?
Our King has provided a shooting match,
And I Am ready with my Bow,
Hey down derry derry down.
We hold it in scorn then said the Forresters,
derry derry down,
That ever a boy so young
Should bear a Bow before our King,
That Is not able to draw one string,
Hey, down, derry derry down,
I Will hold you twenty marks said bold Robin Hood
derry derry down,
By the leave of our Lady
That I Will hit a mark a hundred rod,
And I Will cause a Heart to dye,
Hey down, derry derry down,
We Will hold you twenty mark then said she Forresters
derry derry, down,
By the leave of our Lady,
Thou hit'st not the mark a hundred rod
Nor causest a Heart to dye
Hey down derry derry down.
Robin Hood he bent up a noble Bow,
derry derry down,
And a broad arrow he let fly,
He hit the mark a hundred rod
And he caused a Heart to die
Hey down, derry derry down.
Some said he brake ribs one or two,
derry derry down,
And some said he brake three,
The arrow within the Heart would not'abide,
But it glanced in two or three,
Hey down, derry derry down,


THe Heart did skip, and the Heart did leap,
derry derry down,
And the Heart lay on the ground
The wager is mine said bold Robin Hood,
If'twere for a thousand pound,
Hey down, derry derry down.
The wager's none of thine then said the Forresters
derry derry down,
Although thou be in haste,
Take up thy Bow and get thee hence
Lest we thy sides do bas^e,
Hey down, derry derry down,
Robin Hood he took up his noble Bow
derry derry down,
And his broad arrows all amain,
And Robin Hood he laughed and begun to smile
As he went over the Plain,
Hey down, derry derry down.
Then Robin Hood he bent his noble Bow
derry derry down,
And his broad arrows he let fly,
Till fourteen of these fifteen forresters
Upon the ground did lie
Hey down, derry derry down.
He that did this quarrel first begin,
derry derry down,
Went tripping over the Plain;
But Robin Hood he bent his noble Bow,
And he ^etcht him back again,
Hey down derry, etc.
You said I was no Archer said Robin Hood,
derry derry down,
But say so now again,
With that he sent another arrow
That split his head in twain,
Hey down, derry, etc.
You have found me an Archer says Robin Hood
derry derry down,
Which will make your Wives for to wring
And wish that you had never spoke the word,
That I could not draw^ne string,
Hey down, derry, etc.
The people that lived in fair Nottingham,
derry derry down,
Came running out amain
Supposing to have taken bold Robin Hood,
With the Forresters that were ^lain,
Hey down, derry, etc.
Some lost Legs, and some lost Arms
derry derry down,
And some did lose their blood,
But Robin Hood he took up his noble Bow
And is gone to the merry green Wood
hey down derry, etc.
They carried these Forresters into fair Nottingham
derry derry down,
As many there did know
They dig'd them graves in their Churchyard
And they buried them all a row,
hey down, derry derry down.
