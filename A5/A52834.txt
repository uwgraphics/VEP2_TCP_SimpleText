THE GENERAL EXERCISE Ordered by his HIGHNESS the Prince of Orange, To be
punctually observed of all the Infantry in Service of the States General of the
United Provinces.
General Observations.
I. IT must be understood that before the Exercise begin, the Officers at the
first Advertisement by tuck of Drum advancing their Pikes, shall turn about to
the right; and upon the second, march through the Battalion, ranging themselves
in the Rear in the same order they were upon the Front; the Sergeants, who were
posted behind the Battalion, separating themselves to the right and left, shall
take their Places upon the Flanks till the Exercise be done, and the Officers
shall have taken their former Post upon the Front at the forementioned
Advertisement by tuck of Drum, at which time the said Sergeants shall also
return to the Rear as before. II. The Drummers shall stay upon the Wings of the
Battalion during the Exercise, excepting those that are in the Center before
the Pikes, who in the time that the Officers march through to the Rear, shall
range themselves behind the Major, to be always ready either for giving
Advertisements, or in case the Battalion might be exercised by tuck of Drum.
III. No man shall offer to stir or make the least motion till the Word of
Command be fully pronounced, and then to perform what shall be commanded with a
graceful readiness, and quick motion all at the same time. IV. The Soldier
having his Musket shouldered, must stand straight up on his Limbs, hold up his
Head, and look always to the commanding Officer, making no Motion, but such as
shall be ordered, which must be observed as a general Rule in all Commands. V.
The Soldiers must keep their Feet a small pace distant from each other, their
Heels straight in a line, and their Toes turned outwardly, holding their
Muskets with their left hand upon their left Shoulder, the Thumb in the hollow
above the Butt, holding the Iron which covers the Drawer close to the Shoulder,
that the Muzzel of the Musket behind may stand somewhat high, turning the Lock
a little outward, so that the Butt may come to the Buttons, or middle of the
Breast, and the Muskets over all be the more equally carried. VI. The Match
must be holden in the left hand, one end betwixt the first and second finger,
and the other betwixt the two last, both the ends a fingers length without the
back of the hand, so that the rest thereof may hang betwixt the hand and the
Butt of the Musket; and because in exercising the Match is to be laid down no
more, it must never be kindled without express Order, VII. With a shouldered
Musket the left Elbow ought to be turned a little outward from the Body, but
without constraint of the Arm, and the right Arm hanging loose downwards along
the Body with the Palm of the hand turned to the Thigh.

Here follows the Manual of the Pike, beginning from the Advance.
THE Posture of a Pike-man with his Pike advanced, must be the same as the
Musketeers with a shouldered Musket, viz. that he stand straight upon his
Limbs, holding up his Head, looking briskly, wirh his Eye always turned toward
the Commanding Officer, and making no other motions than the Commands do bear,
that he keep his Feet a small pace distant from each other, his Heels in a
straight Line, his Toes turned outwardly, and holding the Butt end of the Pike
in his right hand, stretched downwards along his Body to the full length, so
that the back of his hand be turned so much outwardly, as his Arm in such
posture can suffer without constraint, and the Pike be kept close as well to
his shoulder as the outside of his Thigh, that it may stand straight upwards,
without inclining to either hand, which Posture must be always observed with an
advanced Pike.
