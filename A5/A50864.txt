place of Sale. 1691.

To the Nobility, Gentry, Ladies, Gentlewomen, etc.
THe design of this Sale, and of all others made the preceding years in this
place, was to gratify the Curious, to divert the Melancholy, to exercise the
Judgment of the most exalted minds, that condescend to grace the Wells, and
aggrandize the Walks with their appearance: I am sufficiently sensible, that
abstractedly from the honest gain, I propose to my self, that the Honor of
your Company, the noble congress I have had, has over and above compensated
the expense of my Time, and the exercise of my Lungs; being with nothing more
gratified, than that I have had the favor of discoursing before persons of the
most exquisite parts (perhaps the ablest Judges of Sense and Learning in the
World.) This Collection of Paintings will appear to the skilful to be Valuable
and Inviting, the Prints that will follow Choice and Curious, carefully
preserved by the Proprietors, designed and made by the greatest Masters. The
China Curiosities, most of the finest make. In short, let the event of this
Sale be what it will, I am resolved neither to be sowred by a bad, nor elated
by a prosperous one; solacing my self in this one grand Philosophical
Consideration, that if I can but oblige my Friends, please others, and offer
matter of Entertainment indifferently to the whole, I shall have attained what
I desired, viz. my wishes will be consummated; in the Contemplation of which I
am resolved to live undisturbed.
