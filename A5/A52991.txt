A NEW SONG of the Misfortunes of an Old Whore and her Brats.
[1]
'THO the Old Hag of Rome
Has Bewitched us all Dumb,
She can Tongue-tye our Muses no longer;
We now spue out her Charms,
And sing the brave Arms
Of great Orange and Schomberg, ding-dong Sir.
[2]
If we opened our Lips,
Wooden Peep-holes and Whips
Was of late the mild Penance enjoined us;
Now Truth's no more Treason,
We esteem it a season
To be merry, and so you shall find us.
[3]
Life-and-Fortune Addresses
Shall not wear out our Presses,
To flatter and sooth a Just Nero:
But loud Declarations,
To secure the three Nations
From the French and from Lilli-burlero.
[4]
See how each Popish Gull
D^es look silly and dull
O hone! O hone! all are Lamenting;
They Have no Catholic Banter,
No wise Hind and Panther,
Nor any thing else worth the Printing.
[5]
While we Heretics do write,
Ay and Print too in spite
Of the Devil, to revenge our late wrongs Sir;
And the Hawkers hoarse Lungs
With our Lampoons and Songs
Make the Streets echo all the day long Sir.
[6]
Now brave Orange advances,
What the famed League with France is,
We shall know to poor Catholics sorrow:
Stricken with Pannick Fears,
How the VVhelps hang their Ears,
Pack up Relics and bid us good Morrow!
[7]
Father Petre, and others
Of his Politic Brothers,
(Who one would think should have disdained it)
Are on fire to be gone,
Tho they might every one,
If they would stay here a little, be Sainted.
[8]
Just like old Rars and Mice,
These bold Vermin are wise,
When they find a house ready to tumble,
Away strait they advance,
Bound for Flanders or France,
Adieu, Votre Serviteur humble.
[9]
But pray what shall become
Of The young Kitlings of Rome,
I mean those the Old Whore has Converted;
When they are gripped by the Claws
Of revived Penal Laws,
And by all Ghostly Fathers deserted.
[10]
It Is hard to leave the poor Elves
Thus to shift for themselves,
^or unless you would confirmed the Babes better-a
With your Cowardice tainted,
They Will e'ne grudge to be Sainted
^ith St. Coleman, St. Whitebread, etc.
[11]
So when Witches are taken
For enchanting Folks Bacon,
^ows, Horses, or any such thing Sir;
And the Hangman once takes 'em,
Their Imps all forsake 'em,
^^d bequeath 'em to a tight Hempen-string Sir.
[12]
Our great Statesmen and Judges,
The Jesuits true Drudges
(...) advance the Plots of Holy Church Sir,
Do make wretched Grimaces,
Losing Pensions and Places,
To a Parliament left in the lurch Sir.
[13]
And the young Welch-man's Sire,
Stuck like Dun in the Mire,
With revengeful Despair looks around him,
And then Curses the Crowd,
That with Suffrages loud
Shouted (Vive le Roy) when they Crowned him.
[14]
He thinks it is an hard Fate
Now to Capitulate,
And revoke his Indulged Dispensations;
To his Sons Terms to buckle,
To a Parliament truckle,
And Eat up his kind Declarations.
[15]
It Is hard that dull Heretics
Still suspicious of Tricks,
Cannot believe the young Bantling's his Son Sir;
As if Priests could n't Create,
At least Transubstantiate
Him a Boy for an Heir to his Crown Sir.
[16]
Nay renowned Lords and Ladies
A long Bead-row have made us,
With the Midwife and Learned Physicians;
Cannot all this convince
That it is a Welsh Prince,
Though we publish the plain Depositions?
[17]
Well it seems (to be short)
There Is no Remedy for it,
Both his Gods and his Friends are retiring;
And his Army falls off,
While his Enemies scoff
To see the Prince curb his aspiring.
[18]
Have we not a wise King
To resolve he would bring
All to Rome's Lure, or else Sacrifice Sir,
Three Kingdoms to his spleen,
And to the Will of his Queen?
Did the World ever hear of a wiser?
[19]
Without one sturdy fight
He Is obliged to alight
From the Throne which he envied his Brother,
And may like a poor Biggot
Go embarque in a Friggot,
To see if he can find such another.
[20]
Since these Switzers and Dutchmen
Come to stand by our Churchmen,
With hard grim Fellows from Fin-land,
The old Politic Whore
Now must never hope more
To sit brooding over Plots against England.
[21]
Is It not Reason and Sense,
If a King will Dispense
With our Statutes and with his own Word Sir,
To Decide the Just Cause
Of Religion and Laws
With a swinging great Protestant-sword Sir?
[22]
The French Tyrant dissembles,
And huffs, though he trembles,
We shall Visit that Son of a Whore Sir;
If the VVeather hold fair,
VVe'd fain take a Tour there,
As our Fathers did in Days of Yore Sir.
[23]
While the Germans before
Pay him off his old score
For the Mischief they have felt and do fear Sir;
With Pike, Sword and Pistol,
We shall Probe his old Fistule,
And Charge the Dog home in the rear Sir.
FINIS.
