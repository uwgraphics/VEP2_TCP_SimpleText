A new Ballad of the Soldier and Peggy
To a new Northern tune.


IT was a brave Soldier,
that long lived in wars,
He would into England,
to try his affairs.
A gallant young Creature,
enchanted his eye,
It is for thy love Peggy,
I dye I dye.
She had a good husband,
that loved her well.
For Gold and for Silver,
none did her excel,
Yet Peggy would listen,
unto the Soldiers cry,
It is for thy love Peggy,
I dye I dye.
O pretty Pegyy
let seorows remove,
And grant me a kiss,
in token of Love,
O take a thousand,
one is but a few,
I Will leave my own husband,
to Travel with you.
O pretty Peggy
if thou will be mine,
All the gold that I get
it shall be thine.
Father nor Mother
thou'le never see more,
If thou will go over Sea,
with a Soldier.
So took the keys from her side
to her chest she is gone.
All the gold that she has
with her she has taken.
She left the Babe motherlesse,
and the Bed bare,
And she is gone over Sea,
with a Soldier.
As Peg and Soldier,
went over the plain,
He twinkled at her,
and she smiled again
He Courted her bravely,
as young men should do,
And after said Peggy,
I love none but you,
As Peggy went up the street,
so went she down,
All that did meet her,
ask where she was bound.
She answered them quickly,
she could not tell where,
For she is gone over Sea,
with a Soldier.
Her husband came home,
so late in the night,
He asked for Peggy.
his joy and delight.
They answered him quickly,
they s^uld not tell where.
For she was gone over Sea,
with a Soldier.


He sadled his Horse
and rid to the shore,
Thinking to take Peggy
before she got over
He asked for Peggy
but she was not there,
For she was gone over Sea
with a Soldier,
I pray you good Nurse
be good to me child.
And thou'le have thy money
at every months end,
Thoule never want money,
win(...),
Though (...) over Sea
with a Soldier.
He cursed the Carpenter
that made the Ship.
And likewise the Plummer
for pluming so deep.
He banned the wind
and the water so clear,
That carried Peg over Sea
with a Soldier.
She had not been over Sea
passing Months three,
But she would go home again
if it might be,
To speak with her husband
the matter to clear,
Cause she had bin over Sea
with a Soldier.
This wanton young woman
is come home again,
When all her money,
and coin it is gone.
For she could no longer,
in Ireland stay,
For she had no gold,
nor money to pay.
I pray you good husband,
will you for forgive me,
And all that is amiss,
amended shall be.
I Will live with my husband,
and Baby so dear.
And I Will never go again,
with a Soldier.
Come hither sweet Peggy,
thou art welcome to me,
So all that's amiss,
amended may be.
I pray God forgive my sins,
and I Will forgive thee,
If thoult live at home.
with ^y baby and me.
All you good wives,
that hears this my song.
Live at home with your husbands
and do them no wrong.
For youth it is wanton,
and will have a stain.
And Peggy is at home.
with her husband again.
And thus of my song,
I will make and end,
Praying for Gods favor,
for women and men.
Destring them all,
in their Country to stay,
And never to wander,
so Vainly away.
