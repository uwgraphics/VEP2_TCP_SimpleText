A NEW BALLAD upon the Land-Bank: Or, Credit Restored.
To the Tune of All for Love and no Money.
WOuld any Man of common sense
Grudge to spend his Eighteen pence,
At the Rose in Covent Garden,
(Where Nick Spalden was Churchwarden)
To see a Mountebank show Tricks,
With Tom Speed's Notes and Hasle-sticks.
He Will turn your Money into Wood,
Then make an Act that it is as good
Within six pounds as 'twas before:
But why just six pounds, and no more
Nor less? why (Z -- ds and Bl -- d!)
Cause this came first into his Head,
Or else Seven, Nine, or Eight,
Or Cinque or Quater had been the Rate.
Then see him send this Talley
With Tom Speed's Note to Grocers-Alley,
(For Sons of Women never married
To place of Birth (by Law) are carried)
Where you shall see this 94
Shrink to 50 in an hour.
Grocers-Hall brings all to Par,
Here first and last all equal are:
Grocers-Hall is a Level,
Where little C -- per will sell as well
As tall and trusty Sir J -- n E -- well.
Whatever Tailors throw in Hell,
Serves to make, or mend, or sell
For Cucumbers or Cabbage;
So riffle, raffle, Chequer-Baggage,
Pro's or Con's, hic, hec, or hoc,
Sell all alike in Common-stock.
It is not safe for Trained-Bands
To let lie in Tradesmens hands
(Whom we have bilkt) such Weapons,
As Boys at Shrove-tide throw at Capons:
These may be used to arm the Weavers,
Or serve the Prentices for Cleavers.
And if the Rabble cannot come at sticks,
They may take these for Cat-sticks.
Therefore the second day of April
Owners of Talleys at your peril,
Bring them into Grocers-Hall,
Or not have them paid at all.
Well nickt for time! first skipt (I warrant)
Least this should prove a foolish Errant:
But Fools sent the first day (by Command Sir)
Take time to the second to bring an Answer.
So the thing is laid right in the Cum and the quando,
The Fools are employed by a Continuando.
Then for a Reward
To S -- ck and W -- rd
For giving Talleys House-room,
Here follows the Law
Made by our Bashaw,
Sprung up as quick as a Mushroom.
You must know (forsooth)
The whole Faith and Troth
Of our Mortgaged Nation,
Was bound up in Conscience
From granting a License,
Or making a Creation
Of any other Bank,
Though this was a Hank
The Lawmakers never thought on:
It Is no matter for that,
He Will show it as pat,
To be denied by Not-one.
The word THE in a Name
By Law is the same
As if 'twere said a Sole-Bank,
As A. by himself A.
Set before B. A. N. K.
Signifies a whole Bank.
But H -- ley and F -- ley
Non-obstante this Sole
With intent to damn the House of
Commons, brought in
A Bill full of Sin,
But when 'twas past, a Deus of
One Souz or Penny
Of New Milled Money
(Before the same was Coined)
They brought to the 'Chequer,
But they Talked all by Letter,
And gave their Opinions signed.
A Pl -- gue of G -- d d -- m 'em
For Sons of Moab and Ammon,
What d' think they said to us?
That Ten per Cent.
Was a fair Discount:
And what d' think they did to us?
Not a Man to be found
That would stand bound
For Two Millions and a half;
Bulleys and Hectors,
Poor Dogs and Projectors,
How should they have Pelf.
To give 40 per Cent.
To have Money lent
On Talleys in our own Bank,
Is cheaper by far
Than to have them at Par,
By setting up a Land-Bank.
The Land-Bank was part
Of Jacobites Art,
This I said, and so I Will have it,
And to make it more clear,
I did (I know where)
Produce a Plot-Affidavit.
For when I cast a Spell,
And pretend to foretell
A thing within my own reach,
Then bring it about,
(Which is easy to do it)
I pass both for Statesman and Witch.
I Will have a Law made,
None shall set up the Trade
To borrow or lend Money,
But they at Grocers-shop,
Who are at a full stop,
And neither pay all nor any.
And this will raise Credit,
For they would pay if they had it,
And what can you have more, (Sir)
Then I Will send them sticks,
To give their Creditors licks,
And beat them out of door, (Sir.)
No Bank, nor Bank-Bills,
Nor Paper nor Quills,
Like theirs shall be used,
And this will requite 'em
(Or else we will Knight 'em)
For having been abused.
To give Notes for Money,
Without paying any,
Let any Folks else if they dare (Sir)
To know 'em in kind,
Before or behind;
Is penal as bug -- ing a Mare, (Sir.)
To draw 'em or paint 'em,
Or follow or ape 'em,
Shall be a Sin against the State,
To sue 'em or strike 'em,
Or do any thing like 'em,
Shall send you into Newgate.
But when all this is done,
This shall not overrun
Our Bills on the Capitation,
But that they may ride
Aside or astride,
And trot it all over the Nation.
We 've talked with some Men,
And we'll talk to 'em again,
To be our Undertakers,
And if they will not discount 'em,
At Ten Pounds per Centum,
We'll try to sell 'em by the Hawkers
But the Clause of Exclusion
Has a plain Allusion,
By no other Bank is only meant a Land-One,
Land-Bank is the De -- l,
From whence comes all evil,
'Twas they that fired London.
'Twas they called for Light
A little before Night,
To find Faults with their Fellow Members
But we knew the Plot,
Could they Candles have got,
They Would burnt the House to Embers.
They hinder our Votes,
And Soldiers New Coats,
For the Tallies on the Salt-Act,
For which they offered Ninety,
Are now proffered for Fifty,
And this is matter of Fact.
If we don't knock 'em down,
We can never hold our own,
'Cause theirs is grounded on Reason,
But whoever talks sense
About Credit or Pence,
I would have hanged for Treason.
Therefore let Will -- m L -- nd
Make the Kingdom bound
To the Bank of England by Indenture
To serve Apprentice,
And fast when Lent is,
For eleven Years adventure.
K -- g, C -- ns, and L -- ds,
Shall be bound by their words
To stand by and defend this Wood-pile,
With Life and Member,
And fresh Hasle-Timber,
In case the other should fail.
I gave 'em their Lesson,
At opening the Session,
To ask no questions about it,
But do as I bid 'em,
And Vote as I Would have them,
The Project is mine, (if I hit it)
What a Negative Law,
To bind up the paw
Of Legislative powers (Sir)
This is such a jest,
And so like the rest,
That sure it must be yours (Sir.)
And mark what I say,
Stake down and I Will lay,
A hundred pound Talley to 94 pound (Sir)
This will do no good,
But you're got in a Wood,
And will run your self aground (Sir.)
