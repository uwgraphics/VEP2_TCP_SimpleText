The Mind of the Frontispeece.
REader, observe, and see Jehovah stand
Showring down blessings to the grasping hand
Of new-made, naked Man, that takes delight
To take the Crowns, but cares not to requite
The gracious giver of such gifts as those,
With any thing, except it be with blows;
A fair reward: but sure it much redowns
To Man's disgrace, to give God blows, for Crowns

TO My much-honoured and Esteemed Friend, Edward Benlowes, Esquire.
SIR,
I Am confident you cannot have greater cause to wonder at my boldness, then I
have reason to admire at your Learning, and Piety; for indeed the rare example
of your virtues add^d much alacrity to my endeavors, which are but shallow if
compared to the depth of your understanding. Sir, the limits of my request
(though they are large) extend themselves no further then this, That You would
be pleased to permit this my unfleg'd bird to rest under the wings of Your
protection, that I may ever be engaged to boast of so worthy a Patron: Sir, as
I know I have errors, so I know you have goodness to excuse them, and I a heart
to be thankful, and always be a faithful honourer of Your Virtues, whilst I
am

Sir, Your Servant to Command, JOHN QUARLES.

To the Reader.
Kind Reader,
LET me lay this Injunction upon thee, before thou permittest thy eye to survey
this little Volume, which is. That thou will resolve to pardon; I will not say
for what, for fear thou should be s^rupulous and not Read: The Subject is
Divine, and I confess too good to be so badly handled; however I have done my
best endeavor, and Alexander did no more when he conquered Kingdoms; But
Reader, because I will not detain thine eye too long in one place, I bid thee

Farewell.
To my Muse.
TELL me presumptuous Muse how dare thou treat
Upon a Subject so sublime, so great!
Alas how dare thy infancy aspire
So high as Heaven, where the caelestial quire
Of soul-enchanting Angels, hourly sing,
Anthems of Joy to their mellifluous King!
This is a task that invocates the best
And loftiest quils; Heavens love must not b'exprest
With wanton language; he that shall presume
To labor in this work, must first persume
His Soul with true divinity, and breathe
Celestial airs, that Readers may perceive
Their Author labors with a serious heart
TO embalm his actions with divinest art;
This is a field whose spacious bounds extend
Themselves to infinite; who strives to end
Shall still begin, and having once begun
This pleasing progress, must not cease to run
Until he stops in Heaven, there lies the gain,
Who runs with Faith is certain to obtain.
If then my Muse, thou can divinely mount
This Sacred Stage, thou needst not fear t'account
Thy actions prosperous, strive thou to stand
Guarded with Faith, and Heaven will lend a hand
To prop thee up, his power will infuse
Sufficient matter for an active Muse
To work upon, his wisdom will direct
Thy painful hand, his mercies will correct
Thy rambling thoughts, and teach thee to proclaim
The unsum'd up glories of his Royal Name;
Abandon earth, and bid vain thoughts adeu
Thou can not serve thy God and Mammon too;
Rouse then, and let thy well-prun'd Eagles wings
Mount thee aloft, let not terrestiall things
Disturb thy resolutions, let them all
Evade thy mind; thy thoughts must grow too tall
For such low toys: stir up thy zealous fire,
And what thou can not well express, admire.
See, here, a Phoenix rare, raised from ye dust
of precious Parents; Fathers Effigies just
Who for his Genius and ingenious Parts,
Of Learning, Worth, and Wit, to Conquer hearts
By pleasant Poetry; Seems to inherit
(By Transmigration) his rare Fathers Spirit,
As, old Pythag'ras held: So sweetly, He
Does Patrizare, in full Ex'ssencie


Gods Love, AND Man's Unworthiness.
GOD! how that word has thunder-clapt my Soul
Into a ravishment; I must condole
My forward weakness; Ah, where shall I find
Sufficient Metaphors t'express my mind?
Thou heart-amusing word, how have thou filled
My Soul with Halelujahs, and distilled
Wonders into me! Oh, that I could break
My heart in pieces, and divinely speak
My mind in Raptures, that the frantique Earth
May bathe it felf in these sweet streams of mirth.
Then rouse my Soul, and practice how to turn
Thy wonders into language; do not burn
Thy sacred fuel in a place where none
Can have the benefit but thee alone.
Hoist up thy Sails, and let thy speedy motion
Hurry thee hence into the boundless Ocean:
Observe thy compass, keep a constant pace,
And Heaven will steer thee to the Port of Grace.
^is strange to think, how the Almighty can
(That is so pure) love such a thing as Man,
Whose primitive corruption makes him worse
Then nothing, whose Rebellion claims a curse,
More then affection: How can Heaven endure
A thing that can be nothing but impure?
Man (like a word that is void of reason) sounds
In every ear, his very name expounds
A misery; at best, he needs must be
But vain; And how can Heaven love vanity?
Man (like a shadow) flies before the Sun
Of his afflictions, and is still undone
By his own doing, he is his own pursuer;
And how can Heaven love such a self-undoer?
Man (like a naked worm) is often found
Digging himself into the loathsome ground
Of ruin, he is a Traitor to his Bliss;
And how can Heaven love such a worm as this?
Man (like a flash of lightning) courts the world
With lavish flames, and by and by is hurled
Into that Nothing, whence at first it came;
Then how can God love such a short-lived flame?
Man (like a Reed) is evermore inclined
To shake, and totter with each blast of wind;
He Is always running to the ground with speed:
And how can Heaven love such an earthly Reed?
Man (like the dust) is always blown, and ^ost
From place to place, and flies, till it has lost
Its Center; never resting in one place:
Then how can Heaven love that which flies in's face?
Man (like a Fly) still buzzes up and down
From cup to cup, and sips on, till he drown
Himself in pleasure; fears no stander by:
And how can Heaven love such a drunken Fly?
Man (like a Rainbow) oftentimes appears
Clothed in colors, but can claim no years,
No days, nay hardly hours, but must decay;
And how can heaven love that which loves no stay?
Man (like a bubble) floats upon the waves
Of his desires, whilst every blast enslaves
His brittle substance, filled with windy troubles*
And how can heaven love such unco^stant bubbles?
Man (like the froth) spewed from the Oceans breast,
^s tyded up and down, but knows no rest,
Nor perpetuity; and can betroth
It self to nothing: Heaven loves no such froth.
Man (like the wind) is every moment flying
To every place, and hates to be complying
Or resting any where: How can it be,
That Heaven can love so much inconstancy?
Man (like a Swallow) loves the fragrant Spring
Of Earths delights, but with a spreading wing
Flies from the Winters more congealed breast;
And how can Heaven love such a Summer guest?
Man (like a smoke) presumptuously aspires
Into the air, and by and by retires
Himself to nothing, nothing's his conclusion;
And how can Heaven love such a base confusion?
Man (like a fire) whose green and scragged fuel
Denies to burn, until it fight a duel
With the in^ount^ring Bellows, which atlast
Obtains the conquest, then it burns as fast,
And seems, as 'twere, ambitious to expire;
Then how can Heaven love such a raging fire?
Man (like an arrow) being once let go
Out from the Archers well-commanded bow,
Affronts the Clouds; at last, having spent the store
Of his small strength, falls down, and seems t^ador^
Th'inferior Earth, which, with a welcome, hides
His down* cast head within her wounded sides,
Where he remains, and scorns to be withstood:
Man can be any thing, but what is good.
And cannot Man be good? strange kind of tone!
What? has he wept himself into a stone,
Like Niobie? no sure; I fear his eyes
Were never loaded with such large supplies:
Ah, could he weep a flood, Heaven that prepares
His ears to hear, would bottle up his tears
In his remembrance; every drop should shine
Like Pearls, absconded in a golden Mine*
His sins command a deluge; could his head
Be turned into a fountain, could he shed
An Ocean at a drop, it could not cover
His sins (which are mountanious) from the Lover
Of real drops; for he would soon discry
Those sand-excelling crimes, where e're they lie:
Yet would his Soul so much compassionate
The flowing sorrows of his wa^^^y state,
That with a calming hand he would remove
His rocky sins, and hide them with his Love;
He would have pity, and with speed consent
T'express his love, when all our tears are spent.
Should Heaven, who justly may, for every sin
Drop down a plagne, and make it live within
Man's guilty Soul, the world would quickly be
Transformed, and changed into a leprosy.
Let none despair, for Heavens known mercies can
Out-infinite the greatest sins of man.
Oh love beyond degree! Shall Heaven indulge
Himself to Man? and shall not Man divulge
A gratefulness to him, whose hand prepares
To wipe away his sin-polluted cares?
Ungrateful Miscreant, how can thou view
Thy former miseries, and not renew
Thy thanks to him, whose power set thee free,
And brought thee back from thy captivity?
Have thou abandoned Love? Will thou imprint
Thy Soul with baseness? Ah, what obvious flint
Has turned Affections edg? What, art thou bent
To shoot at him, that labors to prevent
The arrows of thy ruin, which will fly
Into thy breast, except he puts them by?
Have thou transformed thy heart into a rock
That will not move? Shall mercy call, and knock,
And thou not hear? What? have thou armed thy
With senseless marble, that no flaming dart
Of Love can enter? Have thou vowed to stand heart
In opposition? Cannot Gods Command
Force thee to bow? Art thou resolved to sport
With thy destruction, and not yield the Fort?
Oh yield be times; do not resolve to be
Too much a slave to Infidelity:
For know (frail wretch) thy strength consists in clay;
When Mercy's lost, then Judgment finds the way*
Rally thy thoughts together, and throw down
Thy brazen walls, thy yielding yields a Crown:
For it is in vain to oppose an arm that can
Out-grasp the measure of so small a span.
Alas, Alas! it may be quickly seen
What a large disproportion is between
Thy God, and thee: Consider, he is all,
And thou art nothing; what can be more small?
Or what more great? for he is infinite,
And thou art finite; He is full of light,
And thou of darkness; He is filled with Love,
And thou art stuffed with baseness; He Is a Dove,
And thou a worm: Thus, thus thou may discry
His firmness, and thine own infirmity.
Then be not obstinate, but strike the sails
Of thy desires to him that never fails;
And know, it is easy in an inch of time
To take a worm ingarrison'd with slime;
For such a thing thou art, and all thy power
Must yield to Heavens assaults; thy April shower
Has no continuance: therefore do not strive
Against a God, whose Wisdom can contrive
What pleases him: Alas! thy state is grounded
Upon contingencies, thou art compounded
Of nothing but uncertainties; thy arm
Assumes no power, except it be to harm
Thy wilful self: Then why will thou contend
With him that importunes to be thy Friend?
Thy Friend, (Soul-saving word) what higher Bliss
Can crown a heart, then such a Friend as this?
Oh life of Ravishment! how can it be
A God, a worm, and yet a sympathy?
Strange condescension* was the like e're known,
Or spoke by any mouth, except his own?
His balmy breath declares, that he will save
And succor those that faithfully do crave
His blessed assistance: Hark, and hear him say,
Ye that are heavy loaded, come away,
Oh come to me, I am content to bear
Your burdens, and extenuate your care.
What higher note of love was ever strained
To any ear? Oh how has man obtained
So great a friendship! It Is a happy lot,
Nay, and a wonder not to be forgot.
And yet it is not strange, that he should prove
So true a Lover, that is composed of Love,
And can do nothing else: If he correct,
It Is for thy crimes; he only has the effect
Of anger: for his grieved Spirit moans
To punish sinners, and to hear their groans.
His Soul takes no delight to crush to death
Th'offending pris'oners of th'inferior Earth*
He is the rich Exchequor of all good,
And is by nothing (except man) withstood.
All things perform what they were made to do,
But only man, that strives to prove untrue
To his Creator: nothing can be found
Within thy breast, but that which is unsound.
How sad it is to hear The Almighty say.
I Have nourished children, that are gone astray,
And scorn to own me! Oh rebellious dust!
That hate my paths, because my ways are just.
The Ox will know his Owner, and the Ass
His Masters crib; but Israel, alas,
Will not acknowledge me, but have destroyed
Themselves, and made their understandings void:
Has not my fury then just cause to swell,
Because they can do nothing but rebel?
Nefandeous Creature, how can thou endure
Thy wretched self? Ah, why will thou procure
Thine own destructions? Shall all creatures be
Obedient to their owners, only thee?
And will thou not acknowledge him that gave
Large blessings to thee, and desires to save
Thy Soul from torments, if thou would incline
Thy will to his, whose thoughts are all divine?
Forget obduracy, and learn the art
Of loving him, that loves an upright heart:
Go ruminate upon thy base estate,
And be, unto thy self, compassionate.
Yield to thy Maker with a cheerful brow;
First know what it is to love, and after, how.
Love is the Laws Fulfiller; he that will
Love God aright, must practice how to fill
His Soul with true affection; for the ways
Of Heaven are paved with Love: Immortal praise
Attend his Courts; He that forgets to love
Forgets his God: They that desire to prove
Heavens amatorious Guests, must first admire
How such a spark as Man came to aspire
To such a flame, and how he came to be,
Not only Earths, but Heavens, Epitomie:
Be serious then, and let thy thoughts reflect
Upon Heavens goodness, and thy disrespect.
God out of Nothing (except Love) compiled
This spacious World, as if some princely child
Were to be born: His providential care
Was (as it were) ambitious to prepare
The quintessence of pleasures to invite
Some stately Guest to banquet with delight.
First he extracted from a darksom Cell
A glorious Light, whose beauty pleased him well:
Then he prepared a Canopie, inlayd
With glittring Pearl, whose twinkling luster made
A heavenly show; and afterward his hand
Dashed back the waters from the naked Land:
Then he commanded, that the Earth, being come
Out from the Oceans new delivered womb,
Should be adorned with an imbroidered Gown*
That so her new-warm'd bowels might abound
With several fruits. --
-- Thus having played his part
Upon this Theater, this life of art,
He ushered in a thing, which pleased him best,
(He made the Feast, and after made the Guest;)
Called by the name of Man, a naked, small,
And dusty, shiftless Creature; this was all,
And all this nothing, but a lump of death,
Until inspired by Heavens all* quickening breath.
Vain, simple wretch; ah, how could thou behave
Thy self before a Judge, so great, so grave?
Had thou but seen thy self, thou would have
Thy self to death, and with a blush, defied (cried
Thy base estate, to think that thou should be
Natures most rude and base Anatomy.
Could thou expect that Heaven would entertain
A thing so poor? so weak? so vile? so vain?
Which, like a spark blown from a new-made fire,
Can only show it self, and then expire*
Was it for this the All-Creator made
Such large Provisions? Was It for this he laid
Such rich Foundations? Was It for this his Power
Decked this well-pleasing odoriferous Bower?
Was it for this (this little world) he formed
A world so great? Was it for this he warmed
The Earths chill bosom? Was It for this he spent
His six days labor? Was It for this intent
He made a Paradise? where Flora spread
Her fragrant Offspring, and made Earth a bed
Of rare compounded Pleasures, where he placed
This new-come Guest, whose very looks disgraced
The face of beauty, to whose thriftless hand
He gave that Government, with this Command:
Of all the trees that here thou do behold,
Thy lips being authorized, thou may be bold
To taste with freedom, only one, which I
Conjure thee from, therefore restrain thine eye
From lusting after it; if not, thy breath
Shall glut it self in everlasting death:
Forget not my Commands, but let thy breast
Be always faithful, and thou shall be blessed.
Thus the Recorder having spoke at large
This well-deliv'red (although ill-kept) Charge,
He after said;
It is not good that Man should be alone
Without a help, I Will therefore make him one.
Oh sacred Prudence! Here we may discern
A sweet Conjunction; here our Souls may learn
Wisdom and Love, both which, if not enjoyed,
Pleasures prove vanities, and Blessings void.
Heaven, whose unidle artful hand had set
Man, as a Jewel, in his Cabinet,
Thought it unfit, that those delights which he
Had made by his most powerful Love, should be
Monopoliz'd by one, he therefore laid
Adam asleep, and having done, he made
Out of a crooked rib (strange kind of art)
A woman, fair, complete, in every part;
Nay, and a helper too; for in conclusion
She helped poor Adam to his own confusion.
Oh most detested deed! Unconstant wife,
To prove a Traitor to thy husbands life
As soon as made: Fond wretch, could nothing suit
With thy nice palate, but forbidden fruit?
Ah, could thy longing lie no longer hid?
What? did thou long, because thou were forbid?
Was there no tree that could content thine eye,
But only that which was forbidden? Fie,
Oh shame to think thou should so quickly waste
Thine hours of pleasure for a minutes taste:
Could thou not like, or fall in love with any
But that? Heaven had but one, and thou had many
Wherewith to please thine appetite; and yet
Would thou prove so ambitious, as to sit
Upon the highest twigg? Ah, could the advice
Of Satan tempt thee to this avarice
With so much ease, and make thee rashly do
So foul a deed, and tempt thy Adam too?
Preposterous wretch, how have thou spread a cloud
Over thy head? What? did thou think to shroud
Thy self from vengeance? Having eat thy death.
Could thou expect to live? Oh no, thy breath
Offended Heaven: but ah, had thou but thought
(Before thy heart had entertained a fault
So great as this) what 'twas to dye, thy mind
Had made thee more abstemious, and confined
Thy base inordinate desires; thy meat
Had proved delightful, and thy comforts great;
But now, unhappy now, thy crimes have made
Thy Soul Deaths debtor, and thou art betrayed
By thine own self; therefore prepare to meet
Thy wrathful Judge: it is said, stolen goods are sweet;
But thine proud sour* the fruits which thou have stole
Sugared thy mouth, but wormwoodiz'd thy Soul;
When thou had eaten, Ah! why did thou ^o^
Tremble to death, to think thou had forgot
Thy Gods Commands, and that his Judgments must
Follow thy Soul, and blow thee into dust?
Thus ^iv^* thus Adam, having vilipended
Their Gods Commands, their happiness soon ended;
Their joys were turned to mourning, and their light
Was turned to darkness, and their day to night:
Both being too much conscious, fled with speed
To hide themselves from God, but not the deed.
Even as some poor distressed wretch desires
To hide himself from the enraged fires
Of his incensed Foe, runs up and down
To shun the rage of a condemning frown*
At last observing his enquiring Foe
Approach the place, lies still, and dares not blow,
For fear the wordless Echo of his breath
Should soon betray him to a sudden death:
Being at last discry'd, his throbbing heart
Gives an Alarm to each trembling part;
Fear, like an Earthquake, then begins to shake
His loos'ned joints, he knows not how to make
A ready answer to his foes demands;
But, as a sad convicted man, he stands
Subjected to his will, that can dispense
With nothing, but with death, to calm the offense.
Even so guilt-loaded Adam having done
A deed so foul, prepares himself to run
To some close shelter, where he might immure
His naked body, and repose secure:
But ah, in vain, in vain he strove to hide
Himself from God, that need implore no guide
To teach him where his sad offender lay;
He needs must find, when sin has chalked the way:
But when Heavens shril-enquiring voice surrounded
The ears of Adam, Adam was confounded
With deep distress, his heart began to call
His quivering Senses to a Funeral:
Fear, like a powerful fire, began to thaw
His frozen thoughts, and keep his soul in awe;
He breathed in a Dilemma, and could find
No Sanctuary for a perjured mind:
At last the language of the eternal God
Stormed his sin-armed soul, and like a Rod
VVhip^ him from his security; and cried,
Adam, where art thou? Adam thus replied,
I heard thee walking in the pleasing shade
Of the cool evening, and I was afraid,
And hid my self, because I must confess,
I blushed to see my shameful nakedness.
GOD.
Tell me, thou trembling wretch, how do thou know
That thou art naked? say, who told thee so?
that? has thy lips usurped the fruit which I
^^njur'd thee not to touch? if so, reply.
Adam.
The woman which thou gav'st me, gave to me,
^^d I did eat of the forbidden tree.
GOD.
Unconstant woman! Ah, why have thou ru^
^^^ond thy bounds? what is this that thou have done?
Woman.
^he Serpents flowing language swelled too great
(...) my low banks: he tempted, and I eat.
Gods Curse against the Serpent.
Because thou have thus subtly deluded
(...) lustful woman, thou shall be excluded
^^^m future good; more shall thy curses yield
^^^n all the beasts and cattle in the field*
(...) belly shall (because thou have done this)
^^^e to the earth a life-remaiming kiss;
^^^u shall not taste of any thing that is good,
^^^t shall supply the place of wholesome food.
(...) be thy ways, thou shall no more be seen
^^me: I will put enmity between
Thy seed and her^; hereafter thou shall feel
A bruised head* and she a bruised heel.
Gods Curse against the woman.
And as for thee, oh woman, I Will enlarge
Thy grief, and thy conception; I Will discharge
Thy joys, and load thee with a weighty grief;
Thy pains in childbed shall find no relief:
Thou shall desire thy husband, and his hand
Shall overruled thee with a strict command.
Adams Curse.
Rebellious Adam, unto thee I Will give
A life as bad as death, for thou shall live
To see thy sorrows more and more abound,
And for thy sake I Will curse the loathed ground;
For thou have hark'ned to the conquering voice
Of thy frail wife, and made my fruit thy choice,
And sepulchred my words within the grave
Of thy false heart; be gone, thou self-made slave:
The thorny ground shall give a large increase
To thy laborious hand; the name of Peace
Shall prove a stranger to thy ears, and thou
Shall eat thy bread with a sweat-dropping brow.
I Will murder all thy joys; thy breast shall burn
With flaming care, until thy corpse return
Into the bowels of th'inclusive earth,
From whence thou had thy substance, and thy birth*
For base thou art, and therefore thou shall be
A food for gnawing worms, and not for me:
As thou art dust, to dust thou shall ^etire;
Hereafter let not dust presume t'^spire.
Strange alteration! Oh pernicious Fate!
Too quickly bred in such an infant* state!
He that but even now enjoyed a life
Balanced with pleasures, now is ^ll'd with strife*
He, whose majestic Soul was lat^ly crowned
With blessed content, is now ingulf'd, and drowned
In sorrows Ocean; He which was before
Enriched with happiness, is n^w as poor
As poverty can make him* He* which ^ad
The countenance of H^av'n to m^k^ him glad,
Is now eclipst; he knows not where to run,
Sin having interposed between the Sun
And his dark Soul, the Center of whose rest
Is now removed, and he survives unblest:
He, which but even now had leave to dwell
And revel in Heavens eye, desires a Cell
To entertain him; he, which lived in Peace,
Is now thrown down, and forfeited his lease:
Great was his Crime, great was his sudden Fall,
Great was his Tenement, his rent but small:
Poor Adam's taken by his own decoys;
Sin is the Sequestrator of all joys.
Sad Pilgrim of the world, where will thou find
(In the unpathed earth) a place so kind
To entertain thee? Ah, where will thou keep
(Thus tumbled from a Precepes so steep)
Thy sad unpeopl'd randezvouz? Oh where
VVilt thou procure a hand that will unsnare
Th'intangled Soul? Alas, thy wearied life
Has two most sad companions; first a Wife,
Then a bad Conscience; what two greater crosses
Can hang upon a breast, whose cares, whose losses,
Are grown so infinite, that no relief,
But what distills from Heaven, can ease their grief?
Thou were the first of men that entertained
So grand a sorrow, thou the first that stained
So pure a color, thou the first that dwelt
In Edens garden, thou the first that felt
The scourge of fury; had not thou transgrest,
Vengeance had found no hand, nor grief a breast.
Ah, had not thou offended, sin had found
No habitation, nor thy Soul a wound:
Had not thy hand so wilfully unlocked
The door of Death, Destruction had not knocked
At thine impenitrable gates, or ventured
T'approach so near, but being opened, entered.
Bold Customer of fate, that sought about
To come within, and turn poor Adam out;
Thy strength outstrengthd his strength, and made him weak;
A vessel cracked, how can it choose but leak?
Sin proved Deaths father, and man's heart the womb
That brought it forth; this death shall find a tomb
When the Determiner of time has hurled
A finis to the volume of the world;
Till then, man (mortaliz'd by sin) must be
A subject unto Deaths Soveraigntie.
Poor man, in what a wilderness of sorrow
Do thou now ramble in* where will thou borrow
A minutes rest? On what inclining ear
VVilt thou expend thy groans? what can thou hear
But dialects of misery to vex
Thy bankrupt thoughts? The fatal disrespects
Of Heaven will blow and toss thee up and down
From place to place, his still-renewed frown
Will follow thee; therefore provide to endure
The hot pursutes of such a fierce pursuer.
Can thou expect that this thy grand abuse
(Which runs beyond the limits of excuse)
Can be forgotten? Do thou think t'out-live
Thy long-lived crimes, or hope for power to give
Due satisfaction to thy God, whose rage
Thy heart cannot endure, much less assuage?
Most lachrymable state! What can thou do,
Oa man, that may ingratiate or renew
Thy formor love? Alas, thy base condition
M^^^s the^ ^^capable of a Petition:
Prepare thy self, see if thou can invade
His Soul with prayers* see if thou can persuade
His ^eart to yield unto thy sad request,
And ^^inth one thee with thy former rest;
D^^^^ct thy Soul with groans, anatomize
Thy heart with sighs, and let thy winged cries
Fly through the angles of his sacred ear,
And breed a harmony within the sphere
Of his blessed Soul; be circumspect, and lay
The best foundation; hear what Heaven will say.
Adams Petition to God.
Incensed Father of eternal light
Permit a darkened Soul t'approach the sight
Of thine incomparable eye; unmask
Thy anger* clouded Soul, and let me ask
Forgiveness for those loading Crimes which press
My stagg^ing Soul; I know not whom t'address
My apostare self unto, but only thee,
Whom I offended; Please to pity me:
I have no pleasing Sacrifice t'attone
Thy wrathful Breast, except a hearty groan
That Is quadrupl'd with grief; Oh deign to look
Upon the lines of my all-blotted book:
Although I Am full of most detested spots,
Yet Lord, I know that thou can read my blots;
Oh read them then, and let thy mercies run
With thy progressive eye; I am undone,
If not forgiven; Lord, I thee implore
To show some mercy to me, thou have store.
Discipher all my sins, and let them not
B^ar record in thy rouls, but rest forgot:
Revoke this act of Death, that I may sing
Th'admired mercies of so blessed a King.
Oh lift me up, that now am thrown below;
Make not my Soul the Custom-house of woe.
Oh hear these bitter groans that I have spent,
And send some comfort from thy Parliament.
Gods Reply.
Thou skelleton of baseness, hie thee hence,
Disturb me not; return, I say, from whence
Thou came at first; thou shall as soon remove
A mountain, as my mind: I cannot love,
No nor I will not, nothing shall entreat
My resolutions, for my fury's great.
Begone, proud Rebel, do not think thy prayers,
Thy vows, thy groans, thy sighs, thy sobs, thy tears,
Shall make my breast their receptacle; No;
How can I be a friend to such a foe?
Surcease thy importunities, let fall
Thy high desires, I will not hear thee call,
Thy sins have barred my ears; I Will not be won
With thy base airy words, for thou have spun
The thread of thy destruction, therefore wear
What thou have labored for, and so forbear
T'intrench upon my patience; it is in vain
To seek for that which thou shall not obtain.
And is it thus, that Heaven will not regard
My cries? Ah me! and must my groans be heard
With disrespect by him, whose tongue affords
Nothing but grief, involved with bitter words?
Alas, alas! what greater woe can crowd
Into a breast, then to be disavow'd
By Gods high Voice, whose most enraged breath
Darts forth the arrows of eternal death?
What shall I do? Oh, whither shall I run
To hide my self, until the glorious Sun
Of his affections usher in the day
Of welcome Joy? Oh, whither shall I stray?
If I am silent, then my silence turns
My thoughts to fire; If speak, my speech returns
Trebbl'd with woe, into the brazen Tower
Of my sad heart, my language has no power
To work upon his ears, my words
Banded, and thrown against th'obdurate walls (like balls
Unyielding breast) bounds back again, and breaks
Into my heart, and every sorrow speaks
A volume at a word; yet, yet must I
Return unheard; it is misery to dye,
And pain to live; thus in despair I draw
The loathsome air: Destruction knows no Law.
Grief rains a flood of doubt into my Soul;
Ah me! I can do nothing but condole*
I am despised; and if I bend the force
Of my desires to him, he will divorce
All thoughts of pity, and with rage re-double
Th'unsum'd up sums of my infringing trouble.
I sail into the Straits, both wind and tide
Prevail against me, and I have no guide
To pilate me unto the longed-for Port
Of pleasing happiness; I am a sport
To threatening Ruin, whose presumptuous waves
Out-dares my Soul, whilst every blast enslaves
My reeling Pinnace: If I strive to go
Toward Scylla, Scylla will contemn my woe.
Alas, in vain I can expect relief,
Scylla will bark at my unbridled grief;
Or if my headlong vessel chance to hit
Against Charybdis; I am torn and split
Into ten thousand pieces: Oh hard hap!
Thus am I tossed in Destructions lap.
Where shall I find a heart that will advise
My friendless Soul, and audiate my cries?
I will not thus desist, I must implore,
He that is lost once, sure can be lost no more.
Adams Petition to God.
Once more, thou Metropolitan of all
The spacious world, I here presume to call
Upon thy mercy; Oh let me inherit
The pleasing fruits of thy re-pleased Spirit!
I am thy fabric, oh some pity take,
Preserve the building for the Builders sake.
Clothe not thy brow with frowns, but let thine eye
(That rests inshrin'd with glorious Majesty)
Reflect upon my sorrows; Oh incline
Thy willing ears to hear this grief of mine:
Oh do not say I shall as soon remove
A mountain as thy heart, thou can not love;
Let not such harsh, embittered language flow
Out of a mouth so sweet; I know, I know,
Thou art as good as great; oh therefore bow
Thy sacred ears to hear, oh hear me now:
Bestow some scraps on me, that have deserved
Nothing but stripes; for I have fondly swerved
From thy Commands, and have committed treason
Against thy Majesty: Great God of Reason,
View my in-humbled Soul, see how it lies
Before thy sight, a weeping Sacrifice.
I know thou know I am a heinous sinner,
Yet pity me, that am a young beginner
In this rich art of begging: Do not slight
My real prayers; I know thou take delight
In being merciful; oh let me not
Return unanswered, or my prayers forgot:
Oh hear the sorrows of my bleeding state,
Let my complaints make thee compassionate,
And let the fervor of my language turn
Thy thoughts to pity; quench these flames that burn
My wasting Soul; speak peace to me, that find
A civil war in my uncivil mind:
Oh I have tasted of thy hot displeasure
Too much; Ah, shall thy vengeance know no measure ^
Say it is enough; though ( Lord) I must confess
I have deserved more, yet give me less.
Thus with a melting heart I end my Suit
Ah me! how bitter is forbidden fruit!
Gods Reply
Thou bold faced Orator, how dare thou come
Before me, or be otherwise then dumb?
Tell me, how dat'st thou interrupt my breast?
I hate to see thee, or hear thy Request.
Audacious wretch, what, has my Judgments made
Thy heart grow peremptory? Have I laid
Too small a burden on thee? If I have,
I Will lay a greater, thou apostate slave:
I will not note thee, nor I will not hear
Thy words, which have usurped my deafned ear.
Love thee, for what? be it known, sad wretch, I scorn
To love a thing so base, so vile, forlorn;
And if I cannot love, how can it be,
That I can pity such a worm as thee?
I Will neither love, nor pity, for my heart
Is adamantine; thou shall feel the smart
Of my displeasure: Go, my Soul disdains
To look upon thee; thou art filled with stains*
And smel'st too much of fruit to find respect*
Thou art the subject of my great neglect:
Thou art a barren soil, nothing will grow
Upon thy heart, except the seeds of woe.
Tell me, from what conceit do thou derive
Thy working confidence, that thou dare drive
Thy language to my ears, and be so bold
T'approach my sight, and wilt not be controlled?
Art thou resolved to make (what do thou mean)
My ears thy stage, and every word a scean?
Sum up thy small, thy weak deserts, and see
What large respects thou have deserved from me.
I placed thee in a garden, not to eat
The ^^uit forbidden, but to keep it neat!
Had not the violation of my Laws
Moved me to anger, thou had had no cause
T'ave felt the burden of my weighty stroke,
Or live thus much subjected to the yoke
Of thine own sins; most shameful is that loss
That Is crowned with negligence, and great the cross
That Is made with a self-hand; and they that clime
Above their strengths, impropriate a crime
To their own Souls; Destruction is the end
Of all Rebellion: Ruin knows no friend.
Suppose I should invest and entertain
Your Soul with love, and call thee back again,
The tree is still the same, the fruit as sweet,
Thy appetite as great, and thou may meet
A Serpent too, whose oratorious skill
May soon entreat thee to enact his will:
He has a voice to tempt, and thou an ear
Will reassume the privilege to hear;
He has a hand to give, and thou another
Freely to take: thus would thou quickly smother
Thy new delights; therefore I will not trust
A heart that can be nothing but unjust.
Thou great Mugul of baseness, cease to plead,
Thy tongue's a canker, and thy words are lead;
Thy sins have made thee not deserve the air
Thou entertain^st had than implay'd thy care
To serve me, when I loved thee, thou had had
My heart-delighting joys to make thee glad;
But now expect no favor, for no art
Of thine shall ever captivate my heart.
Hie thee unto the shades of grief, bewail
Thy sequestrated happiness, no bail
Of thy procuring will I take to set
Thy Soul at liberty; I will not let
The vision of a comfort creep within
Thy rambling thoughts, thou art a slave to sin:
Had thou but loved or feared me at the first,
Thou Had been as happy, as thou art now accursed:
If now thou love me, I shall quickly prove
It is for fear alone, and not for love*
Thy heart is steeled with wickedness, thy faults
Are sparks enlivened by thy flinty thoughts.
Breathe out thy groans unto a senseless rock,
And let thy sighs (like hammers) beat and knock
Against her scragged sides, thou shall as soon
Have her consent, as mine, to grant thy boon:
It Is therefore vain to multiply thy words,
For ah, my breast, my hardened breast, affords
Thy Soul no pity; and the more thy cry
Attempts my ear, the less I will reply.
Alas! thy guilt-o're-burth'ned words renew
Fresh thoughts of rage, I cannot hear thee sue
Without impatiency; for ah, the longer
Thou crav'st, thou make my fury grow the stronger.
Avoid my presence, for I will no more
Give audience to thy voice, then cease t'implore.
Adams Lamentation.
Undone, undone ^ what mountain now will hide
My lothed body from the swelling tide
Of raging Vengeance? Whither shall I fly
T'involve my Soul with true security?
Stretch, stretch my lungs, and roar unto the deep
To entertain me: Oh that I might sleep
Within her wavey bowels, till the blast
Of Heavens all-shaking, thundering Voice were past.
Oh that some rock would hear my sad request,
And give me burial in her frigid breast!
Oh that my grief-extended voice could cleave
The solid Earth, and make her to receive
My wretched limbs! Oh that some ranging beast
Would prove so courteous to devour, and feast
Upon my corpse! Oh that I could contrive
A way to live, and yet not be alive!
Ah, thus my sorrow-shaken fancy flies
And envies at impossibilities.
I fain would dye, but that I have no heart
To kill my self, and yet I feel a smart
Transcending death; I see I cannot shun
The wrath of Heaven: Ah, thus am I undone
By my own doing; this it is to eat
Forbidden fruit: Oh most pernicious meat!
I was too rash, and rashly have I taken
A deadly fall, and falling, am forsaken:
I Am bruised to death, and yet I cannot dye;
Ah, what can be so much unblest as I?
I am inflamed, and I daily drench
My Soul with tears, and yet I cannot quench
My raging fires; the more I strive t'ass wage
And mitigate my pains, the more they rage.
What shall I do, or whither shall I go,
To hide me from this Labyrinth of Woe?
I am composed of sorrow, and my veins,
Instead of blood, are filled with griping pains.
Cursed be these eyes of mine, which have let in
The lawless Tyrant of imperious Sin:
Cursed be these lips of mine, which at the suit
Of my fond wife received forbidden fruit:
Cursed be these ears, that entertained the charms
Of that inchantress, which procured my harms:
Cursed be these hands of mine, which took, and fed
My greedy Soul, and struck my Conscience dead:
And now my lips, my ears, my hands, my eyes,
Must see, hear, taste, and feel, my miseries.
Oh sad condition! Since there is no relief,
I must be subject to perpetual grief.
Here we will leave poor Adam in the state
Of woe, and thus begin to ruminate.
Are there not many in this tollsom age
That meditate themselves into a rage,
And wonder how a Serpent could express
Himself, and reason with such readiness,
Being by nature brute, nay and the worst
Of living creatures, that he should at first
Persuade and conquer, and instruct his will,
How to determine both of good and ill?
It would seem strange, if Reason were without
Her wings, and could not fly above this doubt:
We may (and yet not stain the truth) declare
It was the work of Satan to ensnare
Frail Eve; although he was not named at all
By Moses in the History of the Fall,
It may not trouble us; for we must know,
The bending Serpent was the Devils bow,
By which he shot the arrows of his spite,
Which did [Oh grief to speak it,] fly too right:
And he that dares so high a Crime to act
(Though by another) needs must own the fact:
And this our tongues may never cease to tell,
The Serpent was the Instrument of Hell,
Tuned to the Devils voice: thus we may see
His fraud, his malice, and his subtlety.
First when he saw he could not over-turn
The great Creator, he begun to burn
With flames of envy, laboring to invade,
And so disturb that order God had made
In the Creation, and to change the features
Of his own Image in the best of Creatures,
That so he may by his too-sooth delusion
Make man run headlong to his own confusion:
Thus having laid the platform of his work,
He then begun to agitate, and lurk
For opportunity, which was effected
As soon, nay if not sooner, then expected;
He gave the blow, and by that blow he found
The weakest vessel had the weakest sound;
But yet it strongly echoed to the voice
Of his desires, and made him love his choice.
Even as some bold-fac'd General, that dares
To storm a well-man'd Town; at first prepares
A potent Army, which he soon sets down
Before the Walls of the alarmed Town;
He after views the ruine-threatning-Fort,
Which speaks defiance, and begins to sport
Their several shots, and with a sad delight
Engage each other in a bloody fight:
Then if the fierce Besiegers once perceive
Themselves out-strength'd, they think it fit to leave
So hot a work, and for a little space
Desist, and fall upon a weaker place,
Where finding smaller opposition, venture
With greater courage, and at last they enter
The yielding Town, and cruelly begin
To take revenge of them that are within.
Even so the grim-look'd, malice-armed Devil,
The base-resolved General of Evil,
Perceiving that he could by no means take
The sublime Fort of Heaven, plots how to make
A fresh attempt upon a weaker part,
And so prepares to storm the flexive heart
Of unresisting Eve, that could not grapple
With such a Foe, but yielded for an Apple
To those most false Alarums which surrounded
Her, much obedient, and soon confounded
Her inward parts, and gave her Soul a wound,
Which cannot be by time or art made sound,
Except the grand Physician please to slake
His swelling fury, and some pity take.
Thus are our conquered parents sadly left
In a deplored condition, and bereft
Of all their comforts; they which have enjoyed
The life of happiness, are now destroyed;
And man (his wretched offspring) must be made
Sorrows sad heir, and Peace must not be said
T'inhabit in him: Adams actual sin
Made ours original; for we begin,
As soon as made, to entertain the guests
Of Sin, and lodge them in our infant-brests.
Now may our weak and despicable eyes
Behold in them our ample miseries*
Now we may glut the Air with this sad cry,
The root being dead, the branches needs must dye;
For Adam's gone beyond all humane call:
Rebellion never ends without a Fall.
But stay my Muse, here let us rest a while;
Our Journey's long, and it is not good to toil
Too much at first; for Reason says it is best
To pause a time, and take a little rest:
Know then (kind Reader) that my Muse shall meet
Thy serious eyes within another sheet.
The end of the first Book.
THE SECOND BOOK OF GODS LOVE, AND Man's Unworthiness.
ARe all hopes fled? and is there no relief?
Must man still wander in the shades of grief?
Will not the eye of Heaven be pleased to shine
Upon his Soul, but leave him in the brine
Of his own sins? Is there no warbling voice
Can charm his ears, and woo him to rejoice
In being pitiful? Will nothing move
The much incensed Soul of Heaven to love?
Man [Map of Misery] who can prevail
In thy requests? or who cut off th'entail
Of thy distress? It Is not a writ of Error
Can satisfy, or guard thee from the terror
Of thine own Conscience, which will always stare
Upon thy face, and load thee with despair.
It Is not a Habeas Corpus will remove
The body of thy sin, none can disprove
The Will of God, what he resolves to do
Must neither be withstood, nor dived into:
It lies beyond thy power to persuade
Thy God to pity, whom thy sins have made
A wrathful Judge; what he intends, must be
Derived from himself, and not from thee;
For thou have nothing in thee worth the name
Of good, because thy glory's turned to shame:
Thou art corrupt and vile in every part
And who can know the evil of thy heart?
Which like the Ocean, that no art nor eye
Can search her bottom, or her banks disery:
Therefore till heaven shall please to change the s^^
Of thy condition; Reason bids thee wait:
For be assured, the promised seed will spread
It self abroad, and bruise the Serpents head.
Even as the Fountain, whose exuberous breast
Is always fluent, and admits no rest;
But with a cheerful willingness she sends
Her crystal tokens to her smaller friends:
Even so our God distilleth from above
The healing streams of his refreshing love;
For ah the luster of his Sun-bright eye
Is drowned in tears, when our sad Souls prove dry!
Oh admiration! that a God so just
Should rain down floods upon a heap of dust!
Oh Mercy! that so much incensed a God
Should send forth Mercy, and keep in his Rod!
His Soul is fili'd with pity, and his eyes
Begin to view th'unsatiate miseries
Of Adams down-cast offspring: Though his ear
Seems unto us resolved not to hear
Their bitter cries, nor note the sad Devotions
Of their contristed hearts; yet by the Motions
Of his blessed Soul, he sends his Son and Heir
Into this wretched world, that he might bear
The Cross of our Transgressions, and expel
The clouds of sin, and conquer Death and Hell:
Thus by his death we lived, and by his grief
Our new-calm'd Souls were furnished with relief*
Oh sudden change! That wind which did before
Drive wretched man upon the threatening shore
Of un^voyding ruin, fills the ^ails
Of his desires with mild and prosperous gales;
The Boreas of his sin does now surcease
His full mouthed blasts, and Z^phyr^^ spea^s peace
Unto his ship-wrack'd Soul, and now he rides
Upon the new-tam'd backs of pleasing Tides.
Oh that my tongue were able to rehearse
The Love of God with an Angelike Verse,
Oh that some heavenly diety would fill
The black-mouthed concave of my wandering quill
With pure celestial Ink, that I might write
In heavenly characters, and learn t'indite
I ch^^ahs praises in a style as high
As my desires, and make the lofty Sky
Echo with Hallelujahs, that the Earth
May (like a Midwife) hug the joyful birth
Of every word, and make each corner ring
(With peals of Joy) the Glories of our King:
Is man delivered from the painful womb
Of his foul sin, and raised from the tomb
Of everlasting death? and shall not we
Applaud that hand which set such prisoners free?
What, shall we be afraid to ^rack and break
The chains of silence, and attempt to speak
The dialects of Angels? No; let us call
Upon his name, that raised us from a Fall.
Let Us stretch our lungs, and with a warbling breath
Sing to the life, how we were raised from death:
And when our tongues are wearied, let us express
By heavenly signs our real thankfulness.
But stay, where runs my quill? what, have I lost
My self in raptures? or else am I tossed
Into the air of pleasure by the wind
Of true delight? If Passion proves so kind,
I am content, oh may I always rest
Adorned and crowned with a Heav'n-ravish'd breast:
O love ineffable! Must wretched Man,
The spawn of baseness, and the unmeasured span
^f everlasting infancy, be made
Loves object? Must the Almighty's love be said
To dwell in Man, whose tongue cannot deliver
The least of thanks unto so great a Giver?
Will the Sun-gazing Eagle, that soars high.
Descend t'assist the web-infolded Fly?
Will he that ^arkens with a willing ear
To pleasing music, turn away to hear
Confounding discords? or will any woo
A perju^'d enemy to come and go
Into his Courts? Will any hand forbear
To strike at him that labors to impair
His worth, and contumeliously upbraid
His upright deeds? Will he that is betrayed
Affect the Traitor, and with patience sue
For reconcilement, when as death is due?
All this blessed Heaven will do, that he might place
Vain man within the Covenant of Grace.
Consider man, how often has this mirror
Of pure affection wooed thee from thine error?
Thou unconsiderate dust, which every wind
Can puff away, how can thou prove unkind
To such a Lover, that delights to spin
His bowels out, to nourish thee with in
His milky bosom? Shall his bounty crave
Thy base acceptance? Shall he be a slave
To his own slaves? Ah, shall thy God implore,
And beg of beggars to receive his store?
Does he, whom Heaven and Earth cannot contain,
No no^ the heaven of heavens, stoop down to gain
Thy dull respects? And ah, will thou not raise
Thy stupid Soul an inch to give him praise?
Thy fervent prayers he always will admit,
Then how can thou remember to forget
A God so mindful? How can thou forbear
To numerate his love without a tear?
How can thine eyes (when thou observ'st the Sun)
Refuse to weep to see him daily run
His painful progress, and rejoice to greet
The Earth with luster to direct thy feet,
Thy sinful feet, which every moment slide
Into Rebellion, loaded with thy pride?
How can thou choose, when thou behold'st the ground
Whereon thou tread'st, but voluntary drowned
Thy self in briny floods, to think what care
Indulgent Heaven has taken to prepare
For thee, before thou were, and how his hand
Has for thy profit fertiliz'd the Land?
How can thy rocky heart refuse to vent
A stream of blood, when thou behold'st the extent
Of the unbounded Ocean, how it hides,
Within the bosom of her swelling Tides,
Diversities of fish, which live to feed
Thy gulf of gluttony at time of need?
Uncloud thy thoughts ( O Man) and thou shall see
He who ordained all these things for thee,
Created thee for him, that thou may give
The praise to him, that lends thee leave to live.
Be serious Man, consider how thou have
Converted all these blessings into waste:
Know that the great Edificer of things
Furnished thy Soul with Reason, gave thee wings
To fly above all mortals, and has crowned
Thy head with he^ps of honor, and has bound
Inferior creatures prentice to thy will;
And this he did, because thou should fulfill
Thy Gods Commands; but thou that were the best
Have made thy self more loathsome then the rest,
And by thy most detested deviation
Abused the glory of thy free Creation:
Though the Majestic Eagles will despise
To be assistants to th*intangled Flies;
Yet Heaven will from his lofty Throne deseend,
And with a speedy cheerfulness defend
The sons of men, who daily are betrayed
By those insiduous snares which Satan laid
T'intrap their Souls: Alas, how void of care
Is heedless man! how subject to a snare!
But he, whose more then superficial love
Is always active, laboring to improve
Our hearts with thankfulness, denies to let
Our Souls be taken in the eternal net
Of unconceived misery, and live
In lasting death, not having power to give
The least of drops unto our howling tongues,
But uck the flames, until our sulphurous lungs
Crackle, and belch* forth brimstone, till we tire
Our Carbonado'd members in a fire
That Is inextinct; the more we strive to turn
Our parched Souls, still more and more they burn.
Revolve these things within thy serious mind;
Oh Man, let Love instruct thee to be kind
To him that is loving; do not disrespect
A God, whose Soul so dearly can affect:
Pour out thy thoughts, and practice to relent,
And let thy thoughts induce thee to repent:
Grasp opportunity, Time's always flying;
God's always living, and thou always dying:
Die then; before thou dy'st, redeem the time,
Because thy days are evil; learn to clime
Jacobs erected ladder; thou shall see
Thou Had better clime a Ladder, then a Tree,
As Judas did: Be wise, and do not fan
Thy Soul with air; remember what a span
Thou art; remember whose inspired breath
Made thee a Soul; forget not whose sad death
Made thee alive; be mindful that thou art
Th'Epitomy of Heaven; inure thy heart
To love the best of loves, so shall thy breast
Be filled with comfort, and thy Soul with rest:
Prepare and know, the very fowls delight
To prune their wings before they take their flight.
Although terrestial Kings will not permit
A Traitor to his Courts, no^ let him sit
Before his presence, though they will not hear
A Malefactors prayers; yet Heavens blessed ear
Is always open, and his tongue invites
Repentant sinners, for his eye delights
To view them in his Courts when they appear;
For muddy waters may at last prove clear:
It Is not unlike; ill scented dunghils may
At last bear flowers; that which is foul to day,
To morrow may prove fair; the thing that cost
Millions of silver, may as well be lost,
As things of smaller value; Heaven can spy
A mite, as well as mountains; for his eye
Is lodged in every cranny of man's heart,
And he knows all that searches every part.
Where breathes that Mortal that can apprehend
The ways and thoughts of God, who knows the end
Of his beginning? -- --
He that can break a rocky heart in twain,
And reunite it (if he please) again;
He that can part the boiling waves, and stand
Upon the Seas, as on the dryest Land;
He whose celestial power can make the graves
To open, and command their slumb^ring slaves
To rise; nay more, to stand; nay more, to walk;
Nay more (if more then this may be) to talk:
He that can make a Whale to entertain
A Jonah, and to sp^e him out again;
He whose Almighty Power can unlock
The flinty bowels of a ser^gged Rock,
And make her headlong-gushing streams abound
To wash the bosom of the thirsty ground;
He that can transmutate by power divine
The poorest water into richest wine;
He that can curb rude Boreas, and assuage
The lawless passion of the Oceans rage;
He that can rain down Manna to supply
The craving stomachs of mortality;
He that can, like an all-commanding God,
Make Almonds flourish from a sapless rod;
He that can make the Sun and Moon stand still,
Or run according to his sacred Will;
He that saved a Daniel from the paws
Of Lions, and can muzzle up their jaws;
He that can make the greedy Ravens carry
Food to his Servants like a Commissary;
He that can, with an unresisted hand,
Dash fire into Ice, and counter-mand
The wanton flames, and charm them, that they dare
But burn his servants cords, and not their hair;
He that can cause ten thousand to be fed
With two small fishes, and five loaves of bread;
He that can clothe himself with fire, and name
Himself, I AM, and make a bush to flame
Without consuming; He that can convert
A Rod into a Serpent, and not hurt;
He that can make his visage shine so bright,
That not a Moses can behold the light;
He that can strike a hand with leprosy,
And cure it in the twinkling of an eye;
He that can in a moment cut and break
Tongue tying cords, and make the dumb to speak*
He that can out of unregarded stones
Raise unto Abraham many little ones;
He that can heal the Cripple with a touch,
And free him from the thraldom of his Crouch;
He that can cure the deaf, and can expel
A thousand Devils in despite of Hell;
He that can perfect what he first begun,
Expects that man should say* Thy will be done.
Consider Man and thou shall find it true*
(...) can do all, but what he will not do:
Think not, because thou art of low estate,
That he will scorn to love, and love to hate:
Remember Dives, whose unsum'd up store
Improved so much, until he proved as poor
As ever Job was: Job! unhappy I
To speak it, he was rich in poverty;
Hea^'n made poor Job so rich, that Satan's wealth
^^uld purcha^^ nothing from him, but his health,
And that corporeal too; he could not boast
His bargain, for 'twas Job that purchased most.
"Happy is he that can at last inherit
"Riches obtained by an impov'rish'd spirit:
"We'd better lick with Lazarus the crumbs,
"Then gripe with Dives for Soul-damning sums.
Wealth cannot bride the flames, yet scraps may feed
The hungry wretch; he that has wealth, may need
The crumbs of comfort: David did condole
Th'abundant famine of his hungry Soul:
Gods Love's not mercenary, to be sold
For brain-distracting, heart-confounding gold.
Have thou not heard ( O Man) the heavenly cry
Of him that says, Ye that are poor, come buy,
Come buy of me; your pen'worth shall be such,
That for a little you shall purchase much.
Here Is Love that is spun unto the smallest thread.
Tho thou want money, yet thou ma^^ have bred*
Do thou but ask, thou shall not fail to have;
For God's more free to give, then thou to crave:
Fear not to ask of him, whose ready ear,
Before thy tongue can ask, is apt to hear.
Heaven loves the language of a broken heart,
And he will harken, and with joy impart
His love unto thee, and his milk and wine,
Without the price of money, shall be thine.
Th'ingrated prisoner, whose dull tongue is whet
With sharp'ned hunger, will not fear to let
His language fly to every ear that comes
Within his audience; and he always sums
The totals of his grief in hungry words,
Whilst thousands pass along, but few affords
The blessing of an Alms; perhaps they will grieve,
And seem to pity, but will not relieve:
Yet will he not desist, but hourly cry,
Bread, bread, for Heavens sake bread, or else I dye.
Hard hearred Man, why will thou not relent
To hear thy brother, almost hunger spent,
Craving thy succor? Where Is thy love become?
Because thou art deaf* ah! woldst thou have him du^b?
Or do thou think, because thy panch is filled,
He cannot hunger? He that first distilled
Those mercies on thy head, expects that thou
Should feed thy brother with a cheerful brow;
Say not thou can not give, thy treasure's light;
But let thy heart record the widows mite,
So H^a^'n will fill thy Cisterns to the brim,
And feed thy Soul, because thou have fed him.
Should the Grandfather of true Charity
Pass by thy gates, and here thee beg and cry,
And not relieve thee; should he slight thy prayrs,
And scorn to take a survey of thy tears;
Would thou not grieve, and pine thy self to dust,
And almost say thy God was much unjust
To turn away his ears from thy complaint,
And disrespect thy prayers* and let thee ^aint
For want of ^o^d? Ah* whither would thou ^ly
To feed thy famished Soul, should Heaven deny?
But ah he cannot, for his melting Soul
Is always free, and willing to condole
The sad conditions of distressed Man,
Who only strives to do, but what he can
To contradict him* yet he will hear our grief:
In multitudes of mercy lies relief.
When our impris'ned Souls peep through the
Of this corrupting Earth, our God delates
Himself unto us, and he sends us meat
From the rich storehouse of his lofty Seat;
He hears; and hearing, pities; pitying, sends;
And sending, blesses, and with blessing ends.
Even as the Sun, which every day surrounds
The sublime Globe, and pries into the bounds
Of this dark Center; lets his Beams reflect
Upon a molehill with as much respect
As on a Mountain; for his glorious Beams
Shine always with equivolent extremes.
Even so the great and powerful three in one,
That sits upon his all-inlight'ning Throne,
Does not deny to let his mercies crown
The poorest Peasant with as much renown
As the most stateliest Emperor; though he
Invests his body with more dignity,
Yet he is but earth, and must at last decay,
For Prince and Peasant go the self-same way;
Their earth must turn to earth, their Souls return
To him that gave them, or for ever burn;
There Is no distinction, one infused breath
Made them alike, and both must live in death,
Or everlasting life; both must commence
Divines in Heaven; there is no pre-eminence,
But all equality, all must express,
With equal Joy, their equal Happiness.
Rouse up dull Man, and let thy wak'ned Soul
Be vigilant; oh let thy thoughts enroul
The Love of God, engrave it in thy breast,
That his resounding tongue may read thee blessed.
O let thy sighs, like Pens, and let thy tears,
Like Ink, transcribe the Love, the indulgent cares
Of thy Creator, that himself may find
(Within the unblotted volume of thy mind)
Himself recorded, so will he embrace
Thy spotless Soul, and fill thee with his grace.
Incl^^^ thine cars, and let thy heart rejoice
To ^ear the strains of his harmonious voice;
Harken, and thou shall hear his Prophets sing
Th'admired Mercies of thy glorious King.
Thus says the great, and ever-living One, Isa.

That rules the Heavens, and governs Earth alone; 43.

Thus says the Lord, that takes delight to dwell 1.

Amongst his Saints, that formed Israel,
Created Jacob, Let thy sorrows slay
Out of thy breast, I have redeemed thee:
'Twas I that made thy clouded visage shine*
And called thee by my Name, for thou are mine.
I will be with thee, when thy feet shall wade 2

Through the waters; I will be thy aid:
I Will make thee walk through rivers, and the waves
Shall prove ambitious to become thy slaves:
And when thou walk through the raging fire,
The Unruly flames shall not presume to aspire,
Or kindle on thy garments. I alone 3

The Lord thy God, and Isreal's holy one,
And thy dear Savior, that was always true,
Gave Egypt, Seba, and Ethiopia too,
To ransom thee; for thou were my delight, 4

And always precious in my gracious sight:
Honors were heaped upon thee, and thou were
The tender love of my affecting heart;
Therefore even I, that am well pleased, will give
People for thy dear sake, that thou may live.
Fear not, for I am with thee, and I Will stand 5

In thy defense, and my all-grasping hand
Shall bring thy seed from the remotest places,
And fill thee with my satisfying graces.
My tongue shall call unto the North, and say 6

Unto the South, Give, and they shall obey;
Bring from a far my sons and daughters all,
Hear my loud voice, be active when I call.
I have created them, and I proclaim 7

They shall be called and honored by my Name.
I Will usher forth the bl^^d, and make them see
The splendent Glories of my Majestic:
I'l^ cu^^ the deaf, and make their hearts rejoice
To ^^a^ the (...) of my warbling voice.
Thus has our God untied the tongues, and broke
His Prophets lips; thus have his Prophets spoke:
And will thou be (O Man) so much obdure,
A^ not to credit him that will assure
Perpe^^al happiness? ^h^u can not ask
That which he cannot give; do but unmask
Thy sham^^ae*d Soul, that so thou may discry
(...) mercies with a faithful eye*
^^^^aut upon his p^omi^es, advise
With chine own thoughts, let Reason make thee wise
^^sp^ct thy self, weigh well t^ine own condition.
And thou shall find thou wa^t'st a good Physician
^o cure thy ^^aculat^d Soul Alas!
Thou a^^ like water stopped up in a glass,
So weakly fortily'd, and fene'd about,
That one weak knock soon le^^ the pris^ner out.
Vain lump of vanity, what can this ^irth
Afford thy thoughts more then a short^liv'd mirth?
A mirth that fills thee with deluding toys,
And like a Tyrant afterward destroys.
Dot'st thou on Earth? for what? because her pleasure
Can guild thy wanton eye? Because her treasure
Can cram thy bags? Because her Sirens song
Can ravish thee? Because her power can throng
Thy Soul with luxury? Because her charms
Can court thee with delight? Because her arms
can pleasingly embrace thee, and imbost
Thy heart with gold, and lull thee, when thou have lost
Thy self in sleep? Is this the little All
That this great world can boast of? Must we call
These things our pleasures? No, they will prove our cares,
Our golden fetters, and our silken sna^es:
These are the Ioys we love, these are the things
That makes us fly with our Icaria^ wings
Up to Ambitions Court, and there presume
To gaze so long, until our wa^en plume
Dissolve with heat, and like presumptuous slaves
Tumble our selves into the raging waves
Of speedy Ruin; Ruine's all that we
Must hope to obtain from Earths base trea^ur^^.
Lets scorn her wealth, and say, O Earth, thou art
A painted Mistress with a rotten heart:
Let Us hate to love, that we may love to hate
Th'unconstant glory of her sickle State.
Even as the subtle Crocodile prepares
Her slatt'ring heart, and eye-commanding tears,
To woo her prey to come within the power
Of her command* that so she may devour
With more facility, and make her Jaws
To execute by her tyrannike Laws.
Even so this World, whose Crocodile* like eyes
Are always slowing, wanting no supplies
Of gliding tears to wash the rugged faces
Of her designs with falsifying graces,
That so she may by her too smooth delusion
Make man the Author of his own confusion.
Frail slesh and blood, how can thou take delight
To love this world, that cannot give a mite
Of comfort to thee, but will still entrap,
And daily lull thee in her lustful lap:
She Will rock thy Soul to ruin, and she will spawn
Baseness into thee; she will deceive, and fawn
Upon thy heart, and with her gilded baits
She Will hook thy Soul unto the worst of Fates:
There Is nothing in her that deserves the name
Of constancy; her glory is her shame:
Smile at her tears, for every drop she vents
Harbors ten thousand thousand discontents:
Believe her not; but when she speaks the best,
Believe the worst; and if she promise rest,
Assure thy self of trouble; if she chance
To promise treasure, let thy thoughts advance
Above her promises, contemn her dross,
For what thou gain'st from her will be thy los^!
Let not her wealthy Donatives persuade
Thy heart t'accept; when once thou art betrayed
There Is no resistance: They that well advise
Before they act, deserve the name of wise:
But they that study in her frantic Schools
May prove her wise men; but Heavens outcast fools
Ask her the way to Bliss: Try if her skill
Can give directions, ask her if she will
Fill thee with blessed Eternity, conjure
Her helpless aid, see if she can assure
A safety to thee, ask her if she can
Prescribe a cure for a despairing Man;
Tell her thy Soul is sick, thou can not live
A minute longer; see if she can give
A Cordial to thee, see if she can heal
A broken heart; see if she can reveal
Celestial Joys unto thee, and impart
A heavenly comfort to thy grieved heart:
If so, cheer up, and prosecute thy mirth,
And say there is no other Heaven but Earth.
Do thus (sond Man; and thou s^ale quickly see
A bassl'd World, that cannot answer thee,
B^t must be silent, for she cannot plea^
For her own self; she knows she cannot lead
The way to Heaven, she is but a bad Director,
A base Reliever, and a worse Protector.
Thus shall thou make her envy swell and burst,
And, like the Basilisk, discovered first,
She needs must dye; but if she should discover
Thee first, farewell, thou art murthet'd by thy lover:
Then shall thou heat the Soul* amazing tone
Of him that sie^ on his immortal Throne,
Pronounce against thee at the dreadful day
Of thy accounts; thus shall thou hear him say:
Depart, ye cursed offsprings of a father
As cursed as you, avoid my sight, go gather
The fruits of your deserts; you have forgot
The God that made you, and I know ye not:
See if the world, within whose folding arms
You always slept, can quit thee from the harms
That must ensue; see if her slatt'ring power
Can shelter thee from the o'^^* flowing shower
Of my fast* dropping rage; see if her breast
Can entertain thee with eternal rest:
Begone, begone, my fury hates to see
Such Miscreants; had you remembered me,
I now had known you; had you made me eat
When I was forced to importune for meat,
I now would blessed you with celestial diet,
And crown your Souls with everlasting quiet,
Had you but quenched my raging th^^st, or gave
A single drop, that very drop should save
Your death-adjudged Souls, and you should ^up
Abundant comforts from my streaming cup:
Had you (sad sons of vengeance) but supplied
My nakedness with garments, when I cried
And called upon your charity to send
Relieve unto me, I had been your friend!
Or had your (more then marble) hearts relieved
M'impris'ned body, now ye had not grieved:
Had you, you world* affined Souls, addressed
Your selves unto me when I was oppressed
With lingering sickness, then I would have fed
Your Souls (which now are starved) with heavenly bread.
But since you have not done it unto those
Which I esteemed, ye'ave proved your selves my foes:
Therefore begone, let darkness be your lot,
Learn to remember that ye have forgot
My Mercies; go, and let my Judgments dwell
Within your guilty hearts; let black* mouthed Hell
Plague you with torments, let him always lash
Your hearts with flames, until ye howl, and gnash
Your teeth together; go, depart my sight,
And taste the fruits of everlasting night.
But as for you whose better deeds have found
Acceptance in my heart, ye shall be crowned
With unremoved happiness, because
Ye have obsequiously performed my Laws;
You fed my craving stomach, and you clothed
My naked body, and you have not loathed
To visit me; and when I was a stranger,
Ye took me in, and guarded me from danger;
Go then my Lambs, and let your Oratory
Proclaim the greatness of your Fathers glory:
Go revel in my Courts; no discontent
Shall breed a faction in my Parliament;
I Will pass an Act of Peace, and it shall be
Signed by the hand of my Eternity.
My tongue shall style you blessed, and my voice
Shall raise your Souls, and teach you to ^ejoyce*
Your unexcised pleasures shall abound
To infinite, your ravished hearts shall sound
The depth of my delights; all things shall move
Within the sphere of uncontrouled Love:
Be well assured, your pleasures shall be great;
Then fly from Judgment to my Mercies Seat,
And there rejoice with a triumphant mirth;
My Love shall live with them that hated Earth.
Obdurate Man, here, here thou may discry
Judgment and Mercy, one to terrify,
The other to persuade; and yet will thou
Prove adamantine, and refuse to bow
To thy Redeemer? Can thou ruminate
Upon his Love, and yet wilt not delate
Thy Soul unto him? Is thy brazen heart
Impenitrable? Will no flaming dart
Of true affection enter? Have thou vowed
To stop thy ^ars; Shall Mercy call aloud,
And thou not hear? Shall thundering Judgments rattle
About thy ears, and yet will thou imbattle
Against the Lord of Hosts? Will thou invoke
Perpetual Vengeance to intail a stroke
Upon thy stubborn heart? What, do thou think
Hell's void of flames, or that thy God will wink
At thine enormities? Go, rally all
Thy thoughts together, and discreetly fall
Into a serious study. -- --
-- -- -- Let thy mind
Be absolute, and really inclined
To meditation; contradict the rage
Of thine own passion: labor to. assuage
The fire of lust, that so thou may behold,
With more serenety, how manifold
His mercies are, that every day prevents
The sad incursions of depraved events.
Think but in what a most defamed condition
Thy Soul was in, before the grand Physician
Of Heaven and Earth spontaniously sent down
A balm from his own Gilliard to crown
The sons of grief: Think what he did endure,
Before his wounds had perfected thy cure.
Remember how undauntedly he stood,
And sweat himself into a Crimson flood
To ransom thee; remember how his woes
Were asperated by his raging foes;
Remember how his sacred temples wore
A spiny Crown; remember how it tore
His sublime Front; remember how they broached
His breast with Spears, and shamefully reproached
His spotless fame; remember how they nailed
His spreading hands, remember how they sealed
His Ivory w^lls, remember how they spawl'd
Upon his face, remember how they baw'ld
And banded at his Agony, whilst he
Proved patient Martyr to their tyranny;
Remember when he came unto the brink
O^ death, they gave him vinegar to drink*
Nay more (because they vowed to empty all
Their poys'ned malice out) they gave him Gall.
Oh bitter deed! oh most abhorred Crimes!
(Too nearly paralleld in these our times.)
Thus having put a period to their plots,
They thought it good to cast their hellish lots
For his (I dare not say mean) clothes; I know
They were our Saviors, to whose worth we ow
Perpetual thanks; 'twas his well finished breath
Redeemed our Souls from everlasting death.
Here Is Love (O Man) that does as far transcend
Thy thoughts as thy deserts, that Heaven should send
His Son and Heir to be incarnated*
And suffer death for thee, that were as dead
As sin could make thee; 'twas for thy offense
He died: Ah, how, how can thou recompense
Such high br^d Favors! Favors unexpected
Deserve to be embraced, and not neglected.
Do not (rash Soul) like Cleopatria, nurse
Imbosom'd vipers; blessings prove a curse,
If once abused; Ingratitude cuts off
Th'intail of Love; it is a shame to scoff
At Benefactors; after thou art fed,
Will thou contemn the hand that gave thee bread?
Would thou not love that friend that should bestow
A super^nuated crust, and show
Respect unto thee, when the ebbing Tide
Of Fortune runs so low, that thou may ride
Upon the sands of Poverty? Fond Man,
Strive to be grateful, study how to scan
The mercies of thy God; remember how
He feeds thy Soul with Manna; learn to bow
The Unruly thoughts; (with admiration) think
How often, and how much embittered drink
Thy Savior drank; with what a doleful cry
He begged of God to let that cup pass by;
But knowing that his pleasure must be done,
He proy'd himself his most obedient Son.
And will thou not (^^y wretch) drink one poor sup
Of bitter drink for him, that drank a cup
To sweeten thine; thou need'st not fear, or scorn
To taste, because Heavens sacred Unicorn
Has purged the waters, and they must be sweet,
Except they are reimpoys'ned by thy feet:
If so, what will thou do? where will thou find
An Antidote for an envenomed mind?
It is reported, if the Spider chance
To meet the obvious Toad, they will both advance
Then inward force, and mutually proclaim
An open War; brave combita^^s of Fame!
And having (...) their imbowel'd might,
Ma^ch boldly on, and both incensed, thy fight*
The Toad being heavy loaded, cannot go,
Or wheel about, like his encountering foe,
But keeps his ground, and makes a small resistance:
The Spider scorning to be kept at distance,
Falls in upon him, and with nimble rage
Assaults his foe, who now begins ^^asswage
His former fury, and would fain retreat
From his small foe, whose strength is grown too great
For opposition; being thus distressed
He crawls away, and with a crope-sick breast
Seeks for relief, and by and by discrys
A Planton leaf, within whose veins there lies
A secret Antidote, which did at length
Expel his poison and renew his strength:
Having disgorg'd himself, he soon returns
Into the camp, where for a time he burns
To be in action, and at last he sees
The crafty Spider creeping by degrees
To seize upon him, then his courage fails,
He knows not what to do, his foe assails
With all his might, constraining him to yield
The conquest, and with shame to quit the field:
Then he begins to seek, and hunt about,
To find the sovereign healing Planton out,
Which had before relieved him, and supplied
His wants; but that being gone, he burst, and died
Even so, if Hells black Spider chance to crawl
From his infernal Web into the Hall
Of this all-dusty World, he soon prepares
Himself to fight, and suddenly declares,
That he, the grim-look'd General of Hell,
Dares to encounter any Souls that dwell
Within the limits of the spacious Earth,
And in a moment qualify their mirth:
Thus Satan boasts, and if he chance to meet
A single Soul, he will thus begin to greet.
A DIALOGUE between the Soul and Satan.
Sat. SOul, thou art well met.


So. It Is true, for I am well.


Sat. Say, whither art thou going?


Sou. Not to Hell.


Sat. ^ish, talk no more of that, but tell me whither
Thou go; come, prithee let us go both together.

Sou. A pretty motion; when I want a guide
I Will send for thee, till then thou art denied
To be my Usher.

Sat. Prithee tell me why
Thou art so obstinate, as to deny
So free a courtesy as I have shown;
Mischance often falls to them that walk alone:
Be not so much averse as to neglect
This opportunity; I can protect
Thy feet from sliding; dangers still attend
Those that despise the favors of a friend.

Sou. A friend! how can thou prove that title?


Sat. How?
As thus; because I Am willing to allow
The best assistance of my ready arm
To guide, nay and protect thee from all harm;
Theresore a friend. So. What you pretend to show
Is but external; he that can bestow
Internal friendship on a Soul distressed
Is a true friend; no matter for the rest.
If Heaven will guide my Soul, I shall not stray,
Or sear the evils of a dangerous way:
But as for you, I needs must borrow leave
To say, your friendship's only to deceive;
Confusion paths your ways, and if I run
By your advise, I needs must be undone.
God bids me fly from sin, if I refuse
Obedience to his Will, I shall abuse
His just Commands; then will my sorrows cry,
When Mercy stops Judgment begins to fly.

Sat. Desist (fond Soul) and labor to divorce
Thy lips from this too fabulous discourse;
Guild not thy words with vanity, persuade
These thoughts (which ate erroneous) to evade
Thy serious mind; advise, and thou shall see
My ways are best be principl'd by me (...)
Let not the swing of passion strike thee down,
But follow me, it is I must give a Crown
To thy deserts, it is I that can advance
Thy down-cast Soul above the reach of chance;
It Is I (mistaken Soul) it is I alone
That must conduct thee to the sublime throne
Of true Salvation; it is my hand must bring
Thy trembling Soul before the all* judging King
Of Heaven and Earth; it is my power can fill
Thy heart with joy; believe me, and I will.
Trust not the babbling languages of those
That seem thy friends, but are thy greatest foes;
They Are great to thy desruction, they will connive
And fawn, nay almost bury thee alive;
They Will talk of Heaven and Hell, they will tell thee stories
Of endless, boundless, unconceived glories;
They Will tell thee of Eternity, and woo
Thy Soul out of thy ears, if thou wilt bestow
Thy pains to hear them; they will infuse, and brew
Their own designs, and tell thee all is true
That they declare; they will tell thee that they are sent
As Messengers from Heavens high Parliament.
Believe me Soul, it is I that can display
The Gospels Colors better far then they;
There Is nothing in that volume so obstruce,
But I can wind and twist it to my use;
And there is nothing in this world can be
Styled worth a work, but can be done by me:
I can do all; it lies within my power
To make thee poor or rich in half an hour:
I can command whole Legions to attend
Upon my honor: Say, what nobler friend
Can thou embrace; I Will be a friend to all
That will give audience to my faithful call;
I Will make them swell with riches, they shall have
As much, nay if not more, then they can crave:
Am I not rare, and rich, and high, and great,
Incomprehensible? Is not my seat
The throne of happiness? Yet cannot I
Invite thee to my sweet eternity?
Come gentle Soul into my twining arms,
I Will hug thee, I Will delight thee with my charms,
I Will show thee all my Joys, nothing shall lie
Hid from the view of thy all-gazing eye;
Happy, beyond expression.

Sou. Satan, stay
The progress of thy tongue, and give me way*
That I may vent my thoughts, for you have spoke
At large already; and is this the stroke
Which you intend shall wound me? Be assured,
The blows but small, and well may be endured.

Sat. What, moved to passion! Is thy mind disturbed
With foul mistrust? pray let those thoughts be curbd:
What, do thou think I am perfidious? Fie;
It Is folly to condemn before you try.
Alas, alas! what profit can accrue
To me, by wronging such a Soul as you?
What I express is only for your good,
But what is more (then grave advice) withstood?
I doubt these weak, these empty thoughts presage
A tempest, guarded with a storm of rage:
Well then, storm on, and when thy storm is spent,
Sit down, and meditate, and then repent.

Sou. Repent, Oh happy word! although expressed
By a foul mouth; those that repent are blessed.
How dares thy hellish lips (...) a word
Filled with divinity, but will afford
No rest, no comfort, to thy horrid Soul?
Begone, begone; and if thou can condole
Thy self, thou art (if Logic prove but true)
Cursed in the Major, and the Minor too.
Bless me, O Heaven: What blustering stormy weather
Drove such a vile prodigious Monster hither?
Touchstone of baseness, do thou come to prove
Whether I Am gold, or dross; thou may remove
Thy forward hopes, because I hope to be
Metal at last for Heaven, and not for thee.
Begone, fallacious wretch, I cannot brook
Thy golden baits, I have discry'd thy hook*
Father of lies, thy policy is built
Upon the sands, and plaster'd over with guilt*
Thy tongue foretells a storm; if so, be sure
Thy sand-built policy shall not endure:
Flatt'ry's the life of baseness, and that art
Is well imprinted in thy subtle heart*
Do thou believe that I can entertain
Belief from thee? Or do thou think to reign
Within my breast? No* no* thy cloudy powers
Are at the best but falsifying showrs*
Be satisfied, I cannot give the least
Of credit to thee, nor I dare not feast
My thoughts with such uncertainties; I know
Thy diet must and will corrupt to woe.
Thou bidst me not condemn before I make
Some ^^^al of thy trust* If I should ^^^^
Such green advice, I quickly should undo
My wretched self; and in condemning you
What profit could I have? or what relief
Could I expect to mitigate my grief?
My accusations would be blown as dust
Before the wind; I Will neither try, nor trust

Sat. Nor try, nor trust? Art thou resolved to cross
My real motions? Do, and see whose loss
Will prove most weighty; if I lose the heat
Of thy weak love, my loss will not be great;
But if I should withdraw my love from thee,
How* like a Map of well drawn misery,
Would thou appear? Be wise, correct thy thoghts;
Neglected favors prove the greatest faults.
Take my instructions, for it is I must bring
Content unto thee; it is a glorious thing
To be immortal: prithee Soul decline
Thy former ways; say, shall I call thee mine:
M^^e, mine thou art; I Will load thee with renown;
Let me but conquer, thou shall wear the Crown.
How pleasing are my Joys! how full of peace
Are all my ways! my glories still increase:
I Am great and good, I take delight to win
Distressed Souls, and lead them from their sin:
I cannot choose but pity those that lie
Upon the beds of sensualli^y!
My melting Soul is always free to give
Comfort to them that study how to live.
Alas, the care and trouble that I take
^s more for their content, then my own sake:
My gates are always open, they that venture
To come to me shall (with a welcome) enter!
And when they call, and cry, I will appear
My self unto them, and rejoice to hear
Their sad complaints; I will not hide my face
From them that seek the glory of my grace:
I cannot be unconstant; I must grieve
To hear their sorrows, and I will relieve*
I will be pitiful to them that trust
In me alone: I cannot be unjust;
I cannot, no I cannot; Earth shall move
Sooner then I will falsify my love:
I am eternal; they that will endeavor
To gain my love, shall have my heart for ever.

Sou. It Is not your empty words shall make my breast
Stoop to the flattery of thy vain request;
Though I have ears to hear, I have a mind
That will not shake at the hard-breathing wind
Of your discourse; what you pretend for reason,
Is nothing but the froth of private treason:
*It Is not your multiloquious tongue can turn
The Bi^s of my Soul, or make me sp^^n
At holy Writs; it is not your fond conceit
Of being good, shall make me to retreat
From Heavens Commands* it is not your promis d joys
Can make me cheerful, or your painted toys
^^^ sure me to your fist* it is not the dar^
Of your va^^ love can penitrate my heart;
It Is not your seeming clemency can make
My Soul to love you, for your pities sake;
It Is not your always-open gates that shall
Entice my steps to your large Gilded Hall;
It Is not your self-appearance shall invite
My well-composed thoughts to your delight;
It Is not your greatness that shall make me yield
To your desires; Religion is my shield:
I Will neither fear nor love your rash evasions,
Nor give attendance to your smooth persuasions*
It Is difficult to serve two Masters well;
Who strays from Heaven must needs approach to Hell.
I am advised to shun the broad-path'd ways
That lead to ruin; what the Scripture says
I must believe; it is dangerous to fly
Without the wings of true divinity:
The Scriptures are my way, my light, my guide,
And they that go without them needs must slide*
The paths are strait in which I ought to run
The course of grace, until my days are done;
And they that change a virtue for a vice,
Deserve no fruit from Heavens blessed Paradise.

Sat. Surcease those fond conceits, thou do but spin
Thine own destructions, and connive at sin*
Urge not the Scriptures, for I dare maintain
My paths are best, and other ways are vain:
Thy Scripture- conscience will at last confound
The Amazed thoughts, and give thy Soul a wound
That hates a cure, then shall thou prove unblest,
Whilst others find the plainest road's the best*
Suppose thou were (I speak it for thy sake)
Moved by occasions, forced to undertake
A long-way'd journey, would thou not enquire
The readiest way, but run into the mire?
If thou should act a crime so foully bad,
Folly would style thee fool, and Wisdom mad.
Stray not into the wilderness of grief,
But come to me, take courage, and be brief
In thy designs; persuade thy self, that I
Am both thy light, thy way, and best supply
In time of need; I am thy prop, thy stay;
Therefore resolve, and trifle not away
Thy thriftless Soul, be not thy self-destroyer;
I Will be thy Love, and thou my Loves enjoyer:
Know that my real breast contrives no end,
But what may merit so divine a friend
As thine own self: Folly and Wisdom lies
Before thy face; be either fool, or wise:
Protract no time, but make a speedy choice,
Thy welfare shall instruct me to rejoice;
Observe my actions ^^ ^^^^ my (...),
Let Us know each other by exchange of hearts;
I Will give thee ^^^ne, and for my love restore
Thine unto me; grant this, I Will ask no more:
Be free to give, as I am free to crave;
Thou Had better live my friend, then dye my slave:
For if thou shall deny what I desire,
I Will make my bellows to advance the fire
Of thy distress, and sorrows shall corrode
Thy stubborn heart, and care shall make abode
Within thy breast, perpetuated grief
Shall find a voice, but ramble from relief:
I Will gripe thee, till I make thee understand
The fiery language of my furious hand:
Sighings, and groaning, sobs, and tears, and cries,
Shall be thy sad Concomitants; thine eyes
Shall stare upon (well may I call them new
And horrid) lights, such lights as shall renew
Thy growing torments; every thing shall be
Thy fellow slaves in servile misery:
I Will yoke thee with distress, nay and I Will chain
Thy struggling Soul with everlasting pain:
I Will crow'd thee full of sorrows, and I Will double
Thy unconceived, uncontrouled trouble,
Whilst I, triumphing I, will sit aloft,
And be adored, and scoff to see thee s^offt:
Pity shall be a stranger to my breast;
My care shall be to make thy Soul unblest*
The tides of woe shall overflow thy thoughts*
And be equivalent unto thy faults,
Be sure, that what extremity can be
Thought worth the using, shall be used on thee:
Now I have spoke, if thou will not repent
I Will cease to speak, and study to torment.

Sou. How full of poyson's every word that flows
Out of thy mouth? what trust can I repose
In such a flatterer* I dare not try,
O^ throw my self upon thy courtesy:
I know thou can not answer my request;
There is no trust in a self-praising breast.
If I should dive into the deep abyss
Of thy black thoughts, what glory, or what bliss
Should I discern? Or if I should deliver
My heart to thee, thou would disrespect the giver;
Though at the first perhaps thou would express
A seeming-unbeseeming thankfulness,
Yet at the last I know thou would decline
Thy promised ways and style me to be thine.
Fair words find easy passage, they proceed
^ut from the tongue (...) crowns the deed,
Three things denotes a friend; first, to conceal
A secret speech; the next is, to reveal
A private good; the last is, to advise
The safest way t'obtain an enterprise:
And he that can do this, a^ you pretend,
Deserves the ti^le of a real friend*
But my Religion tutors me to say,
(Nay and affirm,) You neither can, nor may;
I Am sure it is (if Reason dare prove true)
One thing to speak, another thing to do.
Your words are airy messengers, which fly
Into my ears, and there enroul a lie*
Many untruths have broke the Common Goal
Of thy foul mouth; thou say thou can prevail
To make me glorious, and thou can increase
My Joys, and crown me with eternal Peace:
Thou say thou art good and great, and that thy paths
Lead to Salvation; thou declarest thy Laws
To be most just; If all these things be ^^ue,
I needs must call the Scriptures false, or you:
Truth bids me tell thee boldly, when thou cry'st
Thou Art great, and good, and rich, and rare, thou lie:
If thou art good and great, pray tell me why
Thou will behold so vile a wretch as I*
These things bespeak thee humble, unto which
Thou plead'st not guilty; and if thou art rich,
How can it be, that thou will condescend
To feed my wants, that am so poor a friend?
Strange is that charity* which seems to shine
From such a ^iabolick breast as thine.
If my belief could keep an equal pace
With thy swift tongue, how full of Faith and Grace
Should I appear? Such Faith as would devast
My wanton Soul, and make me weep as fast.
It is impossible to find a Sion
That has no Governor, except a Lion.

The Souls Petition to God.
Oh Heaven, I crave that thou would keep me still
From this most ^ile Progenitor of Ill;
Suffer him no^ t'infold me in his arms,
^r overcome me with his wanton charms:
Oh make my heart obdure, that he may knock
Upon my Soul, as on a Marble Rock;
Be thou my Fort, and then I shall endure
His furious on-sets, and repose secure:
Give me thy grace, that I may be content;
Make me as strong, as he is impudent.
Now let the spring-tyde of thy fierce desires
Flow to the height, thou shall not quench my ^^^^!
Know Satan, know, my heart reserves no place
For thy abode, I scorn thee to thy face:
The well-dy'd colors of my Soul declares
Defiance to thee, and my breast prepares
To give thee battle; strike, I fear thee not;
Whose armed with Faith needs fear no Canon-shot.
What impious tongue is that which dares defy
Sat. My power with so much boldness? So. Wretch, it is I;
It Is I (infernal Traitor) that will spend
My strength to prove thou art a flattering friend.

Sat. Move me to anger, do, and thou shall find
A courteous friend at last may prove unkind:
Have I not wooed thee almost night and day
To go to Heaven?

Sou. The quite contrary way.


Sat. Have I not labored like a watchful father
To nourish thee?

Sou. Or like a Devil rather.


Sat. Have I not always taken great delight?


S^ll. To take away good gold, and give me light.


Sat. How much nocturnal and diurnal care
Have I sustained for thee?

Sou. True, t'insnare.


Sat. Have I not been assiduous to a wait
Upon thy pleasure?

Sou. And corrupt my state.


Sat. Have I not proffered all that can be given
To a sick Soul?

Sou. To drive my Soul from Heaven.


Sat. Did I not promise to be true and just?


S^ll. Did I not say, I Would neither try nor trust?


Sat. Did I not promise that I Would make thee wise?


Sou. Did I not say thou were composed of lies?


Sat. Did I not promise to increase thy store?


Sou. Did I not say such wealth would make me poor?


Sat. Did I not promise to advance thy flame?


Sou. Did I not say thy honors were thy shame?


Sat. Did I not promise to uphold thy peace?


Sou. Did I not say such wars would never cease?


Sat. Did I not promise thee a Crown of life?


Sou. Did I not say that Crown would crown my strife?


Sat. Did I not promise thee eternal glory?


Sou. Did I not say that promise was a story?


Sat. Did I not promise I would give thee all?


Sou. Did I not say such promises were small?


Sat. Did I not tell thee I was great and good?


Sou. Did I not answer 'twas in shedding blood?


Sat. Did I not tell thee that my ways were best?


Sou. Did I not answer that they were unblest?


Sat. Did I not tell thee that thou should have joy?


Sou. Did I not answer such as would destroy?


Sat. Did I not tell thee that I did lament?


Sou. Did I not answer that I was content?


Sat. Did I not tell thee what a friend I Would prove?


Sou. Did I not answer that I could not love?


Sat. Thus by fair terms ^ labored to obtain.


Sou. Thus in ^oul terms ^ told thee 'twas in vain.


Sat. Then I begun to threaten thee with grief.


Sou. And then I fled to Heaven, and found relief.


Sat. I threatened to afflict thee with large pains.


Sou. I told thee such afflictions were my gains.


Sat. I told thee more then now I will express.


Sou. My answers made thee wish I had spoke less.


Sat. But now I see my real words can find
No rest within the center of thy mind;
For it is in vain to sow the seeds of life
In a dead heart that is manured with strife:
I Will therefore cease my importuning love,
I Will show my Serpent, and keep close my Dove.
Do, do thy worst, vile wretch, I Will make thee know
Griefs abstract, and the quintessence of woe;
I Will load thee with extremities, thy breast
Shall always crave, but find no place of rest:
Had but my grave advice received a place
Within thy heart, thou had been filled with grace,
But now the inundations of thy trouble
Shall overflow thee, and I will redouble
My new-contrived plagues; I Will make thee feel
My melting heart is now transformed to steel:
Thy tongue shall (like a bolt of thunder) roll
And roar within thy mouth; thy sulphurous Soul
Shall flash forth lightening, and thy blood-red eyes
Shall blaze like Comets in the troubled Skies;
Thy teeth shall gnash, as if they scorned to be
Concomitants in so much misery:
Oh how I Will carbonado every part,
And sill thy body with increasing smart;
Thy Soul shall lure for death, but that shall hate
To pierce upon thee, and contemn thy state:
Life shall be still incroaching, but thy breath
Shall scorn that life, and hate it unto death;
Thy flesh shall drop forth brimstone, and thy bones
Shall court each other in their crackling tones;
Horror shall be thy watchman, curses shall
Possess thy tongue, one torment still shall call
Upon another; when thy voice shall cry
But for a drop, Confusion shall reply,
No, no, thou shall not; if a golden Mine
^ould buy a drop, that drop should not be thine;
Then shall thou say, if thou had been at first
Advised by me, thou had not been accursed:
Thus in this sad Dilemma shall thou roar,
And crave my succor, but I Will not deplore
Thy woeful state, because thou were averse
To goodness; after folly comes a curse:
Then shall thou know and find I will exile
All thoughts of pity, and I Will rather smile
Then grieve at thy distress; ah know, it is hard
To force an entrance where the gates are barred:
Fond Soul, be serious, let thy thought reflect
On my indulgency, and give respect
Unto my el^mency; believe, I will
^e good to thee, do but forsake thy Ill;
Forsake, forsake that evil which will tur^
To thy destruction; do not, do not burn
The precious fuel of thy chaste desires
In idle, wanton, all consuming fires:
The Post of Time is swift, and knows no stay;
It Is time to go when Reason calls away:
Protraction's dangerous; it is not good
To strive with that which scorns to be withstood:
Then do not thou procrastinate, but take
This opportunity; do but forsake
Thy former ways, and readily incline
Thy self to me, and I will make thee shine
With so much luster, that all eyes shall gaze
Upon thy brightness, and admire with praise:
Oh may my language teach thee to believe,
That so my torments may not make thee grieve
In utter darkness, that thou may embrace
Those glories which adorn my peaceful place:
Repent, (dear Soul) repent what thou have done,
Then call me father, and I Will love my son:
Thus having told thee all, I Will here desist;
Be thou more apt to yield then to resist.

Sou I find, I find, you first inflict a wound,
And then with balsom strive to make it sound:
You Will make me smile at first, but after groan;
One hand incloses bread, the other stone;
I fain would take the bread, but that I stand
In fear and danger of the stony hand*
Therefore, to shun all danger, I Will despise
Your fond advice, and practice to be wise:
If all should prove, that you have told me, true,
I know the best and worst that thou can do;
As for your threatenings, they shall not disturb
My peaceful thoughts, my faith shall be their curb*
Urge me no more, but let me rest in quiet,
Strong is that stomach can digest thy diet.

Sat. And is it so? will no persuasions work
Upon thy thoughts? Those pregnant crimes that lurk
Within thy breast, will, like to Scorpions, gnaw
Thy groaning heart; such sorrow knows no Law:
But since thou will not be advised, expect
To find reward, as I have found neglect.
Ah, why fond wretch, why do thou thus provide
Thy feeble self to strive against the tide?
Alas, alas! why art thou lulled asleep
In follies lap? Rouse up for shame, and weep
For thine infirmities; be not thus cross
To him that would preserve thee from a loss:
It Is time to cast away the works of night,
And cloth thee with the shining robes of light.

Sou. If your strong Oratory had the skill
To make me yield to your unsatiate will,
It were enough; what more could you desire,
Then a bad period to your bad desire?
But stay (bold friend) I Will meditate, and see
What fruit will spring from thine infernal tree.

Sat. What, must I stay (vile wretch) till you dispute,
And prove the goodness of my pleasing fruit?
Must I be always waiting on the train
Of your desires, and spend my time in vain?
No, no, I will not; for it is unfit
I should attend, if you will not submit:
The Incensed fury of my spirits burn
To be in action, I will not adjourn
A minute longer; go, and hug thy vice,
Thou love the bargain, but abhor'st the price:
Urge me no more, away, I have forgot
All thoughts of friendship, and I know thee not:
And here I leave thee to the lawless power
Of thine own passion; cursed be that hour
that brought thee forth; if all this will not do,
May all men curse thee, and I Will curse thee too.

Sou. And can the spring of thy affections find
So soon an Autumn? Can thou be unkind
With so much ease? And can your real breast
(As you so called) be so soon dispossessed
Of love and patience? Oh how bad and strange
Is the effect of such a sudden change!
It Is disputable, for I know not whether
Anger, or policy, or both together,
Whar^t thee to these extremes: Well then, pursue
Thine own de^i^^s, and I will bid ad^e
To all thy follies; yet my heart begun
T'expand it self before the gl^^'ring Sun
O^ ^hy persuasions; if thy sharp'ned rage
I ^^d ^ot so soon exploded me the stage,
I (...), I fear, I had before this hour
B^^n prostituted to thy tameless power:
B^^gone, begone; but stay, hark ^atan, hark,
Go b^^st you shot, but fairly missed the mark.

(...) Why do thou bid me go? I Am sure you speak
(...), in ^^st, thou W^l^ not break
(...) of (...); though thou have expressed
Thy (...) the^ ^^^ ^^ j^st:
(...) go^d (...) which l^ve in th^inner places
(...) with graces:

(...)

(...)
(...) fire*
(...)
(...) ^ain:

(...)
``Above all sense: when Reason finds divorce,
``The tongue proves subject to a headlong course.
What I have spoke observe, and thou shall find
Proceeded from my passion, not my mind:
The misconstruction of a word may make
The dearest friends ^o vary, and forsake
The plains of friendship, though their hearts are ^r^^
From the cursed evils of Inconstancy:
Therefore mistake me not, nor do not thou
Construe my words with an incensed brow:
Smile on me then, and cheerfully impart
The loving chidings of a friendly heart;
Then shall thou see with what a willing arm
I will conduct and guide thee from all harm:
Believe me Soul. I am not come to scatter
Uncertain stories, but a real matter;
What I hold forth unto thee, is the stem
Of a pure heart, thou art the only ^^m
Shall grow upon it, come, and let us combine,
I shall rejoice to see thee prove divine.

Sou. The Bias of thy Love runs now so strong,
That I much fear 'twill not continue long;
I find, I find thou have the art to sail
With any wind; thou labour'st to prevail,
But it is in vain, for know, I Will ^^ust thee not,
My zealous heart is ^ea^^ul of a plot*
I cannot be so foolish as to trust
Without assurance that thou will be just*
Will thou be true? speak with a real breath.

Sat. I will be just (believe me) unto death;
I will, I will; oh may I never be
True to my self, if I am false to thee.

Sou. If thou art just and constant, tell me where
Thy seat is placed, and who is Prince of th'^ir*
Be true in this, and thou shall find that I,
According to thy answer, will reply.

Sat. I Will tell thee then (because I Will now fulfill
The vast desires of thy enquiring will)
Where my refulgent Seat is placed; prepare
Thy ears to hear, I Will speedily declare.
The large extent of my unbounded grace
Cannot be comprehended in one place,
Because I am immortal, unconfined
To time or place; I live in every mind
That Is truly real, and not disagreeing
To my known Laws; I have no local Being:
The World's a spacious Body, I the Soul
Which lives in every part complete and whole:
Thus this dispute is easily decided*
For what is immortal cannot be divided.
Nay more, because I Will fill thee with content,
I say I Am Prince of every Element,
Therefore of Air; Now if thou can enquire
Any thing mo^e, I Will answer thy desire.

Sou. Before I suffer my swift thoughts to slide
Into more questions, I Will be satisfied
In what is past: If so it be, you have
No local Being, how then will you save
Those Hosts of Souls which you intend shall be
Sealed with the Signet of Eternity?
Did you not tell me, that your peaceful Seat
Was rich, sublime, (and without measure) great?
If thus it be, as it is expressed by you,
It Is more then strange that it is not local too:
Clear but this doubt, and thou shall quickly find
Those duties that attend an honest mind
Flow from my br^st, till th^^ I Will ^^st in (...),
As you perform, so shall my love increase.

Sat. Ambiguous Soul, why do thou thus connive
At thine own follies? Why do thou deprive
Thy self of comfort, comforts that will heal
Th'exulcerous sores of thy distempered weal?
Why art thou thus inquisitive? the thing
That thou desir'st ^o know (if known) will bring
Small satisfaction to thy dubiours breast;
He Is wise enough that knows he shall be blessed*
If you enquire in such a doubtful case,
You Will lose your rest in seeking out the place.
Surcease thy thoughts, and do not proudly knock
Thy self in pieces, now thou know the rock:
Pry not too far, let secret things alone,
My Zodiac has more signs then must be known:
It Is not the Heaven of Heavens that can contain
Me, the Creator, and my glorious train:
I am even what I please, and I will be
Even where I will. So. Where Is that? Sa. What Is that to thee?
The knowledge of my Seat does no way tend
To thy Salvation, therefore cease to spend
Such truitless thoughts, cast by this needless care,
Learn to know what I am, no matter where.

Sou I must confess, it is not good to pry
In things that suit not the capacity;
But seeing 'twas your pleasure to express
So much of friendship, I made bold t'address
My self unto you, pardon then my crimes,
You know that wisest men may doubt sometimes:
Your weights are light, or else your courage fails,
You have not strength enough to turn the scales
Of my affections, yet you had almost
Droven my ill-man'd ship upon your Coast;
The winds of your persuasions rage and roar
Within my breast* I cannot find a shore
For my desires; I Am tossed from wave to wave,
And am become a most distracted slave:
Those heavenly thoughts which formerly frequented
The closet of my breast, are now prevented
By base-bred fancies, fancies that arise
From a foul brain, and makes me to despise
Almost my self; I know not what to do,
I dare not, oh I dare not yield to you;
And yet I hardly can believe thou will
Burden thy conscience with so foul a guilt
As to betray me, sure thou art more kind
Then to abuse a well-affected mind*
But yet I dare not trust a Soul-pursuer,
Because thou kill'st when thou pretend'st to cure.
I reel, I reel, (if not sustained) I shall
Receive a sudden and a deadly fall;
What shall I do in this deplot'd condition?
I fear, I fear I Have lost my best Physician:
Try Satan, try, and see what may be done
For a sick Soul, that foolishly has run
Beyond it self; oh see what thou can do
To give me ease, and then I Will call thee true.

Sat. Now Soul I love thee; rouse, bid grief depart,
Thou have the symptoms of an honest heart:
Methinks I could, with much content, afford
To say thou speak a Christian at a word;
Cheer up, and know that many troubles wait
Upon the changes of an ancient State:
The work of Reformation always brings
Trouble at first, but afterward it sings
Anthems of Peace, whose fortunate event
Will more then countervail thy discontent.
He that has spent the treasure of his days
Under one roof, has reason to dispraise
The troubles of removing; yet at last
(When his defatigating cares are past)
He may declare himself to be a debtor
To fortune, and confess that life the better.
Even so may thou (dear Soul) hereafter say,
Blessed be that hand which led thee from the way
And paths of Ignorance, although at first
^ It Is often known, beginnings are the worst
Thou feel'st a private nakedness within,
Because thou have unclothed thy self of sin:
Although, I must confess, there cannot be
A (...) in nature, yet in thee
There is an (...), and most be still,
For what is empty craves a time to till.
If he whole stomach has sustained the rage
Of sharp'ning hunger. should at first assuage
His appe^^ce with sulness, would it not
Produce a ^u^sere, and impose a blo^
Upon his wisdom, ra^^ing such a st^^fe
Within his (...), that his ^^^e
Would be endangered? Therefore learn by rote,
That moderation is the chiefest note:
In all my Gammut, none can sing so high
A note as moderation, only I.
If I should let thee make too large a meal
Of my rich Joys at first, I should reveal
Too much of folly; for if thou should take
A surfeit at the first, It needs must make
Thee fear, nay hate, to entertain my diet;
It Is better far to spare at first then riot:
Moreover, should I let thee taste thy fill
At first, I know the reins of thy fierce will
Would scorn a hand, it is dangerous to trust;
Presumptions spur can never want for rust:
Come Soul, let Reason rule thee, do not stain
Thy well-dy'd judgment, it is a greater pain
To fear, then suffer; come, I long to see
Thee wanton with me in Eternity;
Then doubt no more, resolve, and let us away,
There is no greater grief then to delay
A happiness; be well informed of this,
Procrastination is a foe to Bliss.

Sou. Thy words imposthumate my heart, I feel
A greater pain then ever Ixions wheel
Knew how to inflict, extremities still crowd
Into my thoughts; my sorrows call aloud,
And none will hear; what shall I do? for I
Unworthy am to live, unfit to dye;
Except th^all* ruling power above will please
T'inspect my Soul, and furnish me with ease,
To whose blessed ears I Will recommend my suit,
My sorrows will not let my tongue be mute.
Great Auditor of groans, oh let my cries,
My sighs, my tears, invite thine ears, thine eyes
To bear, and view me, for I must confess,
My crimes are great, and I am nothing less
Then what is least; alas! and nothing better
Then what is worst, oh pardon me thy debtor!
I Am tossed with grief, and know not where to steer
My shipwrack'd self, but still my sins appear
Before my face, whose looks almo^t affright,
And make me start into eternal night:
What shall I do? or whither shall I dee.
That am an allen (Lord) except to thee*
From thee leann^^, and I am ^^o vile
To come unto thee, having made ^ ^po^l
Or those most sacred mercies which thy hand
(...) upon me, there is no Command
But I have broke; vec, gracious Lord, I know
That thy abounding mercies (...)
(...) excelling (...), which cannot lie
(...) ^urveying eye.
With shame I must confess the subtle art
Of Satan has impoysoned my heart;
Oh I am sick to death, I swell, I burst
Never was any soul so much accursed:
There Is none but thee, thou sacred antidote
Can cure my grief, be therefore pleased to note
My sad condition, let my sorrows lie
Before thy face, oh hear me when I cry;
Grant me the shield of faith, that I may stand
In opposition to the powerful hand
O^ active Satan, weaken (Lord) his power
And add unto my strength; Let every hour
Afford new mercies, mercies that may sail
Into my breast, ah should my Foc prevail
Oh then I perish, shorten ( Lord) his chain
And lengthen out my patience, oh make vain
His fierce attempts, that he may feel, and see
When he is strongest, I Am as strong as he,
Then shall my lips extol thee, and proclaim
The greatness of thy glory* and his shame
Give but thy grace unto me ( Lord) and then
Say what thou will, my tongue shall say dmen.

Sat. Let everlasting plagues and horror dwell
Within so fit a soul, let black-mouthed Hell
Remove his situation, and take
An everlasting Lease, oh let him make
A Tenement of thee; do thou think that I
Will here thy prayers, oh no, I scorn thee, fiye
Away, begone --

Sou What voice is this that makes this bold intrusion
Into my ears, and grumbles out confusion,
Me thinks I see a storme-portending cloud,
Bowel'd with thunder, and I hear a loud
And horrid noise, a noise that would confound
A wel-prepared ear to here the sound;
Who would not quake at such a voice as this
That roares forth Malice with an Emphasis?
My thoughts are interrupted, and amasement,
Flashes like Lightning through the brittle casement
Of my ill-gla^ed breast; It cannot be
The voice of Heaven, a God so pure as he
Hates to be envious, malice cannot spring
From such a good (and love-composed) King;
Although his voice (made terrible) oft-times
By the addition of man's daily crimes
Thunders against a sinner, yet his breath
Can take no pleasure in a sinners death.
Hereafter (Lord) when malice finds a voice
To speak, my understanding shall rejoice,
In knowing who it is; this heart of mine
Shall never quake at any voice but thine;
Then let hels deep-mouthed blood-hound, roar and thunder
I Will neither fear, nor love, nor quake, nor wonder,
For it is not strange to here a Lion roar
That wants his prey, the more he has, the more
He seeks for more, employing still his power
In seeking how, and whom he may devour;
Know therefore Satan, that I am prepared
To meet thee, and I will not be out dared;
It Is not thy false malisluous tongue shall tempt
My heart to love, no, nor thy rage exempt
My thoghts from heaven, although thy craft still lurks
For opertunity to stop good works;
When I compose my self, and strive ^o pray,
Thou seek'st to t^r^ my thoughts another way:
Thou great corrupter of Diviner parts,
Thou watchful theif that steal'st into the hearts
Of silly mo^t^ds, think not to devour
My armed heart with thy persuing power.
Will nothing move thee, will thou still mistrust,

Sat. If fare means will not move thee, foul means must
What do thou think my arm is grown so short
It cannot reach thee, do thou think to sport
with my commands; say, thou imperious mite
Who gave thee being, who created light,
Who made the Heavens, the earth, the sea, reply
Audacious wretch, speak, was it thee, or I,
Thou vain contender, do thou think to gain
By striving with me, any thing but pain,
Oh no, thou shall not, for I Will still renew
Thy pinching sorrows, therefore bid adue
To all thy comforts, for thou shall no more
Enjoy those blessings thou injoyd'st before,
Oh how thy horrid tongue shall roar and cry
With Dives for a drop, but no supply
Shall dare t'appear; the more thou crav'st, the less
Thou shall be heard, for nothing shall express
The least of pleasure to thy per boiled heart,
Thy chiefest food shall be perpetual smart,
Be well assured that thy ears thy eyes
Shall hear, nor see, naught but extremities,
Begone, begone, my sury hates delay;
Hell, and damnation be thy lot, away.

Sou. Experience makes me understand thou art
A lively actor, of a deadly part,
I find the greatness of your swelling rage;
Your Prologue speaks 'twould be a bloody stage
If you might act as King, but Heaven prevent
The cursed plots of your accursed intent;
I fear thee not, because I know thy power
Is limited, and thou can not devour
Without commission, therefore do thy worst,
And let thy envy swell until it burst
And sall to nothing, my Creator gives
Me faith to say that my Redeemer lives,
And will protect me from the rage of those
That are my known and secret deadly Foes.
Thy thundering words shall not make me complying
For he is unwise that dies for fear of dying;
Thus being guarded with the shield of grace
I Will spite deffiance in thine impious face.
Thou art a Lyou, and thou seek'st for blood
How bad's that soul that dares to think thee good;
Urge me no more cashiere thy fruitless trouble,
The more thou striv'st, the more I Will strive to double
My resolutions, for I dare not venture
To rest my heart on such a bloody center,
Oh no I dare not; he that shall let go
A certain friend for a most certain foe
Justly deserves to have no other fame,
But what reproach can build upon his name;
Should I permit my rambling thoughts to glance
Upon thy love, the Plea of Ignorance
Could not be prevalent, because it is known
Unto the blest-united three in one
That I (by his assistance) have discry'd
Thy real slat'ry, and thy humble pride;
I dare affirm no greater pride can be
Then that that is acted with humility,
But here I Will stop and leave thee to inherit
The effects of a diabolique spirit.

Sat. Accursed chat^ffe, do thou think to escape
The fury of my hand, or make a rape
Upon my goodness, no, the Sun and Moon
Shall stop their usual progresses as soon
As I will change my mind, vengeance is mine
And I Will repay it on that Soul of thine.
Begone, begone, expect thy sudden doom,
It is thy sins give punishment a room:
Let everlasting Plagues, and horror dwell
Within so ^it a Soul, let black-mouthed Hell
Remove his situation, and so take
A still continuing Lease, oh let him make
A ten'ment of thee, do thou think that I
YYill hear thy Prayers, oh no I scorn thee, sye
Away, begone

Sou If words could kill, I had been ere this time
Worded to death, but now I hope to clime
Above the reach of words in thy despite,
Where thou may grumble at me, but not bite
Even as the surly blood-desiring dog
Tied with a chain, or loaded with a elog
Grows si^r^^r with restraint, and stands in awe
Of nothing but his master, to whose law
He must submit and keep within his list;
For fear will not permit him to resist;
But if some wandering passenger should chance
To walk along, he quickly would advance
His watchful head, and running too and fro
From place to place, he tuggs but cannot go
Beyond his bounds, but labors still in vain
(With fruitless biting of his senseless chain)
To free himself, but when he finds his strength
Is not sufficient to out-go the length
Of his well-fastned chain, he soon devides
His sharp-fang'd jaws, and bauls until his sides
And lungs are weary, then he runs the round
Until he lays himself upon the ground
Where he remains much displeased and vexed
Seeming to threaten ruin to the next:
So you (hels ty^dog) if thou could but strain
And quit thy self from heaven's fast-holding chain
What Soul could escape thy jaws, or be possessed
Of lasting peace, or comfortable rest,
How sad, how miserable had it been
For patient Job, had but thy power been seen
Upon his heart; but Heaven that will control
In spite of malice, chained thee from his soul:
Alas, alas! thy chain is not so long
To reach a soul, nor is thy power so strong
To break it at thy pleasure, thou may baul
And bark forth envy, but not hurt at all;
If thou art God [as thou pretendest] why,
Why do thou suffer such a thing as I
TO expostulate so long, and do not show
Thy judgments in my speedy overthrow.

Sat. It is my goodness and not thy desert
That breeds for bearance in my tender heart,
Alas, alas, what honor would acrue
To me in conquering such a thing as you,
I could within a moments time assuage,
(But that my clemency out-vies my rage)
Thy swelling fury, for I could discharge
Vollies of wrath and easily enlarge
Thy restless torments, I could make thee run
(Like morning mists before the rising sun)
Out of my presence, If I should but say
The word begone, ah less thou could not stay,
But ah I cannot, for I hate to ha^me,
Love guides my strength, and that strength guids my arm
Even as the Shepherd with be-dewed locks
Watches the feeding of his harmless flocks
For fear the bold-fac'd wolf should chance to peep
Into the coasts of his beloved sheep,
And like a ^awlesse Tyrant, soon commence
(Against those Emblems of pure innocence)
A bloody action, which would soon incite
The Sheepheards grief, to see so sad a sight,
So I the eternal Shepherd daily watch
My wel-fed Lambs for fear Hels wolf should catch
Or fright (not being fearful to be bold)
My gentle flocks from their delightful fold;
I am beloved, and mine own, will own
My sacred Name, my voice is not unknown
Unto my Sheep, they always will be all
Firmly obedient to my cheerful call,
For which obedience they shall find reward
Nay such a one, as always shall accord
To their desires, thrice happy shall they be
In truly calling, and in owning me
To be their Shepherd, nothing can more please
M' indulgent soul, then such dear slocks as these,
I will preserve them, and no wolt shall dare
To seize upon them, or presume to rear
Their downy fleeces, nothing shall be nearer
Unto my heart, and nothing shall be dearer
In my affections, for I will affect
Even where, and when I find a true respect.
What strange contusions has thy language bred

Sou Within my serious thoughts, how have thou fed
My ears with slatt'ries, but it is in vain;
Because my heart has vowed not to retain
Thy feigned expressions, nothing shall remove
My love from God, nor nothing make me love
Thy wretched self; then be content, and cease
To urge my mind, or interrupt my Peace.
Go, do thy worst, And when that worst is done
Sit down as wisely as thou have begun:

Sat. Art thou resolved? Well then, let vengance light
Upon thy cursed head, begone, thou mite
(Nay less) of goodness, go, make have t'inherit
Those plagues that wait upon so damned a spirit?

Sou May this be called a farewell, if it be,
The self same farewell must attend on thee;
I hate, nay scorn to bid farewell to you,
T^is charity enough to bid, (...).

The Souls Thankefulness, and Request to God.
MOst gracious God, I having lately felt
The servont of thy mercies, needs must melt
Into a thankfulness, Ah should I be
Ungrateful to so blessed a God as thee
'Twere pity, ah 'twere pity, that the air
Should give me breath, or thy fierce hand forbear
To throw me headlong to the deep abis^
Of speedy ruin, where no comfort is:
Oh glorious Lord be pleased to inflame
My heart with raptures, to extol thy name;
Alas I Am weak, and if thou should deny
Thy aid, nothing could be more weak than I
If thou will help me, I shall be so strong,
That nothing can prevail to do me wrong,
Lord I am blind, oh therefore let thy light
Expel those clouds that thus ecclips my sight;
Be thou my guide, my strength, my sight, my way,
O^ else (being weak) I shall or fall, or stray;
Oh leave me not, but as thou have begun
To show me mercy, let thy mercy run
With my desires, and grant that I may be
A true forgetter of all things, but thee,
And rather then I should forget thy call,
Oh let me have no memory at all?
Wean me, oh wean me from this nursing earth
Make it my sorrow, and thy Throne my mirth.
Let every morning make me know, and say
Thy Laws are Just, or let me know no day;
Let every evening make me take delight
^n thy commands, or let me know no night.
Inspire my heart [O God] and make it* lad
Always in thee, or make it always sad;
If thou affict'st me, make me understand,
Thou have a storming and a calming hand;
If Poverty oppress me, whilst I live,
Oh let thy mercy send me friends to give,
Or if thy goodness please to send me store
O give me grace to think I may be poor,
It matters not, O Lord, how poor I be
Unto the world, if I am rich to thee;
If I am hungry, ^ be thou my meat,
If I am weary, ^ be thou my seat;
Or if I feast, O Lord, be thou my guest;
If I am restless, Lord, be thou my rest;
If I am thirsty, Lord, be thou my spring
If I am subject, Lord, be thou my King;
If I have virtue make me dote upon her
If Honorable, be thou my honor:
And if I cannot know that which I would,
Be pleased to make me know, Lord, what I should;
Then shall my ready lips express and show
I know no more, then thou would have me know
My untied tongue shall evermore proclaim
The attendant glories of thy sacred Name.
The sacrifice of y^ ^icked is an abomination to the Lord, ^^^ the (...) of the
^pright is his delight. Pro: 15. 8
