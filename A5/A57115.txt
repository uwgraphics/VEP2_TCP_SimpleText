BRACTEOLA AVRE^ OR, FILINGS OF GOLD DRAWN From the Life and Death of that
LOVELY CHILD, MRIS. JOANNA REYNELL Who died the 26. of January, 1662.

Worthy of Observation and Imitation.

By E. R. Esquire.

MAT. 19.13. And Jesus said, suffer little Children to come unto me: for of
su^^ is the Kingdom of Heaven. Just. Mart. Epist. ad Zenam. Women ought to take
care of their Children, for of such is the Kingdom of God. LONDON, Printed by

THE EPISTLE TO THE READER
THough these few Leafs seem not to invite Epistle; yet [in the midst of the
variety Tempers, they are like to meet with] i^ not unlikely, but that some
[who flatter their or Opinion, and extort the utmost of their belief their own
sense, and who adventure to read and intepret their own meaning with censorious
and prejudic^ conjectures] may cast an ^cterical eye upon (...) meanness of
this Subject: I thought fit to acquai^^ thee (courteous Reader) that, as the
vessels appointed for the use of the Temple, were not all of one ^i^ness,
[though none unuseful] so God, who despise^ not the day of small things]
judges those things Greatest, which are most Gracious, and is often pleased
[as to lodge Pearls in Cockles, so] to bestow the Treasures of heavenly
knowledge on the meanest persons. And [as Stars that have least Circuit A^tas
est pe^fecta, u^i vi^tus est (...).
are nearest the Pole] so, out of the mouth of ^bes and Sucklings does God
often show forth his ^ise.

Besides, how great do we find the tender care and re^rd of our blessed Savior
toward the children of his ^^gdom! Mark 10.14. and 9.36, 37. How displeased ^s
he with those that withheld them from him? he took ^m up in his arms, he put
his hand upon them; and bles^^ them, and said, that whosoever received such in
his ^^me, received him, Mar. 10.15. Nay, [in return of that ^^ld demand of the
Disciples] that, without they became (...) such, they should not enter therein.
It was the saying (...) one, that, he had rather have the Feeling that simple
soul has with God, then all the learning (...) the Philosophers: and hence is
it, that another ^lleth one, that has arrived to this degree of hapness, a
little Diety conversing in amortal Flesh. ^lem. Alex.

Scaliger reports of himself, that he never read of ^e death of Socrates, but
he wept; and truly, those ^ho well knew this hopeful Child, will hardly forbear
(...) do the like. Neither [though long clouded in silence without the least
intent of making it Publick] can I choose ^^t throw this drooping Flower after
her hearse; such ^^eing her unheard of forwardness, [especially in hea^enly
things, wherein I have rather gleaned, then ga^^ered a full harvest] and such
the importunity of ^ose who desire to preserve her Memory, with my own ^esire
of manifesting Gods Power in so much weakness: (...) whose Glory I wholly
devote it.

We have more need of Patterns then Precepts: and (...) is observable in
Children, [as in other things] to imitate their like: and being first taken
with an outside, may [understanding after, that it relates (...) one like
themselves] have the greater desire of reading and being familiar with it: and
[at last] make tha^ which seems a Recreation, to be of greater use an^ benefit.

And though it pleased God (here) to blast her innocent joys; and the
still-fading Flowers of the merrie^ portion of her life, seem to have been
sullied [through^ pain and sickness] with tears and sadness, yet her son
[having left the enclosure of her body] has now exchanged her Militancy below,
for a Mansion more glorious in heaven: Neither can I conclude with a better
Caution, then in that of our Saviors words, Tak^ heed how you despise any of
these little ones.

Bracteola Aurea, OR FILINGS of GOLD.
TO write the lines of our departed Frien^ (especially if more then ordinarily
em^nent in the Church of God) is a custom no less Ancient then approved,
where^^ the Ties of Affection are retaliated, and the Bom^ of Love discharged;
it being Gods course to lead (...) in the short passage of our earthly
Pilgrimage her^ sometimes by the ways of Discipline and Mortific^tion,
sometimes by the ways of Mourning a^^ Lamentation; and also by the Examples of
good a^^ bad Presidents, whereby to incite to virtue, a^^ dissuade from vice;
we having more need of Examples, then precepts, to prevent us from the C^reers
of Sin, and to lead us aright under the shado^ of this worlds vanity.

Grace does not cut off the affections of Nature but rather Ripen them; and
Relations make goo^ men more passionate, and to speak feelingly of the Death of
their Friends, whose perfections should press some Tears from our eyes, and to
say with the ^^ophet, Is Jonathan gone? he shall still breath in ^y soul:
Neither does God lose his Relations (...) the Death of his Saints, Josua 1.2.
John ^.11.

And surely it is much of Religion, to take notice (...) Gods choicest vessels,
and such as are most dear unto him, by the Egregia virtutis ^empla veluti
lu^min edito ponenda ^^t, ut omnibus ^eluceant, etc.
Example of an holy, and Religious life; the which (through an impulsive power)
not only gives luster and reputation, but carries with it a most lively Feature
of Divine Resemblance, and the Characters of Divinity; yea the Pat^^rns of the
virtuous, we find (by some) to be cal^^d the seeds of Eternity.

Neither (omitting what we find in other Histo^^es) do we want a plentiful
storehouse of Scrip^^re Presidents, the spirit of God being very large in
^^eir praise. The Jews could not forget their good ^enturion, Luke 7.5. and the
Widows (having ^^^st washed their Dorcas, and laid her forth with ^^eir Tears)
showed the Coats and Garments she ^^d made them, Act. 9.29. Yea, so vigorous do
we ^^de the Examples of great Personages, as that ^^ey are sometimes called
Angels of God, and Lights (...) the people, 2 Samuel 14.17. and 21.17.

How much then does it import to enter into ^^ose Lists, in which Gracious
souls have run their ^^urse? whose lives instruct, whose Deaths teach, ^^d
whose works follow them! there being no better ^ordiall to comfort the Friends
of the departed, or (...) revive their drooping Souls, then by this way (...)
making them alive.

The Egyptians spent much time, and cost i^ Embalming their Friends, and
building their Tombs as sondly conceiving that they were to remain longer in
them then in their houses; and yet all thi^ while they did but lay them with
their Faces downwards; the Imitation of their virtues being the bes^ way to
preserve, and maintain a Familiarity wit^ them in their Graves: The righteous
(says David) shall be had in everlasting Remembrance: Yea the Evangelical
Prophet thinks it a thing very worthy to be laid to heart, that the Esa. 57.1.
Righteous perish, and n^ man considers it.

If a good life then be the best Monument, and those Memories stand fastest,
which are founded o^ the Rock of virtue and Religion [all others decaying which
are laid in the foundred Bottom of worldly vanity] how sad is it to observe,
that strange kind of under-valuing the memory of the Dead [so highly recorded
by the spirit of God] which float^ in the Fancies of some who are downright
Satyrist^ against their deserved Praise! yea, how soon (alas!) do they leave
off chafing the Temples of their Friends no way considering, how good it is to
begin, and end, all our Actions with the Meditation of our Dust, whereby Nature
[at first] gave us beginning, and Death [at last] will put an end to all our
eathly travel and misery!

And so far are many from desiring here (with Philip of Macedon) to be minded
of their Mortality, and departure hence, as that rather (with that Jews 11.^
French Prince) they command their servants not so much as to mention Death; as
(...) no care were to be taken before our earthly lodg^^gs grow rotten, the
foundation sinks, the Fur^ture becomes moath-eaten, and the whole structure
begins to fall about our Ears. Yea, how often ^alas!] do we defer the welfare
and happiness of ^ur Soul, until Years approach, Physicians grow im^otent, the
Evening star of our life begins to appear, our Sinews shrink, our blood
congeals, the Bells tod, the winders are in our sight, Death strikes ^t our
heart, and a aying hana is only left us to be^ueath away all we have; this
being but a bad ^^me, to provide for the great Birth day of Eter^ity.

The greatest work we have to finish in this world, (...) to die well, and to
make a happy departure out of ^t, whereby we leave the world before it leaves
us, and give Death our hand as a welcome Messenger, not as an affrightfull
Serieant; it is good [early] to ^e familiar with it, and to take notice of all
its approaches, by the dissolution of others; there being ^omething of benefit
to be reaped by our Neigh^orus departure. Not a Passing Bell, but (like Genesis
49.1.
Jacob calling to his sons) serves to mind us, our turn may be next; nor is
there a Corpse carried to be buried, and said in its last resting place, but
being dead yet speaks, yea preaches our Funeral Sermon.

Besides, though we have lost the sight of our friends, yet not our Affections,
(says St. Quamquam separati sumus aspectu, non tamen Affectibus; S. Ambrose.
Ambrose) we ought not to part with them so soon as natur^^ parts with them; or
to throw away all our acquaintance with the Grave-shovell; but still to
maintain that intimacy of Affection which we find warrantable from the word of
Truth; our Savior, being pleased to call Lazarus his Friend, though he were in
his Grave, John 11.11. And Moses wa^ still the servant of God [though dead]
Joshu^ 1.1.

Neither can I believe, that those whose pulse o^ Affections so soon leaves
beating [under what color or pretense so ever] as not to bestow one sigh o^
Tear, to besprinkle the urne of their departe^ Friends, have found the right
way of committing them to the earth; though not foolishly to discharg^ the
surplusage of our Passions on our selve^ [which would prove rather Heathenish,
then Christian-like] or by an over amorous Devotion to preserve the Relics of
our departed Friends, whereby tha^ which [at first] was but the Picture of a
Friend (in time) grows to a false God.

That tears are a Tribute due to the Genesis 37.3^
Dead, w^ we find in the Father of the Faithful; and weeping Jacob would not
be comforted, but said, Surely, I will go down into the grave unto my Son
mourning. Neither shall we be unfurnished of occasions for grief, from the
Cradle to the Grave, while we are here in this valley of Tears.

We are here encompassed with several sorts o^ Tears; we have our Repenting
Tears, we have our Lacrym^ poenitentiae^
fellow-feling Tears, but (above all) our Lacryma com^ssionis, Lacry^ae Doloris.
Grief Tears are those which seem most to affect: these are they which (like
low grounds) still make us moist, and watery: These are they which make the
Prologue of our life ^eeping, the Act of our life weeping, and whose Epilogue
still ends in weeping.

We hear one (with the widows son) crying ^^y head, my head! Another (with
the Children of ^e Prophets) moaning my belly, my belly! yonder ^ands one (with
David) lamenting my Son, my ^ou! here another (with Elisha) crying out my
^ather, my Father! one groaning (with Hezekiah) under the burden of his
sickness; another (with ^achel) bewayling her Children and will not be
^omforted. Yea, we find the height of grief expressed in Scripture, by one
that mourns for his on^y Son: and the spirit of God making it as it were a
^^ing impossible for a Mother to forget her Child. Esa. ^9.15.

We read of St. Ambrose, that he lamented the Death of Valentinian and Gratian,
as if he had ^ost both his Eyes; and again (speaking of his dear Brother Velut
ocu^s m^hi de^^ssos do lco, ^t. Amb. de ^bi. Satyr.
Satyrus) he says, Can I ever forget thee with whom I have spent out my life?
any we find the Prophet setting it forth, as a Curse to die unlamented, Jer.
22.18, 19. and that passage ^n the Prophet Zachary [that that dies, let it
die] Zach. 11.9. is held by him as a Malediction; being as much as to say, let
it do no good in dying, which seems also to agree with that of the Apostle who
tells us that Trees without Fruit are called twice dead; an^ truly, its a kind
of second death, if none living b^ the better for us.

And do we not find the Prophet as it were calling back Elias out of the
Clouds; so unwilling wa^ he to let him go but still to have him in his sight
(...) not like those who so soon part with their friend (laying them with their
Faces downward) as i^ [being dead] they live no longer to them; the Affection
of the one expiring with the breath of the other, and both breathing out their
last together.

But what need we more? when [certainly] we have the best of Patterns for our
Tears, Joh. 11.35. so as we greive not like those without hope, 1 Thessalonians 4.13.
who was known to groan and weep, but never to laugh. He inquired of all those
that passed by, whether any sorrow were like his sorrow? Lam. 1^ Nay we find
his soul exceeding sorrowful, even to the Death, Mat. 26.30.

He bids us [indeed] sometimes to rejoice, but in what? except out reproaches.
St. Paul had his Joy, but it was in his Afflictions; and the Martyrs had their
Joy, but dull flesh was not the object; it was in their sufferings; this kind
of joy, must be sown in Tears, and we must wait for it, till the Harvest come;
until Heaven be our dwelling, incorruption our change, the Angels our
Partners, and Immortality our Garment.

Those (indeed) which do here make Earth their Heaven, and are not acquainted
with the Music which is in the groans of the Afflicted, nor what Beauty is in
the Tears of the Mourners, would wonder [or at least wise think him Frantic,
if not mistaken in his way] who should knock at a Gravestone for a Companion;
or should go down into a Vault or Char^ell house to make Merry; And yet even
hence may we draw instruction of Piety, and by the Meditation of the Death of
our friends [whereby God [for our correction and instruction] is pleased often
to chastise us in our nearest Relations, and to open a Vein in the Arm for the
curing of the head] produce a better life to our selves.

And certainly, its a Bad Flower, out of which we cannot suck some honey,
tending to the benefit and advantage of our soul; and an unskilful Gardner,
which will not [this way] allow some Thorns and Thistles to hedge in the Garden
of his Soul, from the wasting Creatures of sin and wickedness; yea surely its
a weak Stomach which cannot patiently look on a Death's Head in the midst of a
Feast; and a worse App^tite which cannot sometimes be content to feed on a
Commons of Dry-Bones, with the Meditation of Mortality.

Mistake me not; I do not say we should so hang down our Heads, as that,
because Earth ought not to be our Resting place, we should therefore make ^it
our Hell; Neither do I invite any [more then out of Religious observation] to
seek for the living among the Dead; or to go down [with me] into the vault of
this departed Child (which would be no other then as the mourning we read of
the feined woman, 2 Samuel 14.2.) but only to preserve their Graces, and recount
the Passages of their life; that so, though we cannot still behold them, we may
stand Remembrancers of their worth.

But not to let my Pen too far digress, neither make too great a stay in the
Porch or entrance, before we approach the house, by showing you how Jsaac
mourned three years over his Mother; Jacob, 22. years over his Son; nor (as
some Rabbines would tell us) that Adam mourned 100 years for his Son Ab^^;
Neither that the Jews were wont to hire men for to lament their Dead (who cut,
and pricked themselves that they mi^^^ weep in earnest) let it be enough that
there is a Time of weeping appointed by God. Eccles. 3.4. That there is a
Bochim and Valley or Tears, where we ought sometimes to life up our voices, and
weep: yea, a Marah, which occasions bitterness of Soul, and (as at present)
fills our hearts, and eyes full of weeping, and lamenting: To which, after have
we once given their full scope, they will grow the more easy and lighter; And
happy are we, if we can so refresh our heaviness by our Tears, as to cleanse
that fountain of Sin, which is ever and anon offering us the sad occasions of
our Grief and sorrow.

But now, to write the life and Death of a Child, in an Age which affords so
many Presidents of worth and larger Endowments, may (to some) seem as strange
as unusual; to whom I answer that, at as est perfecta, ubi^virtus est perfecta;
Age is perfect where virtue is perfect; and that God ( who despises not the
day of small things but whosoever works Ri^hteousnesse is accepted with him)
always judges those things greatest, which are most gra^ious; the less we
seem to our selves, the greater we are with him, and the safest Discendend a
c^oe lum ascenditur: Cassiodorus.
ascent to Heaven is by the acknowledgment of our own Nothingnesse,

Our blessed Savior (who was the Oracle of Truth it self, and who came not to
break the bruised reed, nor to quench the smoking flax, Mat. 19.13.) was
pleased to receive, and bless those Children which were brought unto him; yea,
to tell his Disciples [plainly] who were (or should have been) the wisest of
men (in regard of the many wonders and Miracles they saw, and the constant
familiarity they had with their Lord and Master) that, unless they became as
^ittle Children, they should not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Mark 10.14,
15. and were fain to to have the Pattern of a little child held forth unto them
to abate height of their thoughts, and to teach them humility, and lowliness.

Whereby we see, that, should we look for perfection in the best of Gods
Servants [nothing being here absolutely so [we should find the failings of good
men, ready to produce a restraint of their their Graces; no Gold being without
its dross, nor Corn without its Tares. And how happy were it for many [poor
souls!] who stand so much upon the uprightness of their hearts and lives
[being rather objects of grief and pity, their Bodies being so near their
graves, and their souls no way provided for Heaven] if they had but the
acquaintance with Death, which this poor Child had!

Nor let the shortness of her Age, any way deter from the Imitation of her
virtues, she being so richly endowed with the Innocence of Childhood and
beginning so soon to live to God, to learn the Scriptures of a Child, 2 Timothy
3.15. and to remember her Creator in the days of her Youth, Eccle^ 12.1. yea,
in the dawn and morning of her few days did she begin to suck in the milk of
Gods wor^ (as it were) with the milk of her Nurse; and [b^ her early Fruits]
seemed [there] so to settl^ her Virgin Love, as that (had it pleased God to
have afforded her longer life) she gave great hopes of proving herself very
instrumental in his Church.

And that she had a love to Gods house, appeared by her often enquiry in the
week days, when she should go to the Church; and her earnestness to go
thither, as if God (who has milk for Children as well as stronger meat for
those that are of a full Age, Heb. 5.13, 14.) had informed her Soul, how
pleasing a thing it was to him, to come early into his vineyard; and (however
she endured not the heat of the Day) has now [no doubt] given her, her Reward;
the vessels appointed for the service of his Temple, being not all of one
Bigness, yet none unuseful.

Her fear of taking Gods name in vain, was also very observable; she was not
only very cautious her self, but has been often heard to reprove others;
^cquainting them with the danger thereof, which was a true sign of that
heavenly wisdom, whereof the fear of the Lord is the beginning.

Her desire also of Schooling arboad, of reading praying, and being Chatechized
at home, was well ^own to those which were about her; wherein (...) would often
entreat others to help and instruct ^^er; which greatly took her off from
mispending ^^at time (whereof she had little to employ) which otherwise] might
have been spent in the vanities of Childhood.

Her dutifulness to her Parents, was likewise to ^e noted; how careful was she
to please them? how ^earful to offend them? how ready to obey them (...) ^he
which [as we find it an honor to the (2 John 4.^ Elect Lady, that all her
Children walked in the Truth] must needs be a comfort to them, to have ^uch an
Olive Branch about their Table.

Very watchful and fearful she was to do evil (...) and which she would not
only seem to check in herself (when through weakness or tenderness of nature,
she was at any time made sensible of such frail ^ies as are incident to the
oversights of Childhood) ^ut even stand wondering at others; and (as much a may
be) in her words, and Gestures] reprove tha^ in them, which she seemed so much
to dislike i^ ^her self.

Neither [had God pleased to lengthen her life was her peaceable disp^sition
likely to have proved the least Jewel in the Diadem of her virtues; making
(...) (as it were) her study in her health [but especial her sickness,) as
appeared by her many expressions (...) those about her, to be quiet, which
(wit^ much earnestness) she often repeated, thereby seeming to invite us to
that Gospel-rule of living pea^ably with all men, 1 These. 4.11. being a duty
necessary, as wanting in the general course of o^ lives.

When she saw any Poor, it should go hard but she would find something to
supply and (...) fresh them. And when she heard of any that we sick in the
Family [whether Servants or other how tender, and tending would she be (eve^
with seariousnesse of advice, and with su^ sweet specches of comfort, as
out-went many wh^ had spent more years in the world; saying it w^ Gods will, we
should be sick, it was for our good, a^ that God could send sickness or death
to her also, if (...) pleased so to do!

What shall I say? she was a Child [or rather a w^ man] in whom did appear so
much of perfection, an^ a Divine Soul, as has been seldom known at h^^ Age;
yea, she was as a little world, wherein w^ contained a lively Map of heavenly
Graces. Nature [or rather the God of Nature] baving endowed he (as with the
Innocence of Childhood, so) wit^ the apparent signs of grace in her old age,
she being of a composed spirit, and heavenly temper; (...) a quick wit, and
active Body; modest in her ca^^ riage, solid in her behavior; of a sweet,
wining and affable demeanor and disposition; fa^ miliar, and loving to all; by
whom she was a^ gain as generally beloved, and at her Death as much Lamented.

Her sickness was long and teadious [near twenty ^eeks] her pain, and lingering
fits were many, and ^t sighs, and groans (at times) not a few. Yet oh! ^ith
what abundanc of patience did she overcome ^^em? Ah! with what mildness and
chearfullnesse, ^^d she undergo, and pour our, her short and deep ^tch't
breath, which still threatened the approaching ^f that last Enemy which Nature
so much struggles ^ith; though (to her) seeming no way Dreadful, (...) the
many, long and teadious assaults that Death ^ade upon her!

Or if [through continued wea^inesse, and pain] (...) might in the midst of
some violent distemper ^^em to be troubled in her Imagination, sure it ^as no
way, in her memory; the which [without ^^e least disturbance in her Soul)
lasted even to the ^^st h^ur, and wherein the goodness of God was ex^ress'd,
since diseases (like merciless Thieves) rob ^any of their senses on their
Deaths-beds, when they ^^ve most need of them, and often fall into ^eat
outragiousnesse and blaspheaming even of God ^^mself!

Neither is long sickness to be looked on as a sign ^f Gods anger (the delays
of whose favors are not ^lways a Refusal] who often differs his cure, where^y
to raise from Death; and suffers his Children ^oftentimes) to fall into
lingering sicknesses, for ^eir better Repentance, and to teach them that ^^eir
Bodies are not free from Infirmities, and to ^^e end that those who are
Exemplary in their lives, [the Saints of God (as we find in Scripture^ being
best at their Ends, and the living speecues (...) dying Christians usually best
remembered, and mo^^ regarded] should (through his strength, and their own
patience) show something Remarkable in their sickness, and Death.

And though she was long going to her journeys end^ yet seemed she no way
tired, with the length thereof [the true Temper of a Christian in dying] but
was well contented to wait his leisure, whose appointed time [questionlesse]
was the best for her, and whose submission to his will made her Bed seem so
easy in her sickness.

It was a rare thing to observe in a Child such an heavenly comportment in
sickness, and even contempt of her ensueing Death! to see her, how she lay in
the time of her sickness! with what undauntednesse of spirit, yet humble
meekness! How she held her peace (I mean in any way of murmuring or impatient
repining against him, whose doing it was! no distracted gesture being seen in
her countenance, nor to be read in her complaining; not so much as letting an
eye [as it were] to roll amiss, though (perchance) she had many hard
encounters, and did oftentimes wrestle with many strong and violent Conflicts,
so that as Death (which embitters all the comforts of this life to the wicked
(God se^retly standing by her, and making her to overcome at last) was to her
not only sweet but welcome; ^d of whole future happiness (though lying many
^eeks sick, like a Princess in a ruinous house she que^onlesse) saw a glimps,
through the chincks of a ^^cknesse-broken Body.

Neither could she choose but smile upon Death ^aving (as it were) from her very
Infancy, by a ^ontinual exercise in virtue triumphed over Sin, which only makes
Death to be formidable. And though she saw Death making toward her, and often
heard those that came to see her, to question her Recovery, by the
incureablenesse of her disease; yet was she not seen to make the least change
in ^er countenance, or ever to express the least diffi^ence in Gods help
toward her Recovery; but ^ather, a holy readiness by Death [yet very ^arefull
in observing all means tending to pre^^rve a longer life] whereby to enjoy the
presence of him she so often called on in her sickness (...) even her good
God] and which (with much ^arnestnesse of spirit) she often repeated, and
ex^ected health from; as well knowing she was in the Arms of life, and should
[at last] finish her ^ourse with joy.

But before the Candle of her life was put out, the Minister coming to see her,
she took him by the hand, and desired him to pray for her; which was twice
powerfully done the next Sabbath Day, not without the pouring out of many
sighs, and the shedding of many Tears, by those that were then present. And
however God was not pleased [whose ways are passed finding out, and often uses
to exercise our, patience] to give an answerable Return in regard of her
Recovery (intending her for himself yet was she afterward endowed with
unspeakabl^ comfort and patience, even to her last Breath. I being impossible
[as St. Ambrose told St. Austin^ Mother] that a Child of so many Prayers should
miscarry.

Neither could it be any thing else which made he^ to show so meek and quiet a
deportment in tha^ work of Dying, but her being satisfied with the heavenly
Manna of her Saviors presence, and that sight of heaven, which in a more then
ordinary way strengthened her toward her long Journey; and where she plainly
foresaw, all Tears an^ sighs should be wiped away from her eyes, and every fit
of sickness should have its peculiar Crown.

When her spirits began to fail, and to lose ground of their usual quickness,
and her speech began to fail, her inward strength [no doubt] increased, while
her outward decayed. Nor may we conclude other, but that [so long as Nature was
pleased to fan a little breath into her Nostrills] great was the comfort
between God and her Soul, who is the best Interpreter of the heart; and who at
last gently drew out her Breath, and (as it were) led her by the hand into that
Mansion he had prepared for her; like a Tree laden with abundance of Fruit,
and having a Spirit too full of splendor to be longer obscured in a cloud of
Flesh.

And after her Soul was gone a Sacrifice to Hea^^n, with how cheerful and
smiling a counte^ance, did she look; as if [even then] at her de^^rture hence,
she had had some sweet conference ^ith her Savior and his blessed Angels [who
are ^id to take care of little Children, Mat. 18.10.] she ^^emed no other
[after her panting and long-fetch't reath] then as one that was refreshed with
the ^eep of death, yea all those that behel'd her, said ^^at she never looked
fairer then in her mourning Dress and attire, Ah! how pleasingly did she ^^ok,
when she lay disroabed of all her sin, and ^^rrows it brought with it? there
being then neither ^^gh nor groan, neither grief nor pain to perplex her ^uiet
Soul, which was then newly fled to heaven ^ith the white wings of her Dovelike
Inno^ency.

Nor need those that came to deck her, bring any ^lowers [which in her life
time she so much delight^d, and took pleasure in] or to spend any time in
^dorning that pretty piece, in the sweetness of those smiling looks there
appeared such a pleasant ^^ring of Roses, and lillies, which had overspread
^^er lips and Cheeks; neither wanted a Garland to ^race her at her Death,
having in her life time been ^eautified with the Flowers of a more lasting
condi^ion.

Insomuch, as that when she had put off the cloths ^f her Mortality, how did
all think (or at least ^^tive to keep) her alive in their Reports (while others
thought Death too cruel) out of that affection, which still made them to kindle
new hopes of her life, at every spark of probability!

But as the fairesh, and sweetest The Text at her Funeral, Job. 14.1, 2.
Flower is of a fading condition, and subject to be cast down; so how soon
(alas!) had this new born light attained its full aged Noon? Ah! behold, how
soon the shadow-flying-days of her life consumed? how quickly the blace of her
short Pilgrimage expired? she budded, she Blossomed, and was in her Prime
(being like a Rose newly blown and gatherd) between the saeventh and eighth
year of her Age.

But this Diamond must be set in clay, and the rarest Jewels (like earthen
Vessels) at last dissolve and turn to dust. The best gold must have its trial,
and the purest corn must first die before it spring. That so good a Child
should die, has matter of grief in it; but that she died so good has some
recompense of comfort with it: That she was cut off in the Bud, and First Age
of her harmless Innocence, may some way seem to carry sorrow with it; but that
she so much gains by her change, is only taken hence to be freed from further
Miseries, has comfort and solace in it, far above our sorrow; and though in
the one our loss seems to call for Tears, yet in the other her gain allows
us the breathing of Joy; being (by Death) only taken from the shadows and
falsehoods of a wretched world, to enjoy the real Glories of Heaven; and to be
enrolled in the golden Catalogue of the Children of her Saviors Kingdom.

In the mean time, her Grave is but a Bed of Roses where her Rest will be
sweet, and her Night-Cloaths, at last taken off. Though God please to turn us
to ashes, he will not turn us to nothing, our ashes being only more sacred, and
God (who is the keeper of our Dust, out of which he first made us) will out of
them again restore us: Yea he who takes care of every hair of our head (being
living,) does the same of every grain of our ashes [being dead] we shall again
meet with our old Bodies, which are but for a time placed in Gods withdrawing-
Room, or laid to sleep in Lazarus Bed.

She died about the approaching of the Spring, when the Birds and Flowers
(which she so much affected) seemed to deck her Hearse, and to sing her Elegy,
breathing out her pure and divine soul in that peaceable, calm, and
comfortable manner, as that she taught the standers by, no less virtuously how
to die, then she had formerly how to live; leaving (as it were) a maked, and
disconsolate House behind her (in respect of her affable carriage, and loving
disposition) to all that came afterward, and found her wanting.

But though the Night of Death have overtaken her, let us not suffer her so to
depart from us; but to let her always live in our Memory; she was once (indeed)
more properly ours, but is now a Jewel set in Christ's Diadem (who has but
taken his own) yet have we her still by commemorating, imitating, and very
highly (in love esteeming) what we saw remarkable in her life.

God is pleased to honor them that honor him, and to continue a good Report
to a good life; God looking on her (then) with the eye of his Favor, may she
still so remain in our sight; and as she was the Object of our wishes in her
life, so let her now be the subject of our practice in her Death, wherein she
still speaks, and is a voice to her friends and Relations, the Memory of our
departed friends being like a Legative Ring, which nothing but Death should
pluck off from our Fingers.

And seeing, that when we drop into our Graves, a Funeral drowns all our
delights [which like Vermin run away, when the house is falling] may these
(then) serve as a Ha^d-k^rcheif to wipe off the Tears, and as a Bracelet to
wear about the Arms of all those that knew, and related to this Child; to whom
she is still speaking, though the night of Death has turned her Midday into
Darkness.

Neither let any wonder [my soul being more then usually vaild with the Blacks
of sorrow] if I strew one Flower more then ordinary on her Hearse, or if I
besprinckle her urne with some Tears, and once again descend the vault, to
touch the shrine of this so greatly beloved, and lamented Child, whom God
(whose Almighty power is still guided by a most wise providence, and tempered
with a Fatherly love) was pleased so shortly to call after her departed Brother.

Her Brother did I say? Ah! stay gentle Reader! and once more here let fall thy
Tears; Ah! let me forbear a little, least my greifs bleed afresh, and I too
dearly prize that name, by calling to remembrance that black night which
ushered in so sad a day.

And should I again begin, I should but repeat what I have written, and renew a
fresh that Sorrow which may be (in part) forgotten, he being also the joy of
his Parents, the Delight of his Friends, the hopes of his Country, the life of
his name, and (in those before mentioned virtues of love, meekness, and
sweetness of disposition and heavenly Inclination; and who (with his own) did
even carry out souls away) her nearest Parallel.

There being no Division which could make them two, in virtue or Amity; being
both alike, as well in Person, as carriage: Dying both about the same Age, of
the same s^cknesse; ^ying sick the same space of time, and near the same season
of the year, having both their The Text at his Funeral, Pro. 14.32.
hope in Death.

And may I not say (as it was once) in the words of David, 2 Samuel 1.23. They
were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their Death they were not
divided, now shining (no doubt) like Natures Gemeini, in the clea^ Horison of
Heaven and happiness. And whose Tear-dew'd Hearses [being sent hence, with
abundance of sighs, having passed the various storms of this world, and left
their earthly Receptacles] lie buried both together in the vault at East-Ogwel
^n Devon! whence (their Souls being already transmitted to those heavenly
comforts they own enjoy) their Bodies expect the re-uniting of those Ashes,
which (in the mean time) are carefully preserved by that Omnipotent hand, which
first brought them together, and will a^ last give them a blessed and happy
meeting to all Eternity.

FINIS.
