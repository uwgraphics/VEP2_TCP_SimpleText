A PILLAR Erected to the Memorial of Popish-Nat, showing how unlike the Best,
and how like the worst of Men he is. 21. Feb. 1682/3
IN Holy-Record we do read,
Of a Nathaniel indeed;
A Man of Christ gave that Style,
An Israelite in whom's no Guile.
Our day yields a Nathaniel,
A Popish-Brat, Spewed out of Hell;
A Man that is in very Deed,
The offspring of the Serpents Seed.
His Malice notes him void of Grace,
His Lying does show he is of that Race;
For as the Serpent spoke at first,
To Man of God, but made him Cursed.
So does this Man speak Loyalty,
That Law and Gospel would destroy;
He Serpent-like, at heels does bite,
Of those whose Heads he cannot smite.
He feeds on Dust, but gapes for Blood,
A Man of note, but not for good;
You this vile person may compare,
with worst that either were or are.
For if with Ca^n you do begin,
This Man surpasses him for sin;
In wrath his Brother he did slay,
This in cold Blood kills evesy day:
His Vipers Tongue kills by his word,
More than he can do with drawn Sword.
When Lamech once a Man had killed,
His Conscience was with horror filled;
Tho this Man's Tongue be fully bent,
To kill and slay the Innocent;
Yet he his Conscience does so sear,
That he not God, nor Judgment fear.
Read of the World that once was drowned,
and no such one was in it found;
Nay, search the New and you will see,
Few with this Man compared can be.
If cursed Ham did so Transgress,
To see his Fathers Nakedness;
How guilty is he that does Aim,
To see and Trumpet all Men's Shame;
Yea, Loyal Peers, that Fathers be,
Their shame this Man does long to see;
And like to a Trumpet he does found,
Those Guilty, that are Guiltless found
Like Nimrods Dog with open Throat
This Hound hunts fiercely for the Pope;
He loud does baul upon the Scent,
Of Juries and of Parliament;
As though his hopes were, that he may
Have blood of such to be his Prey.
For scoffing he is an Ishmael,
With Esau can his Birthright sell;
We read of none so Active found,
In Egypt, Israel to drowned;
As this home Satan does provoke,
To be the Agent of the Pope.
The Corah and Abiram were,
Not with this Man for to compare;
For though the Earth this wretch does bear
Hell will Erelong gape for him their;
He for the Pope would Isarael Curse,
As Balaam would have done or worse,
And longs for Altars to Devine,
His familiars there to find;
But the mean time he will advertise,
To join with Romes Idolatrys,
To pass the Cananites tho he;
Of that Cursed Race is Judged to be.
To Doeg next we will have like,
Who did at Priest and Profit strike;
So against Priest and Patron he,
The Popes Informer longs to be.
Sanballat and Tobia are,
The meetest with him to Compare?
Who by Libels Void of reason,
Speak that worship must be Treason.
Like Hammon he does long to slay,
The Jews, and to hang Mordicay;
Tho Justice may in time him bring,
on his own Gallows for to swing.
The Rulers Could not in Christ's day,
Find such a one him to betray;
Till Satan had in Judas got,
As into this to sham the Plot.
Nay Judas like, give him his due,
He Will Crucify, the Lord a new;
And Judas like at last may burst,
Yea, hang himself and be Acurst.
The Coppor Smith did not that wrong,
As this man has done with his tongue;
Elimus like his Cursed mouth,
Would Rulers fain pervert for truth
He like Demetryus does cry,
For Remes Diana to be high.
As if the world must still adore,
That old face Ill looked Scarlet Whore;
Before we do Conclude it is fit,
To show whare Not has got this wit.
It is Infused to him from hell,
By Satan that does in him dwell
Who of a Serpent did make Use,
At first man's fall to Introduce
But a more Subtle way does take,
And use of this Vile man does make?
By which the Devils Priests and he,
Are grown so Intimate to be;
That by the most he is known full well,
To be the devils Oracle;
And would have all men for to be,
Slaves to the Pope as well as he.
But in that Slavery we'll him leave.
The Devils Wages to receive
And unto his perpetual shame
The Devils Ass let be his name.
