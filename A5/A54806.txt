READER,
WOnder not to see me Spel, as thy self daily speak, and hear others
sound words. I have heet indevored to spel as we sp^ak, for the advantag' sak
which I know will thereby ens^ if practiced, I. To Children in learning to read,
whose tender capacitys ar over charged, memorys bu^ thene I and dul'd with harsh
spel-ing, by which they at kept longer in learning.

II. To Men and Women in writing; who tho they have learnd to read well enuf,
when they comto wryt, ar at a los how to spel aryt, as its cal-ed.

III. To strangers in learning English, who ar discoraged and almost put out of
hops of ever learning to speak, read and wryt good English; And all this only
throuh the present harsh manner of spel-ing, s^ars to be comprysd in Ruls,
which is the only means strangers ab^oad, have for learning to speak, and for all, tho in England, to read and wryt true English. Besyds the multituds of
superfluos Letters; in the present Speli-ng, al which is amended and avoided by
spel-ing and writing simply as we speak: As no les than 5. in the word
Righteousness (as thus commonly spelt) ar avoided by spel-ing it thus.
Ryteosnes, and no les then 3. 0^ 6. letters in the word Though, spelt thus Tho.
Which do as perfectly sound the words as the other tho ny twys so many letters.
Wherefore I have thus don, 1. Ch^efly f^r the benefit of strangers, in all words in
which the letter (i) is sounded as (y) which no other Nation, but ours does; I
have used (y). The old English way, throuh chang' of which, into (i), such
confusion is happend in sounding that letter, somtyms on way, as in King,
Thing, etc. and somtyms another way as in Kind, Mind, Child, etc. that a
stranger cannot by Ruls be tauht when to sound it as in the former words
softly, or as in the latter words fully as (y). Which being spelt with (y).
K^nd, Child, etc. is remedied,

2. The letter (e) where it is mut and makes not a syllabl, but only the former
syllabl^long, I ^ay left out; strangers commonly in that cas pronouncing mor
syllabls, th^n there ar, as ti-me for time, lo-ve for love, ti-mes for times,
etc. Which being writ-en tym, lov, tyms, etc. there is but on syllabl for them
to sound. And how is it possibl, otherwys to giv certain Ruls when to sound the
(e) and when not; seeing in the word plases; it must; and in times, it must not
be sounded? And for compensing the us of the (e) viz. of distinguish a short
from a long syllabl, I have often used the Accents ((...)) or ((...)). Which does
again distinguish (as e did) betwixt words of dyvers significations, tho of the
sam letters. As mad from made, thus, mad. hat from hate, thus, ^at. on from one
thus, on us from use, thus, us. Which yet ar sufficiently distinguished by the
se^s.

3. Where any other letters may be spared in the midst or end of words, I have
left them out. Viz. al doubel letters in the end as bless, cali, will,
blessing, willing, etc. (a) in bread, dead, dread, etc. (p) in contempt,
temptation, redemption; etc. (u) in labor, favor; etc. (g) in plough,
through, thought; and. (gh) in high, light, might^ etc. Thus m^t, lyt, thouht,
throuh, favor, labor, redemtion, temtation, ded, bred, dred, will, call, bles,
bles-ing, wil-ing. And b^caus stranger^ read Pe-o-ple, in 3 syllabls, I put
Peepl in which they cannot wel^er. And thus I could wish al other difficultys
myt in tym be removed, and their way mad as easy as it can, for I beleev the
desyr of many Nations and Peepls shall be unto the Peepl and languag' of England
For the understanding of the wondros things which the Lord has don, and is yet
doing in and for them, to the admirat on of all that shall bear thereof. Be not
offended at me for this (why should we not help them?) but bear with me etc
beleev me to be, Who ever thou art,

Thy true Friend, N. Y.

The Arrainment of Christendom, etc.
KNOW ye that the Lord God Omnipoten^, who is the God of the Spirits of al
flesh, even the Former of al things, has manifested himself in all Ages, not
only to be a God mercyful, patient, long suffering, and of long forbearans
toward provoking and Rebellios Mankind, but has also appeared to be a God, of
most Ryteos, dredful, and impartial wrath and vengeans, pouring forth his
justly deserved Judgments, upon alsorts, and generations of Peepl, Hy and Low,
Rich and Poor, Mal and Femal, of what degree, rank or quality soever from the
Prins on the Thron, to the Beggar on the Dunghill.

And the Iniquitys which have preceeded, Gods general Judgments in the ages
past, were generally these, to wit, Covetosnes, Pride, Oppression, Cruelty,
Idolatry, Persecution, and shedding of Innocent Blood, the Scripturs of truth,
as well as other records do abundantly giv testimony to the trurh thereof, and
dyvers Instanses I myt produs to evidens the sam but I shall only mention
something briefly concerning two.

And first concerning Israel of old, who were Gods chosen Peepl abov all the
familys of the earth in their tym, and age, for whose sak the Lord did terribl
and wonderful things in ryteosnes upon Pharo and Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and
in the Wilderness, and in the Land of Canaan, and notwithstanding, their
Rebellions, provocations, and backslydings were many, and great, yet great was
his patiens, long suffering and forbearans extended toward them very long,
before wrath to the uttermost seized on them, he carried them as on Eagls wings
and led them safly as a tender Father by the hand of Moses and Aron, corrected
them in lov, and mercy, giving them many gentel warnings, and wholesome Counsels
and Advys, by his Servants the Profets, whom he raised up, and sent amongst
them, and fulfil-ed his promis to the uttermost to them which he mad to
faithful Abraham, there failed nothing on his part, as their own records testify.

But as it is written, they for a lit-el tym believed his word and sang his
prays but soon forgot what God, the rok of their salvation had don for them,
Jesurun waxed fat and kik-ed against the God of their mercys, and
notwithstanding the many and great provocations of him to cut them of, he yet
wrouht and strov with them for his own great Nam sak, that it myt not be
blasfemed among the Heathen, laying his correcting hand in mesur on them, if
possibl to turn them to himself from the evil of their doings, sending
Blasting, Mildews, Locusts and Caterpil-ers, which devoured the fruits of the
earth, but yet they returned not to him, he sent also many of his Servants the
Profets, on after another to reprov, and warn them, denouncing the most dredful
Judgments of God against them, yet they still persisted in their wickedness, and
as it is written, they evilly, entreated his messengers, stoned and murdered his
Profets, which he in lov, and pity sent amongst them, which caused the Lord to
lay his hand mor and mor heavy on them, and suffered the heathen dyvers tyms to
com, and exercys Cruelty and Dominion over them even in their own land and
several tyms to lead them captyv into other cuntrys. But yet still such was his
lov, pity and faithfulness toward them, that when any mesur of true repentans
appeared in them, and that they cried unto him in their distres, he heard, and
delivered them, raising up dyvers Saviors, and deliverers for them, returning
their captivity dyvers tyms, but no sooner were they restored and settled but a
whyl in the enjoyment of the blessing and goodness of God, but they corrupted
themselves still, mor and mor backslyding revolting and rebeling against the
Lord, so that he said unto them by the Profet, wherefore should ye be smiten any
mor, from the greatest to the least they were become unsound, and corrupt in
their doings, their pride testified against them, even to their faces, in their
vain and lyt attyr adorned with costly and needles ornaments, their hauhty
looks and carriages.

Vyolens, Oppression.
Spoil and Oppression was found in a hy degree among their Governors, and
Rulers, they judged not the cause of the fatherles, nether would suffer the cause
of the widow, and oppressed to com before them, or have Justice from them,
Injustis.
they oppressed the poor and crushed the needy, so that the Lord told them by
the Profet, that the Lord God had sworn by his holiness that he would tak them
away as with hooks, and their posterity as with fish hooks.

And they were no les abominabl in their Idolatry and falls ways of worship,
Idolatry.
filing the land with Ydols, erecting Ydol Templs, wherein they exercysed most
abominabl Idolatry to their Ydol Gods, after the manner of the heathen round
about them, so that the Lord complaind of them by the Profet, that they were
become mor sottish, and Brutish then the very Beast, saying the Ox knows his
owner, and the Ass his Masters Crib, but Israel does not know, my Peepl do not
consider, The Land was full of Ydols, they worshipped the works of their own
hands, the mean man bowed down, and the great men debased themselves, therefore
spar them not, said the Lord God, yea so brutish, sotish, and mad were they upon
their Ydols, that notwithstanding they roasted, and boiled their food with the
sam kind of wood of which they mad their Ydols, yet had they not so much
understanding as to see that it was so.

Blood guiltynes
And as for Blood guiltynes, the Lord complained of them by the Profet, that
their hands were full of blood, so that they were become abominabl, even a stink in
the nostrils of God, even in their worship, and prayers to him, so that he said
to them by the Profet thus; To what purpos is the multitud of your sacrifyses,
and that their New Mons, Sabbaths, calling of assemblys and offering Incens,
was as if they blessed an Ydol, and murdered a Man, and that he was weary to bear
them, and could not away with their worship, and prayers, saying tho ye make
many prayers, yet will I not hear you, for your hands ar full of blood, and yet,
notwithstanding all this, did not the Lord ceas stryving with them, saying by
the Profet, whywil ye die o house of Israel? wash you, make you clean, ceas to
do evil learn to do well; tho your sins be as crimson I will make them as wool,
red as skarlet, yet will I make them, become whyr as snow, if ye yet be wil-ing
and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land. But notwitstandig all the
Patiens, kyndnes, and long suffering of the Lord, they persisted still in their
pride, oppression, cruelty, Idolatry and murdering the Innocent, til the wrath
of the Lord brak forth upon them so that there was no remedy, Their mesur filled
up.
proceeding on in their wickedness til they had fil-ed up their mesur to the
full, in denying, betraying, crucifying, and murdering, even the Son of God
himself, the Lord of life, and glory, who himself wept over Jerusalem, bewailing
them, because of the dredful wrath of God, which he saw near at hand to com upon
them, saying O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that kilest the Profets, and stonest
them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thee, as a hen
gathers her chik-ens under her wings, but thou would not, o that thou
had known, at least in this thy day, the things which belong to thy Peace, but
now they are hid from thy eyes, Dauhters of Jerusalem weep not for me but for
your selves, and sor your children, for behold the day comes, that thy enemies
shall cast a trench about thee, and keep thee in on every syd, and lay thee even
with the ground, because thou knew not the tym of thy visitation.

At the tym of whose suffering, and soon after, as also by the Entrans and
prevailing of the Apostasy in the Gentiles or Romans, the Word of the Lord by
the Profet Joel was fulfil-ed, to wit that the Sun should be turned into
darkness and the Moon into blood, before the great and not abl day of the Lord
should com, which was fulfil-ed on the Sun Both of the visibl, and invisibl
heven, a vail of darkness being drawn over the Lyt, Life, and Glory of God in
them both, which began to com over him in the garden, causing that great agony,
and bloody sweat, desyring the Father, that if it were possibl that cup myt
pas, which vail of darkness over him was then at the height, when on the cross
he cried, my God, my God why have thou forsaken me? And the Moon in him also,
was turned into blood by their Piercing his Innocent hands, feet and syd, out
of which came forth both Blood and Water, which he that savv bar record of,
and his record is true, vvherby (as in a figur) was signified, that
notvvithstanding, according to their own saying, the guilt of his dear, and
pretios life, and blood myt have stood unremovably charged on them and their
children, yet in and throuh him, should that pur clensing fountain of living
water, the virtue whereof should wash and clens them, and their posterity, coming
into it, from the guilt, and filth of al their abominations, and reconcyl them
to God and to on another: which Bowels of the lov, pity, and mercy of God in
him toward them, was mad manifest throuh him on the cross, Christ's
sufferings, and desertion not for his but others sins the just for the unjust.
in the height and extremity of his sufferings saying, Father forgiv them they
know not what they do. Whose sufferings, with that great vail of darkness
drawn over the Lyt, Life and Glory of God. in him, was not throuh or because of
any sin transgression, or disobediens found in him against his God and Father,
but it was by, thro^uh, and because of the sins, transgressions, disobediens,
cruelty and unryteosnes of the Poepl, it being then the hour, and power of the
Kingdom of darkness, in which the transgres-ing power, (from its first entrans
into the World) was com to its highest pitch as to the whole body, the power
and strength of the seed of the old Serpent being unyted and combyned in both
Jew and Gentil, against that Innocent pur, Life, Seed, Wisdom, Power, Lyt, and
Glory of God, which in, and throuh him appeared and was manifest, vvherby the
shepherdvvas smit-en, even the man which was his fellow, and the sheep
scattered, and he bearing the sins and transgressions of many in his body on
the tree, was numbered with transgressors, mad and reputed as accursed, the
end of Christ's sufferings.
suffering under their unjust, and cruel wills, and laws, the Just, for the
unjust. That so those who by their disobediens, and transgressions, were justly
lyabl to the Cross, and condemnation of the most just, and ryteos Law of God,
aliens, and enemies in their mynds against God, and him, by vvik-ed works, myt
receiv forgivnes of sin, and an inheritans with them who are sanctified, and
be reconcyled to him and on to another, and mad partakers of the Ryteosnes of
God in him.

And soon after his death, was the Moon (to wit the whole body of the Jews)
turned into blood also, The Judgment exalted.
which appeared in tho^ great destroying wars, enmitys, destructions and
desolations, which were amongst them on against another, which just, and
ryteos wrath and vengeans of God on them, declared against them throuh Christ,
and the Profets, was fulfil-ed by the Romans, whom God suffered to com on
them, and utterly to destroy and overturn their glorios City, Templ,
Priesthood and Government, and disposses them of the good land, leading them
captyvs into dyvers other Cuntrys, in which they still remain scattered up and
down and ar mad a scorn, a derision, and a byword among the nations, under
the ours unto this day, and as for any outvvard visibl or Erthly power, and
dominion, they shall never mor be restored to the exercys of it, but according
to the prayer of Christ and the promis of God, throuh the holy Profets,
recorded in the Scripturs of truth, if they abyd not still in unbeleef, they
shall be re-in-grafted into the good oliv tree, and mad again partakers of the
bles-ed Root, and Fatnes thereof, and God vvil povvr on them the Spirit of gras,
and supplication, and they shall see him, in them, whom they have pierced, not
only in, that Innocent on, whom they with cruel hands murdered and crucified
on a cross without the Gats of Jerusalem, but also in themselves, by their
Rebellions, and disobediens against the motions, and dictats of the sam living
word of Faith, Lyt, life and power of God in themselves and shall mourn for him,
as on mourns for the los of his first born Son and God vvil vvryt his pur law
of Spirit and life in their hearts, and inward parts, and be their God, and
they shall be his Peepl and become Citizens of the new Jerusalem, with the
chosen generation, the Royal and everlasting Priesthood, fellow theyrs with
the truly nobl seed in that. Kingdom, Glory and Dominion which is pur and
Eternal, and be redeemed from that Scorn Reproach, Contemt, Captivity, and curs
under which they now ar.

At the sam tym also was a vail of Darkness drawn over, the sam lyt, life and
glory of God, which is in the Son of the visibl heven, so that Darkness was over
all the Land from the sixth to the nynth hour, whereby as in a figur was
sorshewn, the fa^ing away, and Apostasy of the Gentiles or the Romans, which
Apostasy had its Entrans, Growth and Fulness in the Opening Sounding, and
Pouring forth of the second, third, and fourth Seals, Trumpets, and Vyals,
whereby a vayl of gros Darkness came over that Pur lyt, Life and Glory of Christ,
which was in mesur manifested, and shyning forth in and throuh them, thereby
crucifying, to and in themselves the Son of God afresh put-ing him to pen sham,
and having murdered, and slain the Life of Christ, that just on in themselves,
they stretched forth their hands in ways of Persecution, Cruelty, and Murder,
against the appearans of the sam Pur Lyt, Innocent Life, and Glory of God in
others, til they becam Drunk with the Blood of the dear Innocent Saints,
Martyrs, and faithful VVitnes-es of JESUS, so that the Sun (in them) becam
black as Sackloth of hair, and their Moon has bin turned into Blood, which
has manifestly appeared in those great Confusions, Bloody wars, Destructions,
and Desolations which have been amongst themselves in every Kingdom, and Dominion
throuhout Christendom, and now they having filled up the Mesur of their
Abominations, the great and notabl Day of the Lord is com, in which the Lord
will, throuh, and by the Turkish power, carry on the finishing his Just and
Ryteos decree of Wrath and Vengeans, on them (to wit Christendom) and they
also shall become not a peepl of any visibl, or outward, earthly Power or
Government upon the fas of the earth, as of themselves, any mor for ever.

But according to the Word of the Lord throuh his Servants the Profets, he will
Rays up in them, a pur seed which shall ferv him, even a numberles number, which
shall with all the Ransomed ons, stand before the Thron clothed in whyt Robs,
ascrybing salvation unto God which fireth on the Thron, and unto the Lamb,
saying, Bles-ing Glory, Wisdom, Thanksgiving, Honor, Power, and Myt be unto
our God for ever and ever Amen. The slain of the Word, by the Lord of the Mouth
(amongst them) shall be many. And so both Jew, and Gentil shall be unyted, and
become on stik in the hand of the Lord, on Holy Nation upon the Mountains of
Israel, and on King shall be King over them al, even David my Servant, says the
Lord God, they shall have on shepherd, and walk in the Judgments of the Lord, and
observe his Statuts to do them, and shall dwell in the Land, even they, and their
Children, and their Childrens Children for ever, in the partipation of the new
and Everlasting Covenant of God, and his Sanctuary, and Tabernacl shall be in
the midst of them, and he be their God, and they his Peepl for ever mor.

And when the Lord has don his work in Zyon he will also punish the stout
heartednes of the King of Assyria, and bring down the Glory of his hy looks,
and the loftynes of man (in them also) shall be a based, and brouht down, and
that hautynes laid low, even with the ground, and the Lord will aveng the Blood
of the house of Ahab upon the house of Jehu, and cause that Kingdom to ceas for
ever, even all that Rul Authority, and Power, risen and standing in the Spirit,
and Power of the Dragon that old Serpent) shall be thrust down under the feet of
the pur seed, Christ, the wisdom and power of God in his Peepl, even throuhout
all the habitabel parts of his Earth, so that Nation shall not lift up sword
against Nation, nor learn war any mor, but the Kingdoms of this World shall
become the Lords, and the Lord God Omnipotent shall rein, in, throuh, and over al
for ever mor.

The other exampl which I shall mention is Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar his
Son, who, together in their power, were the Golden head of that Imag, which
Nebuchadnezzar saw, of which your predecessors, together with you, even you,
the present Roman Empyr, with all other the Kings, Prinses, Heds, and Rulers
throuhout Christendom, and the Dominions, and Territorys, thereunto belonging in
your and their Power, Military, Civil, and Ecclesiastical (so caled) ar the
feet, and Toes, which the Ston cutout of the mountain without hands, is now
smyting.

Nebuchadnezzar's arrogans.
Now it is written concerning this Nebuchadnezzar, that he was a King of Kings,
and that the God of heven had given him a Kingdom, Power, Strength, and Glory,
but he being ignorant of that God that mad him, and gav him that great
strength, and larg Dominion, did in the Pride of his heart attribut that Glory,
myt, Majesty, Strength, Dominion and honor unto himself, which was du to the
Lord God of heven alon, and at his Dispos; exercysing cruelty, and oppression
on whom he pleased, making a law in his own vviked will, to cause al to bovv to
that Imag, His work.
which he in his own Idolatros heart, had invented, and sit up, or else to
Murder, and Destroy the Refusers by fyr, tho Othervvys Innocent, and guiltles
of any evil don against him, His visitation and reward, tho a King
but even vvhylst he was (in the pride and arrogance of his heart) assuming
that Glory, and Honor to himself which was du only to the God of heven, there
fell a voys from heven, saying. O King Nebuchadnezzar to thee be it spoken, thy
Kingdom is departed from thee, they shall dryv thee from Men, thy dweling shall
be with ye Beasts of the field, they shall make thee to eat gras as oxen, and
seven tyms shall pas over thee until thou know that the most hy rules in the
Kingdom of Men, and gives them to whom soever the will. His restoration when he
giv God his glory again.
Which the sam hour was fulfiled upon him, which was a just Judgment, and
yet a gentel warning from the the God of heven, who after wards restored him
to his Kingdom, and caused him there by to acknowledge the God of heven, and that
he rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and siteth up, and Puteth down whom, and when
he pleases.

But Belshazzar his Son, not taking warning, and being found guilty of his
Fathers Iniquitys, the God of heven did Justly visit the iniquitys of the
Father upon the Son, sending a hand writing upon the wall (even whylst he was
(in the Pride of his heart) drinking Wyn in the vessels of the Tempel of God,
That Son which succeeds in his fathers Vys shall inherit his fathers reward as
well as Crown.
praising the Gods of Gold, silver, bras, Iron VVood, and ston. But the God in
whose hands his Breath was, he glorified not) at the sit whereof his Countenans
changed, his Thouhts troubled him, the Joints of his loins loosed, and his
knees smot on against another; Which hand writing was quickly fulfiled upon
him, by the most just, and impartial hand of God; Himself being slain, his
Kingdom finished and given to Darius the Median, by all which it Evidently
appears, that the Lord God of heven, is a God of most Ryteos, and Impartial
justis on whomsoever they be that are found persisting in ways of wikednes and
Rebellion against him, and non are abel to deliver, either themselves, or others
out of his hand.

Now that which I have Further to say, is concerning your selves, and your
predecessors but most Nearly it concerns your selves of this present ag, and
Generation, according as it was for seen and for told by the Spirit of
Prophesy, and recorded in the scripturs of truth as well as other Records, so it
is true, that they (to wit your predecessors) together with you, were, and ar
that fourth Beast or Kingdom, which was to arys out of the Earth, dyvers from al
Kingdoms, which devoured the whole Earth, (or powers of the Earth) treading them
down, and breaking them to Pieces, being dredful, and terribel, and strong
execedingly, as Iron, baving great Iron Teeth, devouring breaking to Pieces,
and stamping the Residu under his feet, dyvers from all the beasts that were
before him, having ten horns, even ye ar the feet and Toes of that Imag, seen
by Nebucadnezzar in his dream, spoken of in the Book of Daniel the servant of
the most Hy God, in a mesur of whose spirit and Power, I am now standing up, in
my Lot, in the ending of the days.

Even ye with your predecessors ar that Beast which John (the faithful
witness and servant of Jesus) savv to arys out of the sea, having seven Heds and
ten Horns, lijk unto A leopard, vvhos feet were as the feet of a Bear, The
dragon without what.
and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion, vvhos Power, seat, and great Authority,
was given to him by the Dragon, or Military Power, which Beast the world
wondered after, spoken of in the Book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which
God gav unto him, to show unto his servant things that must shortly com to Pas
which he sent, and signified by his Angel, in his servant John (in Amesur of
whose spirit and Power, I am Now brouht forth to declar and Prophesy of these
things unto many Peepl, Nations, Tongu's, and Kings,) And as I have already said
God mad us, of your predecessors (towit) the Roman Power, to Execut his most
just, and Ryteos Decree upon the Jews, which Power in their Rys, Growth and
Continans in you their Succescors to this present day, has ansvvered what
was forseen, Declared, and written by the spirit of Prophesy, in, and by the
Mouth of his servants concerning them, and you, so that it was of the Lords
Permsssion that Power Brak forth in your predecessors in A military from which
in its first Appearans, VVorking, Growth, and Counsels, Becam, Strong, Dredful,
Valiant, VVys, Vnanimos and succesful, Among the Romans both before and after
they professed Christ, were many wys and good men and laws.
which way soever they turned spreding the wings of their power far, and vvyd,
Comprehending in it many contrys, and Nations of Dyvers Tongu's, and languages,
In vvhos counsels, and Senats were found many Grav, VVys prudent, truly vertuos,
and holy Men, amongst whom Dyvers Good, and wholesome Laws, and Decrees for the
preservation, and good Government of the Peepl were mad, and against Images as
being contrary to the scripturs; And freedom, and liberty of Conscience in
Matters of Religion, and Worship, to such as lived peasably under their
government, there being Atym when the churches had Rest, throuhout al Judea,
Galilca, and Samaria, and were Edifyed, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in
the comforts of the Holy Ghost, so that (in Mesur) they Becam Agoverment
answering its proper ends, under whom such as feared the Lord lived A peasabel
life in Godlynes, and honesty, which Rendered them Nobl, and honorabl at hom, and
famos, Renowned, and Dredful broad, so that it was counted no small privilege
to be Afree Born Roman, Aliens Judging It vvorth their whyl to Part with great
sums of money to be naturalyzed under the ROMAN Government.

And as in their Military, and Civil Power, and Government (so caled) they
becam thus Dredful, Valjant, VVys, Nobl, Succefful, and spreding, so also in
their Religion, and faith, they were truly famos, The Leed us d some of the
Romans as his Ax, Others he brouht in to nearer communion with himself.
Renowned, and glorios, so that as God had mad us' of them as An Ax in his hand
to cut of the Jews, who were the Natural Branches, Because of their vvikednes,
and unbeleef, in Denying, Betraying and Crucifying that Just on; The Lord
Extended his Kyndnes, Mercy, and Goodness to them (to wit your predecessors)
being Gentiles, Or heathens, and Aliens from the Commonwelth of Israel, making
way throuh their fall, to Ingraft your predecessors, into the good Oliv Tree,
causing them to Partak of the Root, and fatnes thereof, and the Blesed, and
glorios fruits of the good Olyv tree, was in mesur brouht forth in, and throuh
them, so that the glorios, holy workings, and operations of their faith was
spoken of throuhout the World, as holy Paul in his Epistel to them declared.

So that notwithstanding they were Gentiles by Nature, and had not the outward law
of God, which was written on tabels of ston, nor the us' of the outward Templ
nor circumcision, nor the exercys of any outward Worship, Ordinanses,
Cerimonys, and Observations, contained in the Levitical Priesthood which was
amongst the Jews; Yet they turning the ey of their mynds inward, to the lyt of
Christ in them, and walkiug answerabel to that perfect Law of liberty, and life,
which God had engraven by his Holy Spirit, in their hearts, and inwards parts,
the Apostel declared them to be the true seed of Abraham, The true Circum^ision
and ^ew.
and Children of the promis, and of the true circumcision, for non else ar
counted by God for the true seed, but the Children of the lyt, for
notwithstanding they were un circumcysed in the flesh, yet keeping the Ryteosnes
of the Law of God written in their hearts, they were counted of the true
circumcision, the true Jews, and seed of Abraham, For (said he) he is not a Jew
who is on outwardly, nether is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,
but he is a Jew, that is on inwardly, and the true circumcision is that of the
heart in the Spirit, not in the flesh or letter, whose prays is not of men but
of God.

For all who truly turn their mynds to the lyt of Jesus, the Mesur of the Spirit
of the Gras of God placed in them, and com truly to know, and answer the
leading, The law not for the Ryteos, but for the unryteos.
and dictats of the Law of the spirit of life, written in their hearts by God,
such com truly to know Redemtion and Salvation by Christ Jesus the trulyt, and
life of God in them, seting them free from the Law of sin and death, and against
such the out ward law of God was not given forth, nether ouht any outward Law
to be mad by Man against such, for they com to inherit the true substans, even

abyds near at hand, even in the heart and in the mouth, whom truly, to know,
obey, and constantly to follow, is eternal life, pur lov, rest, and peace for
ever mor, The manifestation of Christ in his Peepl the end of al outward
institutions
in whom al Carnal, and outward Typs, Figurs, Shadows, Ordinanses, Wars,
Kingdoms, Citys, Tempels, Priesthoods, al Divisions of the Earth, Erthly
Enjoyments, and Possessions, Gatherings, Fellowships, Intercessions, Teachings,
Declarations, Dispensations and Baptisms, both of the Profets and John. With
Christ his Mirakels, Preaching, Parabels and last supper ar fulfiled, and ended
(of which the brith life, appearans, and sufferings of Jesus Christ that Lamb
of God, who vvitnesed a good confession before Pontius Pylat, and was betrayed
denied, and rejected by the Jews, whom they with cruel hands murdered and
slew on a cross without the gats of Jerusalem, with his Resurrection, and
Ascension, and Appearans, on and in the Apostels waiting at Jerusalem, was a
Syn,) In whom I say, al things have their end; Even all that which was not in
the beginning with God, which has risen in, and throuh man, in the fallen
Spirit, power, and wisdom, even with the ordinanses and appointments of God
ad ed because of sin and transgression, until the appearans, and coming of the
true pur seed, Christ, the Lord that Spirit, the true heyr of al, who is God
over al blesed for ever, must now Depart, Vanish, and flee away, and end for
ever mor, as into the everlasting Covenant Man Kind is brought.

But some may say he speaks against Government, and the Ordinanses and
appointments of God in the Church.

I answer Nay. That all the Powers, and Dominions, that are, or have been sins
the entrans of transgression to this day, have been raised and suffered to arys
by God, either in mercy or judgment to them over whom it has bin exercysed, and
that every soul ouht to be subject to the hyer power, The power to be obeyed
what ever the instruments (...) but let such tak heed how they abus the Power.
which al who resist, resist the ordinans of God, what ever the Instruments or
Persons be, throuh whom the power is administered, be they Gentel or froward,
wiked or godly, and in cas they do abus the power committed unto them, turning
the sword bakward, siting up such as work wikednes, making a prey of such as
depart from Iniquity, yet ouht non to seek by outward fors in rebellions, and
insurrections to oppos or resist them, but wherein for conscience sak toward God
any cannot obey their unjust, and unryteos laws and commands they ouht to be
subject by Patient suffering, in the fear, and wisdom of God, bearing their
Testimony against the evil, so commiting their souls into the hand of God, as
unto A faithful Creator, Thus the true Christians did and still do.
and in so doing the spirit of glory rests On such, and in du tym the Lord
God of faithfulness will clear their Innocence and cause it to shyn forth as the
lyt, and his Just wrath, and vengeans to tak hold on that spirit, and Power, by
which they have bin mad unjustly to suffer.

It is the sam spirit and not the sam Nam, maks the sam Minister or ordinans of
Christ.
And as concerning the ordinanses and Appoyntments of God in the church, this I
say, that as God has, so he still does sit and appoint in the church, Profets,
Apostels, Evangelists, Pastors, and teachers, with other helps in Government,
and although they have not now the sam Nams, yet appearing in the sam spirit, and
Power, ar in truth and substans the sam, which shall continu in the church until
that end be accomplished in Mankind for which they are Appointed by God, to wit
for the work of the Ministry, in gathering and Perfecting the saints, the
Edification of the Body of Christ, until al com into the unity of the faith,
and Knowledge of the Son of God, unto A perfect man, unto the mesur of the
statur of the fulness of Christ.

But some may say shall man Kind be brouht Or Redeemed into such A stat?

I answer Yea; And the ground or reason of my faith, The promis and Covenant of
God in man kind the ground of al tr^ faith and hop to which the scripturav a
witness.
That the seed of the woman shall bruis the head of the Serpent, and that all the
familys of the Earth shall be blesed in, and throuh it, and that into it, the
gathering of the Peepl shall be, and that it shall have the heathen for its
inheritans and the utmost parts of the Earth for its possession, and rul them
with a rod of iron, and al its enemies become its footstool. and that as a ston
cut out of the mountain without hands, it should smyt the Imag' (to wit the
Powers of sin and darkness) in the feet thereof, so that the Iron, Clay, Silver
and Gold thereof (to wit all the strength and Glory of the Power and Kingdom of
Darkness from the foundation to the Top ston in that cursed building) shall be
broken to pieces together, and become as chaf, which the wynd carries away, and
that the ston should become a great mountain, and fill the whole Earth; And the
Dominion of sin and transgression shall be finished and an end put thereunto, and
everlasting Ryteosnes be raised up and established in Man Kind, and they in it,
and that as in Adam al dyed so in Christ (the seed) al shall be mad alyv, and as
sin has reined unto Death so Gras shall Rein throuh Ryteosnes, (the seed) unto
everlasting life, and John in the Spirit of Profesy heard him that sat on the
Thron say, Behold I make al things new. and saw the new Hevens, and the new
Earth, wherein ryteosnes dweleth, and the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, into
which nothing that defyleth or works abomination can enter, or that makes a
ly, but they who ar written in the Lambs Book of Life, whereby was for shown. The
restoration of the seed, Christ in mal, and femal, and of them in it, to that
pur Dominion, and Glory which he had with the Father, in Man-kynd, and Man-kynd
in him, before the foundation of the World, (which lies in wikednes) began.

The promis fulfild in the head and many members, a strong ground of Hop.
II. Secondly he has already in mesur mad those promises, and Covenant good, and
performed it, to, and in some, to wit in Christ Jesus that Lamb of God, who was
the first begoten from the Ded, the Head of the Body the Church, in whom the
Eternal Word of Life, the Seed of God (slain from the foandation of the World
(which lies in wikednes) was brouht forth in its Holy, Pur, and perfect Estat
of innocence, in whom the old Serpent, the Devil, the Tempter found no Plas,
who pased the tym of his sojourning here on Earth in that mortal body, in the
pur fear, lyt, life, Wisdom, and Power of God his Father, faithfully finishing
the work, given him by the Father to do, and in the sam Eternal pur Spirit
offered up himself again unto God, and without spot returned into the Bosom of
the Eternal Father and fountain of life from whens he came, and proceeded; As
also dyvers of the Saints, and Holy Men of God, by and throuh a participation
of the Sam Eternal, pur fulness of God, which dwelt in him, were turned from the
darkness to the lyt, from the Power of Satan to the Power of God, and witnesed
Salvation from sin, and had learned to deny al ungodlynes, and worldly lusts,
and to live soberly, Ryteosly and holyly in this present World, and were cleansed
from al filthiness of flesh, and Spirit, and had overcom the wiked on, and were
mad free from sin, and become the Servants of Ryteosnes risen with Christ siting
together in hevenly plases in Christ Jesus, and were com to the new Jerusalem,
to Mount Syon, the city of the living God, to the innumerabel Company of
Angels, the general Assembly, and Church of the first born, to God the Judge of
al, and to the Spirits of just men mad perfect (in them)

III. Thirdly, Because the sam Eternal Power which has acomplished it in the
head and Some of the members, The Power of God sufficient to perfect the rest.
is abel to acomplish the sam in every member, according to it is plas,
throuhout the whole body being abel to sav to the uttermost all that com to God
in him, who is abel to work, so as non shall hinder, for Heven, and Earth shall
pas, and now is pasing away, but not on Jot or tittel of all that he has spoken
or promised, shall fall to the ground unfulfiled.

IIII. Fourthly, The Day is now com, in which an end to the World which lies
in wikednes shall be put, and the Kingdom of darkness, sin, and transgression
finished, and the pur, and everlasting Ryteosnes of God (to wit Christ in mal,
and femal, be mad manifest in and throuh mankind, and mankind in it, reconcyled
to God and to on another, in the ever lasting Covenant of life, never mor to be
forgoten, in which the whole creation shall have deliverans from the bondag of
corruption in to the glorios liberty of the Sons of God.

The ground of al outward Rul and ordinanses in Church and stat, declared.
And as concerning al Rul, Dominion, Authority and Power whatsoever that has
bin, or shall be exercysed in, and throuh man, over others, wirh all the
Ordinanses, Appointments of God in the Church, The ground of the Rys,
Manifestation, Administration, and Continuans of them al, was, and is man's
transgression in sining and departing from the Lord, the lyt, Spirit, and power
of God in the inward parts.

And man's Restoration, and redemtion from sin, and transgression and returning
again unto the Lord, in obediens to the lyt, Spirit, The most universal
gathering, and greatest glory to be after the Apostasy.
and power of God in the inward parts, puteth an end unto them al.

But according as it was forseen, and fortold by the Spirit of Christ in the
Holy Apostels a faling away, and Apostasy from the true Christian faith and life
should com, and that the most spreding manifestation of the most Excelent
glory, and day of the Lord, and the most universal gathering into him was not
to com except there cam' first a faling away and the Man of sin revealed, and
Holy Paul in his Advys to the over seers of the flok told them, that after his
departur greevos wolvs would enter in amongst them, not sparing the flok, and
that from among themselves should men arys speaking pervers things to draw
Discypels after them, and further said that the Mystery of Iniquity did then
already begin to work, and John in his Epistel advyseth them to whom he wrote,
to try the Spirits, and not to beleev every Spirit, because many falls Profets
were then gone out into the World, The ^op confesses that the Christ came in that
on body of flesh.
saying that every Spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is com into the
flesh is not of God, and that was the Spirit of Antichrist of which they had
heard that it should com, and said then, that it was already com into the
World, and that they went out from Among themselves.

And so it was, that the seed of the Serpent having found Plas in some,
beguyling them, as of old he did Eva, drawing their mynds from the simplicity
of the Spirit of Christ in them, leading them out into the World, Inclyning
their hearts after outward and visibel things, it ceased not working even in a
mystery of iniquity, covered over with outward shows, and pretenses of
Christianity, and Holiness, even in the Elders teachers and leaders of the flok,
til at length, from, and throuh them, that cursed seed spread it self, as evil
leven throuhout the whole lump, and becam a Man of sin opposing, and exalting
himself abov the pur seed of God in Man-kynd siting there as God in the Tempel
of God. And from this cursed root of biternes has sprang an evil tree, whose
Branches have over spread al Christendom bringing forth the evil fruits of
Covetosnes, Pride, Oppression, Cruelty, Idolatry, Wars, Divisions, Persecution,
and sheding the Blood of the Innocent, Murdering the harmles Saints of Jesus,
by many, Cruel, Antichristian, Vnmercyful, and Inhuman, Torturings, Rackings,
and D^ths by Hanging and Burning, with dyvers other, open, and secret ways of
Cruelty and Murder, under a cursed, and falls pretens of their being Heritics,
and lykwys the Apostel Peter (whose Successor the Pop of Rom falsely pretends to
be) saw this also taking root in the Elders, Lording and preaching for filthy
Luker of as great antiquity as any other part of Popish faith, or a practis.
and teachers, that even a Spirit of Covetosnes, Pride, and Lordlynes was taking
root in them, and therefore exhorted and warned them in his Epistel, saying thus,
the Elders which are amongst you I exhort, who am also an Elder, and a witness
of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the Glory that shall be revealed,
feed the flok of God which is amongst you taking the oversyt thereof, not by
constraint but wilingly, not for filthy Luker but of a ready mind, not as Lords
over Gods heritag' but as good exampels to the flok.

In this Spirit sprang up al those invented Nams, Orders, Garbs and Manners of
habits of the Pops, Cardinals, Friars, Monks, Capuchins, Nuns etc. And the
voluntary humility, and pretended vows of poverty, and chastity, and separation
from the World and imitated devotion, Worshipping of Angels, intruding into
things which they have not seen, and the Doctrine of Devils, spekinglys in
H^pocrisy of a Purgatory to purg' Peepl from sin after they are Ded, forbiding
Meats and Marriages, which God had ordained in his own fear, and Wisdom to be
enjoyed without respect either to Tym or Persons, injoyning the Observation of
Days, Tyms, Months, and Years, imposing their own corrupt Inventions and
Traditions upon the Peepl for Doctrine, The faith of Devils,
and from this Root sprang the faith of Devils, in an Imaginary God without
them, and at a distans from them, abov the skys, comprehended in three Persons,
and of a Resurrection of their Carkases with the Carkases of al others that have
bin sins man was created, and an Imaginary expectation of Christ to com in the
sam body os flesh in which he suffered Death without the gats of Jerusalem, out
of the visibel hevens, upon the material Clouds to Judgments, and of a heven to
the enjoyed after they are Ded above the skys, and an Imaginary hell or plas of
torment for the wiked after they are Ded, with material fyr and brimston, of al
which they cannot giv either themselves or others a Rational Account, and from
this Root sprang the tabel of Devils, (to wit) eating, the tabe^ of Divls.
and drinking to exces and Riot, to the raising, and norishing of that Spirit
in man which is enmity against God, and leads in to all the ways of Deceit,
Covetosnes, Pride, lust, Cruelty, and unryteosnes, which are the Spirits of
Devils in all manner of the cursed fruits of the works of sin, and darkness
throuhout Christendom, among al sorts Hy and Low, Rich and Poor, Rulers, the
Fellowship of Devils what.
VVariors, Teachers, and Peepl, which cursed seed, and evil leven took plas,
and Rooting in many in the Apostels days, and they seeing, and feeling the
working thereof, did according to the wisdom of the Spirit of Christ in them
wryt concerning the sam, to the end that such as were wavering myt be
established in truth, that such as were gone astray myt be brouht bak, and that
such as did wilfuly persist in ways of Apostasy myt be left without excus; and
that a testimony myt be left upon record unto succeeding ages, to stay, and
comfort such as should suffer for truths sak at the hands of those that were
fallen under the Spirit of Apostasy, and that at the appearans of Christ in his
Peepl (now mad manifest) in the brytnes of his coming, to Reveal, Consum and
Destroy the Man of sin.

The recorded Testimony of the Profets, Christ, and the Apostels, migt be
prodused as A true Witness, or Testimony against the spirit of Apostasy, warning
those to whom they wrote, Not to be beguyled of their Reward, or Spoiled by vain
Philososij, voluntary, humility, Or worshipping of Angels; for all performanses
what soever which are don Only in the will of Man, or Imitation of others, ar
nether acceptabel to God, nor truly profitabel to man; The worsshiping of
Angels what.
Which worship of Angels, is, the Creaturs being exalted in its self, because of
the Operation of the Power Or gift of God in and throuh it, or to lift up, Or
exalt Others because of the Eminent operation of the Power, Or gift of God in,
and throuh them; The Operation of which Power, Or gift of God, is an Angel of
God in Mal, and femal; which things were taking Root Amongst them, the strong
despysing the weak, and the weak judging the strong, Others making partys,
lifting up of Instruments, on abov, and against another, some saying they were
for Paul, Others for Apollo, Others for Cephas, Others boasting in others lyns,
of things mad up to their hands, intruding into things which they had not seen,
where as the Apostels said. That which they declared was that which they had
seen, tasted, and handled of the word of life. And the gras' of God had tauht
them, (not in show, or desaitful, and hypocritical profession) but in truth of
Practis to deny al ungodlynes and vvorldly lusts and to live soberly, and
Ryteosly in this present world, which was and is the true Purgatory which
they held, The true Purgatory is the clensing virtue of the blood or life of
Christ.
even the Blood, the Pur spirit of Christ in them, which purged and cleansed
them from al filthynes of flesh, and spirit whyl they were living in the Body,
whereby they were presented in Body soul, and spirit blamles, and with out spot
before God, and before his thron: Affirming that there is nether work, Knowledge,
Or wisdom in the grav, and that as every tree falls so it lys, and as Death
leaves so Judgment fynds al, and as concerning meats, and drinks, observation of
Days, tyms and Marriages the Apostels advysed, not to Judge on-another in those
things, and that the strong should bear with the weak and not to pleas them
selves, but when he wrote to such as had seen beyond those things and were
Apostatysing and faling bak again into those begerly Rudiments, he reproved them
sharply, saying that the Kingdom of God was not meats, and drinks, and that
both the Belly, and meats, was for destruction; demanding of them, who had
bewitched them, and whether (having run well, and begun in the Spirit) they
thouht to be mad Perfet in the flesh, teling them that he was fraid of them,
least he had bestowed his labor in vain on them, because they observed days,
tyms, and sabbaths and there were such amongst them as were Eried from the faith,
and had mad ship wrak of a good conscience, deceived, and deceiving others in
doctrine, and practis, and for dishonest gain gone in the way of Balaam for
gifts, and rewards.

And they affirmed, that the Body, Spirit, Hop, Lord, Faith, Baptism, God, and
father of al, is but on, who is in, throuh and over al; Whose eternal pur
fulness dwelled bodyly in Christ, of vvhos fulness of pur lyt and life al who
receiv and walk in, become Children, and heyrs of God in, and with him which
is the faith of the son of God, by which the Just livs, in Mal, and femal, the
on Baptism which saves, which is not the washing away the out ward filth os
the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience, by the Resurrection of Christ,
the Lord that spirit from the ded in mal, and femal, which al who have the
Son; have the Father also, dvveling and Walking in them, as says the scripturs
of truth, and Christ said that he was the Resurrection and the life, and al
who did, do, or shall live and beleev in him, do, and shall live, tho they were
Ded: Such become Children of the resurrection, throuh the participation of the
sam Pur, Divyn Nature, Lyt, Life, and fulness of God, which dwelled in, and was
mad manifest throuh Christ Jesus, vvherby the Saints then, and now, vvitnesed
themselves to be, not only crucified and ded with Christ unto the World, with
the inordinat affections, and lusts thereof, but also to be quikened and risen
with him, siting together in hevenly plases in Christ.

The Resurrection, Redemtion and Salvation is of Christ the Seed of God in
Man-kynd, which in Man, as unto Man, becam as captivated, slain, and in bondag
throuh the entrans, and prevailing of sin, and transgression, vvherby the becam
the Lamb slain from the foundation of the World (which lies in vvikednes) in
Man-kynd. The laying down, the outward body no Curs.
The bar laying down of the body (which is called Death) is not the effect or
revvard of sin, the laying down of the body had bin, tho Man had never fallen in
to sin, and transgression, which would not have bin, nether shall be to such as
ar truly Redeemed, either cursed or any ground of fear or terror, but in the
vvil of the Lord Rather desyrabel, as a Bed of Rest in its plas, and season, is
as truly welcome, and desyrabel, as either food, or the morning, or any part of
the day; to him that is in the work of God. That Death which is the reward of
sin what.


That Death, and Curs which was, and is the Reward of sin and transgression,
entered into Mankind, in the sam day, and instant of tym, that sin entered,
acording to the Word of the Lord to, and in them, after which Adam lived
several hundreds of Years in the body, yet this I say; That the shortness, and
uncomfortabel being of the life in the Body is the Effect of Sin. Christ Said to
the father of all that thou have given me I have lost Non, and that it was the
will of the Father, that he should raiss it up again at the last day, he spak
not of Carkases Or Persons, But of the Pur glory, and Dominion of his own life,
which in man (as unto man) throuh the Entrans of trangression, becam as slain,
captivated, and in bondag; yet in it self lost nothing, but retaind, and still
retains its Purity, and Dominion in and over Mankind, throuh al Ages, and for
ever abyds the sam, for Christ, the sam Eternal lyt, The lyt always the sam in
its self, but as to man the dispensation changes as he changes.
life, wisdom, and Power of God, which in Mankind before transgression, rendered
him to be the Imag of God, and sat him in true Pur honor and Dominion over the
works of his hands, becam in Man-kynd after the Entrans of sin A Reprover, and
judge in them, so that the life, and Power of God in them, was the sam in its
Purity and undefyled, not consenting to the evil, only differing in the
working, and manifestation of its self in Man-kynd, and the last day is now
com in which Christ the Lyt, Life, Wisdom, Power, and seed of God, shall be
Raised up again in Man-kynd, and man-kynd in it, to the Sam Pur Dominion, and
glory, which he had with the Father, and Man-kynd in him, before the world
(which lies in wikednes) began, And as concerning Eternal Judgment, it is
committed by the father to the Son, to wit Christ, the Lyt, Wisdom, and Power
of God, the faithful and true witness of God, in Mal, and femal, which was
with the father before his works of Old, which Eternal judgment, has bin
faithfuly Executed, in, On, and throuh al ages, and generations, in, and on the
general, and in, and on every Particular soul of Man-kynd that has don evil,
which shall continu to be Executed by him, til al his Enemies become his
footstool; and that Sam Eternal Judgment, which is in Christ, the Lyt, the
faithful and true witness of God in Mal and Femal, shall stand for ever in Pur
Dominion over the head, and seed of the serpent, which is the transgresing
Power in Man-kynd.

And as concerning heven, it is that pur stat of eternal Life, Lov, Dominion,
and glory; which is the Imag of God in which Man-kynd was plased before trans
gresion, Heven what.
and into which Man kind, (by and throuh a participation of that pur Divyn
Nature, and fulness of God, which dwelt bodyly in Christ Jesus) coms to be again
Redeemed, and Restored, which al who truly enjoy, and partak of, do enter in by
Christ the lyt, life, way and eternal door, and ar saved, redeemed, risen and
standing up from the ded receiving Eternal life in him, siting in hevenly plases
in Christ.

And hell is no other but that Death, Curs, woe, Misery and Tribulation, which
enters, and taks hold on body, soul, and Spirit, throuh transgression, but
that Death, and hell which John in the Spirit of Prophesy wrote of, and saw as
cast in to the lak of fyr, is no other then that cursed Spirit, Power and
Dominion of the darkness of this World, which throuh the faling away and
Apostasy of the Gentiles or Romans aros, and has bin for ages, and generations
excercysed over the several Nations, Kindreds, Tongu's, and Languages throuhout
Christendom, in the Dragon's, Beast's, and falls Profets Spirit and Power, who
under falls pretenses of protecting, governing, and teaching the peepel, in
safty, Peace, Ryteosnes, and Holiness, have bin a Hell of cruelty, Oppression,
unryteosnes, and deceit unto, and over them, as so many sorts of incarnat
Devils in their Military, Civil, and Ecclesiastical Powers (so caled) ryding on
the Nations, Robing, Spoiling and plundering the peepel of their Estats,
tresurs, and fruits of their Labors, at their own cursed wills, and plesurs to
uphold, and maintain them in pride, deceit, eas, fulness, and oppression over the
peepel, causing also their Blood as a continued Issu to run sorth to fulfill
their cursed wills and plesurs, as also the Dear Innocent Saints. Martyrs, and
faithful witneses of Jesus, who throuh ages, and generations past unto this
day have born their Testimony against their vviked vvays and practices; Which
Spirit, and power must now be cast into the Lak of Eternal Perdition, and
Destruction, and suffer the vengeans of Eternal fyr, and be limited and chained
down in the Bottomless, Pit in every particular out of which it aros, and the
smok of the torments hereof to ascend up for ever mor, which is the second
Death, even the Hell of Hell.

Furthermar the Apostel told them to whom he wrote, that they could not be
partakers of the Tabel of the Lord, and the Tabel of Devils, reproving that
disorder and exces with was amongst them in eating and drinking, for which cause
many becam weak, and sik, The Tabel of the Lord what and how it bec^^^s a curs
and fala asleep, for the Tabel of the Lord (to wit the varios Kynds* and stors
of provisions which the Eternal Power, the Father of the household does daily
produs, and giv freely forth, to feed and sustain Man-kynd, and every Cretur)
becoms a trap, a snar a gin, and a Curs, even a Tabel of Devils unto, and in
such as eat, and drink thereof in exces, to the satisfaction of the carnal mind,
and the inordinat desyrs of the flesh. And as concerning the fellowship, and
conversation of Devils, it was springing up amongst them, and therefore the
Apostel exhorted them to whom he wrote to have no fellowship with the unfruitfal
works, and workers of darkness, saying that it was even a sham to speak of those
things which were don of them in secret, but al things reprovabel (said he) ar
mad manifest by the Lij^.

Which cursed Spirit of Apostasy having thus taken plas, and Rooting in, and
amongst them in the Apostels days, has grown, and spread it self in, and over
al Christendom, which has rendered Christendom (in their Military, Civil, and
Ecclesiastical Powers) to be the Thron, and Seat of Iniquity, of Beelzebub, the
Man of sin, a habitation of Devils, the hold of every Foul and No^ ysom Spirit,
a Cag of every unclean and hatful Bird, which must now Receiv the Reward of
Devils, even Destruction, and perdition from the presens of the Lord and from
the glory of h s pur power who is now risen in his holy Tempel to shak terribly
the Hevens and the Earth, not only in Christendom, but in all nations, that so
what is shaken may be removed, and that which cannot be shaken may remain, and
shyn forth in its pur, natural, and proper glory, and Beauty, and all the works
of God become as a well formed harp with every string wound up to its du, and
proper pitch, on which the Lord God may forever Delyt to make sweet Melody unto
himself, and they in him forevermor.

So that this Spirit of Apostasy, and faling away from the true christian faith,
and life took plas, and rooting, first in the Elders, and teachers of the flok,
which cursed seed grew, and spread it felf in, and throuh them, over al
Christendom, the whole being ons comprehended in the Church of Rom, and
subjected under that falls head, universal, Bishop or Pop (so caled) and took
hold and brouht forth its cursed fruits among al Nations, Kindreds, Tongu's,
and Peepel, of every Ranks, degree and order from the Highest to the Lowest, and
has had its Rooting, Growth, and Fulness, even in a most abominabel mystery of
Iniquity Corrupting the whole Body of Christendom so that in sted of being a
pur chaste virgin, fit to be married to the Lamb, and become his faithful Spous,
she becam a defiled strumpet, and even in her beginning bruised the Breasts of
her virginity, by harkening to, and obeying the voys of the old Serpent, that
adulteros Spirit in her, and so becam a harlot, and grevv to be the Mother of
harlots and abominations of the Earth, with whom the Emderors, Kings, Prinses,
and Rulers, and Peepel of al Ranks, and Degrees, Mal, and Femal have comited
Spiritual fornication, and bin mad drunk with the cup of her Abominations, and
she has sit as A queen upon many waters, which ar Peepels, Kindreds, Tongu's,
and Nations, being mad drunk with the Blood of the Profets, Saints, and
Martyrs of Jesus, even in her skirts is found the Blood of all that have bin
slain upon the fas of the Earth.

Thus this cursed Seed of the Serpent having taken plas and Rooting did
gradualy grow, and spread its self daily: and as it grew, spread, and prevayled,
so the true pur Seed of God, towit, the Seed Christ in Mal and Femal, was
oppresed, kept under and brouht into Bondag, and as the cursed fruits of the
Seed of the Serpent appeared, and were brouht forth, so the blessed fruits of
the true pur Seed of God, the truly Nobel plant of Gods Renown in mal and Femal
withered, and decayed, and that pur fresh appearans of the truly excelent Glory
which was (in mesur) as a dew from the Lord God of heven upon the Church of the
Romans, did by degrees, depart, and utterly wither away, throuhout Christendom.

The Apostasy first entering the false teachers (tho ons true having freely
received) from them over spued the body.
So that where as in her virginity, the Elders and teachers were tender, and
carfulover the flok of God, to whom the car thereof was comited, not by
constraint but wilingly, not for filthy Luker but of a ready mind not as Lords
over Gods heritag, but as Holy and good exampels to the flok, freely
communicating their Spiritual things, and partaking in lov of the Peepels
carnal things, who having food, and raiment had learned therewith to be content,
yea Holy Paul wrouht with his hands, that so the Gospel myt not be Burdensome or
chargabel to the Peepel.

But that covetos Spirit (which is the root of al evil) being thus crept in,
and having taken plas in some, there soon appeared such amongst them who were not
wiling to communicate freely of what they had freely received of God, but throuh
covetos practices, souht to make a gain of the flok, going in the way of Balaam
for gifts, and rewards, having Men's Persons in admiration because of Advantag
imbrasing this present World, loving to have the preheminens, and so being fallen
under the Spirit of deceit in themselves, grevv daily vvors, and becam deceivers
of others, and by good words, and fair speeches deceived the hearts of the
simpel, causing many others to bovv, and submit to their covetos ends, and to
follovv their vviked, and pernitios vvays, by reason of whom the way of truth
was evil spoken of, which cursed Spirit taking hold of the flok also, many
appeared who would not endur sound Doctrine, but after their own lusts gat to
them selves heap^ of sals Teachers, turning away their ears from truth unto
fabels; And so it came to pas by degrees, that such as refused to answer their
covetos desyrs, and to put into their months, they prepared war against them
counting them enemies to the ministry of Christ, and to be against the
propagation of the gospel, and such as bor Testimony against, and refused to
follow their Pernicios ways and Practices, were counted Erroneous, and Enemies to
the church, and good order, and so truth, and the followers thereof, got the
Nams of Error, and heresy, Non conformists, and disorderly Persons; And Deecit
and Error, and the Practisers thereof assumed to themselves the nams of holy
church, true Christians, and ministers of Christ, and in their own fallen wisdoms
set up On amongst them, as chief Father Overseer or universal Bishop, vvhos
successors were, and still ar caled, Christ's Vicars, Peter's successors, head of
the church, and Pops, whose Personal seat is ROM, but his spiritual seat the
Peepels, Kindreds, Tongu's, and Nations, who in the whole Body of them caled the
Clergy throuhout Christendom, ar the woman, that great City, that has and yet
Does rul over the Kings of the Earth, and so proceeded to erect Counsels, and
Synods, and in them to make many unryteos and Antichristian Laws, and Decrees,
which they call Spiritual, Holy, and Canonical Orders of Holy Church, imposing
their own commands, and inventions upon the Peepel as the Commands of God, and
Holy Church, assuming to themselves (in their fallen Wisdom) Power to bynd and
loos, to set up, and put down Powers and things, both in heven and in Earth, and
to retain, and remit the sins of the Peepel in their own wills for Money, and
Dishonest gain, and such as refused conformity to their wiked Orders, Carnal
laws, Commands, Canons, and Devilish injunctions, they cast forth as Heritics
suffering non to buy or sell, but such as would bow under their Spiritual
wikedneses, and receiv their Idolatros mark in their hands, or on their
forheds, and these their proud, Antichristian, Iezabelish, Luciferian practices
have reached al Christendom, mal, and femal, from the lowest to the highest of
you, and your predecessors in government, causing Emperors, Kings, Prinses and
Potentats, to bovv down to the sols of her feet, deposing, and disposing of
Powers, Potentats, Crowns, and Kingdoms, at their own wills, and plesurs
thereby falsely and blasphemosy pretending, to trampel upon the Powers, Pomp, and
Glory of this World, whylst themselves ar delyting, affecting, and living at eas
in, the sensual lusts, Pride and Plesurs thereof to the highest degree.

And so they proceeded to set Bounds, and limits to Congregations, caling them
Parishes, erecting houses with steepels, and Croses on them, and Bells, Baptized
in them, falsely and ignorantly caling them Churches, appointing, Arch and
inferior Bishops, Priests, Curats, with several other Kynds of Hyrlings over
them appointing them great Revenus, Stypends, and yearly Incoms, by Church
lands, gleab lands, tyths, taxes, easter reckonings, offerings, sprinkling of
Infants Churching of women, Marriages, Burials, and Prayers for the Ded, Dirges
and Masses for Redemption of souls out of Purgatory, Confession of sins,
Smoak-pennys, Indulgenses, Bulls, and Pardons etc. With many other Antichristian
ways and inventions to make, Marchandys of the Bodies, and souls of the Peepel
throuhout Christendom.

The elergys spiritual we^pons of wikednes failing, they fly to the carnal
weapons of the Magistrates.
But when they found that their own spirtual laws Canons, and helish church
orders were not of fors enuf to keep al in subjection to their carnal orders and
Inventions in Matters of Religion, and worship, and to answer their covetos;
and greedy desyrs after Money, tyths, and larg yearly Incoms they Addresed
themselves to the Potentats, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers of the Earth requyring
their help, and Assistans, pretending that they thereby would be servisabel to
God, and holy church, furtherers of the propagation of the Gospel, good
Countenansers, Patrons, and Incoragers, of the Ministers of Christ etc.

Whom they met with in the twylyt of the evening of the Blak, and Dark nyt of
Apostasy, as so many young men void of understanding, who by their good words,
fair speeches, and pretenses were easily drawn to go after her, as Oxen to the
slauhter, and fools to the corection of the stoks, making dyvers unreasonabel,
Penal, Wiked, Antichristian and bloody cruel laws, and statuts, with cursed
Inquisition courts, to fors al to a conformity, to their Antichristian,
Idolatros Canons, Institutions, Inventions, Injunctions, and Cursed Practices,
in matters of Religion and church worship, which are Extant, and upon Record
unto this day, for which they Rewarded the Potentats, Kings, and Rulers of the
Earth with the Nams of Defenders of the faith, etc. who also received dyvers of
them into their counsels to sit, and negotiat with them, about the spiritual
Affairs of holy church (falsely and blasphemosly so caled, pretending thereby to
bring al into unity, and uniformity to the true Christian Church, Faith, and
Practis, with which came in the treading the holy city under foot, and the
Prophesying of the witneses in Sak-cloth, and the flyt of the woman into the
wilderness, and so it came to pas that if any did bear Testimony against their
Apostat, Antichristian vvays, and Practices, or Refused to be conformabel to
their Invented Laws, Commands, and Canons in Matter of Religion, and worship
they were summoned to appear at their spiritual courts (so called) and if after
three tyms summonings or appearans, they would not deny the truth, and conform
to their church orders, and satisfy their covetos desyros, they proceeded
gradualy to censur, Fyn, cast out or Excommunicat them as heritics, ordering
that non should buy or sell, eat or drink with them, turning them over to the
vvorldly, or secular Powers of the Earth to deal with them acording to the
cruel, Antichristian, unmanly, Inhuman and Bloody Laws and statuts, which in
such cases they had (lyk bruit beasts, not Men) mad, and provided to wit the
Emperors, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers throuhout Christendom, who have bin as
cruel, Unnatural, beastly, and bloody in the execution of them, on thousands of
Gods Dear Innocent ons, as they were blyndly zealos, and Beastly in making of
them, spoiling many familys of their goods, cruely dealing with others in their
persons, by bonds, imprisonments, cruel rackings, torturings, and banishings,
secretly, and openly Murdering, and kiling the innocent Saints, Martyrs, and
faithful witneses of Jesus by hanging, and burning, with dyvers other ways of
open, and secret cruelty and murder, the cry of al which cruelty, blood and
Murder of the Innocent, has piersed the hevens, and entered into the ears of
the Lord God Omnipotent, who is now risen in his holy plas, and causing the
vengeans of his Tempel to tak hold of al his, and his dear, oppresed, cruely
tortured and murdered Innocent peepels, Unnatural, bloody and cruel adversarys,
and to aveng all the oppressions, crueltys, and Innocent blood, of his harmles
lambs and Saints, on them that dwell upon the Earth fro the least to the greatest
of them, even upon this present age and generation.

And here it may be noted how this old Serpent, which goes upon its belly,
has (throuh ages, and generations in those called Priests, Levits, spiritual men,
and the Clergy) conformed, and transformed it self, unto any thing, and into
any form and lyknes (except the life, and Power of godlynes, in to which it can
never com) provided they myt have the nations, and Rulers of the Earth, as
beasts, and asses for them to ryd on and their tresurs, and fruits of their
labors to be at their command, to feed, and pamper their bellys.

The World is the
Who, the Spirit of truth in and throuh the Holy Men of God, Profets, Christ
and Apostels, said were grievos Wolvs, such as mad their their God, making again
of the flok, would still and so ar its Ministers the sam they ever were, and so
many receiv the sam nams now from the sam Spirit.
exercysed in covetos practices, going in long Robs, loving to be called of men
Master, and to have the greetings in the market plas, and the uppermost Rooms at
Feasts, such as did say, and not do, teaching for Doctrine the tradiditions of
Men, Hipocryts, whyted walls, painted sepulkers, such as teach for her, and
Devyn for money, greedy dumb dogs, that cannot bark, loving every on his gain
from his quarter, preparing war against such as put not into their mouths,
filthy Dreamers, that defyl the flesh, runnng greedily in the error of Balaam
for gifts, and rewards, spots in their Feasts of charity feeding themselves
without fear, clouds without Water, carried about with Wynds, trees whose fruit
withers, twys Ded, and plucked up by the Roots, Raging wavs of the Sea
foaming out their own sham, wandering stars to whom the blaknes of darkness is
reserved for ever.

When Israel of old in the wilderness turned their Baks upon the God of their
salvation, this spirit in Aaron, and those confederat with him, complys with
them, and maks A Calves, and they said these be thy Gods o Israel which brouht
thee out of the land of Egypt, and built an Altar to it, and yet proclaiming,
and pretending to make A feast to the Lord siting down to feed, and pamper
their bellys together, and rising up to play, and when Israel in the laind of
Canaan, revolted from the Lord to serve the Idol Gods of the heathen, this old
Serpent in the Priests, and Levits, conforms there unto, Exercysing the several
forms, and Manners of Idolatros worship, to the several sorts of Ydols, and
Images provided they may not sail of provision for their bellys when Micah gat
a Reliv a Teraphim, an Ephod, A graven, and Molten Imag to erect an Idolatros
way of worship in his own family, he wants not a Levit to excercys a worship
there unto, provided he may have ten shekels by the year, Asuit of Apparel, and
provision for his Belly, and when Jeroboam mad Calvs, and sit them up in Dan,
and Bethel, he wanted not enuf to be Priests to exercijs a form of worship to
them, provided they may not fail of provision for their bellys, and when ydol
Tempels, and Images were Erected, for the worship of Baal, if Achab, and Iesabel
will have eight hundred and fisty Priests to exercys a worship therun to, they
redyly Conform, provided they may daily eat, and Drink at Iesabels tabel, and
when Israel took up an Imagination of A Queen of heven, they want not enuf of
those called Priests, spiritual men, and devyners to Exercys a worship to her,
provided they may have the Caks, Meat, and Drink offerings which are baked and
offered to her, to feed, and pamper their bellys.)

And when the spirit of Apostasy took hold on the gentiles Or Romans, turning
their ears away from truth unto fabels; this old Serpentyn spirit provided them
heaps of falls teachers, provided they may make a gain of them, and get filthy
luker by them, and exercys Lord ship, and Dominion over their Persons estats,
faith, and conscienses, whose Practis has bin for ages, and generations Past,
throuh the Apostasy to this day, to prepar war against such as put not into
their mouths, and to spoil the goods, whip, Banish, Tortur, Burn, and hang the
Persons, of the Innocent, who in the spirit and Power of the Lord have born
testimony against their ways of Idolatry, deceit, covetos Practices, Proud, and
Bloudthusty spirits.

And when Henry the Eigth of that nam, so caled, King of England, mad a breach
upon that cursed Idolatros sea of the Roman ecclesiastical Power, and threw of
the Pops supremacy, they (in words and outward profession) cast it of also, and
lyk unnatural children called their Mother the Whor of Rom, swearing Allegians,
and Supremacy to the King, and receiving their inductions into their Spiritualy
wiked Plases, Orders, and Proffits from him, and his Substituts, teling their
God in their Prayers, that in all Cases, and over al Persons, as well
Ecclesiastical as temporal the King is supreme head, and Governor, he confirming
them in their Church, and gleab lands, tyths, and yearly Stypends. and Revenus
to feed, and pamper their Bellys.

And when Mary his next Successor came into the Thron, and turned al as it were
bak again, then they fased quyt about, with the Dog to their own vomit
submiting, and conforming to that which they had in word, profession and
outward Practis denied, and cast of, viz. the Pops supremacy, persecuting, and
burning such as Heritics, who for Conscience sak toward God could not conform
thereunto, She securing to them their yearly Incoms to feed serve and pamper
their God, which was their Bellys.

And when Elizabeth her next Successor aros, then they turned quyt about again,
disgorging the vomit which before they had re-eaten, swearing allegians and
Supremacy unto her, teling their God in their Prayers, that she, the Queen,
was in all cases, and over al persons as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, supreme
head and Governor, He securing, and confirming to them their provision for their
Bellys. And when the Parliament which was in the Reyn of Charles the first of
that Nam so caled King of England, mad a defensyv War against the said King.

The said Parliament making provision for their Bellys erecting a Commitee to
provyd augmentations, and yearly Stypends some of 50 some of 100 pound, or mor,
and laying 2 or 3 Parishes somtyms together, that they myt have where with to
maintain them in pride and eas, and pamper their Bellys, they in words, and
outward Profession, and Practis, cast of not only the Top, and his Supremacy,
but also submit to lay asyd the us of their Servis-book of Common Prayers,
Organ Pyps, and other Music, Singing Men and Boys, Gowns, Flat-Caps, Surplises,
and Tippets, and ras even their King also out of their Prayers, stiring up the
Peepel to go forth to war against him, as to the help of the Lord against the
myty.

And when Oliver Cromwell their Servant had grasped the military power in to his
hands, and there with wrested; the Power of the three Nations out of the
Parliaments hands, (who was as the littel Horn spoken of by Daniel the Profet)
he provyding for their bellys, they in outward show and practis, cast of not
only Pop, and King but Parliament also, and own and addres themselves to him,
and his son, as their Lord Protector, Sereen Hy-nes, with dyvers other
flattering, and Blasphemos Nams, and Tytels; And when those caled the long
Parliament came into their seats again, they fell in again with them, casting of
their former Master, and Sereen Lord Protector.

And when Charles the II. Son of Charles the I was by another Parliament called in
and restored to the Thron, and Dominion of his Father, he provyding for their
Bellys, they Readyly swear Allegians, and Supremacy to him, and get their on
Surplises again and fall to reading their Book of Common Prayer, and bow, and
cring to their Idolatros Altars, and sing and Pyp, and play on their Music in
their worship, and if he will have them go bakagain, and be reconcysed to their
Mother, whom themselves call the whor of Rom, they will submit rather then to
endanger their Persons, or loos their provision for their Bellys.

Yet further this old Serpent if it find or see away to have as, and provision
for the Belly, by a free Contribution, has and can appear as a Pastor of a
seperat or gathered Congregation, and in words, and profession declar against
conformity to the World its ways, and worships, and impur communions.

Yet further seeing a way to go from plas to plas and have bak, and Belly
freely provided for, it has, and does transform it self as an Angel of lyt, or
Minister of Ryteosnes, appearing in the Assemblys of the Saints, and Children
of the lyt, intruding into the Declaration of things which they have not seen,
felt, tasted, nor experiensed in themselves, talking of the Salvation of God, of
Christ, of the lyt, Spirit, and Power of God in the inward parts, but by such
as truly dwell and walk in the lyt, life, wisdom, and Power of God, ar all the
ways and workings of that old Serpent in such, seen, felt, discerned, and
judged, who are the littel foxes that hurt the vyns with the tender graps and
their mouths (by the Power and Wisdom of God) must, and shall be stoped.

But in all ages (sins the entrans of transgression) such as have bin caled, and
sent forth by the Lord, appearing in the evident demonstration of the pur
Power, and spirit of God to declar his mind, and will unto Peepels, the spirit,
and power of darkness in Rulers, Teachers, and peepel could never bear with
such, but have mad a prey of them, counting them as not worthy to have a being,
turners of the world upsyd down, Pestilent fellows, blasphemers such as the
land could not bear their words, suffering at their hands mok-ing, Scorn,

And now the switneses prophefying in sak-cloth being near hand ended, and the
spirit of life in mesur entered into the witneses of God, and they standing on
their own feet appearing in the lyt, life, spirit, and power of God to vvarn,
and turn Peepel from the evil of their ways, from the darkness to the lyt, from
the Power of Satan to know, and obey the lyt, Christ that spirit, and power of
God in them, the whole body of sin and Death in the general, and in each
particular is moved heerat, and this causes siknes to seiz on the head, and
pain, and hevynes to fill heart, and is as Mortal, and Incurabel darts in the
liver, causing the old Serpent, the spirit, and power of darkness in the whole
body to plung as Leviathan in the sea, who in mesur already has, and daily mor
and morshal, make it to boil as a pot of ointment, this is as a flying roll with
the curs entering into the house of the thief the adulterer, and the whor,
causing the keepers thereof to trembel, and the strong men to bovv themselves,
head, and Tail, Branch, and Root, in the household of wikednes even al sorts, have
a mouth open against such as ar truly sent of God about this work.

The Potentats, King, Prinses, and Rulers of the darkness of this present world
may say, if peep^l be brouht to Christ the lyt, life, spirit and Power of God in
them, the gift of God, of whom the Scriptur says, that he is given of God to
be King, Ruler and Lawgiver to, and in his Peepel, Then they will com to Know
the law of the spirit, and life in their in ward parts, which sets free from
the law of sin, and death and to be fellow heyrs with Christ of that Kingdom
which is pur, Eternal, and Immortal which fades not away, and to Rein as
Kings upon the Earth, siting with Christ on his thron, svvaying the scepter of
Ryteosnes over al his enemies in them, in that Dominton which is living, and
Eternal, clothed with that Rob which is pur, and undefyled, crowned with a
Royal Dyadem, of pur, and perfect glory and beauty, unto such our Crowns,
Scepters, dignitys, Laws, and Rul vvil be rendered burthensom, and usles, unles
it be as a scourg amongst such who ar mor brutish then beasts, so that our
best, and safest way vvil be, to tak that vvholsom counsel, long sins given by
honest David, that man after gods own heart, to kis the Son, to bow, and be
subject to Christ the lyt, Wisdom, and Power of God in our own hearts, and
Inward Parts, that so in this the day of the Kindling of his wrath we may not
perish, with all the workers of Iniquity, and to lay asyd our fading crowns,
Robs, Scepters, and emty tytels of vanishing honor, and to sit even with his
littel despised flok, to whom the Everlasting Kingdom is bequethed by Christ
the eternal Father, and fountain of life, wisdom and Eternal Power, and vvayt to
feel his pur power in us who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that so we
may com to have an Inheritans with them that are sanctified in that Kingdom
which is never fading, and to vvear that Crown, and Rob, which is living, and
pur, in that Dominion, honor, and glory which Man can nether giv nortak away.

Those called the Clergy, the whole body of them, even al sorts of teachers, in all
forms to the highest in nam, without the power, may say, if peepel be brouht to
Christ, the lyt and life in them, which has Inlytened every on that comes into
the world, the gift of God, of whom the scripturs say, that he is given of God
to be a witness in Peepel, even his everlasting covenant, in the heart, and
inward parts, of which al who partak com to know the Lord from the least to the
greatest, such need not to teach on another, for the Lord, that spirit of truth
in them, teaches them, and leads them into al truth, the holy Anointing
which gives the true knowledge of al things, as the Apostel said, so that al
who abyd in it, and it in them, need not any man to teach them but as the sam
Anointing teaches them, which is the living fountain set open in the heart
and inward parts, for all to com freely unto, without money, and without prys.

Such vvil not, com to us and giv us of the fruits of their labor, tyths, or
larg sums of money by the year, to hear us say our invented prayers, and to talk
to them of that with we our selves rytly understand not, and ar out of the
life, and Practis of, having that most suer word of Prophesy in themselves,
which is the most suer, and infallibel teacher, and so we may shut up our
mashouses, or shop doors, and ceas ringing our Bells, for our trads of dishonest
gain vvil wither away, and com to nouht.

The great Generals, Commanders, and Officers in hostil, and military Affairs
may say, If Peepel be brouht to Christ, the Life, Lyt, and everlasting Covenant
of God in them, of whom the Scripturs of truth say, he is given of God the
Leader and Commander in Peepel, the Captain and Anthor of Eternal Salvation,
whose Commands are not grievos, who leads, and Establishes his Peepel in pleasant
ways of Lyt, Life, Lov, Peace, and Ryteosnes, whose banner and standard, is lov,
meeknes, truth, and Ryteosnes. Then the enmity in Peepel on against another will
com to be destroyed, and they reconcyled to God, and on unto another, such will
not com to list themselves under our standards, or fyt under other banners, and
be at our Commands, to murder and destroy on another, to serve the lusts, pride,
and cursed, ambitios wills of our Cruel oppressing Masters, the Emperors, Kings,
Prinses, and Rulers of the Earth, under falls pretenses, of serving God and their
Country, whose practis has bin, and still is, to make great and fair Promises to
get peepel in to their servis, and then make it Death, either to quit their
servis, or demand the performans of what they promis.

So that we may throw our Commissions of Array into the fyr, and beat our
swords, and other instruments of Blood, Murder, and Cruelty, into plouh shars,
and pruning hooks, and learn to make us of them as such, for our cursed trads
will die and wither away also.

Those called Judges, Sherifs, Majors, Baylifs, Justises of the peace, Doctors in
the law, Counselers, Advocats, Sollicitors, Atturnys, Clerks, and Scrybs, with all their dependencys may say, If Peepel com to be turned from the Darkness to
the lyt, and obey Christ the wisdom, and Power of God in them, of whom the
Scriptur says, that al Judgment is committed unto him by the Father, who is the
wonderful counseler, the Advocat, that pleads the cause of his Peepel, and
writes their nams in his Book of life, who is no Respecter of Persons, the
habitation of whose Thron is Ryteosnes, rewarding every on according to their
works, who leads al, who ar counseled by him in the pur paths of truth, peace,
lov, and ryteosnes: Then Peepel will com to do to on another as themselves would
be don unto, and to be a law unto themselves, to bear on with another, choosing
rather to suffer, then to do wrong or seek advantages by outward laws, on
against another, and that cursed, covetos, greedy Spirit of enmity in peepel,
on against another, and after the enjoyments of on another, will ceas. Such will
not wear out their bodies, vex, and torment, their Spirits, wast and consum
their estats, to attend on our Throns, and seats of brybery, injustis,
extortion, and oppression, and giv us larg, and unreasonabel fees to pervert
justis, whose practis has bin, and still is, insted of ending peepels
differenses in truth, and ryteosnes and reconcyling them together in peace, and
lov, to make them by far the mor at enmity, and irreconcylabel on to another,
inventing ways to lengthen out their contentios law suits, by removing them
from Court to Court, from City to Country in deceit, and unryteos pretenses,
and inventions, caled Writs of Error, Appeals, Habeas Corpuses etc. Especially
if the plaintifs, and defendants besuch as have Estats to answer, and supply
their greedy and covetos desyrs with Brybs, and larg and unreasonabel fees.

And so we may lay asyd our flat caps, Robs, and ruf garments of deceit, and
cast our Books, and Librarys of law cases into the fyr.

And Peepl being brouht into the pur bond of the everlasting Covenant, com to
be so Knit, and unyted together in lov and faithfulness on to another, that there
vvil be no need of any outvvard bills, bonds, or Obligations to make the^ honest,
and faithful to do the thing that is just, and equal on to another and so our
wiked trads will wither away also, and com to nouht.

Those called Doctors, tutors, fellows, and Masters of arts in schools,
colleges, and universitys, (in that learning which stands in that Spirit;
Power, and wisdom which is foolishnes with, and enmity against God) may
say, If Peepel be hrouht to Christ the lyt power, and wisdom of God in them and
to be tauht, and tutored thereby, then they vvil com to learn the blesed art of
denying al ungodlynes, and worldly lusts, and to live soberly and ryteosly in
this present world, and to speak the pur languag', and to know, and hold the
mysterys of faith in a pur Conscience, and Read the book sealed with seven
seals, which nether the learned or unlearned, vvithal their tongu's and arts
amongst us never could or shall be abel to understand or read, and their seed,
and offspring by, their holy Exampels, vvalking in the pur fear, life, and
wisdom of God before them, vvil com to be trained up in the sam.

Such will not need to com Or send their children to our Schools Colleges, or
universitys to be tauht to Read in books, of feined storys, lyng Fabels,
filthy, unsavory corrupt and corrupting words, and to act their parts on stages
in Comedys, and Tragedys, or to acquyr degrees in learning of those tongu's and
arts, standing in that wisdom which is Enmity against God.

So that we may shut up our Schools, Colleges, and university doors, and cast
our filthy books of liberal arts into the fyr, for our vviked trads of
corrupting Man-kynd vvil die, and wither away also.

Those called doctors of Physic, Chirurgions, and Apothecarys who ar members of
that corrupt body of wikednes acting their parts in the Devils craft writing
their receipts in Latin and putting Latin nams, upon the simpels of which they
make their compounds, and salvs etc. keeeping the peepel thereby ignorant of the
nature and virtue of what they administer unto them, having and using ways to
lengthen the continuans of peepels distempers, somtyms abating, somtyms
increasing then; putting larg and unreasonabel Rat's upon things with cost
littel or nothing sav gathering, especially if their patients have wherewith to
supply their greedy and Covetos desyrs of money.

The rys and continuans of whose, crafts was and is the intemperans inchastity
and inordinacy of Peepel. So al these may say, If Peepel be brouht to Christ the
lyt, and life of God in them, the good physician which purges, and cleanses
from al filthiness of fle^h, and spirit, and leads al, who ar led by him, in
ways of temperans sobryety, chastity, and in the fear of the Lord then they will
com to be Inhabitants of that city, which shall say they are not sik, and the
Lord to be com the health of their Countenanses, and their God; and abiding
therein, the ground of al Diseases, and distempers, in Body, soul and Spirit is
kept down in peepel. Such will not have need to com to us with their Urins, and
giv us larg sums of money for our Advys, and Counsel, to maintain us in pride and
eas, or to make us of our salvs, and deceitful Compounds: and so our deceitful
trads will die, and wither away also.

And al sorts of Merchants, and traders in Ships, Shops, wa^houses, Ins,
Victualinghouses, Fayrs, and Markets may say, If peepel be brouht to Christ,
the lyt and everlasting covenant of life in them, and be tauht and led by him in
them, then they will com to tak car for nothing, to tak no thouht what they shall
eat, drink or put on, but cast al their car upon the Lord, vvhos eternal power,
and wisdom daily produseth, sufficient to feed and sustain every cretur, and so
to become as on household or family, children of on Father heirs together in and
with Christ of the on Inheritans, caling nothing their own, enjoying al things
in the pur fear, life, lov, and wisdom of God, as in on common ryt, or intrest.

Such will not have need to make us' of our deceitful Inventions of money, to buy,
sell and make Marchandyz of the gists, and several stors of the house of God, which
al flow from the on gist, which he freely gav to the children of men, without
respect to Persons, neither will such frequent or make us of our Ships, Shops,
Ins, victualing-houses, fayers or markets.

And so we may lay asyd our ships, and shut up our shops, war-houses, Taverns,
and victualing-houses, and ceas frequenting our fayrs, and Markets, for no Man
will buy our wars any Mor, and so our trads of deceit, and oppression will die and
wither away also.

Those called Landlords, who in the spirit of the world have raked great quantitys
of the Earth into their hands may say. If peepel be bourht to Christ the lyt and
way of peace, and salvation in them, then having food and raiment, they will
learn there with to be content, and not Covet or desyr to grasp farms into their
hands to serve their own particular intrests, and to spend their tym in sweating
toil, car, and labor, as under the curs, to giv us larg, and yearly rents by
sums of money, to manitain us in pride, lusts, eas and fulness, so that our Lands
must ^therly unstok-ed, and until-ed, or we must let such us' it, who vvil
only let us have a part of the produs thereof with them, for our necessary
supplys of food, and raiment, and so our Lordly, Covetos, and oppressing way
of farming Lands, for great, and unre sonabel sums of money by the year, vvil
die, and wither away also.

Those called by-way thievs, and Robers may say, if Peepel be brouht to Christ the
lyt, the strong Tower of sasty and eternal salvation in them, then the us' of
money will com to be laid Asyd by them, and as for food and raiment, if we be
Really in want thereof, the lov of Christ in them will make them wiling to
supplys, our real necessitys, so that if we com to them on the by ways, filver,
and gold they will have non, and if we should tak their cattle they ryd up on, or
cloths from their baks, it would be an unkyndnes offered to such as ar really
wiling to feed and cloth such as ar really in want, and necessity, nether can
we lykly pas long with such things without being discovered, and so become
lyabel to sham, and suffer the strok of Justis from the hand of the Magistrate
for the sam, And therefore it will be mor manly, and honorabel for us to fall into
some way-of honest and moderat labor, that so we may eat our own bred, and wear
our own cloths in Peace, and quyetnes without condemnation in our own
conscienses or fear of sham by the strok of Justice.

Those called way going Peepel, ydel and sturdy begers, may say, if peepel be
brouht to Christ, the lyt, and wisdom of God in them, then alth o the bowels of
the lov of Christ in them constrain them to do good unto al as need and
necessity requires, yet if we com to beg of them having bodies abel to work,
they may justly say unto us that such as will not labor ouht not to eat, and may
offer us labor, and food, which if we refus the on, they may justly with hold
from us the other.

So that we shall be forsed to lay asyd our ydel, dronish trad of beging and
either to work or starv, which if we do our bloods will be upon our own heds.

The whole body of the world which lys in wikednes, may say if peepel be brouht
to Christ the lyt, wisdom Power, and eternal salvation of God in them, then the
end of the world even of al things will be com upon them as it was on the
Apostels, and Saints in their days, and all the many vvays and vviked
inventions, and Practices which have had their Rys and Continuans to this day,
throuh the entrans of sin and trangression by the first Adam, will be ended and
finished, and Eternal ryteosnes brouht in, and established in Man-kynd, and
Man-kynd in it, and al Rul, Authority and Power, it standing in the spirit, and
Power of the old Serpent put down; and destroyed, and the whole creation
delyvered from the bondag of corruption into the glorios liberty of the Sons of
God, and al things in heven, and Earth, visibel, and invisibel reconcyled to God
in him, and every Knee mad to bovv, and tongu' to confess to him, to the glory,
and Prays of God the eternal Father, and Pur fountain of lyt, lov, wisdom,
glory, and Dominion, who is in, throuh, and over al (God blesed for ever, this
is the God whom many have waited for, and this is the salvation expected by him,
and for ever blesed be his Nam, as non ever did, so nether have they waited on
him in vain, nor bin ashamed of their hop in him, for according to his promis
declared, and recorded by, and throuh the holy Profets, he has now set to his
hand again the second tym, for the redemtion and salvation of himself, his own
oppresed seed in the ends, or inhabitants of the Earth, not only in Man-kynd,
but even in the whole creation, who works so as non can hinder, and shall not
be discoraged til he has set Ryteosnes in the Earth, surly his salvation is ny
unto them that fear him, which shall cause the Pur Lyt, knowledge, and glory of
the Lord to overspred, fill, and dwell in the whole creation, and mercy and truth
to meet together and Ryteosnes, and Peace to kis and imbras each other, and truth
to spring out of the Earth, and Ryteosnes to look down from heven, and
everlasting joy to rest upon the heds of all the Sons, and dauhters of Syon, and
al cause of syghing and sorrow to flee away forever mor.

But to proceed, this cursed seed of the Serpent took Root, and the mystery of
Iniquity has abounded, and over spread al Christendom, the abomination which
makes desolat, was and still is standing where it ouht not, abominabel
covetosnes, Pride, Cruelty, Oppression, Idolatry, and sheding the blood of the
innocent saints of God, has bin, and still is Practiced in thee O Christendom
even with a bold and impudent fas, which has long cried aloud, how long Lord
holy and true, do thou not judge, and aveng' our blood on them that dwell on the
Earth, and notwithstanding all the Abominations, Oppressions, Idolatry, murders,
and great provocations against the Lord, which ye, and your predecessors have
bin, and still ar so openly, and impudently found guilty of, yet exceeding long
and larg has bin, the Patiens, and forbearans of God toward them and you, and
many have bin the Fatherly warnings, chastysments, and vvholsom counsels of the
Lord toward them and you, but ye, and your predecessors ar found mor
abominably guilty of those abominations crueltys, oppressions, Idolatrys, and
sheding the blood of the Innocent, then the Jews of old were, for which the Lord
mad us of your predecessors of the Roman Power, as instruments in his hand, to
execut his just, and dredful wrath, and vengeans on them and ye have not only
moked Gods messengers, despised his word, misused his Profets, and Saints as
they (towit the Jews,) did before you, but ye have mad and cruelly executed
dyvers Antichristian, Cruel, bloody laws and statuts to keep them from coming
amongst you, and to Murder, Kill, Burn, and destroy them if they open their
mouths on the behalf of God, his truth, and ryteosnes, or bear their faithful
testimony against the cruelty, oppressions, Idolatrys, and sheding the blood of
the Innocent, exhorting them to repent, and turn from your, and their evil,
cruel, and abominabel ways, and Practis, which ye, and your predecessors were,
and still ar found guilty of.

And so both they and you have returned unto God, and his dear saints, and
servants (which he has raised up, and many tyms sent amongst you in Lov, and
mercy,) hatred for their lov, yea cruel torturings, and murdeings, even the
worst of evil for their good will toward you, al which provokations, crueltys,
murders and rebellious practiced against the Lord in his dear precios innocent
ons, are Exceedingly heihtened and aggravated in you even to the highest pitch in
regard that the have hard and have upon record before you in the Scripturs of
truth, the many precepts, and commands of God, against such abomniabel ways,
and practices, the many woes, Judgments, and dredful Curses denounsed by God
against al who ar found guilty of them and the many Just and Ryteos plagu's,
wrath and dredful Judgments of God Executed on the ages, and generations past
before you, who were found guilty of the lyk abommations; but mor especially in
regard that the Lord mad your predecessors instruments, as an Iron rod in his
hand to execut his Just wrath, and dredful Indignation upon the Jews for the
sam sins and abominations, which your predecessors, and ye have bin and still ar
found guilty of, and verily the day is now com, in which ye will find, that he
is a God that changes not but abyds still the sam as well in Power ryteosnes,
wrath and justis, as in long forberans, patiens, goodness, and Mercy.

The Apostels, and true Ministers of Christ, were not mad so by men, nor sent
forth in the will or by the approbation of Man, nether did they Minister forth
from the Letter, what others had received, by their own acquyred parts,
learned at Schools, and universitys for money, nether did they complain or
addres themselves to the Potentats, and powers of the Earth to make laws to fors,
and compel peepel to giv them tyths, great sums of Money or yearly Incoms for
their prea^hing, or to defend them in their Doct^ins, faith, Church Order,
Holy, and Christian practices, which they held forth, and walked in, or to fors
Peepel to conform thereunto upon pain of being fined, imprisoned, racked,
tortured, banished, hanged, burned, or cruelly put to Death, No, No.

But they were caled, and sent forth by the will, Power, and appointment of God
the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, ministering forth freely, and with a ready
mind, what they had freely received of God, throuh the Revelation of Jesus
Christ the true Lyt, and gift of God in them; What they had seen, felt, handled,
and tasted, of the gras, Eternal Word, and living pur Power of God in
themselves, they preached forth, and declared to others, to the end that they
also to whom they preached, myt have fellowship with them in the sam, whose
fellswship was in the Father, and in the Son Jesus Christ, they ministered forth
according to the mesur of the gift, of the Spirit of the free gras of Christ in
them, they were tauht of God, and had learned of the Father, and there by mad
abel Ministers of the New Testament, the eve^lasting Covenant of God, and
needed not outward laws of Man to fors Peepel, to maintain them or giv them
Money for their preaching, but such as becam obedient to the faith, and
Christian practices, which they preached and walked in, the constraining Power
thereof wrouht such a lov of God in them to whom they preached, which drew them
forth in lov freely to communicate of their carnal substans to them, as their
Needs, and necessitys required, who having food, and raiment had learned
therewith to be content: And the way and weapons which they took and used to
defend their Holy Faith, Christian Doctrins and practices by, and to convins
gainsayers, and Herities, were not outward or carnal, not spoiling of goods,
prisons, banishments, racks, hanging, burning, and other cruel ways of open,
and secret Murder, but Holy and Spiritual, The saints weapons
even by the armor of ryteosnes on the ryt hand; and on the left, by arguments
of sound truth, pur, and wholesome doctrins and Holy, harmles, innocent, and
godly conversations; Nether was the end of their preaching, that Peepel should
be ever learning and never abel to com to the knowledge of the truth, nor that
Peepel should be only talking of God, The end of the true Ministers Preaching.
Christ and Holiness, and abyd strangers, and enemies to, and ignorant of the
lyt, life, Power, and Spirit of God, Christ, and godlynes in themselves, but the
end of their preaching was to bring Peepel to the knowledge, feeling, and
obediens of the Spirit, pur power, and presens of God in themselfs, and to be
tauht thereby of God, which mesur of the Spirit of gras in mal and femal, is the
Spirit of truth which leads into al truth even the Holy anointing which
teaches al things, even the deep things of God, teling them to whom they
preached, and wrote, that a mesur of the Spirit of gras was given to every on to
profit with all, and that the Lord is that Spirit, they labored to turn Peepel
from the darkness to the lyt, from the power of Satan to the power, and Spirit
of God in them, given to them by Christ the true Lyt, whom Holy Johon said, was
the true Lyt, which inlyteneth every Man that comes into the World and to turn
Peepel from dumb Ydols, and Ignorant, Id latros, and Superstitios ways and
forms, to know, serve and obey the living and true God in them, even to present
al perfect in Christ, whom truly to know, obey, and constantly to follow, is
eternal life, salvation, happynes, pur rest, and peace forever mor.

But thy Clergy or Spiritual men (so caled) even the whole body of them from head
to foot, ar found out of the Call, Power, Doctrine, faith, order, Practis,
Maintenans, and holy Conversation of the true Ministers of Christ, even in a
spirit of Dyrect Opposition, and contrary ty to them, so that they being
Ignorant of the call of God, have caled, and sent forth on another in their Own
wills, and appoyntments, and have run greedyly for gain and advantag, without
being sent of God, and being gone from the Power of God to uphold and provyd for
them in their Minissty, and defend them in their Doctrins, faith, and
practices, they have gone to the Powers of the Earth, who have mad, Antichristian,
and cruel laws to fors Manitenans from the Peepel for them, even from such as
nether own nor hear hem, and here in these Babylonian Merchants have bin mor
cruel, and unreasonabel then all the other sorts of Babylonish Merchants, who
cannot compel others to buy their wars, much les fors, others to pay for it,
who have nethe^ bouht or received it, who together al sorts of them ar but a
Den of thievs, and Robers in my Fathers house, they came not in by the e^^rnal
door, to wit Christ, the lyt, wisdom and Power of God, and they must al be
whiped out of the Tempel and overturned even root, and branch, their coming and
work has bin, and still is, but to steal, murder, and destroy.

That Spirit which has and does buy and sell the gifts of God, which do al flow
from the on gift, must perish with its money, out of the Bottomless pit it came,
and thither it must return, the things of Caesar must perish with Caesar, but the
things of God the former of al things must be ordered in his own pur wisdom,
lyt and counsel: And as there must not be a Beger so ouht there not to be a dron
in Israel, and as that Spirit which would lay on daily tasks, and tal of brik
on others, is to be denied so also that spirit which would live at eas in the
flesh, upon the fruits of others labors, is to be rejected, al Mountains must
now, be leveled, and al valys raised, and the pur, Plain, and pleasant path of
wisdom, ryteosnes, and holiness, is that in which all the truly ransomed of the
Lord must for ever dwell, and walk. This the Plain, and pur 'path in which the
fool cannot err. This is the Jewel, the pearl of Invaluabel Prys, the truly well
becoming Ornament, which becomes the house of God for ever, to wit holiness, and
as every cleansed tabernakel of the most by coms to savor, and shyn forth in
this, so every on in in his Tempel will com truly to set forth his living pur,
and eternal praises, and and appear to be really the lyts of the world, and the
salt of the Earth, which al who loos the savor of com to be the very worst and
most unprofitabel of Mankind, not withstanding they may profes or talk of hy
things, where the true savor ons receved coms to be lost, the most stinking
dunghill is to be prefered before such; MARK THAT.

And further mor they being ignorant of the doctrine and faith of Gods elect
which purifyeth the heart, and works by lov, and keeps the heart clean,
they have ignorantly framed up a faith in their own fallen wisdoms, which they call
their Creed, but cannot them selves giv a Rational account thereof to the bottom
using therein Scriptur Expresions, being ignorant of the mind of the Spirit of
Christ in them that gay them forth.

And having thrown asyd the true church order which the A postels, and holy
ministers of Christ walked in, and practiced, they have mad and invented to
themselves, many Nams, ranks, and orders in their own wills in their church, to
wit, Pops, Cardinals, Jesuits, Friars, Monks, Abbots, Nuns etc. with many mor,
Putting the nams of Jesus, and of Saints up on them, whylst they themselves ar
found strangers and emenys to the life of Christ, and the holy conversation of
the saints, in themselves and in, others, and wanting the pur Power, and
Demonstration of the Spirit of God in their Ministry, and practices to draw
Peepels h^arts to Imb^as, and conform thereunto they have caused the potentats,
and Powers of the Earth to make penal, and cruel laws and statuts to fors a
conformity th^^ unto, or else to spoil their goods, Imprison, banish, rack,
hang, Burn, murder, and destroy their persons, under a falls pretens of their
being Heritics, which ye O Potentats, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers throuh out
Christendom, and your predecessors, have Unnaturally, and cruelly lyk Bruit
beasts put in execution in an abundant mesur.

Furthermor they being found naked of the true Christian clothing, which is the
ryteosnes of Christ by faith in the lyt, Spirit, and Power of God, have in their
wills Invented to them selves many strange; and foolish forms, and fashions of
outward habit there by to cause the Spirits of Peepel to fall down under them, and
giv worldly Honor, Respect, and Reverens unto them, which, are not of God. And
being void of the Demonstration of the Power, and Spirit of God in the exercys
of their worship, they have Dyvers invented garbs, vain, and foolish syts,
Idolatros images, and picturs, several sorts of Music, with singing men, and
boys, which tend only to pleas, and gratify, that Spirit in Peepel which is
Enmity against God, and insted of teaching Peepel from the motion and Dictats
of the Spirit of Christ in them, they pleas their vain ears with fabels and
orations, which they in their fallen wisdoms have raked, and formed to gether out
of old historys, the wrytings of heathen Poets, Philosophers, ancient Fathers,
and Commentators with their own Imaginations from the Scripturs, with dyvers
other feyned storys, lying syns, and wonders, al which Renders their worship to
be mor lyk unto Astag' play rather then the true worship of God.

And as for all other sorts of worshipers to the byest in Nam Form and
profession, even such as profes to dwell, and walk in the pur Eternal lyt, and
life of God in them, thus says the Lord God, al Assemblings which are not in my
pur Nam which is lyt, and al Declarations, Invocations, or Intercessions which are not from the true, pur movings, and dictats of my put Four, and Spirit ar
but a stink in my Nostrils, tho words of truth, yea true words may be uttered
forth; Such ar they who run without being sent by me says the Lord, These ar
the offerers with strangfyr, this is the going up by steps unto the Altar of
God, which discovers the Nakedness, and the noys of the hammer in the building
of the Tempel, which was forbiden, and the stretching forth of the hand to stay
the Ark which was rewarded with Death, and althuoh such strangfyr Kindlers may
for a tym, walk in the sparks of their own Kindling, yet in the end this must
be their portion from me says the Lord, even to ly down in sorrow. These ar
they who in Nam, Profession, and words, would seem to giv forth out of their
earthen vessels the true tresur, which flows from the streaming forth of the
pur river of the water of life Eternal; Butar found only to be sailing in Gallys
with Oars, and in gallant Ships driven with fires Wynds, artificial sayls, and
other cunning Artifices, and eloquent Oratory, framed in their own strength and
wisdom, which as a pleasant Pictur they hold forth for others to behold, her and
be affected with, in whom the mystery of iniquity is wound up to the highest
pitch, who ar even the most beautiful painted ha^lot, even Satan trans ormed
as an Angelo lyt, appearing through them as Ministers of ryteosnes and life, who
ar really but the Ministers of sin, and Death, whose reward will be according to
their works, but the least true birth of pur lyt and life can feel discern, taste,
and savor the differens, tho not abel to utter forth the sam in words, and the
day of the Lord which is now com will be upon al such cunning Artificers, and
eloquent Orators, and on the Gallys, and gallant Ships in which they sail with all their painted pleasant Picturs, Their mouths must, and will be stoped, for all
flesh must now be put to sylens be^or the Lord, and the Lord alon exalted in
this his glorios (yet most dred^ul and terribel) day, in throuh, and over al.

The vayl of the Tempel must now be rent from the top to the bottom, even the
vayl of covering which is overal flesh must now be removed, no covering shall
now be abel to hyd any from the Ey which is pur, but only what is of his own
pur Power, and Spirit, the most bas, weak, lovv and foolish things of God,
must now be set a top of the highest Mountains, even upon the head of the most
glorios, strong, and wise est of Men, Eternal Glory, and living pur praises be
to his Nam alon who is worthy, overal forever mor.

Further mor^they, to wit thy Clergy, or spiritual men (so caled) o
Christendom, being ignorant of, and alienated from the spirit of Christ in them
which alo can make a true separation from the world, and crucify the fpirit
thereof, with the Affections, and lusts in mal, and femal, they have erected to
them felvs fayer, and sumptuos buildings, caled Abbys, Cloisters, Fryerys and
Nunnerys, compasing them about with hy walls, in habiting many together in them
under a falls show, and pretens of separation from the world, its lusts wiked
ways, and practices, and to be wholly devoted to the ervi of God al their days,
whylst many of themselves live there at eas ^n the flesh, lyk filthy drous,
pa^^pering their bellys daily, with delitios ^ar living in plesurs, and in the
lu^^, and carnal desyrs of the flesh, and inordinat affections thereof,
oftentyms secretly murdering the fruits of those carnal lusts, and plesurs which
they exercys on with another.

And being void of the true learning of the Father, which makes men true
Ministers of Christ, and ered from the Spirit of truth, which is the true
Original of the Scripturs of truth, which only can open the mind of the Spirit,
and Mystery of godlynes therein declared; They have gone to Schools, and
Vniversitys, and there for Money have learned, and acquyred, Parts, Tongu's, and
Arts in their own fallen Wisdom: And so have limited, fitnes to be Ministers of
Christ, and ability to teach others, only to such as by Bodyly Payns, Study,
and Industry have learned of men to speak or read, Hebrew, Greck, and Latin,
etc. caling those the Original, and the letter of the Scripturs the Word of God,
whereas the Word of God is that which livs, and abyds for ever, near in the
Mouth and in the heart that al may hear it, and obey it; And so having slain
that just on in them, and crucified the Son of God a fresh unto themselves, and
put him to open sham, by their Antichristian filthy, and abominabel Spritual
whordoms, and Abominations. They, (Pylat lyk) set their Tongus, To wit, Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin, abov the only true head Christ Jesus the Lyt, Wisdom, and
Power of God in mal and femal; Who being crucified and slain and lying as Ded
in a Sepulker in thee O Christendom, they (to wit the Clergy so caled) ca us
the Potentats, Prinses, and Rulers, to make bloody, and cruel laws the execution
whereof becam as a great ston upon the mouth of the sepulker, to keep him (if
possibel) for ever from rising any mor in thee, and thy inhabitants, O
Christendom, seting the Soldiers, your Military Power to watch, keep down, and
destroy the least appearans of him in any.

Further mor themselves and ye the Potentats, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers, and
their and your Predecessors, being ignorant of the true Cross of Christ* which
every true Christian ouht daily to tak up, and follow Christ in, which cross
crucifyeth the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof in mal and femal, and
destroys that unnatural, and Blood thirsty Spirit of enmity which is in
Man-kynd against God, and on another, ye have caused to be mad many flowish
Croses of Gold, Silver, Bras, Iron, VVaod, and Ston, which ye in your
Idolatros Spirits, carry about you, hang, and sit up in your houses, and a rop
of your Mal-houses or Idol Tempels, and in your Courts', Markets, Streets, and
Hy ways, to which Peelel both Hy, and Low, Rich and Poor, small and great, Mal
and Femal, have and yet do bow, and do Reverens unto them, And not knowing what
the true Imag of God and Christ is, nor the virtue, and fellowship of his
sufferings, by a Holy Conformity unto his Death, and participation of his pur
Divyn Nature and life in the inward Man, living the life of God in this world in
the daily exercys of true wisdom Ryteosnes, and holiness, which renders al who
truly know, and enjoy it, to be the true imag of God, and Christ Jesus, who
was the expres imag of the father, ye with your predecessors have mad, and
caused to be mad a multitud of abominabel Idolatros images, and ydols in their,
and your spiritual adulteros, abominabel, blasphemos, and idolatros hearts, and
mynds, to represent God, Christ, the spirit, angels, and saints, mad of gold,
silver, bras, iron, wood, and ston after the manner of the ignorant, and
idolatros heathen of old, which they, and you have caused to be set up in your
hyh ways, Markets, Streets, Courts of judicatur, and plases of your idolatros
worship, and set up, and hang in your houses, and carry about you, throuhout
Christendom, filing the land with ydols, and picturs, and abominabel images of
jelosy there by grievosly provoking the just, and ryteos Lord God omnipotent, to
cause his fires wrath, indignation, and jelosy to smoke, and burn against you,
having worshipped the works of your own hands, even that which your fingers have
mad, and the mean Man has bowed down, even Mal and Femal, Rich and Poor, Bond
and Free, Small and Great, and ye the Potentats, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers and
great ons have Debased your selves beforthem. THEREFORE WILL I NOT FOR GIV OR SPAR
YOU, says THE LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT.

And ye (the Potentats Kings, Prinses and Rulers, throuhout Christendom and
your predecessors, having forgoten, and turned your baks upon, and become
Ignorant of the God that formed you, and raised you up, in whose hand and at
whose dispos, your breath, lyvs, and dominons ar, it has rendered both them and
you void of that nobel Spirit of true wisdom, counsel, gravity, Prudens, virtue.
and holiness which appeared ons in some of your predecessors, rendering them
famos, terribel, and dredful to their enemies abroad, and their Government lovly,
and desyrabel at hom, among the several Nations, tongu's and languages, under
their subjection. They and you becam and still remain, lyk Cruel Uunatural
bruit-beasts or evening wolvs. turning that sword which ons rendered them
dredful, and terribel to their enemies, unto their own bowels, therewith by wars,
division, stryf, and contentions, murdering, kiling, and destroying on Another,
in the wikednes, pride, and stoutnes of their, and your ambitios hearts, and
mynds, quarreling on with another about Erthly dominions, greatness, and
preheminens, emty blasphemos Antichristian Nams, and tytels of worldly
Antichristian, and Spiritually wiked Honor and Dominion (to wit) Master,
worshipful, Hy and Myty Lords Stats General, most Illustrios, Nobel, Vertuos,
Honorabel, Excelent, Sereen, Earls, Duks, Lord Protectors, Prinses, Kings, and
most invincibel Emperors, Cardinals Eminency, Archbishops and Bishops Gras, and
Ryht Reverend Fathers in God, common Priests Reverend Divyns, etc. with the
Pops Holiness, and all the other Nams, and Tytels assumed in the Military, Civil
and Ecelestastical Powers, (so caled) which are not of Christ, but came out of
the bottomless pit, and ar Erthly sensual, and Devilish, and into the Lak of
Gods most Just, Ryteos, and Dredful wrath and vengeans, Plagu's, and
Indignation must that Power, and Spirit be cast, in which ye now stand, and by
which ye ar acted; Ye have not learned of Christ to lov on another, who said to
Peter put up thy sword into its plas, for all that tak the sword must perish by
the sword, and here by both ye, and your government, ar rendered odios, yea even
most intolerably burdensome, cruel and opresing in the sit of God, and in the
hearts of the Peepel over whom ye rul, lading them with Burdens, taxes,
oppresions, labor, and Sor travels in blood, and wars on against another, And
although ye call your government The Holy Roman Empyr, and the Pop blasphemosly his
holiness, and the Rest of that spiritual, Babylonian Antichristian crew, holy
Bishops, patrons, and Fathers of holy Church (so caled) and profes your selves
to be Christian Emperos, Kings, Prinses Rulers, and Peepel yet ar ye found
void of the true Christian Spirit, and life, and bav not learned of Christ nether
ar found in his nor the true Christians ways, and practices, who said lov your
enemies, bles them that Curs you, do good to them that hat you, pray for them
that persecut you, and despytfully us you, and be not overcom of evil, but over
com evil by doing good: But ye have bin mor barbaros, and still ar mor cruel to
your Enemies, then any that ever I have heard, seen, or red of causing them to be
with Yrons on their legs lyk horses, nyt and day and their hands in Yrons,
chaining them by the neks lyk dogs to a post or wall, with their feet in the
stoks lying on the ground, with litel under them, cruelly torturing their bodies
to fors them to confess and tell what there outward estats ar, or what rich, abel
friends they have, there by to procur great sums of money for their ransoms,
causing them to work daily with those Yrons upon their legs, provyding no cloths
for them, allowing them only water to drink, and hardly bred enuf of the
courser sort to fustain their outward man yea causing some of them to work
without allowing them either bred or money, hardly permiting them to fetch good
water, or go to such as pased by them, where they were at work to beg; buying and
seling them on to another as slavs, lyk beasts for money, according to what was
of old forseen, and fortold, by the Spirit of prophesy in John, the faithful
witness of Jesus recorded in the Scripturs of truth, of al which Inhuman,
antichristian cursed, and cruel dealings, my self, and companion in travel, have
bin not only Ey and ear witneses, but also in mesur, have gone throuh, suffered,
and sustained.

So that this seed of the serpent, even that cursed Spirit of apostasy and
faling away from the true Christian Spirit, purfaith, and life having taken root
in your predecessors it has continued in its cursed operations fruits, and
working in you to this very day, and hens it has com to pas that true wisdom is
Perished from thy anients, good and wholesome counsel is not to be found among
the honorabel ons and insted of governing the Peepel in truth, peace, and
ryteosnes, behold on al hands a grievos cry of vyolens, spoil and oppression,
insted of unity and concord, behold, stryf, debat, rumors of cruel and dredful
wars, on al hands.

And not having Christ to be your head, Bishop, King, Priest, Counseler,
Lawgiver, and horn of your salvation, ye ar become broken to Pieces, and
divyded, under dyvers heds, Bishops, Kings, Blasphemos nams, heaps and horns,
pushing, stryving, contending and waring, on against another in blood, and
cruelty, whereby whole Christendom has bin mad an Akeldama or field of blood,
even a plas, not of kyndnes and good entertainment, but of cruelty, and Murder,
and to bury strangers in even Christ the true and Ryt heryr, and Lord of al who
has bin long as a stranger in the Earth as driven out of his possession; but
now com to demand, recover, and posses his inheritans which is the purchase of
your denying, betraying, and Spiritually Murdering, and Crucifying the Lord of
life, and glory.

And thy Peepel O Christendom being Ignorant of Christ who was given of the
Father to be Gods salvation in the ends of the Earth, even the way, the truth,
and the life in Mal, and femal, to lead, out of stryf, and discord up to God, in
vvays of lov; truth, peace, and ryteosnes, whole Christendom is become lyk the
Raging sea, tos ed to and fro with every vvynd of Doctrine, running al on heaps,
contending, and quarreling on with another, about emty nams, ways, forms and
professions in Religion, on sort or sect, crying lo here, another lo there, a
third, this is the way, being al of them strangers, aliens and enemies to the
Power and Spirit of God in themselves, and in his Peepel, and Ignorant of him
who is the former of al things, and is without form, was before al forms or
visibel appearances, and abyds the sam when they have their end, wrangling,
and contending about outvvard bred and wyn, and water Baptisms and Carnal
ordinanses, which were figurs in their tym, but the living bred of God which
comes down from heven in his saints, and the Pur Wyn of the Kingdom of God,
which refreshes, and norisheth the life which is pur, eternal and Immortal of
God in the Imvard parts, is not truly fed on, or drank of by them, And the on
Baptism which saves, even the pur living water of life which cleanses, and
washes the Inward man, and sprinkleth from an evil conscience, is not known,
felt, or truly Experiensed in them.

Betwixt those two, to wit the Beast, and falls Profet, the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Power (so caled, has the lamb, slain from the foundation of the
world which lies in wikednes, bin crucified afresh, as betwixt two thieves, the
on being accuser, (the old accuser of the Brethren) and the other Judge: and the
third (to wit the Military Power) the executioner which is the Barrabas which
they have chosen in rejecting, and crucifying of Jesus, by whom all the
Insurrections, Murders, divydings of his garment (to wit, the creation) into
particular Intrests, and casting lots on his vestur, has bin don, and
committed, sins the entrans of transgression to this day, vvhos practis has bin
and still is to Rob, spoil, and plunder the nations, of their tresurs, and
fruits of their labors, to uphold themselves in pride, lusts, eas, Fulness,
cruelty, and oppression over the Nations, under falls pertenses of protecting,
and teaching them, in vvays of Peace, ryteosnes and salvation. These ar the
Phisicians of no valu, and the Nations have bin the woman with the bloody Issu,
that has gone to them for help, and cur, but notvvithstanding well ny al has
bin spent on them the bloody Issu has not bin healed, but rendered by far the
mor Incurabel; but blesed be the Lord, the woman has now met with Jesus, the
good Phisician, and gotten a touch of the hem of his garment and feels in her
self the healing virtue, and the Bloody Issu is in mesur stayed, which blesed
healing virtue shall not ceas vvorking til it pas throuh the whole body of the
Creation, and the cur, and redemtion thereof be completed. the three that bear
Record in bell.


These, tovvit, the Dragon, Beast, and falls profet, ar the three that bear
record in Earth and hell, which ar on, and Agree in on, to wit, the Spirit of
the old serpent in man, its corrupting of Man-kynd, and its cursed fruits and
operations throuh Man kind.

And here may be noted that which I may call the living or essential differens,
betwixt the living, and true Lord God, and the Devil, the old Serpent, the God
of the World, about which the learned Disputers, eloquent Orators, and
Comentators in the Spirit of the World, have bin so long Disputing, contending
and writing larg Commentarys, Contradictory on to the other; But having nether
the Key of David, nor the Heffer of Sampson to Plow with, could never truly
open or unfold the Matter, and al tho they have mad us' of the Words of the Holy
Men of God recorded in the Scripturs, yet ar they therein found falls witneses,
being strangers, and aliens from that Holy and Pur Spirit, Lyt, and Wisdom of
God in the Holy Profets, by which they spak and wrote.

The living, and true God is that Eternal, Pur Spirit of Lyt, Life, Wisdom and
Power, which has its being in, and of its self, and was before al Creaturs,
visibel and in visibel were, and is the life, former, fulness, and end of them al,
and abides the sam when they have their end: But the old Serpent, the Devil,
the God of the World, was not before things visibel, and invisibel were, but was
mad manifest in tym throuh matter and form, and is not, but by, and throuh
matter, and form, and cease to be when they have their end in every
particular, towit the Spirit of that old Serpent, the carnal covetos mind with
the law thereof, which has its Seat in the members, the Erthly, or sensual part
of Man-kynd, which is the Woman that was deceived and first in the
transgression, both, of mal and femal which is Death, Hell, and a Devil in all in
whom it dwells, and reins, even the Kingdom and Power offin, and darkness, the
seat, and Thron of al Iniquity, and al who in that Spirit, and Power Exercys
Rul, and Dominion ever others, ar a hell of Devils, and tormentors to them,
which is the Spirit of the Beast in Man-kynd that goes downward, and renders
al, in whom it Dwells, and ruls to be the Seed, and Children of the Devil that
old Serpent, which is mor subtle then any beast of the field which the Lord God
has mad, whose curs, and portion was, is, and for ever shall be, on their Bellys
to go, and to eat dust all the Days of their life, but the life which is pur of
God in Man-kynd, is not up held by bred alon, but by the pur Word of the Lord
of life and Power in the inward parts, does man live, whom God is now restoring,
and redeeming again up into himself, to Partak o^ his own pur Divyn Nature, and
fulness and to bear his Imag, to the enjoyment of the gift which he freely gav
to the Children of Men, whom the Lord will again Crown with his own pur life, and
Plas in Eternal Dominion over the works of his hands. The Son is in mesur
risen, and the day com, in which all the devouring Beasts of Prey shall ly down
in their dens and sleep a perpetual sleep, and man goforth unto his labor until
the evening, from under the curs, and Power of transgression, sin, Death and
hell, in the blesing of Eternal life, pur lov, Peace, and Ryteosnes for ever mor.

And so having slain the Innocent, murdered and crucified the just, to, and in
themselves, the true Lord, and heyr of al, cast him out of his inheritans, and
possesed themselves thereof, they contryved how to make sur the possession thereof
to themselves, their heyrs, and Successors in that Serpentyn, Murderos, and
oppresing Spirit, and Power, if possibel to al ages and generations. And the
woman the Ecclesiastical Power, being deceived, and first in the transgression,
act their parts, carrying al under a falls, and feined pretens of Ryteosnes,
Holiness, and good orders, laying the foundation as sur and as deep as possibly
myt be, according to that Serpentyn Wisdom by with they were acted, Erecting
Schools, Colleges, and Vniversitys, under a pretens of up-holding of learning,
and to fit Instruments for the Servis of God in their Generation, but to the
end that such as ar taught, and tutored in them, myt be sur to partak and be
filed, with the sam Dyabolical Spirit, and Power, by which she is acted, she
orders that non shall be permited to teach, Tutor, or instruct in them, But such
as must pas her approbation or such as she appoints, causing them to com into
her cursed leagu', and Covenant, of obediens, and subjection, to her and her
Husband, by the Oaths, of Allegians and Supremacy, which being don accordingly
they proceed in their work, teaching Children in their beginning to Read, and
learn in Books of feined lying storys, with many filthy, and unsavory
expressions in them, which tend to the corrupting and infecting them in their
chyldhood, and rays that Spirit in them which is enmity against God, and this
under a pretens that learning may not be a burden to them, and that Children
may tak delyt in their Books, and having mad some progres in this Kind of
learning they proceed further to teach them to act their parts on stages in
Comedys, and Tragedys, thereby to gain skill, and boldness in the Rhetoric, and
Oratory of hell, that so they may be the mor capabel to ascend further in
acquyring of degrees in those tongu's, parts, and arts, standing in that Wisdom
which is enmity against God, putting on them the Nams of Masters, and Bachelors
of Arts, Bachelors, and Doctors in Divinity, Lecturers and Fellows of
Colleges, etc.

The effects, and fruits of which cursed tutorag', have bin evidently mad
manifest among the inhabitants of those parts, and plases where such Schools,
Colleges, and Universitys ar, in the Exercys of Drunkenes, pride, swearing,
deceit, reveling, gaming, whoring, theft, and murder, and such Kind of tutored
ons, throuh ages, and generations past, have bin counted, and mad us, of as the
only fit, and learned instruments to supply Vacancys and carry on a succession
in commanding, governing, and teaching the Peepel of the several Nations, and
languages throuhout Christendom.

But if they have bin the children of those called nobel men or Lords, or such as
have great estats, and revenus to maintain them, without seeking any military or
ecclesiastical preferment or to be Doctors of Phisic (so caled) then must they
be counted in the plases where they dwell, learned men, well bred Gentel men, fit
to make Justises of the peace, or Sherryfs of the county, or to be Esquyrs,
Knyts, Baronets, Lords, Earls, Duks, or Peers of the Land; whose lyvs, and
conversations, ar generally spent in devouring daily delitios food, wyn, and
strong drink, wearing every vain, and foolish invented garb and fashion of
costly Attyr, deked with need-les, and vain ornaments, in lusts, eas and Carnal
plesurs, gaming, bowling, hors-rasing, hawking, huuting breaking down fenses,
spoiling the gras, and corn of the laborios husbandman, as masters of wiked
misrul, and disorder, that must not be reproved or controuled and it may be
assuming to them selves a privilege, to the exercys of their wyld and wiked
Practices, by virtue of some Royalty, or being Lord of the Manor (so called.) Of
such Kind of vermin as these, has the succession, of Emperors, Kings, Prinses,
Rulers, Teachers Comanders, Judges, Sherrifs, Counselers, Physicians, Rectors,
Fellows, and Teachers, in Schools, Colleges, Vniversitys, Court and Kingdoms,
with all plases af trust or profit in them, bincarryedon, for ages and
generations past unto this day.

Next she taks away the us of the scripturs of truth, the record of the holy
men of God, to wit the Profets, Christ, and the Apostels, from the peepel, and
this under a pretens, least they being holy, and mysterios should be corrupted,
wrested, and perverted, but a Religion she will uphold, which must bear the Nam
of Christaninty, and holy church, a form of Doctrine, Fellowship, breaking of
bred, prayer, Preaching, Singing, Baptism, Fasting, etc. she invents, and calls
it holy, and Apostolical, tho quyt void of that Pur Power, and spirit, of
holiness which was in Christ and in the holy Apostels, The ded bodies of the
witneses must not be buried, but kept up to make merry with all, ^ver the slain,
pur witneses of God which ons appeared in and throuh them.

But to the end that they may appear with the show of alovly acceptabel and
attractyv countenans, to the peepel; she adorns, Paints, perfums, Spyces, and
Imbalms them, after the best skill and wisdom which she has in the art of her
Dyabolical Apothecaryship, adorning herself in Purpel, Scarlee, and fyn linen
deked with gold, and other ornaments, adorning her house with several sorts of
picturs, images, and ydols to represent God Christ, the Spirit, Angels and
Saints, under a pretens of their being insted of books to the ignorant, and
Illiterat peepel, covering her tabel with costly carpets, and fynlinen, seting
there on a goldencup, and platter, vvher in she ministers forth her wars of
whordom, witcheraft, and abomination to the peepel, with sweet perfums several
sorts of music, singing men, and Boys; whereby provision was mad to pleas, and
gratify the sensual part of Man kind on every hand, and thus having deked
herself in her harlots attyr, furnished her house, spread her tabel, and mad al
things Ready, she has her Baptized bells to giv loud notis, when the Doors of
her house or shop ar open, and her wars to be put to sal, with a Clerk to lay
the Cushion, and turn the glass (by which they mesur out their wars to the
Peepel,) and to say Amen to what soever the orakel of the devil in them
utters forth, in which Ydol Tempels, or shops, which they Ignorantly call
churches, there ar several sials, at which they Administer, and lay Open their
several sorts of Abominabel wars of sorcery, wherdom, and with craft, to wit
those called, Fonts, Altars or communion tabels, desks, and Pulpits,
confessionstools and in Scotland stools of Repentans so caled.

Their Font is a plas where they Administer an invention of their own Brains,
called the Sacrament of Baptism, about which they us a heap of ceremonys with
Blasphemos lys, and charms of witchcraft and sorcery, using water, which after
they have sprinkeled the Person with whether young or old, they affirm them to
be Regenerat, Born again, mad members of Christ, Children of God and inheritors
of the Kingdom of heven, having Persons to stand by, which they call, God
Fathers, and God Mothers, to under tak, or promis that the Person sprinkeled,
shall for sak the Devil, and al his works, the Pomp, and vanitys of the World,
and all the sinful lusts of the flesh: Making the syn of a cross (the whors mark)
on their forheds saying, Intoken that afterward they shall not be ashamed to
confess the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fyt under his Banner,
against sin, the World, and the Devil, and to continu Christ's faithful
soldiers, and servants unto their lyvs ends, etc. which as any have com truly to
do and be, they have bin mad a prey on by them, and their Nams cast forth as
evil, counted Heritics and not fit to live, whose practis toward such, for ages,
and generations past, to this day has bin, spoiling their goods imprisonment
banishment, whiping, torturing, racking, hanging, and burning their persons.

Others there ar who tho they us not, such a heap of lys, and ceremoys about it
yet ar they acted by the sam spirit, and Power in the ground, in the
administration thereof, some sprinkling infants, others diping persons of ryper
years, affirming it to be the baptilm of Christ uring a necessity there of, as
unto salvation, where in they agree with the whor of Rom: where as John who was
the minister of water baptism said thus I baptys you with water, but there
comes on after me, mytyer then I, (to wit Christ) he shall baptys you with the
holy ghost or spirit: and Christ himself in his charg to his discypels said, go
ye, and teach al nations baptysing them (he said not in water but) in to the
nam of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy spirit, which baptism of
Christ by the holy spirit, was administered throuh preaching in the
demonstration of the spirit, and Power of God, whereby Peepel were brouht in to a
participation of the lyt, lov, wisdom, Power and spirit of holiness, which is
the Nam of the father, who is the God of lyt, and lov, and the nam of the Son
who is the wisdom, and Power of God, and the Nam of the holy ghost, who is
caled the spirit of holiness, this is the on baptism which saves, which the
Apostel said is not the washing away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer
of a good conscience toward God, by the refurrection of Christ from the ded (in
them) the baptism which is by the on spirit into the on body of Christ, which
body of Christ, is the whole creation, visibel, and invisibel of which every
living cretur of God is a member the tempel, the house of Prayer unto al
nations: the visibel, and sensityv part whereof, is the womam that was deceived,
and first in the transgression, the evil effects of which transgresing Power,
has (throuh those angels that kept not their own habitations,) spread it self
over the whole body, whereby a dark vail of covering has bin drawn over the Pur
lyt, and glory of God in every cretur visibel, and invisibel, otherwys there had
not bin need of making a covenant, for the redemtion, Salvation, Deliverans,
and restoration of the whole body, had not the effects of the curs and bondag of
corruption bin over al, and that it has bin so, has evidently appeared in the
several ecclipses and darkning of the Sun, the turning of the moon in to blood,
the faling of the stars of the hevens, the Extremes of heat and cold, natural,
and spiritual, tempestuos, and blasting Wynds, outward and Inward, Infectios
clouds, vapors, and mildews, on the outward, and Inward man, overwhelming, and
destroying showers of snow, rayn and hayl, the enmity that is (not only) in
Man-kynd but in every cretur on against another, not only of on sort against
those of another sort, but against each other of the sam kind, and sort, which are
all the effects of the curs that entered by transgression, and it cannot be other
wys: For if God cast out God, then were his Kingdom divyded against it self, and
so should have an end, but the eternal Power the former of al things, being the
spirit of Pur life, lov, peace wisdom, ryteosnes and holiness, those effects
formentioned could not proceed from him; for every effect proceeds from its
natural, and proper cause, and had the creation stood under the government of
that Pur Power and spirit by which it was created, and brouht forth, the
transgresing Power, and curs could not have entered, and al those evil effects
there of had never bin brouht forth, for death, folly, unryteosnes desylment,
destruction, and enmity, could never Possibly have bin the effects or produs, of
that spirit of Pur life, wisdom, Ryteosnes, Salvation, Preservation, and lov.

From this cursed Root (the transgressing Power that old serpentyn spirit which
took plas in Eva and Adam, and throuh them has spread it self over the whole
body) has sprung, all the wars murders, Persecutions, Enmity, Deceit, Plagu's,
Pestilenses sikneses Famins, Destructions, wo's, Calamitys, and Miserys, which
have bin, and still ar, not only upon, and in Man-kynd, but in and upon the whole
body of the creation, and as the everlasting covenant of God to his own Pur
Seed (which is Christ) not only in Man-kynd, but in the whole body of the
creation, and every cretur therein contained) coms to be mad good, the corrupt
bondag of the transgresing Power chal be broken, and all the miserabel, and
cursed effects, thereof shall ceas. According to the promis of God by, and throuh
his holy Profets which body of Christ is his spous, his church, to and for
which he gives himself, that he may redeem, wash and clens it, that it may
become holy blamles, and without spot, in the midst of which, even in, and
throuh every creturth declares the Fathers Nam unto his brethren, and sings
Praises unto him. This is the sweet singer of Israel, Christ is al in all,
betxixt God and man whether in dis^ensing mercy or execuring Judgment visibel
or in visibel, in and upon Mankind. as first to and upon Adam and Eva.
who throuh al ages, and generations, has in Ryteosnes, and faithfulness, sung
the sweet song of mercy, and judgment, as a Son over his own house, to wit,
Christ the eternal word of life, the wisdom, and Power of God, which was in
the beginning with God before his works of old, by whom al things were mad, and
ar upheld.

It was he that mad Man-kynd in his own pur Imag and plased him in Dominion
over the works of his hands, who in lov and Kyndnes gav them freedom to eat of
every tree of the garden, prohibiting them only from eating of the tree of
knowledge of good, and evil, warning them in mercy of the evileffects of
transgresing against his Just command therein, yea even when the lust was
conceiving, and the Tempter working in Eva, and it was Christ, the saam eternal
Wisdom, and Power of God, (which in Just, and Ryteos Judgment, after sin, and
transgression had taken plas, and got entrans in them) that pronounsed, and
executed on, and in them the Just, and Ryteos Judgments of God because of their
sin and transgression.

It was he (to wit Christ) that in mercy to, and in the old World, exercysed
patiens, To and upon the old wrold.
and long forbearans by his spirit in stryving with them, til al flesh had
corrupted their ways before him, so that it repented him that he had mad man.
And it was he, that in just, and ryteos Judgment, brouht in the flood upon the
World of the ungodly.

It was he, that in lov, and mercy to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and those other
citys, gav them rain, and fruitful seasons whereby they had fulness of bred and
plenty, thereby leaving them inexcusabel, To and upon Sodom and Gomorra.
exercysing long forbearans, patiens and mercy toward them, til his soul (in
just Lot) was vexed, and grieved with their wiked deeds, who having filed up
the mesur of their abominations;

It was he, that in, and by fyr executed the just, and ryteos Judgment of God
on them, turning them into as hes, leaving them an exampel to succeeding ages.

It was he that, To and upon Pharo and Egypt.
in lov, and mercy to Tharo and the Egyptians, and to sav much Peepel alyv, in
and throuh Joseph dyrected Pharo to lay up several slors of corn in the seven
Years of plenty against the seven Years of famine; And it was he that in, and
throuh Moses, and Aaron, executed just and ryteos Judgments on Pharo, and the
Egyptians, because of their unryteos cruelty and bondag exercysed over Israel,
refusing to let them go, and that in, and by the Sea, overwhelmed, Tharo, and
his host in their Murderos, and wiked pursuit after Israel.

It was he that (in lov, To and upon Israel in the wilderness.
and mercy to Israel) in and throuh Moses, Aaron, the cloud, Pillar of fyr,
Brazen Serpent, Manna, and Water out of the Rok (Christ,) brouht them out of
Egyptian bondag, and led them saf throuh the Sea, and mad known to them his
law, Statuts and Judgments, guyding, feeding, healing, and preserving them, and
it was he that in just and ryteos Judgment because of their unbelief,
rebellions, and hardness of heart, caused their Carkases to fall in the
wilderness.

It was he, To and upon the Canaanyes.
That in mercy, to and in the inhabitants of Canaan, which were before Israel,
exercysed patiens, and long forbearans, giving them the long enjoyment of that
good Land, and his blesing in it; and it was he that in, and throuh Israel
executed his just, and ryteos Judgment on them, they having filed up the misur
of their sins to theful.

It was he that in lov, To and upon Israel in the land of Canaan.
and mercy to the of springs of rebellios Israel (of whom themselves said they
should become a prey) who for his own Nam, and Covenant sak, mad with faithful
Abraham gav them the Possession of the Land of Canaan, performing his word of
promis to the full as is recorded in the Scripturs of truth, and it was he that
in just, and ryteos Judgment, suffered the hethen round about them to com upon
them and exercys Dominion over them in the Land, and somtyms to carry them
captyvs in to other Cuntrys they having by their often Provocations,
Rebellions, and Idolatry departed from the Lord, and broken the Covenant And
when any mesur of true repentans appeared in them.

It was he that in lov and mercy, raised up saviors for them, and in and throuh
them. Delivered them, returning their captivity dyvers tyms, who having filled up
the mesur of their provocations, oppressions, and Idolatry, moking, stoning,
imprisoning, cruelly using, and slaying his Holy Profets sent unto them, yea
even betraying, rejecting, and crucifying the Son of God himself, Christ Jesus

It was the sam Eternal Power of God which dwelt bodyly in him, who in just,
and ryteos Judgment in, and throuh the Romans destroyed, their glorios city,
and Tempel, and over turned their ons famos Government, and led them captyvs in
sham, scorn, and contemt amongst the Nations, who so remain unto this day.

It was he that in lov and mercy to the gentiles or Romans, ingrafted them into
the good oliv tree, causing them to partak of the blesed root, To the Romans.
and fatnes thereof, and who throuh al ages, and generations, sins the World
which lies in wikednes began, and in and throuh the Apostasy of the Gentiles or
Romans, has born the strok of the Murderers hand, and his soul bin mad an
offering for sin, giving his bak to the smyter, and his cheeks to them that have
pluked of the hair, who in, and throuh the Holy Men of God, Profets, Christ
Jesus, the Holy Apostels, Saints Martyrs, and faithful witneses of Jesus to
this day, has bin siling up the mesur of his sufferings, for his bodies sak
which is the Church, enduring and bearing the Reproaches, Blasphemys, and
contradictions of sinners, the mesur of whose sufferings is near hand filled up,
the witneses Prophesying in sakloth near hand ended, the Spirit of life from God
being entered into them, and they (in mesur) standing on their own feet, the end
of the World which lys in wikednes being in mesur com, which shall put an end to
the Power of sin, and finish transgression, and bring in everlasting ryteosnes,
and establish it in Man kind, and Mankind in it, who is now appearing, and by
the brytnes of his coming in ten thousands of his Saints, (in mesur) already
has and daily mor, and mor shall, reveal, consum, and utterly destroy the man
of sin.

The sam^ that has executed
And now the Gentiles or Romans having siled up the measar of their Apostasy and
bloody abominations, in degenerating, and faling away from that pur life of
says and holy conversation in Christ Jesus, which was ons appearing in their
predecessors, racking, stoning Imprisoning, banishing, torturing, Burning and
hanging those in whom the Innocent and holy life of Jesus has appeared, whom God
has raised up, and sent often amongst them, to warn them, and turn them from
the evil of their doings, whose warnings, and counsels being rejected and
despised, Now therefore, is Christ the sam Eternal wisdom, lyt and Power of God
in Just and ryteos Judgment raising up the Turkish Power, and in, and throuh
them will he Execut, on the Dragon's, beast's, and falls profet's power, in the
Romans or gentiles, the Judgments written. Who also, when he has don his work in
Syon will punish the stout heart of the King of Assyria, and the glory of his hy
looks, and the hauhtynes of man shall be abased and the loftynes of man laid
low, even with the ground, every mountain leveled, and the Lord alon Exalted,
and al his enemies become his footstool and swords beat into plovv shars, and
spears into pruning hooks, so that nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, nor learn war any mor, and the whole creation be delivered from the
bondag of corruption into the glorios liberty of the Sons of God, and the
Kingdom, and Dominion in, throuh, and over al surrendered up unto the Father,
and thus Christ the lyt, wisdom and Power of God, the Root, and of spring of
David, the sweet singer of Israel, having glorified the Father on Earth, and
finished the work given him to do, in the faithful administration, and
execution of mercy and judgment, shall be glorified with the Father, and the
whole creation, in and with him, with the sam glory which he had in and with the
Father before the foundation of the world which lies in wikednes began.

And as the natural Body of Christ is but on, so the life, spirit or soul (which
is the Spiritual Body) is but on also, throuhout the whole Body, The whole
creation is the body of Christ.
and every living member thereof, which is God manifest in the flesh; The sam
Eternal life, and pur Power which gives being, and form to on Cretur, gives
form, and being unto al, not only to, and in Man-kynd, but to, and in every
Cretur, so that the whole, is but on Body, filed and acted, by on soul guyded,
governed and quikened by on Eternal Spirit, which are on, and agree in on, in
him who is the incomprehensibel Lord God Omnipotent, the Eternal Fountain and
fulness of al, and here in is seen that imaginary faith of a God-hed
comprehended in three Persons, for according to their own apprehensions, a
person, being a body in conjunction with a soul, then it may be affirmed, that
there ar as many Persons comprehended in the God head, as there ar Kynds of living
Creturs, and distinct Creturs of every Kind, which on Body with the on soul,
acted and governed by the on Eternal quikening Spirit, is the on only Son of
God, which came out of the bosom of the Father in whom he was, is and ever shall
be well pleased and as the Father has life in himself, so has he given the Son
to have life in himself and to every living cretur or member in him to have life in
it self, both in the natural, and spiritual body and the life of al in the seed
preserved, and as Christ (who is the eternal quikening Power, to and in the
seed both of the natural, and spiritual body, appears, so do they al appear
with him in true Pur glory, and the communication of the virtue of the eternal
quikening Power, to and in the seed both of the Natural and Spiritual Body is
throuh the cross of Christ, which to and in the seed of the natural body is
communicated throuh natural, sensibel and visibel things, to wit, Winter and
Summer, heat and cold, seed tym and harvest, hunger and food, thirst and drink,
Nyt and Day, motion and rest; But to and in the seed of the Spiritul Body after
a Spiritual, and invisibel manner, either secretly in the Reyns, heart, and
inward parts, or throuh erthen vessels, which he has filed with that tresur,
and a dispensation thereof comittent to them, which is the Spirit of Prophesy a
ded because of transgression, which shall ceas, and fayl, as into the everlasting
Covenant, Man-kynd is brouht: which Communication of the virtue of the Eternal
Power, throuh the cross, to and in the seed of the Spiritual Body, answers
Spiritually to all the dimensions thereof, to, and in the seed of the natural
body, which are al of them as truly necessary to the being, and welbeing of the
seed, and life of God the on as the other, both in the natural and spiritual
body, and as desyr fayls in the on, the natural body returns to the Earth and
the spirit to God that gav it, and as desyr fayls in the other such become ded
whyl they live: which cross, is the everlasting covenant o God, to and with the
seed, his own life, both in the natural, and spiritual body, which in on, in and
throuh the whole creation, and every living cretur therein contained, only
differing in degrees, and manner of working and operation.

And for an assurans of his faithfulner in making good the covenant on his part
to the seed in the natural, and visibel body, he has given an outward or
visibel syn or token, plasing his Bow in the clouds of the visibel hevens; And
to the seed of the invisibel or spiritual body, he has given an invisibel or
spiritual witness, or token, to wit, the lyt which shyneth in the dark plas, in
the inward parts, the faithful, and true witness of God, the word which lives
and Abides for ever, near in the mouth, and in the heart, concerning which the
covenant, and Promis of God is, that it shall not depart out of the mouth of the
seed nor of its seeds seed for ever, even so long as the Sun, and moon
endures.

And here I Judge it expedient further to declar, that I do not herin either deny
or under vallu either the person, work or Sonship of Jesus Christ, that just,
and innocent on, who witnesed a good confession before Pontius Pylat. But what
the holy Profets, and Apostels declared, and recorded in the spirit of truth
concerning him, I do own, and acknowledge to be true and do heerby affirm, that
the sam eternal Pur holy, and Innocent life, and fulness of God, which dwelt
bodyly in him, was the lamb which was slain from the foundation of the world
which lies in wikednes, the holy seed of the woman to which the covenant of
God is mad in which all the Promises of God ar yea, and Amen, in which all the
familys of the Earth shall be blesed, the lamb of God that takes away the sins
of the world, the Shylo into whom the gathering of the Peepel shall be, the
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end of all the works of God, without
beginning of days or end of life, who was, is, and is to com, and abides the Sam
for ever, world without end, and that he came out of the bosom of the Father in
whose mouth was found no guyl, in whom the temter nether had nor found any Plas,
and was the first begoten from the ded, the first born amongst many brethren,
the Author, and Captain of eternal salvation, who pased the tym of his so
journing on Earth in that mortal body, in the Pur fear and lov of God,
faithfully finisingh the work given him by the Father to do, and in the sam
eternal Pur spirit offered up himself unto God without spot, and returned into
the bosom of the Father, innocent holy, harmles, and undefyled, as he
proceeded, and came forth from the Father.

And as concerning that body of flesh in which he appeared, this I say, as
himself also testified, that the flesh profits nothing, but it is that
eternal word of spirit, and life, which was mad manifest in and throuh that body
of flesh, was, and is the wisdom, and Power of God to salvation, in all them
that believed and that he had power to lay it down, and tak it again, and did
lay it down upon the cross, and took it again out of the sepulker, and in it was
received by a cloud out of the sit of his discypels, and according to the
scripturs this I say, that the things which are seen with the outward or visibel
ey ar but temporal, and fading, but the things which are not seen they are
eternal.

Non have advantag by the death of Christ, but such as partak of his Life.
And as concerning what was don, said and suffered, by the life, wisdom, and
Power of God, in, by and throuh that Erthen vessel, non have any profit or
benifit thereby, but only such who com into a participation of the sam eternal
life, and purfulnes of God in them selves, which was in him.

The next stal is their Altars, or communion tabels vvher they administer an
invenrion of their own brains, which they call the Sacrament of the Altar, or
communion, or the Lords supper, in which they make us of bred, and wyn, which
after the Priest has said his Charm of Sorcery, and witchcraft over, called
consecration, they affirm that the substans of the bred and wyn is departed,
and that their remains nouht, but Accidents, and that under those Accidents is
the Sam body, and blood of Christ which was shed and crucified on a cross
without the gats of Jerusalem, being ignorant, that the substans, not only of
bred and vvyn but of every cretur is no other then the only living and true Lord
God, so that by their own confession that which they receiv in their
Sacrament, is only Accidents without substans, and verily as to them so it is,
for they feed on ashes, a deceived heart has turned them asyd.

Others there ar, who tho they have not, such a heap of lys, and ceremonys about
the administration of it, yet ar they in it acted by the Sam spirit in the
ground and although they affirm not that it is the sam body, in which the Son of
God suffered death without the gats of Jerusalem, yet after they have said their
charm, called blesing the bred, they look on it as somewhat mor then it was, but
what, they cannot well say, caling it a supper, when many of them receiv it
before they have eaten their own dinners, affirming it to be the communion of the
body and blood of Christ, when as to them its only a Tabel of such as eat, and
drink unworthily, they not discerning the Lords body, and so become guilty of
the body, and blood of the Lord.

Whereas Christ Jesus, in the s^m nyt in which he was betrayed took bred and
blesed it, and brak it and gav it to his discypels, saying tak, and eat, this
is my body which is given for you, do this in remembrans of me, and lykwys the
Cup saying, this is the new Testament in my blood, which is shed for many, and
this was before he had suffered death in that body throuh which he spak unto them
(mark that) and the Apostel said that the bred which they brak was the
communion of the body of Christ, and the cup of blesing which they blesed was
the communion of the blood of Christ, and that so often as they did eat of that
bread (he said not ons a week, month, or year, but so often as they did eat,
and drink thereof) they did show forth the Lords death til he came, to wit, his
death in the creturs received; and in the true hunger and thirst, of the true
discerning, and worthy receiver, til he appear in the virtue of his own life,
blesing, and lov, in and throuh the creturs received, to norish, and refresh
the sam in every true discerning, and worthy receiver, for it is no other then
the life of God which tastes death in on Cretur, to refresh, norish, and uphold
the sa;m in another, and herin he tastes death for every man, and is the savior
of man and beast, which is the word of his eternal wisdom, and Power by which
he upholdeth al things. That which norisheth, and refreshes, and that which is
Norished, and refreshed is on, in every true discerning, and worthy receiver, as
he that sanctifyeth, and they who ar sanctified ar of on.

The other stals ar their Desks, and pulpits, where in sted of speaking as the
orakel of God, and preaching the everlasting gospel, according as they have
seen, felt, tasted, and experiensed in them selves, and praying as the Pur
spirit of the Lord gives utterans, they utter forth the imaginations of their
own brains, filing the ears of the Peepel with ^abels, and storys of lying
syns, and wonders, gathered out of the wrytings and books of such whom they
call, ancient Fathers, Poets, hathen Philosophers and Commentators, with their
own imaginations from the scripturs, perverting them to their own, and others
destruction, intruding into things which they have not seen, using some words of
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin somtyms in their preaching, in imitation of those
tongu's which were ons appearing as a gift, in and amongst the Apostels; for a
syn unto them which believed not, that so as the speaking in dyvers tongu's,
and languages, becam ons a divyding, and confounding curs amongst the builders
of Babel in the fall, so to, and in the Apostels, it becam a gift of God, or syn
to such as believed not, that they myt be brouht again out of the curs, out of
the many tongu's and languages, to learn, and speak the on pur languag'.

And in sted of praying by the motion, and help of the pur Power, and Spirit of
the Lord in them, which is the only Advocat with the Father, who eyer livs to
make intercession, in and for the Saints, according to the will of God they read;
and utter forth many vain repetitions, which they call Masses, Ave Marys, Pater
nosters, Creeds, Common Prayers, out of their divyn Servis books and
Directorys, etc. With the blind and dark conceptions of their own hearts and
brayns, caled Extemporary Prayers, thinking as their predecessors, and for
fathers, the Scrybs, Pharisees and Hypocryts of old, to be heard for their much
babbeling, and in sted of singing in the Spirit, and making sweet melody to the
Lord in their hearts, they have several sorts of Music, with singing men and
boys, to make a noys after the manner of the hethen of old, when they sacrifysed
their children throuh the fyr unto devils. Others there ar who sing, and cause
others to sing the saints words and conditions in rym or meeter, many of them
being ignorant that therein they do evil, offering the sacrifys of fools: For,
for any on, or mor together to sing as praises unto God, in the words of the
saints or Profets left upon record, and say that God is their Ryteosnes, and
that he has pluked their ^eet out of the myer, and set them on the Rok and
established their goings; or that there is no rest in their bons by reason of
their sins, and that they water their couch with their tears, and their skin is
as a bottel in the smoke, or that the law of Gods mouth is dearer to them then
thousands of Gold, and Silver, and Sweeter then the honey or the honey comb, as a
Lanthorn to their feet and lyt unto their Paths, and their ey not lofty, nor
their heart hauhty, but that their souls ar as weaned children etc. When they are such as live in vanity, and Pride, and make a scorn, and a derision of such as
walk in the lyt, and make the eternal word or spirit of the Lord in them their
guyd leader, and teacher, and make it their delyt to spend their tym in covetos
vvays, and practices to heap up to them selves the Riches, and tresur of the
world by dishonest gain, having there feet stiking fast in the myr of filth and
unryteosnes, the singing and praising of such is not only a sacrifys of fools
but a sacrifys of abominabel lys, and blasphemys.

And thus all the inward invisibelthings of God, being changed into outward
visibel syns and shaddows of the^ (viz for the true clothing of the ryteosnes of
Christ, the true Imag of God and aros of Christ, Holy Day of the Spirit, Holy
Water of byf, and inwardlyt, etc. they have set up their paint ed Priestly robs,
outward Images, Crosses, Holy days, Holy water, outwardlyts of Candels
And being strangers and enemies to thelyt, and spirit of truth, in man which
sercheth the deep things of God which is the eternal day, the holy day of God,
which al who truly keep, ar children of the day, they have in their own wills
mad, and set a part many days which they call holy Days, giving them the nams of
Christ-mas, Candel mas, Lammas, Michael-mas days, and of saints, as James,
Peter's, Thomas, and John's day with many other Nams, on which days after, they
have bin at their charms of babbeling sorcery, and Idolatros witch craft, caled,
Mas, divyn servis, commy prayers, sermons etc. many tyms the priest takes
their consecrated breden-Y dol God, which they call the hallowed host, the bedy
of their Lord God, having a canopy born over him, and others bearing dyvers
standadrs or banners, with Y dol picturs in them but the standard and Banner of
Christ, which is Peace, Lov, Ryteosnes and Meeknes they are strangers, and Enemies
unto, going up and down the streets, and fields, causing hy and low, rich and
poor, small and great, mal and femal to follow them in their Idolatros, and
pernitios ways and to bow, and kneel down to their invented Y dol, and be
subject to their Idolatros practices, after which both priest, and peepel spend
the residu of those days, some in Y delnes and vanity, others in the exercys of
Riot, chambering, wantonness, masking, Dansing, bowling, delitios far and
feasting, excesyv drinking VVyn and strong drink to drunkenness with several
other ways of vanity and wickedness. And being strangers, and enemies to the
spirit of the Lord, that pur living fountain of living holy water in the in
ward parts, which washes and cleanses the in ward man, in which the saints
draw ny to God, and God draws ny to them by which they resist the devil, and
make him flee, they tak outward water which after the priest has said his charm
over, called consecration, they call holy water they sprinkel both them selves, and
the Peepel, causing also the Peepel to sprinkel them selves, crosing themselves
with their hands, affirming that it will keep away evil spirits, and dryv away
the devil etc. Whylst the bodies of both priests, and peepel ar become the
habitations of devils, the cages, and holds of every fowl spirit, the seed, and
children of hell, and the devil, for they being found in the ways of deceit,
enmity, unryteosnes, covetosnes, oppresion, hypocrisy, Idolatry, persecution
and murdering of the saints, and these being works of the devil, torches, etc.)
the Peepel ar deceived of the trusubstans, and fed only with inventions in
which there is no virtue.
they are thereby rendered the seed and children of that Father whose works they
do, as Christ said to the Jews of Old who said they were the children of Abraham.

And lastly they cause a Law to be mad prohibiting any from assembeling
themselves together to the Exercys of any worship, but only in their Mas-houses
or Y dol-tempels, under the penalty of being Reputed, and dealt with, as
Conventikelers holding unlawful assemblys, Heritics, Non conformists, and
disorderly Persons, which has bin Executed on thousands of Innocent persons,
in ways of cruelty, blood and murder, in ages and generations past unto this
day.

Thus having eaten of the forbiden tree, which appeared beautiful to the ey,
she (the Ecclesiastical Power) gav also to her husband (to wit the Civil Power
(so caled) even the whole body of them, even all the Potentats, Kings, Prinses,
and Rulers, throuhout Christendom, who haveat also with her: And that al myt be
mad sur, on their Parts also, they invented an oath caled the oath of
Allegians, to be taken by such as ar within the Consyns of each of their
severaldominions, causing their Laws, with Bills, Bonds, and wrytings obligatory
to be put in Latin, under a precens to uphold, and incorag learning, whereby
provision was mad to uphold, that Proud, Covetos, Vnresonabel, Extorting, and
Deceitful generation of men called Doctors in the law, Counselers, Advocats,
Solicitors, Atturnys, Clarks, and Scrybs; and to the end that al myt be mad
saf, and secur on every hand, they have the red Dragon, or Military Power, which
they Plas, and quarter up and down, in, and throuh the nations, in those fexes
hols, to wit, the fensed citys, strong holds and garrisons, standing there, as
the angels of each devil, ready to obey and fulfill their cursed wills, and
plesurs; So that they becam as a three fold cord or bond of wicked^es not
easily to be broken, whereby the nations becam subjected under the cruel bondag
of corruption; not wilingly but by fors, and cruelty, and becam as an As or the
foal of an As on which never man sat, but cruel devouring beasts of prey, whose
journey has not bin to Jerusalem but to there building of Jericho, which is
cursed with the founder, and the finisher, who laid the foundation thereof in
his first born, by whom sin and transgresion had its entrans into the world,
which is now finishing in his youngest son, the foundation of whose walls, is
blood, and murder, and the gats thereof deceit and lys, into which nothing can
enter but that which defyleth, and works abomination, in the darkness whereof
the nations of them that sit under the region of the shadow of death, do dwell
and walk.

And thus the old serpent the God of the world, having finished his work sat
himself down in them to tak his Rest, as a strong man armed, concluding to keep
his house, wife, children, and goods in safty, and peace, in their dyabolical
order, and fraternity, if poslibel to al ages, and generations, making them
selves Merry together over the slain Innocent witness of God the true heyr of al,
which they have crucified to and in themselves afresh, and have mad themselves
drunk with the blood of the Innocent, lying down together, in their beds of
Eas, to tak their fill of Dyabolical lov together in the Exercys of al manner of
A bominations, and filthynes both of flesh and spirit, until the morning, the
good man of the house being gone from hom, and not to return til the tym
appointed, issuing forth the filthy seed of their corrupt bodies of adultery and
whordom, in a continued succession, throuh and over the nations, to command,
govern, feed, and teach the flok of slauhter, every on with the number of
their blasphemos Nam, according to their plas, and degree in the Government and
Heraldry of hell, of which their for-heds are full to wit, Master, worshipful,
Rytreverend, gratios, most honorabel, Excelent, nobel, welborn, renowned,

Emperors, Kings, Prinses, Duks, Earls, Lords, Barons Knyts, Esquyrs, Gentelmen,
Captain-Lieutenant and Major-Generals, with al other the nams and tytels in
the Civil and military government (so caled) the seed of the adulterer.

Others called Curats, Chaplens, Priests, Rectors, Deans, Arch-Decons, Bishops,
Ryt reverend gratios Lords, Archbishops, Monks, Friars, Nuns, Jesuits,
Cardinals, Prins-Cardinals, with the ^ops holiness, and al other the blasphemos
nams and tytels, in the Eeclesiastical body (so caled) the seed of the vvhor,
al of them under the cursed leagu', bond, covenant, and Agreement of bell and
death, to each of their heds, by the oaths of allegians, and supremacy, scattered
up and down the nations as the Egyptian task masters, and midvvyvs to see that
non but femal children be kept alyv and that the appearans of the mal, the Ryt
heyr, be murdered, and destroyed in the Birth.

Others therar caled reformed churches, whose first rys and appearans was throuh
the motion of the Pur Power of God as on the waters, the fas whereof darkness had
covered, which was the cry of the souls under the Altar, the cry at midnyt
giving warning of the Brydgroms coming, throuh whom Christ the Angel of the
covenant opened, sounded, and Powered forth the fifth, and sixth seal, trumpet,
and vyal, (the effects whereof are not yet fully accomplished) whereby the waters
of the great river ar dried up and the way of the Kings of the East prepared,
among whom were many that were as the Egyptian midwyvs that feared God, and he
mad them houses, and they did eat, and drink in his presens, and he tauht in
their streets, and they did prophesy in his nam, and cast out devils: which
manifestation of the Power of God in and throuh them, was the day known to the
Lord, nether clear nor dark, in the evening whereof, the lyt has appeared, who
did not only spar, but norished, and incoraged the appearans of truth, and
ryteosnes in such in whom it appeared, whereby way was mad for the making ready a
peepel prepared for the Lord, and for the birth, and raising up of the
Man-chyld that is to Rul the nations with a Rod of Iron, but now being gone from
that of God in them, which ons moved in their predecessors, ar become on spirit
in the ground, with great Babylon the mother of harlots, and abominations, and
being found partakers with her in her sins must receiv of her Plagu's.

In them (to wit) the Beast's and falls proset's spirit, and power, ar the
Angels which kept not their own habitations and the spirits in prison ons
rebelios in the days of Noah, which by the wisdom, and Power of God have bin
reserved and kept, as in chayns of darkness, unto the Judgment of this great
day, throuh Ages, and generations, in the natural body, as in the Ark, of
which that mad by Noah at the (omand, and dyrection of God, was a figur in
which ark, was not only the seed of God which is pur, in Mankind, and in
every creatur, but the seed of the serpent also, (as the beloved, and the
hated, had conception, and birth in, and throuh on womb,) the on perserved to
the day of salvation, Redemtion, and deliverans, of the whole creation from the
bondag of corruption into the glorios liberty of the Son o God, and the other
reserved to the great day, of Judgment, destruction, and perdition of al
ungodly men which day is now com, and the evening and cool of their day
approached, and the eyes of them al must now be opened and they shall see that
they are naked; the voys of the Lord God they must now hear, and his Ryteos
decree, and sentens concerning them, they must unavoydably bear, and al^ho they
go from rok to Mountain, and from Mountain to hill, yea even amongst the trees
of the garden to hyd them selves, yet shall they not be abel to escap, for a
stronger then the strong man is com (who in mesur already has) and daily
morandmor shall lay hold on him and shall bynd him, and cast him out, and spoil
al his goods, his children shall be fatherles, and his wife a widow, even
vagabonds continually, which shall seek their bred out of desolat plases, yea
his habitation shall be desolat for ever, and another tak his plas, the cursed
city must now fall flat before the true Israel of God at the sounding of the
Rams-horns not a ston shall be left upon a ston in that cursed building,
unthrown down, the three fold cord, that cursed bond of corruption, so
subtly, tvvyned must now be unwound, and untwisted and utterly broken to
pieces, never mor to be set together again, and the covenant, and agreement
with hell, utterly disannuled, the Lord has need of the As, and has sent of
his discypels for him, and the As is in mesur loosed, and he in mesur sits
thereon, and is in mesur entered into the Tempel, with his whip of small cords,
and in mesur has, and daily mor and mor shall, dryv out all the buyers and
selers, and over turn the Tabels of the money changers, to wit, those who at the

And now of what has bin here declared, concerning thee O Leopold, and thoe O
Pop of Rom, with all Kings, Prinses, Rulers, and Governors, and al in Authority
under you, of what Degree, Rank, Or order soever, whether, Military, Civil,
Spiritual, Or Ecclesiastical (so caled) and al Peepel, Hy and Low, Rich and
Poor, Small, and great, Bond and free, Mal, and Femal, of what Nams, Orders,
Forms, and profesion in Religion soever known, even whole Christendom, with all
the Dominions and territorys thereunto belonging, of what Nation, tongu' or
languag soever, and every particular person in them contained, who ar under the
command, Government, and teaching of Man, This is the sum.

That a cursed spirit of Apostasy, and faling away, from the true Christian
faith, life and Practis, even the mystery of inquity, which was for seen, and
for told by the holy Profets, and servants of God, recorded in tho scripturs of
truth, took plas in thee O Christendom, even in thy Elders, and teachers, which
throuh them has grown, and spread it self, as evil leven throuhout the whole
lomp, that cursed seed of the Serpent has grown up in thee, not only in thy
Elders and teachers, but also throuh them, in thy Rulers, war ^^rs, and Peepel,
and is become a Man of sin, and mystery of iniquity even the Son of perdition,
yea a strong man armed with the dragons Power keeping possession of the house,
to wit of thee O Christendom, siting as God in thee, who ouhtst of ryt to be a
living Tempel, for the true, and living Lod God omnipotent to dwol, and walk in.

Which has rendered thy Military Power even the whole body of them to be the
great Reed Dragon that gav to the beast his power, seat, and great Authority,
with seven heds, ten horns, and seven crowns, upon his head, which has, and
still does stand before the woman, which did, and now does bring forth the
man-chyld, who in mesur does and daily mor shall Rul the nations with a Rod of
Iron, who failing in his first enterprys against the bab of glory, and being
cast out of heven into the earth, has, and still does persecut the woman, which
did, and now does bring forth the Man-chyld, and has and does cast out water
as a flood out of his mouth to carry her away therewith, making war with the
Remnant of her seed which keeps the commandments of God, and have the testimony
of Jesus, even the arm of the ungodly which must now be broken, a standing
engyn to oppres, spoil and consum the tresur, and blood of the nations.

Whose Rys and continuans to this day, is in the spirit of the old serpent which
was in Cain and in Simeon and Levy those brethren in Iniquity, in whose
habitations ar the cursed Instruments of Murder, Blood and cruelty, whose
practis was, and still is, whylst pretending overturs and treatys of peace, and
agreement, to seek and tak advantages, to Kill, Murder, and Destroy But the day
is now com, in which they must receiv their Just Reward from the Lord God and
they shall be divyded in Jacob, and scattered in Israel, and a Fugityv, and
vagabond on the earth, from the Lord God for ever must that Power and spirit be,
in which they stand, and by which they are acted.

Thy Civil Power (so caled) even the whole body of them, Emperors, Kings,
Prinses, and Rulers, and their predecesors in the fall, have bin, and still remain
that scarlet colored beast full of the nams of Blasphemy having seven heds, and
ten horns, which ascended out of the bottomless pit, upon whom the scarlet whor
that adulteros Woman, ^esabel, to wit, the whole body of thy spiritual men or
Clergy, (so caled) has, and still does sit, which has mad war with the two
vvitneses of God, and overcom them, vvhos Power, seat and great authority was
given and is still upheld by the dragon, or military Power, whose mouth has
uttered great things, and blasphemys, which was to continu trampeling the
holy city, forty and two months, opening his mouth in blasphemys even against
God, blaspheming his Nam, tabernakel, and them that dwell in heven, who has mad
war with the saints and over com them, and has had, and still has Power over
Kingdoms, tongu's, and nations, and was, and still is vvors hiped, by all vvhos
Nams are not written in the Lambs book of life.

Their several throns, and Seats of residens, exampels of villainy, and al
manner of wickedness to the several, Kingdoms, Dominions, and territorys over
which they rul, sending forth the stinking smells of vanity, Pride, Lust,
VVantones, VVhordom, Exces, Drunkenes, vayn Plesurs, Oppression, Cruelty,
Injustis, Deceit, Envy, Murder, and making aprey of the Innocent, such as de
part from Iniquity.

Whose rys and continnans to this day, is in the Spirit of the old Serpent,
which was in Cain that city builder, and in Ismael, Nimrod, and Esau, and in
those Kingly Governers of Sodom and Gomorrha, and the citys therabouts, vvhos
practis was and still is by stryf, contention, and wars to destroy, and murder
the Peepel, under their government thereby to wrest Dominion out of the hands
of each other, amongst whom just Lot is mad a prisoner, and captyv.

But the day is now com, in which Abraham the Brother of Lot is arming his
household; and Gideon the Lords Thresher, with his sharp threshing instrument
having teeth, has taken the field with his three hundred Men, and the Lord
vvil smyt them as in the day of Midian, and make their Prinses as Oreb and Zeeb,
as Zeba and Zalmunna, which perished at Endor, the habitation of the Spirit of
vvitch craft, and becam as dung upon the Earth.

The Captyr Exyl hastes to be delivered, and shall be lifted up out of the pit,
and redeemed and brouht bak, without money, and without prys, but the prey
shall not be taken from the myty, nether shall the lavvful capty^ be delivered
out of his hand, who had descended into the lovver most parts of the Earth,
even into the Belly of hell, but is now ascended, and ascending up far abov al
hevens, leading captivity captyv, giving gifts unto Men, spoiling Principalitys
and Powers, even the Potentats, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers of the Darkness of
this World, making an open show of them triumphing over them, and trampeling
on them in his cross, who is the lyt and life, of Men, and the Wisdom, and
Power of God.

Thy Ecclesiastical Power even the whole body of them, caled the Clergy or
Spiritual Men with their predecessors in the fall, and apostasy, were, and still
ar, that great skarlet whor which seteth upon many waters, even the mother of
harlots, and abominations of the earth with whom thy Potentats, Kings, Prinses,
Rulers, and Peepel, even the whole body of thee O Christendom, have committed
spiritual fornication, arrayed in purpel, skarlet and fyn linen, deked with
gold etc. having a golden cup in her hand full of abomnations, and filthynes of
her whordoms, on whose forhed is written, Mystery Babylon the great, the mother
of harlots, and abominations of the whole Earth, who has bin, and still remains
drunk with the blood of the Saints, and of the Martyrs of Jesus.

Thy several plases of worship, Tempels of Ydols, plases of the forms of
godlynes with out the life and power thereof, which are to be turned from, the
whole body of thy worship, as an Altar with an inscription to the unknown
God: The several exercyses of prayer, preaching, sacraments singing, with the
observation of days, tyms, and sabbaths, performed and observed, at loathsome,
stinking, and most abominnabel in the nostrils of the put God of life; no other
but as the offering of swyns flesh, blesing of Ydols, or murdering of men,
being performed in that spirit and Power which is enmity against God.

Whose Rys, and continans to this day is in the spirit of the old serpent,
which was in Cain who could offer a sacrifys, and then murder his brother
and in Balaam, Athaliah and Iezabel, who have riden the several nations of
Christendom as an As for dishonest gain, the wages of unryteosnes, and when
the As has bin mad some tyms to speak with Man's voys, and treprov their
madness, folly and vvikedness, he has bin revvarded by them, not only with
grievos stryps, but with spoiling of goods, syns, Imprisonments, banishment,
hanging and burning.

But the Day is now com, in which she must receiv her just, and ryteos reward
at the hand of the Lord God, and the Lamb, and in the Cup that she has filed,
must now be filed to her doubel and although she paint her sas, and look out at
the window and Cry treason, treason, at the appearans of the Ryt heyr, whylst
the Crown is seting on his head by the Royal Triesthood, in the Holy Tempel of
the Lord in the secret of which (towit, honest, Contryt, Humbel, and broken
hearts) he has bin hid from her Murderos conspyracy in destroying the seed
Royal, and during the tym of the cruel and usurped Reyn of her, and her
Husband, (which was the plas of the beloveds retyrment, until the breaking of
the day, and fleeing away of the shadows) yet now must she be thrown out at
the window by her own Servants, and be trodden under foot as unsavory salt, and
those dogs, towit, the horns shall hat her, eat her flesh, and burn her with fyr,
so that nouht shall be left of her; but the skul, feet, and palms of her hands,
the on to make known their desolat condition, the other to bear them as mourners
about the streets, and the palms of their hands to receiv what others shall
freely bestow upon them.

The Profet of the Lord is returned from thecav, and descending the Mount of
God, and trial must now be mad, which is the living, and true Lord God, and the
God which answers by fyr, he was, is, and for ever shall appear to be the
only, living, and true God: Wherefore al ye worshipers of al sorts, of what nams,
and in what forms, and professions soever, without the life and pur Power of
God, gather your selves together, every on to the worship of your God, with the
Masses, Ave-Marys, Pater-nosters, Dyrectorys, Servis-books, Common Prayers, and
Extemporary Devotions, and cry aloud for your God is now faling into asleep out
of which he shall never mor awak, he is on a journey from which he shall never mor
return, and if audiens, and help now fayl you, there is no way of escaping for
you, but by the two edged sword of the Lord ye must be slauhtered, in to the
Lak of perdition must ye be cast, and the vengeans of Eternal fyr seiz upon
you.

Thy Schools, Colleges and Vniversitys ar as so many standing, stinking ponds
of corrupt, Infectios, and poisoning waters, corruptin, and infecting Man kind
even from their chyld-hood raising, quickening, and norishing that spirit, and
Power in them, which is foolishnes, and enmity against God, fiting them only
to be habitations of Devils to ferv, and worship the devil, the God of the
world in their generation, trayning them up in the learning, and knowledge of
tongu's, parts, and arts standing in that wisdom, and Power, which is
foolishnes, and enmity against the pur Lord God.

Whose rys, and continuans to this day is in the spirit of the old serpent which
was in Cain and his posterity, that Liberal-art-inventing-spirit, and in the
astrologers of Egypt and Babylon, and those curios liberal Artists, who at the
appearans of truth in, and throuh the holy apostels brouht their books
together, and burnt them openly, tho valued at an hy rat, and happy would it
be for them, if, at the appearans of truth now, throuh the despised and
contemned children of the lyt, they myt be brouht to follovv their exampel, for
the day is now com, in which they must receiv their just, and ryteos revvard
at the hand of the Lord God omnipotent, even in the lak of perdition, and
destruction with their lybrarys, and suffer the vengeans of eternal fyr, with
that body of vvhordoms, and abominations, of which they are, as it were the
womb or generating part.

Thy Towns, and Citys, ar as so many svvarms of filthy vermin, sending forth
the stinking smells of Covetosnes, pride, deceit, oppression, vanity Idelnes,
lust, whordom, drunkenes, gluttony, and al Manner of unryteos and abominabel
practices. But the day is now com, in which they must receiv the just revvard
of their doings, and be daily mor, and mor depopulated, and the great, and fair
houses stand without Inhabitants, and shall vvast, and consum away until they
become as un-waled villages.

Thy courts of Iudicatur with their dependanses, to wit, those called Judges,
Doctors and Sergeants at Law, Counselers, Advocats, Aturnys, Solicitors,
clarks, and scrybs so many, seats and instruments of cruel oppresion injustis,
brybery, and extortion, even a most intolerabel burden to the peepel of the
several nations, tongu's, and languages, Amongst whom they Exercys dominion,
who in sted of doing them justis, ending their differenses and reconcyling
them to on another, make aprey of them, laying burdens on them grievos and hevy
to be born, but not touching them to help or eas them with on of their
fingers, causing them to spend their tym, vvear out their bodies, vex, and
torment their Spirits, vvast, and consum their Estats in waiting, and
attending on them, and yet to fayl of their expected issu from them. But the
day is now com, in which they also shall receiv the just revvard of their
dongs, even wrath, vvo, misery, and destruction from the presens of the Lord
God, and the glory of his pur power, in the lak with that Beastly Body of
which they are members, whose cursed and oppresing Power they represent and
Exercys.

Thy several sorts of Merchants, buyers, selers and traders, in ships, shops,
War-houses, Ins, victualing-houses, fayrs, and markets, with their weihts, and
mesurs: so many plases, instruments, and inventions in ways of comers in that
spirit which is enmity against God, whose practices have bin, and still ar to hord
up the several stors, and provisions of the house of God, til they somtyms
corrupt, rot, and spoil whylst many poor cretursly up and down streets, and
villages hungry, cold, and in want of clothing pyning away, and perishing for
want of the creturs (which spoil, and oppresion must now be charged on them)
making marchandys of the gifts of God, which al flow from the on gift which he
freely gav to the children of men, without respect to persons, somtyms
deceitfully mingling the Creturs, the corrupt with the sound, putting on them
deceitful colors and garnishings, to increas their dishonest gain by them, the
seler using many deceitful words about the goodness of them, and the Buyer the
lyk to undervalu them, the seler often tyms taking advantag on the want
necessity, and ignorans of the buyer; and the buyer oftentyms doing the sam to
the seler, using also ways of dec^it to make the creturs to weih the hevier, and
fill the mesur sooner then otherwys it would, and thus the spirit of covetosnes,
deceit, theft, and oppression acts both buyer, and seler.

But the day is now com, in which they also must receiv the just, and ryteos
reward of their doings from the ryteos Lord God omnipotent, the hand of the
Lord is smyting at al your dishonest gain: VVo, misery, weeping, and bitter
howling, and lamentation must now be (daily mor, and mor) your portions, death
and withering is now seizing on you, which shall continu, until your ships,
shops, Ins, victualing-houses, fayrs and marktes weihts and mesurs, ceas to be
frequented or mad us of, The Lord will recover his corn, wyn, wool, and flax
even all the stors of his house out of your hands and will feed, and cloth his
household himself, and giv them food, and raiment in du season, and in du
proportion, and al who shall put^r or either on their baks, or into their bellys,
shall receiv in themselves the just reward of their own sham, and folly from the
Lord God.

Thy several Nations, Kindreds, Tengu's, and Languages ar as the dispersed,
divyded, and confounded builders of babel, as so many several fields over
grown with brambels, bushes, briars, and thorns, abounding bounding in all
manner of the cursed fruits of the seed of the old serpent ready ryp to be cut
down, and consumed, by the vengeans of the eternal fyr of Gods just, and Ryteos
wrath, and vengeans, which is now broken forth on them and shall daily mor, and
mor be revealed from heven against them.

Thy whole body even head and tail, branch and Root, rulers, wariors, priests and
pe^pel, by and low, rich and poor, bond and free, great and small, mal and
femal, even al under the dragon's beast's, and falls profets, spirit, and Power,
ar a corrupted loathsome, and defiled body of sin and death, even the body of
that beast which Daniel in the spirit of prophesy saw; which is now to be
slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flams: by all which it
has, and does appear, that great has bin, and is the mystery of Iniquity, to
wit, the old serrpent, the God of the world, the devil, mad manifest in flesh,
and now Judged and condemned in the put Power of the eternal spirit, seen,
and comprehended by Angels, believed on, and vvorshiped in the world, by all
whose nams are not written in the lambs book of life, and now thrusting down to
everlasting sham, and contemt, and suffer the vengeans of eternal fyr) vvher by
the habitabel parts of the earth have bin the cross, on which the lamb, slain from
the foundation of the world which lies in wicdednes, has bin crucified, and
mankind ground, throuh vvo, misery, grief and pyan, as betwixt the nether and
upper milstons (to wit) that cursed, cruel, oppresing and helish power, and
dominion which has bin, and still is exercysed over man kind, by such as have,
and still do rul over them in the spirit, and Power of the old serpent the
devil, as the Nether mil-ston. And those just and ryteos Judgments, tribulation,
and wrath, of God which have seized on body soul, and spirit of every particular
that has don evil, as the upper milston. So that the Eden of God has bin mad
as a desolat wilderness, the house of liberty, and freedom, a house of misery,
thraldom and cruel bondag; the Tempel, and seat of God, the synagogu' of
satan; even the thron, and seat of the Man of sin siting in it as God; the
house of prayer, A den of murdering thievs and Robers, and the garden of the
Lord a field of blood, and murder.

But the voys is go^ forth from the Lord God, whose words ar spirit, life, and
Power for Man's return, and as Man-kynd coms to inclyn the ear, and heart, to
hear, and obey the reproofs of instruction in the inward parts, which is the
way of life, and door of Eternal salvation, the vois of this cursed mil shall
ceas, and the nether ston there of be cast into the bottom of the Sea never to
arys mor, and the upper ston, in mercy and lov, by the Lord, be removed, and so
the field of blood, and cruelty shall be com the garden of the Lord, in which
Man-kynd shall dwell, and walk, reconcyled unto God, and on to another unyted
together in the everlasting bond, and Covenant of pur life, lov, Peace and
Ryteosues, never mor to be forgoten, and the den of thievs, a House of Prayer to
al Nations, and Generations: the Thron, and seat of the Man of sin, the Tempel,
seat and Thron of the living, and pur God: the House of misery, thraldom, and
bondag', the plas of the glorios Manifestation, and enjoyment of the glorios
freedom, and liberty of the Son of God, and the desolat Wilderness, shall become
the Eden of God.

Throuh al which Man-kynd has, and yet mor perfectly shall, experiens the
differens betwixt the cursed fruits of the ways of his own choys, and the
sweet, pleasant, and blesed fruits of abiding in that stat of pur Life, Lov,
Peace, Ryteosnes, and Dominion over the works of Gods hands, in which he was
plased before the entrans of sin, and transgression, and to which Christ the
Lyt, Wisdom, and Power of God in mal and femal is now redeeming and restoring
Man-kynd again into.

Persecution and bloodshed of the Innocent.
If from the guilt of Innocent Blood thou would go about to wyp thy mouth or
wash thy hands, then surly the records of the many dear Innocent and holy
Servants of the Lord, Saints, Martyrs, and faithful witneses of Jesus, both mal
and femal, who have bin secretly and openly, murdered, by hanging, burning, and
dyvers other Antichristian, and cruel vvays put to death in thee O Christendom,
giv loud, and sufficient evidens against thee to stop thy mouth, and render
thee speechles, against whom thou had nothing but as concerning the law of
their God, some whereof being put to Does not many Months sins by hanging, even
in New England, which are still fresh in memory, even at the hands of such as not
long sins, left their own natyy Cuntry, under a pretens to avoid persecution
from others, and enjoy liberty of Conscience in matters of Religion and worship
themselves, which has rendered their cruelty, and Murder, don upon my Brethren
and Sister; those innocent Servants of the Lord, much mor grievos, impios, and
abominabel, besvds their cruel, and Antichristian dealings with many Others, by
fyns, cruel imprisonments, spoiling of goods, banishment, and cuting of ears.

Further mor if thy Heds and Rulers in the Military, civil, and Ecclesiastical
Power (so caled) shall plead a Ryt in and over the nations, by Heyr ship,
Succesion and ancient prescription, and so go about to justify al their
oppresions, wars, murder and wickedness, as being lawful to do what they will
with their own.

To it I answer, that al pleas of Ryt by Heyr ship, succesion, and ancient
prescription, which have not their foundation in the Pur law of lyt and life, and
sound reason which is of God, ar null and void; That heirship, and succession
which is unsound, and rotten in the ground, and foundation, can never be mad
sound and good by ancient prescription; But on the contrary, it renders the
heyrs and successors in such claims, by so much the mor deeply guilty, and
lyabel to the greater and mor hevy Judgment, and condemnation. Now it may, and
Does appear by records of truth; That the ground and foundation of that Power
in which ye stand as to Christendom was laid in deceit, The foundation of
the present Civil and Ecclesiastical government, so ca^ed.
unfaithfulnes, treachery, Murder and Apostasy (tho as to the antiquity of
prescription it is of a larger extent then perhaps your selves, may plead, or
think Its original, root and spring being from that old Serpentyn Spirit,
which was a liar, and a Murderer from the beginning of the World which lies
in wickedness.) But your original Predecessor in that Power and Spirit in
which ye stand as to Christendom (viz. Julius Caesar) being entrusted as
Captain General, or Commander in Chief of the Military forses, under the Roman
Counsel, in whom the Power was then resyding, did, with those confederat
with him, grasp the Military Power into his own hand, and therewith wrested
the Power of Government out of their hands and set up himself as Chief head.

The guilt of Christ's blood lies
Sins which usurpation, Christ Jesus that innocent lamb of God was cruelly
murdered, and crucified, without the gats of Jerusalem, whose innocence was by
Pylat three times acknowledged, upon the Government.
openly before the peepel who although he washed his hands yet was not thereby clear
of the guilt of the Innocent blood, of that just man being, by him sentensed
and delivered to the Jews to be crucified who was a Roman Judge, a member of
that sam body of Power in which ye stand, and what he did therein, he did it
not as a particular person, but as a representer, and executioner of the Roman
Power, so that the guilt of the Innocent blood of that just man, stands not
only chargabel on him, but on that Power of which he was a member, and which
he represented, and executed, of which spirit, and Power ye ar the Heyrs and
successors; and Pylat in the inscription which he caused to be set over his
head, acknowledged him to be Jesus of nazareth King of the Jews, which
inscription ye also cause to be put on the croses which ye s^t up as in
Remembrans of him, and in words acknowledge him to be the son, and heyr of God,
and of al things that are of God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, entyteling
your selves to the Kingdoms, Dominions, and teritorys over which ye rul, by the
Gras of God; They that are, Kings by the gras of God, must be children of God,
born of him; and do his, not the Devils works.
the fulness whereof dwelt bodyly in Christ, caling your selves Christian Emperors
Kings, Prinses, and Rulers; and with joint consent, acknowledge your several
Kingdoms, Dominions and territorys to be altogether, Christendom, which
Imports no les, then that they are Christ's Kingdom, so that unles ye be in
truth, what ye profes your selves to be, to wit, children of God, Christian
Emperors, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers, mad so by the gras of God, which renders
al who truly partak there of, to be the children of God, and fellow heyrs with
Christ, of al things; then by your own confessions ye ar but a company of
usurpers, and oppressors, and have no true Ryt to exercys dominion over the
nations in that spirit, and Power in which ye stand, and by which ye ar acted.

Now the scripturs of truth say, that he that is born of God does not commit
sin, and that herin ar the children of God, and of the Devil mad manifest, and
he that says he abides in Christ ouht to walk even as he vvalked; the Jews of
old said they were the children of Abraham, but they being found in vvays of
deceit, hypocrisy, Oppression, Idolatry, persecution, and murdering the
Innocent saints, and holy profets of the Lord, Christ told them they were
children of their father the Devil, being found doing his works, so that if
ye be found commiting of sin, and not vvalking as Christ vvalked, and guilty
of those evil practices which the Jews were, then ar ye, not such as ar born
of God, nor true Christian Emperors, Kings, Prinses, and Rulers, by the gras of
God, but the children of that Father vvhos works ye do: and a company of
usurpers such as have no true Ryt, to exercys Dominion over the nations: But that
ye ar such, is plain, and evident in the precedent charg, evidensed by a cloud
of witneses and therefore your claym of Ryt, by heir-ship, and prescription is
rotten, null, and void.

What it is to be Christ's vicar.
And for the Pop to affirm himself to be Christ's Vicar; it Implies no les then
to represent his person, and in his spirit, and Power to do his work, now its
recorded of Christ, that he was meek and lowly in heart, holy, harmles,
undesyled and seperat from sin, and siners in life, going up and down doing good
reproving sin, teaching, and exhorting peepel to ways of mercy, truth
ryteosnes, purity, meeknes, humility, and holiness; But that the Pop is found
acted by a spirit and in a practis of dyrect antipathy against the Spirit of
Christ and so is rendered to be the Antichrist, is plain, and evident in the
precedent charg, evidensed by a cloud of witneses, and therefore his pretens of
being Christ's vicar is false, and void.

The Pop succedeth Peter, as Sin succceded innocence in order of tym; or as a
thorn does a vyn when it grows in the sam plas where ^ns a vyn did grow.
And for the Pop to say he is Peter's Successor, Imports no les then to
represent his person, and in his spirit and Power to do his work: Now Peter in
his epistel, upon record says thus, the elders which are amongst you l exhort,
who am also an elder, and a witness of the suffering of Christ, a partaker of
the glory that shall be revealed; feed the flok of God which is among you,
taking the oversyt thereof, not by constraint but wilingly, nor for filthy luker
but of a ready mind, nether as being Lords over Gods heritag, but as being (good
exampels to the flok, that when the great shepherd shall appear, ye may receiv
a crown of glory that fades not away.

But that the Pop is found nether in that spirit or work in which Peter was, is
plain, and evident in the precedent charg, evidensed by a cloud of witneses;
and therefore his claym of being Peter's successor is false and void also.

And for the whole body of thy Ecclesiastical Power (so caled) with all the
worshipers to them belonging, to affirm themselves to be the true church, and
faithful spous of Christ; the holy church which ons appeared, and was mad
manifest in, and throuh the saints which dwelled at Rom, It imports no les,
then that they must be found holding the sam pur mystery of faith in a pur
conscience, and be the caled, and sanctified of God according to his purpos,
vvalking in the sam holy fellowship in the Spirit of truth, which the saints
of the church of Christ, which in the Apostels days appeared in Rom, held, and
walked in.

But that thy Ecclesiastical body or clergy (so caled) with all the worshipers
to them belonging ar corrupt in Doctrine, fellowship and conversation, and fallen
away, and apostatysed from that Pur Doctrine worship, fellowship, and holy
conversation, with was held, and vvalked in by them, is Plain, and evident in
the precedent charg, evidensedby a cloud of vvitneses, and therefore their claym
of being the holy Church of Rom is false, and void also.

So that upon the whole O Christendom, thou art found to be the household of an
old thief, a cruel oppresing murderer, and a most filthy abominabel whor,
standing naked in the sit of God, Angels, and Men, and found guilty of al those
great provocations, and bloody abominations which in the precedent charg is
prodused against thee.

Now therefore O thou Leopold, and thou O Pop of Rom, with all ye Kings, Prinses,
Rulers, and Governors, and al in authority under you, of what degree, rank, or
order soever whether Military, Civil, Spiritual or Ecclesiastical (so caled)
and al Peepel both hy and low, rich and poor, bond and free, small and great,
mal and femal, even the whole body of thee O Christendom, with all the Dominions,
and Territorys to thee belonging, who ar under the Command, Government, and
teaching of Man

Givear, and hear, the most just, and ryteos, decree, and irrevocabel Sentens
of the Lord God Omnipotent of Heven, and Earth, even the living God, and former
of al things, against, and concerning thee.

The dredful, and most terribel Battle Ax, of the most just, Ryteos, Powerful
Lord God of vengeans is now laid to thy Root, and that Power, and spirit by
which thou art now acted and in which thou now stand, vvil the Lord God,
now hew down, root up and utterly destroy, yea his most just, and Ryteos
wrath, plagu's, and vengeans, is even already brok forth upon thee, and shall
daily mor, and mor appear, and be revealed from heven against thee, even as
pangs upon a traveling woman, from which thou can, by no means escap.

Tho thy Potentats, Prinses, Rulers, and Peepel, have, do, and shall set them
selves, and tak counsel against the Lord, and his anointed, yet he that sits in
heven now lafs them to scorn, yea the Lord has them in derision, and he is now
speaking to them (throuh his sanctified on's) in his wrath, and has, and yet
mor, and mor, will, vex them in his sor displesur, his Iron rod is now taking
into his hand, with which he has begun and daily mor, and mor dash the
Nations to pieces as a poters vessel, in thee O Christendom, and they shall
daily mor and mor fall and be subdued under him, til al his enemies become his
footstool; The Rod of his strength is sent out of Syon, and he in mesur ruls,
and daily mor, and mor shall rul in the midst of his enemies in thee; At his ryt
Hand he is now stryking throuh Kings, yea he is judging among the heathen in
thee, and wounding the heds over dyvers Cuntrys, and his head is now lifting up,
in, throuh, and over al his enemies in thee: The evening of that day, known to
the Lord is now com, in which the lyt has appeared, and the morning of that
day is approached, in which the just in mesur has, and daily mor, and mor
shall, have pur Dominion over al their enemies in thee: Death is now feeding on
thee, and thy beauty fading and withering away as the gras upon the house top;
And for as much as God has caled, and thou have not regarded, but set at nouht
his Counsels and would non of his reproof, he now lafs at thy destruction,
and moks at the fears which are coming upon thee, on every hand, even as
desolation, and thy destruction as a whirlwind, and although thou cryest yet will
he not hear, even to the Lord, yet vvil he not answer thee, becaust thou have
hated instruction and rejected his warning, and Counsels, throuh his Servants,
and Messengers; Therefore shall thou now eat the fruits of thy own doings, and be
filed with the just revvard of thy own ways of wickedness, the tokens of thy
south sayers vvil he frustrat, and make thy Divyners or Spiritual Men mad.

Thy Sun, thy Moon and thy Stars, ar become dark, the Keepers of thy house begin
to trembel, and thy strong Men to bow themselves dredful fears ar coming on thee
on every hand, because Man is now going to his long hom, and the mourners begin
to go about the streets, he is coming forth out of the wilderness with his
beloved leaning on him, lyk Pillars of smoke, who looks forth as the morning,
and is terribel as an army with banners, yea he is making have as a Roe or young
heart upon the mountains of Bether, and will now most assuredly eas himself of
his adversarys, and aveng himself upon al his, and his dear, oppresed,
despised, and cruelly murdered Saints, and Peepels enemies, from the least to
the greatest: Thy youths shall faint, and thy strong men shall utterly fall, yea
even become as Tow, and the maker of al as a spark in them, and they shall burn
together, and non shall be abel to quench them.

The Lyt of Israel is become a fyr, and the holy on A flam in thee, which shall
not ceas burning til all the briars and thorns in thee be utterly consumed, and
burnt up; the loftynes of Man is now bowing down and the hauhtynes of man is
the Lord now laying low: the day of the Lords just wrath and vengeans is now
com, and shall be upon all the proud that are lifted up, they shall be abased, and
laid low even in the dust, and the Lord alon (in his sanctified ons) shall be
exalted in, throuh, and over al in thee.

His and his dear despised, and afflicted peepels enemies, in mesur have, and
daily mor, and mor shall, run into hols, and Cavs of the Earth for fear of the
Lord, and because of the greatness of his glory, pur Power, and presens in his
Peepel, who is how risen in them, and throuh them (in mesur has) and daily
mor, and mor shall, shak terribely the earth. The Rod is sprung forth out of the
stem of Iesse, and with the sword of his mouth, is he smyting the earth, and
with the breath of his lips slaying the wicked: the Lord has raised up on from
the North, who from the rising of the sun, has called upon his nam, and he is
com, and coming upon thy Prinses as upon mortar, and vvil tread them as the
poter does the clay in thee O Christendom.

And although the Potentats, Kings, Prinses, Rulers, and Peepel, do associat
themselves together, yet they shall be kroken to pieces, tho they tak crafty
counsel, and speak the word, yet it shall not stand, but be utterly frustrat,
and com to nauht, for the Lord God ommipent is in, and with his heritag, who ar
now become a holy Tempel, and dweling plas for the Lord God of Jacob, even apur
tabernakel for the sun of ryteosnes, who is now risen in them, rejoicing as a
strong man to run his ras, his glorios beams of pur, and eternal lyt, break
forth over the tops of the mountains, which now begin to smoke, he is looking
from the top of Amana, and from the top of shynar, and Hermon, even from the
lions dens, and mountains of the leopards, he has caled his myty: ons for his
anger, even them that rejoys in his hynes.

The bauner of the Lord is now lifted up against spiritual Babylon in thee O
Christendom: the noys of a multitud is now breaking forth even a tumultuos noys
of Kingdoms and nations gathering together! The Lord of hosts is mustering his
hosts for the battle, they com from the end of heven, even the Lord, and the
weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land, to wit, that Power, and
spirit in which thy Potentats, Kings, Prinses, Rulers, VVariors, Teachers, and
Peepel now stand, and by which they are now acted, He that is Red in his apparel
is now com forth, and shall daily mor, and mor appear in dyed garments,
traveling in the greatness of his myt, who speaks in Ryteosnes, myty to sav, and
to destroy, the day of vengeans is in his heart, and he will tread the VVynpres
of his fires wrath in thee, even tread down thy Peepel in his fury, and trampel
upon them in his anger, and stain al his raiment, yea make them drunk in his
fury and bring down thy strength to the ground, O Christendom.

His sword is in mesur drawn, and furbished for the slauhter he will even bath
his two edged sword in heven, in thee, and thou that have spoiled must now be
spoiled, the Lord with his great and long sword (in mesur has) and daily mor,
and mor shall piers Levyathan that piersing crooked Serpent and slay the dragon
in thy sea he is now declaring, and publishing among the nations: the standard
is up, and spiritual Babylon in thee, shall be confounded, and utterly
destroyed, and her Images, and ydols broken to pieces; for out of the North
there comes a nation against her, who (in mesur already has) and daily mor and
mor shall, make her land desolat, he is causing to com up an assembly from the
North cuntrry, who (in mesur already has) and daily mor, and mor shall, set
themselves in battle array against her, and from thens shall she be utterly
destroyed, not by myt or power of the arm of flesh, but by my spirit, even the
sword of my mouth says the Lord God; their arrows ar as of a myty expert man,
non shall return in vain, a sound of battle is in thy land, and of great
destructions: the hammer of the whole Earth in thee, shall be cut, and broken to
pieces, and spiritual Babylon in thee, shall be an utter desolation among the
nations, thy young men shall fall by the sword in battle; and thy myty men of war
be cut of, the most proud shall utterly fall, and non shall be abel to rays him
up, yea a fyr is (in mesur) Kindled in thy citys, which shall devour round
about, the sword of the Lord is drawing upon thy inhabitants, upon thy
Potentats, upon thy wys men, thy lying Profets, and falls teachers and they shall
dote: upon thy horses, and upon thy chariots, and they shall fall and be broken
to pieces; upon al thy mingled peepel, and they shall become as Women; upon thy
tresurs, and they shall be Robed: even a drouth upon thy waters, and they shall
be dried up; for thy land is a Land of graven images, and they are mad upon
their Ydols.

A peepel ar and shall daily mor, and mor appear coming up from the North agreat
nation, and many Kings shall be raised up from the East, and coasts of the
earth, cruelly their voys shall roar as the sea, and shall set themselves in array
against thee, Round about, and the hands of thy Potentats, Kings, Prinses,
Rulers, and Peepel, shall wax feebel, sorrovv shall daily mor, and mortak hold,
on them, as Pangs upon a traveling woman, This is the decree, and irrevocabel
sentens of the Lord against spiritual Babylon in thee O Christendom.

The Lords faners ar com, and coming upon thee, who shall fan, and emty thy
land, and shall not spar thy Young nien, but utterly destroy al thy host, the
slain shall fall in thy land and they that are thrust throuh in thy streets: his
Arrows ar making bryt, the Lord is raising up the Spirit of the Kings of the
East, for his decree is against spiritual babylon in thee, utterly to destroy
it: now is the day of the Lords most ryteos vengeans, even the vengeans of his
Tempel, O thou that dwelest upon many waters abundant in tresur thy end is
com; and shall daily mor and mor appear, I will fill thee with men as with
caterpilars, and they shall lift up A shout against thee, says the Lord of
hosts; who has mad the earth by his Power, and established the world by his
wisdom and stretched out the heven by his understanding, who is the Portion of
Jacob, and former of al things the Lord of hosts is his nam, and his own pur
seed Immortal is the true Israel, even his Battle Ax and weapons of war, with
which he (in mesur already) has) and Daily mor, and mor shall break in sunder
the Nations, and destroy Kingdoms, and render to spiritual Babylon all the evil
which they have don in Syon: even in your sit says the Lord God: I am against
thee o destroying mountain, and will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and roll
thee down from the roks, and make thee a burnt mountain, the trumpet is blown,
and blowing amongst the nations, and they are preparing against thee, the Kings
of the east, the Captains, and Rulers of the land of his Dominion, and thy land
O Christendom shall greatly trembel, for every purpos against spiritual Babylon
in thee shall be performed, to make her an utter desolation; Thy myty men shall
fall, and become as women, they shall burn thy dweling plases, and break al thy
bars; on post shall run to meet another, to show to the King of spiritual
Babylon, that his city is taken ar on end thereof, which is well ny already
accomplished (mark that) for the Passages begin to be stoped, and the Reeds ar
in mesur, burnt, and the Men of War ar affryted; and yet a very littel whyl,
and the tym of her harvest, and threshing shall com, says the Lord of hosts,
who already (in mesur) has and daily mor and mor shall, Plead the cause of his
Peepel with thee, and dry up thy sea yea even make dry thy springs, thy
inhabitants shall roar lyk bears, and yel, lyk lions whelps, and become drunk,
and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awak any mor says the Lord; who vvil
execut judgment upon thy graven images, and the slain shall fall in the midst of
thee, for spoylers ar com, and coming upon her from the north, says the Lord,
and as spiritual Babylon has caused the slain of Gods seed to fall, so at
Babylon shall fall the slain of all the Earth: Thy Broad walls shall be utterly
broken, and thy hy gats burnt, and thy wariors shall contend in vain and labor
in the fyr, and I will make drunk thy Potentats, Prinses, wys men, Captains,
Rulers, and myty men, and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awak any
mor says the Lord God. The ston is cut out of the mountain without hands, and

Pieces, even thy military, Civil, and Ecclesiastical Power (so caled,) which are
the feet, and toes of that imag, with Nebuchadnezar savv, and the Iron, the
Clay, the Bras, the Silver, and the Gold in thee, shall be broken to pieces, and
become as the chaf of the summer threshing floor, and the fires wynd of the
Ryteos wrath of God shall carry them away, and their plas shall no mor be

the house of the Lord, which shall be exalted on the top of al mountains, and
shall daily, and gradually, mor, and mor grow til it fill the whole Earth: now
is the God of heven seting up a Kingdom, that shall never be destroyed nether
shall it be left uuto another peepel, but it shall break in Pieces, and consum al
Kingdoms in thee: Throns ar now casting down, and the Ancient of days is now
siting, vvhos thron is lyk a fyery flam, and his wheels as burning fyr, a
fyery stream Issues forth before him and ten thousand tyms ten thousand
Minister unto him, the Judgment is set, the books ar in mesur opened, and daily

littel horn that subdued three Kingdoms, whose look was mor stout then his

under the whole hevens, shall daily mor, and mor be given unto the Peepel of the
Saints of the most hy, whose Kingdom, is an everlasting Kingdom, and al
Dominions shall serve and obey him; Troubelsom tidings Out of the From the Fast
outward armies with outward Weapons of cruelty, and from the North the spiritual
Battle Ax from wheas Babylon shall be utterly destroyed, not by myt but by the
sword of the spirit or word of his mouto
North and East ar now seizing on thee, the Lord will gather thy nations
together, and bring them down to the valley, and vvil plead with them there, for
his Peepel and for his heritag, whom they have scattered and cruelly dealt with,
spoiled and murdered in thee o Christendom: he is preparing war, and wakening
up the myty, drawing them near to com up, and beat their plow shars into
swords, and their pruning hooks into spears, and they shall awak and com up to
the valley, for there will the Lord sit to Judge all the Hethen in thee round about.
The harvest is even ryp, the si^kel is putting in the pres is filing, and the
fats shall over flow, for wickedness is Exceeding great in thee; multituds,
multituds is the Lord gathering into the valley of decision: The great and
notabel day of the Lord is now appearing he is now roaring out of Syon, and
uttering forth his voys, his terribel voys from his Holy habitation and the
earth in thee shall terribely shak, and trembel, for the Lord is become the hop of
his Peepel who have a strong city to which God has appointed salvation for
walls, and bulwarks.

But as for thee, the pride of thy heart has deceived thee, thou that dwelest
in the clefts of the roks, and say in thy heart who shall bring me down; Tho
thou have exalted thy self as the eagel, and set thy nest among the stars, yet
from thens will I bring thee down says the Lord God ommipotent.

Wherefore hear O ye mountains, and giv ear ye strong foundations of the Earth
in thee O Christendom; for the Lord has a controversy with you, he is drawing
near to plead the cause of his crucified ^on, his cruelly tortured, and murdered
saints, his greatly burdened spoiled, and oppresed Peepel in thee. VVo, VVo,
VVo, to the bloody city that is full of lys, and robbery, the noys of the whip,
and the noys of the rateling of the wheels and the cransing of the horser is
coming on thee, the horse man draws near to lift up the bryt sword and the
glittering spear, and a multitud of carkases shall fall, and they shall stumbel
upon the corpse because of the multitud of the whordoms of the great skarlet
whor, the mother of harlots, and mistress of witchcrafts that has sold the
nations throuh her crafts; behold I am against thee says the Lord of hosts,
and will discover thy skirts upon thy fas, and show the nations thy nakedness,
and Kingdoms thy sham, and cast abominabel filth upon thee, and make thee vyl,
yea even set thee for a gazing stok; al thy strong holds shall be as figtrees
with the first Ryp figs, which when they are shaken, shall fall into the mouth of
the eater: tho thou provyd for the sieg, and fortify thy strong holds, and
garrisons, yet a fyr shall devour thee, the sword shall cut thee of, and eat up
thy flesh lyk fyr, thou have multiplyd thy merchants abov the stars of heven,
thy shepherds stumber, thy Potentats, Kings, Prinses, Rulers, and Counselers
dwell in the dust, and thy Peepel ar as a flok scattered upon the barren
mountains, there is no healing of thy breach, thy wound is incurabel, such as
hear the report of thee, shall clap their hands, for upon whom have thou not
caused thy filth, and abominabel wickedness to pas continually.

The vision that was for an appointed tym is now speaking, tho it has tarryed
long, yet it is now surly com: they shall suddenly awak that shall byt thee, and
arys that shall vex thee, and thou shall be for a booty unto them, because of
innocent blood, and for the spoil, and vyolens found in thee, thou shall be
filed with sham for glory, the cup of the Lords Ryteos indignation is now
handing forth unto thee, shamful spewing shall be on al thy glory, thy graven
Images shall not profit thee, for the Lord is in his Holy Tempel, and all the
Earth shall be put to sylens before him, ^he is now drawing near to dryv in sunder
the Nations and to scatter the hy and lofty mountains, yea all the hills shall bow
before him whose way is everlasting. Affliction, and dredful trembling is now
seizing on thee, for the Lord is near to march throuh thy Land in great, and
dredful indignation, yea he is going forth for the salvation of his peepel,
even for the salvation of his anointed, and will wound the heads of the house of
wickedness in thee O Christendom, and discover and overturn the foundations of
them, and scatter the wicked as with a Whirlwynd, whose rejoysing has bin to
oppres spoil, and murder the Poor, Needy, and Innocent, yea he will march throuh
thy Sea, and trampel upon the heaps of thy great Waters. The Day is now com,
that he is risen to the prey, for his determination is to gather together the
Nations, and to assembel the Kingdoms in thee, to pour on them his most ryteos
vengeans and indignation, even al his fires wrath and Anger, and the Earth
shall be devoured with the fyr of his Jelofy.

But the Peepel of pur Languag shall call upon his Nam, and get them a prays, and
a goodsavor and fam in every Land, and my Peepel shall never he ashamed, says
the Lord God, who is now shaking the Hevens and the Earth, and overtu^ning the
Throns of Kingdoms, and they shall be brouht down by the sword, and utterly
broken to pieces; The great Mountain in thee shall be com a plain before him: The
flying roll is seen which contains the terribel curs, which is now going forth
over the fas of the whole Earth, and every on that steals, and swears shall be
cut of according to it; The Lord has brouth it forth, and it is entering into
the house of the thief, and of him that swears falsely by my Nam, says the
Lord, which falls swearing has bin the practis of thy Potentats, Kings, Prinses
Rulers, and Magistrates at their Coronations, or Instalments (so caled) into
their Governments, as also other inferior Officers, Jurors, and Evidenses in
thy Courts, which ouht to have bin Courts of true Judgment and Justis, because of
which oaths thy Land shall mourn.

The Holy City which is free (and the Mother of all the Children of true freedom)
is in mesur descended from God out of Heven, and shall daily mor, and mor
appear, whose walls, and Bulwarks ar salvation, and the gats thereof Prays, and is
now in mesur, become a Burdensome ston to al Nations, and al who burden
themselves with her, shall be broken to pieces, yea she is become as an herth of
fyr among dry vvood and as a Flaming Torch in the midst of a sheaf of dried

lofty City he is bringing down, and laying it lovv, even with the ground, the

vvherin the woman which is wickedness (even the man of sin) siteth, which
must now be born into the land of shynar, and be sit, and established upon her

Nimrods Kingdom that myty hunter before the Lord) to wit, the lak or bottomless
pit in every Particular, mal and femal and eternal Judgment there plased on the
head of the transgresing Power in the in ward parts, which is the ground out of
which it sprang, even the Topht prepared for the King, and every subject, in
the Kingdom, Spirit and Power of darkness; Dives the Rich man, that has bin
clothed in purpel and skarlet, and fared delitiosly every day, born after the

the Spirit, most now go to his Plas, of torment, and not have on drop of water
to cool his tongu' and Lazarus the man of sorrovvs, must now be carried into
Abraham's Bosom: an eternal separation must now be mad, betwixt the two

death, what.
a Never dying worm, and fyr that shall never be quenched, and the breath of the
Lord which has (in mesur) Kindled it, shall, as an inexhaustibel River of
brimston, keep it burning in the inward parts, in every Particular, which is
the death of death, the hell of hell, and the grav of the grav, but to, and in the
other, and the seed thereof, the Eternal pur Power will be a pur, endless, and
never fading Kingdom of life, lov, peace, comfort, Ryteosnes and joy,
unspeakabel, and full of glory, which is the heven of hevens, which conteins
not him who is the eternal, Incompehensibel father and fountain of pur life and
fulness, who is in, throuh, and over al.

The Lord is now com into his Tempel, even the messenger of the covenant, in
whom his sanctified ons delyt; behold he is even now com, and shall daily mor,
and mor appear, but who may abyd the day of his coming, or be abel to stand in
his now appearing, surly only such as can dwell with the devouring fyr, and with
the everlasting burnings, he is even com near to thee to judgment, and is become
(in his sanctified on's) a swift, and faithful witness, against the sorcerer
the adulterer, and falls swearer, and the oppreser of the Fatherles, and widow,
that turns asyd the stranger from his Ryt, even the true heyr of al who has
bin long as a stranger in the Earth, who is the sam as in the beginning, and
changes not, and therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed, yea the day that
burns as an oven is now com, and the Proud yea all that do wickedly in thee,
ar become as dried stubbel fited for the fyr, and the day that is now com (in
mesur already) has and daily mor, and mor shall burn them up, and consum them,
even Root and Branch, says the Lord God of truth; his fan is in his hand, and
he is Purging his own floor and gathering the wheat into his garner, but will
burn up the chaf, straw, and stubbel with unquenchabel fyr, and with such
Judgment as the dragon, beast, and falls Profet in thee, have judged, they must
now be judged, and such mesur as they have met, must now be mesured to them
again, the King of glory is now com to call al his stewards and servants to
account both great and small in thee, and such as have bin without compassion to
their fellow servants, taking them by the throat, suing them, and casting them
into prison, about dets, and Carnal things, will he now deliver to the
tormenter, til themselves have paid the uttermost farthing, and such as in the
absens of the Lord and true master of al, have bin found beating and abusing their
fellow servants, even cruely oppresing, and murdering the innocent, vvil he
now cut in sunder, and giv them their Portion with Hypocryts in the lak, even
in utter darkness, where is weeping, vvayling and gnashing of teeth for ever; and
all the Ydel, and slothful servants, who have hid the Lords money in them, as in
the Earth, and not improved it, vvil he now bynd, hand and foot, and cast into
utter darkness, vvher their worm dies not, and their fyr is not quenched, and
all the foolish virgins which are found fluin bering, and running to the buyers,
and selers to get oil, shall be shut out from the brydgrooms presens, and although
both buyers, and selers may Plead, that they have Prophesyed in his nam, cast
out devils, ear bred, and drank Wyn in his presens, and that he has tauht in
their streets, saying Lord, Lord, yet must they now receiv this answer from
him that is with in them, depart ye Workers of iniquity, I know you not: And
such as have bin at work in the vynyard from the first hour of the day, as
shall be found with an evil ey, murmuring against the good man of the house because
of his goodness to others who com in as it were at the last hour of the day,
shall be reptoved and sent away with their own, and the last shall be first, and
the first last, for tho many be caled, yet but fevv ar chosen.

The sun of ryteosnes is now com and coming in his glory with his Holy Angels,
and shall daily mor and mor appear, and is now upon his thron, and before him is
he gathering al nations, yea as a shepherd is he now divyding, and making a
separation, betwixt the sheep and the goats, and al who have not fed, clothed,
risited, pityed, and refreshed him in his despised, oppresed, spoiled, robed,
Imprisoned, Cruely Murdered, and massacred Innocent, harmles, littel on's; must
now, and daily mor and mor shall receiv this sentens depart from me ye cursed
into everlasting fyr prepared for the Devil, and his angels; And if such who
have not sed him in them (to wit, his peepel) when hungry, nor gav them drink
when thirsty, nor clothed them when naked, and as strangers, nor visited them
when sik, and in prison, must receiv such a dredful sentens, o then what must
be the portion, and sentens of such (in thee o Christendom) who have spoiled
them of their outvvard enjoyments, oppresed their familys, cast their bodies
into prisons, nasty filthy, and dirty hols, and dungeons, cruelly using, and
torturing them, by wraks and other cruel torturing instruments, secretly and
openly murdering and sheding their dear, and pretios blood; For all which with
a numberles number of other hy cryms and abomnations which have bin and still ar
committed in thee o Christendom, their most tender father even the the Lord God
omnipotent is now com and entering into Judgment with thee, and caling thee to
an account, and wrath and vengeans to the uttermost, even the bottom, and
dregs of the cup of his most just wrath, dredful indignation, Plagu's, and
vengeans is now seizing upon all the workers of iniquity both great, and small
in thee; the Reapers ar now gathering the tars, and bynding them in bundels for
the fyr. The sain Jesus who was received by a cloud up into heven out of the
sit of his discipels is now com, and coming in the clouds of heven, in his holy
ons, whom every ey (in mesur) does, and daily mor, and mor shall see, yea even
they who have, and still do piers him in themselves, and in his dear tender
innocent saints and holy on's, and all the tongu's, and Kindreds of the Earth
shall daily mor, and mor mourn because of him, and he vvil now render to every
on, great and small, hy and lovv, rich and poor, bond and free, mal and femal,
according to their works without respect of persons, to them who ar
contentios, and obey not the motions of the lyt and spirit of gras in them, but
obey unryteosnes, indignation, wrath and tribulation on every soul of Man-kynd
that does evil, the wrath of God is now revealed and revealing from heven (in
and throuh his Peepel) against al unryteosnes of men: the Lord even the Lord
himself is now descended from heven with a shout, the voys of the-arch angel
is heard, the trumpet of God is sounded, and sounding, and the ded in Christ ar
in mesur risen, and shall daily mor, and mor arys, in, throuh, and over al, yea
he is even com and coming as a thief in the nyt, and although Peace, Settelmen, and
safty has bin looked for, and expected, yet even now, sudden and unvoydabel
destruction is com and coming over all the workers of Iniquity, as travel upon a
woman with child and they cannot escap. The Lord Jesus Christ the great
shepherd, and Bishop of the soul is com, and coming, and into him must the
gathering of the Peepel be: The Man of sin is now revealed, and revealing even
the Son of perdition, and he that has, does, and yet for avery littel season
will let, is (in mesur already) and daily mor, and mor shall be taken out of the
way, even that cursed spirit, and Power, the seed of the old Serpent, which in
thee O Christendom has taken rooting, and grown up into a mystery of iniquity,
even a strong man of sin armed with the dragons, or military Power, in thy
wariors, Rulers, teachers and Peepel, which has rendered thee to be the Dragon,
Beast, falls Profet, great whor and mother of harlots, and abominations of the
Earth, and thy Peepel to be the waters on which the whor sits, and the sea out
of which the beast aros, according as it was revealed, and declared in and by
John the servant of the Lord, recorded in the book of his Prophesy, which
spirit, Power, mystery of iniquity, and Man of Sin, the Lord (in mesur already)
has and daily now, mor and mor shall, consum with the spirit of his mouth, and
by the brytnes of his coming in his peepel utterly destroy: The Prophesy of
Enoch the seventh from Adam is now (in mesur) fulfiled, and dayyl mor, and mor
fulfiling, for behold the Lord, is now (in mesur) com, and shall daily mor, and
mor appear in ten thousands of his saints, and (in mesur) already has, and
daily mor, and mor shall execut Judgment upon al, and convins al, of al their
ungodly deeds which they have committed, and of all the hard speeches, cruel
dealings, and unmerciful, and bloody, Kilings, and murderings, which ungodly
siners have spoken, and don against, and upon him, spiritually in his holy,
innocent, and harmles Peepel, who ar the spiritual body, vvherof he in them is
the head even the true imag, glory, and fulness of him, who created, fileth, and
upholdeth al things, visibel, and invisibel, by the eternal word of his Pur
Power, who was before al things, and is, and is to com the Alpha and O Mega,
the beginining and the end of all the works of God, the first, and the last,
even the lion of the tryb of Judah, the root and offpring of David, that has
the seven spirits of God, the key of David, and of the bottomless Pit also, that
opens so as non can shut, and shuteth so as non can open, the lamb standing
in the midst of the Thron and of the four beasts, and elders, as slain, who
has prevailed to open the book, sealed with seven seals, and has taken the
book out of the Ryt hand of him that siteth on the thron, and has opene well ny
all the seals in their order, which neither the learned or unlearned in thy
hevens, nor in thy Earth, nor under thy Earth o Christendom, were abel, or found
worthy to open, loos, or look there on, four of which seals comprehend the
appearans of that lamb of God manifest in the flesh, conceived, and born of the
virgin Mary, throuh the oversha^owing of the Pur Power and spirit from on hy,
who in his holy, harmles, undefyled, innocent, and Pur conversation, as on a
whyt horse, went forth conquering, and to conquer, and the taking plas of the
seed of the Serpent, that cursed spirit of apostasy, and faling away, with its
growth and fulness, in the Dragon's, Beast's, and falls Prophets Power and spirit
in thee O Christendom, til he becam the lamb spiritualy slain in thee, who art
now become spiritual Sodom, and Egypt, signified, by the Red, Blak, and Pal
horses: And the three last Seals, Trumpets, and Vyals, comprehend his second
appearans in his Peepel without sin unto salvation, and in and throuh the
britnes of his coming in them, revealing, consuming, and utterly destroying the
Man of sin, and bringing in, and establishing his own Eternal pur, life, and
everlasting ryteosnes in Man kind, and them in it, which is the spiritual body,
which with the whole creation is God manifest in the flesh, the visibel or
sensibel part whereof, to wit, of the whole creation, is the natural body of the
Lord, the Body of Christ, the flesh whereof is given for the life of the world,
which al who truly discern, eat, and drink thereof in remembrans of him, abiding
in that which gives, and preserves in, the true discerning, but such as go
from that, eat and drink thereof in their own time and wills to the satisfaction
of the Carnal and Inordinat desyrs of the flesh, and the mind, and heerby
weakness, siknes, and death takes hold on many, to the grieving wounding, and
some tyms to the destruction of their beings both in the natural and Spiritual
body, so that to and in such, the tabel of the Lord becoms, a snar, a gin, and
a trap, not eating and drinking in remembrans of Christ, not the Communion of
the body and blood of the Lord; not the bred and cup of blesing; but a curs,
even the tabel of devils, not the chearing, and refreshing of God, and man, but
the norishing of the Brambel nature, whose nature and work is to consum devour*
and destroy: its the poor and needy, the hungry and thirsty soul, which the
Lord fills, and satisfyeth with good things, even with his blesing, both to the
outward, and Inward man, but the Rich and the full, he sends emty away, even
with a curs.

And although the Kingdom, the Power of God, has, and still does suffer vyolens,
both in the natural, and spiritual body, yet so it ouht not to be, but al both
in the natural, and Spiritual body, ouht to be subject to the motions of the
eternal quickening Power, to rest, and may in it, in all things, without
offering fors or vyolens thereunto; which is Christ, the Lord that quikening
Spirit in mal, and femal, not only in mankind but to and in every cretur, and
therefore the charg was, and still is unto the dauhters of Jerusalem, that they
stir not up or awak the beloved til he pleas, which is the daily Cross of Christ
to the carnal mind, but the lyt, sweet, Pleasant, and easy yaok and burden of
Christ to the spiritual mind, in which true pur rest, and peace to the soul, is
eternaly to be found, and as in the free pur motion of his eternal pur Power,
al coms to dwell, and abyd, so the Pur peasabel, and Pleasant fruits of
ryteosnes, and holiness coms to be brouht forth in their proper tym, and season,
and in their pur luster glory, and Beauty, and the wonderful, and mysterios
ways of the serpent on the rok, the eagel in the air, and the ship in the midst
of the sea and the way of the man with the maid, (to wit the mysterys both of
iniquity and godlynes) coms to be truly known and comprehended, and the
creation con forted, as concerning that misery, toil, and curs, under with it
groans in the general, and in the particular, by reason of the ground which the
Lord has cursed: And the woman saved in chyld-bearning, both ma;l, and femal;
The spous the bryd, the tambs wife, the Kings dauhter, who is al glorios within,
with whose Pur beauty, and comlynes, the Kings heart is ravished, and he held in
the gallery who is greater then Solomon, yea her feet ar beautiful with shoe,
which he is now casting over Edom the strong city, which is Efau, in which the
Wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the Leopard ly down with the kid (among the
goats) they shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain says the Lord,
wherefore arys my lov, my fair on, and com away, the winter as to thee is
neerhand past, the stormy Rayn, and showers near hand over, and gone, the sweet
smeling, tender flowers appear in, throuh, and abov the Earth, the tym of the
singing of the birds is in mesur com, the voys of the turtel is heard in our
Land, the figtree puteth forth her green figs, and the vyns with the dear
tender graps, giy a goodly smell wherefore arys my lov, my fair o, and com away.

In that Spirit which offers fors or vyolens to the Power of God, is the
Barren womb that never says it is enuf, the adulterer, and the Adulteres,
which hunts for the pretios life, even the Spirit of sorcery and witchcraft,
Balaams Spirit, the witch of Endor which Israel ouht not to suffer to live: I
speak not of destroying the life of the eretur, but that astop and death may be
brouht over that Spirit in Mal^ and femal, which offers fors, and vyclens to
the Power of God, in this is the Spirit of Saul, that is not wiling to wait the
Lords leisur, which at both on in the ground; as well that which is not wiling
to wayt, as that which offers fors and vyolens to get an answer, for rebelion
is as the sin of witchcraft in this also is the ground of the false, and lying
Spirit of Prophesy, who failing in their work of offering fors and vyolens to
the Power of God, run in there own wills, uttering forth the devinations and
Imaginations, of their own brains, as also that Spirit, which runeth forth
hastily, and rashly to Judge, and censur others, vvhos words or works may
possibly be brouht forth in the motion of the Power of God, tho throuh much
weakness, such do not only offer fors, and vyolens to the Power of God in
themselves, but griev, oppres, and quench it in others, and hens it coms to pa^
somtyms, that the bruised Reed is broken, and the smoking Flax quenched, and
the Appel of Gods Ey touched, and the littel on offended: And from this root
springs the fearful, and unbeleeving Spirk also, which is fearful and
unwiling to mov or go, when the true Powertroly movs, and draws, which are al to
be shut out of the Holy City among the Dogs: Which offering fors or vyolens to
the Power of God in mal or fen al, is the reaching forth the hand to lay hold
on and eat of the forbiden tree, and fruit thereof, by which fin, and
transgression entered, and enters. The door or way by which all the wo's,
miserys, plagu's, madness, folly, and curses, not only on Man-kynd, but on the
whole body of the creation, past, present and to com, entered, and enters.

And he has in mesur opened, sounded, and poured forth the sixth seal,

and every bond man, and every free man, shall say to the Roks, and mountains fall
on us and hid us from the presens of him that siteth on the thron, and from the
wrath of the lamb, for the great day of his wrath is com, and non shall be abel

in her mouth: The four Angels bound in the great River Euphrates, ar near hand
loosing which are prepared for an hour a day, a month and a year, to slay the
third part of men. The Spirit of life from God is entered into the slain
witneses, and they are in mesur standing on their own feet in England, Scotland,
and Yrland, and the dominions, and territorys thereunto belonging, and great
fear has seized, and is seizing on them that see them, and they are ascending

Patient, constant, faithful, and lamb lyk sufferings, which ar the spirit
water, and blood of the lamb, with which they over com, and stand in Pur
Dominion over al their enemies, both in them, and without them: the great Earth

Great Babylon is now com into Remembrans before God; the gre at City is now
divyded into three parts, viz Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists in the Roman

beyond the other, yet being gone from the mesur of the Spirit of gras in them
which drew them, forth (in mesur) to seperat in form, life, and practis from the

unavoydably receiv of her Plagu's: which great City is in mesur falen and
faling, and as she has don must now be don unto her, yea doubel according to

that Spirit in Man which has kiled with the sword, must now be kiled by the

Sodom and Egypt be thrown down as agreat Milston into the Sea, and be found no

Saints, but of all that have bin slain upon the Earth: This Generation shall not

plas in them, and throuh them has spread it self, throuh, and over the whole

From this cursed root of bitterness has sprang up that abominabel Spirit of

falls profet, in thy military, civil, and Ecclesiastical Power (so caled) and
thy peepel unstabel as water, even the great raging sea, which cannot rest
foaming out its own sham, casting up Myr and dirt, out of which the skarlet
colored beast aros, who Power, seat and great authority, was given him, (and is
still up held) by the great red dragon, to wit the military power which has
rendered thee to be an Akeldama, even a field of blood, oppresion and cruelty,
full of hye cryms, and abominations, even Spiritual Sodom and Egypt, in which
the Lord lies crucified.

And now there is no way of restoration from this faling away, and cursed
apostasy from the true Christian Spirit, faith and life, and to know redemtion
from sin death, and from under the law, sting, curs, and power there of either to
the general or any particular, but by returning the Ey, and ear of the mind, to
that which is pur eternal, and Immortal of God in the inward parts, even the
mesur of the true lyt, and Spirit of the free gras of God, in the general, and
in every Particular, from which every on in the general, and in the particular,
in thee has erred, and gone astray, and as every on either in the general or
particular, coms to giv ear to the motions cries, and groans of the oppresed pur
seed of God in them they will com to see him, whom they have pierced and as that
which does burden, oppres, and keep the pur seed of God in bondag, coms to be
removed, mortifyed, and subdued, Either in the general or in the particular, so
his pur Power, Spirit, life, and presens will be felt working salvation, and
redemtion in the Earth, and be known by the Judgments which he executes in the
earth, in the general, and in the particular, throuh which ryteos Judgments in
the Inward parts, salvation and true redemtion coms to be known, and vvitnesed.

So that eternal Judgment in the inward parts being brouht forth into victory,
at last he coms to arys and rein, in pur Power, life and Dominion overal, vvhos
ryt it is, both in the general, and in every particular, even he who leads al
who ar led by him, in the pur pleasant and everlasting path of pur lyt, lov,
life, ryteosnes, everlasting joy, and happynes, even forevermor.

A door of hop is left open for you in the valley of Achor, and as the just and
ryteos Judgments of the Lord ^om there to be executed on the troubler of Israel,
(in the inward parts) with his vvedg of gold, babylonish Garment and Silver,
with his seed, and all that he has; so an entrans vvil be administered, in and
throuh Christ the lyt, way, and eternal door, by which al who enter in, have
salvation, and com to be reconcyled unto God, and saved from wrath which is
to com.

This is the Zoar into which al who flee, ar saf from the devouring fyr, which
from the Lord is now com, and coming upon Spiritual Sodom in thee: This is the
Ark of the new (yet most old) and everlasting covenant, into which al who
make speed, and get entrans, shall escap the great delug, and overflovving flood
which God is now bringing in upon the world of the ungodly: this is the
cloud, and Pillar of fyr in man, which al who faithfully, and constantly
follovv, ar safly led throuh the wilderness, of temtations, fears and snars,
which God is now rayning down upon the workers of Iniquity: This is the
strong towr, in which al who ar found, ar saf from the horribel tempest,
which is now com, and coming upon the Proud and all that do wickedly in thee: O
Christendom. This is the litel sanctuary in which all that hyd, themselves, the
blast of the teribel ons against them, shall be but a a storm against a wall:
This is the holy Mountain, whose Inhabitants the oppreser or destroyer, cannot
touch or hurt: This is the city of most sur refug, whose walls, and bulwarks ar
salvation, and the gats thereof prays, into which nothing can enter that
defyleth, or works abomination, tho the gats thereof stand open continually,
whose inhabitants can and do truly say, tho the earth be removed yet we will not
fear, tho the mountains be hurled into the midst of the sea, yet will we not be
dismayed, tho the waters thereof roar, and be troubled, and the mountains shak
and fall with the sweling thereof; for there is a River the streams whereof make
glad the city of God; the holy plas of the tabernakel of the most by: the
living God is in the midst of her, she cannot be moved: God shall help her, and
that Ryt early.

Wherefore I say unto al, and it is the counsel of the Lord God to them in the
bowels of pur, and tender lov, to his own oppresed, burdened, and slain seed in
thee o^ Christendom, and in every particular; make have make have do not stay nor
linger, but speedyly turn in hither, least the storm, the dredful storm of the
most Just, and ryteos vengeans, and Jndignation of God, which remains at hand
to be poured forth, overtak you, and ye perish in the sam, for all who ar found
ering from, and walking contrary to the mesur of the Spirit of the gras of God
in them will be found partaking with Babylon in her sins and must receiv of her
plagu's: Your strength is to stand still, your work is to do nothing, your
wisdom is to become fools, and patiently to wait to feel him to arys in you, and
bring salvation, and work al your works in you, and for you for ever mor; which
al who com truly to experiens, do enter into his rest, which is pur, and
eternal, and com to ceas from their own works as God did from his.

On thing mor I may not omit, that so the Lord, and his servant may be clear of
the blood of al man-kynd, which was forseen and declared by the Lord of life,
and Prins of pur peace in the days of his flesh, to wit, that there should com
many in his nam, and say, that they are Christ, and deceiv many, showing great
syns, and wonders in so much, that if it were possibel, they should deceiv the
very elect.

The day is now com, and coming in which it shall be fulfiled; The ground of the
coming and appearans of such, has bin for some tym laid and working in
thousands, who go under the nam of fift-Monarchy Peepel, with many other; who
from an imagnation of their own brayns, gathered from the letter of the
scripturs, expect, and look for the appearans, and coming of Christ, in that
sam body of flesh, in which he appeared, lived and suffered death upon a cross
without the gats of Jerusalem, out of the material clouds, and visibel hevens,
and gather peopel unto him, as an outward glorios king, or great monarch and by
carnal weapons, with an arm of flesh, to overturn, kill, and destroy out wardly,
the persons of such as oppos him and them, and rein a thousand years.

Wherefore, when any such do appear, go not after them, nether be ye deceived by
them for destruction and misery ar in their path, and the way of true pur, and
everlasting peace they know not, and both them and al others may know, that the
appearans, and coming of Christ, and seting up of his Kingdom, which is
pureternal, and everlasting, is in the lyt, or as lytning, which comes out of
the east, and shyneth into the west, as himself testified, and that his Kingdom
is within and coms not by observation.

But as for the treading of the Wyn pres of the fires wrath of God al myty, it
is to be trodden without the holy city, and the appearans, The seting up of
Christ's Kingdom in the generaelis effected in the sam manner as in evch
particular soul.
coming and seting up of the Kingdom of Christ, is the sam in the general as in
every particular, to wit, not by outward myt, and carnal fors, and Power,
destroying men's lyvs, but by the sword of his mouth which is quik and Powerful
in the Inward parts, to discovet, consum and root out the ground of al
unryteosnes in men: and throuh their holy conversations, and faithful testimony
to, and their innocent, and lamblyk sufferings for that mesur, or Power of
truth into which themselves ar brouht they do^overcom, bring down, and in pur
life, and dominion trampel upon the contrary Spirit in them selves, and in
others, both in the particular, and in the general.

And concerning England, Scotland and Yrland, with the dominions, and
territorys thereunto belonging, this I further say, that the seventh seal,
trumpet, and vyal is in mesur opened, sounded and poured forth intot he air
which shall quyt stop the breath of the dragon's beasts and falls Profet's Power,
and Spirit in them, and as to them, tym shall be no mor as such.

Now is the expeling of al typs, figurs, clouds and shadows, Carnal ordinanses,
dispensations, declarations and administrations, which have bin over, yet
poynting at, the most true, eternal and excelent lyt, life, glory and substans,
and the opening of al dark sayings, speeches, and parabels upon the sweet
Melodios harp of David, and the tangue which is as the Pen of a Ready writer and
the finishing of the mystery of God.

Wherefore rejoys, O thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wyn, for great is
the holy on in the midst of thee; the enemies Rok is not lyk unto thy Rok, even
themselves being judges; there is no God lyk unto thy God, who rydeth upon the
hevens for thy help, and in his excelency on the skys, the eternal God is thy
refug, and underneath ar the everlasting arms, and he shall thrust out the enemy
from before thee, and shall say destroy them; and thou, the true Israel of God,
the Nobel Plant, the Royal seed, the holy nation, shall dwell safly as in
unwaled villages, upon a land of corn and Wyn; thy heavens do, and daily mor
and mor shall, drop down the sweet, living, and eternally refreshing dew; happy
art thou O seed of the God of Jacob, there is non among all the familys of the
Earth, lyk unto thee O Peepel saved by the Lord, who is the shield of thy help,
and the sword of thy excelency, thy enemies ar, and daily mor and mor shall be
found liars unto thee, and thou (in mesur) do and daily mor and mor shall,
tread upon their hy plases.

For thus says the Lord, even the Lord thy God, which pleads the cause of his
Peepel, behold I will now tak out of thy hand the cup of trembling, even the
dregs of the cup of my fury, thou shall no mor drink it again, but I will now
put it into the hands of them that afflict thee, who have faid unto thy soul bow
down that we may go over, and thou have laid thy body as the ground and as the
street to them that went over.

The day is com which shall shak open al thy prison doors, for the first born of
the Egyptians is near hand slain, and the great sea divyding; and upon the sea
of glass mingled with fyr must thou yet stand, but al who witness true victory
over al in their own particular shall stand thereon in pur Power life and
Dominion, with the harps of God in their hands, singing the sweet, Melodios,
glorios, triumphant and victorios song of Moses the servant of the Lord, and
the song of the lamb; for the Lord now takes plesur in his Peepel, and will
mor, and mor beautify the meek with his salvations, and his saints shall be
joyful in glory, singing aloud upon their beds, having the hy Praises of God in
their mouths, and a two edged sword in their hands, with which they (in mesur)
already have, and daily mor and mor shall e^ecut vengeans upon the heathen, and
Punishments upon the Peepel, bynding Kings in chayns and nobels in fetters of
Iron, and execut upon them the judgments written, this honor have all the saints
Prays, Prays, Prays ye the Lord God of life, lov, Pur Power, Dominion, and
faithfulness, in throuh, and overal for ever mor. Amen.

I am your Brother and companion in tribulation, and in the Kingdom, and
Patiens of Jesus. JOHN.
