News from the River of Thames.
To a Pleasant New Tune.
^ THE Winter is exceeding cold, poor People find it so; I think there is

^ neither young nor old, that e're the like did know: The famous Ri-ver

^ of the Thames, is now a Highway made; And there is Booths and

^ Shops al-so, set up of ev'-ry Trade.

Now Lovers with their Sweet-hearts go,
Unto the Frozen Fair,
Some Silver Presents to bestow;
On some, fine Chyna Ware.
Roast Beef is likewise Plentiful;
And some Drink Brandy so,
That how to speak a Word of sense
By no means they do know.
Now from the Temple there is Built,
A pretty Street or Fair,
And there is laid out good store of Guilt,
In every sort of Ware.
Coaches running up and down
As if it were a Road:
But this, the Laboring Watermen,
Does greatly discommode.
The Goldsmiths Shops well custom'd are,
And Pewterers also;
Such an Icey-Frozen-Fayr
The World did never know.
There Is seeming Boats composed by Art,
That slide on with a sail;
And those that such Contrivance find,
It does them much Avail.
Bull-Bayting, and Bear-Bayting too,
Upon the Thames has been;
The like before I tell to you
By no man e're was seen:
There Is Nine-Pins Played, and Pigin-holes,
And many sports beside:
There scarcely any VVaterman
Can tell how runs the Tide.
The Bonny Watermen that used
To cry, Where shall I Land ye?
With some Old Curtains make a Booth,
And there sell Ale and Brandy.
There Is Fidling, and there is Dancing too;
The like was never before;
A man can very hardly know
The Water from the Shore.
Slideing in Scates there you may see,
To all men's Admiration,
And England almost seems to be
Like to another Nation.
All things Topsie Turvy turned,
As may be well Observed;
And many Poor that well have Lived,
Half Famish't are, and Starved.
Oh! That the Rich consider would
The Poor now in distress,
And call to mind how that ye should
Not be so Pittyless.
In God's good Time I hope we shall
An alteration find;
Thus I do wish, God bless you all
That bear an Honest Mind.
God Prosper long our Sovereign KING
And happy let Him be;
That all from Royal Race do Spring
Live in Prosperity.
Let Heavenly Power Protect YORK still,
And keep him from his Foes;
Let them be crossed in their Will
That no Allegiance knows.
