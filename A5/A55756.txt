A great Sea Fight which was fought lately upon the Coast of Dunkirke, between
the Babylonians and the Dunkirkers.

As also the relation of the reason why the Babylonians came so near this way,
which was to invade the Kingdom of England, how they were shipwrackt on the
Coasts of Egypt, and overthrown in Fight by the Dunkirkers.

At the recital of which, the Sultan of Babylon struck the messenger of this
ill news, and afterward burned his Palace, wherein he and others perished.

IT is not unknown unto all our Nation how often our God has delivered us
even from the jaws of Death, as heretofore from the Powder plot, and the
Spanish Invasion, so now also from the Sultan of Babylon, whose greatest pride
would be to make our CHRIST give place to idolatrous Mahomet; I mean to change
our Religion which is now extant among us, thinking by force to overthrow the
All-seeing and all-creating God; and thus it lately happened.

The great Sultan of Babylon, hearing of this difference which lately happened
between us and our neighbors the Scots, thinks by policy and unawares to
surprise this Land, and make himself the King of that sweet and plenteous
Western Island, sends for the chief Governors of his Country, and thus he
bespake them.

Most loyal Governors, for I have no other occasion to give a worse Title
unto you, by reason I never found you any way disloyal unto me. The occasion
that we have sent for you at this time is, to give you intelligence of what we
would have to be done, which are these things which follow.

First, Bashaw Rackby, I make you our chief General. of our royal Navy, which
I would have with all speed as possibly you can to be rigged and hoisted
toward England, for I hunger and thirst for that little Island, which flows
with milk and honey; make all speed as possibly you now can, for I protest my
thoughts will never rest till I shall hear some good news from you concerning
this Voyage.

Secondly, I desire Bashaw Ofti, our near Cousin to undertake that great
charge, which rested on thy shoulders before.

Thirdly, I request our Master of Malta to settle the valiant Bernardo in his
room, and to accompany Bashaw Rackby, our chief General in these employments.
Thus he made his mind known, but he had no sooner ended his speech, but
Bashaw Rackby made him this reply.

My most Sovereign Lord, I am proud that you will honor meso far as to put
me into such a noble service, for such honorable employment best befits my
nature to accomplish, and either I will bring England in subjection, or else I
will spend the dearest blood I have in the attempt, and thus much I will
promise, either to accomplish what you desire, or else never to see your face
again.

I am glad, (replied the Sultan) to see that you are so forward to go when I
shall desire, and my propheticke heart divines, that sure your journey will be
prosperous. And so they took their leaves, and departed to their Ships, and
made every thing ready for their departure, the next morning being come they
boorded their Ships, and hoised up sails, and the winds blew very fitly for
England, there was such a serene calm upon the seas, that the sailer had no
need to use the oars, but they lie sleeping upon the deckes, which mildness
of the Seas made the foolhardy Babylonians, to think that God was surely on
their side, praising their great Prophet Mahomet in songs and hymns, and such
like merry glee; nay, I persuade my self, they thought the Deed they went
about to be meritorious; but they perceived their folly in an instant, for upon
a sudden, the Winds began to turn and beat them back very vehemently, the
Skies were mantled with clouds, and they never expected to see another day,
insomuch that they cast all their riches into the Seas, never thinking to
survive to enjoy any thing, at last the Winds ceased, and the clouds began to
cast themselves in heaps to give way to the light, insomuch that they
perceived themselves to be cast upon the Egyptian shore: well, there they sold
some part of their jewels, which were left them, for those necessaries, which
were fitting for their journey, and now although they perceived the angry
Heavens to repel them, and were unwilling of their journey, yet they would
show themselves to be obstinately impudent, and forwards they, came for England
with all might and main: but they had not gone above the space of twenty
leagues, when there was another accident which befell them, as bad, or rather
worse than the first; and thus it hapened:

As their proud Ships came dancing and capering upon the foaming waves, they
perceived a Navy of Ships from far, as great in number, or greater than theirs;
well, in an instant, they came within ken, that they knew one another, and the
Babylonians perceived them to be of the Dunkirks, which were as it were
Outlawes, and lived by robbing upon the Seas. They no sooner came together, but
the Dunkirks let fly at them, and wished them to yield, the proud Bashaw Rackby
out of the haughtiness of his stomach told them, That they should win it and
wear it, for he would not yield upon such easy terms. Well, to it they went,
incontinently there began a great sea fight between them, Cannons were roaring,
and bullets were flying, and every man there stood in danger of dying: at last,
the Fight grew so hot, that it was impossible to last long, it was so
dangerous, for Death seated himself upon the hatches, coloring the Seas with
a bloody dye, and to make short of our story, the Dunkirks had the better of
it, for the Babylonians and all their Ships but one were buried in the Sea;
there might you have seen broken plankes to swim upon the top of the water, and
shipwrackt goods in abundance; but now you must understand, that this Ship
which escaped gained its freedom by flight, and posted with all speed toward
the Country of Babylon, and so to the Soldans Court, where when they came, one
Silvinus Muckshaw a Captain undertook to tell the news first, which when he
came, and the Sultan understood the loss of his Worthies, and his goods, he
struck the Captain such a blow under the ear, that he never rose again. But his
passion so much prevailed over him that he knew not what he did, for he fell
stark mad upon an instant, and much ado they had to hinder him for working
mischief upon himself and others; yet at length what by persuasions and force
they got him to his chamber, and so to bed; but now when he perceived himself
to be restrained from doing open mischief, he began to plot with himself how
he might end his own miserable days, also ending others with him, for he
desired company with him, and thus he acted it; It was when the Sun had forsook
the Horoscope, and Luna had graced the Zenith with her lightsom favors, all
persons being at rest, and nothing waking of man, or bird, or beast, except the
doleful Nightingall, who kept her self awake against a Thorn, or the Owl,
whose greatest delight is in solitariness, and flying abroad in the
night-times; it was then, I say, that he arose, espying no body stirring, and
having a tapour burning at his beds head, that he took and fired the Palace
about his own ears and others, after he had locked the doors that none could
escape, but it would have made a flinty heart to dissolve into tears to hear
what piteous moan was made by men, women, and children, which were locked up
there, as also to see how the aspiring fire did ascend, throwing down such
stately buildings: there might you have seen brave Architectures tumbled topsie
turvy, and at last consumed to nothing. Thus Readers may you see and hear daily
how those do speed, who are setting themselves against our God, who is the
Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End.

FINIS.
