A True Relation of a Notorious Cheater one Robert Bullock, Lately done in
Oxford, to prevent the like.
To the tune of, And for my Offense I shall die, or, For the loss of my goods.
Oh fine Cheat.



COme listen all good people,
and here what I can tell,
My name is Robert Bullock,
at Che^tington I dwell,
For Rougery in Oxford,
all others I Will excel,
And for mine offense I did fly.
That famous ancient City,
I lately entered in,
To cheat them by the Dozens,
I thought it no great sin:
And to relate particulars,
I Will willingly begin.
And for, etc.
A Wife and a great Portion
I did pretend to have,
And thereupon I must
have all things fine and brave:
I did dissemble with them
much like a cheating knave,
And for, etc.
I took of a rich widow,
a house and shop so fair,
That workmen of all sorts
unto me did repair,
And for their best contrivance,
I left it to their care,
And for, etc.
Spoons and Plates, all Silver,
of a Goldsmith I procured,
And a great Silver tankard,
which Ban^ers book assured,
My yes and nays,
were not to be endured.
And for etc.
A Shute and a fair Cloak,
I am sure I had of one,
Whose name I have forgot;
no matter let it alone,
To me hereafter,
let them make their moan,
And for, etc.
A good man a rich Sadler,
for my custom courted me,
Both Pillion-cloth and Bridle,
were at my service free,
With Combs, for boots and shoos
I quickly did agree,
And for mine offense I did fly.




My wedding gloves I bought,
of honest T homas Bland,
My Brass and eke my Pewter
I had served me out of hand,
And all poor Prices Bodis^
were at my own command.
And for mine offense I did fly,
My empty rooms were furnished,
with all Upholdsterers ware,
Both Beds and all things else
I left to Thurstons care,
And when I pay my debts,
then he shall have his share,
And for, etc.
Bedsteds, and Tables,
and many a days work to,
I had of a Wooden Ioyner,
who for the same did sue
As most that I have cheated,
and now they have time to rue,
And for, etc.
I had of Cox the Matt man,
of several sorts, five Chairs,
And R^ggs of Bridewel keeper,
mixed with the finest hairs,
And blankets from a Wit^y man
who had rather lost his ears,
And for, etc.
I was a general merchant,
for Buttons I did trade,
I cheated brother Jennings,
and a pure Virgin Maid,
My carriage was so wary,
th^re's none could me upbraid,
And for, etc.
All sorts of several workmen,
that I in his employed,
I paid them all alike,
diss:ention to avoid:
If they no better master Masters have,
they will quickly be ststroy'd,
And for, etc.
There Is two that did escape,
from my intended plot,
That Is honest Roger Frye,
and Gardener the S^ot,
I am contented with it,
seeing it was their Lot,
And for, etc.
I gave each what the asked,
for their commodity,
A made what rrady moneys,
I could at Banbury,
And then with Edward Bartlet
for carriage did agree,
And for, etc.
I hired a good horse,
in Holly-well of one,
May add a great repentance
(unto his penance done)
That such a rogue and villain,
with his horse away is run,
And for, etc.
And when I came to London,
that noble and great City,
I cheated all my carriage;
it being not much pity
That all should loose by me,
so ends my Ditty.
And for mine offenses I did fly.
By one of Oxford.
