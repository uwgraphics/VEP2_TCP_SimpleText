THE PROLOGUE
Spoken by Mr. POWEL. at Oxford, July the Tenth. 1682. 3. Aug. 1682
BY a dissenting Playhouse frantic rage,
We the poor remnant of a ruined Stage,
Must call the very Storm that wrack't us kind,
Since we this safe, and pleasant harbor find:
So shipwrack't Passengers, if they espy
Any kind remnant of the Ship that is nigh,
Embrace with thanks the charitable Oar
That Fate prepared, and make toward the Shore.
Our tribe infected with the City fits,
Was setting up a Commonwealth of wits,
And still (to make the parallel more true)
Was falling out, and without reason too:
Moved by these broils, which rass'd us still more high,
We made at last a real Tragedy.
Old Relique's of the infection still we bear,
For each man here is turned Petitioner.
And to your kindness, for the double recruit
Of Wit and Fortune, makes his humble Suit.
Faith 'twas high time to leave the noisy Town,
When what scarce made a show was pulling down.
When Our gay Ribbons, and such useless things,
Were all condemned to make new Bible Strings.
Our short-Jump Canters stiffly have defied
All Rhymes, since David's good Burlesquers died;
Have all things else but State-lampoons decry'd.
Good Poems they like Holy Water fear,
Because there seems some kind of concord there.
Here Genuine peace does every breast inspire,
And to a general calmness all conspire.
Rebellion, which is there the only Prize
By which the canting, hot-brained Zealots rise,
In this fair Paradise dare's not show her face,
As if some flameing Cherub kept the place.
So when the Plague Our Climate did infest,
And with new-heats the late burnt Town posses't;
The fearful Steams (that lodged in the circling Air)
Kept out of sight, and durst not enter here.

FINIS.
