To the READER.
SInce our blessed Savior draws a Precedent for Prudence, from the unjust
deportment of a wicked Steward; and recommends to his followers the Subtilty of
Serpents, with a no less Emphasis than the Innocence of Doves; I trust (in
this Juncture when the Press groans to be delivered of the burden she
sustaines from their more seditious and profane Offspring, who desire to
foment War; and Christian Magistrates reckon their Subjects Disobedience in the
heaviest Item, they account for with God, in their solemn Humiliations;) I
shall not be the worse esteemed by men judicious and moderate, for taking some
choice Observations out of the Turkish Arcana, which garbelled and weighed
according to the true balance of the Sanctuary, may not impossibly mind those
at the Helm of Expedients more proper for Unity, than have yet been employed
among Christians: where though Christ be owned under the greatest demonstration
of Self-denial, yet Uncharitableness abounds, and less awful Obedience is
given to Gods Vicegerents, in Christian Commonwealths, than the Apostle Paul
did award to infidells. Nor does the Church, set in the Firmament of Regality
for the Luminary and direction of all Subjection due to our heavenly and
earthly Guides, keep to her proper Sphere, if, from a Medium between us and our
Maker, she becomes a stickler in things purely belonging to the Magistrate, our
Obedience, like that of the Catholics, must still stagger betwixt two
Supremes; It being impossible for the best or worst of Governors to be longer
in quiet, than she is pleased to permit them: And this apprehended by some
(better fitted and resolved for the discovery of Errors, than able or willing
to mend them) they conclude, all the mischiefs arising through the loud
Fulminations, the spirit of Contention has, or may have, darted out of the
Pulpit, flow from the Riches and Splendor of the Clergy, that upon a more
serious account may be laid to the abuse and ill-admiration of their Office and
Power, which duly regulated, is the wholsomest Flower in the Crown of
Government: it out-reaching the kenn of example to find a State happy, where
the Priesthood is exposed to the Peoples contempt, or Religion suffered to be
weighed at the common Beam; which must needs happen, where their Maintenance is
scandallous, and their Persons despicable, or not vigorously protected by the
hand of Authority; to whom they do, or at least might, bring Obedience,
without putting it to the trouble of reward or punishment. Nor would the Laity
so much grumble at the payment of Tithes, were they wise enough to weigh the
great advantage they have through the Churches dependence on their welfare,
which would be quite lost, did their maintenance drop out of the immediate hand
of the Prince, as it does among the Turks; who are too well read in Policy, to
break or dismember so useful an Engine, because it may or might, for want of
Circumspection, have bruised the fingers of those it ought to preserve. But if
this points at any prejudice in Church or State, I am resolved to remain no
obstinate Heretic, but to cast it at the feet of the same Authority,
Providence has set me under, and for whose sake I first took it up. And this I
hope will satisfy the wise Reader; but for Critical Fools, the ordinary sort
of Book-wormes, who, like Iron moles, discolor the sense and obliterate the
natural meaning of Authors, by their spurious and tart Censures; esteeming
nothing fit to pass current, that has not descended from their Ancestors,
whose foulest blots they paint over with fairer Glosses, than they can find
color for in the general Ignorance (some few Pens excepted) that did then
bleer the understandings of Subjects, extending in the mean time the no less
innocent, if not more useful modern endeavors upon the cruel rack of a
severe Scrutiny, till some pretext is found for to ground detraction upon:
This, I say, cannot discourage me from prosecuting what Conscience informs me
may advance Settlement, who have long been taught, that the way lies to the
Paradise of Peace, through the Purgatory of Censure, which all must expect to
find their Sails filled with, that steer contrary to the current of
Antiquity, imagined, only by idle Dunces, to have pinned the Basket: For since
this age has the use of their Plat-formes, and the same Tools, it lies not in
my Cap to apprehend, why it may not operate as well and wisely. To conclude,
such as have, or do hereafter modestly prosecute a farther revelation of
Knowledge, ought not to be discouraged, or unwillingly employ their Talents, as
many do that come betrayed to the Press, or led more by Friends Importunity,
than their own Genius: For though their Contemporaries serve them as the Jews
did the Prophets, yet when Death has laid them out of the reach of Envy and
personal Contempt, Posterity shall not only commiserate the Cruelty of that
neglect they lay under in their lifetime, but build Monuments to their
Immortal Fame.

THE TURKISH POLICY: OR, OBSERVATIONS UPON THE Government of the TURKS.
NNot to ascend the highest step of the Turkish Pedigree, (whose primitive
Actions, no less then those of the Goths, lie buried in the rubbish, their
huge Vastation have formerly made through the Eastern Empire, and since in
that of the West, upon the score of whose eternal reproach, they keep their
Royal Port in the Imperial City:) I shall only observe the prudent Deportment
of Mahumet (owned by all for their Founder) without taking more notice of his,
or their extraction, then what may serve to illustrate the following Dicourse,
projected rather to delineate the wise Track he has chalked out to his
successors, and what exact followers they have been of it (which few have done)
then the Deeds themselves, usually found scored at the end of every street.
Though, I believe, with great Partiality, and many Omissions, in relation to
the Shame and Terror they have brought upon Christendom through the division
of whose Princes they have attained this grandeur) the Fate of their
Achievements, who want Pens of their own to register their Stories: In which
this Emparour, no less then his successors, have been still defective: Yet he
that considers what has followed, cannot take it for an hyperbole, to say, the
main disference between Alexander, Caesar, and Mahumet consists in a Feather,
or the Quill of a Goose.

2. He had the happiness to set up under a most auspicious juncture; the
greatest Politicians then extant, being more employed in moulding an
Ecclesiastical Monarchy, and mending the Rents, the Schismatics of those
times had made in the Church, then in improving any temporal Power, or raising
banks, that might stop such an inundation, as so great a Snow-ball was likely
to cause upon the face of that Earth, where ever it came to refund.

3. His Followers were owners of no vaster Understandings, then might render
them pliable to Labor and Discipline: Who being of a brutish and wild
employment, did not only undergo the hardship of War, but were ready to
yield all awful Obedience to such marks of Worship, or religions Observations,
as he was pleased to impresse upon their yetunsuborned imaginations: Not so
easily obtained from acuter heads, who are apt to pretend a sufficiency in
determining the truth or falsehood of that, Authority has allotted for an
unquestioned Creed: The more to be avoided by all new Legislators, because
known so pernicions to established Commonwealths and Monarchies, as the
promoters of Sedition, are seldom found to take horse at any other block, then
what they perceive the People aptest to stumble at, in relation to Gods
Worship. No Colony having been observed for to dilate it self, that held not
at least so long constant to one Profession in Religion, till Time and Success
had estated them in a power able to resist any Enemy; by nothing easier brought
about, then a confident Report of some Miracle, which once riveted into the
Opinion of the People; by Custom and Education, cannot after be removed,
without the hazard of all. This made him profess a daily Commerce with Angels,
and pretend, the terrible Fits incident to his Disease, as holy ecstasies, in
which God did mind him of the way and means, how to lead his People. And
according to this Pattern, a Law was founded, so suitable to the highest Taste
of humane Sensuality, and obvious to a carnal apprehension, that it was
swallowed by this Rabble for the undoubted and pure Will of God, and he looked
upon for his most holy Prophet. To the advancement of which Belief their
Ignorance did mainly contribute, found by experience, the strongest assertor of
what she confidently believes, though in it self never so improbable. And
after some farther commerce had thoroughly estated their Consciences in this
persuasion, they grew zealous, that is, affectionate, and desirous to propagate
where ever they came, such opinions as their Governors had contracted them to,
out of no higher sanctity at first, then to keep them entire and chaste in their
worldly obedience.

4. Neither were the Proselites of this new Prophet checked, in the
earnestness of their pursuit after Empire, by the confluence of contrary
Accidents, and the number of rubbs the unsteady hand of so contingent a War,
could not choose but cast daily in their way; but the more enflamed, as taking
them rather for incitements to further cruelties toward others, then any stop
to the unjust encroachments they made upon the Principalities of their
Neighbors; looked upon by them as Enemies to God, and so, like the Canaanites,
fit only to be eradicated, for the better ease and advantage of themselves. Or
if any cross event was apprehended relating to them, they put it off as if it
only concerned their Remissness in the intended Work of the Lord, which was
to spoil others, and enrich themselves. This abates the wonder of their
Victories, who have the Art to draw encouragement from the best or worst of
successes: For through the clashing of these contrary events, Mahumet kindled
such a blind zeal amongst their overheated Ignorance, as it consumed all
before them, without the least consideration had of things Sacred or Profane.

5. And to preserve this child of his Ambition, from being stifled in the
swaddling clothes, through an overlaying of Neighbors (who were called in
prudence to the crushing of such designs, had they not been rendered deaf by
the janglings between the Greek and Latin Churches) he gathers the chiefest
ingredients of his Institutes out of the Gardens, both of the Jewish and
Christian Religion: Leaving his Sectarists in gross, to their more loose and
acceptable primitive Heatheuisme; inserting few Novelties, but what respected
his own person, which he does not style a God, though he arrogates to himself
a Supremacy over all his Prophets.

6. Yet did he not only forbid the use of Images, as may be thought, in
imitation of Moses (who by that bred such a hatred in the Jews against all
Nations, as has kept a considerable part of them from mingling to this day)
but out of as deep a Reason of State, in relation to continuance: Since it is
impossible, if a Nation once attaines an universal prudence, but that the
deceitful knack of such a carnal adoration must needs grow loathsome, or lie
obvious to their Reproof, that shall make it their full employment to find
faults; and after an opportunity is easily gained, to foment a change, by
discovering to the people absurdities in their Worship; which is better
prevented in one directed, as his is, to the only invisible and omnipotent
Creator, whose Nature and Power is so far remote from the weak apprehensions
of men, as the sharpest reason is not able to batter a Faith built solely upon
it.

7. And by this prudent election, he has so far prevailed against the
corruption of Innovation (a Rust all other Professions have contracted in less
time) as no considerable Schism has yet broke out amongst them: For that
between the Turk and Persian, lies rather in the Genealogy of their Prophet,
then the body of the Belief he first founded. At such time, lest Novelty and
want of Proof should detect him too apparently, he takes Abraham into his
Party, whom he ownes for the Father-of himself and his Followers; giving a no
less honorable Character of Christ and his Mother, to please the Christians,
then of Moses to amuse the Jews; yet has no milder design, then the
destruction of them both: And by this universal compliance, he rendered his
detestable Errors more glib to the wide swallow of that Ignorance, the world
did then gape withal; The cause his Doctrine was embraced by as unquestioned a
belief, as that of the Jew or Christian, whom they look upon as owners of
more improbable Opinions, then theirs, and less tending to the honor of that
universal Goodness, which respects the profit and well-being of his Creatures.

8. In relation to whom the Turks Sabbath, no less then the Jews, was without
doubt instituted, to give a comfortable relaxation to the poor Beast, as well
as Slaves, whom Moses observed to lead a life in Egypt worse then death it
self. Therefore he derives the Institution of the Sabbath, from the mouth of
God, to be of no less antiquity then the Creation. And on this day men were
suffered to do no labor, but to keep a holy rest unto the Lord: by which a
Terror was struck into the contemners of the Law, and a great Love and mutual
Confidence infused among Neighbors, no small promoters of Conquest; such
staning closest in time of danger as are of nearest relations in Religion and
Friendship. Besides, these weekly meetings, do much civilize a Nation,
satisfying no less the minds of the zealous then they moderate the Passions
of the Factious and Disobedient, by the great allay received from the solemn
Devotion observable in their Priests, who use such humble prostrations, and
catching Ceremonies, in the exercise of their Divine Rights (which yet admit of
no scandal, because prosecuted in suit of no Representation, but to the
imploring of the only omnipotent God, in whose service all things are to be
employed) as such are terrified into an Obedience of the Law, out of a future
Fear, that could not else be restrained by a present secular danger, or
after-hope; Imagining a number of possibilites to hide that from Men, which
nothing is able to cover from the sight of God.

9. Of such vast concernment is a grave and prudent Clergy to well-being,
though of late much slighted among some sort of Christians, not so wise as to
observe that the Eye for the most part, is caught before the heart; and that
Austerity and Reverence in external Worship (if divested of all advantages
else) cannot be denied to have a huge operation upon Obedience to the civil
Magistrate. It being unlikely, that such as take Decency in Divine Worship for
Idolatry, should not soon be worn out of Reverence to their Governors, since
the most destructive Parity begins always in the Church.

10. No Law is more intent upon the Honor and Profit of Monarchy, then the
Turks: For though a Munke had a finger in the Pie, yet Mahumet was so skillful
as to season it to his own palate. Neither were many Christian Princes less
absolute at first, then he, till their Subjects by Money, Importunity, or Arms
had moderated their power, which we do not find this Nation ever went about:
Servitude, by use, becoming a second nature: But, had their Ordinances, like
ours, been voted by such a Composition of Estates, wherein the Priestood had
made the principal Ingredient, for Wisdom, if not Authority, it is very
possible they might have more related to Religion; which, like the Indian
Figtree, is of so vast an extent, as it has been able, not only to harbor an
Host of Church men, but their Bag and Baggage, together with all the plunder
they are able to make, by breaking the Hearts, and ransacking the more tender
Consciences of Dying men; as is apparent in Rome, and might have been the same
at Meca, had he not prevented it by a choiser prudence, then our Emperors have
formerly contributed to their affairs.

11. Nor is it a contemptible Paradox to maintain, that the approach of Ruin
or Slavery to a Nation, is visible at first in a too Rich or Meager Face of the
Church. That Causing a Consumption, by sucking too much from the Estates and
Power of the Laiety; as This does a Fever, by putting all into a present
hazard, under the destructive pretense of an overheated zeal. The same
counsel being necessary to all Princes, in relation to Religion, and the
guiders of it, as Phaeton is said to receive from his Father, when he undertook
the conduct of the Horses of the Sun; The Church being a Planet of that
nature, that if it soar too high, it choaks Virtue and Sanctity in the
superfluous Ceremonies, she is apt to produce, which, like too much paint,
adulterates the face of Truth: but if she be kept too low, it does not only
burn and consume all superfluous excrescencies, but Decency and Order;
Allayes, without which we can have no Uniformity in a religious commerce: Since
the Mysteries of our Salvation cannot be presented to us but in Earthen
vessels, from whence, if they did not retain some tincture, we could not so
naturally own them as relating to us: Nay, an indiscreet zeal does so far
participate of the qualities of the Air overheated, that it hatcheth the
Plagues of Rebellion, where ever it is found, pretending their Prince negligent
in Religion, or too exorbitant in his affection to Court Minions, or an
infringer of the Law, and obstructer of Justice; weapons of Sedition, easily
forged, if not found to lie ready before the Gates of the best of Kings; which
subtle men snatch up, and put into the hands of such, as they have formerly
intoxicated with a desire of Reformation, who seldom give over, till they meet
their own ruin, or the States.

12. If Mahumet exceeded the Commission of Discretion, in swelling his Alcaron
to so large a volume, (multiplicity of words breeding, in the same plenty,
Ambiguities, among Divines as Lawyers) Yet he provided against this
inconvenience, with as much caution as a bypast error is capable to admit, in
prohibiting the Reading of it, to any but the Priests, and the Interpretation
to all but the Mufty. For though the Jews were enjoined to score the
Commandments on the Walls, as they did wear them after written on their
Clothes; Yet none but the High Priest was suffered to enter into the Holy of
Holies, or make any near approach into the innermost place of the Temple, from
whence the Oracles did proceed.

13. Neither is it a slight occasion of the Turkish Unity, that their Alcaron
lies patent to the Exposition of none but their own Pope: And that Petitions
to God are frequenter made among them than Exhortations or Sermons to the
People: Because by the first they are humbled, through the repetition of their
sins and wants; and by the other, puffed up with the ostentation of their good
parts: Or, (if it may pass in no worse sense then it is uttered) in Praying we
beg something of God we need; in Preaching he seems to demand Obedience from
us, which no reasonable creature will think he can want. To say truth, the
frequency of Preaching (to avoid the tedious repetition of the same things)
has created such a Familiarity between us and our Maker, and a Feud against
all that serve him not our way, as some take the boldness to predicate, He
cannot do this or that, limiting his Mercy so far as to exclude from
Salvation, not only the Turks, but all the rest of the world; so small a spot
excepted, as a Fly may cover in an ordinary Globe. Do not these vain
pleaders give the Devil more then (I hope) is his due? contrary to the verdict
passed by God himself, who says, The Earth is the Lords, and all that therein
is; without excepting those many and vast Territories, too happy, rich and
fair, to be let out to the Prince of Darkness, by the great and magnificent
Landlord of the world.

14. The whole scope of the more charitable Turkish Doctrine, concludes in
these Ules; The Honor of God, Obedience to their Prince, Mutual Love,
Resolution in War, with an invincible Patience in bearing all terrestrial
wants: The last, as a Hoop compassing the rest, by which they are rendered the
rightest Vessels against Sedition, and the aptest to retain all things
necessary to compliance in Government.

15. Yet, the more to strengthen this tie upon the Subject, all hope of perfect
Happiness in this world is suppressed, and their Imaginations wholly engaged
on that which is to come: By this, the fear of lapsing into grosser Idolatry,
or profounder Atheism, is preventeds being bred only in expectation of Misery
here, and so more guilty, then sensible of that ridiculous folly David so much
upbraids them with, that consume time in the service of Gods, that have neither
Eyes to see, Ears to hear, nor wills to help such as pray to them: For this
Stupidnesse once found in That we have been taught to make the Object of our
worship, and joining forces with the Afflictions, that do ordinarily attend
the Best, and the Blessings, not observed to baulk the most Impious; This, I
say, does often hurry such as have had their hopes deluded, or adjourned beyond
the extent of a small Faith, into wretchlesse Infidelity, or which is worse, a
low and despicable opinion of their Maker; avoided by the Mahumetans, who look
for no remoter causes of Afflictions, then what result from personal
miscarriages, or the will of those in Authority; assigning their Maker an
higher employment, then the attending or accomplishing our earthly desires,
which if attained, they might possibly hinder us from greater in Heaven, to
which this world is but a troublesome and dark passage. Nor can the Turks
prevarications, upon a most partial Scrutinie, bear that stresse of
wickedness, the more seared consciences of some Christians do daily endure,
manifest in the French Massacre; the foulnes of which story has not yet been
matched by Mahumet, or any of his disciples, never found to have borne such
bitter fruit.

But not to insist upon the Equity or Reason of their Law, it gives them (as
the Priests manage it) a satisfactory pretense, to esteem all ways decent and
consonant to Religion, that are able or likely to enlarge their Empire: Not
questioning the Quarrel, no more then the future happiness of such Souls, as
have the Fate to expire in it. And if upbraided herewith, they desire the Pope
to catechize his most Catholic Son, How he came by Portugal, Naples, Milan,
Sicily etc. And what warrant he is able to produce, from the Avenger of Blood,
that might authorize him to shed that Ocean he let out in America, upon no more
serious occasion, then Gold, and the Conversion of the people into slaves to
dig it? Can there be a ranker Blasphemy offered against the Lord of Hosts, then
to set up his Standard in so vast and sanguine a field of Ambition, and the
Cross of his Son in a greater Golgotha, then that wherein he was Crucified?
And all this under pretense of Religion; as if God were less jealous of the
honor of his Church, then the Priests were of their Temple, into the verge of
which they would not admit the price of blood; much less then can the Judge of
all things accept the persons of those that shed it.

16. The awfulnesse the Turks bear to the Name of God is so great, that they
dare not employ the paper wherein they find it written, to any base office, but
leave it hid in a hole to the farther disposure of the Owners Providence; And
therefore possibly not so likely as Christians (who observe no such decency) to
call it to the witness of an untruth; much to the advantage of Governors
there, as it might be in Christendom, did Custom or Law screw the peoples
minds up to as high an esteem of it. Neither would this lessen, but increase
the benefit Statesmen make by dispensing with its abuse, which is now so often
and grossly practiced, as it is apparent to the multitude, who are apter to
follow the Example of their Kings, then the Doctrine of their Teachers; and
might, (if any apparition of Justice or Religion were extant in their
Governors) have their Passions, as the Turks, stirred up to approbation or
dislike, proportionable to the more or less dismal relations their Priests
read to them out of their Mahumetan Legend; so much the more excusable, because
the awe borne to these, though but Fictions, does help to spare the more
ungrateful Rod, the too frequent use of which, has in all times produced more
Fear then Love.

17. This proves, A false Religion does contribute more to safety, then
Atheism, or a stupid neglect of all Worship; and that a Clergy is of excellent
concernment, provided they keep close in their Doctrine, to Reason of State;
not to be brought about, but through the mediation of their own Interest, by
nothing so easily biassed, as comfortable Livings, and severe Deaths or
punishments, in case their exhortations go contrary to the grain of the Civil
Government; whose Administrators have not so much cause to complain of the
Churchmen for their recoyling, since, by their frequent setting them upon the
people, they taught them at last to worrey themselves: Their Tongue, like a
Sword, being as well able to wound one side, as another, and moves according as
it is inclined by profit or fear: Neither can any breach they have formerly
made in the affairs of their Patrons, disparage the Calling, more then it does
a piece of Ordnance, that being lost through imprudence, and miscarriage, does
after batter down the house of her Founder; since all their Fulminations tend
that way, to which the Hand that fills their Bellies is pleased to direct them,
there being none easier warped then they, nor more violent assertors of what
their own Wisdom or the worlds Folly has given them leave to call Theirs, as
were easily deducible from their frequent changings; which gives me the
boldness to believe, that if all, which is without question the Churches, were
restored, and the dignity of their Tenants and Calling vindicated, the truly
honest would comply with any Government, out of Conscience, and the rest batter
contrary Parties in hope of Preferment.

Such as look upon the Mahumetan Profession, as of the grosser allay, because
so far subservient to worldly Policy, that the Grandees and Priests, like
Juglers, carry the coal of zeal only in their mouths, not being heated
themselves with what they go about to inflame others; suffering their Threats
and Promises to rise no higher, or fall no lower, the^ suits with the politic
reaches of the Prince; may find other Courts standing in as profane a posture,
especially that of Rome, (not unworthily looked upon for the Magazeen, from
whence the rest of the world is supplied, with Wisdom, shall I call it, or
Deceit) where Churchmen, like Burning-glasses, cast the Rays of a Celestial
Fire into the Consciences of others, carrying in the mean time, themselves, a
cold, Chrystaline, and Fragil Creed, toward what they endeavor to inform the
People; taking upon them a public cure of Souls, out of a no more religious
respect, then to provide against their private wants; yet connived at here, as
well as by all wise Princes else, because Law can promote no Good, nor prevent
Evil, but what is open to public cognizance; whereas Religion penetrates so
low, as to erect a Tribunal in every mind, where imagination sits, like a
terrible Judge, pronouncing the charge she has been taught from Power,
Custom, and Education; which, through the compunction of a tender Conscience,
does so rack the most intrinsic thoughts of all prepossessed with the dread of
a future account, as they do not seldom confess themselves guilty of such
heinous offenses, as none else are able to accuse them for; expecting more ease
from the sentence of the public Magistrate, then they can find in their
private Consciences, which daily excruciate them with the terrors of Hell, and
the loss of Heaven. To conclude, by the heat of Religion many Virtues are
hatched, and more Vices stifled in the shell.

18. Yet little is observable in the Rites of Mahumet, that is Chargeable to
perform, or grievous to the Nature of Man; Perhaps the cause why Sacrifice is
not taken in, amongst the number of things borrowed from the Jews; as thinking
it incongruous with a Divine Essence, to be appeased or delighted by the loss
and blood of poor Creatures, incapable of the Will or Power to transgress;
Though the inclination to Oppression, Covetousness; and Cruelty, is no more a
stranger to their natures, then ours; which proves Sin an effect of Law and
constraint, rather then of Liberty, or Nature. But the People of God had a
higher Prospect from these bloody Ceremonies, then the dark mist about Mahumet
would suffer him, or any other out of the true Church to apprehend; else
Wolves, and not Sheep, had furnished their Altars. Neither did this new State
Founder believe, any merit could reside in a voluntary Maceration, or
persecution of our Bodies, (as if the most merciful God, confessed to have
prepared in future all celestial beatitudes for those that love him, should
for the present so far divest that nature, as to delight to see us miserable)
which makes me think, that the putting out of their Eyes before the Tomb of
their Prophet (now in use among them) to prevent the sight of any thing after,
and the wearing of such huge and painful Kings in the most tender parts of
their bodies, grew not from any Institute of his, but are rather Bastards of
that Church, reputed for nothing more justly, the Whore of Babylon, then for
burning her Proselytes with such exorbitant zeal, as the Anchorites and Monks
are led by, when they Whip and Stigmatize themselves, out of hope to purchase
Heaven: A lunacy superlative to theirs, who lend money in this world, upon human
security, to be paid in the next by God himself; No ways suitable with this
Fou^ders Philosophy, who would have thought it less Blasphemy, with Plutarch,
to acknowledge no God at all, then to imagine him owner of such Passions, as
are unworthy, and below a Divine Essence.

19. THe total Abstinence from Wine is the most material Sacrament of the
Turks Obedience to Mahumets Law. Now least any should pass it as a less
pertinent piece of Prudence, then really it is, I desire those that take more
delight in condemning then acquitting the actions of Antiquity, to suspend
their Judgments, till these Reasons are weighed.

1. He was not so poor a Naturalist, as not to know, Wine effeminates, no
less then enervates the body of Man; the cause, Sampsons Mother, together with
himself, abstained from it; otherwise he might (by the Witch, his Mistress)
have been as easily charmed into Drunkenesse as Sleep For though it may, not
unpossibly, conjure up a present furious Resolution, it was never yet famed for
a friend to the Habit of valor.

2. It is a Sworn Enemy to Discipline; rendering the most obedient Soldiers,
during that Distemper, deaf to all necessary words of Command.

3. Wine dries the Brain by Nature, and besides, by Accident, informs the
Understanding, through the Commerce and Familiarity it breeds with men of
different Judgments: And so might have easily called up acuter Spirits, and
caused a stricter Scrutiny into the Miracles, Life, and Procedure of their
Legislater, then an infantine Power was able to correspond for: There being no
humor so bad, but this strong liquor is able to make worse and inflame; by
representing miscarriages in Commanders, and affronts from their Fellows,
which in a calmer temper could never have floated in so weak Imaginations: And
thus led on by Chimera's, they, like Samson, snatch up the most improbable
weapons, which they do, not seldom, employ in almost as miraculous Successes.

4. The Transparency of Drunkenness, able to conceal nothing to its own
Shame; And Flexibility to all things, rather then Reason.

5. Being yet in an itinerant condition, and so not likely to find Wine always
at hand; it could not have layn in the power of any earthly thing, but a
premeditated and religious Injunction, to have kept such an untutored Rabble
within the compass of moderation, when ever they had met with it; Not seldom
the Fate of Armies, who upon such disadvantages, have been all cut off by far
inferior Powers, being themselves first overcome by Drink.

6. To end this Digression, in which more might be said; Wine could be no fit
ingredient to mingle with the heat of the Country they marched in, and the
labor they must needs encounter in the rough way, leading to so high Designs.

20. Not to presume to vie Instances with the people of the Jews, who besides
the prudence of Moses, had the unerring Spirit of God, to direct them in all
emergent occasions (which, by the way, renders their frequent Grumblings no
less prodigious, then blasphemous) I find few Nations more constant to their
Founders Aphorisms, or that give less way to a refining, by the agitation of
experiences, drawn from a confluence of differing events, then the Turk; for
which he stands obliged to his own firm Constancy in Religion, and his
Neighbors often variations, which have opened the gap to his most signal
Conquests: It being impossible to shake this Tree of Paradise, but to the
prejudice of the Prince in possession, and benefit of such subtle Serpents as
desire to Supplant him; therefore not to be done out of any wantoner
instigation, then an absolute Necessity. For though the Change of an opinion
that is ancient, may stop a leake for the present, it breeds such a worm, as
does cause a perpetual Colic in the State: Apparent in France, where the Queen
Mother fomented the Protestants, to maintain her Regency, and could never
after be free from the danger of Civil War. This makes me wonder to find
Toleration of Religion so common an Article in the Transactions of Princes;
Since it no way suits with the complexio^ of Prudence to palliate a present
defect by such a Recipe, as may breed for the future an incurable Disease.

21. Yet because many Customs pass current in the Minority of Power, would
prove childish and defective in a more Settled Condition, and after Posterity is
swelled to so considerable a bulk, as that the most numerous part may be
allowed to exchange Battleaxes and Swords into Shares and Pickaxes; it could
not be avoided by humane Providence, but something should be wanting in
relation to so vast an Empire, no less terrible to the Ear then admirable to
their Eyes, have seen it; A Fortune perhaps as far above the hopes of their
first Founder, as it transcends the ordinary extent of the like endeavors.
Therefore he deserves, in my opinion, more Commendation, for foreseeing so
much, then blame, in omitting Provisions against such accidents, as none but a
Prophet indeed could be ever able to presage: Many Carriages being necessary to
the Sword, are superfluous, if not destructive, when the Scepter is obtained:
The first intending the death of Enemies, but the latter the Preservation of
Subjects and Friends.

22. Whereupon his Successors finding that though the Keys of the Church can
hang no where so quietly, as at the Girdle of the Prince, (of which Moses is an
unerring Example) yet to give a greater luster to the beams of Religion
(esteemed by all, if not quite corrupted, yet far less pure in Secular
Vessels, then those set wholly apart for the worship of God;) And to have
withal a favorable Umpire of a seeming more indifferent and sanctified allay,
ready to compose any Discontents, that might be fomented between the civil
Power and the Subject, either through others Ambition, or their own Oppression,
not unlikely to result from so absolute a Jurisdiction; A Religious man, called
the Mufty, is set up, whose Habit is Green, a color none but the Kindred of
Mahumet are suffered to wear, of which number he is always supposed to be
one. Now the better to enable him to strike an awful Reverence into the
People, in case a misled Zeal should melt them into Divisions, or a colder
License freez them into a chill Atheism, the Emperor honors the Mufty in
public, with the highest reverence and most solemn attention, Denying him
nothing he dare ask, No Malefactor being suffered to dye, has the fortune to
see him or be seen by him as he passes; The Prince placing him, upon all
weighty occasions, next the Throne, where, by his public Gestures, he acts a
lively and terrible dread of those Crackers, that contain no other Sparks of a
celestial fire, then what resides in true Reason of State: Which is the Art of
Governing to the best advantage for Prince and People.

And though this Circumcised Pope yields an infallible obedience to all the
Emperor inspires him with, yet being rarely seen, the Generality reverence
him, as if they apprehended something about him more then humane. And let our
new Politicians practice what they please, Experience has made it sufficiently
manifest, that A too prostituted Familiarity breeds contempt, not only in
things civil, but Divine. Now such as think the Prudence, absolutely necessary
to the Conduct of humane affairs, useless in those relating to Heaven, may be
out; For since Miracles, and the audible voice of God is silent, nothing is so
likely as a Sanctified Policy, to retain a competent Reverence for Religion,
or maintain so much Probity, as is requisite in a general Commerce, to keep us
from murdering one another, upon the instigation of Covetousness and Revenge.
Therefore the way for Prince and Priest to be thought more then men, is to do
nothing unworthily, say nothing unproperly, nor wear any thing undecently.

23. The Turk in this is happy, that the Mufty his Pope, no less then Meca his
Rome, are within the reach of his power; so as he is not to seek for the
Oracles of Religion out of his own Territories; denied by custom to the most
considerable part of Europe, whose Princes are regulated by the Popes
Inspirations, not only in things concerning God, but what else may be fetched
in, by his Pastoral Crook ( In Ordine ad Spiritualia.) And left this absurd
proceeding should be exposed to a general Reformation, the Bishop of Rome
tolerates all Incestuous Matches, and other base ad unjust actions, Princes
desire to have indulged, for fear, like Hen. the 8. they should do it of
themselves. The consideration of which makes them bear the heavy weight of so
many Ecclesiastics, who scarce acknowledge any obedience but to the Sea of
Rome.

24. Though the Turkish Court no less then the Common People, do afford the
Gaudy plumage of Honor to the Mufty, the highest Bird in this earthly
Paradise; yet if he but offers to tune his note contrary to the true Dialect of
State, he is straight unperched: It having been long observable in this Empire,
That neither Friends, Money, Sanctity, Love of People, former Desert, or any
present need of the persons accurate Parts, were ever found Antidotes
sufficient to expel the poison of the Emperors Jealousy, who esteems no
number of Lives (though never so innocent) equivalent with his safety, or the
Nation's. Yet if this Holy man comes to his death by an unnatural Obstruction,
the honor of his place is so far from receiving diminution by it, that his
Body goes to the Grave with the least aspertion to his Fame; his Life being
rather commended. So as his Successor mounts into his Chair untainted by any
Prejudice; which Christians contract to their Popes or Patriarchs, by the
errors they discover after their Deaths; The cause, such as succeed are not in
so great esteem, as their Offices require; Thought capable to be tainted with
the same faults, their Predecessors were owners of: not here imagined, because
the Mufty, how ill soever he deserved of Church or State, is registered among
their Saints. In which appears the highest point of Policy, it being unlikely,
any should question the truth of his Judgment, when he is in being, whose
Actions they dare not arraigne after he is dead. And for his Removal, it
passes without the least notice given to, or taken by the Generality; who are
otherways employed, either in caressing their plurality of Wives, or
dispatching the business necessary to their Professions: Abominating us
Christians for walking to no more profitable an end, then to talk of News,
etc.

25. This discourse of the Mufty's dispatch may afford some room, by the way,
to enquire into the justice of Clandestine Deaths; a Custom with the
Mahumetans, but such an one, as I hope never to see concocted into a more
general practice among us: yet observing how our Chronicles lie overflowed
with such vast Oceans of Blood, spilt upon no more urgent and public
necessity, then what relates to the ends and ambition of a single person, I
will venture to say of it, and that only for the Meridian of Turkey, That a
Physician or a Felton may be cheaper employed, then an Army, and with less
prejudice to the good of the Generality, Voted by all Right and Reason, the
Supreme Law, And for whose Salvation Innocence himself was willing to dye.
For where the sole power of Life and Limb resides, as it does here, in the
breast of the Prince, under the warrant of an uninterrupted Custom (the malice
making the Murder, and not the blow) I cannot think it so heinous a Crime,
that, in case a Subject has justly forfeited his Life to the Safety or but the
convenience of the People, it should be taken the most advantageous way, to
make the better compensation for the damage, it had or might have brought to
the public. A private execution being esteemed here no more Murder, where the
cause is just, then one made public is able to expiate the blood of an
Innocent.

I know, so many Inconveniences lie in the way of this Custom, as it appears
too unwieldy to be managed without danger by a single person, whose Judgment
cannot be so clearly separated from passion, as merely to intend his Countries
preservation, without the mixture of some gall of revenge; A candor not
unpossibly to be found in the State of Venice, by nothing so long preserved in
being, as a Custom they have sometimes to make away their greatest Senators
upon no stronger evidence, then what mere Suspicion brings in against them;
preferring rather the cutting off a Limb, in which appears the first Symptoms
of Putrefaction, then to hazard the whole body by an incurable Gangrene. But
whether the damage of this practice, exceeds the profit, or the benefit the
danger of the consequence, cannot be easily resolved; Since Princes and
Statesmen carry often such pernicious humors, as they convert that into a
daily practice, which, like David's eating the Shewbread, is only permitted in
case of Necessity.

26. Queen Elizabeth, in other things the best consulted Monarch that ever
filled the English Throne, forfeited more good opinion and honor, in using the
Hangman in the death of her sister Mary of Scotland, then if she had employed
all the Mountebanks in Europe: For though Princes stand as near the Grave as
other Mortals, in relation to Diseases, no less then Desert; Yet the hand of
Justice cannot decently appear in their Executions, without debauching the
Majesty of her own Power; Princes being esteemed the mouth of the Law. Now
since the Council of England were too pious or hypocritical, to use the Fig in
the sense of Italy, Spain, and other Nations, celebrated for more wisdom;
they might under an higher repute of Sanctity have spared the Leaves, and not
laid the fault on poor Davison, that did nothing but by Commission; an Apron
that discovered more shame then it could possibly hide: All looking upon it,
not only as the desire, but the act of the Queen and her Council, who by this
public procedure dilated the reproach over the whole Nation. Now I appeal to
all not indulgent to a Form of Justice, though never so ridiculous, who
obliges his Prisoner most, he that takes away the irksome Ceremonies,
Dishonor and Expectation of Death, or he that accumulates them all on a Block?
As if that which is Murder in a Chamber, were not only far greater, but more
terrible on a Scaffold, where nothing but Death and her attendants appear.

27. But to return to Turkey. It lies not out of the way of possibility, but
that the Grand Signior, in regard of his abundance of Wives, may have two, or
more Children at one and the same time: Therefore to break the neck of all
Disputes, apt to result from contrary claims, the Emperor in fact strangles
all the rest; a confessed tyrannical Tragedy, not to be heard without
detestatio^; yet we fear too often acted among Christians, else the Line of the
Catholic King, no less then that of France, and those smaller ones in Italy,
might long since have choked their Felicity in a crowd of Rebellions: Neither
need I end here, were it my design to exceed the Counterpane by home-born
examples. Yet such a Querie may be seasonably made, If the good of All (as I
said before) be the Supreme. Law, and grounded upon that of Nature, whose
chief business is to intend the preservation of the whole, without any nicer
relation to particulars, then to place or remove them according as they suit or
bring profit to the general occasions, a duty all are born to; why should such
be blamed, as take the most probable ways to promote peace, and stop the
Posterne gates of the Court, by which more dangerous Wars enter, then do
ordinarily proceed from the invasions of Strangers? And here, by the way, we
may note, That Republics have not such impulsive causes to shed innocent
blood, as Kings: especially after that Sluice is stopped, which the most for
their preservation are forced to let run at first, till the State is reduced to
an wholesome Parity, and the ambitious itch of all Pretenders cured.

28. Nothing is penal by the Laws of this Nation, but what is always, or, at
least for the present, destructive to the well being of the Prince or People:
By which the more active Youth (the strongest ingredient to compose an Army of)
remain so fully satisfied with an uninterrupted License to attain the farthest
extent of their desires., as they apprehend no felicity beyond the Liberty they
enjoy: And in such as Time and Weariness has exchanged the humor of Lust, for
one more Thriving, the Privilege they have to exact on strangers, hinders
their apprehensions from finding that loathsome taste, Forraigners imagine to
result from so absolute a Jurisdiction, as is, and has been for many ages
exercised by their Emperors over them. And thus the State is a double gainer;
this Indulgence affording opportunity for all to lay out themselves to the
advantage of their Country, either in getting Wealth, or Soldiers to defend it.

29. Contrary to the practice of Christians, that plant the Canons of their Law
and arm the Messengers of Death and Damnation against the Gnats of
juvenilelapses, but permit the weightier sins of Oppression, Schijme, and
Ambition, which never leave boiling in sly heads, till they discover an
opportunity, by which they may overflow the ancient Government in turning the
peoples eyes toward the Faults of their Prince, and stopping them with
prejudice against his Virtues: which may be done under the Scale of so secure a
Caution, as the Actors are often upon the Stage, before those intended to be
the subject of the Tragedy are able to take notice of it, especially in Nations
glutted with Peace and plenty, or such as long to cast off an usurped Power;
whereas it is possible, if Nature were not so hard curbed, and deprived of vent
(by which she is not seldom carried through an impetuous Lust, out of the true
rode of Generation) such minds might be taken up with less destructive
diversions; This desire being as hard to be appeased, as that of hunger or
thirst: Neither can the defects daily observed to increase in our Issue, be
justly imputed to any thing else, than the meager desires, so strict a
confinement breeds in us, by which the spirits are so curdled and quelled, as
they rarely produce any thing admirable for Strength or Stature, the highest
perfections of Nature, and no less useful in Peace than War; so as the
Names and Estates of the most illustrious Families this age affords, depend on
Children our forefathers would hardly have christened; being fit for nothing
but Learning; a Trade had never been so over-laid, but to find employment for
these Changelings; who Fairy-like throw about Firebrarnds in State and Church,
upon the least apprehension of any want or superfluity in Ceremony or Decency.
To conclude, Such as too rigidly expel by their forked Laws, any natural
desires, forget they will return, or break out into a worse mischief; No
less then the more prudent Advice of Solomon, not to wring the nose of the
People to void excrements, lest Blood should follow: For if Law did not
outwrangle Nature, she might possibly be heard to plead, that our ordinary
Marriages do rather tire then satisfy her desires. And though it may not be
owned as a decent Poesy for the Ringleaders to Sedition, yet the setting too
high a Mulct upon the peoples Peccadillio's, and dissents in Judgment, no way
in their power to prevent, though possibly to dissemble, is the cause of a
loathing of the present Government, and a certain presage of ruin to all in
Authority, if not the whole State, to be brought about under the pretense of
zeal to Religion, and care of the peoples Liberty; though the first is no more
visible in the Church, than the latter is in the civil Administration of
affairs; Far exceeding the Cheat of Ananias and Saphira, who gave a
considerable part of what was their own, whilst these swallow all the primitive
Charity had laid out in pious uses, belying so far the holy Spirit, as to
pretend, the worst they can say or do, is dictated by it. And I wish Mahumet
were only guilty in this, who made not his Religion alone, but his loathsome
Disease a Baud to his Ambition and Rapine.

30. Punishments in Turkey are more sharp than common, which does rather
stupifie than waken the humor to Rebellion; and are executed on open
Malefactors, not the Darlings of the people, removing the latter upon occasion
by a clancular procedure; As in case a Madman (one of the Prothets of their
Rabble for such they esteem so) should inveigh against Authority, they are far
wiser than to stigmatize or whip them through the City (as we used to do)
before the people, who take themselves not only concerned, but wounded in the
general Liberty, through their sufferings; It being their nature to take hold
of, and believe any evil report of such Governors (at least) as are employed
in Taxes, or any other ungrateful service, though most necessary for the use
of the State: therefore in such cases, if they cannot tempt him over to their
side, by Gold, they stop his mouth with something less cordial: and if his
body be found, no diligence is omitted in the enquiring after some Ruffin, on
whom the people may be likely to father the Murder; or the Corpse not
appearing, they pretend him rapt up into Heaven by the mediation of their great
Prophet, at whose feet he sits pleading their cause, and guarding them from
some Plague, they say, impends over them for their disobedience to the
Emperor, the Vicegerent of God upon Earth. Nor does this often times serve,
but a solemn Fast is appointed, where the Statesmen do in show, and the
Ignorant in pure zeal, afflict themselves; during which time, the news of
some victory or happy accident, is brought and owned as the return of their
Prayers, no less than a heavenly approbation given to the Actions of those in
Power: Thus after the multitude have been sufficiently chastised for the
Courtiers faults, they become humble and quiet, submitting their backs to any
burden, out of a fear of worse, and an opinion they have that it is consonant
to the will of God.

Yet in my judgment no wise Prince ought to tire out this remedy by a too
often application, lest it should not only loose its virtue, but breed a worse
Disease; an over heated zeal consuming not seldom the wrong end to that for
which it was at first kindled, being apt to be driven by the contrary winds of
Ambition and Covetousness upon the Church, where the Buckets use to hang,
likeliest to quench the flames of any other sedition, than what results from
this Wildfire; which for the most part melts the Lead, and consumes the
foundation of the House of God, under pretense of his Service; a course that is
so far from edification, that it makes all, not acquainted with the true knack
of Ambition, hate to be reformed: Whose second remove is to the Court, where
finding all things in a rotten condition, or at best obnoxious to be construed
to a sense contrary to the prepossessed minds of the Major part; the whole
Fabric is consumed, to the very person of the Prince, out of whose ashes
another arises that proves a Bird of the same feather, if not a worse: The
Subjects returning home laden, for the generality, with no more benefit than
the Beggars, that in a drunken fit expose themselves to the danger of the Law,
Wounds, Beating, and Death, only to burn the old Whipping-post; though daily
experience informs them, they can neither be quiet or safe without it, which
is the cause that in all places they set up a new one, when the fury of the
distemper is over. Thus are Subjects no less vain, that do rebel, than
Governors mad, that provoke them to it.

31. The Subjects in Turkey have nothing hereditary: All Honors, and places of
profit, being peculiar to Desert, and determine with Life, without the least
partiality showed to greatness of Birth, unless that it produces more
jealousy than favor, to have descended from a Father formerly in power. This
hangs no less weight of Restraint on the Ambition of all in actual
Administration of public Affairs, than it adds Industry to such as have not
yet attained to that height. By which a foul error in Europe is obviated,
where men ascend to the highest places by the mediation of Friends and Money,
rather than any advantage their worth brings to the Commonwealth: It being
most ordinary for Fools to be admitted into the Temples of Honor and Riches,
whilst the choicest endowments of Art and Nature are suffered to pray, if not
beg, without.

32. The Emperor's being here Administratour to all dead men's Estates, forces
their Children to be solicitous after trades; as having none to rely on for a
future maintenance, but themselves. And to add reputation to this laudable
custom the Grand Segnior professes some Art himself, in which he disdains not
to consume his spare time. From whence accrues this benefit to the State, That
Disbanded Soldiers (the pest of Christian Nations) are one day in Arms, the
next at work in their Shops. Neither have they such confluence of Idle men,
Lawyers, and Scholars, which among us make up a third of the people, and are,
for the most part Contrivers and Fomenters of all the distractions found in
Church and State: From whence results the severest of the Curses, God left to
the choice of David; For the Plague and Famine terminate chiefly in Children
and the weakest of men; whereas the Sword (like some Monsters recorded) makes
the fairest Women and choicest Men, the object of its lust and fury, and
therefore brings an incomparable infelicity wherever it reigns.

33. This Custom of Trade and independency on future hope religiously
observed, does cut the cords of such Vanities as draw Christians into Luxury,
by a profuse expense in Furniture, and no less excess in Building, to a
treble proportion of what the Owner needs, in relation to his particular
Family; the burial of Timber and other rich Materials: much to the prejudice
of Shipping, besides the Rent charge it puts upon the possessors Revenue to
maintain it in Repair.

34. Neither is this people apt to follow the Eupopeain vanities of
Horse-rases, Hunting, Hawking, and amorous Entertainments: Their plurality of
Women quenching with more security in regard of Health, and less Charge, the
thirst of Change ordinarily attending the tedious cohabitation with one.

35. The Turks are very magnificent in public Buildings, especially such as
relate to the service of God; none of the weakest effects of their Teachers
sufficiency; who by working upon tender Consciences, are able (like ours) to
make them so unnatural fools, as to skip their nearest Relations, and to
design what they got, they know not how, in providing conveniences for they
know not whom: By which means such Baths and Moscos are erected, as do
increase the case of Travelers, no less than the zeal of those that make the
purchase of Heaven the object of their endeavors; whilst Christians raze the
names of Benefactors out of the foreheads of sumptuous Piles, suffering the
ill-mingled ingredients of Covetousness, and a burning desire of Change in
Religion, to consume brave Monuments of Charity, by alienating the Lands, and
melting the Lead of the Houses, which a more ancient and fervent zeal (though
now indicted of Superstition) had solder'd on: Therefore if I were worthy to
give Advice to our public Spirits, they should hereafter assign their
Legacies and Contribution toward the mending of Common Ways, and erecting
useful Bridges; more likely to carry their Names to eternity, than Chuches or
other pious Foundations, apter to have their convenience questioned by covetous
and ungrateful Posterity; since earthly Paths are more trodden and better
indulged, than those leading to heaven: Nothing being likely to continue long,
that is able to bear the charge of its own ruin. Therefore those that
accumulated these rich Donations, on the Church and Seminaries of Learning,
instead of perpetuating their own fame, laid a foundation for the ruin of
that, they only intended to preserve. It being unpossible that any humane
Institution should continue without so much show of Corruption (especially if
rich and splendid) as may give a pretense for the rapine of those, who being
inapprehensive of the sense of Honor and Religion, are instigated by Avaric^
or a present necessity. This makes me, though with trembling presage, that the
ruin of Christianity in Europe is not very far off: because the greatest
Revenues of the Catholic Church are looked upon with more Envy than Religion;
which once proclaimed corrupted, or unnecessary, she lies open to the plunder
of all. Upon which consideration, the Pope has not done imprudently to gather
a Church in America, whether he may one day be forced to retire, whose Zeal is
likelier to be hotter than the Europeians, that have had theirs cooled with the
winds of so many contrary Doctrines. Thus does Religion run from one Meridian
to another, thriving best at first; for after a long abode she so far sharpens
and refines the spirits of men, as they are able to discover such Abuses and
Errors, as may afford them a pretense to cut her own throat for what she
possesses: when, God knows, it is not the Doctrine that is changed, but their
Apprehensions: for if the heat of Zeal be misimployed, which is able to concoct
any opinions into the nourishment of Religion, all things after will prove flat
and nauseous. This might tempt Mahumet to stuff his Alcaron with such high and
mystical expressions, to busy and amuse such as can taste no Doctrine, but
what may bite the Conscience and perplex the Understanding.

36. THough it be natural for Founders of Nations to enlarge their Confines,
to the farthest extent, Prudence or Power is able to stretch them; I find the
Institutes of none suite better with such a Design, then those Mahumet and his
more immediate Successors have followed: Yet to spare my own memory, no less
then theirs (if any be) that will venture such a Jewel as Time, in the
survaying and purchase of so a wild a field of Observations.; I shall fix upon
Three things they chiefly labor to promote: Out of which it will not only be
easy to extract their First Principles, but deduce the subsequent materials
employed in the edification of this vast Body; whose stride, though it extends
not so far as Spain, yet it is more compact, and in that better able to
remove, without danger of falling, any blocks that neighbor Princes may, out
of jealousy cast in the way of its felicity: not to be paralleled in any part
of the world, with which Profit or Curiosity has made us familiar.

37. The first lies in Obedience; which, being divided between Religion and
Empire, asks the more prudence to prevent danger; least such as pretend to be
the sole Heirs of God, do not cozen the Prince of his Birthright, under a
popular discovery of a too rough hand in Government, or error in divine
Worship, in which the poor claim no less ample a share than the rich; all
being noted to fight with the greater animosity for the world to come, the
less they find themselves possessed of in this: it appearing to them unsuitable
with the Goodness and Justice of a Supreme Power, that the Creature should
not some where meet with felicity. And to prevent all sinister misprisions
incident to the Religion of the Prince (the gap with which the babes of
Rebellion and Novelty are pampered) Though the Ecclesiastical and Civil Powers
be both radically in the Grand Segnior; yet the pontifical Mufty has Studied
the Art to make the people believe, these two Streams do flow, one from a
less, and the other from a more Sanctified fountain: By which is gained this
huge advantage, that the Emperor has all he dislikes, condemned as it were out
of the mouth of God, no less then what he likes, approved; It being upon no
slighter penalty than Death, to refuse to acquiesce in any Sense, this holy man
puts upon the Alcaron: nor can the Interpretation, State-reason requires this
day, perplex one quite contrary, the next, if it may be more useful; because
nothing is registered but what respects men; things relating to God being left
free to the disposure of the Prince, who by the lips of the Mufty directs the
knowledge of the people; himself like a weathercock pointing only that way
which the breath of Policy blows; the inferior sort of Priests in the mean
while screaming like Lapwings in the ears of the Rabble, lest they should
observe the proceedings of the Court, which is the Nest wherein all their
Grievances (as they call them) are hatched.

38. Now, concerning Obedience in things merely civil, though the hand of the
Priesthood be not out in all emergent cases, yet the Subject having no Vote in
the proposal or consent to Laws, all being solely at the will of the Prince,
they have nothing but Patience to fly to, in the highest exactions he is
pleased to impose; no Instrument appearing of any mutual Compact betwixt Him
and the People, so as Life and Estate are merely arbitrary; better endured,
because the Crown being Heir to all men, none can be made poorer than they were
born; it being the nature of all, to esteem highest of their Birthright, a
Term here not understood.

39. The second thing promoted, is an impartial Parity throughout all his
Dominions, in relation to everything but Desert; none appearing higher or lower
then the rest, but according to the Plate he fills in the State; all Offices
remaining wholly in the disposure of the Emperor: This removes the Subjects
eyes from the Grandees, who might else be tempted to Faction, and fixes them
upon the Throne as their natural Object, and most auspicious to their
Fortunes. Thus are the Rich humbled into Thraldom out of Fear, and the rest
out of Hope; two Reins, which whosoever has the art to handle, may guide the
world whither he please: This keeps the Turks chaste from Rebellion, either out
of scorn to follow one of no more noble extraction than themselves, or through
the baseness bred in them by receiving Injuries, not only from the legal
Magistrate, but the Soldier, whose Authority lies in his Sword, which the
common people have as little warrant to wear, as skill to use; yet like the
Head-prentice they execute the same Tyranny upon Strangers, their Masters are
pleased to exercise over the^: where terror is augmented, because Punishments
are not confined either by Law or Custom, though they oftener exceed then fall
short of the merit of the cause. And here it cannot be observed without a
serious reflectio^ upon the force Imagination borrowes from the religious
reverence they bear to their Prince, that such as will contemn all dangers in
his defense, are rarely found (till of late) in Arms against him, though
provoked by the most heavy oppressions. Thus we see how far they may err, that
make success the Touchstone of the truth of a Profession, or the peace it
brings to a Nation; or the owners Conscience; and experience can produce
millions of Examples, that men only steeled with erroneous opinions have been
no less daring upon fire and sword, then those marching under the target of
truth.

40. The third thing is Fortitude; endowed so richly by no Nation as the Turks,
whose Emperor places all Offices in the Van of brave Actions; whilst his
Priests and Prophets are no less diligent in mustering up the joys of Heaven
in the Rear: And for Cowards, they have not only Poverty and Reproach
attending them in this world, but Hell and Damnation in the next. Thus by
baiting all the ends of his Militia, he does not only catch the covetous and
ambitious, but those attached with the invincible humors of superstition and
melancholy; By which, like oxen, they are rendered not only fit, but willing to
endure both labor and Slaughter. Thus Phantaly but a weak shell in it self,
yet if filled with Sulphurous zeal, and the opinion of Truth, and future
Happiness, confounds not only all that dare appear in opposition of it, but
the very Design (if capable of so much prudence and moderation as to project
one) that she intended to promote. Therefore such as consider, how far the
Turks Conquests are indulged by their Religion, have more cause to wonder, they
are not masters of the whole world, then that they enjoy such a proportion
thereof, as they do; where the Sisters and Daughters, of the Emperors own
blood, are often given in marriage to reward that which was bravely ventured by
the meanest Soldier; whose Issue by custom can challenge no higher place in
their Unkles or Gransires favor, then they are able to purchase by their own
Desert, he owning none for Kindred, beyond such as are allied to Virtue,
Wisdom, or some other quality that may render them useful to the State:
Unlike the practice of Germany, where ten or more bear the Title of one
Principality, having nothing to feed on but the air of Honor, looking like
solitary and demolished Castles, quite destitute of Strength or Territory, the
name of the place being only left to uphold them.

41. In the pursuit of their Fortitude, I shall say something more of their
proceedings in War: and first of Eunuchs, by many thought less propense to
Valor, and therefore possibly to be noted in the Turks as a blemish, by such
as do not warily observe, that Caution and Circumspection are no less, if not
more, necessary in the General, and often times harder to be met with, than
Daring and undaunted Resolution in the Soldier; it being one thing to execute,
another to direct. Therefore the Grand Segnior does not seldom make Eunuchs
Commanders in Chief, never Common Soldiers; the Fear, which is necessary in
the first, being destructive in the latter; more Armies having perished for
want of Moderation, than Valor, in the Head: Besides their incapacity of
Children gives such caution for their Fidelity, as cannot be expected from one
more virile; a perfect man being in a condition to gain honor and profit by
the Change of Government, whereas one so mutilated is capable of little more
than shame and loss. And because it is unlikely to cut the throat of this
Empire with any sword but her own, such are employed with most discretion in
these high places, as are least apt to rebel.

42. The Janissaries, on whom they fix the belief of Victory, are by a
primitive Institution prohibited Marriage; yet least this should make a gap in
their felicity, the wives, and daughters of the less useful, especially those
their Sword has subdued, are without question subject to their desires. This
wings their obedience in the performance of Commands, though pointing at never
so remote Employments. For quite unshackled from the magneticall force of an
affection to wife and children, by use made natural (which chains Christians,
like fond Apes, to their own doors) every place is fancied their proper sphere;
because it cannot afford courser Meat, harder Lodging, or severer Discipline,
than they have at home: Neither does the want of Wives raise such cries as are
made by the Relicts and Children of slain Soldiers; the appeasing of which
swells in other Nations to little less than would pay a small Army: This
Emperor being Heir as well to the Lives as Estates of his Subjects.

43. They seldom grant Quarter till all is subdued: By this they prevent
fighting twice with the same Adversary. Neither are they forward to exchange
Prisoners, left in their abode with the Enemy, their affections should be
warped toward any more moderate discipline, observable in those they oppose:
And out of the like Jealousy they seldom continue War long with the same
Naton; Change not only preventing all Contagion, that may arise from Commerce
with worse-ordered people, but affording the Soldier at least a seeming
delight, in variety. And in farther relation to Quarter, a Prince rich in
Subjects does rather spoil then mend his Market by such kind of barterring, by
rendering Enemies the bolder, as being readier to dispense with the danger of
Imprisonment than Death: Neither are any miraculous effects of Despair much to
be feared, where there is room enough left to evade: This humor being as
single and rare, as the Phoenix, and not to be generated but out of the ashes
of hope. And he that considers, that the Turk is not of so poor an allay, as
some Princes, which are undone by a victory, if it costs too dear, may see his
design in a great part satisfied by the Employment and loss of his Soldiers;
the too great increase of such Spirits being all he has reason to fear. This
makes War (an Art in other places) an absolute Nature and necessity here.

44. He is not yet so fond of Honor, as to lay out his endeavors in the
purchase of places not able to pay for their own Chains; A charge the
Catholic King is never like to abate so long as he is Master of Naples,
Millan, etc. that cost more to keep, then the profit made of them can compense;
the like may be yet said of Ireland, etc.

45. Their Ordnance, found the largest in the known world, are carried into the
field in the Common Soldiers Pockets.

46. The general Food of the Turks, both in City and Camp, is Rice and Water;
Their most dainty addition being but a Hen, or some small lump of Flesh. This
makes them pursue victory over desolate Places, and starve such Armies as
presume to follow them, who are as certainly overwhelmed with an Ocean of
Necessities, as the Egyptians were by the Red Sea.

47. Their Expeditions are not ordinarily undertaken, but in Summer; By which
many great dangers are prevented, lesse-advised Princes do daily cope withal,
in meeting with Contingences that arise from Want and bad Weather, harder to be
vanquished than the Enemy himself. For though their Numbers be great; yet the
little, Use has taught them to be content withal, is easily met with at that
Season, and renders them so impregnable against what we call Fortune, as she
may possibly bend her Bow, but is not able to distress them by the strongest
Arrows her Quiver affords. Besides the Echo the Report of the Emperors
strength makes in the hollow hearts, those Princes, it concerns, carry one to
the other, is not only Harbinger, but in a great part, Operator of his
Victories; when Christians march but with part of their strength, leaving the
rest to follow in the nature of a Reserve, (as if there were hope a paucity
should prevail when the gross is beaten, who, if joined, might possibly have
warranted Success) and do by this not only lessen the repute of their Power (of
no small consequence in the Art of War) but discourage any other from joining
with them, who upon the sound of an invincible Army would prick-up their Ears.

48. If a Shock be given to the Emperors Forces, he stays not long enough in
that place to receive another, but returns home without tempting his Fortune
farther that Summer; Wisely concluding it much unlikely (as in truth it is) for
a disheartened Army to perform what she could not bring about when the Soldier
was in full plight. Neither can the certain cause of an Overthrow be easily
penetrated into; and till that be thoroughly surveyed, on Prince may in
discretion hazard the chance of a second Battle, though the Commanders
appear never so confident of good success; it suiting with their interest
both in honor and safety, to venture all, rather than come out of the Field
with so great a reproach; Considerations below a Superlative power, to whom
Security ought to be more dear, than any thing that carries the countenance of
greater loss then gain; It not being impossible but that the former disgrace
might arise from some Treachery in the Principal Officers; Therefore it is
good Policy to examine every Card in the Pack, before the dealing of a new
Game, especially upon a fleshed party: Yet with this caution, that many things
must be put to the venture by the Founder of an Empire, which suite not with
the Prudence of one already established; For Repute, far more necessary then
Safety to the first, is below it many degrees in the second; since he that
holds but part of a Cudgel in his hand, may retreat in quiet, but he that has
quite lost it shall be bit by the same dogs that gave way to, or fawned upon him
before his force was spent.

49 The Grand Segnior (after augmentation of the Empire) is in nothing more
studious then of means to Employ the Superfluous quantity of Soldiers, his
vast estate produces. By this making those isntrumental to the propagation of
honor and dominion, that in such narrow yet fruitful Cockpits as England,
breed nothing but Sedition; and for want of ease and plenty, strive like Jacob
and his Broher for more room; it being possible for evil Government to convert
the blessing of Increase and multiply into as heavy a curse, as ever yet fell
from the mouth of God: Therefore a too zealous prosecution of Peace (which some
Princes, not unwise in their single judgment called King-craft) is a no less
vain, than destructive Art; and so unsuitable to the good and safety of any
Government, that it hatcheth Plagues, or which is more contagious to a State,
Civil War: Neither can this Plurisie be easier cured, or the Spirits of
Rebellion better evaporaed, then by openning the peoples veins in some
Foreign Employment.

50. The Turkey Cavalrie are seldom in evil plight, because their Horses are
still under the owners eye, who for the most part do serve upon them, and have
to that end large proportions of land allowed them, with other immunities not
common to the people, to whom they are both a curb and a protection: And
between these and the Foot such a feud is bred, either by Custom, Nature, or
Art, that it is reported, the Horse will (if unprevented) burn their litter,
least the Infantry should employ it to their better accommodation: Now though
this may look like a prejudice in the field it secures all fear of
combination at home. Neither is it a slight addition to security, that the
greatest part of this Militia consists of such as were selected out of
Children, paid for tribute by conquered Nations, who composed of several
aires, cannot associate with that ease as Armies made up of one Language; which
like the Swiss, do not seldom call for Gbelt when they have the Enemy in view.

51. Their strength lies in the Field, and not in Fortresses, looked upon as
nurseries of Rebellion, especially in so absolute a Tyranny, where it is more
common for the Emperor to send for the Head of a Bashaw, then to be denied; A
power that would be buried in stronger Holds, out of which few would come to
such entertainment, as is given to the Grandees upon the least invitation of
Jealousy. Not to beat more upon this Argument, long since driven up to the
head by the best of Judgments, That fortified places suite the affairs of
weak Princes, better then those of greater strength, etc. he that has men in
abundance needs them no more, then those of narrower confines and less
populous are able to subsist without them.

52 They make not Religion the cause, or at least proclaim it not for the
principal Motto of a War; which wakens the attentions and invokes the
assistance of all the contrary profession; the poorest man taking himself so
far interested in the vindication of his Faith, that if he has nothing else
to venture, he will account it sacrilege to deny his life: But no sound of
that being heard, the voice of hope and fear drownes that of danger and
concernment, in the prejudice and hatred they bear to their Neighbors;
Fathering all misfortune that falls to them upon divine vengeance, in opposition
of which they dare not engage; no more then most Princes are willing to part
with their Gold till it is too late; like the wretched inhabitants of
Constantinople, who chose rather to loose all in an entire sum, than to break
it for the preservation of themselves and their Country. And if any thing could
have tempted Christians to the rescue of their own interest in the costody of
others, it would have been then, when this Imperial City was in such danger.
But the moderation of Caesar's power was so grateful a Spectacle for the
present, as it dazeled their apprehensions in relation to any future
inconveniences; yet when this key of Europe was lost, those that before were
quiet, if not contented Spectators, began to mistrust their own doors, and
bewail their ignorance, in not foreseeing that the effects of such a
neighborhood was not so easily to be resisted, as the Siege (which was the
cause) might have been raised, had there been a cordial conjunction amongst
those tied in policy to have kept him farther off. Thus by presuming more on
the strength of others, than there is cause for, most states at last come to be
distressed themselves.

53. Their Militia is observed to be more daring in their Christian
expeditions, than those undertaken against the Persian; a people looked upon as
too near of kin to them in Religion, to warrant their Murdering: The same sin
committed by Princes in gross, which private persons do by retaile, yet are
punished for it in this world, where the other are commended; though the people
l describe are too wise and affectionate toward the more substantial part of
their Creed, to prosecute those of their own profession to the farthest extent
of their power, out of no more serious consideration, then whether their own,
or the Persian Priests delude the people with the greatest show of Truth,
especially both owning one and the same supreme Jugler, Mahumet. In this
exceeding the prudence, if not the piety of Christians, who make the sword an
Umpire in the smallest differences of Opinion; as if success, (found as great
an assertor of the designs of these Infidells, as ever it has yet appeared in
the favor of Saints) could be able to bear so great a stresse, as the weight
of Religion, on which depends Salvation, not possibly to be brought about by
the wicked Engines, daily employed by Princes and men in power, to keep Victory
fastened to their Tentdoors: It being the Sufferings, not the Valor of our
Champion CHRIST, that can enroll us in the Heavenly Host: For though weda e not
give success to Fortune, any more than we are able to wrest her out of the
hand of God; yet we find by experience, that the wheels of her Chariot are
too weak, durty, and unsteddy, for Truth to triumph in, much less to be made
captive to any others Interpretation than her own.

54 And though the paint of Religion is the ordinary Charm that raises the
impetuous spirits of the people into storms (by which they can sooner destroy
others than save themselves; no reparations being to be procured but out of
their own purses, who may far easier change their Masters, then find better)
yet is Blood very unsuitable to the taste of true Religion, which participates
more of the Lamb, than the Lion, having been ever readier to suffer wrong, then
do it; till the Priests of old, as some think, first, for the Princes sake, and
after for their own, had, not only taught her the art of Juggling, but made her
so tetchey by the corroding doctrines they instil'd into men's consciences, upon
the least wordly occasion, that brought their Honor or Profit under question;
far repugnant to the first intent of Religion, which was to set a bar against
strife, and all other unnatural desires, men, without the awe of God, are apt
to fall into; Oppression being a general mischief, all are liable to, either
in childhood or old age: This brought Government into use among such as had
felt the heavy experiment of Anarchy; to avoid which nothing contributes more
than Unity in Religion, and where that cannot be compassed without much strife,
a Liberty to profess what opinions men please, provided they be not repugnant
to the general welfare.

54. Wherefore Mahumet and his successors, the better to gain the love of the
people to Religion, tempered it with so much moderation, as it rather enclines
to Hope than Fear; wisely foreseeing, that nothing makes Subjects recoile more
from their Obedience, than when they are loaded with a conceit that their
Governors lead them in the way to Hell. This gives me occasion to think, that
the Goblings armed by the Catholics with so much terror, may possibly like the
Elephants of Pyrrhus fall foul upon themselves, and bring their Religion into
a low contempt, through an apparent detection, or a panick fear; not so likely
to attach the Creed of the Turks, who have no painting to communicate any thing
subject to gather so much dross, as might inform the people, they are but the
effects of humane Art; nor Priests that dare be so bold as to put a greater
Excise upon the sins of the people, or the price of Heaven, then stands with
the convenience or Reason of State. Thus are the Turkish Soldiers bred in no
less Obedience than Valor; which are indeed the most saving Articles of their
Belief; and though undervalued by, us that expect after death a less carnal
Heaven; yet nothing causes their Unity more, or is a greater provocation to
augmentation of Empire, then the conformty held by their Priests in the
inculcation of their Doctrine, not perplexing their consciences with useless
terrors or hard questions; making no sins so damnable as Cowardice and
Disobedience to the Commands of their Leaders; Eying Christians with a high
disdain, for casting so many doubts, and bushing the way to Heaven with
Purgatory and other Bugbeares, which they place in the dark Entry, all are to
pass between this world and the next: Though a blind man may see, it is not
consonant either to the belief of Prince or Priest: And these Chimera's are
thought, by the Mahumetans, to intimidate Soldiers, by making them Atheists,
and so in hope of no better; or superstitious, which keeps them still in
expectation of a worse: This people being no less hardened with Discipline,
against the pleasures of this, than assured by Doctrine, they shall enjoy the
same and greater in the world to come: according to an ordinary saying among
them: That if Christians carried the same opnins concerning Heaven in their
Hearts, as are every where found in their Books, they would not be so afraid of
Death the only way thither.

56. The Turks esteem Fate inexorable; which steeles their foreheads no less
against the sharpest danger, than it smooths them toward the severest
Discipline; yet in the midst of this belief, admit a necessary use of Prayer:
As if importunity could be any way prevalent, where an unchangeable Resolution
is acknowledged. It cannot be denied, there is a wide room left for giving
Thanks, and praising God, for disposing things so much to our advantage; but
this perhaps cannot so seasonably be done till his will be revealed.

57. Images, reverenced in Christian Churches, bar the doors against both Turk
and Jew; who count us worse than Canibals for eating our God, as they say we
do in the Eucharist: a scandal we owe to the Court of Rome.

58. Notwithstanding the incomparable strength of this Lion, you may find all
his Treaties lined with the fur of a Fox, not tying himself up so straight by
Promise or Obligation, but that he has still a muse open to break through upon
any great advantage: And in this he is not a little beholding to the manner of
his Style, always fuller of hyperbolicall Civilities than real Assurances:
yet rather than leave his Repute under the reproach of a broken Faith, he lays
the fault upon the Mistake of some Minister of State, by whose blood he
expungeth all stains of Dishonor, not leaving them legible by any of his own,
but such as have learned to decypher the Character of Princes, who are but few
in this well composed Government, and those comfortably employed in public
Service, or decently laid by, for prevention of mischief: It remaining past
peradventure, That such as have Heads apt for Counsel, may, upon a Discontent,
find Hearts as apt for Rebellion.

59. Though this Monarch, if he stands right in his Subjects esteem, is not
very solicitous after Repute from Strangers; yet, by reason of his vast Power,
he is not often necessitated to tread such base paths, as our weaker Princes
are forced to walk in, that have for the most part nothing but Shifts to
subsist by; which like Mines under the walls of Towns, bring more prejudice
than gain, if they come to be discovered by the contrary party; from which it
is not easy to conceal them, if once they are flown out of the bosom that
hatched them: such folly and falsehood is bound up in the hearts of Ambassadors.
Besides the frequent Perjury of Princes has so vilified the pri^^ of Oaths,
as they serve for little more than Ceremony of State, and to bait traps for
their poor Subjects and other weak and ill-advised Strangers. Which may give
an occasion for an Enquiry, that since all men cannot agree, Whether a
Toleration of their several Religions may not be with more Charity admitted,
then every one persecuted, as we find they are in one place or other? And
because one God is universally owned, all Protestations should be taken under
that single Name, without any other addition; many bearing an awful reverence
to That, who look upon the rest as products of Policy, and therefore leave room
for such mental reservations as the Priests, no less then the Grandees have
too long abused the world withal. And till a reverence, still begun at the
Head, be real, or unapprehensibly feigned, it is folly to expect performance
of Oaths in the Members. This arraignes all Princes of madness, that rest
secure upon the Fidelity of their Subjects, after they have forfeited their own
by illegal and exorbitant Taxes. Nor is Perjury found so frequently amongst
those esteemed Infidels, as our dry Professors, that have Religion still in
their mouths, and the Bible in their Eye; Not that a practice of holy Duties
can possibly be more the reason of Falsehood in the one, than Profanesse, of
Truth in the other; But having made themselves more familiar with the Mercy,
than Justice of God, and presuming upon the certainty of their own Salvation,
and Damnation of others, for which they have no better warrant than the voice
of a Spirit, conjured up only in their Imaginations; the more to be suspected,
because it befriends no other interest but their own, they think to make God
amends some other way; whereas a poor Sinner, that has once been hunted home
with the fierce conflicts of a wearied Conscience (sharper far than the Humili
ations, these outward Professors proportion to themselves (dares not venture on
so dear an Impiety, out of hope to digest it the next Fast. And if I am not
much mistaken, the Turks bear a more awful reverence to Oaths, than
Christians ^or are they found to allay it with the poisonous mixture of
AEquivocation, though the Jews that live among them are more indifferent what
they attest. A sad thing, that such as were formerly, and those that are now
the people of God, should exceed Infidels in so foul and unsociable an
Impiety. Which that they may the better prevent; Though the bare attestation of
a Mussleman, or Turkish Believer is often taken for an authentic Proof
against a Stranger; Yet in their ordinary Trialls between one another, they
proceed with more Caution, so as not to rely upon Oaths themselves; but from
private Examinations, and Questions so unexpected and artificially put, as no
premeditated Combination can evade, they extract grounds for Sentence: By
which, malice is defeated, and perjury prevented, frequent amongst us, where
the Lives and Estates of conscientious people are without remedy exposed to
their mercy, who scruple not the calling God to the witness of a Lie. Nor can
there be imagined any better way how to avoid this mischief, or yield a sincere
and faithful Obedience to the Precept of our Savior, Swear not at all, etc.
(which the corrupt glosses of Expositors labor much, though all in vain, to
elude) then, if, instead of that slight and irreverent manner of Swearing, or
rather prostituting the Word of God to the kiss of impure lips, according to
the loose custom of all our Courts of Judicature, the Judges themselves, or
those appointed for that purpose, would take the pains, by the touchstone of
a diligent scrutiny, and scrupulous examination of Witnesses apart, to
distinguish the pure and golden Truth, from the baser Alchimy of the most
cunningly-forged Falsehood.

60. They prefer Christianity so far, as no Jew can turn Turk till he has
been Christened: The vulgar thinking God best pleased with such a gradation,
though Authority interjected this Ceremony to fence them against a too great
concourse of this subtle people, who in relation to Circumcision, are apter to
embrace their Religion then ours; and do by their Conversion lessen the profit
arising from them as Jews. Now least the Impiety of casting blocks in the way
of Proselytes should seem to relate only to this so much abominated Nation, I
desire to be informed, if there be not a Law in force here, at the Jews being
in England, as there is still in some other Nations, That such of them as
turned Christians, should loose all, or the greatest part of what they had. For
which this pious reason was given, That many remained Jews still in their
hearts, notwithstanding an outward profession: Thus a greater Hypocrisy
cheated the less.

61. I find them, though constant to their own, yet so indulgent to the
opinions of Strangers, as to afford such a safe pass among them: which,
besides the profit it brings to Commerce, keeps them in so moderate a temper,
as the plague of Hypocrisy (which like an Iron-mole, stains, and in a short
time eats out the purity of Religion, by acting a sublimer impiety than the
nature of man unsuborned through Ambition or Covetousness, is able to make
real, longer than a Fanatic heat inspires it) has not yet there broke out
farther than among some few particulars; though by such the Cockatrice of
Civil War is ordinarily disclosed in the Bosoms of Christians, concluding
all damned which rest not in their Expositions and Customs, how ridiculous
soever: Not considering the mischief they do, that remove old uncertain
Errors, before they have found as certain Truths to put in their room. The
same may be said of reputed inconveniences; such as is their conniving at
Courtesans (chiefly done to prevent Adultery, Sodomy, and B stiality; sins
infesting these hot Countries therefore) possibly less abominable than some
Divines make it. This sort of Cattle being as ancient as the Patriarch Judah:
Neither did diverse others, looked upon as men after Gods own heart, blush to
keep droves of them: Nay, if some be not foulely out in their Expositions, they
are reckoned to David in the Bill of Gods Blessings: And he that does by this
public sin, as some have done by Religion, exchange it for a worse (though
perhaps more solitary) I pray what has the Nation left to brag of? Faults of
greater privacy, though less natural, increasing Hypocrites more than Saints.
And if our Blessed Savior should now speak to the Consciences of men, as he
did to the Jews, He that is without sin, etc. I believe Fornication would
escape, whatever became of Adultery. To conclude this point, it is so much the
greater boldness, to add to, than diminish from the severity of God, as we
stand more in need of his Mercy than Justice.

62. The gross of their Revenue is employed in securing the Empire at home, or
fetching Victory from abroad: The Grand Segnior being only luxurious in Women,
and domestic pleasures; which like Fontanels in the body, may possibly
evaporate worse humors than they foment: Though contrary to the better
inculcated, than practiced Doctrine of our Theologues, especially those of the
Church of Rome; Catholic Kings rather conniving at this mischief, than the
perpetual inconveniences resulting from a married Clergy, who by giving their
Children better breeding than Estates, are the cause they do not seldom fall
into exorbitances.

63. REpute has swelled the Sultan's power to such a vast Monstrosity, and so
far dazzled the eyes of Christian Princes, weakened by divisions in Religion,
that they dare not look upon him without a Present; Neither is the Persian much
bolder, which gives him the advantage, no less than honor to be still on the
offensive: And in this the generosity he uses, to divulge the Prince, if not
the place he means next to attacque, turns more to his advantage, than may
appear to every eye; other Nations resting so secure upon this, as they do
not provide, if at all, a defense proportionable to the danger; which if once
made ready, could not be laid out to a more probable advantage for themselves
and Christendom, than in stopping the progress of this Polyphaemus, who is
likely, if not prevented by some civil Rupture, to devour all the Italian
Principalities, if once he ravish the Venetian, whose hands have been weakened
by the longest War that ever any single State maintained against this
Monster, who for want of assistance, cannot choose but shortly yield up Candy
to his Lust: And then our drousy Princes, who were no more affected with her
Cries, than wakened by the noise of her Canon, and the voice of Prudence daily
roaring in their ears, shall lament their Error, and curse themselves, and
the Counsel that moved them to observe this unnatural Neutrality, and to
prefer a little pleasure they take in gratifying the envy they have ever
borne to this more magnificent Republic (tied by all reason to maintain the
smaller States of Italy in being) before the assuring of their fears by a
cordial combining against this common enemy, of whose mercy they can have no
hope; Nothing being more suitable to his former procedure, or future security,
than utterly to eradicate them, long looked upon by him as the only obstructers
of his farther progress into Christendom; Though apparently known, that what
the Venetians do, is rather by the strength of their Heads, than Hands, having
not yet made themselves very famous for Valor, participating not so much of
the Lion, as Fox, with whose skin most of their Achievements are found to be
lined; being themselves, if fools in any thing, in the excessive awe they
stand of Death, the cause they employ Strangers. Neither is it a less wonder,
that France, Spain, and other potent Nations, do daily pass by greater
affronts received from the Ottoman Empire, without the least notice taken, then
they are observed to fight for among themselves; as if nothing could be
dishonorable or unsafe, but what arises from the injuries of men of the same
Religion; an argument of as great Imprudence, as Impiety, especially resulting
from the Omission, if not Commission of the Court of Rome: For did the Jesuits
and other active Priests turn the tide of their Policy (which has already
immerged Europe in blood) toward the Turks, they might soon be overflown by as
great a deluge of Schisms, as we are now plunged in: But the fear of losing
the Bird in hand, makes the Pope unwilling to employ his Engines for the taking
of this: Not considering that the Mahumetan profession is grown up to as high
an earthly Felicity, Universality, and Consent, as the Papacy; Neither do they
want as great an Antiquity for some of their Tenets, the which if they once
come to be washed over by the varnish of Learning, the Mufty may, assisted by
his Master's force, turn his Holiness out of Rome, as that Bishop did the
Emperors; and so avenge Europe and Asia both, for the rent the subtle Priests
made between the East and the West Churches?, for no more religious respect,
than to beautify their own habit and increase their Power.

And if the Virgin City of Venice comes to be wholly prostituted to the lust of
this Monster, who has already entangled his Sword in one of her strongest
Locks, it is possible the Catholic King shall not be able long to enjoy those
Concubinary Principalities, made his by no juster Contract, than the
Procuration of his Chaplain, the Pope, his own Subtilty, and the impertinent
Quarrels of less advised Neighbors: But to give the Pope his due (looked upon
by the dazzled eyes of our Zelots, for a more terrible Devil than it may be he
is, were he confined within a narrower Circle, in relation to temporal power)
Christian Princes are apt to take so much advantage from the harping irons,
Luther, Calvin, and other Divines (perhaps better skilled in subverting Errors,
than reconciling of Truth) have fastened in the sides of this Ecclesiastical
Leviathan, not to be kept floating in a narrower Sea, than that of Rome,
(formerly as Magisteriall in things temporal, as now she remains in
spirituals, which prudence might manage to as universal a tranquillity, as
appeared in the days of Augustus) that he has no leisure to look abroad, for
fear the same Spirit that troubled the waters in Germany, should dry up those
in Italy, etc. It being in the power of every Prince to cut the banks of the
Church, which in France is the fear of Schism, and in the Catholic King's
Dominions, the Inquisition. Yet in case his Holiness should make it a cordial
endeavor to foment a League against the Turk, France and Spain would fall out
who should head it, and endeavor to spoil the others Subjects in the mean
time: Such incomparable Charity resides among Christian Princes, that value
Religion no higher than the profit it brings: so as the Roman Bishop, with all
his Emissaries, have full employment by adding and taking away, to keep the
scales even between these two tottering Princes, and to heighten their spirits
against England, and other Nations at enmity with Rome; least we should have a
Great Turk of our own, that is, an Universal Monarch, under whose absolute
power the Pope and all other Christian Princes could expect no higher places
than those of Vassals. And though a Combination were feasible, small advantage
would accrue; since every considerable confederate must have a General of
their own; from whence would proceed more Cry than Wool, by perplexing
Counsels with contrary commands: Because, if it were probable Kings should so
far forget their Honor, as to lay down all disputes about precedence, yet
their particular Interest could not but remember them, that the strength
designed against the Turk, might, after success, recoile upon themselves: not
without a president in Story: and therefore not likely to employ any other in
Chief, but their own Subjects. And what contrary affections, ends, and
endeavors are covered under a Force patched up of so many Nations, is manifest
in the Maritime battle of Lepanto: where, though the desire of all might be to
ecclips the Ottoman Moon; yet it was in many so faint, as they could not endure
it should be removed quite out of its Sphere, or lose the Interest it does
exercise within the Christian Pale (which by a through persecution of that
naval victory, might easily have been brought about) out of fear, the greater
Princes, by that secured, should after have made it their endeavor to devour
the less: And this (with some Un brages of Jealousies the Catbolick King had of
his Brother Don John of Austria) made the Confederates return without doing
more than show the Grand Segnior wherein he was defective, and by this
chastizing to make him mend the fault he had committed in being no better
provided of Commanders and Provisions for Sea, which he has since repaired at
our cost, by maintaining an Arcenall in Algeers, of which the King of Spain
denied his Brother to be Governor; so jealous are Christians one of the other,
that they have more confidence in Turks, than those of their own Religion: yet,
to speak Gods troth, whosoever shall command an Army against this Epidemicall
Enemy, with such success as Don John had, will be owner of too popular an
Honor, to be less than superlative wherever he comes; and therefore liable,
like him, to receive a Fig out of the venomous hand of Jealousy. Which
warrants me to think, the fittest for such an employment as the heading an Army
raised by a League, is the Pope, who lying within gunshot himself, is the
most likely to take the truest aim at the finishing of the work: But this the
Lutherans and Protestants would oppose, no less than the Princes of Italy, who
cannot but fear, that the power of the Ottoman Family being sufficiently
moderated, he could have no better employment for the Army, than to face them
with it, looked upon perhaps in his esteem, as greater enemies: Yet if there
were an unity in Religion, and a total abatement of his Holiness pretenses to
any secular power, farther than the extent of Peter's Patrimony, it might with
more probability be brought about, than any temporal Prince is able to give
caution for: And thus Policy might not only make use of him, in opposing the
Turk, but in reconciling such Kings, as when they are weary of their
inconsiderat Quarrels, know no other way to bring about peace, than by the
mediation of the Bishop of Rome. But as things now stand, Experience has
taught us how vain a Composition of Force is, in the attempt of moderating the
Ottoman Grandeur: Nor is any Prince yet in a capacity to undertake him alone;
The Emperor being shackled by the links of contrary Opinions, and now utterly
disabled since the Swedes Ineursion: I confess, the Catholic King, upon whose
skirts he sits, were the most likely to get ground upon the Turks Dominions,
did not the French perplex him with the fear of losing his own: Between which
Nations there can be no reconciliation, so long as the Pope's greatness is
supported by Division; An Universal Monarchy in Europe being more against the
grain of the Court of Rome, than it yet apprehends danger from that in Asia;
so as it is no improbable Paradox to maintain, That the Turk by accident
supports his Holiness: And if the Pope and Inquisition were put down, Atheism
would break in like a Torrent; or, which is worse, Religion would be divided
into such destructive, bloody, and hypocritical streams, as her name would be
quite lost in the dilatation, or render her professors as odious as ever they
were to the Heathen Emperors: especially since she has in all places, and
under every profession, learned of Ambition to lay out the price of her
Salvation in a field of blood, without respect had to Covenants, Oaths,
Allegiance, or the most natural and obliging Relations; therefore formidable
to Kings, whose single and open bosoms render them a fair mark, not only to
the forked Tongues, but the venomous-tempered Steel of an exasperated Zeal;
so, not likely to be entertained in any place, but where her own Sword shall be
able to bid her welcome: The Beauty of Holiness, with which she was wont to
allure Proselytes, being now shrivel'd into ugliness, by her frequent
application of the sublimated paint of Hyporisy; so generally observed among
Christians, as neither the Turk, or any other Mahumetan Nation can, in
Prudence, if in Piety, barter their Faith for ours; The drought of whose
Charity has obstructed the means of Conversion in relation to all Forraigners
not formerly engaged by Birth and Education: so as no probability resides in
any endeavor can be used to tempt the Turks from Mahumet, unless (as I
hinted before) some Jesuit were able to personate his Ghost, and proclaim
himself risen, according to their Prophet's long-delay'd promise: for such an
one might possibly prevail so far upon the Rabble, as to make them fall foul
among themselves: A breach in Religion being found by experience the readiest
way to let in that Ocean of Calamities, we see overflows the Kingdoms of the
Earth.

Another Expedient may lie in supporting such Cedars of State, as are marked
out for ruin by the Fears or Fury of the Prince; and if possible, to give
shelter to some of the younger Royal Branches, who are sure upon their
Father's death to be sacrificed to the security of the elder; and may, as
occasion serves, facilitate a Rebellion, by landing an Army able to make good
the Field, whilst the Snowball is gathering: A project most convenient for the
Wisdom and Situation of Venice, were she owner of the Power and extent of
Territory belonging to old Rome, whose Heir she deserves best to be, since she
alone retains more of her Freedom than all the known world besides is able to
produce: Her Government being built on such rational, if not infallible
Miximes, as might bear the weight of a far greater frame, if Italy were wise
enough to see it; who need not be concubinary to so many wanton desires of
Strangers, would all her small and newhatched Governments shelter themselves
under her wings, who are known to spend more severally in hiring of Peace from
the Turk, Spaniard, Pope, etc. than wisely laid out in an entire sum, would
purchase the power to command it.

From whence may be concluded, If the Grand Segmor do not fall through his own
weight, he may live to see Europe under as great a thraldom in every relation
to body and soul, as Turkey, unless he be cordially opposed at his own door:
Tyrants, like Dogs, having their fierceness, rather whetted than rebated by a
defensive opposition: whereas he that breaks resolutely in upon them, makes
them not seldom take their heels: All changes in such an extremity being
looked upon with delight and affection at home, by those that abroad would die
to extend the same Government over others: Oppression being so odious to
Subjects, as all will upon any probable advantage promote its destruction to
the very persons that share in their desires with the Monarch, wanting the
power more than the will to perpetrate the like degree of injustice themselves.

64. The Turk deduceth this Doctrine out of the perfidiousnesse of the
Christian Practice, That it is to little purpose (by reason of the contrary
pretenses of Princes) to make leagues Offensive and Defensive, which he has
seldom done; yet considers his Neighbors dangers as his own, before delay
has rendered them incurable; Apparent in the large offers he made to Venice,
whilst she lay under the interdict of Paul the fifth; and might, if her Subjects
had not been wiser, through civil divisions have lapsed into the hands of
Spain, as diverse Nations less prudent have done, by their own folly and a
stupid patience of their neighbors, whose ordinary custom is to forbear
giving assistance, till it is rendered unseasonable, and that they are not able
to redeem them by all their endeavors, much less by a too late repentance; as
in the case of Navarr, neglected by the Crown of France; and Ditchy of Loraine,
by that of Spain: Any Augmentation to one of these Kingdoms being an equal
Diminution from the other; the consideration of which keeps Geneva in being.
And the averseness the Turk has toward any strict Confederation with
Forraigners, gives him not only the liberty to preserve his friends, but to
take any advantage to enlarge himself: His Subjects not having such vast
Estates abroad, as might deter him from taking a revenge in case of injury,
for fear of an Embargement: whereas Christians have Warehouses in
Constantinople full of wealth, and to such a value, as give this Infidel
caution for his using us at his pleasure without danger: Nor have we more than
the Emperors bare word to secure our Trade, which it is likely you may tell
me, he observes as religiously as other Princes.

Neither is he prodigal in Ambassadors: for, keeping still the offensive end of
the Staff, he is often sued to, but seldom sends a wooing for Peace; which
obtained is found of no longer life than it suits with the occasions and
counsels of both parties: Therefore Consederations, Truces, and Leagues,
signify nothing but danger to the weaker side, who by these are not seldom
tempted to neglect the guard that cannot in prudence be lessened upon this
score, it being an insallible certainty, that nothing moves another, but
Profit, Honor, or Nature; The last of which does less concern the Grand
Segnior, because he seeks not to match his Daughters out of his own
Territories, esteeming no blood Royal, but what runs in his own veins, and
his that is to succeed him: Neither is he lycorish after the choice of the
Issue of Kings for his own Bed, finding the same content in the embraces of a
Subject or a Slave, that a more bewitched Imagination apprehends in those of a
Princess: Nor does his modesty abuse him, but acquits him from the danger of
having a Spy in his Bosom, or a coequall in his Counsels; giving him leave
to put to death or exchange his Wives upon occasion, without the fear of any
other frown but that of Heaven; amongst whose joys (according to his Creed) is
Change of Women, and all carnal Delights.

And by the division he makes of his Love among many Wives, he renders the
Government lesse-factious; the Distaffe having been found no friend to the
Scepter, opening often a back door to Innovation; apparent in Christians, who
Marrying the daughters of more potent Princes than themselves, are so far
overawed by them, as to make them partners in their most secret designs, else
they are able to distress them through the strength of their own friends. Thus
a Prince comes to have an Enemy in his bosom, and such an one as he dares not
question, for fear of a shower at home and a storm from abroad. So as if all
the benefit Story can record to have (at least of late) accrued to Kings from
the great Allies of their Wives, were put together, you shall find it
inconsiderable, computed with the loss, especially if their Religion differs;
for then she looking upon him as out of the reach of Gods mercy, can think
nothing an injury to his person, or a loss to his estate, if her ghostly
fathers are pleased to encourage her; Considerations without bottom in this
conformity in Profession, and parity in Subjection; where the birth of the
first Son gives the title of Sultana to a slave, the highest honor or
employment a woman can be borne to: and what might abundantly content them also
in Europe, where they are made the Arbitrators of the Royal Line.

65. The Emperor appears not in Public, but on Horseback, where all
Deformityes, if he owes any, are best concealed; And is then in such Splendour:
as the former-ingaged opinion of the multitude renders him more than Humane
whereas our less Majestic Princes become so cheap by their daily figging up
and down the streets after their pleasures unattended, whilst this graver
Monarch enjoyes them all under his own roof: where none are suffered to enter,
but those that are dumb from their Births, or are rendered so through fear or
use; no action or word breathed out of the Seraglio, to the Emperors
disadvantage, but proves mortal to the divulger: Not possible to be observed
among Christians, whose Meals, like Puppet-playes, are made the object of all
eyes, and their lightest Discourses (apt then to break out) the scorn of
Strangers, that blow them over the four corners of the earth, with no small
addition; whilst their own Subjects calculate a crooked nature from the
Deformities of their Bodies, evil Gestures, or a too luxurious taking in of
their Wine or Meat: It not being easy to show a man at a greater disadvantage,
than whilst he is taking his Repast, the most certain Symbol of Mortality This
altogether cast; no less cloud over their Majesty, than their Cheats and
Perjuries, to procure Money, are observed to do upon their Probity: which
raises such a damp of Contempt about the Throne, as the Obedience they own,
proceeds rather from a dread of their present power, than any voluntary or
natural affection their Subjects bear to them or their virtues; of which they
have so low esteem, as they think them easy to be matched, if not by
themselves, by a number their Commerce and Experience has coped withal.

66. In Progress his Train is not inferior to an Army; in which he receives
all graciously that come to see him: And by this Strength and Affability the
remotest parts are not only wooed to Obedience, but terrified from
Insurrections; calculating by the Power attending him in his Pleasures, the
terriblenesse of a Force that should be raised in his Fury: Notwithstanding at
this time nothing appears about him but Love in his words, and Charity in his
actions; For where he sees the earth covered with Poor, he casts his Money,
which, like water put into a Pump, gives him the opportunity safely to drein
the more affluent Rich. This makes the Generality look upon him as a God, that
may give way to Punishment, never to Passion.

67. He owns not in his Royal Person any ungrateful Imposition, but appears
ever before his people like the Sun; carrying in his looks no less Serenity
than Splendor in all about him; and answers any clamours of Joy with as
cordial Blessings and Thanks: knowing it as uncomely for a Prince in public
to seem angry, as poor; That threatening no less danger to the Lives, than This
does presage incroachment upon the Fortunes of all that come to see him. And
though none can more freely command what belongs to his Subjects, he discovers
no will to employ any Arbitrary power in his own person, how well so ever it
suits with his Nature or Occasions; Handling all Grievances to his people by
the mediation of others, whom upon emergency he delivers up to their Fury.
Neither does this lessen the number of these Harpies, any more than it does
Conjurers, to hear their Predecessors were torn in pieces by the command of
those they had formerly nourished with their Blood. Thus by such amiable
gestures, and the high price he seems in public to set upon the Nations
content, so great a Love is kindled in the hearts of his Subjects, that all the
evils that fall upon them are removed from the principal cause, and
attributed to such as are only isntrumental in their promotion. A practice
waved by our less advised Monarchs, who sit in Parliament, as Jupiter is
painted, with Thunder in their hands, as if they had already the will and
power, and wanted nothing but their peoples consent to make them miserable; not
affording a grateful concession, but by the high and rugged way of Exchange;
nor good words, but to usher in a more chargeable Request; scorning to reckon
with the Subject, and make even for their Minions and Officers Faults, till
they are so far run in the account of Prejudice, that all Love and Obedience is
quite forfeited, and the Crown exposed to the purchase of any that has the
subtilty and power to buy it.

68. For to obviate the like miscarriage, the Turk gives often a favorable
hearing to such as complain of the Grandees, not seldom gratifying them with
the Heads of their Oppressors: By which he does not only stop the mouths of his
people with a show of Piety and Justice, but fills his Exchecquer with the
real Coin he finds about those thus complained of: Yet if he takes the party's
Life to be more considerable to his affairs than his Death, he satisfies the
public discontent, by translating the Offender to some remoter employment,
where, being farther from the Court, severity may be more necessary, at least
not so dishonorable, as when it appears at the foot of his Chair: Thinking it
not safe, to gall the many-headed Monster twice in a Place, with one and the
same Engine. And by this even and constant procedure, an uninterrupted
Prosperity has been intailed to this Empire, that the voice of Liberty
continues still such a stranger in their streets, as if their Language were
barren of a word to express it. Thus by claiming nothing, he enjoyes all, and,
by defending none of his bad Instruments, has been secure himself, till these
latter years, in which some Constellation seems to hover over the World,
inclining all Nations to Rebellion. This imboldens me to assert it as a Maxim,
That Princes contract more hatred from the injustice and oppressions of their
Favorites, than their own: A far less Revenue, than does legally depend on
a Crown, being able to correspond for a greater sum, than the follies of a
single person can possibly consume, unless attached by the bottomless humor
of Play, which a prudent Prince cannot choose but look upon as far below the
dignity of his person; it being impossible for him either to win or lose, but
at the prejudice of his Courtiers or Subjects.

69. Here is no medium between the Anger of the Sultan and Death: A great man
flayed out of Office, being rarely or never permitted to mingle among the
people, who are easily suborned out of pity, to believe such persecuted for
their sakes: Therefore Discontent is not suffered to live; the Power being as
severely punished, as the Will to do Mischief: This makes the Grandees to carry
their bodies swimming between Popularity, and an Epidemicall Dislike: since
though the first be the most certain messenger of Death, yet the latter does
not seldom bring the same errand; For, such as by Taxes or perverting of
Justice (though by the Emperors command) are found abusers of the people, die
some cruel death, to give the more public satisfaction; whereas those who
fall under his Jealousy, in relation to his particular safety, leave the world
by a less painful Exit; which may breed an opinion in the Multitude, That
their Prince is only cruel on their behalf, and at the worst but severe in his
own. Here the vanity of Court Minions is manifest, who like Beasts for
Sacrifice, are crowned and honored, till their Masters sins require their
blood to set him right in the opinion of the people; in the fury of whom lies
all the Hell, the Religion of most Princes teaches them to apprehend.

70. THe Priests scrue up to the height of Miracles all unusual Contingencies,
which make not a few in such a Mass of Events; neither is their Report wanting
to augment them: And these are still hanged before the eyes of the People,
either to terrify or allure them, as it suits with the present humor of State.
And thus the Popish Legend came to be gilded by so many miraculous effects of
Saints, and their Relics, which, after all contradiction was buried, appeared
to the world under no less then a cloud of witnesses: Being capable of no
stronger confutation, than what they receive from a present incapacity of doing
the like. Now if the Turks have been too numerous in their election, or
hyperbolical in the predication of these pious, or rather useful deceits, the
error is committed after the example of the Court of Rome, the most exact Copy
for Policy the world affords. Nor is there place left for blame in relation to
either, since what was obtruded upon the Catholics heretofore, suited as well
the apprehensions of those times, as these do now the Turks: Therefore the
Imprudence lies not in the folly of the Miracles, but theirs, who suffered such
a critical Learning to blaze out, as pretends matter of Reproof in all things
extant: Knowledge being as great an enemy to our present felicity, as it was to
that in Paradise: So as Rome is forced at this day to let Miracles fall, out of
fear to find her self detected by the now-supernumerany issue of tatling
Apollo, which, out of too much Wit, or too little Faith, make an over-strict
scrutiny into their Truth; hanging like Locusts, and croaking like Frogs, about
all things that seem green or rotten in the Church: Nor will they fall off,
till their mouths be stopped by Preferment, or their heads satisfied with
Reason: Yet had she but enough of the first, it might suffice to purchase a
competent proportion of the latter, or at worst so much Sophistry as might
serve her turn: But the ancient Piety being blended in Luxury, and her Revenue
in a great proportion swallowed up by the covetousness of Princes; the Pope
and Clergy hold the Remainder by no better Tenure than by rendering themselves
necessary to the ambition of Monarchs, especially that of Spain; Republiques
being naturally not so auspicious to the Priesthood. Nevertheless, lest the
Catholic King should attain to an absolute power in Christendom, under which
his Holiness would be totally ecclipsed, his principal endeavor has been to
foment a difference still between him and France, and so by their banding to
keep himself up in play; Shifts the Church was never put to, during the Golden
Age of Ignorance, when Learning and all Books lay at her mercy; so as she had
power to cut them shorter, or extend their sense as best fitted the occasion:
The Laity being so perplexed between the hope of Heaven, and fear of Hell,
that the dark entry of Death gave the Priests as opportune a way to become
their Executors, as the bloody night of the Passover did the Jews to rob the
Egyptians. But now in the absence of the ancient Piety and Ignorance, the
Church of Rome has no better way to keep Reason from breaking in upon her (who
like a Woolfe has, this last Century, lain gnawing at the Pope's Honor and
Profit) than by sacrificing more men yearly to the fury of the Inquisition,
than Solomon did Beasts at the dedication of the Temple: An Impiety not
chargable upon the Turk, who kills none for the profession of any Religion,
though never so contrary to his own; leaving God to avenge his Truth, which no
question he would not be long in doing, were he so angry with the opposite
Tenants, as they in their furious Sermons are pleased to represent him.

71. The Turk finding Printing and Learning the chief fomentors of Livisions in
Christendom, has hitherto kept them out of his Territories. Yet, whilst wet
tire out our best time in tugging at the hard Text of a dry Book, or the study
of strange Languages (which are but the Bindings of Learning, and do often
cover less Knowledge, than may be had in our own Ideom) they come more adapted
into State-employments, and sooner furnished with clearer Reason, drawn from
the quicker Fountains of lesse-erring Experience; And were rever yet found to
be out-reached in Prudence, by the most politic and learned Princes in Europe.
Nor can any think this strange, that considers what the custom of Universities
requires at the hands of Students, viz. knowledge in the Arts so called, and a
nimble mouthing of canting Terms, coined by themselves, and so current in the
commerce of no larger Understandings than their own, and such as are sworn to
the same Principles: The vanity of which is in nothing more apparent than in
this, that they can easier start ten Errors, than kill one, as is manifest in
the differences between us and Rome; concerning which, though in right reason
we do, and cannot but agree in many things, yet the heat and rancour of the
dispute is no whit abated.

72. All Sciences any ways resembling those we call Liberal, are taught no
where but in the Seraglio, where the Grand Segnior has the power to increase
or diminish the number of their Professors, according as it suits his
occasions. Able men resembling wanton Boys, that, rather than be unemployed,
will do mischief; None attaining to any perfection but what he has use for:
Idle Valor being the tool, as Learning and Knowledge are the operators of all
Civil Dissentions. A course quite contrary to the ill husbandry of Europe, or
more particularly England, in whose Body Mercury and Sulphur exceed Employment,
which should be the Salt to fix the rest, and keep them from putrefaction: For
want of which her Schools do man out as many Enemies as Friends, legible in
the vast volumes of Controversies that lie vendible on every Stall. This
results from the multitude of Grammer-Schooles (in the building of which
appears more Zeal than Knowledge) where all come that are but able to bring a
Bag and a Bottle, no unfit Emblem of the future poverty of their Trade; In
which, like a Lottery, ten take their chance in Beggary, for one that meets
with a Prize; and that, when it comes, is scarce worth the labor, cost, and
time required in making the^ capable: No men's fortunes being confined in so
narrow a Circle, nor built upon such shaking Foundations, as those of Scholars:
The fire already kindled in Church and State, by their clashing in Opinions,
having melted the Basins and larger Plate, our Ancestors set up for the
encouragement of Learning, which, like a Viper, does now endeavor to eat out
the bowels of her Mother. For the Parents of Schooleboyes not being able to
advance them higher, all the rest is lost but Reading and Writing, and they
rendered by seven or eight years lazy living, incapable of the labor
belonging to the more profitable Plough, and so become Serving men, and
Lawyers, and Justices Clerks; by the virtue of which profession they turn
cunning Knaves, and cozen their Country: A charge circumcised in Turkey, by
mixing the expensive Callings of Law and Divinity together, by which the
Priests are so fully employed, as no leisure is given to study Innovation in
either profession, and consequently dries up the Fountains of Rebellion. Which
foreseen by the prudent eye of the divine Legislator, Moses, directed him to
the uniting of the sacred Rites, and civil Sanctions into one Body, making the
Law of the Land a piece of Gods Law, and the Justice of the Magistrate,
Religion: which stamps no less authority upon the Law, then it procures
Reverence to the Judges, and promises to the Government, where it is
entertained, Length of days and Safety on the one hand, with Riches and Honor
on the other. Which course affords also such Expedition as gives one side, at
least, cause to appland Justice; whereas here the bettered party is left so
little to boast of, that he returns home as ill satisfied, as he which had
Sentence pronounced against him.

73. Neither are these Delays any whit remedyed by the ill-Husbandry of
breeding so many to the long Robe, as are found in England: which excess
springs from the multitude of Pedants that reign among us; who, like Flies,
blow one another in such quantities, over the Nation, as they do not only
supplant those of their own Calling (which is it self were mischief enough)
but infect all Government. Their Scholars, if they arrive to any maturity, at
length turn Academicks, whose Cloystered and Monkish Learning is by Statesmen
looked upon as resembling dead Honey, which is stale, course and less useful,
none being pure and Virginal, but what is sucked from every Flower, that may
be found in the wild field of a general Commerce. For though out of the huge
heap of University-men Providence has snatched such choice Brands, as are able
to illuminate the world yet let these towering Eagles speak sincerely (who like
the Soul of Learning appear above that vast pile of Fathers, Schoolmen,
Linguists, Critick's, etc. heaped up by the Court of Rome, for a Funeral to
all farther enquiry after Truth) and they must tell you, that the least part of
this excellency came from their Mother: The Tongues being at the best but the
Crackers of Knowledge: the Kernel remaining useless, if not bitter and
loathsome, till picked and dressed by Employment and Experience. Nor can this
be admired by such as consider the practice of ordinary Tutors, who throw to
their Pupils the dry Bones, and not the Marrow of Erudition: By which more time
is often consumed in the setting out, than a wise man perhaps would have
thought well spent in the whole Journey.

74. This is not said to bring any water toward the clensing of their hands,
who either have or do intend to imbrue them in the Sacrilegious Spoils of
Colleges, to the utter discouragement of all future Charity; I wish them
rather cut off: For though thousands are found to bury their Talents in the
ocean of Controversies, and an implicit adhering to the writings of the
Ancients (who might possibly err out of no less policy, than the Church of
Rome has since maintained them) yet all ages do afford some that scorn to be
tied up to Patterns. but enrich the world with such new Inventions, as may not
only expiate for the Charge, but the Ignorance of all Foundations.

75. Thus I have shown, that the Turk's want of knowledge in our Learning or
Religion, leaves him neither so Imprudent or Wicked, but that he is able to
promote his own Interest, and willing to make his Subjects so far happy, as
may suit with an Absolute power.

A DISCOVRSE UPON Nicolas Machiavell: OR, An impartial examination of the
justness of the Censure commonly laid upon him.
MACHIAVELL is branded by all, neither can any absolve him quite from Blame:
Yet, considering he was not only an Italian, but a Courtier, few can do less
than admire his bad fortune to see one man inherit, in particular, the mass of
Reproaches, due to all Princes and Statesmen in general; so far as to style,
in way of Contempt, such Machiavellians, who in a truer sense might be termed
Followers of Charles the fifth, Lewis the eleventh, or Henry the seventh. By
this, embracing the bare Apparitions of Virtue and Vice, without observing the
true Substance, which they quite let pass; marking for Blemishes in precedent
times, what Historians note for Prudence, if not Beauty in ours: So as he that
impartially examines the lives of those formerly named (who are yet no
Prodigies in the Nature of Government) may find more Evil, than can be deduced
out of this man's Scaenes, or (for ought we know) the worst of his Thoughts:
Yet they have Wisdom inscribed on their Tombs, by the Penners and Readers of
their Stories, in which they lie quiet under the favor of some elegant
Apology, hitherto denied to Machiavell by ignorant and ungrateful Posterity.

He was Secretary to the State of Florrence, of which he has left an
incomparable History, with other Books so full of Truth, Learning and
Experience, that the hand of Detraction has not been able to asperse them;
only it endeavors to attach some straggling expressions in a small Pamphlet,
called His Prince, which are with far less Charity remembered, than so many
larger and better pieces forgotten.

That he was employed in honorable Embassies, is manifested from Story; And
what umbragious and false Positions Ambassadors Professions oblige them to, the
Transactions of all States abundantly declare: For, as the Italian says, The
best of Women with their Pettyacoats divest their Modesty, to render themselves
more grateful to their Husbands Embraces; So Public Ministers can hardly pay
the endeavors they owe to their Country, without exchanging for worldly
Policy a great part of that Candor which should be current in the more sacred
Commerce of honest and religious men. Nor can any expect less hope of
forgiveness in relation to such as by these oblique means advance the
preservation of God's people, then the Midwives of Egypt may be supposed to
have had, who purchased themselves Houses by such uncertain Protestations, as,
if extended on the Rack of a nice Scrutiny, could not choose but confess, and
appear to all, little better than Lies. Few humane actions can be separated
from the dross of Deceit; only such are of best esteem, as carry the
greatest mixture of Charity; which makes me humbly conceive, this learned man
deserves less censure: since such Princes only as Jerchoam (whose Interest is
always to damnifie others in order to their own preservation) and not their
Instruments, may justly be said to cause Israel to sin.

His was no new Design, but in all ages projected by the most faithful
Historians, who make it their business to personate and represent the
behaviors of Princes, though never so undecent; and did ever purchase the more
applause, according to the greater or less faculty they had to do it to the
life. Neither can the strictest Religion condemn the Speculation of ill,
without betraying her Professors, if not her self: For with what vast
disadvantage should a good David cope with a son of Belial, were there not
prudent Hushai's to countermiae the Insidies of wicked Ahitophels, and to learn
men in power the art to catch their wily Neighbors in their own Traps? Nor
do we find his Directions shunned in a less public Commerce than that of
Princes, since it lies not out of the way of Instance to prove, some sharp
inveyers against Machiavell have attained to Church-Preferments, under the
favor of worse or the same Principles, Alexander the sixth ascended to the
Papacy.

Do any lay obscenity to the charge of Albertus, or is he not rather styled the
Great, for having so plainly set open the Closet of Nature? If any sort of men
have reason to tax this Author, they are only Kings and Persons in power: For
as it is the Custom of light women, imperiously to blame all broad expressions
of what they captivate their Servants affections by; so Statesmen may with more
show of Justice, complain of the publication of such Axioms, that being
undiscovered, their use might be with more secrecy and success.

Neither does any greater Reproach redound to him from such as pervert them to
the prejudice of others, than to a Fencer, if his Scholars make use of his
skill in the destruction of their Friends: It being only his aim to teach them
how to guard themselves, and resist other that shall, contrary to the Laws of
God, Nature, and Probity, endeavor to assault them.

Ignorance and lack of Experience in the Customs of other Nations are the
Parents of these spurious Censures; for had they been where he writ, these
Documents would be no more admired, than the most monstrous of those Chinnes we
observe in England, are, in comparison of some to be found at the feet of the
Alps.

Neither will a small abatement appear in his Charge, if the days he lived in
be seriously considered. His misfortune was, to be contemporary with Pope
Alexander the sixth, and of intimate acquaintance with his Son Caesar Borgia:
And what these were, is sufficiently apparent to men versed in Story: a study
such proclaim themselves ignorant of, that can so bitterly exclaim upon
Machiavell: For were they conversant with the procedures of Superlative Powers,
his Rules would seem rather impertinent, and below the practice of Princes,
than to deserve such severe Reproves; the sting of which lies in their own
ignorance, not the more useful Knowledge, they condemn.

No Age abounded more with Action, or showed the instability of worldly Honors
plainer than that he writ in: Therefore from a man wholly conversant in
Court-employments (where it is thought a Lunacy to look beyond the second
Causes, or to act upon the ^edit of any higher Providence than their own)
worse things in reason might be expected, than his, which are really no other
than the History of wise Impieties, long before legible, and since imprinted
with new Additions in the hearts of every ambitious Pretender; yet He undergoes
a Censure equal with those that commit far greater wickedness, than his or
any Pen else is able to express.

Diverse Estates, in Italy, did in his time desire, or actually change their
Lords: A junctore opportune to teach nothing so naturally, nor require any
thing more necessary than Aphorisms of Policy. For Naples was torn ont of the
house of Aujon, by Ferdinand, and the people oppressed under Father and Son.
Lodowic took the Dukedom of Millan from young Galeas, with the like treachery
as Francis Sforza, Father to Galeas, had done from the Dukes of Orleans.

He saw the Descent of the French into Italy winked at by Pope Alexander the
fixed, in expectation of raising an House for his Son Caesar, out of the
gleanings of the French Kings Conquest; In which he prayed without his Beads,
being so far out, in the account, as that after Charles had got a large share
in Italy (through the mediation of the Jealousy of Princes, no less than the
Discontent of the People, arising from the uneasy posture they lay in, so as
all Changes were considered with delight) he entered Rome, forced His Holiness
into St. Angelo, from whence, after some time, he came out swearing to such
Capitulations, as the victorious King was pleased to profer him: And though at
his reception, the French King kissed his foot, yet he durst not trust to his
single Infallibility, but took his Son Caesaer for an Hostage; and to hide it
from the Envy of other Catholic Princes, he covered his detention with the
title of an Embassy, still to reside near him in token of Amity. But, not
long after, Caesar procuring an Escape, his Father, contrary to his Oath,
contracted a League against the French; so much to the prejudice of that
Kingdoms affairs, as it may not only excuse Machiavell, but all writers of
Politics, if they labor to abate the faith of Princes, in relation to the
strictest Stipulations made with Neighbors, found seldom observed, but broken
as often as kept by absolute Powers, to the irreparable loss of the weaker
Party: Whereas an Error in private Persons may be expunged by an after-Game,
or helped by complaint, etc. Remedies too weak to cure the Wounds of Princes,
who in such cases are saved only by their unbelief, and seldom perish, but
through unadvised confidence, in giving too much credit to the Protestations of
less religious performers of Covenants; which rise and fall; not according to
the more constant Standard of Religion, but the varions success of worldly
occasions: And he that knows not how rare a Commodity Probity is, in the
Market of Princes, is no fit Reader, much less a competent Judge of Machiavell.

Leagues, Truces, Compacts, and Peace, are become so cracked and invalid,
through a daily miscarriage in performance, as they serve for little better
use, then to buy in smaller Territories, such as Loraine and the lesser Cities
and Principalities in Italy and Germany, that have little else to trust to, but
the promises of Protection they receive from more Potent Monarchs, which they
know would devour them, but out of dread of each other: Therefore bound by the
strongest reason of State, to balance them upon the access or desertion of
every fortune good or bad.

Which makes Oaths among Statesmen, upon a true survey, to signify nothing; at
best, more danger than profit: Binding only such, as, in relation to Impotency
or Honesty, stand in least need; And becoming, like Juglers Knots, no ways
astrictive to the more Potent, who are ever able to elude them by slights, or
break them by power. Now since Italy, for whose Meridian he calculated his
Advise's, consists, for the most part, of weak pieces, it shows him more
excusable, if not commendable, in fitting them so accurately to their practice
and convenience. And till all Kings agree (which is never to be expected) to
keep their Stipulations and Covenants, you cannot think it reasonable that a
Subject to the Duke of Florence should have advised his Patron to begin; so
contrary to the examples of those times, as it was known, the Pope did then
contract an Amity with the Grand Seignior, which, in Charity, may be thought
he meant not to observe, though for his sake, he suffered himself to be hired
to poison his Brother (fled into Christendom for fear of tasting the fate of
the rest, after his Father's death) and might have been of great advantage to
any. other that had designed to abate the Ottoman Empire: Now after the breach
of Faith, so contrary to the promise made to this poor Infidel, at his being
put into his hands: and his Holinesse's own interest, in case the Tunke had
envaded Europe, it cannot be more passion than discretion, to condemn
Machiavel for his seasonable Advice in relation to the Oaths of Princes.

After all this, he saw Charles the French King dose Italy, with the like
facility he had gained it, all the advantages he might have made being snatched
from between his legs, by the Catholic King. And the Pope and his Son, by
mistake, poisoned with the same Bottle of Wine, prepared by themselves for
others; by which the Father was taken away presently, but the Son, fortified
with Youth and Antidotes, had leisure to live and see, what he had gotten, torn
out of his possession, and himself forced to fly to his Father-in-law, the
King of Navarre, in whose service he was murdered.

It were heartily to be wished, that unlawful practices were only vendible in
Italy, and not the traffic of all the Courts in the known world: where the
marks, the Text has set upon Jeroboam, who (according to the Dialect of
England, for I find it not so elsewhere) may be styled, The Machiavel of the
Jews, cannot scare Princes out of the same path: For what King has failed to
set up altars at Bethel and Dan, when their power is in danger, by the peoples
going to Jerusalem? When Saul was but a Subject, he sought to the Prophet for
his Fathers Asses, but after his assumption to the Throne, a Witch is
consulted, about the success of a Battle. Christ says, Not many great, etc.
are called: Men's outsides, at Court, are soft, but their hearts (within)
seared and hard.

Pride is the root of all Evil; which Princes do not only foster in
themselves, but water by preferments in all others they find able to promote
the ends of it: whose effects cannot be comprised in a narrower circle, than
the whole Mass of Impieties, Ambition is able to commit: That prompted Phocas
to kill his Master the Emperor; Caesar to ruin the most glorious Republique
ever the Sun saw; It teaches Children to pull undecently the Crowns from
their Fathers Heads; it is this that fills Hell with Souls, Heaven with
Complaints, and the Earth with Blood; It made Charles the fifth, to arm
himself against him, be believed, if he believed any thing, to be the Vicar of
our Savior, and would have led him in triumph with Francis the French King,
made his Prisoner the same year by a like fate of War: Neither did Philip the
second do less then mingle the blood of his then only Son Charles, with the
great quantity he spilt upon the face of Europe; yet his thirst unsatisfied, he
set a new world abroach in America, which he let run, till it was as empty of
people, as himself of Pity. Are not the Heads of Nations presented by
Historians, like that of the Baptist in Chargers of blood? Nay what are
Chronicles less than Registers of Murders and projects to bring the^ about, to
the best advantage of ambitious Pretenders? Yet none are so severely blamed
that writ the^.

I would not be so far mistaken, as to be thought to apologize for tyrannical
Principles and practices, knowing they render both Doers and Sufferers
miserable: my aim being only to prove; that if Machiavell stood legally
indicted, he could, not be condemned by those at the Helm in any State, who in
all ages were his Peers, and could not therefore in equity take up a stone
against him. Bad advice, without Execution, hurts only the Giver: Besides, I
cannot believe, the generality of those that cry out upon him, in public,
ever saw or read his Writings, but take their Clamor upon trust, as they do
against Julian, styled the Apostate, how truly, I leave to such as are better
able to judge, than thousands of men so impudent as to extend incomparable Wits
upon the erring Rack of Common Fame, in imitation of their ignorant' Ancestors,
who looked upon Mathematitians as Conjurers; though Wisdom has justified
these her Children so far, as to inform the world, that no Learning is a
greater enemy to Falsehood then theirs.

Yet Machiavell is so modest as to ask, Who had not rather be Titus then Nero?
But to him that will be a Tyrant, he proposes a way least prejudicial to his
temporal Estate: As if he should say, Thou art already at defiance with
Heaven, therefore to preserve thee in an earthly power, no mean is left but to
be perfectly wicked, a task not higherto performed, no not by the worst of
Usurpers; it being as far beyond example, that any Tyrant has done all the
mischief requisite to his own and Childrens safety, as that the best of Kings
have, in any age, put in execution all the good. Now of the first he proposes
Caesar Borgia, for the most absolute pattern, who used all Artifices to
removeevery impediment standing between him and his desires, but his own being
sick at the time of his Fathe'rs death, which perplexed his affairs so, as he
could not bring in a Pope of his own Faction; for want of which; his so
well built Designs / as he fondly supposed) fell to the ground, as most of
their do, that prosecute Empires by oblique means; into whose lap Divine
Justice not seldom throws Destruction, or some louder Discontents, that
over-vote the pleasure, Ambition takes in the accomplishment of her ends.

But since it is sometime the will of God (for Reasons best known to himself)
to give a happy success to bad means wisely contrived, why should this
Florentine be so bitterly inveyed against, who cannot be denied but to have had
at least as virtuous Principles, for a Member of the Roman Church, as Alexander
the sixth, that was Head of it? with whom all Impieties were as familiaras the
air he breathed in, so far, that it could not be so well guessed, when he
spoke true or false, as by the abundance of Oaths he used when he meant to
deceive.

Worldly Wisdom is recommended to us in the person of the unjust Steward; and,
I pray, what does Machiavell say more of Caesar Borgia, but that he was a
perfect Tyrant? And if he presume so far on your (better supposed) Honesty, as
to propose him for an Example, yet it is still of Evil; and what fitter
pattern can there be for an Usurper, than one of his own Coat.

Neither are the Rules he lays down, waved by the best of men if wise; for who
executes not ungrateful actions, by Deputies, acceptable in Person? And all
these his Documents he gives only to a Prince; for had he assigned this
practice to a Son, or any else circumscribed in a narrower room than a
Kingdom, he might be more justly condemned: But undertaking to make a Grammar
for the right understanding the Dialect of Government, why is he blamed for
setting down the most General Rules, and such as all Statesmen make use of,
either to benefit themselves or hurt others? That they make no conscience of
falsehood, is manifest by Lewis the eleventh, that learned Father in King-craft
who pronounced him ignorant of the way to live, that knew not how neatly to
deceive.

That Breach of Faith in private Persons, is not only destructive to wel-being
but also damnable, he cannot deny: but Princes pretend larger Charters in
relation to a more universal Co^merce; which they extend to Ambassadors, and
Ministers of State; as counting all things honorable that are safe: and if
this be an Evil, it is the Kings, and no way curable, but by the King of
Heaven.

To conclude, a Body Politic is like that of a Man, which when it is
altogether, shows outwardly a beautiful and comely sight; but search into the
Entralls from whence the true Nourishment proceeds, and little is to be found
but Blood, Filth and Stench: The truth is, Machiavell is observed to have raked
deeper in this, than his Predecessors, which makes him smell, as he does, in
the nostrills of the nice and ignorant; whereas those of more Prudence and
Experience, know it is the most natural savor of the Court, especially where
the Prince is of the first Head; of which, such as come in by Succession may
abate much.

OBSERVATIONS Upon the King of Sweden's Descent INTO GERMANY.
WIthin an Age or two, sometimes more, sometimes less, according as the World
is inclined to Happiness or Infelicity there has still risen up some
Ambitious Pretender or other, that has labored to build himself a Name by
the effusion of humane Blood: And these offering fine subjects for Discourse
and Romances, are by the Ancients styled Hero's, by the Moderns, Conquerours,
and men of high spirits. The first of these we hear of, is Nimrod, branded by
God himself; To him Alexander, Caesar, and innumerable others succeeded, who
for the most part stand highly registered in Historical C^^enders, because they
afford good Pens an easy way to render themselves immortal by a neat
expression of their Butcheries; when indeed they both deserve rather the curse
of Mankind, the one for doing, the other for recommending to Posterity such
cruel examples, without giving them the true name of wol-fish Ambition which
all merit, who infest others Territories out of no more pious reason than
Augmentation of Empire. The principal Errand, however palliated (to purchase
Partakers) with more plausible and gilded Mottos in their Flags, which they
hold out to the People. And I believe, if God had continued the King of Sweden
in life and success, he had gone as high in Blood, and as deep in
Devastation, as his Ancestors and Goths did in Italy, where they ruined such
Monuments, as Time could not have, yet demolished, but that she received
assistance from their barbarous hands. And now I have set him under his
natural colors, I am bold to maintain, that he that looks to the end of his
Prospective, shall see his Actions reach beyond the Darings of all (in that
kind) that ever went before him^^^ may appear by these Circumstances.

1. He did not fall on men drowned in sloth and Luxury, but on a Prince whose
Prudence was lately wakened with the loss of a Crown and his Peoples valor
new whetted by regaining it: Being so far from wanting all necessaries for War,
that, besides new ones of his own, he was Master of all such Magazines, as were
provided by the Elector and his party: So as it may with reason be believed,
that if the Swede's little finger had been in the endeavor to lessen the
Austrian Family, when the Palsgrave put in his hand, the King, long before his
death, had possessed the Imperial Throne.

No party (in any extant Relation I have seen) is heard to call him in: All the
Forces he had, or could raise, appearing to the world as inconsiderable; till
he had showed them such a Miracle, as a puissant Army upon one Horse. After
whom they ran to gather up the Spoil, who, till then, had their heels shackled
with Caesar's Successes.

3. The Duke of Saxony, the most potent Prince of the Protestant party, had no
stroger Title to his Estate, than what he derived from Caesar's power who had
placed him there for the like fault, in his Elder Branch (which yet remained in
being to claim his right) he must have fallen into, had he yielded succor or
assistance to the Swedish Crown.

4. He had seen the King of Denmark coming on the like errand, bassled; A
Prince inferior to him in little but Valor and Temperance; having the Sound
at command, not to be over-matched with any advantages the Swede could properly
have called his own.

5 The jealous hatred, this and all other Nations have to these Northern
people, as desirous by nature to better their Heaven, with an incroachment upon
Neigbours, that live under a more auspicious Sun.

6. The new Protests of Fealty made by the Princes and Hans Towns to the
Austrian Family, procured by his late Victories; the terror of which had so
cooled the zeal of the people, and evaporated the heat they formerly were in to
regain their Liberty.

7. The assurance he had, that James of England, who refused to hear his own
Honor and the cries of his Children, would never listen to the voice of a
Stranger, that had no better Cards to show for his future Success, than Valor
and good Conduct, in which the old man had as little Faith as Knowledge.

8. The Hollanders, his most considerable Friends could not help him, but by
way of Diversion; being far off both in respect of distance and quality of
their Power; the States chief strength lying in Ships, no ways serviceable to
the Swede in his Inland expeditions: And to counterpoise this, as if Fate had
renounced all assistance but his own, the Duke of Lorain had cast himself
blindfold into the Arms of the Spaniard; with whom was as madly joined the
French Kings Brother, both in Alliance and Person at that time very
considerable, in regard of the known weakness of the K. of France his body,
and the surmises of his Sterility, thought to be supplied by the Cardinall's
industry.

9. He could not expect such cordial help from France, as a natural Prince of
Germany; because upon success he was ready to assume the Title of Emperor to
himself; the only bait likely to draw in the most Christian King: Neither
could that Nation be assured, that, his ends attained in Germany, he might not
be prompted by his good fortune to invade them; Ambition swallowing all
opportunities of gaining, without the taste of any former obligations. And for
the French King's being chosen by the Reformed Princes Head of the Union; He
knew that King looked upon it, rathers as a scorn put upon James of England,
for his neglect, than as an honor done to himself; the Germans being wholly
compelled to it by necessity, in that juncture of occasions.

10. For Money, accounted by all the only Oil, able to make the Engines of
War move, he could not have much, being numbered among the poorest Kings in
Europe. And to make this defect the more impossible to be dispensed with, he
knew the Emperor like a Colossus, had not only a leg of Iron in Germany, but
one of Gold in Spain to assist it upon the least offer of any motion to offend
him.

11. The best he could expect at first (till Success had made him formidable)
from the Landgrave Van Hess, Witenberg and the rest of the meaner Princes, was
a modest Neutrality: Or if they were so mad as to rush themselves into a sudden
declaration for him, there was a large compensation made to the other side, by
the unseigned assistance of the Duke of Bavaria, who had his affection newly
purchased by the rich donative of the Palatinate, together with the principal
Lay. Electorate; which could hold no longer good, than the Emperor was
maintained in a Superlative power,

12. It is true, that Wallestin and the Emperors Veteran Militia had parted
from the last Action with some discontent: But this is so ordinary at the
Disbanding of Armies, when there is no farther use of them, that it could not
infuse so deaf an ill Spirit into the generality of the Soldiery, but that the
sound of the next Advance money would soon cast it out: And, one to command in
chief was not hard to be found, where the late Combustions had created so
large a choice.

Had he been beaten, or sneaked out of the Action, as Denmark did, such Reasons
might have been upbraided to him, as rashly neglected: But since he was able to
break through them all, they multiply the weight of stronger of his own,
which led him on against these; not to be found but in his own Head, and the
confidence he had of his Conduct and Valor; doing many things wherein appeared
a Hand more powerful than Fortune's; who was not able to make her self
Mistress of his Sword, but by taking away his Life: And that done, Victory had
been so much his that it could not be denied to his dead carcass.

If the strength of the Enemy adds to the Conquest: who could cope with a
stronger, and upon more disadvantages? so as who ever reads the Advisoes of
those times, shall find that the King of Sweden made, not only Rome, but
Constantinople, to tremble; the Turk standing in such admiration of his
Valor, that he lost his activity, and did not only forbear to make in-rodes
into Germany, which upon less occasions he used to do; But gave off all
thoughts of offending others, as if he feared he should have work enough to
defend himself.

And had the Swedish Sword made as deep impressions in his Empire, as it left
in the Germane, they would have been looked upon as Miracles; And, instead of
Antichrist (which by reason of his success, some Catholics fondly called
him) he would have been styled, The Champion of the Gospel.

All the advantage I can find the King had, out of himself, was the Emperor's
Ignorance of that Common Lesson, so often repeated to the Prejudice of the
wisest Princes; That Slighted parties are followed with the greatest train of
inconveniences, in relation to such as despise them.

Now if men esteem of Soldiers, by the quantity of Blood and Land they have
wasted, King Philip the second of Spain, will out-goe them all, in his
Conquest of Peru, and the rest of those weak people: But if Reason may be
heard, the least part of Germany asks more difficulty to reduce it, than both
the Indies, or all that Alexander and his like are able to boast of.

A DISCOURSE UPON PISO and VINDEX, Who both conspired the Death of NERO, Though
with a contrary Success.
PISO a Nobleman borne, beloved of the People, drawn into the Action rather
out of the persuasion of others, than his own affection, associated with the
choicest Wits in the Roman Empire, followed by the bravest Spirits, and armed
with pretenses that were proof against all the darts Reason or Religion could
cast at them; yet miscarried in the midst of these Advantages, falling soon
after into the same Grave, he had most justly measured out for Nero,

The foundation of whose Ruin was laid by Vindex, that had no stronger
materials to work his destruction, than what he hammered out of his own
invention, and the advantage he took from the love of a broken Legion, no way
considerable in respect of the rest of the Princes Forces, that stood at this
time firm to him, having had their affections newly warmed by diverse Largesses
and a daily Impunity; stronger engageme^ts in such corrupt times, than all the
virtue and piety incide^t to flesh.

It Is true, Vindex never lived to see the effect of his brave attempt, as the
most stately Fabrics are commonly least enjoyed by those that build them: Yet
the Reasons why his beginnings did succeed, rather than Piso's, may be some of
these.

1 Of which the first lies hid in the dark Book of Fatality, where all things
are kept from perishing till they are arrived at the utmost period Providence
has set them; which is for that time as constant in the preservation of the
Instruments of her wrath, as the Dispensers of her Cleme^cy: But when the
critical minute, appointed for their destruction, is come, they lie level
with their feet, whose hands before were not able to reach them

2. The manner of Piso's attempt, which was to assasinate Nero: An endeavor no
less indecent for men of Honor, than unproper for a Tyrant; who as he is
Enemy to all, so ought he to perish by the hands of all; which, by a
Clandestine dispatch, had not only lost the pleasure, but the example of their
Revenge. Neither was it in any degree of possibility likely to be concealed;
and therefore the harder to succeed, having been communicated to so many, and
of so different tempers, who out of hatred to others or love to themselves,
could not choose but reveal it.

3. As the body of Man, be it never so sound, is maintained in being by
contention of humors, the blood flying to the heart upon any sudden assault:
But if a Bruise be made in a remote place, it falls not out so, but affords the
virulent matter leisure togather. Thus are bad Princes with more ease and
safety destroyed by a remote and open hostility, than a sudden and private
attempt: For, near, men see daily so many effects of their cruelty, that they
are afraid, studying more their own safety than the freedom of the Common
wealth.

Besides the familiarity with Tyranny makes it so domestical, that those
within the Verge of the Court know not well how to live without it: Therefore
they must be tender of his preservation, to maintain their own power, having
rendered themselves either actively or passively as odious to the people as
their Master.

4. As any thing that ministers occasion of discourse, the farther it extends,
the more sound it makes; and he that gathers Snow, has a Ball proportionable
to the distance he rolls it in: So those that cry out a far off, upon the
abuses of the Court, do not only draw attention from some about them, but
tickle the ears, and stir up the Spirits of all such as have felt, or do fear
the weight of Oppression. Nay, such persons themselves, as at a nearer
distance, would, out of hope or fear, labor to quench it, will, a great way
off, look upon a combustion, with delight: Novelty being of that nature
(especially following things ill) that it raises more expectation of good,
than it can destroy.

5. Open force does assure the Malcontents, that there is pretense made of no
more than what is cordially intended; to which the soft whispers of a few
confederates cannot enough persuade: It being the ordinary practice of
tyrannical Governors, by such instruments to entrap others for whose lives
and estates they long. But in this case, Report, that represents nothing in its
due proportion, instead of the danger that is, musters up all that may be: And
in this the concerned Tyrant seconds her; who looking through the false
Spectacles of guilt and fear, reads his fortune worse, than possibly it is
written, and above prevention; so far, as though Hope (the last friend in
such adversities) cannot quite be shook off, she fixes upon lower objects,
than the continuance of his former power. This flattered Nero, that though they
drove him out of Rome, yet for pity, or to satisfy his Party, they might be
drawn to leave him Egypt quiet: As foolish an opinion in him, as it had been
madness in them, to think any power meet to be left in the hands of an
exafperated Prince; whose Revenge cannot be buried but in his grave, especially
if it respects his Subjects: For though himself might be of a nature to
forgive it, those about him cannot, but will be ready to incite him to take it
upon all occasions.

6. Where there are many that conspire, the apprehension of any one will soon
detect the rest; whereas the like resolution taken by a single person, and not
communicated, seldom fails, being secure from all fear, and hastened by no
accident but what opportunity presents.

7. Ill Counsel is rather to be hearkened unto, than none at all; there being
a possibility to mend it with better: whereas a dull suspension loses time, a
thing it recoverable; and does not only assure the Adversaries, but disheartens
Friends, giving them leisure to listen to the free offers of the contrary Party.

It may be observed in the fall of Nero, that the meanest Conspiracy is not to
be slighted. For in a crazed Common wealth, the least jangling will bring the
multitude about the ears of their Governor; who, having offended all, knows
not whom to trust, that has any power with the people: And this perceived by
his own; they desert him, or by his destruction labor to purchase their
particular safety: For what hope can another have in him, that distrusts
himself?

He that has lost the love of his people, cannot be certain of his present
safety or moderate ruin when it comes; for the most part sudden in regard of
his own knowledge, though presaged and wished by all the world besides. No
prudence can maintain a Tyrant long in power: for though he may divert the
people from making inspection into his disposition, by exposing his Agents to
their mercy; yet at last the succession of the same abuses will direct them to
the true cause; which being once discovered to lie in his Nature, nothing he
does shall please, but he suspected for more evil, than it can in probability
produce: The worlds Opinion exercising no less authority over Kings, than
meaner men. Besides, the delivering up men in Authority to the rage of the
People, like letting of Blood, may stop the progress of a present Fever, but
much weakens the power of the Prince, to resist a future distemper.

After the disorders of a Tyrant are laid before the eyes of the people, it
turns thousands his enemies in an instant, that out of Custom or Conscience
prayed for him the day before. Who are more solicitous to advance his
destruction, than careful to choose a Successor that might be fit to govern.
Their Discretion extending no farther than their Nourishment, which they only
receive from hand to mouth. Therefore all the use that can be made of this
popular Monster is, during their first heat: For, their expectations deloded
(being incapable of honor or reward) they are ready, with the Dog, to lick up
the same Nero they had vomited out. And, that it is easier to expel a Tyrant,
than to find a Prince in all points worthy to succeed, appeared by Galba: And
by Otho we find, when the multitude are up in Swarms, they care not, what Bush
they light on.

If Seneca had got the Imperial Diadem from under Piso, it is uncertain,
whether he had been able to have kept it: Virtue having showed her self as
great an enemy to a fresh Family as Vice, to whom Cruelty is for the most part
more necessary than Clemency, especially toward the Nobility, who are observed
to carry the most natural affection to the old line, that first wound them up
to honor.

I would be loath to blame Seneca wrongfully, though the immense Treasure he
left behind him does, not only, by consequence, accuse him of too much
Covetonsnesse, as some Authors are bold to lay Ambition to his charge; which
the worse became him, because unpossible to be satisfied but at the cost of his
Maker. But admit this Stoic in outward Profession, though an Epicure in his
Gardens, etc. to be as good as he desired to be thought, yet if he had not
restored to the Romans their lost liberty, but sought to establish the
Government in his own house, he had only imitated their Charity, that take a
Slave out of one cruel Family to put him into another, that might in a small
time prove as bad: or if he had governed moderately all his life, it had been
like the good day in a Fever, which is so short and uncertain, that it takes
away all taste of Ease and Delight, etc.

A DISCOURSE Upon the Greatness and Corruption OF The Court of Rome.
THere is nothing, Idleness and Peace makes not worse, Labor and Exercise
better: The Tree that stands in the Weather, roots best, and deepest; The
running Water, and Air that is agitated, are most wholesome and sweet. The
Cause of this may be deduced from Gods eternal Decree, That nothing in Nature
should remain idle and without motion: This also extends to the Children of
Grace, who go more nimbly about the works of their heavenly Calling, being
driven by the storms of Persecution, than when they have nothing but the
smooth voice of Prosperity to allure and persuade them. The Martyrs professed
Christ more boldly, amidst the flames of the hottest Persecutions, than we dare
do in the Sunshine of the Gospel.

God never made a larger promise of his continuing Truth in any place, than to
the Nation of the Jews: Yet how often do we find it buried in the rubbish of
Errors and Impiety? Their Kings and Priests either teaching, or at least
tolerating Idolatry: The Church being driven into so dark and narrow a corner,
as the Prophet Elias could not discover a righteous man: Neither was Jerusalem
in better plight, which had the Temple, and in that the Oracles of God, in
possession. For if it did escape profanation during the worser days of Solomon
his son Rehoboam saw it plundered, and in most of his successors reigns it lay
neglected or misimploied. So that if a stranger, led by the glorious title the
Jews had, to be the people of God, should have conformed himself to their
worship, he had scarce mended his marked, though he were before never so great
an Idolater. Yet God never gave a larger Charter to any Church; part of it
being contained in these words, I have hallowed this House which thou have
built, to put my name there for ever. This proves Gods Promises conditional,
and that outward Felicity seldom accompanies inward Integrity; or if they have
the luck to meet, they presently part; men's hearts being ordinarily to narrow
to entertain goodness and worldly pomp.

The Churches we read of in the New Testament, with whom the Holy Ghost was so
familiar, as to direct particular Letters unto them, are not now to be found.
Only Rome brags, she remains the same in purity of Doctrine, though for
Manners she is as corrupt as her elder Sister Sodom, so that if Italy be a
Circle of Impiety, the Court of Rome is the Center. Yet these plead their Title
with God himself, grounding it upon the tottering Foundation of worldly
felicity: Forgetting that it is against the example of all times, that any
Nation, much less a Church, should so long sail under the merry gale of
earthly prosperity, and not long ere this discharge herself of that rich
lading she was fraught with all, when she traded for Souls, under the Fathers
of the Primitive times. There having been such a succession of imperious
greatness in that Chair, as Rome is now more like the proud and triumphant
Chapel of Antichrist, than the poor and militant Church of God. All the
calamities that have of late fallen upon her, may be said to have dropped from
her own Ambition, in seeking to enlarge her power at the cost and prejudice of
others, and therefore more naturally to be styled Punishments than Persecutions.

You cast your eyes on no Story where the villainy of Popes is not at large
discovered; who can then believe that the pure Spirit of God should indow with
infallibility of judgment Monsters so visibly corrupted? We find, the Holy
Ghost did under the Law hate and forbid all impurity though in mere outward
Ceremony; how then should he under the brighter light of the Gospel, suffer
himself to be poured out of one unclean Vessel into another; beginning again
with a Conjurer where he left with a Sodomite.

Yet they say, Rome is the true Church, out of which there is no Salvation: Not
remembering that the holy Scripture, Charity and Reason tell us, Gods Church is
as universal as the Earth; and shall one day be gathered together under Christ
the Head. Now in the mean time, that harmony of Opinions they pretend to, may
be rather wished, than hoped for. In Paul's time some made conscience of eating
things sacrificed to Idols, others of Circumcision; yet he condemns them not
for schismatic. And it is but a weak evasion to say, He bare with them in
regard of the infancy of the Church: For in these days of knowledge she is as
infantine in some places, as she was then: where he that taught had the
strength of Miracles to justify his Doctrine, which these want, and are driven
to this shift in lieu of them, to cozen the people with such as are
supposititious Now if there be no salvation out of the Church of Rome, not to
speak of our selves, etc. what Charity is it to think all the Water cast away,
that is poured in Christ's name, upon the faces of those Christians in Greece,
Rushia, and remoter places, to which this Ages curiosity and covetousness has
taught the^ the way? This makes me think there is no room for such monopolizing
Opinions: But I leave this to Divines, returning to the Pope.

After the Piety of the first Bishops of Rome had purchased them Reputation,
and that God had not only opened the hearts of Potentates to receive the
Gospel, but their hands to build and endow Churches: They being advanced first
to the Dignity of Arch bishops, thence to Patriarchs, and so at last to the
Papal Supremacy (a name derived from Pater Patriarcharum, which for brevities
sake was written Pa Pa) exchanged their Piety for Promotion. It being the
Custom of frail Humanity, to conclude goodness at the beginning of Felicity.

For taking the advantage of new kindled Zeal, wisely observed by them to be
the hottest, the Popes were able to lead King and People whither they pleased,
and in the interim had the opportunity to proportion what power or riches they
thought fit for themselves.

Now as Policy is not able to keep long the right way to Heaven, so at last it
led them into a world of Impieties, by encroaching, under pretense of Religion,
upon higher Jurisdiction and Power than could naturally belong to Subjects:
which wanting strength of their own to maintain, they sheltered them under the
Donation of such Princes, as had no better titles to their Crowns, than was
derived from an Usurpation over the weakness of those in former possession;
glad of the Popes Protection, because they found the generality of men, either
out of Religion or Ignorance, made their estimate of the truth or falsehood of
the Titles, and legality of the Claims of Princes, according as they were more
or less current in the opinion of their Clergy, whose judgments depended
wholly on the Bishop of Rome, who afforded his approbation to their
illegitimate Titles, out of no weaker Reason of State, than they at first
desired it: Laying up with all diligence their Petitions and his Grants, to
remain as Precedents for their posterite to be guided by: Therefore it is no
wonder, why these Tyrants and Usurpers should strengthen the power of the Pope,
since the foundation of their own was laid upon the exorbitant excess of that
of Rome: which is so improved, as the Emperor has, for many ages, received
his Crown from their Successors, to whom his Predecessors had formerly given
the Miter.

The cloud of Ignorance, that did then cover the face of the world, was a great
help to keep their juggling undiscovered: For that little Learning extant in
those times was wholly included in the Monastical Clergy, (the Laity being
intent upupon nothing but Wars and Pleasure) so as they had opportunity to make
all Books and Records speak in their favor; which being Manuscrips, and so but
in few hands, it was no hard matter to corrupt them. Besides being prohibited
Marriage, they did neither respect nor acknowledge other Posterity or Alliance,
than those to succeed in the same places, of whom they had so religious a care,
as they thought none merited well of the Church, that did not leave them
endowed with more Power and Immunities then they found them: Making it an
Article of the faith they owed to their Profession, to suppress the Laity, and
advance the Clergy: And if this was the End, they esteemed no Means ill,
conducing to it.

Thus by Time, the Indulgency of good, and Necessity of wicked and illegitimate
Princes, they freed their whole Society from the Jurisdiction of the temporal
Magistrate, not suffering them to be liable to any punishments, but those
eternal, and such as their own superiors shall think fit to lay upon them;
seldom suitable to the fault, unless in case of Schism from their general
Tenants: and in this their Jealousy, no less than prudence makes them very
severe. Now having purchased Ease, Honor, and Impunity, such as were Poor,
Guilty, or Ambitious, besides Younger Brothers, and those in Debt, entered
their Fellowship; which freed them from present want, and fear of punishment
for former Offenses, how capital soever: And these being, for the most part,
of the best natural abilities soon learned the skill, so to work on the
consciences of Dying people, and those affrighted with their sins, that the
Church was left Heir of the best part of Christendom. And taking
encouragement from the blind Zeal then reigning, (which till Printing had
opened a way to Knowledge, rendered all things possible unto them) they did not
only make use of such profitable Errors, as their fore fathers left them, but
brought in new ones of their own contriving, gilding them with the spendid
titles of things necessary and of religious use; Amongst, which were Images,
brought in at first only to encourage others to imitate their constancy, whom
they saw painted, with the manner of Death they had been put to by the
Persecuters of those Times: Of the Cross, wore anciently only for a
Cognizance, they have made a Tutelary God, looking no higher in their
Extremities: The blessed Saints were scandalized with the Worship given to them
and their Relics: whom, in a full imitation of the Heathen, they made
Protectors of their Cattle, and smaller Pleasures, as Hawking, Hunting, etc.
And because the Bible did not, in their opinions, afford a store sufficient for
all uses, they have added a number more, as may be found in the Legend.

To the Monks, and all sorts of Friars, the Popes have successively given
immense Privileges and Indulgences, wisely considering, they gain them
victories, without the Sword, and are a strong and faithful Militia, fed and
paid by the respective Princes of Christendom, who, though they know they
depend on a Foreign Power, yet few dared to explode them: so sharp and
terrible was their fear of the Knife, and more deeply wounding dart of
Excommunication. And because, in case all Kings should have joined, it might
have gone hard with his Holiness, be kept them employed abroad at the Holy
War, or at Enmity one with another, or at least at Unity with himself, by
maintaining their usurped Titles, or dispe^sing with their Incestuous or
Adulterous Marriages. But finding, in these latter days, Knowledge has
exposed him to a Reformation, and that Princes would no longer make the
vindication of his Temporalities, or what, under the notion of Spirituals, he
is pleased to call His, a matter of Religion: and not daring to alter any thing
formerly admitted by his Predecessors, for fear of falling under this
undeniable Conclusion, That he which has erred in one thing, may in more: He
most politickly called in the Inquisition, which turns no less to the profit
of the Secular Prince (who has all he dislikes condemned by an Authority
incapable as well of Envy as Revenge) than the Preservation of the
Ecclesiastics, and his Holinesse's power from falling under ordinary Dispute:
which Policy he borrowed of his younger Brother Mahumet, whose errors remain to
this day in Credit, because it is death to question the Truth of them.

No man can say the Pope imitates Peter, except in denying his Master; who
following the example of Christ, did in humility wash his Companion's feet,
which this does in jest, during the holy Week, as they call it, but suffers his
own to be, in earnest, kissed by Kings and Emperors. It is true, he styles
himself the Servant of Servants, but is content to be worshipped under the
title of Lord of Lords: Nay some of his Flatterers have given him the name of a
God, yet with Paul and Barnabas, he does not rend his Clothes, saying, He is a
man subject to infirmities, as others are; but rather seeks to seem worthy of
this Title, by proclaiming to the world, That he cannot err, a power God has
wholly reserved to himself; or if communicated (which I will not now dispute)
it is only to the Church in general, when, in his fear they shall meet to
determine matters of Religion, Which is so contrary to the nature of his
Greatness, that no sound is so terrible to him, as that of a General Council,
a thing this Age cannot hope to see free and entire, by reason of the contrary
Interests of Princes, who, together with Religion, mingle their covetous and
ambitious Pretenses: For if such interruptions had not been, so undecent a
proceeding should never have taken place, as was in the Council of Trent; where
the Emperor suffered the Pope to be Party and Judge, and the Bishops berest of
all power, either to propose or determine. Nor were the Plaintiffs admitted to
more favor or liberty of Disputation, than to remain quiet, and hear
themselves condemned; so as, in conclusion, though this Synod was desired only
to abate the power and reform the abuses of the Court of Rome, it was managed
by them with so much Policy, that it did rather much strengthen and confirm the
exorbitant power of that See.

The greatest things in dispute between Papist and Protestant, are matters
concerning Profit or Honor, which may satisfy any not delighted with
blindness, that they were brought in by the diligence of the Priests, taking
advantage from the ignorance of preceding Ages.

From all which I may conclude, that such amongst them as are wise, conversant
in history, and acquainted with the present practice of the Court of Rome, are
souly to be suspected of Atheism: because Conscience can never be persuaded
against a convincing experience: which is also made good by the irreligious
Italians, from whom comes this Proverb. The nearer the Church, the farther from
God: For such abhor Religion, because they see the Pope makes but a politic
robe of it, taking the liberty himself to put it on or off, as becomes his
occasions.

A DISCOURSE UPON THE ELECTION OF POPE LEO the XI.
IN the Negotiations of Cardinal Peron may be found a perfect Journall of so
much of the Election of Leo the Eleventh, as was possible to be known by one
side; to which Discourse I shall refer all those that do believe the Pope can be
the true Successor of Peter: It being incongruous both to Prudence and
Religion, to imagine the Holy Ghost should mingle Interests with the ambitious
ends of Princes, who shun no impious means, to make him succeed, that is
thought the truest friend to their Occasions. I know it is not only in the
power, but the practice of God, to raise his ends out of ill means; Yet it were
presumption in men to shape out his work, though he be able to fit our
endeavors to his own Honor.

But the Court of Rome seeks to make the people believe, that, notwithstanding
these Considerations, after the Mass of the HolyGhost is said, he is as really
present in the Conclave, as he was with the eleven Disciples, when they chose a
Successor to Judas, who betrayed Christ. In which they acknowledge themselves
either Atheists, or presumptuous fighters against God; For if the Choice be
his, how dare they interpole their mediation, or hope the French or Spanish
Factions can possibly prevail; one side ever interrupting because both cannot
be pleased. They have of late been made, sometimes by the other which must
conclude the Holy Spirit subservient to humane Endeavors, or no more friend to
this Choice, than to that of the Grand Seignior.

Here you may see how they labor to hire or force the HolyGhost to fix upon
so^e such subject, as may be most auspicious to the prevalent Party; who is
invoked out of Ceremony, leaving the rest to be hewed out by themselves. Before
these Monarchs grew so potent, the troubles in the Conclave were rather more
than less: For the Cardinals made Elections so tedious by their towsing, that
sometimes the Romans, sometimes other Princes, forced them to resolve. And to
avoid such constraint, they did often pitch upon Impotent men, such as for Age
or Weakness were not likely to hold out long (as this Leo, who died in few weks
after his assumption) during whose time the Pretenders are at leisure to
concoct their Designs better; which is ordinarily done by Bribes, or in case
they prevail not, by Poison, nay the Devil is not left unsought to: So as
Balzac, says, None, on this side the Alps, labor more to look well, than
some of them, to seem-sickly and weak; hoping by that means to obtain the
Chair which is able, of a gouty Cardinal, to make a sound Pope.

In ancient time the Bishops of Rome were chosen by the Parish Priests of that
City; And how, since, Cardinals came in, is no more known, (though not ancient)
tha^ the date of many Novelties, that have most shamefully been imposed upon
the Church: Yet to this day, no Ecclesiastical Cardinal (for they have
others) but retains among his titles, the name of one of the Parish Churches in
Rome, though he be ordinarily called by his own name, or else some other
Bishopric or Dignity, he has in Co^menda^. By the institutions of a former
Pope, which for shame they dare not revoke, all his Actions that gets into the
Chair by Simony, are null: Now what are all these sinister Endeavors, but so
many several sorts of Simony? If Simon Magus had attempted by Policy,
mediation of Friends, or Flattery, to have obtained the Gift of the HolyGhost,
should his fault have been less, or not rather greater; Money being the
richest offer he could make, and most suitable to the Apostles wants, which he
saw others, endued with the same Spirit, daily cast at their feet? And if this
be granted, when had the Church a Head able to utter any thing but Falsehoods,
or Nullities; All Popes having, for many years, entered at one of these Gates?
In Civil Kingdoms, the Crown is to be obeyed without questioning how the
Wearer came by it; but to tie the Ecclesiastical power to these conditions,
were to bind the Holy Ghost to the Popes Chair.

The Bishop of Rome lays an absolute claim to an unerring Spirit; but is not
able to demonstrate the time when he had it: If it were always, the Errors
found inherent in the persons were incapable of blame or retraction. Yet out of
this Cloud of uncertainety, say they, the Holy Ghost dictates only to his
Church, and such as deny it are Heretics. If at any time he has the Spirit of
infallibility, it is, perhaps, at his first entrance into the Chair, as Saul
had a greater measure upon his new anointing, than in all his Reign besides;
yet in the Election of this Leo the XI (of the House of Medici, and before his
Assumption known by the Title of Cardinal of Florence) appears no such
matter, which would not have been omitted by the penner of the passages of
their Conclave; being an eye witness and a Cardinal, who does pride himself
much in his fortune, and the policy both he and the French Party had used in
his advance. But it may be, Paul the Fifth, who succeeded this Leo, had it,
when he made so great a present to the Devil, as at once to excommunicate the
whole State of Venice, with all the territories belonging unto it: But this was
afterward condemned by himself as rash and inconsiderate, terms most
unbefitting a thing done by God. And wise men may here justly take occasion to
conclude, that no Pope does think, or ever thought, he had a power of not
erring: For if such a Spirit were an usual companion of that See, Paul the
Fifth would have expected the operation of it, and not have troubled a State to
so little purpose, without the assistance at least of a Revelation.

He that desires to be informed of the Illness of Modern Popes, may be
abundantly satisfied, if he Consult Historians, who are not dumb in declaring
the faults of the Court of Rome. The truth is, were it not for the strict (or
if you will, call them pious) Lives of a few melancholic Friars, it is
impossible so much wickedness should not be booted out of the world.

Yet the Court of Rome has as strong Supporters as Policy is able to bring,
though her truest friends are Ignorance, the Inquisition, and Interests of
Princes: The first lies in every particular manto reform, the second for the
most part in the King of Spain, the third only in God.

Political Occasions Of the DEFECTION From the CHURCH OF ROME.
AS some Diseases, and other Mulcts (but accidental in the first result)
become, after a small Succession, hereditary to a Family; So Opinions, if once
inveterate, tender their Professors Ears, like those of the Adder, deaf to the
wiser and more probable Charms of Reason. I come just now from talking with a
Papist, and find him (though a Scholar) so wrapped up in the old rags of
Tradition, and inspired with so strong an Implicit Faith, that I think it had
been one of the nearest things to impossible, for the Bishop of Rome to have
lost so many, had he not fallen into such Errors as these.

1. The seeking to maintain a greater show of Piety in the Church, than was
suitable to humane Frailty, and the comforts of Life: The Friars Habit being no
less nasty than unseemly, and therefore shunned by nicet Judgments and those
of parts, not so capable of temptation from any thing, as Pleasure and Profit:
Or if such Austerity was called for, in relation to external Zeal, (the parade
of all Religions, and fit to be mustered up often in the eyes of the people)
yet the generality might have been left to more decent Acoutrements, by which
they had become sociable unto others, and not loathsome to themselves.

2. Though such Austerity was exacted from the Members, the Head, and capital
Clergy observed not the like: which alarmed not only their Maligners, but
those of their own Coat, whose Desert or Fortune had not raised them to the
same Transcendency.

3. The admittance of Printing, unpossible but to prove disadvantageous unto
those, whose strongest evidence, for the maintenance of their Power, lay in the
Ignorance and Patience of the World, which this could not but be thought
probable both to inform and disturb.

4. The suffering Nations to swell into such vast Bodies, as France, Spain,
etc. The most obtained under the Churches pretense, which in favor to one, and
malice to others, did blast Princes titles by the thunders of Excommunication,
and set the people at odds with their Natural Sovereigns. By which
Exorbitances they taught the Germans and our Henry the eight to find out a
Remedy by applying to this proud flesh the powder of Reformation; the strength
of which made the same Zeal, that swelled the Priests to this height, as ready
to tear away the ground from under them.

5. The mixing a desire of temporal power with what is purely spiritual, put
such an allay upon their Sanctity, that it became less current, than otherwise
it might have been, had they not used the Sword, which Peter only drew (and yet
not without acheck) in his Master's cause, to purchase Principalities for their
Children and Nephews.

6. The falling into the common Error of weaker Princes, who, to palliate some
exte^porary mischief, do oftentime scontract an incurable inconvenience, as
was done in the case of John Husse, and Hierom of Prague: in relation to whose
proceedings the Fathers in the Council of Basil enacted, That No Faith was to
be kept with Heretics. By which they have rendered themselves incompatible
with any other Tenants than their own; To whom they do by this almost as much
as confess, that upon the access of a power sufficient, none are to expect
milder conditions, than to lay their heads upon the Block, or cast their
consciences at the Popes feet.

7. The irrepealable Authority given to the Decrees of all approved Synods,
opposes the Custom of Nature, and course of all sublunary things, whicy are
apt to change; no less than true reason of State, that abhors to be shackled
by any severer restraint than she is able to cast off upon approach of a
greater advantage: The dispensing with an unsociable Tenent being far less
prejudicial, than the continuance of it against the grain of the generality.

8. The Pope should have removed at least so many of the Hundred Greivances,
presented at the Diets, as he found all Estates co^curred in the dislike of:
The charge and trouble incident to the Roman Religion afflicting men's
temporalities as much almost as their Falsehood could their Consciences: It
being more Policy to part with things not absolutely necessary, willingly, than
by constraint.

9. The open partiality showed in the affairs of divided Princes: By which the
one side is made perpetually his enemy, and the friendship of the other no
longer permanent, than it receives benefit; being wise enough to see, that the
same Arts and Power that are able to help now, may, upon the recoil of
Interest, be as apt to hurt: All strength conjuring up jealousy in Kings, that
is not absolutely at their own dispose.

10. The ordinary and slight Provocations the Pope took to draw the dagger of
Excommunication: which acquainted Princes no less with the bluntness of his
Weapons, than the keenness of his Malice: By which they were taught to abate,
so much as possibly they could, the reach of his power, lest it should have
increased to an universal prejudice; nothing being more notorious than the
Ambition of the Church, not possibly to be moderated, but by an absolute
restraint, and an open discovery of the Arts used to twist the Interests of
Christ with those purely their own: a medly of Colors apparent to judicious
eyes: with which Religion was so dapled, that it was embraced by the most,
rather out of oste^tation than love, or pure zeal, and so not likely to
continue long.

11. Had he turned the edge of his Ecclesiastical sword against Turks and
Infidels, which he has, since Gregory the great, chose rather to sheath in the
bosom of Christians (whose differences, especially if they entrenched upon his
Supremacy, he fomented into flames) he might have enlarged the extent of his
own jurisdiction by a supply of new Proselytes, who are ever fonder of their
Nurses, than those whose sharper experience of the Coverousnesse, and Ambition
of the Church has weaned from being so highly pleased with the Roman Gue-gaus.
I confess it unsuitable to his Interest, to suffer all or the major part of
Christendom to fall under the jurisdiction of one person, for then his power
would be eclipsed, as the Moon, in Opposition; or quite lost, as the Stars upon
the approach of the Sun: which arraigns him of Indiscretion, for suffering the
German Empire to be Hereditary: easily to have been foreseen, when once it
fell upon so powerful a Prince as Charles the V, not likely to part with any
thing he had once possessed, and now too strongly rooted in the Austrian
Family, ever to be eradicated but at the cost of a total subversion, either by
the Turk or Lutheran Professors.

12. The several Orders and distinct Names they gave the Friars, known to
breed Emulation and Division among them; as is evident about the Conception of
the V. Mary, etc. And the irreconcilable feud between the active Society of
Jesus, and all the other duller Fraternities.

13. Ceremony (though the Body of Religion, yet) is too weak to bear that
Stresse the Priests laid upon it; who should rather have built upon faith, to
which nothing is impossible: Considering withal that though external
behavior may add warmth to zeal, yet a redundancy of it does not seldom
suffocate and extinguish it, by converting it into Idolatry, which is a
palpable mistake in the worship of God, and cannot long, among knowing people,
be held from clamouring for a Reformation; which the Pope should ever have
prevented by a hasty doing it himself: For if once undertaken by the
uninterested Rabble, they will never leave, till the form of worship is
bruised and beaten out of all comeliness, so as nothing can satisfy but the
molding it anew. Which the win of no single Age, much less that contained in a
few Heads, is able to make complete: Church Discipline, well instituted, being
the highest result of all Prudece, God has entrusted men withal: whose
materials too near scrutinized, seem to discover more Policy then Piety; by
the contemplation of which men's Judgments being once dazeld, they are ever
after propense to Athoisme, and a prejudicial jealousy of their Teachers.

14. The Pope neglected the prudentiall carriage of a Miller, who being
supplied with a larger stream than the convenience of his Trade requires,
suffers it to run wast, rather then endanger the subversion of the whole
Engine, he has lived so long happily by. Whereas the Pope permitted the
Ecclesiastics, not only to appropriate to their particular profit, all that
which ignorant zeal did voluntarily and plentifully shower down upon them; but
connived at the Mists and Thunders they raised in the Consciences of Dying men:
By which they became coheirs almost in every Family: Forgetting that A great
Booty invites Theft, at best Envy; it being unlikely, Princes should long
forbear squeezing such Spunges, out of awfulnesse to Religion, as had no better
authority for their dreining their Subjects, than they drew from a foreign
power; owned by the most, rather out of Policy than Piety, especially since it
was ordinary with his Holiness himself to make great Leavies upon no other
reason, than to augment his own, or raise new Empires for his Sons or Nephews.

15. The abundance of such contingencies bred a neglect of their surer and more
legitimate Patrimony, consisting in Tithes and unquestiond Churchoduties; very
sufficient to have maintained a number large enough for the loading the
patience and convenience of the most prudent States, without the addition of
such vast Revenues, not possible to be apprehended but under the notion of
things superfluous in the Church, since Christ in person never owned such
Plenty, which made it seem more undecent in him that pretended to be his Vicar.

16. Fallacies discovered in Miracles which call in question as well those
anciently and truly done, as such as are reported to be new. Thus the pious
Deceits our Ancestors used to bring men to salvation, are not only made Stales
to catch Profit, but isntrumental to Infidelity.

A DISCOURSE IN VINDICATION OF Martin Luther.
HE may be suspected of Hypocrisy, if not Atheism, that too suddenly leapes
out of one Opinion into another; It being impossible for mere flesh and blood,
to pull up all at once a Religion rooted by Costome and Education in the
Understanding, which must be convinced, before it can let in another with any
cordial welcome. I speak not of the ancient and extraordinary Callings of God,
but those experimented in our times, in which over much have does oftentimes
bewray Deceit; As appeared in the Bishop of Spalatto; who in my days left
Italy for fear of Paul the fifth, his enemy, and reconciled himself to the
Church of England; but the old Pope being dead, and his Kinsman in the Chair,
he resumes his former Errors, and goes to Rome, in hope of Preferment, where
contrary to promise, he dies miserably. When Falsehood is fallen-out with for
any other respect, than Love of Truth, it inclines to Atheism, and is so far
from mending the Condition of the Convert, that it renders it worse.

None ever showed greater signs of Gods Spirit, than Luther did; who observed
such Gradations, as it may appear he found faule with nothing; he was not first
led to by the dictates of Conscience: Falling first upon the abuse of
Indulgences, too apparent an Impiety, to pass by so acute a Judgment
undiscovered; From this he ascended to higher Contemplations, which afforded
him the opportunity to take notice of remoter and deeper Errors. His Wit and
Learning having that vast advantage over the stupid Ignorance of those times,
that he bare down all before him, without any other Opposition, than the
contrary Faction was able to raise out of power; much weakened by the desire
all Princes had, to set limits to the Pope's daily Usurpations. And as for the
Books, then writ against him, they did rather shar pen, than blunt the desire
of Change: For the Friars had so long enjoyed a free current of their Doctrine,
without interruption, that they were more intent on the reaping of such Fruit,
as grew from the Errors sown by their Predecessors, than upon Arguments to
defend the^. So as if Princes, that were weary of the Yoke of Rome, had wanted
the guidance of Luther, it is not easle to say, whither they might have
wandered. And though Charles the fifth, then Emperor, to keep his subjects in
obedience, did seem to discountenance the Schism (as they called it) yet he was
content to shut up the Pope in the Castle of S. Angelo. Which proves his small
affection, and the truth of this Tenet, that if ever Christendom falls under
one Monarch, or turns into popular States, the power of the Pope will be lost,
or confined to Rome; being at this day only kept up, like a Shittle-cock, by
the bandying of Princes.

It Is objected against Luther, That he was too passionate, using irreverent
speeches toward some in Authority? Yet so much of this fault, as Zeal leaves
unexcused, may be imputed to his Education. All can be said, is, He was but a
Man, and subject to Common Infirmities; And because his ene mies do so often
object this, it is strongly to be presumed, his worst fault. I could have
wished, he had not married a Nun: but I believe he did it to show People, The
Quarrel was irreconcilable, as Absalom projected when he polluted his Fathers
bed: And in this sense, the benefit takes away much of the blame; which lay not
in the unlawfullnesse, but the inexpediency of the fact. And to show, God did
not curse his Match (Though he might participate of the fate of other learned
men, who seldom find their abilities, represented in their Issue; yet) he left
three such Sons, as did not give his enemies occasion to upbraid his memory
with them.

For the Real Presence, maintained by him in the Sacrament, it does not so
much condemn his Judgment in this, as it justifies his Integrity in all the
rest: He being as resolute to vindicate what he thought true, against the
persuasions of his Friends, as he was against the threats and promises of his
Enemies: For if any by-respect could have warped him, it would have been a
desire to appease the hot Dispute, the retention of this error raised in his
Own Party, wholly of his judgment but in this particular, in which Zwinglius,
and the Helvetian Church did oppose him. And if this be not enough to wash him
clean from the imputation of Self Ends and Covetousness, the Proverb used in
Germany may, That Poor Luther made many rich.

As he was protected from a number of apparent mischiefs, so the same had freed
him from many hidden, in respect of the eyes of the world; it being impossible,
that he, who had galled so many Grandees, should not have Revenge laid in wait
for him, in every corner: Experience proving, that Kings themselves can scarce
whisper against the Court of Rome, but the Knife is ready to give them a final
Answer. His Death was with as little Molestation, as his Life was full: For
being called to the County of Mansfield, the place of his birth, to determine a
Case in controversy between two Princes of that Family, he died there in the
sixty third year of his Age.

Had the Apostles, nay our Savior himself been alive, and maintained what
Luther did, they had been persecuted by the Clergy: Therefore the Crucifying
of Christ is no prodigy in Nature, but daily practiced: among men: For he that
can find the heart to stigmatize and whip his Brother, for an Error merely in
Judgment, would never have spared Peter or Paul, coming with no more visible
Authority then they had. But this is not the way to suppress an Heresy, since
most are jealous of that opinion, which uses the Sword for her Defense; Truth
having been long since determined to be most strong: And where Oppression is,
there for the most part, she is supposed to be. This shows as little Discretion
as Charity in such as persecute those, that may be in the Right; or; if not,
shall by this means, be kept the longer in the Wrong. If a Horse starts, the
more he is beaten, the harder he is kept in the way; but let him stand, and
have leisure to consider what he blanched at, and he will perceive it is a
Block, and so go on. Yet it is neither cruelty nor imprude^ce, to restrain such
furious Spirits (as they do Dogs) that will bawl and fly at all they do not
know: But I should be utterly against burning their Books in public, if they
have once gained the light: which only adds to their price, and saves them a
labor; because, if the State did not put them in credit, by their notice, they
would perhaps, after a while for shame, burn them themselves. The Whip reforms
not so much as he that endures it; but is taken as a triumph by the Faction,
increasing their animosity, if not their number; So that in effect it proves a
punishment to none but the honest and tenderhearted of the people, who cannot
choose but be scandalized, to see the Image of God defaced, by cutting Eaves,
and slitting Noses, etc. And this raises a strong suspicion, that the Hand of
Justice would not lie so heavy only on the preciser fide, but that something
inclines it that may at last turn to the subversion of the most moderate part.

The Dutch, though they tolerate all Religions and Tenants, yet none increased
to their prejudice, till they strove to suppress the Arminians, who are in
taste as like the Papists, as Scallions are to Onions; all the difference is,
that the latter is the stronger: Yet since they have let them alone, this
Opinion is observed to be less numerously attended.

Had the Pope seasonably reformed the Error Luther discovered so apparently, in
the publication of Indulgences, and rewarded him a Bishopric. for his Learning
and Zeal, let him afterward have said what he pleased: it would have been
looked upon by the people as of no credit: who like nothing so well, as what
goes cross to the grain of Authority.

The Lord Treasurer Cecil, having been unsufferably abused by Libels, sent for
the Poet, and, after he had ratled him soundly, began to take notice of the
poor fellows good parts, saying,, It might be, vexatious poverty compelled him
to make use of false, though common Rumors, given out by such as hated all in
Authority; To ease which he gave him 20 pieces, promising to take the first
opportunity to advance him. This favor (most contrary to his expectation, who
would willingly have given one ear to have saved the other) did so work with
him, and the rest of the Pasquillers of the time, that, till the Treasurers
death, none used the like Invectives. Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, used
the like demeanor toward some Gentlemen that had laid the imputation of
Sodomy to his Charge, etc.

Clemency seldom causes repentance in an established Kingdom, or if it
proves a fault, it is easily mended; Whereas Cruelty can never be recalled,
raising a far greater Party out of a thirst of Revenge. than ever yet could be
mustred up from the hope of Impunity.

Therefore to conclude, since Luther alone had the power to do so much, let us
not be thus severe against others, that having their zeal kindled (though
perhaps at the wrong end) run madding through the world; but rather pity them,
if they be in an error: Because they something resemble the first Messengers
of Truth.

FINIS.
