THE BELGIC LION DISCOVERD.
It Is done! the Belgic Lion, whose loud roar
Filled all the Ocean from Shore to Shore
With Noise and Vapor; is uncas'd, and now
Discovers both his Ears, and Body too;
Those Swollen Romantique Papers which have flown
Abroad and filled each Part of Christendom
With Lying Rumors, which proclaimed what you
Both had Designed and were resolved to Do
That durst with base unhallowed Ink defile
The Reputation of the Noblest Isle
Great Neptune's Arms e're circled, nay blaspheme
That Sacred Head which wears a Diadem
Second to none in Europe, now appear
Just Monuments both of your Shame and Fear
True Pourtraits of your Baseness, Wretched Slaves
Did you believe that your Batavian Braves
Could fright the British Monarch? Skellums, no!
The greatest of your Force is much below
His cheapest Thoughts; though all your Here Is wore Crown
Rich as the Sun e're saw, though all your Towns
Were Hogen-Mogen Empires, though your Souls
Were keener then your Cheese, and your fat Joules
Big as your Brandy, yet he will give you knocks
^uch as will break the strongest Butter-box;
Will melt you into your first Mass, and then
You Will be the Poor distressed States again;
But you were got on Tip-toe the Air of France
^^d purged Phlegm, and taught you how to dance,
These new Lavaltoes, dull-brain'd stupid Rogues.
Worst then the worst of men, then Indian Jogues
Could you forget what great ELIZA did
When A^^as Duke, Colossus like bestrid
Your Jadish Backs, when the Inquisition tore
Your heart strings out, and bathed your sides in Core,
When Sea and Land were both shut up, and you
Neither knew where to stay, nor how to go,
The English Valor then, (so much of late
Despised by you) buoyed up your sinking State,
Rescued you from that Force, by which you were
Thrown down into the bottom of Despair,
These then were favors, which to do you right
You ever since have labored to requite
Witness the Kindness, which by you was shown
To us at Banda, and at Pulleroon
Amboina's Mercies too were great, and such
As did to all men speak you truly DVTCH,
Know then you Fen-bred Frogs, the time is come
Will give you a just Retribution
The Mighty God, the God of Battles has
Furbish'd that Sword which saved you then, to pass
Thorough your Bowels now, that hand which he
Advanced to break your Bonds and set you free
He Will arm with Vengeance, and Vindictive Rage,
To beat you into your first Vassallage.
