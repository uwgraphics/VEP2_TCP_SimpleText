The merry Country MAIDS ANSWER To the Country Lovers Conquest:
Exactly a description she does make
And gets it Printed for her Sweet-hearts sake
Of all his Courting Complements and Lies,
His proper person, and his quallities
The match is half made up, you will say good firs,
For she has his good will, he wants hers.
The Tune is, Once I Loved a Lass with a Rolling Eye.




ONce I knew a Lad
with a brazen face
His Carriage was so bad
When he did me-imbrace
That I could not love him,
had he bags of Gold
Money shall not tempt me.
I will not be fooled,
I could not endure him
truth I do not mock,
Cause that in his Cradle
he received a knock.
You heard how this clown
began to Complement,
Though maids did on him frown,
he gave himself content.
He was mighty gallant
being Clothed in Gray
He thought no girl in the Nation.
ere would say him nay
But this is my humor,
Since that maids may Choose
I scorn such silly fellows,
ere should wipe my shoes.
The Second Part
to the same Tune.
THis same simple fellow
void of wit or grace,
Made bold attempt,
and stair'd me in the face*
He made no other question,
but I were his own,
As by these following verses
to you shall be shown,
To this height and bigness
he could Crack and lie,
Yet our folks can witness
he were scarce Hog high.
Of his house and Land,
he would brag and boast,
Ift was worth twenty pound,
I Am sure that was the most,
Likewise of his Cattle
he did often prate.
His tongue went prittle prattle,
to get him a mate.
His case I never pitied,
cause his means were small
Besides he was half witted
which was worst of all.
Sarah said he danced,
just like to a Clown.
Nan did vow and swear,
the boys would put him down
Doll and Sue and Prudence
could not him abide,
Though Frank smiled upon him
she did him deride,
He was such a fellow,
when he danced a Iig
He kissed like Punchanello
or a sucking Pig.
The space of half an hour
this Lobcock he did pra^e.
I had no other poker
but lay him over the pate,
When he understood
I could not him abide,
He in a sullen mood
then Sat him down and Cri^^
Quoth his foolish mother,
why art thou so slack.
Once again go try her,
clapping him o'th back.
Then undauntedly,
without wit or fear,
He to my face did say
that I must be his dear.
Although I did slave him,
he was impudent,
In truth I would not have him
if he owned Kent.
Thus he was deceived
as you plainly see,
Cause our Resolutions,
could not well agree.
He need not Leap for joy,
of any thing he gained.
Nor made the VVo^ld to know
a Wife he had obtaine'd
For rather then I Will marry,
such a Clownish Jack
I Will buy a witty fellow,
Clothes to put on^s back
Though some fools have Fortune
this we daily see
And does Conquer many,
None shall conquer me
