In victissimo Monarchae CAROLO Secundo Deo Gratia Magnae Britanniae, Franciae,
and Hiberniae Regi, Fidei Defensori, etc.
BEllipotens, delapse Polo! nostri Hanibal Aevi

Nostri Atlas ter magne Orbis! cui Robur in Armis
Inque Animis, geminos subdere posse polos.
Regnorum, Mundique Tremor! Quid plura? modesta

Indulge, O! Vestras strepitu si turbet olivas
Musa Caledonii nata sub axe poli.

To the Most High and Mighty Monarch CHARLES the Second, by the Grace of God
King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
HEavens potent Champion; our times Hanibal!
Caesar, his Trophies, must to Yours, let fall.
Such Praise, and Triumphs do adorn your Fame,
That foreign Countries tremble at your Name.
Great Atlas of our Orb! whose armed Might,
And power over Minds, can both the Poles affright;
The World, and Kingdoms fear! What more? brave Souls
Their Praises with contracted brows controuls.
If my poor Muse, born in a Northern Clime,
Disturb your Laurel, pardon (Sir) the crime;
You, who alone (like Phoebus) vigor give,
Inspire me with your beams, and I shall live.
Shall I (Great CHARLES) be banished from Your sight,
Whose Clemency all things to You invite?
Draw in Your Glories, whilst I sing Your Praise,
Least my Muse perish by Your God-like Rays.

Excellentissimo Clarissimo et Prudentissimo Domino, Domino GEORGIO MONCK
Exercituum Magnae Britanniae and Hyberniae Generali.
UR bis and Orbis Amor, dis Candide, Gentis Avitae
Delitiae, and Patriae cara Medela tuae.
Fama Tui attonitum cum repleat inclyta Mundum?
Nostra ne, erit Famae Buccina, Musa, Tuae?
Spirat Hyperboreis tanto te Praeside terris,
Et resonat Factis terra Britanna tuis.
Primus in Heroum numero spectabere, Primus
Restrinxtique Armis Arma superba Tuis,
Quum calida haec premeret Lamberti factio Regna
RUM Puntur vestra, vincula nostra manu.
Eheu! praecipites ruimus discordibus Armis,
In diversa trahunt Ambitio, Ira, Dolus.
In vetitum trahimur, damnosaque poscimns Arma
Tu mira sanas soecla Machaon open.
Praelia quis Te plura iniit tam Mart secundo?
Quis Te Virtute, aut Nobilitate prior?
Robore, Mente, Animis ingens, ingentior ausis.
Quem tibi, quem de lerint saecula prisca parem?
Schismatici frustra Arma petunt, coelumque minantur
Eraenati, cunctis tu satis unus eris.
Sat mihi te tanto coram prodire Patrono;
Sat mihi me vestro posse sub orb legi.
Te sequor usque libens; haec Tecum Pignora dextrae;
Hancque Animam Patriae do, voveoque meae.
Quod si ino pina meis surgat laus ulla Camaenis,
Sola erit in lauds attribuenda tuas.
Istaque si nostrae placeant primordia Musae,
Haecque repentinis carmina scripta sonis,
Restat Opus quo (Te invito) formidine pulsa
Ebibet Oceanum Musa benigna tuum.
Romani Arma gerunt, subnixi viribus Orbis,
Vires Arma Orbis, dextera sola tua
Romanam ut Fabius cunctando Restituit REM
Sic Auctor Patriae Pacis es, atque Pater.
Des divina Deo, tua serves, sint sua REGI,
Cuique suum tribuens, sic tibi surgat honos
Accipe Wickhamici clara ex Antistitis Aedde
Exigui ingenii Pignora cara Mei.
V. E. ex fratre amantissimo Nepotis and servi addictissimi, Gulielmi Moorehead
novi Coll. Soc.

To his Excellency George Monck, Lord General of all the Forces of England,
Scotland, and Ireland.
THE World and Cities Joy, of God and Man
Beloved, thy Countries dear Physician.
When all the Earth does Trophies to You raise,
Why should my Muse not trumpet out your praise?
Scotland of such a President does boast,
Your deeds are Echoed round our British coast:
Amongst the Hero's you deserve to be
Ranck'd first, who first did conquer Tyranny,
When Lamberts Faction plagued us more and more,
You dockt the RUMP, and turned them out of door:
Alas! we are headlong into discord hurled.
Pride, Anger, and Deceit inflames the World;
Whilst old sores bleed afresh, and rage abounds,
You (like Machaon) heal our gaping Wounds.
What man e're drew a Sword with such success?
Who is like you in worth and nobleness?
Great in your strength, and spirit, greater far
In bold Attempts; who can with you compare?
In vain Phanatiques take up Arms, since you
Alone suffice their Armies to subdue.
I Am satisfied, if these lines may before
My Patron come; but houour'd if read over.
Upon your Lordship, willingly I wait,
And thus my Countries Genius dedicate.
If my poor Muse gain unexpected Bays,
I Will render back to you alone the praise.
If these beginnings of our Poetry
(Written in have) unto you pleasing be,
A Work remains, wherein (against your will)
My Muse her salys shall at your Ocean fill.
With the whole world the Romans did contend,
Your right hand only does the Globe defend.
Fabius Cunctation did restore the Thing;
You bring us peace in bringing home the King.
Glory to God, to Caesar his due give,
To each his own, and your Fame long shall live.
From Bishop Wickhams Famous College sent
These lines I to your Lordship do present.
LACHRIMAE Sive Valedictio SCOTIAE
SIc vario Rectore ferar? Scotiae expostulatio.
nunquamne recurret
Dulce favens nostrae stabilis constantia sorti?
Fortunae sio ludus eam? velut icta rotatu
Assiduo tenues vorsum pila fertur in auras;
Concussae cui nulla quies? sic usque sereno
Obveniet nox atra meo? vicibusque sinistris
Turbida Solstitium tenebrabunt nubila nostrum?
Tantisper stabili sic O! viduata Magistro,
Haec mea caeruleo jactabitur Insula Nereo?
Nec constans Palinurus erit? Semperne phacelus
Trita tot oppositis distendet Carbasa ventis?
Sic teritur varioque Scotia.
Chelys tot pollice torpens
Rauca tot attonito diffundet murmura mundo,
Discordi stridore crepans! miserere Sororis
Regnorum vos diva Anglia.
tremor? cui tanta recumbunt
Imperia, and nostri moles quota, quanta Colossi
Barbitos en rigidis quondam temerata choraulis
(Triste sub Arcadicis postquam increpuisset asellis)
Dulce quid o nostris, post tot modo rauca colonis,
Te Moncho modulante dedit, quo Preside plectrum
Extima divino rapuit confinia cantu;
Desuper hic Coelo tandem delapsus ab alto
Dux mihide pulso successit Orione, Per Orion subinnuit pristinos reges, aut
gubernat. natores.
Arion,
Flexanimi oppositas resonando pectine chordas.
Dumque coaxantes avido de gutture Ra^as,
Grassantes olim per pascua nostra cicadas,
Summus Atlas nostris postquam heu! expulsus ab oris.
Scilicet hunc dulcem mihi tandem indultus olorem
Hic equidem mihi primus olor, mihi primus Arion
Concinuit perdulce melos, plectroque retenso
Torpida tripudiis stimulavit viscera laetis.
Nec mora divino tandemque Monachius aestro
Art, and Mart, potens parili, Semonis adempti,
Scandit ovans tumulos successor Orionis, Orpheus
Invehitur, Regimenque subit, Cytharaeque remissae
Fila repentino passim discordia raptu
Harmonicis sociando sonis, modulamine miro
Arboreos de sede choros, fluviosque, ferasque,
Saxeaque Angelico perrupit pectora cantu,
Praeside quo Stigii tremuere umbrosa Tyranni
Limina, suspirans imo de cord Megera
Ingemuit, torvas spectans truculenta sorores;
Et caudam tumido sub ventre recondidit ingens
Cerberus attonitas stimulans ululatibus umbras,
Commotusque niger Cocytus inhorruit antris,
Et vaga Sisypheis haeserunt saxa lacertis:
Nec tamen hic rapti successor Orionis, Orpheus
Quem canimus, meritoque ducem depingimus ostro;
Diversum intentabat iter, sed passibus aequis
Institit; egregios complendo fortiter ortus;
Grandiaque insumpti lustrans primordia pensi,
Magnanimosque ausus, intentatosque labores,
Gnaviter abrepti pressit vestigia Divi.
Macte Animi Generose Atlas! nova gloria nostri
Orbis, and ad seros fama O! ventura nepotes
Nec precor O! justas dubites agnoscere lauds!
Te licet invito celebro, da velle; canoris
Si non posse modis meriti sublimia vestri
Culmina tanta, humili nobis contingere pulsu.
O liceat (digno si non te ornare Cothurno)
At mihi praelustri saltem me ornare sereno
Solstitii per cuncta tui? da cernere flammas
Lucentesque globos, and vestri sydera coeli
Ignea, luminibus procul avertentia vestris:
Da Scotiae dux ultro sequi? da dicere nostri
Eversorem Erebi, propulsoremque ruinae,
Te solum and nostras Phoebum expulsisse tenebras
Gratius and nostro qua nemo beatius unquam
Laetitia demulsit Ebur; non si ipse superbus
De Delpho jam jamque suo redivivus Apollo
Surgeret, and digitis plectrum pulsaret eburnis.
Nec tamen hic vanis praeconia vendere ventis,
Men's mihi, vel falso indigitem depingere Fuco;
Ipsa quidem so li virtus sibi sufficit, omni
Pieridum, vatumque obductu purior ostro:
Sat radiis ditata suis: men's celsa potentem
Sponte facit, dignumque suo Diademate virtus;
Tale tenes meriti spatium, ut mortalia supra
Ingenito assurgas Genio, virtutibus, omni
Dote Animi, quem si Semonem prisca tulissent
Saecula Romany quondam stupefacta Triumphis
Ausonium intrasses Roma ad plaudente Tribunal
Primus, and haud alio stabilis sub Caesare Consul.
Aut si te Phrygeo Danaae sub littore classes
Vidissent, Danai tacuissent Nestora, vates.
Nec tamen haec vestras metitur Caledonia lauds;
Nititur aut meriti rimarier ostia vestri;
Sed mage mellifluos satagens mirarier alveos
Luxuriet, fuso sese ebrietate liquore.
Quo feror o dum tanta fero? quorsum impete vano
Men's mihi per moles discurrit sedula magnas,
Plus semper quo quaerit habens? non si mihi centum
Ora sonent, totidemque uno de gutture linguae,
Aoindesque juvent; non si mihi semper adesset
Eloquii oceanus, spirant praecordia Phaebo,
Si mihi vel dederint coelestia dona Diones,
Ingentes valeam Monckei Praesidis actus
Enumerare, meoque amplecti singula cantu.
Sed dolor heu! Introductio ad discessum Monachi.
dum prona ruo, dumque inclyta nostris
Iam modo Monckei surgebat adorea rythmis
Triste quod O! streperis superingerit invida plectris
Sors vicibus male fida suis, nervisque remissis
Flectit ebur lugubre sonans: sic omnia caeca
Commiscet fortuna manu, petulantior Euro
Stare loco nescit, variasque induta figuras
Splendida, nunc tetra est, nunc turbida, nocte peerrans
Ludit in humanis nunquam non lubrica rebus.
Quem modo blandentis subridens gratia sortis
Lenimen, lumen, columen, numenque labenti
Dulce dedit, tantis successibus aemula raptum
Intulit, and nostros nobis subduxit Amores.
Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia limes
At nunc ter faelix tanto gaudere Patrono,
Ac Regni qui fraena sui justo ordine centum,
Et Septem Regum viginti saecula retro
Faelici rexere manu, queis gloria solis
N on interruptam seriem tenuisse regendi
Et non externos unquam timuisse furores.
Ecqua (per O) nostras Metamorphosis involat oras!
Sic facies transversa poli est? mundine dehiscit
Fabrica? sic septem Borea sub part Triones
Permiscent pelago lachrymas? sic prisca Boots
Plaustra fugit? Number prisca Helyces custodia pernox
Negligitur? Number prisca lyrae modulamina nostrae
Pressa silent rabido damnosi vulturis aestu
Nec pelago dent laeta meo? Proh tristia Scoti
Auguria, and subiti portentum immane Comaetae!
Nec mirum; Coeline ruant convexa, remoto
Vique Atlantiaca? tantine operosa Colossi
Machina Olympifero ruet in sua pristina raptu? Quetela Scotiae.

Dii mihi! numne meo lux haec sit praebita coelo
Ut subito rapiatur, erit? sic luditur? and sic
Gliscit in expleto furor implacabilis aestro?
Satne datum vicibus? sic, O sic usque retrorsum?
Vortet praecipites levis inconstantia currus.
Satne precor Ruptura prior, sed and altera, Nobis
Tristior obveniet? Satne o Mihi Carolo 2.
ARIONE adempto.
Me nuper plexisse, and sic spoliasse (merentem
Forsitan, and tanti indignum solamine Divi)
Satne Mihi haec jactura gravis? sed and insuper ORPHEO
Abrepto, rigidi geminantur fulmina fati?
Vivimus! an nigro miseri concessimur Orco?
Quod scelus! unde ira Superum! Pro dira Sororum
Pensa! nec in tantos quondam ingeniosa furores;
Scilicet O tanto cur me sic sternitis ictu
Numina; in hoc lugubri nimium crudelia raptu.
Sic Numerus sumus, and viles contemnimur umbrae,
Degeneresque Animae, vicibus hinc inde sinistris
Iugiter assiduo fatorum turbine raptae,
An precor Aethereas me me evexistis in arces
Ut lapsu graviore ruam? nuperne dedistis
Spem Mihi, concessam lubet O sic sort reversa
Tollere, and in veter^^me praecipitare ruinas?
Huc Nemesis Furiaeque pares! da sugere in iras
Da versus Mihi Phoebe truces, tristesque querelas
Fundere, sollicitis Dominumque reposcere votis.
Insanire lubet (quid enim manifesta negemus,
Saepe quidem insano pietas prorumpit ab ^^stu;)
Fas Mihi fas Tecum furibundo cominus aestro.
Diva Soli, Scotiae expostulatio cum Anglia
Domitrixque Maris, formidine pulsa
In lites certare pias, (nec enim improba si Te
Fraterna Ratione premam) da surgere nostram
Ante Rates causam, lachrimarumque imbre soluto,
Heu nimium imparibus tecum contendere telis!
Diva (per O) quorsum quorsum in dispendia nobis
Commissum hoc nostris revocasti Numen ab oris?
Ecquid enim, nunquid satius tibi tollere dona
Quam donasse fuit, donatumque omine tristi
Surripere, hoc fuerat nobis velut invida luctus?
Anne quod O nostrae videaris ut aemula sorti?
Anne quod Ipsa tui indigeas moderamine Divi?
Suspicor hoc equidem, (nec enim delirat Aruspex
Fatidicus) Memini, ah Memini, quod ab Ilice cornix
Nescio raucidu his crocitans, praedixerat ipsis
Sub primis Divi auspitiis, hunc nocte remota
Affore, qui nostris Lucem importaret ab oris,
Halcyonumque dies, atque insperata Colonis
Gaudia, successusque hilares, and tempora votis
Consona, sed subitis rapiendum ex inde quadrigis
Ut rerum graviora ferat, Proh tristia Fati
Auguria! nostris hodie completa querelis.
O Dux Magne (licet Tecum sed poplite flexo, Scotix expostulatio cum
Cubernatore Dom. Monacho.

Nube sub hac rigidi mihi fas contendere fati)
Fare agedum, O quis Te tanta in fastidia nobis
Egit, et incaeptos crudel is rupit Amores?
Ecquid io! credamne miser? vertigo cerebrum
Number capit? an tanti vana sub imagine damni
Stulta laboriferam deludunt somnia mentem?
O exspes spes fluxa! quid O! quid abire paratis
Illustres Animae! quorsum O dulcedine tanta,
Sic radii placuere Tui, vultusque sereno
Sole micans, vestrique hilaris praesentia coeli?
Ecquid io! vix visus abis! tantumne licebat
Adspicere, and vestro mentem exhilarare sub ortu
Ostendendus ades nobis; tandemque Catervis
Anglorum rapiendus eris? sic mess sub ipsa
Conglomeras Te (Dive Tibi)! sic invide (verbo
Heic veniam) Autumni juvat O tot grandia vestri
Incrementa alios Tecum subducere in usus;
Integra sic meriti faelix vindemia vestri
(Te removente) Tuo furtim intumul abitur horreo?
Nec dabitur Te pone sequi, spicasque cadentes
Colligere, and vestros gustu vix prendere odores?
Praemodicae quae causa morae! dic Dive coruscum
Exeris occultando jubat? superingere causam
Ocyus! and tantae fontem disclude repulsae!
Number tenui quod sort ferar, quodque infima fusas
Tot circum videar gentes? quod grandibus ausis
Virtuti multum inferior per singula vestrae
Tale quod heic de Te number suspicer aemula? nostrum
Cui merito pridem regimen subrisit! and ultra
Men's (humili sub valle latens) contendere nunquam
Pruriit! hac sola contentus sort fuisses,
In Te sublimes si non pia numina dotes,
Ingentemque Animum rebus gravioribus aptum
Vidissent, Tua Te Virtus, Probitasque, Fidesque
Et Meriti sublimis Apex, Famaeque loquacis
Impetus, invito nostris semovit ab arvis.
O Animi (effusis nimium virtutibus) aucti
Robur, and ingenii tanta in fastigia prompti
Insita vis, supra Astra volans? O parcius in Te
Blandula nectareos fudissent numina rores,
Et Vires nostrae pariles tantummodo Genti!
Sed (dolor heu) tanto se evacuavit acervo
Prodiga sub vestris coeli Indulgentia cunis.
Sed quid in hoc! streperis quorsum velut ebria Rythmis
Numina, vesano juvat attemerare tumultu?
Number Superos, number Fata querar; number praebita Divo
Munera, tot dotesque Animi! temeraria fundit
Verba miser quisquis caelestibus obstrepit Astris
Nesoius? and recti Trutinam non pensat Olympi?
Me querar Authorem potius; detur omine tristi
Velle Mihi propriis in me confligere telis,
Arguor heu coelo scelerum rea, spargitur ether
Flagitiis hinc inde meis? meritoque flagello
Rupturae (Dux Magne) Tuae, mihi terga dehiscunt,
Verberor haud insons? dirum ac miserabile vitae
Supplicium hoc, vestro fera fert and carmina raptu:
Crimina cuderunt mihi tot discrimina, nostrum
Triste nefas, vestro long castroque remoto
Iamque movere ardet? vitiis pia numina nostris
Horrendum commota fremunt, raptuque severo
Te tandem nostris satagunt subducere terris.
Nec tamen indomitis nostris removebere ab oris,
Vel furtim ad patrios Tua Te vehet Argo Penates
Prosequar, (and fari liceat) Te prosequar aestro
Forsan Amatoris saevi sed semper Amoris
Te contra insurgam stimulis haud mollibus, aucto

Tantundem obsequio sic discruciabere nostro;
Pondere terga gement vario, fusisque querelis

Atque hedera, Lauruque, and quicquid tempora grati

Suggerit, immiscens varios natura colores,
Inclyta solenni decorabit Tempora cultu?
Te quocunque Polus rapiat, per sicca, per undas,
Dona per, and Meriti sublimia culmina vestri,
Ibo comes, Patremque sequar, raptumque reposcam
Auguriis, votisque premam; gremioque recondam

Diminuet Sors nulla meos; ruat Orbis, Olympus

Involat, immemoremque Mei, per singula reddit.
Quam lubuit dixisse (Redi) sed justa negoti
Suspitio gravioris obest, exspemque repellit.
Irrita ne refragos videar deposcere Divos,
Et tamen, O dilecte, Vale! Vale! urget Orexis
Obsequii, tantumque Tibi devovit Amoris
Impetus, and Meriti Pietas sat conscia vestri.
Quid moror! extremum dum sic Mihi Classica cantum
Ingeminant, dum ipsa suis clangoribus Argo
Aesonidem imperiosa vocet, Consurge catervis
Ocyus O gens fusa Tuis, glomeramine facto
Magnates, Proceresque, and Gens trabeata Quiritum,
Curia quos, vel Rostra tenent, vel Pulpita fundunt
Sacra Sacerdotes, vel quos Edina ministrat,
(Insignes pietate patres) facto Agmine primi
Sollennes ducant Choreas, Bellona Phalanges
Evocet, and longa secum trahat agmina pompa:
Agmina migrantem circumtectura Magistrum
Pone ruat Plebs prona, suo solitoque tumultu
Sit strepor, and fuso paulum data copia vulgo,
Sic stupeat stupor ipse hodie, descendat Olympus
Spectando, excitus studio dum talia nostris
(Heu nimium properata) patent spectacula terris.
Interea ignivomis suprema palatia nimbis
Grande tonent; fuso globulorum grandine, tellus
Icta tremat; stupefacta imis in vallibus Echo
Evigilet, sonituque pari responsa remittat;
In flammas sic ether eat, sic percita late
Compita, sulphureis clarescant plena favillis;
Et solito Scloppis paulum de more solutis,
Horridus ardentes miles vertatur in ignes;
Obsequio flagrans humili, devotaque tanto
Thura Duci, faustumque Vale per fulmina fundat.
Tandem clara sua Dalkethea reddit ab Aula
Triste salutandum populo; Patremque Ducemque
Gentis, consuetoque cubilia Numine plena
Sic O mole sua (per murmura, perque Triumphos,
Per Luctus, Laudesque pares; perque hostica Amoris
Tela; per applausus tristes, per mill susurras;
Per desiderii flammas; per fulmina Zeli;
Plana per, anfractusque pares, atque invia rerum;
Seque per O Ipsum pariter, per viscera contra
Se sua, crudelem Domini damnantia raptum,
Mill per ingenita, and sibi mansuetudinis aestus,
Mill per oppositas Animi dubitabilis undas,
Fusaque tantarum per tot discrimina rerum,
Secum multa Animo (nostris graviora) revolvens
Procedat fusa Phaenix ad littora pompa.
Quo te agis O lasciva Chelys? per nubila saepe
Fit Iubar, and tenebris lux emicat alma sub ipsis!
Triste piis nil essediu; conceditur, arcu
Seposito, Cytharam tandem Pater urget eburnam;
Extremum perpende Vale, dum littora Phaenix
Vestra premit, streperis paulum desiste querelis;
Et Patris infandas heic imbibe laeta loquelas.
Gens tantas perpesa vices! Oration D. Monachi ad Scotos.
Fatique protervis
Usque adeo subjecta rotis! tot trita sinistris
Aestubus, and circumfusi glomeramine Ponti
In cumulum contracta tuum, vix insula (damni
Oceanum dum trano tui) tamen Insula, nostrae
Es soror, invictis pridem commissa Britannis,
Gens raptu commota meo! quorsum aegra furores
Nec quicquam, and varios dispergis in aethera quaestus?
Signantur decreta poli! Sententia Divum
De reditu stat firma meo, (sic lumina rore
Tersit in hoc tumebunda pio) stans adspice castrum
Quo vehar, and vestris actutum abducorab oris,
Me supra est, qui Regna rotat, cui publica nostri
Tota Orbis res prona subest: parere paratum
Me viden? and subter tanto Omnipotente Ministrum
Morigerum, vestris qui me nunc evocat oris
Arbitrio, Nutuque suo; Qui Me tibi pridem
Miserat, and triplicae Gentis dominatur habenas,
Me, me alio jam jamque vocat; nec constat, an inde
(Pondere supposito hoc) long graviora supersint
Hisce humeris subeunda meis? Det Robur Olympi
Rector, and aequales in tanta negotia vires!
Atque equidem hoc quanto per tot discrimina nisu
Vestra meis suffulta humeris sit Scotica moles;
Testor in hoc circumfusas hinc inde catervas.
Illicet (and fateor, laudis procul absit inanis
Gloria, dum memoro) cultu meliore nitescit

Fila suis stant aequa locis: latet anguis in herba
Intus adhuc, tacita nonnulla coaxat in alvo
Rana crepans, removenda minis, quae Schismate facto
Laxat in oppositos discordia fila furores;
Illicet haec Lerna est, vestris damnosa colonis,
In qua centenis dominatur hiatibus Hydra,
Hydra recens obitu, validis cui nulla sagittis
Vis potis indomito si non Carolus 2.

Aut videar vestris altum Valedicere Rebus;

Dixit! and Eloquio sic per compendia fu so
Pacati assensere poli, fusisque catervis
Tranquillum rediere Animi, perque agmina late
Murmur iit: rupto veluti cum spumeus alveo
Arva super gratos emittit Nilus acervos:
Ebr ia luxuriant sata, (quondam mortua) valles
Tripudiant, pictos promittunt pascua flores:
Ocyus applausu circumstans turmaque tanto
Percita, sulphureos sese inflammavit in ignes!
Ascensu lasciva suo; sic undique rerum
Iucundae exultant facies, torp reremoto
Dulcia sub tristem renovantur gaudia raptum.
Ista inter dum sic violenta aspergine pectus
Curarum spumabat aquis, aestuque fremebat
Tot vario postquam sese evacuasset Amore,
Discedens Scotiae tandem Dux Maximus, Arma
Max capit, and vocis resonantia murmura tantae cunctamine presso
Pertaesam querulamque morae, Gentemque salutans,
Desiliit sublimis equo,
Mollia suaveolam porrexit ad oscula dextram,
Tum vero infremuere Animi, tacitusque per artus
Horror iit, subito vulgi pia pectora bellis
Plena tument, tumidos Amor aemulus urget honores,
Et luctus celeres ciet in certamina lauds,
Bella intus sibi quisque movet; nunc haesitat; and nunc
Fidus ovat, dum spectat iter, desperate; at inde
Dum jubar, en Phaebi lustrat venientis, abortam
Spem fovet, and tantis spondet sibi laeta sub umbris.
Sic ubi forte viro vastum super Aequor ituro
(Ad sua transtra ratis, scisso redit Anchora fundo)
Haeret amica uxor, certatque innectere collo
Brachia, manantesque oculos atque oscula turbat
Vastacaligo maris, retinet mora nulla paratum,
Ipsa quidem vano necquicquam numine questu
Sollicitat, sponsumque tonat sibi remige verso
Actutum furibunda dari; sicque irrita late
Verba vomens, Patrios dolet increbrescere ventos,
Et faustum vix optat iter; sed and optat, and ardet;
Ardet Amor, longo fugientia Carbasa visu
Dulce sequi; variasque sibi movet anxia curas.
Stat tamen, and notam puppim de rupe salutat
Turbida, ter geminoque Vale, Vale, urget euntem.
Sic tandem (vix sponte suos repetenda penates)
Orba licet Domino, charo tamen aucta Pupillo
Spiranti per cuncta Patrem requiescit; and aucto
Spe jam blandidulo sese oblectatur Julo.
Talis erat Domino quantum commota remoto,
Tantundem ingesto Gens luxuriosa Magistro.
Dinde Caledoniis abrepto numineab oris,
Londini adglomerata Cohors, solennia pulsis
Luctibus (occulto licet obluctantibus aestu)
Dulcia inire parat, Redit O! Risuque Triumphat
Tota novo, tanto sub Directore Caterva!
Qualiter extremi supremo in cardine Mundi
Purpureis rutilans pennis, comptissima Phaenix
Fulva viget, caudam roseis interlita punctis,
Aethaereum per inane volans flammantia Phaebi
Lumina, nativo (mirandum) illuminat ostro;
Effusas voluerum rapiens per nubila turmas:
Sic redeunt Cives; reditumque applausibus ornant
Magnates, Iuvenesque, and quos Bellona Phalanges
Struxerat, unanimis vulgi applaudente Caterva
Illum autem in mediis, Ostroque Auroque coruscum;
Rorantem placidos divini Nectaris imbres
Prona Cohors miro circumvallabat honor.
Vive tuis faelix fatis (dux Magne) ruentis
Praesidium, Columenque orbis, tutela Britannum.
I, surge in famam, quae jam te amplectitur ulnis.
Stipatus Populi votis, age digna Triumpho;
Ut tandem agnoscant lati Confinia Mundi
Ingenio Monachi quod Regna redempta STUARTI.
FINIS.
THE TEARS And valediction of SCOTLAND
HOw various is my Government? will Fate
Never bring me back to a more constant state?
Am I the sport of Fortune? like a Ball
Bandyed about the Air, from wall to wall,
Not finding rest? must sable night still shroud
My serene looks? and muffle in a cloud
Our Solstice? shall my widowed Isle be tossed
In troubled Seas, like a Boat that has lost
Her guide? shall I no constant Pilot find?
Must my Bark ever sail against the wind?
My harp is torn, and all its strings untuned,
By diverse rude hands touched! a jarring sound
It yields the astonished world! Pity o (Dear)
Great Goddess England (whom all Nations fear)
Thy suffering Sister. Europe thee obeys,
On thee the weight of our Colossus lies.
My lyre, which heretofore but discord sent
(When senseless Clownes handled the Instrument)
Now cheeres our Hindes with most melodious Lays,
Whilst Monck with skillful fingers on it plays;
My coasts were ravished with his Harmony;
Heaven sent at last this Captain down to me:
From Great Orions fall, Arion springs,
Whose Key has sweetly ordered all my strings:
The croacking Frogs which late disturbed my rest.
And Grasshoppers that all my Fields possesst
(Since Princely Atlas was from me exiled)
with Swan-like music he has reconciled,
This my first Swan, my first Arion made
Sweet melody, when on the Harp he played,
Wherewith my troubled bowels were allaid.
Straight Monck by Providence divine led on,
Whom Wit and Valor jointly wait upon,
Climbes over Orions tomb: His next ascent
Was like to Orpheus in my Government;
For having once repaired my Harp defaced,
And its disordered strings in order placed,
Trees, Floods, and Beasts do from their stations part
And stony breasts were moved by his Art.
The shady gate of Pluto his power fears,
Groaning Megera shakes her snakie hairs,
Then on her sister looks: Cerberus grown pale,
Under his swelling belly hides his tail,
Whose howling cries afright the Stigian shades,
The fearful noise Cocytus den invades,
And Sisyphus his rolling stone holds still.
Nor did this Orpheus (whose great deeds my Quill
Attempts in lively colors to express
By indirect designs, but good success,
Perform those noble Acts he had begun,
For having seen how far his Clew would run,
He ascends higher yet, and strives to lead
Us in the paths our former Princes tread.
Go on brave Atlas, the worlds glorious Eye;
May your fame live to all posterity;
Let me just Tribute to your Virtues bring,
Though you affect not praises, let me sing
In a soft note your merits, too sublime
For my decrepid Muse as yet to climb,
Or reach up to, with a low creeping Rhyme:
Give leave (if it be no crime to ask such things)
At your warm beams to prune her flagging wings,
And view those circling Globes of heavenly light
That crown your worth, and dazzle our weak sight:
Let me (my Lord) behind you stand, and tell
The World, 'twas you alone that vanquished Hell,
And saved us all from ruin, like the bright
Sun, you dispelled those clouds that threatened night:
Your Music better feasted my desire
Then could Apollos, had he brought his quire,
And with his ivory fingers touched the lyre.
But I will not to the world speak your worth,
Or with adulterate fucus paint you forth;
Virtue is her own Herald, showing best
When she is stripped of Poetry, and undrest
Shines in her naked Glory: High minds raise
Themselves to greatness, and deserve the Bays:
In such an Orb of merits you do move,
Your Virtues, Wit, and Genius, soar above
A mortal flight, could ancient times have seen
Your famous Acts, in triumph you had been
Brought by the Tribunes into Rome, before
Great Caesar, and created Emperor:
Or had the Phrygians in old Nestors days
Known you, they had been silent in his praise.
Nor do I Scotland here yet go about
Your worthy Acts to extol, or measure out,
But having tasted of that worth which still
Flows from you, seeks therewith my self to fill.
O whither am I carried in vain?
Why do such weights disturb my laboring brain,
Fuller of matter, then of words? Had I
A hundred tongues, and all the Poetry
The Muses could inspire me with; a sea
Of Eloquence could Phoebus shower on me;
More learning then He owns; or had I all
The knowledge that the Powers celestial
Enjoy, I were not able to set forth
In Rhyme, or Prose, Moncks noble Acts, and worth.
But oh! whilst I run headlong, and rehearse
His glorious Deeds in an Heroic verse,
Fate (envious of my happiness) turns round
The wheel of Fortune! and a doleful sound
Falls from my Harp, thus the blind Goddess plays
With mortals, like the unconstant wind she stays
In no place fixed, but various shapes puts on:
Now clothed in night, straight brighter then the Sun,
Making a May Game of all humane things,
Whom she this day advances high, she flings
To morrow down: Who thinks he holds her fast,
And is her Darling, straight on Earth is cast.
Thus (jealous of success) She HIM removes
From hence, and with HIM has withdrawn our loves
Scotland, that once did Romes great Empire bound,
In such a Patron is thrice happy found,
Whose well-rul'd Kingdom in just order cast
One hundred seven Kings twice ten ages past,
With happy hand did guide, to whom alone
This Glory's due, they were subdued by none.
But oh! what change about our Clime is hurled,
Are the two Poles transverst? or will the World
In sunder cleave! has Charles's northern Wain
Left its old road, and dropped into the Main?
Will not the Wagoner his Teem protect?
Must Helyce its night watch sti^^eglect?
Shall my Harp yet by plundering Vultures be
Made silent, shall my Coast no good days see;
O fatal Omen! Comets such portend!
No wonder? How can Heaven but downward bend
When Atlas leaves it? or Earth stand when great
Olympus from the Fabrique does retreat.
Ye Gods! is this Light only lent my Sky,
Hence to be ta^ne away so suddenly?
Will Fortune ever with my sorrows play;
Has she no end of changing? will she stay
In no place fixed? are not my Ruptures great
Enough, but she must make them greater yet?
Is It not enough to rob me of my Prince
(Perhaps too good for me) but ever since
To spoil and use me thus? have I not had
My share of sorrows? but the Fates must add
A heavier loss by taking Orpheus hence?
Am I alive! or dead? what is my offense?
How come the Gods so angry? what is the cause
The Destinys thus change their ancient laws?
You Powers above! why do you wound me so?
In this you too much cruelty do show.
Must we for Ciphers, or for shadows stand?
Degenerate Souls, with what unequal hand
Do Fates their crosses daily multiply?
Was I but only lifted up on high
To make my fall the greater? did ye give
Me hope of late, and suffer me to live
To see my self fall headlong as before?
Arise you Furies! I your aid implore,
Apollo sease my verse! and give me leave
T'obtain my Lord, or losing Him to grieve;
I am stark mad! why should I it deny
Out of a zealous madness, Piety
Oft-times breaks forth: It Is lawful sure for me
Dear Sister England (Goddess of the Sea)
To fight with holy weapons, it is no sin
To reason with me, let us then begin
To plead my cause before Thee; and when tears
Are past, behold! how just my cause appears!
Wherefore (O Goddess) did Thou take away
My Lord, and would not let Him with Me stay?
What! did you only gifts on Me bestow,
Then snatch them back, to breed my future woe?
You much envy in this act did express:
Or did you emulate my Happiness?
Or rather want Monck's presence to protect
Your Nation? This indeed I did suspect;
Nor did the Augure fail: Alas I know
What the late Ravens croackings did foreshow
At His first coming hither! How the Night
Drew near, when we must look our wisht-for Light:
How all these Halcyon days, that gave success
To the glad Ploughmans labors, and did bless
Our Land with peace, must soon pass over, that we
Might afterward more miserable be
O fatal Prophecy, now found true by me.
Give leave (Great Sir) with you to expostulate
On bended knees, the cause of my bad fate;
Pray, tell me who has that ill office done,
To break our Loves off, so soon as begun?
Am I indeed undone? or is my brain
Disturbed with windy vapors? or do vain
Conceits, with frightfull dreams, delude my mind?
O hopeless Hope! What are you so unkind?
(Illustrious Soul) to leave me thus? O how
Did your beams please Me! and your serene brow,
Shining like Phoebus, cheer my drooping Clime?
What! are You gone so soon? have You no time
To stay, whilst I revive my dying Heart?
Are You but shown us, and must hence depart,
Guarded with English? Thus the Harvest nigh
(My Lord) to leave Us: O! how I envy
Your absence hence; Must others with you reap
The Autumn of Your labors? will you keep
Within the private Cabin of your breast
The Fruits of your great Merits? must I rest
Behind, and not glean after so much worth?
Or smell those precious Odors You cast forth?
What makes You stay thus long? did You go hence
To rob Me of Your Beams, or Influence?
Resolve Me quickly, and the spring disclose:
Is it because I Am poor, and do expose
To foreign Climes my People? or do look
Too mean for those high deeds You undertook?
Yet why should I distrust such things of One,
Under whose Government our Nation
Was truly blessed? Whose humble Mind was free
From all Ambition, and content with Me,
Had not the Gods endowed your mighty spirit
With gifts sublime, and made you apt to merit
Far greater Things. Your Goodness, Piety,
Faith; and Desorts has raised your Fame so high,
You must remove from us against our wills.
O Immense Mind which Virtue overfills,
And Wit advances to a pitch so high,
You seem above the fixed Stars to fly.
Had Heaven not all its favors on you thrown,
My Country had found Worthies of her own.
But O! the Powers have emptied their whole store
Upon your Highness, and have left me poor.
But why do I with staggering Rhymes complain?
Or ask help of the angry Gods in vain?
Shall I them, or the Fates accuse? or be
Such gifts and wisdom given to a Deity?
But he is profane, who ignorant of the Laws
Divine, exclaims against them without cause.
I Will blame my self, and at my own breast throw
These arrows, I on others would bestow.
Shall I that guilty am with Heaven contend,
Whose sins against God, over the whole Skies extend?
Your absence (noble Sir) my heart divides,
And is become a whip to scourge my sides;
I suffered not for naught, my faults deserved
This punishment; and I am justly served;
My sins were great, and caused you to remove
Your tents far from me; all the Powers above
Enraged against me, did at length design,
To take away your Lordship from my Clime.
Yet did you not without a glorious train
Return hence to your Country back again;
And I must follow You; yea court You so
As jealous Rivals do their Mistress woo,
Not envying Your Titles, but shall rather
Augment them, and a thousand Trophies gather,
Then place them at Your feet: You are perplexed
With various pressures; How is Your soul vexed
with tears, and prayers, and praises of the rude
Crowd (that about you throngs) the Multitude?
Who with applauses mix complaints, and know
No Government, nor can obedience show.
These Garlands weave of Ivy, and of Bays,
And whatsoever Flowers the Spring displayes
In various colors, to set out their State,
Who shall on Your triumphant Chariot wait.
Where e're You move, whether by Land or Sea,
Your Merit still shall draw Me after Thee.
I Will wait on You, my Patron; and if taken
A way, my Prayers shall bring You back again;
I Will hide You in my breast: Though You remove
From hence, no accident shall change my love.
Should Heaven, or great Olympus, headlong be
Cast in the Main, and all become one Sea;
Or Fortune frown; a thousand dangers set
Before me; Yet I never shall forget
Your presence. Though my lyre has lost its sound,
And with disordered strings lays on the ground,
Yet shall it strive to celebrate your name,
And unto future Ages speak your fame.
Go on! (Great Sir) whilst with a thousand Prayers
And sad complaints, I follow you in tears.
I Am troubled yet not mute; my misery*
Makes all the Powers Celestial* (...) with me.
Ye Gods (...)I for ever (...) farewell
Unto my Lord, and to the Ocean fell*
My grief? Ala^* how shall I say Adieu?
My How such a sad lesson never knew*
Yet in your absence it can do no less*
Then wish your Highness health and happiness!
And bids you twice Farewell; but cannot speak
Adieu, unless each string in pieces break:
O with what Zeal unspeakable am I
Transported? my toss'd-mind cannot descry
What path to take! so passionate is love,
It wounds my Soul to think of your remove,
And makes me all concerns besides forget.
How gladly wauld I say (Return)! but yet
I fear great business keep you back! Then why
Beg I in vain what all the Gods deny?
Then O! Farewell! Farewell my only Dear!
It Is fit the Love I owe should now appear,
So long since due.
But why do I thus stay,
When I hear Trumpets calling Him away?
And the Drun beat a sudden March for all
The Army, to attend their General.
Then quickly have, with all your noble train
Of Peers, and Lords, and Gentry, that remain
In Court or Country; all that wear the Gown,
And those religious Priests, whose learning crown
Fair Edinburgh; the Officers lead on
The Van, whilst Fierce Bellona calls upon
The Rear to follow; each observes his place,
Then shouts for joy, to see their Generals face:
The common People (made of noise) make haste
To gape upon Him ere the show be past.
All stood amazed that day: A world of Men
Became Spectators -- But grief stops my pen
To think what loss my coasts did then sustain!
Hark! the great Guns in horrid tones complain
Of His departure! and Earths fabric shakes;
The astonished Echo at the noise awakes,
And from her hollow cave does back return
An answer to it: The Skies do seem to burn.
Hot coals of Sulphur round the Plains are shook:
And as the Guns go off, the Soldiers look
As if they dwelt in flames; or did desire
To give a Farewell to their Lord in fire.
At length Dalkeith from her fair palace shows,
The object of the Peoples Joys and Woes;
Our Nations Prince, and Father, as he moves
Along, the Multitude express their Loves
In grief and triumph; Complaints mixed with praise,
Sighs with Applauses: and where e're He stays,
By all the flames of Love and Zeal; by all
That Is smooth or craggy; by things mystical;
Yea, by Himself, they beg Him to return,
Whose bowels inwardly for them do burn.
Yet on He goes, but fain would stay behind,
Millions of cares still rolling in his Mind:
Thus with a noble Train, but a sad heart,
This noble Phaenix did from Scotland part.
But stay my Harp! -- often from dark clouds comes light,
And day at length breaks up from blackest night;
Sadness (like smoke) does from the Just retire,
The Bow laid by, Apollo takes his lyre;
Whilst on thy shore this Phaenix stands, prepare
His Farewell; but from all complaints forbear,
And cheerfully thy Fathers last words hear.
Afflicted Nation! subject to the wheels
Of Fate, who under such cross fortune reels!
How art thou compast with a swelling Sea,
Which strives in its great flood to swallow thee?
Scarce half an Isle (when I thy losses view)
But yet an Isle! and Englands sister too;
Who troubled thee of late. Thy griefs assuage
And do not thus in vain against Heaven rage;
God has decreed, and does confirm't, I shall
Return from hence! (witness these tears that fall
Down from mine Eyes!) See where my Tents do stand!
Behold! I am compelled to leave your Land!
He dwells above, who Scepters swayes, and all
The world must be obedient to his call.
Look how I am prepared! but yet too slow
A servant, knowing God does bid me go.
'Twas He first sent Me to You, who the Reins
Of these three Kingdoms in his hand contains.
Although I Am called another way, yet I
Am not concerned, if this great weight cast by
I must bear greater. Those whom God employes
Their strength does still their burdens equalize.
And how I did through all disasters wade,
When Scotlands troubles on my shoulders laid,
I call you all to witness who here meet:
Farewell self-praise whilst I these things repeat;
My Harp does only what is divine impart,
Making melodious Music by my Art.
But I percieve some strings are false! Alas
There lurks a snake still under the green grass?
Within the womb a croacking Frog is nursed,
Which must be forced out. And Schism accursed
Fills the disordered strings with jarring sounds,
This is the Lerna that our Hynds confounds!
In which the Hundred-headed Hydra dwells,
(A Monster late revived) whom no Dart kills,
Till our Herculean Semi-God at least
With fire and sword consume this hellish Beast,
Root out this Plague; it was my whole intent
To have destroyed it, e're from you I went.
But Heaven forbids it now, and my Great PRINCE
(Whose Orders I obey) commands Me hence.
Till then I shall not your Afflictions slight,
Or ever to your Interest hid goodnight:
I sing glad News! -- O! greive not that I part*
Unhop'd for Joys appear! -- lift up thy Heart,
The times are changing,! Though I absent be,
A New Sun (brighter then my self) you will see.
Heaven labors for your welfare; whilst I Am gone
Night flees; The Moon her robes of light puts on,
And (hastening to her Chariot) descries
Long-wish'd for Phoebus suddenly will rise,
Whose rays shall Clouds disperse, and grief assuage
And back to Scotland bring the Golden Age.
Thus did He end his Speech so well composed,
Heavens smiled, and all the Multitude disclosed
Their calm resentments. Straight about the fields
Such a sost murmr flees, as Nilus yields
When his high swelling flood the banks overflow;
The drunken Earth (half dead before does show
Large crops of Corn, Flowers in each Pasture grow.
His neighboring Army (hearing what was spoke)
Discharge their Muskets, and in fire and smoke
Return back their assents; all things put on
A pleasing look; and sadness being gone,
Joy did assume her place.
Whilt thus my breast
With violent seas of sorrows was oppressed;
Monck (having shown his Love so many ways)
Leaves Scotland! and at last himself conveyes
Home to his Camp, (who at his stay complain)
But looking back, and seeing the large train
Of Scots that followed Him: He makes a stand,
And leaves his Steed, that each might kiss his hand.
Then all renew their grief; a trembling fear
Possesses every joint; their faces were
The badge of sorrow! their Affections make
Them jealous of each other: straight they break
Forth into praise. Each with his own mind wars;
Distrusts, hopes, joys, and some again dispairs;
Till they behold their Princely Sun arise,
Whose beams dry up the tears fall from their eyes.
So when for foreign Climes the Merchant's bound,
(Whilst Sayls are hoyst, and Anchors weighed from ground)
His loving Wife (with eyes fixed on the deck)
Labors to twine her Arms about his Neck,
And fain would kiss him, but the unkind Main
Denies that favor; (left alone) in vain
She against her Husband and the Gods exclaims;
Curses the Ship, the Seas, the Winds; then blames
Her passion; wishing him a prosperous gale,
And prays no storms his Vessel may assall:
But when the fleeing sayls far off she views,
She weeps afresh, and late complaints renews;
Yet still she stands, and with intentive eyes
Pursues the Ship; and twice Adieu she cries:
At last constrained, back to her House returns,
And for her absent Spouse a short while mourns:
But when the Fathers Image she espies
In her fair Child, all sorrow from her flies.
That at her Lords departure Scotland greived,
Till hope of seeing CHARLES her heart releived.
Then Monck to London from the Scottish Coast
Removes, attended by a gallant Host:
The City (proud of such a Guest) prepares
To bid Him welcome, and no charges spares;
But all Him for a Deity adore,
Sent to their help. So on the Indian shore
The Phaenix having her bright wings displayed.
And her embroidered Tail in order laid
(Whose golden Plumes add luster to Heavens fire)
Ascends the Sky attended by a Quire
Of lesser Birds, who round about her sings,
Whilst she the upper Region boldly wings.
Thus Englands Nobles, and a warlike Train,
Pressed by a crowd of people, entertain
With great applause their valiant General,
Who bravely mounted in the midst of all
His armed Troops, like the bright Sun appears,
Whose glorious presence the whole Nation cheers.
Long may you live (Great Sir) to reconcile
The jarring World, and prop up Britains Isle:
Go on, Fame hugs you in her breast, do things
Worthy of Trophies for the best of KINGS,
That all the Confines of the World may see,
Monck regained CHARLES his Crown by policy.
THE END.
