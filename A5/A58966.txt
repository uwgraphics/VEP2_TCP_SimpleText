A SECOND CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE POPE and the TURK, Concerning the
Propagation of the Catbolick Faith.
POPE. HAil mighty Monarch! by whose aid
I hope I shall subdue,
And for the future make afraid
The whole Heretical Crew;
You will both wise and grateful prove
While you with me combine,
Who always have showed you my love,
And now your good design.

TVRK. What mean these ambiguities
With which to me you come?
Is the Oracle of doubtful lies
From Delphos gone to Rome?
Your kindness I never uaderstood,
Whatever you pretend:
To him to whom you never did good,
How can you be a friend?

POPE. Ungrateful man! do you forget
^
(...) yet
Your scepter does obey*
I did the Greeks to Florence call,
And kept them there with me:
And you were Master made of all,
Before we could agree.

TVRK. This manifests your wickedness
And makes your Cause yet worse;
I see no reason you to Bless,
Though Greece has cause to Curse:
You prove your Treachery indeed,
But not your love to me,
You Would never have helped me in my need,
If they would submitted to you.

POPE. I think I stood your Friend (good Sir)
When James did aspire:
I both did keep him Prisoner,
And poisoned him for hire;
Then against France 'twas I did send
For your victorious Arms,
With promise that I would desend
Your Kingdoms from all harms.

TVRK. Two hundred thousand Florens, when
You did my Brother's work,
You had: The Benefactor then
Was not the Pope but Turk;
It Is true me once you did invite
Your interest to advance;
Not cause you loved me, but for spite
Against the King of France.

POPE. Though still Ingratitude you pay
For kindnesses good store,
If you will be ruled, I Will on you lay
One obligation more:
I Will raise your Empire yet so high,
That you shall straitway yield
That I pull down, and only I
Do Monarchies rebuild.

TVRK. For all your talk, I still do fear
That while you make a pother,
And with one hand pretend to rear,
You pull down, with the other:
But what is it now that I must do,
^
^
Are really my Friend?

POPE. Why first I Will give you all those lands
That against me do rebel,
Go take them strait into your hands,
I Have cursed their Kings to Hell;
I freely to the King of Spain
The British Islands gave:
He wanted strength those Isles to gain,
Which I am sure you have.

TVRK. You're generous Sir, and at one word
Great Territories grant,
Which if men gain not by the Sword,
They must for ever want:
So while you Saintship give to some,
And frankly Heaven bestow,
I doubt (wh^^^re's decreed at Rome)
Their portion is below.

POPE. Whether Heaven and Hell, are in my gift
I do not greatly care,
(Let learned men those Question sift)
sure earthly Kingdoms are;
I can from ancient deeds declare
What power belongs to me:
The greatest Kings are what they are
By my Authority.

TVRK. I Have often heard what Tricks you use
To help you in your needs,
Sometimes you do the World abuse
With forged Books and Deeds:
Sometimes you Kingdoms give away
(As now you do to me)
Hoping that thus obliged, they
Your Vassals still will be.

POPE. If I your Benefactor be,
I hope ydu will not think much,
(When I Have raised you to high degree)
To honor me as such:
If Universal Monarchy
You do receive from me,
The Universal Pastor I
May be allowed to be.

TVRK. I understand your kindness now,
^
If unto you I Will cringe and bow,
And after your Pipe dance;
Then you will unto me be so kind,
That you will crack your brain,
Some place in the Alcoran to find,
That shall your Pride maintain.

This honor more you will on me heap,
Whenever, I you meet,
That on my knees I strait must creep,
To kiss your Worships feet.
When ere your Pride I do oppose,
You Will curse me strait to Hell;
My Subjects too shall never want those
Shall stir them to Rebel.

You still unto me plagues will send
As you have done to others,
From Priests I must my self defend,
Worse than aspiring Brothers:
Where you fet foot no Prince is free,
But strait must be your slave,
Good Sir, pray cease treat with me;
I other business have.

FINIS.
