by Records and the best Historians, that the Commons of England were ever an
Essential part of Parliament.

LONDON, Printed for F. Smith, T. Bassett, J. Wright, R. Chiswell, and S.
Heyrick, 1680.

To the Right Honorable Arthur Earl of ESSEX, Viscount MALDON, Baron Capell of
HADHAM, Lord Lieutenant of the County of HERTFORD, one of his Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Council, and First Lord Commissioner of his Majesty's Treasury.
MY LORD,
THere have been Authors of modern times, who have in their Writings,
concerning the Government of this Kingdom, published to the World, That the
Commons of England (as now phrased) were no part of the ancient Commune
Concilium, or Parliament of this Nation, before the forty ninth Year of H. 3.
and then introduced by Rebellion.

A Position when seriously weighed, equally wounds the Peerage of England,
since the same Authors say, that there is no formal Summons of the Lords to
Parliament, found upon Record before that time.

After I had often considered so great a point, and having often read of the
freedom of this Nation, that no Englishman could lose his right or property but
by Law, the Life and Soul of this so famous and so excellently constituted
Government, the best polity upon Earth (which when united in all its parts by
prudent Councils, made always the people happy at home in Peace, and the Crown
ever Victorious abroad in War) I did resolve to take pains to search, if
matters thus represented to the highest disadvantage and prejudice of the
people of England, were true or false; which I have industriously and
impartially endeavored, and hope with that clearness, that will evidence to
all unbiassed judgments, the unsoundness of those Opinions.

When I had so done, being unwilling my labor should be to my self alone, and
not to those who search after knowledge in these matters, to disabuse and
prevent others from building upon such mistaken and dangerous Foundations, I
thought it not unseasonable to publish this Discourse, wherein there is no
Record cited, but (in my opinion) equally asserts the right of the Peers of
this Kingdom, as well as of the Commons, and therefore have taken the boldness
to send it into the World under your Lordships Protection, whom I know to be a
great Lover of Truth, To which all mankind ought to pay Allegiance. I should
have had great satisfaction, if before it had been put to the Press, it might
have received your Lordships judicious corrections and approbation, whose
knowledge and industry in venerable Antiquity, and all other useful Learning,
is well known unto the World.

But this happiness I could not reasonably expect, your Lordships time being so
much taken up in the service of the Crown, whereof your Lordship is so eminent,
and so great a Pillar, as your Honorable Employments both at home and abroad,
do sufficiently demonstrate. I most humbly beg your Lordships Pardon for my
presumption in this Dedication, which fault I hope may be extenuated by the
relation I have to your Lordship in my Profession, and being deprived of other
means, publicly to show my humble gratitude for the many favors your Lordship
has been pleased to confer upon,

My Lord, Your Lordships most humble, most faithful, and most obedient Servant,
W. Petyt.

THE PREFACE.
MY principal design in this following Discourse, is impartially to vindicate
the just honor of our English Parliament from the calumnies and reproaches of
some late Authors who have asserted,

1. That an essential part of that Great Council, viz. the Commons of England,
represented by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses in Parliament, were
introduced and began An. 49 H. 3. by Rebellion.

2. That before that time the Commons were never admitted to have any Votes, or
share in the making of Laws for the Government of the Kingdom, nor to any
Communication in affairs of State.

To discover and refute the unsoundness of the second Position, and that the
contrary may appear to be true, I shall before I come to answer the first,
consider the second, and endeavor to prove, that during the British, Saxon,
and Norman Governments, the Freemen or Commons of England, as now called and
distinguished from the great Lords, were pars essentialis and constituens, an
essential and constituent part of the Wittena Gemot, Commune Concilium,
Baronagium Angliae, or Parliament, in those Ages.

1. Under the British Government.
THE Brittons called their Commune Concilium, or Parliament, Kyfr-ythen Spelm.
Council. Tom. 1. p. 34.
then, because their Laws were therein ordained; and upon K. Lucius his Letter
to Pope Elutherius, to send him the Roman Laws, the Pope who could not be
ignorant of the constitution and frame of the British Polity, writes back to
him, Habetis penes vos in Regno Erac Beltaunia viginti and octo Civitatibus
quondam nobili^^imis insignita praeter Casteila innumera quae (...) ipsa muris,
turribus, portis ac seris eraut instructa ^^rm^^simis. (...) Er^l. H^^t. (...).
(...) C^^ (...).
utramque paginam, ex illis Dei gratia per Concilium Regni vestri sum legem,
and per illam Dei potentia vestrum rege Britanniae Regnum But what their Laws
and particular Government were, is very uncertain, by reason that Scripta
Patriae (as Gildas says) Scriptorumve Monumenta (si quae fuerint) aut ignibus
hostium exusta aut Civium exulum class longius deportata non comparent. The
Histories of our Country (if there were any) are not to be found, being either
burnt by the Enemy, or carried beyond the Seas by the banished Brittons. Yet
this is certain, and not to be denied, that (...) their elder time, the People
or Freemen, had a great share in their public Council and Government. For Dion
Cassius, Xiphilin. e Dione Cassio p. 601. impress. Basiliae.
or Xipniline out of him in the Life of Severus assures us, Apud hos i. e.
Britannos populus magna ex part principatum tenet.

2. Under the Saxon Government.
IT cannot be doubted but that the Saxons who made themselves Masters of the
British Nation, brought with them their Country Laws, and Government; and that
the Commons were an essential and constituent part of their Commune Concilium,
Tacitus tells us, De minoribus rebus Principes consultant, de majoribus omnes,
ita tamen ut ea quoque quorum penes plebem arbitrium est, apud Principes
praetractentur.

After the Saxon Government became united and fixed under a sole Christian
Monarch, they still continued and kept their ancient Wittena Gemots, or
Parliaments, as now phrased, wherein they made Laws and managed the great
affairs of the King and Kingdom, according to the Platform of their Ancestors.
Many Authorities might be given to evidence this, I will instance in three or
four.

populorum totius Regni.

that the grand League and Union between the Brittons, Saxons, and Picts, was
concluded and confirmed, Per Commune Concilium and assensum omnium Episcoporum,

praeceptum Regis Inae.

expresses the Saxon Wittena Gemott thus, Generalis Senatus and Populi
Conventus and Edictum.

Sir Henry Spelman: Convenere (...)m. Gloss. (...). Gemotum, ^ol. 261.
Regni Principes tam Episcopi quam Magistratus liberique homines, consulitur de
communi salute, de pace and bello and de utilitate publica promovenda.

Camden thus: Quod Saxones Camd. Britan. in 8o. impress. 1586. fol. 63.
olim Wittena Gemot, nos Parliamentum, and Pananglicum recte dici possit,
summamque and sacrosanctam authoritatem habet in Legibus ferendis,
confirmandis, antiquandis, interpretandis and in omnibus quae ad Reipublicae
salutem spectant. And so we find Edward the Confessor reforming and confirming
the ancient Saxon Laws, and making new ones, and that done a Rege, Baronibus
and Lambard de priseis Anglor. Legibus Cap. 8. sol. 139.
Populo, as particularly in the Law de Apibus, how Tithes ought to be paid of
them, and other things.

Hence it is apparent and past all contradiction, that the Commons in those
Ages were an essential part of the Legislative power, in making and ordaining
Laws, by which themselves and their posterity were to be governed, and that

the Law was then the golden metwand and rule which measured out and allowed
the Prerogative of the Prince and Liberty of the Subject, (and when obstructed
or denied to either, made the Kingdom deformed and leprous.) That great Monarch
Aethelstan, in his Prologue to his Laws, made per Commune Concilium Regni, thus
declared and admitted; Ea mihi vos tantummodo (...) Con^ilia page 39. 397.

I have past over the Danish Government, because I do not find that there was
any great mutation, either of the Council or Laws of the English Nation. It is
true, King Knute obtained the Diadem or Dominion of England; but it is as true
he did not govern more Victoris, as may evidently be proved, 1. From I(...)er

consentiant vel faciant pullulare in omni Regno meo. Praecipio etiam omnibus
Vicecomitibus and Praepositis universis Regni mei sicut meam volunt habere
amicitiam aut suam salutem, ut nulli homini nec diviti vel pauperi vim injustam
inferant, sed omnibus tam Nobilibus quam ignobilibus sit fas justa lege
potiundi, a qua nec propter favorem Regium nec propter alicujus potentis
personam, nec propter mihi congerendam pecuniam ullo modo deviant; quia nulla
mihi necessitas est, ut iniqua exactione pecunia mihi congeratur. After which
the Historian says: Omnes ^g. 42. l. 21.

sub interminatione Regiae mulctae perpetuis temporibus observari praecepit, in
quarum custodia etiam nunc tempore bonorum sub nomine Regis Edwardi juratur,
non quod ille statuerit sed quod observaverit.

3. Under the Normans.
King William the First.
THough William the Conqueror got the Imperial Crown of England, and introduced
several Arbitrary Laws, as new tenures, etc. yet did he never make such an
absolute Conquest, nor did the Kingdom receive so universal a change, as our
English modern Authors (as it were by a general Consederacy, without
examination of truth) have published to the World, who father upon this
revolution all the alterations which their conceits or fancies can imagine and
suppose. Thucydides Lib. 1.
says, Men receive the report of things, though of their own Country, if done
before their time, all alike, from one as from another, without any
examination; In like manner have those our Historians been mistaken, by
transcribing and patching out their Histories one from another, so that in
conclusion, with their own additions or comments, truth in many things is
utterly lost.

1. The word Conquestor or Conqueror, did not in that Age import or signify
what our late Authors by flattery have since made it; nor did it carry with it
the enslaving of the Nation, after that William had obtained the Victory
against Harold, there being no more in the Denomination of Conqueror, than that
after William had made claim to the Crown from King Edward the Confessor, and
Harold opposed him, he was forced to get his right by Battle against King
Harold; and as to the word Conquestus or Conquest, Mat. Paris writes, Mat.
(...). page (...).
Rex Angliae ex Conquestu dicitur tamen, quod beatus Edwardus, eo quod haerede
caruit, Regnum legavit Willielmo Bastardo Duci Normannorum. Sir Henry Spelman
(...)
in his Glossary says, Willielmus primus Conquestor dicitur quia Angliam
conquisivit, i. e. acquisivit, purchased, non quod subegit. And Sir John Skene
Clerk of the Register Council, and Rolls to King James in Scotland, in his
Book, De verborum significatione, page 39. writes Conquestus signifies Lands
quhilk any person acquiris, and possessis privato jure, vel singulari titulo
vel donatione vel singulari aliquo contractu. And therefore the learned Knight,
Sir Roger Twi^den, who well understood the force of the word Conquestus, in his
Preface before that Kings Laws, says, Non existimo A(...) Lamberdum.
Willielmum primum de omnium Anglorum terris ad voluntatem suam and pro libitu
in modum absolutae dominationis disposuisse.

All which is most plain and justified infallibly by Doomesday Book, made in
that S(...) Review of his History of Tithes. Sir ^oh^ Da(...) Reports, in his
C(...) of (...) (...) 4^.
Kings Reign, and in other subsequent Records, where the title and claim of
many common persons to their own and Ancestors possessions, both in his time
and in the time of the Saxon Kings, are clearly allowed; but if King William
had made an absolute and universal Conquest of the Realm in the modern sense,
how could such Titles have held, or who would or durst have made such claim,
even against the King himself? would he not have seized all into his own hands,
and granted the Conquered Lands to others? and his grant could not have been
avoided by any Englishman who had the inheritance and possession, and lived in
peace before and at his coming in, and no title could be derived but from or
under him, at least none could have been maintained against his Grant. But that
the contrary was true, will evidently appear if we consider, 1. That it is
recorded in Doomesday Book, that King William had certain Lands in Demesne,
viz. the Lands which were in the hands of King Edward, and entitled Terrae
Edwardi Regis, and other Lands, which were forfeited to him by those who took
part with Harold, entitled Terrae Regis. 2. William the first having given away
Sharnborn Camd. Britan.
in Norfolk, to Warren a great Favorite, one of his Normans; Edwinus de
Sharnborn, being an Englishman, and true owner of the estate, demands his right
in open Court, before the King, upon this reason of Law, that he never was
against the King, either before or after he came in; whereupon the King,
vinculo juramenti astrictus, gave judgment of right against the Norman, and
Sharnborn recovered the Lordship. Sir Spelmans Glossary verbo Drenches, page
184.
Henry Spelman out of an ancient Manuscript concerning the Family of the
Sharnborns in Norfolk, has it thus. Edwinus de Sharborne and quidam alii qui
ejecti fuerunt e terris suis, abierunt ad Conquestorem and dixerunt ei quod
nunquam ante Conquestum, nec in Conquestu nec post fuerunt contra ipsum Regem
in consilio and auxilio, sed tenuerunt se in pace. Et hoc parati sunt probare
quo modo ipse Rex vellet ordinare. Per quod idem Rex fecit inquiri per totam
Angliam si ita fuit, quod quidem probatum fuit: propter quod idem Rex praecepit
ut omnes qui sic se tenuerunt in pace in forma praedicta, quod ipsi rehaberent
omnes terras and dominationes suas adeo integre and in pace ut unquam habuerunt
vel tenuerunt ante Conquestum suum. This is cited almost as the only case or
act of favor the Conqueror did; but that is a great mistake, for many other
instances I could give of this nature, all acts of Justice and right, as
appears in Doomesday Book; much more may be said upon this subject. I will only
add the Judicious assertion of a great Lawyer and Judge in Edward the Thirds
time, admitted and agreed as a rule of Law and truth, by the Judges, and
transmitted to posterity. Le Conqueror (says he) ne Sha^d. in Ca^. in ^tin.

que de lour tort avoient occupy ascun terre en desheritance del Roy and son
Corone. It was spoken upon an objection made in a Quo Warranto against the
Abbot of Peterborough, concerning a Charter granted by King Edgar to that
Abbey, which the Kings Council would have avoided upon this pretense for want
of a better, because by the Conquest all Franchises were devolved and come to
the Crown.

2. King William claimed the English Diadem, Jure haereditario, from Edward the
In ore gladii (says he) Regnum adeptus sum, Anglorum devicto Haraldo Rege cum
suis complicibus qui mihi regnum cum providentia Dei destinatum and beneficio
concessionis Domini and cognati mei gloriosi Regis Edwardi concesa^^ conati

Confessor, which both his own Laws, Charters, and the Charters of his two Sons
William and Henry, do fully prove: There are some indeed that mention that he
obtained the Crown, ore gladii, but that must be understood quod jure belli
contra Harolaum ipse acquisivit, as a Manuscript Historian says. MS. penes
meipsum.


3. He did not make an actual Conquest by his Arms (when he came in) of the
fifth part of the Nation, for the Pope having sent him a consecrated Banner,
and a Bull of Excommunication against the Bishops and Clergy, if they opposed
him in adhering to King Harold, and he having got the Victory at Hastings, and
the Clergy with several of the Nobility (whom he had purchased to his part,
both by money and great assurances of preferment and other advantages) basely
and treacherously deserting Edgar Etheling, a soft and weak Prince, yet right
Heir to the Crown; at length upon Williams declaring that he would confirm the
Laws of Saint Edward, he was electus a Clero and Populo, and with all the
Ceremonies and Solemnities then in use, was Crowned at Westminster, the whole
Nation submitting to him. But hear what the Historians of those times say.

per Commune Concilium t^tius Regni nostri pr^di^^i.

From all which it must necessarily be granted, 1. That this Statute or Law,
was made per Commune Concilium totius Regni. 2. The Magna Charta of W. 1. H. 1.
King Stephen, H. 2. and King John (the last of which says, Nullum scutag^um

Kingdom, and no Law introduced de novo, or forced upon King John at
Runningmead, to the disinberison of the Crown, and which by their several
sacred Coronation Oaths they had so solemnly sworn inviolably to observe and
keep.

It Is true indeed King William the First gave away the Estates of several of
those who were in Arms against him, to his Adventurers and followers, but the
rest of the English (as well by his Coronation Oath, as by a solemn
ratification of St. Edwards Laws in a Parliament in his S^^^^ns Titles of
Honor, page 580.

that being not done in the general, and the English (who declared a ^em page 523.

Normans, begun to be very uneasy under his Government, so that things were

who meeting at Berkhamsted, post multos disceptationes, both parties came to a

pallians, persuaded many of the principal of the Nobility and Gentry to attend
him into Normandy, where Civitatem Hoviden pars prior page 260.

natalium qui ipsum sponte sublimaverunt, provocationem, locupletavit. So that
after this time, it is plain, he bore a heavy hand upon the English, and
increased his severity to acts of high injustice and barbarous cruelty, and so
gave occasion to Historians in future Ages, to say, that when he came in, he
totally subdued and crushed the Nation, Nobility, and Gentry. Yet
notwithstanding the great power he took, we meet with some general Councils or
Parliaments in his Reign, whereby it appears, that the Freemen or Commons of
England, were there, and had a share in making of Laws; for what could the
promised restitution of the Laws of Edward the Confessor signify, if their
Wittena Gemot, or Parliament, the Augustissimum Anglicarum libertatum Asylum
and sacra Anchora, was destroyed and broken?

For one of the fundamental and principal ends of Parliaments, was for the
redress of Grievances, and easing the Oppressions of the People. The Mirror of
Justices, an ancient Mirror of justices, Chap. 1. page 9.
and learned Treatise of the Law, says, that Parliaments were instituted, pur
oyer and terminer les plaintes de tort de le Roy, de la Roigne and de lour
Infans, and de eux specialment de queux Torts lun ne poet aver autrement common
droit, To hear and determine the Complaints of the wrongful Acts of the King,
the Queen, and their Children, and especially of those persons against whom the
subject otherwise could not have common justice.

And Knighton (one of De Eventibus Anglia Lib. 5. sol. 2681. Col. 1, 2.
our best Historians) writes, Quod ex antiquo Statuto and Consuetudine
laudabili and approbata, etc. That by an ancient Statute and Custom, laudable
and approved, which no man could deny; the King was once in the year to convene
his Lords and Commons to his Court of Parliament, as to the highest Court of
the whole Realm. In qua omnis Aequitas relucere deberet absque qualibet
scrupulositate vel nota, tanquam sol in ascensu meridiei, ubi pauperes and
divites pro Refrigerio tranquilliratis and pacis and Repulsione injuriarum
refugium infallibile quaerere possent, ac etiam errata Regni reformare and de
statu and gubernatione Regis and Regni cum sapientiori Concilio tractare; ut
Inimici Regis and Regni intrinseci and Hosts extrinseci destruantur and
repellantur, qualiter quoque onera incumbentia Regi and Regno levius ad Ediam
Communitatis supportari poterunt. In which Court all Equity ought to shine
forth without the least Cloud or Shadow, like the Sun in its meridian glory;
where poor and rich refreshed with peace and ease of their oppressions, may
always find infallible and sure refuge and succor, the grievances of the
Kingdom redrest, and the state of the King and Government of the Realm debated
with wiser Councils, the Domestic and Foreign Enemies of the King and Kingdom
destroyed and repelled, and to consider how the Charges and Burdens of both
may be sustained with more ease to the people. But to return.

being dead, William his second Son, then living, succeeded him in the Kingdom;
who designing to prevent his elder Brother Robert of the Crown, finding
Lanfranc Archbishop of Canterbury not altogether consenting with him therein,
to the completing his desire, and fearing lest the delay of his Consecration
might prejudice his desired honor, he begun by giving large gifts and rewards
to the people, and as well by himself as all others whom he could engage, fide
sacramentoque Lanfranco promittere, by his Faith and Oath to promise unto
Lanfranc, Si Rex foret, Justitiam, aequitatem and misericordiam se per totum
Regnum in omni negotio servaturum, he would in all actions observe and keep
Justice, Equity, and Mercy, through the whole Kingdom; that he would defend the
Peace, Liberty, and safety of the Church, against all men, and also, that he
would in and through all things obey the Precepts and Counsels of the
Arch-Prelate; thereupon, in Regem (...)
eligitur and consecratur.

But not long after Odo Hoveden pars prior page 264.
Bishop of Baiox, Earl of Kent, Geffrey Bishop of Constance, Robert Earl of
Morton, Roger Earl of Shrewsbury, and the greatest part of all the Norman
Prelates and Nobility in England, entered into a Conspiracy to make Robert King,
and to deliver King William to his Brother alive or dead; and thereupon they
took Arms: the King hearing these things, and foreseeing his inevitable ruin
if the English power did not preserve him, caused the English to be assembled
together, and showed them the Treason of the Normans, and entreats and begs
them to help and defend him, upon this condition, that if they would be
faithful to him in that his necessity and distress, he would grant them better
Laws which they should choose, and would forbid or interdict all unjust Scotts,
Taxes, or Tallages, and grant to all persons their Woods and Hunting. Upon
which assurance and promise the English did faithfully assist him, and by their
power valiantly overthrew the Normans, and preserved and fixed the Crown upon
Williams head. But whatsoever he promised he kept but a short time, the words
of the Author are. His auditis Rex fecit Lin. 40. b.

It Is therefore evident from hence, that William the Second did not claim the
Crown jure gladii, by the power of the Sword, nor did he affirm, that he had a
despotical right to make or change Laws, ad libitum suum sine assensu Regni or
Parliament. And it is a great observation to me, that from the pretended
Conquest to this day, I never read of any King of England that declared and
publicly owned any such prerogative or right, but only that miserable and
unfortunate Prince Richard the Second, which the Parliament Roll thus
expresses. Item, Idem Rex nolens justas leges Rot. Parl. 1 (...). 4. Art. 1^.

justitiam exhiberet, dixit express vultu austero and protervo quod leges suae
erant in ore suo and aliquotiens in pectore suo, and quod ipse solus possit
mutare and condere leges regni sui; and opinione illa seductus quampluribus de

But far different were the sentiments and Judgment of his Grandfather Great
Edward the third, who tells us: Because, that by diverse Complaints Pultons
Stat. 20 E. 3. sol. 137.
made to us, we have perceived that the Law of the Land, which we by our Oath
are bound to maintain, is the less well kept, and the Execution of the same
disturbed many times by maintenance and procurement, as well in the Court as in
the Country; We greatly moved of Conscience in this matter, and for this cause
desiring as much for the pleasure of God, and ease and quietness of our
Subjects, as to our Conscience, and for to save and keep our said Oath, We have
ordained, etc.

And wise King James King James's first Speech to his first Parlialiament in
England. Pulton Stat. 1 Jacobi, cap. 2. sol. 1157.
says, That not only the Royal Prerogative, but the Peoples security of Lands,
Livings, and Privileges, were preserved and maintained by the ancient
fundamental Laws, Privileges, and Customs of this Realm, and that by the
abolishing or altering of them, it was impossible but that present confusion
will fall upon the whole state and frame of this Kingdom.

And his late Majesty of King Charies the First's Declaration to all his loving
Subjects, published with the advice of his Privy Council. Exact Collectious of
Declara^ons, page 28, 29.
ever blessed memory, was of the same mind and opinion, when he said, The Law
is the Inheritance of every Subject, and the only security he can have for his
Life, or Estate, and the which being neglected or dis-esteemed (under what
specious show soever) a great measure of infelicity, if not an irreparable
confusion, must without doubt fall upon them.

William, the Magnates Angliae, not knowing what was become of Robert Duke of
Normandy, Eldest Brother of the deceased King (the said Duke having been absent
for five years in a Voyage to the Holy Land) were afraid to be long without a
King, which Henricus fratrum ultimus and juvenis sapientissimus cum callide
cognovisset, congregato Londoniis Clero Angliae and Populo universo promisit
emendationem legum quibus oppressa fuit Anglia tempore patris sui and fratris
nuper defuncti, ut animos omnium in sui promotionem accenderet and amorem, ut
illum in Regem susciperent and patronum; to which it was generally answered,
That if he with a willing mind would grant, and by his Charter confirm to them,
illas libertates and consuetudines antiquas, which their Ancestors enjoyed in
the time of Edward the Confessor, in ipsum consentirent and in Regem unanimiter
consecrarent.

Henry willingly granted this, and taking an Oath, that he would perform it,
consecratus est in Regem, at Westminster. upon Lady day, favente Clero and populo,
and so forthwith he was Crowned by Maurice Bishop of London and Thomas
Archbishop of York. After such his Coronation, he granted and confirmed to the
Nation, for the advancement of Holy Church, and preservation of the peace of
his people, a Charter of their ancient Liberties.

The Charter the Reader may find in that industrious Revivor, and Restorer of

of the King, those Laws were made, de Communi Consilio and assensu Baronum
Regni Angliae, by the common advice and assent of the Barons of England. It
being usual in succeeding ages, at the Coronations of our English Kings, to
confirm, make, and ordain Laws, De assensu Baronum Regni, per Commune Concilium
Regni, or Parliament.

I shall from hence observe two things.

1. That these Laws were granted and confirmed, assensu Baronum Regni, or
Baronagii Angliae, there being a clear difference between Barons Regis, and
Barons Regni, as appears in the very bowels of LL. G(...)ni primi L^^^. sol.

those Laws and elsewhere; for the K. Says, Si quis Baronum nostrorum, etc.
but who were comprehended under those first phrases, Mr. Camden will Camd.

have I at length, I hope, fully ascertained and explained the Historians
phrase, Clerus and Populus, and proved it to be a Parliament from the Pat. Roll
of H. 3.

Yet I do not think that the Lords Temporal only were the Populus, nor the
Lords Spiritual the Clerus; for I agree with Dr. Heylyn, that D^ H^ylins
stumbling Block, page 189.
there is no Record, either of History or Law (which I have observed) in which
the word Clerus serves to signify the Archbishops, and Bishops, exclusive of
the other Clergy, or any writing whatsoever, wherein it does not either
signify the whole Clergy generally, or the inferior Clergy only, exclusive of
the Archbishops, Bishops, and other Prelates; and it is my opinion as far as I
can find, that the word Populus following Clerus, was, Thema universale in
significando, and comprehended as well the Commons as the Lords, and indeed the
subject matter of the Historians speaks it. William the Second, Henry the
First, King Stephen, and King John, were to be elected and created Kings of
England, having no hereditary right, 'twas but reasonable then, and according
to the Laws and precedents of other Countries in like Cases, Quod omnes tangit
ab omnibus approbari debet, and so was the solemn Resolution of both Lords and
Commons in the Parliament, 40 E. 3. Rot Parl. 40 E. 3. n. 78.

But now to close the Reign of Henry the first, I will out of that excellent
Historian Matthew Paris transcribe the Oration Regis Henrici ad Anglos.
Oration, or Speech of that King to the Common Council or Parliament, in the
seventh year of his Reign, his elder Brother Robert Duke of Normandy, then
claiming the Crown of England, and ready to invade this Nation with a great
Force; the Speech of the King, the learned Monk thus delivers to us.

quam frontose illud infoeliciter refutaverit, merito propterea a Deo
reprobandus. Nostis etiam in multis aliis superbiam and ferocitatem illius;
quia vir bellicosus, pacis impatiens est, vosque scienter quasi contemptibiles
and quos desides vocat and glutones conculcare desiderat. Ego vero Rex humilis
and pacificus vos in pace in antiquis vestris libertatibus, prout crebrius
jurejur ando promisi, gestio confovere, and vestris inclinando consiliis
consultius ac mitius more mansueti principis sapienter gubernare, and super his

promissis, quae tamen in fine impudenter violavit, omnium corda sibi
inclinavit, ut pro ipso contra quemlibet usque ad capitis expositionem
dimicarent.

This Speech to me is another strong Confirmation and Argument against the
Norman Conquest, for it is luce clarius, 1. That King Henry the First did not
pretend to hold the Crown Jure Victoris. 2. That the English were not totally
subdued and destroyed by his Father William the first. 3. That the Son (as well
as the Father) had several times solemnly sworn to the inviolable observance of
the Laws of St. Edward or of the Saxon Government. 4. King Henry does not
depend on the Normans that came in with his Father, no, it was upon the English
Common Council, or Parliament; nor did he call them Vassels and Slaves, but
Amici and Fideles mei naturales, in them he fixed his only hope and assurance,
both for their Fidelity and Courage, and believed that they would (as indeed
they did) preserve and defend his Crown and Life against the great Power and
Policy of his and the Kingdoms most bloody Enemies, who were ready to Invade
both with a mighty Army; it being then Prudentially and Politickly resolved
unanimously in Parliament, not to permit, or suffer the Duke to land here, but
to fight him in his own Country, which the English then did (forty years after
the coming in of William the first) and at one Battle not only totally
conquered and overthrew the Normans, but took Robert their Duke Prisoner, and
thereby put a period to the dangers and fears of King Henry the first, and in
despite of the French Power, set the Ducal Crown of Normandy upon the head of
King Henry an Englishman: and after Robert had remained for some time in
Prison, at last to conclude the Catastrophe of his unhappy life, he had his
eyes burnt out of his head, and so by a sad fate left all to the English King.

From all which Authorities and Reasons, under correction, it is sufficiently
evidenced, that in the British, Saxon, and Norman Governments, the Commons (as
we now phrase them,) had Votes, and a Share in the making and enacting of Laws
for the Government of the Kingdom, and that they were an essential part of the
Commune Concilium Regni, Wittena Gemot, or Parliament, before and after the
supposed Conquest by King William the First.

Having thus concluded my Preface, I shall now diligently apply my self to
discuss that grand point touching the introduction of the Commons into our
great Council, or Parliament, as represented by the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses, being indeed the principal work I intended, and was finished before
this Preface; the difficulty of which cannot be well judged of but by those who
have undertaken subjects of like intricacy; for I have at a great charge, and
expense of time, and without any man's assistance or help, out of the dark and
neglected paths of Antiquity, endeavored to make truth public and general,
and (with submission) I hope it will appear, that I have rescued from the force
and power of a dangerous growing error, the just and ancient rights and
privileges of our Ancestors, in a matter of the highest moment and concern,
which is impartially debated in the ensuing Discourse; a subject, whereof (to
the best of my knowledge) no Author hitherto has so particularly treated.

A DISCOURSE Wherein is proved, That the Commons of England were an essential
part of the Parliament before the 49th of Hen. 3.
SEveral great and learned Authors of our Age having in their works and
writings frequently published, and asserted to the world this Position as an
unquestionable truth,

That the Commons in Parliament (as distinguished from the Lords) compounded of
Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, had their first birth and beginning by
Rebellion, An. 49 H. 3. and that too after the Battle of Jews, when the Barons
had the King and Prince in their power as Prisoners, and exercised Regal
Authority in his name:

The consideration and consequents thereof raised in my mind a great desire
seriously and impartially to enquire into so important a point of Antiquity;
and the better to satisfy both my own judgment, and the judgments of some of
my Friends, I have run over many Records, and Historians, both Ancient and
Modern, in Print and Manuscript, but cannot find any authority or reason to
give a color to so harsh an assertion.

I shall therefore, under an humble submission to so eminent Antiquaries,
endeavor to disprove this notion of 49 H. 3. by these following Arguments.

1. From the Claim and Prescription of the Borough of St Albans in the
Parliament of 8 E. 2. to send two Burgesses to all Parliaments, sicut caeteri
Burgenses Regni totis retroactis temporibus, in the times of E. 1. and his
Progenitors; if so, then in the time of King John Grandfather to E. 1. and so
before H. 3.

2. From Records Ano 15o Johannis Regis, wherein the Citizens and Burgesses
(not so numerous then as after, and now) together with the Earls, Barons, and
Magnates Angliae, were to give Consilium and Auxilium ad honorem Regis and suum
and statum Regni, who shortly after met at London, Convocatum Parliamentum de
toto Clero, and tota secta laicali, and so within the express prescription of
the Borough of St. Albans.

3. From the solemn resolution and great judgment of both Lords and Commons in
the Parliament of 40 E. 3. against the Pope, That if King John had Ano 14o of
his Reign (which was three years before the granting of his Magna Charta) made
the Kingdom tributary to the Pope, he had done it sanz lour assent, which must
be understood to be without the consent of the Lords and Commons, and therefore
void.

4. From several Records, inter alia, de Annis 28, 32, 37, 42, 48 H. 3.
mentioning Parliaments then held, and their proceedings, in some of which the
word Commons is expressly mentioned, as well as the Prelates, and Magnates, to
be part of those Parliaments.

5. From an act of Parliament 2 H. 5. that famous Prince, where it is declared
and admitted, that the Commons of the Land were ever a part of the Parliament,
and so consequently were part of the Parliaments Annis 16, 17 Johannis, 28, 32,
37, 42, 48 H. 3. all within the prescription of the Borough of St. Albans.

6. From the form of penning of Acts of Parliament, and expressions in Records
in 49, 51, 54 H. 3. when it is granted that the Commons were a part of the
Legislative power, which agree with the phrases of Records of Acts of
Parliament before that time.

7. From the defect and loss of the Parliament Rolls of H. 3. and E. 1. and
from the universal silence of all Records, and our ancient Historians
contemporary and succeeding 49 H. 3. till our days.

8. From the various opinions of learned men, in and since H. 8. time, who
never dreamed of any such origin, nor was ever heard of, till of late.

9. From comparing of the ancient Generale Concilium, or Parliament of Ireland,
instanced Ano 38 H. 3. with ours in England, wherein the Citizens and Burgesses
were, which was eleven years before the pretended beginning of the Commons in
England.

The FIRST ARGUMENT.
From the claim and prescription of the Borough of St. Albans, in the
Parliament of E. 2. to send two Burgesses to all Parliaments, sicut caeteri
Burgenses Regni totis reretroactis temporibus, in the times of E. 1. and his
Progenitors, if so, then in the time of King John Grandfather to E. 1. and so
before H. 3.

E. 2. 5 E. 2. P(...)'s 4. part of Parliamentary Wri^s, page (...).
in their Petition to King E. 2. Ano 8o say, that they, sicut ^^eteri Burgenses
Regni ad Parliamentum Regis (when it should happen to be summoned) per duos
Comburgenses suos venire debeant, prout totis retroactis temporibus venire
consueverunt, tam tempore domini Ed. nuper regis Angliae patris regis, as well
in the time of E. 1. the Kings Father, and Progenitorum suorum, as in the time
of E. 2. semper ante instans Parliamentum, and declared that the names of such
Burgesses coming to Parliament were always enrolled in the Those Rolls lost, or
destoyed. The Statute of Articuli Cleri made the next year after this Record
cells us that there were divirsa Parliamenta temporibus Progenitorum suor^^
Regum Ang^^^. Coke 2. Instit. (...). 618.
Rolls of the Chancery; notwithstanding all which the Sheriff of Hartford at
the procuration and favor of the Abbot of St. Albans and his Council, refused
Burgenses praedictos praemunire, seu nomina eorum retornare prout ad ipsum
pertinuit, etc. and therefore they pray remedy.

Respons. Scrutentur Rotuli, etc. de Respons. est per Concilium.
Cancellaria, si temporibus Progenitorum Regis Burgenses praedicti solebant
venire vel non? and tunc fiat eis super hoc justitia vocatis evocandis si
necesse suerit.

I do not think there needs much enforcing this Record, since the prescription
of sending duos Comburgenses ad Parliamentum Regis, sicut caeteri Burgenses
Regni did, is, that they and their Predecessors were always accustomed to send
two Burgesses to Parliament in all former Ages, not only in the time of E. 1.
but his Progenitors; therefore in King John's time, his Grandfather at least,
and so before H. 3.

And though the answer to the Petition, which in that Age was given in
Parliament (per Concilium, or all the Judges of England, and others the Kings
Learned Council) say, Scrutentur Rotuli, si temporibus progenitorum Regis Nota,
Rolls of Summons to Parliament, were extant this very Parliament, Rot. Claus. 8
E. 2. m. 25. Selden's Titles of Honor, fol. 604, 605. It appears by the Patent
Roll of 26 E. 3. that there were Parliamenta, and Summons to Parliament,
temporibus Progenitorum, and ante annum 49 H. 3. Rot. Pat. 26 E. 3. Pars 1. m.
23.
(which may go to the whole Reign of King John, as before) Burgenses praedicti
solebant venire, vel non; yet that grave and wise Council do not in the least
scruple, but clearly admit and confirm the general prescription, that there
were Boroughs that sent Burgesses to Parliament, temporibus E. 1. and
Progenitorum suorum, which goes higher than H. 3. his Father; and it cannot in
common reason be supposed, much less believed, that the Burgesses of St Albans,
or the Lawyer or Penman of the Petition, should dare to tell the King and
Learned Council, in the face of a Parliament, a Novelty so great and
ridiculous, and that Recorded to Posterity by the Council, that they and their
Predecessors, in the time of E. 1. and his Progenitors, had sent two Burgesses
to every Parliament, when all the World then knew (if the modern opinion be
true) that there was never any Election of any Burgesses to Parliament before
the 49 H. 3. which was but 50. Years before 8 E. 2. and at the time of the
Petition fresh in their own memories.

No, surely the Burgesses of St Albans did not ground their Petition of Right
upon a general allegation, or an affirmation in nubibus; but the justice and
certainty of their claim, as they themselves very well knew, so they prayed it
might be examined and tried by uncontrollable Witnesses, Records, the Rolls of
Chancery. The Chancellor and the rest of the Council, did no less know there
were such Rolls, and therefore order the search; but if the Petition had been
notoriously false and idle, instead of recording it to future Ages, they would
with contempt and scorn have rejected it, nor would the great Abbot of St
Albans, his Council, and the Sheriff of Hertford, against whom the Petition was
exhibited, have been wanting in their own defense, to have showed and proved
that this ancient prescription was a mere Chimaera, and fable; no, they all
were well satisfied, that the Borough had sent two Burgesses to every
Parliament, in the time of E. 1. and his Progenitors, and therefore it was in
vain to oppose or contradict their just and ancient right, according to their
prescription; all which appears clearly by this, that both before the time of
the Petition, and ever since, they have sent two Burgesses to every Parliament.

The SECOND ARGUMENT.
From Records An. 15 Johannis Regis, wherein the Citizens and Burgesses, (not
so numerous then as after, and now, together with the Earls, Barons, and
Magnates Angliae,) were to give Consilium and Auxilium ad honorem Regis and
suum and statum Regni, who shortly after met at London, Convocatum Parliamentum
de toto Clero and tota secta laicali, and so within the express Prescription of
the Borough of S. Albans.

I Am not ignorant that some have dated the origin of the Commons being a part
of the Parliament, from the Parliament of Runningmead, 17o Reg. Joh.

It may therefore be worth our pains to observe this great Record following,
and to consider whether from thence may not be proved this Conclusion:

That (...) great Cities and Boro(...)s of the ^ingdom (not so (...)merous then
as after and now) in the 16o of King John, before the granting of his Magna
Charta, or (...) confirming the ancient Laws in his 17th year, at Runningmead,
did send their Proxies and Representatives, to the Commune Concilium Regni, or
Parliament; for it cannot be supposed in reason, that every individual Citizen
and Burgess could come, no more than every Parson of a Parish to a Convocation,
or to a meeting of the whole Clergy of England.

The Record says, That the Rot. Pat. 15 Joh. Pars 2. m. 2.

And all the great Boroughs of the Demesnes of the King, giving In the ancient
Subsidy Rolls we often meet with the Tenants in ancient Demesne in Parliament,
and giving Subsidies, and it is the opinion of my Lord Hobart, sol. 48. that by
continuance of time they were discontinued, and it may be one reason thereof
was, that it was an ease granted them by the King in favor of their labor of

them account of his proceedings and successes in his War against the French,
and that the Pope had by his Letters released the Interdict, under which the
Kingdom then lay, which the King had then sent to Peter Bishop of Winton, Chief
Justice of England; and therefore desired that they would believe what the
Bishop should speak to them, that Consilium and Auxilium vestrum ad honorem
nostrum and vestrum and statum Regni nostri in melius communicandum efficaciter
super hoc apponatis, and that majori festinatione expediretur, Test apud

make two observations.

Though the Writ be general, 1. Negative.
and mentions not any time or place for meeting or coming to Parliament, or the
great Council (the King referring that I suppose to his Regent or Chief Justice
here) yet it cannot be intended that Peter Bishop of Winchester, being then
Chief Justice of England, should go from County to County, City to City,
Borough to Borough, or as our Churchwardens do, from House to House, rogare
Consilium and auxilium (the proper business of a Parliament) to desire and
entreat for their Counsel and Aid, for the Honor of the King, their own, and
statum Regni, and the safety of the whole Kingdom; surely that had been an
employment fitter for the wandering Jew, or Johannes de Temporibus; and such
counsel must needs have been of a very different and various nature, and both
agreeing very ill with the words majori festinatione, and urgency of the
contents of the Writs.

Let us then enquire what were the effects and consequents of these Writs, and
that brings me to the second observation.

King John began his Reign 6o 2. Affirmative.
Aprilis, the Writs bear date 6o and 8o Martii, which was the Close of An. 15o.
It may be the Winds were very cross, or for some other reason the Letters might
not so speedily be brought over, or published here, or after the summons there
might be above forty days before they met. But sure it is, in the beginning of
July, (after that March) being the sixteenth Year of his Reign, we find:

of the Inner Temple, or rather as the Learned Grotius, Honos Britanniae, to
drive the nail home, says, But we know by what is already showed, that diverse
former Parliaments were in this Kings time (meaning before the granting of his
Magna Charta, An. 17 Joh.) though the Laws made in them be lost. And in the
year before the Charter also (which was An. 16 Joh.) the Author of Eulogium
says, that Convocatum est Parliamentum Londoniis praesidente Archiepiscopo cum
toto Clero and tota secta laicali, wherein per Domini Papae praeceptum illa
obligatio quam Rex Domino Papae fecerat cum fidelitate and homagio relaxatur
omnino, vii' die Julii.

Having thus proved a Parliament in the 16th of King John, and that the
Citizens and Burgesses had their Summons to it, which is remarkable by a Writ
particular and distinct from that of the Lords, viz. the Earls, Barons, and
Magnates Angliae, I will conclude this Argument with the Statute of 5 R. 2.
Cap. 4. where it is enacted by the assent of the Prelates, Lords and Commons,
That all and singular persons and Communalties, (be he Archbishop, Abbot,
Prior, Earl, Baron, etc.) which should have a Summons to Parliament, should
come from thenceforth to the Parliaments in the manner as they were bounden to
do, and had been accustomed within the Realm of England of old times; and if
they did absent themselves, and came not, he and they should be amerced, or
otherwise punished according as of old times had been accustomed to be done:
from hence I shall observe,

1. That there were Summons to Parliament of old times, as well to the
Commonalties, that is, the Citizens and Burgesses; as to the Archbishops,
Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls and Barons; and so the Statute may seem to
affirm the prescription of St Albans, that says, that they had sent Duos
Comburgenses sicut caeteri Burgenses regni did to every Parliament totis
retroactis temporibus before E. 1. and his Progenitors.

2. That the phrase of old times is in point of prescription and antiquity
applied equally, and without distinction or limitation, as well to the great
Lords, as Commons; But if the first had of old times, as our modern Authors
write, been the only constituent parts of the Parliament, it might in reason
and prudence be thought, they would not have consented to have admitted that
Summons to Parliament; for the Commons was Coeval with theirs; nor would they
have ratified and confirmed by a solemn Act the protestation or declaration of
Right of the Commons of England in the Parliament, 2 H. 5. n. 10. That the
Commons had ever been a member of the Parliament, and that no Statute or Law
could be made without their assent. 3. That if the Lords and Commons absented
themselves, and came not to Parliament, they should be amerced, or otherwise
punished as of old times had been accustomed to be done; this branch plainly
agrees, 1. With the Modus tenendi Parliamentum, Written as Mr Seldom says
tempore E. 3. That the first day the Burgesses and Citizens should be called,
and if they did not come, they should be amerced; and so Mr Prynn mistakes in
Mr. (...) Animadversions on the Lord Cokes Fourth Inst. page 3.
his Animadversions, when he says, that no absent Lord was fined before 31 H.
6. 2. It appears, Ex vi terminorum, of old times it had been so accustomed to
be done; that this prescription may well be applied to the Parliament of 16
Joh. and long before; for the Statute of Magna Charta, 17 of that King, says,
Civitas London habeat omnes libertates suas antiquas; by force and virtue of
which word, antiquas, their old or ancient Liberties and Customs (not only
confirmed by the Magna Charta of William the First, but used even in the Saxon
times, and before) were in Parliament ratified and confirmed.

The THIRD ARGUMENT.
From the solemn and great Judgment of both Lords and Commons in the Parliament
of 40 E. 3. against the Pope, That if King John had An. 14. of his Reign, which
was three years before the granting of his Magna Charta, made the Kingdom
tributary to the Pope, he had done it sanz lour assent, which must be
understood to be without the consent of the Lords and Commons, and therefore
void.

KIng John An. 14. of his Reign Mr. Paris Anno 1213. page 236. An. Regni Ioh.
14.
made himself and Crown tributary to the Pope.

But Anno 40 E. 3. The Prelates, (...). Parl. (...) (...). 3. n. 7, 8.
Dukes, Counts, Barons, and Commons; upon their full deliberation in
Parliament, resolved with one accord, that neither the King, nor any other,
could put the Realm nor people thereof into such subjection, sanz assent de
eux, without their assent, viz. as well of the And with this agree the Scottish
Laws. Et idem Rex Scotiae dicit sicut prius quod de aliquo Regnum s^^m
contingente non est a(...)s nes potest hic respondere inconsultis probis

Jurisdiction, 28 E. 1.
Commons, as of the Lords: and that it appeared by many Evidences, that if he
had so done, it was done sanz lour assent, and contrary to the Coronation Oath.

And if the Pope attempted any thing against either (having at the instance and
solicitation of the Rot. Pat. 15 Johannis Pars 2. m. 8. Interdictum, quod
vulgariter utlagatio nuncupatur.
French King, threatened to interdict or outlaw both) King and Kingdom; They
would oppose and resist him, ove tout lour puissance.

The observations I shall make from this great Judgment shall be two.

1. That above 300. Years ago, there was not the least scruple or fancy, that
the Commons of England, Nam cum sub Edwardo tertio in ordinum consessu quaestio
habebatur de donatione illa decantatissima Johannis Regis sacta Innocentio
Papae tertio and successoribus ejus, unde Urbanus Quintus tum annum inde natum
mill marcarum Angliae and Hiberniae simul nomine censum sibi tunc solvi
petehat, etc. Ordines universi idque tam generis ^ieratici (quod mirere) quam
Proceres seu Senatus populusque in Comitiis illis solenni inita deliberatione
responderunt unanimes irritam plane fuisse Johannis donationem illam utpote tam
sine Ordinum assensu quam Juramento ejus inaugurali adversam. Johannis Seldeni
ad Fletam Dissertatio. Cap. 10. fol. 552.
of which the Citizens and Burgesses were then undoubtedly a part, ought not,
and were not to be present in the Commune Concilium Regni, or Parliament of
King John's Reign, and to have assented to that Kings resignation, An. 14. to
make it legal and valid, as well as the Prelates, Earls, and Barons.

2. If the Commons had never been a part of the Parliament before 49 H. 3. but
that the King and great Lords only made Laws, and had an inherent power (as
some of our Modern Writers say) to tax the whole Kingdom, de alto and basso ad
libitum suum jure repraesentationis; surely they would not have left recorded
to posterity so great a testimonial of the antiquity and right of the Commons
of England (then so distinguished from the great Lords) as is expressed in the
Roll: May it not then be admitted they spoke nothing but what was an
undisputable truth, in diebus illis, unless we must believe, that the great and
learned Authors of this Age, better understand the constituent parts of the
Communia Concilia, or Parliaments of King John's time (and so upward) above 460.
Years since, than the whole Parliament of 40 E. 3. the Parliaments of their
Grandfathers time, as was the Reign of King John.

And indeed this famous resolution was no other than a Declaration of the
ancient Common Law of the Land before the Norman Duke gained the Imperial Crown
of England, as appears by King Harolds Answer to his Ambassadors, requiring the
performance of the Kings Oath to take the Dukes Daughter to Wife, and to
preserve the Crown for him.

De Regno addebat praesumptuosum fuisse, quod absque generali Senatus and
populi Conventu and Edicto alienam illi haereditatem juraverit

Which is recorded by William of Malmsbury, Lib. 3. p. 56. l. 24. in vita
Williemi I. an Author without all exception, who flourished in the time of H.
1. and therefore could not be ignorant where and in whom the Legislative Power
of England did reside, there being but 33. Years from the coming in of the
Norman Duke till the Reign of that King, and of this Historian the learned
Balaeus gives this Eulogium, Vir erat suo seculo in omni genere bonarum
literarum plene eruditissimus, and in eruendis antiquitatibus ingenio,
diligentia and industria singularis Angliae nostrae nationis studosissimus
illustrator.

Upon the Death of Arthur Duke of Bretaign, the Annals of England tell us, that
King John was Summoned by the French King, as Duke of Normandy to appear at his
Court, and judicially to answer the pretended murder of Arthur his Nephew;
whereupon the Bishop of Ely, and Hubert de Burgo, after Earl of Kent, and Chief
Justice of England, nuntii solemnes and prudentes, were sent to the French
King, to whom the Bishop thus spoke, Domine Mat. Paris. page 283, 284.
Rex non possit Dux Normanniae ad Curiam vestram venire, nisi veniret Nomine
Baronagii Angliae omnes quodammodo Regni Ordines continerentur. Camd. Britan.
in 4. De Ordin. Angliae. fol. 61.
Rex Angliae, cum una persona sint Dux and Rex. Quod non permitteret aliquo
modo Baronagium Angliae, etsi ipse Rex hoc vellet. So careful was the Baronage
or Parliament to preserve the ancient rights, safety, and honor of the King
and Kingdom, An. 3 John before any difference happened between him and his
Subjects.

Anno 29 E. 1. the King sent Ambassadors Ex Chronico Adam Merimouth in
Bibliotheca Cottoniana sub Effigy Cleopatrae. A. 16. p. 67, 68. An. Dom. 1300.
29 E. 1.
to the French King, ut quid de truga, de guerra, and de pace deliberasset,
nunciaret, and was answered, se non posse sine duodecim paribus qui occupati
fuerunt circa novam guerram tam ardua tractare, but that he expected their
coming in fifteen days. Quo tempore transacto, ipsis consentientibus, they
declare that they could not determine thereof, inconsultis secum Scotis.
Whereupon those Ambassadors returned. Igitur convocato Parliamento Londoniis,
recitatisque frustratoriis dilationibus and falsis machinationibus
praedictorum, Ambassadors were again sent, and received this answer: Quod Rex
Angliae adveniret Rot. Claus 3 E. 1. m. 9. in Schedula. Deliberationem habere

King of England, Aliud habuit Parliamentum, in quo talia recitata
displicuerunt, and ex totius Regni Concilio (or Parliament) definitum est,
Regem pro aliquo mandato vel suggestionibus ab Anglia egredi non debere.

From what has been said, the Reader may easily observe, 1. That the weighty
and great affairs which concerned the King and Kingdom, both in the Saxons
time, and after, were by a fundamental principle and law of the Nation to be
consulted of, and resolved in the Communia Concilia, or Parliaments, and that
no particular person or order of men did take upon them such power, sine
consensu Regni: and this H. 3. and his Council well knew, when he told Otto the
Popes Nuntio, Quod solus non potuit definire, nec Mat. Paris. page 325. l. 45.
9 H. 3.
debuit negotium, quod omnes Cleri^os and Lai^os generaliter totius Regni
tangebat, which E. 1. and his Council in the 23th Year of his Reign thus
confirms, Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus Rot. Claus. 23 E. 1. m. 3. dorso.
approbetur. 2. That the Generalis Senatus, and Populi Conventus, and Edictum,
or Saxon Wittena Gemott, the Baronagium Angliae, in King John's time, and the
Concilium Regni, or Parliamentum, in the Reign of E. 1. were verba synonyma,
differing in phrase, but one and the same Assembly in substance.

I have an Abridgment or abstract of the Rolls of this Parliament, writ by the
hand of Mr. Elsing, late Clark of the Parliament, who says, my Lord Coke had

Exchequer enrolled at that time.

And not only so, but that Record tells us, Quod quaedam Ordinatio facta in

And we read in another Record,

that there were no Commons, or Citizens and Burgesses in Parliament before 49
Hen. 3. would do well to define and ascertain, who the Communitas were after
the words Praelati, Barons and Magnates, in the before-expressed Records.

The FIFTH ARGUMENT.
From an Act of Parliament, An. 2 H. 5. that famous Prince, where it is
declared and admitted, that the Commons of the Land were ever a part of the
Parliament, and so consequently were part of the Parliament Annis 16, 17 Joh.
28, 32, 37, 42, 48 H. 3. all within the prescription of the Borough of S.
Albans.

THE Commons of England, upon their claim or protestastation, had, as their
undoubted and unquestionable right, and inherent privilege, allowed and
admitted in Parliament, that they had ever been a member of Parliament: then
were they a member of that 16 Joh. beforementioned, of 17 Joh. 28, 32, 37, 42,
and 48 H. 3. and that no Statute or Law could be made without their assent.

The Record says, That so as Rot. Parl. 2 H. 5. p. 2. n. 10. Nota. This
memorable Record amongst several others as remarkable, is entirely left out in
the Exact Abridgment of the Parliamwnt Rolls, published under the name of Sir
Robert Cotton, by Mr. Pryn.
hit has ever be their liberte and freedom, that thar should no Statute, ne
Law, be made of lass then they yaffe thereto their Assent, considering that the
Commune of your Land, the which that is and ever has be a membre of your
Parliament, ben as well Assentirs as Petitioners.

Yet was the affirmation of the Commons no other than a renovation or memorial
of the ancient Law of the Land, as is proved before, and more fully explained
and confirmed by the Petition to the (...)
King and his Learned Council, and answer thereto in the Parliament of 8 E. 2.
The Record is not unworthy of a serious perusal. Erchevesque Evesque Prelatz,
Counts, Barons, and autre gentz de la Comunyalte Dengleterre que tiegnent lour
Manoirs en chief de nostre Seigneur, as well within the Forest as without, to
which Manors they had Gasz (Wast) appendant, don't les Seignourages avantditz
arentunt, by the acre, half acre, and per rode en approvaunt lour Manoirs.
Whereupon the Ministers of the King made seizure thereof, Pur ceo qu' eux ne
unt la license le Roy d'entrer. Therefore they pray, that they may approver
leur Manoirs and le poor pueple eyser, etc. Responsum in dorso, Il ne put
estre fait sanz novele ley la quele chose fere la Comunalte de la terre ne vult
my uncore assentir, infra, Coram rege.

From hence I make these Observations.

1. It proves that the Law could not be altered without consent of the Commons
of England, though in a case particular to the King, as this was, for the
Petition was coram Rege; nor could the King and Commons, without the Lords. For
Rot. Parl. 22 E. 3. n. 30.
E. 3. per avys des Prelatz and Grauntz de la terre fist respondre as les
petitions des Communes touchantes la leye de la terre, que les leyes eues and
useez en temps passez, ne le process dycelle useez cea en arere, ne se purrent
changer sanz ent fair novel Estatute, which as then they could not attend, but
shortly would.

2. That they ought to agree to all new Laws, and that no Statute could be made
without their assent. It is then remarkable, 1. That the Commons of England, as
now we style them, gave their suffrage and vote in the enacting and making of
all Statutes and Laws in the time of the Progenitors of H. 3. which taken
extensive, is a very large prescription of right, for that King by the Statute
of Assisa panis and cervisiae, Pulton Stat.
made after 49. when it is pretended the Commons began, viz. An. 51. tells us,
That at his Parliament Rot. Pat. 1 H. 3. m. 13. Rex Archiepiscopis, etc.
Militi^us and libere ten^ntib^s and omnibus fidelibus s(...)s per Hibernia^,
etc. quod in sig^^m fidelitatis ^estr^, etc. libertation Regao no^tro Angliae a
(...) vostro and no^is concessis de gratia nostra and dono in Regno Hiberniae
ga^deatis, etc.
held the first year of his Reign, he had granted that all good Statutes and
Ordinances, made in the time of his Progenitors, and not revoked, should still
be held. 2. But admitting the word Progenitors be restrained to two, which I
conceive was never intended by the Lawmakers, yet it cannot be denied but that
the Statute of Magna Charta, for so it is called 5 H. 3. Fitz-herb. Abrid. tit.
Sed non si^ Angliae Stat^ta oriri possunt dum nedum Principis voluntate sed and
tot^^s R^gni ass(...) ipsa cond^^t^r. Fortescue, cap. 8. page 40.
Mordaunc. n. 53. and by Fleta, Lib. 1. Cap. 28. and all other Statutes made at
least, temporibus Johannis and Ricardi I. Father and Uncle of Henry the Third,
had the assent of the Commons in Parliament, to make them Laws.

Now the word Progenitors in the Statute, must I conceive go higher than Ric.
1. for Bracton a Learned Judge, who flourished in the time of Henry the Third,
and so by a reasonable computation of time, may be supposed to have lived in
the latter end of the Reign of Ric. 1. or beginning of King John's, after he
had declared to posterity that he had bent his mind, ad vetera judicia
perscrutanda diligenter non sine vigiliis and labor, and whatsoever he found
Notatu dignum, he reduced in unam summam perpetuae memoriae commendanda,
concludes this Bracton. Lib. 1. cap. 1. fol. 1. Inhibitio ne qui Magnates, viz.
Com^s, Bar^, Miles, sea aliqua alia notabills persona transeat ad parts

point thus. Cum legis vigorem habeat quicquid de consilio and de consensu
Magnatum and Reipublicae communi sponsione authoritate Regis sive Principis
praecedente just fuerit definitum and approbatum.

And so just and excellent was the balance of the Constitution of our legal
Government, in preventing any order or rank of the Subjects, to impose upon or
bind the rest without their common consent, and in conserving as it were an
universal liberty and property to every individual degree of men, from being
taken from them without their assent, as the County Palatine of Chester, ab
antiquo were not Kings Vale Royal of England, fol. 9, 10, 11.
subject to such Laws to which they did not consent; for as well before the
Conquest of England, as after, they had their Commune Concilium, or Court of
Parliament, by authority of which the Barons, Milites and quamplures alii

Clergy, Barons, Knights, Esquires, and Commonalty, did with the consent of the
Earl make or admit Laws within the same, such as should be thought expedient
and behoveful for the Weal of the Inheritors and inheritance of the said
County, and no Inheritors or Possessors within the said County were chargeable
or liable, or were bounden, charged, or hurt of their Bodies, Liberties,
Franchises, Lands, Goods, or Possessions, unless the said County (or
Parliament) had agreed unto it. And I dare under submission affirm, that
neither this County Palatine, nor Durham, were ever subjugated to have their
Estates given away, at the good will and pleasure of the Earl or Bishop, under
any notion or fancy in those days of being their representatives in the Commune
Concilium Regni, or that being dependant Tenants, their consents were included
in their Lords assent: and if the Commune Concilium Cestrense, or Parliament,
was deduced from Records, it would be of greater use to show us as in a Mirror
the Government of England in ancient days, than what I have yet seen published
by any Author.

3. That the Answer of the King to the Petition penned and made by all the
Judges of the Land, his Council in Parliament cannot be supposed to be grounded
upon a modern usage of 59. years from the time of 49 H. 3. till then, if the
Tenants in Capite jure repraesentationis, made the Parliament as some hold, but
was a Declaration of the ancient Custom and right of the Nation.

4. That it was not in the power of all the Tenants in Capite of England, or
the greatest part, who were the Petitioners, though with the Kings consent, to
bind and oblige others, or to make or alter a Law, sine assensu Communitatis
Regni, who had votum consultivum, and decisivum, an Act of Authority and
Jurisdiction, as well in assenting to spiritual Laws as Temporal, as may appear
for an in^tance, in their Declaration or Protestation to E. 3. in Parliament.

ipsa primitus emanarunt. And that this was the ancient Law and Right of the
Kingdom, appears by the answer of E. 1. ano 22. of his Reign to the Petition of
the whole Clergy of England; for the Clergy having given the King medietatem

The SIXTH ARGUMENT.
From the form of penning of (...) of Parliament, and expressions in Records in
49, 51, 54 H. 3. where it is pretended the Comm^ns first began to be a part of
the Legislative Power, which agree with the phrases of Records of Acts of
Parliament before that time.

THE King writes to the Bishop (...)
of London, and to the rest of the Bishops of the Province of Canterbury, that
his heart was wounded (...)to dolor, that the Earl of Gloucester, and other
Rebels, had by crafty persuasions circumvented, pro(...)r! Prince Edward, and

And the King per le Conseil and Passentement le Rei de Alemain, and les
Cuntes, and de Barons, and le Commun de la terre, pardoned and released the
Londoners, totes maneres de ire and de rancour and de male volente, etc.

The King and Prince having Rot. Pat. 54 H. 3. m. 7. intus. D^ signo (...).
undertaken the Crusado, for the Holy Land, quia tamen Praelatis, Magnatibus
and Communitati Regni non videtur expediens neque tutum, that they should be
both out of the Kingdom, istis temporibus, it was agreed the Prince should go,
and a Subsidy was granted to the Prince by the Parliament.

If one should show the Authors of the novel opinion, only these Records, and
thereupon ask them who the Communitas, mentioned in these Records, after the
words Praelati, Barons, and Magnates were, I doubt not but they would say,
Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, because they are after the pretended
inception of 49 H. 3. but then I desire to know what authority they can show,
why the Communitas in 29, 32, 37, and 48 H. 3. should not be a part of the
Parliament as much as of 49, 51, 54. of that King, since the words or phrases
of both are alike in the Records.

For I do not think it a true way of reasoning, That because the notion of 49
H. 3. is generally published by our now Historians, and so believed: Ergo, it
unquestionably was so, and has always and in all ages been distinctly known and
believed.

The SEVENTH ARGUMENT.
From the defect and loss of Parliament Rolls of H. 3. and E. 1. and from the
universal silence of all Records, and our ancient Historians contemporary and
succeeding 49 H. 3. till our days.

IT is true indeed for any thing For all Pa^^^ament ^^^ls of the time of H. 3.
are l(...) (...)* (...)me (...) in the Parl^^ment ^t O(...), in 44. of the ^ame
King, which I have heretofore used by the favor of an honoura^le person that
(...).
yet appears, the Parliament Rolls of H. 3. are all lost or destroyed, though
references are made to them by several Clause and Patent Rolls of H. 1. and H.
2. yet no direct Writ of Summons ad Parliamentum, is extant of that time,
either of the Lords or Commons (so Mr Pryn) till the Dorse of the Clause Roll
49 H. 3. in a Schedule affixed thereto, where there are Writs for Electing and
sending to a Parliament at London, two Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, and
Barons for the Cinque Ports, and likewise Summons to the great Lords.

But if that Roll of 49 H. 3. and Rot. Claus. 22 E. 1. had been destroyed as
many others of that time were, then had there been no footsteps or testimony
left us on Record, yet discovered, of any formal Summons to Parliament, of
(...) first Part of (...) Writs, ^ol. 16^. (...), sol. 33.
them or the Prelates and temporal great Lords, till 23 E. 1. though several
Parliaments were in the interim, no less than twelve as the Printed Statute
Books tell us. And P(...)'s Stat. (...). 1^, 18, 2^, ^^, 43, 44, 46, ^^, ^^,
71, 73.
the Commons expressly said to be present at some, and employed in all, if the
Phrase of Commune Concilium Regni implies so much, which (...) think is
unquestionable when compared with the Statute of Vide the Writs upon the
Statutes of (...)m. 1. 3 E. 1. Glo^^. 6 E. 1. de mercatorio^s, 13 E. 1. de
Va^^o, 20 E. 1. declare they were made per Commune Concilium Regni. Coke 2.
Instit. sol. 156.
Westminster. 1. made 3 E. 1. which was not eleven years after 49 H. 3. wherein the
constituent parts of the Commune Concilium Regni, are enumerated and expressed,
the Statute being made Per l'assentements des Archievesques, Evesques, Abbes,
Priors, Countes, Barons and tout le Comminalty de la terre illonques summones.

Now because from that one Record of 49 H. 3. (being the only Roll as yet found
out) it should be wonderfully observed, and from thence infallibly concluded
and nicked, and by an ominous and influential Asterism of Rebellion and Treason
marked, that the very All the antientest Writs of Summons of our Temporal Lords
to great Councils, being utterly lost through negligence, or perished through
the rust or consumption of time, the very first Writ of Summons to them, and
Calendar of their names, now remaining, is that of 49 H. 3. Prynns Register of
Parliamentary Writs, Part 1. sol. 160. ^^t to point out who they were (viz.
B(...) mai^res) that had their first rise by Writ of Summons until 22 E. 1. and
afterward, pasteth my skill, there being no public Record that does make
mention of them till then, excepting that of 49 H. 3. D(...) Pres* to his
Ba(...) Angliae, Tom. 1.
first Writs (whereby the great Lords are said to be also first Summoned) to
send two Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses for each County, City, and Borough,
(...) Parliamentum, in Octabis San^ti Hillarii, were made in this very year, at
that very Crisis of time, nay tested on such very days, when the rebellious
Barons (after the Battle of Jews) had the King and Prince in their power, and
exercised Regal Authority in his name, under good favor seems not at all
satisfactory and convincing to me, until they give more certain and greater
testimonials and evidence, and answer these few Records.

If the Epoch of the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, or Commons (as now
called and distinguished from the great Lords) being first admitted a part of
the Parliament and Legislative Power, had such a Creation and Origin, it is
more than a wonder, though the Parliament Rolls be destroyed, that the Lieger
Books, Charters, or Historians of that time, either National or Foreign, of
which there are not a few, or our ancient Lawyers, Bracton, Britton, Fleta, and
Hengham, had not amongst many Narratives of far less moment and weight, given
posterity a remark, or some short hint or memorial of so sudden, so great, and
so universal a change or Catastrophe of the whole constitution and ancient
frame of the English Government, as that must unquestionably be admitted to be,
or some subsequent Chronologer had not so much as dreamed of it till of late,
or that branch in the ancient Coronation Oath of our Kings, demanded by the
Archbishop, had not been omitted, or ne ver administered, which runs thus.

Concedis justas leges and consuetudines Ex MS. (...)s Honorabile^ Dominum Bar.
de Hollis.
esse tenendas, and promittis per te esse protegendas, and ad honorem Dei
corroborandas quas Vulgus elegerit secundum vires tuas. [Respondebit Rex,
Concedo and promitto.]

The word Elegerit, being admitted to be of the praeterperfect tense, it
certainly shows, that the peoples Election had been the foundation and ground
of ancient Laws and Customs; and the term of justas leges, seems to allow a
liberty of debate, reason, and argument, so much as might be of efficacy and
force, to demonstrate and convince, that the Laws so required by the Commons of
the King, were just and reasonable; the debate and consideration of which
certainly was never, nor ever could be intended to be done in the diffusive
capacity of all the Commons of England, separatim, but in an entire, or in an
aggregat body, that is, in their Communia Concilia, or Parliaments.

And with this agrees the Statute of Provisors, An. 25 E. 3. which says,
Whereupon the Pulton's Stat. sol. 99. 25 E. 3. It is considered and declared by
the whole body of this Realm now represented by all the Estates of the same
assembled in this present Parliament, that the Kings Highness, before Almighty
God, is bound as by the duty of a good Christian Prince, for the conservation
and preservation of the good Estate and Commonwealth of this his Realm, to do
all that in him is, to obviate, repress, and redress the said abusions and
exactions of Annates, or Firstfruits. Apad Capell. Rotulor. Rot. Parl. 23 H. 8.
n. 33.
said Commons have prayed our Sovereign Lord the King, that upon the mischiefs
and damages which happen to his Realm, he ought and is bound by his Oath, with
the accord of his people in his Parliament, thereof to make remedy and law, and
removing the mischiefs and damage which thereof ensue. (And this they say) since
the right of the Crown of England, and the Law of the Realm was such.

Nor indeed can I apprehend any colorable pretense, much less a probable
reason, that if the Barons had 49 H. 3. usurped the Sovereign power into their
hands, they should 1. So easily and speedily divide and share it with the
Commons, constitute a new Court of Parliament, and make them essential and
coordinate with themselves in the Legislative Power: sure we know it is natural
for all Courts, ampliare and non diminuere Jurisdictionem. 2. That at that
Parliament the numerous Barons (as they style them) should but summon 23. of
their own Order, when the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors and Deans, made
120, if we must be concluded by the Records. If there were then two Houses of
Parliament, and that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, did not sit with the
Lords, the Prelates having so great advantage of the Temporal Lords in their
Votes, were very unkind to the Crown they made not use of their overballance
for the delivery of the King and Prince, then said to be in Custody. 3. Nor
have I yet met with any reasons given, why when the Government of the whole
Kingdom was at this Parliament of 49 H. 3. to be settled after so long and
bloody a War, the Barons being then so victorious and numerous, as our modern
Authors say, they would by their absence hazard and endanger the loss of all by
entrusting the Prelates and Commons with the overbalance. Many remarkable
observations might be raised upon this Record, both as to the Lords and
Commons, but I will now pass to my eight Argument, concluding this with Mr
Pry^^s opinion, Mr Pry^n's Preface to S^ Rob^rt Cotton's Abridgment of the
Records i^ the Tower.
how the Parliament Rolls before E. 3. came to be lost or destroyed. I will use
his own words. That there are no Records at all in the Tower (except some few
ancient Charters or Exemplifications of them) antienter than the first year of
King John, all the rest from William the first his Reign till then (except some
few in the Exchequer not relating to Parliaments) being utterly lost, the first
Parliament Rolls yet remaining are these, 5, 8, 9, and 19th of King E. 2. the
Statute Roll of H. 3. E. 1. E. 2. containing some Statutes made in their
Reigns, a Parchment Book of some Pleas in Parliament during the Reigns of King
E. 1. and 2. and a few Bundles of Petitions in the Parliaments of 6 E. 1. and
1, 2, 3, and 4 E. 3. none of which are here abridged (viz. in the Abridgment by
him published) only I find in the Clause Patent Charter and Fine Rolls of King
John, H. 3. E. 1, and 2. some Writs of Summons, and some memorials of Acts,
Ordinances made, and Aids, Subsidies, Dismes, Quindisms, Customs granted in
Parliaments, held during their Reigns, the Rolls whereof are perished and quite
lost, either through the negligence of the Record Keepers, or the Injury,
Iniquity of the times during the Civil Wars between the King and Barons, in the
Reigns of King John and H. 3. and betwixt the two Houses of Lancaster and York,

for the Title of the Crown, wherein (it is very probable) the prevailing
King's parties, by their Instruments, imbezled, suppressed such Parliamentary
Records and Proceedings, as made most against their Interests, Power,
Prerogatives, Titles; or through the default of our Kings great Officers and
Attorneys, who sending for the Parliament Rolls out of the Tower, upon special
occasions, never returned them again for reasons best known to themselves, by
means whereof, those Parliament Rolls being no where to be found, their defects
must be supplied only out of such fragments and memorials of them, as are
extant in our other Records and ancient Historians, especially in Matthew
Paris, Matthew Westminster. William of Malmesbury, Henry Archdeacon of Huntingdon,
Roger de Hoveden, Simeon Dunelmensis, The Chronicle of Brompton, Radulphus de
Diceto, Ranulphus Cestrensis, and Thomas of Walsingham, who give us some
accounts of their proceedings and transactions, which else had been utterly
buried in oblivion, as well as their Rolls wherein they were at large Recorded,
as is evident by the Parliament Rolls yet extant.

The EIGHTH ARGUMENT.
From the various opinions of the learned men in and since H. 8. who never
dreamed of any such origin, nor was it ever heard of till of late.

IT would be tedious to set down the various and wandering opinions and reasons
of our modern Authors in English, touching the beginning of our Parliaments,
and constituent parts thereof, especially of the Commons, as now called and
comprehended in the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses in Parliament: I will but
instance in a few eminent Authors, and leave the Crowd behind.

The great Antiquary, Mr. Lamberd holds, that they were before Lamberd Archion.
sol. 246.
the time of William the First, and there are other learned men who give their
assent to that as a great truth.

Mr. Prynn says, By all the ancient Prynns Truth Triumphing over Falsehood,
Antiquity over Novelty, sol. 69. Parliamentum Synodus magn^ nun(...)r Somneri
Gloss.
Presidents before the Conquest, it is most apparent, That all our Pristine
Synods and Councils were naught else but Parliaments; that our Kings, Nobles,
Senators, Aldermen, Wisemen, Knights and Commons, were usually present, and
voting in them as Members and Judges.

Polydore Virgil, Hollinshead, Speed and Martin, are of opinion, that the
Commons were first summoned at a Parliament at Salisbury, An. 16 H. 1.

Sir Walter Raleigh in his Treatise of the Prerogative of Parliaments, thinks
it was Anno 18 H. 1.

My Lord Bacon in a Letter to Cabala sol. 65. A(...). 1621.
the Duke of Buckingham, asks, Where were the Commons before H. 1. gave them
authority to meet in Parliament?

Dr. Heylin finds another beginning, (...) (...) of the (...) World. (...).
and says, that H. 2. who was Duke of Anjou, was the first Institutor of our
High Court of Parliament, which (being an Anjovian) he learned in France.

But I cannot find that any of those ever supposed the Commons were first
introduced in Parliament 49 H. 3. by Rebellion.

Nor was this opinion entertained by any Author I can meet with, Anno 1529. 21
H. 8. for in an answer of that great and excellent person Sir Thomas More, Lord
Sir (...) More 's Works, sol. 296.
Chancellor of England, in his supplication of Souls against the supplication
of Beggars, discoursing about King John's making (in the 14th year of his Reign,
and three years before his granting Magna Charta) the Realm Tributary to the
Pope, declares his Judgment without any doubt or hesitation, and therein as I
take it the universal tradition and belief of all learned men of that and
precedent times:

That the Clergy and all the Lords and Commons of the Realm made the Parliament
in the age of King John, and that never could any King of England give away the
Realm to the Pope, or make the Land Tributary without their grant; whose Book,
and so his opinion we find approved of and published by a grave and learned
Judge of the Kingdom, Mr. Justice Willtelmus Rastall S^rviens ad lige^

(...) (...) 61^ and (...)
Rastall, and dedicated to Queen Mary her self, An. 1557. not much above a
Century ago.

The NINTH ARGUMENT.
From the comparison of the ancient Generale Concilium, or Parliament of
Ireland instanced An. 38 H. 3. with ours in England, wherein the Citizens and
Burgesses were, which was eleven years before the pretended beginning of the
Commons here.

AS great a right and privilege surely was and ought to be allowed to the
English Subjects as was to the Irish before 49 H. 3. and if that be admitted,
and that their Commune Concilium, or Parliament, had its Platform from ours, as
I think will not be denied by any that have considered the Histories and
Records touching that Land, we shall find the two ensuing Records, An. 38 H. 3.
clearly evince, that the Citizens and Burgesses were then a part of their great
Council or Parliament.

probi homines Terrae Hiberniae quint amdecimam partem de bonis and catallis
suis concesserunt gratiose to the King, which certainly was done in the
Generale Concilium, or Parliament, and that the general phrase (probi homines)
did include and comprehend the Citizens and Burgesses to be part of that
General Council, for Rot. Claus. 7 H. 3. m. 7. dorso, the Citizens of Dublin
are called Probi homines nostri Dublyn.

From hence may be observed, 1. That by the Patent Rolls of 38 H. 3. the
Citizens and Burgesses were summoned to meet at the great Council or
Parliament, as well as the Prelates, Earls, Barons, Knights, and Freeholders,
and equally desired to give the King a Subsidy of men and money.

2. That though in the Writ of E. 1. the Citizens and Burgesses are not
mentioned eo nomine, the phrases of directions in Writs being in those Ages
very various, sometimes more general, and sometimes more particular; yet the
words omnibus aliis Anglicis after Baronibus and Militibus, must comprehend the
Citizens and Burgesses, who were to meet and diligently to treat with the
Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and Knights and
Freeholders, whether it would be in prejudice of their Liberties and Customs,
if the mere Irish should enjoy the same Laws and Customs as they of the English
extraction did, and they were to join in giving their judgment and counsel with
the rest of the Parliament. And reason it self speaks it, since the admission
of the mere Irish into equal privileges and rights with themselves in their
Cities and Towns, would be of so great a consequence to them; for upon the
Kings granting by Charters to several Irish Families, the benefit of the
English Laws, great disputes arose, so that Rot. Claus. 10 E. 2. m. 28. intus,
upon a Petition to the King, he granted that semel in anno tene^tur
Parliamentum to redress their grievances touching the Irish and English Laws,
and so the word Parliamentum ascertains what those Councils were in the Patent
Rolls of 38 H. 3. and 5 E. 1. beforementioned.

And now I will close my Arguments, declaring under the good favor of so
eminently learned Authors, that their resolves and opinions which they have
published to the World, that the inception and original Election of Knights,
Citizens, and Burgesses, or the admission of the Commons of England (as now
phrased) into Parliament by Rebellion and Treason, Anno 49 H. 3. are not at all
satisfactory and convincing in my judgment, unless they give more certain and
greater testimonials than yet I have met with, and answer these few Records
against their so severe Position. A Position, believe me, that like a
tempestuous Whirlwind, not only rends off and dismembers an essential branch,
but shakes the very Root of the right and honor of our English Parliament, and
equally wounds both Lords and Commons, because these learned Authors themselves
do agree, that there is not yet discovered any formal Summons of the great
Lords (no more than of the Commons) to any Parliament before the said 49 H. 3.

And here I must beg the favor of the Reader of adding a supplemental
Argument, which at first I confess was not intended, and it is this.

If in the General Councils, or, in our present Dialect, Parliaments, for
instance, 1. Of France, 2. Spain, 3. Portugal, 4. Denmark, 5. Sweden, and 6.
Scotland, the Cities and great Towns or Boroughs, have from time immemorable,
both de jure and de facto, had their Delegates or Representatives:

Upon what authority or reason can it be believed, that so universal a Northern
Custom or Law, did not obtain and was never practiced in England before 49 H. 3?

1. FOR France we find their Paul^s Aemilius Hist. Franc. Lib. 9.
Conventus ordinum, or L'assemblie des Estates, consisted de Sacerdotio,
Nobilitate and plebe, of the Clergy, Nobility and Commons, this is evident by
the Parliament Roll Rot. Parl. 9 H. 5. n. 14. Pars 1a. Approbatio pacis inter
R^gna Angliae and Franciae nuper conclusae. Rot. Parl. 11 H. 7. n. 40. in

9 H. 5. which takes notice of the peace made between England and France, that
the same was confirmed in France, per tres Status regni, viz. Praelatorum and
Cleri, necnon Procerum and Nobilium ac etiam Civium, The last of which, being
the Citizens and Burgesses, appeared by their Representatives or Delegates.
Burgensium, Civitatum, Villarum and Communitatum dicti Regni Francorum, ipsi
tres Status eandem pacem and omnia and singula contenta in eadem APPROBARUNT,
LAUDARUNT, ACCEPTARUNT and AUCTORIZARUNT. It seems by this that the French
Kings were not so despotical and absolute by the fundamental Laws of that

2. In Spain their Curia or Cortes del Reyno, is compounded (as Dr. Heylin
cites out of the learned Bodin) of the Clergy, the Nobility, and the
Commissioners of the Provinces and ancient Cities.

3. The Portugal Cortes or Parliament The Portugal History. Impress. An. 1677.
page 279.
consists of the Bishops and Prelates, the Nobiles majores and minores, and two
Procurators or Burgesses from every City, who have a deliberative voice, which
they call definitive.

4. In Denmark, Pontanus says, P(...) in Hi(...)

Commissioners of Towns and Cities, made up their General Council.

5. For Sweden, it does not much Th^anus Hist. Lib. 131. fol. 1108. Tom. (...).
differ from the Government and form of Denmark, their Common Council
consisting of the same Estates and degrees of people, that is to say, Proceres
and Nobiles, the greater and the less Nobility, Episcopi and Ecclesiastici,
Civitates and Universitates, the Cities, Boroughs and Villages.

I might here if it were needful, show how great a share and interest the Hanze
or free Towns in Germany have by their Deputies in all Ages had in the Diet or
General Council of the Empire.

6. But now at last we are come to Scotland, Sir John Skene in his Epistle
Regiam Majestatem Scotiae.
Dedicatory to King James, before his Scottish Laws, writes thus. Intelligo
tuas tuorumque Majorum Leges quae cum Legibus Regni tui Angliae magna ex part
consentiunt; and then in his Book shows, that Willielmus cognominatus Leo, who
as is said, begun to Reign in 1105. and reigned 49. Years, so as he was King of
Scotland 510 of our Henry the first, held his Assise or Parliament at Apud
eundem Statuta Wilhelmi Regis, page 3. cap. 7.

ratified and confirmed in their Parliament, per Johannem de Balliolo, then
King, ac Praelatos and Nobiles and Universitates and Communitates Civitatum and
Villarum dicti Regni Scotiae; and the constant practice ever since has been,
that the Cities and Boroughs have sent their Proxies or Representatives to the
Parliaments of that Kingdom.

It may therefore seem very strange, that when the Cities and Boroughs in all
the Kingdoms of Europe, de jure and de facto were ab antiquis temporibus, even
in times coeval with the Government, an essential part of their Common Councils
or Parliaments, that England should not be under the same constitution, being
but descendants from Gaul, or the more Northern Countries; if so,

1. Was it because in the Britton, Saxon and Norman times, there were no Cities
or Boroughs, or if there were, were they so poor and inconsiderable, as they
deserved no observation in the eye of the State? or,

2. Was it because, by a strange and unheard of fate, peculiar and proper only
to them, they were not fit or capable to give or hear reason, as well as the
Delegates or Representatives of the Cities and Boroughs of France, Spain,
Portugal, Denmark, Sweden and Scotland? or,

3. Had they no property or right in their Estates? Certainly, in my opinion,
none of these Objections can be admitted, allowed, or proved; for

In the Brittons time, venerable (...) (...) (...). lib. 1. cap. 1.

would easily part with these Liberties and Privileges, which their Ancestors,
though less knowing and powerful, did claim and enjoy.

Having thus concluded my Arguments against the Position of 49 H. 3. I have
thought it not altogether impertinent, to add some brief Observations for the
better understanding of ancient Records, and Historians in their various
Lections and different expressions. I shall therefore consider,

1. The different application of the words Commune, Communitas, or Plebs. 2.
The several Denominations by which our ancient General, or Common Council or
Parliaments, were expressed. 3. The various acceptance of the word Baro, and
that under the Phrase of Baronagium Angliae, both Lords and Commons were
comprehended.
Observation I.
The different application of the words Commune, Communitas, or Plebs.

THere lies a main Objection Objection. Eum ^go Pl^b^i^m vo^^, qu^m leges
nostrae ^ominem leg^^^m appellant, says a learned man, a Lawyer and Privy
Councellor to the famous Queen. T^^. S(...) de Rep^^. A(...). 1. cap. 23. fol.

runs, Si liges and cons(...)s ab antiquis justis and deo devotis Regibus P^^bi

against me, for some Authors say, that the words Commons, Communitas, or
Plebs, is not to be met withal in any ancient Authors or Records; ab ingressu
Willielmi Primi usque ad excessum H. 3. and therefore conclude, they were never
a part of the Commune Concilium, or Parliament, before 49 H. 3. because not
mentioned eo nomine.

Admitting the Objection true Answer.
(which I conceive otherwise) yet it is no Conclusive Argument, for before the
Statute An. 3 R. 2. cap. 3. R(...)s Stat. page 135 ^^p. 3.
I cannot find the appellation of Lords Temporal, nor before the 13th of that
King cap. 2. the phrase Lords Spiritual and Temporal in our Ibid. page 156.
Printed Statute Books; Ergo, from thence it follows by a necessary
consequence, according to their Argument, that they were not any part of the
Generale Concilium, or Parliament, before those times, because not expressed by
that name. I suppose this Conclusion will not be admitted true.

But as I am well satisfied, that the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots and Priors,
who were often expressed by, and comprehended in the word Praelati, and who in
after times constituted the Lords Spiritual, and the Earls and Barons, as now
differenced, the Lords Temporal, were ab antiquo undoubtedly a part of the
Commune Concilium Regni, or Parliament; so it may be proved if insisted upon,
That the Milites and libere tenentes de Regno or Angliae, the Knights and
Gentlemen, or Freeholders of England (licet nonnunquam diversis and variis
appellationibus expressi and inclusi, in which those qui de Rege tenuerunt in
capite, or Barons Reges Antiqui cum in Chartis mentionem saciant de Baronibus,

were a Crepusculo temporis, a constituent and essential part also, although by
Historians and Records they are often mentioned by, and included in titles,
which in late times import more honor, and are now of an higher acceptance,
and had not the name of Commons fixed, or generally stamped upon them as in
after Ages. Sed haec obiter.

1. As to the word Communes (or 1. Observation.
Communitas) I have in my enquiries observed it to be used in six senses.

1. To comprehend the whole Commune Concilium Regni, or Parliament.

A le commune Dangleterre: Here Coke 2. Instit. fol. 539. Articuli super
Chartas, cap. 1.
Commune is taken for people, so as tout le Commune is here taken for all the
people, and this is proved by the sense of the words, for Magna Charta was not
granted to the Commons of the Realm, but generally to all the Subjects of the
Realm, viz. to those of the Clergy, and to those of the Nobility; and to the
Commons also. And that [Commune] in this place signifies people, it is proved
by the preamble, for there the great Charter and the Charter of the Forest, are
rehearsed to be granted Note, before 9 H. 3. Magna Charta was granted and
confirmed several times. Rot. Pat. 1 H. 3. n. 13. Rot. Claus. 2 H. 3. m. 11.

word Commune and Comminaltie: so as [A le Commune] here signifies not to the
Commons of the Realm, but to the people of the whole Realm; and herewith agree
our Books, for that a common nuisance which concerns le commune on le
comminaltie, le suite serra done au Roi, where [commune] and [comminaltie]
include all the Kings Subjects.

2. To comprehend the Communitas Rot. Pat. 48 H. 3. Pars 1. m. 8. dorso n. 10.
Praelatorum and Baronum.

3. To comprehend the generality of all that came to Parliament, after the
particular enumeration of the Orders of the great Lords, viz. Archiepiscopi,
Episcopi, Abbates, Priores, Comites, Barons.

The Statute of Westminster. 1. made Cok^ 2. Instit. fol. 156. Rastall's Stat. 12 E.

in the Parliament 17 E. 3. it is said, That the Petition for the Statute was
per Countes, Barons and Communes du Royalme, and so under the word Communes,
the alii Nobiles are included.

2. The several Denominations by which our ancient General, or Common Council,
or Parliaments, were expressed.

IF any man will be at the expense of so great a charge and trouble, as to
compare the various lections of Historians and Records together, and the manner
and phrase of words and speeches, proper to particular ages and times, he may
satisfy himself what those Councils were, and their constituent parts, whom
the ancient Historians mean, when they say,

here meant, being that of 37 H. 3. then made in the presence of the King, Great
men, and Communitatis Populi, is here said to be done in praesentia totius
Baronagii Angliae. And for the Honor of Magna Charta, I will conclude this
head with an Act of Parliament. That Valiant and great Prince, E. 4. after the
overthrow Rot. Parl. 12 E. 4. n. R(...)s Stat. 12 E. 4. cap. 7.
of his Enemies, and peaceful possession of the Crown, assisted with the Judges
of England, Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, his Dukes, Earls, Viscounts,
and Barons, with the great men or Knights of the Counties, and Commons in full
Parliament, has left this recorded to Posterity. They call this great Charter
the Laudable Statute of Magna Charta, which Statute was made for the great
wealth of this Land, upon which Magna Charta, the great Sentence and
Apostolic Curse, by a great number of Bishops, was pronounced against the
breakers of the same; and the same Sentence is four times in the year openly
declared, according to the Law of Holy Church; and in affirmance of the said
Statute, of the said great Charter, diverse Statutes have been made and ordained.

And great reason certainly they had to put so high a value on that so famous
Charter, since the substantial part of the Laws thereof were no less than the
great results, decrees, and judgments, ordained by the prudence and justice of
the British, Saxon, and Danish Dynasties, founded upon two grand and principal
Bases or Pillars, Liberty and Property, which like those two brazen ones called
Boaz and Jachin, supporting the Temple of Solomon, upheld the tottering Frame
and Fabric of our ancient Government, though often by evil men designed to be
overthrown.

A Charter, empta and redempta, (...).
purchased and redeemed with vast treasure of the Nation, and the effusion of a
Sea of Christian blood. A Law published and established with fearful
execrations, and terrible Curses, against the infringers and breakers thereof,
and all done with that religious solemnity, and profound Ceremony, as it may
seem inferior only to that of the Commandments of Almighty God given to the
Jewish Nation.

All great Ministers of State and Rot. Parl. 15 E. 3. n. 10. 37.
Justice were at their entrance into their Offices, solemnly to swear the
observation thereof, and great reason there was for the making of this Law,
both for the preservation of the King, and also the Kingdom; for that
Parliament well knew the woeful confusions in the Reign of Edward the Second,
who being seduced by his two Minions the Spencers, for want of observing the
good old Laws and Customs of England, cut off the head of Thomas Earl of
Lancaster his Uncle, that being the first act of shedding the sacred Royal
blood by color of Law I ever met withal in History; they usurped Royal Power,
they sent the Queen and Prince (afterward great Edward the Third) beyond Sea,
and prevailed with E. 2. to declare the Queen and Prince Traitors. They
Monopolized the Kings Eyes, Ears, and his whole Understanding, so that the King
nothing did, or would do, but what they did counsel him, Rast. Stat. 1 E. 3.
page 64, 65.
were it never so great wrong; and if any had the courage to complain against
them, or so much as fetch a loyal sigh, or lament the hard fate of the King
then imposed upon by those Favorites; they were branded with arraigning the
Government, striking at the foundation of State, and being guilty of Treason,
and what not.

The consequences of whose unhappy Counsels and Policies, are too well known in
History to have been the ruin both of the King and themselves.

The Priests and Confessors were Pupilla oc^li, fol. 50. cap. 22. De sen^entia
lata super Magnam Chartam.
strictly commanded to frame and direct the Consciences of the people to the
observation and obedience of the Great Charter, and they did so, not like the
Sibthorps and Manwarings of later times, who by their Flatteries of Prerogative
for their own promotion seek to ruin the Subjects property.

Observation III.
The various acceptance of the word Baro, and that under the phrase of
Baronagium Angliae both Lords and Commons were comprehended.

AS to the word Baro, it was Observation 3.
not much more in use before Camd. Britan. sol. 121. Selden's Titles of Honor,
in 4^^. Part 2^^. fol. ^73.
William I. obtained the English Diadem, that I can find, than the word
Communes, Baro Britanni pro suo non agnoscunt in Anglo-Saxonic is legibus
nusquam comparet nec in Alfrici Glossario Saxonico inter dignitatum vocabula
habetur. For the English Saxons called those in their own Language ^al^epmen
which in Latin were named Comites, and the Danes Earls, but of so extensive an
import in its signification, as we read of Aldermani Regis, Aldermani
Comitatus, Spelm. Gloss. Tit. de Aldermanis, and multipl^ci Magistrata apud
Anglo-Saxonis, sol. 24, 25.
Civitatis, Burgi, Castelli, Hundredi, sive Wapentachii and novem decimorum, so
according to the strict word they had whole Regiments of Earls. The greatest
title of which, N^^^ ^t Cantii Comites suo ordine percenseam (omissis Saxonibus
Godwino and aliis) qul non haereditarii sed officiarii Comites erant. Camd.
Britan. Cantium, fol. 248. Spelm. Gloss. Diatriba de Baronibus, fol. 64, 69,
70, 71.
seldom, if at all, descended hereditarily till the Confessors time, and after
Will. I. became King, the word ^al^epman began to change and vary its
signification, and in room of Aldermani Regis, we find Barons Regis; for
Aldermani Comitatus, Barons Comitatus; for Aldermani Civitatis, Barons
Civitatis; for Aldermani Burgorum, Barons Burgorum; for Aldermani Castellorum,
Barons Castellorum; for Aldermani Hundredorum, Barons Hundredorum sive
Wapentachiorum.

Sir Henry Spelman says, that simplices Spelm. Gloss. in (...) Baron^s, fol.
69, 70.
villarum Maneriorum Domini de quocunque tenentes qui sacham and socham habent,
were anciently called Barons.

And all Freeholders, hoc est tam Ibidem. Barouiae plurimae in Northumbria,
tumque omnino Marti se quasi consecrarunt, non est inter cos quispiam melioris

in Soccagio quam per servitium militare, had the Title of Barons; and in his
species of Barons Comitatus, says, Proceres nempe and maneriorum Domini nec
non libere quique tenentes, Anglice Freeholders, had that appellation. Notandum
autem est libere hos tenentes nec tam exiles olim fuisse nec tam vulgares ut
hodie deprehenduntur.

The great Seldom in his Notes Johannis Seldeni ad Eadmerum and notis and
spi^^leg. fol. 168.
upon Eadmerus upon the word Barons, says, Vocabulum nempe alia notione
usurpari quam vulgo, neque eos duntaxat ut hodie significare quibus peculiaris
ordinum Comitiis locus est.

And the learned Camden writes, Camd. Britan. in 8. Di ordin. Angliae, fol. 61.
Verum Baro ex illis nominibus videatur quae tempus paulatim meliora and
mollior a reddidit; nam longo post tempore non Milites sed qui liberi erant
Domini and T^^inorum enim d^o ^rant genera, majores quos Theinos Regis
appellabant, nos Barons Regis and Theini simpliciter seu Theini minores, qui

The authority of these most learned Antiquaries is such, That it would be a

And indeed Records and Histories will furnish us with several Precedents,
where succeeding Parliaments as well as these of H. 3. have sent Letters to the
Pope when he attempted to invade the Rights of the Crown or Kingdom. I will
give two instances in the Reigns of the two famous Princes, Edward the First,
and Edward the Third.

1. Edward the First, An. 29 of his Reign, claimed Scotland, as Rex and
superior Dominus, the Pope as a Fiefe of the Roman Church; the Pope backed by
the French King, Summons Edw. to appear before him in his Court at Rome, and
sends his Letters or Bulls to the Archbishop of Canterbury to serve them; the
Archbishop obeys, the King tells him, Verum quia consuetudo est Regni Mat.

Lincoln, in Octabis Sancti Hillarii, to advise with his Parliament, how to
defend the rights of the Crown against the Papal Claim.

The Parliament thereupon send their Letter to the Pope, subscribed and sealed
by several of the principal men of the Parliament, as Mat. (...). A. D. 1302.

the usage of that Age was, telling him, that sane convocato nuper per

And indeed the Commons were (...)
so highly incensed, that the Parliament Roll of this Year tells us, that La
dite Commune ne le poet ne le (...)t plus endurere those strange oppressions of
the Pope and Provisors.

So that the Parliament of 24 H. 8. after great debate and consideration, and a
diligent search and inspection of the Ancient Records of the Kingdom, did
ground their Statute amongst others, upon these great Authorities; the Statute
says,

Whereas the King his most noble Progenitors, and the Nobility and Commons of
the said Realm, at diverse and sundry Parliaments, as well in the time of King
Edw. 1. (...). 3. R. 2. H. 4. and other noble (...) of this Realm, made sund^^
Or(...)s, Laws, Statutes, and p(...), for the entire and sure (...)tion of the
Prerogative, Lib(...), and preheminenc^^ of th(...) (...) Imperial Crown of
this Realm, and of the Jurisdiction Spiritual and Temporal of the same; to keep
it from the annoyance; as well of the Sea of Rome, as from the authority of
other Foreign Potentates, attempting the diminution and violation thereof, as
often and from time to time, as any such annoyance or attempt might be known or
espied. Pulton's Stat. 24 H. 8. c. 12.

But to conclude the point of the Various Lections, Certainly the different and
great variety of words and phrases, by which both the ancient Historians and
Records have in their several Ages and Times, expressed and denoted the
Communia Concilia Regni, or Parliaments, as now called, and their constituent
parts, being not well observed and considered by most of our late English
Authors (who understood them as if they had signified what afterward they did,
and now do) have imposed on our Historical Faiths, and propagated to posterity
many palpable and gross errors, whereby great and unkind clashings and
diversities of opinions, as well amongst learned men as others, have had their
source and spring, nay, even between Prince and People.

THE General Conclusion.
MY only aim and endeavor in this Discourse has been from public Records,
private Manuscripts, and the best Historians, to search out and discover truth,
and to assert the just honor of our worthy and famous Ancestors Commoners of
England (as now phrased) great maintainers of the interest and dignity of the
King and Kingdom; and with submission to better Judgment, I hope I have plainly
proved,

1. That the Freemen or Commons of England were an essential and constituent
part of the Saxon Wittena Gemott, or Parliament.

2. That they so continued in the times of W. 1. W. 2. and H. 1. which last
being an Englishman, by way of Charter restored and confirmed the Laws of
Edward the Confessor, as his Father William 1. as well by his Magna Charta, or
Great Charter, as by his Oaths had before done, both when he was Crowned, and
also at Berkhamstead, in the seventh Year of his Reign.

3. And though the Rolls of Parliament, in the succeeding Kings Reigns till E.
2. be lost, or not found, so as we are at a loss as to the several Orders of
Parliament, yet by what has been deduced from other Records before cited, it is
evident I conceive, that the Citizens and Burgesses were a part of the
Parliament, Anno 16. of King John, and so had not their beginning by rebellion,
Anno 49 H. 3.

And therefore I may with good reason and warranty conclude, That our
Ancestors, the Commons of England, the Knights, Gentlemen, Freeholders,
Citizens and Burgesses of a great and mighty Nation, were very far from being
in former times such Vassals and Slaves, or so abject, poor and inconsiderable,
as the absurd and malicious ignorance and falsities of late Writers have been
pleased to make and represent them, especially the Author of the Grand
Freeholders I^quest, and Mr. James Howel, as if they were only Beasts of
carriage and burden, ordained to be taxed and t^lli^^ed, and have their Lives,
Estates, and Liberties given away and disposed of without their own assents,
under a novel opinion and conceit, that they were no part of the Commune
Concilium Regni, or Parliament, before 49 H. 3. Perlege quae Regni clarissima
Conciliorum
Sunt Monumenta, aliter nil praeter somnia cernis.


Appendix.
AFter I had completed the foregoing Arguments, a material Objection was by
some of my Friends offered me, which, if not cleared in this discourse, might,
in their judgment, give a color and pretense for a belief of an Opinion, which
is this:

That the Commons, or people of Objection.
England, were from the time of the Norman Conquest represented by such as held
of the K(...) (...) Capite, until 49 H. 3. and (...) by two (...) for each
County, and certain Burgesses for several Buroughs, and Barons for the Cinque
Ports.

Having before laid down a clear Solution.
and plain distinction between Barons Regis and Barons Regni, I shall
therefore now distinguish upon the phrase Milites and libere ^enen^es.

1. Milites and libere ten^ntes qui de Distinction.
Rege tenent in Capite.

2. Milites and libere tenentes de Regno. Distinction.

Eodem modo Seribi(...) omnibus vi^ecomitibus (...).

As to the second Distinction, The (...)
ancient Chronicles of the Kingdom say, That both before and after the
Conq(...) (as we phrase it) the Kings of England held their Court three times
in every year, at Easter, Whi^son^ide, and Christmas, and then the Crown was
attended with most of those qui de Rege (...) in Capite, this was called ^^ria
Regis; if any difference of right did arise between the King and his Tenants,
o^ between Tenant and Tenant, here it was heard and determined, and many things
were there acted and done in relation to the Kings (...) or Tenants, but under
favor this was not the Commune Concilium, Regni or Parliam(...) as we now call
it, for the King held this Court ex more of (...), as Simon D^netmensis -- and
(...) (...)igorniensis write in vita (...) Primi.

But when they, and contemporary Historians, take no^ice of the meeting of the
Commune Concilium, Regni or Parliament, then their expressions (...) and say,
That Rex as^ivit Orderieus vitalis, page 680. Exprecepto Regis convenerunt.
Eadmerus Rex Sanctione sua adunavit, Flor. Wigorn. Continuat, and many such
like expressions, which show it was not held ex more of custom, yet true it is,
Kings did often convene or summon the Common Council of the Kingdom at one of
the said Feasts, being a great convenience to the Tenants in Capite.

But they summoned the General Council also at other times, according to the
Emergency of Affairs, examples of which are obvious in the ancient Historians.

Now to show that the Milites tenentes qui de Rege tenuerunt in Capite,
(together with the other great Lords that held of the King) were not the parts
constitu^ntes, and alone did compose and make up the (...), the whole body of
the General^, or Commune Concilium, Regni or Parliament. I will begin with a
Statute or Act of Parliament made tempore Richard the First, who Reigned before

And at the same Parliament provisum fuit Communi assensu Archiepiscoporum,

Knights through all England should find a Tenth been para^um cum Equis and
Armis for the defense of the Kingdom, and that those nine Knights should find
the tenth Knight every day two shillings ad liberationem suam. Certainly the
words Fideles Angli^ cannot be understood to be restrained to the Tenants in

Anno 2 H. 3. Magna Charta was in Parliament granted and confirm^d, an ancient
Transcript of which, writ in the time of E. 1. I have, and conceive that those
who then gave a Subsidy of a Fifteenth to the Crown were the parts that
compounded and made the Communc Concilium, Regni or Parliament, and who they
were let the Charter speak. Pro^ac autem donatione, and concessione M. S. penes

The Charters I shall pass over, only with this former Observation, that I

who they were will appear by the Inspeximus of the Great Charter, and the

To deny therefore that the Knights and Freeholders de Regno of England were a
constituent part of the Commune Concilium, or Parliament, in 2 and 9 H. 3. but
were represented by the Tenants in Capite. A man may with equal Reasons, and as
strong Authorities argue and affirm, that though the Records plainly declare
the Enumeratio partium of those great Councels, and the Comites and Barons to
be one part then present, and that they gave a Subsidy concurrent with the
other parts, yet really, 1. They were not there nor joined in the Tax, but were
represented by the Milites and libere tenentes de Regno. 2dly, Though the
Comites, Barons, Milites, and libere Tenentes de Regno are expressly and
particularly mentioned in these grand Charters, yet in truth they were not
present at those great Councils, but their Votes and Power were included, and
they represented in and by omnes Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, Abbates, and Priores
de Regno, (though the greater number of the two latter held not of the King in
Capite,) who made Laws, and gave Taxes exclusis or omissis Comitibus Baronibus
Militibus, and libere tenentibus de Regno. Or 3dly, Notwithstanding the naming
of the Prelates of the Church, yet their Power, Vote, and Authority was
transferred and made over to the Earls, Barons, Knights and Freeholders of the
Kingdom, and their appearance there was not Personal, but by Representation,
which no man certainly can believe.

I shall close up this Point with a Inter Communi^ de Termino S. Hillary 17 E.

The Prior appears per Henricum de Stretford, whereupon the Barons Order a
search of the Rolls and Memoranda of the Exchequer, and thereupon it was found
in the Roll of 29 H. 3. sub Titulo de Auxilio ad primogenitam filiam Regis
maritandam, That the Prior stood charged with Ten pounds for ten Knights sees,
and in the great Roll 32. of the King Titulato Auxilium Episcoporum A^batum,

levanda quo prete^tu dictus Compotus de auxiliis praedictis fuit tam pro feodis
tenentium, tune Prioris loci praedicti quam pro feodis ipsius Prioris propriis,
quod idem Prior dicit posse liquere Curiae per Certificationem tune Prioris
loci praedicti tune Baronibus de S^^^cario.

From this Record I shall make these Observations:

1. That the Crown could not de ju^^ require any servi^ia from the Subject, but
those that were de^ita, omnes qui de Rege tenent per servicium militare, (and
none else,) Regi faciant anxilium ad primogenitam siliam maritandam, says the
King, Rot. Pat. 29 H. 3. m. 7. dorso, and so said the Law long before. Sunt
Bracton, (...) cap. 1^. sol. (...).
e^iam quaedam Communes praestationes qu^ servitia non dicuntur, nec de
con(...)tudine veniunt, etc. sicut sunt Hidagia, Corragia, and Carvagia, and
alia plura de necessitate and ex consensu Communi totius Regni introducta and
quae ad Dominum ^^^di non pertinent.

2. There is a difference appears between Servitia and Auxilia: The Law Rex
Angliae neque per se aut Ministros suos subsidia, aut alia quaevis onera
imponit Ligeis suis si^e assensu toti^s Regni sui in Parliamento suo expresso.
Fortescue de La^dibus Legum Angliae, cap. 36. pa. 84.
allows therefore the Priors plea, when he says, That those extraordinary Aides
were not Servitia but Auxilia, granted to the Crown per Magnates and
Communitatem Regni spontanea and mera voluntate, or as Bracton before cited,
Consens^ communi totius Regni.

3. Those Aides were given tam de tenentibus aliorum quam de tenentibus de
Domino Rege in Capite levanda, quo praetexta dictus Compotus de Auxiliis
praedictis were as well for the Fees of the Tenants of the then Prior, as for
the Fees of the Prior himself, which the Prior said would clearly appear to the
Court by the Certificate of the Prior, his Prodec^ssor, in the time of H. 3.
made to the Barons of the Exchequer, so that the Tenants of the Prior did grant
an Aid as well as the Prior himself, and that in Parliament, for as I have
observed before, Rot. Claus. 32 H. 3. m. 13. dor^o, there was a Parliament then
held.

4. That in the Reign of H. 3. and preceding times, when the Knights and
Freeholders, who held not of the King, but other Lords, did in the Commune
Concilium or Parliament, gra^^ (...) Au^^lium or Aid to the Crown, the great
Lord or Baron of the Fee, of who(...) the Freeholders held, was (...) in the
Exchequer to answer for (...) thereof, under the title of his (...), as the
Bishop of every (...), (...) till Queen Elizabeth's time, was by Law chargeable
for the coll(...), of (...) granted by the Clergy within his D^ocess, yet
certainly as the Bishop (...) (...) any power to give for, or tax his (...); no
more could or did any great Lord of the F^^^ither jure t(...), or (...)
t^tionis, charge or give away the (...) of his free T(...), who were
independent in (...) (...) (...) (...) solummodo (...); this P(...) not well
observed and understood (...) late Authors, has caused the (...) about the

5. (...) held of the King in Capite, yet very considerable in number, and all
the Citizens and Burgesses should, till 49 H. 3. either be totally excluded
from being any part of the Generale Concilium Regni or Parliament, or else by a
Law, of which there is not the least footsteps in History or Law, were for so
many Ages to be represented by the Tenants in Capite only in Parliament, the
transcendent Power of which Council in Conjunction with the King as Head
thereof Sir Thomas Smith, that great and learned man, who was Secretary and
Privy-Councellor to our famous Queen, an old Parliament Man, when he comes to
write of the Parliament, and its largeness of Power, says thus, In Comitiis
Parliamentariis posita est (...) (...). and A(...)inistratione Arglorum, Tho.
Smith, (...). 2. cap. 2. (...). 50. 51.
omnis Augustae absolutae que potestatis vis, quippe quemadmodum Robur and
virtus Angliae dieuntur in Acie residere Parliamentaria Comitia veteres leges
jubent esse irritas, novas indueunt, praesentibus juxta ac futuris modum
constituunt, jura and posse^siones hominum privatorum commutant, spurios
Natalibus restituunt, Cultum divinum sanctioribus corroborant, pondera and
mensuras variant -- incerti juris contrever^^as dirimunt, ubi nihil lege cautum
fuit, censum agunt, Capitationes and vectigalia indicunt, delictorum gratiam
faciunt, afflictas and Majorum sceleribus perditas familias erigunt, vitae
n^^isque potestatem in cos obtinent quos ad hujusmodi disquisitiones Princeps
advocaverat, atque ut concludam breviter, qui^quid in Centuriatis Comitiis, aut
in Tribunitiis Populus Romanus efficere potuisset, (...) omne in Comitiis
Anglicanis tanquam in Coetu Principem populumque represent ante commode
transigitur. Interesse enim in illo conventu omnes intelligimur ^uju^cunque
amplitudinis status aut dignitatis Princepsve aut Plebs fuerit, sive per se
ipsum hoc fiat, five per procuratorem, nam omnibus peraeque, gratum esse
oportet qu^^quid ex Senatusconsulto Parliamentario profectum est.

6. It is observable, that the Prescription of Progenitores Regis, in the
Record of the Prior of Coventry tempore E. 3. did expressly extend to the Reign
of H. 3. his great Grandfather It (...) were needful, I could give numbers of
Records, that prove the (...) tention of s^^h Prescription high(...).
and higher too, so that I had good authority and warrant to say before, that,
when the Burgesses of St. Albans, in the Parliament 8 E. 2. affirmed, That they
and their Predecessors sicu^ caeteri Burgenses de Regno, as the rest of the
Burgesses of the Kingdom had totis retroactis temporibus, in all times past, in
the time of F. 1. and Pregenitorum suorum, and of His Progenitors, sent Two
Burgesses to every Parliament, they had, as well as other Boroughs of England
sent Burgesses to the Generale Corailium, or Parliament before mentioned, in
the 17th year of King John, Grandfather to E. 1. at least, and so by clear
evidence before 49 H. 3.

From the aforesaid Authorities and Reasons, we may with good consequence
conclude.

1. That the People or Commons of England, from the time of the Norman
Conquest, till 49 H. 3. were not represented in the Commune Concilium, Regni or
Parliam^nt, by such only as held of the King in Cap^^e.

2. And that the Commons or People (...) (...) ^^^in to be represented by
Knights, Citizens, Burgesses, and Barons of the Cinque Ports in the said 40 H.
3.

And now I shall subjoin some material Records relating to my former Discour^^.

Willielmus Trussell Uicecomes dicti Comitatus in Compota suo de Anno 32. ipsius
Regis Henrici oneratus fuit inter alia debita quae debebat in fine ejusdem
Compoti sicut continetur in magno Rotulo de eodem Anno 32. and in rotulo 31.
ejusdem Regis Henrici compertum est etiam in quodam Rotulo Compotorum titulato
Auxilium Episcoporum Abbatum Priorum concessum ad sororem Regis Henrici

quindecim marcae de auxilio ad transfretationem Regis in Vasconiam and duodecim
marcae de auxilio ad sororem Regis maritand. De quibus quidem duobus debitis
Idem Prior postmodum Regi satisfecit sicut continetur in rotulis annalibus de
annis 36. 39. and 40. dicti Regis Henrici Tertii. Item compettum est in rotulo

videlicet pro servicio unius feodi viginti marcas continetur quod Willielmus
Herle and Robertus de Leicestr^ finem fecerunt cum Rege pro Priore de Coventr^
pro servicio duorum feodorum militum per quadraginta marcas. Et praedictus
Prior ad praedictas octabas Trinitatis venit ut prius per Attornatum suum

scrutinium Rotusorum inveniuntur ut supra and per ipsum Priorem auditis and
intellectis isdem servientes Regis petunt quod idem Prior super hoc respondeat,
etc.

Et praedictus Prior dicit quod ipse and (...) (...)
praedecessores sui tenuerunt ^mnia terras and tenementa sua tam videlicet ea
quae habet in dominico quam in servicio per servicium duorum feodorum militum
tantum. Et quod Dominus Rex seu Progenitores sin de aliquibus aliis serviciis

voluntate Regi concessa and tam de tenentibus aliorum quam de tenentibus de
Domino Rege in Capite levanda quo praetextu dictus compotus de auxiliis

feoffamento and de novo super quo certificatum fuit quod feoda quae dictus tunc
Prior tenuit in Dominico and feoda quae tenentes sui de ipso tenuerunt fuerunt
in toto december feoda, etc. Et petit judicium desicut ipse tenet omnia terras and
tenementa sua per servicium duorum feodor^ Militum tantum, nec sit compertum
hic penes Scaccarium quod Dominus Rex seu Progenitores sui de aliquibus aliis
seu plutibus serviciis per manus dicti Prioris seu Predecessorum suorum unquam

impetiri seu calumpnari debet in hac part. Et super hoc quia dicti servientes
