THE PROCESSION. A POEM.
ON Tuesday last in Dame's Street,
Such a Mob I chanced to meet;
As you, perhaps sometimes have seen,
Attending Thieves to Stephens-Green.
The ragged Guard that led the Van,
With loud Huzzas uncovered ran;
Not in respect to any there,
But 'cause they had no Hats to wear.
Such another Riff raff Crew,
Hell, (if too full) could never Spue?
Fellows whose Imprecating Throats,
Were still accustomed to these Notes.
Who want's a Light? Sir, Black your Shoos.
L^yd's New's Letter! New News, new News!
Then filled the Air with other sounds,
Some praised Squire T -- r, others F --
And others, D -- m their Bl -- d and W -- s,
The Church and King, one bawled aloud,
And straight was followed by the Crowd:
Down with the Whiggs! some others cried,
The Whiggs be Damned, the rest replied;
Then raising all their Voices higher,
T -- r and F -- s ran through the Quire:
Behind this Guard marched Two well dressed,
Mounted on Brutes above the rest;
Giving their Fellows some Advice,
Which I believe was not over wise.
The senceless Rout sucked in each Word,
As greedy as a Sow a T -- d.
After these Dons (the Knight and Squire,
Bespattered with much Mud and Mire)
An Heterogeneous Multitude,
Mobb-like Unciviliz'd and Rude;
Who either Jacks or Papists were,
Trotting along bro't up the Rear.
FINIS:
