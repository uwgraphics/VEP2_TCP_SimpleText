TO HIS WORTHY FRIEND MASTER WILLIAM ENGLEBERT ESQVIRE, HEALTH and Happiness.
SIR,
I Have read of an ancient custom used amongst the Heathens, that when they
brought their sacrifices into the Temple, they brought therewith all such
receipts of medicines for diseases, as they had found out by experience, and
there delivered them to be preserved for the perpetual benefit of their
posterity: their consciences persuading them that their Sacrifices would be
better accepted therefore, and that it was a wicked deed to let such knowledge
die with them, which might do so much good to others: as for the action, I
think so well of it, as I am minded to make it my pattern: and therefore desire
that under your patronage I may bring in my receipt, containing a medicine, no
doubt, for innumerable diseases; as taking away the fundamental cause thereof,
to wit, indigence: which by causing of the minds sadness produces
Melancholious blood and humors, the fountain of the diseases of these times;
the diseases thus caused kill by distance of time: cordials do but defer the
time: there is no approved medicine but this, in an over-peopled Commonwealth,
to wit, good improvements of the earth; which may be effected by the new
inventions contained in this Book: and there is nothing wanting but willing
minds to make this Country the Paradise of the World; if Gentlemen of
quality would be pleased to begin first, and to lay the corner Stone of this
building, all would follow without question: for that gain, the Loadstone of
the World, being laid a little open by practice, would draw the rest: there is
no cause that I know why they should be slack in it: there be a great number
of Parishes within my knowledge, and without question infinite more that I know
not, where the Landlord by laying out of his money upon these improvements may
gain double as much, as by purchasing of new Lands: also the Parsons Tithes of
many things may be doubled; and the inhabitants, though much increased, may
live better then before. If this be not a better cure for an over-peopled
Commonwealth, then to make violent incursions upon others territories, as is
too frequent, I refer the matter to all men's judgments: the whole world is
all of one Gods making, and no question is or should be one body Politic;
wherein to use Phlebotomie when there is no other means ready, is as foolish
as to do the same thing in Bodies natural, also there is no disparagement to
men of quality to take this work in hand: for many men of eminent dignity
have labored in these affairs, amongst which let Dioclesian the Emperor
serve for brevities sake in this place: who when he had resigned his Scepter,
could find no such pleasure and contentment in any thing, as he did in the
planting and grassing of trees, and in the Sowing, and Setting of profitable
Seeds: and surely it is a wonderful delectation to see that the earths
fatness (being the Treasure, and indeed the Fountain of all Treasure and
Riches in the World,) may be transformed into what form the Workman lists:
This Treasure is discovered more at large in the Chapter concerning the
fertilizing of Land: and is included plentifully, in every Element: viz. in the
Air, which is manifest in that the Camelion an Animal, and the Semper-vive a
Plant, can live and grow in magnitude and ponderositie without touching any
other Element: also in the Water by the infinite increase of Fishes: also in
the earth by the infinite and inexhaustible treasure which it produces
continually: only in the earth it is frequently miscompounded: the reasons are
declared at large in this Book: for it consists of a double nature, the one
Terrestrial, the other Celestial or Aethiriall: if either of these
predominate, then the earth is barren and brings forth nothing that is
beneficial: for if the Aethereall part be not of force and quantity
sufficient, by the heat of the Sun, to lift up the Terrestrial part, then
no fruit thereof springs. Again, if the Terrestrial part be not of force to
coagulate and harden the other into profitable fruits, then all is turned into
smoke, like the accustomed works of Alchymistes: all the skill consists in
the right compounding of these two substances, which in many places, may be
done with such facility as is wonderful: the reasons hereafter declared are
sufficient to turn Plow-men into Philosophers; and to make them to excel
their predecessors, even as a learned Physician excels an Empericke. For
though many notable improvements have been heretofore found out, yet they came
more by accident then by good grounds of reason: yet infinitely beneficial,
and therefore not to be despised: for he that found out the way of fertilizing
of Land with Lime or Marle, (though by accident) did a more charitable deed in
publishing thereof: then if he had built all the Hospitalls in England: for the
one feeds and cloatheth a few hungry and naked persons, the other enableth an
infinite number both to feed and clothe themselves and others: these things
have moved me to bestow much time and charges in these affairs; deeming my
attempt to be the most excellent that wit can be employed about; for that these
knowledges are more durable then common riches: and no Lawyer can make an
estate so indefesible as an approved and profitable experiment is: the reason
why I chose you to be my Patron, is your ripeness of Judgment in affairs of
this nature: you being a Gentleman that has spent threescore years time in
invention to do good to the State and Commonwealth: and that has accomplished
more profitable experiments then any man in these latter ages: if witness be
expected, let the noble and bountiful gift of Queen Elizabeth, for your full
accomplishment of your works projected and never accomplished formerly by any,
serve the turn: To conclude, my desire is, that you and all Readers would be
pleased to consider that my time being spent in practical experiments may well
deny me Scholasticall Oratorie: and therefore I desire no more of you, or of
any Reader, but that my good meaning may serve in stead of Ciceroes Oratorie,
to smooth over and dawbe up my imperfections that way: and that the pains and
charges being mine, and the profit being to redound to the Readers, if they be
so pleased, may serve in stead of Demosthenes his eloquence to persuade them to
take them thankfully: so I humbly take my leave this twentieth of November,
1638.

Your bounden servant, GABRIEL PLATTES.

CHPA. I. WHerein is manifestly showed the nature of the subject which we are
to work upon, viz. the terrestrial Globe consisting of earth and water: the
situation of it, and the second causes of its stabilitie. CHAP. II. Wherein is
plainly showed how workmen may be provided for the accomplishing of the
enterprise. CHAP. III. Wherein is manifestly showed, how tools and instruments
may be provided the most commodious way for the work. CHAP. IIII. Wherein is

industry of the said workmen. CHAP. V. Wherein is showed that the common way
in Husbandry at this time used, will produce in length of time, nothing but
poverty and beggerie. CHAP. VI. Wherein is showed that the new Inventions and
Improvements contained in this Book, will produce maintenance for all, though
they shall grow never so numerous; whereby the Frontispice of this Book is
cleared from imposture, in that it proclaims the treasure to be infinite.
CHAP. VII. Wherein is declared the manner how to make barren land fertile, and
that as the people increase, so by their industry their food may increase,
even as twenty Hives of Bees being all industrious, do live as well, as if

A DISCOVERY OF INFINITE TREAsure hidden since the worlds beginning, whereunto
all men, of what degree soever, are friendly invited to be sharers with the
Discourser G. P.
I Must needs confess that diverse of these inventions and improvements
contained in this Book, are not totally hidden from the world at this day: yet
in regard that some of them are only known to my self, others not generally
known, and all of them not practiced generally; but the profit thereof which
might accrue to the Common wealth, has hitherto been lost; I have been bold
to entitle the Book, A Discovery of infinite Treasure, etc. for that the intent
of the publishing thereof is, that all in general might receive benefit
thereby, and that they might be satisfied so fully before hand, that they might
join together with one consent to accomplish the work more speedily for the
general good of all that are present and alive; and also for the general good
of their posterity, whose happiness all men are bound to endeavor themselves
by their providence to further; though it should be some charges and labor
extraordinary: for by this means shall they show themselves to be more like
to the Creator of all things, who provideth forth all Ages, as well as for the
present time. If any one shall carpe at any thing contained in this Book; let
him be pleased to call to mind the old saying, viz. That a given Horse is not
to be looked in the mouth, especially when he has cost so dear to the giver.
I must needs confess that here is neither Style nor Composure answerable to
the worth of the subject: for which I crave pardon, in regard that my time has
been spent in action and practice, and not in the Schools. This Book is
published for those which through their debonere disposition will accept the
Authors good meaning, though it were but painted with a coal; and for such as
will take a little pains to spell and put together the same themselves, and
expound it to the best advantage for the general good for which it was
intended: to please all is a thing impossible, for that very reason it self,
which does, or at least should rule their pleasures, differs according to the
constitution of the bodies, and also according to the Climates wherein
reasonable creatures live; which because it may seem strange, I will
demonstrate by some few experiments amongst many. As for the Climate, the
opposition in the determination of diverse controversies, does sufficiently
testify: as for the final determinations of controversies in several
Climates differing one from another, it does manifest the other: for the first,
it is found that where a question arises, there every one disputes according
to his fancy, his constitution causing his will, and his will causing his
brains to invent, and forge arguments to make good that which he desires, be
it good or evil: as for the second, the Climate differing causes the Major
part of the Assembly to agree upon a determination which sorteth with the
constitutions of the bodies in that Climate: for more plain demonstration
hereof, let us observe first several determinations, in several Climates; of
the same question; secondly, let us observe several determinations in one and
the same Climate of the very same question: as for the first, the different
determinations betwixt us and the Southern Countries, about having many wives
or but one, shows, that the Climates being hotter or colder, do sway the
minds of the disputants: as for the second, the late law for the having of
only one wife, does demonstrate the coldness of the Climate, together with
the difficulty of acquiring of maintenance; both which sway the minds of the
disputants here; and as for riches, the things most desired, are they not
striven for according to the natural desire of the parties affected to them?
Is it not manifest that many wise and prudent men have despised multitude of
riches and honors; and other have affected the same most earnestly, and
accomplished them with much danger and difficulty; and these have thought one
another mad or foolish, for that they were of several opinions, caused by
their diverse constitutions which swayed their reasons with such violence, that
their judgments were hood-winked? And is it not manifest also, that many
mischievous contentions have risen between parties in the same Climate, and
between several Countries in diverse Climates, about frivolous questions,
where neither party has had truth on their side, though they both thought
they had it infallibly: like our hot Apocalypse men, and fierce expounders of
Daniel, who are sure, in their own conceit, that they have such divine
revelations, that they cannot possibly be deceived. Of this nature are the most
part of the deceptions in the world at this time; which are to be pitied rather
then punished, for that they differ from wicked intended deceptions; even as
between chance-medley and wilful murder: he that could undeceive the deceived
by laying open to him his folly, might do more good in the world then all the
laws hitherto made: for men would not go against reason rectified, unless it
were some few miscreants. As for my part, my will is good; but I have neither
much learning, neither am made fit for it by nature: for the writing of these
few lines has prejudiced me in my health, more than many years spent in
corporal practice: wherefore I desire all Scholars to endeavor to perform
my wants, and by their learning to fulfill my want of learning, and to study
to promote my good intents: for I can but show that I would say if I could
speak; and for their so doing their reward is ready: for I have known the
Tithes in one parish improved twenty pound per annum, in one Parsons age,
through his good persuasion to the people to be industrious in the planting and
grafting of fruit trees only: and then the whole parish must needs gain two
hundred pound per annum: and there being in England about ten thousand
parishes, it may be conjectured what benefit may accrue for the general good
of all the Land, viz. about ten thousand times two hundred pound per annum: and
also what benefit may accrue, if all my inventions and improvements shall be
generally put in practice, this being one of the least of very many: also their
honor, reputation and respect shall be doubled by furthering of this pious
work, whereby the working poor may be so well employed, that the impotent
poor will be easily maintained; and for my requital, I desire no more, but
that they will remember me and my posterity in their prayers for the heavenly
benediction: as for other gratuitie, I am not so necessitated as to make
begging letters, though I be not possessed of any great estate: for to deal
plainly and truly with the world, I know no imperfection in my self, but
that, if I were minded to acquire, govern, and conserve a great estate with
that trouble that some of my friends do undergo, I could have it; but not
making that my summum bonum, I am resolved, that unles it come with more ease,
I had rather be without it: and herein I challenge no immunitie from being
deceived like others; for my reason has deceived me so many times, that I will
trust it no more, unless it be confirmed and made manifest by experience; and
if many more were of my mind, I suppose that the world would be less fooled by
conceits and fancies, and would not be deluded so sottishly to strive and undo
themselves in the breaking of the general bond of peace. For particular
fancies, it is a strange thing to see the different dispositions of men, yet
all think they have good reason for what they do: as may be seen by the
laughing of Democritus, and the weeping of Heraclitus, at one and the same
object; and perhaps another spectator would have been angry at it; and a
fourth being of a great mind and a large sphere, would have marvelled that
rational men should be moved at all in their passions for such trivial
objects: and it is more strange to see men destroy one another by wars and
injuries for trivial fancies, and about matters of so small moment: it argues
a mean love to God, when men will kill their own kind, the wonderful
workmanship of Gods hands upon so slight grounds; it seems to me a very
feasible work to rid the world of those mischievous contentions: for now that
the Major part of the Princes are of good and peaceable dispositions; What were
it to join together so strongly, that their power should be irresistible, and
then the noise thereof would conquer the rest without Drums or Cannons; and
Hallelujahs would come in their place: but in this work the Scholars must
play their part, else all will be worse then it was before; for unles the world
be unhoodwinked and showed their follies every way, vices will abound by
prosperity, and love-sonnets and fables will come in the place of Hallelujahs
after a small time: for I must needs confess the truth, that at this time
nature is so depraved, that prosperity will cause destruction to the enjoyers
thereof, unless their judgments be so rectified, that they may do the same
things for love, that now they do for fear and want: for want is now the best
bridle to restrain vices, and therefore I have not endeavored to my uttermost
skill to bring plenty into the world upon a sudden; but that they may have some
sour sauce to their sweet meat, to keep them from surfeiting, yet is not the
industry now required any intolerable thing; for that many of these
improvements consist of skill more then of bodily labor; so that no man has
cause to complain, so long as his fare is bettered: yet, howsoever, I could
wish that this conclusion were put in practice, that experience might conclude
the question. For though rational discourses are subject to failings, yet they
give good aim to hit the mark; which was the cause that I, having a strong
love to knowledge, addicted my self so strongly to try experiments, judging
no knowledge perfect till it was thereby confirmed; yet I found that I
prospered best in those practices, wherein I did first profoundly dispute with
my self pro and contra, and was not partial, but objected and accused the
work as strongly, as if my enemy had done it; and when I was remiss in this,
I usually fared just like a suitor in law, who tells his Lawyer the fairest
part of his cause, and concealeth the worst of it, till at length he is
overthrown in his own suite; though his Lawyer were honest and learned. I
have sometimes marvelled at my own folly, in being carried with such a swinge
to do others good, that I have prejudiced my self much by it (...) my foolish
pity has many times caused me to be wittingly and willingly soothed, and to
part with my money, rather than to suffer another to be oppressed with extreme
want and misery; and this I did not merely for very charity; for it is a
double vice to make my self more honest then I am: for the chief cause was my
pronenesse to part with my money, being a thing I so little care for; finding a
delectation rather in laughing at the parties mistaking, in thinking he had
absolutely Tantalized me with hope of some great advantage, when God knows, I
never expected either gain or principal again. I know a man at this day of
no mean capacity, that having a good estate, but not yet very great, for whom
I dare swear, that he would not change estates with the King of Spain, whose
dominions are so large, that the Sun never sets in them; for before it go
down in his Western dominions, it rises in some part of his Eastern
dominions: these things I would have to be taken notice of, to the intent that
men's conceits should be weakened, and that less blood should be shed upon
slight grounds, that has been heretofore. If any one say that wars and
bloodshed are just, for that it is for the maintenance of Religion and Laws; I
answer, that the fancies of the people in many several climates, if not in all,
bore so great a sway, not only in the making and composing of the Laws and
several Religions, but also in the embracing and receiving of such as sorted
with their fancies; that it seems not to be convenient, that the general Law
of Nature should be violated for particular Laws; nor that the fundamental
points in Religion, which command general love to God and man, should be
neglected for particular differences. I am not sure how this enterprise, for
the bringing of the world into a regularitie and uniformitie, will prosper; for
it may prove to be a fancy as well as the rest: yet of all conclusions that
are yet to be tried, I have the best fancy to it; for that the Major part of
the world do so much desire it, and for the furtherance thereof, if it come to
a dead lift, I will try my cunning for some engines of War extraordinary,
which will make foul work with such miscreants as shall oppose so worthy a
work, and will cause them to be trampled upon even as the mire in the streets:
but to publish these were an execrable villainy, unless that a short war
might be sure to end all future quarrels. And what Prince soever shall first
engage himself in this enterprise, his honor is sure to be perpetual; for
that all tongues, both present and future, will testify his heroical and
noble nature; and all histories will record his fame to the worlds end; and
this honor will be surely his, whether the design hit or miss, for that he
meaned well howsoever.

But to speak according to my conscience purely, I think that in regard it is
a work of God and not of man, when the divine pleasure sees it sit, it will
be done by some weak means, whereby his glory shall be the more advanced; for
men are so apt to be arrogant, that God Almighty will scarce trust them with
such an honor. Now for that the old saying is true, That it is dangerous
meddling with edge tools, I will cease this discourse, as seeming somewhat
above my Sphere, and address my self to my plough again; wherein I shall be
sure to do good, or else no hurt; unless it be to lose my labor in taking
pains for unthankful persons; or else to overshoot my self, in striving to
bring in plenty and prosperity into the world too suddenly, before they have
learned to use it well, and to govern their fullness with moderation; wherein
I have not bin altogether remiss in my care, that the mutation might not be
too violent and expeditious. And as for Religion, does not a strong conceited
Papist, and a strange conceited Protestant, think one another to be mad, and
deluded by their fancies? and does not a Jew think the same by them both, and
does not a Turk think the like by all the three? and does not a learned Pagan
think the like by all the rest, being himself madder then any of them?
Amongst all Religions which I have perused and looked into, which are not a
few, I find that the Christian Religion does manifest it self to come from
God himself, by the good discipline thereof, and also by the admirable
consolation which it gives to men in adversity and affliction, and at the
very hour of death; thereby showing it self to be the very salve of God who
is all mercy and pity: yet I could wish that Christians should not be so
violent in mainteining it by bloodshed, as they are, but rather take another
way more powerful, and less prejudicial to the general good: also I could
wish that the rest would look into their follies, and not be so ready to break
the general bond of peace, and great Law of Nature, for their particular
fancies. For if any Scholar should take upon him to maintain by his Logic
that men might lawfully hate one another, if they should differ from them in
opinion; me thinks I durst undertake him, and would make no great doubt with
my small learning to involve him into an unavoidable absurdity; for if this
might be done, it would be concluded, that there might be less love in the
world then is at this present, which in my conceit is a thing that needs not:
for the law of Nature does complie with the general profit, which this
doctrine does thwart extraordinarily; thereby showing it self to be false and
frivolous.

And for a full demonstration of my meaning concerning the great Law of Nature:
I affirm it is that which forbids any man to do that thing, which is
prejudicial to the general good: which is more manifest in that every one
that does such things, does hide the same, either by doing it privily, or by
covering the same with pretenses: thereby showing that his conscience does
forbid him all the while he is in doing it, unless it be where the conscience
is not rightly informed: for then the Conscience stingeth not at all, as it is
manifest by the Pagans, who thought they did God good service in martyring of
the Christians; and also by the people who thought the like in killing the
Prophets, Apostles, and Christ himself.

For the Conscience is guided by the science; if the science be a conceited
fancy, then the Conscience is quiet; though it provoke men to do execrable
actions.

But how men should be so blinded to do things against the general good,
seems to me a strange thing; in regard that all Religions agree in this
point, that we are not to do that to another, which we would not have done to
our selves: Now who would have himself killed, or injured, for his private
opinion? therefore in my conceit, he ought not to do the same to another,
much less to destroy the wonderful workmanship of God for that it pleases
not his fancy.

If any man should make a pot, or a glass, or other whimsey; he would take it
ill if his inferior should break the same, for that it pleases not his
fancy.

Therefore why should he think that he can please God Almighty, in doing a
thing of the very like nature?

I have made this tedious digression, not for any great skill in Divinity that
I pretend to have; but to show to the world, that I am as others are, a little
troubled with my fantastical conceit; and wish, as others do, that all the
world were of my opinion: for then we would not for any particular opinion,
whatsoever, forgo the great prosperity and happiness, which peace would
bring us; but would break our swords, and instruments of War, into
Ploughshares, and other instruments of Husbandry; and would spend the charges
of Gunpowder, Shot, etc. in the building, repairing, and beautifying of
Churches; and turn the noise of Drums and Cannons, into Hallelujahs; and
would according to my natural pronenesse, try conclusion, whether Peace, or
War, were better.

Yet howsoever it comes to pass in the general, I would be glad that this
particular Kingdom, would be a little ruled by my fancy; which in this point
is not different from the vulgar, to whom every contrary opinion seems
frivolous, and ridiculous: as the opinion of those does to me, who contend for
trifles, and had rather forgo their future happiness, than lose an inch of
ground in standing out for their strong conceited opinions: yea, verily they
seem to me as ridiculous, and childish, as for Boys to fall together by the
ears, and tear one another clothes, and give one another bloody noses about
Cherry-stones, points, pinnes, and other trifles which they play for.

Wherein, I am just like the Inhabitants in China, who suppose that they have
two eyes, and all others have but one; therein manifesting their strong conceit
of their own wisdom; for that they think they know more than all the World
besides.

Yet I conceive my good meaning may bear me out in it; for that I conceiving
my self to see the Kingdom post away apace into poverty and want, am willing
to show my good will for the prevention of such a mischief.

And I am not wedded to my fancy so much, but that I wish every one to take
better counsel when he may have it, and in the mean time, to accept of mine,
rather than of worse.

And where good counsel is wanting, let every one tell himself the old fable
of Aesope, concerning the contention betwixt the members and the belly; and let
him set before him the success, of their discord; and also the happiness that
they had enjoyed by concord; and let it move them to join together for all
their profits; and let them think as I think, till they be better advised;
that there is more wit in that fable, then is in an hundred of our new fabulous
fancies, and strong conceited whimseyes.

And whereas the old saying is true, That need is the whetstone of wit; let us
be wiser than our Predecessors, and whet our wits with the thought of it; and
study to prevent need before it comes: for that the prevention of a disease
is better than the cure afterward.

And let us not make so great a difference between providence and prudence as
some do; and if either be preferred, let providence go before: so will
prudence be less troubled when he comes to do his duty; and less
repentance will serve, when a vice has been stayed before it be actually
committed.

And let me not totally destroy fancy, for that it is cause of much good
sometimes: for Birds would not take so much care and pains to feed their
young ones, but that every one thinks his own little one to be the fairest:
and I would not have spent so much money, labor, and time; but to fulfill my
fancy.

For I have as small reason to do it as any man in England, having received
many wrongs and injuries, by diverse persons whom I freely forgive; and desire
God Almighty to do the like: for it was not they that did it, but that wicked
root Covetousness, which got possession of their hearts: with whom I can never
be reconciled; but have vowed the ruin thereof, and cannot be stayed with any
persuasion whatsoever.

And having tried diverse ways to accomplish my enterprise, can find none, but
to choke, suffocate, and make it to surfeit to death with the food that it
most loves.

And it is a strange thing to see that I cannot rule my passion, but to run
headlong upon it; though I see plainly, that pride and luxury are like to grow
in the room of it.

And that I shall be just like to a Tinker that stops one hole and makes
two greater; and were it not for fear of this mischief; I would declare
something that here shall be omitted.

For I would be loath to be so bad a Physician, as to have no more care in the
Composition of my medicine, but that the hot ingredients thereof should cure an
Ague, by putting the patient into a Fever being a more dangerous disease.

Amongst all my Observations in the works of nature, I could never find so
exquisite a Model or resemblance of a well ordered and flourishing
Commonwealth, as is an hive of Bees; who in these two principal points do so
far excel men, that they may well go to School to them: for first they are
all industrious, and suffer no drones to remain amongst them, and by this
means their well living is no whit diminished by growing numerous: Secondly,
they are all bent to work for the general good, which is manifestly seen by
this one remarkable point: for when any one has fortune to find out a pot or
vessel of honey, he does not like men eat it all up himself; but forthwith
he goes home and tells his fellows whom he guides to the treasure which he
has found: and there they work with one consent, till they have carried it to
their own hives if they be not let by force: I being schooled by this
commendable example, have published this Discovery, which must needs prove some
huge Creature, for that it has been threescore and fourteen years between
the conception and the birth: this treasure consists of improvements in
Husbandry; whereof the least is inestimable and infinite, for that thereby so
many lives present and future are maintained; these partly by a Book given me
by one of my Ancestors, containing all the remarkable observations for fifty
years of the weather: the plenty and scarcity: the cheapnesse and
dearness: with all accidental occurrences, and the natural causes of the
same; and partly by my own observations and experiments for the space of 24
years, I have by the blessing of God found out, which if I should conceal,
and not publish, I conceive that I did commit as execrable a villainy, and as
much defile my conscience, as if I should see a number of men in danger of
drowning, and should not lend them my hand to help them: if any one shall
calumniate these improvements with the name of innovations; let him be pleased
to remember himself, that such innovations as these have been accustomed in
all ancient times, as the people grew more and more numerous, to be put in
practice: for three several times the people growing too numerous for their
maintenance, God has given understanding to men to improve the earth in such a
wonderful manner, that it was able to maintain double the number, and so he
that made mouths, sent meat by teaching them understanding how to get it: for
when there were but few, they were maintained by Fish, Foul, Venison, and
Fruits; freely provided by Nature: but when they grew too numerous for that
food, they found out the Spade and used industry to augment their food by their
endeavors: then they growing too numerous again, were compelled to use the
plough, the chiefest of all engines, and happily found out: whereby all
Commonwealths have ever since been maintained, and at length this invention
would not serve the turn neither without new skill in the using of it: for at
the first they used to till the Land till the fatness thereof was spent, and
so to let it lie a long time to gather fatness again of it self; and in the
mean time to till fresh Land: but when they grew too numerous for the food
gotten that way, they were compelled to find out the fallowing and manuring of
Land: by which invention the Land recovered more fatness in one year, then
before in many years; and so a Country would maintain double the number of
people more then before: now the people are grown numerous again, requiring
new improvements which are discovered in this little Book, and shall be showed
by irrefragable demonstration, and infallible experience; also it shall be made
manifest, that by the Common course of Husbandry used at this day, the
barrenness does by little and little increase, and the fertility decrease
every year more and more, which in regard that the people do increase
wonderfully, must needs at length produce an horrible mischief, and cause the
Commonwealth to be oppressed with provertie and beggary.

When as by these new inventions and improvements being industriously
practiced, their wealth shall not be diminished, but contrary ways wonderfully
increased, though the people shall grow wonderfully numerous.

And this business is not to be slightly thought upon, for so much as
Husbandry is the very nerve and sinew, which holds together all the joints of
a Monarchy.

Neither is Invention to be lightly regarded: for all workmanship without
invention, resolves it self into the workmans belly, as may be manifestly
seen: for before the plough was invented, and before Horses, Oxen, and cattle
were taught to do the works which men did before, all their labor came to
nothing, but only to fill the belly; but since that time, by the benefit of
these and other inventions, we see what Castles have been built in time of
Wars, and what Churches in time of Peace, what famous Towns, Cities, and
Schools, and other things conducible for the Common good: also, by this means
men were spared from servile labors, that they might attain to knowledge to
be Statesmen, Clergy men, Lawyers, Physicians, Merchants, Tradesmen, etc.
without which no Commonwealth can subsist.

And for so much as the new world called America, does for the present give
aid and succor for the maintenance of the surplusage of people increased in
those Countries; yet in regard that the finding of new worlds, is not like to
be a perpetual trade; it seems to agree with providence, to beg in to
improve the Lands formerly peopled, in such manner that by their industry there
may be raised maintenance for double the number.

Which to perform is no hard task, in regard that all treasure and riches are
nothing but congealed vapors: for what is corn, and fruits, the chiefest of
all riches, but the fatness of the earth; Jacobs blessing elevated by the
heat of the Sun, and turned into vapor by the help of the Universal
spirit of the world, then drawn together by the Adamantine virtue of the
Seeds, and Plants, and so congealed into the same form? and what is Silk,
Velvet, fine Clothes, etc. but the vapors of Animalls congealed in the
superficies of their bodies, where the Animal heat was able to elevate them
no further? and if any man will hazard a wager upon it, I will undertake to
show by irrefragable demonstration and experience, the great Test and only
trial whereby truth is distinguished from imposture; That Gold that great
Commander, is nothing else but the said fatness of the earth, elevated by the
said universal spirit, and after depuration congealed into that splendorous
Body.

Yet I would be loath that this should animate men to spend their goods this
way as many have done; Therefore I will them to understand, that though I
affirm the Art of Gold making to be true, yet I do not affirm it to be
lucrous in these times.

For the difference oft-times may make a gainful art to be not gainefull: for
when an Earldom, or Province was morgaged for a thousand Marks, as we find
in credible Histories they were; then gold making might be a profitable
Science, and yet nothing worth in these times, when as one Farm will buy a
thousand Marks.

By this means, the wise and godly men which have written of this Art, are
cleared of aspersions, and impostures; for that they were no Prophets to
foretell these mutations of times.

Now seeing that all treasures are nothing but congealed vapors, there rests
nothing to be done for the performing of my undertaking, but to show the Art of
doing the work, and then the treasure is discovered according to the
Frontispiece of this book: which work is plainly made manifest in these
ensuing lines. And whereas all men are invited to be sharers, it concercerneth
me to show how they shall receive benefit thereby; which thus I make good.

Though the Husbandman carry away the greatest share, as they are most worthy;
yet part comes to the poor workmen for their employments; and part to the
Clergy by the improvements of their Tithes; and part to the Gentry by the
improvement of their Lands and Rents; and the King has no cause to doubt his
part to come short: for if the subjects shall be rich, they will be ready, both
with purse and person, to defend and offend upon all occasions: even as a man
having good store of treasure, being assaulted by thieves, will fight more
valiantly then he that has nothing to lose: and then they will not pay their
money with such grudging as now they do; for that a little preserves a great
deal: and as for the Kings honor, it will be then as much more excellent then
now, by reason of the hearty affection of the honourer; as a piece of true
gold differs from a counterfeit piece.

Also the Tradesmen whom it least concerns, shall be sharers too; for when
there is such store of good employments in the Country; the Cities will not be
so overcharged with multitude of Tradesmen; and more then that, they will have
greater dealings, and better employment.

Also the impotent poor; as old, lame, blind; also fatherless, strangers,
widows, prisoners, and succourlesse people will have share: for then their
number will be but very few, in comparison of what is now: also charity will
increase together with ability.

I dare undertake to show a way how the working poor may be employed in these
new improvements, in such manner that they may live twice as well as they do
now; and yet notwithstanding, there may issue out of the benefit of their
labors, sufficient maintenance for the impotent poor, and all others above
mentioned.

Which work will be almost as charibable and good, as if I should build an
Alms house in every Parish, and give perpetual maintenance to the same.

And of all sharers mine own part will be the least, for I am like to be a
loser by the bargain in my wealth; only I shall die with a more quiet
conscience, which is better then wealth: for my knowledge how to get wealth,
will be confounded by this new alteration; for by my long and diligent
observations in these affairs, I am grown able to discern and foresee the
scarcity, and unavoidable dearness of many things before every vulgar
person; by which means I could easily raise to my self, and to my posterity,
more wealth then can any way accrue to me by the publishing of these my
Inventions and Improvements, which will cause such a mutation, that all my
former observations will stand me in little stead for such a purpose; yet that
all succeeding Ages shall know, that once a man did change so great wealth for
a quiet conscience; I will proceed to the uttermost of my skill, to make all my
knowledge to be every man's, and to forgo my own gain, for the benefit of
many.

And though here will be little found in this Book, but what every
understanding man knows to be true; yet I hope I shall perform sundry good
offices: for to some I shall be but a remembrancer of what they knevv before,
but forgot to practice it: to some I shall be as a Midwife, who though she
neither conceives, nor bears the child: yet performs a good office in
facilitating the birth of it: to some I shall help to bring to ripeness
certain seeds of knowledge, planted in their hearts by the Finger of God in
their creation.

And as for my own Inventions and experiments, I would be loath, that having
pretended to give men so much wealth and treasure, I should bring any man into
loss and damage of that which he had before. Therefore in regard that no
certain rule can be given for so variable a work; I wish that every man may
try the truth in a fevv Perches of Land; and when he has found out his fit
seed, his fit composition of manure, his fit depth of planting and setting, and
has discovered all inconveniences, and knows how to avoid them; then to go
to work in greater quantities.

For we see that though all riches are nothing but congealed vapors, yet the
air in Spain and hot Countries, is apt to be congealed into some manner of
riches, and the air in these Northern Countries is apt to be congealed into
other manner of riches: also the vapors arising out of Clay ground are apt for
some things, and the vapors of sandy ground are apt for other things, and all
ground is fit for some use or other: for God and Nature made nothing in vain,
and therefore the saying being found true, non omnis fert omnia tellus, it is
not so ridiculous a thing as the world does repute it, for men sometimes to try
conclusions: for if people did not increase; I confess that then the old ways
were best and surest: but in regard that new numbers grow daily, therefore it
behooveth us to have new inventions and improvements, whereby they may live by
their industry and not by shifts and unjust devices as now they are forced to
use.

For though the new Plantations were happily found, and have disburdened these
Countries of (...) extreme surplusage of people; yet we see by experience,
that they are as it were squeesed out by force of poverty and want, and most
of them try all their shifts before their departure, which causes such store
of shifts to be put in practice as are now used, whereas by honest industry they
might help themselves, being set in a good way, with as much less trouble to
their minds, as their industry would bring trouble to their bodies.

And one of the principal Motives which moved me to put out this Book, was a
grief of mind to see some indifferent well disposed persons, to lie and shift
even as a thief that steals a Sheep for very hunger: with whom I have
conferred about it, and found that they could get no convenient employment, at
least answerable to their nature and education.

Wherefore my study has been to find out inventions of several natures;
whereof some of them consist of skill, as much as upon bodily labor; whereby
men and women of good birth may without disgrace acquire their livings.

Now, for so much as it is plain that need causes shifts, and also it is as
plain, that the saying is true in Philosophy, sublata causa tollitur effectus:
I will sum up my Book into one gross sum and conclude; that if I take
away need, the shifts will be gone.

Wherein I will put my self upon the great Test, viz. experience, whereupon my
dross will be burned away, and nothing but Gold will remain; for that Test
suffers no imposture.

And I make no question, but there will be found some dross, yet if the
greater part prove to be Gold, my request is, that all Readers will play the
Refiners; and if they find more Gold then dross, then I am Gold Oar at the
least, which is Mine Royal, though not so pure Gold as I desire to be.

And so I end my preamble, thinking the time as long as the Readers till I be
at work, and show my skill in performing my undertaking in form following.

And my first work shall be to divide my Book into twelve Chapters, for the
ease of the Readers minds, in regard that their bodies are to be employed in
the enterprise more then their minds, following the example of former
inventors, who discharged that part: for Solomon, and all other Wisemen never
bore their disciples in hand with miracles, but evermore stirred them up to
industry, showing that it was accustomed that God Almighty did perform his
providence usually by teaching men understanding to acquire their livings by
industry, and seldom rained Manna, or fed them miraculously.

CHAP. I. Wherein is manifestly showed the nature of the subject which we are
to work upon, viz. the terrestrial Globe consisting of earth and water: the
situation of it, and the second causes of its stabilitie.
THE Terrestrial Globe composed of Earth and Water, being the Subject which we
are to work upon, is nothing else but the grossness and residence of the
Elements, the womb of all seeds and plants, which we are to make use of in
oiur new husbandry, wonderfully placed in the middle of the vaste element of
Air, not by the power only of the mighty Creator: but also by his wisdom
and exquisite artifice: for the Magneticke virtue betwixt it and the celestial
Orbs, is so exquisitely proportioned, in number, weight, and measure; that no
side is over-matched with virtue attractive or expulsive; therefore it abides
in the middle of the universe, with as great stability, as if it had a
supporter, such a one as our understanding is capable of: if men could observe
proportion, they might frame a kind of module thereof, by hanging a bullet of
iron covered with clay, in the middle of a Spear, beset about with Loadstones
of equal virtue attractive: but I conceive time may be better spent, in
admiring the wonderful power, wisdom, and exquisite artifice of the mighty
Creator, and also in letting this glorious Fabric of the universe be to us
all, the universal Preacher of Divinity, to teach us to adore and love the
Creator thereof: in which divine worship, I could desire that there might be a
new invention or improvement in two respects: First, as the common way used is,
to bow the knee of the body; so the new way should be to bow the knee of the
heart: and as the common way now used is, to be every one for himself, so the
new way should be, to be for the general good of every one: if the last of
these be not performed, the first cannot: for it is unpossible that he can
honor and love God aright, which does not love all his brethren whom God has
created upon the face of the earth; and if he love them; he will work for the
general good of them all, which if he do not, then his love is fained, and
his Religion is vanity.

And had I eloquence or learning, I would press this point with all my force:
for that all the inventions and improvements in this book, are not to be
compared to this one for excellency; neither is there any great hope that the
rest will succeed well, if this do not precede: for suppose that men for mere
lucre should be industrious in this new husbandry; yet if they omit these two
first new inventions, they may well fear the success; for that they have left
the prime Workman out of the field, to wit, God Almighty, without whose
blessing all is vanity and lost labor: whereas on the other side, if they
shall first learn these two new inventions in the service of God and love to
men, (by which, and by no other way then by working for the general good, the
sincerity thereof can possibly be discerned) then will they all with one
consent work cheerfully in this new husbandry, and the chiefest happiness of
all will be; that then God Almighty will bless their labors, by sending the
former and the latter rain in due season, whereby their harvest shall be
doubled in quantity: for moderate rain fatneth the earth, but too much or too
little causes barrenness; as may be seen by this last years success where
the want of a little rain presently after the Spring seed time, hindered this
kingdom above the value of an hundred Subsidies, and also one flood coming by
immoderate rain, did as all floods usually do, viz. carry in the belly of the
water into the Sea, as much fatness as would produce here in England the value
of one hundred Subsidies more.

By which passages, we may see how little it is to purpose to strive against
the stream, viz. to think by our own industry alone, without the heavenly
benediction, to prosper in our labors.

Therefore let us, having the pith and substance of Religion, practice the same
sincerely, and so address our selves to our work, leaving the particular
differences in Religion, to the disputations and determinations of Schools,
and in so doing both we and the Schools shall fare the better for it.

And for the more powerful cheering up of all men to these two duties, let us
consider well of the wonderful power of God accompanied with his admirable
wisdom and exquisite Artifice in the establishing of the Sea in his place,
which is not by virtue of the Sea banks as it is in fresh rivers, as vulgar
people do imagine, though the Sea banks do somewhat restrain the great
liberty that the Sea would have: yet is the sea heaped up into a sphericall
form round like a Ball, by the attractive and expulsive virtues of both the
celestial orbs, and the terrestrial orb, wherein the one virtue does not
over-match the other at all, save only that the Moon chief governesse thereof,
does a little oversway the rest cooperating with her, but withal giving her
the predominancy; whereby she causes the tides to ebb and flow as we see:
which work though it seem great in the narrow Seas, yet in the maine Ocean,
it is scarce perceptible, but even as it were the rolling of a Bullet, so very
little, that the spectators perceive it not to be rolled at all.

Which heaping up of the Sea is manifestly seen by this demonstration: let a
Ship go out from the Shore, and about ten miles distance the sphericall form
of the Sea will hide from your sight, standing on the Shore all the while,
about fifty foot of her, and also he that in the Ship takes notice of this
thing, will find that as he departs from the Shore, so if he will be still
desirous to see the Shore, he will be forced to climb up the Mast higher and
higher, as the Ship goes further from the Shore, until at length he cannot
see the Land at all, by reason of the sphericall Compass of the water, though
he climb up to the top of the Mast.

Whereby it appears plainly, that the Sea acquireth his deepnesse, as well by
this heaping of it self together above the earth, as by concaving it self in
the earth.

For if a straight line should be drawn from the Sea banks at Mexico to the
Sea banks in the Eastern coasts, and the measure of the depth of the water in
the middle of the Ocean to that line, should likewise be taken, it would be
found that if the Guider and Preserver of this Universe should be remiss never
so little, and suffer the water to sink flat like the fresh rivers, we should
be all drowned in an instant.

Which wonder produces to me another wonder almost as great, which is, that
rational men should be so stupid as not to stand in awe of God the mighty
Creator, who with one frown is able to destroy them all so easily, or should
go about to dissemble so with him (who knows all things) with their
complementall service and honor to him, for either they must needs go about
to cosen him, or else they must according to his will love all creatures which
he has created, which love must needs be fained, unless it be manifested by
working for the general good of them all, and not only of all that are
created, but of those which shall come afterward.

And if any shall be found remiss or refractory in wishing well to these
proceedings, appearing so evidently to be for the general good of all the
inhabitants upon this terrestrial Globe, or shall use any indirect means by
depopulating towns or dwelling houses, or by unjust making wars whereby the
people shall be decreased: it being so manifestly showed, that there is no such
need, but that there is sufficient maintenance to be had for them, though they
shall increase and grow never so numerous: These men of which sort I have heard
of, now hitherto do demonstrate to God and the world their ignoble nature, and
their beastiall swinish and viperous dispositions.

CHAP. II. Wherein is plainly showed how workmen may be provided for the
accomplishing of the enterprise.
AS for workmen for this business, I make no question but that all working
poor will be ready upon the first summons to come to work, if so be they may
receive maintenance for the same, which now they want extremely; which I would
advise all Landlords to disburse, in regard that they shall receive an
improvement in their rents, of far more value then the money disbursed would
yield by purchase of new lands; yet in regard that these are not sufficient, I
could wish that many others might be employed which might best be spared in the
commonwealth; of which sort are liars, shifters, and deceivers of others, and
which do now eat the bread of other men's labors by their subtilties; but in
regard we are to make use of their bodies for labor, therefore their conquest
is fit to be accomplished by stratagem, which is a difficult work to deceive
the deceiver: I have studied much to find out an Invention how to effect this
enterprise, and find, that as receivers make thieves; so temerarious believers
make liars: and to redress this mischief, I have sometimes thought it the
best way to believe no man: whereupon, this inavoidable inconvenience followed;
that many times we should reject the truth as well as lies and deceit: for I
find that truth spoken plainly, does echo in the mind of the hearers, saying
the same things over again: but this is the mischief, that so few hearers
have understanding to judge which is true, and which is false: for where the
hearers want ability to judge, there lies and deceit make the same echo, which
truth does in the former: so while these persons can find any shallow brained
believers, there is small hope that we shall win them to be laborers in our
new husbandry: therefore amongst all stratagems to win the field of them, I
find none like unto my first invention contained in the first Chapter, viz. to
bow the knee of the heart in the room of the usual bowing of the knee of the
body: and withal, to be humble petitioners to the donor of wisdom, and
understanding, to send the light of truth, and the knowledge of truth into the
world plentifully: then do these persons become suitors to be admitted to be
workmen in our new husbandry, being defeated in their former trades: so shall
we have workmen enough to accomplish our enterprise for the present time; and
as for the future, there will be such an exquisite proceeding, that it will be
as difficult a thing to discern whether the people increasing cause the
fertility to increase; or whether the fertility increasing cause the people
to increase; as it is for a Philosopher to find out by argumentation whether
the egg or the bird was first. For the numerous increase of people diminishes
not their maintenance so long as they are all industrious, no more then twenty
hives of Bees are impoverished more then if there were but one in the same
garden, so long as they are all industrious, and suffer no drones to live among
them.

But because that in the mean time some shall reap benefit by avoiding these
deceivers; I will show a political invention how to find out their knaverie,
which is thus made manifest: even as he that has good gold to sell, will go
to the most expert Goldsmithsr, efiners, or say Masters, and will by that
means get the best price: but contrariwise, he that has counterfeit metal
will go to those, which are more ignorant (fearing the greatest) and there make
their markets: even so he that has a good project, and truth on his side, will
go with it to the most able men of judgment; wherers the deceivers will go
to those of the weakest judgment, there by winning facility to deceive:
therefore the safest way is for every man to doubt his own judgment; and not
to be too rash in giving credence, till the greattest experience, has
determined the doubt.

CHAP. III. Wherein is manifestly showed, how tools and instruments may be
provided the most commodious way for the work.
AS for Tools and Instruments, though they be made of two materials chiefly,
to wit, wood, and iron; yet is wood the chief thing to be provided for, in
regard that without it, no iron can be provided; for I find by experience,
that all attempts to make iron with Seacoale or other coals, are vanity: for
though it may be melted that way, yet the good metallicall quality of the iron
is destroyed, or at least the greatest part of it; for I find by experience an
Arsenicall or Antimoniall quality in all subterraneall substances combustible,
both which are poisons to iron.

Now the multitude of Timber brought yearly from Norway, and other parts, do
plainly demonstrate the scarcity thereof here: also it may be conjectured what
a miserable case the Kingdom will be plunged into about an Age or two hence,
for want of Timber.

There is a Law in Spain, that he that cutteth down a tree, shall plant three
young ones for it; and by this means there are builded in two Provinces, both
not so great as Yorkshire, twenty Ships yearly, and yet the wood increases:
If this Law were observed here, how happy would it be for the posterity? the
charge is little, there is nothing wanting but one of my first inventions; to
wit, love manifested, by working for the general good; not only of all that
are now alive; but also of those that shall come after. And I see no reason why
Landlords should not contract with their tenants; to put this work in practice
diligently; for then their rents will be more and more improved every year:
and if this be omitted, their rents will be diminished in future time.

Now, for the improvement of this work; I would have all Timber trees planted
in hedgerowes, and by this means no ground will be lost: but all woods and
thornie grounds may be turned into fruitful fields and pastures, and are apt
to be made fertile by my new inventions: besides, the planting of the Timber
trees in hedgerowes, brings a double commodity; for they are not only an
help to divide the land of industrious persons, from the land of the idle,
that every one may enjoy the fruit of his own labors; but also they will be
notable shelter for the Cattle in Winter, to preserve them from cold storms;
and no less commodious, to keep them from the heat of Summer.

And if any one shall object against the multitude of ground lost by
hedgerowes; let him remember himself, that every hedge gains ten times his
proportion of land; for that the Cattle in hot weather are thereby shrouded;
which else would destroy more with their feet, then they eat with their
mouths, by their gadding, and running up and down, whereby that every Beast
eats with five mouths: also they lose more fatness in one hot day, then
they gain in three cool days; which is a thing to be considered upon.

And I dare undertake to extract more riches by ten times unto the ground where
any tree grows out of an hedgerow, then it will be worth when it comes to be
a tree fit for use; therefore I advise all men, to kill many Birds with one
boult; for in the hedgerowes a tree spreads, fenceth, sheltereth, shadoweth,
and increases in magnitude altogether.

And there is no question, but the Tenants will be better able to live, and pay
their rents, when they have neither houseboote, ploughboote, nor fire boot to
buy; according to the old phrase in ancient Evidences; but have all in their
own grounds, as they had in ancient time, before this improvident husbandry
was used: for now? Husbandmen are turned prodigals, wasting all in their own
time, without care or providence for their posterity.

And as in Cities, their rents are improved only by the multitude of chambers,
and rooms in the Houses to be let; because that there the rents are only
given, for the conveniencie of habitation: so in the Country, on the contrary,
the habitation being least regarded, the rents are raised out of the
improvements of the land; which if it be well stored with timber trees, and
fruit trees, brings no little benefit to both Landlord and Tenant.

Therefore seeing that if Timber trees should be planted thick in form of a
Wood; there would be more loss in the land before the trees come to
perfection, then the trees would be worth; considering the length of time, and
also how the land might be improved in the mean time: therefore I would have
all trees planted in hedgerowes, for the reasons heretofore mentioned.

Also, I have known an Orchard of ten Acres of ground, which might have been
so improved otherwise, that it would have maintained a family of ten persons;
if all the trees had been transplanted into the hedgerowes, according to the
practice used in Worcester, and Herefordshires, and in diverse places beyond the
Seas. And if this practice was once generally used, there would be no more
danger of stealing, then there is of wheat, or of grapes; or of these fruits
where this practice is general through the Country.

Now for this purpose, it behooveth every Farmer to have a little Nurcery,
where to sow, or set Acornes, Ash-keyes, Hawes, Plumber-stones, Chery-stones,
kernels of Apples, Pears, and all manner of fruits fit for his Climate. And
for new Invention let him choose the best fruits; For Nature suffers her
Elements to be congealed into good fruits, as gladly as into bad.

Also, when he sets his small trees, at the first, let him ram down the
earth sad below, and lighter toward the superficies; that so the roots may
have a better fabric, and may spread, through all the points of the Compass,
or the more of them the better, though not all; and may not point downwards,
toward the barren earth, but spread in the rich mould, the better to draw
nutriment.

And when any man would plant twenty fruit trees, let him set forty
kernels; and when he sees how they prove, he may choose the kindly ones, and
throw away the other; and not cumber the grounds with them.

And let him choose neither those that have very long joints, nor those that
have very short ones, but the middle sort; for the long joynted plants are apt
to spend themselves into leaves, and branches; and the short joynted ones will
be but dwarfe-trees.

And let him choose his grafts precisely; for he shall be sure to find the
Proverb true in this work, viz. Such a Mother, such a daughter.

Whereas diverse attempts have been made for the preserving of fruits form
falling in the Spring time, and have not taken that good effect which was hoped
for; I will declare my experience therein, by laying open the cause thereof
more plainly, then ever I could find written in any book, or discoursed of
by any man in all my travels.

And first, I find the cause thereof to be double; the one by frosts in May,
the other by reason that the Trees are repleat with a more flegmaticke, and
waterish juice then is convenient.

To redress the first, let there be made an earthen pot, like a little Still,
to be hanged with a coard in every tree, in frosty nights; half a pecke of
small coals, which will cost but an halfe-peny, will give an air all night,
if the pot be covered with a tile, and some wet hay be laid upon it.

And some years, two or three nights will be sufficient; some years there
will need none at all: the way to know when it will freeze, may be found by the
weather-glasse, described in the Chapter of the Sheep.

To redress the other inconvenience, I must discourse a little more largely of
the cause; first it is found by experience, that those Trees which were barren
the former year, do not so easily let their fruits fall with frosts, as the
other; the reason is, because those Trees got a more solid juice by their
barrenness; for the Suns heat, in the former year, exhaled and drove out
the more flegmaticke juice, and so left the trees better furnished with more
firm nutriment for the next year; that being the principal component in all
things natural; and being wanting, no fruit prospers: for as is declared in
diverse places of the book; all fruits are compounded of a double substance,
the one terrestrial, and the other aethereall, and for the most part, the want
of the terrestrial part causes ill success.

Now to help this evil, it is found by experience, that when a Tree has
been blown down with the wind, and has been lifted up again, and covered
with new earth; that Tree has been more fruitful by much, then ever it was
before; the reason is, that while it stood firm without altering the earth, it
had sucked all the solid juice which lay within its reach, and could get no
more.

Therefore it is very good sometimes to change the earth about the principal
roots; and if any roots grow right downward into the barren earth, then to
cut them off.

So shall you have fruits in scarce years, when others have none; in such a
year, one bushel of fruits is worth a great number in other years, when
Nature is so friendly, as to prosper them every where; whether industry be used
or not.

CHAP. IIII. Wherein is showed how food, and maintenance for the workmen may be
provided, by the industry of the said workmen.
AS for maintenance for the workmen, I see no reason why the Landlords should
be remiss in providing the same; in regard that the money laid out upon the
improoving of their own lands, will yield a far greater annual revenew, then
twice so much money laid out in the purchasing of new lands. And I see no
reason why Tenants at will, Tenants for term of life, or for a short term of
years, should be industrious, when as the benefit of their labors, is to fall
into other men's purses; unless there be a Contract between the Landlord and
Teuant; whereby a just share may redound to both parties answerable to their
merit: which it this were done, then would the Husbandmen be much stirred up to
try experiments; and if they should but spend their spare times in these
works, there is no question, but that many fat veins of marle, chalk,
limestone, and other earth, would be discovered in many places which now lie
hidden, and do no good at all.

Also, the Common wealth would be furnished with Timber trees in such manner,
that the wealth thereof would not be so exhausted as it is; and is more like to
be in future time, by importation of Timber from other Countries.

Also, it would be furnished with fruit trees, which is a wonderful
commodity, in time of dearth and scarcity; for before this last year, it
has never happened that Corn and Fruits have both failed in one year; but
even when Corn was scarce and dear, then fruits were plentiful, which
produced Perry and Cider in great plenty; so that the Country received great
relief, not only for their drink, but also for their food: and this I can
witness for the space of threescore and fourteen years, partly by mine own
experiences and partly by my book of fifty years observations.

CHAP. V. Wherein is showed that the common way in Husbandry at this time
used, will produce in length of time, nothing but poverty, and beggerie.
AS for the Common way and practice in Husbandry used at this day, all men of
good understanding do know, that it produces every year barrenness more and
more; and in the end, will produce nothing but poverty and beggerie: but
whether the same may be redressed by new Inventions and Improvements, is a
thing much doubted, and indeed, the question cannot be determined by any other
way, then by experience, which admits no imposture: for every Husbandman
knows, that sheep being fed upon the Commons, and carried with their full
bellies into the Folds upon the arable land, do impoverish the one ground, to
fatten the other; whereby it comes to pass, that one Acre of land enclosed,
is better then four Acres of the same in Common: whereby it is plain, that
three parts of four, of all Commons are utterly lost: also the destruction of
Timber, and the neglect of the increase thereof; also the neglect of several
other works plainly declared in this book.

Also, they know that the Land floods do carry away the fatness from the
arable land, and all high grounds, in huge quantity into the Sea; which is
further manifested, by the leaving of some small part thereof in the meadows,
whereby they are enriched: also the further manifestation of this truth is
seen by Nilus in Egypt, the Granarie of the World: where they have no more
fertility then the water brings yearly in his belly in certain months,
during its overflowing of the ground; in whose residence left behind, they use
to sow their seed, and have incredible increase; and the greater the
overflowing is, the greater is their plenty; which they can discern by
certain pillars marked with several marks, which the height of the water
touching higher or lower, does demonstrate aforehand the quantity of the
ensuing plenty.

Which residence of the water, if it had happened in a Country where it had not
been taken notice of, nor the nutrimentall virtue thereof bin extracted
yearly by sowing of Corn, or other things; there is no question but that it
would have become a fat vein of marle, able to have fertilized other land: for
I could never apprehend any other reason of the veins of marle, but that the
water left that fat mussilage in former times: whose fatness has not bin
exhausted since by any industry; and the same reason, I conceive, is the
cause, why limestone and chalk does fatten ground; only here is the
difference, that the limestone and chalk are covered with more common earth,
and are placed so, that the subterraneall vapors do more impregnate them, and
indurate them into an hard mass; so that they do stand in need of fire to
unlose their firm compaction, whereby they may yield their nutrimentall
virtue: and where any of these substances shall be discovered, there they are
to be accounted as hidden Treasure found, for that they are far more worth
then aany Gold or Silver mine; being not only infinite, and not to be
exhausted by time: but also the profit thereof not to be diminished through the
multitude of Sharers; which inconvenience all other Treasures are subject unto;
which is the reason that Husbandry is holden the most honest and conscionable
life in the world, and the supporter of all the rest; which being compared with
it, are nothing but toys and trifles; neither considerable almost at all, in
respect of Husbandry which supporteth the World; whereby it appears, that any
new Invention or Improvement in Husbandry is inestimable; for that so many
lives are thereby sustained.

CHAP. VI. Wherein is showed that the new inventions and improvements contained
in this Book, will produce maintenance for all, though they shall grow never
so numerous; whereby the Frontispice of this Book is cleared from imposture,
in that it proclaims the treasure to be infinite.
AS for the remedy for the avoiding of the increase of barrenness, and
decrease of fertility, caused by the accustomed manner of Husbandry now used;
the whole tenor of this Book does manifestly show: as by these particulars
here under written does more plainly appear, wherein I submit my self to the
Readers judgment, not only for the annual profit which will accrue to the
Commonwealth: when the said new inventions and improvemens shall be brought to
full perfection; but also in the mean time for the setting of poor people to
work in the most apt places, to receive the benefit of these new inventions;
for I know a thousand places in England, where an hundred pounds laid out, will
bring in an hundred pounds per annum, with convenient industry perpetually to
the worlds end.

In such places as these I would have my new inventions and improvements put in
practice at the first, and afterward according to the old saying, Let him that
comes last, fetch his water the furthest.

The annual profit of the timber trees after one age, will amount to

The annual profit of the fruit trees after half an age, will be

The annual profit of the woody and thornie grounds, being turned into
fruitful fields and pastures, will be

The annual profit of the new meadow ground, caused by the watering and
fatting thereof by the Persian wheels, will be

The annual profit of the Mossie and Ant hilly grounds, being made double of
value by these new improvements will be

The annual profit of the third part of all the arable ground in England,
which may be turned into pasture, and hey ground, in regard that the two third
parts are sufficient to produce as much corn as all do now, will be

The Annual profits of the Commons enclosed, in regard that every acre then
will be as good as four acres are now, will be worth

The Annual profit of the Seed saved in setting, more then is spent in sowing,
being nine parts in ten, will be worth

The Annual profit of the more increase upon every acre by setting then by
sowing the Common way, will be worth

The Annual profit of the Orchards being improved after that the trees shall
be transplanted into the hedgerowes will he worth

The Annual profit of the Seed corn steeped in fat water and candied with
Lime, and so set or sown in grounds so remote from the Farmers houses, that it
will not quite the cost to carry manure so far will be worth

The Annual profits of the uncertain grounds, and such as through their evil
temperament do often fail being brought to certainty, and made not subject
to fail by mixing them one with another, will be worth

The profit of the corn preserved from blasting and milldewe, and of the Sheep
preserved from rotting, will be once in seven years worth

CHAP. VII. Wherein is declared the manner how to make barren land fertile* and
that as the people increase, so by their industry their food may increase, even
as twenty Hives of Bees being all industrious do live as well, as if there were
but one in the same garden.
AS for the making of barren Land fertile, I find that it may be done by as
many several ways, as medicines are made for the diseases of men and beasts,
and that the work requires as great judgment: for sometimes the ground is
over fat, and will bear nothing, as we may see in many places, where it is so
fat that it will burn, and there the cure is to cut up a part thereof into
turfes, and when they are dried to set them on fire, and so to strew the ashes
amongst the rest, to bring it to a temperament.

For I find a double fatness in every compounded Body, the one combustible,
the other incombustible: the combustible fatness causes vegetation by its
rarifying and vaporing quality, when it feels the heat of the Sun; the
incombustible or fixed fatness causes to agulation of the said vapors by
heat of the Sun likewise by its adstringent quality, and of these two
fatness, are all riches and treasures engendered.

The property of the incombustible fatness is to sink in water, and the
property of the other is to swim upon the Water, and that ground which
abounds with the combustible fatness is apt for such Seeds and Plants as
require a combustible fatness.

And as every compounded Body abounds more or less with either of these
fatnesses; so it sinketh or swimmeth in water the more eagerly: whereby one
general opinion is manifestly found false by experience, which is, that the
lightness of a thing causes it to swim, and the heaviness causes it to
sink.

And thus I demonstrate it: if you cast the body of a Nut tree which is
combustible into the water, it will swim: but if you cast in the shells of the
Nuts, which are lighter quantity for quantity, and less combustible, they
will sink.

And for a more full demonstration of this position take this experiment
following: gold is the most incombustible substance in the world, and therefore
sinketh most eagerly: which may thus quickly be tried; let a twenty shillings
piece of gold be weighed against his Brass weight, then let the scales sink
an inch or two into a Basin of water, and you shall find the Gold heavier in
the water by about ten grains: because that the combustible fatness in the
Brass inclines more to swimming then the Gold, that contains almost none of
that kind of fatness: by this experiment the truth of my position is proved:
besides, that any man may by this knowledge discover a counterfeit piece of
Gold almost as well as a Refiner, if he do it exquisitely: for if two pieces of
Gold both of one weight, the one true, the other false, be thus let sink into
the water, the one will overweigh the other, and the basnesse may be discerned
by the number of grains differing, without refining it, or defacing it at all:
Also hereby Alchymists may learn, if needs they will be meddling, to lay aside
their Balderdash compositions and illiterate operations in things not
congruent, but much discordant for their purpose.

But I could wish they would totally leave off the practice for their own
good, unless it be such as do it for their pleasure, for they that aim only
at profit run a very desperate hazard.

For not one in a thousand of the seekers find that they seek: besides that I
do more then three quarters know that the Art is not so lucrous as they do
imagine.

For I know that the Art is true: also I know no infirmity by my self, why I
should not improve it to be lucrous as well as an other, if it were so feasible
a work to be done as is imagined.

Besides, that the late Writers leaving so many Papers behind them, shows
plainly, that they had a desire to leave a fame behind them of their
knowledge: but if the Art had been so lucrous as some imagine. I suppose that
they would have left some memorable acts behind them which would have
confirmed the truth of their Papers.

This digression I have made from my matter, to get some inventive brains to
spend their study and labor with me in my new Husbandry, and do verily
assure my self that those that refuse my Counsel will repent it.

Now to proceed according to my intended purpose; I will first declare diverse
experiments which I have seen in the fertilizing of land, and the causes
thereof, as fully as I could discover them: wherein I challenge no immunitie
from being sometimes mistaken, no more then others that have written of these
hidden and profound matters; and make no question, but that when the light of
truth and perfect knowledge, shall abound in the world, that then both they and
I, in something shall be found fools upon record.

Yet as a Physician cannot attain knowledge to cure all diseases, yet has not
lost all his labor, for that he has attained skill to cure many; so my
glimmering light in these matters, is better then none at all.

I have known a load of Pigeons dung fetched sixteen miles, and a load of
Coals gven for it; which in the soil where it was fetched, would have done
more hurt then good, for the manuring of land; yet where it was carried, it did
as much good for the fertilizing of land, as double the charges; which might
have been effected as well by a composition of lime and common dung putrified
together; the proportion being found by a few trialls in small quantity;
whereby nine parts in ten of the charge might have been saved.

For there is no difference of dungs, but as the incombustible astringent
fatness does overmatch, or is over-matched by the combustible; so it is more
or less apt for a cold, or an hot ground: whereby I conceive, that in the
soil where the Pigeons dung was fetched, the incombustible astringent
fatness did predominate; and in the soil where it was carried, the
combustible fatness did predominate; so that in one soil the Pigeons dung
cured the barrenness, in the other it poisoned the fertility.

I have also known many hundred loades of earth sold for twelve pence a load,
being dug out of a meadow near to Hampton Court, which were carried three
or four miles to the higher grounds, and fertilized those grounds wonderfully,
and recompensed the labor and charges very well; which earth being laid upon
arable land, within a furlong of the same meadow, did more hurt then good; the
reason can be no other, but that the earth dug in the meadow did abound with
the incombustible fatness, being the residence of the water, whose property
is to carry in his belly that kind of fatness, and to leave it in such places
where the slow motion gave it leave; whereby it had a property to fertilize
the higher grounds, abounding with the contrary fatness, and to poison the
lower grounds, being overcharged with the same fatness before.

I have also known stiff clay grounds that would seldom be fruitful, unless
the season of the year proved very prosperous, to have bin cured by laying
thereupon a great quantity of light sandy ground; which afterward was
converted to a good temperament, like to the sort of ground, commonly called,
Hasell ground, which seldom or never fails to be fruitful.

I have known also light sandy ground, which was good for little or nothing,
cured by laying thereon a great quantity of stiff clay ground, which
converted it to good temperament; where by it became fruitful, and not subject
to fail upon every light occasion as it did before, but would abide variety
of weather according to the nature of Hasell ground.

And this Improvement is of no little value, for there is a great difference
betwixt land that is subject to fail once in two or three years, and land
thus improved that will not fail once in two or three and twenty years,
through the distemperature of the weather.

And there would be many improvements of this nature put in practice, if there
were a law, that every Tenant, if he were put out, should recover double his
charges of the succeeding Tenant; which may also be done by a Contract between
the Landlord and the Tenant, if all would agree; and then men would labor
cherefully, as for their posterity, if they were sure that another should not
reap where they have sowed.

And if men should but spend their spare time in planting, graffing, and
improving their land, which now they loose; judging it as good to play, as to
work for another; it would make an excellent mutation in Husbandry in an age
or two, and very profitable for the general good of the posterity.

For all men have a natural pronenesse to work for their posterity, if they
might be secured how they should not be frustrated in their expectation; and
the very bane of Husbandry at this day, is the incertaintie of their terms;
as may be seen in Ireland at this time; where having a little more security
then in former times, they are more industrious, and live better then in former
times, when there was not half so many in number.

Now to return to my matter: I have known a wonderful damage in the
North-Countrey, in the pasture grounds, by their growing with moss, which I
have cured sometimes with ashes: and sometimes that cure failed, by reason that
the nature of the ground altered; and then I mixed lime with dung, and
putrified it together first, and then laid it upon such barren mossie ground,
and cured it.

And a worse damage then this, I found by Mole-hils, which were increased much
in magnitude by Ants commonly called Pismires, which I could never remedy by
any other means, but by digging them into four parts, and then paring away
the earth, and laying the ground level with the grass upwards, then the Ants
died, or fled away, being a creature that cannot abide moisture; therefore they
raise their hills high from the moisture, and thereby damage their Landlords
extremely; afterward with a great bush of thorns, I harrowed the loose earth
even with an Horse; whereby it was much improved, and maintained almost double
the number of cattle which it did before.

I have also known certain Acres of land taken out of a barren Common, which
in a few years has become worth four times so much of the rest that lay in
Common: whereby it is manifest, that three parts of four, of all Commons, are
lost for want of Husbandry; and to remedy this loss, there is no means but to
enclose the said Commons, and then there is no question, but if the Sheep and
Cattle which feed upon them, do spend their dung upon them, and also be
foddered upon them in the Winter time, that the dung bred by the hey coming
out of the meadows, which are fatted by the land-flouds, or by the Persian
Wheels; a new Invention profitable to be practiced here in England: that then
they will increase in fertility every year more and more, until they be as
good as the Pastures, which appear evidently to have bin taken out of them in
former times.

For the Commons are impoverished two ways by the accustomed ill Husbandry;
the first is by driving the Sheep from them with their full bellies, into the
folds upon the arable land, whereby the one ground is impoverished to fatten
and enrich the other: the second is by keeping them so bare, by reason that
there is no stent of Cattle; so that a great part of the fatness does
evaporate by the scorching heat of the Sun into air, and so is joined with
the common air, for want of sufficient receptacles to take that benefit.

For the chief skill in Husbandry is but to plant receptacles for the
terrestrial vapors which are seeds and plants: which is manifestly seen, for
that a thousand plants or trees will grow upon one Farm, as freely as one.

But this work of enclosure will never take effect, unless the said
enclosures be laid to the Farmers houses only; in regard that they only have
had that little profit of them which hitherto has bin raised.

For none else have reaped any thing from them hitherto; for that the Gentries
Cattle are usually greater then those barren grounds will maintain, and the
poor have few Cattle to put upon them.

Now whereas this work must be done by the consent of all parties interessed
in them; else it is like it will never be done: let us consider how all parties
may be gainers by the work, which will cause consent, or else nothing will
cause it: for if it be laid by indifferent proportions to the Farmers houses,
then will the Gentry gain by the improvements of their rents; and the Clergy
by the improvements of their Tithes: both which hitherto have gained little or
nothing; and the poor will gain by their employments in the said
improvements, which employments they now want: yet I could wish that in every
Parish where Commons are enclosed, a corner might be laid to the poor men's
houses, that every one might keep a Cow, or for the maintenance of his family;
and the rather, for that they are the best servants to the Commonwealth: for
how could the fields be reaped, or the corn thrashed, or other works of like
nature be done, if these were wanting.

Now it is requisite to show some invention for the improvement of the hay
grounds: which will be much advantage for the fertilizing of the high barren
grounds, by foddering the Cattle there in the Winter time. And for this
purpose there cannot be a better way then that used in Persia and Spain, by
water wheels of thirty or forty foot high, with wooden bottels which do
fill in the river, and empty themselves above into a trough of wood, and so is
carried to those grounds where the Land floods never come to flatten them, and
by this means the Meadow grounds for Hay may be doubled in many places, not
only in quantity, but also in quality.

For I have known in England, where Hay ground worth but ten shillings an Acre
yearly, has been improved by means of this nature, that it has borne Hay in
such plenty, that it together with the latter crop has raised ten pounds upon
an Acre: but this was in a dry Summer when Hay was very dear and scarce, and
therefore is not perpetual, but yet a sufficient gain may be always hereby
gotten: I know a man not far from London, that by laying out three hundred
shillings, improved his Land three hundred pounds per Annum by watering it
only, by raising the water with dammes of earth, so that it might at his
pleasure overflow his barren grounds, which profit might still be doubled by
this invention of the Persian wheels: whereby the water might be raised so
high, that it would overflow the barren grounds higher, and broader then before
by the half; and this water, if it come from Chalkie, or Limestone grounds, or
be colored with Land-stouds, does fatten the ground wonderfully.

Of these Wheels there is to be seen in Persia, two or three hundred in a
River, whereby their grounds are improved extraordinarily; and I see no reason
but that good use may be made of them here in England.

And though this increase of fodder will be very conducible for the manuring of
the high grounds, whereby they may gather fertility, by having the Sheep and
Cattle foddered upon them in the Winter time, whereby they shall not only
receive the benefit of the dung bred upon them, but also of this new
Meadow-ground; yet my meaning is not totally to take away the use of the
Sheepfold upon the arable land; for in the great Corn Countries where the
Sheep are kept in the fields; there they do good in keeping the fields bare,
although they be folded in the night; and in the other Countries where there is
not much Tillage, I would have all men to endeavor to make as much use of my
ensuing experiments as they can possibly, with convenience; which will raise
manure enough in most places, to serve their turn, so that they will not need
to use the Sheepe-fold, whereby by one ground is so much impoverished to in
rich the other; and where there is no remedy, there they may drive the Sheep
to the fold out of the new enclosures, as well as now out of the Commons in the
Summer time: but then the fertility of their new enclosures will increase much
more slowly then otherwise, if the Sheep and Cattle shall manure them both in
Summer and Winter.

I must needs confess that the dung of Sheep is a very temperate manure for
much Corn ground, and is not so hot as Lime, Pigeons dung, or Poultrey dung;
nor on the other side, so cold as Cow dung, or Ox dung, and therefore to
supply the place of it, there is required a composition of lime and dung
together, which the proportion being found, and being laid interchangeably in
leeres in a dunghill, and so let lie a certain space to putrify and rot
together, will supply the room of the Sheep manure most excellently.

Also in places convenient, I would have Ponds made to receive the water of
Land-flouds, which once a year will yield great store of good manure, but the
best will be where the Land-flouds come from fertile fields, and from Towns:
but especially from Market Towns whose streets are paved.

Also within the Tide work, I would have sluices in all your ditches that fence
in your grounds, where the water may be let in swiftly, and after it has
settled clear, then let it out very slowly, and it will leave a fat residence
behind it; for it is certain, that all the fat veins of Marle were left by the
water in former times, by its slow departure from such places; for it is
manifest that all these varieties of earths have bin caused in former times by
the various motion of the water, as may be seen by the difference between the
earths fatness in several places upon the Sea coast; for in Devonshire the
Sea leaves a sand so fat, that they carry it many miles on Horseback to
manure land withal; and where it is laid, the fertility is increased
wonderfully: but how these fat veins of Marle came to be laid in their places,
is much controverted; some think by Noah's Flood; others hold, that all Land
has once bin Sea, and will be Sea again by turns in length of time; which
opinion is not so frivolous as it seems at the first show; for we see that
the Sea does continually get Land in one place, and loose Land in another, and
of that earth which the Sea carries in his belly, it leaves the fattest part
thereof in such places, where it goes out with the slowest motion; which may
be seen by experience in Rivers; for where the water runs swiftly, it
carries with it the whole body of the earth, and as the motion grows slower,
it leaves it again: first, the heavy gravel is left; next, the plain earth
is left; and lastly, when it comes to an exceeding slow motion, or still
standing, there it leaves his fatness.

But whether all the Land has been Sea, I make some question: but it is
certain that a great part thereof has been Sea: for pieces of Ships and
Anchors have bin found in Germany two hundred miles from the Sea, being covered
with earth by the motion of the water: also diverse Shells and other things have
been found in England far distant from the Sea: also the Hills and Dales upon
the Land, do show plainly the work of the water, even as the Claw of a Bear,
or a Lion, does show by his print that a Bear or a Lion has been in such a
place.

I have tried to putrify water by it self, and also with helps, and do find
that it may be done even as milk by help of rennet is curded into cheese; a
thing that no man would believe, but that experience shows it to be true; but
as yet I have not brought the experiment to full perfection, and therefore as
yet I will respit the publishing thereof: some experience hereof may be seen
in the Moats and standing Pooles which yield great store of good Manure, and I
wish that they were more made use of.

For I have seen much oversight committed by many Husbandmen, in letting out
the putrified and colored water from their Moats and dunghill Pooles, to the
intent that the Manure in the bottom might be the sooner dried in Summer, and
fit for carriage to their Land; whereas all the water that was high colored,
might have been improved in such frugall manner by a little industry, that it
would have produced such an increase of so much Barley, as would have made as
much good drink for the Husband man's provision, as the colored water which
was lost.

And in this manner I would have it ordered: in the heat of Summer when the
Sun has exhaled a great part of it, and that it grows thickish and fat;
then reserve a good pit full thereof, well bottomed with Clay, that will hold
water, and at Seed time steep your Seed Corn in it, but put the fat water to
it, by little and little as it drinks it up: that at the last it may be
almost dry of it self: but before it be full dry, sift a small quantity of
Lime amongst it, that so it may grow dry with the Lime, and be like Comfits:
then with this Seed Sow or Set your most remote ground from your Dung-hills,
and by this means, you will save ten times as much labor in carriage of your
dung, so far as this labor comes too, and as for your crop, though you
shall not have so much increase as some have Mountebanklike reported of it, yet
you shall have a good material increase for one crop only, and corn thus
ordered is not subject to be devoured of fowls when it is new sown.

The like infusion may be made with Lees of Wine, Ale, Beer, Perry, Sider:
also with Beefe-Broth, and the Brine of powdring Tubbs, and all such liquors as
contain any fatness, and these liquors are best mixed diverse sorts together
where they may be had.

And I have sometimes spritted the Corn a little as they use to do for Malt,
and then have sown it, and it came up speedily, and got the predomination of
the weeds at first, and so kept the same: whereby I had far greater increase
then ordinary.

Also I found sometimes when a dry season came upon the sowing, that my Corn
thus ordered took root far better then other men's Corn: who would not take this
small pains to steep it and sprit it.

Now for the residue of your colored fat water, it may be carried in great
Tuns as the Salt-petermen carry their liquors: and therein having diverse holes,
you may water your arable Land that lies next to your houses: also you may get
good quantity of old Thatch or Straw, and spread it on the ground by the
Pondside in the heat of Summer, and ever at spare times as you see it dry,
water it with a Scoope, but not so much, as that any shall run away, and
continue this work till all the fat water be dried upon it: then lay it on
round heaps and let it rot into dust: this dust is little inferior to
Pigeons dung for the manuring of Land, especially, if you have dried great
quantity of the fat water upon it.

And I would have your Moats and standing Pooles so placed, that all the Urine
and fat moisture of your Stables, beast-houses, Kitchins, and other houses of
Office may descend unto it.

By these several means aforesaid, you may double your quantity of manure
every year, and so consequently the increase of your crops, if good heed be
taken that none of your colored fat water pass away: for there is a
wonderful fatning virtue in that part of the Manure, which is the most apt to
dissolve, and to color the water.

And this fat Musselage being so apt to be carried in the belly of the Water at
Land-floods, has caused the valleys to be so fat and fertile, and the high
ground to be so barren.

Yet we see by manifest experience, that there is a remedy by industry to cure
the barrenness of the high grounds, for if we observe it well, we shall find
that the Farmers dwelling in barren soiles, are generally richer by their
industry, then those that dwell in the fatter soiles.

Now for so much as there is so great a difference of the nature of Land, and
also there is so great variety of the weather in these insulary Countries:
there can be no absolute rule prescribed to hit the bird in the eye, in the
composition of Manure for all sorts of grounds and weathers.

Therefore every one is to make use of his own experience, sometimes in small
quantities, whereby many excellent and profitable experiments may be discovered.

And for his better furtherance to hit the mark, I will here set, down, as
plainly as I can, the causes of barrenness in this kind, which I find to be
these: when the combustible fatness does much predominate in any earth, as it
does usually in the higher grounds; and the reason is, because that the water
is prone to carry the incombustible fatness in his belly from the higher
grounds, and to leave the same upon the lower and more level grounds, and
therefore that ground requires Cow or Ox dung, which is combustible, to
bring it to a good temperament; likewise the higher grounds require Lime,
Ashes, Chalk, Pigeonsdung, and Poultry dung, to bring them to a good
temperament: for these two fatnesses are of different nature, yet nothing
increases without them, both mixed, for it is the nature of the combustible
fatness to grow soft, to rarifie and turn into a vapor by the heat of the
Sun; and of the incombustible fatness to harden and coagulate by the heat
of the Sun, and by these two contrary qualities all riches are engendered.

Wherefore as Actuarius, the Physician summeth up all his Art in one line in
these words: In omni affectione morhosa con^rar^s est pugnandum: So I sum my
Art as briefly, viz. that every cure in Husbandry is to be performed by mixing
the Land with a composition of Manure, contrary to that which causes its
barrenness.

And oftentimes this labor may be saved by choosing apt Seeds, and Plants: for
some soiles which will not bear one thing at all, yet are very fertile in
bearing another.

And this is the reason that the old saying is true, Non omnis fert
omniatellus: For where the Seed or Plant requires a greater part of the one of
the fatnesses more then the other, there that Seed or Plant prospers, where
the congruent fatness does predominate, which by its Magnetique virtue it is
prone to draw to it; to increase his like according to the great Magna Charta
or Grand-law of nature: whereas diverse other Seeds or Plants, would not prosper
at all in such ground.

Whereby it is plain, that as the various temperament of earths do require
various Seeds and Plants: so they do require various compositions of Manure,
to bring them to a temperament: which compositions can never be found out, but
by practice and trial of sundry conclusions upon small quantities of Land, at
the first, with sundry compositions, as to mix Lime with dung in several
proportions with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. or more to one, as occasion shall require, and
when the true proportion is found, then to proceed in greater works.

And I hold it good, that no Lime be laid upon the high ground, before it be
quenched with some small quantity of Ox or Cow dung: for by this means the
Land-floods are not so apt to wash it away: for the Lime of it self is very
apt to turn into Mussilage with water, and so to be carried away.

Now to show how these inventions and improvements are able to change the
former practices in Husbandry, in such manner, that the fertility may now
perpetually increase, contrary to the former practice, whereby it yearly and
hourly decreased; I will contract my experiments into a lesser room, whereby
the memory of the Readers shall be less charged.

And first it is manifest, that the Hay coming by the fatning and watering of
the barren Land adjoining to the Meadows, by the Persian wheels, produces
dung to fatten the high barren grounds by foddering the Sheep and cattle
therewith in the Winter time: whereby one barren ground is made so fertile that
it fatneth another.

Also the Mussilage of water now gotten by Land-floods which before was lost
and carried into the Sea, does help much for the same purpose.

Also the benefit of Moats and standing Ponds more then before, whereof great
quantity may be by industry produced, does much help likewise for the said
purpose.

Also the new increase of Wood will make better provision of Lime then
heretofore, which will be infinitely conducible to the said purpose.

Also the Art of putrefying of Water, not as yet brought to full perfection,
the best and most expeditious way will do much good for the said purpose: for
though it be as yet a thing not fully perfected, yet it is not totally in the
air, for I can do it already, but not in such exquisite manner for expedition
in great quantity, as I mean to do before I publish it.

And for present satisfaction, let all men know that the fatness which is
loathest to sink in water, is the most noble fatness of all other, and not
inferior to Pigeons dung: for the reason why it is so loath to sink, is
because of its excellent temperament, being compounded of both the contrary
fatnesses formerly spoken of; so that the combustible fatness in it being
joined with the incombustible, causes it to be so loath to sink.

Now if all these new Inventions for the provision of manure shall double the
former quantity, as by indifferent industry it is very possible they may; then
will the fertility be likewise doubled; and so consequently the same quantity
of land being thus improved, will maintain double the number of people.

For it is a strange thing to see how little a quantity of land, will
maintain a family of people, being industriously improved.

Of which experience, none can better bear witness then my self, whose
Predecessors, though generously descended, lived well upon a small Farm; and
by their industry, maintained, and educated their children, in manner not much
inferior to the sons of the best Knights and Gentlemen in the Country.

And it is certain, that there is sufficient fatness of both kinds in every
Country, to bring all the Land to a good temperament and fertility; though it
is discretion at the first, in such places where it may be done with the least
labor and charges; for though the water carry the fatness from the Land into
the Sea in never so great quantity, yet the Sea casts it forth again in
some place or other; whereby it may by industry be recovered covered in such
places, and new mixed by the found judgment of the Husbandmen.

For though I can scarcely believe that all Land has bin Sea, viz. the great
East and West Countries, yet it appears evidently, that the greatest part of
those great Countries have bin Sea, and also that these insulary Countries have
bin Sea totally.

For it is impossible that the water in the Deluge should in so short a time,
make so great an alteration upon the Terrestrial Globe, as is manifest it
has, by these ensuing demonstrations.

First, it appears in the West-part of England, that though the waters in the
Deluge might bring that multitude of Firre-trees which are there found in the
earth; yet it could not possibly cover them so deep with earth, in so short a
time; it being found by experience, that where the water casts out earth, and
heightneth the earth to get it self a Concave; there it does that work by
little and little, in long time.

Secondly, it appears in the East-part of England in the Fennes, by shells,
Anchors, and other things frequently found, that that ground has bin Sea in
former time; and the multitude of earth laid upon those things, could not be
done in so short a time.

Thirdly, it appears that all England has bin Sea; by the hills, and dales,
and unevenness of the ground: being evidently graven by the water, whose
property is to wear the ground deepest, in such places where the earth is
most loose, as it is in all valleys; and to spare it most, in all rockie and
firm grounds, of which sort the Mountains are.

And this is more manifest by the Rivers which grind themselves a passage into
the Sea through the loosest earth, which is cause that they run so crooked.

And this all Fishers and watermen can tell, for that they find the water
deepest in the loosest earth; and ebbest where it is most compacted and firm:
for Mountains and Valleys at land, are depths and shallowes at Sea.

Which thing considered together with the special compass of the Sea,
acquiring his deepenesse by its elevation, more then by graving it self an
hollow concavitie to abide in, does show that there is no such impossibility
for the Sea to alter his place according to the motion of the fixed celestial
Orbs, which some think to be chiefly through the slow motion of the fixed
stars, and that it will make his revolution upon the earth, in such time as
the fixed stars make their revolution in the Heavens; both which motions are
so slow, that they are not taken notice of by men of vulgar capacity; and
though this thing be not generally received for truth; yet it accords with
reason and possibility, as well as any opinion hitherto broched.

And the reason of this my relation is to good purpose, for by this means men
may more easily find out the fat veins of Marle, and know how to mix their
ground in such sort, that it may be brought to a fertile temperament where the
water has left it in an evil temperament; and for their furtherance, they may
make balls of earth, of several sorts, and burn them in the fire, and by
their lightning in their weight in the burning, they may get some light how to
mix them, to bring them to a good temperament.

And I see no reason why Landlords should be remiss in these trialls; for
where a Lordship is discovered to have several earths, the one able to bring
the other to a fertile temperament, there the rents will be wonderfully
advanced.

Neither do I see that men should be remiss in this work, because that in
length of time, all their land thus improved will become Sea: for the motion is
so slow, that all estates are changed before there can be any material
alteration; it being found by Mathematicians, that the fixed stars make not
their revolutions in less time then thirty six thousand years.

And the reason why the earth is more compact and firm in one place then in
another, can be no other then this; for that the subterraneall vapors do
impregnate it, and tie it together more firmly in one place then in another;
whereof some of them are so strong, as to turn it into rocks of stone; some
able to glue it together like firm earth; some so weak, that the water is
able to dig it, and carry it in its belly, to such places where the slow motion
thereof gives it leave to sink.

And these are all the reasons that ever I could conceive why the Sea is so
various in its deepenesse, and also why the Land is so uneven with Mountains
and Valleys; being so wrought to that unevenness by the water in former times:
and I could wish that men should not think their labor overmuch in these
works; for that the riches this way gotten, are more durable then other
riches; for that they are not gotten by the prejudice of others; which is
manifested by diverse examples; wherein the one is found to continue to many
posterities; the other to rust and grangrene in short time into nothing.

CHAP. VIII. Wherein is showed, how to prevent the blasting of Corn, and that
the cause thereof does not come through thunder and lightning, according to the
common opinion, but through the deficiencie of the Husbandmens knowledge.
IT is found by a general practice in the Vale of Belvoire, commonly called
Beaver, where the best, and purest Wheat in Europe usually grows; that if
the Farmers sow their Wheat upon the fallowes, then it is usually blasted, by
reason of the fatness of the ground, which this grain cannot endure; but if
they sow it with Barley first, and Peason next, to abate the fertility, and
overmuch fatness thereof; then it is not subject to blasting; by this it
appears at the first show, that the fatness of the soil is the only cause
of blasting: but upon better consideration, I have found two other causes
concurring to produce this effect, whereof neither of them are thunder and
lightning, according to the vulgar opinion; for that would blast one ear as
well as his next fellow growing so near it; for what should defend the one
more then the other; or what should defend the Wheat sown, after the two
crops of Barley and Peason, but the leanness of the land; which the former
practitioners this way not considering, spoiled their project, by over-fatning
the ground; thinking thereby to regaine in the greatness of the increase, the
great charge and labor, which they were at in setting it the rude way with a
board with holes in it.

And as for the other two causes of their failing, they were these: First, in a
moist year the immoderate raines joined with the fatness, and glutted the
roots overmuch with fatness and moisture together, which this grain will not
suffer: Secondly, when the ground was not over-fat, yet the great raines
carried down the fatness, into the lower places of the land, and so blasted
that Wheat which grew there, letting the other escape unblasted, that grew
upon the ridges, and on the top of the little furrows; where the wet and
fatness descended from them speedily, and did not overcharge them with
fatness and moisture together.

I have pulled up a thousand ears, both blasted, and unblasted; and have
searched into the causes, as far as my capacity would extend, and can find
no other cause but these.

And it is certain, that neither of these causes alone does produce this
effect, but both joined together, viz. too much fatness and moisture, both at
once: for the practitioners of this work, in some dry and hot years, had
extraordinary great increase, which animated them to follow it so fiercely
diverse years; there being no question, but that else one years practice would
have satisfied them; for they knew the great charge and labor in one year, as
well as in many, and had increase when the dryness of the year served to
recompense all, or else they would have instantly ceased.

And it is as certain, that moisture without too much fatness does not
produce this effect; for then it would do it upon Wheat sown the third Crop,
as well as upon the first; which sometimes, in immoderate rainy years it does
upon some ears growing in the hollower places of the land, in the third
Croppe; the reason is, as I said before, because the rain carries thither the
fatness of the higher ridges, and so overchargeth it in those places with
fatness and moisture together; for Wheat and Hops are both of a nature, they
will not prosper but in moist ground; yet they are easily overcharged with
moisture: therefore as Hops must be hilled, that they may draw moisture at
pleasure, and not have it forced upon them; so must Wheat, or else the
Husbandman will be often frustrated of his expected increase; which our former
setters of Wheat, not knowing, or at least, not observing, had their Croppe so
often blasted, that at length their project was blasted for want of judgment,
and experience.

Also their tedious manner of going to work, by diging their ground, and
setting the Wheat with such a number of workmen, for want of invention, did
make the loss more intolerable; for they hoped for a wonderful increase,
which some dry years they observed; but in moist years, their Corn was much
more blasted, then that sown the common way upon lean ground; whereby we see
how easily a good cause may be spoiled.

Now to remedy all these inconveniences, there is no way but my two new
Inventions, or Engines; the first remedieth the great charge and labor of
workmen; for by this invention, two men, or boys, may set an Acre upon a day;
whereas before, forty persons were little enough to do it; and does excel
the old way in expedition, even as the Science of Printing does excel writing.

And the other Engine does afterward lay the Land in little furrows or
ridges, just upon the top of the rows of Corn: so that all the other
inconveniences are remedied: for then neither Surplusage of moisture annoyeth
it, nor frost in Winter kills it, lying at such a convenient deepnesse.

And this way the Land will abide to be made flatter then before, that it may
produce a far greater increase.

Also the Land need not to be dug this way, as they used to do before: but
only ploughed, and harrowed, and then the Wheat set.

And you shall find that the Wheat which will Sow one acre the Common way,
will set ten acres this way, and notwithstanding you shall have a far greater
crop.

And as for your Seed, you may if you please pick it out of the middle of the
ear for your trial in small quantities, but when you deal in great
quantities, you may hang a cloth over a beam in a long room, so that the
nether end lie upon the ground, and then with a shovell a great way off, you
may cast it over the beam in such manner, that a fourth part thereof, or as
near as you can, may fly over the beam, and so be parted by the cloth, and
you shall find that fourth part larger and greater Corn then the other a great
deal, which will serve for your Seed.

And in this manner may be set all manner of Corn whatsoever, and with the
like utilitie.

But for Rye, (yet Rye will double the labor, if it be furrowed), Barley and
other grain, you need not to make it into little furrows and ridges, as you
are to do the Wheat, they being not so subject to blasting, but the Wheat
being to be set in moist Clay ground must be so ordered, to prevent the
inconveniences aforesaid, and where the ground is very moist, there the little
furrows and ridges must be contrary to the common way: for they must be made
from the ridge of the Land, to the furrow of the Land, that so the moisture may
descend without drowning the corn, and in this manner you shall have almost as
good Corn to the furrows, as at the ridges which is seldom seen the common
way; but many times the half Land is wholly killed with being overcharged with
moisture, and it happens well the common way, if upon due trial there be half
so much Corn upon that half of the Land toward the furrow, as there is of
the other half toward the ridges.

And for more full satisfaction of this work, I would have every one to try a
few perches of ground, first, a year, two or three, which he may do for so
little quantity, with a board with holes, five or six inches, distant the old
way, and then he may with a Spade for so little ground make it into little
ridges and furrows, and if he find no inconvenience but the charge of many
workmen, he may provide the Engines afterward, which will cure that
inconvenience.

And I would have no man to lay an aspersion upon this work, or any of the
other, before it be duly tried, whether it be a profitable invention or no: for
if it be much availeable for the general profit, then it is supported by many
excellent examples in former time; for as I said in the beginning, as the
people grew more and more numerous, so they were more and more put to their
shifts for inventions to get their livings: for when they were but few, they
found maintenance out of Fish, Foul, Venison, and other things afforded freely
by nature: but afterward they were glad to take Spades, and to dig, and from
that to the plough, that chiefest of all Engines, and the manner of working
they were glad to alter: for when Land came to be scarce for the maintenance of
the inhabitants, they found the use of fallowing and manuring: whereby the Land
got more fertility in one years rest, then by the former way in many years,
when they used to let it lie to grass for many years to gather heart of it
self: by this invention a Country would maintain double the number of people
more then before, being only thus helped by industry. Of these works Solomon
means where speaking of the Husbandmans knowledge, he says that his God has
taught him: the Ancients used to deifie their Inventors as Bacchus, Ceres, etc.
and the wisest of all that had more understanding then to think them to be
gods, yet thought they were men in high favor with the gods: for that they saw
their inventions prospered, and took such admirable effect for the general
good of the universe.

And I would have no man to spurn against these improvements, being so
manifestly conducing to the general good of all persons and Commonwealths:
for if they do, they will be found upon due trial by the judgment of the
most understanding men in these affairs in the whole Kingdom, with whom I
have conferred, to be contenders against the common profit, and welfare of the
Land.

And it is not intended that this work of setting of Corn, should be
generally put in practice at the first: but in every place a little in the most
convenient and apt places, that so the people may be well skilled in it, and
fit to follow it more earnestly in time of dearth and scarcity, wherein so
much Corn may be saved for present relief and necessity, that it will be as
good as a general Storehouse for the whole Kingdom, for by this invention, we
do as it were borrow of nature a multitude of quarters of Corn for present
maintenance and food till the ensuing Harvest.

Because that the gain in dear years of Corn is so infinite in this work;
for the last year there might have been saved fifteen shillings, besides all
charges, in every Acre of Barley, in the price of the Seed; and also the
Croppe would have been better by the least as much more. I will here make a
description of the Engine, which else would puzzle the best Engineres in the
World; for if it be set at convenient depth and distance, then there grows no
weeds at all, as I have found by good experience; for if the earth be equally
charged with profitable seeds, then it produces no weeds; else it will spend
it self into weeds, or something; for I have found double increase when I have
set it four inches distant, and about two inches, or two inches and an half
deep, more then when I set it deeper or thinner: therefore in regard that
every good and expert Enginere may make the rest of the Engines in this Book,
by the light therein given, I will trouble my self no more, but to let them
teach the rest; and so proceed to describe this, that it may not be lost in
future time.

And thus I begin my description; let there be two boardes of equal breadth,
boared with wide holes at four inches distance, and be set in a frame two
foot high, the one from the other.

Then let there be a funnell for every hole, made of thin boardes about two
inches square.

Then for the top, let there be two thin boards of equal breadth, boared
likewise; whereof the uppermost is to be boared with an hot iron, with holes
longer the one way then the other; and is to be of such a thickness, that but
one Corn only can lie in the hole.

The other board is be boared with wide holes, and to be loose, that while the
Engine is charged, the whole part may be under the holes of the uppermost
board; and when the holes in the earth are made by the nether works, then to
be moved so, that all the Corns may drop down.

And for charging, a little Corn being swept up and down by a broom, or a
brush, will fill the holes; and if any miss, the workman may put in here and
there an odd Corn with his fingers, and then moving the second board till the
holes be answerable, all the Corns will drop down at an instant.

Then let a large ledge be set about the top of the Engine, to keep the
Corn from spilling, and so is the upper part thereof made.

As for the nether work, it is somewhat more chargeable and intricate; for
there must be for every hole, a little socket of brass, cast with a verge to
nail unto the nether board about the hole, which must be turned, and boared,
all of one wideness to an hairs breadth, and must be wide above, and strait
below, like a faucet.

Then there must be iron pinnes of five inches long, of great thick iron wier,
drawn so fit, that no earth can come into the brass sockets.

Now to make these play up and down at pleasure, is the greatest skill in the
whole work; and there is no other way, but that which is here described.

There must be for every wooden funnell a piece of iron forged flat, with an
hole in the middle, edgwise; which through two slits in the nether part, must
play up, and down; through which a brass nail must be fastened, cast with an
head, contrary to other nails, bowing downwards, to which the iron pinnes
must be fastened with wiers, and so thrust down, and plucked up at pleasure.

And then every end of the flat pieces of iron, must be fastened into a piece
of wood, of such thickness, that two thereof may fill up the distance between
the rows of the wooden funnels.

These may be made to play up and down like Virginal Iackes; and when they
are lifted up, then the brass funnels being wider above then below, gives
leave for the Corn to fall into the holes, all an an instant.

These Iackes must be fastened together, the two first on either side of the
wodden funnels; then so many together as the weight of the workmen is able to
thrust down to make the holes.

And there must be a stay to hold up the Iackes at pleasure, when they are
lifted up again to such an altitude, as that the corns may descend by them
into the holes.

And the bottom of the iron pins must be flat, and by that means they will
not be so apt tp draw up earth into the funnels; also the roots of the Corn
will spread better, and bring a greater increase, if the ground be saddened a
little in the bottom of every hole.

And the tops of the iron pinnes must likewise be flat, and hang a little
loose in the wiers; else if any of the brass sockets get a little wrench, they
will not be drawn through, because the holes must be strait.

Though the making of this Engine be somewhat chargeable and toublesome, yet if
skillful men first break the ice, then it will be common, and the most
profitable Invention that ever was found out.

And the top of the Engine must be ledged about with large ledges, to keep
the Corn from spilling; so will a quart or two of Corn serve a good while, and
must be renewed upon occasion.

And the nether half part of every wooden funnell, must be loose on one
side, to take off and on at pleasure; to amend that which is amiss, upon every
occasion.

Also if the slittes in the funnels be lined with iron, the work will be more
durable.

But lest that the charge of this Engine, together with the difficulty of
getting it, may be a hinderance to the work intended; I will add a
description of a more easy way for the poorer sort, which is subject to the
capacity of every ordinary workman, and is made of wood only; without either
brass or iron: but herein I will tell no woers tales, but the worst as well as
the best; for these Engines will not endure like the other; besides that, there
must be four workmen, because that the Engine must be made of two parts; the
one to go before and make the holes, the other to come after, and to drop in
the Corn; this last must not differ a whit from the upper part of the former;
only it must have four feet like tops, in the four corners, which must be
set right in the holes, which are made by the other part which goes before;
which likewise must have four such feet, to leave an impression when it is
remooved forward, whereby the second may be rightly placed, so that the Corns
may fall right into every hole.

That part which must make the holes, is to be made of two boards of equal
breadth to the other, and must be boared full of holes, of equal distance
likewise; the wooden pins must be greater then those of iron; because the holes
will need to be somewhat large and wide; and they must be fast in the upper
board, and loose in the nether board.

And if the Engine be large, as this way it may be larger then the other; by
reason that it is easilier lifted and removed, being in two parts; then the
upper part must be slit, and divided into so many parts, that the weight of the
workmen by treading upon them, may press them down to make the holes.

And though this way will require four workmen, yet the charge will not be
double, nor much more then the former way; by reason that the workmen may go
forward with more expedition; and may set a broader compass of ground at one
time.

CHAP. IX. Wherein is manifestly showed the cause of the mildew, with the
preventions and cures.
AS for the Mildew, it is a thing quite contrary to Blasting, and is thus
caused: When the flowers, and blossoms are in their pride, and fullness, the
Sun by his heat, exhaleth some part of their sweetness, and converteth the
same into Common Air; which in the night is condensed, and falls into dew
upon such things as have most virtue attractive to draw it unto them: Of which
sort are chiefly the leaves of the Oak tree, next to that are Hops, next to
that is Corn; this dew being unctuous and clammie, is apt to coagulate and
harden by the heat of the Sun upon the Corn the next day; and if it happen
often to fall upon diverse days together, and no rain come to wash it off,
then it gets power to suffocate, and strangle the vegetative virtue of the
Corn; and so it withers by the heat of the Sun, whose heat before caused
it to vegetate and multiply: as for the remedy it is thus to be cured; let two
men in the morning before the rising of the Sun, go up and down the
furrows of the Corn, and holding a cord stretched betwixt them, carry it so,
that it may shake off the dew, which will easily be done before that the Suns
heat has exhaled the thinnest part thereof, and caused the thicker part to be
clammie and glutenous: and for better information of the time of this accident,
let men observe when the Hive Bees go abroad more early then ordinary, and let
there be watchmen for this purpose; and to the end that all things might be
conducible to the general profit; I will spend a few lines in the commendation
of this creature of God, the Be; who gets her riches totally, out of
nothing but what else would be lost; for whatsoever she gets, is that which
the flowers by their attractive virtue draw to them in the night, out of the
dew that falls; and if the Bees should not by their industry, in the day
time, fetch it away, the said flowers would not draw the same the next night,
and so the food of honey would be lost; for all food is nothing but Air
congealed, which is manifest in the precedent, and ensuing discourses:
therefore seeing that these creatures are such an excellent instrument to
congeale Air, I wish they were more made use of; for what were it for every
one to have Bees, they ask nothing but an house rent-free to dwell in, and
when they die, they bequeath their riches to their landlords: I have known
many experiments tried to save their lives, by driving them, feeding them,
sleeping them, that they should not eat that in Winter, which they got in the
Summer, but all was vain; for what was gotten in the East, was lost in the
West, and when all ways were tried, the old ways were found to be the best,
and surest: I must confess, I have seen Bees driven into a new hive in the
plain Country, and so carried into the Forest, wherein the flowers and
blossoms flourished later then in the plain Country, and by that means they
got maintenance for the Winter following, but this was in a year when the
weather was fair and prosperous all the while, during the flourishing of the
flowers and blossoms in both Countries; which is a thing very seldom seen,
and therefore I will advise no man to the practice, being so fickle and
dangerous; for I love not to Tantalize men with vain hopes, for. Tantalus his
Apples never filled the belly, nor the purse; which was cause that I advise men
so much to industry, as the surest way for their profit, and wish that they may
not be Tantalized by others, which tell them fair tales sorting with their
humors; thereby gaining opportunity to make use of the most dispositions,
which are apt to give credence upon slight grounds, if the tale told be such as
they desire to be true, though it be unpossible; according to the old Proverb,
Quod volumus omnes facile credimus: which is cause that so many are deceived in
the world: for their constitution rules their passion almost generally, and
their passion likewise overruleth their reason, so that he that looks into
the business perspicuously, thinks the world to be mad or foolish; and the
world thinks the same by him, as it was by Democritus, who through his
contrariety in conceit, to the vulgar multitude was deemed mad, though he had
more wit then all the rest; whereby it appears, that strong conceit, rather
then solid understanding, bears the greatest sway in the world; and there is
another reason why I would have every one to have Bees, and that is, that they
might be their School Masters, as well as their watchmen, to forewarne them of
the mildew: for their industrious heed in this work, that no opportunity
escape them to work, while the time serves for the general welfare of their
Commonwealth, declares the admirable discipline of the great law of Nature,
which they obey, and will by no means break for any conceits, or private
quarrels: and let me not forget to spend a little Ink and Paper about Hops. I
have known a thousand pound damage in one Hoppe Garden in a week, or a
fortnights time, by this Mildew: I have shaken some poles in the morning, and
have found that it did good, by the difference betwixt those, and the others;
but I have not brought the experiment to full perfection, for want of
opportunity: I thought to have watered the Hops with such spouts as are used in
London, when houses are on fire, by sprouting up the water very high, that it
might fall like rain, and perform the effect thereof; and let no man
overvalue the charge, for one thousand pounds worth of Hops being preserved
thus, when others neglect, the work will be worth near ten thousand pound:
such a year, when the greatest part are spoiled by this misfortune; which is
manifest by the difference of the prizes at Sturbridge Fair, and other places;
being one year at twenty, or thirty shillings a hundred, and the next year
at ten pound a hundred: If any one will try this experiment fully, that has
better opportunity then I have, and then publish it for the general good, he
shall be my brother; for that we are both of a Trade, or profession, which
shall be called Knowledge-mongers, differing from Fishmongers, Iron-mongers,
etc. in that we pay so dear for our wares, and give them away for nothing,
which is the cause why we thrive no better of our Trades; but let us not be
disheartened, for we will lay our heads together, to bring our Trade into
request, by laying open the benefit of our Inventions, and by discovering the
vanity of other devices, where one man's gain comes by another loss; so
will the Major part come tous, through their good dispositions, and love to
virtue, honesty, and goodness, and so the rest must come to us by force, or
else want and poverty will expel them out of the School of Husbandry; and we
will comfort our selves in the mean time, with the incomparable joy of a good
conscience, and fear no disaster in our enterprise, assuring our selves, that
God is on our sides, and so conclude with the saying, Si Deus nobiscum quis
contra nos?

CHAP. X. Wherein is manifestly showed the cause of the rotting of Sheep, with
the prevention and cure.
AS for the rotting of Sheep; a thing which has undone many an honest simple
man, for want of knowledge to prevent it; I will proceed according to my wonted
manner, to investigate the cause, thereby gaining facility, to acquire the
remedy; and for that the loss of the goods is not all, but that there is as
great a loss in the fertility of the Corn ground which should be manured by
these cattle; I will use the more diligence.

It is certain, that Sheep, of all other Cattle, are of cold and moist
constitution, which is evident, in regard they can live without drinking of
water; though when they see it, they will sometimes drink; yet is it then but
a fancy, in regard it is well known they can live well without it, and
prosper as well as with it: this shows that their livers are cold and moist
of their own nature, and cannot abide surplusage of moisture like other
cattle; and therefore in a moist Summer they are troubled with this disease in
the same ground, where in a dry year, they are not thereunto subject; the
reason is, that in certain grounds, the quality of the grass is changed with
much moisture, and abounds with the laxative, or rarifying sort of fatness,
which is subject to dissolve their livers, being the fountain of liquor which
should moisten their bodies with good juice; and through this dissolution
nature is not able to make due separation of the nutrimentall part, but
suffers it to go to the parts desiring nourishment unseparated, whereby
their bodies are repleat with noxious and waterish humors; thereby causing
death and destruction to the bodies thus distempered; as for the cure, it is
difficult, unless it be done betime, before the dissolution of the liver be
too far out of frame: the best way for their cure, is to remoove them to the
salt Marshes, or to the dry forest, whose nutriment is astringent, and
fastening, by reason of the incombustible and binding fatness there
predominating; but because this remedy is not every where to be had, let us
think of some universal remedy, of which sort I know none, but vigilant
providence, in due time to prevent it; and where I have had an intent to water
Hay with salt water, so long as the saltness would not cause them to forbear
to eat it; yet in regard I have not had opportunity to try the experiment
fully, I will only commend it as a probable, but not an approved medicine.

But to proceed to the preventions of this disease, the best part of Physic;
let every Harvest, a certain quantity of the best Hay be laid apart for this
cattle; you shall know which is best for this purpose, by the constitution of
it; for that which is hard, and of a dry nature is best, and that which is of
a silkish softuesse is worse; for the first strengthens the liver, and the
other looseneth, and dissolveth it; and the more their livers are strengthened
in the Winter time, by foddering them with the most astringent fodder, the
better they will bear out a wet Summer; which is evident to be seen in a
whole flock, wherein some of the Sheep having a more hot and dry liver, do
escape through their strong constitution, differing as men do one from another
in nature: but that this prevention may not seem frivolous, let us
Philosophize a little, about the nutriment, and the thing nourished; which
nutriment, though it be not able to change the form of the thing nourished,
yet it is able to change its constitution; as may be feene by Birds feeding on
Juniper berries, whose flesh tastes plainly of the nutriment: also Bees in
the Forest yield a sort of Honey, far different from that in the plain
Country: and to make it more plain, Sheep that feed upon such grounds as
yield silkish soft grass, are sooner rotted, then those that feed upon a
drier, and a hard grass, whose nature is astringent, and not apt to dissolve
their livers like the other: therefore for a second remedy, I would have all
such hurtful ground enclosed, and kept for other cattle; and in the mean
time, let the Sheep be kept from it in moist weather, and fed upon grounds
which yield a more firm nourishment; so shall they be preserved, and yield
both food and clothing for men, which are the substance of all riches; in
comparison whereof, all the rest are but complements, and trifles; for they
yield a double nourishment; one way by their flesh, another way by their
manuring of land, thereby causing the increase of Corn, the staff of life.

Whereby it appears of how great consequence good Husbandry is in a
Commonwealth, viz. the very legs and pillars thereof, without which it
cannot stand, nor by any other device, or policy whatsoever.

And therefore I would wish every well-willer to the public weal, to be
diligent in the furtherance of it; and to read Master Markham, Master Googe,
Master Tusser, Sir Hugh Platt, and others, who have manifested their good will,
by publishing their knowledge in this behalf.

And I desire every one not to think much of his labor, to try experiments of
this nature, whose effect, if they prove good, are beneficial to all, present,
and future; and not to be slack, nor hard hearted, to publish the same; for
that they are thereby recorded to be well-willers to that which every man is
bound to by the great Law of Nature.

And if any man be negligent in this duty, he does manifest his unworthiness
to all posterity; showing plainly that he does prefer his private gain
before the general; which is a thing odious to all men of understanding.

And admit he be accounted a conceited fellow, or one that runs not the
common way; yet in regard the common way leads to perdition, let him not
desist for frivolous aspersions: for when light and truth shall appear in the
World, his worth shall shine, and not be eclipsed by the tongues of conceited
fools, and coxcombes, whose disputations and reasons seem to be concluded,
when the tune thereof fitteth the fancies of the hearers; then they desire no
other dance to be plaide upon those tinckling instruments, but had rather hear
the same plaide over and over; a thing tedious to wisemen, though it were never
so true; for Nature delights in vanities, and when truth shall appear, and
shine in the world, then these bables will be found as they are; nothing but
the tinckling of the Air, and element soft and pliable; and such a thing which
men can bow, and bend to their purpose, like wax at the fire, and make good
every thing they say at pleasure, be it so or not.

But then by their favors, they must have shallow brained Judges of their
argumentations, and conclusions; who are like themselves, deluded with their
own fancies, and have their reasons obscured by their passions; and these
differ from madmen no otherwise, but as the greater differs from the lesser
thing of the same kind; for though in mad men, it is a privation of reason,
and in fools an obscuration, yet folly preceded, and caused the other; for
though perhaps, some have had injuries enough to make them mad, yet it was
their follies, that they did not rather suffer it with patience, then suffer
their hearts to break so untemperately with discontent; and so long, till the
vapors thereof had lifted up so much melancholy to the brain, that it was
therewith overwhelmed; and the curious Organs thereof, so obstructed, and
stopped, that it was afterward uncurable: Of which things, I wish every one to
take heed betime; for when the Steed is stolen, it is too late to make fast
the stable door.

I deny not but that in other years, and by much moisture falling in other
months, some few Sheep of the most waterish, and flegmaticke constitution,
may be caught with this disease; but this is not of that material consequence
which I aim at; my meaning being to prevent the grand inconveniences, caused
by ignorance; as for those which are more trivial, I desire that every one may
endeavor to prevent or cure, by his own industry; by adding somewhat of his
own for the full accomplishing of the work intended: and for his furtherance,
I will here set down the erroneous opinions of many Husbandmen in this matter:
some are of opinion, that much rainie weather in clipping time does cause this
effect, which is manifestly false; for that the same cause is in the salt
marshes and barren forests, where the rot never comes, as is in the plain
and fertile fields; I deny not, but that the external coldness, and
moisture, when the Sheep are new shorn, may be somewhat coadjuting to produce
this mischievous effect; but yet not the sole cause, which I desire may be
prevented, by taking time to sheare Sheep in fair and pleasant weather, and
to house them a day or two, upon urgent occasion of sudden, and great rain: If
any one object, that no man knows how to choose this time, I answer him, that
he may foresee it by weather-glasses for that purpose; which I could
demonstrate, but that I delight not to plod on in common paths; but will rather
refer him to Master Bates his Book lately written, and entitled, The
Masteries of Nature and Art; wherein he may see the work made manifest; and
that sufficient warning is given of all mutations of weather, by an infallible
Prognosticutive experiment: I have seen many of these glasses ready made fit,
and sold in the Glasse-shops in London; together with a printed paper showing
the use thereof; which will be profitable for the Countrymen for diverse other
occasions as well as this; and every active handed man may make them the
plainest way for twelve pence charge, which will serve as well as the best:
others are of opinion, that Honey-dewes cause this effect; but this is false
also; for there are more honey-dewes in sound years for Sheep, then in rotten
years; and this is manifest, that in years when Sheep are most subject to
this disease, the Bees are likewise most subject to die in the Winter time with
famine; which may be discerned by the lightness of their Hives in July; but
this is not a general rule for Hives in all Countries; for some years, when
the Hives in the plain Country are light, and not well furnished for
maintenance in the Winter time; the same year Forest Hives are rich and
heavy; and the cause is, for that the weather was fair and pleasant in the
latter part of Summer, when the barren Forests flourished; and foul, and
rainie in the former part of Summer, when the plain Country did flourish and
this is generally observed by my self, and my Predecessor, for the space of
threescore and fourteen years, that always when the Hives of Bees were
hight, and not well provided for Winter, (...) Valleys the same year, the
Sheep died of the rot extremely: which upon my first taking notice of, I
thought that both these diseases proceeded from one and the same cause* but
upon further investigation, it proved to be true in part, but not in the
total, for the multitude of rain in May and June, caused both these effects:
but yet in the Bees it caused their ruin, by frequent washing of the
honey-dewes, and also by hindering them from working in their best season; and
in the Sheep, by producing frimme and frothie grass, abounding with moisture,
which these cattle can not bear; for if the grass be never so firm, yet
sheep, though they never drink, their bodies will yield Urine, contrary to
other Cattle; who if their meat be moist, drink so much less water, and
thereby save their livers from dissolution, and putrefaction: some have though,
that the kells like cobwebs, have done this effect; but that is false likewise;
for that they are as plentiful in the salt Marshes, and barren places, as in
the fertile grounds: some have thought that a certain kind of thicke-leaved
grass, like almost to Purslaine, has done the mischief, but this is also
false; for that the rot comes where there is none of it: some have thought
that the Land-flouds caused it, these have some hint of the truth, but not
fully; for it is found by experience, that where the earth is fattened with
Land-flouds in the nether part of the fertile fields, there the sheep are
most subject to this discase; but the reason is, that there the grass is most
frimme and frothie, and most abounding with moisture in moist Summers;
therefore let them be withdrawn to the higher places of the fields, in such
years only, when the months of May and June, prove very moist and rainie,
and the field is noonne: these things being duly observed, will produce more
general benefit, then many greater studies; and seeing that Husbandry did not
only build, but also maintain all Schools; I could wish that it was better
fortified, being the very foundation of a prosperous Commonwealth; and if
every one would equalize my benevolence, who have reaped double benefit out of
the Schools: we will erect a College for Inventions in Husbandry, in
retribution of their former supplies to Learning; and so conclude, that quid
pro quo is lawful payment: this is one of the richest experiments in this
Book, and depends upon skill, more then upon corporal labor; and therefore
I desire that it may be thankfully accepted, and made use of; being a thing
that no man could fully ever discover before my self; nor my self neither,
but that I had help by the experience of my Predecessor.

And to the end that men may with the most ease prevent this great loss in
their flocks of sheep by rotting, let it please them to understand, that
during my own 24. years observations, and for any thing that I can find in
my Book of 50. years observations, there was never any material loss by this
misfortune, nor any rot of sheep worthy to be taken notice of, but in such
years when the months of May and June, and especially June proved to be
extreme moist and rainie weather: for I have observed that in some years
July, August and September have been so immoderate moist and rainie, that no
hay not Corn could be well gotten, but half spoiled with the foul weather,
and yet notwithstanding all this, there was no rot of sheep that year: the
like I have known in March and April, and yet no rot at all that year:
whereby it appears, that in the faid months of May and June immoderate rain
does produce that frim and frothy grass, which by its laxative and rarifying
quality does dissolve and weaken the livers of the sheep more or less
according to the strength or weakness of their livers before caused by
nature, or by art helping nature: and also according to the greater or lesser
quantity of rain and moisture in the said months: and this accident comes to
pass usually in low grounds, and such as abound with the astringent fatness,
which in dry years are as sound as any other grounds: yet when they are so
plentifully watered with much rain in the spring part of summer, the grass
shoots up so hastily, that the dissolving and rarifying fatness does
predominate in its composition: and changes its nature so wonderfully, that it
is able to work this mischievous effect: for it is clear, that in winter when
the grass grows either slowly or not at all, there is none of these
accidents, be the weather never so moist and rainy, neither in low fat grounds,
nor in high barren grounds, neither in the latter part of summer, nor yet in
the very beginning of the spring time, but only in the pride of the spring,
viz. in May and June, and most especially in June: Wherefore let every one
trouble himself no further, but to fodder his sheep in winter, with the most
astringent fodder, according to my former directions? and withal to withdraw
them from the frim and fat low grounds, to the more barren and dry grounds in
the said months of May and June, and especially in June, in such years only
when those months are extreme moist and rainie; and I will hazard my
reputation upon it, (which I value more than all the sheep both rotten and
sound in England, and never, as yet, forfeited the same in any affairs of this
nature) that he shall never stand in need to lay the key under his door, and
bid good night to his Landlord, through any prejudice which shall come to him
through this misfortune.

CHAP. XI. Wherein is showed, that in these Ages, Inventions to save the number
of men's works, are not profitable to a Commonwealth overcharged with people,
but rather the contrary.
AS for the new Inventions, for the saving of men's work in an over-peopled
Commonwealth, it is disputable whether they be for the general good or not;
yet in regard that the chief policy consists in finding out ways, how the
same quantity of land may maintain more people then it did before, which
cannot be done any way, but by industry of the people; therefore I conceive,
that in the new Inventions, it is for the general good to save men's works by
Engines; for if one workman can do as much with his Engine, as ten men can
do without it, there is nine men's maintenance saved to the Commonwealth;
whereby plenty is increased to every one: I must needs confess, that if the
common practice in Husbandry now used, was to set their Corn the common way,
that then the Engine newly invented for that purpose might do more hurt then
good; for that so many would then want employment; as we see in London; there
was an Invention to grind the Needles many at once, whereby half the
Needlemakers had gone a begging, if the new device had not bin restrained; but
in this case it is far otherwise, for here is employment for many more
people then before; though there be many men's works saved, which would be lost
working the rude way: also here is a great improvement in the quantity of
land; for by this means the new people set on work do get maintenance for
many more then themselves, by their industry upon the same quantity of land
which would maintain but a few before. And it is to be conceived, that when
these Inventions and Improvements shall be thoroughly put in practice, then the
Commonwealth will not be overpeopled; but rather there will want people to
accomplish the work, whereby it will appear that the saving of men's works
will then be a profitable Invention.

CHAP. XII. As for the Objections against any thing contained in this Book, to
free my self from all partiality toward my own side, I have here set them
down all punctually as they have bin objected by several Husbandmen, and
others, in sundry conferences.
Objection. I.
WE find in your Book some things somewhat airie, and not so solid as we did
expect; amongst the rest, you allege that all riches are made of vapors
congealed, and that you will teach us to congeale vapors at pleasure, into as
much treasure as we list, and into what form we please; if you satisfy us in
this point, we will bear with all the rest of your imperfections, for these
are our chief desire, and this work being the sum of your Book, calls
your reputation most in question, if you do not perform your undertaking
herein.

Answer.

It is plain that all Trees, Plants, and Fruits are made of vapors congealed,
for nothing vegetateth but in Summer when the heat of the Sun is in force to
rarifie and turn the said fatness of the earth into a vapor, and is more
manifestly seen in Greeneland, where the heat is wanting, there the Air is
not able to erect it self into one Tree in the whole Country: and for a more
full demonstration of this my position, that all things are nothing but
congealed vapors; let us consider of these things following, viz. the raining
of Frogs, Thunderstones, Wheat, or a thing almost like to it: the cause of
these things can be no other, but that when a convenient heat had almost
formed them in their proper Sphere, viz. in the superficies of the earth, then
a greater heat accidentally coming, raised up the spermaticall substance
thereof into the common Air, and there hatched the same, till such time as the
magnitude and ponderositie thereof caused them to fall to their proper Sphere.

And as for the infinity of this work, it is plain that a thousand Oak Trees
or other, will grow in one Farm in the hedgerowes, as well as one, and for the
gain thereof, what are they at the first, but a thousand Acorns? the like is
to be seen in Corn. I have had 38. ears of Barley, containing 1124. grains,
come of one grain set in four months: so we see there is no more to be done,
but to learn to fit the seed to the ground and Climate, and then to plant it;
and then we see that Nature is no niggard, but gives riches to all that are
industrious, be their number never so much increased.

Objection. II.
We find a contradiction in your Book, for in one place you say, that all
riches are made of the fatness of the earth, which is a combustible matter; as
Oil, Grease, Rosen, Pitch, Tallow, Sulphur, etc. and in another place you say
also, that Gold is made of the said fatness of the earth, which is a substance
altogether free from burning, and is not diminished in the fire; we would be
resolved, how these seeming contrarieties can be true.

Answer.

I said that there is a double fatness in every compounded body, the one
combustible, and the other incombustible, which may be seen in the burning of
the highest twigges of any Tree; for first there rises a sharp vapor in the
burning, which is the universal spirit of the world, and the vehiculum which
by the help of the Suns heat, lifts up the former fatness, then the
combustible part consumes into air by the fire; then the ashes remaining,
being laid upon land fatneth it, whereby a fatness incombustible is
discovered, and these two fatnesses are in mineralls as well as vegetables, and
of the incombustible and fixed fatness mineral is Gold made by nature, and
also by art, imitating Nature; and if any man doubt it, let him hazard a good
wager upon it, which shall be equalized, and the question shall be determined
by the greatest, viz. experience which admits no imposture; yet I could
advise my best friends that love to try experience, to spend their money,
time, and study upon Improvements in Husbandry, being works more certain,
and more profitable.

Objection. III.
We must needs confess that barrenness increases by the usual practice in
Husbandry at this day, and by the two ways alleged by you in your Book, viz.
first, by the carrying of the sheep from the Commons with their full bellies
into the Folds, whereby the one ground is impoverished to enrich the other; and
this we conceive may be cured by your new Inventions, for providing of manure
which was neglected before: secondly, the Land is much impoverished by great
Land-flouds, which carry a wonderful quantity of fatness yearly into the
Sea, but how this should be remedied we know not; we must needs confess that
your Inventions for the providing of manure more then before, are excellent
good and profitable for the general good, and will withstand the barrenness
much; so that it will not increase so fast as it did before: yet we conceive
that barrenness will still increase, though more slowly; for all your
multiplications of manure will not equalize, much less overmatch the fatness
carried yearly by Land-flouds into the Sea.

Answer.

It is certain that the new provision of manure by Lime, ashes, Marle,
Mussilage, and residence of water, and by the rest of the Inventions, will
equalize and overmatch the great quantity of fatness carried yearly into the
Sea, if the same shall be industriously put in practice: the subterraneall
vapors yearly elevate a great quantity of fatness, though in some places
more abundantly then in others; for I have known arable land borne good corn
time out of mind, with every third years rest and fallowing, without any
manure at all, but only by this subterraneall vapor arising from some
subterraneall fat substance: but though this be but in some special places,
yet there is no question but that it helps well in all places, though of it
self it be not sufficient without addition of manure; but if all men would be
ruled by me, we would not only put these works in practice very industriously
for the general good, thereby to testify our love to all men both living, and
yet to come; but also we would make use of my first Invention mentioned in my
first Chapter, viz. to bow the knee of the heart, instead of the usual and
complementall bowing of the knee of the body, to the Donor of all goodness;
then might we have firm confidence, having formerly testified our love to God,
by the general love of all his creatures, especially those of our own kind,
that he would send the former and the latter rain in due season, without
scanting us at any time, and pouring down too much at other times, whereof we
had experience this last year, wherein both these events have caused loss to
this Kingdom above the value of 20. subsidies in one year: if this new
invention were well put in practice, then would the heart-maker take away these
our stony and hard hearts, and give us hearts of flesh, and all mourning and
lamentation for want of food would be done away: for then would our labors be
seconded by the chief master in Husbandry, so that we should no more be
frustrated of our expected Harvest.

Objection IIII.
We find your answers so satisfactory, that we will make no more objections
but this one, which we will almost answer our selves, which is this: we must
needs confess that your discourse concerning the preservation of Corn from
blasting, is very rational, and argues much skill in Husbandry; yet whether
the practice thereof will be answerable, though we see no cause to doubt
thereof; yet being schooled by your self, we will suspend our full belief
thereof, till experience testify and manifest the truth, and we desire to be
excused herein, because it is your own counsel to us, wherein we see not but
that howsoever it proves, you your self are out of blame, for that every man
may try the truth thereof by your own direction, without any material
prejudice in small quantity at the first. Therefore if it may please you to
show us your new invented Engines, and the use of them, how the tedious labor
of your new works may be eased, then we will declare our opinions to all
posterity, and so take our leaves.

Answer.

Well, go with me, and you shall receive as much satisfaction by
demonstration, as formerly by discourse. You see here the experiment of my
Persian wheel; you see that it is 40. foot high, you see that the bottles do
fill in the River, and empty themselves into a Trough 36. foot high, and the
water is conveyed into yonder Ditch which is a mile long: you see diverse stops
in the Ditch, whereby the water is caused to flow over yonder barren ground,
whereby it is become good meadow; you see it is of no great cost, nor subject to
be out of order, nor does require any great repair; you see the motion is
perpetual, day and night, without looking to, if you were in Persia you might
see two or three hundred of these in one River: if the water come from chalky
or limestone ground, or be mixed with land-flouds, then it does fatten the
ground wonderful. Now look upon my Engine, for the cleansing of Thorny and
rough grounds: you see the nether part is like a three grayned dung-forke
only, it is 40. times greater and stronger: you see the upper part is like a
leaver, but ten times stronger, and very much longer: you see here a great bush
of Thorns and Briers together, which to eradicate the common way would spend a
good part of a man's days work: Now thus I set my Instrument half a foot from
the root of it slopewise, then with an hedging Beetle I drive it in a good
depth, then I lift up the steel of it, and put in the great iron pin to keep
it straight, then I take hold of the cord that comes down from the top of
it, and pull it down, and you see that in a quarter of an hour the whole bush
is wrenched up by the roots. In this manner by 4. or 5. settings you may so
loosen the earth about a great tree, that the next great wind will blow it
down. Now I come to my Engine for setting of Corn, which to bring to this
perfection, has cost me 16. or 18. years practice: you see that a man may set
1000. grains in the twinkling of an eye, and the charging and discharging of
the grains at convenient distance is easy and expeditious, and you see that I
make the holes for the grains to fall into with my foot and the weight of my
body: you see that these Engines may be made of all magnitudes at pleasure, and
of all prices, from 10. shillings to 40. and he that had rather spare labor
then money may have a small Engine; and he that had rather spare money than
labor may have a great one: you see how equally at distance it sets the
grains, so that no ground is lost, as it is when the seed is confusedly
thrown with the hand, for there you shall find that sometimes there is a void
place of a foot broad; sometimes a dozen grains close together, when as one
grain in the place would produce as much increase: for I have had 1104.
grains come of one, and 38. ears grow upon one corn set; you see that either
the Engine may be made fit for the Land, or the Land for the Engine, that the
Engine may set a side of a Land from the ridge to the furrow at once, or being
lesser, at twice, or thrice at pleasure.

You see the infinite profit of this work, for by this work the third part of
the arable Land may be laid for Pasture or Hey ground, and the rest will
produce corn to maintain the whole Kingdom: also you see the infinite profit
that will arise in time of dearth, for by this means the Corn reserved in
Seed time, will releeve the Country of it self, which in former times has
been releeved by importation from other Countries, whereby the wealth of this
Kingdom has been so exhausted, that they have not recovered the same in many
years following; which inconvenience might have easily been remedied by this
invention: you see here my Engine for the making of the little ridges and
furrows* you see how neatly it lays the earth in little furrows just upon
the rows of Corn: you see that it makes diverse ridges and furrows at once
with good dispatch: and it may be fitted to be drawn with Horses, or to be
wrought with men's strength in such wet grounds, where it is convenient that the
little furrows be descending from the ridge of the Land to the furrow of the
same.

If I find the like good acceptance in general, which I have found at your
hands, and at the hands of all that I have hitherto acquainted with my
endeavors, of which sort many of them have been of the most solid and
judicious men in the Land in these affairs: then will I act out my part, and
like as hitherto I have acted the part of a torch which consumes it self to
give light to others; so will I do the rest of my life, and furnish you with
more and more new inventions and improvements, and will furthermore publish my
Book of experiments, which has been my whole life's practice, which I have
presumed to entitle with the name of Arts Mistress: for that all questions
therein handled, are determine by irrefragable demonstration and infallible
experience, which Book contains many notable experiments: whereof some are
for gain, some for health: some for pleasure, and some for prevention of
loss, to those who are naturally inclined to try experiments, wherein my
failings, as well as my prosperings are truly laid down, and so plainly, and
with such cautions, that it will save much study and labor, and many millions
of money, which else will be spent in future ages by trying the same again by
men of such inclinations, to whom it is as great pain to forbear study, as
it is to the others to study at all: and for a farewell to both natures, I
wish that those which love not to try experiments may take their ease, and
will lay no heavier task upon them, but to wish well to the others, and the
more to stir them up to this charity, I desire them to remember themselves
what case they had been in, if some inventive brains had not found the plough
and the use thereof, also if some of like disposition had not found out new
ways for the manuring and fertilizing of land afterward, when Countries grew
too strait for the numerous increase of people: Also I desire them to ponder
well upon the matter contained in this Book, and to consider well in what case
their posterity will be in two or three ages hence, if no new Inventions and
Improvements shall be from henceforth put in practice.

And for a final conclusion, I will sweep up the house with a beesome made of
my own folly, which shall be recorded against me, if hereafter I shall grow
proud of my skill: for what am I but a piece of earth quickened and animated by
the universal soul of the world? and what knowledge have I, but what every
one may have if he follow my steps, viz. if he bow the knee of the heart to the
donor of knowledge and understanding, and withal, dig for it as for
treasure, by trying experiments to bring truth to light? and what excellent
constitution have I to secure me, that I be not deluded by my fancy?

There needs no more demonstration of my folly, but my mad election of the time
to publish these my Inventions; when men are ready to throw the Plough in the
ditch, through a frivolous coffeehouse; which is manifest by their neglect
of things which they know already; and therefore they are very unapt to be
drawn to new Improvements; also their fisking away into the new Plantations so
fast, shows that they had rather be exiled from their native Country, then
to be disciplined by any new Inventions; which I make no question, but they
will be called Innovations by many, whose judgments are ruled by their evil
constitutions.

To demonstrate the truth of these my relations, there needs no more but to
show their follies, which are in my conceit as frivolous, as if an Husbandman
should lose a good sheep for a lick of Tar: for what is two pence, four
pence, or six pence upon an Acre of ground, in comparison of what may be
raised out of it by industrious Improvement; the payment of a little, for the
preservation of much, is in my conceit, a good bargain, and the present
grudging and murmuring at the payment of money for the safeguard of the rest,
is a conceited folly.

But for that I would be excused from partiality, I will hereby testify my
uprightness, for I will neither flatter the one nor the other, but declare my
own fancy; for I will not cologue with my Prince for preferment, nor comply
with the subject for any respect whatsoever; but according to my wonted manner,
show to the utetrmost of my skill, what is best to be done for the general
good; that is, if all would be ruled by me, we would fall to work bravely, and
then we shall be able to give the King twice as much money as he has occasion
for to make use of for our defense, or his own honor; and the rest will be
more then we need for our selves; for Nature is no niggard, but bountifully
feeds all her guests, be their months never so many, if they will but take a
little pains to cut out their meat by the ways prescribed in this little
book: I must needs confess that at this time many are ill enough able to pay
their money for the defense of the Kingdom; but where is the fault? Is it not
in our selves? I am assured that there is more good and apt land to extract
riches out on, in England, Scotland, and Ireland, then is in all Spain; and
now we have knowledge how to do it, so that there is nothing wanting but
willing minds; and why men should be backward in this work, I can find no
reason, but their evil constitutions causing them to be averse to the general
good; and then if they say they love God, or pretend any good Religion, they
will bridle these evil affections; for else no man of understanding will
believe them; for indeed they do but say so, and flatter themselves with
their deluded fancies; and as for reward for their work it is ready, in regard
that many of my Inventions and Improvements do consist upon skill and vigilant
providence, rather then upon corporal labor; and those which do consist of
labor, bring a present and speedy profit. As for those which bring not a
present profit, it is fit that the Landlord should be at the charge, for that
the yearly value of his land is advanced, even as it is in China, where they
lay that fine earth wherewith they make their curious vessels in the womb of
the earth to digest many years, and as the years pass on, they sell it one
to another, every seven years dearer and dearer, till that it be brought to
perfection; which time being known by experience, they have a kind of reaping
of benefit by it every year, notwithstanding, the length of time between the
work and the wages or harvest.

And let no man for any discontent whatsoever, though it were justly conceived,
neglect the future happiness and flourishing estate of this kingdom; for I
will lay my life at the stake, that if this work shall be well carried, there
is ten times as much riches clearly given to the Commonwealth present and
future in this little book, as all the Inhabitants and their Predecessors
have ever paid to Church and King in their days since it was a Kingdom: for
partly by the prevention of loss in the blasting and mildewing of your Corn,
and in the preservation of your Sheep from rotting, and partly by the benefit
of all other my Inventions and Improvements duly practiced, there will arise
again inestimabe and infinite, not to be exhausted by time: so praying to God
the Creator of all, that it may do as much good as I intended, I humbly take
my leave, desiring your prayers only for me and my posterity; for I crave
none of your riches.

The Postscript.
AS for faults in my Copy, I see a thousand my self; and make no question but
that others will epsy many more; yet in regard that my conceit tells me,
that though Cicero, and Demosthenes had laid their heads together in the
opening of it; yet every one would expound the same to their best advantage;
which being a thing that I desire, I will therefore trouble my self no more
about it, but commit it to the Worlds censure in its rude vesture; and I must
needs confess that my own fancy has a little withdrawn me from publishing
all that I know in these affairs, being conceited that it may prejudice me
hereafter, for that Nature will not show her self naked to any blabtongue; in
the beholding of whose beauty is my chief delectation. I have as good a mind
to it, as to any temerarious enterprise that ever I took in hand, to try my
cunning to strike off at one stroke the head of that ougly monster,
Covetousness, by taking all danger of future want clear away, for then none
but fools would be covetous; but the danger that two worse heads, viz. Pride
and Luxury would spring up in the room, stays me: therefore I not knowing
so well how to cut off those heads, will rest my self awhile, waiting with
patience, to see the success of these my labors. It may be these things
published already will be some good means to metamorphise that monster really
into good Husbandry and godly providence; under whose habit he loves so well
to hide his ugly face; which in my opinion, is the surest way for the well
ordering of the Universe: for as it is holden a frivolous thing to hoord up
Snow in Friesland, where there is never like to be any want thereof; so would
it be holden, here to hoord up riches, being nothing but congealed Air, or
vapors which are not likely ever to be wanting here, if the art of doing the
same the easiest way should be fully discovered; for then not only
covetousness would cease, but also providence would be endangered to be thrust
out of the School, which is inconvenient; here is maintenance in this book
discovered for many Ages, though Wars should cease and people should increase
marvelously; yet at length there will be jarring and jangling again, when the
people grow too numerous for their maintenance, and then if God be not pleased
to teach them new Improvements, they will do as they do now, viz. like as
when ten dogs have ten bones, every one lies down quietly and eats his
bone; but if there be but nine bones for the ten dogs, then the odd dog
sets all the rest together by the ears: so will it be with men when their
food grows too short for their number; and this is manifest by the former
practices of the World: for when they had peace and plenty, and were not
scanted of food and maintenance, then they builded Churches, and did many
worthy works; but when jarring and jangling came through want thereof, they
grew so far off from building of Churches, that they would scarcely repair
the old ones; and did as they do now, spend their thrift in mischievous
contentions.

But that I will not altogether feed the World with Tantalus his Apples, I
will give them one bit in this manner: when these Inventions and Improvements
contained in this Book shall be stretched to the highest, and will serve no
longer for the maintenance of the numerous increase of people; then let them
begin a new lesson: and whereas in former time it was an excellent
Improvement to teach Horses and Oxen to do the works of men, by which men
were spared to be Princes, Governors, and Officers in Commonwealths; so then
there being no need to increase the number of those; let the new increase of
people be employed in spade-worke, by which means every Acre of land may be
improved several ways to be four times as good as now the common way;
besides that, the ground which now Horses and Oxen do eat up, may then be
improved in like manner, for the maintenance of men; whereby they may live
well, and not have any intolerable slavery; for that there need issue but
little out of every ones labors to Church and King by reason of their
wonderful number.

FINIS.
