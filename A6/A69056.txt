SERMONS of Master John Calvin, upon the Book of JOB.

Translated out of French by Arthur Golding.

IMPRINTED BY LVCAS HARISON AND GEORGE BISHOP. 1574

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND HIS SPECIAL GOOD LORD, ROBERT EARL OF LEYCESTER,
BARON OF DENBYGH, KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER, ONE OF THE
QVEENES MAJESTY'S MOST HOnorable privy Counsel, etc. Grace, mercy, peace and
truth in Christ.
AL men can skill to complain with Job, that this short life of ours is
fraught with many miseries, afflictions, and adversities, and very experience
shows it to be so. For we see daily in others and feel also in ourselves,
the continual perils and crosses that beseege us and perce us to the heart,
even from the time of our birth to the giving up of our last gasp. We find
them painful, irksome and tediouse to us, and therefore we would feign shift
them of. But in the mean while, do we look up to the hand that smites us? do
we consider the causes why they be laid upon us? do we seek out the ends
whereunto they tend? or have we an eye to the fruits and effects of them? Nay
rather degenerating into a kind of brutishness and hanging our heads groueling
down too the groundward, we either imagine them to grow out of the earth, or
impute them to the influence of the skies, or father them upon fortune, or
attribute them unto men, or wite them upon the unhappiness of the time, or
tie them to the place, or finally stand amazed at the afflictions themselves,
surmizing any thing rather than the truth, as who should say that God either
could not or would not govern all things by his only will and providence,
which is as much as to deny that there is any God at all. By reason whereof we
seeldome or never enter into ourselves to consider our own state and the
inestimable goodness of our God, too think how justly we have deserved too
be scourged for our sins, and how fatherly he deals with us in clensing
the corruption of our infected nature, and in showing the perfectness of his
mighty power in these frail earthen vessels of our weak and mortal bodies.
None of these things do we take heed of: and therefore much less do we look
so far before us, as too consider that the end why God scourges us, is to
bring us back again to him by repentance, that he might show himself a
merciful father too us, and heap up his benefits and graciouse gifts upon us,
too our greater comfort. We consider not that the end of worldly afflictions
is always happy too such as fear him, and that the short enduring of he
troubles of this life, procures an inestimable weight of glory in the life
too come. Finally we consider not that God being our maker and governor, has
by good right a sovereign dominion over us and all other his creatures, too
order and dispoze us at his good will and pleasure, and that the same his doing
is wrought by incomprehensible power, wisdom, and rightfulnesse, so as there
cannot justly any fault or blame be found in any of his proceedings. By means
whereof it comes too pass, that if he give us ease and prosperity, we be so
far off from thankfulness for the same, that we mount up into pride, and not
only step forth to disdeyning and skorning of those to whom he has given less
ability: but also proceed too the utter forgetting and despising of his
majesty, as though we had all things of our selves, and were not beholding
too him for any thing. And if he touch us either in our goods, body, name or
otherwiise too our mislyking: then either we storm, chafe and fret against
him, (specially if we see not an apparent cause of his doings) wherein we
blaspheme him by accusing him indirectly of vnrightuousenesse: or else we fall
into despair, thinking it impossible for us to escape out of the present
danger, wherein we bereue him of his cheef glory, which is to show mercy by
preserving the afflicted, and by raising up such as are under foot. Thus (as
much as in us is) we utterly shake off his yoke, taking him to be another our
father nor our God. Heerby it is manifest, that whereas every of us has the
name of patience in his mouth, few know what right patience is, and in manner
none at all do put it in ure. Some think it to be a stout bearing out of
adversities without admitting any greef or hartbyting for the same. And
othersome take it too be a yielding too the present affliction upon hope to
outweare it by length of time. But none of these twain is the true patience,
which is allowed of God, and meet too be in a Christen man, as will appear
too the diligent reader of this present woork. For the one is but a lingering
in distress without certainty of good issue, and the other is but a dulling
and amazing of the senses, too make man's nature more stubborn against Gods
hand, which is too stubborn of it self alredye. God therefore knowing the
frowardness of mankind, and minding either too bring us home too himself or
too leave us utterly vnexcuzab(...) does in this book purposely above all
other parts of the holy Scripture, both defend his own Majesty in
mainteyning his ryghtfull soueraintie over all his creatures: and also set
down a perfect pattern of patien(...) containing the due obedience and
subjection of the creature too his maker. These are the two cheef poin(...)
whereupon the whole book of Job is grounded. In the discourse whereof, there is
showed the incessant d(...)rousenesse and indeuer of Satan too bring man too
destruction: and man's inability too stand against hi(...) without the
special providence and protection of God. Whereof, the first warns us to
stand always v(...) pon our guard, that we be not surprised by our so subtle
and cruel enemy: and the other bereeueth us of a(...) selftrust, driving us
too seek our refuge and succor no where else but in God. And too the intent
we may the more willingly suffer all crosses, and take all things in good
worth at Gods hand: it is showed that God never forsakes us in our troubles,
but vpholdeth and maynteyneth us even in our vttermoste extremities, by a
secret and incomprehensible woorking, not always seen of the world, nor
presently perceived of ourselves: and that his afflicting of us is not for any
hatred or ill will of purpose too destroy us, but of a fatherly loving
kyndnesse, too make us know better both our selves and him, which is the
sovereign goodness and perfect felicity: and therefore that he always gives
them a happy end, too our singular welfare and salvation, making us too
triumph victoriously over sin, death, hell, the devil, damnation, our selves
and all the assaults of the world, through the trial of our faith, which by
that means becomes more fine and preciouse than gold. Again, too the end
that the wicked may not think themselves too have sped the better by Gods long
forbearing of them, and by their hardening of their hearts against his manaces
and warnings: it is told them, that the longer that God winketh at them, the
heauyer his hand will be upon them, and that whereas these temporal
afflictions are but sweet chastizements and assurances of Gods inestimable
love, and of eternal reward too the Godly: they are too the others sharp
punishments in this world, and authentical warrants of Gods utter displeasure,
and as it were foretastes of their own unavoidable damnation in the world too
come. Thus is the pride of our rebelliouse nature beaten down on all sides,
that by learning true humility, we might receive the comfort which God gives
too his chozen. Many other notable doctrines are diversely interlaced: as, that
Gods wonderful working in his creatures and in the order of nature, ought to
lead us too the knowledge of the creator: That we ought not too be
inquisitiue of Gods secrets further than he lists too utter them unto us,
nor negligent in seeking so far forth as be shows them: That his only
word is the absolute and only sufficient rule, too direct the religion and
lives of all men in alcaces and all respects: That nothing in all the whole
world happens by casualtie, but all things are guided and governed too their
appointed ends by the fore determinate purpose and providence of God: That man
being corrupted by original sin in the fall of Adam, has not any entrance
of reconciliation, or any continuance of atonement with God, but by the
mediator, through the only free mercy and gift of God: and finally (with
innumerable other like) that there is no difference of the Jew or Gentile,
Greek or Barbarouse, learned or unlearned, high or low, or of any other
state or person before God, but that whosoever serves him faithfully and
unfeignedly, the same is accepted of him as his dear child, notwithstanding
that he seem not to be within the bounds of the visible church. Hereunto are
added the duties of all degrees, states, and callings, with a perfect pattern
of a pure and uncorrupted life, specially in those whom God has advanced too
honor, wealth or authority, to the intent they should be as it were bright
mirrours of Gods Majesty upon earth, by sheading forth the light of their
virtues too the good example of others, in preserving the commonwealth by
justice and policy, and in maynteyning Gods Religion. For it is manifest that
Job was not of the meaner sort of men, but comparable (both in riches and
authority) with the greatest men in his time, and far above the most of
those that bear greatest port and countenance in these days. Therefore unto
all such as love the true nobility, (which descends not too posterity by
right of inheritance, nor is purchaced by riches, favor, or any worldly
means, but is the free gift of God, consisting in the excellency of the mind
of the possesser, and not in the opinion of the variable multitude) it shall
be very good too consider, not only the general commendacion which the holy
Ghost gives unto Job, in that he calls him a sound man, even such a one
as feared God and eschewed evil: but also the particular protestations which
Job himself makes in the xxix. and.xxxi. chapters, and in the xxv. verse of
the xxx. chapter of this book. For there in defense of his innocence against
the wrongful surmises of his friends, he sets down xvij. points, whereof
although some do fitly agree too the common life of all Christians: yet do they
all link wholly together intoo the nature of true nobility, and belong
chiefly too such as are of most pre-eminence: and without them no man can
justly account himself too be noble or honorable. The first point is the comely
and reverend gravity of his person, wherthrough he was feared of his
inferiors, honored of his equals, esteemed of his superiors, and loved of
all good and honest men. The second is his pitifulness toward the distressed,
as well in feeling inward compassion and greef for their miseries, as also in
comforting, cheering, succoring and helping them. The third is his stoutnesse
and vigilantnesse in executing of justice, so as he ministered right to every
man indifferentely without respect of persons, boulting out the truth of
things that were cloked or unknown, punishing open enormities though they were
not presented nor complained of, and himself pleading and maynteyning the
rightful caces of the ignorant and such as wanted ability too help
themselves. The fourth is the undefiled chastity of his body proceeding from
the chastnesse of a pure heart, so as he did not cast any lewd or wanton
fancy toward any man's wife or daughter. The fifth is his plain dealing, in
utter absteyning from all deceyt, craftiness and guyle. The sixth is his
steadfastness, in that he could not be allured by the intycement of his eyes,
nor provoked by flattery, too step aside from the truth, or too commit any
unseemly thing. The seventh is his gentle clemency, in suffering his bond
servants and underlings to reason their caces with him when they thought
themselves wronged, and in yielding them right even against himself. The eight
is his speedy dispatching of men's suits, so as he suffered them not too
pyne with long lingering. The nynth is his liberality in maynteyning such as
were destitute of living. The tenth is his abstinence in for bearing too do
any man wrong, hurt or hinderance, notwithstanding that he might escape
uncontrolled for it. The eleventh is his hating of covetousness, in that no
wealth nor riches could infect his heart. The twelfth is his stayednesse, in that
no abundance could make him proud to disdeyne others, or to set more store by
himself, or to have the less care and regard of God. The thirteenth is the
nobleness of his heart, in that he was so far from rejoicing at the fall of
his enemies, that he rather pitied their miseries, and could not by any means
be persuaded too be revenged of them, or to speak evil of them. The
foureteenth is his hospitality, in giving interteynement too strangers and
such as wanted releef. The fifteenth is his lowelinesse, in that he was
contented to hear of his faults, and cloked not his sin when he had done
amiss, but suffered him self too be reproved even of his underlings. The
sixteenth is his just and vpryght dealing with his Tennants, in paying them
truly for whatsoever he took of them, and in not oppressing them with
greeuouse rentes, incommes, or services. And finally (which is the very
welspring of all virtue, the moother of all true nobility, and (as ye would
say) the very lock and key of all good conversation among men) he protests
that he had God always before his eyes, or (which is all one) that he was of a
pure, sound, and vncorrupt Religion. For too fear God, is not too be afraid
of him as the bondsman is of his Lord, the Trewand of his Schoolemayster, or the
thief of the gallows: but too conceive such an inward reverence of him, by
reason of his justice, mercy, wisdom, power, providence, and
ryghtuousenesse, as too think him worthy of all honor and obedience, and
too yield the same willingly and heartily unto him, so as we would be loathe and
sorry too offend him, even though we might be sure too escape unpunished. The
only means too bring us whereunto, is the right knowing of his holy word and
the steadfast cleaving thereunto, without swaruing one way or other, and without
taking leave too do any thing that is not warranted there. This fear of God
caused Job too draw his eyesight always inward, and to look only unto Gods
will, not regarding either what his own affection and lusts stirred him to,
or what his power, riches, and authority enabled him to do, or what any
outward occasions and oportunities moved him to, or what the intycementes of
the world and the persuasions of men allured him to do, or finally, what fame
or infamy, gain or loss, love or hatred, or any thing else provoked him to
do, but what he knew ought too be done of right, equity, reason, and
conscience. For when men's eyes (I meene their minds and wits, which are in
deed the very eyes or lamps of light too the whole man) are occupied
outwardly: either they rushe forth into all lewdness and become utterly
wicked, like wild horses that have cast their ryders, and run looce
withersoeuer fury inforceth them: and the greater that such persons are, the
more harm do they both by deed and by example: or else they be dazeled with
the glittering gloss of vainglorie, accompanied with fear of punishment or
hope of reward, and so finally fall into the sound sleep of senseless
hypocrisy, doing all things in obedience of their own will, and not of Gods
will. These later sort are tolerable in the active and civil life, and
oftentimes do great good both too their neighbors, and to the whole common
weal, but never too themselves, because their good doing springs not from
the right root, which is the hearty obedience of God, ne tends too the right
end which is the only glory of God: and therefore they may well be likened too
the shipwrights that builded the Ark of Noah, and yet perished themselves in
the flud. But the other sort do good another too themselves nor to others,
except it be against their wills, when God makes them an ensample of his
rightful justice, by giving them the due reward of their wickedness. Howbeeit
forasmuchas these things together with all others points before rehearsed in
this Epistle, are largely and substa^tially discussed by the faithful and
learned servant of God Master John Calvin in these Sermons of his upon the
book of Job, and it were an unseemly thing for an inexpert scholar to write
the battle of Troy again after Homer, as the Proverb says: I will not be
tediouse in withholding your L. long from the reading of the Sermons
themselves. Nevertheless I have presumed upon your L. patience to set down
this foresaid breef abstract of this woork, to the intent your honor and all
other noble men (to whom chiefly under our most graciouse sovereign Lady
Queen Elizabeth, the care of Gods Religion and of this common weal belongs)
beholding the groundwoorke and as it were the platform of so many excellent
matters, and thereupon considering the goodness, necessarinesse, and
profitablenesse thereof to the whole church of God, and too the furtherance of
each man's salvation, might like the better of the book, (as I doubt not but
that the oftener your L. shall read any part of it, the better you will like
it) and by your wellyking cause it too be the more embraced of others too their
singular comfort, edifying and welfare. For although the books of holy
Scripture take no authority or credit of man, but have a singular kind of
spirit, life, and woorkfulnesse in themselves: Yet notwithstanding forasmuchas
it is incident to the nature welneere of all inferioures, too regard or neglect
even the best things, according as their superiors seem to make more or less
account of them, and when godly and well disposed men have taken peines to open
the Scriptures too the understanding and capacity of the people, their doings
and writings are oftentimes more slightly and negligently received than they
deserve too be: The wellyking of such noble men and magistrates as God has
moreover innobled with the knowledge of his Gospel, is a great furtherance to
the good accepting of both of them among all inferior degrees, and God
looks to be so glorified at their hands. Wherefore I humbly commend this
woork, together with my translation thereof, unto your good L. accustomed
favor, whereof I have had so often trial heretofore in accepting of diverse
woorks of mine, though containing good, commendable, and godly matters, yet not
of like substance, importance and travel unto this. And my trust is that your
goodness, both in respect of the newyere, (under the benefit whereof I am
the bolder to present it as a token of my bound duty and thankful mind
toward your honor,) and also in respect of the woork it self, (which being
aduizedly red will doubtless yield much more fruit than can be expressed in
words:) will bear with my faults and imperfections where any shall occur.
For although my conscience bear me witness that I have dealt plainly and
faithfully in all respects, and not stepped aside willingly in any point from
the beaten path: and although some may think it strange that he which
aduentureth upon so great and weighty woorks, should in any wise seek excuse
of ignorance or oversight: yet notwithstanding forasmuchas I know the general
infirmity of man's nature, how easy it is too slip unawares, and this woork
is the first of any great weight that ever I translated out of the French
^oong to be published, I crave it as a special favor to my self, and as a
benefit to the Church of God, that where any fault shall be found, I may be
made privy to them, and I will be as forward as the forwardest to amend them.
Thus beseeching God too grant your L. to see many happy and prosperouse
newyeeres upon this Realm, and upon the Church of God furthered and advanced
by your good counsel and indeuer, to the increace of your own honor both
here and in the world to come, I humbly take my leave. Written the last of
December. 1573.

Your honors most humble always to command, Arthur Golding.

TO AL GENTLE READERS, GREETING.
IF ever men needed too learn what patience is: surely the state of this
present time ought to lead yea and too dravve them to it. For if we look
well about us, we shall find that there has not bin almost any Realm or
country, wherein God has not uttered great scourges. If ye demand the
cause: it is evident, so as even the blind (as ye would say) may see it. Let
the old men that are now alive consider the wicked things which they have
seen committed commonly, since they were first able to remember, unto this
day: and must they not needs say (as it was said of the time of the general
flud) that all flesh has corrupted his vvayes upon earth, that all is full of
extorcion and outrage, and that such as bear the name of Christians do (as
says Saint Peter) fulfill the way of the heathen, by living in
shamefulnesse, pride, lechery, drunkenness, gluttony, quaffing and
abominable idolatry? But like as it is good to know the causes of the
adversities that happen, to the intent that men may the better bethink
themselves, to amend as well publicly as privately: so is it right necessary
to be ^ensed with true patience, that we sink not under the burden when
Gods scourges continue long upon us, for even that also is one of the points of
the amendment which he requires of us. Nevertheless, it is a thing that
cannot be learned else where than in Gods word. For although the ancient
Philosophers and other wise men of the world have spoken of it and given
certain rules of it: yet was there never any man found that for all his
learning thereof in their school, could shevve that he knevve what it is at
the need and when it comes to the putting of it in ure. And in very deed
even those that took upon them (as I said) to teach others, besides that their
doctrine was imperfect itself, most commonly wist not where they were when
it came to the point that they should have practiced it in dangers: and those
that did best, shevved I vvot not what a resemblance of patience, which being
more nearly considered was clean contrary. Therefore not without cause does
the Apostle saint Paul send us too the whole scripture to learn patience
and comfort: according also as in another text he says, that the end of the
scripture is to make a man perfect and ready in all good works. But yet among
the books of Scripture, the book of JOB is commended to us by name for that
purpose by the Apostle Saint James. And the very bare reading of the story,
shows sufficiently that it is not with out cause. Nevertheless, it is not
to be doubted, but that the help of a good expounder is very profitable even
to the skilfullest, and likewise necessary in common, for the better knovving
and understanding of the diversity of the matters, and for the furtherance of
a man's own profiting in the doctrine that is contained in it. That is it
which has moved certain goodmen, to put forth his year. The Sermons of the
faithful servant of God and his Church Master John Calvin, upon the book of
Job, notvvithstanding that he himself which is the author of them, and at
whose mouth they were gathered, vvithstoode it as much as he could, according
as he has done with his other Sermons. Furthermore, although other me^ of
knowledge have traveled to give a more easy understanding of this book by
their vvrytings, yet notvvithsta^ding, besides that these Sermons are in the
common French tongue: his manner of handling the doctrine thereof is so plain
and well framed to the capacity of the grossest sort (as ye would term
them) howbeit without omitting any needful things, and moreover so applied
one way and other to the behoof of the present time, that surely all such as
intend too judge uprightly and vvithou^malice, shall find good help here,
vvhervvith too content themselves. For proof vvherof, it is not now needful
to show a sum of the book, or of the chief points of doctrine and of the
use of the same diverse vvays. For besides that he shall better find it here
and there in reading his Sermons: the first conteyneth a sufficient discourse,
and yet very short to be easly borne in mind. Howsoever the case stand, if
those that read the whole, be folk that have already left Idolatry, and
given themselves to the doctrine of the Gospel: they shall find here
vvhervvith to further themselves* still more and more in the knowledge of God
and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and specially too strengthen themselves with
right patience in their adversities. Or if they be such as have not yet known
or listed to discern the true Religion, to frame themselves thereafter by
leaving the false Religions, what occasion so ever has let the^, yet being
warned by the doctrine of this book so chavved to them as they shall find
it, and chiefly being vvakened by Gods extraordinary judgment in Jobs
person, which they shall see there laid forth and declared at length: they
shall be prepared to bethink themselves better, and to take profit of the
great number of adversities which are seen novvadaies in the world, and of
far greater vvhervvith it is very likely that God threatens men for the
great and open despizing of his Gospel. For although the things that are
happened this year, as well in his punishments laid upon the wicked sort and
the enemies of Christ, as in his chastizements laid upon the faithful, be
very terrible: Yet notvvithstanding forasmuchas very fevve amend, and
contrariwise most men grovve more spiteful in fighting against Jesus Christ,
and some having begone to do well vvex rechelesse again, yea and viterly
turn away: there is none other thing too be looked for, but that he will
continue to smite still. So then, the first sort shall have to consider, that
if Job being a sound and rightuouse man that feared God and eschevved evil,
(according as it is witnessed of him) and living so long time before the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and the great light of the Gospel, was
handled so straungely at Gods hand who loved him: and that the same was too
the end that his patience should be tried: it is no marvel though we now in
these latter days, under the reign of Jesus Christ, have now and then many
crosses to bear, and be for our peculiar faults chastized with strype upon
strype at the hand of the living God, who notvvithstanding loves us, for the
serving of whom according to his word, we be turned from ydolls unto him,
as says Saint Paul to the Thessalonians. The second sort shall have to
think and bethink, yea and to chavv as their cudde, that if God do so shake
therodde in his hand over those that are already reclamed to his sure, to
bridle them and make them walk right froward throughout: and that if he have
gone that way to work with Job as is reported here, who notvvithstanding
had been as an Angel in the world, in indeuering to do his duty to God and
man: What is likely to light upon themselves, if they do not in general amend
and utterly forsake their foolish, shameful, and wicked idolatry, and
particularly the manifest contempt of God vvherof they be full, living at this
day as Epicures and Atheists: and moreover, some their vvhordome and bauderie,
some their drunkenness and gluttony, (according as there be some countries
that are specially given thereunto) some their ambitiouse pomp, some their
vain vvorldlinesse, some their snatching and extortion as well pryuate as
public, and othersome their cruelty and insatiable desire too shed man's
blud, in spite of all laws and to the confusion of all civil order among
men? They shall (say I) have this little word of Saint Peter's to vvey, which
ought to astonish the^ more than all the thunderclappes that ever rattled in
the air: that is to wit, that if chastizeme^t begin at the house of God, and
at those which are the true Christians: what shall the end of these be,
which rebel against Gods Gospel? and if the rightuouse do hardly escape,
where shall the wicked and sinful appear? Behold the thing that all the good
servants of God, and all faithful preachers of the Gospel do brotherly pray
for at this day, as men have done hertofore. Behold the thing that all the
little flocks of the reformed churches dispersed here and there do pray for,
behold, the thing that even Jesus Christ (as ye would say) in his own
person prays for: is that they may by him be reconcyled to God, and receive
his grace in such wise, as it may not be in vain. And it is to be hoped that
God of his great mercy vvil yet notvvithstanding bring many of that sort too
such change, as he will make them true and earnest followers of the Gospel,
as he has done often heretofore. Notvvithstanding, if any or many of the^ being
so entreated for Jesus Christ's sake, do harden themselves: let such understand that they shall not escape Gods hand at the last day, and it may be that
they shall feel it yet sooner too their great confusion. For it is he whose
pre-eminence and none others is in controversy at this day: and which shall
of a truth get the upper hand of all his enemies early or late, whatsoever
betyde. He is vvilling to have pity upon his creatures, and by word he gives
comfort and patience to all such as are pinched: but specially he comfort
those that are already under his banner, granting them to have peace in him,
although they have none in the world.

Amen.

FINIS.
The Sermons of Master John Calvin upon the book of Job.
The first Sermon upon the first Chapter.
THere was in the land of Hus a man named Job, sound and upright, fearing
God, and vvithdravving himself from evil.


THE BETTER TO PROFIT ourselves by that which is contained in this present
book, first and foremost it behooves us to understand the sum of it. For
the story here written, shows us how we be in Gods hand, and that it lies
in him to determine of our life, and to dispose of the same according to his
good pleasure, and that it is our duty to submit ourselves unto him with all
humbleness and obedience: that undertake the evil case (that is to wit, that
God does always punish men according to the measure of their sins) have
goodly and holy sentences, and there is nothing in their whole talk which
would not entice us to receive it as if the holy Ghost himself had uttered it.
For it is plain truth: they be the grounds of religion: they treat of Gods
providence: they treat of his justice: they treat of men's sins. Thus see
we a doctrine which we must receive without gaynsaying: and yet the drifte
of it is evil, namely for that these men labor thereby to There was a man in
the land of Hus, named Job, a sound and upright man, and fearing God, and
withdrawing him self from evil. We know not, neither can we guess in what
time Job lived: saving that a man may perceive he was of great antiquity:
howbeit that some of the Jews have bin of opinion, that Moses was the author
of this book: and that he did set it as a loking glass before the people, to
the intent that the children of Abraham (of whose race he himself came) might
know that God had showed favor to others that were not of the same line, and
thereupon be ashamed if they themselves walked not purely in the fear of God,
seeing that this man (which had not the mark of Gods covenant, nor was
circumcised, but was a Panim) had behaved himself so well. But forasmuch as
this is not certain: we must leave it in suspense. Nevertheless let us take
that which is out of all doubt: that is to wit, that the holy ghost has
endited this book, to the end that the Jews should know how God has had
people too serve him, albeit that they have not been separated out from the
rest of the world: and that although they had not the sign of circumcision,
yet notwithstanding they walked in all pureness of conversation. By the
knowledge whereof, the Jews have had occasion to be so much the more diligent
to keep the law of God: and since he had voutsafed them such favor and
prerogative, as to gather them out from among all other strange nations, they
ought to dedicate themselves wholly unto him. Also a man may perceive by the
book of Ezechiel, that the name of Job was renoumed among the people of
Israel, for in his.xiiij. chap. we see it is said, that if Noe, Job, and
Daniel were among the people that should perish, they should save no mo men's
lives but their own, and all the rest of the people should be destroyed. See
how the Prophet speaks of these three men, as of such as were known and
renoumed among the Jews, as I have touched alredie. And thereby we see what
the intent of the holy ghost is: namely that the Jews should have a mirror and
pattern whereby to know how they ought to keep the doctrine of salvation that
was given unto them, seeing that this man which was of a strange nation, had
so kept himself in such purity. And that is the chief thing that we have to
remember concerning the name that is set down here, when he says that he was
of the land of Hus. True it is, that some men do place this land far eastward.
Nevertheless in the fourth chapter of the Lame^tations of Jeremy, the same
word Hus is put for a part of Edom. We know that the Edomites are descended
of Esau: and true it is that they also had circumcision. Howbeit forasmuch as
they were strayed away from Gods church, they had it no more as the sign of
his covenant. Therefore if we take Job to have bin of this land of Hus, then was
he an Edomite, that is to say, of the line of Esau. And we know how the
Prophet says, that although Esau and Jacob were natural brethren, borne both
at one burden: yet God of his mere goodness choze Jacob, rejecting Esau, and
cursing him with all his whole lineage. Lo how the Prophet in speaking to
magnify Gods mercy toward the Jews, tells them that he choze them not for
any worthynesse that was in their persons, considering that he had rejected
Jacobs eldest brother, to whom the birthrith belonged, and had chozen him that
was the younger and inferior. So then, although that this man was borne of Esaus
line: yet notwithstanding we see how sou^dly he lived, and how he served god
not only by upright co^uersatio^ and equity among men: but also in pure
religion, which he defiled not with the idolatries and superstitions of the
infidels. As touching the name of Job, some interpret it to signify weeping or
wayling. And other some take it for an utter enemy, not such a one as he
hates, but such a one as is as it were a white for men to shoot at. There is no
cause why we should dout whether this man (whose country is so marked out, and
whose name is expressed) were or no, or lived or no, or whether the things that
are written here, did come to pass or no: so as we should think it to be but
a He was a sound man. This word Sound in the scripture is taken for a
playnnesse, when there is no point of sayning, cou^terfayting, or hypocrisy in
a man, but that he shows himself the same outwardly that he is inwardly, and
specially when he has no starting holes to shift himself from God, but lays
open his heart, and all his thoughts and affections, so as he desires nothing
but to consecrate and dedicate himself wholly unto God. The said word has
also been translated perfect, as well by the Greeks as by the Latins. But for
as much as the word perfect, has afterward been misconstrued: it is much
better for us to use the word Sound. For many ignorante persons not knowing
how the said perfection is too be taken, have thought thus: Behold here a
man that is called perfect, and therefore it follows, that it is possible for
us to have perfection in oureselues, even during the time that we walk in this
present life. But they deface the grace of God, whereof we have need
continually. For even they that have lived most uprightly, must have recourse
to Gods mercy: and except their sins be forgyuen them, and that God uphold
them, they must needs al perish. So then, although that they which have used
the word perfect, have meant well: yet notwithstanding for as much as there
have been some that have wrested it too a contrary sense, (as I have said) let
us keep still the word Sound. Then look upon Job, who is called Sound. And
how so? It is because there was no hypocrisy nor dissimulation, nor any
doubleness of heart in him. For when the scripture means to set down the
vice, that is contrary too this virtue of Sou^dnesse: it says Heart and Heart,
meaning thereby a double heart. Let us mark then, that first of all this title
is attributed unto Job, to show that he had a pure and simple mind, that he
bare not two faces in one whood, nor served God by halues, but labored to give
himself wholly unto him. True it is that as now we can not be so sound as to
attain to the mark as were too be wished. For as touching those that follow
the right way, although they go on forward limping: yet are they so lame, that
they dragge their legs and their wings after them. The case then stands so
with us, so long as we be wrapped in this mortal body, that until such time
as God have quit^ discharged us of all the miseries whereunto we be subject:
there shall never be any perfect soundness in us, as I have said before. But
yet for all that, it behooves us nevertheless to come to the said playnnesse,
and too give over all counterfaytnesse and leasing. And further, let us note,
that the true holiness begins within us, in so much that if we show all the
fairest countenances in the world before men, and that our life be so well
guyded that every man shall commend us: yet if we have not this playnnesse and
soundness before God, all is right naught. For it behooves that the fountain
be first pure, and afterward that the streams that run out of it be pure
also. Otherwise the water may well be clear: and yet nevertheless be
bitter, or else have some other filthy corruption in it. Therefore it behooves
us to begin always with this text, That God will be served in spirit, and in
truth: for he is a spirit, and he regards the truth of the heart, as it is
said in the fifth of Hieremie. Then ought we to learn first and formoste, to
frame our hearts to the obeying of God. For after that Job has been reported
to have been sound, it is also said of him that He was upright. This
uprightness is meant of the life that he led, which is as it were the fruit of
the said root which the holy ghost He feared God, yea, that he was a man
which feared God, and withdrew himself from evil. Now seeing that Job had
had the praise of keeping right and equity among me^: it behooved him also to
walk before god: for without that, the rest is nothing worth. True it is (as I
have said before) that we ca^ not live with our neybors to do harm to none, and
to do good to al: unless we have an eye unto god. For as for the^ that follow
their own nature, albeit that they be endued with goodly virtues, (for so will it
seem) yet are they ^uertake^ with self love, and it is nothing else but
vayngloriousnes, or some other such respect which thrusts them forward: in so
much that all the show of virtue which appeered in the^ is marred thereby. But
although we can not have the said uprightness without the fearing of God yet
notwithstanding, the serving of God, and the regarding of our neybors ar two
several things, in likewise as god has distinguished them in his law, at such
time as it pleased him to have the^ written out in the two tables. The^ let us
bear in mind, that like as heretofore under the word uprightness, the holy
Ghost meant to show after what manner Job lived among men: so also when he
says that Job feared God, he means to set out the religion that was in him.
And hereby we be warned, that if we will frame our life aright, we must first
have an eye unto god, and then to our neibors. I say we must have an eye unto
god, to give our selves over unto him, and to yield him his due honor: and we
must have an ey to our neybors, to discharge our selves of our duty toward
the^, according to that we be commanded to help them, and to live in equity
and uprightness: and finally (forasmuch as god has knit us each to other) that
every man study to employ his whole ability to the common commodity of al.
Thus ye see how the case stands with us in having of an eye both to God and
me^, for the well ordering of our life: for he that looks on himself, is sure
that he has nothing but vanity in him. For if a man were able to order his
life in such wise, as he might seem faultlesse to the world; and yet
notwithstanding, god disliked him: what shall he gain by his ouerlaboring of
himself to walk in such wise as al me^ might magnify him? As to godward he is
nothing else but uncleanness: and needs must this sentence which is written in
S. Luke be verifyed, namely that the thing which is most high and excellent
before me^, is abominable before God. Then let us fearing of God, here is
comprehended al religion: that is to wit, all the service and honor which the
creatures owe unto their God. And surely it was a right excellent virtue in
Job to fear God after that manner, considering how the whole world was turned
aside from the right way. When we hear this, we perceive that although we
live among the veriest naugtypackes in the whole world, we shall be utterly
inexcusable, feared God. In what country? It was not in Iewry, it was not in
the City of Jerusalem, it was not in the Temple: but it was in a defiled that
he withdrew himself from evil. For we see that the cause why Job overcame all
lettes and incounters that might hinder him from the serving of God, and from
living uprightly among men, was for that he had a stay of himself: for he knew
right well, that if he had taken liberty to do like other men, he should
have been given to al vices, so as he should have been the enemy of God. Job
then walked not so in the fear of God and in such plain dealing and
soundness, without great store of incounters, or without the Devils heauing at
him to overthrow him and to cast him into the filthiness of the whole world:
but be withdrew himself from evil, that is to say, he withhild himself.
What must we do then? Although we be in the Church of God, yet we see great
abundance of evils, and (howsoever it happens) there shall never be such
plainness and pureness, but we shall be mingled with store of skorners and
unthrifts which are firebronds of hell and deadly plagues to infect all me^.
Therefore it behooves us to be very ware, seeing there are so many
stumblingblocks and so great loocenesse, whereby to train us forthwith unto
unthriftiness. What remedy then? Let us withdraw our selves from evil: that
is to say, let us fight against such assaults after the example of Job: and
when we see abundance of vices and corruptions reign in the world, albeit that
we be feign to be intermedled with them, yet let us not be defiled with them,
nor say as commonly men are wont, namely that we must needs do as other men
do: but rather let us take counsel by Jobs example to withdraw ourselves from
evil, and to retire in such sort, as Satan may not be able to make us to
yield for all the temptations that he shall cast before us: but that we may
suffer God to clenze us from all our filthiness and infection (according as he
has promised us in the name of Jesus Christ,) until he have pulled us quite
out of the soil and uncleanness of this world, to match us with his Angels,
and to make us parttakers of that endless felicity, for the which we must
labor here continually.

Therefore let us present our selves before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgeme^t of our sins, praying him to give us such feeling, that in
acknowledging our own poorness, we may always have recourse to the remedy
that he gives us: which is, that he pardoning al our offenses, will so govern
us by his holy spirit, that although Satan be named the prince of the world,
and have such scope among men, that the more part of them are so perverted as
we see: yet notwithstanding we may not be harried away with them: but rather
that our good God will hold us back under his obeisance, and that we may
know the thing whereunto we be called, so as we may follow it, and maintain
the brotherlinesse which he has ordey^ned among us, so linking our selves one
with another, as we may desire nothing, but to procure the welfare of our
neybors, to the end we may be settled more and more in his grace which he has
granted us by our Lord Jesus Christ, until he make us to receive the fruit of
it in his heavenly glory: and that it may please him etc.

The second Sermon upon the first Chapter.
2. And he had seven sons borne unto him, and three daughters.

3. And he had a great substance of Cattle: to vvitte, seven thousand
Sheep, three thousand Camelles, five hundred yoke of Oxen, five hundred she
Asses, and a great householde, in so much that he surmounted all them of the
East.

4. And his sons went and made feasts at their houses, every man his day,
and they called their three Sisters also to eat and drink with them.

5. When they had made an end of their feasting, Job sent for his children and
sanctified them: and rising up betymes in the morning, offered sacrifices
according to the number of them: for he said, It may be that my children have
sinned, and have not blissed the Lord in their hearts. And thus did Job every
day.


YEsterday we heard the praises which the holy Ghost gave unto Job, not so
much for himself as for our instruction, to the end we should know how we
ought to rule our life: namely that Seven thousand head of small Cattle, five
hundred yoke of Oxen, as many she Asses, and as many Camells. Lo here a great
substance for one man. And therefore it is said, He surmounted all them of the
East. But anon we shall see wherefore this is rehearsed unto us. For his
patience yield to any reason, and think all other men too base to be in their
company, in so much that if it were possible for them, they would pluck away
the light of the Sun from the poor, so that finally they bear themselves in
hand, that they deserve of good right to be shoaled out, and to be set aside,
as it were on a row by themselves. We see now the corruptions and other
infinite miseries that riches bring: and yet there is no excuse for the^ that
be rich. Wherefore? For here shall Job be made their judge before god,
forasmuch as he was not corupted nor perverted by That Job had seven sons,
and three daughters, I note how it does us too wit, that God had sent his
blissing upon him, to make him prosper by all means. And (as I have touched
heretofore) we shall herafter better see the cause why all this is expressed, and
the intent of the holy Ghost: that is to wit, that it was an incomparable
virtue in Job, to bear patiently Gods taking away of all the things which he
had put into his hand. And it is very well declared also, how his children
behaved themselves, and how he himself also on his part governed the^ in the
fear of God. And this is done to the end that we should understand, that when
God afflicts us, he shows by effect, that he can dispose of his creatures
at his own pleasure, and that although we be at our wits end, and see not the
reason why God handles men so roughly: yet it becomes us to cast down our
eyes, and to confess that he is rightuous, and to wait his leisure, until he
discover unto us the cause why he disposes things so. But now let us proceed
with that which is That Jobs children feasted one another day by day, every one
in his turn, and that they called their sisters to bear them company. True it
is, that nature may well stir up brethren to love one an other: but yet are
men become so evil, as there be very few that consider what brotherhood
imports. For the proof hereof we shall see many brethren that agree like
cattes and dogs. They be brethren, and yet for all that, they cease not to
spite and malice one another, as if one of them would eat an other. We see
then by such (according And furthermore, when a man is there, what a deal of
vain and fond talk shall he have to hold him withal? Where a man ought to
eat as in the presence of God, and to be merry as it were with the Angels:
there shall be store of vanities, which shall carry men in such wise, as many
of the^ (yea even of the good men themselves) shall think that they make no
good cheer, except they disguise themselves I can not tell how: There are yet
many other evil inco^ueniences, whereby we see that God is offended diverse
ways, according as men find in themselves afterward. It may be that my
children have sinned, and that they have not blissed God. But we will speak
of this whole matter in the end. We see then that Job was none of that
sort, which after they have made nycenesse for a while, do finally conclude
to set all at randon. But he goes to the remedy: that is to say, that God
will bear with us in our infirmities. Albeit (says he) that my children have
not done their duty in all points: yet am I sure that God will have pity
both upon them and upon me. And therefore let us ask him forgiveness. But
yet for all this, Job forbade not his children to use their accustomed
feasting: And wherefore? for the thing of it self was good, as I have said
before. If Job had said, I see here a leawd matter: truly he had not made
sacrifize: for that had been to abuse Gods name, and to make it a cloak of
evil. Sacrifizes were not ordained to mainteyne us in evil, nor that any man
should fode and flatter himself in his sins, so as he should say, I may do
sacrifize and then God will be contented. Job therefore sacrifized not to have
it said that he mayneteyned an evil thing: but he knew that his children
did well in gyuing such interteynement one to another, and that it was a
commendable thing so to do. Forasmuch as he knew that, he meant not to find
fault with the thing that was good, but sought for the remedy, that if any
fault lay hid under it, it might please God to amend it: as if he should
say, Of good reason ought we to crave pardon at Gods hand, to the end he may
supply our infirmity. We see then after what manner Job proceeds here, and
also after what manner we must proceed. And furthermore let us mark, that
Job in commanding his children to sanctify themselves, has showed the manner
of the bringing up which he gave them in their childehood, that is to wit,
Sacrifize, it is meant according to the ordinary custom of the law, whereby
(to the intent a man might be partetaker of the sacrifizes) it behooved him to
be purisyed, that he might be dewly disposed thereunto. And albeit that Job was
not of the country where the law of Moses was written, but rather (by all
likelihood) was before Moses was borne: yet notwithstanding it has always
been a custom among the faithful, that when they should sacrifize unto God,
they had some sign of clenzing, that is to wit, of purging themselves from
the filthiness where with they had been imbrewed and defiled. And this was not
invented by man: we must not think all this to have been devised as a tryfling
toy by men: but it was Gods will it should be so. And wherefore? for his
meaning was to put men in remembrance, that they are not worthy to approach
unto him. When we come unto God, it behooves us to acknowledge our own
poorness, and to be ashamed of it, and to say: How dare I preace before the
majesty of my God? what favor shall I find there? Gods will is to have this
known in all ages: and now although we have not the said Ceremonic of
clenzing our selves: yet it behooves us to have the meaning of it in us: that
is to wit, that at all times, and as often as we come unto God to make our
prayers and petitions unto him, we must acknowledge that we be unworthy,
saving that we know the mean

Therefore let us cast our selves flat before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgme^t of our offenses, beseeching him to make us know better what we
have left undone: and that as long as we live in this corruptible world, we
acknowledging our selves to be wrapped in many sins, may resist the
temptations of our flesh, and buckie our selves to battle against all things
that may turn us aside from the obeying of our God. And although we fail in
diverse sorts, yet nevertheless let us pray that we may walk in such
soundness before him, as we may desire nothing but to dedicate our selves wholly
unto him and that it may please him to accept the service that we offer unto
him in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, notwithstanding that it be imperfect,
until such time as his glory shall shine fully in us. That it may please him
to bestow this benefit and grace, not only upon us, but also upon all people
and Nations of the Earth: etc.

The third Sermon upon the first Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the text of the fifth verse, which is set down
in the last Sermon before, according also as it bath partly been showed
already.

I Began to tell you yesterdaye, what is meant by this saying, that Job
sanctified his children, or commanded them that every of them should
sanctify himself. For under the Law and before Job offered sacrifyzes
according to the number of his children. We have already briefly showed, that
although Job feared least his children had offended God: yet notwithstanding
he forbade them not to keep company still together: because their so doing
was a good thing: but sought the remedy of the infirmities whereunto men are
inclined and subject. Moreover it may be demanded, how it came to pass that
Job durst offer sacrifize, seeing he was not instructed in the law, specially
for as much as it is very likely, that he lived before Moses was borne. For the
Sacrifyzes that me^ offer unto God without faith, deserve to be mislyked. How
then could Job offer sacrifyze, having not any assurance of Gods will? We
must call again to mind that which has been touched in the first Lecture:
that is to wit, that it was Gods will, to have always some seed and remna^t
of people in the world, that should call upon him with a pure heart, until such
time as his Church were settled among the Jews* and his law published in
writing. True it is that by and by after the flud, Noes children were
corrupted: I mean those that were descended of his race, who having yet the
fresh remembrance of Gods horrible vengeance, ceased not to invent as it will
befall us if he hold us not back. And herewithall we be also warned, that the
serving of God in outward show, and the setting of a fair face upon it, is not
all that is to be done: but that the chiefest point, is to serve him in deed,
by knowing what a one he is, and what his will is, to the end to hold our
selves thereunto. For there has been great pomp in the sacrifices of the
Paynims, yea and even of the^ that have served God aright: and yet
notwithstanding the one sort have been rejected, and God has abhorred them,
and the other sort have been acceptable care of himself. Thus ye see how we
ought to consider what our ability and measure is. And afterward when it
comes to the offering of our selves unto God: it behooves us to have an eye
to that which he has indewed us withal, for according as every of us has
received, so shall he be the more blameworthy if he glorify not God. So then,
whenever God gives more abundance of his spirit unto us, than to other men:
we must look well to it, that we make our neighbors part takers with us:
that such as have wisdom, give counsel unto others: and that It may be
that my Children have sinned: and that they have blissed God: for so it is
word for word. But the word Bliss is sometimes taken to Curse: as when it
is said, that Naboth had Blissed God and the King, that is to say, had Cursed
them. And we shall see such examples again hereafter, and the^ will I declare
more at large, after what manner this word is put in two contrary
significations. But before we come to that, let us mark how it is reported
here in the text, that Job said: It may be that my children have sinned. Here
we see that Job waited not that God should send him some message to threaten
him for the sins of his children: but prevented the matter and was careful of
it without any man's warning, saying: It may be that my children have done
amiss. And this is a point which we ought to mark well. For now adays there
are very few that can abide to be admonished and to be told of their faults,
although their faults be notorious in all respects: yet (if it be possible) they
will find some shift or other to excuse and hide themselves, in so much that
if a man will rebuke them that do amiss, he must prepare himself to sustain
mortal war at their hand, so as he shall be as a deadly foe to them It is
possible that my children have sinned. And so the holy Ghost has showed us
what our duty is: that is to wit, that when we perceive our selves faulty
and worthy to be condemned, every of us must prick and spur up himself
to make his own accusation for that most happy day wherein he shall gather
us up wholly to himself, when we have lived in such wise in this world, as
we have not sought to be governed otherwise than by him, submitting our
selves unto him in all respects and all caces.

But let us cast down our selves before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our sins: praying him of his goodness to make us feel
better what we have done, specially in such sort, as we may com to present our
selves unto him, without desire of any thing, save only to find him merciful
for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake. And for as much as we know we be beset with so
great infirmities as we find in our selves, and that he is the only Physician
that can heal us: let us pray him to purge us more and more, until he have
brought us to the perfection for the which we long continually. And so set us
all say, Almighty God our heavenly father we acknowledge in ourselves and we
confess as truth is: etc.

The fourth Sermon upon the first Chapter.
6. It came to pass one day, that the sons of God came to appear before the
Lord, and Satan also came amongst them.

7. And the Lord said to Satan: whence come thou? Satan answering, said
unto the Lord, from vvalking about, and from hunting upon the earth.

8. And the Lord said unto Satan: have thou taken heed of my servant Job,
who has not his match upon earth, a sound and upright man, and fearing God
and vvithdravving himself from evil?


WE have seen by the premises, what the life and conversation of Job was
among men: and now is showed in what wise God disposed of him, to the end we
might know, that while we live here below, we be not governed by fortune,
but God has an eye upon us, and full authority over us, as good reason is he
should that they appeared, it is not meant, that when God sends them forth they
be separated from his Majesty and deprived of the heavenly life during the
time that they are in their voyage: but for as much as we be rude and gross,
the Scripture meant to like^ God to earthly Princes, to the end that by a more
homely and familiar manner, we might know how the Angels do not any thing of
their own proper moving, but that it is God which commands them, who has
all dominion over the^, and they come to yield him account, and nothing is hid
from him, in so much as the Angels have not any proper or peculiar authority
in themselves: and that although they be called Powers, Principalities, and
Virtues, it is not for that God has resigned his own office unto them, it is
not for that he has despoyled himself of his own power, it is not for that he
himself abides idle in heaven: but it is for that the Angels are instruments
of his power, to the end it should be spread out ouerall. We see then what we
have to gather of this text: that is to wit, that God works in such wise by
mean of his Angels in the governing of worldly matters, that all of the^ come
to account before him, in such sort as nothing can escape him. And furthermore
whereas it is said, That Satan also came among the Angels: it is not for that
he wound himself in thither, as some have understood it that he crowded
himself into the company to make himself a good page: But contrariwise, the
holy Ghostment to do us to understand, that not only the Angels of Heaven which
obey God willingly, and are wholly inclyned, and given that way, do yield
account unto him, but also the Devils of hell which are enemies and rebels to
him to the uttermost of their power, which labor to subvert his Majesty, and
practice to confound all things: so as they be forced (spite of their teeth) to
be subject unto God and to yield him account of all their doings, and can not
do any thing without his permission and leave. Thus ye see in what wise Satan
appeared among the Angels. But yet by the way, the manner of their dealing is
diverse. For when the Angels guide us, and do the thing that God has
commanded: they have the nature to apply themselves unto him, and have none
other inclination but to obey him, and he on the otherside dwells and
reigns in them by his holy spirit. Lo here the cause why we say, Thy will be
done on earth as it is in Heaven. Because we see so much counterfayting and
so many horrible rebellions against God here below: we desire him to settle
Adversary, for so does the word Satan signify in Hebrew. True it is that me^
are oftentimes Children of God, because he has printed his image in them,
specially in the faithful, for as much as they be reformed to the likeness of
our Lord Jesus Christ who is the lively image of God his father, and also for
that they have received the spirit of adoption, which is a warrant unto the^
that God bears a fatherly love toward them. Rightly therefore may we be
called the children of God. So may also Princes and Magistrates. For they have
the same honorable title, which is given unto the^, because God has aduau^ced
them, and set them in that hie estate, to the intent Gods Children may well be
applied to me^. But the Angels are so called in the Scripture, because they
draw unto God, and are as it were bearnes of his brightness. And therefore in
as much as God calls them Principalities, Virtues, and Highnesses, it is good
reason that we also should acknowledge them to be as it were the sons of
God, for as much as we may not separate the virtue that is in the^, from the
virtue of God, because they be as streams that gushe out of that fountain and
spring, and we must always and had leave without limitation, so as God
withhild them not back: alas, full wretched should our state be. For we
should be cast up as a pray without any remedy. And where should our faith
be? what certainty or assurance of defense should we have? for our enemy is
ouermightie. So the^, one of the necessariest articles that we have, is to know
that the Devil is hild short, and that how soever he play the mad feende
against our salvation, yet can he do nothing, further than is permitted him
from above. And also the Scripture tells us rightly both these God demanded
of Satan, from whence he came, and that Satan answered, from going about the
Earth, yea even to bunt. When such rehearsals are made, we know always how
it is for our infirmity: for God needed not to enquire what Satan had done in
the world. But what then? For as much as our rudeness and the small measure of
our understanding comprehend not these things: it behooves us (as I said before)
that there be such a declaration as is agreeable to us. And herein we see the
goodness of God: in that he frames himself unto us: and because we cannot
attain unto him, nor mount so high: he humbles himself to us, and as it were
transformeth himself, to the end that we should know that which is good and
convenient for us: Seeing that God comes so unto us: I pray you, ought not we
to be confounded with shame if we be slow to hear him? And hereby we see what
a villainy it is of the^ that would bereue poor ideotes of all doctrine. For
they say that the holy Scripture is ouerhard for a man to bite upon. True it
is, that in respect that there is nothing else but darkness in us, the
scripture will be very hard for us: but yet there withal, a man must consider
how God has promised to enlighten the little ones and the lowly. And in deed
we see, how he has proceeded. For to what purpose is it set out unto us here
so homely and after the manner of men? God shows us how his meaning is, not
only to instruct the great Clerks, and such as are very subtle and well
exercised in schools: but also to apply him self unto us that are of the
rudest and vnskilfullest sort, that can be. Seeing God proceeds so on his
part: what an unthankfulness is it for men to draw backewarde, and to shroud
themselves under this shadow and color of saying that it is impossible for
them to understand the meaning of the holy Scripture? For we see how God has
applied himself unto us. By the way we have to gather chiefly, how it is the
mind of the holy Ghost, to show what Satan's office is, what his nature is,
and where about he busieth and applies himself altogether: which is (as I
have said) to hunt after his pray without ceassing, like a roaring lion. And S.
Peter uses the said similitude purposely, to waken us, that we might stand
upon our guard night and day, and call upon God to defend us against all the
assaults of our enemy, and against all that he can practice against us. True
it is that we see not Satan, ne perceive not by eyesight what he prepares and
practizeth to our destruction: and therefore have we so much the more cause to
be afraid of his guiles and policies. Lo here the cause why S. Paul says,
that our fighting is not against fleashe and blood. For hereby he means, that
if we had to deal with visible enemies, we might well escape their hands by
some shift or other, and we might find the mean to resist them. But behold
(says he) they be spiritual guiles that fight against us, of whom we have no
sight at all, except God give us the eyes of faith to epsy how Satan is
against us, specially by the temptations that he triumphs in our way, whereby
he eggeth us to evil, and labors to mar us. So then, we mustefully
resolve ourselves of this point: namely that the Devils are always buzy to
procure our destruction: that they go about the earth, that they be never away
from us, that they be ever seeking means to get into us, and that as soon as
they find never Have thou not marked my servant Job, bow he is an upright and
sound man, which fears God and withdraws himself from evil? This is to
do us to understand, that God spyteth Satan in those to whom he has given the
grace to walk according to his will. And herein we see upon what condition God
has set us in this world, namely that we should be here as mirrors of his
virtue. For when he gives us the grace to govern our selves by his holy
Spirit, he sets us as it were upon a scaffolde, to the end that his
gracious goodness and mercy should be known unto us, and thereupon he
himself might be glorified against Satan in our persons. And sure the honor is
inestimable which God does unto us, when he choozeth us, I say when he choozeth
us poor worms of the earth, to be glorified in us against Satan, and to make
his triumphs by us. Let us consider what a thing this is toward men. Alas:
and can God draw any thing out of men that may serve to his glory? It is very
certain that he cannot: for there is nothing in them but evil. But what then?
After that God has chozen us, he sheadeth out his holy spirit upon us, and
gives us of his grace, where through it is his will to be glorified in our
persons, and so makes he his tryumphes against his enemies. And heerby we
be admonished, not to think it a strange matter, if it please God to exercise
us with store of incou^ters and temptations. But rather when we perceive that
God keeps us occupied: the fruit that comes of our incou^ters ought to
content us thoroughly: that is to wit, that God is glorirified, and that his
power is known, in such wise as Satan is confounded in all his assaults.
Seeing then that the issue of our co^flictes is such and so happy: I pray you,
ought we not to bear them patiently? Moreover, like as God spyteth Satan in
the person of Job: so also have we wherewith to spite all our enemies, when
this protection of Gods is well printed in our hearts, so as we know how it
is he that dwells and reygneth in our hearts by his holy spirit, and that it
is he which fenceth us, and which is a bulwark and fortress to us. Mark also
what Saint Paul says in the viij. of the Romans. For after he has showed
that the faithful are invincible when the spirit of God bears the^ record of
their life: he says that although they have not received him fully and
perfectly: yet notwithstanding (yea though they had received but some one small
drop) the same is the seed of life, to assure them that God will accomplish
that which he has begone. Seeing then that the faithful have such an
assurance, that God has given them of his holy spirit, to show unto them that
he will be their father to the end: thereupon they may lift up their voices
and minds, and vaunt themselves against Satan, against death, and against all
things. And wherefore? Because nothing is able to put them from the said love
which God bears the^, and which he has once showed to them in our Lord Jesus
Christ. Thus we see how we must do, and what we have to hold us to, as shall be
laid forth more at large hereafter, specially when we come to declare what the
mischiefs were that Satan wrought against Job, and how we ought to take
the^. But at this present I do but only touch that which is necessary for
this present purpose. Let us come to that which is in the text, where mention
is made of Jobs uprightness. True it is that I have already declared all that
matter, so as it were but superfluous to make a new discourse of the things
that have been touched hertofore. It shall suffize for us to make a short
rehearsal of them, to the intent to bring that thing to our remembrance which
is greatly for our profit to know. Mark then wherefore the holy Ghost has
declared the life of Job new again: It is to the end it should be as a
pattern for us to shape our selves like unto it. Is it our desire to frame our
lives to Godward, and to his service? Then must we first of all have this
said soundness of heart, that we be not double, and that we serve not God in
outward appearance only, with our feet, hands, and eyes: but that our heart
march That Job served him not for naught, for so much as he had blissed him in
such wise even to that day, that he prospered in all his affairs, So then
(says Satan) Job may be an hypocrite for ought that is known: but if thou
touch him with thine hand, thou shall see what will come of it. We see here
how the Devil labors on all sides to ouerwhelme us, and when he sees that
he gets nothing by one point, he deuiseth and practices some other new
trick. For the wyles are infinite which he forgeth in his shop: and therefore
it behooves us the more to stand upon our guard. It is certain (as I have
said already) that prosperity corrupts men more than all the afflictions of
the world do. For riches are willingly accompanied with pride, pomp,
contempt of God, cruelty, craftiness, and all other such like things: and
they bring with them all delights and pleasures, in such sort, as a man
becomes altogether beastely. But Satan came so far short of winning any
thing at Jobs hand by this means: that he turned himself to the other side,
and made sure that he might be tried by affliction. And by the way we must
consider that God knows right well what is requisite for the trial, as well
of our faith as of our obedience, and that he needs not to be counseled by
the Devil. But this is said expressly unto us, to do us to wit, that if God
send poverty upon us, or afflict us, he does it partly to the end we
should bethink our selves, and not be puffed up any more for prosperity
tha^ for adversity: and partly to teach us to pray unto him according to the
necessities that oppress us. Herewithall we must also mark, that the Devil
is always at our elbow to overthrow us if he can: so as if we escape from him
on the one side, he stirs up a new temptation again on the other side. To be
short, that which is said in one word in Zachary, is declared to us here at
large: that is to wit, that Satan is the accuser and the adversary of all the
children of God, according also as in the Apocalips it is said, that he is the
accuser of our brethren. And it is expressly

Therefore let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our sins: beseeching him to make us feel them better, so
as we may be displeased with our selves for them, and mourn before his
Majesty: and that in desiring pardon according to the measure of our offenses,
we may request him also, that he will not suffer us to be turned any more from
his obedience, but rather that we may continue in it to the end: and that he
will so print in our hearts the said soundness which he has enjoined us,
as we may not in any respect covet any thing save only to yield to him that
which is his dew, that is to wit, that he may be knowledged to be the
author of all goodness and welfare, and that we may do him service, living in
true brotherlynesse with our neighbors, withholding us from all wrong doing,
and doing good to all men, to the end to withstand all the troubles and
temptations of this world, until we be come to the kingdom of heaven. That it
may please him to give his grace, not only to us, but also to all people and
nations of the earth, bringing back all poor ignorant souls from the
miserable bondage of error and darkness, to the right way of salvation: For
doing thereof, it may please him to raise up true and faithful Ministers of
his word, that seek not their own profit and vayneglorie, but only the
advancement of his holy name, and the welfare of his flock, etc.

The fifth Sermon upon the first Chapter.
9. Satan said to the Lord: does Job fear the Lord for nothing?

10. Haste not thou been a bulwark to him on all sides? Haste not thou fenced
his house and all that he has? Do not thou prosper him in all his
affairs? Is not his possession far enlarged?

11. But lay thy hand upon him, and touch that which he has, and see if he
will not curse thee to thy face.

12. The Lord said unto Satan: I give thee power over all that he possesses:
but touch not his person. And Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.


ALbeit that the Devil do but his office a mirror wherein to behold
themselves: it is much more likely that they will show what is in other men,
whither they have faith and obedientnesse in their hearts or no, and whither
they be hypocrites, or whither they serve him in truth. Here ye see what we
have to mark in this streyne, and experience shows us, that it is so. For
we see a great number, who when God sends them all things at their
pleasure, do speak as sweet as sugre, as they say: and ye would marvel to
hear how that good God shall be praised: specially that God bad been as a
^ulwa^ke to Job, and had fenced his bouse on all sides, and that he had made
^im to prosper. Behold how he turns himself into an Angel of light. For
as much as he was before God, it stood him in hand to set a fair color on
his matters, for there was no place for him to use such trumperie as he uses
toward men to deceive them. Thus Satan groundeth himself vpen true
principles: but that was to apply them unto evil: for his desire was nothing
else but to destroy Job. And he says, that God had been a bulwark to him.
Then let us understand, that if we will be maynteyned in this world, God
must needs put to his hand. For what is our life? And to how many necessities
is it subject? Therefore we could not stand one minute of an hour, if we were
not preserved by the grace of God. ^^ like wise is it with all things that we
possess. God must be feign to fence us. And who I pray you is he that
speaks here? It is even Satan, whose coming is of purpose to ouerwhelme us,
both in our goods and in our persons, if we be not (as you would say) well
walled, so as God serve us for a bulwark, according also as we shall see him
to be in the process of the text. For as soon as Satan has his leave, we
see how he takes away all Jobs goods from him, and with what violence he
goes about it. Therefore it was requisite that Job should be fenced all the
while aforehand by the grace of God, and that it should serve to ra^pire him
round about. And this lesson is greatly for our profit. For hereby we be
warned to pray unto God, that it may please him to defend us, for as much as
while we be in this world, we are as it were in a wild wood full of
robbers. And here we see also why the Scriptures attribute these titles unto
him: namely that he is our buckler and shield, our wall and trenche, our
rampyre and bulwark, our tower and fortress. Wherefore does the Scripture
use so many words to betoken that Gods protection is of force? It is to
teach us, that without him we should perish a hundred thousand times a day,
and therefore that he must be feign to watch continually for our safety. We
see then (as I have said) how it is requisite that men should acknowledge
their life to be nothing, considering how it is so frail as nothing can be
more, and how it is subject to an infinite number of deaths, in so much that
they be thereby stirred up to pray God to take them into his tuicion: and when
they shall have lived one day, they must acknowledge that they were mainteyned
by God, and unto him must they yield the praise of all. Lo what we have to
mark in this streyne. For if Satan who is the enemy of all truth, do
confess how it is God that is man's defense, and is compelled to say so, as if
he were upon a rack: seeing God has made us to taste of his woorking, and
made us to feel it: what an unthankfulness shall it be if we confess less
than Satan has done, who desires nothing else but to deface or rather utterly
to abolishe Gods gracious goodness, by his lying, so as it might not be
known at all? So then we see that such as think not of this protection of
God, are worse than the Devil, and needs must it be that they are turned
into brute beasts, or rather altogether bewitched. That God gave Satan leave
to do what he listed with all Jobs goods, condicionally that be touched not
his person. Here at the first blushe a man might marvel, why God did so
give over his servant Job to Satan's pleasure: is it meet that the Devil
should have such credit with God, that when he craves leave to work us
mischief, God should grant it him? It seems that God favors him, and
that he makes sport with us in the mean while as with a tennis ball. But let
us mark, then he hild his assyses, and demanded who was he that would
deceive Achab? for it was Gods will to execute the office of a judge. We see
then, that when God means to punish wicked folk, and to execute his wrath
upon the^ according to their deserts: he tarieth not till he be moved to it by
Satan, but preue^teth him. In this present text when question is had of
punishing Job, that is to say, that God deals roughly with one of his own
children, needs must the same come to pass by the pursuit of the enemy. Lo
here the diversity which shows us the reason being one of Gods children,
was notwithstanding sometimes delivered into the power of Satan, to be
beguiled by him. Now when we see this, we have good cause too pray unto God,
and to come shroud our selves under the shadow of his wings, and there to hide
us. For if such things befell unto David, what shall become of us? Herewithall
let us also mark, that when God gives Satan such sway over the faithful: it
is but for a little while. And here ye may see why it is said, that Satan's
dominion is over the unbelievers and upon all the stubborneharted. It is That
Satan went out from the presence of the Lord. Not that Satan did what he list
as if God saw him not any more: but to signify unto us what the fury of
Satan is, and what is his accustomed manner of dealing: that is to wit, that
he did the worst he could, without regarding that he is subject to God, and
that he used his own rebelliousnesse, in making hauock of Jobs goods: howbeit
that there is yet one thing more meant by that saying: that is to wit, that
Satan did in effectual deed show the leave that he had gotten. For I have
told you already, that this streyt determination of God, which was unknown to
men, is now declared too us here. For whereas the Scripture tells us the
things which are apparent unto us, as how Job was by and by spoiled of all his
goods, how his children were slain, and how he himself was sore plagued in
his own person: these things were commonly known to all men. But all men
knew not that which was rehearsed before: that is to wit, that God hild his
assyses, and that all was disposed by his ordinance, and nothing happened
without his providence. They that have the eyes of faith too comprehend this,
have the understanding of it. The residue, perceive but only the things that
were done outwardly. And here we see wherefore it is said, that Satan went out
from the presence of the Lord. For the holy Scripture puts a difference
between the outward things that are done, and the purpose of God which is
not known but to the faithful, which lift up themselves above their own
reason and above all their natural wits. For we shall never attain too the
knowledge of Gods Majesty, except we be carried up above all our own
ability. And now the Scripture returns to the Story, when it says that
Satan is departed from the presence of the Lord: that is to say, it was visibly
perceived and after an apparent manner how he punished Job. Thus we see what is
meant thereby. The residue is always to express the nature of Satan: which
is, that he with an inordinate rage casts out fire and flame as though he
would make a clean dispatch of all together: and too be short, how it is his
office too tempte men, as it appears in the place where Jesus Christ was
tempted, where it is said, Behold he that tempts. This term and title of
Tempter is attributed peculiarly unto Satan. And why so? To the end we should
know, that he seeks nothing but to destroy all, and to put mankind too
confusion. Thus we see that al his diligence, al his going about and all his
trotting up and down, is to lead us with him to destruction: and for that
purpose desires he to be exempted from obedience unto God, that he might
turn all vpside down. Seeing we know this, we ought too be so much the more
provoked to pray unto God,

Now let us fall down before the majesty of our God, praying him too make us
perceive the euilles that are in us, and that upon the knowing of them, every
one of us may feel himself full of infirmities, yea even of the outrageous
vices for the which we well deserve too be thrust out of his presence. And
herewithall let us pray, him to strengthen us in such wise by his holy spirit,
as we may bliss him continually both in prosperity and adversity: and that
we may not desire any other thing than to please him in all points, and to
yield ourselves wholly unto him. And that although we have to do with an
enemy that is ouerstrong and over boystous, whom we be not able to resist and
to bear back his blows: yet notwithstanding, through the maintenance and
power of our good God, we may continue in his obeisance unto the end: that is
to say, even until he have gathered us home to himself, to make us partakers
of that most happy triumph, which he has prepared for us in his heavenly
glory. That he will grant this benefit and grace, not only unto us, but also.
etc.

The sixth Sermon upon the first Chapter.
13. One day as his Sons and Daughters were eating and drinking of wine in
their elder brothers house,

14. A messenger came unto Job and said: The Oxen were laboring, and the she
asses were feeding by,

15. And behold the Sabeans brake in upon them and took them, and have slain
thy servants with the edge of the svvord, And I am escaped alone to bring
thee word of it.

16. And as he was yet speaking, Behold there was another which said, The
fire of God is fallen from Heaven, and has burned vpthy Sheep and thy
servants, And I only am escaped to bring thee word of it.

17. And as he was yet speaking, behold another which said, The Chaldees have
made three bands and brake in upon thy Camels, and have taken them away, and
have also smitten thy servants with the edge of the svvord, And I only am
escaped to come and tell thee.

18. As he was speaking, behold another, saying: Thy Sons and thy Daughters
were eating and drinking of wine in their elder brothers house,

19. Behold an hideous vvinde from the wilderness rushed against the house,
and crushed the four Corners of it together, and it is fallen upon the young
folk, and they be dead, And I am escaped alone to tell thee of it.


IT is said that Gods Angels incampe themselves round about the faithful:
and this present story shows us, how greatly it is for our behoof to be so
guarded and fenced round about. For we see what the rage of Satan is against al
those his grief and trouble him yet more, too think thus with himself. How
now? Not only men are contrary to me, but also God himself fights against
me. Behold here the crastynesse of Satan. True it is that this will seem
strange to us at the first push: and here we may see what has moved some men
too be of opinion, that God has set us down here a certain potrayture of
patience, and not aplayne story or deed done. But such men understand not
how God deals with his servants according too the measure of says which he
has distrybuted unto against us we must be feign to feel other manner of
strypes at his hand than we have done yet. If we mind such things, it is
certain that in the midst of the greatest miseries and troubles that we can
have in this world, we shall be comforted, and feel some assuagement of our
greefes. But we do nothing at all in that behalf, insomuch that this lesson is
written in vain. So then, let us bear in mind, that in the person of Job, it
is Gods will to give us a looking glass, wherein to behold that if we be
scourged we must not take our adversities so sore to heart, nor be so our selves
that he seeks nothing but to undo us, and to destroy us? So then it is very
necessary for us to be fully resolved, that when God punishes us, it is not a
toke^ that he hates us, nor that he holds us for his enemies: but rather
that he by that mean procures our salvation. And here we see how that (as
Saint Paul says) our victory consists in taking hold of this love of God
in Jesus Christ, so as we be thoroughly persuaded, that God has adopted us to
be his children: for if we have that principle, we shall not be dismayed with
any affliction. Why so? for

And here we see also why our Lord exercises us in diverse manners: which is a
thing to be marked advisedly. For after that God has sent us some adversity,
and we suppose our selves to be escaped from it: we think it strange to
see an other mischief come back again in the neck of it. This I say is
very hard too our imagination. But God has good reason too quicken us up so
by diverse temptations, too the end our patience may show it self as I have
said heretofore. Now if a man's When men trouble us or do us any harm: it
seems to us that God does us wrong, if he avenge us not incontinently, so as
we would have even heaven to bend it self against our enemies to revenge the
injury that they have done us: and we consider not a whit how it is God that
tries us in that wise, and that he knows what is profitable and expedient
for us better than we our selves. By the way, a man might demand here,
how it happened that fire came down from heaven too burn up Jobs cattle.
For the devil has not the lightning and Thou shall not touch the person of
Job, and herewithall we see with what furiousness he has proceeded. Let us
now consider the means which he has to torment us. For look how many
infirmities we have, look how many kinds of aduersityes there are in the
world, look how many overthwart things there be against us: so many are the
sharp darts that Satan has ever in a readiness against us, and so many
wounds and deadly strypes is he able to give us, if God provide not otherwise
for it: seeing that the devil has continually such weapons, and that we on
our side are altogether naked. I pray you what should become of us if God did
not remedy it? So much the more therefore have we cause to render thanks to our
god, seeing we perceive that Satan can do no more than he gives him leave
to do, and therewithal we have need also too call upon God continually, and
to say, Alas Lord, if we be not under thy protection, what shall become of us?
We be sure that thou chastizest us for a time: but therwithall thou show
us thy fatherly goodness, in that thou suffer us not to be utterly rooted
out, considering the outrageousnesse of the enemy with whom we have to do.
For should thou give him the bridle against us, we must needs be devoured
suddenly, even as one poor silly sheep, among an hundred thousand woolues.
We see then how

But let us fall down before the face of our God, with acknowledgement of our
offenses, praying him to make us understand the^ better, yea eue^ in such wise,
as when he afflicts us, we may assure our selves it is for our sins and
offenses, and therewithal know that it is his will to mortify us to the
worldward, and to draw us continually to himself, by making us too pass
through afflictions, which must be so much the more sweet and amiable unto us,
when we see how they te^d to our welfare. And furthermore that he will give us
the grace to be so mortified, as we may desire nothing but to be subject in
such wise to his obeysaunce, as we may never swerve from it, but persevere in
it more and more, eue^ until he have drawn us into eternal rest. That it may
please him too give this grace not only unto us, but also to all people and
nations. etc.

The seventh Sermon upon the first Chapter.
20 Then Job rose up, and rent his clothes, and shore his head, and cast
himself to the ground, and worshipped.

21 And said, Naked I came out of my mothers womb, and naked I shall return
again: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away: Blissed be the name
of the Lord.

22 In all this Job sinned not, ne charged God with any unreasonableness.


We can well say that Patience is a great virtue, as it is in deed: and yet
there be very few that know what this word Patience means: whereby a man
may judge, that we be not very hasty too be pacient, and to have the
virtue that we esteem so much. But God perceiving such carelessness in me^,
minds to set before our eyes the thing that is so need full for us: for if we
be not pacient, our faith must needs Patience imports. And it behooves us to
be taught it, if we will have God too acknowledge us for paciente in our
afflictions. We commonly say, a man is pacient, although he have no point of
true patience in him. For whosoever suffers adversity, him do men call
pacient. But by the way let us hold this for a rule, that to be pacient, it
behooves us to moderate our sorrow. If there be any adversity it must be
assuaged by considering that God ceasseth not Pacient, or Pacientnesse
betokens not that me^ should become blockishe, so as they should have no
heaviness at all, nor be combered with any grief when they feel adversities:
but the virtue is when they can moderate themselves, and hold such a measure,
as they cease not to glorify God in the midst of all their miseryes: nor be
so ouercombred and swallowed up with sorrow and anguishe, as to quail
altogether: but fight against their own passions, until they may be able
too frame themselves too the good will of God, and too conclude, as Job does
here, and finally to say, that he is righteous in all respects. And now let us
see what we have to mark here, where it is said, that Job rent his garmente,
and shore his head: for such fashions were customable in the East countries,
according as we know that there were mo ceremonies in those countries, than
are in these cold countries where we dwell. For when there happened any thing
that might move men to great trouble: they rent their garments in token of
sorrow. Mark this for a special point. And likewise in that country where
men were That when Job did cast himself unto the earth, he did it to worship
God. For true it is, that the word which is set here, signifies Too
incline or bow down a man's self. But the meaning of it is, that he humble
himself before God to do him reverence. We see many cast themselves to the
ground, who for all that cease not to rage, in such wise, as if it were
possible, they would mount above the clouds to give battle unto God. And we
see some also carried away with rage, because they cannot rushe against God as
they would do. But contrariwise Job did cast himself to the earth, of purpose
too worship God, having a special eye unto him to humble himself before his
high Majesty. For when we feel Gods Naked I came out of my mothers womb, and
naked (says he) I shall return again. Whereas he names his mothers I
should deserve to be spitted in the face. And therefore much more are we
bound to receive Gods benefits with all modesty, assuring our selves that he
owes us not any thing, and that in as much as we be poor, it becomes us
to repair unto him too beg at his endless liberality every day. So then,
when soever we be driven to any necessity, let us have recourse back (as
I have said) and examine, from whence came I* Even out of my mothers womb,
stark naked, and a poor and wretched creature: I was not able too help my
self, nor Naked I came out of my mothers womb, and naked I shall return
again too my that God had given, and God had taken away, and that the name of
the Lord was blissed therefore. When he says, that God had given, he
shows how it is good reason, that God should have the disposing of the
things that he has put intoo our hands, seeing they be his. For when God
sends us riches, Maker imports that he has made all things in such
sort, as it is meet that all power and souerain dominion should remain unto
him self. And albeit that men possess their portion of it, according to the
portion of goods which he has given them in this world, yet it is meet that
he should still continue lord and master. Job therefore knowing this, submitted
himself wholly to Gods good will. And it is the thing that The Lord has
given, and the Lord has taken away: that we may know what manner of
authority the Lord has, to give us the enjoying of his benefits, and also to
take them away from us every minute of an hour at his pleasure. And here we
see why Saint Paul exhorts us that forasmuch as the shape of this world
passes away, and all the things therein do glide and vanishe away: we should
possess as if we possessed not, that is to say, we should not have our mynds
tied to them, as it is said in another place, that we must not settle our
selves upon the uncertainty of riches, but when God shall have bereft us of
all that he gave us, we must be always ready to say with Job: very well, thou
O Lord have used thine own right, thou have given and thou have taken away at
thy pleasure. Thus ye see what is the effect of this streine: namely, that as
often and whenever we think upon the goods of this world, we must
always bear in mind, that we hold them all of God. And upon what condition?
Not in feesimple, so as he should pretend no more title to them, nor be
master of them any more: but upon condition that if it please him to put them
intoo our hands, he may also pluck them from us when he thinks good. Let
us understand then, that we be so much the more bound to him, when he causes
us to enjoy some benefit of his for a day or a month, or for some space of
time, and that we must not think it strange if he bereave us of them
afterward, but have recourse to the said knowledge which I have spoken of,
namely that God does evermore hold such a superiority over us, as he may
dispose of his own as he lysteth himself. If it be lawful for mortal
men too dispose of their goods as they list themselves: ought we not to
grant it much more to the living God? Seeing then that God ought to have this
maistership, not only over the things that we possess, but also over our
own persons and over our children: let us humble our selves before him, to
submit our selves wholly to his holy will without gainsaying. Yea but for all
that, there are very few that yield so much honor unto God. True it is that
all men will easily say how it is God that has given them all that they
possess: but what for that? They chalendge all too them selves and vaunte them
selves as it were in spyte of him. And what is that? I pray you is it any
better than flat mockery? Yea verelye it is too gross an hypocrisy when
after we have protested to hold all things of God, yet notwithstanding we
mean nothing less, than that he should have the disposition of them, or
that he should change any thing, but we would have him let us alone and
set us at free liberty, as if we were separated from him and exempted from his
jurisdiction. This is as much as if a man should say, O, I am well contented
to acknowledge such a one for my prince: I will do mine homage and alegeance
unto him: howbeit so as he enter not into my house, so as he come not too
demand any thing at my hand, so as he trouble me not. The world could
not bear with such a vilanie: and yet nevertheless we see how men dallye
with God. And what is it that we mean by this confession, that we hold all
of him, and in the mean while will not abide that he should touch any thing?
We see then how the world does openly play mockholyday with God: and yet
that it becomes us always to follow that which is showed us here: that is to
wit, that forasmuch as God has given us that which we possess, he may call
it back again and withdraw it from us when he will. But yet that which is
added byandby after (namely that the name of God should be blissed) imports
more. For herein Job submits him self in such wise unto God, that he
confesses him to be good and just, notwithstanding Blissed be the name of
the Lord. For we must not only pick out the words: but also consider of
what mind they proceed, and that they be spoken truly and unfeignedly. For
how is it possible that we should bliss the name of God, if we do not
first acknowledge him to be rightuous? But he that grudgeth against God as
though he were cruel and unkind, cursseth God: because that as much as in him
lies, he lifts himself up against him. He that acknowledges not God to
be his father, and himself to be Gods child, ne yeldeth record to bliss the
Lords name, imports as much, as to persuade our selves that he is just and
rightful of his own nature: and not only that, but also that he is good and
merciful. Lo here how we may bliss Gods name after the example of Job: that
is, by acknowledging his Justice and uprightness, and moreover also his grace
That in all these things Job sinned not, nor charged God with any
unreasonableness. Word for word it is thus: Job did not lay before God or
put upon God any unreasonable thing: and it is a manner of speaking well worthy
to be marked. Whereof comes it that men martyr them selves in such wise
when God sends things clean contrary to their desire: but for that they
know not that God does all by reason, and that he has just cause to do so?
for had we it well printed

Now let us fall down before the presence of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him so to bridle us, as we may not
ouershoote our selves in our vain imaginations, but rather that we knowing
how all our benefit and welfare lies in him, may come to him too seek it,
resting our selves wholly upon his mercy: That when he has once made us to
taste of it, we may be so fully persuaded of his love which he bears us,
that although he cause us to walk in many troubles and adversities in this
world, yet we may never cease too cleave fast too him continually, nor too
walk in fear and obedience unto him, until he have rid us out of this
mortal body, and out of this imprysonment and bondage of sin wherein we
be, too gather us up intoo his heavenly glory, where we shall have no let, but
that we may rejoice in our God as partakers of his glory and of his goods.
That he will grant this grace not only to us but also, etc.

The eight Sermon, which is the first upon the second Chapter.
This Sermon contains the end of the former Chapter, The Lord has given and
the Lord has taken away. etc. and also that which follows in the second
Chapter.

1 IT befell on a day, that the children of God presented themselves before the
Lord* among whom came Satan also to present himself to the Lord.

2 And the Lord said too Satan, from whence come thou? Satan answered
the Lord and said, from going about and from vvalking upon the earth.

3 And the Lord said too Satan, haste thou taken heed of my servant Job,
who has not his match upon earth, a sound and upright man, fearing God and
vvithdravving himself from evil, and which keeps still his soundness?
Have not thou sought me to the end I should have destroyed him without cause?

4 And Satan ansvvered the Lord, A man will give skin for skin, and all that he
has, to save his life.

5 But now lay thy hand upon him, and punish him in his flesh, and thou
shalt see if he will not curse thee to thy face.

6 And the Lord said to Satan: Behold, he is in thy hand: But spare his
soul.


I Have declared heretofore how the Devil being Gods mortal enemy as he
is in deed, is feign for all that, to yield obedience to his maker, to whom
he is of the latter day, at which time we shall know no more by parcelmeale,
nor as it were in dimnesse (as Saint Paul says) but we shall then behold
the things face to face which are showed us now as it were in a glass. Thus
then we see an excellent Text too show us how God guydeth and governs
the whole world by his Providence. But we have further too note, too what
purpose the Holy Ghost tells us, that GOD does all, and that nothing can
come too pass without his consent. It is to the end that we might despise
Satan Lord thou haste permitted but Lord thou haste done: Like as where
David confesses his sins and offenses when God had punished him grievously:
he says, Lord, of whom shall I complain? for I see it is thy hand: and
although that David was persecuted by wicked men: yet he called it the hand of
God. Behold how the Lord himself speaks. Will we be wiser than he?
Shall we make him believe that he had need of our gaye colors, to warrante
him that no man may offer him reproach? For see how he speaks of his own
works. When he minded to punish David for rauishing Bethsabee, he said
unto him, thou have done this thing priuilye, but I will make the Sun too
bear witness of it. How was that? What was it that God would do unto David?
It was that Absalom should ravish his fathers wives, and defile them in the
presence of all the people, in the sight of the Sun. Ye see here an inceste,
which is horrible and against nature, and yet nevertheless God says flatly, I
will do it, for those be his words. We see then how it is not a single leave
or permission* but that God himself works in such wise, as the wicked must
needs be the instruments of his will, as we have said. And I pray you, as
touching the office of a judge, is it no more but to give the hangman leave to
do what he list? When a judge must set upon an offender, and give sentence
according as law and conscience will bear: will he say to the hangma^, I give
thee leave, go do what thou will with this man? No, but contrariwise he
peonounceth the sentence, and afterward according too the same, puts* the
offender intoo the Hangmannes hands too do execution upon him. Behold, God
is the sovereign Judge of the world: and do not we dishonor him, in saying
that he does but give Satan leave to do what he li^teth? is not this as much
as to mock Gods justice and to pervert all order? Yes out of doubt is it. So
then, let us mark, that when the wicked run riot, and seek nothing else but
to put al to confusion: God is nevertheless above them, guyding and governing
things after such a sort, as nothing comes too pass without his
Providence, nor otherwise than he has disposed it. And here we see, why it is
expressly said, that God wageth them which are carried away by their own
ambition or covetousness, too make wars, and too cause all the troubles of
the world: and that he entertayneth them in his service. For he terms them
his servants. My servant Nabuchodonozor (says he.) And what manner a one
was Nabuchodonozor? First and formoste he was an idolater, and secondly a
wicked caytife, that desired nothing but too sheade man's blood, and too
turmoyle the whole world, as much as in him lay. There was neither equity
nor uprightness in him: and yet notwithstanding God avouches him to be his
servant. And in what wise? He must not only permit him or give him leave:
for it were a beastlynesse to talk so, and if Asses could speak, they would
behave themselves more reasonably than those that pretend themselves to be
wise after that sort. Now then we see how God executes his commandments
and ordinances so: Yea, but he erewithall let us bear in mind, that the
evil can not by any means be fathered upon him. Satan must bear the
blame still for his own naughtynesse, and men are reproved and condemned by
their own conscience which shall be their judge, and GOD shall be gloryfyed
in all that he does. And how is that? We know that all things ought too
be esteemed according to the intent and end that men ame at. Let us now
consider after what sort God guydeth on the other. And so it stands us
always on hand too know, that God has just cause to chastize us, and that
if he ouerwhelme us a hundred times a day, we be well worthy of it: and yet
that as I have said already, God has not always a respect unto that, when
he afflicts us: but that now and then it is his will that Satan should
torment us so, to the intent that we might obtain victory against him, and
that our victory should be so much the more honorable, as his assayling of
us has been more terrible. Also his meaning is to exercise us by practice,
Haste thou not taken heed of my servant Job? Herein the Scripture yet again
applies it self to our rawnesse: for God has no need too ask Satan. All
things (as I have said) are present with him: howbeit forasmuch as we
understand not that: it is for our behoof too have some such manner of
speeches as we are better acquaynted with, and that GOD should not show
himself such a one as he is in his purely. And here we see why it is
precisely said, that he withdrewe himself from evil. For all was full of
corruption, and it was nothing else but an ouerflowing of iniquity. If there
had been good store of rightuous men in the world, and that Job had had many
like himself, that had given themselves to serve God as he did: God had not
spoken of that one man alone: but here it is said expressly of Job, He has
not his match or his like. By this then we be warned, not to mar our
selves when we be among wicked persons: and that though we see of
withdrawing our selves from evil. And how shall we withdraw our selves?
First of all let us take heed of our selves, and of our wicked affections,
which serve to turn us aside from God. Then afterward let us beware of leude
persons, who are as it were fyrebrandes to set the mischief more on fire: and
these are mortal plagues. Now then, when we see so much iniquity, so much
looseness, and so much outrage in the world, that vices have their full
scope* what is to be done? Let us withdraw our selves, and let us shun
occasion, according also as Saint Paul alleges the same record, saying:
VVithdrawe your selves, and ^^ee far from Babylon, you that carry the Lords
vessels. Hereby Paul means, that after we be once baptized in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, it behooves us to be holy both in body and mind,
and to be given wholly unto God, and dedicated to his service: which thing
can not be done, but by withdrawing our selves from the defylementes that
may corrupt us. So then let us eschew occasions of evil. And when we see
the Job kept still his soundness. Herein our Lord commends his
constancy, which was not apparent until such time as he had been wounded
to the quick. Job had heretofore been a man that feared God, he had been
sound, he had had the said substancialnesse that I spoke of, and he had had
the foresaid honest and upright dealing in his conversation with

But let us cast our selves down in the presence of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, beseeching him to make us feel them better, to
the intent that in craving pardon at his hand, we may be rightful sorry and
displeased with our selves for them, and that therewithal we may be so
forestrengthened by him, and by his holy spirit, as the devil may not be able
to gain any thing at our hands, but that we may get victory against him,
against the whole world, and against all our fleshly affections. And so let
us all say, Almighty God and our heavenly Father. etc.

The ninth Sermon, which is the second upon the second Chapter.
7 Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with an evil
sore from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

8 Then took he a potsherd to scrape himself and he sat him down in the
duste.

9 And his wife said unto him, do thou yet hold still thy singleness?
Bliss God and die.

10 He ansvvered her, Thou speak like a foolish woman. We have received
good of the Lord, and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job sinned not
with his lips.


WE have to mark here, that when God has withdrawn his hand from us, we
must prepare our selves too suffer much greater miseries than we have
escaped. kind, saving that it was as one whole Leprosy: yea and the holy
scripture shows us, that of necessity the disease must needs have bin
extreme. Lo how he is here, as it were, cast out of men's company: even he who
had heretofore been honored of all men, is here now as a rotten carrion, in so
much as he is like to fall in pieces (as ye would say) in his own stinch,
and to endure the extremest pain in the world: for such sores could not be
without great burning, which tormented him even to the uttermost. Then see we
here, that this later misery was and ease. True it is that we may well desire
God too assist us and to send us what so ever is meet for us. But* yet
therewithal we must hold us at this stay: namely that he may do what he
knows to be good: and that though it be against our appetite, yet he will
grant us grace to frame our selves unto him, and too follow him throughout
whither soever he call us. And that is the thing which we have to practice all
the time of our life. When a trade, occupation or handicraft is hard, we must
have the more time to learn it, and it has the more cunning How now?
(says she) Continuest thou yet still in thy singleness? Bliss God and dye.
The Devil finds means ynow to incomber us, without having any bellows to
quicken up the fire. For we know there is so great sturdinesse in our nature,
as it is pity to see it. In stead of quiet submitting of our selves unto God
and Do thou yet hold still thy singleness? As if she had said, what gaynest
thou by serving God? For thine intent in serving him, has been to be
supported by him, that he should have lyked well of thee, and that he
should have showed by his dooyngs that he is thy father: and thou see how
he is an enemy to thee, and persecuteth thee. So then thy soundness booteth
thee nothing at all. Lo here what her conclusion is: As concerning that which
follows, namely Bliss God and dye: it is expounded in diverse manners. For we
have seen how this word Bliss, is sometimes taken to Curse. And that custom,
(that is to say, that manner of speaking) serves to teach us to detest
blasphemy against God, as a thing that ought not to be named. Then are we
done to understand that to grudge against God, or to spite him, or too cast
forth any words that may sound to his dishonor, is so detestable a thing, as
we must even shudder and quake at it: according as we see that when Saint
Paul speaks against whoredom and other villainous looseness, Bliss the
Lord, that is to say, provoke God to anger, and then thou dyest for it:
revenge thy self on him once ere thou dye: for thou see well enough that he
has deceived thee. And it is not to be douted but this woman here was an
instrument of Satan, and therefore it is not too be marvelled though she be
as a Sheediuell, or as a feend of hell, to set Job in such a rage, as he
should lift up himself against God, and fall to rushing Bliss God and dye:
that is to say, well may thou persist to bliss God as much as thou will: but
when thou have all done, thou shall gain nothing by it, it is but lost labor:
thou must be feign to die, do what thou can: it is fully determined that it
shall be so: for thou see that God has not heard thy prayers, whether thou
glorifye him or not: it is all one: none of this shall come at heaven:
therefore thou have spunne a fair threde in humbling thy self before mind,
that it behooves us to be ready fenced against the greatest friends that we
have. The case is so here, as I may yield another to my wife, nor to my
neighbor simply, no nor even to him whom I trust best. For our linking one
with another must be such as we always have regard of God, and that the bond
of our concord and friendship proceed from him. Also let us remember, that if a
man have a devil in his house too disquiet him, or if he have two or three:
so much the more need has he too stand upon his guard: and it may in no wise
serve to excuse Thou have spoken like a foolish woman: verily we have received
good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not also receive evil? When as
Job answers, that his wife has spoken foolishly: thereby we be admonished,
that we ought to reprove such blasphemies sharply, for as much as they be
spewed out by Satan. For if we see a sword drawn against Seeing we have
received good of the Lord, why should we not also receive evil? he sets
down a natural argument to induce us to bear patiently the evil and
adversities that God sends us. For if we be so much bound to a man, that
when we have received a good turn at his hand, we will have such consideration
of him as to say, he is a man that has done me great good: if herevppon we
endure not any thing at the hands of them to whom we be so much beholden,
will not men say, that there is too villanouse an unthankfulness in us?
According then as we be bound to mortal men, so also will we be pacient when
we shall be feign to suffer any inconvenience for them. If a child be willing
to bear with his

And let us pray to this good God, that it may please him to have always
regard of our infirmities whenever he shall afflict us: and that forasmuch
as it is good reason that we should be inured unto patience so long as we be in
this world: although we be forced too pass through many thorns and diverse
hartgreeues and vexations of mind: yet nevertheless our good God will so arm
us with his strength, as we may not quayle. And that forasmuch as our life is
a corruptible and ruinous caban: he will hold us up in our feebleness, even
unto the end, and until such time as he have rid us quite and clean of
the infirmities of our flesh: and that therewithal we also having our
recourse unto the fatherly goodness which he uses toward us, may be
succored by him in all our necessities, not doubting at all but he will bring
us to the salvation which he has promised us, assuring our selves, that if we
persist in his obeisance, we shall never be disappoynted, and that if we
stick unto his promises, he will never fail to have his hand stretched out
over us to succor us. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only to
us, but also to al people and nations of the earth. etc.

The tenth Sermon, which is the third upon the second Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth the rest of the exposition of the tenth verse before,
and afterward the verses following.

11. And three of Jobs friends having heard of all the adversities that had
happened unto him, that is to vvitte, Eliphas the Themanite, Baldad the Suhite,
and Zophar the Maamathite, came from the place where they dwelled: for they
agreed to come to have compassion of him, and to comfort him.

12. And when they lift up their eyes a far off, they knevv him not, and
then they lifted up their voice and wept and rent their clothes, and cast dust
upon their heads tovvarde heaven.

13. And satedovvneby him upon the ground by the space of seven days and seven
nights, in such vviseas none of them spoke one word, for they savve that
his grief was greatly increased.


YEsterday I declared in effect what Job meant by this sentence, We have
received good at the Lords hand, and why receive we not evil also? It
serves too show how men are toto unthankful, if they acknowledge not
themselves so greatly bound unto God, for the number of benefits which they
have received at his hand, as they ought not to refuse any manner of afflictions
when he lists too exercise them there with But there are that understand it
We receive good at the Lords hand, Job hoped, that yet in time too come,
God would be the same toward him again, that he had felt him to be
heretofore. And so it seems too them, that Job meant to comfort his wife and
himself by saying, This myserie shall not continue for ever: although God
punish us, he means not to continue it too the uttermost: for in the end he
will have pity upon those that are so distressed. But the natural meaning is
that which I have set down already* that is to wit, that Job considering our
great frayltie, and how Satan eggeth us to this or that:) let us assure our
selves that we are already faulty before God, and that we must ask him
forgyuenesse of it, and yet therewithal fight valiantly still, and thrust
those things under foot, and do according to that which was said yesterday.
For Job not only rebuked his wife: but also discovered her folly. Therefore it
becomes us to take good heed, that we enter not into disputation and
pleading against God, but rather that we learn to bridle, yea and to rebuke
our selves Justly. Thus we That three of Jobs friends having heard of all
the myseries that were happened unto him, took aduyce to visit him. And to
what end? To have compassion of him, and to comfort him. It is a good
likelihood at the first blush that God meant to relieve his servant Job, when
he sent men unto him that pretended to have pity upon his miseries, and
were skillful and wise to comfort him, as we well shall see by their
discourses anon after, how be sure then, that unless we have that, we
shall not be able too comfort such as are afflicted. For if Jobs friends
which were so excellent men, did so ouershoote themselves: it is a much more
likelyhoode that we shall miss if God supply not our want and give wherewith
too behave our selves as is meet for us. Thus we see what we have to
remember. Moreover, whereas it is said that they took counsel to have
compassion of him and too comfort him: in these two words it is showed us,
what is the duty of such as see their friends and neighbors endure
adversity. will do with him. Lo here the wisdom that David exhorts us
unto: namely that we should wait too see whether God will deliver those
whom he persecuteth with his own hand, albeit that it be rightfully done.
Also let us learn to be fenced against all stumblingblocks that may come in
our way, that we be not troubled when things exceed our imagination, and
that we be not let by them to do our duty continually, and that our heart
fail us not in the mids of our journey. Truly this lesson is hard too put
in ure: but so much the more pain That they lyfted up their voice and fell a
weeping. These tears here came not of counterfeytnesse, it was a good
affection that they had. Howbeeit forasmuch as they were abashed by reason of
the great miseries that Job endured: we see they be so troubled and dashed
out of countenance, as they rent their clothes, and cast dust upon their
heads, that they cast themselves upon the ground, and were seven days and
seven nights without speaking any word: therein we see the said compassion
whereof we have spoken before: and besides that, we see how their meening was
to humble themselves with but a little further, and would make them to
understand their faults, it would mkae them to say, O, that were totoo much:
and it would seem unto them that God were ouersharpe and rigorous against
them. But in any wise we must not think that God receives us as repentant
persons, except we bring him the sacrifize that is spoken of in the one and
fiftith Psalm. And what manner a Sacrifize is that? That we have our hearts
and minds so distressed as we can no more: and that we be so ashamed of the
committing of the sins where of our conscience has remorse

But let us fall down in the presence of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may always be ready
to endure the chasticementes that he shall send us, and abide them without
being ouertroubled in mind, and therwithall that we may never be ashamed to
condemn our sins and iniquities, and to crave pardon for them: and specially
that in yielding our selves guilty before him as we be in deed, we may not
cease to call upon him, and to assure our selves that his mercy shall never be
denied us, when we come for it with true repentance, desiring nothing but to be
subject to his good will, and to walk in his fear and obedience all the time
of our life. That it may please him too grant this grace, not only unto us,
but also to all, etc.

The eleventh Sermon, which is the first upon the third Chapter.
1 AFter this, Job opened his mouth, and curssed his day.

2 So Job ansvvered, and said:

3 Let the day perish wherein I was borne, and the night wherein word
was brought that a man child was conceived.

4 Let that day be ouercast with darkness, and let not God require it from
above, and let it have no brightness to give it light.

5 Let darkness and thick shadovvs ouervvhelme it, let it be ouercouered
with clovvdes, and let the heat of the day burn it up,

9 Possessed be that night with darkness, let it not be reckened among the
days of the year, nor come in the number of the months.

7 Desolate be that night, and let it have no gladness in it.

8 Let them that are wont to curse days, curse that, and they also that fall
a mourning.

9 Let the Stars be darkened in it, and let it have no hope of light, neither
let the eye liddes of the morning tvvilight see it.

10 Because it did not shette the doors of the womb that bare me, too hyde
these troubles from mine eyes.


We must here consider the intent of the holy Ghost, to the end we may
apply this whole doctrine too our own use. Hitherto we have seen Jobs
patience, and how he submitted himself wholly unto God, yea and that How Job
cursed the day of his birth. Some there have been, that would excuse Job
altogether, as though he had been carried away in his adversity, howbeeit
without blaspheming of God. Other some imagine that he has forgotten the
pacientnesse which he had had heretoofore, and that he is altogether
enraged, so as he has no more mind too glorify God, but is carried away by
his own passions, and speaks as a man out of his wits. Heretofore he
blamed his wife of folly: and now he shows himself a double fool in
curssing the day wherein he was borne. But it is certain that Job is not come
too such extremity: for it is always his purpose too obey God, as we shall
see. Nevertheless, there is a mixture in him: that is to wit, in his fighting
he fails not to be wounded, he ceasseth not too receive blows, he
staggereth, he steppeth awrie. So then, let us mark this mixture: that is to
wit, that Job has not so sound a perfection as he had before. and yet
notwithstanding, that although his adversity pinched him, so as it was likely
that he should have faynted in the mids of his way: he hilde on his course
still with still purpose too obey God, howbeeit that in the mean while (as
says S. Paul) he accomplished not the good that he desired. Paul in that
place treats of himself, and confesses that although his whole desire was
to give himself unto God: yet notwithstanding it came not so to pass, but he
was hindered by his own nature, which was ouerweake. If S. Paul acknowledged
so much of himself: let us not think it strange that the like should happen
to Job, so as he should be desirous too frame himself to the good will of God,
and yet his affection should not be so perfect in all points, but that he must
be feign to halte and to stoop. And herein we see that which happened too our
father Jacob, at such time as God meant too cause us too understand, that
whenever the faithful encounter against temptations, it shall not be
without carrying away of some curste blows that shall leave their marks
behind them. We see how Jacob wrestled with the Angel of God: and
wherefore? not for that he was Gods enemy: but because the Lord which tries
those that are his, minds also too prove his own children, as we have seen
in the first Chapter. Therefore it is said that the Patriarch Jacob strove and
wrestled with the Angel. Whereby it appears that God meant too exercise him,
and also that Jacob disposed himself too bear out the bruntes that he
should be put unto, insomuch that God inhonored him by giving him the name of
Israel, which is as much to say, as mighty toward God. But in the mean
while, went he away with the victory without touch of breast? No, but he had
his thigh crusshed in such sort, as he halted and was lame of it all his life
after: The upper hand was his, but yet was he feign to be humbled. Behold how
the faithful withstand temptations: namely that in some point they may chance
to stoop, yea even in such wise as God shall humble them all the days of
their life, that they may have occasion to know their own infirmities till they
groan again: but yet for all that, they we have cause too bliss his name
continually: And although this life be so full of miseries, as nothing can
be more: yet the case stands so, as we can not sufficientlye value the
inestimable benefit that God has bestowed upon us, in giving us this present
life, because that by mainteyning us therein, he makes us too feel by
experience, that he has a care of us, and will not by any means forsake us,
howsoever the world go.

Seeing we have this, have we not whereof too

And further, for as much as we be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and that besides our creation, God has also moreover prynted his
mark upon us for an advantage, too the intent we should be as his dear
friends, and be received intoo his Church: therein we have cause too bliss
God double. And so they that curse the day of their birth, by chafing at the
miseryes and afflictions that they endure, show well that they be
unthankful, and that their own afflictions do too much ouermaster them.
Even so stood the case with Job. And therefore we have the more cause too
pray unto God without ceassing, that he will vouchsafe too hold us back:
and that if now and then he suffer us too let slip some wicked words, and
that we be not so steadfast as were requisite: yet notwithstanding that though
we be shaken, we may not fall, but recover our selves again, and learn too
gather our wits better about us, too bridle our selves: and that when we
see there has been any frayltie in us, we may condemn the fault, too the
intent too return by and by again intoo the right way. Thus ye see what we
have too mark here. But when it is said, Cursed be the night wherein word
was brought, behold a manchilde is conceived: it should seem that Job meant
too spyte God in so doing. For though we have cause (as I have erst said)
too bliss God for creating us after his own Image and likeness: yet is our
case such, as the men are preferred before the women in mankind, we know
that God has ordained man as the head, and given him the dignity and
pre-eminence over the woman.

And here we see also why Saint Paul says, that the man must go with
the head bare, because he is the glory of God: and the woman the glory of
the man. True it is that the Image of GOD is printed alyke in them both: but
yet is the woman inferior too the man, and we must go by those degrees
which God has set in the order of nature. So then, it is reason that God
should be gloryfied both in males and females: howebeeit that he must
chiefly be gloryfied at the birth of a manchilde: and yet clean contrariwise
Job says: Curssed be the night wherein it was reported that a manchilde was
borne. And why did he so? For it had not become him too have thought well of
all these things, according as God had disposed the days? Yes: but Job
turns all to the contrary. And here we see that which I have touched:
namely that he so wanzeth away in his own passions, as he forgets Gods
graciousnesse, whereof he had spoken before, For he had said: very well,
seeing we have received benefit at Gods hand, why should we not also
receive evil? For we be bound too be subject unto him. Job should have
borne these things well in mind. Howbeeit for as much as it is an
excellenter matter too have a manchilde borne, than too have a womanchilde: he
says: cursed be the night wherein he was conceived. But (as I have said
before) all this is too teach us too pray God too arm us, and too give us
strength and power too withstand temptations, considering that he which is a
pattern of patience, was so carried away. And therefore if at any time we be
incombred with any excess, so as our flesh provoke us in such wise as we
have not so quiet a mind too obey God as were too be desired: let not that
cause us too be out of heart, sith we see that the same thing has befalne
unto Job. Then behooves it us too humble our selves, acknowledging our own
frayltie, and in the mean while too be of a good courage, until God have
given us the full victory. Furthermore we have too mark also, that such as
have children, ought so too rejoice in the having of menchildren, as they
reject wyshed that the day of his birth were overwhelmed with darkness,
that it were brunt up with the beat of the day, and with storms and
tempectes, that it were stryken out of the course of the year, that it might
have no stars, and that it might not come intoo the Calendar, too be under
the government of the Moon. It seems here, that he would pervert the whole
order of nature. But hereby we see how our passions boil within us. True it
is, that if men could mourn without excess in their afflictions, it were not
too be condemned. Why so? For our Lord Jesus Christ was not affectionlesse:
yea, we see that when he endured any grief, he felt it, he sighed at it,
and he was sad for it: and yet for all that he was the unspotted Lamb of
God, insomuche that there was nothing in him that could be blamed. How is it
then that he had heaviness in him? Save only that (as I have said already)
his sorrowing was moderated as was convenient, and was not wicked nor sinful
of it self. But all our passions are wicked, because they be wrapped in some
sturdinesse against God, or in some dystrust, or in some other outrage of the
flesh. If God send us any good, it is not evil don of us to be glad of it: and
specially we cannot yield him thanks, but we must have our hearts at liberty,
too feel the good luck that he has sent us. But what? Men are always
so full of vanity, as they can never make themselves merry without offending
of God. As for example, if God send them riches, there goes I wot not what a
vaynglorye, meddled with them I cannot tell how. Or at leastwyse they call not
upon God with such feruentnesse as they were wont to do, but become very
lazy, and give them selves over too that which they have in hand. Too be
short, as fast as men purpose too make themselves merry or too be sad, there
will evermore be some excess: and hardlye can they hold themselves from
offending God, because they have not such stay of themselves as were
requisite, but let themselves run at randon. And specially, if the adversity
be great, men shall very hardly escape too forgette themselves, and too be
carried away according as it befalls here unto Job, when he says he
would feign, that his byrthdaye were quite wyped out of the year. But did he
himself dispose the days of the year, that he should desire too change
Gods ordinance? when our Lord shows us the modesty which we ought too
keep in making of oaths, he says: ye are not able too make one of the hears
of your head white when it is black; or black when it is white: and how
swear you then by your head? But here Job passes somewhat further. For he
would pluck the stars out of the sky, he would set the whole world on
Let them that are wont too curse days, curse the day of my birth: and let
them that raise up weeping and lamentation, ban the night wherein I was
conceived. Seeing that Job speaks so, we see yet better, that men have
neither measure nor stay of themselves when their affections begin too boil
up. For like as in a pot, when the first seething is ouerpast, and it has
cast his first skumme, other walloppes come after, so as a man cannot stop
them: even so fare our affections, which are so outrageous as a man cannot
weeld them at the first brunt. But contrariwise we see what is taught us in
the holy Scripture: namely that when David meant too praise God as became him,
he was not contented to apply all his wits and all his indeuer to the doing
of it: nor to call men to bear him company: but he says also, Ye Heavens,
thou Earth, ye Trees, ye Hills, thou Hayle, thou Snow, thou Rain, and all ye
senseless creatures, praise ye the Lord. We see what zeal ousnesse there
ought too be in us when we mind too serve God in good earnest: that is too
wit, we must desire not only that men and women, but also that the
senseless creatures should with one common consent apply themselves too
praise God with us, so as there may be nothing in this world neither above
nor beneath, which shall not bend it self wholly to glorify God. And
herewithall also let us pray God to give us the grace to be able to employ our
selves thereaboutes, and to strengthen us against all temptations that may
chance: not only against the assaults that shall be made upon us by our
enemies from without, but also against the affections that are within us.

Now let us fall down before the presence of our good God, with acknowledgment
of our offenses, beseeching

The twelfth Sermon, which is the second upon the third Chapter.
This Sermon contains yet still the exposition of the tenth verse, and of the
verse following.

11. Wherefore died I not in my mothers womb? wherefore did I not yield up
the Ghost as soon as I was come out of her womb?

12. Wherefore did the knees receive me? wherefore have I sucked the teates?

13. For now should I have lain still and taken my rest: I should be in
quiet, and there were rest for me,

14. With the Kings and Counselors of the earth, which build the desert
places,

15. With the Princes that have gold, and which hoorde up Silver in their
house.

16. Or I should be but as an vnty mely birth that is hidden, or as an infant
that has not seen the light.

17. There the wicked rest from their trouble, there they that have traueled
lie at rest.

18. There the prisoners rest together, and no man hears the voice of the
extortioner.

19. There the great and the small are equal, and the servant is free from
his master.


I Have declared heretofore, that when we be heavy and sorrowful, the only
remembrance of Gods benefits must cheer us, or at leastwise assuage our
miseries and griefs: so as if any adversity pinch me, and I bethink me of
the great regarded him still with compassion, considering that he had showed
himself so gracious and pitiful toward him already. Here we see a lesson
common to all men: which is, that when we be distressed with adversity too the
vttermoste, even that it seems a vain thing and but lost labor to call unto
God: yet it behooves us to consider, that he has created us and put us into
this world, imprinting his own image in us, and giving us many tokens to know
that he takes us for his children. This ought to make us lift up our minds
alofte, to yield him his worthy praise: and why was not the door of my
mothers womb shut up? why was I borne into this world? But he adds
further, why did the knees receive me? why did I suck the teate? Herein we
see that Job considers not Gods benefytes to his own profit, albeit that
he have felt that if he were dead, he should have rest. The reason (says
he) is that death ends all things, so as there is no more either rich or
poor, there is no more any Servant or Master: those that have troubled the
world hold themselves in quiet: and they that have been troubled are also at
rest with them. I should lie still and sleep, I should no more have any care
or feeling of misery. It seems at the first blushe, that Job speaks here
like a Heathen man that has no hope of the life to come nor of the
resurrection, howebeit that the same were never clean wyped out of his heart.
But sometimes there are so great and so headdie passions in us, that the seed
of God is as it were choked, and all the light of religiousnesse which we
ought to have, is dimmed, and all the conceytes thereof are cast under foot,
so as they can bear no sway. This is well worth the nothing: but it had need
too be declared more at length, for to be well understood. We see how the
present afflictions blind us. If it be summer, and that we be ouerwhote
(for we must take their familiar examples) it seems one of the paynefullest
troubles that a man can endure: specially if a man be so ouerloden that he
faint, and be not able to hold out any further, he would have a froste that
should clyue the stones, and he thinks he should be well refreshed, and
that he should be the more at his ease. And if it be winter, we will
think that no heat can be to great for us. Lo how the present passions
carry us away, and this befalls too all men: Yet notwithstanding some are
much more tender and nyce to suffer adversity, than other some be. Therefore
according as each man's nature and complexion is, thereafter had asked him by
and by, what say thou? is there no difference between good men and badde?
does death make a final end of all things? Thou speak here like an
infidel that never knew of God nor of Gods religion. For God teaches us,
that after death there is a better life than this, and an everlasting heritage,
which he has prepared for those that are his, and for those whom he has
chozen: and as for the reprobates, seeing that they have despyzed him during
their life, they shall know him to be their judge. If Job had been posed it
stands us in hand to be well resolved in the said article: that is to
wit, that in death there is not rest for all men. True it is that all men,
yea even the wicked also (as I have said) shall be discharged of the
necessities of this present life. But in the mean season they fail not to be
tormented, feeling God too be their judge, at whose hand they can look for
no mercy, for they know that this confusion is thoroughly ready for them, and
that they shall be plunged down into hell. Seeing (I say) that they are cast
and repriued to that day: Kings and Princes do build up desert places: he
shows the foolish vaynegloriousnesse that is in worldelings, and in such as
would make themselves renoumed here. When men devise, practyze, and consulte
of buylding houses and palaces: we know that commonly there is excess. When
they proceed according to the order of nature, and say, very vell, it is Gods
will that we should lodge here below, and thereupon do build themselves
houses to dwell in according to their articles: it is a very good That the
servant is set free from his master, and that the poor and the rich are all
one: it is to show us, that men must not glory in their present greatenesse,
according as saint Paul speaks of principalities, wherein he speaks as
David does. For thus he says in the Psalm: I have said, ye are Gods.
Which is as much to say, that Princes, and such as are in authority, are
Gods li^^etenants, and have pre-eminence above the rest of the world, as
though God had privileged them. But what for that? yet are ye mortal men,
and shall dye as men, and so assure your selves. Thus we see that they which
are advanced to high estate, ought not to dazzle men's eyes, but rather
acknowledge their own frail state, and that for as much as the world and the
shape thereof passes away: their riches, their credit, and their honor shall
come to naught. Therefore let them not besot them selves. But let them
continually think upon death, and let those that have servants and subjects
under them, think thus with themselves: we must come to account, we have one
in heaven who is master of us all, as saint Paul says: there will be no
accepting of persons, there shall be no more bondage or mastershippe for men
too allege before God. True it is that the earthly policy, and also the state
of Magistrates is ordained of God. But all this concerns the world and
worldely things, which shall take an end. And therefore must these things
be transitory also. Then let us all take heed that we hold our selves in
lowlynesse and modesty, and that we attempt not any thing which God has not
given us liberty to do. But now let us return to the matter that we
began withal: that is too wit, that Jobs talk ceased not too be
outrageous and excessive, and without any measure: and that if he had
consented unto it, it had been horrible blasphemy. But the case so stands,
that forasmuch as he had not such a strength in him self as to be able too
master himself: he was attaynted with many evil faults, as men must needs
feel in the encountering, that they have always infirmities in their flesh.
And furthermore we see here how Job speaks of little babes. For whereas
he says: As an untimely birth: it is as much as if he meant too tell us,
that when God puts an humane creature into the mothers womb, it has no
soul. But contrarily we know that when the creature is conceived in the
mothers womb, God breaths a soul into it, and it is certain that it has
in it the seed of life. And so Job shows himself not too be well enough
settled in his wits, to consider of Gods works, and too judge rightly of
them, too discern between black and white, but is altogyther straight. And
whereof comes that? Even of the hardiness of his passions, as I have said.
We see here as it were a tempeste or storm that makes Job both deaf and
blind. Sometimes when it thundreth, and the air is so sore troubled that a
man can not hear any thing, all our wits be as it were utterly amazed, and
therewithal we be stricken in fear: and when we see the flashes of lyghtning,
and hear the thundercrackes, and the rattling of some sore and vehement hayle:
we imagine that we should be fordoone, and we shrink our selves inward
in such wise, as we dare not once put out our heads. Even so stood the case
with Job. Wherefore let us consider these things, and there withal let us
also bear in mind the doctrine that I have touched already. True it is that
here we must mark two things: for we have two extremities, whereof it
behooves us to take heed. The one sort think it is no patience, if a man be
not altogether peaceable. The other sort are of opinion, that

Now let us fall down in the presence of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our faults, beseeching him to make us feel better what we have not done, that
we may be sorry for them, and crave pardon of him, and walk in such
aduisednesse, that being shrouded under the shadow of his wings, we may be
fenced with a good and invincible defense against our adversary, and all that
ever he ca^ practyze against us. And for as much as we be environed with so many
wants while we be in this world, let us pray also to be strengthened with power
from above, that we may not faint in the midst of our journey, but hold out our
race, having always our eye upon the glory that is promised us in heaven, and
purchased for us by the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, not
doubting but that we shall fully and perfectly enjoy it, when we shall have
erst taken possession of it here beneath by hope and patience. That it may
please him to grant his grace, not only to us, but also to all people and
nations of the world, etc.

The thirtenth Sermon, which is the third upon the third Chapter*
20 Why gives he light to them that are in misery, and life unto them that
have sorrow* full hearts,

21 Which wait for death, and it comes not to them: [and] which seek for
it more busily than for treasures?

22 They would rejoice and be merye, they would be very glad if they
might find the grave.

23 [VVhy gives he light] to the man whose way is hidden, and which God has
shet up?

24 My sighing comes before I take my repaste, and my roaring is like the
ouerflowing of waters.

25 I have met with the thing that I stood in fear of, and the thing that I
mistrusted is fallen upon me.

26 I have not been in prosperity, I have not been in quiet, I am not in rest,
and yet notwithstanding this trouble is come upon me.


Job complayneth here, as though God did men wrong too put them into the
world, and to exercise them with store of miseries. And so he makes his
reckening, that if God will have us to live, he should maintain us at our own
ease, and with adversity, and to resort unto him, desiring him to receive us
unto mercy. But men can never keep this mean, except God have an eye to it of
himself when he scourges us. Therefore let us mark first, that whenever
God sends us any troubles and sorrows, he ceasseth not to make us taste of
his goodness therewithal, to assuage the anguishe that might hold our
hearts in distress. How is that? We have showed heretofore, that if men had
an eye to Gods former benefits toward the^ (yea though it were but in that
he has sustained them Why do the God give light to such as are of troubled
minds He remembered not that God had just cause to keep men in the mids of
many miseries, and that although their state be wretched here below, yet is
God righteous still: and that albeit he punish us, and keep us occupied many
ways, yet it becomes not us to hold plea with him, under color that he
holds us here against our will, and that we be shut up in prison, while we
be in this life: neither must we conceive any displeasure for all that. Job
did not sufficiently consider this. Now if such a person as Job was,
happened to ouershoote himself, and to kick against God, for want of having
the said regard that I have spoken of: much more must we set our minds
upon the said two points: that is to wit, that we bear in remembrance, that
God never forsakes us, and therefore that we may not be ouersorowfull when
God sends us any adversities, because we be sure that his chastizing of us
is after such a sort, as therewithal he releeueth our grief, at leastwise
if it be not long of our selves, and of our own unthankfulness: And secondly,
that when we be distressed that we can no more: God calls and allureth us
friendly unto him, yea I say, he provoke us to resort unto prayer as often
as we be as it were utterly stripped out of all that we have. Lo here the
true remedy: which is to call upon our good God to have pity upon us, and not
to suffer us to be so dismayde as to say, I wot not what to do, and it is to
no purpose to go unto God. Let us keep our selves from such incombrance, and
persuade our selves that we shall always be sure to fare well, if we call
upon God, who will be always merciful to us, even in the midst of our
afflictions. When we have these two points well settled in our remembrance,
we shall no more say: Wherefore is it that God holds those here which are
in sorrow of mind? For we see wherefore he does it. There is great reason
why God should chastyze men. For how great are our sins? the number of them
is infinite. Again, if we look upon our lusts, there is also a very
bottomless gulf, which has need to be mended. God therefore must
mortify us. Furthermore, if we consider how much we be given too the
world: we shall find that our afflictions had need too be plucked from it
by Gods chastyzementes. Moreover how great is our pride and
presumptuousnesse? And therefore must God needs humble us. Besides all this,
how cold are we to crave his help? and therefore he must be feign too
enforce us too it. Finally ought not our faith to be tried and made known?
Then see we not reasons inowe why God holds us here, and will have us to
be miserable, so as there is nothing but pain, trouble, torment, and anguishe
in all our whole life? Is there not sufficient reason why God should do this?
Mark here a special point. And sith that he continually calls us unto
him, and makes us free passage unto him, and that we have such a remedy in
our miseries: may we not hold our selves well apayed? We see how we
ought too be armed and fenced against the said temptations, which reigned
ouermuche in Job, howebeit that he was not utterly overcome of it. For when
Job speaks here of such as desire the grave, and which willingly dyg for
it as for some hidden treasure, longing to dye and cannot: he puts him
self in the same rank, as we shall see by the sequel: wherein he confirms
his own infirmity and vice. For it is not lawful for the faithful to
mislyke their own life, and to wish so for death. True it is that we may
wish for death in one respect: which is, in consideration that we be hilde
here in such bondage of sin, as we can not serve God so freely as were to
be wished, because see us so blinded with vain and fond joy, and we be so
ouersotted, as we know neither death, nor our own frailty any more, neither
have we any discretion at all. And if God visit us with any afflictions: it
needs not to be asked whether we blaspheme or no, or whether any oaths pass
out of our mouth or no: there will be store of misliking, of murmuring* and of
impaciencie, which shall be full of sturdinesse. And when the wind is in that
door with us, how many be there that think upon their sins, and that groan
under such a burden, and therewithal look That such as are so distressed in
their hearts, would be full glad and feign, if they might find their
grave. Wherein he bewrays himself too speak through a brutishe and
unadvised affection, and that he keeps neither measure nor modesty. For he
confesses that we come too naught there. So then we see how he is fallen,
howbeit not with a deadly fall, but with a half fall, and God rayseth him up
again afterward as we shall see. Yet nevertheless the case stands so, as
we must verily condemn this infirmity here in Job: that is to say, he was
so dismayed with heaviness, as he could no more taste of Gods goodness,
thereby too gather never so little comfort too sustain himself by. But
forasmuch as we see that this befell unto him: so much the more must we be
earnest in praying unto God, that sorrow may not ouermate us so, as we
should be utterly overwhelmed by it. Therefore let us always be so
underpropped and stayed up, as we may fight against sorrowfulness, and feel
that it is good for us to live here according to Gods will, and that
although we have great griefs and troubles here, yet must we stand fully
resolved upon this point, that it is good for us too continue here still in
this world. And wherefore? To the end that God may be glorified in us, too
the end that our faith may be tried, to the end we should call upon him,
and profess him to be always our father, notwithstanding that he scourge us,
and to the end that by means thereof we may be prepared too the heavenly
life. This taste of the said fatherly goodness, must always make us desirous
to go unto God, and not suffer us too give bridle too any one outrageous and
beastly affection, as we see that Job has done here. And by the way he
shows, whence this heaviness came upon him, that had so wholly swallowed
him up, and from whence also it proceeds in those that are so dismayde as
they can not admit any comfort to assuage their myseries. He says, To the
man whose way is hidden, and which God has shut in, as if he had made the
hedges round about it, that no man should enter into it. This is well worthy to
be noted. For Job shows wherein he failed: namely in not yelding himself
enough to Gods providence. Yet notwithstanding, heerewithall he discovers a
disease whereunto all of us are subject. That is to wit, that we be desirous
to know all that must befall us, and what our state shall be: and all this we
would have declared to us: in so much that when we are in perplexity, so as
we know not what shall become of us, and that the inconvenience pincheth us,
and we see no end of it: then are we at the point of utter despair. Lo here
a mischief that is ouercommon and ordinary. And we must mark it well, to the
end we may seek the remedy on the contrary part. What then is the
inclination of men? It is, that they could well find in their hearts to leap
up too the clouds, too know what shall be the course of their whole life. And
we see how they determine with themselves, I will do this and that. Solomon
mocking at the ouerweening that is in m^n, says that they determine upon
their whole life: and whereas they that he has no rest, and that ^e is in
beauinesse before he take his repast: and yet notwithstanding (says he) I
have not behaved my self heretofore as most men do: I have not settled my
self in my prosperity, but I have continually feared the misery that is come
vppn me. Let us mark then this complaynt of Jobs. For on the one side it
shows, that his misery was extreme: and therewithal (says he) what is
the cause why GOD handles me so? For when God threateneth men, he says:
Forasmuch as thou have made thy self drunken in thine own pleasures:
forasmuch as thou have been as it were blinded by them: forasmuch as thou wart
so altered when I did thee good, that thou have not known me: thou may
see wherefore I intend to punish thee. And God shows precisely that he cannot
away with this fleshly selfeloue which is in men. For when they ween that they
shall always have ease at will, and when they shall say peace, and all is
safe: behold a sodayn storm shall overthrow them, which they forsaw not before
hand. We see then how god punishes this presumption and rashness that is in
men, who while they be in prosperity, believe they shall dwell in it for
ever, and in the mean season consider not that they are in the hand of God,
nor think upon their own frailty. But God cannot abide that, for when we be
at our ease, we must refer all unto God, and therewithal prepare ourselves
too be afflicted when it shall please him, and in such manner as he knows to
be expedient. So then, for as much as GOD threateneth those that are blinded
after that manner in their pleasures: Job beholding himself so sore tormented
and afflicted, was amazed at it, because he had not at any time sotted
himself in his abundance, but had always fore mistrusted the mischief that
was now lyghted upon him, and had not borne himself in hand that he should
from thencefoorth continue in the ease and prosperity that God had set him in,
like them that think no more of their mortal life, when God has once
advanced them above others. He says he had continually thought before hand on
the miseries that might happen unto him. How then happened it that he was so
overtaken? Although this thing cannot now be discoursed at length: yet may we
gather thereby in one word, that in as much as Job (who had always put himself
in a readiness to endure the adversity that God should send unto him) was
overtaken with such anguishe and so great: it stands us on hand to look to
have much worse, according to our deserts. And if God spare us and hold us up
for a time, let us not therevppon conceive any vain and fond imagination, to
think that no adversity can touch us. For if we think so, God must wake us
up in good earnest, and show what power and authority he has over us. What
must we then do? we

Now let us pray this good God, that it may please him to open our eyes, that
we may the better know what is needful for us, and that when we see too
how many wantes and miseries we be subject in this world, we may learn
to sigh and groan: and specially that forasmuch as we be hild here in the
bondage of sin, so as we can not serve our God in full liberty, we may long
for the kingdom of heaven, where we shall have full perfection and
enioyemente of the graces, whereof we have but a taste in this world: and also
where we shall be joined too our head Jesus Christ, to reygne with him in
everlasting glory. That it may please him to grant this grace not only too
us, but also to all, etc.

The fourtenth Sermon, which is the first upon the fourth Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth still the exposition of the two last verses of the
third Chapter, and then the fourth Chapter as follows.

1. ELiphas the The manite ansvvered and said.

2. If a man assay to talk, shall it grieve thee? And who can hold himself
from speaking?

3. Behold, thou have taught many, and thou have strengthened the vverie hands.

4. By thy words thou haste stayed them up that were falling, thou have
strengthened the vveake and trembling knees.

5. But now that the evil is come upon thee, thou art out of quiet: and
now that it has touched thee, thou art astonyed.

6. Is not this thy fear, thy trust, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy
vvayes?


Upon Jobs talk which we treated of yesterday, there remains to understand,
that when we be in prosperity we can not hope that God will continue it for
the time to come, nor let us be in rest still. For Job seems to meene, that
the faithful must alalways we know, that in our falling we can not light
otherwise than upon our feet, because we be hild up by the hand of God: nor
be utterly oppressed, because he releeueth us. We see then how we can not
be vexed with ouergreat unquietness, and yet we may be sore grieved in our
heaviness, not to withdraw our selves from God, and to make no account of
calling upon him, but to have our recourse unto him. To be short, there is
great diversity between the carelessness whereunto we be inclined by nature,
according to the disposition of our Eliphas the Themanite one of Jobs friends
that came too comfort him, is entered into talk against him. For he tells him
in effect, how he sees too well, that the fear of God and the pureness which
he seemed to have in outward appearance, was but hypocrisy, because he delte
so far out of square, and could not patiently receive the correction that God
sent him. But anon after he enters are his, when they be in distress. And the
scripture tells us, not only that God aydeth the afflicted, but also that he
draws those out of their graves, which seem to be already dead. Although
then that our afflictions be great and excessive, yet must we still hope for
Gods help, which doubtless will be beyond all the opinion of man, and
beyond all the means that we can conceive. And it is not in this Text only
that the Scripture speaks so: but it is a doctrine very ryfe through out. It
is said that the righteous man not only If a man attempt talk, or If a man
raise talk: for as well the one as the other may be spoken, because the
Hebrew wordhath a double signification. And forasmuch as the Hebrew word which
is put here for talk or speech, is sometimes taken also for a thing: Some
understand it thus: If God tempt thee, is it meet that thou should be so
far out of patience? If a man assay or atumpt too speak. And why so? For
Eliphas adds immediately, And who is be that can withheld him self from
speaking? As if he should say, thou art so far out of square against all
reason, that men must needs find fault with thee, and there is not the
myldest man in the world, but he should be constrained to rebuke thee, if he
saw thy outrageousnesse and thy behauing of thy self here like a sauge
beast. Therefore thou must be restrained, for thou would enforce the
meekest man alive too speak. Lo here the plain meening. But in effect
Eliphassis mind is, too show that Job has not walked aright, nor with a
clear conscience before God. Lo here the first point. Afterward he enters
into this general argument which I have touched: that is to wit, that the
righteous are never oppressed in that wise with affliction: but that it is
always a token of Gods vengeance. And therefore when he perceived that Job
was tormented in this wise, he deemed him to be a reprobate person. Thus ye
see the two points. And now let us come unto the first of them. He says
unto him, Thou bee^etofore baste taught the whole world, thou baste
strengthened the quiuering knees. Thou have refreshed the weerie hands, thou
baste amonded such as did amiss, thou have comforted such as were tormented:
and now when the misery is come upon thy self, I see thou art out of quiet:
and therefore I conclude, that the fear of God which thou have had, was no
more but the very same hope which thou pretendest: namely, that God should
always have been favorable unto thee. Too be short, thou haste served God
upon usury. It was not for that thou did give over thy self unto him in
good earnest, but in respect that thou did hope he would always have been
merciful unto thee, and so long thou could well find in thine heart to
serve him, but now that thou seelest him somewhat roughe, thou renouncest his
service. Whereby it is to be perceived, that there was nothing else but
hypocrisy in thee. Thus we see in effect, the whole ground of the discourse
that Eliphas makes here. But true it is, that we mark not what is in our
selves, when we either counsel other men, or comfort them, or rebuke them.
Every man can do that: yea even the most ideotes. For (as it is said in a
common proverb) it is easy for them that are in health, too comsort such as
are diseased. But if we can show by our own dooyngs, that the thing which
we speak unto others is in our selves, and that we speak it from the heart:
that is a true proof that we deal not deceitfully. We shall see diverse
that are as eloquent, and more eloquent than needs, and which can babble so
well too the purpose as ye would wonder, and they never want tongue, if it
be but too prattle. But if it happen that God do but fillip them with his
fingers end, they wot not what comfort or any thing else meeneth. What is
too be done then? When we speak too our neighbors, let us show unto them,
that the thing which we speak unto them with our mouth, is thoroughly grounded
in our hearts. Thus we see how we ought to proceed. Yet is it not meant
hereby, that we should cease to comfort and encourage our neighbors, and
to reprove one another. For they that pass not to chastize such as do amiss,
and to comfort such as are in heaviness, and to reform such as go astray:
show themselves to have no care, neither of God, nor of his service. For if

Seeing then that we perceive how God has so well provided for all things
which he knows too be behoosefull, as he will have his word too serve us
thoroughly in that behalf: ought not we to be much as in us lies) too serve
God with one common consent. True it is, that all men are not indewed with so
great gifts: but yet must every man consider his own measure, and employ him
self according as God has given him ability toward his neyghbors.
Therefore we must understand, that whatsoever God has imprinted in each of
us for the common buylding up of his Church, we must discharge our selves of
it, and according to the gifts that every of us has received, so must he
profit others, and all of us must communicate togythers, Was not thy fear
then a counterfea^nesse ^ were not thy hope and the simplicity of thy ways,
[so lykewise]? Here Eliphas means to show Job, that he had been an
hypocrite, and had not served God but for desire too seem and to be seen.
And certain it is, that if we serve not God (yea though we fear that we shall
have him against us:) it is but a slavish manner of service. For God will not
have us to be as hirelings in serving him: but he will have us to go to it
with a free courage, and to be so wholly given unto him, as we may say, Lord,
we be thine, and reason it is that every one of us should dedicate himself
unto thee, and labor to glorify thy name. We see then how we ought to have
a free heart in serving of God, and not be led to it by slauishe constraynt.
True it is that in some other textes it is rightly said that we may well serve
God, considering that we shall not be disappoynted of our labor, according as
it is said in the nintenth Psalm, and in other like places. But all this does
easily agree together, that is to wit, that in serving of God we must be led*
with a free minded affection: and yet nevertheless must assure ourselves, that
God will not suffer our labor to be unprofitable, according also as Saint
Paul speaks. God (says he) is rightuous, who promises that your travailing
shall not be in vain, so as it should be lost labor when you be so
persecuted. The holy Scripture is full of this doctrine, and specially it is
said in effect, that such as trust in God shall not loze their reward.
Then as touching the first point we may well have an eye too the promises
that God has made us, namely that we shall not loze our labor in serving
him, nor be disappoynted of our longing, but that our reward is great in
heaven: and yet notwithstanding that in the mean time the service that we do
unto God, must be free hearted: that is to wit, that when soever it pleases
him to plague us, we must not therefore cease to continue our obedience
toward him, and to walk in his fear, as well as when he dealt gently with
us, and mainteyned us in good plight. And in doing hereof ye see how we must
not look too have a hyrelings reward, to say, o I will serve God conditionally
that he deal with me after mine own desire. If we come too this point, it
is no serving of God after the manner of children: but after the manner of
those that be hired for wages by the day. What is to be done then? we must
have a freeharted affection too dedicate our selves wholly unto God and to give
our selves wholly to the serving of him, yea even as well in woe as in weal:
being well assured that our labor shall not be disappointed, when we

Now let us humble our selves in the presence of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us understand them better,
that we may dislyke them, and seek the remedies which he offers us, to
the end they may be corrected: and therewithal guide us in such wise in
this world, as we may desire nothing but to please him in all points and all
respects, and to follow his holy commandments. And so let us all say,
Almighty God our heavenly father, etc.

The fiftenth Sermon, which is the second upon the fourth Chapter.
This Sermon contains yet still the exposition of the sixth verse, and then
afterward as follows.

7. Consider I pray thee, who ever perished being an innocent? or where have
the upright been destroyed?

8. As I have seen, they that plough unrighteousness, and sovv incomberance,
gather the same.

9. They perished with the blast of God, and were consumed with the breath
of his mouth.

10. The roaring of the Lion, the noyze of the Libarde, and the teeth of the
Lions vvhelpes are dispatched.

11. The Lion perishes for want of pray, and the Lyonesses vvhelpes are
chaced away.


FIrst and foremost we have too bear in mind what was declared yesterday:
which is, that to serve God aright, we must be led should deal with us
after our own device: but rather determine with our selves to refer the
matter wholly unto him, and to submit ourselves wholly to his good will. Thus
we see the doctrine that we have to gather of this text, which is very
profitable for us. For it is a mark whereby to discern Hypocrites from Gods
children. An Hypocrite may well magnify God with full mouth in time of
prosperity. But if the world go against his desire, a man shall see that all
is changed with him. And what is the cause of it? It is for that such manner
of men bear no reverence to Consider if ever any rightuous man have perished,
Mark if the right dealing men have been rooted out. Eliphas (as I have said
already) takes here a good sentence, so as the reasons which he brings
here against Job are good and holy, notwithstanding that the case mind
casts such temptations before him, he must answer and say: It is true that
never rightuous man yet perished: it is true that the right dealing men can not
be roted out: but what is this perishing? it is more than to be only
afflicted. And wherefore? For the holy Scripture tells us that God rayseth up
the dead, that he gives courage to such as are utterly dismayed, and that he
recouereth such as are wounded to death. When the Scripture says so: is it
not to show that God utters his working toward all that are afflicted? Yes:
for when it is That such as sow extortion, or labor extortion, and such as
sow incomberance, shall gather the same. Which thing is confirmed by a
similitude. For Eliphas says that That the wicked had perished at the blaste
of God, and by the breath of his mouth. As touching the former sentence where
he said, that such as labor for iniquity and sow trouble or incomberance
etc. I say it is a similitude taken of the tillers of the earth. And the said
two words Iniquity and Trouble, or (which unrighteousness and incomberaunce,
are joined together in the Scripture, to signify the extortions and outrages
which the wicked commit, to vex and disquiet their neighbors: and also the
word Incomberance or trouble, is spoken of such as do nothing but toss and
turmoyle other men. And first it is said, that they Plough, because that they
which are so desirous to anoy their neighbors, and to do them some harm, do
make preparatiues, like as when the laborour intends to sow his ground, he
must first plough it, and the earth must first be tilled. Even so the wicked
consulte aforehande upon their ungraciousness, trecheries, and unlawful
doings, deuysing guyles and deceytes: and afterward when they have laid the
whole platform, they seek all means possible to put their lewd enterprises
in execution: and that is the very laboring [or tillage] that Eliphas speaks
of here. For he says, that heerevpon they sow incomberance: that is to say,
when they have made their preparations, they run upon poor men to fleece
them and to eat them up. But these men says he) do reap that which they
have sowed: that is to say, God makes all the mischief which they have
conceived and invented against others, to light upon their own heads. We
see here a sentence that is true, and we must take it as spoken by the holy
Ghost, even to gather a general lesson thereof. And to put it to the true use,
we must pray God to grant us the spirit of wisdom in that behalf, that we may
not wrest the Scripture this way or that way to draw it to a contrary sense,
as wesee that Eliphas has done. But whereas the holy Scripture says, that
such as plough iniquity and sow incomberance shall reap the same: it is a
threatening which God utters against the wicked, who think to advance
themselves highly when they play the ravenous beasts, fleecing one man and
eating up another: specially when they devour all, seeming to themselves to be
jolly conquerours, and standing in their own conceytes for doing so. But our
Lord tells them, that they beguile themselves very much: for he makes
all their enterprises to turn to their own confusion. Wherefore ye see a
threatening, whereby God purposes to repress the over boldness and
maliciousness of men, minding to hold them short, to the intent they may live
togiether in all good love and upright dealing, so as no man may labor to
hinder his neighbor: like as on the contrary side, we hear also the promise
which is given us in these words: he that sows blissednesse shall reap the
same. Saint Paul speaks this of Almesdeedes. He says that if we sow
upon our neighbors, that which God gives unto us, we shall gatheir it
again: in so much that we shall have abundance of his gracious gifts and
blissinges, and God shall shead out his riches upon us, and show himself
gracious and liberal toward us when we be in necessity. This promise then
serves to give the faithfuil a good mind too deal frankly with their
neighbors and to succor them. Now see we the true use of this lesson: which
is, that we must keep our selves well from practyzing any anoyance or
deceyte. And why so? So little shall we be able to advance our selves by
these wicked practyzes or other unlawful means: that God shall put us to
confusion in the end. We see then how we ought to repress all our wicked
lusts, that we may deal uprightly and reasonably with our neighbors. On
the other side, for as much as all noysomnesse and extortion displease God,
let us be well ware to behave our selves uprightly: that is to say, let us
labor to do well, so as every one of us may not only abstain from all
misdealing, but also consider that if God have given us any ability, we must
profit one another, and communicate mutually altogether. And hereunto let us
also gather together the sentences of holy Scripture which tend to the same
end. Cursed be thou that robbest, for thou shalt be robbed when thy turn
comes about. And afterward. Look what measure men himself when he intends
to repress such as are stubborn, or which devour all things, or which give
themselves to guilefulnesse to deceive their neighbors, and specially which are
full of cruelty and extortion to devour the whole world. God then needs
not to levy great powers of men to strengthen himself withal: he needs not
to seek means here and there how to overthrow them: let him but only blow
upon them, and behold all is dispatched. Now therefore we see that this manner
of speaking, (wherein it is said that the wicked perish at the that we must
be feign to walk through many miseries in this world, and to (be short)
although we be as it were among a thousand deaths, and perceive not as yet
the help that he promises, yet shall we not cease to be maintained by him
after a wonderful manner.

But let us fall down in the presence of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him to make us perceive them better than we have done
heretofore, and that in having an eye to his promises whereby he allureth us
so gently unto him, we may warrant

The sixteenth Sermon, which is the third upon the fourth Chapter.
12 But one thing has been brought to me in secret whereof mine ear has
heard a little.

13 Among the thoughts of night-visions when men are a sleep,

14 Fearfulness and trembling came upon me, and made my bones afraid.

15 The vvynde vvhisked here and there, and made the hair of my body to stare.

16 There stood one, and I knevve not his face: there was an Image before
mine eyes, and I heard a voice in silence.

17 Is man more rightuous than God? Is man more pure than his maker?

18 Behold, he finds no steadfastness in his servants, And he has put
vanity in his Angels:

19 How much more [then in] them that dvvell in houses of Clay, whose
foundation is duste, which are consumed and destroyed by the mouth?


AFter that Eliphas has showed his reason, that Job had not served God
faithfully, and with a pure heart, at least wise That a thing was brought too
him in secret, and that his ear had heard a little of it: Yea (says he) in
a vision by night, that I heard a blast which whisked hither and thither, and
at the last there was a voice, which spoke too me in silence. True it is that
he adds, that there was also an Image: and whereas he says he knew not
what it was, saving that he was abashed even that he shuddered all his body
over, and that the hears of his flesh stood staring up for fear and
astonishemente, and that he was as in a trance: all this tends to show,
that he reports no dreams here, but that it is the very testimony of God
which must be received with authority. And hereby we see that in all the
visions which the ancient fathers had, God did s^t certain tokens to amaze
them, and too put them in some terror and fear which served too authorize his
word, too the end it should be received the better. For we see how men are
not so well inclyned too hear God speak as they ought too be, except he
make them too feel his Majesty. If a man of some great estate speak unto
us, it is a wonder too see how we be more earnest too hearken unto him, than
we be too hear or read the holy Scripture. VVherof comes this, but of
that we be carnal and beastly? Now too remedy such faultiness, it has
pleased God too give always some tokens of his Majesty, too the intent that
his word might be received, that he heard a little of the said word,
shows well that he exalted not himself to far. For he takes not upon him
a perfection of wisdom, to say that nothing had escaped him, and that he
had comprehended every whit of it to the vttermoste: but he says he had some
taste of the said doctrine of God, and that he had conceived some part of it.
We see then that here he speaks modestly: declaring that he is not as an
Angel of heaven, so as he could behold Gods glory in full sight: but that
according to man's rudeness, he had been taught to know how to communicate,
that thing unto his neighbors, which he had received of God. Lo what he meant
to say in effect. And hereby we be admonished, that how familiarly so ever God
shows himself unto us: it is a great matter that we [be admitted to] know
things in part, and we must not think that we can have any so perfect
understanding, as there may be no lack in it. For they that think so of
themselves, beguile themselves, and thereby shet themselves out of the gate
that was open for them to come in before. And so let them mark well, that there
is much done for us, when we have any little taste, or any entrance into the
knowledge of Gods truth. If this be meant of the Prophets and teachers whom
God has chozen and ordained, and unto whom he has given most excellent
gifts, (as we see here an example in Eliphas:) what shall be said of us? for
he is set before us, not as one of the simple and common sort of people: but as
one to whom God himself has appeared: and yet he tells us he heard but a
little. Behold then what we have to mark in this first place. Truly were we
thoroughly persuaded of this, there should no such ouerweening be seen in our
talk. For every of us bears himself in hand, that he is ignorant in
nothing: and they that are least exercysed in the holy Scriptures, will needs
have this reputation of themselves, that they be so subtle and sharpwitted, as
they speak nothing but good reason, as though the holy Ghost were in their
sleeue. And whence comes such pride, but that they which are not yet out of
their apcee, imagine themselves to understand all things? And furthermore this
pride is accompanied with carelessness: for the most part pass not to perfect
themselves. And why so? They ween they be come to the perfection of all
knowledge: and many men when they have heard a two or three words of the
Gospel, ye shall see them so full of it, as they can be. They pass not for
learning of any more knowledge: no, they will needs teach other men: to be
short, they be more than Doctors. But God laugheth such presumption to skorne.
For the little that they might have received must be taken from them, and so
shall they go away empty, according to that which is written in the song of
the virgin Marie which is that such as are full of wind, esteeming themselves
rych, and standing upon their reputation: have bin starued for hunger. Then let
us learn to praise God in such wise for that which he has given us, and so to
know that we have That a breath (or wind) went to and fro, so as his to die
quaked and shuddered, and his hear stood up stiff throughout all his
body: and that there appeered an image unto him, which he knew not, and that
at the end he heard a voice of silence. All this was done to the end which I
have touched: that is to wit, to make Eliphas ready to receive that which God
purposed to say himself to be the party, that should bring the full
Revelation over and besides the Gospel. And by means thereof, they be utterly
become brute beasts. And at this day we see, that those poor beasts buzie
their heads about as doltishe and insensible things, as any can be. But it is
the just vengeance of God, who has given them over to a wilful stubborn
mind. As much has been done to other fantastical persons (and specially
of our days) which have troubled the Church, and would needs have their
visions. And it was one of the That he heard the voice in silence: It is too
show, that God had prepared him in such wise, as he bare away that which was
spoken unto him. For a man that is rauyshed as it were in a trance, may well
hear a thing, and yet have no remembrance of it when he comes again to
himself: and so there are many, who when they come too Sermons, do hear well
the matter that is treated of, but it settleth not in them, in so much that if
one ask them what was treated of, they cannot tell him one word. And Shall
man be rightuouser than God? and shall man be more rightuous than his maker?
Behold he finds no steadfastness (or truth) in his servants, he has
judged that there is folly (or vanity) in his Angels. And how shall they
do then which dwell in houses of Claye? In the first place here Eliphas
sets down the sentence, and as it were the Theme that he groundeth
himself upon: that is to with, that it is an unreasonableness in men, to
desire to glorify themselves in comparison of their maker. Must not men needs
be destitute of wit and reason, when they will so gloryfie them selves in
comparing themselves with God? Lo here his Theme or ground. And for as much
as men can not easily abide to have their own authority condemned: behold
here the reason which he adds too confirm his doctrine, which is, that if
God should examine his Angels, he should find fault in them, and he should
not find them steadfast: but they should perceive themselves to be vain and
weak creatures. Now if the Angels be such: what shall become of men, which
dwell in houses of Claye? For what is our body? what foundation has it? what
firmness so ever seems to be in it: there needs but one little shoure of
rain too wash it quite away. Then since the case stands so: let us now
assure our selves, that we can not stand in Gods presence, if we come
thither presuming to bring any righteousness of our own, considering that the
very Angels are not able too do that. Thus we see in effect what is said
unto us here. But we have too consider what is meant by the mention that is
made here of Angels. Some imagining it too be against reason that God should
not find his Angels thoroughly rightuous: have concluded, that it is not meant
here concerning those Angels that continued in their obedience to God, but of
those that are fallen and become renegates. For the Devils were once Gods
Angels, But they kept not the state wherein God had created them, but fell an
horrible fall, in so much that they are feign to be the mirrours of damnation.
We see then after what manner diverse have expounded this text: namely, that
seeing there was no steadfastness in these Angels which fell: what is to be
looked for in men whose foundation is of Clay? But we must not seek out forced
expositions to magnify the Angels. For this place speaks of Gods servants,
and the title is honorable. Eliphas would not have said, God has not found
steadfastness in his servants, but he would have said, Behold the Diuelles
which were heretofore appointed too the service of God: But now they be fallen
after such an horrible fashion, that by their fall all things are brought into
a wavering, in so much that eue^ mankind also is come to the like perdition,
and is drawn into the self same decay. Eliphas would have spoken so: but he
says, God found no truth in his Angels: he found folly or vanity: He
says not that he found Rebellion or backesliding, but he says only
vanity, which is a greater manner of speech. So then when all is well
considered, no doubt but Eliphas speaks here, of the Angels that serve
God, and give themselves wholly thereunto. And what means he then by saying
that there was no steadfastness, but rather vanity and unsteadfastness in
them? When Saint Paul says that there is none immortal but only God: it
is certain that he excludes all creatures. And yet we know that the Angels
are immortal spirits. For God has created them of purpose, that they should
not any more return to nothing, no more than the soul of man may at any time
dye. How then shall we make these sentences agree, that the Angels are
created to live everlastingly: and that there is none immortal that God
finds or puts (for the Hebrew word imports that God puts) folly or
vanity: it implies not that the vanity which is in the Angels comes of
God: but the meening of it is, that he puts it to them [or charge them
with it] by his judgment: that is to say, that as a judge he gives sentence
that there is folly and vanity, (that is to say, that there is faultiness) in
the Angels, yea and that they could not stand before him, if he would deal
rigorously with them. Verily this seems strange to such as are not
exercised in the holy scripture. But if we wiste what vanishe away by and by.
The^ if the case stand between God and us, let us learn to have good regard
to the one side, that is to wit unto God. True it is that we understand not his
mighty power as apperteineth: but the Angels (which are now much nearer to him
tha^ we be, and which behold his face) have no such perfection but that some
fault may be found in them, if he list to examine them with rigor. What shall
become of us then, if we consider our own weakness? what shall become of our
virtues, if we would compare the^ with the Angels which are so noble and
excellent

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him so to dispose us to the receiving of his word, as we
may not come to it heedlesly, as the things that we hear, may run in at the
one care and out at the other, but that we may bear them away, and imprint
the^ thoroughly in our hearts, to make us change our wicked affections, and to
renounce our selves: that being quite rid of all vain trust in our selves,
we may desire nothing but to worship the great God, and to yield him the
praise that he deserves, specially for the inestimable grace that he gives us
in our lord Jesus Christ, and for the love that he has showed us in him, in
that he spared him not, but delivered him to death for us, and that he may make
us so to feel the fruit and effectualnesse which he has purchased us by his
death and passion, as in the end we may be received as righteous and
giltlesse by God his father. That it may please him to grant this grace, not
only unto us but also. etc.

The seuententh Sermon, which is the fourth upon the fourth Chapter, and the
first upon the fifth Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth still the exposition of the xviij. and xix, verses of
the fourth Chapter, and then as follows.

20 From morning to Evening they be destroyed, and because no man sets his
mind upon it, they perish for ever.

21 Does not their excellency go away with them? they shall perish, [but]
not in wisdom.

Now follows the fifte Chapter.

1 CAll now if there be any to aunsvvere thee, and consider any one of the
Saints.

2 Doubtless, Anger sleaeth the fool, and envy kills the vvitlesse person.


WE have seen already whereunto this talketendeth: that is to they not peerce
to the hearts of us. And here we see why we be warned to think upon it the
better. Surely if we could reckon our years as Moses speaks of the^ in the
xc. Psalm certesse we should be taught as well to think upon death, as also
to tend to the mark that God calls us to. But what? we wot not how to count
the^ upon our fingers. For behold our childhod is such, that they which are in
it, differ little or nothing from brute beasts, saving that there is more
inco^brance and trouble with them: but as for understanding or reason, there is
small or none in That men dwell in houses of Clay, and that their foundation is
but duste. That is to say, if we consider this present life by it self,
wherein consists it? In being enclosed within lodgings that tend but to
corruption. And what else are those but our bodies? Behold then what our
steadfastness is: that is to wit, that every whit of it goes incontinently
unto dust, and we be consumed either by woormes or by wind: that is too say,
we be dispatched as soon as a worm which is but a thing of naught, and
which we scarce esteem as a living creature: and yet are we consumed sooner
That men perish and are c^nsumed from morning unto evening. Some expound
this, as though it were meant that men perish in small time: and that is very
true. But herewithall there is yet more: that is to wit, that we pass not a
minute of our life, but it is as it were an approaching unto death. If we
consider it well, when a man rises in the Morning, he is sure he shall not
step forth one pace, he is sure he shall not take his repaste, he is sure
he shall not turn about his hand, but selu^s when it shall come to the point
to do God service, both with our bodies and our souls. But forasmuchas we see
that he needs but to turn his hand, and behold we be at the last cast: ought
we not to be much more earnester to run? according also as the Scripture
exhorts us, showing us that this life here is but a race, and therefore we
may not go loyteringly, but every man must chere up himself, and prick and
spur forward himself. Thus we see what we had as yet to note upon this
sentence, where it is said that men are consumed away from morning That they
perish for ever, because no man thinks upon it. A man might demand here,
whether we shun death when we think not upon it. For in the nine and forty
Psalm, it is said that the wise men and fools are gathered all into one herd
So then it behooves us to understand, that all mankind is shet up under this
necessity of dying. And wherefore then is it said here, that all perish for
ever, because none think of it? First of all Eliphas meant to tea^he us here,
that men do as it were wex our eyes: and when we be come unto our God, and have
acknowledged the miserable plight wherein we be, we must assure our selves, that
God will reach out his hand unto us, because he seeks nothing else but to
succor us, and to draw us out of the darkness wherein we be by nature. Thus
we see what we have to mark in effect. And immediately after, it is said,
That the exceliencie of men shall be taken away in them, and that they shall
perish [and] not in wisdom. True it is, that it behooves us to be humbled by
death: that is to wit, that God should bereue us of all Not in wisdom. For
he intends always to condemn men because they be so blockishe, as they
never think upon themselves. The^ let us mark, that it is great wisdom to
prepare our selves unto ^^ath, and to pass through it cheerfully when we come
at it. I say we shall have profited greatly, and be reputed for wise in Gods
sight, when we shall have learned this present lesson thoroughly, and be able to
put it in ure to receive fruit by it: and yet notwithstanding we see how every
man shunneth He shall not find any faithful man of his sort, nor of his
company, but that he is as a man utterly forsaken of God. Hereby we see, that
when he spoke of men heretofore, he took them as they are in their own proper
nature: that is to wit, without having any respect too the special grace
which God gives too those that are his in opening his kingdom unto him, in
giving the^ the hope of salvation, in governing them by his holy spirit, and
in making the^ to go to a better and an everlasting life. Eliphas then meant
here, to set me^ down in their own proper state and plight, such as they be
of their own selves, during the time that they be separated from God. And this
appears in that he says to Job, Thou can not find so much as one faithful
man of thy sort, or whom thou may call thy companion. Why so? For (says
he) Anger sleaeth the fools, and Envy, (or spite, or fretting, or choler, or
moodinesse, which gnaweth a man like a wild beast) is the thing (says he)
which kills the witless. But certesse, according as I have declared already,
Eliphas does amiss in applying this to the person of Job: yea and he does him
great wrong in it. Yet notwithstanding, this doctrine ceasseth not to be both
true and very profitable. As how? That is to wit, that as often as we be
chastized at Gods hand, we must have an eye to those that have gone before us,
to see whether they have suffered the like torments and anguish or no. For if
we see Gods children to have traced the path before us: it must not grieve us
to be joined with the^. As how? We see that the holy fathers which were far
excelle^ter tha^ all other men, have endured adversity, no men more. Now if
God have not spared the^: why should we challenge more privilege tha^ they had?
So the^, as often as we see that Gods children have been beaten with diverse rods,
and vexed with many miseries and greeses: we have wherewith to comfort
ourselves, and to chere up our hearts. For we must always have an eye to the end,
how God never forsook them, but pityed them when they were come to such
extremityes. So must we also hope that he will doas much for us. Mark this for
a special point. Furthermore if we will have God to be pitiful and
merciful unto us in our adversities: let us beware that we frette not against
him, and that we kick not against the spur. For if we do, then shall this
sentence be verified upon us, That anger sleaeth the fools: as if it were
said, that such as chafe and grind their teeth against their afflictions,
show the^selue to have profited evil in Gods schole. And what shall they gain
by it in the end? It shall be a doubling of their misery. When they shall
have fomed out their rage against God, or when they shall have spewed out their
blasphemies: do they think they have won their prize by it? Alas, it may not
be so: they deceive themselves too much. For (as I have said already) it
shall be but a doubling of their misery. Lo how Anger sleaeth the fool.
Moreover when they have a spite at others, and stand pleading against God for
dealing roughlyer with them, than

Then let us humble our selves before the throne of his majesty, beseeching
him to make us perceive our faults, in such sort, as we may become our own
judge in preventing his judgment, to the intent that being so condemned by our
own selves, we may desire nothing but to please him in all respects, until
he have bereft us of this mortal body, and delivered us from the bondage of
sin (wherein we be as yet shut up) to take us into his heavenly kingdom. And so
let ^s say, Almighty God and heavenly father. etc.

The eightenth Sermon, which is the second upon the fifth Chapter.
3 I have seen the fool taking root, and immediately I have cursed his house.

4 His children shall be far from help, they shall be trodden down in the
gate and no man shall deliver them.

5 The hungry shall eat up his harvest, and pick it out of the midst of the
thorns, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.

6 Misery comes not from out of the duste, neither does trouble grovve out
of the earth.

7 But man is borne to travel, and the sparks fly vpvvarde.


WE have seen heretofore what they win which repine against God, and accuse
him of cruelty, and pass their bounds into all impaciencie* that is to wit,
that they make their case the worser, and that they must be consumed in their
fretting and rage. I have cursed the fool notwithstanding that he had taken
root, yea and I have cursed his house immediately. When he speaks of taking
root: it is to express, that it seemed well that the prosperity should have
continued firm and stable. If Eliphas had said, I have seen the fool
advanced aloft to great dignity: he had not expressed so much as he does. For
he says he is planted, because the despizers of God and all perverse and
froward folk, hope to have fortune always in their sleeue. And like as a tree
that is thoroughly well sattled and deeply rooted in the ground, stands fast
though it be shaken with winds and storms: eue^ so it seems that after God
has once aduau^ced the wicked, they shall reygne continually, and their
triumphs shall never come to an end. But Eliphas says, that when he saw such
a likelihod, he forbear not to curse the wicked out of hand: and he says out
of hand or immediately, meening that he tarried not till there came a change, as
we commonly do, who at the first blushe, when we see the despizers of God to
be in their chief ruff, and to have the wind at their stern as they term
it, do linger the time and are as it were astonished, saying, what will this geere
prove to? If we perceive the^ to be falling into decay: the^ we change our
mind: but so long as we see the^ flourish, we wot not what to say, we be at
our wits end. Contrariwise Eliphas tells us, that he was not abashed a whit
at the matter, but spoke his mind according to that which God had uttered. For
his coming to give judgment and co^demnatio^ here, is not of his own head and
after his own fancy: but he declares that according as God shows us that
the wicked shall be confounded in the end, so he grounded himself thereupon, and
was not shaken from it by any temptation, but although he had seen the wicked
fly so high a pitch, yet he hild still at one stay, saying: They must needs
come to naught. Now we see in effect what is contained here. And let us apply
this lesson to our own use, that we may know how agreeable the same is unto
us. True it is that we have not to do with that co^de^ning of other me^: for
it stands every man in hand, rather to look unto himself, and that is the
thing whereunto every one of us must apply his indeuer. For those that meddle
so hastily with the judging of their neyghbors, forget themselves, and God will
not spare the^ though they flatter themselves: they must be feign to come
before their judge, who will handle them rigorously, because they ouerslipt
themselves so much in their own faults. Let us note then, that our mind must
not gad here and there to seek out the evil that is in our neighbors: but
every man must enter into himself, and examine his own state and life: and
when we find any fault in our selves, we Curse, let us mark that it gives
not us scope to wish the mischief or confusion of the party, (I mean
through desire of vengeance, as oftentimes we be so carried away by our
passions, as there rayneth nothing in us but hartburning and bitterness, or at
leastwise a foolish and indiscreet zeal:) But whereas it is said that Eliphas
cursed the wicked man's house: it imports nothing else, but that he hilde him
to that which the Scripture teaches and shows us. And therefore it is not
for us to be judges: for it were too great a rashness, if we should take so
much pre-eminence upon us as to say, O, that man shall make an evil end, o^
such a man shall come to shame. A man must not presume so far: but it
belongs to God only to curse or to bliss. On our part we have no more to
do, but to agree to that which he says, answering, So be it Lord, thou only
art the co^petent judge of all the world. Then does it behoue us to harken
what he tells us, and to obey his saying without any replying to the
contrary, or without any demanding how it should be possible to be done, or
how it may be gone in hand with. For if God have once spoken the word, every
one of us must hold himself contented with it. Now we see what this word
Curse imports. It remains that we gather the whole sum of that which is
contained here. For these two temptations which are cast in our way are so
common, that every of us feels himself to have need to be armed against
it: for we shall ever be in danger of miscarying, unless we take hold of the
conclusion that is set down here. Therefore whenever we be outrageously
misintreated by the wicked, and that they have us at any advantage, so as it
should seem they would devour us, and that we have no means to put them
from us: let us make much of this sentence, and call it to remembrance, that
in the end God will not suffer the wicked to ruffle it out continually (for
he is well able to redress things amiss) which thing we may be sure of,
seeing that he shows it us in very effect and by experience. Behold here an
inestimable comfort for the faithful when they be oppressed and tormented
wrongfully: which is, too know that those which so persecute them, are
cursed of God. And furthermore let us understand on the contrary part also,
that our afflictions are blissed: that is to say, that although the world
esteem us as wretches, so as we be a gazing stock, and have our fleeces eaten
from our backs, yea and be also troubled and tormented: yet for all this, God
ceasseth not to dispose things in such wise, as the evil is too vswarde
turned into good, and all this their dealing shall further our welfare. Behold
how the children of God ought too cheer up themselves in the mids of their
sorrows. And here we see why it is said in the Psalm, that God will cut
asunder the cords of the wicked, which draw the plough upon the back of his
Church: namely to the intent that good men should not stretche out their
hands to do evil, as commonly shows it self, because God has said it*
and that must suffize us. Moreover, let us learn to say it as it is contained
here. For Eliphas meeneth not that he hard other men report, behold such a man
shall be curssed, or he shall be unhappy: but he says he trusted in God
that it should be so. And although he saw things confused in the world: yet
notwithstanding, he was fully persuaded that none were blissed but the children
of God, and such as honored him, and leaned altogether too his goodness, yea
and that although they were persecuted, and mocked, That the children of them
that despise God, shall fall down in the Gate, and shall be set far from
salvation, and no man shall succor them. He does us too understand, that if
God accomplish not his judgments here, he can well work them Cate signifies
judgment, because men's caces are wont too be debated there, and it was the
place where common assemblies were made, and finally it was the seat of
justice. And this is it that is meant in the Psalm where it is said, that the
children of good men and of such as are blissed of God, shall be mainteyned
in the Gate, and put their enemies to confusion. Likewise on the contrary part
it is said in this text that the children of the wicked shall stumble, and be
crushed in pieces, yea even by plain justice. Whereby it is the better
expressed, how God persecuteth them openly, so as it is apparent to the eye,
that it is he which lays his hand upon them. For he adds immediately, That
no man shall succor them. For when God myndeth too put That the goods of
such men shall be devoured by the hungry, yea even too the picking out of
their corn from among the thorns: so as not only their fields shall be
reaped by their enemies, who shall devour al their substance: but also men
shall scrape altogether that is between the hedges, so as if there be any
thing hidden, (and it be but a two or three ears of corn among the bushes,)
it shall be gleaned up. Hereby Eliphas meeneth, that Gods judgments upon the
wicked, are not like unto the corrections which he sends too his children:
but that he shows how he has utterly cast them off, and that he pitieth
them not any more, and that he will not have them feel any more of his
fatherly goodness, because he acknowledges them not for his. Lo what the
effect is of that which is spoken here. And hereupon we have now too call too
mind what I have declared before: that is too wit, that if we be troubled,
vexed and tormented by the wicked: we must patiently abide Gods leisure till
he put too his hand too succor us. And although we perceive not Gods
judgments at the first pushe: yet notwithstanding let us assure our selves,
that he will execute them in due time and place. Also when we see the
execution of them, let the same make us too stand in awe: and sith we see
his vengeance is so horrible, let us bridle our selves, and beware we tempt
not God, as Saint Paul also exhorts us. Let no man abuse you (says he)
with vain words. For by reason of such things, the vengeance of God is
wont too come upon the unbelievers and stubburne persons. Therefore when
God does so show us his judgments, let us quake at them, and let us stand
in fear and awe of him, submitting our selves wholly to that which he says
and utters. And this is it that he adds (howbeeit that it cannot be
expounded at this present) namely, that it becomes us too yield our selves
in such wise too Gods will, as we may answer So be it too all that ever he
says unto us, assuring our selves that things fall not out by chance in this
world: nor that it is long of the earth, air, or heaven that men are
afflicted: but that men bear their bane in themselves. Then let us acknowledge
it, and when there happen any afflictions in the world, let us be sure it is
the hand of God, which lights upon us for our sins, and that all the
mischief comes of our selves, and that we have the very welspring and
groundworke thereof within us. Let us (I say) acknowledge this, to the end we
may mislyke of our selves in our vices, and thereupon pray God to draw us to
himself, and to make his graces which he has put intoo us, auaylable to our
salvation, that being mainteyned by his power which he has openly showed
toward us in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we may be able to prosper
through his blissing.

And let us cast our selves down before the presence of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel the^ in such wise,
as we may return to him in true repentance, and suffer our selves to be
governed henceforth by his hand, yea after such manner, as his holy name may
be glorified by us in all our whole life. And so let us all say, Almighty
God and heavenly father. etc.

The nintenth Sermon, which is the third upon the fifth Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth yet still the exposition of the sixth and seventh
verses, and then as follows.

8 But I will reason with God and turn my talk unto God.

9 It is he that does great works, yea even unsearchable works, and which
does vvonderfull deeds without end.

10 Which gives rain upon the earth, which makes the waters to gushe
down the streets:


I Began heertosore to tell what is meant by this saying, That trouble comes
not out of the earth, nor misery out of the dust, but that man is borne to
labor. For when we be troubled with any inconvenience, we gaze about us
here and there, and search all corners of our wits, to find the cause of it
out of our selves, and yet of all the while we perceive not that God scourges
us for our sins, and that the fountain of all the adversities and mishaps
that we endure here below, must be sought for in our own life. Then are we
warned by this sentence, that when we hear speaking of selves in hand with
this or that. Wherefore? for there is no more room for flatteries, when God,
who is a consuming fire, appears, and makes us to come nere unto him, so as
we perceive how it is he that makes the mountains to melt, and is able to
make clean riddance of all things. Therefore when we know this greatness of
God, needs must we sink under it, and forget all pride. Thus much concerning
the intent of Eliphas. But now must we consider this doctrine, to apply it to
our selves. First of al, as often as we feel not our selves sufficiently wakened
fruit: herein he leaves not himself without good record, but it is all one
as if he should plead his own case and say: Whereas men have not known my
glory and majesty, nor perceived that I have all things in my hand to govern
the things that I have created: there is no reason why they should allege
ignorance: for by the very order of nature, they might have perceived how
there is one creator which disposes all. So then, let us but open our eyes,
and we shall have proofs ynowe to show us what the greatness of God is, to
the end we may learn That Gods works are great and unable too be searched
out, and that he does wonderful decdes without number. Here Eliphas takes a
general sentence, and afterward imagination: No, God will hold us short of
that, so as we shall not know but in part: but in the mean season, the said
knowledge must suffyze us, for as much as nothing shall be hidden from us,
that is good and convenient too our welfare. And therefore let us content our
selves herewith. For otherwise what an unthankfulness is it for us too be
desirous too enter so intoo Gods secrets, as to read therein, and that we
would not have any thing too escape us, but are so fond and curious as to have
a desire to make him subject to our fond That God is he which does wonderful
deeds without end. Whereas Gods wor^ are called wonderful, or secret (for so
the word imports:) it is to bring us to the reuerencing of the^. For Gods
meening is not, that our knowing of such greatness in his works, should be to
astonish us, and to drive us further off from him: but contrariwise to draw us
to such a reverence, as we should honor him, saying: that they have none end.
Whereby men are yet better humbled. For it we chance to come to the full
understanding of some one thing: O it seems to us that nothing can go beyond
us: we be so cunning, that all questions which can be propounded unto us shall
be assoiled out of hand. But put the case we be able to judge of Gods works,
as of two or of three, or of a hundred: What is that? It is right naught. And
why so? For they are without number. But (as I have said already) the least of
Gods works is enough to ouerwhelme us: and what then shall become of us, when
we come to the said bottomless depth whereof there is none end? Lo how it
behooves us to wey well that which is spoken here generally in way of preface,
to make us to enter into better consideration of all Gods works than we are
wont to do, that we may yield the honor unto his Majesty which is due to him.
But (as I have touched heretofore) after that Eliphas has spoken so in
general, he speaks particularly also, saying: That God gives rain upon the
earth, and makes the waters to gush down the streets. This seems to be
nothing to the purpose. For the matter in hand, is only that men may perceive
themselves to be rightly punished, and that if God handle the^ after his own
will, they must not stand pleading against him, for they shall gain nothing by
so doing, but must of necessity be overcome. And why the^ is mention made here
of the rain? This should seem to be a bymatter. But we must mark, that when
we be put in mind of the common order which God keeps in gouerniug his
creatures: it is to the end that we should apply it al wholly to our own use.
For when we have run up and down, and trauersed from one side to another, we
must enter into our selves, we must waken up our wits, and we must apply all
this doctrine too such use as I have spoken of, which is, that we may honor
God as he deserves. Thus ye see why here is mention made of the rain. And no
doubt, but that under one particular, Eliphas co^prehendeth them all, as if he
should say: We not only see that God has created all things, and that there
is such workmanship in the skies and in the earth, as al they that think upon
it must needs be astonished at it: but also we see how he guides and disposes
all things, gives rain and wind, and sends

Now let us cast our selves down in the presence of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our offenses, beseeching him too make us know them better
than we have done: and above all things to hold us in such awe under his
Majesty, as we may be touched too the quick, and be no more so dull as
we have been heretofore: but may know after what manner we ought too judge
of all his works, and therewithal have an eye too that which is in them,
according as he shows it unto us by his word, too the intent that we
humbling our selves under the greatness of his Majesty, may desire nothing
but too glorify his name in all points, not only with our mouth, but also in
very deed: and show that he is well worthy too reign over us, and that
all things both great and small ought to humble themselves unto him and to
honor him. That it may please him too grant this grace, not only too us, but
also to all people and Nations of the earth. etc.

The twentieth Sermon, which is the fourth upon the fifth Chapter.
11 It is in him too exalt the despised, and [to bring] them to safety which
are vexed at the heart.

12 He disappoynteth the thoughts of the wicked, in such wise as their
hands do not the thing that they enterprise.

13 He ouertaketh the wise in their own vvilynesse, and disappoynteth the
determination of the crafty.

14 So as at noonetyde they walk in darkness, and grope about them in the*
rode day light as in the night.

15 He plucketh away the oppressed from the svvord, from the mouth, and from
the hand of them that are too strong.

16 So is there hope for hereafter for the oppressed, and the mouth of
wickedness shall be stopped out.


WHere as it is said here, that God exalts such as are despised: it is a
sentence well worthy to be borne that God plucketh him back too safety,
which is vexed at the heart. If we be so tormented with adversities, as we be
in extreme anguishe: let us learn to call upon our God, since he chalengeth it
as his office to save those that are in such distress as they are able too
endure wrapped, he has also all manner of filthiness, gore blood, and all
manner of uncleanness, as the Prophet speaks there. We see then what our
state is till God have made us clean. And so seeing that every one of us
already knows in him self, and in his own behalf, how God has exalted
us, calling us to the hope of the kingdom of heaven and of eternal life, yea
and that he has plucked us even out of the bottomless pit of death, and
clenzed us from our so stinking filthiness: have we not cause too hope for
the like hereafter? And therefore that he breaks the determinations of the
wicked, too the end that their hands should not accomplish any of their
enterprises. We see here yet one comfort more, which it behooves us to mark
well, that we may be pacient in this world, that which they imagined. True
it is that we shall not perceive how this is done: and that is, to the intent
we should know how God works after a wonderful fashion, and therefore that
his gracious goodness must needs appear the better thereby toward us. So
then let us mark well what is said here in effect: namely that God suffers
the wicked to have store of wiles and subtle devises, so as it may seem that
they shall utterly overthrow the whole Church: or else that if they go about
to oppress some one man, or two, or three, it is likely that God ouertaketh
the wise in their own wylynesse, and that the determination of the wicked is
defeated, yea even in such wise as they stumble in the open light, as in the
dark, and grope about them at noone days as in the night. Here Eliphas not
only declares that God will not suffer the wicked to accomplish that which
they had let us flee to the goodness of God, who will easily find means
unknown to us. But above all things, when soever we see that the wicked
persecute us for the quarrel of the Gospel, let us not doubt at all but God
will utter his power after a special manner in that behalf. Like as in these
days it is true that Gods enemies are full enough of subtle devises: and they
have a master (that it is to wit the devil) which has his shop well
furnished with such stuff. If the Pope and all his adherents have not wyles
ynow in them, the devil will forge ynow for them. And That God ouertaketh the
wise in their wylynesse. When Eliphas uses this word wise: he does it after
the manner of men, who glorify themselves in that behalf. VVisdome before God:
let us look that we rid and clenze ourselves from all hypocrisy: for the
woorst wiliness in the whole world, is when men would beguyle God not that
they say they will do it, nor that they use any such language, but so it is
that they have it printed in their heart. And it is not without cause that the
Prophet Esaye says. VVo be to you that dig caves under the earth, as who
should say ye could hyde your selves in them: from whom? even from God
himself. And this is ouerryfe now adays. What is to be seen in all the
world? for that God delyuereth from the sword and from the hand of them that
are too myghtie, and that he which is afflicted shall have hope hereafter,
and that the mouth of wickedness shall be stopped. This is added further for
the comfort of Gods children. For what else is our state in this world than a
tormenting well humbled or brought low. And why so? Because that poverty is
the true scholemistresse to bring men to meeldnesse that they may not We see
then how we ought to be the better confirmed to trust in God, that as he has
begone so he will continue to the end, and that if his poor Church be
threatened or conspyred against, so as she seems to be already as good as
half oppressed: yet notwithstanding he both can and will remedy all things.
And why so? for he has said it, and he has not forgotten his cunning, he
knows the means, howebeit that they be unknown unto us. Therefore let us
tarry his leisure patiently. And in conclusion he says: That there shall be
hope for the afflicted for hereafter, and the mouth of wickedness shall be
stopped. Here is declared unto us for what purpose all that we have herd
hitherto has bin spoken: that is to wit, to the intent we should learn to
trust in God: for that is a very hard matter to do. True it is that every
man will protest that he trusts in God: but this trusting imports much more
than we can tell how to utter: in so much that even they which shall have
studied this lesson all their life long, shall have profited well, if they have
learned but half of it: that is to wit, to be thoroughly persuaded that God
will The hope for hereafter. And why so? for we must hope against hope: that
is too say, if we mind to sh^we that we trust in God in good earnest, there
must be no likelihod of hope to the worldward, for us to trust unto, but death
must hem us in on all sides, and we must be so ouercast with darkness in that
re spect, as there may not be one spark of light to comfort us. To be short,
we must have nothing left us save only That the mouth of wickedness shall be
stopped, which is as much to say, as the wicked shall not know how to reply
against Gods judgment. On our part it behooves us to have our mouth open to
glorifye God. For we must not resemble the wieked, who being confounded cease
never a whit the more to blaspheme God and to grynde their teethe at him,
although they have not what to reply against him. And this is the same saying
which closes up the hundredth and seventh Psalm, where Gods providence is
spoken of. For there it is said, that after God had punished the inhabiters of
the land for their sins, so as one sort of them were vexed with war or
sickness, and another sort suffered much inconvenience both by Sea and by
land: when he comes to the delivering of them, from all their miseries, the
good men have whereof to glorify him, and therewithal the mouth of
wickedness is stopped, that is to say, although the wicked dooers desire
nothing but to mock God, and to cast out skoffs against him: yet must they be
shet up, and they may not know what to say, but be utterly confounded for
shame. By the report of this, we know what Gods providence is in governing
things here beneath. And when we see his judgments so manifest, let us learn
to glorify his holy name, and therwithall let us flee unto him in all our
adversities: and when he shall have succored us, let us render thanks unto him
accordingly. Now let us cast down ourselves before the presence of our good
God with acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to voutsafe to make us
perceive them better than we have done, to the intent that we knowing how
unworthy we are to be helped at his hand, may be so much the willinger to
resort unto him for succor, following the way which he shows us: that is to
wit, that we may come to our Lord Jesus Christ to find grace by his means
before the heavenly throne: and that we may come thither displeased with
ourselves for our sins, beseeching him to clenze us from them, to the intent
that nothing may hinder us of our resorting unto him, and of the obteining of
all our requests, according as he shall perceive to be expedient for us. That
it may please him to grant this grace, not only unto us but also to all
people and Nations of the earth, bringing back all poor ignorant souls from
the miserable bondage of error and darkness, to the right way of salvation,
for the doing whereof it may please him to raise up true and faithful
ministers of his word, that seek not their own profit and vaineglorie, but
only the advancement of his holyname* and the welfare of his flock: and
contrariwise root out all sects, errors and heresies, which are seeds of
trouble and division among his people, to the end we may live in good brotherly
concord, etc.

The.xxj. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the fifth Chapter.
17 Behold, the man is blissed whom God corrects: Therefore refuze not
thou the chastizement of the Almighty.

18 It is hethat makes the vvound, and which by ndeth it up [It is he] which
smyteth, and which brings life.


HEretofore Eliphas has declared what the power of God is, that we might be
in the better readiness too receive the doctrine which he adds. For we see
what the cause is why we be not so teachable as were requisite, namely, because
we know not what the majesty of God is, that (...)stand in awe of it.
Therefore we have need to show, that the man is blissed whom God
chastises, and therefore that we must not refuse the corrections of the
Almighty. If a man should tell us that God does men no wrong when he
becomes their judge and uses great severity and rigor toward them:
verily this ought to touch us near enough: but yet we would be so astonished
at this doctrine, as if a man had given us a knock on the head with a beetle.
What is to be done then? There that God byndeth up the wounds which he has
made, swaddling them, and laying playsters too them, and making them whole. Ye
see then how Eliphas restreyneth this sentence to those in whom God makes
his chastizementes too turn too true amendment. But this sentence will be
somewhat with the darkest, if it be not laid forth somewhat more at large,
that ye may have a sure and clear resolulion of it. Let us mark how God
works toward the castawayes. True it is that he exhorts all men to
repentance when he chastizeth them (as I have said already) and it is all one
as if he should wake them up and say* know your faults, and continue no
longer in them, but return unto me, and I am ready to show you mercy. But
yet for all that, it is well known that the said chastisements profit not all
men, and also that he gives not al men the grace to return unto him. For it
is not enough for God to strike us with his hand, except he touch us within
also by his holy spirit. If God soften not the hardness of our hearts, it
will fall out with us as it did with Pharao. For men are like unto stithies or
Anuilds: the beating upon them is not able to change their nature, for we
Adversities. When we endure any hunger, thirste, cold, or heat, we say
that every one of these is an adversity. Why so? for we would feign have
our own appetites and desires. And in good soothe this manner of speaking (to
say that the mishapes which God sends upon us are adversities, that is to say
things against us) is not without reason. Nevertheless we must understand
the end of them: namely that Gods scourging of us is because of our sins And
therefore let us not be beguyled by flattering of our selves. Furthermore I
have already told you, not only that it is requisite for us to consider,
that Gods scourging of us is because he hates sin, and that his summoning
of us before him, is to make us feel him to be our judge: but also that he had
need to reach out his arms unto us, and to show us that he is ready to be at
one with us when so ever we shall come to him with true repentance. So then
we perceive, that they whom God chastyzeth are happy, notwithstanding that
we shun adversity as much as we possibly can. Also we shall never consent to
this doctrine to receive it with our heart: until faith have made us to behold
the goodness that God uses toward his servants, when he draws them back
to himself. And that we may the better comprehend this, let us mark what
becomes of men when God leaves them to themselves, and makes no countenance
of clenzing them from their sins. Look upon a man that is given too all
evil: as for example, let us take a despyzer of God: if God let him alone
and seem not to chastyze him, ye shall see such a one harden himself, and
the Dyuell shall carye him still further and further: and therefore it were
much better for him, that he had bin chastized sooner. And so, the greatest
mishap that can light upon us, is when God suffers us to welter in our own
wickedness: for the^ must we needs rotte away in it in the end. Verily it
were greatly to be desired, that men would come unto God of their own accord
without spurring, and that they would cleave unto him without any warning given
them of their faults, and without any rebuking of them: this (I say) were a
thing greatly to be wished, yea and moreover, that there were no fault in us,
and that we were as Angels, desyring nothing but to yield obedience to our
maker, and to honor and love him as our father. But forasmuch as we be so
froward, that we cease not to offend god: [and besides sentence. Howbeit
forasmuchas we cannot well apply this doctrine to our use, without the adding
of that which follows: let us join them both together. It is said, Refuse
not the correction of the Almighty: for be that has made the wound, binds
it up, and lays convenient playsters to it, and when he has sent the
malady, he heals it. Here we are exhorted, not to refuze Gods corrections.
And the cause thereof is added byandby: that is to wit, because God will give
it a good issue. Lo wherein consists the said happiness whereof Eliphas
has made that God will beale the wounds which ^e has made. True it is that
this healing pertayneth not to all men, but only to such as receive his
corrections meekely. And by the way let us mark, that God will have all
men put in mind to return unto him, considering the gentleness which he
shows them. But what? There are many which taste not the thing that is
contained here: and this also is the cause why we see so much impacience, so
much murmuring, and so much blasphemy used against God. The corrections light
on all through out, but where is the repentance? There is none at all. But we
see how it seems that men had conspired to withstand God to the uttermost.
Why is that? Because there are very few that conceive this present doctrine,
or that receive the said promise to say, Lord it is thine office too bind
up the wounds which thou have made, and to heal the sore. And therefore
let us remember well this lesson, specially seeing it is so often repeted. For
it is not only in this sentence, that the holy Ghost speaks so: but also
we see how it is said, the Lord smites us, and heals us again the third
day after: so that if he have given us any stripe with his rod, we should
not therefore imagine that he will not be merciful too us when we come unto
him. When such exhortacions are made unto us in the Prophets, it is all one
as if God should say unto us, true it is that I have scourged you for a
while, but I will spredde out my mercy upon you, and that shall be
everlasting: for as if ye felt any anger or any sign of choler (as in a father
that is displeased with his children,) it was not because I have hated you, but
because I have been feign to make you feel the fruit of your sins, and to
do you to understand that I hate them: nevertheless, in the end ye shall
find that I purpose nothing else but to heal the wounds, and to cure the
diseases which I have sent. True it is that at the first blushe, to our
seeming, it is not meet that God should take pleasure, to wound men first, and
then too heal them. Why rather does he not let us alone in peace and
prosperity? But I have already showed that the wounds which God makes are
as good as medicines to us. It is then a double grace which God grants us
here. The one is that when God scourges us, he procures our welfare by
drawing us to repentance and by purging us from our sins, specially from the
sins that we know not of. For God is not contented too remedy the
inconveniences that are already present: but he considers also that there is
much seed of sickness hidden within us. Therefore he lays hold on us
aforehande, he redresseth things amiss, and singular is the benefyte that he
does unto us when he seems to come against us with naked sword, and
pretends to be angry with us, and yet notwithstanding shows himself a
Physician how so ever the world go. Mark this for a special point. Then
follows the second grace which also is well showed unto us: that is to
wit, that God binds up the wounds which he has made, and heals them.
And this is it which I have alleged already out of Saint Paul, how he
suffers us not to be tempted above our power, but gives a good issue to all
our miseries. So then although corrections be profitable, yea and necessary
for us, and that God is feign to provoke us by diverse means to return unto
him: yet notwithstanding he spares us, and looks not altogether what our
sins, require, but what we are able to bear. And here ye see why he
says that he will chastize us with a man's hand, that is too say he will
not proceed according too his own mighty power. For what would become of
us, if God should stretch out his arm against us? Alas, what creature were
able to stand before him? Verily he needs no more but to show one angry
look, and behold all the world should perish. And though he do not so: yet
let him but withdraw his spirit, and all must needs decay, as it is said
in the hundred

But let us fall down before the face of our good God with aknowlegeme^t of
our faults, beseching him to make us so to mislike of the^, as we may desire
nothing so much as to return to him to crave pardon, framing our selves wholly
to his good will, according as he has showed the same to us in his holy law,
to walk al our life long in his fear, And so let us say, Almighty God, etc.

The.xxij. Sermon, which is the sixth upon the fifth Chapter.
19 He will deliver thee from six afflictions, and in the seventh the evil
shall not touch thee.

20 In the time of death he shall preserve thee from death, and from the svvord
in the time of war.

21 Thou shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and thou shall not be
afraid when destruction comes.

22 Thou shall laugh in destruction and dearth, and shall not be afraid of the
beasts of the field.

23 Thou shall have league with the stones, and the vvilde beasts shall be
brought to have peace with thee.

24 Thou shall perceive that thy Tent is in surety, and in visiting thy house
thou shalt not be grieved.

25 Thou shall see thy lineage increace, and thine offspring as the grass of the
ground.

26 Thou shall come to thy grave, being full as a recke of corn gathered in
due season.

27 Behold, we have inquired of these things, it is so: therefore harken, and
mark it for thy self.


YEsterday I entreated of the comfort That God will deliver his chozen from
six troubles, or dangers, and that in the seventh the evil shall not come at
them. Hereby it is signified unto us, that God will perchance suffer us to
endure many miseries, and when we be escaped out of one, we shall enter intoo
another, and that it may be as a continual exercise for us all the time of
our Seven imports a great, and as it were an infinite quantity. And here
ye see why it is said in the Proverbs, That the rightuous man falls seven
times a day and rises again. True it is that some men understand this to be
meant of sinning: but Solomon speaks only of the mischaunces that we fall
into. For we be beaten with many rods, one while there comes some disease,
and an other time some other adversity: now some man shall trouble us, and an
one another shall do us some wrong. Ye see then the falls which Gods
children fall into, so that in stead of holding them up with strong hand, it
seems that he lets them tumble down like little babes which have no
strength. But what? When we be so fallen, God does always relieve us: and
specially (as he says in another text,) he will have his hand under us, and
will not suffer us to fall over hard. Then let us learn by this streyne, that
we are warned first of all not to marvel though it behoue us to come in many
tribulations. And why? for God has set us in the world to the same purpose
and end: and therefore it is not for us too promise our selves this or that.
And what shall we gain by bearing ourselves in hand that we shall have that
thing which is not in our power to have? Also God will always suffer us to be
disappointed of our expectation, when we be so foolish as to make our
reckening without him, and submit not our selves to his government. Therefore
no man must warrant himself a continual rest, seeing that God will have us
too fight, and that it is his pleasure to exercise us so. Furthermore, since we
see that we cease not to provoke Gods wrath, and that there is such store
of faults in us: it is meet that we should thereupon desire to live at our
ease, and in pleasures, never to part from them? were not that enough to make
us rotte in our own dung, if God should not skoure us from them by
afflictions? Let us learn then to prepare our selves to battle, assuring our
selves that while we live in this world, we are not here as in a Paradise,
but we be here to have many myseries and troubles, because Gods will is so.
And so we know that adversities are profitable for us, yea and necessary
That we shall be delivered in the time of dearth. Some are of opinion, that
Eliphas declares here the seven afflictions whereof he has spoken. But this
so curious exposition, has no substantialnesse for a man to rest fullye upon.
Therefore let us follow the natural sense such as it is: that is too wit,
that according as the myseries to appeace them. Other some can well away with
sickness, or with this thing or that: but if a man do them any wrong or
injury, or if a man go about too deface them, in that case they have lost all
their patience. Then may there now and then be an appearance of virtue in a
man, as in respect of some one kind of temptation: but in some other he shall
fail. For this cause it behooves us too mark well what is contained in this
streyne: namely that God will not commend a man for showing himself stout in
some one point, if he be cold and A cup or drinking glass. For like as when
a Physician gives his pacient such quantity as he thinks good, the pacient
must be feign to receive the drink in such portion as the Physician shall have
appointed: or like as a father in cherishing his children, cutteth every of
them their pittance, and gives them to eat and drink after That we shall
be in league with the stones and with the wild beasts. Whereby Eliphas
meeneth, that the things which are woonte too anoy and too trouble men,
(such as the stones of the field and the wild beasts are) shall not
disquiet us. And how shall not the stones of the field trouble us? Another in
walking, nor in tilling the ground. For we know that the tilling of a ground
is the more painful, if it be stony, and that it is the more laboursome for
a poor man where his plough shall be oftentimes in danger of breaking, if
he turn not away the stones. Lo wherefore our Lord tells us that the stones
shall not hurt our walking nor our laboring in the fields: our walking (I
say) to have any unhappy stumblingplot. Also he adds the beasts of the
earth: for we see that the beasts are against us. True it is that the beasts
ought of their nature too obey us, because God has given man dominion over all
his creatures, and specially because he has created the beasts too the end
they should be subject unto men, and acknowledge man as the Prince that
reigns here beneath according as God has ordained. But yet not
withstanding, now are the beasts feign to rise up against us And that is,
because we have not done homage too God in respect of the sovereign Lordship
which he has over all creatures, and whereof he has made us partakers. And
like as if a man holding a fee of a Prince, and being his leege man had
committed some offense, as of treason or rebellion, the goods which he has
shall be excheated: Even so deals our Lord. For, for our unthankfulness
sake he has been feign to bereeue us of the goods that he had put into our
hands, in so much that he has armed the wild beasts which ought to yield
us full obedience, and he rayseth them up daily against us. Behold whereof
comes the contrariety, and as it were the enmity that is between men and
beasts. But here it is said that we shall be in league with the beasts:
that is to say, that God will restrain the rage that is in beasts, so as
they shall have no desire to do us harm. Truly we see that God has not as
yet utterly bereft us of the dominion which he gave us in Adam. For although
that Horses and Bulls also be beasts full of fierceness, so as it seems
that they should ouermayster men: yet notwithstanding they be commonly
tamed, and men bring them too their lure. And for as much as me^ have their
living in this world: it is Gods will that there should still remain some
traces of his goodness, and that they should enjoy his creatures in part.
But yet for all that, they have not this said league in such perfection as
God promises here, neither were it convenient for them to have it. It
behooves us too be troubled and vexed by the beasts, too the intent we may
feel the fruit of our rebellion against God. Yet notwithstanding it is a
special gift which God gives to those that are his, when they are under his
defense and protection: that is too wit, that the wild beasts are peaceable
toward them, as if there were a league [betweene them,] and that God had
treated a peace, and were come betwixt them too say, True it is that the
beasts have hitherto been enemies too you, but now I will that there shall be
peace and agreement between you. Ye see then what is promised here, yea even
as it were a singular benefit too such as shroud themselves under the shadow
of Gods wings. But the mean how too obtain such privilege, is showed us
yet better in Osee, when he says in his second Chapter, that God will cause
a league too be between us and the wild beasts, namely by our Lord Jesus
Christ. For in that place is expressly handled the restitution of the Church
which was decayed and desolate. It is said that God will send peace throughout:
and there with it is added in particular, that he will that they shall laugh in
the time of calamity and famine. Not that we shall be senseless, no nor
that we ought too be so: but this laughing here imports such a boldness,
as we be not afraid like the wretched unbelievers, who know not what to say
when Laughing whereof mention is made here, it is not meant that Gods children
should become altogether senseless too conceive nothing, or that they should
make a sport of it when God thretneth them with any adversity: for that were
no manliness, it were rather a beastliness. The children of God then must
be afraid, and specially when they perceive that God visits them for their
sins, they must think of it thoroughly, yea and they must have a feeling
of the miseries of their neighbors, too pity them: but yet therewithal they
shall also laugh, that is too say, they shall be able to despise all
adversities, according as we see how Saint Paul speaks when he triumphs
against poverty, against all diseases, against hunger, thirst, sword, things
present, and things too come: yea and specially when the case concerned
fighting against the powers above. And wherefore? For when we know that God
has taken us into his keeping, and that he will be our shield: we may
defy all the harms that can come too us from men. And it is successively
said, that the faithful man shall visit his tente, and shall not meet with
any mishappe to grieve him. He shall see his lineage increased, and the very
breed of his cattle shall be blissed of God. Herein it is showed unto us,
that God, to show the love which he bears us, is not contented only to
remedy our mishappes and too deliver us from them: but also blisseth us in
diverse sorts, and makes us too prosper, too the intent we should feel his
grace upon us. Thus ye see the sum of that which is contained here. But as
we have need to consider Gods goodness thoroughly because he succoreth us in
our afflictions: so on the other side, in all the benefits which he bestows
upon us, it behooves us too be attentive too know the fatherly care which
he has of us. And specially that when soever he shall take us out of this
world, we may know that which the holy Ghost shows us here, according as
I shall set it forth anon: and finally that in all caces and in all respects
God will be the guyder of those that are his, and that although they be feign
too endure things in this mortal life, and are subject to many chaunges and
ouerturnings: yet God will preserve them, and his blissing will be sufficient
too defend them even too the end. Ye see what the holy Ghost meant to show
us here by the mouth of Eliphas. But among the other graces which our Lord
promises unto men, and whereby he will be known too be shall be gathered
into his grave, as a stacke of corn is gathered together in due time, and
laid into the Berne: and also that a man shall come thither in abundance, that
is to say, he shall have lived his fill. Here Eliphas meant to say, that God
will preserve his servants from violent death, and guide them after such
sort in this world, that when soever they must depart, it shall be as if a
man gathered corn in harvest time. And it is better that corn should be
laid intoo a Berne, than that it should perish in the fields: for what were
it too leave corn standing in the field after that it is dead ripe* The
graynes must needs And therefore let every one of us be contented, when God
has given him the grace to live in this world, seeing we have record [in our
consciences] that we be verily his, and that he will draw us to himself. And
although it please him to keep us in this world for a time to exercise us
with many afflictions and miseries: yet let us not cease to taste continually
of his goodness, which he makes us too feel so many ways, and whereof we
shall have full fruition after this present life, when he shall have called us
to the eternal rest which he has prepared

And let us fall down in the presence of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him too give us the grace, that in walking through so
many dangers, we may know how our sins are the cause of it, and that we
have need too be so beaten and chastized at his hand. And therewithal let
us pray him too grant us the grace, that the corrections which he sends us
may not be unprofitable too us, but that we may through them learn too fear
his justice, so as we may be the earnester too call upon him in our
necessities: And also that he will give us the grace to walk together in one
right brotherhoode, and thereby show how we be rightly his children, and
that we seek nothing but too knitte our selves together in all goodness,
whereas we see the unbelievers conspyre to despise God and all right and
reason. That it may please him too grant this grace, not only to us, but also
to al people and Nations of the earth. etc.

The.xxiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the sixth Chapter.
1 Job ansvvered and said unto them.

2 O that my distress were well vveyed, and that my sorrows vere put into
the balance.

3 It would be heavier than the sand of the Sea, wherefore my words are
svvallovved up.

4 For the arrows of the almighty are in me, whereof the poison drinks
up my spirit, the terrors of God are directed against me.

5 Will the vvilde Ass bray when he has grass, or will the Ox low
when he has fodder?

6 Shall that which is unsavory be eaten without Salt? or is there any
taste in the white of an egg?

7 But the thing which my soul has lothed to touch, is as it were the
disease of my flesh.

8 O that the thing which I desire might happen to me, and that the thing
which I love were granted me.

9 That is, that God would crushe me and break me, and that he would cut me
as abovve.


HEre we have to consider, what the state of a poor man is when God scourges
him, and makes him too feel such misery, as it may seem to him, that he
has God against him. We see there that his distress were well weyed, and on
the other side, that his sorrows and greefes (that is to wit, the misery
which he indureth and suffers) were put together with it into the balance.
For then (says he) it should be seen, that this misery of mine is heavier
than the sand of the sea. And for proof hereof, god has shot his arrows at
me, yea eue^ poisoned arrows, in so much that I am as it were fired, my spirit
is as it were swallowed up, or my spirit is as it were steeped in bitterness,
by reason of Gods said arrows which have pierced me. Behold whereat he
begins. But it seems here, that he frames an unjust complaynt, when he
says that his misery is so great, as no sorrow can be able too match it,
or be answerable to it. And this complaynt draws near too that which Cain
made, the which (as we know) was not without blasphemy. For as soon as Cain
heard the condemnation which God pronounced against him: it is certain that
he could not justify himself, (for his sin was manifest, and he was
convinced of it:) but he accused God of cruelty or ouergreat rigor. My
punishment (says he) is ouergreat, I am not able to bear it, thou will chase
me over all the earth, I am not able to stand before thy face: how do thou
handle me? we see here that although this wretched caytife could not deny
but he was punished justly: yet notwithstanding he had his startinghole, that
God punished him not uprightly, but passed measure in rigorousnesse against
him. I said it seems that Job does the like here. For he says it is no
marvel though he be in great distress, because the affliction which he
indureth is exceeding great, and much more heavy. As if he should say, he
could not lament enough, seeing that God handled him so roughly. But we have
seen, how he has come already even to the cursing of his byrthday, and how
he would swallowed up, in so much as in that behalf he is as a man
overwhelmed, which has at all: and so consequently they pass not to seek
atonement with God, for they consider not his justice. So then (as I said) it
is more than necessary for us to be wounded with Gods judgment, that when we
have taken hold of it, we may be constrained to groan under such anguishe,
according as we see it to have been in Job. True it is that every man shall
not have like measure, and God also knows what we be able too bear.
According as a man shall be weak, and as God shall not have endued him with
so great a grace of his holy spirit: That the arrows of God are in him, and
that the venim of them has drunk up his spirit, or that his spirit has
sucked in the venim, for either of both ways may be spoken. But the principal
point that we have too mark here, is that Job does us to understand here,
that he has not to deal with men, nor that the case stands need we have of
such a medicine, since we be such dullards as to follow the lusts of our
flesh. For what are we the better for Gods word? how are we moved for all the
threatenings that are made to us? It seems that we would hold our own against
God, and spite him by our defiances. Behold the pride which is to be seen
commonly in men: and we also should be subject thereunto, were it not that God
clenzeth us of it by showing himself so rough toward us, as we might feel his
arrows in our hearts, and that all our courage might be swallowed up by that
the terrors of God are directed [or leuelled] at him. And why so? For his
words are as it were swallowed up, or consumed. Whereas he says that the
terriblenesse of God was leueled at him, he meeneth (as I have said already)
that he has not men to his enemies, but that it is God himself which warreth
against him. True it is that we may be assaulted at men's hands: and yet
notwithstanding we must not cease to acknowledge that which is said here:
that is to wit, that God armeth his creatures against us, to the end to show
us the terrors [or the terriblenesse.] He knows well enough that when God
scourges him, his int^^t is to have him return unto him, and that God seeks
nothing but to receive his servants too mercy, and too deliver them from the
trouble which they endure. But in these sorrows which he suffers, he is not
able to take hold of the goodness that his words are swallowed up: it is as
much as if he had said, that he speaks not Rhetorically as we see some men
do, who are eloquent in setting out their own adversities. As for those that
are Cokneys, if they endure any little adversity, they need no man of law to
plead their case, it seems (to hear them speak) that there are none but
they on whom men should have compassion. But they that can so well plead and
babble, show well enough that their adversity did not so greatly grieve them:
for had they been touched in good earnest, it is certain that they would
show that which is said here. And here ye see wherefore it is expressly said
in the song of Ezechias, that he had chattered like the Swallows, and that
he had no more had the voice of a man to utter his conceyt, but had been so
shet up that time in sorrow, that he wist not what to say, nor how to couch his
words to utter what his mind was. Let us mark then that when God summoneth
his servant in such wise, he shows himself to be their judge and
pincheth them to the quick, as they are even destitute of words, and
confounded, and know not how too express their meenings. Although (say I)
that God work so, and that he oftentimes deal roughly with us: yet
notwithstanding let us call to mind the convenient remedy, least we be put
to utter confusion. And this is it that Saint Paul meeneth when he says
that God by his holy spirit gives us gronings which are intolerable. When
Saint Paul speaks of the prayers of the faithful, (I meene of the better
sort:) he says that when God makes us too pray earnestly, then we groan:
yea we even groan, but we have not a word at hand: for if a man should
demand of us, what is it that thou say? What is it that thou desire of
God? We wist not what too say too him. We must keep that as a thing locked
up, so as we cannot declare by word of mouth, what we meant too say. Ye see
then how God remedyeth that which is spoken here: which is, that although
all our speech were swallowed up, yet he gives us a mean too find him,
and to get too him, which mean he allows: and although that this kind of
language be not understood of men, yea and that even the party himself which
prays unto God be entangled, so as he cannot utter his words: yet does
God understand such manner of speech. Now forasmuch as we see that God
hears our gronings when we be so abashed that we be utterly dismayde in
our selves: Let us bear patiently the adversities which he sends us, seeing
that he gives such success as all of it redoundeth too our profit and
welfare. Lo what we have too mark upon this strain. Here withal Job uses
certain similitudes, too show how it is not without cause that he
complayneth so. He says, will the wild Ass bray when he has grass? no
more will the Ox when he has fodder. And furthermore, Can a man eat a thing
that has no savor, ^^ the white of an egg without salt? By such similitudes
Job meeneth, that both men and beasts are glad when things fall out too
them after their mind or desire* What is the thing that the wild Ass
seeks? He desires pasture. Therefore when he has grass at will he cares
not to bray or to grieve himself. Why so? For he has the thing that he
desires. An Ox likewise is contented when he has fodder given him. But
contrariwise (says he) how is it possible that a man should be made to like
of the thing that is against him? Verily we will not eat of the meats that
are unsavory. If a man should make us to suppe off the white of an Egg, it
were enough too make us spewe: for it were a thing that would go against our
stomach. Seeing that this word betokens an unsavory thing: what is to be
said that God would kill him at the first blow, and not make him to pine away
after that sort. Ye see in effect what is meant here. And first of all let us
mark, that this sentence is good and true, yea and that the doctrine contained
therein is very profitable: for it is expedient for us too be warned of our
passions. There are which stand much upon the reputation eat that which i^
without savor, and that we cannot suppe off the white of an Egg without
salt: Hereby we may know (as I have said) how that before the blow come,
it is good too forethinke our selves, that cold and heat, unsavory
vittayles and all other such things are as it were adversities which we shun
by nature. Very well, needs must we feel this geere, for we be not
senfelesse. But howsoever the world go, let us make our selves ready too
endure patiently the thing that is unsavory. Let us be contented that God
shall do it for our profit. And therewithal let us assure our selves, that
sith he ordeyneth it, his only will must be a better taste unto us, than
all the things that happen too us by our own good will. What shall be our
salt then to make us find good taste in all the adversities that can befall
us, so as we may bear them patiently? Obedience, so as we acknowledge, and
say, go too, I see here how God afflicts us. And why? First because we be
worthy of it: and secondly because it is his will too advance our welfare by
that mean. Behold (I say) what will make us too find good savor in that
which heretofore was (as ye would say) loathsome. This then is the point that
we must come unto, when we be desirous to find favor in all our adversities,
that we may patiently receive all the corrections which it shall please God to
send us, and that we may frame our selves too his good pleasure, desiring
nothing but that he will accomplish as he has begone, to the intent that
being guided and governed by his holy spirit, we may seek nothing but to
love, serve, and honor him, and too hold all that for good and rightful,
which it shall please him to send us.

And now let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God in
acknowledging our faults, praying him to make us perceive them better than we
have done hitherto: and that when it shall please him too make us

The.xxiiij. Sermon, which is the second upon the sixth Chapter.
8 Who will cause my desire to come to pass, and that God may send me my
longing?

9 Which is, that he should break me in pieces, and that he should
stretch out his hand and cut me off.

10 For then should I yet have comfort: I should rejoice in my grief: let him
not spare me, and I will not deny the words of the holy one.

11 What is my strength, that I should be able to endure? and what is mine
end if I should prolong my life?

12 Is my strength the strength of stones' or is my flesh of steel?

13 I can no more, and my might fails me.

14 He that is afflicted ought to have a good turn of his friend: but men
have forsaken the fear of the almighty God.


We have too go forward with the matter that I began already: which is,
that Job tormenteth him self here, not for the misery which he indureth in
his body, but because God hilde him as a poor condemned person, and because
he deals as a judge with him, and is altogether against him. Ye see then
wherefore Job is more grieved than for all hand. For he not only desires it
[in his heart,] but also addresseth himself to God too make suit for it. And
this is yet another mischief, that a man wisshing death, as Job does here,
shall be as ye would say, shet up and shrunk into himself, so as he shall
not dare present himself unto God to pray for it, though it so be that he have
committed a great offense before. For we must not presume to hide our selves,
nor to have any back nookes wherein to make wisshes that are wicked and
rejected of God. But yet when a man shall come so far forth as to make sighe
in our selves, although God were not privy too them? Another sort swerve
aside to a contrary extremity: which is, that they become like blocks before
God, asking this and that, without knowing how, and without having any rule or
choice. And hereby it is too be seen, that this said lesson which I have
erst set before you, is very ill known, not only of those that have not
been instructed in Gods word: but also of all of us. And therefore so much
the better must we mark this text, to the end that every of us may hold
himself in that then he should have comfort, and that he should warm
himself (or rather be merry) in his sorrow or grief. For the Hebrew word
which hevseth in this place, signifies to burn, or to be warmed, and some
translate it to be merry. To keep the proper and natural meening of the
word, let us take, I should be warmed in my sorrow. His meening then is,
that he should have ease if God would stretch out his hand to cut him off at
the first blow: and that it greeueth him to be pyned, and that God uses not
his force to ouerwhelm him at once, that his misery might quickly be at an
end. But yet surely they that are so dispatched upon the sudden, cease not
too be afflicted still. It eases them not so far, as that they feel no more
any great pain. But Job speaks like a man ouerpassionate, that knows no
more where he is: and therefore (to his seeming) there is no better comfort,
than too be utterly razed out as soon as God lays his hand upon him. As
how? When we have any present passion: we imagine that there is none other
misery in the whole world, but that. When a man is pressed with a sorrow
that is great and excessive: he thinks nothing at all of other men's greefes,
those are nothing with him. If he be in a heat: he could find in his heart to
be cooled, yea even in ice. And yet if he be fornummed with cold, the same
passion also will be grievous too him to bear, and as bitter as the heat
that he shall have endured before. Yea verily. If a man have either heat or
cold, or any other thing that troubles him in his body: ye shall see him so
overtaken, as he shall think that all the contrary miseries would be an
ease unto him: and that is because our passions carry us away. Lo how Job
has spoken. Let us mark then, that when we fancy releefes and easments, it
is not that they would be so, though God should send us all our desires:
we should find that we did but fall out of one misery into another, and
that there is none other ease, but to have god favorable unto us. And for
proof hereof, if it please him to give us patience when we lose but a finger:
he can also well give it us when we lose the whole hand, yea and even when
we shall be feign to lose the whole body. Then must we not think that the
misery is in the thing it self: but rather in our own frayltie. For if we be
weak and left up to our selves: no doubt but we shall be utterly confounded.
But if God have strengthened us with his grace: although we have that he
should be warmed in his sorrow: he meeneth that his sorrow should be
assuaged to his comfort: Like as when there is a great fire Let him not spare
me, I will not conceal the words of the holy one: He makes a
drotestation which he was not able to persourme. But he speaks after the
manner of them, which are carried away by their affections. Behold (says he)
though God have so ouerpressed me at the first blow: yet will I not condemn
him, specially I will not grudge against him, but I will rather bliss his
name, and confess him too be righteous: nevertheless sith I am tormented so
long, and can have no ease: I lose my pacientnesse thereby. Lo how men
proceed according as it has been declared. And Job adds, that he can no
more, and that his strength fails him, and that he which is afflicted ought
too have a good turn at his fre^ndes hands. I have showed already, that Job
ought too have returned unto God, and too have hilde him self there. But
what? He buckleth himself against those that have found fault with him: and
it is a temptation whereof we ought too take good heed, according as the
cause why the holy Ghost brings this story too our remembrance, is too
the intent we may understand, that when men come to heave at us, so as they
scoff at us, and drive us to despair, or at leastwise do the best they can
too drive us to it: we must take good heed of our going, that we be not
intrapped by them. Why so? Behold a man comes to me and says, think
thou that God has a care of thee? Thou call upon him: but thou beguylest
thy self in so doing: and surely if God did not as it were abhor thee,
think thou that he would have exercised thee with such extremity? Thou
see thy self here to be a poor damned creature, and perceyuest thou not
how God is against thee? If a man come to me to whet me after this sort, see
what a deadly plague it is. But we must ward it off, specially because we have
our ears beaten with such temptations, as we may see them and say, behold
the devil is come to set me on fire, to the intent I should frette and chafe
against God. But I must beat back all his wiles, and gather my wits about
me too consider that I have not too deal with men, but with God. And
therefore we must put up our complaints unto him, and say, Lord thou
see how this man seeks nothing but too drive me into despair: he is
come hither to make me fall quite and clean away: vouchsafe therefore too
receive me to mercy, and let me understand, that all that ever I must
endure, comes not of man, but of thee alone. For although men be woorkers in
it through unadvisedness, or rather through maliciousness, and by craft and
outrage: yet does not any thing happen without thy will: but thy will is good,
righteous, and for my welfare. Lo how we ought too proceed. But Job has
missed in this point, and his fault must serve for our learning. And
certeynly the holy Ghost has meant very well, in that this holy personage,
(who is as it were a mirror of patience,) is set here before our eyes too
be looked upon, too the intent that the same thing may profit us, and that
we may thereby receive a lesson which we may apply to our own behoof. So
then let us understand that as often and whenever there happens any great
inconvenience unto us, we must not make such excuses as these: yea I cannot
abide this present misaduenture, but if God would handle me after some other
manner, I shall well come too it. Let us not set our trust so: but let us
consider how nothing ought to put us out of patience, to turn us aside from
God, and to make us utter rebels against him. Then let us condemn our selves
in our own vices, in whole and in part: What is my strength that I should
be able too endure? Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh as
steel? Here Job enters intoo his complayntes, too show that he what is my
strength? True it is that his strength is nothing. But when he knows it and
stays upon it, is it not the next way too make him more impacient than he
was before? Job thinks that his strength fails him not, save in the present
misery that he indureth. But contrariwise let men try themselves thoroughly,
and search well what is in them: and they shall find that the least
inconvenience that troubles them and pricketh them, is not without great
grief, I mean as touching the body. But this is nothing in respect of that
which Job indureth through his spiritual temptations whereof I have spoken. He
desires not too be eased of his misery, that he might know his infirmity
and humble himself before God, so as he might confess it to be good reason
that he should be handled after that manner. What then? He intends to show
how God handles him after an extraordinary fashion, and that men are not
wont to be so ouerpressed. His meening then is to enter as it were into the
field of battle with God, and that God should likewise take his swoorde or I
wot not what. Lo how Job runs a head. But we must demand and seek what
our strength is: not in our selves, but in him that stre^gtheneth us. For we
shall never find any thing but vanity in our selves. If we think our selves
to have strength to carry but one fardel, we shall find our selves overwhelmed
under it. For we are faynte of our selves, and there needs no adversity too
come from otherwhere to bear us down. Our strength then is none at all to
Godwarde. True it is that too outward show there may well seem to be some
strength in us: but the same in deed is but a very shadow. So then forasmuch
as we know how our strength is nothing, let us conclude in general, Alas,
what shall become of me if God lay his hand upon me? Ought I not to endure a
far greeuouser torment, and yet notwithstanding not lift up my self against
him? The^ although God afflict us as well in our bodies, as in our minds: yet
must we not grudge against him to condemn him, as if he did us wrong. But
forasmuch as we know that our strength in all cares and respects is
nothing: ye see how we must learn to humble our selves before God, and
beseech him to strength us, assuring our selves that it is he which has the
spirit of strength, and how it belongs to him only to give it us. For else
if we were not sustained by him, and that yet nevertheless it behooves us to
endure a long time: what a thing were it? Let us assure our selves we should
be utterly beaten down at the first blow. God should not need to make the
misery endure long to destroy us: for who is he that could warrant himself to
continue pacient one only day, or but one hour only? Then needs not God to
prolong our miseries to show our feebleness, and to make us to be convicted of
it: but let us assure our selves that we cannot so much as begin any good
thing, and much less perform it. And therefore so much the more must we be
provoked to pray God to mainteyne us, and to lift us up even when we be
overthrown. Lo in what manner we must consider our own weakness, we must
consider it as Job did, too say that God keeps out measure toward us: but
rather let us mark that when we have displeased our God, and that he
chastizeth us: in steed of amending under his rods, we become worse and worse.
Why so? Because that when God touches us, we fall to blaspheming of his name,
and behold, that is the uttermost and full heyght of all evil. So then let us
learn, that if God will remedy our vices, he must abate this deuilishe
pride of ours, to make us too know it. Otherwise we shall never profit by all
the chastizementes that he

And so let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgeme^t of our faults, praying him to make us better to perceive the^
than we have done, in such wise as we being convinced of our wants, may have
our whole recourse to his mercy, beseeching him to be our father in our Lord
Jesus Christ: and that although we be not worthy to be reckened among his
creatures, yet he will accept us for his children, so as we may learn to taste
of his love and goodness: and therwithall that he will strengthen us in such
wise in all the afflictions which he shall make us to feel, as we may be able
to withstand the^ all, even till he have drawn us away to himself, to make us
enjoy the victory that is purchased by our Lord Jesus Christ, and the triumph
that tarieth for us in heaven. That it may please him to grant this grace, not
only to us, but also to all people and nations, etc.

The.xxv. Sermon, which is the third upon the sixth Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth the rest of the exposition on of the xiij. and xiiij.
verses, and then as follows.

15 My brothers have beguyled me as a dryebrooke, and as the waters that
pass through the valleys.

26 They be troubled with ice, and are full of snow.

17 And afterward fail through drought, and are taken out of their places by
heat.

18 They turn aside by diverse vvayes, and vanish and perish.

19 They that have seen [them] waiting in the quarters of Thema, come in Seba.

20 But being there, they were confounded: and having hoped, when they were
come too the place, they were ashamed.

21 Behold how you be to me as driebrookes: for ye have been amazed at the
sight of me.

22 Have I said to you, bring hither give me of your goods?

23 Deliver me from the enemy, rescue me from the hand of Tyrans.


THe first sentence that we have heard, this behalf: let us go the rather
too the remedy: which is, that if we be combered with great adversities,
we should have our recourse unto God, praying him too voutsafe too succoure
us. In so doing we shall find, that he will ease us so much as shall be
needful, and also that he will not suffer us too quayle. Although it shall
seem that our calamities are as gulfes too swallowe us up: yet will God
uphold us with his hand, and preserve us in such wise, as we shall not come
too the point too be utterly overthrown. That a freende ought too do him
good which is afflicted: But Job complayneth that men have not the fear of
God. This that a man for saketh the fear of God when he has not compassion
of the afflicted. And truly if a man remember well the rule which is given by
our Lord Jesus Christ: he shall well see how there is no fear of God in us,
when we be so shrunk away. And why so? For ye see how our Lord Jesus
Christ tells us, that we ought to follow our heavenly father if we will
be taken for his children. The very heathen themselves could well skill to
say, that there is nothing wherein a man does more resemble God too fashion
himself like unto him, than in doing good, inasmuche as it is a kindly thing
for a man to succor those that are in necessity. And now ye see how God
causes his daysunne to shine both upon good and bad. If I see my brother, if I
see him that is as it were a mirror of mine own flesh and mine own nature
pinched with adversity, and have no care of him, is it not a token and proof
that I think not of God, and that I am ouerbeastly? And so it is not without
cause said in this streyne. That such as have no pity upon the poor
wretched creatures which are in adversity, have given over the fear of God.
Ye see also why our Lord Jesus Christ says, that the chief points of the
law are judgment, righteousness, mercy, and truth. When we will show
that we fear God and desire to serve him: we must come to this present
point, that we walk in soundness among men, so as we be not given too guy
lefulnesse and malice: and furthermore that we render every man his right,
that we maynteyne good and ryghtfull caces as near as we can, and that we
pity such as have need of our help, in succoring them to the uttermost of
our power. Ye see (I say) wherein we shall fulfill Gods law. But if we be
full of cruelty, so as every of us think only upon himself, and make no
account how other men fare: herein we show our selves to have no regard of
God. And why? For if we had God before our eyes, we would consider that he
has set us here to live together and to communicate one with another: we
would consider that he is the father of us all: we would consider how he
has made us all of one kind, to the end we should one of us have care of
another, and none of us draw away by himself alone, considering that we
have need one of another. Therefore it is too be said, that such as are
turned away from this kindhartednesse, have also turned their back upon God,
yea, and that they know not what thing manhood is. Then let us bear well in
mind this sentence: That to prove our selves to have the fear of God, it
behooves us to labor to do good to the afflicted. True it is that for the
observing of this general rule, we be bound to do good to all men. Howbeit
forasmuchas we have great hardness of heart, we must be softened by the
sight of every one that is in distress. And in the same is a good mean to
break and abate all the enmities and evil will that have been before? As how?
If a man be in prosperity and aflote, and be hated, and afterward fall and
have some great storm light upon his head, the said hatred which had been
before, ceasseth: insomuche that they which had borne rancour against him and
would feign have eaten his heart and his guts (as they say) are somewhat
appeased when they see what a change is happened unto him. And seeing that
affliction is enough to kill hatred to make enmity too cease: I pray you what
shall it do when we see our neighbors in adversity? Ought we not to be
double moved to succoure them? As for those that torment and sting poor folk
that are in misery and heaviness, they are not only unkind because they have
no compassion: but also they exceed further, for so much as they come to
increase the mischief. If I see a man that mourns and desires succor
Thema, or to the way of Seba, in hope to find water there, he shall be
deceived. Now these countries were wild in respect of the land of Iewrye, and
there were deserts betwixt them: it had a dry way and in manner vntrauellable,
and therefore it was a place that had the more need of water to refresh men.
Behold the travelers (says he) when they shall have seen such a brook,
they be glad, and surmise with themselves, we have a river that will give us
some refreshing if we be athirst, we may drink water: for we shall have it
continuallye great noise when the waters come down together* and when the
snowes are melted into it, it should seem that a whole doozen of great
springs fell intoo it and gushed through it with great violence. But what? Ye
shall see a man that bears a great countenance: but let him be thoroughly
vewed, that is to say, let it be marked what he does at length, and he shall
be found to fail and not to hold on. So that if he have any show of
virtue, he shall have so great vices matched with them, as it is pity to see
it, in so much that a man shall see he seeks nothing those that have waited
upon them. For they have a stream of water as it were a floude: yea [but that
is] to destroy and turn up all things. When we see this geere, let us assure
our selves that such men are enemies to nature, and work spyte unto God. But
herewithall let us also mark, that by this means God wakeneth us and draws
us to him, to the intent we should learn too put all our trust in him.
Furthermore (as I have touched alredie) every of us is put in mind of his
duty, which is, that when we have the said waterspring in us, thereafter as
Thema, and too the great beat, the waters of the Summerbrookes will fail
him, notwithstanding that in wintertyme and in the moister grounds there had
been a great quantity of water, and that it seemed to be marvelous. But this
is it that is commonly to be seen in these jolly fellows that stand so much
upon their reputation, and that make so great noise. That he had not desired
his friends too relieve him with their goods, nor yet too be his borowe too
rescowe him out of the hands of his enemies, and yet notwithstanding in the
mean season they were drawn back from him. When Job says that he had not
requested his friends to give him any thing, not to pay any ransom for him: he
meeneth to apply the similitude which we have expounded, to his own purpose:
as if he should say, when did I desire you to give me of your goods? If I
have done so, then might ye well withdraw your selves from me. And much more
reason were it that the waters should be dried up by you* ye might cut off
the way to the fountain if I should sue to you to help me. I crave nothing
of you: and yet nevertheless a man may see ye are as it were dazeled at the
only sight of my miseries. Therefore in so dooyng ye show your selves well
to be drybrookes. Now let us remember well this accusation here, that we
may profit our selves by it. For although we have some show, and that it
seem we were as ready and as forewarde as might be: yet if we succoure
not our neighbors when they have lack of us: therein we show our selves to
be but drybrookes. And the matter stands not only upon our succouring of
those with our goods, which stand in need: but also upon having compassion on
them, without any abatement of our substance. For since it costeth us nothing,
so much the more shall we be inexcusable, if we be nigardlie and have no
pity upon such as are in distress. Thus ye see wherein Job meant to show
the ouergreate hypocrisy of those, that have had so fair a gloss for a
little while, and yet had no stedinesse nor firmness in them. This therefore
serves too condemn such as are of the same suit in these days according as
we see some so far of from taking any of their goods too succoure them that
have need of it, that although nothing be desired of them, yet it is a grief
and peine to them, to understand of the wants of their neighbors: I say it is
a grief to them, not that they sygh for sorinesse, for a man cannot wrest a
sygh from them, but rather they could find in their hearts that their poor
neighbors were rooted out: not that they would wish them dead for pities
sake, or for sorrow to see them in distress: but rather of a skornfulnesse
which makes them too shun such as they see are in necessity. Is there any
so great an unkindness as this? Ye shall see some man that will be a
friend to the uttermost: yea so long as he is in prosperity. But if God lay
his hand upon him, we voutsafe not to regard him, as a creature made after
the image of Teach me if I have done amiss: it cannot be declared as now,
and therefore we will reserve it till to morrow.

But let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them better, to the end that
being beaten down in our selves, we may have our recourse to his sovereign
goodness, and not rest our selves any more upon any of the vain trustes and
false imaginations wherewith the world beguyleth it self wilfully: And that
whenever he shall suffer us too be afflicted in this world, even by the
mean of men and of other creatures, yet notwithstanding we may acknowledge
it too be his hand that beats us, too the end we may indeuer too return
unto him, and seek the remedy and cure of all our maladies in his only
mercy: and therefore that he will give us the grace that we may never be
withdrawn from this consideration, namely that we may all of us one and other
labor to be brought thereunto, to the end that with one common accord we may
yield our selves wholly to his service, to walk after his will in fear and
obedience before him, until he have taken us out of this mortal body, to
make us parttakers of his endless glory. That it may please him to grant
this grace not only to us, but also too all people and nations of the earth,
etc.

The.xxvj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the sixth Chapter.
24 Teach ye me and I will hold my peace, show ye me wherein I have done
amiss.

25 How steadfast are the rightuouse words, what is it that the fault
finder among you can find fault vvithall?

26 Frame your reasons too overthrow matters, and let the words of the
afflicted go into the vvinde.

27 You vvinde about the fatherless, ye dig a pit for your freende.

28 Turn ye again and consider, and mark my reasons if I lie.

29 Turn ye again and there shall be none iniquity. Turn ye yet again and
my ryghtusnesse shall appear in that behalf.

30 There is no wickedness in my tongue, and does not my mouth feel
bitterness?


IT is a great virtue in a man too yield himself teachable, that is too say,
too submit himself to reason: for without that, men must needs ouershoote
themselves, Holding of his peace, or by holding of his tongue. For a man may
teach us, and we perchance shall say. It is true, yea and we may perchance
always say, Amen Sobeeit. But yet peradventure there may be some that will
hold their tongue, and yet notwithstanding continue still stubborn in their own
fancies whatsoever befall. If ye speak too a man that is fully determined not
too yield: he will be mum, he will not utter a word, ye shall not get him once
to open his lips: and yet notwithstanding this his holding of his peace is
not without stubbornness. But when Job speaks of holding his peace: he
meeneth that when a man is warned, it is not for that he should encounter it,
so as if a man give him one word, he should give three to the contrary: but
that we should simply give ear to that which is said. Thus ye see what the
holy scripture meeneth by holding ones pe^ce or by holding ones tongue. For when
we be commanded too hold our peace unto God, it is to the intent we should
not make any adoo, because that all our passions are as roarings, which make
such a noise as God can have no audience nor be heard of us. And so let us
learn to speak and to hold our peace when we be taught. First let us learn
to hold our tongs. That is to wit, that we hinder not the grace of God when
it is offered us, but that we give ear, and keep our mouth shet so as we
reply not. And furthermore let us also learn to speak: that is too Teach ye
me and show me wherein I have done amiss. By this he meeneth that although
Gods children ought to be meek to receive correction and good doctrine: yet
notwithstanding it is not meant that they should be without wisdom and
discretion. For we see what is happened in the popedom under color of being
simple. Teach which is placed here. And it is a very profitable warning. For
there are many folk which think it enough to receive whatsoever is said to
them. Yea even without any warrant that it is so, or without having any
firmness in the same. But if we will have a true faith: Gods truth must be
sealed in our hearts by the holy Ghost, so as we may be fully resolved of it
according as saint John says, that we know ourselves too be the children
of God. He says not, that we suppose or ween it, nor that we have conceived
a confuzed and entangled opinion: but he speaks of a knowledge. True it is
that this wisdom comes not of our fleshly reason, another can our own
wit and understanding bring us to it: for Gods learning surmounteth all
capacity of man. Yet nevertheless it behooves us to consider, what truth is,
and too be thoroughly resolved of it, and not too receive whatsoever men tell
us at adventure and under the shadow of simplicity without knowing why or how.
But we must diligently inquire of the thing that is told us, and when we
understand a doctrine to be good, we must determine fully with our selves too
hold us to it. For thencefoorth there is no more replying, it is high treason
when we will open our mouth against God. Thus ye see what we have too mark
here. So then, such as are ryghtly taught concerning God, may well be angry
with those that would disguyze Gods truth with their leasings: like as in
these days it is very requisite for us to be armed with the example of Job,
that we may beat back all the wicked slanders, wherewith the enemies of God
and of his word labor to overthrow and turn away our faith. Ye see how the
Papists do us great wrongs: insomuch as it should seem we are not worthy
that the ground should bear us. But in the mean while there is no talk of
showing why. It is enough for the^ that they have filled the ears of the
ignorant sort before hand, [bearing them in hande] that we speak against the
holy Church because we will not be subject to all the traditions which they
have made. Yea: but it is said that Gods word is it that must be received:
and therefore that whosoever speaks, must not advance himself too bring
fancies, but must speak in such wise as men may know that the thing which
he utters is godly and of God. Then must God be exalted among us. Also when
the Papists prye out and cast up their skum: it behooves us to be always
ready too be taught. Yea howbeit so as it be the doctrine, not of men but of
the living God, and of him whom he has appointed to be our only master,
that is too wit our Lord Jesus Christ, who names himself a shepherd, to
the intent that we should be his flock, that his only voice should be herd
among us, and that we should shake off the voice of strangers. And moreover it
is not against the Papists only, that we must be armed with this warning:
But we are at this day in so miserable a time, as the children of God have
great need of invincible constancy to resist so many and so sundry
adversaries. In these days it booteth not to find fault with the evil and to
condemn it: for every man supporteth it too manifestly. In these days we
become to such a bottomless gulf, that if there That the words of rightnesse
are strong, and what fault finder is there that can find any fault in them?
Hereby Job meeneth to show, that when a man has a good conscience, he shall
continue steadfast and never be shaken for any thing that can be said to him.
True it is that the side, and punched on the other: then he starteth aside and
boweth with al wyndes. And whereof comes such inconstancy? It is because
they have not the rightnesse that is spoken of here well rooted in their
hearts. Behold (I say) what is the cause why we see so many wavering men, who
are not sure of the truth of the Gospel, insomuch that they be but as
wethercockes that turn with every wynd, or as reeds that bow every way. And
why is that? Even because they never knew the power of Gods word and his
truth. For it is certain that the truth is which is the faultfinder among
you that can find fault with any thing? it is too show that the enemies of God
may well practyze, and well use crafty conueyances and naughtiness: but they
shall never obtain too suppress the truth. Not that they shall not streyne
themselves to do it, or that they shall not devise any thing that may serve to
strengthen them withal: but yet (notwithstanding all this,) God will maynteyne
the case of his servants, and at have framed talk to confound his holy
purpose (that is to say, to confound his right sayings) and have let the words
of the afflicted pass into the wind. Here Job accuses those of extreme
spitefulnes, which proceed so egerly against him. And it behooves us to mark
well this point. For no doubt but the holy Ghost shows us here, what we have
to beware of, if we be loath to displease God and would not make as it were open
war against him. Behold (I say) a vice that is hateful before God: which is,
when we will be cunning to overthrow a good matter: specially when it happens
that we advance our selves against them that are afflicted to the worldward:
and when there is such presumptuousnesse in us, as we will provoke them to
cast themselves into despair: and yet there is no vice so over rife as this.
And why so? Because no man thinks of that which is told here: namely, that
when men forge such inventions, (that is to say,) when they devise things to
overthrow all equity (as much as they can) and to make such krinks as the
truth might not be known any more, nor take place any more: it is all one as
if they came too iustle against That the words of an afflicted person, (or of a
despised person) pass away into the wind. For ye see how the cause why men
auaunce them selves against God, is for that they set too much by themselves,
and think there is no wisdom but in their own brain. Truly in all the
affairs that men have, every man seeks his own auayles And therefore when a
naughtipacke would eschew the punishment that he has deserved: he will by and
by have his fair flatteries and gloses at hand, to the intent it should not be
known how the case stands, whither it be a money matter or any other
thing. Behold how men corrupt the truth and turn it into a lie, for their own
advantage sake. But if the case concern the doctrine of faith, and the
Gospel: what else is the cause of so many countersayings, and that we see so
many Sophisters come now adays to mock God flatly with their sophistical
suttleties, but the pride that is in those which think themselves to have
wit enough to win their spurs, and to reason Pro and con, as they term
it [that is, to reason of and on, or too and fro on both sides?] No doubt but
Gods spirit meant too taunt here this pride and presumtuousnesse, too the end
that if we purpose to keep our selves from being enemies to God in fighting
against his truth: we should shake off this ouerweening, and not despise our
neighbors to tread them under feet, but rather be contented to be taught even
by a little child if God shall have opened more unto him than unto us:
according as Saint Paul shows, that such as have the spirit of prophecy,
although god have given them the grace to teach others, must notwithstanding
not disdain to give place too any other unto whom God shall have given more
knowledge than to them. Ye see then what we have too mark in this streyne.
And finally Job concludes, that those which pretended to be his friends, do
nothing else but dig a pit, for such a man to stumble into, as ought too be
hilde up: and that they seek nothing but too wind the fatherless. He uses
this manner of similitude, because a fatherless child has no mean to defend
himself, but is left as it were to the spoil. So Job (as one whom God scourges
to the uttermost) shows us that we shall not escape Gods hand and vengeance,
except we labor to succoure such as are miserable: that is to say, such as
are worthy of pity and compassion, as was said yesterday. Lo what we have to
mark in the first place. But in conclusion he exhorts them, too turn
again: and then (says he) there shall be none iniquity: Turn ye again
(says he once again) And my righteousness shall appear in this behalf. Job
in exhorting the^, shows well with what mind we must find fault with the
evil and condemn it: that is to wit, to bring men back again, if it be
possible to atteyne to it. Therefore let us think upon it, to the intent that
such as will take warning may not perish in their sins: but rather that
being sorry for the^ and ashamed that they have offended God, they may
return unto him with a greater affection. True it is that when we find that
such as have offended God are not touched with the feeling of his justice, and
of his vengeance, insomuch that if a man manace them, he shall win nothing at
their hands: it behooves them too be touched too the quick, to make them
abashed, if he purpose to bring the^ to repentance. But howsoever the case
stand, we must always shoot at this mark which is showed us here: that is
to wit, to draw them back according to the manner that Job uses in this
proceeding here. And as touching Turn ye again and there shall be none
iniquity: true it is that a man may expound this streyn as if he said, There
shall be no more iniquity in you. But there is more reason too say, Return
ye and there shall be no more iniquity: Turn ye again and my righteousness
shall be known here, as if Job should say, what has bin the cause that you
have hitherto condemned me as a man whom God had cast away, so as to your
seeming I should be the worst man in the world? what is the cause why I have
cried out in my self, and have not bin herd at your Return ye yet again and
my righteousness will appear. Here he betokens two things, The one is, that
it is not enough for us to come to it ceremoniously, to say, It is true, there
is a fault* according as Turn ye again, but said Turn ye again the second
time. The second point that we have to mark here, is that when God shall
have discovered our iniquity that we have conceived some wicked imagination
that has turned us away from the good: in the end it behooves us to
acknowledge our fault, that we may return unto God. As how? I said that by
applying this to our own instruction, we should have the easier
understanding of it. Some men are to be found, who for a time shall be
estranged from Gods truth and from the right way. And why so? For they have
some scrupulousness, or some evil opinion, according as the devil is never
without this slight, to trump one thing or other in our way, to the end that
Gods word may have no more sauoure in our taste, and specially that we may be
weery of it. And verily when such manner of folk return, there shall be no
more iniquity: that is to say, God is merciful to them, so as he gives them
the grace to be no more glutted and weary of his word as they were before. Ye
see then after what sort iniquity cesseth when men return. Nevertheless,
when they be entered into the good way, it behooves them to go on yet further.
And how? They must return yet once more, that is to wit, they must bethink
them, Alas, I had been a poor forelorne creature had not God had pity on me:
and now that it has pleased him to take me to mercy, I refer my self
wholly unto him, beseeching him to govern me henceforth according to his good
will. Now when such men return double, then God makes them to see that
which they knew not at the first. And in respect hereof, let every of us
beethinke himself, that we may have our recourse unto God, praying him that
after he has once instructed us in his truth, he will confirm us after such
sort in the same, as we may never step out of the right way, and as the devil
may never thrust us aside.

And now let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them in such wise,
as we may walk according to his will, and always be confirmed more and more
in the same grace which he has given us once already when he called us to be
of his household. And forasmuch as we are so greatly inclined to go astray: let
us pray him to bear with our infirmities, until he have quite and clean rid
us of them. And so let us all say, Almighty God and heavenly Father, we
acknowledge our selves, that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven,
etc.

The.xxvij. Sermon, which is the first upon the seventh Chapter.
1 IS there not a time appointed too man which is upon the earth, and are
not his days as the days of an hireling?

2 As a bondsman longs for the shadovve, and as an hireling longs for the
end of his labor:

3 So have I the vain months, and paynefull nights are appointed unto me.

4 In laying me down I say, when shall I rise? and being in my bed, I am
cloyed with bitterness even until the evening.

5 My flesh is clothed with worms and with dust of the earth: my skin is
alto broken and corrupted.

6 My days glide away like a vveauers shettle, and vvast away without hope.


WE know well that as long as we live in this world we must endure many
miseries, but yet we could find in our hearts that God should handle us after
our own measure. And we be so tender and nice, that so soon as he lays his
hand upon us, we think that a time is appointed to man that is upon the earth.
For it is profitable for us to comfort us in our afflictions. And specially
when it comes to the serving of God, and too walk in fear and awfulnesse:
this ought to come to our remembrance, utterly, but keeps a measure in his
corrections, that anon after they may have some release, and know that God
has had pity of them, and will not punish them to the uttermost, and
therefore that they ought to be tha^kfull toward him for his goodness. We
see then how that in all the whole course of our life we must be feign to
suffer adversities here: howbeit God will not prolong them beyond their
appointed time. But soothly it should seem that this is a common thing though
God spoke not of it: and even the heathen men (I meene even the most the time
thereof is foreappointed, and let us understand that God has foreseen what is
good for us too endure, and that our afflictions befall us not without his
good pleasure. Furthermore also let us understand that he handles us not
only with uprightness and reason: but also with a fartherly loving kindness.
Lo what we have to mark. And this doctrine exte^deth very far, howbeit, it
consists more in experience than in talking upon it. For we may reason of it
long enough [to no purpose] but the chief point is that every of us regard to
profit himself by it at his need: as how? Surely our life would seem very
short unto us, if it were not subject to so many wantes: so long as we have our
own wish and are at rest, every of us can confess that our life is nothing,
and that it is as short as any thing can be. But when we think upon the
infinite miseries wherewith it is full fraughte, and that as soon as we be
passed out of one misery we must enter streightways intoo another and begin
continually new again: this long lingering makes us stark weery. And
therefore let us have recourse to that which is said here: namely that God
has appointed the time, and that it is in him to dispose of us [as he
lists.] Then must we content our selves with the measure that he has given
us, knowing well that he woteth what is meet and expedient for our
feebleness. And yet notwithstanding, it is not for ever that we shall be
feign to languishe here: there will be an end, at what time God shall take us
out of this earthly pilgrimage, yea even to call us to his everlasting rest,
and there shall be none end, there shall be no time set. Furthermore when God
visits us, and every of us in himself indureth some necessity, or some
chastizements: let us acknowledge thus: Well, it is true that if this geere
should last ever, we should needs quail. But God knows the end which he
minds to give us: he has promised that we shall not continue overwhelmed
under the burden: let us tarry till he reach us his hand in our adversities,
and let us assure our selves that he will provide for us in due time. Lo how
we ought too apply this lesson to our own use. But in the mean while we
see that Job has ill profited by it: and therefore must we be so much the
water, that we abuse not a sentence when God puts it into our mind, too
instruct us, by applying of it to the clean contrary. And yet it is an
ordinary matter with us so to do. When we read the holy Scripture, if any
comfort be given us there, or if it serve to assuage our grief, what do we? O
ye see here is a comfort that God gives to his children: but I How now? is
there not a time appointed for man that is upon earth? True it is that here
beneath, men are poor and wretched creatures: but yet may they after some sort
be glad, seeing that God has not set them here to continue slave how he
longs for the shadow: that is to say, for the rest of the night, by cause he
never ceasseth laboring all day long: very well then, such a one desires the
shadow. Again, he that is at wages, longs to have his days work at an
end: and if he have a mooneth or more or less to serve, he has an eye to the
end of his term, that he may have some rest. But as for me (says he) I have
another rest nor release. When I lay me down, I say, how shall I come to the
morning? And when shall I rise again? When I am up in the morning* the day
seems to me to be a whole year long. Then seeing I am in this plight. It is
well seen, that God is not contented to plague me after the ordinary manner of
men: but that he means to thunder down upon me, that I may not know what to
do nor what to say. This is the complaint that Job makes, saying that his
misery is excessive* and no common misery, so as here is no cause why any
man should say to him, Thou see that so long as men are in this world, they
have many miseries to endure, thou have experience of it, and thou know
after what manner God is wont to deal in that behalf: but God (says he) my
skin is alto broken and as it were rotten: I am in that behalf as a poor
forlorn caytife, and yet notwithstanding my life passes and glydeth away
even as a weauers shettle, which runs so swiftly as a man perceyueth it
not, neither can he measure the nimblenesse of it. Even so is it with my life
(says he) when I rise, I am utterly abashed so as I have another ease nor rest
day nor night. But although Job were smitten in his body: yet the temptation
of feeling God to be as his judge and to hold him (as ye would say) upon When
I lay me down, I ask when shall I rise again? And in the morning I say,
when will it be night? Let us note that this is set down to show that a
conscience which is pressed with Gods judgment, is always troubled and in an
agony. Behold after what sort Moses speaks in treating of Gods dreadful
vengeance upon such as shall continue wilfully in disobeying of Gods law. Thy
life (says he) shall hang before thee as upon a threede. In the morning thou
shall say, who shall make me to live till the evening? But Job speaks here of
the temptation that he himself feels, that is to wit that he thought the
nights too long, and the days too weerisome, according as he said. One day is
longer to me than a whole year, yea than That his days are passed more swiftly
than a weauers shettle: here seems to be some contrariety. For he says
that his life is ouerlong: and yet nevertheless he adds, that his days
slip away as swiftly as any thing. If any man say that Job was carried away
with his ouerheadie passions: very well, that is somewhat. But there is no
contrariety if we mark well how that according to the similitude which is
put here, the same is also well placed in the song of king Ezechias in Esaias:
and it serves to show that when a man is pressed with the hand of God, he
woteth no more

And now let us fall down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him too make us feel them better than
we have earste done: yea even in such sort as we may be ashamed of them
presently, and come unto him touched with such a zeal, as feeling him to be
our father and savior, we may yield our selves wholly to his goodness,
and he strengthen us more and more in the trust that we have in him, until
such time as he have delivered us, not only from the miseries of the world,
but also from the slavery of sin, and called us into his heavenly glory,
which we possess not now but in hope. That it may please him to grant this
grace not only to us, but also to all people and nations, etc.

The.xxviij. Sermon, which is the second upon the seventh Chapter.
7 Remember that my life is but vvinde, and that mine eye shall see no more
good.

8 The eye of the seer shall see me no more, thine eyes are upon me, and I
shall be no longer.

9 Like as a cloud passes and vanishes away: So also he that goes down
into the grave shall no more comevp again.

10 He shall no more return to his house, his place shall know him no more.

11 Therefore I will not spare my mouth, that I should not speak of mine
anguishe, and talk of my misery.

12 Am I a Sea, or am I a vvhalefish that thou keep me so in ward?

13 When I say, my bed shall ease me, and my couch shall comfort me: when I
speak in my self,

14 Then thou frayest me with dreams and visions.

15 Behold my soul has chosen the halter and death, rather than my bones.


THE holy Scripture tells us oftentimes that God pitieth us in respect of
our frailty: for we must not think that he is moved with any worthiness that
is in us: there is no such thing. Then if Remember that my life is nothing.
This request is good, when Job says unto God, Lord, I am tormented here, O
that it might please thee to give me comfort. And why? for thou know what I
am, and of what nature I am. When Job protests this, it is a good and holy
request: yea verily so the affection be right. Certain it is that he had a
right intent: but yet therewithal it could not be said but that he
ouershot himself in going too far, as we shall see better by the sequel.
And therefore let us mark, that in alleging our frailty before God, it is
not enough to humble our selves, and too confess that we have nothing wherein
we may auaunce our selves: but we must have the modesty to confess that God
is rightuous, in making us to be in such state, yea though we perceive not
the cause of it: and that although he have hid these secrets from us, yet
must not we plead against him, nor have any harteburning in us, as if we were
ouersore pressed: but must bridle our selves with this, that God has had
just cause to set us in such state, as we might be hedged in with all
manner of miseries and afflictions Why so? To the end to hold us in awe and
subjection unto him, and that we might not have the said presumption and
puffednesse of pride. And hereunto Job adds, That his life is nothing, and
that he shall not return again to see good, that is to say, to take
pleasure of the things that God gives men in this present life. The eye (says
he) of the Seer shall see me no more: that is to say, I shall be no longer
here. And in the end he likeneth man to a cloud. Ye see how a cloud
vanishes away, and a man can not tell where it becomes, and it returns
And even so he that goes down into the grave shall come no more up again. Job
speaks here of the frailty of man's life. And it is to the end that God
should not handle him with such rigor, according as he will say anon in
another streine, what am I that thou should stretch out thine arm against
me? as if he should say, Lord will thou fight against a shadow? But a man
may think it strange, that Job speaking of death, leaves no more hope
another for him self nor for all mankind, as who should say that in dying
Highest point, that is to wit, to the Resurrection which is promised us. And
where shall we find that? Not in our own nature. But we must stie up
above the world, and we must understand that there is none but only Jesus
Christ, which is the true mirror wherein to see that thing. There we see
that God will raise us up again too glory, that he will pluck us out of the
corruption and rottenness wherein we now walk, and wherein we should abide
[for ever,] were it not for this extraordinary remedy whereby he helps the
matter. Ye see then how we must be feign too come too Jesus Christ, to
know whereat it behooves us to look, when we hope to be raised up again at
the last day. Verily Saint Paul uses certain similitudes which he takes
of the common order of nature, too show the Resurrection: as when he says, ye
see how the grains of corn and other seeds are cast into the ground, and
there rotting do grow up again. Now (says he) in that men sow the bare
corn, and afterward the same grows up again out of the rottenness
whereintoo it behooved it to be first turned: ye have a figure and image of the
Resurrection. But yet is not this as much to say, as that we see our
Resurrection there: It serves only too show, that the faythlesse are
unthankful and ouerlewde to Godwarde when they dispute how it is possible that
our bodies should rise again after they be so rotted and turned into duste.
If such as will be so wise in their own conceyte, do shoot out their subtle
devises, and thereupon conclude that it is impossible for God to raise us up
again: Saint Paul shows that such folk are malicious, and that it is
nothing else but their own unthankfulness that turns them away from the
receiving of this power of God, whereby he poomiseth too set us in perfect
state again. And why so? For he gives us certain familiar likelyhodes in the
order of nature, too assure us of his good purpose. So then, when Saint Paul
uses the foresaid manner of reasoning: it is not meante that our Resurrection
shall be as a natural thing: but it is to make us understand the infinite
power of God, and to honor him, and to yield him the praise that belongs
unto him: and therewithal to look upon the promise which he has made us:
which is, that although it far surmount all our understanding, and be a
very strange thing, that God should make us new again when we be turned
intoo duste: yet notwithstanding he will restore us, even when we shall have
been turned too nothing. Although (I say) that this be hard to be believed,
yet must we trust that God is nevertheless able to do it, by his power,
wherethrough he is able to do all things, according as it is said in another
place to the Philippians. Now therefore let men's wits discourse what they
can, let them raunge even to the Diuelles in hell: and yet it is certain that
they shall not be able too diminishe Gods power. Nevertheless when they
encounter the said promise that is made us of the Resurrection, which is the
thing that surmounteth all our capacity, they go about to diminish, yea and
(as much as in them lies (utterly too abolishe Gods wonderful Alas Lord, I
shall see no more good, The eye of the Seer shall see me no more, I shall no
more return out of my grave. Why speaks Job thus? Is he as a man in
despair that casts away all the taste which he had erst felt of Gods
goodness touching the Resurrection? No: but he sets out man alone by him
self from the graces whereof God has made him partaker by his own mere
goodness. And even so ought we to do likewise. Yea and it is a special
shall see no more good. The eye of the Seer shall see me no more: I must be
feign to continue in my grave. But now let us learn to consider of our life
how flightfull and frail it is, and likewise to examine all the infirmities
that are in our mynds, so as we may conclude that we be worse than nothing,
Seeing it is so (says Job) I will not spare my mouth, I must needs speak,
I must needs make my moan, I must needs talk of my sorrow and anguishe.
Herein we see that which I have touched already: that although Jobs
consideration was good, and although the thing that he alleges here be both
holy and agreeable to the doctrine of the holy ghost: yet he ceasseth not to
have some temptation of excess. For he says, Behold I must needs speak,
seeing I have not past a moment to live: for I am ouerpressed with the hand of
God: and therefore I must revenge my self by speaking in my sorrows, for I can
not hold my self. True it is that God gives us leave to speak in making our
moan. Howbeit, not in such wise as there should be any choler in it, or that it
should be to increase our sorrows, whereas we think to ease the^ by that
means. What then? It is permitted, to the intent we should return unto him,
to unburden our selves by it. Sometimes they that speak not at all cease not
to displease God more grievously through their impaciencie, than they that
blaspheme with full mouth. Doubtless it is a very heinous crime when men
dare open their mouths to blaspheme God. But yet there are many also that will
not utter one word, and yet are they full of rancour against God, yea they be
much fuller of pride and bitterness than those that speak. Ye shall see some
man that will chafe upon the bridle like a Mule, and yet not speak one word.
But if ye examine his heart, ye shall find him ready to burst for spite, and
that there is as it were a fiery rage in him: and if it were possible that he
might fight with God, he would do it. Another vnlodeth him self at the first
dashe, and many wicked words slip from him: but yet he has not so much
bitterness in his heart. But howsoever the world go, both of them be naught.
What is to be done then? If our sorrows oppress us to sore, let us settle
ourselves to pray to God, that it may please him to aid us in the midst of
them, so as we may not conceive any moodinesse against him, at leastwise
which should hinder the honoring of him. And herewithal we must also labor and
fight: for whereas men are wont to harden the^ selves when they have once
conceived any wilfulness and stomaking, and to nourish themselves therein: it
behooves us to know that we must withstand it. Then let us restrain our
affections, and let them be tied up like that he will speak in his
bitterness, and that he will talk of it: that is to wit, that this is not
the measure which he ought to keep* and that he takes too much liberty.
Now if this happened to the man that was as a mirror of patience: what Am I a
Sea, or am I a Whale, that thou should set (as it were) such bars against
me, and that I should be feign to have so great lets to stop me? Job protests
here before God, that there was no need why he should be stopped with so great
violence. And why so? I am not like a Sea (says he) which has need of
Rampyres and Ietties. If a Sea have broken over his banks, a thousand or two
thousand men must be sent against it: there must be bringing of timber, of
earth, and of stones to make up so great a breach. Also a If i say, my bed
shall comfort me, behold my couch burns me as I talk to my self. Thou
frayest me with visions of the night, and thou afrightest me with dreams. True
it is that this present saying is expounded diversely, where it is said, that
when Job purposed to have refreshment in his bed, he found a burning heat in
his Couche. The Hebrew word that is put here, betokens sometimes to burn,
according as we shall see it again in an other sentence: But moreover it
signifies to withdraw, or drawbacke, and by a similitude it signifies to
leave or forsake. Nevertheless the signification is God that troubles him in
visions by night, according as we have seen already heertofore, that he had
not to do with men to feel pain in his body only: but that above all he
was feign to abide temptations, as if God were against him. Hereupon he
concludes, that his soul had chosen the halter: that is to say, that he
wished the miserablest death that could be, and that he had lever be hanged
than to be in such case. And how so? Those are the words of a man in
despair. But let us mark that Job in speaking so, says not that he had hilde
himself there not that he had that purpose settled in him self: but he
protests only that in making comparison of his life, with the worst death
that could happen unto him, he was so dismayde with it for a time, as he looked
no further asore him, than to the feeling of the sorrows that pinched him.
Hereupon then let us consider, that if God have not spared his servant Job, it
may fall out that we shall be tormented as he was. True it is that God knowing
what we be able to bear, will not suffer the temptations to be so great,
as they have been in man, who had received more strength of the holy Ghost than
we: but yet must every of us be visited by the hand of God in such sort,
that sometime our life shall be more miserable than the death of him that is
hanged. I say we must be feign to come thereunto, and therefore it stands

But let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to humble us in such wise, that
being ashamed in our selves, we may be sorry and give him the glory that is due
unto him: and yet notwithstanding, that in the mean while we may not cease
to return toward him seeing he allureth us so familiarly, being sure that
he will receive us at all times: and that we may know which is the way
whereby he will lead us thither, that is to say, our Lord Jesus Christ, so
that after we have once known how there is nothing in us but a bottomless
gulf of all confusion, we may nevertheless continue in steadfast trust that we
shall be acceptable to this our good God, seeing we be clothed with the
righteousness of his only son, and that our sins be blotted out by the
merit of his death and passion, and by the pureness of the obedience which he
has yielded unto him. That it may please him to grant this grace, etc.

The.xxix. Sermon, which is the third upon the seventh Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth the rest of the exposition of the xv. verse, and then
as follows.

16 I am vvery, I shall not live alvvayes: take thy self away from me, for
my days are nothing.

17 What is man that thou so magnifiest him, and that thou have care of him?

18 Thou visitest him in the morning, thou have an eye upon him every minute.

19 How long will it be ere thou let me alone? Thou will give me time
too svvallovve my spittle.

20 I have sinned: what shall I do to thee, O thou keeper of men? why have
thou set me over against thee, to be a burden to my self?

21 Why do thou not take away my sin, and why do thou not pardon
mine iniquities? for I shall be laid in the dust, and if thou seek me in the
morning, I shall be no more.


HEre Job goes forward still with the matter I touched yesterday, that is to
say, with his lothing of That he is weery, that he shall not live ever, and
that his days are but vanity, and therefore he would have God too go away
from him, as if he should say, Alas Lord, wherefore persecutest thou me?
Thou see here a poor soul that can endure no more, except thou have
consideration of him: and as for his life it is nothing, it is but vanity.
Wherefore then do thou not get thee away from me? This is according too
that which we have seen already: that is to wit, that God ought not to
utter his full force against mortal and transitory men, because they be not
rocks, nor yet so boysteous beasts that he should be feign to enforce himself
so much against them. Job therefore confirms still the same matter, as a man
that is in anguishe and cannot make an end of his gronings. And having said
so, he adds: What is man that thou so magnifyest him? What is he that thou
visitest him a Morninges, that thou set thy heart upon him, and have so
great care of him? Some expound this sentence, What is man that thou make
so much of him, as though Job meant here as it were too rail at God, that
he lifts us up as if we were little kings, and that he seems to have a
fatherly care of us and to prefer us above all creatures: and afterward
throws us down as men in the picture of the wheel of fortune. Thus ye see
how some take this streyne. Othersome think that Job meant to make comparison
between himself and all mankind: as if he had said, Alas Lord, Thou art so
good unto men, that thy mercy fills the whole earth: there is not the man
that feels not how thou art his be offended with me, he will hold scorn to
match himself with his underling, but will bend himself against his equal.
And wherefore? For the matter stands upon revenging. But if God chastize us
for the faults that we have committed, it is not too avenge himself of us,
he passes for no such thing. What then? For two reasons. The one is that we
must be feign to take him for our judge spite of our teeth, when we have
despyzed him [neuer so much.] And the other is, that he would not have us to
perish, and therefore he corrects us to the How long will it be ere thou
let me alone, and withdraw ^^y self from me till I have swallowed in my
spittle? Here Job declares his passions wherewith he had been tempted. By
the way we have to bear in mind what has been said heretofore: that is to
wit, that Job felt always some comfort, and that God forsook him not for a
full do. Job then shows here after what sort he was affectioned as in
respect of the flesh, to the intent his friends might know, that he made not
so great complaint without cause. And the better to express the anguish
wherein he was, he turns himself to God, because he sees he shall gain
nothing at men's hands. But yet for all that, he ceasseth not to regard men,
yea even too much. For had he been well gathered into himself, and had he
made his prayer unto God: it is certain that he had behaved himself more
quietly, and he had showed a greater token of faith and patience. What is the
cause that Job martyreth himself in such sort, as it may seem at the first
blush, that he is a desperate person? It is for that he has an eye to the
reproaches that are offered him, and he is not able to bear them, to pass them
over, and to have an eye unto God. And this is it that I said heretofore,
namely that if men come to molest and to sting us, we must not look upon that,
we must not cast our countenance thitherwarde: but forasmuch as we perceive
that Satan labors too bring us by that means to confusion: we must come
straight unto God, we must mourn before him, and we must assure our selves
that he will cause us to feel the auaylablenesse of his chastizements the
better, and that we cannot be thrust out of the way, as when men were the
mark that we ame at. But yet nevertheless, Jobs purpose in this streyne, was
too express the vehemency of his affection the better, by turning his talk
unto God, as if he had said: Well, ye understand nothing at all, I see ye
perceive not the spiritual battle wherevntoo God has put me, and therefore I
must talk to him that is my judge. To be short, it is all one as if Job had
said, This that I speak is no counterfeyte stuff: but it is as if God
himself were here. And he says (as he had touched before) that his life
was nothing but vanity, in so much that God ought to take himself away from
him, until he bad swallowed in his spittle, according as we may say too
take his breath. Hereby Job meeneth that God pursues upon him over roughly:
and it seems that he would plead against God as he has done
heretofore. But I have told you already that he does but express the
passions of the flesh. And truly whenever God gives men the grace too
frame themselves unto him, and too bear their cross and afflictions
patiently: it is not in such wise as they should be altogether without
feeling, it is not that they should be immovable and unprofitable when men
trouble them and torment them. But it is too the intent they should fully
settle themselves to bear all this with patience, and that they should
conclude: It is meet that my God should have the maysterie, and that I should
frame my self too his lure, and therefore yield my self over unto his good
pleasure. But howsoever the world go, none is is able to do it without
incountering. Job then expresses here his own pas^ions in such sort as he
felt them, and in the mean while Gods grace is as it were buried for the time:
not that it was utterly quenched, for (as I have said) God vphilde him. But it
will come too pass that when the first passions assault the faithful, they
shall (as a man would say) be harried away in such manner, as it may seem
that God governs them not any more, and that they play the horses that are
broken looce. Nay but it is as if a man were upon a horse: and very well, ye
see the horse flingeth and kicketh and does all that he can to escape and to
run over all the feelde: but anon the man that is handsome can tell well
enough I have sinned, what shall I do to thee, O thou the keeper of men? Some
men expound this, as though Job disputed against God, saying: I can do none
other but sin, wherefore haste thou made me such a one? If thou be the
preserver of men: why should thou condemn me so, seeing it lies in thee
too save me? But a man may well see that this is not the natural meening: and
such as take it so, never knew the intent of the holy Ghost as toucing this
streyne: and moreover they have ill considered that which is witnessed to us
concerning Job, how he was pacient how soever the world went with him. What
is it then that Job meant? It is as if he should say, well, I confess my fault,
and I cannot escape the judgment of God. Why so? He is the keeper of men. But
this word Keeper, has been misconstrued: for men have taken it for a
preserver of mankind, and for one that sheeldeth them under his protection. It
is certain, that (as the Greek translater also has well marked, which thing
he is not commonly wont too do) Job meant too say, that God wayteth upon us,
that he watches us, and that he knows all, as if a man should watch one
too spy and mark all that ever he does and says. Ye see then in what
sense Job applies this title unto God, That is the Keeper of men. True it is
that God does well preserve us, that he has us in his hand, and that our
life continues by him. But yet is this no let that he should not be called
our Keeper, in respect that he sees and beholds all that we do, so as
we can not hyde our selves from him: according as all the scripture says,
that he sercheth men, examineth their thoughts, ciscouereth all things, and
nothing is hidden from him in all our life. And it appears that Job meant so:
for why and to what purpose says he, What shall I do to thee? if it be not
because he must be Wherefore baste thou set me full over against thee?
Wherefore do thou not take away my wickedness? Wherefore do thou not
pardon my sin? For I am in the duste, and if thou seek me, I shall be no
more. Here Job returns too the matter which he had glaunced at before: that
is too wit, that he desired but too have some truce or release till he had
swalowed his spittle. Now therefore he says, why haste thou set me full
over against thee, that is too say, as a white for a man too shoot at. For
he could well have found in his heart, that God should have let him alone
as he was: as if he should say, who am I? And at whom do thou bend thy
self? For I am a poor woorme of the earth, and thou set me as a white
too shoot at: must thou needs try thy strength upon me? as he will say too
him anon. For Job returns oftentimes to that complaynt, and renueth the same
often. True it is that when God sets us full butte against him, we be not
able too abide such a force: but yet for all that we must not shrink away
from him: For it cannot be but that we must needs fail as soon as God
turns his back upon us. Then, are we desirous too stand out and too
continue in good state? The mean thereof is not that God should turn his
back upon us, but that we should be as a mark in a Butte for him to shoot
at, and that he should beat upon us as much as he lists: yea verily so
he assuage the grief of the wounds that he has made, by causing us to feel
his goodness: so we may know that in the midst of his anger he forgets
not his mercy, according as it is spoken in the song of Habacucke. Thus ye
see why this persuasion of Jobs is set out unto us: It is too the intent we
should learn not to desire God to let us alone as we be, for then should
we be drowned even in

And now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him that whereas we provoke his wrath so many ways, he
will not suffer us too continue stubborn in our vices, and plunged in our own
filthiness, but that he will draw us out and make us clean, yea and that in
the mean while he will so moderate his rods, as we may not be utterly past
hope, but may comfort our selves, in that he has promised to be our God and
to assist us to the end, and thereupon return unto him, knowing that it is his
office to change the world to better, and therefore pray unto him too increase
his graces in us, that we may always fashion our selves more and more like
unto our Lord Jesus Christ: and that in the mean time he will so govern us
by his holy spirit, as we may no more provoke his wrath against us as we
have done hitherto: but rather that by his making of us to feel his sweet and
fatherly hand, we may ever have so much the greater occasion to magnify and
glorify him in all our life. That it may please him to grant this grace not
only to us, but also to all nations of the earth, bringing back all poor
ignorant souls from the miserable bondage of error, etc.

The.xxx. Sermon, which is the first upon the eight Chapter.
1 BAldad the Suite ansvvered and said:

2 Hovvelong vvilt thou hold such talk? the words of thy mouth are as a
vehement vvinde.

3 Will God pervert Justice? will the Almighty deface the right?

4 Thy Sons have sinned, and he has made them come to the place of their
misdeedes.

5 But if thou return to God betimes, and pray to the almighty:

6 If thou be pure and right, he will awake unto thee, and make the tent of
thy righteousness peaceable.


THe better to profit our selves by that which is contained in this present
Chapter: we must bear in mind what that sort against him by casting for the
proud and presumptuous words. What is to be done then? If we have once
settled that thing in our hearts which the holy Scripture teaches us: the same
will hold us in true steadfastness. And afterward when we speak after the
measure of our faith, we shall not only cast forth goodly blastes, but God
shall be exalted and magnified in all our talk. But now let us come to that
which is set down here for the principal. Will God pervert Judgment and
right? will the Almighty overthrow Justice? Here we be Being and what the
glorious Majesty of God is: if in the mean time we understand not that
thing of him which we ought to feel by experience, and which he declares
unto us? as when it is said that he dwells in us, and that we live in him
and have our moving and being in him, that his mercy fills all things, that
we be sustained by his Being is diminished. And here ye see also how S.
Paul reasons in the third to the Romans, where he takes away the
slander that might be enforced against the doctrine that he brought: how me^
are always full of venim to speak evil of Gods pure truth, and to stand
checking and replying against it. Saint Paul therefore says, Is God
unrighteous? How should it be possible, that he to whom it belongs to judge
the whole world, should not perform all right? He shows there by this word
Judge, how all of us ought too be fully persuaded, that God is so chare of
right dealing, that all that he does and all that comes from him is
compassed about with that rule. We see then that the said sentence of S.
Paul's agrees with this of Baldads. For under this term God, Baldad
co^prehendeth Justice and rightdealing, and so does he afterward under the
word Almighty. And it is as much as if he had said, Can we spoil God of
that thing which is so knitte into his being, as they cannot by any means be
put asunder. It were as much as to abace him utterly, and too pull him out of
his sear, and to bring him to nothing, if a man would plead against him as
though he were not rightuous. In stead of setting down the word God alone,
or of joining the title of Almighty too it: Saint Paul alleges the office
of him: that is to wit, that God is the judge of the world. And he is not a
Judge after the manner of those that are brybed and corrupted, as we see
mortal me^ are, who being well aduau^ced to great estate and authority, do
notwithstanding abuse the same full often: But it is not so with God. And why?
For, his being Judge of the world, is not by good hap, or by election at
adventure, or by suit, or by purchase: but it is incide^t to him by nature, he
is no sooner God, but he is immediately judge therwithal. Seeing the^ that the
case stands so, let us not co^ceyue ought of him but all righteousness being
well assured that his will is the sovereign rule thereof. Furthermore (as I have
said) this righteousness cannot be so known unto us as we should be able to
decypher what is in it, that when soever God shall work ought, we shall see
the reason why. And doubtless it is no reason that it should be subject to
us, or that we should desire too have it an underling too our capacity. Then
if we find not that thing to be good which he does, whither shall we go?
what a presumptuousnesse shall it be for mortal creatures, (I say) for poor
worms of the earth, to be desirous to compel God to make the^ to know what
his works are, and to give their verdit of them? But clean contrary,
although God conceal the reason of his doings from us: and that we think
his works strange, so as it seems to our understanding, that we have
cause to plead against him: Yet must we honor his secret and
incomprehensible judgments, and gather our wits too us in all humbleness,
too say, Behold, it is true that as now this seems to us to be able to
prevail against God. And so without any further replying, we must hold it for
a sure conclusion, that God is righteous. For as much then as we see now but in
part, yea even as it were in a glass and darkely: let us wait Being utterly
to naught. But if we have this well printed in our hearts: it will be a good
beginning aforehande to submit our selves in such wise unto God, as although
he scourge us and handle us roughlyer than we would be: yet notwithstanding we
shall be pacient in our adversities. Why so? For he that fretteth at his
adversity, must needs be made to know what it is Thy children have sinned,
and God has sent them too the place of their iniquity. But if thou return
too him betymes, he will wake toward thee, or he will make prosperity come
again. Hereby he meeneth that God has set a fair lookingglasse before Jobs
eyes, to the intent he should not advance himself any more, nor play the
horse that is broken looce, seeing that they which are stubborn against God
do come to confusion, and must be plunged into perdition for ever. Secondly
there is a promise, that God does still wait, and would feign draw him back
to repentance, and therefore, that he ought to make haste while time serves
for it. Thus the^ ye see the two points that are touched here by Baldad. But I
have told you before, how he misapplieth it to the person of Job. Why so? It
is an evil case well handled. Therefore let us take the same for a general
lesson, to the end that every of us may apply it to himself in his degree and
according to his necessity. It is said here, that God punishes such as are
stubborn against him: and hereby his meening is to humble us, that we might
not give the bridle to the infirmity of our flesh, as our manner is to be too
licentious. When we come to taking a stomach against God, we make less
difficulty in it than if we should encounter with our inferior or with our
equal. Behold (I say) the devilish boldness that reigns all the world
through: which is, that the party which will be afraid of a mortal creature,
and wouldbe loath to offend him, will anger God boldly and without remorse of
conscience. And therefore let us remember well this lesson that is showed us
here: that is to wit that when soever and as often as God punishes the
wicked, or executes any horrible vengeance, it is to the intent that we
should stoop with our heads, that both great and small should have their
mouths shet, and that we should no more presume to come plead against God,
but assure our selves that it shall happen unto us as it did unto those whom
we see to perish after that sort, if we follow them. And here ye see why it
is said in the holy Scripture, that God teaches men righteousness by
executing his judgments. Hereby the Prophet Esaias shows that so long as
sins abide unpunished, men do harden themselves and make a sport at it: they
think they be escaped out of the judges hand: to be short, there is neither
fear nor modesty in them. But so soon as God settes himself down in his
judgment seat, and shows examples of his justice, we be out of conceyt,
and we conceive such a fearfulness, as we sink down under it, and that
serves to bring us back again. Lo how the judgments which God executes
upon the wicked ought too serve for our instruction, too be will make the
dwelling place our righteousness peaseable: yea verily if we come unto him
with prayer, and bring a pure and rightmeening heart with us. Behold a very
good and profitable lesson. For thereby men are put in mind to acknowledge the
gracious goodness that God does to them, and the favor that he shows them
in that he suffers them not too be quite cut away at the first blow: but
lets them alone still in this life. True it is that such a languishing as
Job was in, will be far harder and grieuouser than death: and we see also
that when Job looks no further but too his own state, he could find in
his heart to be hanged (for ye see he has so spoken:) but in the mean
season if we cast our eye upon the end that God ameth at, and upon the mark
that he sets before us also: then shall we find that all our sorrows are
assuaged. And why? we shall feel that he has yet still pity upon us. Put
the case that a man feel here as it were his hell, and that in stead of being
comforted, he have the horrible terror of feeling God to be against him and to
be his mortal enemy, and that herevppon he have as it were a fire burning in
his If thou come too him betymes, and seek him with prayer, if thou be right
and pure: be will awake to thee. This is added purposely because men continue
stubborn, and although God provoke them to return into the way of salvation,
yet they pass not for it. Lo why it is purposely said that we must not kick
so against the prick, as we should play the restie iades or become
blockishe. To be short, we must have the forwardness which God commands,
according as it is said that we must come to him betymes: that is to say, we
must make no delay by dryuing off the time, as we see these unthrifts do,
which mock at God. O (say they) there needs but one good sigh. As who should
say they had their life in their sleeue, and that they were warranted a
certain time too live in the world, and more over, as though repentance were
in man's power, and that he could turn again at his own pleasure when he
lists, and that the same were not the special gift of God. But [in deede] it
is so holy and precious a thing, as it behooves us not too let it go so good
cheap. Then let us consider that the world goes always back, and would play
the evil detters, who when they have gotten any long day of payment, sleep
without care till the term be come. Even so (I say) play the worldlings: when
God lengthneth their lives, waiting that they should repent: they will never
think upon it till the hour come that they perish with shame. To the end
then that we may not do so: it is said that we must return unto God
betimes. To be short, here are three things which we must mark well. One is,
that so soon as God visits us, we must return to him out of hand, and not
tarry from day too day till to morrow. Mark this for one special point. The
second is, that we must come too him with prayer, condemning our selves in
our offenses, that we may obtain forgyuenesse and mercy at his hand. The
third is, that our prayers must not be made in hypocrisy, but that we
must bring a pure and right meening heart. Thus ye see the three things that
are propounded too us here. True it is that we cannot dispatche them all three
as now: how be it too the intent we may have an abridgement of the whole
doctrine that I have declared, it behooves us too have these said three points
well imprinted in our minds. To be short, let us learn too humble our selves
under the mighty hand of God, as the Apostle exhorts us. And hereupon let
us consider that he is rightuous, yea even in such sort, as when he shall
execute the roughest of his judgments upon us, we may not cease to confess
that he does all things rightfully and impartially, so as we may have our
mouth she^, and not allege any thing against him. And not only let us
acknowledge this righteousness or justice too be in God: but also [let us so
do it] as we may take profit by it, that is to wit, when he punishes the
rebels, and the despysers of his Majesty, and such as are utterly past
mendment: Let us assure our selves that he calls us home unto him.
Therefore it behooves us not to tarry till he smile upon us. But let us take
this for our learning, and let it teach us righteousness, according too that
which I have alleged out of the Prophet Esaias. And specially when it shall
please God too stretche out his hand upon us, and to smite us, let us not be
weary of his correction, as

And now let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of the innumerable offenses which we cease not too commit
daily against him, praying him to make us feel them better than we have done,
that we may be sorry for them, and that in returning unto him, we may give him
the glory that belongs too him, so as we may be confirmed more and more in
his holy grace, and in the obedience of his law. And so let us say: Almighty
God, etc.

The.xxxj. Sermon, which is the second upon the eight Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth the rest of the exposition of the fifth and sixth
verses, and then as follows.

7 Although thy beginning were small, thy last state shall be greatly
increased.

8 Inquire (I pray thee) of the former age, and dispose thy self too be
taught of thy fathers.

9 For we are but of yesterday, we be ignorant, because our days are but
a shadovve upon earth.

10 Shall not they teach thee plainly, and utter words out of their heart?

11 VVilla Rushe grovve but in moist ground? or can the grass of a marishe
grovve without water?

12 Although it be in his freshness and vncutte down: yet shall it vvyther
before any other herb.

13 Even so is it with all such as forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite
shall perish.


FIrst we have to gather the su^me of that which has bin expounded already:
which is, that when we have done amiss, and God chastises us therefore: he
will always be ready to show us mercy, if we call unto him. And it is
expressly said, that we must make Sue unto him with a right meening and in
pureness. This Suing imports that we must confess our sins: and the word
pureness betokens that it must be don unfeignedly. Now then we see, that by
this promise god allureth us to himself, and is desirous to draw us to him, as
if he should say, will men needs perish wilfully when as I am ready to receive
them to mercy, notwithstanding that they be in the high broad way to
damnation? Come) sounds from heaven: let us not harde^ our hearts, as it is
said in the Psalm: but rather let us do as is said in the Prophet Esaias* Seek
the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near you, and let
the wicked man leave him own ways. For as it is said again in another text,
Behold [now is] the fit time, these are the days of saving, when God exhorts
us to repentance. If we forslow: the occasion will slip away, and it shall abash
us when the gate shall be shet against us. Ye see then how it behooves us to put
this Hasting in ure. And let us mark well that in our coming unto God, we shall
gain nothing by bringing our excuses. For if we have but one word to lay for
our selves, God (as we shall see hereafter) shall have a hundred, yea a thousand
articles against us to condemn us. Then let us come to God with prayer, as it
is said here that we must sue unto him. And this imports a plain and pure
confessing of our sins: that is to say, that with our confession (when we
shall have said I have sinned,) there must also follow repentance. For we shall
see many that will never stick to say that God has done rightly in punishing
them, and that their faults are as grievous and gross as any men's: but yet
they will fall to their old byasse again straight ways. If God hold their
nozes to the grindstone by some sickness or by some other cross: then they
make fair promises. But as soon as Gods hand is withdrawn from them: they
show plainly how there was nothing but dissimulation in them. Therefore
whereas we are here commanded to confess our faults: let us mark well, that
we must have the said pureness and uprightness, which is to condemn the
evil, in reconciling our selves unto God. And here is showed the fruit [that
insueth] when we shall have obtained grace: which is, that God will make the
dwelling place of our righteousness to prosper: as if Baldad should say, that
when God is at one with men and receives them to mercy, he leaves them not
there: but makes them too feel the effectualnesse of his mercy and love. God
pardons not after the manner of such as protest tent of Rightu usnesse, to the
intent to put us continually in remembrance, that when we come unto God, it
must be with the said rightmeening and pureness whereof mention has been made
erewhile. And on the contrary part, when we see that God persecuteth us: let
us know that we have the wood within us too kindle the fire withal, and that
we (I say) have heaped up the matter of it within us by our sins. And why so?
For if righteousness were dwelling in our houses (that is to say, if both That
if our beginnings be small, God will increase the more and more. This is added
for the nonce, that men should not measure Gods grace by that which they
perceive. For here ye Ask the years of old time, and despose thy self too
inquyre of the fathers. Whereby he does us to understand, that the thing
which he has spoken, is known to be true by all experience of long time.
Inquyre (says he) not only of them that live at this day: but of those that
are departed long ago. Search from age to age, and thou shall find, that God
never rejected such as come unto him: and that their expectation was never
superfluous nor vnauaylable, verily if they sought him without dissimulation.
And afterward he adds, We are but of yesterday, we are unskillful, for our
days are but a shadow. But the fathers will answer thee, and speak in the
strength of their heart, that is to say, in such wise as thou shall have a
full resolution, and a steadfast ground and reason which shall not come from the
tip of the tongue, but from a well foreconsidered understanding. When Baldad
speaks here of the fathers: no doubt but he meeneth the former experience of
all times, as we have touched already: and he speaks not only of the old me^
that lived at that time, but also of such as were already dead. A man will
perchance demand how [it should be done?] was it possible for Job to go too
be instructed at their hands? The answer is easy: namely, that it is not
meant of the men, but of the things that had been done in the time of them,
accordingly as their stories do witness unto us. Behold, Baldad meant to say
thus: I bring thee not an uncouth doctrine, for when thou shall have made a
long back search, even from the creation of the world, thou shall find that
God has always wrought after the same manner: that is to wit, that so soon as
men have returned from their iniquities, God has reached them his hand, and
the gate of salvation has been opened unto them: this (says he) shall thou
understand. Also this instruction is very profitable for us: namely that we
must not shette our eyes against that which God shows us, and has showed us
in all times of the world: but rather we must consider the things that have
been done in former times, that we may apply them too our own use. True it
is that as men give themselves too vanity, they cannot gather their wits
unto them, to apply them to such a study, except God compel them thereunto.
And here ye see the cause why David protests, that when he was afflicted,
he called too remembrance the former years of old time, and bethought
himself of them. And therefore we must lay this for a ground: namely, that
That we be but of yesterday, and are ignorant, because our life is but a
shadow. True it is that this present text may be expounded two ways. There
are which think that Baldad meant to say, o I know thou will not esteem that
which I can bring of mine own: thou will say I am not so old, that me^ should
give ear to me as to a wise man. Well, put the case that my saying be naught
worth, because my person is not agreeable thereunto: yet shall thou find, that
the old men will tell thee as much. And I set down this interpretation,
because it may go for good. Howbeeit if all things be nearly looked to, it
will appear that the plain meening of this text is, That Baldads moving of
Job to inquire of the time past, was because that if we look no further than
before us, it shall be to small purpose. True it is that the very same which
God shows us from day to day, is enough for our instruction: so as there
shall need no other process too make us inexcusable, than that which we
shall have perceived in one year or in two, yea or even in one day, God
shows us so many things, as there remaynes no more excuse for us, neither can
we allege, I never wist of this, God never gave me knowledge of this. I say we
see enough before our eyes for our instruction. But such is our slothfulness,
as God had need to chawe our morsels to us aforehand, and yet shall we have
much ado to swallowe them down when they be so chawed, as the proverb says.
Lo here wherefore he gives us knowledge of the time past. As for example. If
we despise all that is come to pass before our birth, and say, o I shall be
wise enough by considering the things that we see of our own life: was it Gods
will that the presidents which he gives us of the time so far past, should be
to no purpose? When the scripture tells us, that ever since the creating of
the world, God has governed men, chastized them for their offenses, pitied
them, and with his goodness continually surmounted the naughtines of those
that had don amiss: and that above all things he had defended those that were
his, and succored the^ in their afflictions: seeing that God from age to age
discovers things so greatly for our behoof: will we have eueriwhit of it
despised, and thrust under foot? do ye not see too villainous an
unthankfulness, when we thrust far from us, the thing that is more tha^
profitable for us? Let us mark then that this is the very thing whereunto he
that speaks (namely Baldad) has pretended to bring Job. And therefore shall it
grieve us to inquire of the things that are for our welfare? Let us consider a
little of our own age. What are we? We are of yesterday. When men have
cast up their account thoroughly: they are but as Snayles, which vanish away out
of hand. True it is that a man may live fifty or threescore years, but yet
must we come back to that which is said in the song of Moses, namely that
before God, a thousand years are but as one day, and therefore that a man's
life is but as a dream that is past already. If we considered well the
shortness of our life, how it glydeth away as a shadow: it is certain that
we would be so much the more diligent to inquire after things past. And why?
For we are ignorant if we look no further than too the said shortness of
life. But Gods will is that the things which have bin done before we were borne
should be as it were present with us by stories, and by that which is left us
in them. Ye see then how gracious God has showed himself toward us, in
that he has gathered all times together, and brought too pass, that a man
which lives but fifty years in this world, may be able to comprehend five
thousand years that were before him, and too dispose them, put them in order,
and know them. Ye see how long time slipped away before the flood. Very well,
how went things then? How has God wrought since the flood? When it liked him
to prepare himself a Church, after what manner did he govern it? How did the
Rushes grow not but in moist places, and also that as the grass in moorishe
grounds cannot cherish it self without water: insomuch that when such herbs
flourish, they wither away of themselves without cutting up: Even so the hope of
the hypocrite shall perish, and likewise the hope of all such as forget God.
This is clean contrary to that which we saw before. This sentence was
alleged already at the beginning of the Chapter. But Baldad had added, that
God will be merciful to such as return too him, notwithstanding that they had
run royot for a time. And now he returns to that those that are blissed of
God: yet nevertheless they dry away after such a sort, as they bring forth no
fruit: how fair show soever they make, there is no substancialnesse in them.
And thus ye see what is meant here by speaking of rushes and moorish weeds. To
be short, let us note, that if we will profit well, we must draw our sap
from God, and we must be near unto him, and he must not cease to water us,
but must be as continual water too quicken us and to give us lustiness,
without which it is impossible that we should endure one minute of an Even
so is it with the hope of hypocrites. Hereby we be done too understand, that
although men put not too their hand, God will consume us by a secret and
unknown working, so as we must be feign to come to naught, except it so be
that we have trusted in him, and have taken deep and lively root in him.
True it is that sometimes God rooteth up the wicked in punishing them by man's
hand, yea and he matcheth them one against that the hope of hypocrites shall
perish. And this brings us again to that which I have touched already: that
is to wit, that such as have nothing else but smoke and untruth in them,
cease not too be fresh and green, yea to their own seeming, and after the
opinion of men. And so ye see here wl at it is that deceyueth us. For we be
naked of all goodness, and yet we be so brutish, as we ween our selves to
be very rich, and therefore God is nobodie with us. Lo why Baldad has
spoken here precisely of the hope of hypocrites: as if he had said, True it
is that hypocrites will make fair shows, and not only they will like well of
themselves for this goodly outward countenance of virtue: but also it seems
that God dandleth them in his lap, and favors them in all points. But yet
shall they wither and dry away, so as it shall be a wonder too see how they
be undermined and utterly overthrown. So then let us not wilfully beguile our
selves: that is to say, although we have some worldly prosperity for a time:
yet let us not sleep upon it, neither let us be tied too the riches and
pleasures of this world, which hinder us in looking unto God: but let us rest
our selves wholly upon him, according as he is the welspring of our welfare and
prosperity. Ye see then what is imported in this word Hope, whereof mention
is made in this place. Finally, we have also to mark, that Baldad describes
the hypocrites, saying that they have forgotten God. Yea doubtless. For
although hypocrites prate never so much of God: yet for all that, they have
quite forgotten him. But the true remembering of God is, to feel that all our
welfare lies in him, that we must not seek for salvation otherwhere than at
him alone, and that without his goodness and mercy we must needs go to
destruction. Ye see then what is meant by forgetting God: namely, when men
have a selfeliking of their own virtues, insomuch as they think themselves
able too advance and mainteyne themselves, and in the mean while come not to
God to seek remedy of their miseries at his hand, whereas we ought to have
recourse unto him, not only for one time, but as often as we shall have need
of help. Then do we not forget God, when we acknowledge that we must receive
al goodness at his hand, because we be utterly void of it as in respect of
our selves. But they that trust in their own virtues, they that imagine too
purchase estimation by their own policy, they that presume upon themselves
in what wise soever it be: these are the men that forget God. And why so? for
they have plucked his office from him, and usurped it to themselves. Also, do
they not forget God, which are given too their wicked affections and fleshly
lusts? We see that such as live at their own ease cannot be tamed by any
manner of means: there is no talking with them of making them to walk in the
fear of God. As for him that has this worlds goods, if a man tell him he
must humble himself: he shall never bring it about. And why? His riches have
made him horns too dosse with against God. A whorehunter that is plunged in
his villainy, if a man go about to draw him back by counsel and correction,
amendeth not, but rather appareth. Then all such as are so carried away by their
own affections, are as wild beasts, and cast themselves wilfully into
destruction, and a man cannot bring them back again too the right way. And
why? They have forgotten God, and consider not, that to walk aright, it
behooves us to have God continually before our eyes. And

Now let us fall flat before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him not to look upon our offenses, to punish them as they
deserve: but that we may learn to be our own judges in condemning our
selves, and that we may come unto him, as too the physician of all our
diseases, and that he will so heal us of them, that being at one with him,
we may walk in all uprightness, that by that means we may be partakers of
that which he has promised too his faithful ones: and that in this world
we enjoying the record that he gives us of his fatherly love, may grow
more and more in the affection which he gives us too love and honor him,
until such time as he have brought us into the glory that he tarieth for us
in heaven, and which we possess already by hope. That it may please him to
grant this grace, not only unto us, but also unto all people and nations, etc.

The.xxxij. Sermon, which is the third upon the eight Chapter.
13 Such are the vvayes of the hypocrite, and of all those that forget God.

14 Their hope is cut off, their expectation is a Spiders vvebbe.

15 He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not hold: he vvoulde hold
him by it, and it shall not stand.

16 If a tree be planted in the Sun, his branches will spread over the
Garden.

17 It shall reach about the fountain, and it shall spread out it self to the
house of stone.

18 It is plucked up from his place, so as a man may say to it, I know thee
not.

19 His joy shall be to be planted again in another place.

20 Even so God will not cast away the sound man, neither will he reach
his hand too the wicked.

21 Until he have filled thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with
gladness.

22 That thine enemies be confounded, and the dwelling place of the wicked
shall not stand.


I Have declared heretofore what is meant by forgetting God, which thing it
stands us in hand too mark well. For under that word is comprysed men's
hypocrisy, that is too say their vanity. Will we then have such a holiness
as shall be acceptable and allowed before God? Let us look that we walk as
before him, even as though he were present with us: and in all our ways let
us assure that the trust of such, is like the Cobweb which the Spiders weaue. I
know that the Spider weaues a web, but there is no strength in it. Even so is
it with them that build upon vain hopes. They bear themselves in hand, that
it should continue and shows us that he will not have us to abide in our
foolish trustes, but will have us to have some certain resting point, that we
may not build as the Spiders do, but have stayednesse in him. For certaynely
here is a comparison between the resting wherewith we ought to rest upon all
Gods promises: and the trust wherewith we pretend to rest upon creatures. Then
do ye see here, how the holy Ghost condemns all the trust that we have in
creatures. And why so? For can we find any steadfastness out of God? It is
certain we shall find none. That God will not take a wicked man by the band
too favor him, nor forsake the good men, but will rather fill their mouth
with laughter. True it is that here he speaks of Job. And in his person he
means to do us to wit, that all such as return unto God, shall find him
gracious and favorable toward them. In fine he says, The tent of the wicked
shall not be able too stand: but God will put all good men's* enemies to
shame. And he will not only show him self favorable too their persons: but
if they be troubled or grieved, he will put himself betwixt them, and show
that he has them under his defense and protection. And here we see a
sentence that is well woorthye too be noted: that is to wit, that we be
like trees that are taken up out of some one place to be planted again in
another. I speak of the children of God. For the wicked may well be taken
up by the roots also: but that shall be too continue without hope to be
planted again, as we hear the threatening that is made by our Lord Jesus
Christ when he says, that every tree which brings not forth fruit shall
be hewn down and made firewoode. Lo here what horrible blows God gives to
the wicked. And why? for he sees them to be utterly reprobate and given up
to damnation: and therefore he must stub them up for ever. Also he says
likewise that every tree which is not planted by the heavenly father, shall be
plucked up by the root. But we shall see many, who for a time will make fair
countenance, and it will seem that they be even of those trees which God
has set in his garden, and in his own possession: for there are hipocrits
mingled with the faithful. They would feign be of that sort that is most
advanced in the Church. But what for that? they be not planted to have any
good and sure root: and therefore in the end God must stub them up. As much is
to be said of the vine, namely that our Lord Jesus Christ is the stock of
the vine, and we the branches that were graffed therein. If we bring forth
good fruit: the father manureth us, and we feel that he has his hand
always upon us, to make his graces auailable, and to multiply them. But if
we bear evil fruit, or if we be altogether fruitless, so as God may make
this complaint which he makes by his Prophet, My vine, what have I done to
thee that thou bear me nothing but bitterness? I have looked for some
sweetness at thy hand, and it seems that thou would choke thy master:
What shall I then do, but pluck thee up? this ought to make our hair stand
up upon our heads, for (as I said) we are as good as quyte stubbed up. And in
deed all the afflictions that light upon the dispysers of God, and upon such
as are past mending, are as many stubbings up. True it is that they wither not
at the first blow: for if God punish a wicked man, he will yet give him
leisure to bethink himself and too come home again: nevertheless, the
enemies of God can not feel any one chastizement in the world, but God
begins already to stub them up, and the same tends too their final
destruction. And plucking up or by stubbing up) what is to be done then? As
often as God chastizeth us after what manner so ever it be, let us not be
astonished though the correction seem grievous to us in respect of our own
nature. And why so? For our desire is to continue still, and that our state
should not be diminished. Thus ye see what we covet. Bnt if God cut off any
branch from us, there must needs be some gainestriuing and some gaynesaying:
yea verily in our natural understanding. But yet nevertheless, let us look
that we take heart, when the affliction greeueth us, and let us enter into the
account that is set down here. Ye see it is true that if a man cut off any
part of a tree, he abateth the beauty of it for one year after: but yet it is
certain that when a good labourer, that will further his own profit, and
play the good husband, shreddeth a tree, he meeneth not to make it to
impair, but that the tree should thrive the better. Then since the case
stands so: let us put ourselves into Gods hand, and pray him too dispose of
us: for he knows how he may make us to bear fruit. Therefore let us
suffer him to cut and shred off some boughs from us, and let us fight against
this native grief, and against the sorrowfulness that we conceive at the
first brunt. Let us fight (I say) against it, yea even in such wise as we be
subdued to say, very well, seeing it pleases God to shred off some part of
us, he knows wherefore he does it. But we must pass yet further. For it
is not enough for us to show our selves pacient in some small or common
adversity. But if God bring us too deaths door, that is to say, if he use
such extremity in chastizing of us, as it may well seem he intends to
destroy us, and that when we shall have debated the matter off and on, we can
not but condemn ourselves and be utterly abashed: yet notwithstanding we
must still continue steadfast, as shall be said hereafter: so that although God
kill us, yet must we trust still in him. For he is the Physician that can
heal, not only our wounds, but also death it self. And therefore it is said in
the Psalm, Although I should walk in the shadow of death, so long as I see
the sheepehooke of my God, (that is to say, so long as he shows himself to
be my shepherde) I shall comfort my self therewith. Then let us learn to
fight against this temptation which provoke us to despair when God (to our
seeming) presses us out of measure, and when we are able to abide no more, yet
let us stand up and say, are we plucked up? And will not God plant us again?
If a husbandman may remove a tree from one place to an other, shall not God
have more power? Then let us trust in him, and let us not doubt but that when
it pleases him to have pity upon us, we shall be restored to better state
than we were in before. Yea verily, but the means thereof shall not be after
man's fancy. Also it becomes us not to measure Gods grace and power after our
reason: let us not do him that wrong: but let us assure ourselves, that for all
the power which he has given to mortal men, there is no whit abated from
himself: but he has much more and without comparison, so as he can not be
let to aid us in our greatest adversities. When our calamities shall be
utterly deadlye, then will he restore us again in such wise, as we shall
have whereof to rejoice in him. But now remains that this be applied to our
own use. As I have touched before, we see what the state of this present life
is. Every man ought to look to himself, there is not that man which can not
skill to complain, and which makes not his moanes, or at least wise which
though he utter it not with his mouth, does not keep it locked up in
sorrow, [so as he says in him self,] Alas, such an inconvenience is
befalne me, I am the worse for that God has diminished me so much. We can
skill well enough to bethink us of all these things, and the Devil also will
not miss too put them in our heads, that we might be grieved and
tormented, yea Lo what we may say. Nevertheless, let us call to mind, that
God means to try our faith by holding us in the hope of the heavenly life,
which is hidden from us as now. For although God bliss his servants, and give
them some prosperity in this world: it is not to be said that their last
state is not better for them, for his planting of us in his Church, is too the
intent we should live in his kingdom everlastingly without end. Now then,
what is our true resurrection and renewment? Even that God should reserve us
and set us in his kingdom: that when That God will never lend his hand to the
wicked, but contrariwise: will put the enemies of good men to shame, and have
pity of th* good men continually. Verily if we should put God to his stint,
to say that (in respect of this present life) he should behave himself in
such sort toward us, as we should always be blissed at his hand, and
continue always in prosperity: this doctrine were false. And also we have
records ynowe in the Scripture, that God will not hold any such rule here, as
that they whose father and savior he is, should live at their ease and rest:
and in very deed, it were not expedient for us. As for example, if in these
days the good men were handled gently at Gods hand, and had all things at
their wish and desire, and that the wicked were punished roughly: where were
the hoping for the latter day? we should fall so sound asleep in that case,
as nothing should* be more needful, than that our Lord Jesus Christ should
appeate to judge the world. And why so? Gods judgments should be altogether
apparaunt, and there should be none other hope of salvation. We see then that
although God suffer things to be confused in this world, so as good folk are
tormented to the vttermoste, and wicked folk advanced in triumph: yet we
be so drouzie and so dulheaded, as we can not be moved to come unto God, and
to consider what he says to us: namely that our life is hidden as yet, and
that we must tarry till it be revealed by the coming of Jesus Christ. We
can not attain to this consideration by no means, no not although God provoke
us and draw us to it as it were by force. What would we do then, if God
disposed man's life in such wise as all were well ordered there, and no man
endured any adversity, but that men might say, Behold how God aydeth the
good, therewithal showing himself an enemy to the bad, and that he can not
bear with them nor suffer them. It is certain that we would make our heaven
here, and we would conclude, that it were a fondness to wait for the
coming of Christ, and that it were not to be looked for. So then we see it
is not for our profit, that God should as now uphold us after an ordinary
and impartial manner, to show himself favorable to the faithful, and to
punish the naughtipacks: but rather that he should seem to dissemble for a
time, when the wicked ouershoote themselves, working him displeasure, and
nothing else but mocking him. Well: it seems that God is a sleep, or rather
that he is not able too repress them: the wicked must ruffle it out, and
have the better hand for the time. And on the contrary, when the good are
troubled and tormented, God must not succoure them: they must syghe after
him, and cry upon him: and all this seems to be in vain: for if they were
heard, the effect would show it. It is good therefore that things should go
so. And why? If there were none other reason than I have alleged already,
were it not enough? And here we must also rehearse other texts of Scripture: as
when it is said that our faith is much more precious than corruptible
metalles: so that if gold and silver must pass through the fire too be
fined from their dross: our faith must also be tried so much the more
thorrowlye, as it is more precious before God. And how shall this be done? by
afflictions. Mark then what we have to note, that we may fare the better for
this text: which is that, God lends his hand to the wicked, favoring them
and showing him self too be their friend: and that on the contrary, he
will not show his love toward the faithful, at the first, but suffers them
to languishe in such wise, as they be trampled under foot, and there is no
likelyhoode that ever they should be set up again. God then may well do all
these things: and yet in the mean while he ceasseth not to fulfill that which
is contained here, that is to wit, that he reaches not his hand unto the
wicked. And why? For all the goods which they have, and all that ever they
delight in, or glory of, must every whit of it turn to their

And now let us fall flat before the presence of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them better
than we have done, and that therewithal we may have our recourse unto him,
knowing how it is he only that can amend us and all our evil affections: and
therefore that it may please him too draw us back in such wise, that
forsaking our selves and all that is in this world we may labor for the
heavenly life, until such time as having overcome all the adversity of this
present life, and being come to the end of all the battles wherewyth we are
assailed, we may fully enjoy all the victories which he gives us now by the
grace of his holy spirit. That it may please him to grant this grace not
only to us, but also to all people and nations of the earth, etc.

The.xxxiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the ninth Chapter.
Job ansvvered and said.

2 Of a truth I know that man shall not be justified to Godvvard.

3 If he would dispute with him, he should not answer him one point of a
thousand.

4 He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength. And who is he that shall set
him self against him and have peace?

5 He remoueth the mountains, and they feel not when he overthrows them
in his wrath.

6 He remoueth the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof do quake.


ALthough men be enforced to confess that God is righteous, and that there is
no fault to be found in him: Yet notwithstanding, of it? when men covet to
maynteine his righteousness by that means they take a wrong way. Ye see then
here is a fault: for when men will take upon them to measure Gods justice, and
to say, he punishes no man but for his sins, yea and look in what manner
and quantity every one has offended, thereafter must God pay him home in
this world: then do they not take Gods justice as they ought to do. In this
respect, Job treats now much better of the manner of Gods justice and how
it ^s to be known, than Baldad has done. That is to wit, I know for a truth
(says he) that man shall not be justified with God. So it is set down: but
this word with imports as much as to Godward. And it is a doctrine of great
weight if a man know it well. What is the cause that men iustifye themselves so
boldly, that is to say, that they presume so much of themselves, that they set
so much store by themselves, and that they be so full of pride? What else is
the cause of it, but only their staying here below, that every man compares
himself with his neighbor? Ye see then whereunto we run. And ye see also
why Saint Paul sends us to the great judge, saying that every man shall
bear his own burden. As if he had said, my friends, men beguile themselves
when they make such comparisons as these: What? I see other men live no
better than my self, and if I have faults in me, so have other men in them
too. Ye see then what is the cause that men condemn not themselves as they
ought to do, but rather sooth themselves in justifying their own case. But
here it is expressly said that man shall not be justified with God. What
That if a man would dispute with God, he should not answer to one point of a
thousand. True it is that this may well be verefyed of God: for we may
plead fair, and tell a long tale, whereas there shall be a thousand points
that God will not once voutsafe to open his lips we never think of that: and
therefore it is no marvel though we be so blind. Howbeit let every man
bethink himself well, and he shall find that that is the reason. If any man
speak to us of pleading against God: nature it self teaches us that we
ought to abhor it: I say even the wickeddest of us. We see of these Scoffers
that have another conscience nor fear of God, and yet notwythstanding there
remains some kind of feeling engraven in them by nature, so as they be
abashed and ashamed when it is said to them, will thou plead against God?
soever we take things to be good, and perceive not any fault in them, yet are
they not therefore without fault, for we know not the perfection that God
requires. To be short, there is none but only God that knows what
perfection and soundness is. And why? It is in him, he knows it, and we be
too feeble to atteyne unto it. That is the cause why it is said that we may
well set a fair face upon the matter, but we shall not be able to answer one
poor point of a thousand that shall be alleged and laid before us. And I
have told you already, that

Ye see then intoo what a maze God casts all the presumptuous sort which
undertake to stand against him, and enterprise the combat that is spoken of
here. True it is, that God is so gracious to some, as that he daunteth them,
and they at length do fall in array: but that must That God is wise of heart and
mighty of strength. This point of doctrine has bin touched already
heretofore. Nevertheless it is not for naught that it is spoken of here new
again. For it is a lesson which we ought to mind day by day. I have told you
already that men beguile themselves and wanze away in their own fond
imaginatio^s, because they think not upon God, but rest upon themselves.
Behold here one inconvenience. But let us on further. If men thought upon
God, should they not be touched lively, to acknowledge him according as he
declares himself unto them? should they not be moved to such a fear and
reverence as they would glorify him as he is worthy: But they do it not at all,
what is the reason? It is because they conceive not God to be such a one as he
is. Well, we can skill to say God, God, that word runs roundly upon our
tungs end, and yet in the mean while, his infinite majesty is not perceived
awhit. All that is in God to our respect, is as a dead thing. And in very deed
it is well seen by men's blasphemies, periuries and such other like things.
If men had any feeling of Gods majesty, should we hear so holy and sacred a
thing so rent and torn in pieces? If men be so in a chafe, God must be feign
to abie for it, as if he were their Jack. Like as when a master is angry, (if
he be a fumish and hasty man) he will give his servant a buffet with his fist,
so will a testy man do to his wife, or else too his horse if he displease him.
Even so play we with God. Now when we see me^ cast up their choler at God as if
he were their underling, may it not be well said that we be totoo dulheaded:
yea and they come to that point without being chafed. For we see these dogs
make no bones at all in tearing the name of God. And although there be no
cause to provoke them thereunto, yet cease they not to swear blasphemously at
every word, which is a monstrous thing and against nature. Therefore it is a
good token that we know not the majesty of God, though the word fly never so
roundly out of our mouth. Also there are store of sorswearings. It is a
horrible case now a days, that a man cannot wring out one word of truth, and
let there be never so much solemnity used to bring on those that are called to
witness, yet is it seen that they be all for sworn, insomuch that of the
whole number of such as are deposed, a man shall hardly find one among half a
score that will say the truth. And indeed it is a common byword among them,
that the case goes wholly with the^ when there are no witnesses: which is as
much to say, as there is not one that will speak the truth. And thus ye see
how they spite God. Also I pray you what talk will men hold when communication
is ministered about the holy scriptur, about the whole religion, and about so
holy things as we have at this day? It were meet that men should hold
themselves in awe in such caces, according as it is said that the true mark of
Gods children is to tremble at his word. But we see that men will boldly reason
of God: there is discoursing, and prating of him and of all the secrets of his
majesty, even as it were in sport: and are not these substantial proofs that
we know not what God is though his name be ryfe in every man's mouth* Then
let us mark well that the thing which is added here, (namelye that God is
wise of heart and myghtie of strength) is no more than needs. And it is true
that these words God is wise of heart: it is not meant of worldly wisdom, nor
of such wisdom as our wit is able to comprehend. And when it is said that he
is strong: it is not that he is strong as if he were a Giant or a Mountain:
but we must glorify him in such wise as we must assure our selves, that there
is no might, no strength, no power like his in all the creatures that we see:
but that all is nothing

But now let us cast ourselves down before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgeme^t of our sins, praying him to wipe the^ out in such wise, as we
may come too him looking him in the face, yea howbeit not presuming of aught
that is in ourselves, but upon his gracious favor which he has showed us in
our Lord Jesus Christ, and whereof it has bin his will to make us partakers.
And that moreover he will clenze us from day to day, and so purge us of all the
corruptions that are in our flesh, as we may be rightly sanctified to apeare
blameless before him at the latter day. And so let us all say, Almighty God,
etc.

The.xxxiiij. Sermon, which is the second upon the ninth Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth the rest of the exposition of the fourth, fifth and
sixth verses, and then as follows.

7 It is he that commands the Sun that he shine not, and the Stars are
shut up by him as with a Seal.

8 It is only he that spreads out the heavens, and walks aloft upon the
Sea.

9 He made [the starres] Arcturus, and Orion, and the Pleiades, and the
chambers of the midday.

10 He does marvelous and incomprehensible works, and vvonderfull things
without end.

11 Behold, he goes before me and I see him not: he passes too and fro and
I perceive him not*

12 If he catch and snatch, who is he that shall pluck it out of his
hands? who is he that will say unto him, what do thou?

13 God will not withdraw his wrath, and mightiest helps shall stoop
unto him.

14 What can I do if I enter into talk, and make choice of words with him?

15 Although I were rightuouse, yet could I not answer him, but I should
humble my self to my judge.


IF we had the wit to know God accordingly as he utters himself, there
should need no long process to be used: for every of us should be able too
discern the things that are set before our eyes. But forasmuchas we be so
untoward in that behalf, God had need too vpbrayde us with our
unthankfulness by telling us of his works. And to this purpose makes that
which is said here: namely And although that God having cast us in the teeth
with this vice which is in us, might leave us there for such as we are: yet
notwithstanding his intent is to instruct us to our welfare. And the two
points that we have too mark in this streyne for our own profit, are these.
The first is, that we should understand how there is not any of us that
thinks upon Gods wisdom and power in such sort as he ought to do. In deed
we can confess enough with our mouth, but the same enters not into our heart,
which thing we show by our contemptuousnesse. For (as That he walks upon
the waters of the Sea. Surely we see him not walk upon it: but were it
possible for the sea too continue in such state as it does, if it were not
restreyned by a wonderful power? we know that it is the nature of water to
sheade abroad. And yet we see that the Sea which swells up in likeness of
mountains, is besette with bounds (as we shall see in the eyghtandtwentith
chapter) in so much as if that were not, the earth should needs be covered
over out of hand. Whereas we have dry ground to dwell upon, let us not
think that that happens through any other cause, than for that it is Gods
will to lodge us here. During which time he holds the sea within bars and
bounds, not of stone or timber, but of his own only power. Although the sea
have so great a violence, as it may seem that nothing is able to hold it
back: yet notwithstanding God holds it back still even unto this day, by
the only word that he spoke, which is, that there should be some dry ground
for men to harber in. Then ought we too bend all our wits, that way, but we
do not. And therefore let us mark that it is not a superfluous or needless
doctrine when it is said that God walks so upon the Sea. Afterward here is
mention made of the stars. True it is that the number of them is infinite,
according as it is said in another Psalm, that is to wit, that there is so
great a number of stars, as would require a long discourse. But under these
few names here, Job meant to put us in mind of all the whole beautiful host
of heaven. Besides the Planets, we see the stars that are in the firmament,
and we see they serve all of them to mark out something, that we might the
better consider the wonderful woorkmanship that is in the moving of the
skies. We see well that the Sun keeps one circuit every day, that after
he is risen he goes down again, and that he turns about the earth as well
beneathe as above. Men see this. Also we see how the Sun has another clean
contrary course. How? whereof comes winter, whereof comes Summer, but of
the Suns approaching too us, or of his retyring away from us, and of his
keeping of a higher or lower gate in respect of us? For according as he goes
further from us or draws nearer to us: thereafter and ye shall see the
shyning of the Moon. Then if men had no more but this: it is enough to make
them glorify the infinite wisdom of God. According also as it is said, that
God has cut off all excuse, to the intent they should not raunge at all
adventure. Because they be no great clerks, he says no more but open your
eyes without having any further skill, and ye shall be constreyned too honor
me and to wonder at my wisdom and power, and at the goodness also that I
use toward you, in employing such creatures to your service. And all the
matter that God remoueth the mountains and they feel it not at all: it
serves too show that like as he has once settled the earth and builded it
as it were upon very deep foundacions: If it please him he can change all in
such wise, as the mountains shall be turned intoo valleys. Job then recyteth
not a thing already come to pass, in some certain time or place: but shows
how it is a thing that God can do, according as it is said in another text,
when it pleases him, the mountains melt away before him as wax does at the
heat of the Sun. And so this serves to do us to understand that he can do
it so often as he lists. Ye see then what we have to mark chiefly. This
done, we must compare them with our own fraylnesse. For what are we in
comparison of a mountain? how great firmness is in it? All the artillery
in the world can do nothing to it: and as for us, there needs but one little
finger to overthrow us. Now if Gods look be so terrible and dreadful, that
heaven and earth shake at it, (as the scripture says:) shall a mortal man
be able to stand before him? When we shall have known our own God
passes before him, and be sees him not: and that he goes too and fro, and
he perceyueth him not: wherein he does us too wit, that although God utter
himself unto us, yet shall he be invisible. How is it that God utters or
shows himself unto us? By his works, God catches, and who is he that will
pluck it out of his fist? who is he that dare say unto him, why do thou
so? Verily it seems that Job grants here an absolute power too God, and
such a one as has another right nor reason in it. But let us mark that he
pursues still the same point that was declared yesterday: that is too wit,
that Gods justice consists not only in punishing of transgressors, when
their crimes be notorious. VVherin then? Even in that when God woorketh so
straungely, as he seems unto us too have no reason in his doings, but too
do us wrong, so as even the very unbelievers take occasion too grudge against
him: even therein specially we must acknowledge his ryghtuousnesse. But in
this streyne it is said, that God will snatch. And does he snatch? No: but
hereby it is meante that if God use any terrible power that makes us afraid,
as if he were a Lion (as oftentimes he likeneth himself to the wild beasts)
in such wise as he ouerwhelmeth all, and turns the earth vpside down (as
they say:) when God thundereth after such a sort, so as we be amazed at it: yet
may no man say unto him, wherefore do thou so? and much less may he pluck
the play out of his fist. That is to say, it is not for men to plead with God,
for they shall but lose time. True it is that men think they have a good cause
to make complaints: yea and they are so senseless in that behalf, that when
they have spewed up their blasphemies, they think they have gotten the
victory of God. But in the end they must be condemned whenever God lists
to reply against them, and too make them feel his power and might: not a
tyrannouse power, as they have imagined, but yet an infinite power which
shows not itself to our understanding, to say whither god be rightuous or
no, according to that which we perceive of him. No, no: But God is rightuous
even then when we would condemn him: accordingly as it is the one and siftith
Psalm, Thou shalt be found ryghtuouse, even when thou haste condemned men.
Then may men well strive against God: but yet in the end all mouths shall
be stopped, and God shall be found ryghtuouse. And why does the Prophet
David use that manner of speech there, but because men are so presumptuouse as
to make God to stoop to their lure, and make no bones in condemning of him, to
justify themselves? Ye see then after what manner this sentence of Jobs must be
expounded. And now we see in effect how he Behold (says he) whenever I
shall come to answer before him, I will never attempt to justify my self, but
I will submit myself to my judge to entreat him. Now we see whereunto all
leans that Job has spoken, although his talk Intrcate imports that we
must plead gilty: that is to say, that we must know how there is nothing but
matter of death and damnation in us: that there is nothing but sin and
wickedness in us: and that we have none other refuge but only to his mere
mercy. Thus ye see what the word Entreat imports. And so as often as there is
any speaking of presenting our selves before Gods majesty, let us mark well
that he cannot be glorified at our hands as he ought to be, except we be
brought utterly under foot, so as all mouths be stopped and the whole world
confess themselves indetted unto God, as S. Paul speaks in the third to
the Romans. Therefore when we come to make intreatance before our judge, let it
not be with a mind to justify our selves, for we shall get no good by so
doing. Also let us not imagine that the honor which God requires of us,
consists in ceremonies nor in braueries, nor in any other like things: let us
not stand upon apish toys, as the Papists do, and upon I wot not what other
gewgawes that men have brought in of themselves. I say let us not think that
God will be served and honored at our hands with such geere. But let us bend
our wits to dedicate our selves wholly unto him, framing ourselves after the
rule that he has given us in his word, assuring ourselves that if we do so,
he will daily increace his graciouse gifts more and more in us, until he have
brought us to salvation, notwithstanding that we be unworthy of it.

And now let us fall flat before the face of our good God with aknowledgeme^t of
the innumerable faults which we commit daily against him: beseching him to make
us know the^ better than we have done, that we may be touched with true
repentance, and desire him to guide us in all our ways, leading us by his holy
spirit, and receiving us as his children whom he has adopted in the person of
his only Son: and that he will make the preciouse blood auaylable which he
has shed for our redemption: to the end that being confounded in our own
sins, and in the offenses that we have committed against him, we may flee to
his mercy for refuge: and that in the mean while it may please him to susteyn
us in our infirmities, and not suffer us to be given over to worldly vanities,
but that we may covet the heavenly things, and apply al our wits thereunto.
That it may. etc.

The.xxxv. Sermon, which is the third upon the ninth Chapter.
This Sermon contains still the exposition of the.xiij.xiiij. and.xv. verses,
and then the text that is set down here.

16 If I call upon him and he answer me yet would I not think that he has
heard me.

17 He has smitten me down with a vvhirle vvind, and he has vvounded me
without cause.

18 He gives me no ley sure to take breathe, but he fills me with
bitterness.

19 If man go to strength, behold he is strong: and if a man deal [vvith
hym] by Justice, who is he that may cope with him?

20 If I justify my self, mine own mouth condemns me: If I allege mine
uprightness, he shall esteem me froward.

21 If I say I am sound, yet know I not my soul, and my life misliketh me.

22 Behold one point wherein I am resolved: that is to wit, that God
destroys the ryghtuous and the vnryghtuouse alike.


YEsterday: we treated of this point, namely that although we know not that
if God withdraw not his wrath, all strong helps shall be beaten down by
him: and when we shall have gathered together all that may aid us, God shall
ouerturne it every whit, except he be pacified: that is to say, except that he
of his goodness receive us to mercy. For there is no hope at all that we
should prevail against him. Therefore it behooves us to fall to some agreement.
And how may God be set at one that it were but lost time to make choice of
words with God. Whereby he does us to wit, that me^ may like well to use
retorik, according as there are many that besotte themselves with their own
words, and like well of them, and are of opinion that like as they bleare the
eyes of them that are not very cleersyghted: so God shall be beguyled with
them also. But Job says here, that when we shall have chozen our words, and
told a goodly painted tale that might amaze our hearers, God will not pass a
whit for it. Then must all babbling and all retorike cease when we come before
the heavenly throne. For when I sha'l have called upon him, and he have
answered me, yet shall not I think that he has heard my voice, nor that
he has hearkened to it. Behold here a strange saying. For although God
hear us not to outward appearance: yet does he make us to feel his goodness
in such sort as we be not utterly destitute of his help. But Job says,
that when he shall have obtained his requests, so as God has had pity of
him and answered him: yet will he look to be condemned at his hand, that
his prayers have profited nothing at all. How shall we take this? There is no
doubt but that Job expresses what the temptations of men are, so long as God
shows himself against them, according as we have seen how he follows the
like phraze of speech heretofore. True it is that Job rested not there: but
yet was he touched with such a passion: and there is no man but he finds
himself in the same plight when God comes to call him, and make him to feel
his justice after such a sort, as he is utterly dismayde. We come not so low
at the first brunt, it is true: but if God come to fight against us in such
wise as we see him like an enemy or aduersarypartie against us, it is
certain that we shall be frighted with such a fear, as nothing may assuage
the anguish wherewith we shall be overtaken and incombered: and although God
have answered us, yet we believe not so: but rather we think that ^e
persecuteth us, and that in whatsoever hope he have put us, yet notwithstanding
he will not cease to increace still his stripes. Ye see then in what
discomforte they be which have once taken a conceyte that God is against
them. And for as much as this present passion is dreadful: we have good cause
to sense our selves aforehand that we may withstand it. And how will that be:
First and formest let us understand, what it is too be in like case as Job
was. There are very few that think of that. For according to our own
sensuality, it seems too us that there is none other misery nor adversity,
than that which we feel in our bodies and in this present life. And so we
come not too these spiritual battles whereby God tries us by holding our
consciences so locked up, as we wot not what to say but that he is risen up
against us, that he thundereth down upon us, and that he has set us full
before him as a white too shoot at. Although God examine My God, my God. So
long as we ca^ call upon God, assuring our selves that he is our savior, and
that we may preace unto him: so long does faith bear sway, and thereby we be
persuaded that God has not forsaken us. But yet in the mean while, we cease
not to have this ouerheady passion, wherein our flesh finds it self as it
were in a gulse, so as it has no light in respect of natural understanding,
nor in respect of aught that we can see: insomuche that when we have debated
the matter thoroughly, we can conclude none otherwise but that God is against
us, that God is our enemy, or at the least that God has set us in that plight
as a pray given up unto Satan, so as there is no more hope nor mean of
recovery. Ye see then too what plundge God puts us, howbeit but only in
respect of our fleshly understanding, according too our own reason, and for
aught that we can see by nature. But God gives us as it were a spark of
brightness, and he gives us some feeling of faith, howbeit that we neither
know it nor can discern it. And here ye see why S. Paul says, that the
sighs and gronings which God stirs up in us too make us pray unto him, are
unutterable: that is to say, they cannot be expressed. Behold a faithful man
that prays unto God, he sigheth and groneth, and after what manner? Behold
(says S. Paul) when the faithful person makes supplication unto God, he
knows not what he does: it is a thing that outreacheth his mind and al his
thoughts, not that we become like brute beasts in praying unto God: not that
we be void of understanding: S. Paul meeneth not so: but his intent is to
say, that God works after a strange fashion when we be so ouercombered
with our own passions, as we wot not what too say, nor see not any
likelihood that he will be favorable and merciful to us. Now then when we be
in such a pecke of troubles, although our insight be so dim as we cannot
perceive that, God will supply our infirmities: yet nevertheless let us tarry
his leisure till he work in us, yea even by some mean that is unknown too
us and too high for us to attain unto. Lo how Job pretends that he
believed not that God had regarded him, nor heard him, although he answered
him. To be short, he does us to understand, that this present temptation was
so unruly and excessive, as he forwent the whole taste of Gods goodness, yea
and that his faith was as good as quenched as in respect of his own natural
reason. Not that it was utterly perished: but because it was as a little fire
under the Ashes, it was as good as choked. If Job were overwhelmed with his
temptation: alas what shall become of us? If he whom the holy Ghost has set
before us for a mirror of patience was brought so low, as to be fallen into so
deep a pit of dreadfulnesse: I pray you, if God touch us to the quick, must
not we needs be more swallowed up to that whirlpoole? So much the more need
then have we to pray God, to strengthen us. And though we light now and then
into such temptations: let us not be out of heart, it is no token that God has
cast us away, nor that we be destitute of his holy spirit. And why so? For he
uses a wonderful fashion of governing and rescuing those that are his,
notwithstanding that in respect of their own nature they have conceyts and
imaginations which dismay them and plundge them over head and ears yea even
down into hell, so as there remains nothing for them to say, but that the
Devil holds them as his slaves. But what? They have their eyes so troubled
for a time, as they are not able to look at him, but they are as it were
dazeled at it: neuerthelater he leaves them some feeling of his Majesty to
hold them always back, that they should not utterly despair. Thus ye see
how the effect that we have to mark, is that in the mids of these Behold be
has smitten me down with a whirlwinde, and wounded me without cause. When
Job says that God had stricke^ him down with a whirlwind, that God smyteth
him with a whirlewind: for his intent is too utter an extraordinary manner of
dealing. It is not as though God laid upon me with a cudgel, or as though he
had given me a stripe with a swoorde: But he has afrighted me (says he) as
if he had cast down some thunderbolte or some whirlwinde upon me. The blows
that we receive here bylowe, are not always so deadly: but if thunder light
upon us from heaven, we be but dead men. Job therefore meeneth, that the
wounds which he has received are as if he were sunken into the botto^lesse
deepes. And why? For (says he) lightning and whirlwinde are fallen upon me
from heaven. And this is worth the noting. For it is one of Satan's policies to
drive us to despair, by bearing us in hand that God ha^dleth us with
unaccustomed rigor: for Satan will tell us in our ear, what meenest thou? It
is true that God chastizeth sinners, and afterward pitieth them: God visits
his own whom he loves: but that is after a fatherly manner, and he always
moderateth his rigor. But as for thee, does he handle thee so? He thundreth
against thee, and how can thou persuade thy self then, that he will show
thee mercy? It is impossible. Now then when the Devil bears us in hand that
God uses an accustomed rigor against us: he makes us to conclude, that we
shall thenceforth have no more recourse unto him, nor must not trust any more
that ever he will receive us to favor. So much the more then behooves it us to
mark this text wherein Job says that he was smitten with a whirlewinde. Now
if he have passed that way, and yet for all that we see that God did succor
him nevertheless: Let us wait for the like in our selves. And furthermore let
us mark well how Job speaks here according to his affliction: he was not
senseless. God then not only thundered upon him, but also gave him the
knowledge to feel that God thundered. It had been enough to have overwhelmed
him: but in the mean season he had a secret remedy, as I have said.
Therefore let us hope for the like. As concerning that he adds, that God has
given him many wounds without cause: it seems very rude geere. For that God
should torment men after a sort without cause, it is not only simple
injustice, but such a cruelty as he were not to be taken any more for judge
of the world, but rather for a tyrant. It seems that Job blasphemeth God
here in saying that he was smitten and wounded without cause. But if we
remember what has been said: we shall know his meening and what he speaks.
For the holy Ghost has guyded and governed him in his tung, to the intent that
we should have an instruction that might be much to our profit. Job then
first says here (according to his natural understanding) that God smites
him without cause. And afterward moreover let us mark that these words
without cause have respect to the apparent and open knowledge of men. I have
told you heretofore, that Gods Justice is known two ways. For sometimes God
punishes the sins that are notorious to the worldwarde. Ye see that God
chastizeth such a one. And why? for men have known him a shameful whoremaster,
full of silthinesse without cause: his meening was not that God as in respect
of himself did punish men without cause. For (as I have said before) that were
an unjust Tyranny. But he takes these words (without cause) in respect of
that which we perceive. And herein it is included that we must reverence Gods
justice. Although it be hidden, and ouercast with dark and thick clouds: yet
must we believe that there is nothing but right and indifferency in it. And
although that to the seeming of our natural reason we find no justice in
God, but rather that his justice is as That God gives him not respite too take
breath, but feeds him with bitterness. Here Job shows that besides that
his misery is great and excessive, it does also hold on still, and the chief
piece of his temptation is that God feeds him with bitterness, that is too
say, that he fills him in such wise with anguish as he cannot find so much
as one little scrappe of his goodness too refresh him with, that he may take
courage. And here ye see yet better, how God does now and then cast his
servants even to the bottom of their grave. And it is a thing that we ought too
mark well. For there is not that man of us, which shall not find himself
sore combered when God turns his back upon us, or if we perceive him to have
a terrible countenance so as he show himself to be as it were angry with us.
For then alas, even the boldest and most aduenterous are so quayled, as they
see nothing but death before their eyes. How shall we do then who are yet so
weak and feeble? So much the more therefore does it stand us in hand too
mark well these textes: that is to wit, that when God not only has given
poor creatures some sign of his anger, but also holds them locked up there,
so that when they would take wind and draw their breath, in hope to have
some little smack of his favor to alay their grieses withal, God comes on
still to increase the misery. Seeing that Job has bin in such extremity, why
should not we be so to* Therefore whenever we be in any mean adversity, let
us prepare our selves to receive grieuouser when it pleases God to send them,
until that he have remedied all our miseries. Thus ye see what we have to mark
upon this text. But Job bewrays himself more openly anon after, in saying:
If ye speak of strength, who is like unto God? If the matter must come too
justice, who is he that can summon him? Or who can find any matter that we hold
plea with him as if we stood upon even ground with him? There is none at all.
I conclude then (says he) that God consumes the righteous and the unrighteous
all together. There are two ways for us to recover our right, when men shall
have taken ought from us that is ours: for we go about it either by force or
by way of justice. Princes mainteyne their quarelles with bloudshedde: and
private persons would do as much, if they might be suffered. Always they
would begin by way of deeds, and hardly can they withhold them selves from
it, what punnishment so ever be prepared for them. And there is also the
ordinary means of Justice, Job takes both these things here, as if he should
say, True it is that I find my self tormented with extremity, and yet
notwithstanding, how shall I withstand my God? For if I fall to violence, what
shall I gain by it? I am no egall match for him. If I go to it by way of
Justice, will he receive me? who shall take upon him as Judge or vmper betwixt
us? whereat shall I begin my plea? To be short, I see that God consumes both
the God consumes both the rightuous and the unrighteous. How now (says he)
is it meet that forasmuch as Gods righteousness surmounteth all capacity of
man, therefore he should mingle the good and bad so together as it were in
one vessel, does not goodness proceed of him? Why then does he not know
it? why does he not auow it? why is he not favorable to it? now if God do so
consume the good and bad alike, it should seem that he has no more
righteousness in him. And in deed, ye see also how Abraham reasons with him
in the eightenth of Genesis. Lord (says he) it is not seemly that thou
should destroy the rightuous with the unrighteous: that is impossible. How
is it then that Job speaks so? We must always hold this ground, that Job
does not here take the rightuous and unrighteous, as they be found before God.
For where is the rightuous when we come there? But he takes rightuous and
unrighteous according too our perceiving. Ye see then that a man shall be
rightuous, that is too say, he shall lead a good and honest life, he shall
walk in the fear of God, and in all pureness and soundness with his
neighbors: and yet when he comes before the heavenly Throne, the thing that
we see not must needs be discovered there. Thus to our understanding we see
both the rightuous and the unrighteous to perish, and that God strikes as well
the one as the other, and that their plages are indifferent, as it is said in
Solomon. But shall we therefore blaspheme God? No: but we must always bear in
mind, that if Gods justice be apparent unto us, that is too say, if he show
it openly by punishing the wicked, and delivering the good, and such as have
served him faithfully: it is well, we have to glorify him in that behalf. But
if gods justice be not known to us, so as it seems that he confounds all
together, and that according too our imagination he punish the rightuous and
unrighteous together: yet let not us therefore cease to acknowledge and
confess that he is rightuous in himself, and that it becomes us to glorify
him in all caces and in all respects. When we take this way although things
seem utterly co^fused unto us: yet will God give us such a wisdom, as we
shall acknowledge that there is nothing done without reason: yea and the thing
which seems presently to be against us, shall be turned too our welfare. Lo
what the exercises of Christians are: herevntoo must we apply our indeuer
until God have called us home from all wars. But the chiefest assault
wherewith he will exercise us, is that we may give him glory, notwithstanding
that it seem he is minded to thunder down upon us.

And now let us fall flat before the presence of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us so too enter in the
examination of our

The.xxxvj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the ninth Chapter.
23 If the scourge kill out of hand, shall he laugh at the temptation of
innocents?

24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covers the faces of
the Judges. If not: where is he, or who is he?

25 My days are passed more svviftly than a Post, insomuch that I have seen
no good at all.

26 They be slipped away sooner than a swift ship, or than a flying Eagle.

27 If I say in my self, I will forgette my complaint, I will appease my
wrath, I will comfort me.

38 I am afray de of my miseries. For I know thou vvilt not judge me innocent.


THat we may fare the better by this doctrine, we must call to remembrance
what has been said heretofore: namely If the whip sinyte too kill, how shall
God laugh at the temptation of good men? Because this sentence is dark, and
short (which causes darkness:) it has been expounded diverse ways. But
when all is thoroughly considered the very right meening is this: namely that if
God rise up against the wicked, If the scourge (says he) does slay
immediately: that is to say, if God make no delay of his corrections, but lift
up his hand too smite men as soon as they have sinned, and do unto every man
according to his worthiness and deseruings: why should he then laugh at the
affliction of good men? for we know that Justice and uprightness consist of
two parts: whereof the one is the punishing of evil folk, and the other is the
releeuing of good folk and the mainteyning of them in their rightuous and
sound conversation. Therefore if God punish the wicked: he must also on the
contrary part mainteyne the good, so as he keep them under his tuition, and
suffer them not to be troubled or tormented, bur that they may feel his
succor so soon as they cry unto him. Howbeit (as we see) the good are
punished, not for a day or two, but with lingering pains all their life long,
so that in stead of showing any sign that he is minded to help them, it
seems that God takes vengeance of them, and is purposed to plunge the^ into
the bottomless pit. Then let us conclude, that he is not hasty to punish the
wicked out of hand, nor brings them at the first brunt too the point that men
may say, Such a one has done amiss, and therefore he must be punished. For
it were convenient that both these two things were joined together. And the
reason that Job uses here is good. For it is the same that S. Paul also
sets out in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians, saying that it
belongs to Gods righteousness too punish those that trouble the good, and to
give relief and rest to such as shall have been that God laugheth at the
temptation of innocents: he speaks after the understanding of man. For we
must not imagine that God sporteth himself in the affliction of good men. We
know what love he bears us: he cannot express sufficiently how tender the
same is, but in saying that we be unto him as the apple of his eye. Then let
us not think that God is so cruel toward us as to laugh at our torments,
howbeit that we can imagine none otherwise after the f^esh. Yea [we think thus
with our selves:] Lord, thou know the misery wherein I am, I call upon thee, I
sigh to thee, I feel how frail I am: and yet thou let me alone still, and
I perceive not that thou intendest to help me by any means. These things
considered, we conclude in our selves, that God does nothing but laugh at us in
heaven. But it behooves us to understand by faith, that when god does so
discountenance the matter, he ceasseth not to have pity upon us. True it is
that he shows it not out of hand: nevertheless it ought to suffize us, that
being a father to us he loves us as much as we can wish. For (as Jesus Christ
shows) if our fleshly fathers who are evil by nature, do love their children:
what shall God do who is the fountain of all goodness? Then That the earth is
delivered intoo the hand of the wicked, and that the eyes of the Judges are
turned aside: that is too say, that such as ought too redress the troubles,
offenses, and misorders that are committed, are guilty of all. If not (says
he) where is he and who is he? In effect Job shows here, that during this
present life, things shall be so mingled together, that men shall not (as they
say) know white from black. The Earth then shall be delivered into the hands
of the wicked, that is to say, men shall see the wicked have theirfull scope
here, that such as are most unruly, most looce of life, fighters, seditious,
and full of all ungraciousness, so as there is another uprightness nor
humanity in them, shall have all things at their will. Therefore when we see
God give bridle to the wicked after such selves, but must crave the spirit of
wisdom, the spirit of stoutnesse, and the spirit of uprightness, that god
may give them the power and ability to discharge their duties faithfully. Thus
ye see how Magistrates ought to betake themselves unto God in all care and
fear. And we also that are under them, must all of us on our part do the
like. For if there be no justice among us: behold, the curse of God is upon
us, and the Land must be defiled so far till God pour out his vttermoste
wrath upon us: and in the mean while we our selves If not, where is he? and
who is he? It is to show that when we have sought all the reasons why there is
so much evil done in the world: we must evermore come unto God. For when
the Scripture says that God does both good and evil: it meeneth that all
things proceed from him, whether it be prosperity or adversity, life or
death, light or darkness, as it is said in the Prophet If not? where is he,
and who is it? When there happens any mischief, let men search it out,
saying: who has done this? True it is that when any evil happens, we can
well skill too make our discourses, and too seek some ground of it here
beneath. If we be in a Country where a King or Prince reigns tyrannically,
men will say, behold, the King fleeceth and deuoureth his people, and moreover
makes none account of ministering justice: he has officers like himself, who
seek but to intrappe men: all is ouerturned and out of order: it is to be
seen that there is none other shift but the realm must come to utter decay:
and who is to be blamed for all this? what complaints shall be heard hereupon?
It is not marked that men are all together froward and naughty, nor that they
have provoked Gods wrath against them, and that they be folk given too all
lewdness, despizers of God, and looce of life in all points and respects, so
as it should seem they are desirous to kindle the fire of Gods wrath, to
burn up all. Men then may well allege the lewdness of gouerners, when a
Nation is so misordered after that manner: but yet must they mount up higher.
For let us not think that God is asleep in heaven, and has forgotten the
world: but rather let us assure our selves, that he works with his own
hand, and that the sins of the people are the cause why the officers and men
of law are wicked, and that for the same cause God also is feign too shake them
off, and to make them as it were mirrours of his wrath and vengeance. So then
let us so consider the inferior causes and means, as we may nevertheless
perceive in our reason and understanding, that God abides continually all the
while in his sovereign dominion, and as we may know that all things come of
him. But yet notwithstanding, we shall not always know the cause why God
works so. When we shall have searched to the uttermost, and made great
circuites and discourses: in the end we shall be dazzled and not see any reason
why God does this or that. What is to be done then? we must honor this
Justice of God which is unknown too us. True it is that sometimes God works
in such wise, as his Justice is fully apparent, and men may see it with their
eyes: and sometimes also it is hidden. And in this case we have no more to do
but to honor it, and to say: Alas Lord, thy judgments are a bottomless pit
whereunto we be not able too attain: but yet will we not cease too
confess that thou art righteous, although we perceive not the reason why.
Howbeit we must not surmyze as men do that are not well practiced in the
Scriptures, that things are done here bylowe by Gods sufferance, without caring
for them or meddling with them. For that were as much as to cut off his power,
and it were all one as if he were asleep in heaven, and left the ruling of the
world here beneath, either to Satan, or too men. It were (I say) an utter
defacing of Gods majesty. For it is meet that he should order all that he
has made, and that the same should proceed of his will and good disposition.
True it is (as has been said) that we see not always how God is rightuous:
but yet must we acknowledge him too be so, and we must walk in all
soberness and modesty, and then in the end God will make us to know that
which is hidden from us as now. Let us come to that which Job adds: he
says, that his days are gone away more swiftly than a post or a ship
under sail. Therefore is also Flying: And this word is set down too
express the better, that Job speaks not of some great ship that is full
fraughted: but of some little pinnesse that may serve to make sport and
pastime upon the water, which turns nimbly here and there and goes away
apace. Therefore he likeneth his life to a little pinnesse that is light, and
glydeth swiftly upon the water: and there withal he compares it also to a
Post: and finally My days (says he) are slipped away, like a little Pinnesse
that will go swiftly upon the water, or else as an Eagle flying in the air,
or as a Lackey that goes post. Hereby he does us too wit, that he
remembers no more how God caused him to be borne into the world not that he
had given him so many tokens of his fatherly love, as he might well have
wherewith to comfort himself: yea, if he had had such regard and consideration
as were requisite. True it is that Job kept always still some taste of Gods
goodness, so as he was never in despair. And verily although he were
tormented and tossed to and fro, yet had that if he say he will forget his
complaints, and refreshe himself of his said grief and torment: he cannot.
Why so? For (says he) I am afraid because I know thou will not leave me
unpunished, or that thou will not hold me giltlesse. In effect, Jobs meening
in this sentence, is that forasmuch as he has to do with God, he can find no
relief for his adversity and heaviness: and that although he purpose so to
do, yea and enforce himself to bring it to pass: yet does God hold him shet
up so as he cannot have any rest in himself. It is a very notable sentence.
For (as we have erst seen heretofore) if we have to do with men, we may
still have some startingholes, and we may slink aside into covert, to say, I
will find some mean or other to shift my self out of such a man's hands:
although he be a Lion and gape with open mouth too devour me: yet for all that
I may still escape from him. So then if we have to deal but with men, we may
still find some scapingplace: but if God show him to be our adversary, and
that he hold us at the staves end, and make us to say, no, behold it is God
that punishes me, behold, it is God that troubles me: we may peradventure
writh our selves hither and thither, and make all the fetches in the world:
and yet when we have styed above the clouds with our skill, God is still
higher and higher above us: and if we go down to the bottom of the deepes, his
hand can well reach thither to us: and if we pass over the Sea, his hand
shall stretch yet far further. Therefore let us learn to know that we must
seek no startingholes when we have to do with God, but must appear before
him when he cyteth us, and we shall gain nothing by delaying. Also let us
learn not to flatter our selves as we are wont to do. For behold the use
whereunto this doctrine ought to serve us: is that when we see the hypocrisy
that is in men, we should come right forth before God without dissimulation, to
discover our hearts there. For it is meet that he should search us to the
quick, and we cannnot hide any thing for ought that we can do. Therefore if
we will be at peace with our God: let us beware that we use none of the fond
toys wherewith we are wont to beguyle our selves. But let us walk in fear and
carfulness before him, and let us pray him that if it please him to scourge
us, it may be with such measure, that when he makes us to feel his
displeasure, we may not cease for all that to taste of his goodness, that
the same may serve us to assuage our sorrows, so as we may not doubt but that
he is at hand with us, to deliver us, when he shall perceive it to be for our
welfare and profit: yea eue^ because we have called upon him. Thus ye see after
what sort we ought to put this lesson in ure. The residue (God willing) shall
be discoursed to morrow.

And now let us cast our selves down before the Majesty of our good god with
acknowledgeme^t of our faults, praying him too make us feel them in such wise
as we may be instructed to lowliness, yea even to glorify him in all our
tribulations, being well assured that we have deserved a hundred thousand
times mo miseries than he sends us. And specially that we may know that he
holds us up and spares us continually, even by his fatherly goodness. To
the intent therefore that this may lead us to glorify and magnify him, and to
walk in the fear of him, until such time as having withdrawn us quyte from
all the troubles and hindrances that hold us back as now: he make us
attain too the knowledge of the things which are to deep for us as yet: let
us pray him to guide us in such wise by his holy spirit, as we may honor
his secrets till he give us the full sight of them, and make us feel by
experience, that he has been our father and Savior, when we shall have
obeyed him as true children. That it may please him to grant this grace not
only to us, but also to all people and Nations of the earth, etc.

The.xxxvij. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the ninth Chapter.
This Sermon treats still upon the.xxvij. and xxviij. verses, and then upon
those that follow.

29 If I be wicked, why labor I in vain?

30 If I wash my self in clear water, and make my hands pure and clean,

31 Thou vvilt plundge me in the mire, and mine own clothes shall defile me.

22 For he is not a man as I am, that I might beebolde to answer him, and
that we might go too law together.

33 Who is the vmper that will put his hand betwixt us?

34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let him not fraye me any more.

35 And then will I speak, and not be afraid: but I hold me still because
he is not so.


I Have begone already to expound this sentence where Job says that he
has no rest because it is God that pursues him, by reason whereof he is the
more dismayde in his adversities. For if we suffer any trouble at men's hands,
we may find some means to resist them. But if we know that God is against
us, ye shall see us so incombred, as we may well seek here and there for
remedy, but we shall Well then, I am wicked, and why then do I trouble my
self in vain? Here Job pleads guilty, howbeit not in such wise as his
friends had told him of, who spoke as then in effect as enemies. Why so?
They intended to have hild him as a condemned caytife, as a despizer of God,
and as a castaway. Howbeit Job grau^teth not that, but he says he is an
offender if it were make: it is certain that till God govern us with his
spirit, all the holiness that men perceive in us, is but hypocrisy and
untruth. But if God touch our hearts, and write his law within the same: then
shall we obey him: howbeit not thoroughly, nor with such perfect soundness as
we may come boldly before God to be acquit. Nevertheless there is great
diversity between the despizers of God, and the faithful. For although the
faithful man have many infirmities in him, and cannot walk so right as he
feign would: yet notwithstanding he has a Why labor I in vain? Thereby
he shows himself too have an excessive passion. Not that he yields
wholly unto it (for it is certain that he has resisted it:) but he
speaks of the affection that was in him after the flesh. His saying then is,
very well I yield my self guilty, I confess I am a sinner, I confess I am
wicked: But why take I this pain too no purpose? For God persecutes me here:
and though I condemn my self, yet am I never the more eased: Is it meet
that God should ouerwhelme me at the first blow? Why am I not wiped out
of the world? why does God take pleasure too hold me in so long pyning?
Seeing I acknowledge my self worthy too be condemned, what would he have
more? Lo how Job speaks here as a man in a rage. But (as I have told you
heeretoofore) although the faithful do fight against their temptations: yet
mysse they not too be shaken, and to feel such assaults as they wot not
where they be. And that is the thing which Job confesses, and verily he is
the more provoked hereunto* by the temptations of those that galled him, as
though he had gone about to make his part good against god. And that which he
adds immediately after, conteyneth a more certain declaration of it. For he
says, If I wash my self in water, so as I make my self thoroughly clean,
God shall cast me into the mire, I shall be plunged in filthiness, insomuch
that mine own apparel shall defile me. That is too say, when I shall have
cleansed my self well, the same cleanenesse of mine which at this present
bears a goodly show, shall be but dung and filth asore God. Here Job
continues still in his matter, to show that when we have well examined our
life, it shall be found that our fearing of God and our obeying of him
proceeded [wholly] of the grace that he gave us, and yet that the same dooyng
of ours, is nothing. For we must always bear in mind, that Gods Majesty is
hydden from us, and that in the same Majesty there is a certain rightfulnesse
which we comprehend not. True it is that God has well given us a pattern and
image of rightfulnesse in his law, howbeit, that is but according to our
capacity. But it behooves us to know, that our reason is so gross, as it
cannot mount so high, as to conceive perfectly what is in God. So then the
very righteousness which is contained in Gods law, is a righteousness that
is bounded within the measure of man's capacity. We do rightlye call it
perfect righteousness, and so may we name it: yea and the Scripture terms
it perfect righteousness: how ebeit but in Water, and of Snow: yet
notwithstanding, by a resemblance he meeneth all the cleanness that is in
men, according He will plundge me (says he:) behold here a strange manner
of speaking, that God should plundge him in the mire. And how is that? For it
is not the property of God to put any soil into us: we know he is the
fountain of all holiness: yea and when we be full of filthiness, we flee
too him for help too be purged and made clean by him. Wherefore is it then
that Job says, that God will plundge him in the mire? His meening is, that
God will discover an uncleanness in him which was not perceived before. And
how will he discover it? Not only after the law. True it is that the
only law of God is enough too condemn and yet they never came near it.
Such folk have a scarffe before their eyes. But if we consider what Gods
law is, we shall find that there is nothing but filthiness and iniquity in
us. Ye see then wherefore God touches us after such a manner. But behold
there is yet a higher meening in this sentence, (according also as Job speaks
it for the perfecter sort:) that is to wit, that never any righteousness of
the law shall be able too stand before God, if he list to deal rigorously
with us. And here a man might cast a doubt, and say: will God condemn hide
himself from us, and show not himself too us, neither by his righteousness,
nor by his goodness, nor by any other thing which might cause us too say
that the said glory were due unto him. As for example. When the scripture
speaks too us of his election, that he choozeth whom he lyketh, and
casts away the residue: and that he disposes of mankind at his own
pleasure: and likewise when he scourges the good, and seaueth them oppressed,
and we see that all things are confounded in this world: in these caces God
hydeth pay us: for in as much as ye be mine, it is good reason that all that
ever you have should be dedicated to me. Nevertheless I will bear with you
so far as too be contented, that if you fulfill my law, I will give you
everlasting life in reward, notwithstanding that I might requite it at your
hand with out recompense. Seeing then that God speaks thus in his law: do
ye not see his great goodness already? For this righteousness which he
requires at our hands, is such as it is to be required of pure creatures,
such as the Angels of heaven are. For there is no respect to be had too
our own nature as it is now sinful and corrupted: we must always bear
that well in mind. But seeing that God has spoken so: we should all of us
be confounded and damned, were it not that he goes on further, and sets
his mercy before us. Otherewise we should all abide accursed,
notwithstanding that we had performed all the things that are contained in
his law. Howbeeit, forasmuch as our good God holds us up, notwithstanding
that we have both the ways done amiss: that is the thing which draws us
out of the curse of the law. So then let us remember, that God does well give
us cause too come unto him: not to plead with him, nor too justify our case:
(for all mouths must be stopped:) but too acknowledge our selves by all
means indetted unto him.

But no we let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgemente of the innumerable sins which we cease not to commit daily
against him beseeching him that forasmuch as we be full of filthiness and
infection, it may please him to purge us, and to rid us from all our spttes,
and specially too correct this hypocrisy of ours where unto we be much given,
to the end that we misliking the faults and offenses which we have committed
heretofore, may desire nothing so much as too return unto him with true
repentance, assuring our selves that we shall not fail too get pardon at his
hand, at leastwise so well come too him in true soundness of heart, praying
him moreover too govern us in such wise by his holy spirit: that although
we be full of many infirmities, and be so many ways defiled: yet it may
please him to receive us, and not to use rigor and extremity toward us. That
it may please him to grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people
and nations of the earth, etc.

The.xxxviij. Sermon, which is the first upon the tenth Chapter.
1 MY soul is cut off in my life. I will leave my complaynte upon my self, I
will speak in my bitterness.

2 I will say too God, condemn me not, shevve me why thou pleadest against
me.

3 Is it good for thee to do me vvrong, or too cast away the work of
thine own hands, and to clear the device of the wicked?

4 Have thou eyes of flesh? look thou after the manner of men?

5 Are thy days as the days of men? are thy years as the years of a mortal
man,

6 That thou shou^dest search out mine iniquity, and make inquiry of my sin?


THe things that are spoken here by Job, may well be spoken by every of us so
and yet for all that it is not to be gathered but that in the mean while he
was co^bred with them a the first brunt. And he confesses here, that he was in
such bitterness, that although he should gain nothing by it, yet could he
not but strengthen himself in his complayntes, or rather give them their full
scope. For the Hebrew word that is put there, signifies both to leave or
let looce, and also to fortify or strengthen. Therefore let us mark well that
Job speaks here as a man ouerfull of passions. Nevertheless he knows
what the nature of God is, and restreyneth My soul is cut off in my life. The
Hebrew word signifies to mislyke, as if he should say, my soul is weary of
my life, or I am loathe to live any longer. But the truer meening is to say, My
soul is cut off in my life. And why so? For although he were alive: yet
notwithstanding he confesses that his state was such as he was even as good
as dead. Behold (says he) my life is no life. For I live in death. And thus
ye see that his meening was so. And hereby he confesses himself to be as it
were past hope: yea verily as in respect of Gods handling of him. He had still
a hope in God: howbeeit, too He will take leave to talk against himself or
upon himself: therein he declares that he meeneth to bewray the passions
wherewith he was turmoyled, which of themselves were evil and damnable.
Nevertheless Job intended too lay them forth, to the end men might know that
he was oppressed with heaviness, yea even with such heaviness as he saw no
remedy, but was feign to make his moan so, being a frail man. But the holy
Ghost had yet a further foresight. For he meant that Job should be a Prophet
and teacher unto us, to give us warning what our affections be. For it
behooves men to know themselves, and to be warned of their infirmities, that
they may take heed too themselves and bridle themselves, for somuche as if
they let themselves at liberty, they shall keep neither mean nor measure. Lo
how we ought too apply this lesson too our instruction. Nevertheless it
behooves us to mark well this speech where Job says that he will take
liberty to make complayntes against himself. As if he should say, I know
I shall gain nothing by standing in contention with God. Ye see then that the
Preface which he uses, imports a very profitable lesson. For men are of
opinion that they shall discharge themselves well enough, if they may frette
and grudge against God. And here ye see wherein the wicked comfort
themselves: For behold, it will seem too them that they are well eased of
their burden, when they have spewed out some blasphemies and uttered their
impatience: and yet for all that, it booteth them nothing at all, they make
their case much worse than it was. If we have any thing that ouerlodeth us,
well, if we can cast it too the ground, we be unburdened: it is true: but
If I have a great burden upon my shoulders or betwixt mine arms, and I
would cast it upon mine head, and make a great striving to do it: that
were the next way too break my neck. And what have I gained by that? Even
so is it with us, when we will plead with God: it is all one as if we would
hoyse up a burden upon our head, and it must needs fall upon it for any
thing that we can do, for which way soever we flee it shall light upon
us. We see then that men do naught but destroy themselves when they vomit
and spewe up their murmurings and blasphemies after that fashion against God.
And thus ye perceive why I said that this lesson is greatly for our profit.
True it is that God would have us use this homeliness of vnburthening our
selves intoo his lap. But the manner of proceeding therein is very diverse,
as it is said in the Psalms, and in many other places of the holy scripture:
the manner is, that we should consider that God will provide for all, and
that forasmuch as it is his office too govern the world, he can well remedy
all our needs, and will give us relief when we be ouerfore oppressed. Lo how
we may lay all our cares and greefes in Gods Condemn me not, but show me
wherefore thou pleadest. Here Job speaks still as a man troubled in his
wits. For he is very loath that God should proceed with him by the said
secret and hidden rightfulnesse whereof I treated yesterday: but he would
have God to examine him after his ordinary manner. I said before, that God
has given us a sure rule in his law: and that if we be entreated according to
our offenses, we behold Gods righteousness which is set forth there, and our
indictment is given us and laid before us in writing, insomuch that we see there
the Articles that are proved against us, yea and so well proved, as they
suffize to cast us. Therefore when men are scourged at Gods hand for their
sins: then see they in the law, not only their sentence of condemnation, but
also all their whole indictment. There the matters are so laid forth from
point to point, as they be feign to cast their heads intoo their bosoms.
Howbeit for so much as God scourges not Job after the ordinary manner, but had
granted Satan leave too trouble him: Therefore Job says, Condemn me not till
thou have first commenced thine action against me. And this is said, because
Gods secret justice is very strange for us to know: for our wits cannot
attain thereunto. And why so? For we are always desirous to know the reason
why God works so: we would have him accountable to us. And when God scourges
us, and lets us not know wherefore: thereupon we are amazed, and we are
angry at it. How so? Is not God rightuous? Then must not all that he does
needs be ruled by reason and uprightness? Yes, but I see it not to be so, but
rather the flat contrary. See how men are puffed up to plead against God, They
make discourses within themselves, yea even discourses of hartburning and
sumishnesse. Thus ye see what Job seeks in this sentence. But yet for all
that, God was able to show him plainly, yea say I, and to make him perceive
that how rightuous so ever he had been, it was good reason that he should be
chastized for his sins. And wherefore does he then make such protestation? for
he seems to bear men in hand that his case is good, if God would chastize
him by the rule of the law. No no: But he rather has respect to the purpose of
God: which is that he should confess himself unfeignedly to be a sinner, and
that although God had good reason to punish him so grievously: yet
notwithstanding he did not punish for his sins sake. And for proof thereof,
he saw many wicked folk in the world, who were spared whylest he was punished:
and as for his own part, he had always indeuered to serve God to the uttermost
of his power. Wherefore then was he so scourged, but because God had some
other special consideration? ye see then what Job pretends here: that is to
wit, to obtain that God should handle him after an ordinary manner, too the
end to make him perceive his sins. And heerewithall we have to apply this
present lesson to our own instruction, and it will stand us in great stead.
The applying of it is, to pray God to show us wherefore he enters process
against us, and why he calls us to judgment. For without that, all the
chastizements that Is it good for thee to do me wrong, and to cast away the
work of thy hands, and to make the determination of the wicked to shine? Or
[is it a pleasure to thee] to be privy or of counsel with the wicked? Here
Job speaks of the nature of God, even to the intent to obtayn his request. As
I have touched heretofore, God suffers us to use such manner of speech as
this, when we come unto him: that is to wit, [hee gives us leaue] to speak
familiarly: nevertheless, this must be done with all lowliness. For when
God is so friendly as to abace him self too the intent we should not allege
that we be set too far off from him: it is not too give us boldness to
ouershoote ourselves so as we should come scornefully to him and disdain him.
No: but it is too the end that our sorrow should not ouerwhelme us in such
sort as we should not be able to take breath, and be out Shall thou gain any
thing by doing me wrong? or by casting away the work of thy hands? Gods
righteousness is tried by this, that he is not like men who are led by
affection. Whereof comes it that men do wrong, or harm, or some other
anoyance by guile or malice to their neighbor? It is because it profits
them selves. Wherefore is it that a judge is bribed? Wherefore will he
oppress good men, and support wicked men? Will he be led by credit or
favor? It is because it seems to be for his profit, or to win the good will
of some person, or else to aue^ge him self. But none of these things it seems
that God takes the wicked men's part, and that he has made a compact with
them too give them so much the more boldness. Job then confesses, that this
temptation came in his head, howbeit that he withstoode it. I or he confesses
it to be impossible that God should not be utterly against evil, because he
naturally hates it: otherwise he should be feign to deny himself. So then
for so much as God is the judge of the world: he must needs hate all
unrighteousness. Wherefore let us assure our selves, that he will never
clear the intent of the whither God have such eyes as man has, or else
whither his time be as the time of a mortal man: it is too show that God
needs not to make long inquests against us: as if he should say, Lord, thou
know all things, yea and they were present with thee before the creation of
the world. Therefore thou need not to use the ordinary course

And now let us present our selves before the majesty of our good god, in
aknowledging the innumerable faults where of we be guilty in his sight: praying
him that after he has made us to perceive them, he will also withdraw us from
the^, and so govern us by his holy spirit, as we may fight in such wise
against the temptations of our flesh and of the world, that when we have
overcome them we may come to the triumph of glory which is prepared for us in
heaven. And so let us all say, Almghtie God, etc.

The.xxxix. Sermon, which is the second upon the tenth Chapter.
7 Thou know that I cannot do wickedly, and that no man can deliver me
from thy hand.

8 Thy hands have made me, they have fashyoned me wholy round about, and
do thou destroy me?

9 Remember that thou haste made me as of clay, and that thou shall bring me
into dust again.

10 Haste not thou poured me out like milk, have not thou set me together
like cheese?

11 Haste thou not clothed me with skin and flesh, [and] knit me together
with bones and sinevves?

12 Thou have given me life and grace, and thy visitation has preserved my
Soul.

13 These things haste thou hidden in thee, and yet notvvithstanding I know
that it is so with thee.

14 If I have sinned, thou vvilt imprison me: thou vvilt not suffer me to
escape unpunished.

15 If I have done a miss, vvo is me: If I have bin righteouse, yet shall I
not lift up my head, seeing I am filled with shame, and knovving mine
affliction.


Job going forward with that which was declared yesterday, tells God here
that he needs not to make inquisition after the manner of earthly judges.
Why so? Thou know (says he) that I can do no evil, and that no man can
deliver me from thy band. If men have an offender in ward, they will be afraid
least he should do worse than he had done before, if he escape, and specially
they labor to revenge Thy hands have made me, they have fashioned me wholly
round about, and yet for all that will thou destroy me? Here he returns to
that which was declared yesterday. For this matter has bin touched before, and
now he confirms it new again, and not without cause. For it is a matter
that ought to comfort us greatly, that if God use rigor toward us, he does
it not of any cruelty. Why so? for he Lord, will thou devour me, (for so
signifies the hebrew word which we translate will thou destroy me) seeing
thou have fashioned me wholly round about? He meeneth that there is no fault
at all too be found. For one may well make a goodly piece of work, but it
shall not be so perfectly polished alike throughout; there will be some part of
it wherein he has not used the like cunning. If a man make a piece of fair
tapistrie, there shall be no more but the outside of it bewtifull to the eye,
that which is out of sight shall be altogether il favored. But as for man, we
see he is polished through out from top to toe, so as there is one orderly
workmanship in him thoroughout, (yea according to the order of nature) and there
is no exception to be taken in him even to the tippes of his nails. Job
therefore meant to express here the infinite wisdom of God which utters it
self in the shape of man: as if he had said, Lord, will thou destroy so
excellent a work wherein a man may see thy wisdom, thy power, and inestimable
goodness to thy glory? VVilt thou take pleasure so, in defacing thine own
glory which appears and shines in men? Now we see what his meening is:
howbeit he adds that which I have touched: that is to wit, That God has
made him as clay, and shall bring him to dust again. As if he should say,
Lord, were thy workmanship taken out of me, what should remain? for my
beginning is of the mire of the earth. True it is that there is none but Adam
that God made from out of the earth. But hereby yesee from whence we have our
first beginning. We must all of us come back thither. When we bethink us
from whence men are come, and whereof they be made, that is to wit of the
earth: let us assure ourselves that the same is verified upon us al in general.
Now Have not thou powered me out like milk? Here he speaks of man's
begetting, which is a wonderful thing whereat all our wits are confounded.
For to say, that of man's seed there should engender a living wight, a wight
so polished as there should appear such an orderly disposition in him, as
might ravish men's mynds and make them astonished at it: ought not God to be
magnified therein? what Lord thou have clothed me with flesh and skin. Now, do
these things proceed of man's seed? It is nothing but infection and
filthiness, and yet notwithstanding behold how skin, behold how flesh, behold
how sinews [come thereof,] which are things whereat all the world may be
amazed. Seeing then that God has packed so many miracles together in one body,
and shows us there so fair and lively an image of his majesty: have not we
cause to say, Lord, here are things that far pass all our wit and reason?
But after that Job has spoken of man's begetting, he adds: well then, Thou
have given me life and grace, and thy visitation has preserved my Soul.
Herein he shows how God thought it not enough too have fashioned him in his
mothers womb and too have given him so excellent a shape. But besides this
(says he) thou have given me life and grace. By this word life, he meeneth
the liveliness and power that is in the Soul. For the body of it self has
no moving: it is but a dead thing. Thou therefore o Lord have quickened me:
that is too say* the shape of my body is not the chief thing that ought to be
magnified in thy work. True it is that even in that, a man may see thy
wonderful power and wisdom. But the Soul is yet more, that passes. And
heerewithall, the Soul has not the common life, such as is in the brute
beasts, whose soul has power to feel and mouse, to eat and drink, and to
go and come: not only these outward senses are in man, but also there is
reason, and understanding in him, and there is truth in him. For we see what a
number of things the mind that is in man does comprehend. Lo why Job matcheth
the word life with the word Grace: meening thereby that the brute beasts are
not parttakers of the life that is in men, but that there is in men a dignity
far greater and of much more value. And successively he declares that God is
the continuer thereof. Thy visitation (says he) [or thy looking to it] has
preserved my soul. For when God has set us in good state: yet can we not
continue unless he have his hand always reached out over us. What is too be
done then, that we may continue in the state wherein we be once stablished?
God must be feign to breath his power intoo us without ceassing, and be
continually at hand with us. Thus ye see why Job uses this word visitation
[or looking to:] as if he should say, Lord, were it not that thou look upon
me with a fatherly eye: it is certain that I should be undone every minute
of an hour. But thou look to me continually, thou know my needs, and
thou prouidest for them. Lo how I am preserved and maynteyned. And in the end
he adds: Although these things be hidden in thee, and thou keep them in
thine own mind: yet know I well that it is so with thee. As if Job should
say, Lord I know these things are so high, as I cannot reach them at all: but
yet notwithstanding, needs must I have some ame of them: I know it is so with
thee: that is too say, I have not so perfect a knowledge as were requisite: but
yet nevertheless, I know it is so. I have some taste of it on my part: which
suffizeth to make me conclude, that thou haste laid forth so great
treasures of thy wisdom, goodness, and power in me: as it is impossible for
me to value and esteem them as they deserve. But now I see how thou handlest
me. For I am unhappy, thou haste shet me here in prizon, and I shall never
be able to get out. And why so? I look upon the trouble wherein thou haste
set me: and because I see not the end of it, behold I am so abashed, that
although I were rightuouse, yet durst I not look up too excuze my self before
thee. I am utterly barred of all [plea*] like as when a judge will not admit
any allegations, but barreth the party of his plea, then must the party needs
be condemned, notwithstanding all his replications. Even so is it with me,
says Job. For I see that although I perceive not my self to be faulty: yet
notwithstanding thou have punished me grievously as now. But this is spoken in
respect That God has created us as of Clay, and that we must ^e brought to
dust again, when he shall have withdrawn his grace which he had spread out
upon us, and this must teach us lowelinesse. For we see how men set much by
themselves, and every one of us could find in his heart to be advanced above the
clouds. Why so? he that knows him self well, sets little by himself.
But men through Thou have poured me out like milk, thou have fashioned me like
a cheese in setting me together, and thou have clothed me with skin and
bones. Truly his phraze of speech seems somewhat strange at the first
blush. And how so? Had the holy ghost no fitter things to say? had he no better
kind of speech to express what the begetting of men is? These are things that
seem not answerable nor agreeable to the majesty of God. But it is not for
naught that Job speaks so. For (as I have said heretofore) men must be
abased be they never so loath, or else they would always be so puffed up with
pride, as they could never come to this consideration (which notwithstanding
is needful) too think, what is it that God has put intoo us? and what would
become of us if he should withdraw his grace, and quite separate himself from
us: Men will never come so far, but by force. And therefore it behooves us
too be brought to this mire and dirt, that are spoken of here. True it is
that they which are subtle, (that is to say, which that God has clothed man
with skin and flesh, and knit him together with bones and sinews. For it
serves to express better, what has been said before: that is to wit, what
difference there is between the seed of man, and that which we see in man's
body. Ye see the seed is but filth and corruption and ye see the flesh is
lively: ye see there is skin, there are sinews, there are bones. Let us
consider a little what manner of workmanship there is in men's skins. The very
heathen were forced to say, that such as knew not that there is a sovereign
Godhead, might be convicted thereof even by one only nail of a man without
going any further. Ye see our nails are as it were superfluouse in our bodies:
and yet notwithstanding, if we look well upon our nails, we shall see a
wonderful workmanship in them. For they serve to arm the fingers, that they
may be put to work, and hold whatsoever is necessary by bowing of the fingers.
Therefore it is certain that a man's nail which is but a superfluity, is a
lookingglasse of Gods providence to us, so as in the same we may perceive,
that he has wrought in such wise in us, as it is impossible for us to know
the hundredth part of the woorkmanship that he has put in us. Ye see then
what is uttered here: namelye that there is great odds between the seed
whereof men are begotten, and the things that are to be seen in man's body.
But yet the chief thing is the Soul. And that is the cause why he says,
Thou haste clothed me. For hereby Job meeneth, that the chief part of men
consists not in the shape that is seen with our eye, but in that which
dwells within it. For what imports this manner of speech, and what is meant
by saying, Thou haste clothed me? It must needs be some guest that is lodged
in our body. And who is this guest? It is the Soul. We see then that the
chief part of men is the Soul which God has put into them. There is so
excellent woorkmanship in the body: as we must needs be astonished at it: and
what is to be thought then of that which surmounteth it, and is far higher,
and of much greater worthiness? Behold the degrees which we have too
remember. So then although this manner of speech (as whereby God meant too
teach the veriest idiots) be rude and gross: yet notwithstanding we see
things still in them which are able to move us thoroughly to set our whole mind
upon them, though we were the sharpestwitted and finestheaded in the world.
But yet Job expresses further what the excellency and worthiness of the
Soul is, when he says, Thou haste given me life and grace, and thy
visitation has preserved my Soul. When he says, thou haste given me
life: he shows that the body were nothing (no though it have so goodly and
wonderful woorkmanship in it) if it had not the liveliness that is shed into
it. For So Much then as God has quickened us: therein he has uttered his great
goodness, and we ought to glorify him the more therein, and to acknowledge
ourselves bound unto him beyond all measure. True it is that we have much
more in us than common life: and if there were no more but that same moving, it
were much of it self. Let us behold the brute beasts. It is a great matter to
say, behold a beast shall come of seed, that is too say of corruption: and
although it have not that which is in man (I mean even as touching the body)
yet has God put this mouingnesse into it. We see that in the nourishment of
beasts when they have eaten grass, the same turns into blood, into light,
he meeneth that the image of God is imprinted in us, because we have
understanding and reason, because we discern between good and evil, and
because men are borne to have some order and common society among themselves,
so as every man has a conscience of his own It is thy visstation o Lord, that
has preserved my Soul. Hitherto he has spoken of that which we may see in
our creation or begetting. When any of us is begotten: then does the mire
show it self: that is to say, we be full of infection and filthiness. And
therewithal appears also the said workmanship which God has put into it,
both in respect of body and soul. But what for that? If God preserved us not,
we should needs perish every minute of an hour, as it is said in the
Psalm: Lord when thou sendest forth thy Spirit all things are renewed: and
when thou withdrawest it, all things go to wrecke and decay. God then must
be said to maintain us, too look unto us, and to be always at hand with
us: or otherwise we be utterly undone. Behold here a point that is well
worth the weying: namely this visitation of Gods in looking to our souls. And
the souls are spoken of precisely by name. Why so? If he had said, Lord thy
visitation preserves my body: my body shall not go to the grave at the first
brunt, and why so? even because thou mainteinest it by thy power: if there had
been no more but that said, it had been much: but it is far more without
comparison when Job speaks of the Soul. And why? For it seems unto us,
that our soul has of it self the power to quicken our body, and to give it
liuelynesse. And this is partly true. But it behooves us to understand
moreover, that our souls are not immortal of their own power, another is the
life of them enclosed in themselves, as though it had his root there. Where
is their life the^? In God. So far forth then as God, puts any drop or
spark of life into men's souls: so far forth have they liuelynesse in
them, and not otherwise. Thus ye see what we have to mark upon this streyne.
And specially let us hearken what the holy Ghost meant to express by this
word visitation: which is that God mainteineth us continually, and looks to
us to preserve us, or else we should go to wrecke. The Philosophers can well
say, that God has created and fashyoned us, and that we have our being of
him: but therewithal they are of opinion that after God has set us in our
race, every man guydeth and governs himself. Lo how they deface the
goodness and power of God: and unto the same loudness are all men inclyned.
So much the more then stands it us in hand, to mark well this word
visitation: which imports as much to say, as when God has put us into this
world, he lets us not alone there, as if he should say, walk ye every
one as ye can: but he abides with us continually, and has his hand always
stretched out to breathe his power into us, to the intent we should not
miscarie. Therefore seeing we can not continue, except he have his eye always
upon us to visit us and look to us: we must learn to rule our life in such
wise, as if we were evermore in his presence. And for as much as the same
assures us of Gods infinite goodness which he shows toward us: let it
make us to walk in the fear of him, to magnify him, and to yield him his
due praise.

And now let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults: praying him too make us perceive them better,
that we may be sorry for them, and be so grieved, as we always seek the
remedy of them, which is, his reforming of the^ by his holy spirit, that
like as he has created us mortal men, so he will make us members of our Lord
Jesus Christ that we may be repaired after his image, and that he look not at
that which he has put into us by nature, but at that which he has put into
us by his grace, which surmounteth all, specially seeing he has voutsaued to
make us new creatures to inherit his heavenly kingdom. And [further let us
beseech him] not only too continue the good that he has begone in us, but
also to increase the same till it be come to full perfection, and in the mean
time bear with our infirmities, that although we be guilty before him, yet he
will not condemn us with rigor, but recciue us as his children, accordingly
as he has voutsaued to adopte us in the name and by the mean of our Lord
Jesus Christ. That it may please him, etc.

The.xl. Sermon, which is the third upon the tenth Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the.xiiij. and.xv. verses, and then upon that
which falloweth.

16 Let it increase, come thou as a Lion and shevve thy self marvelous upon
me.

17 Thou renevvest thy plagues against me, thy wrath increases about me:
the svvoorde of change and the multitude are upon me.


YEsterday we saw how God preserves us in the state wherein he If I have
sinned (says he) thou will imprison me, and thou will not let me go
unpunished. As if he should say, Lord, thou hold me as it were upon the
^acke. For he matcheth imprisonment against some sudden punishment, which God
might lay upon him, and come to the wells head. If I be wicked (says Job) woe
is me. If ^ be rightuous, yet may I not lift up my head, seeing my trouble
and being fill(...) with reproach. Job goes on forth with the matter which I
have expounded already heretofore. For he considers, that if he be wicked,
the law of God shall condemn him: and that if he be rightuous, there is yet
an other righteousness above that, whereby he shall not miss to be condemned.
That is a thing which is not so well known as this: and no marvel. For
although God have told us in his law, that we are all damned, earth. Although
the righteousness of the Angels be perfect in respect of creatures: yet is it
nothing but smoke when it comes before the infinite Majesty of God. Then
let us mark well, that the law which was given us, is a full and certain
rule whereby to live well. And when we can once do and perform that which is
enjoined us there: then shall we be taken and reckened for rightuous before God
in all perfection and goodness, but yet for all that we shall not be so
rightuous as to say, there is any worthynesse in us, so as we might deserve
anything at If I be wicked, woe unto me. Why so? For it is said, cursed be he
that performs not all the things that are contained in this book. Cursed be
he that worshippeth not God. Cursed be he that breaks the Sabbath. Cursed be
Although I were rightuous, yet will I not lift up my bead. Why so? Because
(says he) I see mine affliction, and am filled with shame. Whereby he
meeneth, that Gods increasing of his afflictions, is as much to say, as he
has sovereign authority over all men: and that although they be ryghtuous,
yet may he execute such rigor upon them, as may be thought strange: and yet
that how so ever the case stands, men shall gain nothing by checking
against him: they may well plead and I see here mine affliction, I am filled
with reproach, as if he should say, God holds me in such awe, as I wot not
what to do, and if I reply, I shall gain nothing by it. Herein Job bewraieth
his passions. For he should have confessed: well, God is rightuous, and not
only his law will serve to bridle me, but also I know there is an other
higher righteousness, than that which is known to us by his will and by the
record of good and evil which he gives us to rule our life by. I know then
that God has an other higher righteousness than this, and therefore it
behooves me to submit my self under him. Job ought to have spoken so: but he
bewrays, that it is as it were by constraint, that he acknowledges a higher
ryghtuousnesse in God, than the righteousness of the law. For he says, I see
mine affliction, I am filled with reproaches, and therefore I will not speak a
word. If this befell to such a person as he was, what shall become of us?
Then let us inure our selves to consider well Gods true and peculiar
righteousness which is incomprehensible to us, and let us honor him in all
his secrets, and let us not conceive the things that are in him, after our
own wit: for we see our own smalnesse. And to be short, what must we do?
Truly, for the condemning of our selves, we need not to climb so high as to
say, God has a righteousness which can not be comprehended by creatures,
and where unto man's wit can not reach. We have not too do with this for
the condemning of our selves: for the law will be enough for that matter,
as has berre showed already. As often then as a man shall be so proud as to
think he can maintain himself before God by his own works, let him be
think himself well, and look upon Gods law. For it is not for us to of the
slander that Satan made of him, in saying, Job obeys God because he is in
prosperity: and therefore God meant to show the contrary. So then when we
speak of Gods sovereign justice, let not our talk be to think that he
presses us out of measure, nor to auaunce our selves against him by force: but
let it be to honor him in his wonderful secrets, yea even in such wise,
as we may be fully resolved to say in our selves, Alas, it is not for us to
allege, that though we be righteous, yet we will not be so bold as to lift
up our head: for we have that he would feign that his plague were increased.
Yea but what Although it increased (says he) yet will thou come upon me as a
Lion, and will show thy self marvelous against me. Here as before Job
treats of Gods secret judgments, which man can not reach unto, by reason
that the same do far pass his understanding and wit. And that is the cause
why he calls God marvelous. True it is that we shall always find Gods
law strange, because it wakeneth us up beyond our imagination. And we our
selves also see, that when the wysest men do speak of soundness and
perfection, they come short of the rigor they that serve them in that behalf,
make no conscience nor sticking at all to slay, rob, and pill? Ye see then
that men are as ill as wild be astes, and much werse. And should God use such
instruments? How should that be possible? Again we see that the Church it
self is turmoyled: ye see what persecutions it is put unto: and who is he
that rayseth the^ up? Furthermore we see that the doctrine of the Gospel is as
it were trodden under foot by the tirannie of wicked caitifes, so as lies
reign in stead of truth. And who is it that makes such troubles? It is the
rightful Thou will she we thy self marvelous against me. But In ^^at he
will* renew his stripes and fall to changing. True it is that the Hebrew word
which is put for Stripes, wounds, or plagues: signifies as much as Records,
witnesses, or witnessings: and not without cause. For the plagues which. God
sends upon men are as it were witnesses brought forth against them, and
proofs that God makes too bring things to knowledge. But in this place Job
speaks of Stripes, wounds, or plagues, whereby he meeneth the chastizements
that God had laid upon him. Therefore he says they were renewed, in so much
that he had new chastizements laid upon him. This is a thing well worthy to be
noted. For although we find Gods working to be strange to our understanding:
yet notwithstanding there is nothing that hinders us more from the knowledge
of Gods righteousness than this temptation does. That (I say) is the thing
wherein men find themselves most hindered. True it is that as often as any man
alleges any piece of scripture to us, which is not to our lyking, the same
greeueth us, and by and by we fall to arguing against God. But specially
weshewe our stubbornness when we be smitten and beaten by the hand of God, and
we can not be brought to confess that God is rightuous in all his
chastizements. Behold (say I) a thing whereunto we can not be made to agree. And
so ye see why Job having spoken of Gods wonderful working, adds, Thou
doublest thy plagues against me. But for as much as this matter can not be
discoursed at length to day: let us mark that there is nothing else for us to
do but to flee unto God, praying him to give us such a taste of his word, as we
may quietly receive whatsoever is contained in the same: and yet that
whenever it shall please him to use rigor toward us, he will so moderate
his rods, that although he make us feel the smart of them, yet we may not
cease to have recourse unto him as to our father, to the end he may always
receive us as his children.

And now let us kneel down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us know them in such wise,
as we may not any more be blinded with hypocrisy, or with pride, or with
the fond follies whereof our heads are full: but that being utterly ashamed,
we may always have recourse to the remedy that is given us, which is too
embrace the redemption that is purchased us by the death and passion of our
Lord Jesus Christ: and that we knowing the same to be the only mean whereby
we may be reconciled unto God, may come to it with assured trust that he
will hear us: And therewithal that it may please him so to aid us with his
holy spirit, as he may make us to walk in the fear and obedience of him,
until he shall have restored us fully, and that there remain no more sin
and corruption in us. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to
us, but also too all people and nations of the earth, bringing back all poor
ignorant souls from the miserable bondage of error, etc.

The* xlj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the tenth Chapter.
18 Why haste thou brought me out of the womb? O that I had dyed before
any eye had seen me.

19 That I had bin as if I had never bin, and that I had been carried from the
womb to the g^raue

20 Shall not the portion of my days come sone to an end? Let him withdraw
himself quickly, that I may take my breath again.

21 Before I go into the country of darkness and into the shadovve of death*
from whence there is no returning again.

22 Intoo the dark country where there is nothing but darkness, even thick
darkness, where there is nothing but disorder, and when it should shine,
there is but darkness.


WE must call to mind what was spoken Wherefore haste thou taken me out of my
mothers womb? no doubt but he sinned in so saying. For it is a point of
unthankfulness in men not to acknowledge them selves very much beholden to
God in that he has made them and fashioned them, notwithstanding that they
live never so miserably in this world. And is it a small thing that God has
put us into this world to reign therein, to have the fruition of all his
creatures, to bear his image here, to know him to be our father, yea and to
find him to be so by experience? Wherefore have thou taken me out of my
moothers womb? Verily if we look no further but to the life of man, we
shall always be feign to come to this proverb which is common among the
heathen, or at least wise among the most part of them: namely, that it were
good for men never to be borne, or else to dye out of hand. They that have
reckned the miseries and inconveniences whereto we be subject while we live
here by low: have thought, how now? It were better for men never to be borne.
For what else is the beginning of their life but weeping and wayling? The
little babes before they have any understanding, do show there is such a
seagulfe of miseries in us, as it is a pity and terror to behold: and
afterward as we grow in years, so do our miseries increace in number and
quantity. Therefore it were better for men that they might never be borne: and
if they must needs be borne, it were good for them too dye quickly, that they
might have no long journey to make. And this talk has partly some reason,
howbeit it is not without unthankfulness. And why so? For although the
miseries be innumerable wherewith men be oppressed: yet must we wey them in
the balance with the honor that God does us in making us Lords over his
creatures to have dominion over them here below, as his children, whom he
makes to feel him as a father toward us, and morouer because his setting of
us here in this world is to advance us aloft, that is to wit too the
heavenly life, whereof he gives us some perceyuerance and feeling before hand.
If this be thoroughly known, surely it overcomes all the miseries and
troubles that can happen to men in this world. And thus ye see why I said
that this sentence (namely that it were best for men not to be Or that I had
been carried from my mothers womb too my grave, and that I had been as though I
had never been. This is the second part of the proverb which I said was used
among the infidels: namely that when men be borne, it were good for them to be
soon dispatched and rid out of this life. But as I have touched already, that
were a small regarding of the honor that God does us in giving us such
dignity and pre-eminence over all his creatures. And if his hand, we fall
too our old byasse, and we could find in our hearts to sit still in our
own works if he would let us alone. Ye see then here the second vice. And
further, our hating of this present life i^ because we cannot live here,
after our fleshely lusts, which notwithstanding are wicked and corrupt. We
would have God to give us leave to off end him, yea, if we could make such a
bargain with him, our life should be sweet, and we would desire nothing but
to tarry here. We see then that the cause why men are weery of their I would
I had not been borne, or that I had been carried from my mothers womb to my
grave: it is an inordinate manner of speech, and although he rested not upon
that point for a do* yet he offended God. And here ye see good cause to mark
well that which is said here. For if he had been carried away after that sort
from his mothers womb^ too his grave, no eye had seen him. That is yet one
other unthankfulness. For this life ought too be well lyked of, not only
because every of us knows upon what condition and to what end he was
created: but also because God ought too be glorified in us. When we look
upon a creature whom God has sent into the world, have we not therein as
it were a mirroure of his goodness? Then as often as we may behold a man with
our eyes, we must make the same to serve us to glorify God in that behalf.
But Job would have been dead at the first dashe, and that was as much as to
darken Gods glory: which thing was not without a smacke of unthankfulness.
And so we see how he ouershotte himself in all things, and that he hilde
not the measure which he ought too have done, and therefore have we the more
cause too be well advised. For if this temptation befell unto such a man as
he was, how much more shall we be carried away being so frail as we
be? Immediately he says: O that God would withdraw his hand from me,
and get him away a while, that I might have some respite, before I go down
intoo the dark country, intoo the shadow of death, where is nothing but
confusion. We see here how Job is still carried away, that is to wit,
because Gods judgment lay sore upon him. And this is it that I said before,
namely that he not only felt the bodily adversities as every of us shall
seele them: but that his chief grief was that God was against him, as if he
had been at deadly fewd with him. Thus ye see what did pinch Job with such
distress and Let him get him from me a while: We see yet better how
miserable the state of poor sinners is, when they Before I go intoo the dark
country, and intoo the lyghtlesse pit, where there is nothing but confuzion
and disorder, and where is night when the day ought to shine. Here Job speaks
like a man that has no belief, either of the immortality of the soul, or of
the resurrection that is promised us. Where is he become then? Let us mark
that in this place he expresses the passions of a wretched sinner, which
seeleth nothing but Gods wrath, as I have touched here too fore, but yet have
we need too be put oftentimes in mind of it, because it is for our behoof.
Job then is brought here to such a hell [of mind,] as he thinks that God
is his judge, and himself as a reprobate before him, so as there is no hope of
grace or forgiveness for him. Lo wherefore in speaking of death, he feels
nothing but confuzion. And how so? For death serves too turn Gods order
vpside down, like as sin had turned all things vpside down. For when God
created man, it was not to the intent he should have bin mortal. True it is
that we should not have lived evermore in this world in the same state that
Adam was in. For God would have changed us into glorious immortality. But yet
notwithstanding, we should not have by(...)ayn to have dyed, neither should our
mortality have needed to have bin renewed. The state of Adam should have bin
such, as when he had lived [his full time] in this world, he should have had
his everlasting heritage enlightened us, so as we shall have walked in hope of
the everlasting life while we be in this world: although God take us hence, and
death before our eyes: yet let us not therefore cease to call upon God, and to
tarry his leisure till he comfort our souls in his own Kingdom. For they be
alwais incombered and have not their perfect joy, so long as they dwell in our
bodies and till that God take them up to himself for a do. True it is, that
if we think upon death alone by it self, without lifting up our selves any
higher, God may now and then bring us to the same

Now therefore let us fall down before the Majesty of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them in such
wise, as we may thereby be provoked too sighe and groan continually,
beseeching him of pardon: and that we may not be so astonyed at his
judgments as too faynte at them, but that being condemned by them (as we
be worthy of right too be condemned) and being ashamed in our selves, we
may return too our good God that he may make us too taste of his inestimable
love, which he uses toward us by showing himself to be our savior in the
person of our Lord Jesus Christ his son: so as we may be stablished in the
hope which he gives us of our salvation, and grow in it more and more, until
such time as having incountred against all the assaults that we have to endure
here bylow, we may come to the everlasting rest which is prepared for us in
heaven. That it may please him, etc.

The.xlij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xj. Chapter.
ANd Zophar the Naamathite ansvvered and said,

2 Should not men answer a man of much talk, or shall a babbling person
prevail?

3 Verily thy words shall make men hold their peace: and when thou have
mocked, no man shall do thee shame.

4 Thou have said, my dealing is rightful, and I am clean in thy presence.

5 But I would that God would speak to thee, and that he would open his
lips against thee:

6 That he vvoulde discover unto thee the secrets of vvisdome: for his
judgment is double rightful, and God has forgotten thee for thine
unrighteousness sake.


THat we may the better profit oureselues by this doctrine, we must call to
mind what has bin said heretofore: namely that the matters which are set
down here, are true in themselves, notwithstanding that they be misseapplied
to the person of Job. Thus see ye an instruction that is good and profitable
for us, so be it that we have wisdom and discretion to know how to use it
aright. And in effect we be done here to understand, that whenever Should
not men answer a man of much talk? or shall a babbler prevail? Here we
see how men's talkatiuenesse is dashed, yea though they like well of
themselves, and have store of their vain and fond Rhetorike. For behold what
beguileth them: namely that they can justify themselves before men and bear
the countenance of Angels, whereas there is nothing but want and filthiness
in the^. True it is, that they may have some apparent reasons that men shall
like well of: for in very deed, according to man's reason, when it is demanded
what righteousness is: it will be answered, that a man must live unblameably,
he must discharge his duty, he must do every man right. Ye see then what
righteousness is. If it be said that a man is rightuous before God though he
be a wretched sinner, and that his sins are forgyuen him: behold that is a
strange thing and such as cannot sink regard unto that. After such sort
will men part, supposing themselves to be thoroughly well discharged. And (as I
said before) they conceive rancour and hartburning against all warnings. Now
we see what the holy Ghost condemns here: that is to wit, that men do so
flatter themselves and rock themselves asleep in their vain imaginations, as
it seems to them that they have gotten the goal when men like well of their
doings. But all this is nothing. For when we come before the heavenly throne,
none of these pedling trifles shall take Thou haste said my dealing is just
and rightful, and I am sound in thy presence. Here Zophar shows what the
babbling is which he condemns. Verily (as I have warned you before) he
misapplyeth this matter too the person of Job, and he does him great wrong by
accusing him unjustly: nevertheless the doctrine in it self is good, holy,
and profitable. Let us mark then that all such as mind to justify
themselves God. And why? For (as it is said here in the end) we shall have
such an answer as shall serve too ouerwhelme us utterly. If in these days
we sharpen our beak to vaunte our selves of our own righteousness, and be
puffed up with this vain opinion (or rather outrage) that we be well able to
stand before God: in the end he must be feign too answer us, yeahee must
be feign to answer us after such a sort, as we shall be confounded
therewith, according as it is said here, shall a babbling person prevail?
We may perchance Yeal would feign (says he) that God would speak
against thee, and that he would open his mouth. Behold how men are
reproved too their confusion: that is too wit, when God opens his mouth.
So long as we reason but with men, well, every one of us may think his own
halfepenie too be good silver: but as soon as God opens his mouth, we have
nothing too reply. All that (say I) which we believe to be as substantial
stuff as any can be, must needs go too the that there is nothing but all
evil in us, and we hear how it is said, that even he that dares vaunte
himself most, shall find nothing but cursednesse in him, from the crown of
his head too the soale of his foot. Again, though God should find us
thoroughly well disposed to walk in his fear: yet what is that too the
purpose? We shallbe always imperfect nevertheless. But the mischief is,
that whatsoever God says in his word, yet we continue always still at one
point, we have our eyes still shet: and it seems too us that howsoever the O
that God would speak and open his lips against thee. And he says expressly,
that God opens his lips. In deed it is an Hebrew manner of speaking, and it
reports a vehemency of speech, like as when a man treats earnestly That
God will reacole the secrets of wisdom. Verily in saying so, he shows that
Job might well have been punished double: that is to say, that he might have
had twice as much justice executed upon him, and God might have forgotten him
for his miquities sake. or else might have serched him, for the Hebrew word
signifies too Exect, and sometimes also to require an account, and such other
like. And therefore a man might expound it, that God was able too charge him
with such things as he should perceive himself to be double in his danger:
and all comes to one end. But first of all, whereas it is said that God
will reveal a wisdom, that Job wist not of before: it is to show us, that
the knowledge which we have of our sins, and of the inestimable goodness of
our God, passes all our capacity, and is a wisdom that can never be
atteyned unto by man's reason; but must come too us from above out of heaven. I
have warned you already, that this geere is misapplyed unto Job: and in deed
he knew well enough that men must not measure Gods righteousness by their
own wit. Job has well opened that point himself, and (as I have showed) he
had a good case, howbeit that he handled it amiss. But the line that we must
go by, is this: namely to take this present doctrine generally, that we may be
profited by it. Behold the^ a special point: which is, that the things which
the Scripture tells us of the righteousness by faith, are a higher secret
than men can attein unto. What is too be done then? God must reveal it unto
us. And that is the cause why the Papists cannot assent hereunto. For they
hold themselves continually too their own imaginations. They know what is
righteousness after the manner of the heathen Philosophers. For if a man ask
an heathen Philosopher what righteousness is: It is a life well ruled in all
vertuousnesse, will he answer. And even so also do the Popish divines reason
of it. We say that the same is true in it self: but we must step yet
further: that is to wit, to another righteousness which is not in men, and
whereof there is not one drop to be found there. Then must they be feign to
have an other righteousness, which is, that having condemned us in our own
persons, he should take us to mercy for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake: that by
his mean we may be acceptable and holy too him, for so much as the obedience
which Jesus Christ yielded unto him, is set over unto us. But (as I said)
this geere enters not into man's brain. And here ye see why they that take
themselves to be most witty, put their trust in their own strength, because
they purpose to comprehend it by man's reason. But what? Let us not think it
strange, seeing it is said that it belongs only unto God to reveal his
own wisdom. As if it were said, True it is that so long as men tie
themselves to the imaginations of their own wit, and will needs judge after
their own liking, they shall never understand what it is to be rightuous
before God, they shall do nothing but babble: and when they have set never so
many Air colors upon the matterial of it shall be but smoke. And why so?
Because that to know after what sort we become rightuous before God, is an
inestimable wisdom, and hidden from man's reason, until such time as God have
spoke unto us, and disclozeth to us what is our confusion, and until he have
made us perceive that we be not able to stand before him, but are utterly
cast away as cursed creatures, and that there is none other mean for us to
have access unto him, but only by coming unto him in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ his only son.

And now let us cast our selves down before the presence of our good God and
father, with acknowledgement of our sins: praying him that his making of us
to feel them, may be to amend us in such wise, as we may not desire any thing
so much as to come nearer and nearer unto him, until we be come thither in full
perfection. And so let us all say, Almighty God and our heavenly father, we
knowledge, etc.

The.xliij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xj. Chapter.
7 Shall thou find God in seeking him? Shall thou find the full perfection of
the almighty?

8 It surmounteth the height of the heavens, what vvilt thou do? It is deeper
than the bottomless depthes, how vvilt thou comprehend it?

9 The vvydenesse of it is brother than the Earth, and the largeness of it is
greater than the Sea.

10 When he moves himself to shet up or to leave out, who shall let him?

11 And seeing he knovveth that men are vain, and sees that they be of no
force, shall he not perceive,

12 That an empty man is endued with heart, and a man is borne like a vvilde
Ass?


FOr as much as it is no easy matter for us to conceive how too humble our
selves: therefore ye see how God stands the more upon this doctrine, too the
end we may have so much the more occasion to put the same in ure. Yesterday
we saw that if God For it ouerreacheth the Heavens, it is deeper t^an the
bottomless pittes, and the wydenesse of it stretches through all. Let us have
an eye to our own measure. Behold how man who would ouerreach the whole
earth, needs no more than six foot too cover him. Man is desirous to
enclose the whole sea in his imagination: and in the mean while he himself
is nothing. He would feign surmount the heavens: and how shall he come
thither? He would gage the bottom of the depthes: and what means has he to
do it withal? Nevertheless let us put the case that man's mind is able to
stye above the heaven* and that nothing could be hidden from it: yet should we
come short of Gods wisdom, because it is infinite* It cannot be compared
either with the deepes or with the heavens: for it far ouerpasseth them all.
And therefore let us assure our selves that our presumption is foolish when
we go about to know the reason of Gods doings. Thus ye see in effect what is
showed to us here. Wherefore let us mark, that this word Wisdom, is taken
here for Gods purpose, determination, or intent, which we be not able to
comprehend. True it is that we may well taste some little portion of Gods
wisdom, like as when we behold his creatures, there he shows himself unto
us, howbeit but partly. Let us no more but take a branch of some herb, and
we shall which God gives us when he shows us that which is for our profit
to know Some will use the common Proverb, That Gods secrets are not to be
searched. True it is that they are not to be searched, saving so far forth as
he makes us privy to them, and then are they no more secrets. As how? Ye see
how S. Paul calls the Gospel a wonderful secret which has been hidden
in God, yea in so much as the Angels have been ravished and amazed at it, and
highly honored it. And yet nevertheless the same is an easy doctrine to us.
For there God likes well of us: How we be governed by his holy spirit, to the
end we should fight against the lusts of our own flesh: and how we be
reserved under his hand and protection, so that although the Devil practyze
too overthrow us every minute of an hour, yet we may be able to drive him
back, because we be in the sheepefolde and keeping of the good sheepeherd
Jesus Christ, who has promised that he will not suffer any of them to perish
whom the father has put into his hand. Therefore let us get the knowledge of
these things, and further Who is he that can let God, if he list too shet
up? If he list too let looce, If he list^ too remove all, If he list too
make a new order: who is he that can disappoynte his purpose? Who shall
set himself against his good pleasure? After it has been told us that we
ought not to be over inquisitiue of Gods wisdom, furtherforth than he gives
us leave and license: Here the same knowledge is declared too us: namely that
it is not lawful for us to grudge against his doings, as though it were in
our power too restreyne him. The reason is for that we ought too like well
of all that ever God does, although we know not why he does it, but that he
hide it from us: not that he is loath to have us conceive the reason of his
works: but because it behooves us to have him try our obedience, that we may
know what we be. If God should give us a full declaration of his works here
as now: who should be able to endure our pride? what would we think our
selves to be? For although we see our wit to be so weak, that we feel our
selves to be wrapped in darkness or clouds, and that our understanding will
not reach threefoote before us: yet a man may see how we cease not to auaunce
our selves aloft: and therefore what would become of us, if God should not
reyne us short? Moreover what honor yield we to God, when we will
comprehend all his doings? It should seem that we would be hayle fellow
well met with him. For we see what pride is in us already. And therefore it
is good that God should try our obedientnesse, too the end we may learn to
glorify him in all our doings, yea even though they be things to us
unknown, and though we find them so strange at the first pushe as they make
us to say, by all likelihood this ought to go otherwise. But let us say,
seeing that Gods good pleasure is so: it behooves me to yield thereto. When
men are once come to such a discretion, then have they greatly profited. Ye
see then what the cause is that God shows us not why he does this or that.
Furthermore whereas here is mention made of Removing, shetting up, and letting
out: it is as much as if it had been said, if God should change and
transpose all that ever we see: yet ought not we to gaynesay it, nor presume
to strive with him, or to allege any thing against him. True it is that when
we behold the order of nature that God has set already, we ought of right
too glorify him for it as it is. And certainly God has set us in this world
as on a great stage too behold his works, and to confess that he is wise,
rightuous, and mighty, yea even after a wonderful manner. For it behooves men
not only to be taught too give him glory with all reverence: but also too
be thoroughly rapted above all their senses and understanding to acknowledge
and cry out with David, that it is impossible too atteyne too this wisdom of
God, which appears in his works: and that although God should change all
the orderlinesse wherein it is his will that we should behold him, and
wherein it is his will too keep us occupied at this day: yet nevertheless it
should behoue us to submit our selves thereunto, [and to say] that he does it
not without cause. If we think it strange: then (as I said before) let us
learn to say, yea: but who art thou wretched creature? I pray you if a man
have gotten great understanding and skill, and yet knows That God knows
that men are but vanity, and that men are no^thing worth: and how then should
be not understand that man who is borne as a silly wild Ass, knows not
himself, and yet thinks himself able to match his mighty power? This is
the conclusion of the doctrine that we have heard. Discourse has been made
concerning Gods mighty power which reaches above the heavens, and is deeper
than the deepes: and therefore when men take upon them to be too inquisitiue of
it, they must understand that they be as it were swallowed up of it: and if
they will needs give their curiousness the bridle, to search the bottom of
Gods power: he must be feign to show them that it is not lawful for creatures
to lift up themselves against him whatsoever he do. Thus ye see now a
declaration which serves to apply this general doctrine to the present
purpose: which is, that God on his side knows what is in men: and on the
other side that men are no such things as they should have cause to advance
themselves to call God to a reckening. For what are we? Let us a little
consider our birth. Men are like wild Asses, that is to say, they have none
understanding except God give it them. As touching the first point, it is not
without cause that he says, that God knows that men are but vanity, and
that they be nothing worth. For it is too the end we should learn not to
value our selves by our own reason, and after our ordinary manner. When men
value themselves, it is after their own fancy: they believe this and that of
themselves, and thereafter do they give their verdit But all this is nothing
worth, we must esteem our selves according too that which God has spoken.
For there is none but he alone that may be a co^petent judge ^o know what we
be, nor that has authori(...)e to say it* which thing we ought too mark
well. For when men have valued themselves by their own imagination and
opinion, what shall they have gained by it* It is like as when a fool calls
himself king of some country, and in the mean while every man laughes him to
scorn for his labor. We be double fools, when we ween our selves That the
empty man shall be endued with heart, and shall be like a wild Asses colt. Here
we be brought back to our birth, to do us to understand that all the wit which
we have is Gods gift besides our nature. And why? Let us look upon the power
of men. When a little babe comes out of his mothers womb, what Heart
imports understanding. Let us mark then how it is showed here, that when we
have any wit or reason, the same comes not of our own nature, neither do we
possess it as though it grew up with us: but it behooves us to know that it is
an excellent benefit which God bestows upon us. Seeing then that we have it
at his hand, what an unthankfulness is it of us to abuse it against him?
Therefore let us acknowledge his benefit in giving us wisdom and discretion
when we come to age, to know both him and our selves, and to honor him. Let
us learn then to hold our selves in humility, and according as it pleases
God too give us understanding, let us acknowledge the same to come of him: and
let us pray him to make us to apply our wits to such use as we may always
walk after him, and hold our selves under his awe, until that being set
free from this bondage of sin, we be conveyed into the heavenly glory, to
behold him perfectly as he is.

And now let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us perceive them and to
grant us the grace to apply our wits, and indeuer too consider what we be,
that is to wit, wretched, vain and unprofitable creatures, unable to do any
thing of our selves, so as he must be said to furnish and strengthen us, or
else we must needs utterly quayle. And that such knowledge of our own
weakness and feebleness may provoke us too return with greater desire too
the grace which our good God offers us, seeking nothing but to be filled
with the same, to the end we may honor and magnify him in all respects,
until he have brought us to the perfection whereunto we be called, without
swaruing one way or other, for fear of turning out of the right way of
salvation. That it may please him too grant this grace, not only to us, but
also to all people. etc.

The.xliiij. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xj. Chapter.
13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thy hands unto him,

14 If thou put the iniquity from thee which is in thy hand, and that no
unrighteousness abide in thy tent,

115 Then may thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shall be sure,
and shall not be afraid:

16 For thou shall forget thy misery, and shall no more have it in remembrance
than the waters that are passed by.

17 And a time shall spring up more bright than the noone day, so shall thou
shine and be as the morning.

18 Thou shall be safe, because there is hope, thou shall dig a pit and lay
thee down safely.

19 Thou shall rest thee, and there shall be noman to make thee afraid, and
many shall sue too thee.

20 But the eyes of the wicked shall sail and forgo their refuge, and their
hope shall be [turned into] anguish of mind.


We have seen heretofore the lowliness that ought to be in men when they
think upon Gods works: that is to wit, that they must not presume to judge of
them after their own fancy, but they must understand that we must settle
our heart and stretch out our hands unto him, and afterward, put all
wickedness out of our hands, that none may dwell in our houses. Behold (I say)
how men may obey God, and not turn aside from him: namely by beginning with
the soundness of the heart, because God abhors all dissimulation. at their
pleasure through their own motion, because God commands them so to do. He
does but only show that we be bound too do so, and that all that ever we be
able too attempt shall not be esteemed nor received at Gods hand until such
time as we have the said pureness of heart whereof mention is made in this
place. But now let every man examine himself, and we shall find our selves to
have hearts of stone, so as there is nothing in them but hardness, another
reigns there any thing in them but naughtiness, and such a continual
stubbornness we must stretch out our hands unto God. This imports very
much. For under all that ever we have within us. This doing (I say) is
invisible. Nevertheless, by holding up our hands unto God, we declare that it
is he to whom we have all our refuge. Thus we see why Prayer is betokened by
the sign of it, in the holy scripture: not that the same sign is the whole or
the principal point of prayer. For the Hypocrites can skill well enough to
stretch out both their hands and their arms too and it seems that all that
ever is in the^ were burning fire: and yet for all that there is nothing but
falshod in them, and they do but mock with God. Therefore it That we must put
away all iniquity from our hands, and that it must not a Well in our houses.
It is a manner of speaking rife enough to say, We have clean hands: for by
our hands we meddle and deal with the matters that are between us and our
neighbors And therefore he that robs his neyghbor, or does him any violence
or any anoyance, has foul hands: like as on the contrary part it is said,
that the children of God do wash their hands when they keep equity and
uprightness, so as they give not themselves to misdealing, but rather have a
regard to serve every man's turn. And Zophars meening in this place is, that
the man that will be blissed of God, and prosper, must withhold his hand from
all vnrightfulnesse, or drive away al vnrightfulnesse from his hand. Have we
then called upon God? have we protested that it is he only at whose hands we
look for salvation and all welfare? have we glorified him as becomes us?
Then there remains that we communicate with our neyghbors also without doing
any man wrong, so as no man may complain that we have put him to loss or
hindera^ce: and that we be clear from al violence and guile If we live with
our neighbors after this manner: behold, God will also draw near unto us. Thus
ye see how we shall perceive that he is ready to bestow all good things upon
us that we can desire, and which are meet for our salvation. But forasmuch as
men do willingly bear with themselves, yea and that to excuse ourselves in
evil doing, we seek so many shifts and starting holes as it is horrible to
behold: it is said that misdealing must be chazed and banished out of their
tents: that is to say, men must not only do none evil directly, so as it might
he cast in his teeth to his shame: but also he must beware that none evil be
done under his shadow. As for example, if he be the master of a household, let
him hold his wife, his children, and his servants in awe, and let him take good
heed, that there be no wrong done to any man, by overthwart means, or by
wicked dealings. Thus ye see why it is precisely added, That misdealing must
not dwell in our tents. And now have we in effect that which is said here.
But now remains that every one of us think better of it than we have done.
For this doctrine consists not in words, but must be put in ure by every
man, and every of us must think upon it thoroughly. There is nothing here
which ought not to be very common and familiar to us, and why then are we so
far off from it? Even because the more part of us are contented to hear
speak of it, and yet notwithstanding leave the chief point of it. To the
intent therefore that we may be touched the better and the more to the quick,
let us mark first that we must not go about the bush with God, but keep the
right way that is showed us here. My saying of this, is to draw us out of all
the superstitions and fond Apes toys wherewith men beguile themselves too too
wilfully. For as for these general principles men can find in their hearts to
confess them welynough: namely, That it is good reason that God should be
honored and served: and that without we do so, he will curse us and cast us
away: and that it ought to be no wonder though he punish us and consume us with
adversities in this world. For seeing that we work spite against God, must not
he needs ouerwhelme us? Every man (say I) will well confess this. Again for
the second point, it will not be denied but that God will have pity upon us
when we turn unto him: and that if we serve him as we ought to do, he will
not deal so hardely with us but we shall find him by experience to be both a
father and Savior to us. Men will well enough say so. But when it comes too
the deed doing, it will be well perceived that there was nothing but
hypocrisy in all these goodly be a good servant of God, if we may be believed
upon our word. But when it comes to the deed doing, there a man shall see
the clean contrary. He that has preached of Charity, and spoken marvelous
well of it, will show that he is wholly given to himself when it comes to
the point that he must join with his neighbors. As in good sooth there are
none so shameless, but they will always be speaking of Charity. They have
been accustomed to have so much charity used toward them: as they preach
none other thing. But if a man ask them watches always over us, and will
defend us too the end, if we seek it is at hand, and endeavor to serve
and honor him, so it be with a pure and right meening mind, utterly void of
all hypocrisy, as I have declared already.

But let us cast our selves down before our good God and father with
acknowledgement of our faults, and sins, praying him to bring us back unto
himself, and that for as much as he sees such an untowardness in our nature,
that all our thoughts and all our affections are

The.xlv. Sermon, which is the first upon the twelfth Chapter.
Job ansvvered and said,

2 Yea, you are a people, and wisdom shall die with you,

3 I have wit as well as you, and I am no whit inferior to you: and who is
he that knovveth not the things that you allege?

4 I am aiesting stock to my friends, to him that calls upon God, and
whom he hears: the rightuous and perfect are skorned.

5 As a torch that is despised of a rich man, whose foot is at the point to
slip from him.

6 The tents of robbers do prosper, and they that hold God in their hands do
boldly provoke him.


IT seems at the first blushe, that these two sayings, (namely that such as
fear in the law, that we shall live in peace and rest if we follow Gods
law: what is the cause that men vex us and trouble us, but for that we have
made war against God? When a mortal man aduaunceth himself against his
creator, it is meet that he also should have enemies to vex him and anoy
him. Are we then persecuted by men? Let us look if we have kept peace with
God: let us consider that we have provoked his displeasure: and therefore let
us not marvel though he give men leave too vex us after that sort on their
side. And here ye see why you are a people. Some have expounded this sentence
as though Job had meante that they which had spoken, had brought nothing but
such stuff as was known too all men, yea even to the very idiots. But it is
clean contrary. For his meening is to say, It seems that you are the whole
world, it seems that wisdom shall dye with you. And think ye that I have no
wit? Esteem ye me to be your underling? The things that ye allege are too
well known. Therefore must I be feign to be despised of them that call upon
God and are heard of him: that is to say, of such as God seems to favor,
and therefore agrees to all that they wish. I must be feign to be a
mockingstocke to such folk, I must be feign to be as a torch that wastes,
which is despized of you that are rych. To be short, they that hold God in
their hand (says he) do boldly spite him and provoke him. And all this while
the tents of the wicked and of the unthrifts do prosper. Hereby Job shows
how it is a great folly to affirm generally and without exception, that God
does in this present life punish all such as have offended him, and that as
soon as a man has done amiss, God redresseth it by and by, and has his
hand up to take such vengeance as the party has deserved. We see the
clean contrary. This (as I said before) seems to be repugnant to the
doctrine of the law, where it is said, that God will curse all the
transgressers of his commandments, and that he will show his favor and
goodness toward those that keep them. Men see that the hauockmakers are as
it were favored at his hand: and men see that the good are despised and
disquieted. What is meante by that? Did Godiest when he promises to bliss
the faithful, and pronounced such a curse upon the despisers of his word? No:
But I have already loozened this knot, by showing that God executes not his
judgments all after one rate in this world. And why? We must always bear
in mind what has been said heretofore: that is to wit, that if God should
punish those that have done amiss, like for like (as they say,) so as if
the fault were great, the punishment should be answerable to it, and if the
fault were light, the chastizement should be suddeine upon them: and that the
good should be dealt with after their hearts desire: whereto should the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ serve, and the resurrection which we wait for?
There should be no more hope: we would conclude, behold, God shows himself
to be the judge of the world: and let him do well that lists, if he will
receive well at Gods hand: there would be no more any heavenly life: we
should have our heaven here. So then we see that God should provide ill for
our welfare, if he should make the punishments like to the offenses of all
them that do amiss. And therefore it is requisite that diverse yea and the
most part of punishments should be reserved. When God punishes the wicked,
well, it is to make us walk in fear and wariness: and also it shows us
that we can not escape his hand. For he judges without respect of persons.
Then must we conclude, that all the faults which are committed at this day,
and which abide unpunished as in respect of this present life, shall come to
accounte at the end, that is to wit, when the great assyses are hild. Lo how
Job speaks not against the doctrine of the law, but against the false
exposition that is given by Zophar, who would that God should presently make
such execution of his judgments as he should leave no fault vnfounde
out, nor we need too wait for any further dooyng. But it falls not out
so, as has been showed before. Hereby we be taught too pray God too give
us the spirit of wisdom, that we may apply well to our own use the
doctrine that is true and good, so as we may have skill to take profit by it.
For here we see a doctrine that is very profitable for our edifying, when God
shows us that if we serve him, we shall not loose our labor, but he will
You be a people, and wisdom shall dye with you. Hereby he meant to
repress the foolish haughtiness and presumption of them that have spoken. For
otherwise there is no dealing with such as are so puffed up with vain trust
of their own skill: men must needs show them their folly. True it is that
oftentimes men shall nothing avail by so doing. For he that is thoroughly
sotted in his own fond ouerweening, what so ever a man tell him, will
nevertheless be wedded too his own opinion, and take himself too be that
which he is not. Yet notwithstanding when we are too encounter against such
as miswrest God truth, we must not stick to show them their folly and
ignorance. Verily it may not be done as though men would show whither of them
are sharpwitted or of better skill. For behold, so do they that have nothing
but ambition and vaineglorie in them. Every of them would feign make a great
show. He that begins would feign amaze men with his talk, and he that
answers would also advance himself: very well, ye see a battle of fools.
But we must not deal after that sort. Therefore if we encounter them that
corrupt Gods truth and wrest it unto untruth, and that we come to show them
their ignorance: We must not do it to seem better learned or skilfuller,
nor to purchaze our selves the more estimation: but we must content ourselves
to have made way for the truth, that it may be received, and that men be no
longer wedded to such as be in reputation, to the overthrow of that which
was well builded. As how? At this day a man shall see many poor silly folk
hilde still in their superstitions because they say, what? So many great
learned men have hild the doctrine that is followed now adays, and stand still
in the same to this hour: and will they be beguiled? Behold at what point
many poor weakiings are, because they before possessed with this imagination,
that it is not possible for the Prelates of the Church, the learned men, and
the great personages, to be ouerseene. Now if we will teach such folk, to
make them come to the knowledge of God: it is requisite that they learn to
know the beastliness and ignorance of those whom I am not inferioure to you,
I have heart or wit as well as you: he meeneth not to magnify himself I am
(says he) as it were a despiser of my frundes. True it is, that as the words
lie, he says he is as it were despized of his frinds and forsaken of him: but
in very deed, he speaks of himself in the third person. Afterward he likeneth
himself to a torch or a link that wastes and is shunned. What can a man
look for in a torch when it comes to the end? For the wax droppeth down,
and men draw back from it that it ray them not, and if any of it light upon
them it is enough to mar their garment. Therefore when a link or a torch
has lighted men for a time, and served men as long as it can: they cast it
away, every man shunnes it, and there is nothing more in it but stinch. This is
it that Job means in saying that the case stood even so with himself. Ye
see that I am ready to fall (says he) and therefore ye despize me. He
shows the reason of this similitude, saying: because ye see I am as it were
at the brim of my grave. That is the cause why I am forsaken of you. And he
says also that the rich men do mock him that is afflicted. And why? They
call upon God (says he) and he hears them. Job means not hereby that the
wicked wait for their welfare at Gods hand, or that they seek it in him: but
he means that they have the world at will so as it seems that they have God
in their hands and that they carry him in their sleeue (as men say) according
as we shall see that he adds afterward. True it is that some expound this
sentence to be meant of the Idolaters which make God to come to their hands:
but that is a foolish and unreasonable exposition. For Job looked no further
than to the prosperity which the wicked have. For all welfare comes of God,
and the wicked have more abundance of it than other me^: and does it not seem
then that God is as it were in league with the^, and that he sotheth the^, and
yeldeth himself to their lust? A man might properly say that God flattereth
them when they live so in rest, and prosper in such wise as they have
shortly whatsoever they desire. Job then says, that those me^ provoke God so
much the more boldly, and yet in the mean while their houses are happy.
Whereby he meant to betoken that which I have told you before, that is to
wit, that Zophar did him wrong in saying that he was a great sinner.
Wherefore? For (says he) the contrary is to be seen. Now let us come to
that which he says concerning their contempt. I am despised (says he) as a
link or a teach that is wasted. Here in the person of Job we be taught that
our Lord gives the world leave to skorne us, and suffers our state to be so
miserable as it seems that we be utterly forlorn: and therefore behooves it
us to be pacient. Why so? We see what befell unto Job: and that his foot
slid: meening that so long as he was able to stand, he had bin as a torch or
link. For it will do a man ease too have a burning torche, and the light of it
will do him service: yea so long as it is whole and able too last. But if it
be once wasted, a man will cast it away intoo the canell: for he that bears
it must needs burn his hands, and there remains nothing but a little
glimcing dark smoke. So then, Jobs intent That the tents of the wicked shall
be in peace: verily (says he) because they hold God and make him come into
their hands: and yet even those same do provoke him the more boldly. Behold
whereof comes the contemptuousnesse of the unbelievers, and what is the cause
that the wicked are not contented to vaunt themselves as though God favored
them, but also proudely and cruelly trample all those under their feet, which
walk singly and uprightly, saying, what is he? and what is he? For it seems
to the^ that Gods exalting of them is to the end they should despise others and
shake them off. And here ye see a temptation which is troublesome and hard to
overcome. But so much the more stands it us on hand to mark well this text.
Then let us understand that it is no new case, that the wicked are now adays
advanced, and that they raunge abroad and triumph for a time. It has always
bin so but God suffers it to their greater decay, and he suffers it also to
meeken us. Then if the wicked happen to have their full scope: let us not lose
our courage for all that, but let us serve our God steadfastly, and let us glory
in this hope that he has given us a lasting life, notwithstanding that he
suffer us to be combered as now. For if we be not miscarried when we see God
advance naughtipacks and set them as it were above the clouds: if we be not
overthrown thereby, but continue always sure and steadfast in our vocation:
behold that is a good warrant of our faith. And this is it also which I said
before, namely that it is good and profitable that God should try us after any
sort: and that when the same happens, we ought not to think it strange,
considering that it has bin so

But let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgment of
our faults, praying him to make us feel them in such wise, as we may come to
submit our selves unto him, not to stand upon the defense of our own
righteousness and sound dealing: but to yield our selves guilty, and to desire
him to use his infinite mercy toward us. And that forasmuch as he has
already showed us the way whereby we must come unto him, that is to wit, by
bringing unto him the obedientnesse of our Lord Jesus Christ, that by the
mean thereof all our faults may be buried and forgotten, it may please him to
receive us in the said name, and not only forgive our sins, but also govern
us in such wise by his holy spirit, as we may always get the upper hand, even
till our lives end, yea and even over death it self and over all the
temptations that the devil is able to raise. That it may please him to grant
this grace, etc.

The.xlvj. Sermon, which is the second upon the twelfth Chapter.
7 Ask the cattle, and they will teach thee: ask the fowls of the air,
and they will tell thee.

8 Or speak to the earth, and it will inform thee: and to the fishes of the
Sea, and they will report it to thee.

9 Who is he that knovveth not these things, that the hand of God has done
this?

10 In whose hand is the soul and all the breath of all living things.

11 Does not the ear discern words, and the roof of the mouth the sauoure
of vittells?

12 There is vvisdome in old men, and age brings skilfulnesse.

13 In him is vvisdome and strength: in him is counsel and skilfulnesse.

14 He will throvv down, and no man shall be able to build up* he will shut
up, and no man shall be able to let out.

15 He will restrain the waters, and all shall dry up: he will send them
forth, and they shall ouerflovv the earth.

16 He has strength and might in him: of him comes both the deceived and the
deceyuer.


TO show that there was nothing but mere ambition and vaynglory in all that
Zophar had said too him, Job tells him that he knowth well what Gods
providence imports in governing the whole world, and that it is a And for
proof hereof he will cast down, and no man shall build up: if he list to
shut up a man and to keep him in prison, no man may deliver him. So then let
us understand, that there is a wisdom in God, which is ouerhigh and secret for
us. Verily (says he) unto him belong, both be that beguileth and he that is
beguiled. As if he should say, God will send the spirit of error (this is
a strange thing, and such a one as we think very hard) and he will so blind
those that ought too keep themselves from beguiling, as they shall be utterly
blockish: and that comes then how Gods goodness shows and declareh it
self. We see his righteousness in that he watches over his creatures, and
cares for them: and therewithal on the other side we see also his justice: we
see how he governs the world after a wonderful fashion, so that although the
wicked seek nothing else but to bite at it, yet must they be feign to be
confounded by it. Therefore let us learn to apply our endeavor better to the
beholding of Gods works. When the sun shines, let us consider that God
kindles that light, to the end we should be led and guided The palate (says
he) ^rieth the taste of vittels, and the ear discerns words. Hereby he
finds fault with his friends for letting the things pass which he had spoken
before, and for that they had not voutsafed to consider whereunto it tended, as
if they had bin deaf. Job then blames them for such retchlesnesse: but the
matter points at us all. For proof here of let us mark how quick a taste
we have to discern our food: every of us has skill to say, This is good for
mind wandreth abroad: he aduentureth, and trudgeth up and down. And whence
comes such witness? It is because a man's affection leads him and carries
him away in such wise, as he knows not where he is. We see as much in those
that labor to come to estimation and too set themselves in credit and
dignity. Those also will gather all the means that are possible to advance
them, and they will have reasons to allege for them selves on all sides. Yea
even the whoremongers that are carried away with a beastly lust, and the
drunkardes that are as VVisdome is in old men, and age brings skilfulnesse:
In him is wisdom, skilfulnesse, and counsel, and altogether. Here Job makes
comparison between God and men. For the point whereof he had bin accused was
this, that he regarded not the time past, that he considered not the things of
antiquity, and that he bare not in mind what had bin taught by such as had
lived long time in the world. And heerevpon he says, yea verily, there is
wisdom in old men. Truly this may and thither, but that we may be fully
settled in certainty that we hold our doctrine of him. For the better
perceiving hereof, we must note that there are two extremities. For we shall
see some brainlesse persons despise all the gifts that God gives to men: and
the vnskilfullest will be presumptuousest in that case (and that is too common
a thing) in so much as they will brag of their beastliness. Look upon a man
that never had any knowledge: and he will think that he has so much more
cause to stand upon his reputation. And we see diverse now adays It is he: it
is to exclude all that is in men. For when the Sun shines, it darkneth the
light of all the Stars: and what can men do when God comes among them? And
that is the cause why it is said by the prophet Esaias, That all creatures must
cease when God shyneth. And Job meant too repeat expressly here with many
words, that the perfection of all wisdom is in God: too the intent we should
not surmise that it needed to be supplied: as we see men so foolish, that if
they have received any blissing at Gods hand, they must be adding of somewhat
to it, they must make some mingling of it. No no: there must be no patching and
piecing in that matter. When God puts his wisdom into us, it must be used
pure and simply, and men must not add any thing to it whatsoever it be. But
Job meant too step yet farther (as I have touched before) namely that there is in
God a secret wisdom which surmounteth all the capacity of man, and whereunto
we cannot attain as yet. True it is that Gods wisdom is not diverse and of
sundry sorts as in respect of it self: (for his wisdom is a thing
inseparable, and such as cannot be divided or parted) But in respect of us and
to our seeming, God is wise after two sorts: that is to wit, we may say there
are two particular kinds of Gods wisdom, howbeit but in respect of our selves.
And how is that? There is the wisdom which is contained in his word, the
which he imparteth in such wise unto us, as we become wise by receiving the
instruction that he gives us, and that is the wisdom which he
communicates to his creatures: and moreover there is that wisdom which he
keeps still in himself And what manner of one is that? It is the woonderful
Providence whereby he governs the world beyond all that we can conceive.
Behold God dispozeth the things which we take to be very confuzed to our
understanding. When tyrants bear sway (as shall be said hereafter) when wicked
me^ seduce silly folk, and carry their souls to destruction, and when the
other sort are saved: all this is done by the wonderful providence of God. But
if we seek what is the reason of all this: then are we in such a gulf, as
all our wits must needs be swallowed up. Thus ye see a wisdom which God
keeps to himself whereof he makes not men partakers, according also as it
is impossible for them to atteyne unto it. So then when we shall have been
taught in Gods school, and are become wise by comprehending that thing
according too the measure of our capacity, which it shall have pleased him to
teach us by his word: let us know that there

Now let us kneel down before the face of our good God and father, with
acknowledgement of our faults and sins: praying him to voutsafe too make us
know them better: that feeling the seeblenesse which is in us, we may learn to
humble our selves under him, and not presume upon our own strength and
wisdom, but seek in him all that we want, and walk under his hand and under
his guidance. Also let us pray him to govern us in such wise, as all our
wits and senses may be hyld prisoners [vnto him,] that he may have such a
soueraintie over us, as he may reign peasibly, and we consent with his Angels
to obey him willingly: and that in the mean season we take not any thing upon
us above our ability, nor abuse the gifts that he deals unto us, but
that we may always acknowledge them to come of him, to the end we may seek
them there, and yield him his due praise for them. That it may please him to
grant this grace not only. etc.

The.xlvij. Sermon, which is the third upon the twelfth Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the. 14. 15. and. 16. verses which have been
touched in the former Sermon.

WHen we see the things come to pass which are reherced here it seems to us
that God governs not the world but that all goes at adventure, or rather
that if God break down, no manshall buyld up. Whereby is meant, that if Gods
hand be against us although we had that help of all creatures, all of it shall
not boot us, but we must needs perish. Behold in effect what is contained
in this sentence. At the first blush we may well say it is so: but we be not
yet touched. Ard for proof hereof, If God scourge us, we bethink us not
with whom we have too do: but we go to seek means to succor our selves,
and it seems too us that we may well shifte off the mischief by our own
cunning, or if so be that men be willing too help us. True it is that God
forbids us not too think upon our selves, to shift for our selves, and too
have a regard how too remedy things: yea he makes this dealing too avail:
howbeit not after such manner as we have bin inured to. For when God
afflicts us, the first remedy is to humble ourselves under his hand, and
too seek atonement with him. This done, we may well desire him too give us
means too provide for our necessities. But to arm ourselves against him, is
not the way to ward the blows of his hand. Thus ye see what were our duty.
But clean contrary to this kind of dealing, we see there is nothing but
rebelliousnesse in this world when God intends to humble it. Then if we
minded this doctrine thoroughly, we should not use such manner of dealing as we
do. For it would come thus to our remembrance: will God cast us down? and who
is he that can build us up again? therefore must he himself be feign to put
to his hand. And so, have we offended him? Let us crave pardon of hum, to the
end he may have pity of us. And though his judgments be hidden from us: yet
must Buyld, Job comprehends all that concerns man's state: as if he had
said, That it belongs only to God to build us up: whenever he has set us
in any trade, we must be stablished in the same by his power: and when he
lists too throw us quite down and too That if God lock up a man, no body
can let him out. As if Job should say, that it belongs only to God to give
us liberty: so as if he list, although we seem to have both hands and feet
at liberty, If God hold back the waters, and stop them, there will be drought
and that if God list to le^ the waters looce, there shall be fluddes, to bear
al before them, as it were to rake up the earth, that there shall be another
trees nor houses left vnouerthrowen. And Job speaks purposely of holding the
waters and of letting them go, because we know not Gods hand sufficiently
when it works all after one rate wherewith we are acquainted. Does the
Sun rise in the morning? That is an ordinary thing with us, we think not of
it, another does it waken us sufficiently to come unto God. Does he send any
Rain? That comes not in our minds. When we see it rain, if a man ask us
who sent it, we will confess well enough that it is God. But yet for all that,
this consideration pierces us not to the quick, and therefore it moves us
not to humble our selves under Gods providence, and to acknowledge that all is
in his hand, and that he directs our life. There are very few that think of
that. So then Job has made his choice here of such works as are rarest and
least accustomed am^^g men. For when we see a drought that lasts, then every
man is touched. If he make fair wether, and rain now and then in the mean
while, so as the earth does not utterly dry up: men think not of it. But is
there come so great a drought as men perceive that corn cannot grow, it
thriueth not, behold the seed is dried up in the ground and comes to
nothing, there can no fruit come of it: if there come such an extraordinary
drought: then ye shall see us touched. Eue^so is it also with great rage of
waters. If he send Showers and they anoy not: tush we ouerpasse it, and have no
regard at all of God. But if there be continual rain, so as all rivers
ouerflowe their banks, and it seems too be as a new general flud: then we
mark and bear that in mind. Jobs meening then is this, that when things
happen in such wise as it may seem that the order of nature shall change, and
that there be so excessive droughts as it may seem that all shall be burnt up:
we must know that God has not laid the bridle looce in fortunes neck, but
that it is he himself that works after that fashion. Also when there falls
so great rain as it is likely that all shall go to havoc, let us assure our
selves that it is God which works it. But certesse as drought may well come
sometimes for notorious sins, so as men may perceive wherefore Gods vengeance
lights: according as he threateneth us in his law to shet up the heaven in
such wise as it shall be as brass, that no drop of moisture can be gotten
thence: and that the earth shall become as hard as iron, so that the seeds
shall dwin, and the ground shall yield them no nurrishment nor heart: and also
that the air shall be deaf, that when the earth opens his cranyed mouth as
if it were a thirst, the air shall not answer it. Our Lord then does rightly
manace us in his law, that he will execute such punishments upon us, verily
for our sins sake. Neuerthelater it will sometimes fall out, that we cannot
discern why God works so, we shall not have any such knowldge as may lead
us to judge that it is god which shows us the reason thereof. Nevertheless it
becomes us to honor his power and wisdom, although the end thereof be
unknown to us. Then must we humble our selves in all sorts: whether we see
the earth as it were drowned with water, or whether it be seared up with
drought, let God be always glorified. And after what manner? Even by
confessing that it is he which does it. For first it behooves us to acknowledge
his power, and afterward we must match his power with such wisdom, as we do
not grudge against him, nor blame him of tyranny and outrage. For it is not
all one too say, It is true that God governs the world, and therwithal to
imagine a tirannicall power in him. But (as I have touched already) if we will
glorify God aright, we must acknowledge him to be almighty: and therwithall
we must also honor his infinite wisdom whereunto we cannot attain: in
consideration That in him only is all power, and all skill and rightnesse. The
second word which is set here, comes [in the Hebrue] of Being, so as it
signifies Being: and therefore a man may take it for all things that have any
seeming to be, and yet are not firm and substantial: like as the creature may
well make some show and seem to flourish, howbeeit the same is but a shadow,
it perishes out of hand, and they themselves vanishe Being. Nevertheless it
is oftentimes taken for Gods law, and for instruction: and it is also taken
for a Princes commission or proclamation. But we have seen heretofore, that
Job speaks not only of Gods mighty power, as who should say, he has all
things in his hand: but also he said that he is perfectly Being, but rather of
the uprightness or government which he uses. For we know that in as much as
he is the Judge of the world, he must needs govern all things uprightly. And
so it is nothing but a repetition of the matter that had been dealt with before:
howbeeit not without cause does Job repeat it. For although Gods works be
before our eyes: yet is it hard to come too the consideration of them: and when
we are com to it, we That both he that deceyueth, and be that is deceived,
are both in Gods hand. Ye see here a thing that seems against all reason,
namely that God has the deceyuers in his hand, and that he drives them
thereunto. This seems to be a point utterly repugnant to his nature. Job the^
has purposely used this preface, as it were to bridle us, that we should not
r^sh headlong against God: and that although we be troubled with some
temptations at the first brunt: yet notwithstanding we might be restreyned,
perceive them to be so ignorant and dulheaded? Although they make a great
show, (for they have neither judgment nor discretion in deed) and although
men have them in estimation whether it be in way of scorn or otherwise: yet is
it to be seen that they be as dull beasts as can be. Why blame they not God
for not giving them a fyner wit? and for not giving them the mean to profit
better in his school? For they seem to themselves to be the worthiest men in
the world* and yet has God given them over. Why do they not blame him for not
handling the^ men, and raises up deceivers to beguile them, so as false
doctrines, abuses and heresies have their full scope, and God gives Sata^ful
power to punish our sins. Furthermore a man might move yet many other
questions. How? Is it possible that God should serve his own turn by Satan?
There is nothing but malice and naughtiness in him: And besides that look
upon a wicked man that has none other intent but to overthrow all goodness
and to destroy it: and yet he does it and brings it to pass: Seems it not
that he is acquit, because his service has Man, Man) is enough too stop the
mouths of all such as lift up themselves in that wise against God. For under
the word Man is comprehended so much wretchedness as we ought not only to cast
down our heads, but also (if the earth could open) we should be swallowed into
the bottomless pit, when we have this diuelishe pride in us of lifting up our
selves against God. Moreover let us mark that this doctrine brings us
great comfort, if so be that we can apply the same too our use. When it is
said that both the deceivers and the deceived belong unto God: thereby we
understand that God bridleth Satan and all deceyuers, so as we cannot,
(without his will,) be troubled with false doctrine, nor with heresies, nor
with any other darnell that serves too turn us aside from the pureness of
the Gospel. And why? For God holds the deceyuers in his hand: yea even from
Satan who is their head, unto all the^ that serve his turn. Seeing that God
holds them so in his hand, it is certain that they can attempt nothing
farther than he gives them the bridle. And although they attempt, yet have
they no advantage over us, because that those which are deceived are likewise
in the hand of God too. Now seeing we be in his hand, let us refer our selves
unto him, and he will not suffer us to be of the number of those whom Satan
overthrows: but we shall always get the upper hand of the lies which he shall
trump in our ways. Lo how we ought to practice this doctrine: not in murmuring
against God, nor in desiring to make a fond she we and foolish bravery to say,
Tush I will dispute against all this, and if a man cannot yield me a reason of
it, I will never bow. Let us beware of making such brags: and (as I have
said) let us rather humble our selves to honor that thing with all reverence,
which we know not. And although we see things so confuzed in the world, as
there remains nothing for us but to fall into destruction: let us not be
afraid, but forasmuch as God governs all things, and has sovereign dominion
over all creatures: let us warrant our selves in that. For God can well enough
disappoint the policy of our deadly enemy Satan, and all the crafts and
deceits of men, so as we shall have the upper hand. On the otherside, although
God list too afflict us, and suffer heresies to run abroad, so as many troubles
ensue, and we see all things confounded in this world: yet can he full well
preserve us that we shall not miscarie. For it is he that must give Satan's
error effect: if he do it not, we be senced well enough: and (as our Lord Jesus
Christ faith) it is impossible that ever the chosen should be turned out of
the way of salvation. Seeing the^ that the case stands so, let us put our
selves into gods protection, and for so much as it pleases him to commit the
charge of our welfare to our Lord Jesus Christ: let us content our selves
therewith, let us be at rest, and let us not be tossed with unquietness to say,
how shall we escape? we be in danger of undoing. True it is, that we ought to
stand upon our guard, and be careful to call upon God: but when we

But let us cast our selves down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us perceive what manner of
ones we be, and what our rudeness and brutishness is: to the end we may learn
to humble our selves under him, and to glorify him in all caces, and to walk
after such sort in his fear, as we may think all to be good and rightful
whatsoever he disposes of us and of all other creatures. And so let us all
say, Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The.xlviij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xij. Chapter.
17 He puts Counselors to the spoil, and makes Judges dull vvitted.

18 He loozeneth the band of kings, and girdeth their reins with girdles.

19 He puts princes to the spoil, and distresseth the mighty.

20 He takes away speech from the faithful, he takes away courage from
Princes.

21 He pours out contempt upon the noble, hetaketh away strength from the
mighty.

22 He brings hidden things to light, and the shadovv of death unto open
light.

23 He increases people and destroys them: he enlarges nations and
streitneth them.

24 He takes away the hearts of the governors of the earth, and makes them
wander as in a wilderness.

25 He makes them to grope as in the dark without light, and he makes them
to reele like drunken men.


LIke as yesterday we saw that god has in his hand both the deceyuers that God
puts the princes, the strong men, and the men of might to the spoil, and
that he vntieth their band, so as there is no more subjection to them, their
alliances are nothing worth, when they have their sword by their side it shall
fall to the ground: and (to be short) the means which the Princes of the
earth have, shall not serve the^ to any purpose when God lists to pull the^
down. Job therefore stands upon that point, because [that on the one side]
there is such a laziness in us, and that on the otherside he sees, we be so
blind in the thing which we ought to consider most of all. For although we do
partly know it to be gods doings when such chaunges happen: yet cannot the same
sink in our minds after such manner as Job speaks of: and although we have well
bethought us of it, yet can we not make our profit of it. Nevertheless it
behooves us to know that if God do so govern the cheef states of the world,
his arm is also stretched out to the lesser things, so as nothing escapes
him: Lo what we have to mark in effect. But (as I have said) when the cheef
states be changed, every man will be moved, but anon after we will think no
more of it. And indeed we see the stories are full of that which is contained
here: and yet the world fares not so much the better thereby, as to be so
persuaded as it ought to be, of gods providence, and that he has sovereign
dominion over all things. This thing was never yet thoroughly well known. And
what has bin the let of it but our own blockishnesse? For let us mark well
that God delights not to change, as men imagine the wheel of fortune, nor
as heathenishe folk say, that God plays with men, as a man tosseth the
balls at a tenisplay. It is not so: but these chaunges happen because me
cannot suffer God to continue his grace toward them. When all things are
settled in good plight: behold, that be pours out reproach upon them. Here
are three things* whereof two are visible in mainteyning of princes, and the
third is secret. The two visible things are Force and wisdom, ye see a king
reigns: and whence has he that authority? If he be wise, or if he have
skillful counselors so as things be well guided, and that they advise him in
his affairs and lay for them aforehand: behold that is one mean. The other
is, when a king has men and great furniture of war, is well alyed, and has
strong holds in his country. Thus ye see the two things that we perceive that
God will pour out contempt and reproach upon those that have bin noble, and
whom men have reverenced, so as God will make them a laughing stock, insomuch
that men shall flout them, and make none account of them. Why so? Because it
belongs to him to set up, and to pull down. Therefore let us mark well the
well appointed as to do any thing of our own wit and reason. For God is able
to bereeue us of all. True it is that now and then God will leave men wit and
reason, and yet in the mean while it shall take none effect, as we see in the
example of Achitophell. God suffers him to be always a man of great advice
as he was in deed, and there was great policy in the counsel that he gave to
Absalom. Well then, ye see that Achitophell had a very politic wit of his
own, and God abated it not a whit, and yet he brought not his enterprise to
pass. And why? For God Making them too grope as in the dark, in such wise as
they be both blind and drunken, That God pours out reproach also upon such
as were noble before, and which were had in reverence and honor, upon them
will God spread out contempt, and then shall they be so full of shame, as men
shall scoff at them, and they shall have no reputation any more. Hereby we be
taught, that although we have all stop them. So then must not every of us
needs crouch when we see that God smyteth whole nations after that sort? But
first of all it stands us in hand to be thoroughly persuaded of that which is
contained here. For how shall we else take instruction by that which I have
laid forth? let us assure our selves that when the Lord shall have multiplied a
people, he can well diminish them again to less than nothing. And when there
happen any great alterations in a Realm, let us assure our selves that the
same comes not to pass by hap hazard, but that God is the worker That God
brings the darkness into light, yea even the darkness: hat is as dark as
death: that is to say, which is as the darkness of Hell: the same will he
bring to light when he lysteth. Here Job expresserh what his meening is:
namely to rehearce unto us those works of God which are most famous. For if
he should speak of common and ordinary works: we would be as it were a
sleep, and it would not touch us a whit, as I have declared already.
Therefore we must be warned in such sort, as our wits may be astonished at
it, yea and as we may be quickened up, how lazy or dullminded so ever we be.
Thus ye see what Job meant by saying that God will bring the darkness of death
unto light. He might well have said, God makes his sun to shine every day:
we see how the night has his course, and the day succeeds. Lo here is a
great and wonderful change. Job might have spoken so. But forasmuch as that
is an ordinary thing among us: we pass not of it. Therefore he intended to
touch the extraordinary things, as if he had said: God makes such
alterations, as if Hell were advanced up aloft, or as if death were set up on
high for men to behold. Now when darkness changes so into light, it is a
strange fashion, and such a one as never was looked for. But thereby God
wakeneth us up and gives us cause too think better upon his power than we
have erst done. So then let us remember this lesson well. But we be never the
better for all the instructions that god gives us from day to day: yea and
although he work such miracles as ought to move us thoroughly when we do but
think upon them: yet are we no whit touched with them. Wherefore he must be
feign too work after another fashion, and too cry out aloude, We be like as
when a man is laid in his bed and fallen fast asleep: a thousand things may
be spoken to him which he hears not: folk may talk and discourse of many
matters, and he that is asleep shall know never a whit of it. But if one make
a great noise, then ye shall see him wake, and a man cannot speak so softly
but he will hear what is said. So stands the case with us. For God shows
us many things that ought too serve for our instruction: but we have our
eyesshet: he speaks to us, but we hear nothing. And why? Because we be
asleep. And therefore he must be feign to make a great noise to waken us, to
the end we may think so much the better upon his providence, and acknowledge
that it is God that wakeneth us, therefore it is not now for us to be
sluggishe, so as we should not have regard of him to profit our selves by the
judgments that he shows us. Wherefore let us advisedly shroud us under his
protection, doubting not but that inasmuch as he has all creatures in his
hand, (yea even unto the little sparrowes, which are of small value and
estimation) he will never forget us: not only for so much as we be his creatures
sashioned after his own image: but also because we be his children, according
as he has adopted us by our Lord Jesus Christ.

But let us fall down before the presence of our good God, with acknowledgem^t
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them better, that we may abhor
them, and condemn this flouthfulnesse which is in us and in all our senses:
and to inlighten us by his holy spirit, because we be blind, even in the
lighsommest and manifestest things. Therefore [let us pray him] to open our eyes
in such sort as we may behold the great secrets of his heavenly kingdom: yea
and that we may behold his majesty so far forth as is expedient for out
welfare (according also as he she weth himself to us by the means of our Lord
Jesus Christ) until we may come to the full and perfect sight of it, which
shall be at the last day, when we shall see him face to face in such wise as it
shall be fully fashioned like unto his glory. That it may please him to grant
this grace not only to us, but also to all people and nations, etc.

The.xlix. Sermon which is the first upon the thirtenth Chapter.
1 BEhold, mine eye has seen all these things, mine ear has heard and
understood them.

2 I know as much as you: I am not inferior to you.

3 But I will speak unto God, and reason with him.

4 Ye be forgers of lies, and Physicians of no value.

5 O that you would hold your tungs, and that should be counted to you for
wisdom.

6 Hear my discourse, and understand what I debate.

7 Need you to allege iniquity in Gods defense, and to speak untruth for
his sake?

8 Will ye pleasure him? will ye plead his case?

9 Is it good that he should allow you? and that you should usurp upon him
as upon a man?

10 He will reprove you if you favor him in secret.


IT is a very evil thing when every of us will set out himself and will not
be inferior to his companion. For when we have this sonde desire to seem and
to be counted wise, it is possible that the same shall engender much strife
among us, as S. Paul also speaks of it. This vayngloriousnesle is the Sea
and welspring of all debate. For men shall never I understand as much as you
(says he) I am not inferior, mine ear has heard these things, mine eyes
has seen them. It seems here that Job would have more reputation of
wisdom and skilfulnesse than those three to whom he spoke. But he was not
led with desire of praise, his doing so is glozings without any holiness. S.
Paul then perceiving this, tells them. No no, If these manner of men purchase
themselves estimation by those means: I may so do as well as they, but I will
not: for that is not the thing wherein we must be esteemed: according as he
concludes in the end, that if any man will be counted to be of Gods church, he
must become a new creature. Ye see then (says he) that the estimation is to
be had at Gods hand, and not by these braueries wherewith men's heads are buzied.
Nevertheless, S. Paul (as we see) meant to show, that he was not Ye are
(says he) forgers of lies, and pelting Physicians, and I would feign that
ye should all of you hold your tungs: for that were most wisdom for you.
When Job calls them forgers of lies which had spoken before, we see strayte
ways too what purpose he says it. Now let us take the saying that is
added, namely that they be pelting Phisitio^s. Why so? Because they misapplye
their medicines as we have seen. It has been told you already that the
doctrine which has been set down by these men, was good and false,
notwithstanding that these men take them and derive them from a true ground.
And so ye see wherefore Job calls them pelting Physicians. This streyne then
warns us to pray God to give us wisdom, that we may take the holy Scripture
to such end as it perteyneth, and that we may have the discretion to apply it
in such wise as we may do good with it, and that it be not pulled too and
fro by the top (as they say) according as many men abuse it. Furthermore
when we take in hand to teach our neighbors: let us consider well what that
he would feign that his friends would hold their peace, that they might be
counted wise men: it agrees with the common Proverb that Solomon uses,
which is, that a fool may That he will nevertheless talk with God, and
that he will reason against him: but he blames those that had gone about to
overcome him by their disputations* as who should say they would speak in
the defense of God. Think ye (says he) that God has need of your
leazings? or that you should come here to be his proctours and advocates?
has he need that men should defend him after such a fashion? Think you
that this shall avail you when he comes to try you? ye must be overwhelmed
by him for all your pretense of desirousnesse too justify him. He will show
that he abhors such dealings, and that he will be mainteyned by his own
righteousness, without borrowing of any means to be acquitted at men's
hands, and without borrowing of their leazings, and of the excuses that they
shall have forged. Whereas Job says he will talk with God and dispute
against him: verily there is some excuse in that saying: but let us also
mark the good that is in it, that we may discern it from the evil. Behold
the good that is in this saying of Jobs, is that he will turn away from men.
And why? For they with whom he had too do perceived not the spiritual
battle that he had in himself, and that he could have found in his heart too
have endured a hundred times more, so be it that God had sweetened his stripes
with such comfort, as he might have known that God is favorable to me, and
he will never fail me. Had Job been thoroughly persuaded of that, and that God
had hylde him by his mighty hand: no doubt but he had been ready to have
iudured a hundred times more. How be it forasmuch as he perceived perceived
nothing in God but rigor, so as it seemed that be will talk with God: that
is too say, that he will shrink into himself, and that being so gathered
close in secret, he will hold himself there. For men take these words at
randon and wrest them as they list themselves: but God knows well enough too
what end his speaking tends. Mark this for a special point. And further
have no reason in them. For example: if we see great stumblings, and that the
wicked have their full scope, and that God provide not for the good, but
suffers them to be afflicted without giving them any ease: by and by we say,
How now? God has declared that he will aid those that call upon him, and we
see the clean contrary. We cease not too have recourse unto him, and yet is
he as it were deaf for any prayers that we offer unto him. Again he has
promised to defend his Church, and behold how it is left up to the spoil. We
see that horrible that those which had spoken mente too currye favor with
God, when we would support a mortal man: for the Hebrew word that is set
here, signifies to like or accept ones face or person. What is the cause
that we accept persons in matters of judgment here in this world? Though a man
have an evil case, yet if he be our kinsman or freende, if he be commended
unto us, if we may look for any profit at his hand, or if he be in
authority: well, we be moved with such a fleshly regard toward him, and we
be so carried away with it, as the case of the party is nothing with us, but
the favor of Face or Person, is referred to the outward things that may
serve to incline our minds either to the loving or to the hating of any man.
Thus then does Job speak: It seems to you that God has need of your help
too supporte him, as a mortal man that has an evil case. And truly if one
be minded to show him favor, he will say, he is my kinsman, he is my
freende, he is commended to me, he has pleasured me, or he will pleasure me.
Hereupon he disguiseth things after such a sort, as he proceeds no more by
right as it were mirrours of his vengeance: when men speak after that manner,
it is according too the Scripture. But now, behold how the malicious sort
do ranckle and spewe out their blasphemies against God: yea, (say they) and if
he chooze whom he lists, then is he an accepter of persons. Why does he
chooze the one rather than the other? Verily as who should say, that God
regarded our fair eyes in choozing of us, and that the cause sprang not in
himself, that is too say, in his own mere goodness. But ye see how men
are always desirous too

But now let us cast our selves down before the presence our good God with
acknowledgemente of our sins, praying him to humble us in such wise, that
being convicted of offending him diverse ways, we may seek nothing but his
favor: and that if he afflict us for a time, and use such rigor as may seem
excessive unto us, yet we may still keep our mouth shet, waiting pacientlie
till he deliver us from all our troubles: and that in the mean season we may
give him his due glory, acknowledging the authority which he has over us and
all creatures. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us, but
also to all people and Nations, etc.

The.l. Sermon, which is the second upon the thirtenth Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the vij. viij. ix. and.x. verses, and then as
follows.

11 Does not his Majesty amaze you? does not the fear of him fall upon you?

12 Your remembrance is like unto ashes, and your bodies to bodies of clay.

13 Hold your tungs in my pesence, and let me speak, and let happen too
me what can?

14 Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my soul into my
hands?

15 Although he kill me, yet will I trust in him: nevertheless I will
reprove my vvayes in his sight.


WE have to go forward with the matter that we began yesterday: which is, that
the scripture shows us many things which our understanding cannot brook.
Then let us mark well how it is said here, that when we shall have sought
all the corners of our wit to color that which men would else reject and
condemn, to the intent that there might be no article in all the holy
Scripture, that might be misliked: God will condemn us for such sophistical
inventions. This extends yet further. For we see how many there are at this
day that would feign be meddling to make a mean betwixt us and the Papists.
Verily (say they) it is true that there be many abuses in the Church, (they
confess all) and things are Interim. What has been the cause to bring us
this Diuelishnesse, but only that they which were the deuisers of it, were
desirous to play the Alchimistes or multipliers, and to find out a new
Quintessence and I wot not what? For they have been sufficiently co^uicted,
that in Popery there is nothing but horrible confuzion, and that all things
are ouerfarre out of order. The idolatry there is as gross as may be: the
serving of God is utterly defaced, we see that men put Does not his Majesty
amaze you, and does not his fear fall upon you, (says Job?) And afterward he
adds, That their memorial is like Ashes, and their bodies are as a body of
Clay. Hereby he meneth that when we lie in Gods behalf, it is as much too
say as we conceive not his Majesty, and that we would make him like our
selves, and pull him down hither, as if we were hayle fellow well met with
him. Behold (I pray you) what drives men. Why are they so shameless in
falsifying Gods truth? Because they would measure it by their own spanne. And
what an odds is there betwixt God and us? Then let us learn to conceive what
manner of one the Majesty of God is. And thereupon let us be no more so
foolish, as to desire to incroch any thing either upon his word, or upon his
judgments. Let us look down with our heads, and let God say what it
pleases him. And when we have heard his word, let him also do what he
thinks good, and let us honor him in all his works, specially when we
enter into the consideration of our own feebleness and frayltie, too say,
what are we? Thus ye see the two things that Job compares together here.
First he says, Does not the Majesty of God amaze you? When he speaks of
Majesty or dignity, he shows that men ought to be somewhat better advised
when they talk of God. But what? We step to it bluntly, and it seems to
us that God will suffer men to play with him, as he adds immediatelye after.
Therefore when we speak of God, let us learn to conceive the infinite glory
that is in him. For when we have once conceived that: it cannot be but we
must be humbled to say, Alas, it is no speaking of God after the manner of
men, nor making of any comparison with him. For what should be made of him*
where would we set him? or in what degree would we place him. VVoulde we
have him matched with his creatures? Is not that as much as too make him a
thing of nothing? And what shall become of his majesty when men have abaced him
after that sort* Then if we had the wit to conceive or but only to taste what
Gods infinite glory is: it is Job says, Hold your tongues before me, I will
speak: and let befall me what can. Here Job shows that he is not like
these babblers, that skirmishe with Gods word, and with his judgments, how
be it aloof from handestrokes: According as ye shall see some have their
tungs well fyled to talk: but that shall be but only to debate of trifling
questions far off from pracize. But Job shows himself to be none of those.
And why so? You see (says he) how I carry my flesh between my teeth, as if
I were torn all to pieces, and that I were feign to take up I have my soul
(says he) between my hands. Since you see me in such plight, think not
you that I prate like a Popiniay in a Cage. No, no: I am forced to speak from
the heart. For God examineth me by holding me as it were upon the rack. Then
must I needs utter my affections plainly. For as for me I speak as one
that has experience, and God tries me after such a manner, as it is well
seen I have no leisure to color matters, and to speak one thing for another.
Therefore let me speak. For ye that he holds his flesh between his teethe
to carry it. For he was as it were rent he holds his soul (or his life)
between his hands: it is as much to say, as the same was in utter hazard,
and as it were abandoned and left up to the spoil. And herein a man may see
the doltishnesse of the Papists, in that they have surmyzed that too hold
ones soul between his hands, signified too have power too do good or evil.
Let men deuize what they list (say they) I have my soul in mine own hands,
that is to say, I can do what I think good, I have a free state. To be
short, they meant to build their free will upon this sentence, I have ray
soul between my hands. But we know that when God threatens men, if he tell
them he will leave them in their own hand: it is the sorest scourge that can
light upon them. Behold, God thundereth at us when he says he will leave us
up in our own hand. plague, till he had sent him to the bottom of death and
damnation. Seeing then that Job was laid at so roughly: let us not think it
strange that there were some temptations out of square in him. For it was
meet that God should in that point utter the perfectness of his own
strength in the infirmity of man. But let us on our side apply this too our
instruction. And first of all, if God send us so great and excessive
afflictions as we be in manner swallowrd up: let not that make us too despair
(as shall be declared yet more at full hereafter) but let That although God
kill him, yet will be trust in him: nevertheless he will reprove his own
wa^es before Gods presence. True it is that the Hebrewe word Lo, (which I
translate In him) may be taken for Not, and so Not: it must be in way of
demannding a question, as thus: Though he kill me, shall I not trust in him?
Yes, I will still trust in him. Or else [if ye read] though he kill me.
When he shall have killed me, yet will I put my trust in him: we see that
the substance and therewithal has given me leave to come unto him. Therefore
must I call upon him, put my self intoo his keeping, and not doubt but he
will always be merciful unto me. Yea but he scourges me, and when I am in
mind to come near him, I shall not perceive that he has heard me. Verily this
conceit is hard and combersome to bear: but yet must I tarry the leisure of my
God with patience, and do him the honor to rest my self upon his promises. Lo
how the faithful are fully resolved in that point. But on the otherside, it
behooves them to know Reprove, and also to Debate, or Plead. So then his
saying and protestation is, that he is trust in God continually: he shows
that he is not as one of these stragglers that make outleaps, because they be
desirous to play the horses that are broken looce. It is clean contrary
(says he:) for I desire Behold, yet must I reason with God concerning my
ways: that is to say, the hope that I have is not such as is utterly unmingled
with complaints, so as I should not lift up my self nor murmr against God
at all. True it is that this proceeds of infirmity, yea even of sinful
infirmity worthy to be condemned. But how so ever the case stand, God
lets him not go altogether. For as I said before, faith ouerruleth our
affections. When we trust in God, and call upon him, it is not as much to
say as we should never have any bickerings in our selves. But faith must get
the upper hand, the peace whereof S. Paul speaks must win the victory:
that is to say, it must get the maistrie in our hearts. In that he speaks of
the peace of God, and attributes victory unto it, he shows well that we shall
have turmoylings in us, and that we shall be tossed to and fro. But what
remedy is there for it? This peace of God must be of such power as it may get
the maistrie in the end, and all our passions be brought in awe of it. Then let
us mark well, that in protesting that he will trust in God, Job does also
confess his own infirmity, and show that he is not so perfect but that there
is always some fault to be found in him. But yet nevertheless he flees
always to God for refuge. Since the case stands so, let us also on our side
understand that when we be shaken with the prouocations of our flesh, and our
own affections do somewhat carry us away: we must not therefore despair, nor
imagine that God will help us no more. But let us pluck up our hearts to
trust in him, and although we do it not so perfectly as were requisite, yet
let us be sure that he will make us to feel that our waiting upon him is not
in vain. For he will strengthen us continually more and more in faith, and
make the same to get the upper hand of all the temptations of the world and of
this present life.

But let us fall down in the presence of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him too make us feel them in such wise, as being
ashamed of them in our selves, we may labor to have our recourse to him and
to his mercy: And that it may please him not only to forgive us our faults
that are past* but also to rid us out of the miseries wherein we be: that being
received into his protection and custody, we may never slip from him, and
that howsoever Satan practice against us, he nevertheless will be always
so at hand, as we may ever have wherewith too beat back the assaults that
our mortal enemy makes upon us. That it may please him to grant this grace,
not only to us, but also to all people and nations of the earth, bringing
back all poor ignorant souls, etc.

The.lj. Sermon, which is the third upon the thirtenth Chapter.
16 He will yet still be my help: and the hypocrite shall not come before his
face.

17 Harken to my words, and mark what I shall tell you.

18 When I shall have set down my case, I know I shall be justified.

19 Who will plead against me? For if I hold my peace I am undone.

20 Only grant me these two things, and then will I not hyde my self from
thy sight.

21 Withdraw thy hand from me, and let not thy wrath make me afraid.

22 And [then] if thou speak, I will answer: or else I will speak, and
answer thou.


WE have seen already the protestation that Job made: that is to wit, that
he would still trust in God, even when he were overwhelmed by his hand. And
(as I said) that was to show how he had a deeper conceyte and feeling of
Gods judgment than men commonly have: according whereunto he knew that there
was a double ryghtuousnesse in God. Now he confirms and ratifieth the same
matter that God will be his help: yea: For the hypocrite (says he) shall
not come before him. As if he should say, I know that I present my self
before God, and therefore I am sure that after he has handled me so hardly,
and afflicted me with extremity, he will still show himself to be my Savior.
Whereupon then does Job ground the hope of his welfare? Upon that he dares
approach unto God. True it is that the hypocrites do also approach unto God,
according as it is said in the eight and fiftith of Esaias, This people seeks
me day by day, Hearken ye to me (says he) and receive my words: for when I
shall have set down my case, I know I shall be justified. Here Job
presupposes that he has so good reasons to defend himself withal, that he
shall be quitte before God if he may have leave to plead his case. And he
pleads not before men, (for he had to deal with deaf ears) but he would
have those to whom he speaks to hold their peace, and to hear what he
shall debate, and too wait for the end and issue of that which shall be
uttered of God. We see then what the sum of his intent is: that is to wit,
he meant to say that he should be quit, if he might have leave and liberty to
debate his case. And whereupon depends this? We must call to mind, what
has been declared before, that is to wit, the two sorts of Gods
righteousness: That God will sometimes judge men by his law: for there he
has given us a ryghtuousnesse which is throughlye known and apparent unto
us. God does as it were enter into covenant with us, when he gives us this
rule: mark how I will have men to live, he that does not all these things,
cursed be he: and who so ever performs my law, shall live. Seeing then that
our Lord has so certifyed us of his will, he has showed us a righteousness
that is altogether apparent. But if he should judge us thereafter, we should be
feign to enter into an account, and to to examine our life by every
commandment, and too think with our selves, Go too, wherein have thou done
amiss? Behold, thy God requires such a thing: have thou him, and therefore he
says, it is no marvel though he be so troubled, and as it were swallowed up
of despair, seeing that God persecuteth him after that fashion without showing
him why. Job then is as it were astonished in such sort as he has not an eye to
that which he knows to be true, namely that God can well make him too feel
his sins when he examineth him but only according to his law: but he
considers that in as much as God pardons his servants that walk in
soundness, it is a strange thing that he having done so, yea even with all
That God should call him. That is to say, that his case might be laid forth
orderly, as when rigor ceasseth, and men deal by order of law. Well (says
he) let the action be commenced, and I will no more hide me from thy sight:
that is to say, I will not refuse any thing whatsoever it be: dispose of me as
it shall please thee, and I will be pacient, and obey thee in all points. We
see then that Job is excessive as a man out of his wits. Why so? For had
he looked well to himself, it is certain that he should have known that he
had not aught shall be impossible for us to have either reason, modesty,
stay, or measure at all. And well ought we to consider this, that we may quake
at it. Yea, but our quaking must be such as the terror of it may not continue
in us, but that we may come to the remedy of it: that is to wit* we must pray
unto God to grant us the grace to find rest in him in the mids of our
troubles, and that we may be sure of it, notwithstanding that for a time he
make countenance to set himself against us, to destroy us utterly. Lo how we
have need to pray unto God Grant me these two things, and I wilcome with my
head bolt upright, and I will not hide my self before thee: Let us mark that
it is not for us to summon god in desiring him that he should not punish us
before he have made us to understand our sins. And why? For it were to great
an intruding upon his jurisdiction. Shall the wretched offender appoint his
judge what to do? True it is that an earthly judge may be ouerrigorous (for a
man may be pressed too cruelly:) but it cannot be so between God and us: for
That he will speak first if God give him leave to speak, or else he will
answer when God has begone to speak. Here Job makes not his request to the
end aforesaid, that is to wit, to pray God to moderate his rigor, and yet
notwithstanding too make us too perceive our faults, and that when he has
brought us to such lowliness as we can become our own judges, then every one
of us may willingly pass under condemnation. But Jobs intent here is into
enter into a clean contrary case. We see then wherein he fails: and this
is showed us to the entente we should follow the measure that I have spoken
of already. Now we see the profit that redoundeth too us by this doctrine,
if we can apply it well too our use: that is too wit, that when we desire
too be heard at Gods hand, the same must not be too bring excuses as though
we were not faulty, and that we could lessen our offenses, or rather make
them none at all: but it must be too enter intoo the knowledge of them, yea
and to enter in such wise as we may be utterly thrown down, and there may
be none other shift for us but to flee unto Gods goodness: and that when we
shall have condemned our whole life, we may notwithstanding not cease to
trust in the mercy which he has promised to wretched sinners, when they
mislike of their sins and condemn them, desyring nothing but that God should
receive them to mercy. Ye see then in what wise we ought to practice this
said request. But it is hard for us to attain to such reason, and therefore
we must streyne our selves to it. For this hardness must not put us out of
heart, but rather provoke us too run unto God, praying him of his grace too
touch us in such wise with his doctrine, as by the means of his word we
may offer up such requests unto him as we may feel in the fruit of them.
Our faults are told us daily, and yet there are few that think upon them.
God therefore perceiving us to be so slow, yea even in such sort as he is not
able to move us by his word: lifts up his hand, and sends us some
chastizements. And because that if the affliction be but small, it is nothing
to us, we do but shake our ear at it as the proverb says: God doubleth his
stripes, and scourges us more and more, holding our nozes to the gryndstone
(as they say,) and withdrawing himself from us, so as his spirit is as it
were quenched in us, and we feel not that he governs us any more, in so
much that we become poor desperate souls, and cry out alas, what is this?
Afterward we become so enraged that we would feign have God to give us some
release, and if he give us it not, ye shall see us utterly past our selves,
so as there is no remedy in our state. Then may we well desire God his
goodness and mercy, that although it seem that we should be confounded, yet
we may not cease to rejoice, and to rest ourselves upon his goodness, that
we may glory in him even in the mids of our afflictions.

But let us cast our selves down before the sight of our good God with
acknowledgment of our sins, praying him to make us perceive them better, and
to make all men foreward and willing to come yield themselves unto him: and
that when we shall appear before his judgment seat, we may not come with
other condition than

The.lij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xiij. Chapter.
23 How many si^nes and iniquities have I^shevv me my misdeede and my
transgression.

24 Why do thou hide thy face, and take me for thine enemy?

25 Do not thou follovv after a broken leaf? do not thou persecute dry
stubble?

26 Thou vvritest bitterness against me, and make me to possess the sins
of my youth.

27 Thou lockest my feet in the stocks that I cannot escape, and thou printest
them in the soles of my feeete.

28 So shall he rotte as an old tree and as a garment that is motheaten.


Heretofore Job declared a thing that is very true, as I touched yesterday:
which is, that when God scourges us, and we see no reason why, if we should
go to law with him, for every point Show me my misdeedes and mine iniquities,
how much I have sinned and transgressed. True it is that here he confesses,
that for so much as he is scourged by Gods hand, it behooves him to humble
himself: howbeit that he cannot patiently endure that God should uoked
through presumption and malapertnesse to dispute against God. Thus then ye see
good things. But yet therwithall men must have a stay of themselves, when they
perceive that God punishes them, and they know not wherefore. I say they must
be quietminded and tarry till God discover that thing unto them which as yet
is concealed. In this point Job failed. But let us consider that he was
forepossessed with the grief that he endured, so greatly as it is not to be
wondered at, though he were astonished and desired God to handle him at
leastwise according Sin alone, to say, Show me how many sins I have, but
adds Iniquities, transgressions, and misdeedes. to what purpose does he
that? It is all one as if he should say, when God Ordinances, Statutes,
Decrees, judgments, and such other like: for there are a seven or eight
words that import all one thing. And why is that? First and foremost his
meening is to show, that if we walk not rightly we cannot allege
ignorance. Why so? For he gives us full instruction how we ought to live.
Those therefore that go astray make no reckening of obeying God. What is the
reason? If we would study his which he punished him. For it is certain (as
we have seen already) that God had not respect unto his sins how great
they were: but meant too prove his patience. Lo why he scourged him. But that
we may take the more profit of this doctrine, let us mark first, that if God
list to use rigor toward us, it is certain that for any one sin he may
punish us in such wise, as we shall not know where to become, and yet he
shall do us no wrong. Then of much more likelyhod, if he listed to punish us
for all our sins, there should be no end. And Wherefore hidest thou thy
face, and esteemest me as thine enemy? Is not that a following of a leaf that
is already broken? is it not a perfecuting of stubble that is already withered?
Here Job alleges his own frailty too get some ease of his afflictions, and
some asswagement of his sores, as he has used to do heretofore and will do
again hereafter. And this manner of praying is good and holy, when it
proceeds of those causes as we see the faithful have done.

And indeed here ye see what we have to bring unto God, when we would obtain
favor at his hand to deliver us from our miseries and succoure us: which is,
too lay our feebleness before him. Whereas fools allege their own
worthiness, and go about too bind God unto them: we can say nothing, but
that we be wretched. How shall we then obtain mercy? Even by saying, Alas
Lord, consider what we be, thou must be feign to have pity of us because we
be thy creatures. When a man alleges, Alas there is nothing but filthiness
in my body, Lord if thou take away thy strength, behold I am brought to
naught: and as for my soul, what has it? it is but a little breath, and if
that thou also withdraw thy breath (that is to say, the power that thou have
given me) I am thencefoorth nothing. And furthermore there is so much
ignorance, such store of vices, and so many wantes in it, as is a wonder to
see. Alas my God, when thou see that I am so full of miseries, perceyuest
thou not how there is matter for thy mercy to work upon?

We see then that when we be desirous too obtain favor at Gods hand,
we must take the same way that Job does here: Howbeit so as it be with
another mind. For Job was driven with too strong a vehemency, because he was
weerie too be so pressed by the hand of God, and thereupon he fretted
himself. We must not do so: but our laying forth of our myseries before
God must be to the end he may be inclined to pity us. And the holy
scripture is full of such texts where the faithful say. Alas Lord what is
man? Behold, David says, Seeing that my life is but a breath that passes away
without returning, Lord, will not thou have pity upon us to succoure us,
seeing thou perceyuest us to be so frail? And that God hears such requests,
it appears by other texts [as by this:] he remembered that they were but
flesh, a breath that passes and returns not again. Ye see then ho(...) God
witnesses that when he showed mercy to the children of Israel, and dealt
not with them according to their deserts: it was because he saw they were but
flesh, and that there was nothing but corruption in them, and therefore he
bare with them. Seeing then that Gods will is such as to spare us in
consideration of the wretchedness that is in us: it is certain that we may
and ought to allege that point unto him, when we intend to obtain mercy at
his hand. Therefore let us mark well that the words which Job uses are
lawful for us, and that the same is a good form of praying unto God, so be it
that we go to him with humility, and say, Lord, consider what I am, for I am
as a leaf, yea even as a leaf that is already withered, and yet go thou
about to wipe me out and to ouerwhelme me utterly: and who am I? I am as
stubble that is already dry, or as grass that is already cut down: there is
no more life nor substance in me: alas my God, if thou persecute me moreover,
what shall become of me? If we speak after this manner, God will accept such
complaints. Not when we come to him with such pride as if he were bound unto
us: but when we lay our miseries That God holds him locked up as in a pair
of stocks: and therewithal he says also, that God writes bitterness
against him, and makes him to possess all the sins of his youth: thou
lockest me in the stocks says he. And why is that? He says that God
shows nothing but signs of wrath against him. And forasmuch as sentences are
oftentimes given by writing: Job having an eye to the common phrase of his
country, says, that God writes bitterness against him: that is to say, that
he charge him with the greeuousest crimes that could be devised: Like as a
judge that abhors a wretched offe^der which is before him, inhaunceth his
offenses, and goes about to show that they be so outrageouse as they cannot be
punished too rigorously. According hereunto, Job complayneth, that God writes
so ouerrigorous a sentence against him, as it is enough too make a man's hear
stand up stiff upon his head. And he adds further, that he renews the
remembrance of the sins of his youth, of purpose to make him possess them.
And what does this Making of him to possess them import? It is as much to
say, as I cold not be stripped out of my clothes, but I must also be as it
were bound. Like as when a man is in his house (for when he is abroad in the
feeldes, he is after a sort stripped out of his possessions) even so do
thou Lord make me to keep possession [of my sins.] That is to say, I cannot
be rid of this cursed and unhappy possession of my sins: I am so wrapped in
them, as I cannot get out of them. Here Job acknowledges that God has just
cause to scourge him: but yet for all that, he ceasseth not to be out of
patience and to chafe. And therefore so much the more ought we to stand upon
our guard, seeing that he which was the singular mirroure of patience was
nevertheless provoked too such temptations. But now let us come to know why
he speaks of the sins of his youth. There are two reasons: The one is,
because that in that age the lusts are seen to be whotest. And for that cause
also it is said in the Psalm, How shall a young man order his ways? even by
keeping thy word. Why Wherefore hydest thou thy face from me? But let us mark
that after God has hid his face away so for a season, he will show himself
graciouse and pitiful toward us: yea verily that God holds him in the
stocks, and that the soles of his feet (which he terms the roots of his
feet) are as it were printed in him. Ye see him (says he, he speaks of
himself in the third person) as a rotten tree, and as a motheaten garment: and
what shall betide then if thou list too pursue a rotten tree and a motheaten
garmente? We see yet better that which we spoke before concerning the
troublednesse that was in Job. For he had such a patience as yet
notwithstanding was shaken, yea and so shaken as he fretted and chafed against
God: which thing we see in that he complayneth that he is set in the stocks
and as it were locked up. But let us mark that as much at the least may be
fall us. For we have not profited so well in Gods school as this holy man had.
Therefore we may be tormented after such a sort in our afflictions, as our
impacience will bewray itself, although we have a true

Now let us kneel down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them better than we have done,
that we may be sorry for them, and therewithal run unto him, that he may
receive us for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake: And that although we deserve that
he should show himself a dreadful judge against us: yet nevertheless he
will shine upon us with a fatherly countenance, to draw us unto him, yea even
in such wise as it may be to have access too his goodness, with assured
trust that he will pity us: And that in the mean while he suffer us not too
quayle through the afflictions of this present life, but that we may fight
stoutly unto the end, even till he have taken us up into the everlasting rest
which he has prepared for us in heaven. That it may please him to grant this
grace not only to us but also to all people and Nations. etc.

The.liij. Sermon which is the first upon the fourtenth Chapter.
MAn borne of woman [is] of short time, and filled with many troubles.

2 He comes up as a flower, he is cut off, and flees as a shadovve, and has
no stay.

3 And thou come to set thine eyes upon such a one, to call me to the law.

4 Who can bring forth a clean thing out of uncleanness? There is not so
much as one.


WE saw yesterday how it is lawful for us to allege our own Man (says he)
has a short and transitory life. Mark that for one point. And that it is
so, he confirms it by similitudes. For he comes up as a flower (says he)
it is cut up, it withers, it is dried up, and it vanishes away as a shadow
that has no stay. We see then what the shortness of man's life is: it is
all one as a flower, which incontinently withers, or as a shadow which
passes and glydeth away. And yet for all that (says he) this life is also
full of trouble and unquietness, and for that small time which we live in this
world, we cease not to be vexed and stinged with store of hartgreefs, so as
we have no rest at all* so miserable is our state in itself, and in good sooth
we see it. Considering then the ought thou to cast thy look or thy
countenance upon a poor creature that is so transitory as it has nothing but
misery in it? And wherefore do thou bend thy self that way too catch me
in a trip? Am I a fit match for thee? We see that Job under pretense of his
infirmity would have shifted off God, that he should not have plaged him. Not
that he was fully resolved and concluded upon that point: but he shows us
what our affections are which torment us, and which we ought to resist, as he
also resisted them well. Howbeit in the mean while, he ceasseth not to bewray
how he was tossed with many evil thoughts, as every one of us finds by
experience in himself. And consequently he adds yet one sentence more. For
thereupon a man might reply, That God afflicts not men without cause,
forsomuchas they be sinners. And what can we do to it, says he? for we come
of a corrupt and evil lump, and how should we be pure and clean? No marvel
if we be full of soil. For from what spring issue we? To here Job speak,
it should seem that men ought to be excused because sin is in them by nature.
But so little ought this to ease our evil, that we are so much the more
faulty. As Soon as we enter into the world, we are already the enemies of
God, there is nothing but rebellion and naughtiness in us, there is nothing
but the seed of sin. Come we once to age, the mischief is increaced and
augmented, and there is not so much as one drop of goodness in us. Then let us
conclude that whereas men say [for their excuse,] that they are borne full of
filthiness: they ought so much the rather to be cursed and rejected of God.
Thus see we here yet one faulty affection more in Job, which is reported to
us by the holy ghost, to the end we may learn to profit our selves by it, when
we have considered what our nature is. But now forasmuch as in effect we
have Jobs meening, let us mark what instruction is contained in this sentence,
where he says, that man is of a short life: and yet in the mean while filled
with many troubles. Hereby we be instructed, first not to set our minds too
much upon

But for the better conceyuing of this shortness, we must also match it with
the troubles that are in it. For put case that our life were far longer: what
cause have we to like so well of it, seeing we be so vexed in it? Why do we
not rather come to the seeking of the rest that is prepared for us in heaven
And heerewithall we have further to mark, from whence these troubles come upon
us: that is to wit, from our own naughty affections. For if we were
troubled but by other folks and in the mean while were at rest in ourselves,
yea verily at true rest: we might well complain of our disquietnesse that this
present life had not his free course, and that it went not in his own who is
he that is pure, or how can that thing be clean which comes of uncleanness
or filthiness? By this saying we be admonished, that all the miseries which
we endure, proceed of the coruption of man's nature. And for the better
comprehending of this doctrine, let us note that when there is any speaking of
man, or of that which is in him, the question concerns not Gods work or
creation: for Adam was created another manner of one than we be at this day.
We be fallen from the state wherein God had set Adam and all mankind in blame
our selves after this sort, we shall not deal as those do that murmr against
God. How now say they? It is seen that men are as it were the chief work
of God among all his creatures, it was his will too show much more
excellency and dignity in them than in all the rest, and yet are they vexed
and troubled beyond all measure. And what ^meaneth that? Verily many heathenish
folk have herevpo^ taken occasion to murmr against God as who should say, he
had set man upon a scaffold to make a mockery and gazingstocke of him,
notwithstanding that he the peace of men consists. But in stead hereof it
seems that we will make war with God, to the end he should rise up
against us and make us feel what an enemy we have when he is feign to set
upon us. And therefore let every of us beware that he bridle his passions and
affections. For if we come like wild beasts to lift up our selves against our
God, must we not be worse than stark mad? Then let us bear well in mind what
is said here concerning the troublesomnesse of ma^s life: let us so think
upon it as it may serve to rule and correct our wicked lusts, that no man can
make that thing pure and clean which comes of uncleanness and filthiness:
let us mark well that here our Lord meant to send us to confusion, to the
intent we should not have aught whereof to boast, but only in him and of his
mere goodness. And it is requisite that men should be shamed after that sort,
because they blindfold their own eyes, and who is he that can make a pure and
clean thing to come out of uncleanness? thereby he shows that me^ are
stark mad when they bear themselves in hand that they be pure and clean.
The^ let us bear in mind, that as in respect of our selves, there remains
nothing for us but confusion and decay, because we be so ouerloden with sin
and vices, that God might rightly cast us away: and yet nevertheless that
for so much as he chalengeth to himself the office of washing and clensing us
from all our spots, we must resort to him for refuge, and specially because
he has given us our Lord Jesus Christ, who has al cleanness in him. God
seeing us de filed and stained, and that the way was ouerlo^g and high for us
to come to him: has voutsafed to give us such a holiness in Jesus Christ: that
if we can once wash our selves in his blood, we shall become pure and clean
from all our filthiness. When we once know what lump we come of, and that
there is nothing but uncleanness both in our bodies and in our minds: Let
us pray our Lord Jesus Christ to voutsafe to

But let us fall down in the presence of our good God, with acknowledgeme^ of
our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may know how great
need we have to flee to his mercy: and that when he shall have made us to feel
his goodness in the mids of our afflictions, we may not desire to live in
this world, save only to glorify his name. And so let us all say: Almighty God
our heavenly father, we acknowledge and confess according to the truth, that
we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven, to present our selves before
thee, nor to presume so far as that our prayers should be. etc.

The.liiij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xiiij. Chapter.
5 Are not his days limited? is not the number of his months in thee? Have
not thou made an ordinance which he shall not pass?

6 Turn thee away from him, and let him be at rest, till his desired day
come, as the day of a hireling.

7 For there is hope in a tree that is cut down, that it shall spring again,
and that his impes will grovve up again.

8 Although his root be waxed old, and that his body be seared and dead.

9 Yet will he spring again by force of water, and then will he spread
forth as a plant.

10 But if a man fail, so as he dye, he comes no more.

11 Like as if the waters should shrink out of the Sea, and that a river
should pass away.

12 Even so men rise not again, till there be no more any heaven: they think
not of it, another do they rise again out of their sleep.


YEsterday we saw the request that Job made by reason of the fickleness of
man's life. The sum whereof was, that for as much as man is so frail and
flightfull us to the end we should stand the more upon our guard, and pray God
too strengthen us, assuring our selves that although we had never so good a
desire to honor him yet should we be vanquished by and by, were it not that
he holds us up by his hand and gives us strength from above to fight
valiantly with steadfastness. Besides this, we be admonished also not to be out
of heart, though we seem at the point to quayle, nor to be discouraged for
all that. For the excellentest men that ever were, have always bin so
effeebled for a time: howbeit, God has God has bounded the time of man's life.
Very well. Is it to the end we might say he ought too leave us as he found
us? and that he should get him away from us? as Job said yesterday that it
seemed unreasonable that God should open his eyes upon so wretched That the
life of a man is determined by God, that be has the account of our months
in his hands, and that he has set an ordinance which cannot be passed.
Heerevpon we have cause to take great comfort, for that our life is in Gods
hand. Behold here what is the cause that men are so fearful as they dare
not stir one finger but with trembling, and it seems too them that this
thing or that thing may befall them: namely for that they know not that God
has them in his keeping, and that it belongs to him as well to take them out
of this world as he has created them. For were we thoroughly persuaded of
that, it is certain that we should go on our pace, and not be so tormented as
we be: So much the more then ought we to make accounte of the doctrine that is
contained here: that is to wit that God has limited our days. Howbeit it
is true that we must keep a mean in this behalf. For although we ought to
warrant our selves seeing our life is in Gods hand: yet must we not be rash
to cast our selves geerishly into any danger: but we must walk advisedly
according as God commands us. There are some fantastical persons, who
hearing that the days of a man are numbered, and that we can another lengthen
nor shorten our life, because it is in Gods hand and at his good pleasure: will
by and by say, very well, then if I do all that comes in my head, it is all
one: he that is borne to be hanged, shall never be drowned, as the proverb
says among the Papists. Yea and when the unthrifts that are among us are
disposed to dally with God: they use the same: and would God it were not so
common as it is, but in deed it is too common, and men know well enough of
whom I speak. So the^ ye see how these despisers of God take occasion to say
that we may shut our eyes and pass through fire and water, because God has
limited our days. Yea but it is not to that intent, that the scripture
speaks so. It says that God having put us into this world knows how long
he ought to hold us there and that we be in his hand, and that it behooves
us to depart hence whenever it shall please him according also as it is
said in the nintenth Psalm. And wherefore is it told us? to the intent we
should learn to put our selves into Gods hand and to say: Well Lord seeing it
is so that thou disposest of us at thy good pleasure: give us the grace to live
and dye according to thy good will, that we may not covet to live longer than
shall please thee, and also that our life may not seem ouerlong to us when
thou listest to hold us here, and that in the mean time we may serve thee by
spending the time well which thou have given us, the rather for that it is so
short. And again, heerevpon, Lord, seeing thou hold our life in thy hand,
and yet will not have us too know what the term of it is, but haste reserved
it too thine own knowledge: grant us the grace to walk in fear and warely.
Thou haste given us means too mainteyne this present life, thou have given us
meat and drink. Give us the grace to use them soberly and with all
temperance. Moreover thou haste given us remedies: If we be diseased, thou
will not have us too want any thing. And therefore give us the grace that we
may not desire too tarry in this flightfull life, but only too serve and
honor thee. So Lord let us walk in all points as thou commaundest us,
according too that which is said in the one and nintyeth Psalm, that God
will send his Angels too guard us that we may not stumble nor make a false
step when we walk our ways, that is too say, that we may not play the
stray coltes, That there is hope in a tree: when a tree is cut, he may spring
again, and specially if he have nourishment of water, he may forishe a
fresh. But there is not the like hope of a man: when he is once dead, he is
past recovery (says he) and therefore God ought to have pity of so po^re a
creature. Here at the first blushe it may seem strange, that Job cutteth
off all hope from a man when he is once dead. For it seems that here is no
remembrance of the everlasting life, as though men's souls dyed with their
bodies. But let us note first of all, that when Job speaks of men, he
speaks in his passions and torments (as we have seen already) and therefore
he has no further respect but to this present life, according as when we be
pressed with any misery, our mind runs upon nothing but that. If it be
summertime and we be ouerwhot, we think that hard frost were the pleasantest
and holsomest thing that could be. And why? Because we be forepossessed with
the passion that greeueth and tormenteth us. So then forasmuch as Gods hand was
so sore upon Job, he had none other regard but to get out of his present
peynes: and as for the hope of the life to come, he minded it not at all. And
here it is to be seen what men are when they be troubled after that sort with
adversity, if God do not relieve them and strengthen them. True it is that
Job cannot be charged to have concluded that God does utterly root out men,
when he takes them out of the world: Job (I say) made no such final
conclusion. But yet for all that we must note that he was so dazeled with his
passions, that as the^ he remembered not that man continues still in God after
his death, and has there a secret life, and that the same life has a good
seed, so as we shall be fully restored to a perfection, from which we be far
off as now: that is to wit, in his heavenly glory, and glorious
immortality. Job the^ had not that rememberance with him, to settle himself
thereupon, but was dazeled in his passions for a time. And therefore we must
look to our selves, that we be the warer, as I said before. Even so is it in
the rest of these words. Certainly Job knew well that God does men a singular
good turn when he visits them. And if a man had asked him why? Is it not a
great honor that God does to us, in that whereas we be but stinking carcasses,
yet he voutsafeth to cast his eye upon us, and to chastize us when we have
done amiss, as the father does his child? He would have answered, Yes. But yet
for all this, he was not able to conceive it at the first brunt, that he might
have resisted his own passions, but was feign to be tormented and too endure
great distress. So much the more then ought we too receive this
aduertyzemente: Alas Lord, our life is but short and brittle, there is nothing
but filthiness and corruption in us, and yet for all that, thou forgettest us
not. Deserve we that thou should regard us? Are we worthy that thou
should visit us? Alas, no Lord. For the very Angels of Heaven are not
worthy of that and how then should we be worthy, who are but rottenness
and stinche? But what for that? Thou of thine infinite goodness art willing
to be friendly and familiar with us, and thou beholdest us with pity. And when
we have done amiss: in stead of tying us thereunto, thou still pullest us
back to thee, and as^aiest all means too bring us too repentance. And Lord
what a goodness is that? Lo how we ought to speak. The same also is to be
said in this present sentence, that we may fare the better by it. For sith
that men have no strength in themselves, nor can spring and shoot forth
branches new again as trees do which have some root in the earth: but do
rotte away quite and clean: sure that they shall be restored once again, and
that in sted of this transitory lodging, we have a dwelling place prepared for
us in Heaven, and therefore it ought not to grieve us to droope away by little
and little till we be quite and clean dispatched. Seeing we have that,
ought we not to be stirred the more to praise God? So then we see how we may
apply that thing to our instruction, which Job turns here to an evil use
in going about too express the pangs that he felt, and whereagainst he fought.
And furthermore when we speak of our own state, let

So then let us mark, that whereas Job speaks here of the life of man, as
a person without regard of the resurrection to come: he rested not wholly
upon that point, (for he had well foreseen what that was) but meant to
express the passion that he felt, to the end that every of us should bethink
himself, and not be carried away when such temptations befall us. Moreover if
Job were weakened after that sort: let us assure our selves that we shall be
weakened much more. Howbeit, God which assisted him, will do the like for us
also. For his power is as invincible to maynteyne us at this day, as it was
then. He calls us too him at this day even of his own goodness, which is
not abated that he should not make us to feel it as well as he made his
servants of old

But let us fall down before the presence of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us perceive them better than we have done,
and yet notwithstanding after such a sort, as we may not become as folk
forlorn, but return too the remedy, desiring him to be pitiful to us, and
to show himself the same toward us, which he has bin toward his in all
times: and furthermore, that seeing it has pleased him too be at one with us
in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that our Lord Jesus Christ has
given in his own self us so good a gage of his love, specially by the death
and passion which he endured [for our sakes] he suffer us not to forget or
too despize so great a benefit, but rather that we may put our whole trust
in him, and by that means be stirred up to call upon our good God in all
our necessities and miseries. That it may please him to grant this grace not
only too us but also to all people. etc.

The.lv. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xiiij. Chapter.
13 O that thou vvoldest hide me in the grave, and that thou had shut me up
till thine anger were abated, and that thou vvoldest set me a time wherein to
think upon me.

14 Shall the man that is dead live again? All the days of my battle I will
wait till my change come.

15 O that thou vvoldest answer me when I call to thee, O that thou vvoldest
favor the work of thy hands.


THe Prophet Esaias showing how horrible Gods wrath is and how heavy too bear,
says that such as feel it would feign that the mountains should hide them,
and wish that they might fall down upon their heads: and our Lord O that
thou would hide me in the grave. For he preferred death before his life in
case as it was. And why? Because he would have escaped Gods hand if it had bin
possible. For he knew well it was a far terribler matter to have God to be his
judge, than too die a hundred times. And this ought to touch us the nearer and
to make I would fayue that thou baddest hidden me in the grave, and that I were
shut up in it, until suck time as I were cut off. Here he shows wherefore
he desires death: namely because he felt himself shut up under Gods
judgment, and could find no way to escape out And hereby we be warned that our
startingholes shall serve us to no purpose in the end: and that when we have
fisked hither and thither never so much, we must be feign to be as it were shut
up. We shall have profited well for one day if we can bear this lesson in
mind. Why so? for although God threaten us never so much, yet it is seen that
there needs not any thing to make us believe that we be able to shift out of
it, according as every of us imagines one I would that thou had hidden
me in the grave. Here it might be demanded, And is not death a token of Gods
wrath and curse? Is our coming thither too any relief? What does that boot
us? Verily it seems too be the uttermost extremity, and that God cannot
show any greater rigor upon us than to put us to death. But Job has here
conceived death amiss, as I have showed heretofore: and that must we bear
well in mind. He was ouerpressed Until thou bethink thee of me, and until
thou set me a day: thereby he shows how there is some feeling still even
after death, howbeeit that I will wait in the grave until thou appoint me a
time to bethink thy self of me. This Bethinking here is nothing else but Gods
calling of his creatures to judgment. But Job was so troubled in wit, and the
said passion did so turmoyle him, as he judged not with so settled a mind as
he ought to do. And why? First and foremost, so long as we live in this world,
what should we more desire than that God should have us in remembrance? For
if he forget us, what shall become of us? Peter said, Get thee away from me O
Lord, for I am a wretched sinner. Yea but we must go the contrary way to
work and say, Lord come nearer us: for without thy grace, we be nothing: So
then it is very needful that god should remember us. And how? To maintain and
preserve us, so as he uphold us and have pity upon our feebleness, to
relieve the same and to guide us by his providence. Ye see then that God must
be feign to remember us, or else our state is very miserable. For there is
nothing that we ought to be so much afraid of, as to be forgotten of God. Lo
here one point. Again, although God take us out of this world, yet forgets
he us not, though he seem to forget us. For he keeps those that are his
always in his hand and custody: and as for those that are damned, they be
reserved as it were in Chains until the day of executing the sentence. Ye see
then that God does always bear us in mind. And when the scripture says he
has forgotten us: it is because we perceive not his present succors, like as
if a poor man that lingreth in pain, desire God too help him, and feel not
his help nor sees any likelyhod that God hears him. Thus ye see after what
sort it is said that he has forgotten us: to wit, for ought that we do
perceive: but yet for all that he remembers us continually. Job then did
amiss to surmize that if he were dead he should be forgotten til god should
call up al his creatures at the latter day, and summon them too his judgment
seat. Job therefore did not consider this remembrance of Gods toward us so
well as was requisite. But we may well see it, if we be persuaded of that which
I have said: namely that God ceasseth not too think upon us though he leave us
there for a little while, so as our bodies rot in the earth, and our souls
abide in suspense, waiting for the day wherein all the world shall be repaired.
Moreover, so long as we live, let us be fully resolved, that there is nothing
better for us than too have God to think upon us: yea even though it were to
punish us. If God think upon us to make us feel his fauor^ therein consists
all our joy and glory according as it is said in the eight Psalm. Alas what
is man, that God should vouchsafe to look upon him, and too watch over him?
We be as a little shadow. we be nothing at all and yet it pleases God to have
a fatherly ca^e of ou^ life. And ought not we too acknowledge a wonderful
goodness in him in that behalf? So then we must highly esteem the said
mercy which God shows us, in being mind full of us, even to make us feel
his goodness. But (as I said) although he chostice us for our sins, yet is
(...) gracious to us. For thereby he shows that he is loath we should perish
in that he calls us back again too him when he sees us in the high way to
destruction. For are not all his chastizings as many warnings, which he gives
us to come to repentance? Ye see then how we ought to set the more store by
Gods grace in that he is mindful of us: and not desire him to forget us.
This is it in effect which we have too remember concerning this sentence. Now
there ensues, Shall the m^n that is dead live again? For I look for my
change all the days of my battle, or of my Shall the man that is dead rise
again * Verily he meeneth of death, in case as when God utters all his force
too bring a man too naught. And what is that? It is as if he should say:
Alas Lord it seems that thou art minded too bar me of the hope which
thou haste given us of our rising again. For seeing thou handlest me so
rygorously, does not this strange dealing which thou use toward me,
tend too the utter fordooing of me? And when thou have fordone me, who is he
that can make me up again? Then his surmising is, not that God will put him
over too a further time: but that he will utterly root him out of the number of
creatures. And that is the cause why he demau^deth whither it be possible for a
man to come to life again when he is once dead. It is because God deals so
strau^gely with him, as it may seem that he is minded too bring him utterly
to naught. And hereby we be warned to pray God to handle us so measurably, as
we may always have Reason or Judgment, Ieremiement a moderate fashion
agreeable to our I will wait till the day of my changing come: some men
expound it, that if Job wist that God would rayze the dead, and that there
were any hope of the resurrection and renewment: he would wait for that day.
But it must be taken more plainly: that is too Behold, I will wait for the
day of my change, yea even all the time of my travel. As if he had said, True
it is that as long as my time lasts, I wish that God should keep me
shette up in my grave, that he should cast me intoo some dungeon, and that
he should cause the hills to fall upon me: but yet must I tarry his leisure
still, yea even in the mids of the affictions wherein I am. And although they
be hard and unable to be endured, yet notwithstanding forasmuch as there is a
change, the same must suffice me to give me some comfort, and to nourish me in
the obedience of God, Now we see what the meening be will tarry for his
change: that word deserves to be weyed thoroughly. Verily he speaks of the
resurrection, and therefore meeneth that we must be wholly renewed, so as the
corruption which is in us by reason of Adams sin, be utterly done away, and
God receive us into the immortality of his kingdom. Lo here the change
whereof Job speaks: And the same is also the thing that we must have an eye
unto. For without the resurrection we cannot comfort our selves, neither will
all that ever man can allege be sufficient to cheer us. We see also that the
holy scripture directs the faithful thither when it purposes too content
them, and too give them assured and settled rest. Be ye sure (say the servants
of God) that we be called to be partakers of the heavenly glory which God
has promised too those that are his: and therefore be ye glad of it. Howbeeit
for the better assurance of this last change, we must consider the chaunges
that God makes at this day* even during the course of this life, how God
makes many alterations in us, whereby he gives us already some taste of the
last change: As for example. We be in some trouble, and well, we be as it
were shet up there. When we look for the end of it, we see none, there is
no remedy, it is past recovery, and we be forlorn: and suddenly God has such
pity upon us as we be delivered out of hand. See ye not a change that ought
too lead us further forth, which is too understand that there is a much
perfecter deliverance than all these are which we perceive at this day
particularly? Then let us learn to acquaint our selves well with That he will
wait for that change all the days of his travel. Which saying is worthy
too be well marked. For if we be tossed with never so many troubles, it is not
enough upon some good motion and affection, to say, now must we trust in
God: for that is nothing unless we hold out, yea even in the mids of all
our incounters. First of all therefore let us mark that hope is not a days
bird or a months bird, but must continue to the end. And doubtless when
we be fully settled upon Gods promises, he holds us still in the same, too
the end we may not quayle every day, but that when we have ouerpassed some
time, we may always be stablished more and more, until God have performed
the things which as yet are delayed to another time. Ye see the^ that it
booteth not to have had some good affection, or to have trusted in God, except
it continue so throughout. And Job has expressed the same thing the plainlyer
under the word Travel or ^attell. And why so? For he meeneth that we go not
to God at our ease, as we see well enough. As long as we suffer nothing, we can
find in our hearts to live still in this world, and to prolong our life
double if it were possible. Our desire is then that God should handle us
without greeuing us, and please us in all respects, and obey us in all our
desires. See how easily we would pass the time if we might go but our own
pace, if we might have no temptation, and that there might be no heaviness in
fear, nor any such thing else. But it is said that we must give attendance
all our life long, yea even with fighting. In these words, All the days,
there is showed us, that if the time linger and seem long to us, we must not
take it for an excuse to do evil, and to be grieved, and to give over all in
the mids of our journey: but we must continue to the end. Under this word
Battle or Fighting, is expressed unto us the state of this present life: which
is, that being but wayfarers in this world, we must be feign to fight, to be
beseeged on all sides, to be in continual peril, too be tempted sometimes
with cares, sometimes with adversities, and sometime with some danger.
Therefore let us think upon it. Herewithall let us understand also that we
must fight against the lusts of our own flesh. But notwithstanding O that
thou would answer him that calls to thee, and that thou would accept
the work of thine own hand: This serves but for a larger declaration of the
matter that we come to treat of. His intent is to show what the change is
that he has waited for, that is, that God should be gracious to the work of
his own hands. Surely some expound this present streyn as God would bear
down the work of his hands. I will answer whenever thou call me. For Job
protests that he will no more shun God, nor shrink back from him when he
calls him, but will be ready to come, yea even with a cheerful courage. And
why? For he knows that God will show himself pitiful toward him. Thus ye
see that the thing which we have to mark in this streyne in effect, is that
even in the mids of our troubles, when it seems that god is sore displeased
with us, and that we shall not come any more too atonement with him, yea and
that he will not reckon us any more in the number of his creatures: when all
this is come to pass: yet nevertheless we must fight against such despair,
until we have gotten so much as to hope for the change that we wayt for. See
then how this text ought to provoke us to be of good comfort in our
adversities, and to pray God to strengthen us so with his power, that although
we be tossed too and fro with many storms, yet we may not cease for all that
to keep on our way still toward him, and to make no doubt of coming thither,
howsoever the world go. For although he seem to have cast us off and to be
angry with us: yet if we return unto him, and call upon him, he will answer
us and stablish the hope of our welfare by making us to feel the love that he
bears us, that we may be thoroughly persuaded and out of doubt of it.

Now let us fall down before the presence of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so too feel them, as the same may be a
mean too provoke us too return unto him, with true repentance, and we may
prosper therein more and more, till he have taken us out of the miseries of
this world, to gather us into his kingdom, where we shall enjoy his
everlasting rest to the full, whereof as now he gives us but a taste by his
holy Ghost. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only unto us, but
also to all, etc.

The.lvj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xiiij. Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth the rest of the exposition of the. xv verse, and then
the text that follows.

16 Now thou recknest my steps, and make no delay upon my sin.

17 My misdeede is sealed as in a bundell, and thou have added to mine
iniquity.

18 A Mountain perishes infalling down, and a Rock vvasteth.

19 The waters consume stones, thou destroyest the earth with floudes of
waters, thou take away hope from the man that is in misery.

20 Thou vtterest thy force to overcome him, thou couerest his face, and
sendest him away.

21 He knovveth not vvhither his sons be exalted, or vvhither they be
oppressed and distressed.

22 But his flesh mourns so long as it is upon him, and his soul is in
sorrovv.


We saw yesterday in what wise we may answer God: that is to say, in what
wise we may come freely unto him: namely by knowing that he loves us, and
that he accepts us as the work of his hand. For so the work of thine
hands. For the thing wherein we may settle our trust that we be acceptable
to God, is that he has created us, and that we be his. Then must we not
pretend to be loved at Gods hand for any deserts of our own, but because
he sees we are his workmanship. True it is, that we are his woorkemanship
already, in that we be men: But there is yet more, that is to wit, he has
fashioned us new again after his own Image, through the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ. When the holy Ghost teaches us how we should pray unto God, he
sets these words before us, Lord we are thy workmanship. After this manner
it is said in Esaias, and likewise in the fourescoure and fiftenth Psalm: We
are thy flock, we are the work of thy hands: and in other textes. Lord thou will not despise the work of thine hands, thou will not forsake that which
thou have begun, without finishing of it. Ye see then whereof we ought to
take occasion too trust in God. For if we be agreeable unto him, and come
unto him, we be sure that he is ready to receive us. And why? Even because we
be his creatures, and he has formed us, and he will not cast away the thing
that comes of himself. Mark this for one point. Howbeeit, (as I said) we
must not look only too our first creation: for the God accepts the work of
his own hands. But now behold he is assailed new again. How? Thou numbrest
my steps (says he) and delayest not my sin. The text is, Thou keep not
my sin. But this word keep signifies to watch or wait upon. In effect
Jobs meening is* that Gods judgment presses him too excessiuely. and
disquieted? So then as often as God visits us with his rods, let us look
homewarde too think well upon our sins, and to consider that we have long
time before deserved that God should show us such rigor. And whereas we have bin
borne withal, and not touched at the first day: let us acknowledge our selves
beholding to him therefore, and that the same proceeded of his infinite mercy,
and that his present afflicting of us is because we have compelled him to do
it, by provoking him to much with our sins: and to be short, that we have
abused his goodness and that his sin is sealed up, and that God has added
to his misdoings. The word Add, is God added to Jobs misdeedes, it should
be meant that God did make them greater and more heinous than they were in
deed:) But the text shows that it tends to another end. For it is no new
thing, (specially in Job and in the Psalms) too see repetitions, as which is a
it would be found that he has offended more than I. Thereupon we conclude,
that God keeps not so even a hand nor such uprightness as he ought to do.
Or if we be ashamed to blasph^eme him so: yet cease we not to repyne at him,
and to say, what a dealing is this? Wherefore does God punish me for my
sins, when in the mean while I see he lets others alone that are no
better than I? If I look upon my neighbors, I shall find them more faulty
than my self, and yet I see not that God handles them so rigorously as he
does me. Thus ye That a Mountain goes too decay, that Rocks melt, that the
water bolloweth the stones, and that the man that is in misery is destroyed by
God, specially if God utter his force against him. Some men are of opinion,
that Job does here compare Death with the Mountains, Rocks, and Stones, as
if he should say, how now? Mountains consume, and so do Rocks: but death
endures that man is miserable, and has such store of miseries as cannot well
be expressed: he meeneth to conclude thereby, that God ought not to pursue men
so sore. But by the way, let us look a little upon the hardness that is in us
when God afflicts us. Though we be beaten never so much, is it seen that we
be ever a whit the softer? or that we bow our necks the more? or that he
wins us to become teachable and obedient? Alas no. But we see that God may
make the same complaynt in these days, which he made in the prophet Esays
time: what shall I do more, says he? For from the soale of the foot, to the
crown of the head, there is no whole part in this people. God is weary
because he had chastized that people so much, and assayde too bring them too
amendment. Well then, ye see here a people that was beaten, and double
beaten, and forwo^e with plagues, wars, and famine, both generally and
particularly: Finally, they are become like wretched lepres that rotte in their
own afflictions: and yet for all that they are still as stubburne or more
stubburne than ever they were before. Ye see then that our Lord deals in
this behalf as a father that sees no amendmente in his Children, and is
grieved at the heart, that notwithstanding all the correction which he uses, yet
his children are altogether stubborn and vnreformable, and therefore he
makes his moan saying, Alas, what a thing is this? I have lost my labor.
Even so does God complain of his people. And see we not as much in our selves
at this day? So then let us mark, that although we be miserable, and have many
defaults in us: yet cease we not therefore to be still hard hearted and
stubborn. Yea and in respect of the blind pride and feerce presumptuousnesse
that is in that God utters his force so far, that he even changes his
countenance, and frowneth upon him, and he knows not what his heirs shall
^ee, whither poor or rich, noble or v^^oble. Job* goes on with his
complaynte, and shows that when God shall have punished men all their life
long* their end also shall be suitable therevntoo: and when they be departed
out of the world, they shall have no more intelligence what is done here. And
afterward he adds for a conclusion, that so long as his flesh is upon him,
it must needs be payned, and his soul must be sorrowful, and he himself
must mourn. Surely this complaynte is not void of unthankfulness. For Job
ought too know, that God does always mingle his favor with the afflictions
that he sends us, so as we have cause to bliss him. But he considered not
that. Why so(...) Because he was ouerpassionate and sorrowful. Also we must
bear in mind what we have said before* that is too* wit, that as often as God
scourges us* we must bethynke us of the benefits that we have received of
him, and that will help to assuage our grief. For when we muze upon nothing
but the misery that we endure, we are so ouerraught with sorrow, as we can
not bliss God, nor call upon him, nor settle our trust in him. But if we look
the other way, [and think with our selues] God has done us thus many good
turns, and will he not hold on still? Then our sorrows are assuaged: and
therewithal also we recover boldness to call upon God. Hereupon we conclude,
that it behooves us to be pacient, and that it is enough that he has showed
himself to be our good father, and that his correcting us with his own hand,
was because he tendereth our welfare. Ye see then that the thing which we
have too mark in the first place, is that Jobs rushing out into such rage,
was because he looked no further but to his own miseries: and that therefore it
behooves us too bethink us of Gods benefits when he afflicts us, to the
end that our sorrow may be

Now let us knele down in the presence of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him to make us feel them so as we may crave
forgiveness of them at his hand: and that we may be so stirred up too pray, as
he may make us to feel his goodness and mercy, and we profit more and more
thereby: and also that all the time of f^ur life may give over our selves too
the glorifying of his holy name, and to the praising of him as he deserves:
And that when he has once brought us into the right way, he will never
suffer us to swerve any more aside, but that we may continue with invincible
strength and steadfastness, even to the end. That it may please him to grant
this grace not only to us, but. etc.

The.lvij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xv. Chapter.
ELiphas the Themanite ansvvered and said:

2 Will a wise man bring forth knowledge of vvinde, and fill men's bellies
with the East vvynde?

3 Will he reason of unmeet matters, and of unlawful words?

4 But thou pullest away fear, and turnest prayer away from God.

5 Thine own mouth shall reprove thee of unrighteousness, and thou haste
taken the tongue of craftynesse.

6 Thine own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I, and thine own lips
bear witness against thee.

7 Art thou the first man borne? vvart thou created before the mountains?

8 Haste thou heard the secrets of God, or is wisdom restrained unto thee?

9 What know thou that we know not* what understand thou that is
not in us?

10 For we be baldheaded and ancient. There is an older man among us than thy
father.


WHen we know we have spoken truth and in Gods behalf, and yet men reject
all that we have said: it is a very hard and grievous temptation. For in that
case not only we be blamed in our own persons: but also we see that men
refuse the things that are of God. Nevertheless it behooved Job to undertake
such a battle, as we see in this streyne. He had mainteyned his case, not by
suttletie, nor of wilfulness, that he had taken to him the tung of
craftiness, or of the despizers of God, and that all his sayings had bin but
as wind wherein there had bin no firmness nor reason. Job therefore is
grievously charged here for maynteyning the doctrine which he knew to be of
God. And this must serve for our example at this day. For many are so grieved
when they see that men receive not Gods word, but rather that the most part of
the world condemns it. But what for that? Seeing that men have that a wise
man will not bring forth windy word^, nor fill his bearers bellies with the
Eastern wind: it is the same thing which we see commonly in the Scripture*
that is to wit, that our words ought not to be unprofitable, but rather well
seasoned with* salt, according as Saint Paul uses the same similitude, and
afterward to Saint Paul says, that knowledge of it self does but puff
men up, when it is not matched with love: but love edifieth, when we hear Gods
word to our own instruction, or talk of it to the instruction of others. But
if we covet to be counted skillful, and by foolish vaingloriousnesse desire
every of us to be esteemed sharpwitted, and to be thought well seen in the
scriptures: what is it else but wind and puffednesse as Saint Paul says?
And lo what the Divinity is which men have forged and framed to themselves by
their own vaynegloriousnesse: like as Thou take away fear, and withdrawest
prayer from God. True it is, that the second word which he uses, signifies
sometimes a Muzing, Minding, or Bethinking: but yet commonly it is taken for
prayer and supplication. And no doubt but Eliphas meant here to note the two
principal parts of the edifying which we have to receive by good doctrine.
For what is the mark that God ameth at when he sets his word before us? It
is to hold us in awe, and to make us to walk in his fear and obedience: and
also to make us put our whole trust in him, and too call upon him, seeing we
be destitute of the spirit of wisdom, righteousness, power, and life.
Mark then the two points that we have to observe, if we intend too shoot
at the right mark, and to come too the point which God calls us unto. True
it is that we shall hear of many things when Gods word is handled before us.
But (as I have said) all comes to those two points. Eliphas therefore
intending too conclude that Jobs learning was but a wind that puffs up and
swells the stomach, says that it takes away fear, and withdraws prayer
from God. As if he should say, when we be turned aside from the fear of God,
and are not minded to call upon him, and to flee unto his goodness, all is but
a wind that will make us to burst, and not nourish us at all. By this then we
may the better see what the edification is that he speaks of. It is
oftentimes said by S. Paul, that al must be done to edifying. And what is that
edifying? It is that we should be taught to fear God, and stablished in the
same more and more: And secondly, that we should be taught to call upon him,
and warned too seek all our welfare in him alone, according also as that is
the place where we shall find it. As touching Fear, it imports as much as
that our life must be ruled according Tear imports: that is to say, that we
should learn to direct our whole life to the will of God. We have his law
whereby he guides us, and shows us that he has chozen the tung of
craftiness. This present saying imports that he does but mock with God as
they do which are bereft of all fear and reverence, and have not any more
reason in them. For sometimes men shall sin through simplicity, and yet
stand in some fear of God, howbeit they shall be dulled [for the time:]
according as we shall see many that are not touched after a lively sort, but
are little better than brute beasts, and yet notwithstanding there shall some
fear of God lie hidden in them, which is as good as choked: well then, such
manner of folk have Art thou the first man (says he) wart thou borne before
the mountains? Here are ancient and gray healed men, yea even such as are
elder than thy father? Art thou of counsel with God? When Eliphas vpbraydeth
Job after this fashion, that he is not old enough, and that he ought not to
take upon him such a liberty of judging: verily he has some color in his
saying, as we have seen before. For when God is so gracious unto a man as to let
him live long time here: he may well have learned many a thing. And again we
know that men's wits are the better settled by age, and that young men cast
forth many bubbles, which age represseth. So then it is to be presumed,

Now let us kneel down in the presence of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may flee to him
alone, as to the party that is able to remedy all our harms, and seek him
in such wise, as we may be hilde prisoners under his obedience, and not
desire any thing but to stick purely and simply to his word, renouncing what
soever is of our own nature, because there is nothing but corruption and
frowardness in it, and also praying him too renew us in such wise by his holy
spirit, that by being likeshapen to his image, we may have so much the better
certentie and proof that he takes us for his children, and we also may yield
him thanks again as too our father. That it may please him to grant this
grace, not only too us, but also to all people, etc.

The.lviij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xv. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the.viij. ix. and x. verses, and then upon that
which follows.

11 Seem Gods comfortes a small thing unto thee? and is this strange unto
thee?

12 Why is thy heart ravished: and why do thine eyes make sign,

13 That thou bucklest thy self against God, and vtterest the words of thy
mouth before him?

14 What is man that he should be clean? or he that is borne of woman,
that he should be rightuouse.

15 Behold, he finds no steadfastness in his Saints, another are the heavens
clean in his sight:

16 And how much more is man abominable and filthy, who drinks iniquity
as water?


WE saw yesterday the reproach that was offered unto Job in respect of his
age: and thereupon I said it was good reason, that young folk should be ruled
by the counsel of their elders, and give ear to such as have had that he
has not heard Gods secrets. This poynteth at all men in general. For it
behooves us too understand the rudeness and weakness of our own wit: and
the true mean to do it, is to reverence Gods secrets, knowing that they are
incomprehensible, and too high for us to attain unto. For as long as men
presume upon their own wit, and think to atteyne too the height of Gods
secrets: it is certain that he had not heard the secrets of God. And this
doctrine is as often repeted and as common in the weenest thou that Gods
comfortings are but a small thing? and is there any secret in thee, or is it
strange to thee? For this word Secret betokens strange. Eliphas meeneth
here to reprove Job of pride and unthankfulness: for he says to him, How
now? It seems that thou despisest the consolations of God, and thou think
it strange that he should comfort thee. If any man were at that point, surely
it were and over great pride, yea and a despyzing of Gods grace, which were not
to be borne withal. And why? for we ought to esteem Gods comfortings above
all things. If we be troubled, what shifte or Secret, when Eliphas says, what
secret is there in thee? as if he should say, wretched creature, feel thou
not thine own frayltie? But surely if men knew themselves as they be in
deed: they should needs fall to agreement with God, and be inflamed with
such desire thereof, as they would never be at rest, until God had made them
feel his grace, But what? we be so blockishe, as we ween our selves to be
wise, whereas there is nothing but foolishness and vanity in us. We think
our selves to have the remedy of our misery in our sleeves. If we happen to
be combred with any trouble, we fall to sharpning of our wits, and we must
needs be devising of some shift or other: as who would say, that all that matter
could be forged in our own shop. But yet for all that, men are so ouerweening.
And therefore it is said here, what secret is there in thee? Then if we
perceived how gross, ignorant, and doltishe we be: surely we would not be
such fools, as to surmise that we have wherewith to deliver our selves out
of our anguish and trouble: but we would go straight ways unto God, being
well assured, that he only can set things at a stay, according as we perceive
in very deed, and as he himself shows well enough. Thus much therefore
concerning this sentence. But (according as I have said already) let us put
the same in ure. And for as much as our life is subject to so many miseries, as
it is impossible that a man should have one minute of rest in himself, without
carrying away and without forgetting of himself: let us go to God that he may
comfort us, and let us make account of the warnings that he gives us, as they
deserve. And God comfort us diverse ways: for (as I have said already) he
declares all the troubles, whereout of it seemed that we should never get out,
and dispatcheth them in such wise, as we perceive that he has delivered us.
Now let us come to that which Eliphas adds, He says, that Jobs heart is
carried away, and that he makes a sign with his eyes too lift up himself
against God. Here Eliphas reproves Jobs pride, how be it wrongfully and
without cause. But according to that which I have said already, although this
matter be misapplyed to Job himself: yet may we gather a profitable lesson of
it, and such a one as serves all our turns. Therefore he says. How is thy
heart ravished, how has it surprised thee? For word for word it is thus: How
bathe thy heart seized thee? And how is it that thou make countenance with
thine eyes to plead against God? to make a sign or countenance with the eye,
is too be so scornful, as to do nothing else but leere (as men say) and to
turn away our ears when men tell us any thing. And we know that men do so,
when they regard not the things that are spoken, but take them as superfluous
matter, as if nothing could be alleged which were not known before. To be
short, we see that Eliphas meant to condemn such a pride in Job, as though he
humbled not himself unto God, to hearken what he said unto him. Heerewithall
he shows that such pride is ill grounded, when he says that Jobs heart is
ravished. Then is it certain, that this pride is always one of the vices in
men: and therefore in as much as our Lord sees men stand so in their own
conceit, and wexe hard in their pride: he is feign to show them that they be
but fools, and utterly witless, in presuming so much of themselves, and in
beating themselves in hand that they have whereof to vaunt. For if we have any
appearance or likelyhoode of ability, by and by ye shall see us lifted up so
high, as there is no hold of us, and we stye so far till we be ready to
What is man that he should be able too iustifye himself before God, or that
he should be found pure and clean? For God finds not steadfastness in his
Saints (that is to say in his Angels) another are the heavens clean in his
sight: and what shall become of stinking, abbominable, and corrupt man, which
drinks inquitie as water? Like as fish are set wholly to the serving and
honoring of God, so as they give themselves to nothing else. And so according
to the righteousness of the law, God accepts the^ as I said before. But there
is another higher righteousness in God, which surmounteth all creatures, in so
much as no Angel is able to satisfy it. And no wonder at all: for what
comparison is there between an infinite thing, and a thing that has bounds?
Behold, although the Angels have great glory in them: yet are they but
creatures. And what is God? He is an infinite thing, in so much that when they
be not able to fulfill the law, but are bewrapped in many imperfections, laden
with so many infirmities, so inconstant and fleeting, and such other terms
which might be spoken against men without coming too the very point: but it
is said that men cannot justify themselves, because, as they are abominable,
and Filthy, and drink iniquity as water: that is to say, their proper
nurrishment is sin, and there is not so much as one drop of goodness to
be found in them: and to be short, like as the body draws his sustenance of
meat and drink: stinking some have translated unprofitable: but the very
meaning of it is, that we be withered away, that there is nothing left in us*
but are as a thing that is utterly corrupted. And it is said expressly in the
Psalm, that God knew men to be so. And why? Because men would always be
their own judges. To what purpose is that? Forsooth we would have God tied to
our fancies, and because we think our selves men of sufficient ability, we
would that God should content himself with our opinion. But on the

Now let us fall down in the presence of our good God with acknowledgement of
our saultes, praying him too reach us his hand, that we may not continue in
trouble and shame: and that although we have to walk through many temptations,
yet we may not be destitute of his aid and succor: but that by his
comforting and strengthening of us, we may so get the victory in all
incounters, as we may have cause to yield him thanks: and that according to his
working in us, we may be stablished for the time too come, even till we have
obtained the full victory, and are come to the glory of Heaven, where we
shall triumph with our Lord Jesus Christ. That it may please him to grant
this grace, etc.

The.lix. Sermon which is the third upon the fiftenth Chapter.
17 I will tell thee, hear me: I have seen, and I will declare unto thee.

18 What wise men have told, as they received it from their fathers, and have
not concealed it.

19 To whom alone the land was given, and the stranger passed not through
them.

20 The wicked is alvvayes as it were in a travel of child, and the number
of years is hid from the outrageous.

21 The noise of fear is in his ears: when he is in peace, behold the
destroyer shall come upon him.

22 He believes not to get out of darkness: he shall see the svvorde.


YEsterday we saw in what plight man is when he is out of Gods favor: that
is to wit, that there is that the wicked never have any rest, but are in such
vnquiethesse, as they need none other hangman to torment them than themselves.
But heerevpon he concludes amiss, that Job is a wicked man. For although he
were astonished at his greefes, yet notwithstanding (as has been said
already) he ceased not to trust still in God. The doctrine therefore (as I
said) is good and holy: but the same must be applied accordingly. And for this
cause I told you that in reading the holy scripture, we must always pray God
to give us the skill and discretion to perceive to what end he tends, Here
me (says he) and I will rell thee what I have seen. He speaks of his own
experience: and afterward he adds, that the same doctrine was received and
hilde after the same manner among the wise men too whom God has given the
grace not only to be able to rule well themselves, that they hild them
peaceably with out any passing of stranger through them: that is to say,
without any man's usurping of that which God had put into their hands. Verily
whenever God indueth men with excellent gifts, we must not despise the same,
but consider that the sprite of God dwells in them, and that if we be so
skornefull as to refuse that which they tell us, the injury thereof redoundeth
not to a mortal wight, but too the living God. For thereafter as God utters
his gracious gifts, so will he have us also to receive them to our common
profit. Eliphas therefore has some good color and pretense to allege the
authority of such as had ruled Realms and countries: but yet is not that
enough, except we know that it is God which speaks. And for performance
thereof, ought we to trust to the authority of men? True it is that God
commands us too be teachable, and not to be stubborneharted and hard to
yield obedience, when we know that the thing which is told us is true. And so
ye see how the authority of men ought to be received. But if they fall to
turning of the truth vpside down, and to converting of it into falsehood, there
is no reason why men should be wended unto the^. Therefore we must bear this
point well in remembrance. For we see there are two ungracious extremities. The
one is when men reject all knowledge and wisdom. For if there be any men among
us, whom God has advanced above others, and unto whom he has dealt greater
abundance of his holy spirit: it is certain (as I said before) that in
despising them, wrong is offered unto God: Neuerthlesse, we see many stubborn
folk, which will not by any means submit themselves to the counsel or advise
of any man. There is also another extremity, which is, that being possessed
with a foreco^ceiued opinion that a man is skilful, of great wit, and well
experienced, we be so sotted therewith, as we look no whit further. But we
must not suffer our selves to be led so: for God does always reserve his own
right to himself. And what is that? Verily that we should be subject to him
alone, specially in cacos of salvation* True it is that there are ordinances
and civil policies of men, whereto we must be obedient, but yet is all that
referred unto him, and depends upon him. In the mean season ye see here a
resolute point, which is that God will have us to be taught at his hand. For
when we yield such authority unto me^, what do we else but rob God of his
authority and pre-eminence? This extremity therefore is to be condemned as
well as the other. The mean betwixt these two vices is, that when we see that
God has bestowed of his gracious gifts upon any man, we must have him in
estimation, take counsel willingly at his hand, and understand that in
despising him we do wrong unto God, because it is his will that we should
honor such. Is it so? Yet notwithstanding let us not cease to discern, least
we be beguiled under the shadow of some opinion that we shall that these men
have not concealed the things that they had learned of their forefathers.
Wherein he shows, that they had behaved themselves faithfully. For
whenever God gives us the grace to be well taught: he does it not for
ourselves only, but to the intent that others also should be drawn to the same
knowledge, and that we should all of us be partakers together that God had
given them the land and no stranger had passed through it: it is to express
that they had received an excellent prerogative from above. For it is certain,
that if a man be able to maintain the government that is put into his hand,
it is a token that God favors him, and it becomes him to acknowledge that
benefit: For there is no policy of manable to do that thoroughly. Also whereas
Eliphas says, that those of whom he speaks, had reigned peasably, and that
God had blissed them in such wise as they were not troubled, but had so guided
their subjects as their dominion contained in quietness: thereby we be done
to understand, that when God maynteineth states, and a country is in peace,
we must not father it upon mortal men, but acknowledge it to be the special
benefit of God. And our acknowledging of it must not be honoring the men by
whom God served his turn in doing it, but also in yielding God his due
praise. Now let us come to the chief article that we have touched. Eliphas
says that the wicked man is always as it were traveling with child, that he
never has any rest, that he is in continual tormente, that he looks ever
at the sword, and that he knows not the number of his days. And our Lord
uses the same threat against the transgressers of his law: namely that he
will send them such a fearfulness, that their life shall hang before them by
a thread, that their eyes shall be sunken in their head, and that they shall
be in such anguishe of mind, that in the morning they shall say, who will
warrant me my life until night? and when night is come, how may I endure
till tomorrowe? Lo how God punishes such as walk not purely according to his
law. And in good faith what pureness is there in our life? If we desire to be
at rest, and not to be tossed with any cares, it behooves us to know that we
be in Gods protection, and we must be fully resolved of it: and then it is
certain that we may pass through fire and water: that is to say, hap what
hap will, we shall be sure of a good and steadfast leaningstocke. But if we
know not that God watches over us, or at leastwise if we think he is
against us: we must needs be afraid and not know where to become. Therefore
it is not without cause that God uses the said manace against the
transgressers of his law. And so is Eliphassis saying very true, that the
wicked is always fearful according also as the Prophet Esaias likeneth the
thoughts of wicked folks too waves that beat one against another. When any
tempest is, ye see the water stirs, and the waves come rushing one against
another, and break asunder. Even so is it with a man that is not aided by God.
It is not any one passion that shall carry him that the extorcioneres, ever
the person that is full of violence shall not know the number of his years.
The faithful are at that point as well as they. Furthermore, we hear what
request David makes. Show me at leastwise (says he) what my time is, that I
may take my afflictions in good worth, when I perceive that they shall not
last for ever. We have seen the like request made by Job himself, saying
that he knew not what the length of his time was, nor how long God was minded
to hold him here. Why then does Eliphas refer it specially to be despisers
of God, and to such as are full of pride and outrage? It is by cause they be
full of care and thought for their life: and yet in the mean while wot not how
to account it. And we for our part know that we have no certain term here,
howbeit that we shall continue here so long as it pleases God to maintain
us. Seeing we be come into the world, and it is God that has set us here:
we must give him leave too hold us here, or to take us away at his pleasure.
In the mean season we here how he tells us by his word, that he guides
us altogether, the hairs of our heads are numbered, that we need not to be
afraid of any thing though we were beset with never so many dangers, and
that we ought not to surmise that things are mingled together in the world,
or that fortune bears any sway. For although we be but silly worms of the
earth: yet does God think upon us, and he has our life in his hand, and will
keep it well and safely. Ought it not to suffice us when we know this
protection of God? Seeing (I say) that we be assured that God keeps a
reckening of our years and days, yea and that he numbereth the very hairs
of our heads: do we not perceive a sufficient certainty? And so it is not
without cause that Eliphas says, that the extorcioners know not the number of
their days. And why? for they seek it with as great anguish as may be,
saying: How now? May we live yet still? Are we sure of this or that? But when
they have made their long disputations and great discourses: they always turn
back to a continual unquietness, because they rest not themselves upon Gods
providence. But we for our part must not do so, but we must pray unto him, that
after we have put our live into his hand, we may be quier, whatsoever troubles
befall us: knowing that for so much as he has made us and fashioned us, he is
able to deliver us from all dangers whenever he lists to show himself our
deliverer: and thereupon we must conclude, that he will watch over us when we be
asleep. As much is to be thought of that which Eliphas adds: namely, that
the outrageous man does always beliolde the sword, that is to say, he does
see the infinite dangers that hem him in round about, by reason where of he
qu^keth and is aghast. This agrees properly unto Tyrants. True it is that
their state may well seem to be happy. Howbeit they be so troubled in their
minds, that they perceive it to be better for them to have been of small and
bace degree, than too be so honored and feared: and yet in the mean while
they themselves are afraid, not only of men, but also of every leaf that
shakes upon a tree. Verily there was a Tiran that confessed as much. For when
one flattered him and said he was a Prince of such Majesty, as it might seem
that he was a God in the world, and that every man might desire to be in his
state: If thou that thou give me but some little taste of thy goodness, to
know that thou have received me. Thus ye see how it behooves us too desire
God too put away the gross and thick clouds that hinder us to perceive the
love that he bears toward us. Furthermore when we see the wicked in such
trouble and unquietness, let the same be a bridle unto us. For we must
profit our selves by Gods vengeances when we see them a far off upon the
wicked. We must not tarry till God bend himself against us, and til he rap
us hard upon the pates. No no* but if he

Now let us cast our selves down in the presence of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel them too our
dislyking of them, and that in the mean time we may not cease too trust,
that like as he receives wretched sinners unto mercy, which is the thing
wherein he utters the richness of his gracious goodness: so also it may
please him to make us partakers thereof: and that therewithal it may please
him also too continue that which he has begone in us, until he have
brought us too the full and whole perfection* And so let us all say, Almighty
God our heavenly father, we acknowledge and confess according too the truth,
that we be not worthy too lift up our eyes too Heaven, too present our
selves before thee, nor to presume so far as etc.

The.lx. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xv. Chapter.
23 He will trotte up and down for bread, knovving that the time of
darkness is in his hand.

24 Anguish amazeth him and overcomes him, as a king that is prepared to
battle.

25 Because he has lift up his hand against God, and strengthened himself
against the Almighty.

26 He will leap upon his neck, and crush the strongest part of his shield.

27 He has covered his face with fat, and fatted his bowels.

28 He has inhabited the desert Cities, and the ruinous houses that were
fallen down.

29 He shall not advance himself, his riches shall not continue, neither
shall there be any remainder of them.


YEsterday I showed you to how many that the wicked man shall trot up and
down for bread, knowing that the day of darkness is in his hand. Some lay
forth this sentence as if he said, that God will impouerish the wicked how
great riches so ever they have, so as they must be feign to beg. True it is
that that curse is contained in the law, and we hear also how it is said in
the Psalm, that the rightuous is never forsaken, nor his seed beg their
bread, they know that the day of darkness is in their hands. Some expound
this to be meant that the day of darkness is at hand, or else that trouble is
at their elbow: that is to say, that God will pay them such wages as they have
deserved. For whereof comes it that they be so fo(...) gred in the mids of
their abundance which God has given them, and that when he has fraughted
them with his benefits, yet notwithstanding they dare neither eat nor drink?
Whereof comes this? They be punished for their cruelty, reuenousnesse and
deceytes that they have used toward their neighbors. Ye need not seek
far for the cause wherefore they be punished after that manner. For look how
they have troubled poor folks, and raked other men's goods too them, and
raught too themselves whatsoever they could finger: so must that for as much as
he lifted up his hand against God, and strengthened himself against the
Almighty, God will take him by the neck and catch hold of the strongest and
thickest of his armor. Here the reason is rendered why our Lord sends
fearfulness upon the wicked, and why he tormenteth them, and also
disappoynteth them of all their attemptes, and turns all things clean
contrary to their intent: namely because they lifted up themselves against
him. True it is that a mortal man will be ashamed to think of making war
against God: and the wicked themselves are so far off from being acknowne
that they be minded to lift up themselves against the almighty that they
abhor the very word: but yet for all that they cease not to do it. For
proof hereof we need not to send a trumpetter to God to defy him, when we
mind to make war against him: for if we trouble our neighbor wrongfully, if
we use deceyt and extortion: behold* God sets himself against us. If we
thought we made war against him, and not against mortal creatures, would we
be so mad as to ouershoote our selves in such sort as we do? If we considered
with our selves, that God shows him self to be an enemy of the outrageous,
would we then lift up our selves after this fashion against him? And when we
fall to outrage, I pray you is it not a full incountering against God? We take
it not to be so: but yet is it so nevertheless. What should there need any
Sophistry in this behalf? As I said before, when we speak of making war
against God, it is not meant that we chalendge him by an herault with a trumpet:
but if we be so proud as to presume upon our own strength and power, to take
more upon us than God gives us leave too do: it is certain that we come to
rush against God. As much do we when we disquiet poor folk, and go about to
set our feet upon the throat of them. Therefore when we fall to aduauncing of
our selves in this wise above our bounds: it is all one as if we defied God
too his face. And so this sentence is worthy of rememberance, where Fliphas
says that God will leap in the necks of those that advance themselves after
that sort against him. He says expressly that they lifted up their hands
against God. Verily this similitude is taken of those that fight in battle,
nevertheless the meening of it extends yet further. For Eliphassis meening
is, that when men take that upon them which is not lawful for them, by using
any outrage or injury: God will take part with their neighbors against them.
True it is that when they cannot compass their matters by that means, they go
too it with some deceyt that they had strengthened themselves against the
Almighty. When he says that they strengthened themselves, he meeneth that
they hardened them selves. For how is it possible that men should gather
strength to lift up themselves against God? May it be by Almighty, in
reproching men for strengthening themselves against God. But we have yet one
other good and profitable lesson to gather hereof: which is that if we will
not have war with God, we must be well ware that we absteyne from all evil
doing and from all wrong* and we must live among our neighbors without working
them any anoyance or injury. For as soon as we do but stir one finger too
poll other men of their goods, or to trouble one and too devour another:
behold God is as it were challenged by us to make war with us, because we
have gone about evil toward them whom he has taken unto his tuicion.
We see that when earthly Princes have given their protection to any house, if
a man do them any wrong, it is not simple felony, but high treason, whereof
they will be avenged. And do we imagine that God will be less priuileged
than Princes? He has set his badge upon all poor folk, by taking them into
his own charge and protection. Now if any man come too torment them and
afflict them, will he suffer it? Then (as I said) let us learn to bridle our
selves, to the end that we use no outrage against our neighbors. And further
more also let us keep our selves from this frenzy that is spoken of here.
For we be not well in our wits if we take our selves too be mighty and
strong before God. Therefore let us advisedly walk in modesty, and
acknowledging the frailty of our nature, let us humble our selves, and let the
same serve to hold us within our bounds, and knowing that thing which God
permits us too know, let us be contented too walk plainly on our way
without running over the feeldes like stray cattle: for what else is that but
too strengthen our selves against God? when we presume to do that which God
has forbidden us, shall we esteem it too be but a single disobedience? Is
it not more than a devilish furiousness? So then let us vncace our selves out
of all pride and presumption, and simply follow that which God shows us.
And if we be tempted now and then with the said vain fancy, let us mark
well this word Almighty too bridle us withal, saying? How now? wretched
creature, what will thou do? whereupon muzest thou? For thou strengthenest thy
self in thine evil: and behold God tells thee that he will lift up
himself against thee, and thou must be feign too feel him thy foe and mortal
enemy. that distress shall light upon the wicked, and come upon him as a king
prepared to battle, or rather as it were wind about him. For the word that
Eliphas uses here, signifies a ball, or a bowl, or any round thing. For we
know, that when it comes to giving of battle, somtymes men cast themselves
in a ring according as the case requires: and so was done in old time.
Therefore this sentence may be expounded, that distress shall be as a king in
a readiness [to give battle:] and that whenever God shall send affliction
upon the wicked, it shall not be like an enemy that has no power nor
strength: but like a King that has soldiers ynowe to give his enemy the
overthrow. Or else a man may refer the said Roundnesse too the wicked,
which shall be environed on all sides, that is too say, which shall have no
way too escape. For if God seize upon him, it shall not be too beseege him on
the one side or on the other, but before and behind, on the right hand and on
the left, and he shall be so enclosed on all sides* as there shall be no
startinghole for him. And this is the most convenient interpretation. Then let
us mark well how Eliphassis meening is, that when God is minded too punish a
man, after long tariance and long sparing of him, his showing of himself too
be angry is not to be pacified by and by: but he will come about him on all
sides, so as he may never escape his hands. Thus ye see what the effect of
this sentence is. But hereupon we have yet one good lesson more to gether. For
we be put in mind that it is not for us too dally with God, that for so much as
he has fatted his eyes, forasmuch as his face strouteth with grease, for as
much as he has stuffed his belly, and forasmuch as he has over larded his
guts, and inhabited the deso'ate towns and forsaken houses: he shall come to
decay, and not prosper. Verily too the intent this sentence may be the better
understood, we must lay it forth after this manner. Although the wicked man
dwell in desert Towns, yet crammeth he his belly and his body, bearing
himself in hand that he shall make all the world new again, and that his
doings are wonderful: But yet shall all go to decay: and although he make
a fair show for a time, yet that the wicked shall not prosper. And what is
the reason? It is because he is puffed up with famesse. Will we then be
blissed of God, and be mainteyned in good state and true happiness? Let us
keep us well from pampering our selves with fatness, that is to say, let us
keep us from being pampered with pride, that we presume not too make our
selves this or that: but let us walk in all mildness, knowing that we
depend upon the hand of God, and that when he has lyfted us up, he can
also soon cast us down again. Therefore let us be moved so much the more
to serve and honor him, and let us not be so ungracious as too give him
occasion too overthrow that which he has builded, and too destroy it quite
because we would make an other Tower of Babylon, and prefume too lift up
our selves against him. Even so happens it (says Eliphas) Although the
wicked have inhabited the desert Cities, that is too say, although they have
had such scope, as it might seem they would make the world new again. For to
inhabit desert Towns, is as much as not to be contented with the possession
of things that are in good plyght, but too fight against God, that they might
be new makers of the world, and setters up of things that were destroyed.
The wicked then may well have all this outward show, but there shall be no
continuance, because they advance themselves against God. But on the
contraripart, when we be undone and stripped stark naked, then will God show
us the favor to build up again the things that are forsaken, condicionally
that we go not about it with vain pride, nor presume any thing upon our
selves, but desire him to reach us his strong hand, and so too guide and
govern us always by his holy spirit, that when he has once begone to show
his gracious favor toward us, he will continue the same and bring it to
perfection.

Now let us fall down in the presence of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him to make us feel them in such wise, as we may learn
too mislike more and more of our selves, and that forasmuch as we be so much
given to pride and vain presumption: it may please him to open our eyes, that
when we perceive our own feebleness and infirmity, we may run wholly unto
him, and in calling upon him acknowledge that we have no power too strengthen
our selves, furtherfoorth than it pleases him too quicken us that are in
death, and as it were to raise us up again to life, and moreover, that he
will mainteyne us in his favor, and make us so too feel it both in body and
soul, as we may desire nothing but to yield our selves wholly to his service,
and that by our example we may allure others too like humility, so as he may
be honored and glorified both of great and small. That for the doing hereof
it may please him too raise up true and faithful, etc.

The.lxj. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xv. Chapter.
30 He shall not depart out of darkness, the flame shall sindge his branches,
and he shall go away with the breath of his mouth.

31 He shall be deceived with vanity, and shall not stand: For vanity is his
change.

32 He shall be consumed before his time, and his branches shall not flourish.

33 He shall be bereft of his soreness, as a vine is, and God shall cast him
off as an Olife tree does his flowers.

34 The congregation of the hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall
devour the house of brybes.

35 For he conceyueth mischief and brings forth vanity, his belly prepares
deceyt.


YEsterday we saw how the despysers of God advanced themselves in such wise
as it may seem there are none but they, and that God gives them great that
the wicked shall not depart out of darkness. And herein he discerns the
children of God and the afflictions that they endure, from those whom God has
utterly rejected. For it may come to pass that we shall be in darkness as
we see the holy Prophets complain God will devour their branches: that that
the wicked shall go away with the breath of his mouth. True it is that this may
well be verified of God. For the scripture says oftentimes that God will
consume the wicked with the only breath of his mouth, to show what power he
has to punish the wicked and his enemies. God then needs not to arm him
self, neither needs he to make any preparation too punish those whom he
lists: let him but only open his mouth, and breath upon his enemies, and
behold they be out his breath, it vanishes away suddenly and becomes nothing.
Therefore let us mark well, that although the despysers of God seem to have a
lasting life: yet shall it soon vanishe away, so as it is not without cause
that they be likened to their breath. True it is that the same thing is
verefied of all men. For what are we? what firmness is there in our nature?
wherein consists our life? True it is that our souls are created after the
Image of god: but yet for all that, man's life is as a blast, and if we breath
not we be undone, with the yielding up of the gasp we be dead. that the wicked
being deceived in vanity, shall not stand out, because that vanity shall
be his change. True it is that this sentence is understood dyuersly: for the
word which we translate too stand out, is taken also too Believe. And so some
expound it that the wicked man being in vanity will not believe that vanity
shall be his change. Again, there is a double understanding in an other
word: so that whereas we read vanity, there is the word Rightnesse or
Certentie: as if it were said, that the wicked man believes it not to be
true. VVhyso? Because that vanity is his change. Nevertheless the Believe,
(if we follow that construction) we may pick out a good lesson out of it:
which is, that when God bereeueth men of their wit and discretion, they can
never receive any good warning or profitable counsel. Why so? For they are
stubborn. Then do ye see a punishment of God which we must mark well and
be afraid of it: which heart as it were tied to it. Therefore after that God
has taught us what to do: he must also immedatly therewithal give us a
mind to follow the good. And so (as I said) we may gather a good and
profitable lesson of this saying, That the wicked will not believe. And why?
Because he is deceived with vanity. And the reason is added expressly,
because that when a man is forepossessed by naughty affections, and snarled in
many errors and corruptions: ye see he is like a desperate person, and there
is no coming to him to show him his error. Howbeit wicked shall not stand
out, that is too say, shall not have any settling or continuance. Although the
despyzers of God be exalted and triumph for a time: yet have they not any
settlednesse. And why? For God leads them continually thorough backewayes, in
such sort as they find themselves beguyled and disappoynted of their hope.
And this is a very profitable lesson for us. For what is the cause that we
grudge at the wicked, and would feign be parttakers of their state? Because
we have not patience too tarrye the end of them, as it is said in the
Psalm. For if our minds were quiet, it is certain that we should shudder
at the end that is prepared for the despizers of God, because that at the
last their joy must be turned into weeping and wayling and gnashing of
teethe, God curses all their mirth, and the end of it must needs be unhappy.
But what? we raught only at the present things and run after them: our
lusts are so whot, as we have no forecare what may happen tomorrow morning.
And so much the more ought we to mark well this lesson when it is said that
the wicked man shall have no settling. By this saying the^ we be taught to
bridle our selves when we see the despizers of God have their full skope and
live at their ease, yea even while we weep and lament, so as we ouershoote
not our selves That the wicked man shall be consumed before his time, and
that his branches shall never flourish more. He shall be like a vine that has
his unripe grapes stripped of, and like an Olife tree that casts his flowers,
yea and that the same flowers shead away when there comes any froste, so as
they perish utterly. No doubt but that by these two similitudes Eliphas meant
to confirm the former sentence, that is to say, that the wicked man perishes
before he be full ripe: and it serves still too bring us back to the matter
which we have discoursed already. So then we see, that by setting before our
eyes that there is no stablenesse in the wicked, our Lord calls us to a
through continuing stablenesse which shall not be deceyuable, an Olife in the
house of the Lord, which florisheth always. Also this similitude is taken
after the same sort both in the first Psalm and in Jeremy: [where it is
mente] that if we trust in God, and run unto him, and hang upon him: we shall
be like a tree that is planted by the water or rivers side, so as we shall
always have good sap to flourish and bring forth fruit. Now seeing it is so
that God having drawn us from the corruptions and vain allureme^ts of this
world, offers us also this everlasting happiness: must we not needs be out
of our wits if we go not that the householde of the wicked shall be desolate,
and fire shall consume the house of Brybes. Under this term Hypocrite,
(according too the sense of it in other textes also, Eliphas comprehends all
such as have froward and disloyal hearts to Godwarde, that the house of
Brybes shall be consumed. Whereas he speaks of the company of Hypocrites:
it is to express the better, that although the wicked have great traynes and
great and long tails: yet for all that: they shall not miss to be consumed.
Then shall ye see far wickedder men than the common simple sort are, and
they shall carrye great companies and bands after them which make a great
show: they shall have their alliances and awe And moreover when we see the
wicked lay baits on every side, and bear themselves in hand that they have
greatly gained, when they have gotten much riches by taking of bribes and
gifts: Let us say, yet will God at length show how he has not in vain said
that which we hear in this place, and which the holy Ghost has uttered by
the mouth of Eliphas* For God will not suffer his threatenings to be in vain,
but will match the execution of the^ with them anon after* Ye see then how we
must be quiet, when we see such as rap and rend, and pill and poll on

Now let us cast our selves down in the presence of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to give us such repentance, as
we may change from our naughty life day by day, and not desire any thing
but to renounce al our naughty affections, and all things that may turn us
from his service, and the great number of wicked lusts whereunto we be
subject and given: and that for so much as we be so full of infection, it may
please him to uphold us by his mercy, and daily to pardon us our faults,
until he have fully clothed us again with his righteousness, at such time
as he shall have taken us out of this world, too make us part. takers of his
heavenly glory. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us,
but also. etc.

The.lxij. Sermon which is the first upon the.xvj. Chapter,
with a little remnant of the last verse of the fifteenth Chapter.

1 Job ansvvered and said.

2 I have often heard such things: you be all of you yrksome comforters.

3 When will there bean end of [your] vvindy words? And vvherevvith
imboldenest thou thy self to answer?

4 I could speak as you do: If your soulevvere in my souls stead I could
hold you company in talk, and I could nod my head at you.

5 I could strengthen you with words, and my talk should be to
receiuegriefe.

6 But if I speak* my sorrovve will not abate, and if I hold my peace what
relief have I?

7 He has laden me with anguish, he has made all my congregation desolate.

8 He has parched me with vvrinckles for a witness, and leanness is come
upon me, which witnesses it in my face.

9 He has torn me in his wrath, he has handled me furiously* he grindeth
his teeth at me, and mi(...)emie sharpeneth me and stareth with his eyes
against me.


AFter that Eliphas has told us, that the wicked and despizers of God are
cursed, and all their matters go against them: for a conclusion he adds,
that they conceive sorrow, and bring forth pain, and their belly breeds
craft and deceyte. Whereby he does us too wit, that all the outward
shows which wicked folks have, boot them not awhit, but God turns them
clean contratie too their that manner. In the six and twentieth Chapter of the
Prophet Esaias it is said, Lord we have traueled before thy face as a woman
with child, and yet have conceived and brought forth nothing but wind.
Verily it is the faithful that speak and complain in that wise before God.
Howbeeit they acknowledge and confess their sins. For at that time when they
said they traueled as a woman with child, God did persecute them justly for
their offenses. But they say they conceived and brought forth wind: that is to
say, as soon as they looked for some ease for his sins sake, and that God had
not any such intent. Not that he felt not himself faulty, and worthy too
endure yet more, if God listed too examine him with rigor: but because he
knew that God handled him not so for his sins sake, but had another intent.
Job knowing this, rejects the talk that they hild with him. And why? Because
it was unreasonable. You are yrksome comforters to me says he. And what is
the reason? Because they brought not convenient remedies. Hereby we be
warned, that if we mind too comfort our neighbors in their heaviness and
troubles, When will there be an end of your wyndy words? He terms
those words wyndy, wherein there is no substance: that is too say, which
are not able too edifye a man, according as the holy Scripture uses the same
similitude. For when it is required that a man should be taught how too
obtain his Salvation: It is said, he is edifyed. How? Even because he is
first founded, and afterward builded upon, so as he is confirmed in the
fear of God, he is confirmed in his law, he is confirmed That if his
friends were in his case, he could speak as they do, and hold them
company in talk, and plead with them, and nod his head at them. Truly some
expound this sentence, that Job would not render the like unto them if he
saw them in like trouble, but would rather indeuer too assuage their miseries
and too give them some relief, than increase their sorrow as they did
toward him, according as we have seen their unmercifulness, how there was
none other talk among them but too drive this holy person too despair, if
God had not hilde him up. They that take the sentence in that sense, are
moved thereto by this reason: namely that it were an unseemly matter that
Job would be desirous of reuengemente when God had withdrawn his hand from
him, and that he would then mock poor men that were in like calamity,
when he were at his ease. For although there were none other cause but the
affliction that he himself endured, yet should the same teach him too have
pity and compassion upon such as had need of it. But when all is well
considered: Job meeneth not too show here what he would do, but what a man
might do if he were in like plyghte. Therefore he meeneth not that he
would be even with them that had troubled him wilfullye, but only that he
could be merry, if he were as they were. Then in effect he meeneth thus:
you talk well at your ease, ye shake your heads at me, ye pass not of
condemning me, no nor to plunge me into the bottomless pittes. And thus ye
do as folk that know not what it is too endure misery. If I were in your
case, could I not do as much? And how would you take it if I should come
shake my head at your calamities when I saw the hand of God nippe you with
extremity? If I should say, O it is well bestowed, God must be feign to
chastize you and to make you feel how he punishes sinners. If you were
overwhelmed with misery, and I should speak to you after that sort, might
ye not say I were a skorner and a cruel person. Then bethink your selves
well. I will now bold my peace, but what shall that profit me? And if I
speak, what ease shall I have by it? Here Job intends too preuente the
objection that might have been laid against him. For his friends might have
said. Then comfort thy self seeing thou art so well able too do it: and
seeing that thou could work woonders if we were in case as thou art, go
too now and show thy cunning upon thy self. But he says, I see my self
in as miserable case as may be. So then know not what I may hope, for God
pincheth me after so strange a fashion, that if I speak, I do but increase my
sorrow, and if I hold my peace I am never the more eased. Behold I am a man
swallowed up with adversity. Thus ye see what Job meante to say in effect:
namely that whether he spoke, or whither he hilde his peace, he was no way
eased. Mark also how David in the two and thirtith Psalm complayneth, that
his adversity did so pinch him and streyne him, that he wist not where to
become nor what shifte to make. When I lament (says said we might know
that after as God gives great virtues unto men, so does he exercise them
lively, to the intent that those virtues should not be idle, but that they
should be known in due time and place. Besides this, let us mark by the way,
that the chiefest temptations that ever the faithful endured, were these
spiritual battles as we term them: that is to wit, when God summoned them
in their consciences, so as he made them to feel his wrath, by smyting them in
such wise as they wist not in what case they stood with him. And this pludged

Now let us cast our selves flat before the face of our good God and father
with acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us feel them in such
wise, that being touched with true repentance, we may return unto him,
knowing that he will be favorable to us. And after we have desired him to
forgive us our sins, let us also beseech him to rid us more and more of our
fleshly vices, and that in correcting the sinfulness of our nature, he will
bring us to perfection of life, that being guyded in this world by his holy
spirit, we may glorify his name, and serve him with an earnest zeal,
dedicating our selves wholly unto him, according as he has provoked us by his
goodness to do. That it may please him, etc.

The.lxiij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xvj. Chapter.
10 They open their mouth against me, they give me buffets in way of
reproach, and they gather themselves to gither against me.

11 God has put me into the hands of the malicious, he has dismayde me
before the wicked.

12 I prospered and he threvve me down, he has caught me by the neck, and
set me as a butte before himself.

13 His Archers hem me in on all sides, he slitteth my reins, he spares me
not, he pours my gall upon the ground.

14 He has broken me with breaking upon breaking, and he has run over me
as a Giant.

15 I have sowed sackcloth upon my skin, and laden my glory with dust.

16 My face is vvexed blevve with weeping, and mine eyeliddes are covered
with the shadovve of death.

17 Yet is there no guile in my hands, and my prayer is pure.


IT is a very grievous and hard thing to a mortal man when God sets
himself against him, and makes him too That the wicked have opened their
mouth to mock at him, and that they have buffeted him in way of reproach, and
that they have assembled together. When men set them selves after that sort
against us, it renueth the misery that we endure. Why so? For the Devil
serves his own turn by such as scoff at us, to spite us, and to overthrow
and root up our faith utterly, if it be possible. And Job speaks here
expressly of the wicked for two considerations. For there is not an irkesomer
thing than when God does after that manner give bridle to the wicked, to
persecute his children, and That God has also delivered him into the hands of
the wicked: which saying is well worthy to be noted. For we imagine that the
wicked do what they list, and we consider not that God gives them the bridle
so far forth as he himself lists, and that they can not pass any further
than he gives them leave from above. This (as I said) deserves well to be
noted. For if we be forepossessed with the opinion, that the wicked are not in
Gods hand, but may take as much scope as they list and God will not redress
it: what will come of it? Must we that he had been beaten down, and
astonished, and that God had caught him by the neck^ and rent him in pieces,
and set him before him as a butte to shoot at, and that his Archers had hemmed
him on all sides, that he had slitte him asunder, yea and that he had broken
him and broken him again. Hereby Job shows, that he was come to such
extremity of afflictions, as it was impossible to find a creature that were
more pressed or more miserable than he. For we have seen how God afflicted
him, as well in his body as in his goods, and also by his own wife. Ye see
then that Job might well liken himself to a mark that men shoot at. For God
sent him not some one kind of adversity alone, but did as it were dig a
pit down to hell to cast him the deeper into it. And afterward he loded
him with such a weight as was impossible for any creature too bear, if he had
not a greater strength than is in man. And soothly it was a marvel to have such
a constancy, notwithstanding the infirmities that we see in him. For when God
strengthens his own, it is not by making them utterly insensible, nor yet by
taking their feebleness quite away: But they must be feign to acknowledge
themselves such as they be, that is too wit, frail creatures: and yet in
the mean season God releeueth their infirmity and sets them up again when
they be cast down. Thus ye see what happened unto Job. Now by the way he
says, that he clothed himself with sackcloth, and covered his head with
duste, and that he did it not by hypocrisy. Besides this, he says that none
of all these things besell him for his misdeedes. For there is no Robbery
(say the he) to be found in my hands, and my prayer is pure. VVherby he
meeneth that he thinks his afflictions strange, since he had not offended
God in such sort as he might deserve to be so handled. This is the temptation
that we have seen so often before, which Job calls still to rememberance.
But now let us lay forth the matters particularly and apply them to our use.
The similitude that Job uses, imports a good Lesson: [which similitude is,]
that God has set him as a white in a butte, and that he has set his Archers
against him, and besette him round about, and that they have after such a sort
torn him in pieces, that his gall is tumbled out upon the ground, that is to
say, that he was wounded to the very heart. By speaking so, Job mente too
express that God afflicted him not after the common manner. But now let us
look to our selves: for if we suffer never so little adversity, we think
it over great, and that God keeps no measure. It is pity to see how nyce
we be, and there needs no more, to hold us skirmish to the uttermost. So
long as it were but a making of some moan, it might be thought to be but a
part of feblenesse. But when me^ make such a stir that they lift up themselves
against God for any common adversity that they have to abide: is it not an
ouergreat impaciencie? Is it not a sign that we were never in Gods school to
learn what it is to suffer and to yield obedience to his will? So then, to the
end we may learn to be more strong to endure the chastizementes that God
sends that his gall was poured out upon the ground, and that his kidneyes
were open and shredde in pieces: let us bear in mind that which I have
touched before: that is too wit, that when God punishes and pursues us with
extremity, and that his hand becomes so grievous and ouerheauie that we can
no more bear it: we must not therefore be too much discouraged, and as it
were dulled: but let us beethinke us of that which Job knew: which is, that
for so much as we have too do with God, let us sighe and groan with all
humility, according also as he himself adds, saying that his eyes and all
his face were blubbered with weeping, that he had sowed sackclothe upon his
skin, and that he had covered his head with duste. What led Job to do
so? Verily because he knew that Gods hand was upon him, and that of all the
miseries that were light upon him, none came of fortune, but all of Gods
visitation. Had not Job been persuaded of that, what had it booted him too have
put on sackcloth upon his back next his skin, and to have cast dust upon his
head? True it is that they which think not at all upon God, fail not to
make great complaynts and to weep and howl: but to wear sackcloth aright,
they shall never do it except they have an eye unto God. By the way, although
the Hypocrites know not God aright, yet have they some conceit of him when
they show such signs of repentance. True it is that if we saw them within, we
should find nothing in them but fainednesse: nevertheless, the Ceremony
whereof Job speaks, is a sure sign that men are informed to confess that
that he clothed himself with sackcloth, and covered his head with dust.
Surely these things were signs of repentance, like as when a wretched offender
will sue for grace, he will not cloth himself in wedding apparel, he will
not come combed and frisled and in a bravery before his judge: but he will
rather come so as he may move him too compassion, I say he will come with a
sorrowful and heavy countenance, he will come coursly apparelled as a
mourner. And so the faithful have had the outward signs of repentance when God
afflicted them, and have confessed their sins that they might obtain
forgiveness: their wont was to cloth them selves in hair and sackcloth, and
to cast dust upon their heads, and their so doing was allowed of God. Why
so? For first of all, men had need to quicken up themselves, because they be
slow and cold. Therefore when they take convenient help too spur them
selves forward, it is not superfluous, sith we know that when it comes to
the humbling of our selves before God: we go so lazily to it, as it is not but
for fashions sake. We can well say we be faulty, and we can well cast
forth some sighs. But in the mean season we consider not our offenses: the
number of them is infinite, and they be excessiuely great, as we ought of
right to be dismayed with fear of death, when we come before our judge.
Nevertheless to our seeming it is enough to cast forth a sigh or twain, and
away. Seeing then that there is such a coldness in us, let us assure our
selves that we have need to be spurred like Asses. Lo whereunto the sackcloth
and dust of the ancient fathers served. For when they used this said
Ceremony, it was not for naught. Also it behooves us too come unto God when
we cast dust upon our heads. For was not the body created by him? Then like
as we must have our hearts settled [vpon God] so must our bodies also be
answerable thereunto, and all the whole man must be dedicated unto God and do
him homage. Now then we see that these things were no fond trifles, when the
ancient fathers ware hair and Sackcloth on their backs, and therewithal did
also cast dust upon their heads. And that is it which Job meant by speaking so.
Nevertheless the Prophet Ioell says, Rende your hearts and not your
garments. His meaning there is nor to reiecte those outward signs: but he
that there was no extorcion or robbery in his hands, and that his prayer had
been pure. Job adds this (as I said) to signify that such manner of
affliction was strange to him. For so has he spoken heretofore. And surely
when so ever God afflicts us, behold what we must do, we must enter into
our selves and examine our own lives, and thereupon according as we have
offended, so must we lament before God, and say: Alas Lord thou afflictest me
sore in deed, but if I compare my faults, and wey them in the balance with the
adversity that I endure, Alas Lord I know I have offended thee so many
ways, that if thou should plunge me even in hell, I were well worthy of
it. Lo what we have to do. But if we perceive not that God afflicts us for
our sins, that is a very sore temptation to us. [And we fall to reasoning in
our selves,] how now? What have I trespassed? Wherefore does God handle me
so rigorously? I see he spares the wicked: I have indeuered to serve him with
a good and upright conscience: In deed I come far short of discharging my
duty thoroughly: But yet have I ever kept on forward: and yet notwithstanding
I am used as the unhappiest and curse dst creature that the earth bears. And
what is meant by this geere? Ye see here a great temptation, and such a one as
is able to dismaye us, according as befell to Job. But what is to be done in
this behalf? First let us be well advised that we may be like to Job, so as
we may say that there is not extortion in our hands. For it is an easy
matter for a man to vaunte and brag of his soundness, as we see that the
wickedd est sort are not ashamed to do. And now adays if a man admonishes
them of their misdoings, O there is nothing but perfection in them, and the
diuelishest of them all would be esteemed as half Angels. So then (as I said)
let us for our part search thoroughly what is in us without flattery, and let us
not protest that we have clean hands, except we be thoroughly like unto
Job: and for performance of that, we must not be our own judges to judge after
our own fancies. After what manner is it that men ought to examine our lives,
or in what form should they frame their indictment? It must not be with
saying, I ween I suppose, I take it so, or I ween not. All this stuff must
be laid away. What then? Let us come to Gods law, and pray him to inlighten
us with his holy spirit, that we may thoroughly search out our own darkness
for the sins that are in us are terrible lurkingholes. God therefore must
be feign too light us up a Cresset, and to give us wisdom and discretion to
know and understand our faults in such wise as we may confess them. Thus
ye see what we have to do. But let us put the case that Gods handling of us
so is not for our sins, as in good sooth he mente no such thing toward
Job as to punish him for his deserts. Wherefore did he it then? He
intended to try his patience. God then may afflicte the good men more than

Now let us fall down before the presence of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us know them in such wise
(so far forth as is expedient for us) as that therewithal he comfort us
by his goodness, and so reform us by his holy spirit, as we may not need
to be persecuted roughly at his hand, but that as soon as he gives any
inckling, we may be thoroughly moved to humble our selves under him. And that
it may please him to accept our prayers, not only for our selves, but also
for all those that have need in these days, according as we see how sore the
whole wretched world is plagued. Wherefore let us beseech our good God to
look upon it with the eye of pity, that by reason of the spreading out of his
mercy upon us, and upon all Nations of the earth, we may have occasion to
sound forth his praises every where. And so let us say, Almighty God our
heavenly father, we acknowledge and confess, etc.

The.lxiiij. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xvj. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the.xvij. verse, and then upon the text that
follows.

18 O earth, hide thou not my blood, neither let there be any place for my
cries.

19 For even now is my witness in heaven, and he that vvarrant eth me is in
the highest places,

20 My friends are Rhetoricians against me, and mine eyes pour out tears
unto God.

21 O that it were lavvfull for man to reason with God, as with the son of
man his neighbor.

22 Behold the short years shall slide away, and I enter into the way by
the which I shall not come back again.


JOB intending too make protestation of his own vpryghtnesse, sets down
here two things, that is too wit, that he has not delte amiss toward
men, and that he has called upon God purely. And that was by referring his
life too the law, because that there our Lord shows both how we must
serve him, and how we must be him, as who should say, he had not procured
them any harm or loss. True it is that we may do some wrong and injury
without any show of violence. But for as much as when men give themselves too
harmefulnesse, they starte out of their bounds, and streyne themselves too
rack one, to pill another, and to devour the third: therefore Job purposely
says, that there had been no ravening in his hands. As much is meant by the
second saying For the serving of God consists not only in the exercise of
prayer: But for so much as that is the chief point: Prayer, here is mention
made of the whole service of God: we ought to weye the same thoroughly. For the
most part of men think not at al of praying unto their hope of salvation, why
they flee to her, and why every one of them has his several Saint to be his
patron: if a man tell them it is blasphemy against God: it is very hard to
make them believe so. And why? Because they never knew nor tasted of that which
the holy Scripture utters so diligently: that is to wit, that to serve God
aright, it behooves us to pray unto him. prayer, Job meant to show that he
had served God purely. And so if men will now give proof of their
uprightness: let them not allege their Gewgawes, as the hypocrites are wont
to do, saying, Have we not fasted? have we not done this or that? But we
must understand, that our Lord will have us ruled after his law, and he
will have the whole authority over us. Mark that for one point. Furthermore
we have also to note, that our prayer shall never be pure before God, nor
acceptable unto him, unless our hands be clear from violence. And why? If
we be cruel and wrangling with our neighbors, God puts us back, and we
have no access unto him. True it is that many do give the adventure to pray
unto God: although they be full of ravening, and have troubled one, and
tormented an other: yet cease they not to be hardy enough to call upon God.
But surely their prayers are abominable, because their hands are stained with
blood, that is to say, with wicked doings. And here ye see also why God
complayneth by his Prophet Esaias, that the Jews came to wear the pauement of
his Temple: And so he mocketh them, meening that he likes not their coming
to his Temple, and of their making of resemblance as though they meant to
worship him. For (says he) your hands are full of blood: that is to say, ye
have not ceased to anoy and hurt your neighbors. Now think you that I will
give you access to me, or that I will have any acquaintance with you? Thus ye
see in effect what we have to consider in this sentence. And now Job adds,
O earth, bide not my blood, neither let my tears take place. Some have
misinterpreted this sentence, that the earth bideth not the blood. For they
understood it that Job should wish to have his miseries known, and that for as
much as he was afflicted after so excessive a fashion, he desired that his
blood might not be hidden, but that the earth might cry for vengeance of it.
But to what purpose were that? He was not plagued by men. And meant he that the
earth should ask vengeance against God? Again on the otherside, the text
declares it self anon after: And needs must a man shet his own eyes if he
will be ouerseene in so easy a matter. For Job here touches two points. The
one is in these words, O earth hide not my blud, and the other is in these,
neither let my cries take place. What meeneth he by wishing that his cries
should not take place? It is as much to say, as when he has ouerlaboured
himself in crying and turmoyling, it shall be but labor lost, because God
refuses it. And that if he come to men, he shall gain nothing by it. Sith
the case stands so, we may easily conclude, that in saying, O earth, hide
not my blood, he grants that if he have done amiss, the matter shall come
to account and judgment, and all his whole life shall be laid before him, and
his indictment shall be framed with extremity, and God will handle him
according to his deserts. And doubtless, in the holy Scripture the word
Blood, is oftentimes taken for all horrible crimes. [As for example.] Lord
deliver me from blood: that is to say, Lord deliver me from all the deadly
sins that I have committed. Wherefore we see that Job in this place terms
all the tra^sgressions and crimes that he might have committed, by the name of
his Blood. And that is according to his matter. For he had said that his
hands were clear from rauin. Also now I see my witnesses in heaven, and he
that warranteth me is in the highest places. My friends play the orators
against me, and mine eyes gush out tears unto God. Here Job appealeth unto
God as the only competent judge, because he had been wrongfully condemned by
men. And he doubts not to appeal unto God, for as much as he knows his
case is good. True it is (as I have said already) that he missehandleth his
case: how be it in so doing he had just cause to maintain his own
soundness. Ye see then that the cause why he is not afraid to appeal unto
God, is for that he sees that men do persecute him wrongfully. But let us
consider what a one Job was, to the intent we use not such rash boldness as
most men do. When the matter comes to calling of God to witness, I pray you
who is he that makes any cursie or conscience at it. The world now adays is
full of forswearing, and there is no faithfulness in it. Whereof co^mes this?
It is because we have no feeling of Gods justice, but we come rushing against
his seat like wild beasts. For what is perjury or forswearing? It is a
spiting of God, as though he had neither might nor authority to punish us.
We can not deny but it is so when we call God to be our witness and
judge. He therefore that swears falsely, does mock Gods majesty to his
face: and yet for all that we see that men make not much account of it. Then is
it apparent hereby, that we bear small reverence too the Majesty of God.
Wherefore so much the more ought we to mark that which I said: namely,
that we must not be so bold in protesting before God, and in calling him
too record: but we must go too it as if we were at the point to yield an
accounte before him. After the same manner was Job summoned, as we have seen
heretofore, and shall see yet more fully hereafter. Nowadays if a man be
accused of any crime, although he be taken tardie, yea and utterly convinced:
yet will he make no conscience Behold (says Job) even now is my record in
heaven. Under this word Even, or Also, he comprehends, that he may well
take men to witness with him, but he passes yet further, and comes even
unto God. And that ought to be weyed. For whereas hypocrites call God too
witness, they dare not put themselves to the trial of men. If there be a
wicked person that is notoriously known too be such a one, so he be not
cast in prison, or so he be not a drawing to the gallows, he will brag of
his honesty to the vttermoste: and yet in the mean while every man will
condemn him, yea and in stead of three or four Judges, he shall have a
hundred or a thousand. For every man will say, Mark me yonder
naughtypacke, mark me yonder Thief, mark me yonder murderer, mark me
yonder extortioner, yonder swearer, yonder extortioner, yonder swearer, yonder
despizer of God. And yet for all this, such manner of men are so shameless,
that they make no bones to take God to record of their honesty, and too
proteste that he knows them, and that they be ready to answer before him,
where as if the matter come but too the trial of men, they should have a
thousand voices too condemn them, as I have touched already. And how dare
they then present themselves before God? Because they conceive not his
Majesty. Lo why we ought too weye well this word Even, says Job. For he
presupposes that he may call men to record, and that every man will bear
witness with him, that he had so behaved himself as that he had been an
eye to the blind, a guardian too the fatherless, a defender of the widows,
that he had served in stead of legs to the Cripples, and that his hand had
never been shet too the poor, as we see he makes his protestations
afterward. For Job had walked in such wise before men, as he says he
might come even before God also, which is a great thing. Also we see how
he magnifyeth here the witness of heaven. And by this it is well too be
coniectured, that he flung not out at adventure too iustifye himself with
unbridled liberty as these mockers do, who proteste with their mouth that
God knows them, and yet their life is so villainous as the very air stinketh
of it, and the very babes can skyll too speak of it. Thus ye see what we
have too mark in this text. Afterward he adds, that his friends playde
the Orators against him: and that in the mean while his eyes poured out
tears before God. Here Job shows why he is feign too refer himself too
Gods judgment: namely, because he fyndeth no reason nor uprightness among
men. Surely it is a very great temptation when we be plagued, and that the
world takes us to be forsaken of God: for it is a policy of the Devils too
drive us too despair. When a poor man is smitten with Gods rods, the
misery that he indureth is heavy inoughe of it self: now if one come and
lay a double load upon his back, by casting him in the teeth how it
appears plainly that he is utterly forsaken of God: it is enough to
ouerwhelme him. For I speak not of the wicked stubborn sort, whom God
plagueth for their sins: but I speak of such as have walked uprightly, and
yet notwithstanding God has not missed too afflict them. True it is that they
have well deserved it: but he has not always an eye unto that. Now and then
he intends too mortifye them for the time to come. Because they be not yet
sufficiently tamed, he is feign to cut away all the leude affections that are
in them. And furthermore he will have them learn that it is needful for them
too pray unto him, and to put their whole trust in him: and finally he will have
their patience showed. Thus ye see, that a good man, which tends too Godward,
and walks plainly, shall notwithstanding have great plagues. Now is that a
proof that God takes My friends (says he) play the Orators against me. He
meeneth that they which ought to have comforted that it were lawful for him
to plead with God as a mortal man does with his equal. But (says he) the
short days slide away, and I enter into the way by which I shall not come
back ageyn. When Job wishes that it were lawful for him to plead with God,
it is according to that which we have seen already. For hereby he shows
that his chafing is because the misery that he endured was so grievous as he
could not bear it any more. But in so doing he did amiss. It is not for us
to accuse Job in all points: but let us have an eye to that which I have
said, namely, that where as he had a good matter, yet he was carried away and
ouershot himself [in the handling of it.] And why was that? For had he known
his own transgression, and the faults that he had committed, he had submitted
himself quietly to Gods will, and not entered intoo any pleading or
faultfinding. He had said before, how he knew that the Angels were not clear
before God: and that there was such a perfect righteousness in God, as that
all that ever the creatures can bring, must of necessity be naught worth:
insomuch that if the brightness of the Sun do dim the Stars, much rather
must Gods righteousness swallowe up all the righteousness that we suppose
our selves to have. Job therefore spoke after that manner. But if he had well
remembered the said consideration [of Gods righteousness:] he would not have so
ouershot himself, as to say, I would it were lawful for me to go to law
with God. But (as I have touched already) albeit that he knew this doctrine:
yet was his passion so vehement, as he forgate himself. And hereby we be
warned, so to bear away the things which we read in the holy Scripture, as
we may learn too bridle our passions when we be tempted to impaciencie, or
any other vice: and as the thing that we have learned by Gods word, may be
sufficient to draw us from the trouble that rises up against us. Saint Paul
says, that the Gospel is of power to subdue all things that lift up
themselves against God. Behold our wits, behold our fleshly affections,
and see how they lift up themselves against God and bid him battle. What is
to be done? They must be hilde in captivity, that is too say, what soever it
be that we find in us, and in our nature too be against God and his
doctrine, we must subdue it by force. Thus ye see a perfect constancy
wherein it behooves us to continue. Therefore when we fall to disputing of this
and that, and specially when we come too encountering: let us shrink down
meekely like silly sheep, and let us always conclude: God is my judge, and
there is nothing too be found fault withal in him: though I had liberty too
plead, yet should my case quayle: for I could not allege one point for
myself, but he would allege a thousand against me. Ye see then that we
must glorifye God without standing in contention with him, yea even although
it were lawful for us to plead for our selves. And here ye see also why our
Lord (of purpose to convince me^ the more) does now and then say, Go to, let us
go to law together: as he does chiefly by his Prophet Esaias. I am content (says
he) to go to law with you, let us have a judge or an vmper, and let it be
tried who has wrong, or who has right. Whereof can ye accuse me? What harm
have I done you? But contrariwise, I can accuse you of such points and such.
It is out of all doubt, that there is no judge between God and us. Why then
uses he such manner of speech? He lets himself down from his Majesty and
highness, and shows that if he were a creature, and that there were an
vmper or dayesman appointed, so as he should be feign too abide another
bodies judgment: yet could not men clear themselves of that which he had to
allege against them. We see then

Now let us cast our selves down in the presence of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him to make us feel them in such wise,
that being ashamed of them, we may flee no whither else for succor but to his
mercy, and that we may know how needeful the same is for us, and thereupon
embrace it. And therwithall also let us learn to be displeased with our
selves for our sins, so as we flatter not our selves in them, as we have bin
wont to do: but that we may be more and more clenzed from all our own
filthiness, and be clothed over with his righteousness, which is as yet but
a little begone in us. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only
to us, but also to all people and Nations of the earth, etc.

The.lxv. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xvij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the last verse of the xvj. Chapter, and then
upon the text that follows.

MY breath is unsavory, my days are at an end, and the graves are upon me.

2 There are dallyers with me, and mine eye abides in their bitterness.

3 I pray thee lay down a guage, give a pledge for thee: who is he that
will touch in my hand?

4 Because thou have covered their heart, that they can have no understanding,
thou vvilt not exalt them.

5 Verily as for those that speak flatteries to their friends, the eyes of
their children shall fail.


AFter that Job had made protestation of his innocence (as we have seen:) he
adds that the same booteth him not, I go (says he) intoo the path whereby I
shall never return again. And anon he adds a complaynt of the shortness of
our life, meening thereby that God ought to handle men less rigorously, seeing
they do but pass away over the earth. Afterward he confirms this matter new
again, saying, that his breath is unsavory or his breath is quite spent, and
he has no more lustiness in him, so that there remains nothing for him but
the grave: on which side so ever he turn him he rest upon gods promises, and
comfort himself with them yet notwithstanding he ceasseth not to be disquieted
and troubled in himself. We shall not overcome temptations at the first
pushe: but we must be fayn to fight with great force and difficulty. When we
have such a battle, we may well say with Job, that we see nothing but the
Grave, that our breath is forespente, that our liuelynesse is cut away, and
that there is no more recovery. We may then say so: for ought that we see:
howbeit as soon as we have espied out our miseries and felt them, we My
breath is forespent says Job. And in good sooth what is the lustiness of all
men? It is but a blaste. Again, were our life as long as we would wish: yet
Graves, that we be besieged, not with any one kind of death, but with many.
We have but one life, yea and the same is very flightfull, consisting in one
blast which is nothing. But if we look nerely about us, whole hundreds of
deaths beset us round about. And so ye see why Job uses the plural number
Graves. It had been enough for him too have said, The grave is prepared for
me, I cannot escape: but he says, The graves are prepared for me. And
needs one man any more than one pit? No: but Job meeneth, that as soon as
he were never so little passed out of one death, another should wait for
him, yea and another after that, and too be short, he should be feign too
perish, though he had passed never so many dangers. True it is, that we
come not all intoo such extremities as Job was at. But yet is there none of us
that finds not himself in the same case: that is too say, that he has but
one life among a number of deaths that are ready for us. What is too be
done then? We must learn too pray unto our God, and to betake our life
intoo his hands, too the end we may be sure of it. Seeing then that it
pleases God too be the keeper of our life, let us walk on our course
without ouermuche carfulness. Again, though there were a thousand deaths
ready too swallowe us up: God is strong enough too pluck us out of them, as
it is said in the Psalm, that it is he that has the issues or outegoings of
death in his hand: that is too say, he has the means whereby too deliver
us, yea even although the same be incomprehensible too us. Nevertheless,
let us hereby take warning to be always ready too depart out of the
world, and not be too much wedded to our being here by low. For what should
we gain by it? So then let us always have the one foot lyfted up as if
we should enter intoo our grave, and let us go lustily too it, making this
conclusion with our selves, that we go not thither to tarry there for ever,
but that our Lord has showed us in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that he will not have us too perish in death, nor too abide in rottenness
for ever. But let us proceed further. It is said, Of a truth there be
Dallyers with me, and mine eye continues in their bitterness. Here Job
finds fault with those that came too comfort him, and did nothing else but
put him too more trouble. He terms them Dallyers, that scoff at folk in
adversity, because they came not too judge of his affliction with compassion
and humanity as they ought to have done, and so he adds that they could
bring nothing but vexation too grieve him the more, and that he was feign to
behold still the misery and bitterness that they had procured him. And
hereby we be advertised that if we will comfort the sorrowful and afflicted
aright: we must not come with an unkindly heart as it were of steel or of
iron, but we must be pitiful. Then must not a man think himself meet to
comfort such as are in trouble and incomberance, except he cloth him self
with their passions: that is to say, except he do as it were put himself into
their case. It is true. For such as to their own seeming are stoutest to
comfort poor folk in distress, shall do them small good, if they come but
with tongue and with breuerie of gay words. They may well discourse of matters:
but it shall be to no purpose. For it is impossible for us to use the doctrine
that shall be fit to assuage the greefes of our neighbors, unless we feel
them, and be touched with them ourselves. Therefore let us mark well by the
word Dallyers, that all such as are God to lay down a gage, and to give a
pledge, or too put in a surety. Who is he (says Job) that will touch [me]
in my hand? He returns too the matter that was declared yesterday, which is,
that he would feign go to law with God, yea and do it as with his fellow or
his equal. For why demands he a gage? why demands he a surety or Who
is he that will touch me in the hand. It is as much to say, as who is he
that will undertake too be surety for me? For men used that ceremony: and
like as now adays men sign a paper in the hand of a judge or of a notarie: so
in those days the parties touched one another in the hand, too give their
faith and to bind them selves. Ye see then what Jobs meening was. But ye
would know whither this demand of his were to be excused, in that he desired
God that he might plead against him? It is very certain that it was not to
be excused. For (as I touched glauncingly yesterday) we ought too desire,
nothing more, than to come before God, and to have him to be our judge, yea and
that he should handle us as he lists himself. True it is that if he should
utter his rigor against us, there were no shift but we should be confounded.
VVo be to those wretched creatures that come to be judged rigorously and
without mercy. But forasmuch as God loves us, too receive us through the
forgiveness of our sins which he offers us, and shows himself to be
at one with us in our Lord Jesus Christ, and pronounces all them blissed
whose sins are forgiven: when we hear of these things, can we wish a better
case than to come before the face of him that takes away our sins, and
casts them behind his back, and into the bottom of the Sea as it is said*
And specially let us look upon our Lord Jesus Christ, too whom all power
of judgment is given, which serves to maynteyne our case, and he is our
advocate. Think we not that he will make the bitter death auaylable which he
endured for us? So then, if men were as well aduyzed as they ought to be: there
were nothing too be more wished, than to be judged at Gods hand, at leastwise
so they had recourse to his mercy, and yielded themselves intoo the hands of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who will not judge us to our condemnation, but rather
acquit us. And why? For in that behalf we may say with Saint Paul, It is
God that acquitteth us, who shall condemn us? Who shall accuse us, seeing
that Jesus Christ is our advocate that defends our case, and the party that
answers for us before God his father? Shall we now fear too be accused or
condemned? But what? Job has uttered himself here, in such wise as he
found himself turmoyled with his own passions and torments: and hereby we
be taught to repress our own naughtiness. Why so? For we see what the
inordinatenesse of our nature is. If we give our affections head, whereto
must we come? Job desires to go to law with God. Alas, and can he prevail in
his suit? No, he desires too be utterly overwhelmed. As much would we do,
were it not that God restreyneth us by gyuing us the grace too subdue our
passions. Then let us mark well, first that when men suffer themselves too be
carried away by their fleshly affections, they ouershoote themselves so far, and
become so hardharted, as they make no bones to rush against God: and that is a
horrible thing. For there is not that man of us which abhors not to advance
himself after that sort against god: but yet for all that, we do so, and it is
an ordinary vice among us. What is to be done heerevpon? We must learn to
bridle our affections, seeing they be so furiouse and do arm us after that
manner against God. For this example is set before us, to the end that every of
us should indeuer to repress them as much as in us lies. Mark that for one

Again, let us not desire too diminish the majesty of God for the easing of
our selves. For if his hand be ouerstrong and ouerheauie upon us when he
afflicts us: let us assure our selves that he vpholdeth us by a far
stronger and mightier puissance. When our Lord visits us and sends us any
affliction, well, we may then say, here is a burden too heavy for me to
bear, I can no more endure it. But when we be so feeble, let us consider a
little by what means we hold out but one minute of Because thou have covered
their heart that they can have no understanding, thou will not exalte them.
Here Job strengthens himself against those that vexed him under the color
of comforting him. But we have to remember what has been said: namely that Job
bewrays all his affections, and so it is no wonder though he continue not
all in one tale, but shift eft into one matter and eft into another, and so
show himself variable. And wherefore is that? Because he speaks as in his
combat. We know that when a man is fighting of a combat, he keeps not
always one countenance, but is feign to trauerse his ground, to fet a compass
about, to shift hands, to retire, and to auaunce forewarde, after as his
enemy preaceth upon him or as he himself espyeth his own advantage. Even
so is it with us when we fall to resisting of our temptations. Sometimes we
stoop to save our selves, and sometimes we give back too avoid a blow.
After as God gives us respit, so take we heart again, and are relieved when
it was lykely we should have been overthrown. The thing therefore that we see
here in Job, is that now he takes courage and says: Lord it is true that it
is a corzie to me to see my friends become dalyers, and to do nothing else
but vex me: but yet must I not discomfort my self for all that. And why? For
I see well they have none understanding, and therefore I must not take hold of
them, seeing there is no reason in them. If a beast came running upon me, or
if a dog hild me at a bay: I might well use fair words to appeaze them,
but it could not prevail, for they understand them not. So then, o Lord, I
must not take it too heart when I hear the wandering talk of these men here.
Why so? Because thou have covered their heart that they can have no
understanding. And this is it that I have touched already: namely that if we
will comfort wretched folk in their afflictions: we must desire God too give
us his spirit and wisdom to do it withal. For our talk shall be vain and
unprofitable, saving so far forth as he reaches us his hand: like as on the
contrary part, we shall speak to edifying if he guide us. It is said that he
covers their heart, that they might have none understanding: as if a man
should say, he blyndfoldeth their eyes. For in the scripture, this word Heart
is sometimes taken for the mind. In deed it is not taken so continually, for
it is sometimes taken for a trueness, and for a pure conscience. Heart is taken
there for the mind. Even so is it also in this sentence. Job therefore meeneth
that God has as it were blyndfolded the eyes of these men here which thought
themselves very wise, and that thereby they became as good as beasts. Now let
us mark what manner of men these friends of Job were. It is evident by their
talk that they were excellent men, and no fools. For we see they were men of
experience, and men Lord, seeing thou have covered their eyes: thou will not
exalte them. For when Job says that the blind folk of whom he speaks,
shall not be exalted, he meeneth (as I have told you before) that they shall
be confounded, and God shall laugh them to skorne, and make them a
iestingstocke. Therefore let us be afraid, least when we be destitute of
Gods spirit and of the light which we should receive thereby, we be confounded
in the end, and our Lord cause us too be driven forth headlong like wretched
beasts, and so we fall intoo so many irksome things, as every man be
ashamed of us, and yet in the mean while we ourselves perceive not our own
shame. For behold how the world goes with all those whom God has given up
too a lewd mind? how that (as Saint Paul says in the first Chapter too the
Romans,) when God has bereft men of wit and reason, they shall no more
discern aught at all. And in good faith, we see how the wretched idolaters
cast themselves down before a pecce of wood to worship it: and is not that a
beastly thing? Yes verily. Howbeeit when God has blinded men after that sort,
they must needs become stark beasts, and fall from evil too evil, and
finally give themselves over to so shameful deeds, as they forgo all
countenance [of honesty,] and fall too working against nature, and too doing
of things which men would abhor. If we would but look upon drunkards, which
are as swine, if we would look upon whorehunters which are so chafed with
the fire of their own lust, as they have no more modesty nor honesty in
them: ought we not to tremble at the sight thereof, knowtng that all of them
are the fruits of Gods vengeance, when he blinds men and sieleth up their
eyes in such sort, as they be not able to see or discern aught any more?
And yet is not this the last part of their co^fuzion. We must come to that
which the prophet Esaias says. When God has spoken of his punishing and of
his blynding of men: and until when (says the prophet?) until their Cities
be beaten down, their people destroyed, and nothing left unconfounded. See
what the fruit is of this blinding of men. And therefore we must walk advisedly
in fear, and pray God that he will never suffer us to have our eyes so
blyndfolded. Thus much concerning this sentence. Now Job adds, That he which
tells his friend flattering tales, shall have the eyes of his children to
fail. Here Job speaks according to the circumstance of the place. For we
have seen heretofore of what opinion his friends were: namely that it might
be perceived and judged in this world, which be Gods chozen, and which be the
reprobates. But that were as much to say, as there were no last judgment
wherevntoo any thing should be reserved. For if we will esteem of men
according to Gods present handling of them here: what a thing were it? Ye see
then it were a very untoward Flalterie of set purpose: as if he should say, he
that preaches prosperity to his friend, that is to say, he that shall say to
a man, Gotoo, thou art happy, thou art beloved of God, for thou prosperest,
thou live at thine ease, thou art rich, and in the favor of the world: he (I
say) that talks after this sort, is cursed, so as the eyes of his children
shall fall out: that is to say, he shall be accursed, not only in his own
person, but also in his offspring. And hereby we be warned first not to rest
our selves upon the prosperity of this Flattery imports. And therewithal
we have to note, that it is too wretched a dealing, both for our selves and
for our neybours, when we use the said flattering. And why? For every man
dazeleth his own eyes, and seeks too lift up himself against God, when he
is in prosperity. And again we deceive our friends also. For we make them
that are at their ease, to believe that they be as good as in Gods lap, and
yet for all that, they be as it were in the gulf of hell, or very near it.
Therefore it is not without cause that Job does here pronounce such grievous
punishment against those that preach prosperity after that sort to their
neighbors. What is to be done in effect? When we be in prosperity, let us
cheer up one another to serve God, and to busy ourselves in yielding him
thanks for the goodness that he shows us And when we be in adversity, let
us take the promises that are given us to comfort us withal, and make them to
serve our purpose. And therewithal let us be always ready too receive
adversity, notwithstanding that God do show himself gentle and loving toward
us. I say let us not cease to prepare ourselves to chastizement, but let us
be willing to receive the stripes of his hand, if it please him to handle us
rigorously. Furthermore let not our mind be troubled to say, that God does
handle men here according to their deserts. But whenever he afflicts us,
let us understand that he chastizeth us for our sins. And if he spare us:
let us understand that his meening is to draw us to him by ge^tlenesse. And so
whatsoever betide us. Let nothing hinder us to lift up our heds continually, to
seek our life and co^tentatio^ in heaven and in the happy rest that tarieth
for us, And let it not grieve us to be aflicted here, seeing our god calls us
to the triu^ph that is purchaced for us by the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

But let us cast ourselves flat before the face of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us feel what his wrath is,
in such wise by our adversities, as we may not cease too taste always his
fatherly mercy, and to have recourse to the same, so grounding and settling
ourselves thereupon, as we may never swerve from it, not doubting but he will
deliver us from all our afflictions in convenient time, and ease us of al our
miseries: and that although we be pinched to the uttermost as now, yet we
shall be fully dispatched of them when he has bereft us of this flesh, too
make us parttakers of all the benefits which he has prepared for us aloft
in his heavenly glory, where we shall triumph with our Lord Jesus Christ,
according as he has gone before us in the glory of his resurrection. That it
may please him to grant this grace not only to us but also too all people and
Nations of the earth, etc.

The.lxvj. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xvij. Chapter.
6 He has made me a common byvvord, and set me to be an open gazingstocke.

7 Mine eyes is dimmed with sorrow, and all my limbs are as a shadovve.

8 The rightuouse will be astonished at this, and the innocent shall lift up
himself against the hypocrite.

9 The rightuouse will hold his way, and he that has clean hands shall be
strengthened.

10 All of you return, turn ye again, for there is not one wise man among
you.

11 My days are glyded away, mine enterprises are past, and the thoughts of
my heart,

12 Have turned day into night, they have offered me darkness for light that
approached.

13 If I tarry, the grave is my house, I shall make my bed in the dark.

14 I will say too the dust thou art my father, and to corruption thou art my
mother and my sister.

15 Where is then mine expectation? and what is it that my hope must look
for?

16 They shall go down into the bottom of the grave: there we shall be
laid in the earth, or our bed shall be in the dust.


Job following the matter that he entered into before, inte^deth to show briefly
that as in respect of his present state he is utterly forlorn, and there is no
remedy for his miseries. Seeing the case is such, he must be feign to conclude,
that if the talk of those that spoke before him be true, (that is to wit, that
me^ are dealt within this world according to their deserts, and that we must
esteem Gods grace or his love or hatred according to the state of this present
life) it and that he was set to be a Gazingstock and for men to make tales of.
For the second word which he uses (which I have translated Gazingstocke)
signifies a Timbrell. And mark here how some men have thought that Job meant
to compare here his prosperity with his adversity so great and extreme as it
was at that time, as if he had said, Heretofore I have been in great triumph,
and now God Gazingstocke, some translate it Hell: and whereas I have translated
Open, it is before them, or in their sight. And so their opinion is that Job
meant too say, that men had damned him as a wretched creature before the time.
But when all is well considered, the plain meening is that which I have
touched. For it is but a repeting of one matter twyce, for the greater
confirmation of it, according to the common custom of the holy Scripture. And
therefore That the rightuouse shall be astonished at it, but yet nevertheless
the innocent shall lift up himself against the hypocrite, and the rightuouse
shall hold on their ways, and such as have clean hands shall gather new
strength to be the more steadfast. In saying that the ryghtuouse shall be
astonished, Job meeneth that when we see the adversities that God sends too
such as have served him and walked in his fear with a pure conscience: we
think it strange and are abashed at it. And in good sooth, we see it runs
in the innocents shall auaunce themselves above the hypocrites: that is to
say, they shall not be so sore astonished, but they shall make a good winding up.
And there is not a sentence which we ought to mark better tha^ this. Why so?
For we know by experience how hard it is for men to judge aright of Gods
doings, as in respect of that which we see presently. For (as has been
declared more fully already) god executes not his judgments after such sort in
this world, as that all things should be well ruled and nothing out of square.
But contrariwyse things are confounded, and if we see a wicked man punished, a
rightuouse man is punished much more: and if we see a good man prosper, a
wicked man shall prosper double. Where are we when we see such things. We be
astonished, we be at our wits end, and (as they say) we know not which way to
turn us. So then if we judge of present things by our natural reason, we
must needs be as it were ravished, and the holy Scripture tells us we
shall be so. And although God suffer us to have experience of it, yet has he
also voutchsafed to warn us by his word, that our wits shall be troubled and
as it were dazeled if we look upon things as they seem to be now, and go no
further. Therefore let us mark well this sentence, where it is said that the
ryghtuouse shall be astonished, when they see God afflicts his children after
that sort. And in very deed there is this point also, that the cross
misliketh us, according also as we term all such things adversities, as
mislike us, or are hard and combersome. Now in asmuchas we shun afflictions
after that sort, needs must we be as it were carried away with astonishment
by reason of this gaynstryuing that is in our nature, when we see that God
afflicts his children after that manner, and lays upon the^ with great
strokes. For when we see that our Lord spares not those whom he has chozen to
himself, and to whom he has given the grace to walk purely in his fear and
service: we doubt of our selves. I say that when we see that, we are in forced
to be astonished. But what a thing were it if we had not learned this lesson?
We might be overtaken with such a fear, as we should never return into the
right way again. Wherefore let us take warning before the blow come. And when
we see good men handled roughly at Gods hand: let us not therefore be offended
and set al at randon. But let us keep our selves from tarying in that mire,
and let us understand that it behooves us to pass further, and to come to that
which Job says, and to follow it: that is to wit, what soever come of it we
must not cease to lift up our selves against the despizers of God. And hereby
ye see wherein the faithful differ from the faithless. For they may seem too
be both in that the rightuouse shall hold on his way, and that he which has
clean hands shall be strengthened. Behold a very profitable lesson. For what
causes many men to step out of square, but because they would be reco^penced
at the first day? And if God content the^ not after their own appetite: they
think it labor lost to serve him, and that they ought not to take so much
peynes, seeing there is not more wages for the good than for the bad. So then,
impacience causes many men to be grieved and turn back, yea and lose their
courage though they have begone well to follow God. Wherefore let us mark how
it is said here, that that he which has clean hands shall gather new
strength. Now hereby let us note, first that there is in us such feebleness,
that if we flatter our selves and become werie so soon as we know our selves
to be weak, all that would serve God were quite undone, and there should be no
constancy nor stedfastnes in us. And why? Let us consider a little how frail
we be, I meene even those too whom God has given some good zele. Job speaks
not here of such as stick only to their natural reason. He treats of such
as have the spirit of God dwelling in the^, which have already received such
virtue from above, as they be dispozed to weldoing. Yet nevertheless even such
manner of men are frail still, and find themselves so void of all strength,
that if God press them, they know not where they be when they should
withstand any temptation. And therefore we have need to gather new strength,
and we must not shrink though we feel such weakness in our selves. And
why? for when it is said that Gods children shall be strengthened turn ye,
turn ye (says he) for there is not a wise man among you. His speaking so, is
to disprove the talk that had been ministered by those three that had
discoursed with him, (as we have herd heretofore) to show that he was a man
forsaken of God, and that there was nothing but cursednesse in him, because
they saw him so persecuted. Job has showed, that judgment must not be given
by the adversities that are seen in this present life, to say that a man is
forsaken of God. Mark well that point. Afterward he says again, that God
does not always punish men for their sins, and that the good men are
sometimes afflicted and noman knows why: the reason thereof appears not.
Inquire a man never so much, and travel he never so much, yet shall he be never
the nearer, because Gods judgments are secret and incomprehensible. Now
forasmuch as Jobs friends conceived no such thing, he says there is no
wisdom in them. And certesse (as we have said before) it is no small point of
wisdom to discern aright of the afflictions that God sends upon men. I say,
when a man in his own case is visited by the hand of God, it is a great
wisdom in him, if he have skill to know his own sins, and can enter into
himself, and humble himself, and acknowledge, Behold here is a right
profitable medicine for me, God knew such a vice in me, and he has done me
the grace that I know it, and therefore must I now apply it wholly to mine
own use. By this means that his days are passed, his thoughts vanished, and
all his enterprises broken of and disappointed, and that he had bad darkness
in stead of the light, and when he thought that the day sprang, he had night.
To be short, he shows us that there was no end at all of his miseries, and
that there was no hope that ever he should continue as touching the present
life. And for this cause he adds, Then said I to rottenness thou art my
father, and unto the dust, thou art my moother and my sister. As if he should
say, It is not for me to regard either kinsfolk or friends any more here
bylowe. For God has hidden me from them, and cut me of from the rank and
company of the living I am like a wretched carrion, and I must not look to
return again, to say that any creature can ease me, That matter is out of all
question, and so am I utterly dispatched, there is no more remedy in my case.
What is mine expectation? I have no more (says he): when I have looked up
and down, I must go down into the pit, and my bed must be bylowe: that is
to say, in death, whatsoever I hope for, or how soever I build: for the Hebrew
word that Job uses may come of building. And it is a very fit similitude
when he speaks of hope or expectation, and yet nevertheless has an eye to
this building. There was a doubtfulnesse in the word as in respect of the
signification. Therefore it is all one as if he had said, Although I be
patient and prolong my misery continually: yet remains there nothing for me
but the grave. And he likeneth this expectation of his to a building. I may
well build (says he) in thinking there is still some hope left for me: but
shall I speed ever the better? No (says he). When I have builded my best, I
shall have none other house but my grave. It seems that Job speaks here as a
man that had no more taste of the heavenly life, nor wist what Gods mercy
meant. But it behooves us too consider too whom he tells his tale. True it is
that heretofore when he was in his fittes, and disputed against God, he showed
well that he had terrible conceits, which notwithstanding he resisted. But after
he has treated of the fitts that he felt, he shows what the folly of them
is, which would have Gods favor to utter it self [vnchaungeably] in this
present life, upon the good and faithful, and that if God show not himself
merciful here in the open face of the world toward those that are his, it
ought to be concluded that he has forsaken them, make us partakers of all the
benefits which he has prepared for such as come willingly to shroude
themselves under the shadow of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Now let us cast ourselves down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgme^t of our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we
may return to him unfeignedly, and in returning come with true faith and
repentance, desirouse to be rid of all the vices and corruptions of our flesh,
not douting for all that, but that our Lord will always behold us with pity,
and receive us to mercy, for his sake whom he has given us to be our
mediator. And so let us all say, Almighty God, etc.

The.lxvij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xviij. Chapter.
THen Bildad the Suite ansvvered, saying:

2 When will ye make an end of your words? Harken and let us speak.

3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and (in your opinion) are dullardes
and of no value?

4 This man teareth his own soul in a rage: shall the earth be forsaken for
thy sake? Shall the Rocks be removed out of their places?

5 Verily the light of the wicked shall be quenched, and the spark of their
fire shall not shine.

6 His light shall be dimmed in his tent, and his lamp that shyneth upon him
shall be put out.

7 His steps shall be restreyned, and his own device shall cast him down.

8 For a net is spread out under his feet, and he shall walk upon Snares.

9 The Grinnes shall catch him by the heel, and the Thieves shall come upon
him.

10 His pitfall is hidden in the earth, and his trappe in his way.

11 Fearfulness shall make him afraid on every side, and drive him too his
feet, and which way soever he go they shall make him to fall.


I Have told you heretofore how it is a true and very profitable doctrine,
that God punishes men's faults too show himself too be our judge: so the same
be understood and handled skilfully. whenever any man offers us any
doctrine, we be warned hereby to discern what is in it, and not to reject the
thing that we know not, as we see some do, which make no great matter to
reject all, if a man go about to show them that which is for the health of
their soul. Therefore let us not have any such pride in us. For we shall
not only grieve the men that seek our welfare and are willing to do us
service: but we shall also grieve the spirit of God that dwells in them and
gives them the love to edify us and to offer us that which that he teareth
his soul as in a rage: thereby we be warned (as I have touched before) that
when men martyr themselves in their passions, they gain nothing by it but that
they plundge themselves still more and more in their misery, which shall also
return upon their own head. True it is that the man which is in adversity
thinks himself well eased by his murmuring, Shall the world be changed for
thy sake? Shall the Rocks be removed out of their place? Some expound this
sentence very curiously, thus: Shall the world, that is to say, shall the order
that God has set and stablished, be changed? And shall the Rock, that is too
say, shall God which is the strength of the world, [ he removed out of his
place]? But these are things to much racked. Bildad meant too speak more
simply: namely that Job in his talk perverted the order of nature. That in
effect was the thing that he meant. And why? For Bildad had set down, that
as soon as God had made Heaven and earth, and settled the natural order that
we see, it behooved also that his justice should have his course. This is very
true. Howbeit he mistaketh it, in that he would have Gods justice to be
altogether apparent, so as men might know it and behold it with their eyes and
as it were touch it with their finger: wherein he beguyleth himself.
Nevertheless it is good to understand his meening, that we may gather the
instruction which is contained in it. His saying is, shall the world be
changed for thy sake? That is too say, How understand thou it? For thou
reasonest that God does not so execute his justice here bylow, as it may be
known. And would not God have his judgments known forthwith fro^the time
that he had stablished this order in the heaven, the air, and the earth? when
we behold Gods works both above and beneath, is it not to the end that his
goodness, his wisdom, his rightfulnesse, and all his virtues should be
known? Yes out of all question. To what end has God set out so fair a
lookingglasse in all his creatures? Is it not to the end too be glorified at
our hand? Now since it is so, like as God utters his virtues in all the rest,
so also will he have us privy to his judgments. This is true in some respect:
that is too wit, so it be understood as it ought to be. But Bildad stretches
it out to Verily the light of the wicked shall be quenched, and the lamp that
shyneth upon his head shall be dimmed: there shall not remain one spark of his
fire. By such similitudes Bildad meant to signify in effect, that God will not
suffer the wicked to prosper for ever. Howbeit we must mark well that it is
very true, that God will give the wicked leave to live at ease for a time, and
to triu^ph and ruffle it out, as though they had fortune in their hand. If
Bildad had been ware of this point: he would not have locked up himself so
streytly as he does afterward. And why? He grants here that the wicked may
sometimes prosper. Wherein is it then that he ouershooteth himself? It is in
that he foresetteth the time and in manner the day that their prosperity should
take an end, and God should turn their laughter into weeping. But it is not
for us too appoint that. And why? God may sometimes lead forth the wicked in
prosperity eue^ to his grave so as the world shall see it, as I have partly
touched: that is too wit, they shall go down into the grave without trouble in
the turning of a hand, according also as it is said in the Psalm. Behold
(says Dauld) Gods children drag their lines and cords, they do put pyne
away here bylowe, it seems that death pursues them, and yet notwithstanding
will not take them away. But how fare the wicked? They be lusty and strong,
and die ere they be aware. Since it is so, let us mark well* that it is not for
us to set God any term, too say that he should quench the light of the wicked
in this world, and thrust them into darkness, that is to say, into confusion.
We cannot do so without controlling of our God. Besides this, we be aduertized
that his pleasure is it should be so. For he intends to reserve some
judgment to the latter day. What is to be done then? First let us mark as it
is said here, that the despisers of God, or the hypocrites shall have as it
were a lamp burning in their house. Surely he expresses the matter by the
diverse terms of libg^, lamp, and shining: but Bildads speaking here is after
the ordinary manner of the holy Scripture. Nevertheless this light betokens
nothing else but that the wicked live at their ease and in pleasure, and that
God seems to sauuor them, like as on the contrary part it is a very common
thing to have our tribulations and anguish likened to night and darkness. But
now let us come back again to the matter. That nets are laid under the
feet of the wicked, that they cannot pass but through straits, that when they
rise up they shall be caught as in a pitfall, and that snares are pitched under
their feet, howbeit that those snares be covered and ars not to be perceived.
According hereunto David also says: that the wicked shall walk always upon
ye. True it is that their way glistereth, and is fair to the eye: but there
is no sure footing for them, and God will make them tread a step awrie to
break their neck before it was once thought of. All these similitudes agree
in one: that is to wit, to show that although the wicked do prosper, and their
happiness is wondered ^^, and had in estimation, yea and coueted of all the
whole world: yet notwithstanding they go to destruction. Every man will say: I
would I were in such a man's case: but we see not the snares that are covered
in the earth. It will seem that God bears up the wicked, and that they have
wings to fly with. But what for that? If they stie high, it is but to tumble
down the more unhandsomely: and if their feet be upon the earth, there are
snares under them. True it is that we see them not: but when we be warned of
them by Gods word, we must look upon them by faith. Notwithstanding if
Bildad had understood well what he said, he had not been so hampered in the
snares of contrariety. Why so? For in saying that the snares are covered
under the wicked men's feet, he should have remembered that is not in us to
epsy them, until God show them. And when shall that be? Surely it is not for
us to appoint him any time Then must men submit themselves too Gods providence,
and not set down a general rule or Law, to say, God will do so or so. But
let us on our side look to apply the said doctrine to his right use. Seeing
it is said that there be snares under wicked men's feet: well, let us pray God
to lead us by the hand, assuring our selves that snares are laid in this
world for men. For Satan not only assayleth us with open war: but also
lays ambushes for us, and practizeth our destruction privily as much as is
possible for him. We therefore should not know how to step one pace in this
present life, but we should be in danger to be caught in his snares. But what
for that? When Satan the Heel* purposely. For although Bildad had an eye to
that which he had spoken, that is, that the snares were under the ground, so
as the wicked were caught with them: yet notwithstanding, under that word
Heel, he Heel ought to serve that fearfulness shall dismay him on all
sides, and make them to fall every where. He had said that they should march
in narrow places, and that whither socuer they went they should not escape the
ambushes. True it is that the wicked shall have room long and large enough to
sport in, according as we see how they leap about to and fro: and therefore
it seems not that they walk always in streyts. Indeed we see it not: but
they themselves feel it much better than we can imagine. Again, albeit that
we see it not continually: yet does God at length perform that which is said
here, even according as Bildad utters it: namely that fear shall dismay
them. But he mistaketh the word fear, as though Gods enemies should needs
know and conceive their sins too be afraid and to repent them: and that is
not so. And why? These two things, namely that the wicked should be amazed
with fear, and yet be merry and triumph, cannot stand together. For when the
despyzers of God would be merry, they ouershoote themselves, they forget
themselves, they become beasts, they believe they be able to work wonders, and
they think themselves the happiest men in the world that they can anger God.
Lo what the joy of the wicked sort is: that is too wit, a furious joy, and a
joy that so bereeues them of their wits and reason, as it leaves no modesty
at all in them. But yet in the mean while God does now and then call them to
account, and he summoneth them within so as they be constreyned to perceive,
that they must be feign to come before him: And yet for all this they bury
that knowledge as much as they can, and are contented to abide deaf and
blind, and another to see no^ yet to hear what God shows and tells them.
Now we see how we ought to set forth this lesson, that we may practice it
too our profit. It is in effect, that although the wicked have the world at
will: that is not as much to say as their life is therefore happy. And why?
What is the chief welfare of man? To be sure that his conscience is quiet
and at rest, so as he may go on in true constancy through life and through
death, yea and even be merry. But does that befall to the wicked? No: for
although they streyne themselves to set light by God, and to be void of
sadness: yet are they feign to be sorry and out of quiet spite of their teeth.
Hereby we see that their life is unhappy, for all the goods that they can
have. And so if we understand that God will be merciful to us, although we be
vexed on all sides: yet is it a comfort to us in the mids of al our sorrows,
that we are sure that God will end them to our profit and welfare, and to the
confusion of our enemies. Thus ye see how we must practyze this lesson. Verily
it deserves to be discoursed more at length, and so it shall be by Gods
leave at the next Lecture. But as now the present time will not suffer us to
go any further.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him that when he has made us perceive our selves well
worthy to be bereft of all light, and to be cast into horrible darkness for
rejecting the grace of his holy spirit which he had offered us: it may
nevertheless please him to pity us, and like as he has once enlightened us
by his word and holy Ghost, so too increase the same light more and more in
us, and specially too make us too prosper in that which he knows to be fit
for us. And yet in the mean while that he suffer us not too be tied to the
corruptible goods of this world, to rest our selves to much upon them: but
that we may always go forward to the everlasting heritage prepared for us in
heaven, so as we may not be vanquished by the temptations that may befall us,
but get the upper hand in all battelles wherewith we be assailed, waiting till
our God have delivered us from all miseries of this world, and taken us up into
the blissednesse that is prepared for us in heaven, where we shall have our
full contentation. That it may please him too grant this grace not only to
us, but also to, etc.

The.lxviij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xviij. Chapter.
12 His strength shall be in famine, and breaking of anguish shall be at his side.

13 The firstborne of death shall eat up his branches or the members of his
skin, yea it shall eat up his members.

14 His hope shall be rooted out of his tent, and the king of fear shall make
him come.

15 He that is none of his shall dvvell in his tent, and brimstone shall be
povvred upon his dwelling place.

16 His roots shall wither bylovve, and his boughs shall be cut off aloft.

17 His name shall perish from of the earth, and he shall have no more renoume
any where.

18 He shall be cast out of light into darkness, and driven quite out of the
world.

19 He shall have another Sons nor graundchildren among the people, nor any
ouerliuer in his dvvellings.

20 They that live after him shall be astonished at his day, and they that go
before him shall be caught with fear.

21 Surely such are the Tents of the wicked, and the place of him that
knovveth not God.


We have too go forward with the matter that was begun yesterday. For here
Bildad shows that God suffers not the wicked too escape that famine shall be
the strength of the wicked, and that breaking shallbe ready [or just by him]
at his side. When he that the first borne of death shall eat his branches,
or the members of his skin, yea, it shall eat his members, for that parcel
is repeted. Whereas mention is made here of the firstborne of death, it
behooves us too understand some exquisite kind of death. For when some me^ die,
we see they pass away easily, and God spares the^. Othersome are tormented in
such wise as they pine away by peecemeale, and are worn away too the hard
bones: and othersome go away without any feeling. Then let us mark here, that
this word, The firstborne of death, carries in it a great force, when a man is
hilde as it were upon the rack, and that God dismayeth him and frayeth him,
and wrappes him in anguish on all sides, in so much that he sees nothing but a
bottomless pit of horrible fear. Bildad therefore says it shall happen
after that manner to the wicked. True it is that all of us are mortal, and that
God has put us into this world with condition to take us hence again.
Surely we cannot come to the heavenly life, except the corruptible that is in
us be first put away as S. Paul speaks What must be done that his hope
shall be rooted out of his tent, and that he shall be brought too the king
of death. When he says that the hope of the ungodly shall be rooted out of
his tent: thereby it is done us to understand, that God will for a time lodge
such as are unworthy of it, so as they shall have ease at will, yea and dwell
in palaces, while in the mean season the poor faithful ones shall scarsely
have a little cotage too retire unto. Thus the despyzers of God, which are
given too all naughtiness, shall dwell in this world as though the Lordship
thereof belonged too none but them. They shall have wide and large houses, they
shall have goodly long walks, and therewithal their trust shall be in their
pleasures: that is to say, they shall think themselves so well settled, as
they may never be shaken, according also as it is said in the Psalm, that
they shall repine at the order of nature: and if a man look upon the buyldings
that they make here bylowe, it seems that they be so highly advanced, as
the hand of God cannot touch them. Thus ye see the two things that are
showed us in this sentence, And therefore when we see the despyzers of God in
their bravery, and in their iollitie, let us not be abashed at it. Why so?
For it is not of late days that such trade began. Our Lord will have us to
behold these things to the end we may know that we be not yet come to our
heritage, but our salvation is yet hidden. Thus must we not be troubled nor
offended when we see the wicked to prosper, and to have their full scope, and to
have fair dwelling places, yea and to trust in their good fortune, and to be
puffed up with pride, and to have so suregrounded hope (to their own seeming)
as may be. When we see this, well, it is no new thing. But what? Let us mark
how it is said, that hope is rooted out of their dwelling place: that is to
say, that although the world see the^ in such p^pe now adays, and so fenced
and furnished as they seem to be ra^pirde on al sides, and that no harm may
come near the^ to inco^ber the^: and although the world see them well at
their ease, and that the same is like to continue with the^ ever after: yet will
God perform that which he has said And it is not for naught that he has
spoken both of their dwelling places and of their hope For therein it is showed
us that God will not be let to execute his vengeance upon the^,
notwithstanding that they be so highly advanced for a time, and as it were
exempted from all the miseries of this world. And in the end it is said, that
they shall come too the king of fear. Like as before, mention was made of the
firstborne of death, to betoken a violent death, and a death that is more
terrible than common death: So likewise when Bildad speaks here of the king
of fear, he betokens a royal and exquisite fear, that is to say, the
greatest fear that is to be found. True it is that by this similitude we may
take the Devil for the king of fear: but the natural meening is that which I
have touched before. And surely the firstborne of death, and the king of fear,
are all one manner of speech. So then let us mark briefly, that here the
wicked are threatened to be driven into such a terrible and excessive fear,
that all the fears in the world which the godly do conceive, are nothing to
it. And we must mark this sentence well. For if God send us any occasion of
care and fear, we be grieved at it: and truly the chief benefit that we can
wish in this life, is peace, so as we be set free and exempted from all
misdoubting and carfulness. Yet notwithstanding if God will have us to care,
we must not therefore be out of quiet. And why? For when we be ouertake^ with
fear, although the same be great, yet is it the mean whereby God provoke
that one which is none of his shall dwell in his tent, and brimstone shall be
powered out upon his house. Some men set it down, that he shall dwell in his
tent: howbeit because it is none of his own, brimstone shall be cast down upon
it. But that is hard and streyned. Let us mark then that Bildad meant rather,
that the dwellingplaces of the wicked shall perish, or else be conveyed over
that his root shall wither beneath, and his boughs be cut of above. Here
now again Bildad does us too understand that the wicked shall be confounded,
notwithstanding that their state seem as happy as any may be. For thereunto
does this similitude lead us. Certesse he likeneth them too a tree that is
rooted in the ground. Mark me a tree that is well planted, and afterward
spreads out above as well in tru^ke as in boughs, which bear leaves, flowers
and fruit: and even such is the outward show of the wicked, and of the
despyzers of God: and such similitudes are well worthy to be noted. For (as I
have declared already) we must not be grieved at al when we see that God does
not at the first dashe punish those that step out unto evil, but rather
seems to bear them good will and to hear their petitions. This troubles
us, and our desires boil within us, so as we would feign that God should take
vengeance out of hand. So much the more then behooves it us too mark well how
it is said here, that the wicked may well be like unto fair trees, according
as it is said in the. 37. Psalm, I have seen the ungodly advanced so high,
as he seemed like a Cedre of Libanus. For like as Ceders are higher than other
trees: even so are the wicked among men, in so much as it seems that all men
else should stoop under the^. But what for that? I went by, (says David) and
kept on my way, and when I came back again I saw there was no print of them
remaining. Whereas he says he went by, he meeneth that he tarried patiently
til God had accomplished his work, and that the full time was come. Even so
must we do: when we see the wicked in prosperity, the same must not hinder us
from following our course, till we be come thither as God calls us. Thus ye
see what we have to mark in this text, for the first point. Secondly it
behooves us too mark this threatening: that when the wicked shall have taken
deep root, and be come to such prosperity as there is no likelihood that
ever any wind that their memorial shall perish in earth, and that they shall
have no more renown any where. True it is that we must not put our trust in
this world, too seek renown and glory here. For the holy Scripture mocketh
such kind of vanity, saying that such as do settle their names in earth,
know not what God and his kingdom meene. Therefore we must not be desirous
too make our selves renowned in this world. Yet is it not the memorial of the
wicked shall perish. Let us mark that his so saying is a curse peculiarly
belongyng to the despizers of God, according to that which I have touched
already. For they be drunken in their foolish ambition, so as they bear
themselves in hand that their name shall never fade in the world but men shall
have it in remembrance for ever. But we see how it goes clean contrary with
them. For what is the cause that they turmoyle themselves after that sort? It
is too have men to talk of them. Well then, are the despyzers of God desirous
to make themselves renowned in the mouths of men? God will turn it quite and
clean to the contrary. For if their remembrance continue: it shall be in
reproach, and men shall not speak of them but in skorne and mockage. And as
for them that have been carried away with this said vain desire, do we not see
that God has buried them, so as men could no more tell what was become of
them? Whereas it seemed that they should be talked of while the world
endured, and whereas they themselves surmized that every of them should become
greatest,) for although they saw many go before them, yet did every of them
think with himself, I shall be chiefest:) yet has God buried them as I said
before, and if men speak of them, after what manner is it? Every man is made
privy too their naughtiness and shame. And does not this come of the said
curse of God? Therefore let us mark that Bildad has expressed here the
chief thing that those kind of men seek which are given to the world. And
that ought to be well marked. For if God make our name to perish too the
worldward: what loze we by it: what harm have we by it? For we know our
names are written in the book of life. Be glad (says our Lord Jesus Christ
too his Disciples) for your names are written in Gods registers too your
everlasting salvation. Is not this enough to content us? We be not like these
fools that have none other immortality than to make themselves to be spoken
of. For that were ouergreat fondness. But we know that God has written our
names in his book, and ingroced the record with his own hand, that is too
say, in his own everlasting determination, (for Gods hand is the
unchangeable ordinance that he has appointed) and afterward ratified the
whole with the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and finally sealed it by the
working of his holy spirit. Seeing then that we have our memorial there among
the Angels of heaven, and among the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles: have we
not cause too be concontented? And so albeit that our remembrance be razed out
of the world: yet shall we looze nothing by it. But we see that God makes
the memorial of his servants to be blissed, (as I said before) notwithstanding
that they be despyzed for a time, and counted in the world to be dirt and dung,
as Saint Paul speaks: for he likeneth them to guts full of filthiness
that are cast away. Thus then the faithful are exercized for a time, yea and
they are under the curse of men, as though they bare all the sins of the
world: but in the end God makes their righteousness to shine forth as the
break of the day, and they are had in blessed remembrance. We see that
Abraham in his time was despized and shaken off. What may a man think of
Jacob? and yet we see that their memorial is blissed. Every man ran upon
David, they cursed him, they spited him, he became as a worm of the ground, he
was made a skorne and mockingstocke to the veriest rascalles, and every man did
as it were loathe him: That they shall be cast out of light into darkness,
that they shall be driven out of the world, that they shall have neither
children nor Graundchildren-among the people, and that they shall have no
ouerliuer or heir in the land where they dwell. Here Bildad confirms the
matter that he had treated of: which is, that if God make the wicked to
prosper, that is not always. And that is very true. For what happiness is
there in their state, seeing that all their laughter must be turned into sorrow.
So then let us assure our selves that the present light of the wicked serves
but to lead them into the way of darkness. When we hear this: if we be in
darkness (that is to say in adversity, according also as the word imports)
that such as come after them shall be amazed at it, and such as go before them
shall be afraid, and that such is the dwelling of the wicked, and of those
that fear not God. This serves to confirm his matter: that is to wit, that
God will punish the wicked in such wise, as the world shall be astonished at
the sight of their state, it shall be so unhappy. This saying is very true,
and we ought to aduau^tage our selves greatly by it, and bear it well in
mind, provided that we follow not Bildad in enclosing Job and all such as are
afflicted, within the said cursednesse. And why? For (as I have said)
adversities light upon Gods children, as well as upon the wicked. We must
always beware that we let God alone with the guyding of all things, as unto
whom it belongs. So then if we be poor and afflicted, so as the world
esteems us as wretches: let us not therefore cease to rest upon the goodness
of our God, and too wait his leisure till he deliver us for a full adoo, from
all our necessities and afflictions, [which thing he will do] if we refer
all unto him.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him too make us feel them in such wise, as we may
humble our selves and be sorry for them, and learn to take more profit of the
miseries and adversities that are sent us in this world, than we have done
hithertoo: that upon the knowledge of our faults and sins, we may enter
into examination of our life, to mislike of our vices, to the end that being
received to mercy by the mean of our Lord Jesus Christ we may have the more
matter and occasion to trust to his goodness for the time to come, so that
whereas we have to walk through many miseries and adversities in this world,
we may not therefore cease to obey him always to the end. That it may please
him to grant this grace, not only to us, but also, etc.

The.lxix. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xix. Chapter.
Job ansvvered and said.

2 How long will ye grieve my heart, and undermine me with your words*

3 Ye have already ten times put me to confusion, and are not ashamed, and
ye are hardened against me.

4 If I have done amiss, my sin shall abide with me.

5 But you magnify your selves, and vaunt your selves at my misery.

6 Know ye that god has beseeged me with his power, and beset me round
about with his nets.

7 If I cry out by reason of violence, heansvvereth me not: If I shreeke out
yet have I no right.

8 He has shet up my way, so as there is no passage out, and he has put
darkness in my path*

9 He has bereft me of my glory, he has taken the crown away from my head.

10 He has destroyed me on all sides, and I am vanished away: he has taken
away my hope as the hope of a tree.

11 His anger is kindled against me, and he counts me as his enemy.

12 His armies are come, they have enclosed me, and they have pitched their
camp about my tent.


WE have seen what Bildads intent was in rebuking Job. He Ye are not ashamed
(says he) to put me too confusion so often times already: you have hardened
your selves against me, or you have made your selves strangers to me: for
the Hebrew word may import the one as well as the other. But the fittest is,
that they had hardened themselves, in not having pity nor compassion upon his
miseries. Now then we see whereto this plaint tends. Howbeeit whereas that
if be have done amiss, his sin shall abide in him: therein he shows
himself to have been ouerpassionate. For if he had done amiss, it was for him
to receive correction peaceably. But to say let me alone, I shall bear mine
own punishment: no man shall take harm by my sin but my self, is a manner of
speaking that agrees to an vnreclaymable and desperate person, rather than to
a child of God. Nevertheless, Job was tempted thereunto, when he saw he
could have no reason at his friends hands. But yet he returns to the
principal Know ye (says he) that God has overthrown me in judgment (that
is to say, ye must not dispute here by reason: for God rules not himself
according to man's capacity) I can have no right at his hand, I may well
contend, but yet must I stand to my harms, I must be oppressed, and yet if
I cry, or if I make moan, my misery is never the more assuaged, It booteth
me not, for he has showed himself too be mine enemy, he has sent me
innumerable miseries, like an army to beseege me. I am tormented, and which
worse is, I see no issue in all my way, and it seems that he has enclosed
me, and locked me up, and that there is no manner of mean to escape the
miseries that press me and torment me. This were very strange talk at the
first sight, if we had not already understood partly whereupon Job groundeth
himself, and that the same were not now newly again brought to remembrance, as
it shall be showed anon by Gods leave. But let us go forward with Jobs talk.
This complaint which he makes to his friends is just: that is to wit, that
it was a pleasure to them to put him too confusion. Now (as I have said
heretofore) if a man be smitten with Gods rods, although there be just cause
to find fault with him, yet must the same be done with a mild spirit, that
the medicine be not too sharp, considering that the hand of God has rigor
enough in it self, without adding any more to it. If a man bear himself
stoutly against God, and seem not to feel any misery, but plays the
madman, and is not by any means reformable: there we have to use greater
sharpness. For when men abuse Gods patience and goodness, such stateliness
must be tamed. And if God handle them not at the first as they deserve so as
they become more hardeharted and wilful because he bears with them: then ye
see wherein he ought to use greater rigor. For it is not to be borne that men
should outface God after that sort, and turn his goodness and gentleness
into such poison, thereby to inuenim themselves more and more against him. Let a
man handle them mildly and they run riot in their delights, so as they become
as it were bewitched, and is to wit, that if men lift up themselves in that
wise against us, and be to feerce upon us, and be not so modest as were
requisite: yet notwithstanding, it behooves us to understand, that it will be
always for our welfare to receive the corrections that are laid upon us. And
for the humbling of our selves, let us learn to enter into our selves, and
let us neither fret nor repine when men rebuke us somewhat sharply, and
discover our lewdness. Wherefore is it that men (as we see) do oftentimes
storm without rule and modesty? It is because they have that if he cry out,
there is no reason for him, because that God is as it were his enemy. Hereby
we be taught, first that if we will do our neighbors good in rebuking
them of their faults: it behooves us too be well sure, that they have done
amiss, and that we find fault with them justly, and not upon single
conjectures: for it was an evil manner of proceeding of Jobs friends, too
condemn him because God scourged him. We must be of another mind, as I have
said already. For God keeps not always one rate, too punish none but
such as have done amiss: nay rather, oftentimes the rightuousest are
troubled much more than the others, as we see: for according as God has
dealte of his power unto them, so does he also try them to the vttermoste. It
behooves us to bear this well in mind, too the end we be not grieved when
we see we must walk in the self same way that they do. For ought it to
mislike us, that God spares us no more than those whom he loved more than
all other men? VVoulde we be more privileged than the holy fathers that have
had so excellent witness of the holy Ghost* So then if we should condemn
or acquitte every man according too Gods handling of him: all the poor folk
in the world, all the sick folk, all despyzed folk, and all folk that are
out That God had overthrown him: that is to say, that he comes against
him after such a disordered manner, as is altoogither out of square, and has
no indifferency in it. This may be spoken in such a sense as shall not be
evil. For I have declared heeretoofore, that there is in God a double
righteousness. The one is, that which he has set forth in his law: and
that righteousness is well known and apparent too us: it is that God had
overthrown him, and all was out of order: he shows himself too be
ouermaystred of his affections. True it is that he always knew God to be
rightuous: according as we see that although he were shaken, and that such
words had escaped him, yet he returns home again, and acknowledges that
he ought too hold his mouth shette. Nevertheless he cea^^eth not too have
his skumme, as a boiling pot that seetheth up into great walloppes must
needs spirt over on one side or other. Even so does Job. And it behooves us
too know that he stormeth to much against God: which thing is greatly for
our profit, if we can apply it to our instruction. For touching the first
place, we shall have profited greatly, if we bear away this lesson, that God
does sometimes punish men not in respect of their sins, but too humble
them, because his intent is too show that he has full authority over his
creatures, and has ordained them as mirroures of patience, because he will
make them too feel their own infirmities, that they may know themselves the
better, when they perceive that there be covert vices in them which are
discovered by afflictions, and that they have not had such constancy in them,
as were requisite, but have swarued aside: and that when they shall have seen
themselves so stumbled, they may be the more provoked to call upon God,
knowing that if he had not reached the^ his hand, they had bin utterly undone.
And surely whenever we endure any affliction: the best remedy is for us to
enter into the knowing of our sins, and every man to accuse himself, saying*
Alas, I have offended my God so many ways, that if he should punish me a
hundred fold, I have deserved it, and much more. Again, if we see not
always wherefore God scourges us: let us say, Well Lord, thou art
rightuous. Although I be not able to atteyne to the reason of thine intent: it
ought to suffize me too know that thou do not any thing, but rightly and
indifferently. Then let us assure our selves, that we have true wisdom, if
we can so glorify God, notwithstanding that he hold our eyes closed up and
lead us as poor blind souls. Let us be contented to walk whithersoeuer he
leads and directs us, assuring our selves that his only will must be to
us the infallible God has overthrown my judgment: that is to say, he
handles me not like a judge, but steppeth too me with extraordinary rigor
as though he had no compassion of me. And what a temptation is that? It is
said to me that the name of God is my refuge, and that God is near unto all
them that call upon him faithfully: I have assayed what those promises mean,
and I feel no commodity by them: but rather my misery is increased the more.
And what a thing is that? Yet notwithstanding Job came too that point, and not
Job only, but also David and the rest of the faithful. And specially it
behooves the same thing too be fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ,
according also as it is he on whom this sentence is veryfied: namely,

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with the
acknowledgeme^t of our sines, praying him so to clenze us of them, as there may
be nothing in us to hinder us from coming right forth unto him, and that in
our coming we may find him ready too receive us for our Lord Jesus Christ's
sake. And so let us all say: Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The.lxx. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xix. Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth the exposition of the. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. and 12. verses
that have been touched already, and then upon the text that follows here.

13 He has made my brethren too shrink away from me, and mine
acquayntance become strangers to me.

14 My neighbors have forsaken me, and my father and my mother have forgotten
me.

15 Mine own household, and my may deseruantes have disdeyned me, and I have
been as a stranger in their sight.

16 If I call my servant he answers me not, though I pray him with mine
own mouth.


IT behooves us to go through with the matter that we began in the last
Sermon: which is, that it is a hard and burdensome temptation when our
prayers be not heard at the first. For verily the only thing that remains
for us when we be in adversity, is that God receive us if we desire the time,
is for that we pray not to him so heartily as were requisite. Every man will
say he passes not for praying: and in deed if men be asked whyther they
have done their indeuer to pray to God to have mercy upon them: every one
will answer, I have prayed as much as is possible. But all they that speak
after that manner know not what prayer meeneth. We go as coldly to it as to
any thing. And do we think that God ought to receive such requests as are
made but for fashion sake, and ceremoniously only? Then let us mark, that God
that he had cried out, but yet wasnot bearde. For the adding of all this, is
but too complain that his afflictions are so extreme, as it is no wonder
though he be exceedinglye sore grieved, and that his friends ought not too
stand checking against him. For it is a folly (says he) too deem by the
ordinary custom what I ought to do. If a man be afflicted, and it be told
him that he ought to pray unto God: as for me (says he) if I pray unto
him: I am not heard. If a man reply again, my friend, you must not storm so
sore, (and peradventure the adversity that he indureth is but some common
thing:) no (says he:) but I feel such and so excessive pain, and the
hand of God presses me after so strange and rigorous a manner: as it is no
marvel though there be neither wit nor reason in me. Lo what Jobs meening
is. But I have told you heeretoofore, how it behooves us too know, that God
does sometimes execute his rigor upon men after an unknown manner, as in
respect of our mother wit. And therefore must we at such times pray unto
God, and say, Lord make me perceive continuallye that thou art at hand with
me, and although I find it not by experience, but rather am as it were
forsaken of thee to outward seeming: yet give me power always too settle my
hope upon thy goodness and succor. Job should have spoken so. Howbeeit
forasmuch as he does it not: Therefore he roueth over all the feelde (as
they say) in making such complaints as we hear in this text. But to the
intent to do our selves good by that which is contained here, let us
mark that in Jobs person the holy Ghost mente to set us out as it were a
glass of men's affections, when they be not brydled under Gods obeisance.
Mark that for one point. Another point is, that. God mente here to show us
his judgments how terrible they be, and that when he lists to hyde his
loving countenance from us, and to show himself an enemy to men, it is so
dreadful a thing, as were enough too ouerwhelme the whole world. That is the
second point. The third is, that although Job were in such pangues: yet
notwithstanding he resisted the temptations, howbeeit that he came no sooner
to the brunte, but many evil words escaped from him, so as infirmity was
mingled with his strength. Thus ye see the three things that we have too
mark here. First of all we note that God will have men too behold
themselves in the person of Job. For we should not know what we be, if God
enforced us not to perceive our own weakness. Every man thinks himself
to be mighty and strong: we imagine our own power to be wonderful, and
that we shall never swerve, yea, so long as we be far from blows. But
as soon as God presses, we be so cast down, as we may well see (if we be
not to too dull) that it was but a vain and foolish ouerweening in us, when
we thought we had any strength in our selves, whereas we have none at all.
For as much therefore, as men are so blinded, and as it were sotted in that
foolish persuasion: the holy Ghost presents here unto us the person of
Job, too make us perceive how men shrink under Gods hand when they be
afflicted, and that they cannot stand out, but must needs be utterly
overthrown. Now, if this happened too Job, who was constant above others:
alas, what shall become of us? But we must come too the second point which is
the chiefest. For whereof comes it that we be not teachable to humble our
selves before God, and too walk in awe without trusting in our selves, or in
any thing that we can do? It is because we feel not how heavy and
intolerable Gods hand is. The matter then that God declares unto us, is that
it is a terrible case when he lysteth too utter his power upon mortal men in
punishing them: and that they must needs melte at it as snow against the
Sun, and be utterly confounded. Yea verily (as the Scripture says) That God
bath so beseeged his ways, as he knows not how too get out, and that he
has put darkness in his pathe. Though we be afflicted, yet is it a great
asswagemente of our grief, when we see that the mishappe must pass away
apace, and not continue still, as if we toward me. Thus are we by such
means stirred up to call upon God. Heerewithall let us understand that he
will not berceue us of skill and discretion unto the end, but will make us too
find way where none is, and his woorking shall be so much the better known
unto us, whereby we shall have the greater occasion too glorify him, when he
shall have wrought after such a manner as we looked not for. For when God has
gone beyond our wit and hope: we have so much the more cause to glorify
him. Thus ye see in effect what we have to mark that God had bereft him of
his glory, and plucked the crown from his head, that he had consumed him,
destroyed him, and berefte him of his hope as a tree [that is cut up.] Here
Job betokens two things the one is that God scourges him so roughly, that if
he were compared with other men, he should be found to endure much more than
they. And secondly he says that he is not as other that are in adversity,
who though they suffer very great misery, yet notwithstanding are as a tree
that is plucked up, but yet has some little root or that God has inflamed
his wrath against him, and is become his enemy. True it is that as often as God
scourges us, the holy scripture says that he is angry with us. Not that he is
subject to our passions, another is it for that he casts us away, or that he
hates us in deed. What then? It is because he makes us feel his displeasure
by our afflictions. Why so? For afflictions are Gods chastizeme^ts which he
sends unto me^ for their sins. True it is (as I have said already) that
sometimes he chastizeth his servants for some other purpose. But yet must we
always first call to mind that we be sinners and detters unto God, and
therefore that he punishes the sins which we have committed. Howbeeit
there is in Jobs saying a particular consideration beyond the ordinary wont.
He complayneth that Gods anger was kindled against him. And ought that too be
any novelty? For throughout all the holy scripture God declares and auoweth
himself too be angry with those whom he chaziseth. Yea: but Job intended
to express more: that this wrath of God is not a common and accustomed wrath,
as though God counted him for an utter castaway. For like as generally God will
have us to feel his anger when he punishes us, and too enter into the for
the annie of God is come, and his hands are encamped round about my house. He
terms all the adversities that he endured, by the name of Gods army or
soldiers. This similitude, (namely that all the adversities whereto we be
subject, are Gods scourges, darts, errowes, swords, and (to be short) men of
war that have us in the chase) has bin seen heretofore in another
sentence. And it is right necessary to be known. For although we confess it
in general speech: yet are we not so fully persuaded of it as were requisite.
And surely when men suffer any adversity, they cannot withholde themselves
from thinking that it happened by some misfortune. If there fall any hayle, or
if there come any frost to fear the vines and to mar the corn:
straightwayes it is evil fortune. And this manner of speech proceeds of that
we look ever at that which is nearest hand, and can mount no higher to know
that all things are of Gods disposing. That (say I) is the cause why men run
continually intoo gross blockishnesse. And so when the Scripture speaks of
afflictions, telling us that God holds them in his hand, that they be as
men of war, that they be his souldyers, that they be too serve his turn,
that he sends them, and that he disposes them at his good pleasure: Let us
mark well every whit of it, to the end that whenever our turn comes to
be afflicted in any manner wise, we may always look up to Gods hand, and
assure our selves that it is the same that strikes us, and thereby let us
learn to humble ourselves, saying: well Lord, I see that men trouble me, I
see these lower causes, and I see wherefore such a thing is befalne me. But in
the mean while Lord, thou art above all, and therefore it behooves me to look
up unto thee, and too acknowledge that the strokes come from thine hand.
Furthermore let us mark also that God has not only one army, one sword, or
one cudgel to smite us with* but he has bands, he has whole hosts, ready
to besiege us on all sides, as Job speaks here. Therefore whenever we be
escaped out of one misery, God can well pluck us back again by and by. And
this point is very profitable. For although men be convinced that Gods hand
persecuteth them: yet conceive they always some vain hope too get out, and
they think thus: Well, I will dispatch this well enough: there is yet such a
shift. Behold (I pray you) how that whereas men ought too humble themselves
under the hand of God: they become more stubborn against it, and bear
themselves in hand, that if they do but dashe at him with their horn, they
shall drive him a great way off. And specially we see what stubbornness is in
us, in that when God smites us with his rod, we be puffed up with pride and
presumption, and think he does us great wrong, not considering at all that
he might pinche us an hundred fold more. Thus ye see what we have to mark.
Finally Job complayneth that his friends were against him, and even in that
point he declares that he knew it was Gods hand. This sentence does yet
better confirm that which I have said already, to the end we might know
how far this lesson extends. Are diseases Gods men of war? yea, and they
are also his scourges and swords. For the scripture uses all these
similitudes, to the intent that according to our rudeness, we might the
better conceive the things that otherwise could not well enter into our head.
Yet notwithstanding,

Now let us fall down before the face of our good god with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him too grant us the grace to profit in such wise by the
afflictions and chasticements that he sends us, as we may be humbled and
meekned by them, and not come to advance our selves, nor to check against him,
but that being strengthened by his power, we may stand out steadfastly in
obeying him, and yet notwithstanding not cease too sigh and groan, seeing the
danger wherein we be, until he reach out his hand to us: and that above all
things we may look up too our Lord Jesus Christ, assuring our selves that if
we be made like to him in our afflictions, we shall have wherewith to rejoice
of our sorrows in him, waiting for the day of the fullness of our joy, when
he shall gather us into the glory of his resurrection, whereinto he is gone
before. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us.

The.lxxj. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xix. Chapter.
17 My breath is loathsome to my wife, though I entreat her for the childrens
sake of mine own body.

18 Even the little ones do shun me, and when I rise up, they cast out
scoffs against me.

19 My friends have abhorred me, and they whom I loved are turned against me.

20 My bone cleaves to my skin, and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the
skin of my teeth.

21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends: for the hand of God
has smitten me.

22 Why persecute you me as God does, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

23 O that my words were written, O that they were registered in a book,

24 With a pen ofyron in lead or stone for ever.

25 I am sure that my redeemer lives, and he shall at the last rise up upon
the earth.


Forasmuch as God has knitte men together to the end that one of them
should bear up another, and each manne endeavor too help his neighbor,
and when we can do no more, then we should have pity and compassion one of
another: if we happen too be destitute of all help, so as we be troubled
on all sides, and no man shows us any kindness, but every man is cruel
too us: that temptation she was not able to abide his breath, though he prayed
her for the childrens sake of her own womb. Here he shows that children
ought to be an increasement of the love between man and wife. For when God
blisseth a marriage with issue, it ought to increase their mutual affection to
live in greater concord. The very Paynims knew that well enough. But it is
ill performed of those that ought to see much cleerer. And what a condemnation
shall it be to the believers, which boast themselves to have bin instructed in
the word of God, if they know not that which nature shows to the silly
ignorant sort that are as good as blind? Then look upon the Painims, who have
acknowledged that children are as it were gages to confirm better the love of
man and wife, and to hold them in peace and unity. According hereunto Job
says, that he entreated his wife for the childrens sake that he had begot of
her. But that moved not her at al. The^ shows he how it is a thing against
nature, in which behalf his wife had showed hirselfe to be worse than a wild
beast. So let us mark that all such as cannot follow that order, are here
rebuked by the way, as if the holy Ghost had pronounced their condemnation in
express terms. Yet notwithstanding we see many men that have no discretion
when God is so gracious too them as too give them children. Look upon a married
man. True it is that the marriage is already of it self, so holy a thing, that
this only saying ought to suffice when it is said, that they shall be two in
one flesh, and that a man shall make more account of the unity which he ought
to have with his wife, than of the unity which he has with his father and
mother. But when as God yet for further confirmation of the said grace, adds
increase of children in marriage: if men and women be so beastly, as not to be
provoked and led thereby, to love one another the better: certainly their
unkindness is tooto gross. Howbeit (as I have said already) it is a thing
that is evil practiced among Christians. Nevertheless it behooves us too take
profit of that saying, though it be not touched here but by occasion. To
increase the evil, Job says that both his friends and also the men of his
counsel, that is too say, those with whom he was wont to communicate all
his secrets turned themselves against him, or else scorned him, so as they
made none account of him: and that not only they which were in some credit and
authority, but also even the meanest sort, and the very rascals despised him.
In effect his meening is, that he found himself destitute of all help,
seeing that his friends had failed him: and secondly that he had bin a
scorningstocke, insomuche as even the basest sort in the world vouchsafed not
to look upon him to take him as one of their retinew. It must needs be said
that his affliction was great, seeing there was none that would acknowledge him
to be as it were of the company of men: but took him already for more than
an outcast. Lo in effect what Job meant too say. But (as I have touched
already) Gods will in exercising him so, was too make him a myrrour unto us.
Then if it happen that those which are nearest about us become our deadly
enemies and persecute us, let us learn to flee unto God, and to bear it
patiently, seeing it happened so unto Job before us. And specially (forasmuch
as the same perteyneth to all the members of his Church) let us bear in mind
this saying of our Lord Jesus Christ: he that eats bread at my table, has
lyfted up his heel against me. This must needs be fulfilled in all the
faithful: and therefore Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my
friends, for the hand of the Lord has touched me already. True it is that
when we see God punish men, we ought of duty to glorify him, saying: Lord
thou art rightuous. Howbeeit there is a special consideration in Job, how
that his punishment was not for any fault that he had committed, but for some
other end. And again, put the case that he had bin chastized for his deserts:
yet notwithstanding, Have pity upon me my friends, because the band of God
has smitten me. For the better understanding hereof, we must take this
ground, That it is a dreadful thing to fall intoo the hands of the living
God. Therefore when we see God send any punishment, it behooves us to be
moved with fear, yea even although he spare us. I my self am at rest, and God
makes no countenance too touch me, but I see how he smites one, and
punishes another: is not this a matter too be astonished at? Must we tarry
till God fall upon our heads with many blows? That were over gross dealing.
But when we see he is minded to teach us at another man's cost, it behooves us
too have an eye to the cause why he punishes men so, according as Saint Paul
tells us. He says not, be afraid, for the wrath of God shall come upon
you: but he says my friends, ye see how God punishes the unbelievers,
while he spares you. Yet must you understand that it is for your instruction
when he she weth any token of his wrath upon men. Then let us mark well this
sentence of the Apostle, that it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands
of the living God: and therefore as often as there is any punishment, let us be
moved at it. And thereby we shall out of hand be taught to pity such as are
in distress, and too say, Alas this is a poor creature, if it were some
mortal wight that afflicted him, a man might give him some relief. But God is
against him: and ought not we to be sorry when we see that? If any man
allege, were it not a resisting of God if we should be sorry for those that
are punished for their faults? were it not as much as too strive against Gods
justice? No for we may well have such affections in us, as to allow of Gods
justice, yielding him praise and glory for that which he does: and yet
nevertheless be sorry for them that are punished, because we our selves may
have deserved as much or more, and ought too seek the welfare of all men,
speecially of those that are nearest to us, and where God has put any band
betwixt them and us, according as we may allow of civil justice which is
nothing else but as it were a little glass of Gods justice, and yet not cease
too have pity upon the offender. When a transgresser is punished, men will
not say that he has wrong done unto him, nor that there is any cruelty in
the Judge. But they will say, that such as are set in place of justice,
discharge their duty, and offer an acceptable sacrifice unto God when they
put an offender to death. But yet in the mean while we will not cease to
pity the poor creature that shall suffer for his evil doings. If we be not
moved thereat, there is no manhood in us. If we grant this in worldly justice,
which is but as a little spark of Gods justice: I pray you when we come too
the sovereign seat [of iustice] on high, ought we not first too glorify God
for all that he does, assuring our selves that he is just and upright in all
points and in all respects? And yet notwithstanding (as I said before) the same
shall not hinder us too pity such as suffer punishment, too comfort them and
too succoure them, and when we can do them no more good, to wish their
salvation, praying God to make their corrections profitable in drawing them
home to him, and not too suffer them to become hardharted, and to strive
against his hand. Behold (I say) whereunto Job groundeth him self when he
desires and beseeches his frinds to have pity upon him. And he speaks
purposely to those that were next about him. For although God have generally
set an unity among all men, that is too say, although he has knitte them
altogether (as I have said before) and that they ought not to separate them
selves one from Why do you persecute me as God does? It should seem that
this saying has no great reason in it. For (as I have touched already) it is
Wherefore (says he) can ye not satisfy your selves with my flesh? It is
certain that the thing which he takes is a similitude. For when we be (as
ye would say) so flesht upon our neighbors: it is all one as if we would eat
them alive: And we also do often use such manner of speeches in our common
talk. So then like as a man takes pleasure at his repast in eating and
drinking: so it seems that they which are cruel against their neighbors,
could find in their hearts too feed upon them, and to eat them up, or to
swallow them quick. Ye see then why Job says, Why do ye not satisfy your
selves with my flesh? For when we see our neighbors have adversity enough
and more than enough, and yet are not satisfied with it, but increase their
miseries further: it is to great a cruelty, it is all one as if we would eat
them up. Therefore this circumstance is too be noted well when Job says, that
at leastwise his friends ought to have been satisfied to see him so
overthrown. What would ye more says he? I am at the last cast so as I can
hold out no longer. If we have hated a man and wished his harm, and sought
all means to be revenged of him, yet if he happen to fall into extreme
misery, behold it is a natural thing for our anger to be appeased. Yet say
I not that such an affection ought to be counted a virtue. For although the
heathen men were wicked, and thought it lawful for them too revenge: yet
notwithstanding they were of that mind, that they would be appeased when they
saw their enemies so sore afflicted, as that they needed not to put too their
hand. As how? Admit a man have done some other man harm. Well, he that is
offended would revenge himself if it were possible. Now in the mean while
God preuenteth him, and sends some great misfortune upon the offender. The
man that ere while was full of rancor and desired nothing but to destroy him
whom he hated, will say, yea, and what shall I do more to him? He is so
oppressed as it is pity to see, he has enough already. Thus then the fire
does naturally quench of it self, if we see a man in adversity, though we
were never so much moved against him before. This (as I said) is no virtue,
neither deserves it to be counted for Gods service, or for charity. But yet
for all that, if there were such a natural inclination even among the Painims:
what shall become of those which now adays are not satisfied when they see
their enemies persecuted with extremity: but are so insatiable as they could
find in their hearts even to eat them up? And if it be damnable when it is done
to a man's enemies, so as he is not contented with the miseries that that his
bone cleaued too his skin, and that he was escaped with the skin betwixt
his teeth. This serves to express the matter better which we come to touch:
that is to wit, that his friends ought of right to have bin satisfied though
they had been very beasts and had sought but to devour him. And why? For
(says he) ye see in what state I am. What desire ye more? Can a man wish any
more misery in one person than God has O that my words were written, O that
they were ingraued with a pen of iron, O that they were ingraued in lead or
stone for ever, and for an endless memorial. In saying so, Job declares that
he had not mainteyned his innocence in vain, neither feared to be blamed for
it before God, for he knew he had just cause so to do. Thus ye see in effect
whereat he ameth. Nevertheless it is certain that in respect of Jobs words,
there was excess and much bytalke. For he kept not measure, and how good and
reasonable ground soever he had, and that his case were allowable before God:
yet did he misconuey it (as I have declared heretofore) and many words
escaped him that were blamewoorthie. Why then says he still, that he would
feign that his words were written? Is it not enough too bring double
condemnation upon his own head? Let us mark that Job has an eye too the
principal point, and tyeth not himself to every word that he had uttered:
but takes his sayings here for the defense of his case. Now that defense was
just. And although it were missehandled and often lept out of, now at one side
and now at other: yet notwithstanding he still mainteyned rightly that he was
not punished for his sins, nor was to be counted the wickeddest man in the
world, because God showed himself so rigorous too him. Job then has set
down this thing upon good reason: but yet has he done amiss in that he
acknowledged not his sins in such wise as he might feel himself always
faulty before God. Hereby we be warned to be very well advised what we
say. It is said in the Psalm, I determined with my self to hold my peace,
and too bridle my self so long as the wicked bare sway and had their full
scope: but in the end I could not refrain. David knew well, that when Gods
children are tempted, by seeing themselves oppressed with afflictions, while
the wicked sort triumph and have wind and weather at will: it is so sore a
case, as we can very hardly refrain our selves from murmuring against God. For
this cause it is said, I determined too bridle my self, I did put on a
snaffle, and I coped up my lips, too the intent I might not speak a word.
But in the end all these lets were broken, and all the determination that I
purposed upon, could not hold me from uttering the desire that I had
conceived within, but that finally the fire kindled and brake out. Hereby David
shows that it is a very great and rare virtue to be pacient with silence,
and to hold our tongue when miseries oppress us, and specially when we see
the wicked men's mouths open to boast themselves and too scoff at us. So then,
by joining this saying of David's with the example of Job, we must learn too
keep our mouth shut when God afflicts us. And why? For our affections are so
headie, that although we have learned to speak simply, and to praise and
bliss God as we ought to do: yet can we not be so well advised, nor so well
stayed, but something will escape us, and some bubbles will burst out, so as
we shall always be faulty in our talk. Then although we have no intent
too blaspheme God, or too speak any thing that may not be to his honor: yet
can it not be avoided but we shall be ouerhardie in our talk, like as when
Job desired too have all his sayings registered and ingraued for an everlasting
rememberance, and printed in stone or lead, too the intent it that he knows
that his redeemer lives. Verily this cannot be wholly expounded I know that my
God is alive, and that in the end ^ee will rise up upon the dust. As if he
should say, I am taken for a wicked man and desperate person as though I had
blasphemed God in laboring to justify my self against him. No no, I desire
nothing but to humble my self unto him, and too repose my self wholly in his
grace: but yet for all that I must be feign to mainteyne mine uprightness
against you. For I see you go to work with nothing but slanders. My defense
then is after such a sort, as in the mean while I look unto God and have
mine eyes fastened upon him. Hereof we both may and ought too gather a good
lesson: which is, that we must not be so popeholie as to cover our faults
before men, and too make countenance of mainteyning a good case, and to bear a
face of honest men: and yet all the while to be reproved of our own
conscience. Rather let us learn too enter into our selves, to examine our own
sins, and too cite our selves before God: let us (I say) begin at this
point to say, how now? what intend I? True it is that I may well excuse my
self before men: but in the mean time what shall that boot me before God?
Will he accept it? No. Therefore according too this, let us all come before
the heavenly Judge both great and small, and let every one of us present
himself there too crave pardon of his offenses, and let us not doubt but that
if we come unfeignedly, he will acquit us, not for any worthiness of our own,
but of his own grace and mercy.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as being right cast
down as we ought to be, we may repair to the sovereign refuge of his
infinite goodness which he has promised us in our Lord Jesus Christ, and
there take so sure foundation, as we may not doubt of his favor toward us:
yea and that although we do not always feel the same after that sort in
this world by the outward woorking, but rather that he shows us some
tokens of rigor: yet we may not cease too call upon him in all our
adversities, not doubting but that in the end he will show him self a loving
and merciful father toward us, and make us feel it by proof also in time
convenient. That it may please him too grant this grace not only to us, but
also to al people, etc.

The.lxxij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xix. Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth still the exposition of the five and twentieth verse,
and then the text following.

26 Although after my skin, the [vvoormes] destroy this [bodie: yet] I shall
see God in my flesh.

27 I shall behold him in me, mine eyes shall see him, and none other: my
kidneyes are waste in my bosom.

28 And you have said, wherein is he persecuted? and the root of the matter
is found in me.

29 Be ye afraid of the presence of the svvorde: for the wrath of affliction
is with the svvorde, to the intent ye should know that there is a judgment.


YEsterday we saw what protestation Job made: which was, that he had his eye
upon God, and was not tied too men, because that they which rest themselves
here by low, are not willing to enter into their own consciences, too condemn
themselves as they ought to do, and to feel their own sins, that they might
confess themselves to have done amiss, and crave forgiveness at Gods hand.
For we see that as soon as we be flesht among men, we desire that he knows
that his redeemer is alive: as if he should say that his pleading hitherto had
not bin to justify himself in such wise before men, as though that were the
mark he shot at: for he knew he should be feign to come before God and
there to be judged, and too render an account of all his that God shall stand
up fast upon the dust: as if he had said, When men fail (as the world must
needs perish) yet does God continue for ever: and therefore it were a great
folly in me to desire to excuse my self before men, when in the mean while
God should condemn me. For they that are my judges as now, whether they be
willing to be so, or whether I cast that honor upon them, must perish with
me, but God must continue for ever. So then it suffizeth me to yield my self
unto him, and too hear what it shall that God shall stand up upon the dust:
he meeneth that he is not like men. For seeing we must all of us fade away even
till we come to nothing, and we know we must return from whence we came,
even intoo corruption and rottenness. But God (says he) can never decay as
men do: he will continue in his state everlastingly. Again let us mark, that
Job meant to do us to understand, that God will spread out the same power that
is in him, upon the dust, that is too say upon men who are nothing, ne have
any Being, but also spreads it out upon men. Here is a good lesson for us.
For first of all we be warned what a fondness it is to be desirous to please
men only, and to be allowed of men. What gain we by it? For every whit of it
must fall to the ground. Therefore let us learn too have our eyes fastened
upon God, that he may like of us, and allow of us. Mark whereunto we must
apply all our indeuer. And heerewithall, to the intent we be not hilde back
by this world, nor wrapped woormes be not set down in the Hebrewe text, yet
it is well seen that he meeneth all vermin and corruption) having eaten his
skin, will also gnawe and fret away the rest of him, and yet for all that he
says that he trusts too see God, yea and too see him in his flesh, that
is to say, by being restored again. Yea (says he) I shall see him, and none
other, notwithstanding that my kidneyes be consumed in me, that is to say,
that all my strength be weakened and taken away. It is a protestation worthy
to be noted, when Job says that he will have his look fastened upon God
and none other, yea even though he be utterly consumed* As if he should say,
he would not measure the hope that he had in God, by that which he might see:
but even when nothing appears, yet will he not therefore cease too look
unto God. As how? If a man find himself forsaken of God, so as he perceive
nothing but matter of despair, and death manace him on all sides, yea and is
ready to swallow him up, and yet nevertheless he holds his own still, and is
steadfast in faith to say, yet will I call upon my God, and I shall yet feel
his help, his mightiness is enough of it self too give us courage, yea and
that shall be even when I shall seem to be forlorn: That is the man that
ouerpasseth all worldly things. The showing of his faith and hope which he
has in God, is not in the things that may be seen and comprehended by
natural reason: but it passes out of the world, according as it is said
that we must hope beyond hope, and that hope is of things that are hidden.
Now we see Jobs meening. True it is that he speaks not here expressly of
the Resurrection. But yet these words cannot be expounded, but it must be
peceyued that Job meant to attribute such a power unto God, as is not to be
seen as now in the common order of nature. Therefore it is all one as if he
had said, that God will have us to know him, not only while he does us good,
and while he preserves and nurrisheth us: but also although he fail us to our
seeming, and we see nothing but death before us: yet must we be fully
resolved, that our Lord will not leave to be our keeper, and that if we be
his, we shall be maynteyned by his protection. Howbeit the better to profit
ourselves by this sentence, let us wey thoroughly what Job says. that he
shall see his redeemer in his flesh? his meening is (as I said before) that he
shall be restored to a new state, though his skin were so eaten as it was.
For he says expressly that his bones shall be consumed, and nothing of him
shall remain whole: and afterward he adds, I shall set God in my flesh.
And how shall he see him in his flesh* That is to say, I shall be set in my
former state, and see my God yet again. And so he confesses that God is able
enough too set him up again, although he were utterly consumed, and plunged
into a bottomless pit. Thus ye see that the condition whereupon we must
trust in God, is that when he shall have laid us in our graves, we should
assure our selves, that he will reach us his hand to lift us out again.
Therefore let us say, I trust in God because I see he assisteth me and fails
me not in any thing. But when God fails us, and is as it were estraunged from
us, let us even then say with Job, I shall see him in my flesh, as now I am
nothing, I seem to be but a shadow, and my life vanishes away out of hand:
but yet for all that, my God will show himself mighty in my behalf, so as I
shall see him. If Job spoke thus in the time when there was not yet any great
learning, nor perchance the Law was yet written: (but admit it were) another
were there yet any Prophets, (at leastwise not any mo than Moses, for the
Prophets make mention of Job as of a man of old time:) I say if Job having but
only a little spark of light, was so strengthened in his afflictions: and that
not only when he saw some one kind of death, but also when God seemed to have
set him as a spectacle among men, (a dreadful and terrible thing) he was able
to say, yet shall I see my God: what excuse is there for us in these days when
God shows us the resurrection so nearly and expressly, and gives us so many
goodly promises of it? And specially considering how we see the mirror and
substance thereof in our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he has rayzed again to the
intent to put us out of doubt that we shall one day be parttakers of the same
immortal glory. Then if after so much assurance, we cannot be brought to be
of the same belief that Job was of: must we not needs be charged with
unthankfulness? For if we could embrace Gods promises with true faith, would
they not be of sufficient power to make us to mount over all the temptations
that do so reign over us? So then let us mark well this text, that we may
say with S. Paul, That if this cotage of our body were gone (for he terms it
a cotage as a thing made of leaves, or as a shed that is nothing worth) we
have a much better and excellenter buylding prepared for us in heaven. If this
outward man, that is to say, if all that pertayneth too this present life and
all that is seen, were done away: yet would God renew us again, yea and he
makes us already to behold our resurrection after a sort, in that we see our
bodies waste away after that manner: according also as in another text the
same S. Paul sends us too the seed that is cast into the earth, saying that
the same cannot grow to have a lively root, and to yield good fruit, except
it first rotte. Do we then see that death has dominion over us? Let us
mark that God is minded to give us a true life, that is to say the heavenly
life which is purchaced for us by the precious blood of his Son. If that were
not, the least temptation in the world would overcome us. For (as I have said
already) all the miseries that we have too suffer, are as many messages of
death. Now if we saw death and thought it should make clean riddance of us
must we not needs utterly quayle? Then is there none other mean to comfort us
in our afflictions, but only this doctrine, that when all that ever is in us,
in consumed, yet shall we not cease to see our God, yea and to see him in our
flesh. Afterward it is said, Mine eyes shall behold him, and none other. Job
adds this as continuing that he should see God in his flesh,) has a
relation to experience, that God should set him up again upon his feet. But
that which he speaks now, Although my kidneyes be wasted in my bosom: that
is too say, although there be no more strength nor courage in me. To be short
(following the matter that he had entered intoo already) he shows that his
looking unto God is not because he had lived at his ease, because God had sent
him all his hearts desire, or because he had been preserved in his afflictions:
but clean contrariwise. Although I be in such distress (says he) as God
seems to thunder upon me, and there is no more strength and courage in me:
yet will I look unto my God with mine eyes, and hold me wholly unto him, and
I know I shall see him again as my redeemer and keeper, even after he shall
have so consumed me. And for a conclusion he says to his friends: You have
said, wherefore is he persecuted, or wherefore do we persecute him? for the
root of the case [or matter] is found in me. This sentence is somewhat dark,
because the words may be taken two ways. Wherefore is he persecuted? or
wherefore do we persecute him? If we take wherefore is he persecuted, the
meening is that Jobs friends marueled why God had handled him so roughly: and
therefore they concluded that it was to be said that he was a man utterly
forsaken of God. But if ye translate it, How do we persecute him? the meening
will be that they are come of prepensed malice to take him in a trip, and to
byte at him. Although there be diversity as touching the words: yet does the
meening come all to one end. Let us consider the doctrine that we have to
gather of it: for that is the principal yea and the whole matter. Job then
charge his friends that they had judged amiss of his afflictions. And why?
For even at the first dashe they fell to saying, o, needs must this man be
said to be a wicked doer, for had he walked with a good conscience, he should
not be so punished as he is. But contrariwise Job says, that the root of
the matter is found in him. True it is that the Hebrewe word signifies
sometime a Thing, or matter, and sometime a word, speech, or saying. But here
Job meeneth that he had a good and sure foundation, and that when men have well
sifted him, they shall find that his case is not such as other men have falsely
surmised. Now let us see to what purpose this geere tends, and what profit
we may reap by it. When Job tells his friends that they had said,
wherefore is he persecuted? He shows that it is a great cruelty for men to
seek out other men's sins when they see one beaten with Gods rods: and to
say needs must this be a wicked man, therefore let us sift his life, for that
is the point which we must begin at. True it is (as has bin said more at
large heretofore) that in all the corrections and chastizements which God
sends, we must always behold his Justice upon men's sins: but that must
be to condemn our selves. We must not judge other men, and let our selves
slip. Let us begin, I say let us begin at our selves. Thus we see that the
use of this doctrine is, that when any man is pressed with adversity, we must
not be hasty too condemn him, and specially we that the root of the case
(or the root of the matte^, or the effect and substance of it) is in him.
Hereby he meeneth, that men must try before they judge. And in good soothe,
every man will grant that if we should step to it at all adventure, it were a
foolish presumption and ouerweening in us, and it is a very common Proverb
among us to say, A fools bolte is soon shot. But yet for all this, we cease
not to hazard our selves still, without any searching or examining how the case
stands. Wherefore Be ye afraid of the presence of the sword: for the wrath of
iniquity or of the affliction of the sword is at hand, to the end ye should
know that there is a judgment. This present saying is somewhat dark enough,
because the words are cut off: but the effect of Jobs intent in saying, Be ye
afraid before the sword, is all one as if he had said, ye speak here as in
the shadow, ye discourse at your pleasure as they that have nothing to do and
are at their own leisure. Such folks may dispute at will: like as there be
none that make better battelles than they that are furthest off from blows.
For they give the onset, they besiege towns, they flea, they forray, and they
sack Cities, so as it is a wonder too see them. But when they have well
discoursed, and come too marching forewarde indeed: they do no sooner hear
the sound of the drum, but their courage is quite quayled. Job therefore
blames his friends for reasoning so of his case at leisure, and tells the^
that they must take hold of Gods justice and be afraid of the swoorde, as if
he showed it the^ already. And again he says, the wrath of iniquity. This
saying poynteth at the cruelty which he had vpbrayded them with before. The
wrath then is as much too say, as you chase against me, and that is too
grieve me. For the Hebrew word may signify both Iniquity and Affliction. But
here Job declares that his friends are not come unto him for any compassion of
his misery, but rather to chafe, yea and to grieve him and vex him the more.
And what is imported in that? The swoorde (says he.) That is to say, God will
not suffer such outrage unpunished. For although I had offended you, yet ought
you to be more courteous toward me. But now in condemning me without cause, ye
show nothing but rigorousnesse against me. Therefore must Gods sword be
drawn out against you, verily to the end ye may know that there is a
judgment. Behold a notable and very profitable sentence. For in rebuking his
friends after that sort, Job is as a Prophet of God, that speaks generally
to all men in common. The thing then that he tells us, is that if we be
malicious to judge evil of the thing that is good, and churlish in tormenting
and vexing them that are miserable enough already: we have the sword of God to
be afraid of. It is said, Cursed are you that call good evil, and evil good:
and yet notwithstanding we see that this vice has reigned at all times, and
reygneth still at this day. As for them that are carried by their affections,
what conscience make they too spite God openly? They have skill enough too say,
I see the case is good enough of it self: and yet notwithstanding they go
quite and clean against it. Such a man is desirous to serve God: but I will
stop him. Such a thing might be too the buylding up of the Church, and serve
to the maynteyning of fellowship among men, and to the furtherance of the common
weal: but I will overthrow it every whit. For ye shall see some even of those
that sit in the seat of Justice, who are as good as Devils incarnate in
spiting of God, and in overthrowing of al equity and right, and are full of
corruption and outrage. Now since we see this, what is to be said, but that we
be come to the top of all wickedness? As much is to be said of other men. For
it is to be seen, that there are another great nor small, but they work spite
against God. So then, is it not to be said that the Devil possesses men, since
they give themselves so to overthrow all goodness, and to mainteyne evil,
specially seeing that so horrible a curse is pronounced by the mouth of the
Prophet, against all such as shall say that evil is Be ye afraid of the
sword. To whom speaks he? To such as are puffed up against God and against
all right. For against whom do we make war but against God, when we go
about too turn light intoo darkness, and would oppress a good case?
Behold it is God whom we assail. So then we have good cause too be
afraid, yea though we trouble but some one poor man, by heaping some new
vexacion upon him. For God sets himself against us: he says that he
that the wrath of iniquity shall bring the sword: as if he should say, true
it is that as now to the intent ye should know. True it is that these men were
no doltes, such as knew not that there is a God in heaven who is judge of the
world: No, they were men of skill of experience, as we have seen by their
talk, and shall see hereafter by Gods leave. Why then does Job say unto
them, to the intent ye should know? It is because men being blinded by their
naughty affections, know not God, but believe that when they have once drawn a
curtayne between God and themselves, God should not see them any more, nor be
able to punish them as they deserve. Then let us look upon the sword,
although we see it not yet with our eyes: that is to say, Although God do not
yet show us any signs that he is minded too punish us, and too make us know
that he is the judge of the world: and let us think that he is desirous
to draw us to him, and to show that he will not use any excessive rigor
toward us, specially if we be not rigorous toward our neighbors.
Furthermore let us understand, that it is not enough for us to absteyne from
all evil: but it behooves also too help all such as are in adversity. For
though a man could protest, that he has absteyned from all injury and doing
of wrong: yet shall he not therefore be discharged before God. And why? For he
ought to help and succor those that have need of succoure. Now if they that
have absteyned from evil doing are not quit before God, but are hilde as
offenders, I pray you what shall we say of those which do nothing else but
practice mischief day and night, and are always devising how they may
trouble and vex now this man and now that man? When wicked men do so sharpen
their wits of set purpose to hurt their neighbors: is it not reason that Gods
sword should by and by be sharpened against them? Then let us bethink our
selves, and not only be ready to relieve such as are in necessititie: but
also (for as much as there is so much misery and wretchedness through the
whole world) let us have pity and compassion of them that are far off, and
let our sight extend even thither to them, (accordingly as charity ought too
inflame all mankind) and let us pray God to vouchsafe to pity them that are
so distressed, and that when he has chastized them with rods, he will bring
them home to himself, and make all that to turn to their salvation, in so much
that whereas we have now occasion to sigh, we may then rejoice together, and
praise his name with one common accord.

Now let us cast our selves down in the presence of our good God with
acknowledgemente of our faults, praying him to make us feel the^ in such
wise, as we may have regard to amend them: and that therewithal every one of
us may have a mind to humble himself under Gods mighty hand, and in stead
of condemning others, learn to feel the euilles that are in our selves, so as
we may seek to him to purge and cleanse us, till he have clothed us fully with
his own righteousness. And so let us say Almighty God our heavenly father,
etc.

The.lxxiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xx. Chapter.
SOphar the Naamathite ansvvered and said.

2 My thoughts enforce me to answer, and hastiness is in me.

3 I have heard the correction of my reproach, and the spirit of mine
understanding enforces me to answer.

4 Have thou not known the time of old, since God placed man upon the earth,

5 That the advancement of the wicked is but of short time, and that the joy
of hypocrites shall not endure.

6 Though they be lifted up to heaven, and have raised their head above the
clouds:

7 Yet shall they perish as their own dung: and they that have seen the^
shall say, where are they?


THat we may the better profit by this doctrine, we have to bear in mind,
how it has been declared before, that such as incountered with Job, saying
that God leaves not the wicked unpunished, have taken a ground that it is
true in it self, but they applied it amiss to the person of Job. And this is
a cause why we ought to pray always unto God to give us skill and discretion
to know how to that the spirit of his understanding enforced him to answer:
if it were so that God governed it, and that this saying were rightly placed:
then had he reason to say so. For (as I said) when God shall have disclosed
any good thing unto us, the same must not be drowned by us, but rather we
must bring it to light. And here ye see why it is said, that when we have
believed then must we speak. So then faith must not be a dead thing, but she
must utter her self. And S. Paul does well verefie the said sentence of the
Psalm. For he shows that it is not lawful for him to do it, because God
had given him understanding, which ought to serve the whole world: and
therefore that he utters the treasure which was committed to him, knowing
well that it was not a particular thing for any one man, but for the profit
and instruction of the whole Church. And verily every one of us must apply
this lesson to himself. For we shall see many that will say, it is enough if
every man believe in his own heart, as who would say that the thing which God
has joined together, might be separated by men. But we have seen already
the record of David: which is, that such as believe ought to speak by and by.
For except they do so: they show that they by their malice do bury that
thing which God would have published abroad: according a^ it is said that
men light not a candle too put it under a busshell, or to hide it: but to set
it upon a candelsticke that it may shine al about. Furthermore now and then*
when a man has received any gift, he thinks ^^ is to win himself credit
and estimation above other man. But contrariwise in so doing we disgrace Gods
gifts by making them to serve to any vainglory. It is not for that purpose that
God deals his gifts more to one than to another, but to the end we should
do men good with them. Therefore let every of us have a care to advance and to
spread abroad that which God has committed unto him: and as for them that
have not received so much, let them nevertheless be brought by that means to
salvation, whereunto God calls us, too the end he might be glorified among
us. Mark that for one point. But yet must the other point press us more,
when Sophar says, that he had heard the correction of his reproach. He
speaks not this in respect of his own person only: but according to the
matter that he had dealt with before, he is angry to see Gods truth trodden
Have not thou known the time of old (says Sophar) eue^ since God did set man
upon the earth? how that the highness of the wicked is but of short time,
and that the joy of hypocrites or transgressors shall not endure? He takes
here a principle that is good and true: which is, that if we take the life
of the despyzers of God to be happy, we be deceived. And why? For their
happiness is but a dream, as he will add in the similitude an on after. True
it is that most men will say that the wicked are unhappy. But what for that?
we ouershoote ourselves: for if we see a man live easily, or that the
highness of the wicked is but of short time. And why? For although they were
lifted up to heaven, or reached up to the clouds with their heads: yet should
they not continue, but God would throw them down out of hand. Here Job
continues the matter that we saw before: that is to wit, that God will now and
then suffer the wicked to be advanced and too flourish: but it shall not endure
long. Now had Sophar considered this well: he would no more have stood in
contention with Job: but forasmuch as he takes a general sentence, and
applies it amiss: he goes ouerthwartly to work. Yet notwithstanding (as I
have said) this doctrine deserves to be received as coming from the holy
Ghost: and there is no more for us to do, but too look advisedly upon it, and
to apply it conveniently. Therefore let us go foreward with the matter. It is a
very troublous temptation to us, to see the wicked in prosperity. For we would
feign that God should show himself as he is: that is too wit, that he cannot
away with the wicked, but throws them down because he hates and abhors
them. If we our selves do amiss, we would have God to spare us: and there is
none of us but he thinks God to be ouerhastie in punishing us. When we have
committed one sin, two, or three: if God chastize us, we think it too soon,
we cannot away with it. But if another man have done never so little a fault,
we would have God to thunder upon him out of hand. Lo whereunto hypocrisy
leads us. But what is to be done on the contrary part? We must be contented
too see the wicked triumph for a time in the world, and too have their full
scope, and too live in ease and pleasure, and not be grieved at it, no not
although we our selves be in the mean while in adversity and trouble. And
why? For by that mean God intends too try our faith. If we saw things to
be such as they shall be in the end, as God shows us the^ by his word:
would we put any trust in him. No. We would believe nothing til we saw it. But
when as we perceive not the thing that God speaks so soon as we would, and
yet nevertheless continue still steadfast in his word, resting upon that which
has proceeded out of his mouth* that is the thing wherein we show our selves
too believe him. And so let us mark well that when God does so lay the bridle
upon wicked and ungodly folks necks: it is to try whither we have served him
purely, and whither we have patiently given him leave too do what he will,
without lifting up of our selves against him. Also there is yet more, that God
will have us too learn that our Paradise is not in this world. But we would
feign live in pleasure, and that God should dandle us like little cockneyes.
That were not for our behoof, but clean contrary. For unless God drew us to
him by afflictions: we that the loftiness of the wicked is but for a short
time. And now he adds, that their joy shall be of* no long continuance.
Whereby he meeneth that the despyzers of God and al such as are tied to the
world, do over joy themselves in the present prosperity, and are utterly
drunken with it. True it is that the children of God may well be merry when
they have prosperity, like as when God sends us wherewith to be fed and
maynteyned, when he deals so with us as we want nothing, when he gives us
health, that the joy of the wicked shall not endure long. Furthermore let us
mark that Sophar was beguyled by mistaking these words, a short time, and of
small continuance. For when the Scripture says that the wicked vanish away,
and that God will consume them in the turning of a hand: it is not meant that he
keeps one ordinary stint, as I have declared already. And why? for if God
should do so, what should be reserved till the latter day? we would be wedded
to this world, and not wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ to
accomplish our resurrection and redemption. Our Lord therefore is feign to
reserve many, yea and the most part of things till his last judgment. But yet
in the mean while it is always his office to destroy the wicked, and to show
that they be but of short continuance. And in good sooth let us consider well
what our life is, and we shall se^ that the thing which lasts longest time
in this world, does but pass by and slip away in the turning of a hand. We
be such fools, that if God lift not up his hand the first day to destroy
such as have offended: we are of opinion that the time will never come. And
why? It seems to us that this life lasts long, and yet, we grant it is but
a shadow: for every man must away hence spite of his teeth. Therefore when it
is said unto us, that the wicked continue not any long time: let us learn
that it is not meant that our Lord riddes them out of hand. For although they
come too the years of fifty or threescore: yet cease they not too be
trained on still by Gods hand to their decay and confuzion. To be short, we
must be pacient and wait with silence what God will do, without such boiling
and hastiness as Sophar is wont to use here. Behold I say how it behooves us
too apply this doctrine, if we intend to fare the better by it. And truly it
is a right necessary point for us. For we shall see many offended at the
reading of the promises in the holy Scripture, (as that God will bliss those
that are his, that he will lead them in all their ways, that he will bring
all their devices too good end, that they shall live in prosperity, that they
shall be blissed at his hand, both in themselves, and in their offspring, and
their cattle, at home and abroad, and in their possessions, and that they
shall be preserved by the grace of God. And on the contrary part we see, that
the children of God endure so great scarcity and so many miseries, as is
rufull. Sometime they have not so much as one morsel of bread to put into
their mouth, and they be smirten with diseases and al other calamities: while
in the mean time the wicked whom God had threatened, do prosper. We be
astonished at that, that we seem to lose when the wicked shall have lifted up
their head to the sky, and reached to the clouds: God will find means well
enough to throw them down, yea and to sink them even into hell. Lo what the
end of the wicked shall be, which seek nothing but to advance themselves.
True it is that God does erewhiles exalt his servants to honor and dignity:
but yet do they not cease to be lowely still all the while. When a man is
governed by Gods spirit, although he be a great Prince and honored of the
whole world, and God has reached him his hand to exalt him highly: yet will
he present time.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of ou^ faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as thereby we may be
taught to mislike of our selves since we be so wretched creatures as we cease
not to offend, and that therewithal we may with true lowlynesse receive all
the chastizementes that he shall send us, so as we may daily more and more
stoup under his mighty hand: and that being so stricken down, we may
notwithstanding not cease to walk as he commands, with our hearts and
minds lifted up by faith and hope unto the kingdom of heaven, continuing
nevertheless as little ones in this world: how be it not as babes in wit,
but as babes in malice: to the intent that being bereft of all vain
presumption and selfeliking, we may so serve one another, as God may be
honored of us all with one accord. That it may please him to grant this
grace, not only to us, but also to all people, etc.

The.lxxiiij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xx. Chapter.
This Sermon goes on with the exposition of the.vij. verse, and then with the
text that is added here.

8 He shall vanishe away as a dream and not be found again, he shall pass
away as a vision in the night.

9 The eye that has seen him shall see him no more, His place shall no more
know him.

10 His children shall faune upon the poor, his hands shall restore his riches.

11 His bones shall be full of his youth, and it shall lie down with him in
the dust.

12 If evil be svveete in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue.

13 He will spare it, and not let it go, but keep it in the mids of his
palate.

14 His meat in his bowels shall be turned into the gall of an Adder within
him.

15 He has svvallovved up riches, and he shall spue them up again, and God
shall pluck them out of his belly.


Here Sophar goes forward with the doctrine that was glaunced at yesterday:
that is too wit, as their own dung, for so do the Hebrews term their
turning, as it were said that they shall go out as dung, and they speak it in
way of disdeine vision in the night, which passes away incontinent. To be
short, he says that such as have seen them in great estate and authority,
shall know them no more, another shall there be any hope for them to recover
their place over us, let us learn to esteem those things as dung and filth,
which the world has in great reputation. Lo what we have to do when we see
men clap their hands at the wicked and in manner honor them as Gods. Therefore
in the mean while let us be pacient, in waiting for the end, assuring our
selves that they be but dung before God. But there is also this point more too
be noted: namely that their place shall know them no more, and that the eye
which has seen them shall see them no more. Whereby Sophar meeneth that the
wicked shall a Dream in the night, and as the phancies that men conceive.
True it is that the life of man in it self may well be called a dream. For
what do men here until our Lord have enlightened them and made them know
that they be ordained to a better life? What do they (I say) but only dream?
All such as ween to get wealth and to heap up riches here bylowe, cease
not too run seeking here and there, and too make large circuites: and yet
notwithstanding they come always to one point, which is, to think upon nothing
else but gathering: and all that is but a dream. What other vices so ever men
be infected with, I pray you have they any certain mark or any resting place
so long as they be entangled in this world? Have they a clear mind to
understand that God calls them? No. Have they their thoughts well settled?
Have they their affections well ordered? No not at all. They do but dream. To
be short, if all things were well serched by peecemeale which men purpose and
devise, which they take in hand, and which they do: it would be found that
their whole state is but like a dream or fancy that a man conceyueth. And (as
I have said) such may man's life be generally said to be. But specially it
may be verefied of those that hold aloof from God and turn their backs upon
him. For in as much as they leave the light and wilfully seek after
darkness* it is meet for them to have such wages as they deserve: that is
too wit, to have their wits confounded, so as they may not be able to judge any
thing, nor to discern between white and black, but rather be ouerspred with
a [continuall] night to do nothing else but dream. And in deed we see also
how they transform things, and turn them clean contrary. Mark me a
despizer of God: he will bear himself in hand that he is able to work
wonders: and yet in the mean while he knows not that if God be his enemy,
he must needs perish, and that he may well fortify himself, but he shall not be
able to escape Gods hand that it fall not upon him as a hideous storm. But as I
said, for so much as the wicked do shun the light as much as they can, they
deserve that God should cast them as it were into an vnlightsome place, as it
were into a continual night, there to be wrapped round about with darkness.
Have they once their minds so dazeled, they conceive dreams and fancies, and
make themselves believe this and that. So then it is not without cause that the
holy ghost does here by the mouth of Sophar liken the wicked unto a dream. And
not only they disguise themselves after that sort, but we see that other men
also have a false opinion of the^* For if a wicked man be advanced, every man
reuerenceth him, yea and they envy his state and would (...)ne be like him,
And such as can not come at it, do oftentimes make an Idol of him.

Thus ye see in what case men are when they see the wicked prosper. But we
consider not that within them they have a woorme that gnaweth them without end
or ceassing, because Gods Justice follows them at the hard heels, and they
are always troubled in their consciences. Then know we not in what
perplexity and unquietness the wicked are because God has cursed them. But
we be bleared with a certain vayno show, and (as the proverb says) all
that glistereth is either gold or silver in our eyes. So then let us learn to
remember that which is showed us here: that is too wit, that we must no more
dream, nor be so led by our own misweening fancy. For God will skorne such
vanity, and show that in the end after we have been in darkness, a day will
come wherein we shall be brought too light, and when that day comes, men
shall see how his bones are full of his youth. The Hebrewe word that Sophar
uses here, does sometimes signify hid and secret sins: and surely the
Hebrewe word that signifies youth is derived youth in his own signification,
the meening will be, first that Sophar warranteth the wicked, that if they be
once given unto evil, they never return back again, that the bones of the
wicked are full of their youth: that is to wit, the wicked not only have some
fleeting lusts: as a man shall see some folk that have not any malicious
wilfulness in them, nor are utterly despyzers of God, but have still some
seed of godnesse, and would feign give themselves to weldoing, howbeit for as
much as they have no hold of themselves, nor are constant, as soon as they
meet with any provocation, they streit ouershoote themselves: we shall see
some such, (I say.) But Sophar meeneth much more here: that is to wit, they
have their bones full of naughtiness within, and are soked or steeped in it,
and they delight themselves in it. And we see also that when the devil
poisoneth men, it is not by stinging them lightly, but by sheading his venim
into the bottom of their heart, so as their wit and understanding may
conceive nothing but evil. Lo how God punishes such as have despyzed him,
and given themselves over to evil, so as they do daily appayre and wex ever
worse and worse. Hereby we see that it is not in man's choice to repent when
he lists, as these scoffers say, mocking God, with Tush, there needs but one
good sigh at the end. But who shall give them that sigh? Wherefore let us
beware that we welter not in our sins. For if they once get into our bones
and intoo our maree, our naughtiness will go with us to our grave, and well
may we strive against it, but yet must we be feign to dwell with it still in
our old skin. Therefore let us beware that such vengeance of God light not upon
us. Furthermore (as I have said) there is another lesson for us too gather out
his saying, that the bones of the wicked are full in their youth, and that they
shall lie down with them in their grave, where their naughtiness shall lie
with them says Sophar. Hereby he meeneth that when the wicked are (as ye
would say) ready too burst for fullness of goods and pleasures: God will make
them lean enough, so as they shall wither away, and be feign to go stark
naked to their grave. That serves too confirm the matter that was discoursed
not long before, that is to wit, that when the wicked have their own wish,
and are in their chief iollitie, so as they seem to be the happyest men in
the whole world: it is all one as if their bones had been full in their youth:
that is to say, as if God had first given them all that they could wish, and
afterward made them to lay themselves down to sleep. And with whom? Even
every man by himself alone: that is to say, with no more but only his bare
carkesse. For God vncaseth them, and when they be stripped stark naked, he
sends them to their grave. Hereby we be admonished, that when we see the
wicked men have meat and drink their fill, yea even till they burst, so as
their riches flow unto them more than they desire, and they be honored and
have all their pleasures: I say we be that if evil be sweet in their mouth,
they will hold it under their tongue, they will spare it without swallowing of it
down, and keep it still in the palate of their mouth, and further, that it
shall be turned into that wicked folks children shall flatter the poor, and
their hands shall restore the riches that they bad possessed. Hereby he does
us to understand that God will utter his vengeance and make it to be felt,
not only in the persons of those whom he speaks of: but also in their
children, according also as the Scripture that their hands shall restore their
riches. And that agrees with this that Sophar adds: namely, has he
deuowred? He must spewe it up again, and God will make him too restore the
thing that he has swallowed up. It is mente here, that the wicked may well
rake much toogither in a short time and inriche themselves: but they shall
never the sooner enjoy the goods that they have gotten. And why? For either
their children must be brought to poverty: or else they themselves must spue
them up again. For God will not tarry so long a time in making them too yield
up their account. But when they seem to be come to the full point of their
purpose, God must be feign to do a cure upon them, and make them to cast up
their stomachs, to rid them quite and clean of the great store of goods that
they had raked together. We see very many examples hereof: but yet there are
very few that think upon it. I say we see men pilling and scraping on all
sides. Well, God gives them the bridle, so as they have the means and
occasions to enrich themselves: they buy both house and lands, they turn the
penny, and they deal with merchandise: and so ye see them as full and as well
stuffed as may. But have they once swallowed up all, there that their own
bands shall restore their riches: how comes it too pass that they which
have so swallowed up all things, do stoop so low as to restore that which
they have raked together with their own hands? His meening is not that they
do it of their own accord. For the wicked would never come to that point by
their good wills, except God grant them a special grace too acknowledge,
Alas, I have done those men great wrong whom I have so polled and beguiled,
and therefore I that if evil be sweet in his mouth, he will hold it there.
See here the trim and fit similitude that Sophar uses. For it expresses at
what point the despyzers of God be: that is to wit, that look where they take
any pleasure, and look where they find any sweetness, there they hold
themselves and feed their humor: as for example, when a covetous man can
gather any goods, that is sugar and honnie to him. Surely it is as if a man
were hunger staruen, for although a piece of maet were another tastable nor
sauerie, yet will he chop it up. And it comes to pass (as Solomon says in
his proverbs) that he which is thoroughly a hungered thinks the meat that he
eats to be sweet, although it be bitter in deed. The wicked then are in
the same case: that is too say, in all their misdooings they find some
sweetness. And how comes that too pass? Because the devil sauceth them.
Look upon a whoremaister: if he be once chafed with his own lust, the devil
blinds him, and makes him find his sin so sweet, that all his delight is
in it. If a man be given to drunkenness, or too gluttony, he serves them of
the same sauce. Thus ye see how the wicked and the despyzers of God, do
find sweetness in all their misdooings. For they play as these liquerous
folk do, who lick their lips and hold it as if it were sugar, yea and
sometimes keep it up to the roof of their mouth, to hold the sweetness of it
the longer, and they be loath to swallowe it down to soon. We shall see some
of these liquerous sort that (as another body says) could find in their
hearts to have Cranes necks, to the intent that the favor of the meat might
tarry the longer with them? And if they meet with a cup of good wine, they
think they have never emptied the glass enough: but they would feign have the
sweetness of it to

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledging of
our sins, praying him, that he will not suffer us to yield our selves to
Satan's deceits: and that although of our own nature we be ready to turn
asidevnto the enticementes that, he offers us, yet we may be so hilde back
and restreyned by his holy spirit, as none of the lusts and affections of
our flesh may carry us away, to toss and turmoyle us, as they are wont to
do, but that we may steadfastly withstand the^, until that by the power of his
holy spirit we have gotten full victory, and be come to the mark which our
good God has set before us, that is, that being conformed too his glory, and
united too his son in his heavenly kingdom, we may have wherefore too
glorify and magnify him, and too rejoice fully in him. That it may please him
to grant this grace not only too us, etc.

The.lxxv. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xx. Chapter.
This Sermon goes on still with the exposition of the.xv. verse, and then with
the text following.

16 He shall suck the venim of the Adder, and the tongue of the Viper shall
slay him.

17 He shall not see the rivers and the streams that flow with honnye and
butter.

18 He shall restore that which he has gotten, it shall not tarry with him
according to the surenesse of his change, another shall he enjoy it.

19 He has gathered together and he shall be made poor, he has spoiled
the house and not builded it.

20 He shall not feel any contentation in his belly, another shall he be able
to keep his desire.


AMong the other corruptions that entice us to draw from God, and to give our
selves too evil doing, one is that men are simply persuaded that it is a
desirable thing to be rich, without regarding wherein riches consist, or that
the end of possessing them is to enjoy them. The world then is blind, so as it
knows not what it is to be rich, nor to what end and purpose men should be
rich. And so we see that the wretched unbelievers are wedded to this
affection, He has devoured [greate] goods, but he must spue them up again.
And why? For God will pluck them out of his belly. How comes it to pass that
the unbelievers bear themselves in hand, that the goods which they have gotten
shall continue always with them, and that they shall never be bereft of them?
It is because they perceive not that there is a God in heaven which must call
them to account as it is showed us here in this streine. For it is rightly
said that covetous folk do make just reckening that that the wicked shall
suck the poison of Adders, and that the viper shall kill the^: it is to show us
that God can well change all the sweetness where with the wicked do beguile
themselves. For if they entrap folk, they think themselves the happiest men
in the world. Too be short, it is their paradyse if they can entrap men on
all sides. But what? we must go to the end of them. For it is said that God
will change all, and turn that thing into Adders poison, which was thought to
be as sweet as honnie and sugar. Then let us simply follow the petition
wherein our Lord Jesus Christ has taught us to ask our daily bread of God.
For under that saying is comprehended that when God shall have given us what to
eat and drink, he must also voutsafe to turn the same into good nurrishment.
For it is not enough for us to have whereupon to feed: but our Lord must also
be feign too bliss i^ thoroughly, and to make it avail to our nurrishment. But
(as we shall see again anon) he that crammeth and glutteth him self with
much eating, is so far off from being suffized: that all of it shall be
turned into his bane. True it is that he may well be filled: but that shall be
after the manner of a wretched body that has the dropsy. For were a dropsiman
purged of that humor that is in his body, he should be better at ease with one
half cup of wine, and one bit of bread would do him more good, than all the
meat in the world. But forasmuchas he is full of naughty humors within: he
might drink up the Sea and the fisshes to (as men say) and yet be never the
better. Even so is it with them that have devoured al things cruelly like wild
that the wicked shall not see the rivers nor the streams that flow with butter
and honnie. Here we be done to understand, that the wicked shall be deprived
of the blissing that God has put us in trust with, knowing that we be but
stewards, and that his giving of them to us is upon condition, that we should
yield him a good and faithful account of them, by showing that none of us has
devoured them alone by himself, but made our neighbors partakers of them,
according to the ability that we have received. Thus ye see in effect what
is contained here. Now it is said, That the wicked shall restore that which
they have gotten, and that it shall not abide with them, no verily according to
the measure of their change, another shall they enjoy them. That which we have
herd heretofore, is expressed here more at full. How is it then that the
wicked are never satisfied, although they have gathered so much goods, as they
seem ready to burst? Wherefore do they always want? It is because our Lord
prospers not the things that they have in their hands. For like as a man
might cast much goods into a gulf and yet they should not be seen: so an
insatiable man may snatch and catch on all sides, and yet not cease to be
hungry still. And this comes of two causes. For as it is a singular grace of
That the wicked shall make restitution according to the lengthening of his
change. This saying may at the first blush seem somewhat dark: but it
contains a good lesson. For in effect it shows us, that the wicked must be
feign too restore the things which they have gotten with great labor. This is
for the first point, as if he should say, men are very blind and witless
when they take so great peines to get goods: for they must yield them up
again though they have never so much. And that is a very hard nippe (for we
know that the couetouse sort are wedded too their goods:) it is more than if
a man should break their bones and pluck out the maree of them. For the
goods that they possess are as dear to them as their own lives. Very far
are they led away, which consider not what goods were created for men's use,
and that they be but as an income to the present life. And yet notwithstanding
we see that the wicked torment themselves for them: and if they have never so
little harm or loss, it goes to the heart of the^ as if a man had cut their
throat a hundred times. But yet nevertheless they must be feign to restore
them, not with their good will, but because God plucketh them from them, as
has been said heretofore: yea even according too the prolonging of the
chaunges and rechaunges that they have made, so will God have his turn too
change also. And how is that? When a man is so gripple in gathering of
goods, and God gives him head, what will he do? He will so transpose things,
as it may seem he will make a new world. He impouerisheth him that was
rich, he abateth him that had much, and he pulls him down that was aloft. Lo
how the couetouse (as much as in them lies) do make a new world. And God (as
I said) gives them leave for a time to plow up all things, to men's seeming. Yea
but it is with venim and poison. They stuff themselves full: but that is but
too vomit it up again anon after, yea and to feel horrible bitterness by
that which they have swallowed down. But have they so changed all things?
that is to say, have they made such turnings as that they have lands and
possessions where they had none that it is because the wicked have impouerished
the good, and spoiled the houses which they builded not. Here we see that it
behooves us too consider Gods justice in all the punishments that he sends in
this world. Truly it were already a shall become of the sear tree? And so
let us tremble under the hand of God, praying him to grant us the grace to
enjoy the goods that he has put into our hands, as his intent is: or if it
please him to bereeue us of them: let us pray him to give us strength too bear
patiently the poverty that he shall send unto us. Thus ye see what we have to
mark. And on the other side, when we see that our Lord compels the
cormorants too vomit all that which they had swallowed down, making them to
yield an account, constreyning them too restore that which of taking away the
bouses that they builded not. True it is that God promised his people that they
should dwell in houses which they had not builded: but that was a special
promise of God when he did set his people in the land of Canaan. Again we
know how the holy Scripture says generally, that the man is happy which
eats the labor of his own hands, and

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may learn too
mislike them more and more, and too take such hearty remorse, that we
overcome all temptations, and hie us always to the heavenly glory where our
true heritage is, and that we may be so given unto it, as we may seek nothing
but to please our God and to frame our selves wholly to his will, so as we may
show by our deeds that his calling of us unto him is not in vain, but that
we be willing to glorify him in all our whole life, acknowledging the
benefits which he gives us of his mere grace, too the end we should yield
him praise and do him his due honor. That it may please him too grant this
grace, not only too us, but also too all people and nations of the earth. etc.

The.lxxvj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xx. Chapter.
20 He shall feel no suffizance in his belly, another shall he keep his
desire.

21 There is none of his meat left: Therefore shall not his goods be
multiplied.

22 When his abundance is at the full, he shall be in anguish, all the hands of
laboring men shall come unto him.

23 When he has vvherevvith to fill his belly, God shall send him the dread
of his wrath, and make it to rain upon his meat.

24 When he flees from the iron weapons, a bow of steel shall meet with
him.

25 The svvord shall be drawn out and shall cut him: it shall pass through
his gall, fearfulness shall be upon him.


ZOphar going forward with the matter that he dealt with yesterday, adds here,
that the wicked man never has any contentation nor rest, nor shall fare any
thing the better by aught that he leaves behind him, has laid it up in
store for those that fear him. Thus much concerning the first point that is
showed us here, namely that we must not deem men happy for the great
abundance of the goods that they possess: but according too their
contentation. For it is impossible that such as know not Gods grace, ne have
any care of it, should have contentation, because they know not what a
benefit they have, which is all one as if they had it not. Afterward it is
said, that there shall be no remaynder of their meat. This is a strange
thing, that that when the wicked man is in his chief wealth, he shall not
cease too be in anguish, and that the hands of all laborers shall come unto
him, or else that the hands of all men that are able to do any great act
shall come upon him. And so the sense may be dubble. The word that is placed
there, betokens a man that is foreward in executing of things. It may be
taken for a man that laboreth, traueleth, or works: and else if they knew
it, that they have not esteemed it as they ought. Then if God give us
wherewith, let us learn to content our selves, knowing that he sets his
goodness before our eyes, to the intent we should learn to settle our selves
upon it, and there rest. There is also one other point: namely, that although
we have want of worldly goods, and it is likely that many evils and miseries
shall come upon us: yet must we withstand such thoughtfull conceits. True it is
that we cannot be utterly careless, another must we: but yet must we moderate
that when the wicked shall have filled his belly, God will send him the
terroure of his wrath, and it shall rain upon his meat. This is a
confirmation of that which we have seen erewhiles. True it is that Zophar
passes further: for he had said, that the wicked shall live in anguish, and
that although they be thoroughly furnished and stored of all things, yet shall
they not cease too be incombered, because see what be fell too the people of
Israel. They were not contented with the heavenly Manna, it was to unsavory a
thing for them: but they had a longing to the meats which they had bin
accustomed to in Egypt. Well, God sent them their meat in such quantity, as
they did cast it up again. But what? while the meat was yet in their throtes
(as it is said in the Psalm) the wrath of God came upon them. Thus ye see
how God steals upon men unawares, even in the twinkling of an eye, upon the^
that think not themselves subject to him. So then if our that when the wicked
man flees from iron weapons, be shall meet with a bow of steel. Whereby he
signifies, that God has many ways too persecute and punish the wicked, so
as they shall not be able too escape his hand, what shifts or attemptes
soever they make. Truly the wicked will always be seeking how to shun
inconveniences, and to bring it about, they will be bold enough to despize all
things. And Zophar also have received us. But if we flee aloof from him, he
has too long hands, and when he has drawn his sword, he has a bow also,
that is to say, he has so many sorts of chastizings and punishmens, as in the
end we must needs fall unhappily, except we be reconciled unto him, as I
have showed already. Now like as God threatens swords, bows, wild beasts, and
Scorpions to such as lift up themselves against him, and stoutly harden
themselves against his hand: so also on the contrary part he shows, that
he has ways without number too save that the sword shall be drawn, and
pearce through his gall, and that fearfulness shall be upon him. When he
says that the sword shall be drawn, and pearce the wicked quite and clean
through his gall: it is as much to say, as it shall be a deadly stroke that
shall wound him to the heart: and this serves too do us too understand, that
Gods punishementes shall sometimes be suddayne. True it is that they are not
always so: and that fearfulness or terroure shall not go an inch from them.
Thus the wicked have a dubble mischief: which is, that the sword shall run
them through as soon as it is drawn out of the scabbard: and besides that,
God shall never suffer them to be at rest, but although the danger be past:
yet shall they tremble for fear still And whereat? Even at the shaking of a
leaf of a tree, (as it is said) and they shall think that death has already
caught them, when no man pursues the^. So we see whereat the holy Ghostamed.
First he intended to show us, that we must not envy the wicked when they be
so well guarded, as it may seem that no harm can come near the^. And why? For
god shall strike them through in the turning of a hand, yea even with a deadly
stroke, whereof they may never be healed. Mark that for one point. Another is
that when we see the wicked in fear: we must understand that there is but
only one mean to be in rest: which is to know that we be under Gods
protection. Therefore let that suffice us. For although it behoue us to walk
in fear before him: yet shall we always be sure of his goodness, whereas
the wicked and the despisers of his majesty shall always be so afraid as they
shall never have any rest. Therefore let us learn too retire to our God with
all lowliness, and too live with our neighbors without doing any man wrong,
least the same measure be moten to us again. And when we go so too work,
surely God will make us to feel his goodness, and deliver us from all the
dangers, terrors and dismayings that can happen to us.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him to make us feel them and be sorry for them, and too
consider better the judgments that he shows us, that we may daily more and
more be instructed to withdraw our selves from the transitory things of
this world, which are wont to blind men, as though all their felicity
consisted in them, and rather that we may atteine the wisdom and skill to
know that God draws us to him by the troubles that we see here bylow: and
that if it please him to exercise us with afflictions, we may think it is to
provoke us to seek him: and on the other side, that if he handle us ge^tly, it
is to the end that we feeling his fatherly love, should stick the faster to
him, and love and honor him with so much the earnester mind, still passing
here bylow, and inioying the benefits that he bestows upon us, until he
bring us to the true happiness which tarrieth for us in heaven That it may
please him to grant this grace, etc.

The.lxxvij. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the twentieth Chapter.
26 All darkness shall be laid up in his secret places: the fire that is not
blown shall consume him: and cursed shall be the residue of his house.

27 The Heavens shall bewray his iniquity: and the earth shall rise up against
him.

28 The blud shall go out of his house as flowing water, in the day of his
wrath.

29 This is the portion of the wicked man from God, This is the heritage which
he shall have of God for his words.


WE saw yesterday how the despisers of God are afraid without comfort. True
it is that the godly may be abashed and afraid, but God comfort them, and
when they run unto him they be sure that he will succoure them. As for the
wicked, that in all their privy and secret places, there shall be darkness
hidden or laid up. At the first sight there seems to be no great matter in
this saying. But when it is thoroughly understood, it will appear to be a
good confirmation of that which was said not long since. For here by the
Priuye places, are meant the backenookes, which the wicked have when God
persecuteth them, according as they have always some lurkingholes to hide
themselves in. We see how the wicked man will always have some blind
byway, he will play the fox, and dig himself a that even there be shall
find darkness. That is to say, although the wicked indeuer to shrink
themselves into shrowdes, yet notwithstanding when God pursues them, they
shall have such a terror within the^, as they shall quake although no man
follow them. To be by his prophet Sophonie: that is too wit, he enters with
his Lantern even into the deepest caves. For behold what he says of the
City of Jerusalem: I will visit thee with my Lantern (says he) thou have
hidden thy treasures in privy places, but thou shall win nothing by that, for
thou must needs be winnowed out. So then let us suffer God to inlighten us by
his word, and let us not seek lurkingholes. And when we be come before him
willingly after that sort, surely he will hyde us in his tent (as the Scripture
speaks,) and he will not only that the fire which is not blown shall
consume them. Here Zophar threatens the despizers of God and all the wicked,
that although there happen no harm unto them from any creature, yet they shall
not miss to be consumed by Gods wrath. There needs (says he) no artificial
fire: for the wrath of God will be enough to destroy all them that will not
willingly submit themselves to him. This similitude is common enough through all the holy Scripture: namely that God that all the residue of his house shall go
too havoc, or that there shall be nothing but misfortune upon the rest of his
house. Like as our Lord utters his goodness toward those that are his;
by blissing both their household and their children, and all that belongs too
them: So on the contrary part, he shows how dreadful his wrath is, by
spreading it self out upon all that is about the ungodly, according as we
see how the world is generally defiled with us. For what is the cause that
there is neither heaven nor earth, no nor any corner in the world, where Gods
wrath and curse is not seen upon all creatures? Is it not our sinfulness?
We know it is said, that there is not one man upon earth that does good, but
all of us are comprised in the general condemnation of sin, which is
universally in us all. Now forasmuch as god of his own nature hates sin: we
must needs be odious unto him. So then seeing that that the heavens shall
bewray his iniquity, and the earth rize up against him. He had said
heretofore, that fire should consume the wicked without blowing: that is to
say, that God without using the service of his creatures, is able to destroy
all them th at lift up themselves against him And here he tells us of another
kind of punishment: which is, that God will arm his creatures too execute
his vengeance against the wicked. Ye see then how God works in diverse
sorts, when he minds to punish the despyzers of his Majesty. Sometimes
(as I have said) too remembrance any more. Again, have we showed both too
heaven and earth, that our only desire is that God should pity us, because
he might with good right condemn us? Behold, the heavens shall be as a
mantle to us, and the earth shall likewise cover us, so as our iniquities
shall be buried. But I say we must confess our iniquities unto heaven:
that is too say, before God. And we must also confess them in the earth, when
we shall have cast stumblingblockes into the Church, and have lived amiss.
For we must not be ashamed too yield our that the bud of his house shall go
away like flowing water in the day of Gods wrath. Now when mention is made
here of the budde of the house of wicked men, it is too express, that all the
hope which they have for the time too come shall beguile them. For when the
wicked are cropped by Gods hand: they hope still too bud again, Such is the
portion of the wicked, yea at Gods hand, and at Gods hand also his heritage is
like because of his words. As touching this conclusion, it is as it were a
sealing of that which we have heard here before, to the intent it might be of
the more authority in our hearts, and that we might be fully assured of it,
and receive it without any doubting. Mark then the portion of the wicked. And
at whose hand? At Gods. As if he had said, True it is that the wicked rufsle
it out in this world, and play the looce Colts: for they believe not that
there is a judge in heaven, neither think they upon him. But yet for all that,
they cannot pluck that pre-eminence from his majesty, and he prepares their
indytement. This then serves expressly too daunt the wicked, which put God
out of their mind as much as they can. Also is it a good lesson for all the
faithful, to teach them to say, Go to, we may do much evil that shall be
pardoned at men's hands, yea and they shall never say so much as black is our
eye for it. But in the end we must come before the judge, and when we come
thither, this forbearing at men's hands will turn too our double condemnation.
That is the counsel which we have too gather of this text, when the name of
God is expressed here two times. For men oftentimes discharge not their duty,
specially those I meene that are in office to do it. We never pass of
admonishing such as do amiss, nor of correcting them, but we wink at them.
Yea and the Magistrate which ought that such is the portion of the wicked,
yea even at Gods-ba^de. For it serves to wipe away all these vain hopes
which portion and heritage, that also serves to do us too understand, that
we must be fully resolved of this point, that God will not leave the wicked
unpunished. And like as every man calls that thing his portion, which is
ordained their words. How so? True it is that some men restreyne this to the
blasphemies that the wicked belke out against God: but the word that is set
down here sounds none evil. So then it must be taken more simply: that is
to wit, that without pronouncing it new again, for we have enough in the
holy Scripture, wherein he shows himself to be judge of the whole world.
Thus ye see what we have to mark in this text: that is too wit, that if we
confess our faults before God, we shall be forgiven at his hand: But if we
stand pleading with him, or if we seek lurkingholes to hyde our iniquities:
we shall not only be convinced by his word, but also he will lay so rough
hand upon us, as we shall be overwhelmed under him, yea even without any
remedy: and then will it be

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him too make us so to feel them, as it may lead us too
true repentance: and that in steed of hardening of our selves, we may be so
hartbroken, yea even before he make us feel the soreness of his wrath, as
every one of us maybe his own judge: to the end, that when we shall appear
before the judgment seat of our Lord Jesus Christ, all our sins may
there be covered and buried by his righteousness. And so let us all say.
Almighty God our heavenly father, etc.

The.lxxvij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxj. Chapter.
ANd Job ansvvered and said,

2 Hear my words and let it be for your comfortes.

3 Bear with me and I will speak: and when I have spoken, mock you on.

4 Is my talking unto man? If it were so, how should not my spirit faint?

5 Mark me and be abashed, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

6 Verily when I bethink me, I am afraid, and fear takes hold on my flesh.


IT seems after a sort, that the words which Job sets down here, are
contrary to the word of God, inasmuche as he avouches that God punishes
notthe wicked, but lets them alone so as they prosper. But we have seen
heretofore Hearken to me (says he) and take beede too my words, and let it
be too you for a comfort: that is too say, let it be in steed of the
comfort that you come too give me. Truly we know that Jobs friends came
too that end: howebeit they were sore combered when they saw him in that
plight: and according to man's reason they concluded that Job was a castaway.
See how they were dazeled with this general sentence that God punishes the
wicked. And so they set Job in the rank of the wickeddest sort, which thing
they ought not too do. Now therefore he tells them, that whereas they be
come too comfort him, he desires nothing of them but patience and quiet
hearing. And afterward he protests again, that he shapeth not his talk
unto men, as these hypocrites do, who seek no more but to be justified before
the world, always shunning the presence of God, and never come to acknowledge
[what they bee] but by force, and till men have thoroughly tried what is in
them. Job then says, that his talking is not unto men, that is to say, he is
not led with vain ambition, to make fair might my spirit hold out if I had
respect unto men? Ye see me here in such necessity, as no creature were
able to endure in so miserable state. By all likelihoode I could have been
dispatched a hundred times ere this: but since you see neuerthelater, that my
spirit fails me not: is it not a sign that I know the hand of God, and
that I submit my self too it, and that I rest upon him? Seeing I am not here
as a wavering Reed, can ye not perceive I cannot but be sore abashed, and I
am greatly dismayde at the things which I see. For surely Job was a spectacle
of all terriblenesse: and when we read what happened unto him, the hears
ought to stand up upon our head. His saying then is that he cannot think
upon himself, nor remember the great miseries that were befalne him: but then
will you be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. That is too say,
you will blame me no more as ye have done hithertoo. For ye imagine of me
at your pleasure, and it is a sign that ye have no pity nor compassion of
the great misery that is in my person. And here you have too mark, first if
we will comfort the miserable in their adversity, it behooves us too consider
well how. For there is required a singular discretion in that behalf as is
that? True it is that when we once know the evil, I say when we know it, not
after our own imagination, but as it is of very truth: we may be bold too
condemn it, and we shall not be rash in so doing. Why? For we judge not at
all: but only ratify the judgment that God has given by his word. But when
we be so hasty [as is spoken of before:] it is high treason to God, because
we rob him of the right that is peculiar too himself, and pull it to our own
persons. And again besides this, we offend God in taking upon us to judge of
secret My talking (says he) is not unto men, for were it so, how should my
spirit not fail? Here Job shows all the children of God how they ought to
speak. He had protested the like already heretofore. How beit it is not
without cause that he repeateth it again, forasmuch as it is certain that
while we wander here bylowe, our talk will always trayle a long train of
superfluities after it, and we shall not go to the matter roundly and
substancially as we ought too do. What is the cause that we are wont to
snarle our words in such wise, as a man cannot wring out any pure truth out of
us? It is because we have our eye upon men. For besides that, men do bleare
themselves, and discern not things as they ought to do: we on our side are
already enclyned to follow it, and the devil also thrusts himself in, too
make a hotchopotche of all things. So then our words shall never be well
conveyed and clear, except we have God before our eyes, and speak as in his
prefence. On the other side, we are never thoroughly touched, when we talk
but with men. For they judge no further than they see, and we pass for no
more but to hide our vices, and we think it enough if the evil be not
apparent. Lo how men fall asleep in their sins, and never speak freely as
they ought to do, unless they know that God summoneth them before him, and
frames their inditements, and that they must prevent it, and not tarry till
God condemn them, but rather yield themselves guilty of their own accord.
This is the cause why Job protests here that his talking is not unto men.
True it is that we ought to have regard of our neighbors when we talk with
them, that our words may edify them. For if we cast forth light and wandering
speeches: we shall lay stumbling blocks in their way, and we may hurt them
diverse ways. Therefore when we speak to men, we must bethink our selves
before hand: that is to say, we must have regard that it might be to their
profit. But yet must we have the thing that is spoken here of Job: which is,
to put God before. Job then meeneth not singly that he despyzeth men, and that
if he see them rude and ignorant he will not in any wise apply himself unto
them: no: but that he is not led with such vanity as too please men only, and
to forget God, or too put him behind them: but rather that when he speaks,
he makes his reckening aforehande, that he is as it were in the presence of
God, so as all his thoughts are known too that heavenly judge, and therefore
he must not disguise himself, nor think too further his case by concealing
the truth. Lo whereat Job looked. And so (as I have touched alredie) let us
have the wit to pray God to call us thoroughly home to himself: that is to say,
that as often as he viseteth us with his hands, he will so touch our minds and
hearts too the quick, as we may know that it is he which punishes us for
our faults, and that all our thoughts are bare before him, and not be
dazeled and sotted in our own talk, as they that are so full of babbling,
only to please men. Behold (I say) whereof we be instructed in this
sentence. And it behooves us to remember well the reason that Job adds. If it
be so (says he) how and wherefore does not my spirit faint? It seems that
he leaves his talk here as it were cut off. But the sense is that such as
do so direct their talk to men without regard of God, shall quayle in the
end, and that when they have made fair countenaunces at the first sight,
their hypocrisy will bewray it self at the last. And in good footh we see it
so by experience. For they that are so led with vainglorie, and are always
desirous to be had in reputation among men as the only respect that they have:
will surely tell many fair tales, and when he is called, and yet
notwithstanding must needs wake if he be iogged, or pulled hard by the arm:
even so deals our Lord with us. For inasmuch as we be not moved with the
common corrections that he sends us, but are dull and retchelesse: he shows
us great and excessive punishments, such as we have not heard off before, as
if he meant too waken us perforce. Wherefore let us bethink us too profit
our selves by Gods judgments: not simply to be stricken in fear by them,
nor too be so afflighted as we should shun him: but stopping their
mouths: it is a manner of speech that is very ryfe among the Hebrews: as
when it is said that the Prophet and the wise man will lay their hand upon
their mouth: it is to do us too wit, that things shall be so confuzed as the
skilfullest and best practiced men that are, shall not know what to say, but
shall be utterly past their wits. And so says Job now, that such as are
so abashed must lay their hand upon their mouth to keep silence. And why?
For the judgment that God executed upon the person of Job, was terrible and
dreadful to man's understanding, and if a man should judge of it after the
flesh, he could not be but amazed at the sight of Jobs person. But now
let us gather the common doctrine of this: which is, that when God works
after such a manner as we are not acquainted with, we have too glorify him:
for when he shows us the reason of his works, and will have them known to
us, then he puts words into our mouth that we may be able to speak of
them. Again, when we see that Gods works outpasse our understanding, so as
we know not why he disposes the things so which we see: what is to be done?
We must lay our hand upon our mouth, that is to say, we must not be so bold
as to prattle of them. Wherefore let us learn to know our own ability, that
we fling not our selves astray over all the feeldes: but rather follow always
the right way. For the doing hereof, we need to know no more but what is
given us: according also as Saint Paul brings us to the same rule namely, to
know no more. than God leads us unto. So long as he reaches us his hand,
let us go boldly: but when he leads us no further, we must stop there, and
be as dumb. True it is that we must always have our mouth open after one sort:
that is, to glorify God. But when we presume to bring him under the compass
of our understanding, and would have him too reserve nothing too himself:
whither go we then? Is ^it not an open despyting of God? He intends too
hyde the thing from us. And why? Too the intent we should know our own
ignorance, and yet not cease to acknowledge him to be rightuous, and too
honor his wonderful and incomprehensible ordinance. So then (as I have
touched already) whenever God shows us the reason of his works, let us
thank his goodness, and say, Lord thou come down very low to us
wretched creatures, when thou vouchsauest to show us why thou do this or
that: and thy goodness deserves well to be magnified by us, when thou
communicatest it so familiarly too such as are not worth it. But if God hyde
the reason of his works from us, and that it be to high for us to reach
unto; Let us shet our mouth, that is to say, let us not be talkatiue to babble
after our own fancy: but let us glorify God and not be ashamed to be
ignorant. For the very wisdom of the faithful is too know no more than it
has pleased God to show them. Therefore let us make silence unto God after
what sort soever he work, till the last day of discovery be come, when we
shall see him face to face in his glory and majesty.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good god with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to make us feel them better, so as we being cast down
in our selves, may not seek to be set up by any but by him, and that we may be
taught to pity our neighbors, and to reach them our hand, and not to be
cruel judges when we see other men in adversity, but that every one of us may
bethink himself, to the end that when we our selves be in perplexity, and
our God afflicts us, we may assure our selves that he will pity us, as no
doubt but he will show himself a pitiful father toward us, if we return
unto him with true humility and obedience, and grauntvs the grace to hold our
selves contented with that which he makes us privy unto as now, till he
have gathered us to himself too be made like unto him in glory. That it may
please him to grant this grace, etc.

The.lxxix. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxj. Chapter.
7 Why do the wicked live and grow old and vvelter in riches?

8 Their seed is mainteyned before their eyes with them, and their
generations is in their presence.

9 Their house is quiet without fear, the scourge of God is not upon them.

10 Their Bull comes to gendering, and his seed misseth not: their Covve
calueth, and is not barrein.

11 They send forth their little ones like sheep, and their children dance.

12 They play upon the Taber and the Harp: and make merry with the sound of
the Organs.


WE saw yesterday for what intent Job did set down a saying which at the first
sight might have seemed evil: which was, that God leaves the wicked
unpunished. For that seems not too be agreeable too his office: but rather
that in as much as he is VVheefore (says he) do the wicked live? wherefore
become they old? wherefore increase they in riches? As if he should say, Among al
their desires men think the cheef and happiest to be in health, and secondly to
have long life, good or evil that every man should receive should be Gods
well or ill dealing with him in this life. But too resist such imaginations,
and too repress so pernicious an error, our Lord of set purpose does not
always punish the wicked, to the intent we should know how there is another
principal judgment which is not yet seen. Again, God does not always show
signs of the love that he bears to his children. For he leaves them up as
it were to the spoil and to the wide world, so as they be martired and
assailed, and yet have no succoure at his run abroad unbridled, ouerflowing
all things as a waterflud, and we perceive not that God is minded to withstand
it, but rather seems too let all things go too havoc, so as good men are
borne down, and God makes no countenance to succor them although they sigh
and groan to him: I say when we see all this: it behooves us to have a higher
reach than our own motherwit, and to be fully resolved that God will yet still
assist us. And also forasmuch as we see he suffers not the world to be
utterly overwhelmed but holds it still by a secret bridle, Being, so as we
can say that God has all majesty in himself: and yet in the mean while rob
him of that which is peculiar to him, and cannot be separated from him: we make
him but an Idol and a dead thing. As in good sooth, if he govern not all
creatures, if all things be not under his dominion, if all things be not
ordered by his power and wisdom: I pray you is it not a rending of him in
pieces? Is it not a defacing of his majesty? Yes surely. So then we must be
always fully resolved of this point, that God governs, and that al things
are directed by his guiding and providence. And we must add yet further, that
he is rightuous, so as he governs not after a disordered fashion, nor
unadvisedly, neither is his reigning all only to show an absolute power as
tirants do, who to get themselves estimation take liberty to do wrongfully and
crookedly whatsoever they themselves list. But Gods power is such, as is
rightly ruled by his righteousness. And have we once these two points: we
must thence forth be stablished in the hope of the resurrection by the troubles
that are in this world. How? We see how the wicked do live and grow old,
we see they lead their days in mirth, and make great good cheer, we see
that all things happen as they would wish, both in their children and their
cattle, and in their household, so as it should seem that God dandleth them
in his arms: and therefore we must conclude that there i^ another judgment:
and so let us cheer up our selves with the hope of the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ. We see that good men are vexed and troubled here: and yet are
they the heirs of the world. And where is the inheriting of it? Sometimes
they have not a bit of bread to eat: they be lurched: they call upon God, and
are not delivered. Therefore we must think that God holds back the showing
of his love that he* bears toward those that are his, and that he will not
as yet in all points perform the grace that he has promised the^: to the end
that by means thereof they might be moved too seek the heavenly inheritance
that is promised them, always laboring and traueling thitherward. So the^,
whereas of our own nature we be inclined to stumbling, and to starting out of
the way, when we see things misordered: let the That they run after the sound
of the Taber and Flute, and dance at the sound of the Organs, and lead their
days in mirth and glad^^sse, and go down into the grave in the twinkling of
an eye. Here Job meeneth to express somewhat more than he had done before, in
saying that the wicked live and grow old, and all things fall out as they
would wish: namely, that they also for their part do take the benefit of the
time, and as it were besotte themselves with the good things that God sends
them. They be two diverse things to have health, o^sping, cattle, great
possessions, riches, and honor: and to take such pleasure in them as to set
ones whole felicity in them* Why so? Abraham was rich, healthie, and strong
of body, as Jacob reports well of it, in that he says that his own days
were unhappy in comparison of the days of his fathers. Ye see then that
Abraham was strong and in good lyking, and also it was promised him that he
should die in a good and lusty old age, when he was satisfied with living here
bylow. He was rich: for although he had no inheritance nor possessions: yet
had he both a great household, and much cattle as the scripture shows. But
was he in the mean while besotted in them? was he bleared with his riches? No:
but he was as a wayfarer in this world he knew that God called him to a further
thing, he grounded not himself upon his own strength, he was not like those
that royst it out and play the looce colts while God gives them lustiness and
health of body: but he was always as a man well tamed before God, ceassing
not too humble himself, so as his example may do us very good service. But
when the worldlings and such as look no further than the earth, have riches
and bodily health, they become so drunken with it, as they forget themselves
and regard God no more. And like as we see that at one table a stayed man will
well and soberly take his repaste of that which is there, without misbehauing
of himself: and another will glut himself til he burst, specially if there be
store of wine: and as we see some labor nothing so much as to play the very
beasts, and it seems to themselves that their throat is not wide enough to
gulze in wine, but they streyne themselves as it were upon the rack, to fill
their paunches the better: even so some men may have great prosperity and yet
will not burst out to excess, but will always hold themselves in fear and
awe. But the wicked (as Job says here) will abuse Gods benefits and gifts, and
when he does as it were lay the bridle in their necks: then they fling over
all the feeld, and think not that there is any more subjection for them:
insomuch as they friske about at the sound of the Taber and the Flute, and
there is none other talk with them but of dancing and making good cheer,
whereat they play the brute beasts altogether. This was it that Job me^t to
utter in this se^te^ce. And whereas he makes us a description of the despyzers
of God, showing us them as in a picture: it is to the end we should learn too
retire out of such brutishness. And therefore when God gives us abundance of
wealth, let us learn not to sotte our selves in it, but to walk continually in
fear, holding our selves in awe, and being watchful. For (as S. Paul
says) we be not the children of darkness. God has inlightnened us with
his word, and he will have us to walk as at high none day. Thus ye see what we
have to mark in this streyne. Again when God sends that the wicked run
after the sound of the Taber and the Flute. Nevertheless we see it is no
novelty in the children of this world to exceed measure in the vanities which
god condemns, as in dancing and

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him too make us so to feel them, as we may be heartily
sorry for them, and in returning unto him, desire him to mortify our whole
nature, ruling all our thoughts and affections by his righteousness, and
making us new creatures, to the end we may so pass through this world, as we
may not be hindered by any stumbling blocks and bylettes that are in it, nor
cumbered and thrust out of the way by the miseries that we have to endure
here, nor by the adversities that God sends, nor tempted by the prosperity
of the wicked: but that we may fight stoutly against all temptations, even
till he gather us intoo his heavenly rest, and make us enjoy the inheritance
that he has promised us, whereof we be yet destitute for a time, that our
faith and hope might be exercised. That it may please him to grant this grace
not only to us, but also to all people, etc.

The.lxxx. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxj. Chapter.
This sermon conteyneth the rest of the declaration of the xij. verse, and so
forth of the text that here follows.

13 They spend their days in wealth, and suddenly they go down to the grave.

14 And yet they say unto God, depart from us: for we desire not to know thy
vvayes.

15 Who is the almighty, that we should serve him? or what shall it profit
us to pray unto him?


IT was yesterday declared, that Job here speaks of those that abuse the
benefits which God bestows upon them during this mortal life, so as they be
carried away with pleasure, and are as it were drunken therewith. And hereby we
ought more be subject unto him. So then let us follow this modesty or mean
that I have spoken of, and learn so too moderate all our pleasures, that we
be not carried away with the world. And there with all also, because here is
mention made of the flute, of the taboret, harp, and other instruments of
music: let us note, that the things which of their own nature be good, ought
not by us to be put to an evil use. As music of it self cannot be
condemned: but forasmuch as the world does almost always abuse it, we ought to
be so much the more circumspect, and to go to their grave in a minute of an
hour, after that they have spent their whole life in great joy and pleasure.
This thing also is depart from us: for we desire not too know thy ways.
Truth it is that the wicked will not spew out such blasphemy as to renounce
God: but in effect they do well declare how they pass little of him, and
desire nothing else but to be rid from his subjection: and although they cannot
bring that to pass, yet they labor too go as far from him as they can: this
we see. And for proof thereof, when men live without remorse of conscience,
and willingly and wittingly become brute beasts, so as they make no difference
between good and evil, but think that all things are lawful: is it not as
much as to say unto God, depart from us? For if God be near us, we must
have him before our eyes as our judge, another must we think or say any thing
but as if it were in his presence, another must we accept any thing but as
though we would be judged of him. Then as for all such as would have liberty
too live as they list: It is all one as if they would drive God far off
from them, and have none acquaintance with him. And verily the next words,
(namely we will none of thy ways) declare the thing which we have here to
understand. For to be near unto God, or to go far from him, is not referred
too the majesty of God: For his divine being shows not it self, it is not
visible unto creatures. True it is that we may well have some understanding of
it, and we may know that his being is infinite, and spreads out every
where: but yet notwithstanding the chief knowledge that we have of God, is by
his virtues, where through he communicates himself unto us, and cheefely in
that he tells us his will, and teaches us what manner of one he is, and
shows us how we ought to walk, and how our life ought to be ruled. Behold,
we be then near unto him, when we suffer our selves to be taught by his word,
acknowledging that it is he which speaks and shows himself familiarly
unto us, to the end we should come unto him, and there rest our selves:
Furthermore when men will not yield themselves teachable, but refuze all
instruction, and desire to be stark doltes, so as if a man bring them any good
doctrine they make no accounte of it: then in stead of drawing near unto
God, men withdraw themselves from him. And therefore I said, that Job
declares here the thing which he had intended before: that is to wit, that
in as much as the wicked and the despyzers of God, are loath to submit
themselves to Gods ways: they withdraw themselves from him as much as they
can. Therefore we will none of his ways (say they) that is to say, get thee
away from us. And this is a text whereof we may gather a good and profitable
lesson. For first of all it is seek nothing else but to be present with our
god, always to behold him, and to walk as they that know very well that we
must make an account of our whole life before him, and that we can not escape
his hands. And moreover let us long for the presence of God. For it is not
enough that we have our eyes upon God: but we must desire to be always in his
sight, and under his guiding, for sometime the most wicked will have an eye
unto God, but it shall be as the galey slaves do, who fall to rowing when they
see themselves fast chayned and surely beaten: then they what is the
almighty that we should serve him, and what profit shall we get by praying
unto him? Here Job sets out the pride that is in all the faithless and
wicked men. And it is a place worthy to be noted: for the holy scripture
shows, that the principal vice that who is the Almighty that we should
serve him? Truth it is they will not utter such words with their mouth, except
God discover them: as sometimes it happens that the hypocrites spew out
horrible things. And then who is the cause thereof? it is God that constrains
them. For they would gladly hide themselves, to the end that their filthiness
might not be known in the world: but God will not suffer it, according to
that which is said, that they, who when they know God, did not glorify him as
God, are delivered unto a reprobate mind, so as they are given too all
wickedness, and get themselves an evil name through their own folly. God
then will sometime suffer the wicked to speak as is here said of them: but
although they hold their peace, and make goodly protestations that they will
serve God: yet in their heart they bear such spite against God, that they wish
he had none authority over them, saying in themselves, what is the Almighty
that we should serve him? As for example, the worste men that can be chosen,
will say at the first, that there is one God, and that it is mere he should
be honored of us. Yea in general terms they will in deed confess so much:
but when they come to the clozing (as they say) and that a man goes about to
rule them, and says unto them: what has not God declared his will unto us, in
what sort he will have us to walk* then you shall see they will not hear on
that side. If a man would pull a covetous person from his covetousness, or
reprove an ambitious man of his vice, or a whoremonger, drunkard, or
blasphemer of their faults: by and by they kycke against God: for they would
feign have full liberty to do evil. And although they do not utter these
words with their mouth: what is the Almighty? yet do they swell like toades,
and will not yield themselves to be subject unto God. Here then we see that
Job accuses not only them which with open mouth have uttered this blasphemy
whereof he speaks: but also all those that are so swollen in themselves (as
they say) and are filled with such arrogancy, that they will not humbly submit
themselves to God, nor acknowledge it meet that he should have soueraintie
over them. To be short* if we will not be condemned with these men: we must
compare God with our selves: that is, forasmuch as he is our creator, we
must acknowledge, that he ought to have the whole dominion, and all things
ought to be subject unto him. And thus much more for an Item: that seeing he
has redeemed us by the death and passion of his only begotten Son, he
has well deserved too have all souerayntie over us. And now that he has
purchased us so dearly, we must no more be addicted to our selves, but be
wholly dedicated to his service. Furthermore for as much as you are ashamed
when you think upon your life that is passed: now you know that the Devil had
rule over you, and that it was too your ruin and destruction. You are ashamed
in your selves, when you call too remembrance that you were so forsaken of God,
and wandered like brute beasts. Such is the state and condition of all those
that exempt themselves from the service of God. On the contrary part, when we
serve our God, it is certain that that service is more honorable tha^ to enjoy
a kingdom, as here before has been declared. God does not call us

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them better than we have
heretofore done, to the end we may be sorry for them, and therewithal
seek the remedy in him so that being purged and clenzed from our sins, we
may seek nothing else but to cleave unto his righteousness: And that we may
so do, let us always look unto him, knowing well that he has placed us in
this world to the end that we should always go forward unto him, yea in such
sort as we doubt not but that he has a fatherly care over us. And in the
mean season let us desire to be instructed by his word, and that he would
always lighten us, not only in our outward works, but also in all our
thoughts and affections, so that with heart and mind we may be wholly given to
him, to the end that his holy name may be glorified in our whole life. That
it may please him to grant this grace not only to us, but also to all people
and Nations, etc.

The.lxxxj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxj. Chapter.
16 Their prosperity is not in their own hand: let the intent of the
wicked be far from me.

17 How is the candle of the wicked put out? and their destruction comes
upon them, and God deuideth their lines in his wrath.

18 So that they be as chafe before the vvinde, and as the stubble in the
vvhirlevvinde.

19 The Lord hides his strength for his Sons, and pays him, and he shall
see it.

20 His eyes shall see his destruction, he drinks of the fury of the
Almighty.

21 And what pleasure leaves he in his house? he sees his days shortened.


WE have before showed what the Their prosperity (says he) is not in their
own hand. As if he should say, you reason that God deals with every man
according to their deserts: but now we see the clean contrary, so that I
think the wicked shall not escape one whit the better cheap. And why? For they
be not Lords of their own state (as they say) but God holds them in a
bridle, and he can deprive them of all their pleasures, and of the things
which they think to make to a full and perfect felicity: yea they are so
blinded in themselves, and so puffed up with pride, as they think themselves
half Angels, and to be brief, do reckon themselves to be out of all danger
Well, their prosperity is not in their own hand: that is to say, they
deceive themselves with a vain imagination, and they do but dream, when they
say their life is so happy. Therefore their intent is far from me: that is
to say, I will not be blinded with this present felicity that me^ do see in
the wicked, as they that are made drunken with it. We see then what Job meant
to declare by these words: And therefore that we may the better profit in
this doctrine, let us note, that when we see the wicked prevail, God holds
a secret the prosperity of the wicked is not in their own hand: that is to
say, that men may be in prosperity, but their life hangs let the intent of
the wicked be far from us: let us learn, that we must not be as it were in
the dark too fall a sleep in things present, and to stand to much in our
own conceyte for our wealth and abundance, nor be angry with God if he
handle us not after our own mind. We must not then become such: for what is
the intent of the wicked? it is that when God sends them the thing that they
desire, they are so puffed up with pride, as a man can no longer bear them,
they will not acknowledge themselves any more to be mortal men, but they
exalte themselves above their degree, and ascend so high, that in the end
they must needs fall and break their neck: a man shall find nothing in
them but arrogancy and spiritual drunkenness, where with they become so
beastly, that if at any time a man speak unto them of death, of sickness, or
of poverty, they think that it can not come near them, and that a man does
them great injury to say so unto them. If any man will go about to humble
them, and say unto them: let us know how weak and frail our state and
condition is: they will answer, yea but am I as other men are? am I to be
counted in the number of them that are so dealt withal? Thus the wicked become
so proud in their prosperity, that there is no dealing with them. To be
short, they forget that they be men and creatures, and persuade themselves
that they are no more subject to the corrections that God lays upon us in
this world. Furthermore, if they be afflicted: then they rage, they gnashe the
teethe and bite the nail against God, and a man shall see them foam at the
mouth in their rage. And why? by cause they have not yet learned to submit
themselves under the hand of God, and to offer themselves unto him for a
sacrifice, to the end they may be dedicated unto him, to be dealte withal as
it shall please him: they know nothing at all what all this means. So then
when God deals with us favorably, we must bridle our selves, knowing that
he declares unto us his fatherly love, to the end he might draw us unto him,
and that we should come unto him with true humility as it becomes us,
saying: well Lord seeing thou show thy self so favorable, it is very
meet that I should cleave unto thee. And how? It is not in placing felicity
here: but contrariwise when thou shalt afflicte me, I shall say, well Lord
thou do waken me, least I should stay my self and become careless here
beneath, putting my trust and confidence in this world, and in earthly things:
thou will humble me and tame me, to the end I should so much the more
courageously look unto thee, that I might atteyne unto thy heavenly kingdom.
Thus must we have our intentes severed from the wicked, that is to say, our
minds may not be here so enta^gled with worldly things, that they should make
us to become brute beasts, and so drunken that we should no more think upon
God: but contrariwise we must contemn and despize all those things wherein
the wicked are wont to delight, knowing that although we be poor and
miserable, yet our state is not the worse for that, because we have good hope
that God will have pity and compassion on us. This is the su^me of that which
we have to note out of this place. Now Job adds: How is the Lamp of the
wicked quenchea? How is their destruction come upon them? and how has God
settled their lives? or their sorrows? This is a confirmation of that which
has been already heard. By this word Lamp Job sets out their
prosperity: according as the holy Scripture uses that manner of speech, namely
of co^paring How (says he) is the lamp of the wicked quenched, and their
destruction come upon them? when he says, that their destruction comes
upon them, he shows, that when God entreats the wicked gentlye for a time,
we must not fasten our eyes upon the earth, for when we reason whether God be
judge, and whether the wicked shall be punished in the end: we must not
consider what may happen on this behalf or on that. No: for whereas they be
drunken in their wealth, whereas they be lifted up in their pride, and whereas
they think that no God (...) out their cords in his wrath. True it is (...)
Cords, is by some expounded Sorrows: as also it may be taken: but the
natural sense is, that God of his wrath will set out the portions. For this
word cords in the Sriptures is taken for portion, because that in old time
when men would lay out ground by the aker, that is to say, measure ground,
they used lines. And the holy Scripture applies this similitude to this order
of Gods providence, that even as land is measured to set out the meeres and
bounds, and to divide the possessions, to the end that every man may have his
right, that things may not be co^fused: so God by his providence does bring
into order that which is confused. It is as much then as if he did stretch out
the line. Now it is said, that God will stretch them out: yea, but it shall be
in his wrath. And why? It is to teach us, that we should not be to much amazed
when things come not well to pass at the first. As for example, if all things
shall seem unto us to be turned vpside down in this world, and that there be
no more bridles nor cords, but that the wicked take their pleasure, that they
cast themselves overthwart the fields, that good men are trode^ under foot,
that they are assaulted with great cruelty and extortion, that no remedy
appears, but the evil waxes worse and worse, that God makes as though he
turned his back, that there is no more any justice in the world, that the
mightiest carries the bell away: and to be short, that we are here as it were
in the midst of great storms, that all things in the world are turned vpside
down: yet must we not be swallowed up with desperation. And why? Let us tarry
till God spread out the cords in his wrath: for although to day he hide these
cords, and does not set out the bounds, insomuch that things be not brought
into good order: yet has he always the cords in his hand, and will well
declare that he knows how to spread them out and to make the partition. And
why does he it not at the first? because it is not yet due time. It is true
that he never ceasseth to be the judge of the wicked: but he will not at the
first show his vengeance upon them, he will not so soon put in execution
that which he has decreed in himself, and also it is not expedient for us.
Furthermore it behooves that the wicked be made more inexcusable: which thing
is brought to pass when God calls them to repentance (as says S. Paul) by
bearing with them. For so much the more are they too be blamed before him, in
that they have so abused his goodness and patience. Besides this, when the
good men are tormented; they have wherewith to humble themselves: it is meet
that by this means their faith should be exercised, to the end that they
might pacientlie wait for help from God, knowing that their salvation is hid,
for as much as it lies in hope: and that hereby God stirs them up to come
unto him, to the end they should seek their inheritance without this world.
See then how our Lord (not without cause) deferreth his judgments: for the
time is not always convenient to execute his wrath, as he knows it better
than we. This is the sum of that which we have to learn out of this verse.
Now it is said moreover: that then they shall be as stubble before the wind.
Whereby Job meeneth, that there is no root in all the felicity wherein the
wicked do glory, and are so proud. This similitude is much used, so that it
needs not to be expounded: for it is a thing very well known unto us also,
how the stubble is carried away with the wind and tempest. So then Job
protests here that the felicity of the wicked is not so rooted, but when
the whirlewinde of Gods wrath comes upon it, it shall vanish and melt away
quite and clean, so as there shall be nothing left, and therewithal let us
note, that he shows how the wrath of God shall come in a minute of an hour,
when as they shall not think of it: as it is said, that the wicked shall be
taken suddenly, and when they even unto their children: and that the wicked
shall in their life time know that there is nothing but vanity in their state,
yea and (will they nill they) perceive that they stand upon an unsure
ground, before that God have cast them down. It is true that they cease not
from their pride for all that: but how so ever it be, God urges them so
far, that they perceive they can not always continue so. This is the sum
of that which Job meant to entreat of here. will address himself to their
children, that is to say, he will reserve punishment for them. And this is to
prosecute this matter, that we must not give judgment upon the providence of
God, by that which may be seen in this world, but must quiet our mynds and
stay our judgment until God show that his time is come. It becomes not us
then to appoint the times. Men are froward when they make such haste. But you
see that God has a peculiar fashion in his doings, which is sometimes
strange unto us, but yet must we humble our minds and hide or reserve, when it
is said, that God reserueth for the children of the wicked the punishment that
he has executed upon their fathers. True it is that this can not enter intoo
all men's heads, neither is it a common doctrine. And this is the cause
wherefore I said that we must hereunto apply our whole study: for men of
their own nature are so hasty and impacient, that they would have God too
set be good for us, but also by his word, that in the midst of the darkness
of all the afflictions which we have to suffer, we may not cease still to feel
his goodness and favor, and so to follow the way that he shows us, as we may
never be turned therefrom for any thing that happens unto us. And in the
mean season also that our eyes be not blinded neither with prosperity, nor
with adversity, nor with any thing what soever it be: but that we may behold
this glass which he has given us, that is to say, his holy word, and that
by the same we may be always guided unto him to be transformed into his
image, until such time as he have cleansed us from all our sins, and have
utterly abolished in us all that comes of our corrupt and sinful flesh, to
gather us fully to himself, that we may be partakers of his glory which he
has prepared for us in heaven. That it may please him, etc.

The.lxxxij. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xxj. Chapter.
22 Who is he that vvil take upon him to teach God knowledge, who judges
the highest things*

23 This man dies in his full strength, at his ease, and quietly.

24 His breasts or teates are full of milk, and his bones flow with Maree.

25 And another dies with great pain, and never eats with pleasure.

26 They are laid both in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

27 I am not ignorant of these things, and how you go about to do me vvrong.

28 For you say, where is the house of the Prince, and where is also the Tent
of the wicked?

29 Ask them that go by the way, for ye can not deny their signs.

30 The wicked is kept unto the day of destruction, they shall be brought
forth to the day of wrath

31 Who shall shevve him his way too his face, and who shall tell him again
of that which he has done?

32 He shall be brought to the grave, he shall be laid into the tomb.

33 The grauelly earth shall be svveete unto him, and every man shall go after
him, and the number of them that went before him, is infinite.

34 And you comfort me in vain: for in your answers there is nothing but
lies.


JOB here prosecuteth the matter that was treated of yesterday, that is to wit,
The one shall die in distress, and the other shall die with ^ase: that is their
breasts are full of milk, and their bones are full of maree, that is to say,
behold they are fat every way. Now when we see this diversity, the cause
thereof is unknown unto us. For if any would say, how happens that some do
so who is he that will teach God knowledge* that is too say, who is he that
will show God his office? who is he that will teach him his lesson, and say,
he must work on this fashion, or on that? Shall we be they? Can we ascend so
high as to come to the infinite height wherein God is? Alas there is to great a
distance. And if we will lift up our selves so high, God can bring us down
well enough to our shame and confusion, for it appertains unto him to
discuss high matters. Shall we walk above the Angels of heaven? We must
with all humility reverence the secrets of God and his incomprehensible
judgments and shall mortal man, that is but dust and ashes, take upon him to
search them out, and to know a reason thereof? Then must we humble our selves
to behold the judgments of God: and when they shall seem unto us not to be
reasonable, yet let us learn to be content with them, brydeling and as it were
imprisoning our minds, least God should be disguysed by us, and his majesty
and glory tra^fformed. We must acquaint our selves (I say) to behold things,
and to conclude that God does them according too reason, although it seem not
so in our own eyes. And why? for (as I have already said) during this life
our God will see whither we will confess him to be just, wise, and good,
although we have no knowledge of his righteousness* goodness, and wisdom.
True it is that he shows us signs enough of it: for he will not be
glorified of us, and in the mean while leave us ignoranthowe, nor wherefore:
he ministers unto us matter sufficient to glorisie him: but ye the does many
things wherein we are as it were blind. Men must not then usurp that which
appertains who is he that will teach God his dutis? Are we such great
doctors that we can teach God his lesson, and control him? Now when men
murmr so against the providence of God, and find fault with it: it is as
much as if they would take in hand to teach God. And what arrogancy is it,
that a creature, in whom there is nothing but all beastlynesse and ignorance,
should take upon him too teach his Creator? Then is it a cursed
monstruousnesse and against nature, when men do so highly exalte themselves,
as they will gaynesay and reply against the works of God. True it is that we
think not of it at the first: but yet all the murmurings and replies that we
make, and all the misly kings that we have of that which God does contrary
to our judgment and appetite, are as many blasphemies: for it is the tail of
all our evil thoughts. To be short, who so ever is not content with Gods
providence (yea and that with all humility,) confessing generally, that what
so ever proceeds from him is good and rightuous: the same (as much as lies
in him,) would pull God out of his heavenly seat, and spoil him of his
majesty, and set himself in his room and place. We make fair protestation
that we mean no such thing, but the thing it self declares otherwise. To be
short, as often as we be tickled with this curiosity to be to over inquisitiue
of heavenly matters, and in the mean season have such boldness mixed withal,
as we rage against God: let us note that we must come to this comparison, what
art thou? and what is God? he is thy creator, and do thou* set thy self
against him to dispute of his works, as if thou were his fellow? And what
presumest thou to do* have thou any thing in thee, wherefore thou should
enter into so deep matters, and make all things subject to thy judgment?
Where art thou become wretched creature? When we are once come to this
comparison, it mustneedes be, that we be worse than mad, if this pride
wherewith we be puffed up, be not quite thrown down. This is it that Job
meant here to teach in saying, who is he that will teach meant here to teach
in saying, who is he that will teach God knowledge? Furthermore, because men
be so bold, as they can hardly be brideled, unless they be holden by violence,
and as a man would say bound by chains: he says yet shall God judge high
matters. As if he should say, well, when men will usurp that which does not
appertain unto them, as to plead against God: what shall they get in the end?
Truly, they may allege this and that: but yet God shall not be diminished.
Let men then exalte them selves as much as they can possibly, yet shall God
always remain in his place spite of their teeth. And he shall not only
remain safe and sound: but he shall also sit above as judge of high matters,
and we shall leap here like frogs. Shall we fly above the clouds? and
although we had wings to fly so high: yet are the Angels far more glorious
and excellent. But yet are the Angels Gods fellows, or equal with him? No:
Contrariwise it is said, that they hide their faces with their wings: as we
have seen in Ezechiell under the figure of the Cherubins, and that the
Angels (although there be a great Majesty in their nature) nevertheless
when they behold the brightness of God, are constrained to hide them selves
before the glory that is in their Creator. Seeing then, that so noble and
excellent creatures are as it were astonished, when they should come near unto
the Majesty of God: what shall we do in comparison of them? Seeing that God
judges high matters, shall we presume to exalt our selves against him? Well,
we can not come so far, and whatsoever we shall throw against him, shall do
him no harm: but it must return to our own confusion: it is as much as if we
should cast stones over our own heads, they must needs fall ageine upon is
out of frame, and things therein are out of order: but in the mean season let
our faith surmount all these things here, and let us patiently abide till God
finish his works, and find a remedy for all. Now Job adds furthermore that
the thoughts of them that went about to confound him, are not unknown unto
him, nor the ways that they used to do him wrong: as if he should say, I see
whereto yetend. For ye are as it were suborned of Satan to bring men to
despair. But I will hold me fast in the hope that I have in my God. And
although I be here so much oppressed as is Inquire of them that go by the way,
you can not deny their signs. This streyne is expounded diverse ways. There
are that take these Iourneyers and wayfaring men, in an allegorical sense for
the faithful, because they be pilgrims in this world, and have no resting
place: but that is too much streyned. Some understand that Job meant too say
here, that his friends took him as a wayfarer, that is to say, as an
unknown man. As if he should say, ye handle me worse than you would do a
wayfarer or an unknown man. Othersome take it after an other fashion: but let
us hold us too the plain meening: which is, that Job meeneth too say here,
that if his friends, (or at leastwyze those that bare the name, and were come
unto him under that pretense) had a sound and uncorrupted judgment, they
would not have used such slanders against him. His saying then is, yea, ask
the wayfaring men, the thing whereof ye have hithertoo reasoned, and every
one of them can tell it you. And why? Because they are not ill minded. For in
as much as their heads be not forepossessed with cruel judgment, they will
speak the truth and as the thing is. It behooves us then too be likewise
moderated. This is the sum of that which he meant too say. Now by this we
are taught, that there is nothing so contrary too reason and truth, as an
evil affection that a man shall have nourished and conceived within himself?
for he shall be so blinded therewyth, as he shall not be able too discern
any more, and the light shall be unto him always as it were darkness.
This may help us much, if we apply it too our use as it behooves us.
Wherefore? We see how every man lets looce the bridle to his
affections. When we judge of any thing, have we respect unto reason to be
guided by it? No surely, but our affections do so rule us, that we see nothing,
because we are before occupied with some fantasy. One is carried away with his
pride, and he will not turn whatsoever happen. And if a man advertise him of
it, he will not hearken to it: what reason so ever a man shall use unto him, it
shall preuail nothing with him. When a man is so hardened against God and all
equity, he thinks he could not get better estimation, than to remain
stubborn to the end. Again, an other is poisoned with some hatred or
dispite, whereupon he will judge rashly having no power too inquire whither
the thing be so or no. Forasmuch as this vice reigns so in us, and does
preuail: so much the more ought we to note this place where it is said, that
even the wayfaring men shall teach us. That is too say, that they which judge
of a thing at the first sight, and as it were passing by the way, shall be
better and more upright judges than we be. And why? They shall not be
forepossessed with their evil affections which hinder the^ from judging aright
and according to truth. This is it that Job meant to say in this place. Now he
adds in the end to conclude his matter which he has in hand, that the wicked
is reserved to the day of his destruction, and that such men shall be as it
were trained on to the day of wrath. This is a mean that we should not run
headlong into rash judgment when God punishes not the sins of men so sone
Reserved, (as it was yesterdaye handled) well printed in our mynds, it would be
a mean to keep us in a fear, that we should not be so much carried away as we
be, seeing the troubles and disorders that are in this life. But we can find
in our hearts to reserve any thing unto God, and we think if he bring not this
matter to pass to day, to morrow he shall not come in time. The that the
wicked is reserved to the day of his destruction. To be breef, when we see the
wicked here to be at their ease and prosperity, and to triumph: it is true
that it can not be chosen but we must be tempted, and have some grief inwardly
[so as we think thus with who is he that can judge in the face against him,
who is he that shall pay him again that which he has done? It seems at the
first sight, that he speaks here of God: but it is spoken rather of the
wicked. Nevertheless it tends too approve the justice of God, and to show
that the wicked, although they have escaped the hands of men, shall not fail
but come before the heavenly judge. This is the sum of that which Job meant to
say. So then although the wicked have so passed their life as no man durst set
himself against them, and whylest they lived, it seemed that they were
exalted up to the clouds: yet shall they not fail but come to the grave. And
it is true, that according to man's judgment, the same might always be
alleged for proof of the temptations: as how? We see that all are equal.
But Job here concludes against his enemies, that although (to the sight of
men) the end be like, yet there is a judgment of God above that, and men
must not become so brutishe as to stay themselves only upon the grave, and
upon the things that are seen here, but they must know that God shall so
restore things, as the gotes shall be separated from the lambs, when God shall
declare himself to be the judge of the whole world: but the time is not yet
come. This is the comparison that Job makes here. Now again he repeateth
that which he had said, that is to say, that a man can not discern between
them both by the outward appeerance. And why? This is the man that will be
glad of the grauelly ground, but it is that his body may be buried therein:
it is all one too him after death, and they are laid both together in the
grave. Behold this is the state and condition of mankind, as it is said in
the Psalm, that they bring to the grave the bodies of the great and little, of
the old and young and that all go like flocks of sheep to the grave. So then
by the outward sight we can not discern the judgments of God. And wherefore
says Job thus? Is it because he minds to make a confusion of all? No: but it
is good and profitable for the children of God (as we have already declared) to
be armed long time before against the temptations that might

Now let us fall down before the face of our God, with acknowledgement of our
faults, desiring him to make us have a better feeling of them, and that we may
be more and more touched with them, so as we may be displeased with them, too
the end we may enjoy the grace that is promised us in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ. And that when our sins passed, be forgiven us of him, it
would please him to guide us by his holy spirit, so as we may always more and
more aspire too the perfection of the heavenly riches, to the which he calls
us, where being rid of all our imperfections, and infirmities of man, we may be
clothed with his heavenly glory, which has been purchased for us by the blood
of our Savior Jesus Christ. That it may please him, etc.

The.lxxxiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxij. Chapter.
THen Eliphas the Themanite ansvvered, and said,

2 Shall a man be profitable unto God? the wise man profits himself.

3 What cares the almighty if thou be rightuous? or what shall he gain
if thou walk uprightly?

4 Is God afeard to reprove thee, or to come with thee into judgment?

5 Is not thy wickedness great, and are not thine iniquities infinite?

6 Thou have taken a pledge of thy brother without a cause: thou have spoiled
him that was naked.

7 Thou have not given water to drink to him that was a thirst: and have
denied bread to him that was hungry.

8 And the mighty man had the earth in possession: and he that was in
authority dwelled in it.


WHen we have too do with men, if we can charge our adversary with any
thing, or can find any thing too reprove in him, we think we have half
obtained our matter: yea I say, when we our selves are in the wholly stay upon
me, and that the evil which I have committed, might be as it were darkened and
wrapped up. The common practice therefore that we use one with another, is
that we seek some starting hole, and the same must serve us to shift off the
matter: as when we can say, what? I have done such a pleasure for a man: and if
I have afterward offended him, the same ought to be laid in the balance. Thus
we would diminish the fault that we have committed: or else we allege thus:
though I have offended in this behalf, is this man altogether innocent? Now
VV'erein (says Eliphas) shall a man profit God? The wise man profits
himself. True it is that at the first sight we think we deserve much at Gods
hands, when we endeavor our selves to serve and honor him. But we be too much
blinded herein. For we imagine that God might receive some commodity by us, as
though he had need of us. But contrariwise, he can neither increase nor
diminishe: he is in them, as though they were of some value: according as we
see he likeneth himself to a husband man that has a vineyard, which when he
has caused to be dressed, he gathers wine of it, or that has a feelde, and
reapeth corn of it. God in using such similitudes, declares that he do the
so account our works, that they are unto him as pleasant and sweet sacrifices.
And also he says that when we do good to the poor, it is as if we did it
even to him, and he accepts it as done unto himself, even as our savior
Jesus Christ himself speaks of it, saying: whatsoever that God cares not
whither we do well or ill, or whither we walk uprightly or no. When Eliphas
speaks thus: he meneth not that God shetteth his eyes, and that there is no
difference of good and ill with him: but he meeneth that for himself he
forces not of it. It is true that God as he is the fountain of al justice and
right, loves equity, and if we lead an upright life, then become we the
Image of God. For it is certain that we have no goodness in our selves: But it
is as we see the sun shines here beneath, when he casts forth his beams.
The brightness that we see here beneath comes not from the earth: we see
the brightness upon the houses, and upon the earth, and yet it proceeds not
from thence: but it is a brightness reflected (as they call it) which
returns again as the earth receives it: it rests then upon the earth. For
when we behold our selves in a glass, the glass has no face: but the face
of a man presents itself there, and the glass represents it back again.
So then when we do well, it is not of ourselves (for there can nothing be
drawn from us but al filthiness and beggerie, as we are corrupted of nature)
but our Lord pours his goodness and righteousness upon us. Then if he show
us the favor in regenerating us by his holy spirit, that we live holily, we
are as glasses in the which his image is as it were represented: and this is a
brightness which comes from above, but shows itself here beneth. Now for
as much as god acknowledges all that is good to come of him: this is the cause
why he loves that which is good: as it is impossible that he should do
otherwise, seeing that he is the welspring and fountain thereof. Otherwise he
forces not in respect of himself: that is to say, for his own profit, or
advantage, that he receives thereby, he cares not how me^ do live. When men
do the worst they can, shall they thereby take away the righteousness that is in
God? Can they diminish his majesty? can they abolish his glory and honor? can
they shorten the bounds of his kingdom? No, they can not. In this sense then is
it said, that God cares not what men do: but concerning us, let us consider if
it be not our felicity to submit ourselves unto him, and to yield our selves
his obedient subjects. And seeing that he having no need of us, neither of our
life, nor works, is yet so careful that we should lead a godly life: let us
hereby know the love that he bears us: as it has already bin said that he
does voutsafe to join us unto him, and so to unite us, that if we live well, he
says his kingdom is established: if we live ill, he says he reigns no more.
And how is that? Can we so hinder god, that his sovereign dominion should not
remain Is it for fear of thee that be will reprove thee, or go to law with
thee? Here it is showed us yet more plainly, that we shall get inexcusable in
that we resist him, and beside the naughtiness that is in us, do also become
so wilful and stubborn, as we will not bow, when he goes about to bring us
back unto him. This is the sum of that which we have to consider. Now Eliphas
adds moreover. Is not thy malice great? and are not thine iniquities infinite?
Truly this is very ill applied to the person of Job (as has bin already noted)
but in the mean season we must hold us to the general doctrine, too the end
we may apply it to our selves* as it is needful for us. Let us note then,
that by the mouth of Have thou not spoiled him that was naked? have thou not
taken a pledge without a cause? Have thou not withdrawn the bread from him
that was a hungered? Have thou not denied him water to drink that was a thirst?
And in the mean season wast not thou confederate with men full of violence?
This is the cause why God does now persecute thee. It is true (as we have
already said) that Eliphas does Job great injury and wrong: but in the mean
season the spirit of God intends here to teach us the order which we
must keep for to be truly humbled before God, least we become hard hearted,
and by that means provoke his vengeance in striving against him. To be brief,
let us note that men shall never feel themselves sinners as they ought to do,
except they do particularly consider themselves,

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults desiring him to make us have a better feeling of them than we have
had: and on the other side too make us behold his holy majesty, to the end
that being as it were quite thrown down, we may be raised up again by none
other means but by his mercy and grace which he has showed us in our Lord
Jesus Christ. And in the mean season let us come and yield ourselves to the
great savior, as he calls us unto him to reward us with the crown of
glory, having no respect too so many miseries as are in us. So shall we al say,
O God most mighty and heavenly father. etc.

The.lxxxiiij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxij. Chapter.
This Sermon does prosecute the exposition of the sixth seven and eight verses,
and afterward of the text beer adjoined.

9 Thou have let the widow go empty, and the arm of the fatherless has
bin broken.

10 And therefore the snares do compass thee about, and so day ne fear does
trouble thee.

11 And darkness makes that thou can not see, and the great waters cover
thee.


A Man might marvel how and for what cause Eliphas here accuses Job of such
crimes as were never found in him. For (as we shall see hereafter) Job had bin
a very courteouse and liberal man all the days of his life: as he protests
that he has bin the defender of the fatherless, the protector of widows,
the eye of the blind, the legs of the lame, and that his hand was never
closed to the needy.

Wherefore then does Eliphas accuse him to have taken Thou have taken a gage
of thy neighbor without cause, thou have spoiled him that was naked. Here we
see that our sins cease not to be odious in the sight of God, although men
condemn us not. For if a man be so cruel to take a pledge of some poor man
when he lends him at his need: if he take from him either the couerlet of
his bed, or his coat wherewith he should be clothed: no man will sue him in the
law for it. For if he should be sued there, he should be acquitted. And why? he
has lent him his money, and it was lawful for him to take a pledge for his
assurance. Before men, he can by no means be constreyned: but we must not
therefore think to be acquitted before God. And therefore when we think and
persuade our selves to be just and innocent before God, because we have not
been reproved before men: we are deceived. For worldly policy serves not too
bring us to the perfection, that God requires of us as of his children: it is
sufficient that by it we be so maynteyned that every man may enjoy his right,
that the strongest carry it not away, and that deceit, extorcion, injuries,
and outrages be punished. To this purpose should worldly policy serve. But
when we come before God, it is not enough for us to allege, I have bin no
thief to be led to the galowes, or to be whipped, I have murdered no man
that I should be condemned to death, I have committed no crime that brings
with it either bodily punishment, or infamy. When we shall have alleged all
this, it is to no purpose. And why? for if I have borne my neighbor but a
secret grudge, I am already accounted a murderer before God. If I have
attempted to corrupt and abuse another man's wife, or if I have looked on her
unchastly: lo I am condemned as a whoremo^ger, if I covet an other man's goods,
and seek to draw them unto me although men do not cast it in my teethe, yet
am I taken for a thief before God. We may the^ out of this place gather a
profitable doctrine: which is that we to take a pledge without a cause. And
why? for simply the thing is not evil of itself, neither does God utterly
reject it, that is to wit that a man should take a pledge. Thou have not given
him water to drink that was athirst: thou have withdrawn thy bread from him
that was hungry. Here Eliphas shows that it might be that Job was punished
of God for that he had not bin so pitiful toward men as to relieve them in
their need. Now that we may gather some fruit out of this doctrine, we must
leave the person of Job, as we have before touched: and therefore let every
man consider himself when God visits us, and deals with us so rigorously,
so as we are compelled to feel our sins: I say let us examine the matter
well, whether it be not because we have not showed such courtesy toward
our neighbors as was commanded us, and as we ought to show. Here it is
said, that he that stops his ears when the poor cries unto him, and
requires aid at his hand, shall cry himself, and shall not be heard.
Behold God threatens us, that if we will not voutsafe too help them that
require aid at our hands, when we have power and means too do it, he will
suffer us to fall intoo some mischief, yea the richest and those that live
most at ease: for God has in his hand many rods too chastize us withal,
which we at the first do not conceive. Truth it is that they which are rich
hope they shall never fall intoo any perplexity, and think that although
trouble and confusion should happen through the whole world, yet should they
remain in peace. But our Lord declares that they which will not help
their neighbors at their need, nor make any accounte of them, shall come
intoo their place, and shall not be helped, neither shall there be any too
relieve them: no they shall not be heard from above, and if they fle^ unto
God, the gate shall be shut unto them: as it is said, There shall be
judgment without mercy too him that would show no mercy. And it is the
most horrible threatening that can be used against us, when God declares unto
us that he will deal with us without mercy. For what can we look for if
God have not mercy and pity upon us? we must needs all be swallowed up.
Undoubtedly, God depriueth us and barreth us from all hope of his goodness,
when we be so cruel toward our neighbors. Therefore if God visit us,
and our afflictions be great, let us learn to search out diligently the
cause wherefore, and too examine the matter thus: goto, I have had means to
help those that stood in need of worldly goods. But how have I helped them?
have I discharged my duty herein? if there were any that had need of my
help, have the mighty man in the mean season possessed the earth, and be
that had authority dwelt therein. This serves to show that the rich men have
no compassion because they live at ease. For they know not what it is to stand
in need, they know not what necessity meeneth: and therefore they are not
touched therewith. Too be short, when they be full, they think that all the
world is so as well as they. This is the sum of Eliphas mind in this place.
Now he applies the same to the person of Job. He vpbraydeth him that the earth
was not made for a small number of men as the rich men think, which have
never enough, but daily are purchasing more and more, saying thus too
themselves: This would serve well for my purpose, I must needs get in such a
piece of ground. They need but six foot when they have their full measure,
that is to say when they shall be buried: and he that has goods enough to
find a hundred persons is yet aferd he should starve for hunger. Like
insatiable whirlpooles as they are, they would not content themselves if they
had the whole earth in possession, but would (if they could) pull the Sun
out of the Sky. For it greeueth them that the poor should have so much in
common with them as to enjoy the brightness of the sun: Thus these
whirlpooles would devour all, and think that the world is made for none but
them. Eliphas reproves here such vanity, according also as it is worthy too
be condemned: howbeit he does not well too apply the same to the person of
Job, and yet this doctrine is profitable for us. So then let us understand,
that if a man abuse his credit, and cease not to gather deceitfully because
he has always where with to compass his matters and too bring them too
pass, but is of vnstaunched and insatiable covetousness, and says, I will
have such a thing, and I can yet wind in such a thing, and therefore nippeth
and pincheth on every side: it is all one as if he would have the earth too
be made for him alone. And this is it that is meant hereby, saying, that they
which have authority in the earth dwell therein. True it is that our Lord
would, there should be gouernemente: it is not amiss that there be rich men
and poor: and both are created of God says Solomon. In so saying he meeneth
two things, that is to wit, that the rich should not despise the pore for as
much as they are the creatures of God: nor the poor condemn the rich, for as
much as God would there should be both riches and poverty. So then it is very
lawful for a man to have riches in possession, and to enjoy that which he
has: But yet must he know, that we live in the world with condition to use
mutual participation one to another, and God does not only give an habitation
or dwelling to them that can live on their own, but also says that he has
given the earth for an inheritance to men. And the same is spoken generally.
And therefore although there be some in the world that have not one foot of
la^d: yet must they have a dwelling place in the world, at leastwise for their
money, if they have it not of their own: yea even in a strange country, if
they be not in their native country, and if God will so try the^. And if the
rich that dwell by the^, go about to drive the^ a far off by spreading of their
wings abroad: it is as much as if they were angry with god, and in despite of
him would take the whole world into their hand. This is it that we have to note
in this place: and it is a profitable lesson, to teach the^ which are advanced
to credit, not to be blinded with pride, not to abuse their authority as they
are wont to do. Then if a man be rich, let him consider that he must not
therefore occupy the whole earth. If he be in authority, he must not therefore
despise the poor which not offended him. And moreover when such fear comes
upon us that we be astonished therewith* because we have not walked quietly in the
obedience of our God. For unto the^ that are at peace with him, he promises
that he will keep them, although they were beseeged of their enemies: and that
although they were in the midds of many dangers, yet shall they be always in
safety, and sleep quietly and rest under his shadow. Therefore if we be
astonished with fear: let us understand that God punishes us because we have
not simply walked under his obedience. To be short, even

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, desiring him to give us such knowledge of them, as it may not
only cause us to confess them, but also to hate them, and too be displeased
with our selves for them, and too seek means too be absolved of God from
them, beseeching him also that he will so guide us by his holy spirit, as we
being wholly in his subjection and obedience, may seek nothing else but to
yield ourselves obedient unto his will. And for as much as he commands us to
live together in this world as brethren: let us continue in this brotherly
unity which he has consecrated among us, and let every man employ himself to
help his neighbors to the end that we may unfeignedly call upon him as our
father, and that he may acknowledge and auouche us for his children: as he
has given us the testimony of this adoption in our hearts by his holy spirit,
and by the grace that he has showed us in our savior Jesus Christ. That it
may please him to grant this grace not only to us but also to all people and
nations of the earth. etc.

The.lxxxv. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxij. Chapter.
12 Is not God on high in the heaven? and behold the height of the stars how
high they are.

13 And yet thou ^aist, how should God know? can he judge through the Clouds?

14 Do not the clouds hide him that he ca^ see nothing? and he walks in the
circle of the heaven.

15 Have not thou marked the old way wherein wicked men have vvalked?

16 Which were thrown down before their time, and their foundation was
as a river dried up.

17 And they said unto God, depart from us, what can the almighty do unto us?


AS we saw before, Eliphas did wrongfully accuse Job, as though he had lived
wickedly among men: And now perceiving that Job did not acknowledge the
condemnation to be true: he adds, that he is a despizer of God, as in deed
men fall into such extremity when they be given to evil, that being corrected
at the hand of God they do not return, but are rather so much the more
hardened. Therefore when the scourges of God cannot tame us, it is head and ears
in some river: such are the fancies of me. Now to the end that when we think
upon God, we might learn to imagine no earthly thing, but pass beyond this
world, and not stay on our own senses and fantasies: it is said that God
dwells in the heavens, to the end we should know that it lies not in our
power to enclose him in this world, and to conceive what he is (for we can
never comprehend him: our senses have to small a measure) but rather that we
should learn to reverence him with all humility. For this cause it is said
that God is above in Behold the height of the stars how high they be. This is
according to that which I have already said: that is too wit, that forasmuch as
the creatures here beneath do not move us sufficiently to the fear and
reverence of God: we should behold the sky: for the^ are we the more lively
touched. True it is that it is too villanouse an unthankfulness yea and a want
of senses, when we are not moved to honor God, though we opened our eyes but
only to consider the things that lie at our feet. For does the earth bring
forth so many fruits by his own strength? the food that we receive thence,
comes it of his own nature and disposition? And therefore although a man
should look no farther but at his feet, it is certain that if he open his eyes
he shall be convinced that there is a God, whom he ought to worship: but for
as much as we be dull and gross headed, that does not greatly move us. What
must we do then? To help such rudeness and infirmity, let us look upon
high: and then must we needs be very brute beasts, if we be not moved at the
sight of the sky and of all the order which is to be seen in the stars,
and so goodly and exquisite a disposition, which does sufficiently testify
unto us, that there is a wonderful majesty of God. Men then must needs be
astonished when they behold the sky. Furthermore since we know that the sun
and the stars are so noble and excellent creatures: thereupon let us ad that
which is taught us here: that is to wit, that God is above, and that we cannot
reach unto him. When we know this, must we not needs be ravished with much
greater admiration? we see that the Heathen men which were not taught, were
moved to idolatry by beholding the Sun, the Moon and the Stars. And why? for
they saw there such glory and dignity, as they thought they should have done
great wrong and injury to the sun, if they should not have worshipped him as
God. And it is certain that men in this case can do no otherwise when they have
no better direction: yet say I not that the heathen a^ therefore to be excused:
for they have conceived that the Sun and the Moon are creatures, yea eue^
liuelesse creatures which have no feling: but yet they having no scripture nor
law to be taught by, could not but be touched with this glory and highness
which appeared in the sun and Moon. By reason whereof they were moved to worship
the^ and to make idols of the^: and this error shall serve to our conde^natio^
after another manner. For seeing that God speaks unto us, and declares himself
so fully to give us record of his majesty, and shows us the way to come unto
him, and therewithal does offer us as it were aute^tick seals in the sun and
Moon to ratify that thing unto us which he had spoken by mouth (as there we
see a proof of it in effect:) I pray you shall we not be dubble gilty if this
consideration do not move us and make us to worship this great God and his
incomprehensible majesty, and to humble our selves under the same. This is the
sum of that which we have to learn out of this place. Let us now come to
that which Eliphas casts in Jobs teeth: namely that he did not think that
God marketh things here beneath. For he charge him with this ungodliness to
say, that God walks in the circkle of heaven, and that the clouds are a stop
unto him, so as he sees that the Clouds are as a covert unto God: that is
very true, howbeit in far other sense. For when the Scripture speaks unto
us of the majesty of God: it says in deed that he is hid in the clouds: and
to what purpose says it so, but to the end that we should not curiously gad
astray as we are wont to do? For we see that men are so ticklish as nothing can
be more: and when they speak of God, they dispute of him to no purpose or
reason, and without all modesty, saying: yea but how is this? and how is that?
And when they reason of God, it seems they do not only speak of him as of
their companion, but as of some one that were inferior unto them. We see
then such devilish boldness in men, that they will enter into the deepest
secrets of God, and they will turn up all things, and leave him nothing
unremoved. To be short, God must be as it were subject unto them. See whereto
we are now come. For this cause the holy Scripture says unto us, that God has
the dark clouds as places to hide himself in. And whereto says it so? It is
to mock at the phantasticalnesse that is in us. For will we purchase unto God?
Will we comprehend all his secrets? Let us come but only to the clouds, yet
are we not come to the stars by a great way. Behold, one cloud only does so
let us as we cannot see the sun. And although his brightness come unto
us: yet know we not in what place he is. When the Sun shines at noone
days, if it be a close and a raynie weather we cannot mark the place of the
Sun, to say, it is now in such a place. If a cloud let us that we cannot
see a creature which shows himself daily: I pray you how shall we
comprehend what God is? So the^ the holy Scripture mocketh at such pride as is
in men, when they will enquire beyond their measure and more than apperteineth
unto them, and dispute of God at their pleasure, and so discover him, as too
leave him nothing at all. He is then hid in a cloud (says the scripture:)
yea, but it is not for that he sees not: it is in respect of us: for we cannot
comprehend him: the cloud lets us, and our senses are too weak. And for
this cause Saint Paul says in the place that I have alleged, that men do
vanish away in their own imaginations. What is meant by saying that they
vanish, but that after men have wandered this way and that way, they fade away
as smoke? Even at this point are we: but God on his behalf has so clear a
sight, that he can pass through all the clouds of the world, so as there
shall be nothing dark unto him. And for this cause it is said that he dwells
in vnapprochable light. This saying is very notable. God then cannot be known
of us. And why, seeing that there is nothing but brightness about him? This
word vnapprochable, imports that we cannot come near him. The more a man
will lift up himself, the further he shall go from him. I mean to lift up
himself with pride and presumption, as to say I can tell what God is, and I
will comprehend him as I list. And in deed is not this a devilish ouerweening?
For (as I have said) no man can attain to the brightness of God, and again,
there is nothing in us but poverty, weakness, and inability. So then men of
their selves cannot approach unto God: but he must approach unto us, and we must
conceive him to be such as he does offer himself by his word, contenting our
selves with that which is there contained. But it is said, that although this
way be such, as by it we cannot come unto God: yet he whither he have marked
the way of the elders, and what is become of the wicked, who (says he) are
rooted out, broken and overthrown, and their foundation, that is to say, al
their stabilitie was as a river ru^ne out and dried up. Here again Eliphas
confirms that which he had said before: that is to wit, that from the
beginning men have known the wicked to be punished. True it is that God (as
we have declared) has always given some examples of his judgments, to the
end that men might be kept in fear: according to the saying of the prophet
Esaias: The Lord shall execute his judgments, and the inahbitants of the earth
shall learn righteousness. Therefore when we see that the Lord stretches out
his arm, to chastise the wicked, and she weth himself to be their judge: it
ought to move us to fear him, and to love him. God then has at al times given
some tokens that men must needs come to account before him, and that iniquity
shall not remain unpunished: but yet he does not punish the^, that offend him,
all alike. And therefore we may not make it a general rule, that the wicked
are punished in this world: for then it needed not to reserve any judgment to
the latter day. What should become of the immortality of men's souls? what
should become of the hope that we have of the resurrection? all that should
come to nothing. So then Eliphas marreth al, when he makes a general rule of
the particular examples that God has showed. But the thing that we have to
note is this: that when God has punished the wicked that lifted themselves up
against him: although the same have been done but once, yet we must conclude,
that, although there be many wicked me^ which are spared even to the end, and
after they have lined in all voluptuousnes, die in a minute of an hour without
any languishing, yet must they needs come to account. But when shall that be?
let us patiently tarry till that which is now hid from us, be reveled. This is
then the brief sum of that which we have to note upon this place. Now in the
mean season let us weigh the words that are spoken here: which are, that the
wicked for a time may vaunt themselves, yea even so far as to rail against
God, and to do things in despite of him: As Eliphas here reports of them that
they say: Get thee from us, and what can the Ahnigbtie do unto us? We shall
see then this rage so furious Get thee from us. Not that they so speak: but
that they flee Get thee from us. For although they utter not this blasphemy
with their mouth: yet men see well enough what their mind and will is. Well,
for our part, let us learn to walk before God in fear and carfulness: and
for as much as he is come once near unto us, let us pray him so to continue
with us, that we may never be estranged from him. And seeing that his word is
so familiar among us (as he does daily communicate the same unto us, by the
preaching of his holy Gospel:) let us behold him in the same, and desire him
to lift us up above the clouds: yea even unto heaven by the faith which he
has given us, and that we may increase more and more in the same, until he
have fully joined us unto himself: to behold perfitely that which is now
hid from us: and to be fully fashioned according to his image in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our faults, desiring him too make us so to feel them, that we may learn to
be displeased with them, and to sigh and groan, not for our calamities and
afflictions which we suffer, but especially for the offenses which we have
committed: knowing that when our good God lays his rods upon us, it is too
draw us to such knowledge of our sins as might make us sorry for them, and
drive us to ask forgiveness of the same, and seek the remedy which he has
promised: that is, that we running to him, and seeking to be rid of all our
sins, should coue^ nothing but to please him in all things, and to dedicate
our selves too his honor and glory: praying him so to augment in us the graces
of his holy spirit, as we may constantly persevere in his obedience in the
midst of all the stumblingblockes and afflictions that may happen unto us,
until he have gathered us into his heavenly rest. That it may please him to
grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people and nations of the
earth, etc.

The.lxxxvj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxij. Chapter.
This Sermon does still prosecute the. 15. 16. 17. verses, and some other part
of the Text thereunto annexed.

18 Yet has he filled their houses with treasure: let the intent of the
wicked be far from me.

19 The righteous shall see them, and laugh at them, and the innocent shall
mock them.

20 Our substance surely has been hidden: and the fire has devoured the
remnant of them.

21 Acquainte thy self with him, and deal with peace, and thereby thou
shalt have prosperity.

22 Receive the law of his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.


We began yesterday to declare to what end this saying of Eliphas tends,
where he reproves Job for saying, that God suffers the wicked to prosper,
and punishes them not, as it is truth in deed, according to the judgment of
the world. Eliphas and his fellows had said, that God does never so delay his
judgments, but that they appear here amongst us: which is against experience:
So that the saying of Job what can the Almighty do unto us? Truth it is that
they will not spue out such blasphemy: but yet they walk boldly like
murderers, so as they care no more for any threatening, but make a mock at all
things: until the hand of God urge them, and constrain them* they will go on
still in their wickedness. Now this is as much as if they should affirm,
that they cared not for any thing that God can do unto them: and so to be
short* we see, that Eliphas meant here to declare how far men pass their
bounds, when they have a while continued in mischief, and are become so
devilish, that they ca^ whither he have marked the way of such men, or whither
be has taken good heed of it. They which expound this sentence, as though
Eliphas reproched Job for following them, or fashioning himself like unto them,
are deceived: but rather he intends too say, that Job is a man altogether
without judgment, for that he doubts whither God punishes the wicked, seeing
he has always perceived that he does it. But herein is he deceived, for that
he says always. That might have well been: but yet God has not ceased to
reserve many punishments unto the time to come. He overthrew the city of
Sodom with the others near unto it: but has he done the like to al other
towns, that were so given over to evil? No truly. He did once send a flud
over all the world: yea but it was but once: and yet we see that me^ have not
ceased to provoke his vengeance upon them. Yea: but we must not appoint him a
law to punish sins always alike: he will deal as it pleases him, and we
must content our selves with the order that he takes. Yea truly for (as we
have showed) if he reserved no punishments, it would seem that there should be
no judgment, and that we should no more come to any accou^ts: And if al things
were so perfectly restored in this world, that there were no more to be wished
for, nor any thing to mislike: the^ would there be no more of the resurrection.
Therefore it behooves our God too use such means, as he do but only give us
some examples whereby we may know that sins shall not remain before him
unpunished, and that whereas he delayeth us as now, and holds us in suspense
till the latter day, it is too the end that we should not fix our minds here
beneth, as though things were already so accomplished, that there were no more
to be wished for. This is then a brief sum of that which Eliphas minds to
say in this verse, have thou not marked the ways of the world? for this word
world signifies sometimes antiquity: as if he should say* it is not now that
God begins to punish the wicked, but the histories of old times do show us
that he has always done so: it is so long ago since Sodom and Gomorrha
perished, it is so long ago since the fludde was. Know thou the^ that God has
brought the world under this rule, that he will deal with men according too
their deserts* Furthermore Eliphas having spoken of the punishment of the
despisers of god, and of those that were gone so far out of order that they
mocked at his power does yet more aggrauate their malice when he says,
nevertheless God has filled their houses with treasure. For if men were not
bound unto God, they might well excuse themselves in that they do not yield
themselves subject unto him: but all excuse is taken away, and men are guilty
of such unthankfulness, that they must needs remain amazed, when having
perceived that god by fair means draws the^ unto him, yet they have set
themselves against him, and would not by any means abide that he should win
the^. Now we see what Eliphas meant by saying, that God had filled their houses
with treasure. It is true that all men generally are bounden unto God, for
as much as they be created, placed in this world, and mainteyned there by him:
but when God declares himself unto man more peculiarly: that is done to make
him so much the more inexcusable. As how? Thus: too a man that is in
prosperity God sends all things as he would wish: the same man has less
cause to murmr against God, than an other which is afflicted and tormented
many ways: and when the rich men, and those that live so at ease, turn the
head again, and play the restie Iades, it is certain that the same is to be
compted a more heinous offense. And not without cause: for this gentle
handeling which God has that these were destroyed before the time, and that
their foundation was as a river that is run out. We shall see it sometime
happen to the despisers of God, that when they have hoped to attain unto
marvelous things, God shall throw them down, and they shall be disapointed of
the vain hope which they shall have conceived. We see it then: yea and
although God suffer the wicked too live and die in prosperity: what is that to
the purpose? for if we consider the present life: I pray you of what
continuance is it* We live in deed: but yet man shall be always such, as the
holy Scripture describes him to be, that is to say, as an herb that is
green. But as soon as the wind blows upon it, it withers away: as soon as
the sithe passes over it, the grass becomes hay, his sap is dried up,
and it perishes by and by, there needs but one broyling heat of the sun,
and all is burnt up. So then we knowing the frailty of our life, ought not too
think it strange, that we be compared too a river that is run out and dried
up: or too a river which runs in such wise, that if there be some water as
now: shortly after it is not such as we have seen it too be. This is a
natural thing. But Eliphas speaks here of a river that is so broken out of
his banks, as afterward it dries up, and has no more his course. Even so
fare the wicked, which are become so bold, as they think they shall never
fail: but they shall be so wasted, that there shall not remain one drop of
strength in them. So then if we take not this sentence according to the mind
of Eliphas: we may gather a good and profitable doctrine out of this place:
that is to say, that although God do not punish the wicked at the first, even
in this life: but spares them: yet they cease not too be like unto a river
that runs out: there is no soundness in them* yea and they shall perish
before their time. And why, before their time? because they persuade themselves
that their shall live here for ever, and think that their felicity shall
continue always: but God cutteth off there life, and laugheth them too scorn:
And when they say, my soul fill thy self, and think that they should swallow
up the whole world: they shall be but a straw breadth from their lives end:
for God throws them down. It is not without a cause then that he says, that
they perish before their time, for they are disapoynted of their hope when they
promise themselves long life: and our God cutteth them short, as it is said
of them, that they are, as if a man should cut the threede of a weauers
web. It seems that the threede should go still on, when we see the
weauers work apace, but the threde breaks and the web cease. So
happens it to the life of man, when we think to go forward, and it seems
unto us that we shall never have an end, we are become dronken with our
selves, and behold, in the mean season God cutteth of the threede, and there
is no more to do. Let us then mind this doctrine here, so that when we know
the shortness of our life, we may so consider the heavenly enheritance which
is promised us, that our expectation may be settled there, knowing that all
they that lay their foundation in this world, have no great surenesse, because
they build upon the water, or in before their time, that the wicked shall be
destroyed before their time, because our God takes them hence, as if he should
pull them up by the roots by force. For they fasten themselves here upon earth,
as though they should never be taken away: they take root here, but it is
only in imagination. The wicked then and the despisers of God shall take such
root in their pride, that they shall think they have a foundation an hundredth
foot deep in the earth, and that it is impossible to shake them: yea, but God
will give them but a little fillup, and they shall be that the rightuous shall
see them and laugh at them, and the innocent shall make a mock at them. It
seems at the first sight that this is not convenient, seeing that the children
of God ought to follow their heavenly father. We know that God is inclined to
mercy and pity: and when men mock at them that are afflicted, the same is
not without cruelty. How is it then that the holy Ghost attributes such an
affection to the children of God, as to mock at the wicked, when they see them
so thrown that the righteous shall mock at them whom God overthrows and
destroys: the same is not meant of all those that are afflicted: for there be
many whom God chastises for their wealth, which are not men altogether past
amendment: and he punishes them only in their bodies, too the end that their
souls might not perish. But here is no mention made but of the reprobates.
We know not whom God has utterly rejected, except he show them unto us, as he
did them of Sodom and Gomorrha, and those that were destroyed by the flood.
Here we have a certain testimony of the extreme vengeance of God, for there
was no place of repentance left for those wretched persons, because they made
themselves unworthy of mercy. Of these the^ and other such like we may
rejoice. But when God shall chastise our neighbors, and we know not yet
whether he will have pity on them, we must have compassion on their miseries,
and be so moved with the judgments of God, as we may conceive hope that he
will send some release to them that are so afflicted. Too be short, thus
must we put this text in practice. True it is, that this doctrine thus
briefly touched, might be dark: but if every man note well that which I have
touched, he may afterward more at large think on it: and so the things that
are thus briefly touched, may nevertheless content us. First of all I have
said that we must use such gentleness toward all our neighbors, as to wish
their health, and to be sorry for their evils: as S. Paul teaches us that the
rule of charity requires. Lament (says he) with them that suffer. And we see
that the children of God have always had this affection and zeal. Yet if we
see that God punishes sins, we may also rejoice at it: yea and for as much
as God therein declares and shows himself unto us, our says must be the
more and more ratified and confirmed in him, when we see that he has a care
over mankind, and that all things are guyded by him. Now it follows, that our
substance is not consumed. True it is, that word for word it is, if our
substance be not consumed or bidden. For the Hebrew word signifies two
things: properly it signifies too hide: but because when a thing is hid, it is
no more seen, and it seems that it is quite gone: by the likeness that is
between them, it signifies sometimes to cut off, and to bring to nothing.
Furthermore it seems that he ought to have said, was not their substance
destroyed? referring the same to the wicked. And in deed the place was so
translated by the Greeks. But if we behold it narrowly, it seems that the
native sense is this: yet our substance was not bidden. And let us Substance
imports our state, our being, that which we have in hand and the way to
preserve us, or restore us. I ouerpasse the expositions that they give upon
this place, which do not agree with it: let us simply hold that which Eliphas
meneth to say. He makes here comparison of the rightuous with the wicked, and
of the faithful, with the despisers of God. As concerning the by de, he
means not that their substance is perished or lost: but contrariwise, that it
is laid up in safety, as a treasure. How comes it to pass, that in the
midst of so many dangers as we are in, yet we remain upright and are
vpholden, if we were not as it were under the wings of God? To be short, if we
were not as it were in secret and laid up as a treasure: it is certain that
our life every minute of an hour should be taken from us one way or other. So
the^ we have here a very that which is left unto the wicked: it is devoured by
the fire: That is to say, God leaves them nothing at al, in so much that they
must needs be destroyed with all their wealth. It is true that during this
mortal life, it may seem that we are fwallowed up and quite overwhelmed, that
we are in great distress, and to be short, that we have another strength nor
That be should receive the law of God, and place his words in his heart. In
saying that Job should acquaint himself with God, his meaning is that he had
erst withdrawn himself from him: And in saying that he should be at peace
with him, he signifies that by his wicked life he had declared himself as an
enemy to God. This is evil applied too his person as we have already seen:
but yet the doctrine of it self is true and very profitable. And how is that?
first of all it is here declared unto us, that when men run astry, it is
as much as if they estranged themselves from God. Therefore when we be given
over to our vices: we spyte God, and are a let unto him that he does not draw
near unto us: and it is as much as if we should take our leave of him, or else
run away from him without taking any leave at all. And in deed it is not
without cause that the Scripture says, that men have not the fear of God
before their eyes, and that they know God no more, when they take such
liberty unto themselves. We see them that men grow, as it were wild, and
become such brute beasts, that they be no more of the household of God: and yet
think they be in good case when they be so departed from him, so long as they
think not upon their vices and sins. Thus much for the first. Secondly it is
showed us, that me^ make war against God. There needs no Herault nor
trumpette to make a solemn defiance: for men show themselves mortal enemies
of God and wage war against him, so often as they run astray, and pepart from
his obedience. If the subjects should rise up against a King, I pray you were
it not a war much more wicked, than if there had been some color of reason,
and the solemnities observed, as it is wont to be? Now when men give over
themselves to wickedness, they put themselves in arms against God: for it is
most certain, that look how many

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgeme^t of
our faults, knowing that if he would deal rigorously with us, we should be a
hundredth times swallowed up, and also that we are not worthy to be maynteyned
in this mortal life: and therefore much less worthy of the heavenly
inheritance and infinite glory which he has prepared for us in heaven. So
then acknowledging our sins and unbelief whereunto we are so much inclyned,
let us pray him that of his mercy it will please him to bear with us, until
the atonement be made between him and us, and that we may take such profit
by all the chastisements that he sends into the world, as we may always
acknowledge him to be the judge of the world, and that he will leave no
iniquities unpunished, how long so ever he tarry. To the end that by this
means we that are his children may be moved to fear and honor him as our
father, knowing that he prepares for us an eternal inheritance in heaven,
notwithstanding that as now we be in a poor and miserable state here in this
world. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us, but also to
all people, etc.

The.lxxxvij. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xxij. Chapter.
This Sermon is still upon the.xxij. verse: and afterward upon the text which
is hereunto annexed.

23 If thou return to the Almighty thou shall be buy It up, and drive away
iniquity far from thy Tent.

24 Thou shall lay gold upon the dust, and as the pebble stone of the river,
the gold of Ophir.

25 The almighty shall drive away thine enemies, and thou shall have a strong
fortress.

26 Thou shall take pleasure of the almighty, and lift thy hands to God.

27 Thou shall make thy prayers unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou
shall pay him thy vows.

28 Thou shall determine a thing, and it shall be established unto thee, and
his light shall shine upon thy vvayes.

29 If the wicked be thrown down, I am lifted up: and God shall save
those that look lowly.

30 The innocent shall deliver the Country: and it shall be preserved by the
pureness of thy hands.


ACcording to that which I have already declared, we must take this as an
exhortation That he which* has gone astray ought too take the law at the
mouth of God, and place his words in his heart. This is a very notable
poinct: for the rule of good life, is that we should hear God speak with the
simple law of God? we see then how needful it is for us to be oftentimes put
in remembrance of this point, to wete, that we must hearke^ what God speaks
unto us. And hereby we be put in mind, that we be like wretched beasts, that
there is neither wisdom nor discretion in us, and that we can never know the
right way, till God reach out his hand unto us, and show us which way we
should walk. Thus much for one point. Furthermore it is also declared unto
us, that we shall still be carried away with our evil affections, till we have
learned, if thou return unto the Almighty thou shall be buylt, and shall drive
away iniquity far from thy Tent. And afterward, Thou shall lay gold upon the
dust: and thou shall have such store of the gold of Ophir, as there be pebble
stones in a river. Here Eliphas (the better to stir up Job) shows him what
profit shall come unto him, when he shall be so converted unto God. Now we must
always leave the person of Job, because these things are evil applied unto
him: But yet the doctrine cease not to be good for us, and meet for our
salvation: accordingly as we see that God uses the like style when he
exhorts us to repentance, that is to wit, he does not simply command us,
that which we should do, but he adds a promise, to the intent to encourage
us the better unto it. And in deed if we should hear but only our duty, and
not be certified of Gods good will toward us, it would be a mean too stay us
and hinder us, so as we should have no zeal nor affection to draw near unto
God. When ^ man is in doubt, and knows not whether he shall do himself
good or no by coming unto God, he becomes careless. Therefore that we may
be willing to return into the right way, we must be assured that God does
wait upon us, and is ready to receive us, yea and does already reach out his
hand unto us. If we have not this assurance in our selves: we can not move one
finger breadth, and much less ca^ we come unto him as we ought to do: nay
rather (which worse is) men will always assay to run back, when they doubt
of the good will of God: yea and his majesty shall be fearful unto them. If we
conceive in our minds that God will deal rigorously with us, and that he is
our judge. We must needs be so afraid of him, as to run from him as much as
is possible for us. Thus (to be short) we see that unless we have tasted this
fatherly goodness of God, and be assured that he is ready to receive us too
mercy, a man shall never cause us too do so much as to ^ome too repentance.
For this cause it is specially said in this place, that if Job return, God will
bliss him every way: that whereas he has been spoiled of all his substance,
he shall be enriched again more than ever he was: he shall have plenty of gold
and silver: he shall have all things at his will: and God will so prosper him,
that there shall be nothing but cause of joy and thanksgiving. We see then
briefly what is the mind of Eliphas: namely, that Job should be stirred up to
return unto God by co^ceyuing the said good hope that* he shall not come to
him in vain, nor be disapointed in seeking God, because he is always ready to
forgive us our offenses when we run unto him, and will of his infinite
goodness blot out all our sins. True it is that Eliphas doothe always pass
measure in that he thinks, that god makes those whom he loves to prosper
all alike in this world. That is to great an oversight. For we see how God
afflicts his and proves their patience, by making them subject to many
miseries, and yet for all that he cease not to love the^. Therefore me^ must
not deceive themselves by imagining that God will send them all their hearts
desire when ^e is merciful unto them. But we must come again to that unto us
sufficiently: namely that men may well turn their cote, but they shall never
draw near unto God with their good will, and with a pure and sound affection,
unless they be persuaded of his fatherly love toward them: according as it is
said in the Psalm, Lord thou shall never be feared, neither will they ever
obey thee, til they know thy goodness. We see the^ how profitable this
present lesson is for us. And the better to express the same, hesayth
expressly, that man shall rejoice in God: and afterward, that he shall call
upon him, that he shall This saying ought to be well weighed, where it is said:
that they which return into the right way, shall rejoice in God: for it
puts a difference between the felicity which the children of this world and
the unfaithful do imagine, and the felicity which God gives us as unto his
children. If the unfaithful have such abundance of wealth as they be at rest,
and God give them health therwithall: they think them selves happy therefore.
And why? For their minds ascend no higher. Carnal and earthly men behold
only by paying our vows unto him when he has heard us. This is a good and
profitable declaration of this joy: for inasmuch as there is nothing else but
the curse of God in all the benefits that we receive at his hand, unless we
taste of his goodness in them, so as we may rejoice and wholly repose and
content our selves in him: it stands us in hand to consider well how we may
atteyne unto it, and what is the true means. It is here expressed that we must
first call upon him: and afterward pay him our vows, when he has heard
us. There are two things here perteyning too the end that we should pay him
our vows, that is to say, that we should by our thanksgiving proteste that
in all things and for all things we are bound unto him. For this word
vow, imports a solemn record that men yield by declaring that they have
not any thing but of Gods gift from above: and that they cannot require God
again, nor present him with any thing save only with praise and thanks: as
it is said in the Psalm, What shall I give unto the Lord for all the
benefits that I have received of him? I will receive the cup of salvation
and call upon his name. We see then that our God requires nothing of us,
but that we should do him homage for all his benefits; and acknowledge his
liberality, and so much the more extol his mercy which he has used
toward us. Thus then the way for us to rejoice in our God, is that we knowing
how much we are beholding unto him, should give him thanks for all his
benefits, and thereby be stirred up to acknowledge him hereafter for our
father, and to do him that honor and homage which is due unto him, assuring
our selves that he will never fail us, and that seeing we have felt him so
good and merciful, he will continue the same still: And not only he will
make us to know in this world, that we have not put our trust in him in
vain, but truly and perfitly

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him so to touch us with his holy spirit, as our
offenses paste may be abolished by his mere goodness, and also too bear
with us all the days of our life, until such time as having whollye clothed
us with his righteousness, and transformed us intoo his image, he make his
glory so too shine in us, as we may feel the fruit of the inheritance which
is now promised us. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly father,
thou haste promised too hear our requests which we make unto thee in the
name of thy son, etc.

The.lxxxviij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxiij. Chapter.
This Sermon conteyneth yet some thing of that which concerns the three last
verses, and afterward the text which follows.

1 Job answering said:

2 Although my talk be this day in bitterness, and my plague passes my
groaning.

3 If I knevve to find him, or hovveto come unto his seat.

4 I would plead my case before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.

5 I should know what he would answer me, and understand what he would
say unto me.

6 Would he debate the matter with me by force? no, but he would put
strength into me.

7 There the rightuous shall debate with him, and I should be acquitted for
ever.


WE have here to confer the last saying of Eliphas with the answer of Job
which we have now heard. Eliphas on his behalf maintains that God will
That a cuntry we hear the Prophet Ezechiell say contrariwise: If Job, Daniel,
and Noe were in this Town, they shall deliver their own souls: but yet
should their children perish. It seems in deed that the Prophet there, has
respect unto this place here, to show that God is not bound to save a
cuntrie for one man's sake only. If he do it: as it may happen that he will it
is at his own liberty but to appoint him a law, were a thing to unreasonable.
Truth it is that it was said to Abraham, that if there could have been found
but five that by that means God intends too draw them to him, and to kill
their fleshly affections, and to cut off the superfluities that are in the^ to
the worldward, to the end they should be the better dispozed to pass out of
it, and not settle themselves in things present. Thus must we always cheer up
ourselves in the mids of our afflictions, and make our gain when God causes
us to feel his favor, by considering that it is enough for us that we have
some promises of it here, and that the fullness thereof must not be showed as
now, as the which should not be for our that although his words be bitter, yet
does the plage that be indureth far pass his groaning [or complaynt.]
Whereby he meeneth that he makes right grievous complaints: and yet that if
men look upon his adversity and wey it well, they shall find it far
greeuouser than all his complaints. To be short, Job intended to excuse himself
of that he complained that he would feign go to law with God, and show that
if he might atteyne to that, and have leave to mayneteyne his own case: he
should do well enough, and in conclusion be quit and cleared. For then (says
he) God would but deal with me by order of law: and if I might have such
hearing, I should immediately gain the upper hand. This matter would be hard
to understand, if we called not too remembrance what has been said
heretofore: that is to wit, that although God be always rightuous, yet is it
after two sorts. The one is that which he has declared to us by his law,
and that is the righteousness whereby he deals with men and whereby he
judges them. Then if God summon us to his judgment seat, and there deal
with us by the order be the better understood, by applying of it in form of
an example in the person of Job, and in the person of some other man set as it
were by his side. Look vvpon a man whom God has chozen to himself: well, he
indeuereth to walk holily and with a good conscience: and God blisseth him,
and there appears no token that God forgets him, but rather that he
governs him and has a care of him. And why is that? Is it because that that
man has deserved it? No: for if we seek for deserte or worthiness in any
creature, it can bring nothing which is not Gods He will not debate with me
by force (says he) but there I shall have reason. How, meeneth he that God
will not deal with him by force? It were to go to law with him if he would
give him the hearing. Job then presupposes that God uses an absolute or
lawless power (as they term it) toward him: as if he should say, I am God,
I will do what I list, although there be no order of Justice in it but plain
lordly ouerruling. Herein Job blasphemeth God: for although Gods power be
infinite, yet notwithstanding, to imagine it to be Ability is to be
understood: for it is not according to the want or wretchedness that is in us
as now: (for as now we can do nothing but evil:) but according to the state
wherein we should have continued safe and sound, if corruption had not entered
into our nature. And for the better understanding hereof, let us take the
Angels for a mirror. Behold, the Angels indeuer to serve God: they are not
tempted with evil affections as we be: there is no rebelliousnesse nor sin
in them: and yet notwithstanding, although the obedience which they yield unto
God be pure in respect of us: it ceasseth not to be imperfecte if it be
compared with the infinite majesty of God. Now then, God (if he listed)
could use us after an extraordinary manner: that is to say, although there
were no law too rule us by, yea or although we had performed all that is
contained in the law: yet might he justly condemn us, but he will not do
it. And why? He is contented with the rule that he has given, showing that
he pytyeth his poor creatures. And that is the cause why the Angels are pure
and accepted for rightuouse before him. But now let us pass further. God has
promised to bliss such as walk in pureness of heart and hand: yea, howbeeit
with condition to reserve always to himself the pre-eminence too judge what
is meet and expedient for our welfare. For if God perceive that we have
need to be chastized, he will do it: And although we have had the mind to
serve him and have put our endeavor thereto: yet will he not therefore miss
too handle us roughlye sometimes, so as it shall seem that we have offended him
more grievously than the wickeddest of the world, by his punishing of us after
that sort. But it is not as Job thought. And why? For it seemed to him that
God ought to have hild himself contented with the obedience that he had yielded
him, and that Gods punishing of him proceeded simply of an absolute power, as
who should say, that God dealt wilfully, of set purpose to show the strength of
his arm, in ouerwhelming a poor creature that wiste not what too do or say,
and that there was no reason in his doings. But these are words worthy to be
blamed, yea and to be accursed. How then? Whereas God has so afflicted Job
as we see, true it is that he meant not to punish him after the ordinary
manner of his deserte: but yet might he have punished him so, even by his law.
And why? For surely God bears with us, and accepts our works in good
worth which we do through the grace of his holy spirit, although they be
faulty. But is he bound to do so? No. Has he given us his law to the intent to
be subject to us, and to be bound unto us? No. He does it of his own free
goodness. Now then if a man would compel him to it, should he not do him
wrong? Yes. Therefore Job misbehaueth himself in this behalf. For when a man
shall have walked as uprightly as is possible, yet shall he be found faulty
before God, so as he may justly send him all the afflictions in the world, and
a man must be feign to condemn and humble himself, and to acknowledge that he
has deserved yet more. Thus ye see wherein Job beguiled himself. For in
as much as God of his own mere goodness bears with his children, and
takes If it were lawful for me too find God. And what meeneth he by that?
He meeneth to go to law after the manner of men. Out of all doubt, if God
should abace himself so far, as to go to law with us: yet could we never
win our case. And that is the cause why he says in his Prophet Esaias, let
us set a judge or vmper betwixt us, too see who shall go by the better. When
God speaks after that manner, he meeneth not to resign his office, nor to
stoop so low as to submit himself too man's tyrall, that any body should
presume would God dispute with me by force? No, but he would give me strength.
Hereby he betokens, that god did presently dispute or reason against him by
main force: but that were a charging of God with things that can by no means
light into him. And undoubtedly whereas the doctors of Sorbon say that God has
an absolute or lawless power, it is a devilish blasphemy forged in hell, for
it ought not once too enter into a faithful man's head. Therefore we must
say, that God has an infinite or endelesse power, which notwithstanding is
the rule of all righteousness. For it were a rending of God in pieces, if we
should make him almighty without being al rightuous. True it is, that his
righteousness shall not always be apparent unto us, but yet ceasseth it not
too continue evermore sound and vnappayred. We must not measure Gods
righteousness by our own conceyte, (for that were too great a streytening of
it:) but we must always be fully resolved, that Gods myghtfulnesse can not
be separated from his rightfulnesse, because God cannot be dismembered. But
Job suppozeth here, that God disputes with him by main force: that is too
say, that he shows himself so terrible, as there is no reason to be had
at his hand, because there is none other thing with him, but, I am thy God,
and I may dispose of thee as I list my self. This is very true: Howbeeit, God
orders his creatures in such wise, as we must not imagine that his
righteousness is separated from his power, as I said before. And that is the
point wherein Job was ouerseen, when he said, O, then would not God dispute
with me by force. For it that God would give him strength, and not debate with
him by prerogative of his power: let us acknowledge that God gives us strength
even in the greatest rigor that he uses. For if he gave us not strength,
what a thing were it? God needs not to utter any extreme force to confound us,
let him but blow upon us, and we be dispatched. For what is man? A little
rush that is withered byandby, or else a flower, or a bud of an herb, or
whatsoever else is less: to be short, he is but a shadow. Therefore if God
show not this power in maynteyning us, we be undone, yea even with the
least adversity that he can send us. And what should become of us then if he
vphild us not, when he listed to chastize us somewhat roughlier? But he
bears us up in such wise, that when he smites upon us with the one hand to
strike us down, he has the other hand under us to lift us up again, and
suffers us not to quail. Therefore let us conclude, that if God afflict us,
he will give us such strength as we shall always stand steadfast and
vnouercome: yea verily, for he is near us, that is to say, us that are his.
Insomuch then as we feel such assistance at his hand, it ought to suffize us,
assuring our selves that

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgeme^t
of our faults, praying him to make us to profit more and more in true
repentance, and to open our eyes, that we may learn to search the wants that
are in us, and to condemn our selves for them: and therwithall resort unto
him, not doubting but that he is ready to hear us, and that whenever we
seek the remedies of our diseases, he will always show himself a good
physician in purging us of all our wicked affections: and that it may please
him to open our eyes, to the end we may behold the favor that he shows us,
in adopting us for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and in giving us the pledge
of our salvation, that thereby we may take occasion of comfort and rejoicing,
yea eue^ in the mids of all the afflictions and temptations of this world, so
as we may overcome them and all other battles wherewith he lists to exercise
us here. That it may plese him to grant this grace not only to us, but also to
all people and Nations, etc.

The.lxxxix. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxiij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the, vij. verse, and then upon the text that is
added.

8 If I come before him, he appears not too me: and if I come behind him, I
shall not atteyne to him.

9 If I come on the left side where he does his work, I shall not perceive
him: and if I turn me to the right hand, he will hide himself and I shall
not see him.

10 According as he knovveth my way, so does he try me, and I shall go out
as gold.

11 My foot has hild his path, I have kept his way, and not turned aside
from it.

12 I have not forsaken the commandment of his lips, I have laid it up,
and have set more store by the words of his mouth than by my living (or my
custom.)


Job pursewing the matter that was treated of yesterday, protests here, that
if God would handle him after his deserts, he should not be so sore
afflicted as he is: for always his meening is, if God would proceed with
him according to the rule of his law. And hereby he betokens that he is not
punished as an offe^der, but that God has some other respect which is unknown
unto him. Certesse it is very true that God deals not after this ordinary
manner That the rightcouse might go too law with God, if he would voutsafe to
deal by the order of his law. But yet it is certain, that if we should go
that way to work, we must all of us needs be condemned. For what mortal
man can boast that he has fulfilled the law of God? And it is written, cursed
is he that perfourmeth not all the things that are contained in the law. Thus
ye see that all mankind is shut up under the curse, if God listed to extend
the rigor of his law toward us, according as Saint Paul treats specially
thereof in the third Chapter to the Galathians. Job then is far ouerseene in
saying that a ryghtuouse man may plead his case, if God will give him
audience according to the rule of his law. For (as I have said) we must needs
yield ourselves guilty, not only for offending in some one point, but for
transgressing in all points, insomuch as we never serve God as we ought to do,
nor with such perfection as he deserves and as our duty requires.
Wherefore it follows that men are transgressers of the law, not in some one
part of it, but in every point. Moreover, it is true that the rightuouse may
show themselves before God, howbeit not to come to account: for wherein
consists our blissednesse, but in having our sins pardoned and as it were
buried at Gods hand, as it is written in the two and thirtith Psalm? And who
draws open his mouth to plead against the heavenly judge? It stands us
then in hand to have Jesus Christ for our advocate: and he in pleading our
case alleges not our deserts, ne sets himself in our defense, to say
that God does us wrong in punishing us: but he alleges the amends that he
himself has made, and that forsomuche as he has released us our dettes, we
be now quit before God. Thus we see that Job offended in saying that the
rightuouse and just dealing man may plead his case before God. Now as
concerning the other point where it is said, that if he seek God before him,
he shall not perceive him: and if he come behind him, be shall not overtake
him: and if he go on the left hand, he will be hidden from him: and if he
turn on the right hand, he shall not see him: thereby he meeneth that Gods
judgments are incomprehensible to him: which is a very true saying. Some
expound this of the four parts of the world: and all comes to one point.
For according Let us confess that his judgments are so deep a Sea, as we
cannot found them. And therewithal let us hold it for a sure principle, that
God continues evermore rightuous, notwithstanding that he seem too deal
crookedly and ouerthwartly: and although we find fault with his doings, and
have apparent surmises and colors so to do: yet (say I) let us always
conclude thus with our selves: Lord, thou art rightuous, according also as
Jeremy says. True it is that it grieved him to see the wicked have their full
scope and the godly men to be utterly trodden under According as he knows my
way, so will he try me, and I shall go out as gold. Hereby Job betokens that
God has a great advantage over him. in the end show us whersore he has
tried us after that manner, in making us too pass through so many afflictions,
as gold passes through fire. Although then that this be grievous to bear: yet
God does it not without cause. We perceive it not as yet, because our wit is
too weak. Howbeit our Lord will in time make us perceive that he wrought not
at all adventure, but that he knew what was meet for our welfare. This is in
effect the thing which we have to bear away here. Now when Job has said
so, he adds this protestation. That his foot bad walked in True it is that
Job might well protest that he had walked so uprightly, as that he was not of
the number of the dispisers of God, nor of the number of looce livers that were
given to all naughtiness. Job might well say so: for it was true: according
also as we see that David might well say, Lord I have kept thy
commandments with my whole heart. Lord I have set more store by thy law
feet in the way, not which we our selves have made, but which he has
showed us by his word. And not without cause does Job add further, that he
had not retired or turned back. For hereby he shows, that men are tempted
continually with a tickling lust to start out of the right way: according as in
very deed we see that God cannot hold us under his obeisance, but by force:
and even he that is most desirous to walk in such singleness as he would
neither put to nor take away from gods word, shall notwithstanding not miss
too feel prickings in That be gave himself wholly too hear the
commandment of Gods own lips. Wherefore speaks he of the commandment
of Gods lips? It should seem that that is more than needs. No, it is to
show that man's life shall that he did setmore store by Gods word than by his
own living or manner of dealing. The Hebrew word which he uses here,
signifies properly an Ordinance or Decree. And truly about a three verses
after, where he will say that God has decreed of him, or had an eye to him:
he uses the same word that is set down here. Ye see then that the proper
signification of the word is Decree, Determination, Ordinance, or common manner
of doing. And again sometimes by a similitude it is taken for a man's ordinary
living or provision, because it is a parcel of the law that a man should lay
for his living. For he must not eat so much as to brust himself in one day,
but he must take his portion too his nourishment and sustenance, and content
himself with it. Thus ye see that this word is also taken for every man's
ordinary living or provision. And either of both ways may stand very well.
What is it then that Job meant here? He meant that Gods word was a treasure
of more estimation unto him, than all the goods of the world. What thing is
dearer unto men than their nourishment? For as we love our lives, so do we
also indeuer to provide necessaries for the same. If we want bread, what a
thing is it to us? How are we dismayed at it? Forasmuch then as men have great
care too mainteyne their living: Job in preferring Gods word before his
sustenaunce of meat and drink, shows thereby that he made not so great
account of this present life, as of earnestness in obeying God, and that he
had much lever to be taught by his word, tha^ to be fed with the best meat in
the world. Heerof we may gather a good admonition. For we see how men are
desirous to live, and not only desirous, but also mad of it, so as there is
another measure nor stay in them. And yet in the mean while they wot not to
what end they live, nor why they desire life. For they have no regard of God.
So much the more therefore does it stand us in hand to mark what is said
here that is to wit, that our desiring to live in this world, must be always
to serve our God, and too dedicate our selves to his glory, and to be
consirmed more and more in the hope of the heavenly life whereunto he calls
us. That is the point whereunto we must apply all our wits and indeuers. And
if we do so: it will follow immediately, that we shall prefer Gods doctrine
(which is the spiritual food of our souls) before all the foodes that we
can wish for our bodies. For what is it to be fed with bread and water, yea or
with wine, and all other the dilicatest meats and deinties that can be
devised? What is that too the purpose if our souls be starued in the mean
while? Oxe^ Asses, and horses should be in better and more excellent state than
we. So the^ let us learn to prefer gods word (wherewith our souls are
nourished) before all the things that concern this te^porall and flightfull
life: and let our preferring of it be not only to say, I am learned: but also
too give our selves wholly to the serving of God, as I obspeaketh of it here.
Now let us come to that which I have declared concerning the word when it is
taken too signify the common manner of doing. If we take it in that sense,
truly the meening will not be changed at al in effect. Howbeit there will be one
other point very profitable and worthy to be borne away. For by that means
Job declares, that he was not wise after the manner of the wise men of this
world, who will always needs follow their fleshly reason, but that he had
quite given over al self liking to the end he might submit himself unto God.
And that is a very needful thing: according as I have touched already, that
we be but vagabundes and stragglers, if we hold not the way that God has
showed us. And how may that be done? Let us cut off, I say, let us cut off our
own customs, Ordinances, and manners of living: let every whit of it fall to
the ground, and be done quite and clean lay up: it cannot be discoursed to
day, and therefore we will let it alone till to morrow.

And in the mean while let us fall down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we
may learn too humble our selves, not only in acknowledging the mighty power
that he has above us, but also to glorify him in his righteousness, and to
know our selves always to be wretched sinners: and specially that when we
know the faults that are in us, we may continually mourn for them, assuring
our selves that God knows many mo by us, tha^ we our selves can perceive:
and that forasmuch as we be full of vanity and inclyned too deceyte and
leasings, let us desire him too refourme us in such wise, as our whole seeking
may be to profit in his schole, and as we may harken diligently to the sound
doctrine that is spoken to us in his name: not with our bodily ears only, but
in such sort as it may take good root in our hearts, that we may desire nothing
else but to be filled with it, and to have it for our ordinary food. That it
may please him to grant this grace, not only to us, etc.

The.xc. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxiij. Chaper.
This Sermon is yet still upon the twelfth verse, and then upon the text that
ensues.

13 He is still at one point, and who can turn him from it? look what his
heart desires he does it.

14 He will perform of me whatsoever he has decreed, and many such things
are in him.

15 This is the cause that I am afraid of him, and when I think of him I
stand in fear of him.

16 God has softened my heart, and the Almighty has troubled me.

17 For I am not cut off by the darkness, but he has hidden the darkness of
my face.


WE saw yesterday, that if we will obey God rightly, we must give over all
our own customs and manner of dealing, and not allege one thing or other to
make it go for good: but seeing our Lord has spoken it, we must hold us simply
to his word which he has given us. Now remains to mark the word that is
set down in that that it behooves us to lay up Gods word. And how? Not to
bury it: for if we believe with our heart unto righteousness, we must also
confess it with our mouth that we may be safe. Then must Gods word show it
self: for if we do not so, men may think that it is not in us. But yet for
all that, the good works which the faithful do, must first proceed out of
the said hearty affection, and not of any flightfull and inconstant motion.
Furthermore the word lay up, will be well enough understood, if we take the
similitude of a treasure, and apply it also as our Lord Jesus Christ does
when he says, that if a man be well stored of things, he may fetch forth
whatsoever he has need of, both for his own householde, and also for other
men's use. For if a man be so niggardly, that when he has his Chestes full of
money, and his garners and cellers thoroughly stored, he will both starve
himself, and not relieve any other body: will men say that such a one
knows too what purpose it serves to be rich? No: but he is a stark beast.
Therefore let us understand, that our hoording must be to the end we may use
it discretely, according as the case shall require. And when we have the
treasure of the doctrine of salvation laid up in our hearts, we must not only
pro-fite that if God be minded to do a thing, no man shall turn him from it.
This is still a continuing of the matter that he the honor too make us his
witnesses: according as saint John speaks of it, that whosoever believes in
Jesus Christ, has set too his seal that God is soothfast. So then seeing
that God does us the honor, too make us his witnesses although there be
nothing but vanity in us: so much the more ought we to be inflamed too
receive obediently all things which we hear of him, and to warrant our
selves that they be true. It follows immediately, that he does what soever
his heart desires. Here is one sentence more which is very true if it be
rightly God will bring too pass whatsoever be bathe determined of me, and
there are many like things in him. Here Job uses the word that was expounded
yesterday. I said that the word signifies two things: that is to wit, laws,
statutes, ordinances, decrees, determinatiens, destinies, fashions, or manners
of dealing, or doing, order, trade, custom, guize, wont or ordinary: and
also a man's provision, living, sustenance, food, or nourishment. As now Job
faith, that God will go through with his ordinance or determination. His
saying then is, he will go through with mine ordinary, or else, he will go
through with my determination. Now although the signification of the words
be double: yet notwithstanding, the circumstaunce of the place shows us what
the sense of them is: namely that Job meeneth that God will bring to pass the
thing that he has purposed of him. Whereby he does us to understand, that
we be not governed here by fortune or haphazard. And why? for God has
determined what shall befall us. When he did put us into the world, it was not
to let us looce at rouers, and to let us walk at all adventure: but he
determined what should become both of our life and of our death. Therefore let
us understand, that we walk in such wise under the guyding of our God, that
(as our Lord Jesus Christ says) there cannot one hear fall from our head,
but by his good will. For if his providence extend even to the Sparrowes, and
to the woormes of the earth: what does it unto us whom he esteems much
more, as whom he has created and shaped after his own Image and likeness?
Therefore it is an article which we ought to mark well, that every of us
has his destiny: that is to say, that at such time as God sends us intoo
this world, he has already ordained what he will have done with us, and
guides us in such wise, that our life is no more in our hand than is our
death: insomuch that it is to no purpose for us too undertake one thing or
other, because that in stead of going forward we shall go back except God
guide us. Thus ye see how the faithful may comfort themselves with Gods
providence. True it is that Job did misapplie this faying: for in his first
pangs or fits (as a man may term them) he has spoken here as a man in
despair. Behold (says he) I know I am utterly for lorne. And why? For God
has determined of me what he thinks good, and the same shall be
accom-plished, and it shall not boot me to strive against it. But surely, we
must not begin at that end: but before we speak of Gods ordinance, let us
first consider his righ-tuousnesse, that we may yield him his due glory. Then
let us not imagine the said lawless power in God, whereof I have spoken
heretofore: for that were too make him like a Tyrant, and that were a cursed
blasphemy. Let us assure our selves that God in disposing and ordering all
things, uses a sovereign rule where by all other justice and righteousness
must be squared out. Nevertheless we must not do as these vaynglorious
folk do, which argue against Gods providence and beginninglesse election. For
they see not the reason why God does all things, they imagine it to be
tirannicall. And what a blasphemousnesse is that? Are not such men worse than
devils? They be most ignorant, and yet notwithstanding, they be most busy in
seeking Gods secrets. True it is that they do perchance bear the countenance
of great clerks: but in very deed they be stark beasts, and yet they will
needs have God to show them a reason of all his doings: or else they will never
grant him that he governs all that there are many like things in him: as if
he should say, against whom do I bend my self? For though all the world
should set it self against him, they should win nothing by it: and as for
me, I am a poor woorme, and therefore it behooves me to shrink away. Surely
he does well in so saying, if so be that he yielded God the honor and praise
of righteousness, yea even in respect of the afflictions that he endured.
But he is so combered in his mind, that he acknowledges not God to be
rightuous and full of equity as he ought to do. What is too be done then?
On our part, when we have acknowledged our selves to be cuerie one under the
hand and guiding of God: let us believe also that the whole world is so in
likewise: for if the devil were not subject to God, what a thing were it? We
see with what rage he comes against us: and we see also how furious the
wicked sort are: insomuch as it may seem that they should swallow us up: and
they are as great and hideous storms that come too over whelme us. Let us
mark therefore that God not only keeps his children under his protection
too maintain them: but also that he so governs the whole world, that the
devil (do what he can) is not able to bring his practizes about, but that Gods
providence is always between him and home. Thus ye see how we^ ought to put
this doctrine in ure. Now finally Job says, that he is afraid of God, and
that the more he thinks upon him, the more he stands in doubt of him. For
he has softened my heart (says he) and the almighty has amazed me. And the
reason is, because he has not cut me off through darkness, but has hidden
darkness out of my presence. There are that set down this latter part of the
text thus: that he has not hidden: but it is clean contrary. This in effect
is that which Job meant to say. First he affirms that he is afraid of god:
and afterward adds the reason, namely because God made him to feel his
terrible majesty. In what wise? Verily Before the darkness, or in the
presence of darkness: yea and word for word it is, Before the face of
darkness. And men have misexpounded it in this wise: That God had not cut me
off before this misery happened to me. Job meeneth not so: but rather thus*
God has not cut me off as it were in covert: the afflictions that I endure are
not unknown, as men oftentimes (when they have any grief or trouble) know not
whence it comes. And afterward he adds: He has hidden the darkness of my
presence. But here some body has corrupted the Text, by setting it down, He
has not hidden, whereas contrariwise it is said, he has hidden the
darkness, etc. that is to say, he constreyneth me to come before him. And
like an offender that is led by violence before a Judge, would feign escape if
he wist how to shift himself away, or if he were in some corner alone, he
would cut his own throat, and become his own hangman in dispatching
himself, and yet notwythstanding must spite of his heart appear before the
judge, and hear his sentence of condemnation: Even so does Job show that he
himself was dealt with: that is to say, it is not in hucker mucker (says he)
that I am afflicted: I cannot say, see the mischaunce: for God shows himself
to be mine adversary, and makes me to feel that it is he to whom I must
yield mine account, and he has

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so too feel them, as we may always
return right unto him: yea even with such affection, as all our mind may be
applied therevntoo, and that we being assured that he will be favorable to
us, may call upon him, desiring him that when he has forgiven us our sins
past, he will so guide us all our life after, as all our whole labor may be to
serve to his glory. And so let us al say, Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The.xcj. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxiiij. Chapter.
How are not the times hidden of the almighty? And [hovve is it that] such
as know him, see not his days?

2 Some remove the land marks, some rob, and some fleece the flocks, and some
feed themselves with them.

3 Othersome take the Ass of the fatherless, they take the vviddovves Ox to
gage.

4 They turn the poor out of the way, so as they hyde themselves, and the
meek are pestered together upon earth.

5 They go forth in the morning like vvilde Asses of the desert for their
pray: the Wilderness gives him bread, for himself and for his children.

6 They gather their harvest in the feeldes, they gather the vintage from the
Vynes, even the wicked.

7 They spoil the naked man, so as he walks without garment in the cold.

8 They are wet with the shoures of the night in the mountains, and embrace
a stone for their bed.

9 They fleece the fatherless, and take a guage of the poor.


THe matter that is handled here, has been laid forth heretofore after
another manner. Howbeit there is nothing but we may fare the better by it, if we
consider well why God propounds this lesson so often to us. The matter is,
that God executes not his judgments to the vewe of the eye, so as it might
be seen, that he has a care of the when he lets all things alone after
that sort. Therefore we had need to be stablished in the lesson that is
contained here, and too be often put in mind of it: to the end that when we
see things turmoyled in the world, we may always have such light of faith,
as may serve us too see Gods judgments, although they be hidden from us as
now. And so the very point that Job intends too show here, is that God
hides his judgments for a time, and neither executes his vengeance upon the
wicked, nor delivers the godly at the first brunt, but suffers How are not
the times hidden of the Almighty, and such as know him, see not his days?
We have seen heretofore, how Eliphas bare us in hand, that God did judge
the world in such wise, as every man might perceive, that he thinks upon
those that serve him, and has his eye upon them, and reaches them his hand
continuallye: and that on the other side the wicked are punished at his hand.
But it is clean contrary, says Job. And for proof hereof, it is seen,
that all is full of How are not the times hidden of God? For it seems that
Job blasphemeth, in going about too exclude God from the government of the
world? And it is said that by the times, are meant the things that are How
are not the times hidden? What meeneth Job by that? He shows it himself in
saying, How is it that they which know God perceive not his days? We know
that those are termed the days of God, wherein

But now let us return to the text. It is said, that Gods days are not seen
of them that know him, that is to say, of the good me^ that trust in God,
waiting for his help, and for the salvation that he has promised them, so as
they cannot at the first brunt perceive that he will help them: they seek
him, but yet for all that, they dwell still in suspense, as though their
calling upon him had not booted them at all. Thus then ye see that the godly
cannot see Gods presence: that is to say, they cannot perceive out of hand by
experience, that God is near them in such sort as he him self declares,
saying that he is always ready too here such as call upon him in truth. Now
we have the true meening of this sentence: that is to wit, that Gods hyding
of the times, is not for that he executes not his judgments every minute of
an hour: but because he delayeth and prolongeth them, so as in the mean while
we perceive not his days. For now adays it may seem, that God has no care
of us, and that he has separated and withdrawn himself from us, because his
providence is not known to us. True it is that God sees and marketh all
things daily, and has not his eyes blindfolded. But yet it seems so to our
understanding, according as the Scripture is wont too apply it self too the
rudeness and infirmity of men. God therefore has his time: and then will he
show that he sees things. Not that he perceyueth not all presently: but
because that we on our side, are not able to discern that he has care of
men as now, and that he has his eyes open to note and mark the evil that
is committed, too redress the same. We see not this, as in respect of our
perceyuerance. There is some certain time hidden from men, howbeit well known
unto God: that is too say, God delayeth his judgments, and executes them not
at the first dashe. Thus much concerning the sense of the letter. Now let us
advise our selves to gather such instruction as is given us by this sentence.
I have said already, that it is a very sore temptation too the faithful, when
things are confuzed in the world, so as it may seem that God medleth no more
with them, but that fortune rules and governs all things. And this has
been the cause of all these diuelishe Proverbs. That all things are tossed by
casual fortune, That things are blindly guided, That God plays with men as
with a tennisball, That there is neither reason, nor measur in his doings, but
rather that all things are governed by a certain secret necessity, and that
God vouchsafes not to think upon us. Behold the blasphemies that have reigned
at all times. And why? For as (I have said already) man's wit is dazeled when he
goes about to judge of things that are out of order, and which pass our
judgment and reason. What is too be done then? Let us be armed against such
stumblingblocks: and when God shows not himself as a judge, but seems
rather too be shut up in heaven, and to take his pastime there, and too be
unwilling too deal with our affairs here: yet let us hold this for a
certayntie, that

True it is that these things are hard for us too comprehend: nevertheless
they are not written in vain: but to the end that we should receive
instruction by them, and that when iniquities reign after that sort, every of
us should dispose himself too patience, and too bear things quietly, seeing
it pleases God too exercise us by them, like as they that lived aforetimes,
have showed the way to those that should come after. Let us learn (I say) to
prepare ourselves to such things, yea and too take them patiently. For we must
not resemble the wicked by growing hardharted in cruelty: neither must we
practice the cursed proverb of playing the naughtypacks among naughtypackes.
But we must be armed with patience: which thing cannot be done, unless we
first conclude in our selves, that seeing God has permitted much extortion,
outrage, naughtiness, and cruelty to reign in all ages: we must not shrink
if the like be nowadayes, but patiently tarry till God redress our harms,
assuring our selves that the same shall not be done out of hand. And why? For
God dissembleth for a time, and things seem to be hidden from his sight, and
that he will not call ought to account. Therefore it behooves us to keep
silence in the mean while: for if we grudge it is an accusing of god, as
though he governed not the world righteously. And what else were that, than to
vsurp a superiority over him, which is too cursed a blasphemy. Now let us
come to another point which we have to mark: which is to consider
particularly the iniquities that Job marketh here. But there are some things
which seem excusable at the first sight, as when he says, that the rich men
take the pledges of the fatherless, that they take away their Asses by force,
and that they take the Oxen of the poor widows. Very well: as it has been
said heretofore, it is a lawful matter too take a gage or a pledge, and it
is permitted so to do in all commonweals. Yea, but let us mark, that when
God gave his people leave to take gages for lending their money, it was with
condition that the poor should not be grieved out of measure, and that they
should not be robbed of their goods by it, as by taking a poor man's bed in
such sort as he should be feign to lie in the straw, as I have declared
already. Behold here a cruelty that is that the Bounds, Meeres, or
Buttelles were removed, which is a very great disorder For bounds, meeres,
and buttelles, serve to sever lands and heritages, like as money (which is as
it were the common fine) serves to traffike among men. If there were no money
too occupy one with another, what a thing were it? True it is that before
there was any money coined, men might well have some trade of occupying
together by exchange: but there is no such plain dealing nowadayes, neither
could it be put in ure in so untoward a time as men see now. The money then
that is coined, and goes abroad from hand to hand, is as a surety or
warrant (as men term them) that men may occupy one with another. Besides
this, there are also bounds, meeres, and buttelles, which serve for the
feeldes, and for lands. If these be not certain and continual, there will
be no more good neighborhood among us, but our life shall be more disordered
tha^ the life of brutishe or wild beasts. And yet notwithstanding we see that
long ago there has been such craftiness, and maliciousness of changing of
bounds, and of falsifying the thing which ought to be (as it were) holy among
men. Therefore according too that which I have said already, if bounds,
meeres, and buttelles, be not kept inviolable, surely all goes to spoil and
havoc, and there will be nothing in the world, but catch who catch may. We
see that this has been aforetymes, too the end that we might be the better
strengthened against such stumbling blocks. Yet notwithstanding the time
cannot iustifye such as do amiss. And it behooves us too mark that point.
For there are many that think to sheeld themselves, by alleging that things
have been woonted to be so, and that they have been of long continuance. But
I pray you, do not we know nowadayes, that such as pluck up buttelles, are
worse than Thieves? We may well be of that judgment. For although we had
not Gods law, nor the Scripture: yet it is written in our hearts to mislike
utterly of such falsehood. And if a man allege, it has been used before, it
has been practiced more than this three thousand years: is that sufficient
to justify such as deface bounds at this day, so as they may say they have
been in possession of it a long time? No? And therefore let us learn, not too
harden ourselves at the examples which we see. If men begin to do evil,
and too grieve God, and others follow them, so as it should seem they might
do what they list, and that custom were become a law: let us not fall
asleep upon it. For god who is the rule of al right, altreth not for all that,
look what he has once ordained, must continue for ever: all men's works must
be laid to that squire, and be squared by it: and a man can no sooner swerve
aside from that, but he shall be condemned. Wherefore let us mark well, that
when men's faults and misdoings are grown into custom, we must not say, I may
follow this, because it is a woonted thing among men. No, no: But let us
always have an eye unto God, who (as I said) has stablished a rule that
shall not be changed. And although men turn too and fro, and things seem
utterly out of order: yet shall Gods righteousness continue evermore
inviolable and in his full force. And therefore let us learn to gather our
selves home patiently, and to walk in the fear of God, and too have an eye to
the said uprightness which he commands us. It is said afterward, that
the poor were shette up, and that they were made to turn out of the way, and
that the wicked had their scope, and that in stead of hyding themselves, they
^oysted in the streets, and hilde the pauement as their own possession. This
is seen more nowadayes than ever it was. But yet notwithstanding we be
warned, that when we see there is no justice, so as the very parties that have
the charge to repress lewd dealings, and sit in Gods seat, and hold the
sword and mace of justice in their hand, do not their duty: we must not be
overmuch offended at it. True it is that we ought first of That the wicked
rise betymes too go to their business, namely too go too stealing and robbing,
(says he) like wild ^sses, which are light and very nimble beasts. Here
he does us to wit, that the feet of the malictous and cankerdharted sort, are
swift in running too shed blood, and to do all manner of mischief. Diligence
is one of the greatest virtues that God gives unto men. Nevertheless it
behooves men to know why and too what end they be created, that they may
apply themselves therevntoo, and bestow all their cunning and ability too
the same. We know what is said in the Psalm concerning Gods order, that the
rising of the Sun is more than if he sounded a Trumpette. For it shyneth
unto us too the end that every man should go too his work, and to his
business, thereby to show us, that he has not made us to be idle and
unprofitable, but too apply oureselues too somewhat wherein God and our
neighbor may be served. Ye see then that the Sun is as a rayser of us up
unto God, that we may be diligent too do our duty. But men are oftentimes too
diligent, they be very buzie, and they will rise early enough: and what to
do? To quaf^e and too fill the paunche, and too run intoo all manner of
disorder, as it is said in the Prophet Esaias, that the day is not long enough
for them too make an end of their riotting. Finally when they be so weary
that they can no more, they play the brute beasts throughout. For they sleep
the day and watch the night, so as the order of nature is turned utterly
vpside down by them. An other sort rise early: and too what purpose? Too
work some treachery or lewdness to their neighbors, to deceive one, and to
entangle another. Another sort go to their whorehuntings, and another sort too
their wicked buying and selling. Thus ye see wherein most men bestow their
diligence. And this is showed us expressly, too the end we might know
wherevntoo we should apply it. Therefore as soon as the Sun rises, let
us learn too thank God for lightning us after that sort, so as we may
bestirre our hands, that is too say, employ our selves about what thing soever
he calls vstoo, and wherein so ever he will have us to serve him. Again, let
the only mark that we shoot at, be always to know whereunto he calls us,
and what be the things that he allows: and let us be very ware, that we
abuse not the light of the Sun, and the diligentnesse that God has given us
by applying it too the hurt of our neighbors, or by doing any man wrong or
displeasure. Nay, rather since we see Thieves, Whoremongers, and Drunkards so
foreward in evil, let us learn too find fault with our own sloth in
goodness. As how? Such a one is the stirringest man in the world. And what to
do? To go do a murder. But if a man be given to drunkenness or to gluttony
he lays himself in his grave before he be dead. For we see how these
drunkards are as stinking carions [more than] half rotten above the ground.
And good cause why: for it is the wages that they receive for their double
diligence in glutting themselves, and in abusing the

Now let us fall down* before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us feel them in such wise, as if he
punish us for a time by the wicked, we may yet perceive that he spares us
and bears with us in that we be not utterly overthrown by them: and that
although we have deserved to be so dealt with, yet we may not cease to have
recourse unto him, seeing that he calls us so gently and freendly: and that
we may indeuer to amend the vices that are in our flesh, and be more and more
sorry for them, so as we may wholly frame our selves to his good will, and call
our selves fully home unto him: and that thereby we may prove our selves to be
his children, and reverence him as our father with so much the greater
affection. That it may please him to grant this grace, etc.

The.xcij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxiiij. Chapter.
10 They make the naked man to go without clothing, and take the gleanings
from the hungry.

11 They that press out the Oil within their wales, and tread the
vvinepresse, suffer thirst.

12 Men cry out of the City, the soul of the vvounded shows it self, and
God puts no stop at all.

13 They are among those that hate all light, not knovving the vvayes thereof,
neither continue they in the path of it.

14 The murderer ryzeth early, he murthereth the poor and needy, and in the
night he is like a thief.

15 The eye of the adulterer longs for the evening, saying, no eye shall see
me, and he hides his face.

16 He enters into the houses by night, which he had marked in the day, and
he agrees not with the light.

17 The light of the morning is as the shadovve of death to him: if any man
know them, they are in the terror of the shadovv of death.

18 They be light upon the waters, their portion is cursed upon earth, and
they see not the fruit of the vineyardes.


HEre Job goes forward in she wing the state that is seen in the world,
without redress or providing for it by God. And this serves to prove, that
Gods iudgernentes are not always visible, nor apparent them which they had
gleaned of the rich men's leanings. Whereby he signifies, that such as have
wherewith, do abuse their credit and riches too consume the poor utterly. And
that is too outrageous a thing: and yet for all that, God provides not for it,
notwithstanding that he be the judge of the world. This might trouble us at
the first sight, according as we see that many surmize God to be asleep, when
he works not after their lyking. But it behooves us to be fully persuaded of
that, and to have foreseen it long before: to the end we be not troubled The
man (says he) that bath pressed out the Oil within his walls, the man that
bathe trodden out the wine, shall not cease too be athirst. True it is, that
oftentimes this happens through Gods just punishment, according also as we
see how it is threatened in the law, Thou shall plant trees, and not eat of
their fruit: Thou shall till the earth and sow corn, and not reap the
harvest: Thou shalt dress the vines, and not drink of the wine. When our
Lord speaks after this manner, it is not because he meeneth to leave things
out that men cry from out of for this later part may be taken two ways.
Truly some expound it, That God receives not their prayer. And the two
Hebrewe words (namely that which signifies stop, let, hinderance or
impeachment, and that which signifies prayer) have some likeness, never the
latter it cannot be taken here for prayer: for then should it have been
Thephi^a, whereas now it is Thiphla. Surely I confess, that if the points
would suffer it, that exposition would be most convenient and agreeable,
because he speaks here of crying. Then it is said that men cry. And
wherefore? Because they be wrongfully vexed, and yet God has no regard of
their complayntes. Howbeeit this translation also, that God puts no stop,
is very fit, notwithstanding that most men take it in another sense, namely
that God does not any unreasonable thing. And surely the said word is
commonly through all the holy Scripture put in that signification: that is to
wit, for a thing that is not well ruled, or which has no foundation, or
which has no truth in it self, or rather which is dishonest and to be
condemned. True it is then that this signification is most common in the
Scripture. But an eye must be had to the circumstance of the sentence. Job
meeneth not to prove here, that all Gods doings are grounded upon reason and
uprightness, howbe eit that he do verily acknowledge them to be so: but the
discourse that he makes, tends too another diverse end, which is, that we
be amazed when we behold the state of the world. Why? If it were in us,
there is none of us all but he would dispose things clean otherwise. Therefore
in this ordinance and government which we see, we have too remember that
God behaueth not himself after our fancy, ne executes his judgments in
such wise as a man might behold them, and say, See here, how it is God that
woorketh. No: but rather oftentimes he will go as it were in covert. That (say
I) was Jobs meening. And so, this sente^ice must be understood, that men cry
from out of the City, and that the souls of such as are vexed and oppressed
do mourn, and yet that GOD stops not the doings of those things: that is
too say, he lets things run still out of order. Yea for a time: but
although he wink, yet is he not asleep (as has binsayde before:) and
therefore it behooves us to suspende our judgments, and not too make it a
general rule, that God punishes men as soon as they have done amiss, so as
his justice is apparent and visible to us.

We see here the contrary, in that Job says expressly, that men cry
from out of the City: as if he should say, I will not speak of unknown
faults, (for there may be many deceytes and wrongs wroughte in hudder
mudder) but of the injuries that are notorious, which are known over all the
City, every street rings of them, every man speaks of them. And they that
are so misused make such outcries, as many men may be witnesses of the wrongs
that are done them. Behold, the very necessity of them is so extreme, as it
appears plainly, that it is high time to help them now or never, for they be
ready to run out of their wits: and yet of all the while, God makes no
countenance that he is minded to help them: it should seem that their crying
is in vain, and that it is but lost time for men too resort unto God. When
men see this, what shall they say? but that God works not after our manner,
and that all our wits must needs be dazeled at it? Therefore let us learn
to honor the wisdom which we cannot comprehend, and to say, Lord, it is
true that our flesh and our nature provoke us to grudge against thee, but yet
must not we rule thee after our appetite. Wherefore we will wait patiently
till thine hour come, and then will thou work as thou know that such as
do evil, shun the light, and bide themselves, as a thief that always
seeks for darkness and night, and when the day comes, he thinks it to be
the shadow of death. The aduouterer and whorehunter watches till the evening
shette in, that he may shrink intoo the brothelhouse. Lo how men hate the
light in doing evil. And to what purpose does Job speak it here? To show us
that God judges not the world after such manner as Eliphas speaks of. For
(as we have said) Eliphassis meening was, that things are ruled in such wise
here bylow, as men may perceive that God guides and governs all things. True
it is that we may well perceive it, howbeit not by our mother wit. Our faith
must be feign too reign in that behalf, and we must look further than to
the present and visible things. Then what says Job here? Behold (says he)
how men condemn themselves when they sin, and yet they be not condemned
by God too the sight of the world: that is to say, God executes not his
vengeance upon them at the first dash, but lets them alone in quiet. Men
therefore are compelled to accuse themselves, and as it were to make their own
indytement: they condemn themselves, and God spares them. And what is meant by
that, but that God reserueth a greater judgment to himself, and that in the
mean while he suffers things too be partly out of order, too the intent
we should draw to him aloft, and understand that this is the time wherein we
must be exercised with many battles and temptations, this is the time of
trouble, and there is no other thing to lift us up withal, but the reposing
our trust in Gods word. so as we walk not after our own fancy, nor rest
upon the things that can be seen as now: for that were the next way to make
us swerve aside from all right and reason. This is it in effect whereat Job
ameth. Therefore let us mark well how it is said, that such as seek the
darkness of the night to work naughtiness in, are sorry when they see the day
appear, and it is to them as the shadow of death. True it is that sometimes
men become so shameless, as they stick not to do evil at high noone days,
can not condemn him, till his lewdness be known abroad: but can he eschew
the presence of God. Furthermore, let us mark well how the Apostle tells
us, that the word of God is a two edged sword, and enters through the bones
and the maree, so as there is nothing hidden from it, but God examineth us in
our thoughts, and in our affections, when he appoynteth his word to be
preached unto us. Also let us add the lesson which S. Paul gives us: which
is, that since we have the Gospel to enlighten us, we be no more the children
of darkness, that the wicked are lightfooted upon the water, and glyde away:
and yet for all that, that they go to the grave Like as the earth dries in
(says he) and the heat of the Sun sucketh up the snow, and all the
moisture that is in it: So does the grave swallowe up the wicked. It seems
that Job shows here, that God punishes all the evil deeds that are done in
the world: and that there in he agreed with Eliphas. But his meening is far
otherwise. For his intent is too show in effect, that the wicked perish in
such wise, as a man can not perceive Gods hand apparently upon them, to say,
behold, God punishes such a man by cause he has lived amiss. But
contrariwise, that the wicked soke away like water, and leave no remembrance of
themselves behind them. They go to the grave, yea, and so do good men too.
So then we see how Job concludes here, that God does not so execute his
justice in punishing the sins of men, as it may always be seen. And
heerewithall let us call to mind how it has been said before, that Job
blasphemeth not God, to make himself believe that there is no providence, that
all things an ruled by fortune, and that God in the mean while sets asleep
in heaven. No: but his intent is to show, that Gods judgments are not
always visible. It behooves us to bear well in mind this saying, and to set
it always before our eyes: for it is a very profitable doctrine, as I have
showed heretofore: but yet has it need to be repeated new again. It is that
the good are greatly trodden under foot. For after long pining, they die before
their time, and yet in their own opinion they have lived too long. And why?
For their life was nothing else but co^tinull consumptio^. We

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to touch us to the quick with such repentance, as we may
perceive the evil that is in us, to seek the remedy thereof by sticking to
his righteousness and to convert us in such wise to himself, that in stead of
feeding ourselves in our own vices and lewd lusts, we may seek to frame our
selves wholly to his holy law and commandments: that we knowing what need
we have to be healed of our spiritual diseases, may seek the medicine where it
is to be found, that is to wit, in our Lord Jesus Christ: that being renewed by
his holy spirit, we may hold on our way right forth to the place that he
calls us unto, even till he have fully clothed us with his own
righteousness, after we have continued in the way of salvation, which he
shows us now by his word. That it may please him, etc.

The.xciij. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxiiij. Chapter.
19 As the earth dries up, and as the heat drinks up the snow waters: so
the sinners to the grave.

20 The loving man shall forget him, the worms shall take svveetenesse of
him: he shall no more be remembered, the wicked shall be broken as a tree.

21 He misintreateth the barrein women that bears no children, and does no
good to the widow.

22 He draws the strong unto him, so as he distrusteth his own life.

23 Men give him all for assurance and rest, and his eyes vvatch the vvayes of
them.

24 When they be exalted for a little, they are caughtavvay (or die) they be
made poor, they be barred up like towers, they be cut off as the top of
ears of corn.

25 Who is he that will make meea liar if he be not so? and who is he
that will disprove my words?


THat we may fare the better by this doctrine, we must call to mind how it has
bin declared heretofore, that the cause why these things are repeated unto us,
is that we should not be grieved and troubled to much when we see things
diuersely disordred in the world. For if we would have a perfect state here,
where were our hope? Therefore it behooves us to bear patiently the disorders
whereby it pleases God to exercise us, and to humble us: and therwithall The
earth soketh in, and the heat drinks up the waters of snow, to the grave be
sins: for so it stands word for word. And men take it as though it were
said, that the grave swalloweth up all wicked men, as the dry earth drinks
up the snow water, and as the snow melts away at the heat of the Sun.
Hereby Job meant not to say, that God punishes men apparently according to
their deserts: but that they die as other men, and that there is no such
execution Like as the earth soketh in, and the heat drinks up the snow
water: so the wicked men sin even to their grave. As if Job had said. They
be so nuzzled in doing evil, that their whole nature is given to it,
according also as it is commonly said, that when men are thoroughly nuzzled
either in good or evil, the custom that they have taken up, makes it to become
as it were natural unto them. For it bears such a sway with them, as they
follow it without any pain. Job then meant too that the quiet man will forget
such folk, that the worms shall take sweetness of them, and that they shall
no more be remembered. Hereby he shows well, that the wicked shall not
reign for ever, but must have an end. Nevertheless, God lets them alone
in peace until their death, and their state seems to be no worse than other
men's, that have lived in all equity and uprightness, without doing wrong to
any of their neighbors. Then if a man compare these pollers and thieves that
have eaten up other men's goods, and dealt merueylous cruelly, I say if a man
compare them with such as have lived in simplicity: he shall find their
states alike, and that things are so shuffled together, as it cannot be said,
but that they are out of order in this world: yea truly if we look no further,
that is to wit, if we consider not that God reserueth the punishing of the
wicked till the life to come, to the intent we should not nestle here bylowe,
but always have an eye to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, who must
redress all things that are now out of order. And now when we behold the
shortness of our life, and see such as were given to the spoiling of poor
folk, go to their grave, and become worms meat, as it is said here: let us
understand, that we be very miserable, if we labor not for the immortality
that is promised us. And here Job sets us down as it were a lively picture
and Image of man's life and death, to the end we might know what we be, if we
have no better hope than can be seen with the eye. To what purpose then is it
to have lived holily, and to have endeuered to serve God, and to please him,
and to have lived among our neighbors without deceiving or hurting of any man?
For yet notwithstanding, we must be gathered into the grave with the wicked,
all must be shuffled together there, and there must we rot. Lo what men
are, when they be considered but in their own kind. But what a wretchedness
were it, if we had not a better hope? So then considering the alterations that
are in the world, let us be warned and provoked to lift up our that they
beguile and oppress the barreine women that have borne no children, and do no
good to the widows. But doubtless under this one kind, Job meant to
comprehend all poor folk, that are not able to revenge themselves, nor have
any maintenance or aid at man's hand. His saying then is, that the wicked fall
in hand with such kind of folk, because they seem to be a fit pray ready
prepared for them. And he speaks expressly of barreine women. For if a women
have children, although she be a widow, that they draw the strong after them.
That is to say, when they have long time exercised the said trade of eating
up, and of openly before our eyes, too the intent that we should streine
ourselves to succor them. And if we do it not, we be to us, because there
will be no excuse for us. For when any are so oppressed, we must think that
the same comes not by mischaunce: but rather that God sends them to us.
Therefore whenever God makes us witnesses of any wrong that is done to a
poor man, if we step not before him, and help to shield him as much as in us
lies: surely God notes and marketh our doing. For he watches in that
behalf, because (as I have said) that the wicked (of whom he speaks) draw
the strong ones after (...), as a rage of water roteth up trees and bears
down (...). So then, such as have a long time been hardened in evil doing,
are like great storms and tempests that rend up all things, yea even the
trees and houses. This appears to the eye: and would God we had got so much
experience of it. For such as are sharp set, and would feign be catching, dare
not at the first dash boldness already, as too eat up some, and too pill
and poll other some: their crouching to them, and their greazing of them in the
hands, shall boot them nothing at all. For they be as mad dogs, whom nothing
can content. Therefore all that ever a man does to them is but a sharpening of
their appetite, and such bribes do but harten them, and harden them the more.
For they take it as a due rent, and when a man has given them one present,
they would have him hold on still, and never leave, such is their
insatiableness. It follows, that the poor Yea and I say, that even those
that were rich and in credit before, must be feign to tremble. As how? I see
(shall they say) that these wicked men have the world at will, and it will not
be long ere they will sees me such a broth, as I wot not how I shall be
able to shift it from me: and therefore I must be feign to fawn upon them
before hand, and they must gain somewhat by me, or at leastwise I must not
provoke them to displeasure. See how they that were erewhile out of danger, are
feign to quake, and distrust their own life for giving Has he forbidden me
it, would we say? Then must I not wade any further in it. And so it is certain
that all such as labor to win wicked men's favor, by briberie and such
like dealings: are very infidels, and bewray themselves well enough to be so,
and must in the end be paid home for not honoring God as they ought to do, and
for allying themselves with the wicked, by nourishing them in their
naughtiness. For it is all one as if they had conspired with them to break
and overthrow all order: and surely they have done as much as lay in them, to
do it. that they be lifted up for a little while, and afterward fall down,
they be cut off as the top of an ear of corn, and they be shet up with
others. He shows breefly that which he had said already: which is, that if
we look no further than to the present life, we shall see an orderlesse
mass, so as we shall not discern one thing from another. For the wicked have
a large scope for a time: ye shall see them upon the top of the wheel (as
they say) and by and by they come tumbling down. But good men may also be
well advanced, and yet in the end fail of their footing. What for that? we
see that by experience, according as Job concludes, saying: If it be not so,
who will make me a liar? The^ considering such experience, let us learn to
retire unto God. For if we look but upon the present things, doubtless we
shall not only be as a wavering Reed, but as a straw, and as empty chafe
that is cast and tossed to and fro with the wind, so as there shall be no
steadfastness in us. Therefore we must have the discretion to look upon the
things that are disordered in this world, howbeit in such wise, as Gods
providence be always printed in our minds. True it is that we can not reach
unto it by our own wit: but yet must we look toward it with the eye of faith,
so as Gods word may be as a loking glass, and the holy scripture serve as a
light to look further than the world. And although Gods judgments be hidden
from us as now: let us not therefore cease to say, that the Lord is
rightuous, and to humble our selves under him, and always to have such an eye
to his promises, as we fail not to call upon him in the midst of our
distress, assuring our selves that he will succor us, and make us feel his
goodness, so as we may rejoice in the midst of all the temptations of this
world.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to blot out the remembrance of them, and to bring us
back to himself in such wise, as we may no more be tangled in these earthly
things, but cleave wholly to his righteousness, that while we live in this
world, we may but pass forward as strangers, till we be come to his rest,
which shall continue with us after we have passed through the troubles and
temptations of this mortal life. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly
father, we acknowledge and confes^e, etc.

The.xciiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxv. Chapter.
THen Bildad the Suite ansvvered and said:

2 Soueraintie and terror is with him that makes peace in his high places.

3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom does not his light shine?

4 What righteousness shall be attributed unto man, if he be compared with
God? to him that is nothing? and how may he be clean that is borne of a
woman?

5 Behold he will not give light unto the Moon: the Stars are not clean in
his sight.

6 And how much less man of vvind, who is but rottenness, [or] the son of
man which is but a worm?


FOrasmuch as we be so greatly given too stand in our own conceyto, the
ground of which folly is, that we think not upon God nor what his Majesty
is: we have here a very good and profitable counsel, that as often as we be
tempted too take any glory too our selves, we must cast up our eye upon God,
and consider thoroughly that he makes peace in his high places, that is too
say, disposes the order of heaven in such wise, as men see there is a
peasable and well ruled government. This may that God makes peace in his high
places: And it is not onley in his heavenly creatures, that we see his
reigning: but also he disposes the whole order of the world in such wise
from above, that although things be disordered and moveable* here, and that
there be many chaunges and troubles, yet notwithstanding God fails not to
lead them al to such end as he has ordained and appointed in himself. True it
is that if we look downwarde, we cannot see this government so peasable as it
is set forth here. But if we look up too Gods providence, it is certain, that
even in the mids of all the turmoyles and alterations of the world, we shall
perceive that god governs al as seems good to himself. Now we see what is
imported in this saying* that God makes peace in his high places: that is to
say, he brideleth his creatures in such wise, that for all the chaungings which
men see, yet fails he not to govern still, and all things fall out as he
will have them, according as he guydeth them by his ordinance. Seeing the case
stands so, let us conclude, that it is good reason that all power,
soueraintie, and fear, should be yielded unto him: that is to say, that we
should honor, fear, and worship him, as the party that has dominion over
us, and with all reverence acknowledge him to be the master and souerain Lord
of heaven and earth. At the first blush this talk might seem superfluous. But
when we have well considered what has been touched before: we shall well see it
is not without cause that Bildad reports here the government and dominion
that god has over all the world* For that saying runs roundly out of our
mouth, and we can talk of God well enough. But in the mean while we co^ceyue
not his Majesty, we make as it were an ydoll of that. True it is that we will
not be acknowne of it* no, we would even abhorrre to do it: but yet do we not
yield God the power that is due to him, and which we ought to conceive in him.
For we talk of his majesty, and his name runs roundly in our mouth, as in way
of co^tempte* and oftentimes we talk of him in way of scorn, and mockage. It
is to be seen that men are out of measure heathenish, and that whereas al
knees ought to bow, and al creatures to tremble when mention is made of the
name of god: we be so bold as to yield no reverence nor lowliness at all. To
be short, men acknowledge not the Majesty of god, neither conceive they his
power to humble and submit themselves unto him, as they ought too do* Therefore
when there is any speaking of god, he had need to be qualified unto us: that
is to say, to be uttered in such wise as we may conceyne him. And that is the
cause why the holy Scripture does so oftentimes add tytles to him, and is not
contented with his single name, but terms him the Almighty, the Alwise, the
Alrightuous, the only immortal in himself, the maker of all things, and the
gouetno^ of all things. To what purpose is this said, but to waken men, which
are ouersluggish, and honor not God as he is worthy. To be short look how
often the scripture gives God any names of honor, it is an vpbrayding of us
with our unthankfulness and dullness, in that we yield him not his due, but
(as much as we can) do rob him of his power and glory, or at leastwise take him
not to be as he^ is to honor him, and to humble ourselves before him, and to
exalt and magnify him as he deserves. And therefore when it is said that God
makes peace in his high places, and governs the world in such wise, as me^
see that all things must stoop unto him, and that notwithstanding the
rebelliousnesse and stubbornness which is in men, yet he ceasseth not to
perform the execution of his ordinance: let us learn not to sit any longer
asleep, nor to dally with God as we have been wont to do: but to tremble
before his majesty. And above all things let us remember the Is there any
number of his armies? and upon whom does not his light shine? When it is said
that his armies are without number: it is too show that men are worse than
mad when they match themselves after that sort against God and bid him
battle. True it is, that they will not do it expressly. But yet is it
impossible to murmr against God, and to repine at his judgments, or to be
displeased with any thing that he does, but we must make war against him.
And why? that Gods hosts are without number. Behold, all the Angels of heaven
are warned to defend the honor of him that formed and created them. Likewise
all his creatures are fully disposed to avenge his majesty, which is so
assailed by us that are but worms and rottenness. Therefore let us mark well
too what purpose mention that the armies of God are without number: and
therevppon let us assure our selves, that it is to no purpose for men to
conspire against us: for when they shall have assembled all their forces
together, yet shall they not be to strong for us, but God shall always get the
upper hand of them. Wherefore let us not deceive our selves when we see
ourselves well accompanied, and a great number of people gathered about us.
And why? For we may all be confounded in one moment by the hand and power of
God. Again, although he alone be enough, either too save us or too destroy us:
yet moreover he has his armies ready furnished after an incomprehensible manner,
which shall set upon us whenever he thinks good. Therefore let us stand in
fear, and let us learn (as I said) not to be proud when we see the world
hold on our side, and a great power to mainteyne us. For all that geere shall
stand us in no sted, considering the great power of God that is declared here.
And hereby a man may see, how sore the unbelief of men is blinded. For it is
put too our choice whether we will have the Angels of heaven, to watch about
us, and to guard us, and to be servants of our welfare: or whether we will have
them against us, and to be our deadly enemies. Behold, God uses such
goodness and grace toward us, that he appoints his Angels too do us
service, as the scripture avouches: he will have us guarded by them, and
therewithal he affirms the^ to be powers, as who should say, he stretches
out his hand over us too the end he might maynteine us. Of whom then is it
long that we be not guyded by the Angels, and that they guard us not from al
harm? It is even long of ourselves who cannot take the benefit that is
offered us. We neded no more but to receive it: and what do we? We are so
far off from receiving the good turn that god offers us, that in
derogation of his majesty, we fall to provoking of his Angels too arm
themselves too our ruin and confusion. Needs then must we be bereft of our
right mind, and as it were bewitched of the devil, when we had lever too have
the Angels to be our enemies, than the ministers of our welfare: for they be
ready to help us and to guide us, so we be members of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and yield obedience unto him as our head. And so, as often as there is any
speaking of God, let us learn not too conceive any dead thing of him, but to
think in such wise of his glory, that the light of God shines upon al men: it
is expounded that God does so shed forth his benefytes upon all, as men may
perceive some sparks of his goodness and wisdom throughout all things:
howbeit that specially it is restreyned unto men: for that Being, at the
first beginning, but also quickened them too maintain them in their state,
even by the power of his word: and as touching men, together with their life,
he gave them also a light. Ye see then that all creatures have life in our
Lord Jesus Christ, who is the everlasting word of God: but we have a more
noble and exquisite life than have either the beasts, or the trees, or the
fruits of the earth. Why What righteousness then shall be attributed to man
in comparison of God? word for word it is, with God. And how can be that is
borne of woman clear himself? This is as an authentical summoning of us, to
show us that we be stark fools to set store by ourselves, and to bear
ourselves in hand that we have any righteousness or virtue, or any thing else
in us that is worthy of praise. The thief that is abroad in the woods sta^ds
not in awe of justice* nor of any thing else. True it is that he always
carries a fearfulness about him: according as it has bin seen heretofore
that God ingraueth such a feeling of men's sins in their hearts, as they must
needs be their own judges and condemn themselves. But yet for all that, the
thieves run royot still, so as they pass not to cut as many poor wayfarers
throtes as they meet with, if they can catch them at advantage. Yet
notwithstanding afterward, when they be laid up, and see their payment at
hand: then all their hardness is laid awater, the rage is quite gone that
How can man (namely that he is borne of woman) justify himself in respect of
God? Howebeit forasmuch as there is nothing harder than to bring men to
reason, and to rid them of the said vain selftrust wherewith they are abused:
here Bildad adds, that he will not shine unto the Moon, and that the stars
are not pure before God: and therefore what is man who is but a worm, or the
son of man who is but rottenness? True it is that this saying may be
expounded diverse ways: that is to wit, that God will not shine so far as too
the Moon: or else that he will not streine his tent so far, that is too say,
that he will not voutsafe too come near it: and that the stars are not pure,
that is to say, al creatures (in which nevertheless we see great noblenes)
must be as it were estraunged from God: and there is a great space betwixt him
and them. And this is said expressly, because the creatures above are
excellenter than the creatures here beneath. But how soever it be, God is so
far off both from the Moon and from the stars, as there is an endless
distance betwixt them. And how then shall we come near him? This exposition is
fit enough: and in good sooth, whether a man conster it Shining or streyning of
his tent, it comes all to one end. To be short, Bildads meening is, That if
our Lord listed to call his creatures before him, he should find no
brightness in the Moon, and the stars should be darkened. Nevertheless,
they be the things that enlighten the world: and yet notwithstanding they
must all needs be utterly drowned when the majesty of God comes in place.
Now let men stand in their own conceyte and boast themselves. Where be the
wings too carry us so high as we may take the Moon in our teeth (as they
say) or as we may stye above the stars? When we think to have any thing
in our selves, as soon as we come before God, all is swallowed up and brought
too nothing by reason of his incomprehensible glory. Now then we see in what
case men are when they will glorify themselves. Needs (say I) must Satan have
bewitched them: for it is all one as if they would fly above the stars. And
are they able to do that? If a man would cast himself but four paces
downewarde, it were enough too break all his sinews, yea and his neck too.
But as often as we have any thing too boast of, we make such leapes as were
enough too break the necks of men, yea and of Angels too, as ye would
say. Then must we not needs be worse than mad, as I said before? Lo
what Bildads meenings is. Furthermore, where as some expound it concerning the
Eclipses of the Moon: that can by no means agree: For the sense is more
simple: namely, that the noblest creatures, which seem too have even some
godhead, are nothing at all when they be compared with God. All of them must
be abased, and God alone continue in his state: so as it behooves us to know,
that there is another righteousness: power, nor wisdom, but in him only, and
that all the rest is but vanity. Yea, but for all that, experience shows
that the Sun is not darkened, nor the Stars neither. Yes surely too our
sight. Again, it behooves us too mark, that the brightness which they have,
is borrowed of another: they are as it were little sparks, wherein God shows
his glory. And so there is neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars that can glory
in aught of their own. Besides this, if God should set himself against them:
their light with the light of all the rest, must needs be darkened. For if the
Sun take away from us the light of the Stars: I pray you what would

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him that whereas he has showed himself unto us
heretofore it may please him to increace our knowledge further and further, and
to make us so to profit in it day by day, that in drawing toward him we may
be touched with such reverence, as we may desire nothing but to be subject
unto him, and to do him service, and specially that since it has pleased him to
call us to his service, we may determine to employ ourselves wholly therein,
not presuming upon our own virtues, nor upon any thing that can be in us,
but acknowledging that he of his own mere grace has chozen us to be of his
Church and people, and that in receiving that benefyte we may draw of the
fountain which he has given us, that is too wit of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and acknowledge that it belongs too him to give us the full
perfection of the things which we still hope for. That it may please him, etc.

The.xcv. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxvj. Chapter.
1 Job ansvvered and said.

2 Whom have thou succored? him that has no power? Have thou saved the
arm that had no strength?

3 Have thou given counsel to him that was destitute of wisdom? Thou say
as it is.

4 To whom tellest thou these words, and whose spirit is gone out of thee?

5 The dead things are formed under the waters and in their near places.

6 The gulf is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.

7 He stretches out the northern coast upon the vvast places, and the earth
is founded upon nothing.


I Declared in the beginning of this book, that the property which is
required in a good teacher, was wanting in those that came too comfort Job:
which property is, too divide Gods whom have thou succored? have thou
succored the feeble? have thou helped the arm that had no strength? As if he
should say, good doctrine ought not to be cast forth into the air but to bring
fit instruction to the party that it is spoken to. As how? When we see a man
that is utterly overthrown, and so dismayed as he has need of comfort: if
we should be rough with him, or if we should preserve the arm that was as good
as broken. And so let us mark well, that we have greatly profited in Gods word
when we can be nimble and weldisposed to do good, and have no broken arms,
nor trembling knees, but a lusty cheerfulness to apply our selves to the
service of God and our neighbor. Lo how we may become good scholars of the
holy Ghost. But so long as we be faint and cold, and cannot go one step
without stumbling or reeling: let us mark that we have smally profited in the
heavenly schole, and that the same comes of our own fault. For it is To
whom have thou given counsel? To such a one as had want of wisdom? It is
expressly said of gods law, that it serves to instruct the ignorant and little
ones: which property is extended to the whole scripture, which is nothing else
but an exposition of the law. The purpose therefore whereunto our Lord will have
his whole word to serve, is that forasmuch as we be blind and ignorant
wretches, we should be taught faithfully, thou have said as it is: he meeneth
that Bildads words were not ruled and directed to the doing of that which he
had too deal withal. And it is a saying well worthy too be noted. For such as
flitter in the air after that sort in their talk, know not what the right
dividing of Gods word is, but go about the bushe, only turning about the pot,
according as we see many that discourse in generalities, and wot not how to
apply the doctrine profitably as they ought to do. To what purpose were it if
I should stand here a whole half day together, and expound unto you the one
half of a book, soaring in the air and entreating of many things disorderly,
without regard of your profit and edifying? Every of you would go home to
his house, as wise as he came out to Church: and it were but a defacing of
Gods word, so as it should stand us in no stead at all. What is too be done
then? Let us remember well what is said here: namely, that we must refer
our doings too some certain end: and that when we take a matter in hand,
we must speak too the purpose, as they that are skillful too set things in
their right order, so as there may be no confusion. As how? According to that
which I have said, if we mind to comfort such as are sad and sorrowful, and
find themselves distressed in their conscience, or have any great trouble: it
behooves us to seek means to comfort them, by setting Gods mercy before
them, and too know their disease that we may apply the fit remedies unto it.
If we mind to abate the pride and rebelliousnesse that is in men, it behooves
us too show them what Gods vengeance is, and to make them feel (spite of their
teeth) that it is no sporting matter: for it is able too drown all things with
a blast, and is as a lightening to consume all to nothing. If a man will
exhort those to patience which are tormented, and cannot patiently suffer the
afflictions To whom (says he) tellest thou thy tale? And whose spirit is it
that is come out of thee? In saying too whom is it that thou Whose spirit is
it that comes out of thee? True it is that this sentence has bin expounded,
as though it had been said, Of what spirit speak thou? Is it of God, or of
me^? And that interpretation is not to be utterly misliked. For surely when any
man takes upon him to bear abroad the doctrine of salvation: it behooves him
to take good heed that he vaunt not himself of his natural wit, assuring
himself that that is not a matter for men to purchase estimation by: but that
he ought too be governed by the spirit of God, and too have the virtue whereof
S. Paul speaks, to the end he may know that it is God which has sent him.
That thing therefore is very requisite. But if a man mark well the process of
the text: Job following that which he had touched before, intends rather to
show, that Bildads words were not well disposed, because they did not quicken
his soul, which is the principal point that we have to mark in Gods word. I
said before, that Gods word serves to teach the ignorant and too strengthen
the weak: and that is because it incourageth such as are faint, cold, and
slothful, weakeneth such as are asleep in their sins, spurneth such
foreward as lag behind, and raizeth such as are fallen down: and yet there is
one thing more, namely that it quickens such as are dead. And this is it
that Job meant to show when he said, Of whom is the spirit that is gone out
of thee? that is too say, in the power of thy words. Therefore let us mark,
that the word of God is then well handled, when it gives us courage to go
forewarde, and strengthens our feeblenes, making us nimble whereas our legs
were broken, and making us stout and lusty, whereas we were destitute of all
valiantness before: but yet must it also give us life when we be as good as
dead. And this is verified specially of the Gospel. For behold how our Lord
Jesus Christ speaks in the fifth of Saint John. The time is come (says he)
that the voice of the son of man shall be heard, not only of the living, but
also of the dead. And who be those dead? Surely no man can be exempted. For
whereat begins God to make his doctrine auaylable in us? Even at the drawing
of us out of the spiritual death wherein we were all hild. For till such time as
God inlightneth us by his word, we be blind, till he open our ears we be
deaf: till he give us faith, we have another soul nor heart. True it is that
we may well seem to have some outward show of life: the unbelievers do eat
and drink as well as the faithful: again, they can go about their business,
yea and oftentimes there feeme too be great virtues in them. But all that is
nothing, because that in as much as they be strangers from God, all that is in
them is but death and utter confusion, God then must be feign to draw us out
of death unto himself, as the point whereat he must begin too make his word
auaylable in us. And in good sooth, let us see what strength there is in men
till God have strengthened them by his word. They trust in themselves, that is
to say, they lean unto a reed, that shall make them break their neck. Yea
and it is all one as if a man would gore himself upon a pike. For in as much
as it has a sharp point, and is armed with iron, if a man lean upon it, ye
see it pricketh him through. And such is the trust that we have in our own
his majesty, that they may stand in such awe of him as they ought to do. Why
so? For we see many sauadge folk, which have much ado to conceive that
there is a God in heaven that governs all things: they be little better than
brute beasts. Verily if a man speak too them of God, they make a trifle of it,
and say, yea marry there is a God. But yet they never wist what his glory is,
another had they ever any feeling of the wonderful power that is in him. Also
it behooves us too show them that Gods service is spiritual, and that we
must come too it that the dead things are formed under the waters, and in the
places near about. As if he had said, Goto, thou have talked to me of Gods
mightiness, and told me that his armies are without number, and that all
creatures are in his hand. All this I confess: yea I look yet further. For I
look even intoo the bottomless deepes, even into the nauill of the earth: I
see how God brings forth things that were not before, and quickens the
things that were dead. Whence the north co^st precisely, and yet he speaks
of the whole heaven. And that is because the sky turns about upon the pole
that is there. For like as in the wheels of a chariot, there is an extree that
runs through the midds of them, and the wheels turn round about the extree
by reason of the holes that are in the naues of them: eue^ so is it in the
skies. It is manifestly seen: that is to say, they that are well acquainted
with the course of the firmament, do see that the sky turns so about. For
on the North side there is a Star apparent to our eye, which is as it were
the extree that runs through the naue of the wheel about the which the
skies are seen to turn. There is another pole hidden under us, which we
cannot perceive, and that is called the Antartik. And why? Because the sky
turns about that also, as though one extree were put through both the
wheels* as has been said before. When I speak of this course of the
Heaven, I mean not the daily course of the sun that we see: for the sun
has a peculiar moving by it self: but this is an universal moving for the
whole cope of Heaven. And the said two stars are as it were fastened to those
places, so as they do not remove nor stir. Thus ye see why Job says, That
God has spread out the Heaven upon the Northside. And why speaks he so of
it? Because it is such a miracle, as ought to amaze us. True it is that men
have some experience of it, which causes them to speak of it. But yet does
this so well disposed order show, that there is such a wisdom in God, as we
must of force confess that the same surmounteth all reason of man, and that we
ought to do nothing else but honor our gods greatness, which is so uttered in
the creation of the world. And that is the cause why he says, that be has
founded the earth upon nothing. For whereupon does the earth rest? upon the
air. Like as we see the air above us, so is it likewise on the other side of
the earth, so as the earth does as it were hang in the midd^ of it. True it is
that the Philosophers make much disputing why the earth continues so, seeing
it is in the very bottom of the world, and they say it is a marvel that it
sinketh not, considering that nothing vpholdeth it. Nevertheless they are able
to yield none other reason than is seen in the order of nature, which is so
wonderful a thing, as men are forced to be abashed at it, and to mount above
themselves too glorify God, acknowledging that there is an infinite wisdom in
him. So then we see whereunto Jobs words tend: namely to show that he was not
so beastly, as to deny Gods majesty, but that he acknowledged his glory.
Howebeeit his meaning is too say, that the whole case stands not in treating
of it generally: but in applying of it too right use, according as we will
speak more fully of it to morrow, if God give vsleaue.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him too make us so too feel them, as we may come with all
humility to seek help in his mere mercy, and not wander to and fro, but be
so cast down in our selves, as we may seek altogether to be relieved by the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and daily profit in him more and more, till we
be fully restored by him: assuring our selves that as he has already begone
the good that is in us, so will he also continue the same, and correct all the
faults and imperfections of our flesh, even til he have brought us to the
perfection whereunto he calls us after he has rid us clean from all the
letts which hinder us and draw us back from coming unto him: That it may
please him to grant this grace, not only to us but also too all people and
nations of the earth, bringing back all poor ignorant souls from the
miserable bondage of error and darkness, etc.

The.xcvj. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxvj. Chapter.
8 He binds the waters upon the Clouds, and the Cloud sinketh not under
them.

9 He holds back the face of his throne: and spreads a Cloud upon it.

10 He has set bounds about the waters, until that light and darkness be
consumed.

11 He makes the pillars of heaven to shake, and makes it afraid at his
threatening.

12 He clyueth the Sea by his power, and appeaseth the pride of it by his
understanding.

13 He has garnished the heavens by his spirit, and with his hand has he
formed the slipperie serpent.

14 These are [but] the outleets of his ways: and how little hear we of
them? and who is he that can understand the terriblenesse of his power?


YEsterday I began to show after what sort we ought too profit ourselves by
that which is contained in the works of God: which is to consider them
reverently and too yield him the honor that he deserves. For if we think
never so much upon the miracles that God does, and yet in the mean while I
know that God byndeth up the waters in the Clouds. But forasmuch as this is a
wonted thing to us, we make no great reokening of it, howbeeit that in the
mean while God ceasseth not too show us a marvelous power that God byndeth
up the waters in the Clouds, yea even without s^nking of the Clouds. This is
to show us, that as often as the Cloud^^ gather in the air, and we see the
waters i^nclozed in them, and yet the earth is not drowned by them: that
comes too pass because God stretches out his hand. And thereby let us
know, that he s^eweth himself to us, and would make us too perceive what
power he has, namely an infinite power, and meeneth to wake us, because that
when the wether is fair and clear, we regard it not, another perceive his
glory that shows it self after that manner. And therefore he myndeth to teach
us after another new fashion, by shetting up the waters in that wise, and by
lodging them in the air, so as they hang there, and are hild as it were in a
bottle, tub, or barrel. By the sight hereof God vpbraydeth us with our
unthankfulness, and calls us home to him, showing us that in all caces he
has a wonderful power. But we see, and see not. If any man ask how the thing
that Job speaks of is possible. We be convinced by very reason, and it is
a thing that appears evidently, that God is above the order of nature: and
yet for all that, there is none of us all that is touched at it, another do we
acknowledge him but by compulsion. Herein therefore it is to be seen, that men
(as much as in them is) do darken Gods glory, and thrust it under foot. And so
much the more ought we to be warned to mark the thing that is told us here,
when we see the alterations that are in heaven and earth. God could well make
the air always close, or always fair, that there should never be Cloud.
But it is his will to have chaunges. For if things continued at one stay, we
would fall asleep, and we would imagine that fortune governed. But now in
such variety, we be constreyned whither we will or no, to think that Gods
hand works, and that he is not idle in heaven, and that he has not only
created the world once, and afterward let it alone there, but also that he
disposes al things, and guides his creatures after such a sort, as he will
have us to know that he is near at hand to us. Lo then whereupon we ought to
muse when we see the sky troubled, and Clouds thickened in the air, and rain
and alterations of seasons: namely that by that mean our Lord shows himself
to us, and draws us unto him because we consider it not enough of our
selves. Thus ye see what we have to mark in this streyne. And it is said, that
he withholdeth the face [or sight] of his throne, and puts a clowd before
it when it pleases him. The Hebrew word that Job uses, signifies sometimes
to shet up, and sometimes also to join or c^ose together* as when a man makes
Bars of iron for a building, to join the timber woork and the stones
together, that God spreads out a cloud upon it when be lists. When we
see the said alteration, it is not to the end we should know, that God has
stablished an order in things, and that when he had once created the world, he
meant to be idle ever after: but that he daily guydeth and governs all things
that he has that he has set bounds to the waters, even until light and
darkness come to an end. Behold yet another work of God well worthy to be
remembered, namely, that the waters bylowe are bounded, and that God holds
them fast, so as they cannot pass their bounds: and that the same indureth and
shall continually endure unto the worlds end. He had spoken asore of the
waters above, that is, of the waters that God draws up in the clouds, and
are hild in the air til he make them pour down in rain: and now it is
certain that if God did not bound the sea and the other waters, all the earth
should be covered with them. If a man ask the Philosophers and such as search
the whole order of nature: they will confess that if the Elements had their
full scope throughout according unto their nature, the earth should be
hidden under the water: and in good sooth, experience shows it to be so. For
why is the earth in the middle of the world, but because it is firm and
substantial by reason of his weight? For the waters are lighter, and there
withal they shed, so as they are not so firm. Consequently the air is
above the waters: and the fire is also above the air. We see then that the
Elements are distinguished according to their properties. Seeing that the air
inuironeth the whole earth (as we see:) the waters also ought to go round
between them both, that is to say, between the earth and the air. For that
is their propre place and situation. And like as the fire ouerspreadeth all:
so also would the waters not leave one foot of dry ground: the very
mountains, yea even the highest of them should be covered under them. But now
we see low and hollow places abide dry, and yet the Sea mounteth above
them. And so a man may perceive the reason that I showed before. For when we
consider what a thing the sea is, specially when it rises aloft: it is a
wonder that the earth is not overwhelmed by it. We see here a notable
miracle: yea, if men did not shet their eyes through their own
unthankfulness. The very heathen men (as reason drives them thereunto)
acknowledge, that whereas it pleased God too have some place void, the same
was too plant mankind in it: and that he had a respect unto men when he
ordained a part of the earth to abide dry: the very infidelles speak this.
And why? For the truth is so strong, as they are enforced to confess it. But
in the mean while, who is he that glorifieth God? How do we acknowledge the
good that he has done us? we be dumb for any praising of him: and (which
worse is) we defyle the earth which he has given us to dwell upon. He has
made the waters too withdraw themselves, and he has as it were fettered them
up in cheynes: and although he give us room here to dwell upon: yet (as I
said) we defile the earth with our filthiness and sins. Verily, all the
acknoweledgement that God receives at our hands, is that no man opens his
mouth to glorify him. And so it is not without cause that these things are
told us, considering how our wits, are so dull as we think not upon them.
Specially we must mark that which shall be light and darkness come to an end,
and be meddled together. that the pillars of hcauen shake, and that be makes
them afraid a^ his voy^e. After that Job has spoken of the order that is
daily seen in the world, he adds immediately, that men see such mouings in
the thu^ders and tempests, and that God makes the heaven and air so to shake,
as it seems that all should sink: which thing is done after an other diverse
manner, to make us perceive his mighty power and strength, at leastwise if we
had wit and reason to consider it. Surely heaven is not vpheld with any pillars,
but it is a similitude that Job uses here, because, great places and huge
buildings which cannot stay up themselves, are borne up upon pillars: like as
if a man should build a great temple, it had need to have pillars to bear up
so great a weight. Eue^ so is it with the heavens, which seem to be as a
building that requires to have pillars, and yet it has none: but the power of
God that he clyueth the Sea by his mighty power, and appeaseth the pride of it
by his understanding* Here Job repeteth that which he had said before. True it
is that it is another spyce of Gods power, when he says that he cliueth the
Sea. For when the waves heave up themselves, it seems that the sea should
rush upon us and swallowe up all. But when a man is in the mids of it, he
sees a dreadfuller sight. For the waves seem to be as mountains, and the
space betwixt them to be as a gulf, and yet there is no bottom too be seen.
That is it that Job meant in saying, that God clyueth the sea, and afterward
appears the pride of it. And that suddeyne change serves too show Gods
myghtie power the better. For if a man be in the midds of the Sea, in a great
tempest, and see so houge and high mountains of water: he thinks not that
the sea may be caulmed, not only within the space of two or three hours,
but also not within a whole year after. It seems an impossibility, that so
great and contrary a change, should ensue so shortly. And yet for all that,
a man shall see that after the Sea has been so turmoyled, it becomes caulme
and quiet within a while. Seeing the^ that things do change so suddenly, cannot
men see the wonderful power of god? This is it that Job me^t to utter here.
And thereupon we may gather, that his intent was to express more clearly and to
advance more highly the thing that he had said before. For generally he had
said, that god had bou^ded the Sea* and now he says that he cliueth it by his
mighty power. Thervpo^ he says further, that God has garnished the heaven by
his spirit, and shaped When he speaks here of the Serpent, he meneth not any
of the Serpe^ts that are on earth: for to what purpose should he have matched
them with the heaven? But he speaks of the number of Stars which are
commonly called the Serpent, because those Stars stand in a writhen row,
after the manner of a Serpent that wrytheth his tail. By reason of that
wrything, that figure or shape has been termed by the name of a Snake: and
that is, to the end that men might the better discern Gods works asunder
one from another. True Serpent or Snake, was but only to teach me^ to look
the better upon the order of the Stars. Again when as Job says here, that
God garnished the heavens by his Spirit, under one kind he comprehends the
whole. And what are those Ornaments? what are those beautifyings? They are that
the outleetes of his ways are there: and yet what piece of them do we
conceive? Or who is he that can comprehend his dreadful power? Lo here a
conclusion that is worthy to be well marked, according to the great weight
thereof. For it is too no purpose for us to behold Gods works, except we
conclude determinatly,

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, that with har^ie
repentance and desire of forgiveness, we may beseech him too amend our
misdooings, and too rid us more and more of our vices, too the end that
while we live in this world, we may enjoy the great good that he does us,
in applying the same to right use, namely too the serving and honoring of him
in such wise, as we may not have our eyes shet when he shows his majesty
after so evident a fashion. And forasmuch as we be as it were dazeled in our
own understanding: let us beseech him too inlighten us by his holy spirit,
and too waken us from the^ drouzinesse wherein we be: that we may not seek
any thing else, than to spend our selves in his service, and to incorage
others thereto by our example, so as he may be exalted and magnified of all
men with one common consent, as he deserves. And for performance thereof, let
us pray him to raise up true and faithful ministers of his word, etc.

The.xcvij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxvij. Chapter.
Job took up his parable again, and said.

2. God lives, who has taken away my right, the almighty who has set my
soul in bitterness.

3. So long as my breath shall continue, and the spirit of God is in my
nozethrills.

4. My lips shall speak no wickedness, and my tongue shall utter no deceyte.


Here we have still the same matter that has been treated of heretofore. For
Job vpholdeth, that he was not afflicted for the faults which he had committed,
but that there was some secret reason, and that if he listed to debate and
plead that Job took up his parable new again. And to the intent that the
thing which he says may be of the more authority, he begins with a
protestation that imports an oath. God (says he) lives, who has taken
away my right, even the Almighty has set my soul in anguish: and yet for all
that, I will never swerve. And whereas I have maynteyned my self too be
rightuouse: that was not through any pride, nor for any hypocrisy, nor of any
sturdinesse, nor for that I knew not that God might afflict me after that
sort: but because that God has taken and plucked his right from him. For he
seems here too plead with God in defense of his own righteousness: and
secondly too accuse God of cruelty and outrage. Thus see you two things which
might be very strange, if Jobs intent were not known. But let us mark, that
when he says, that God has bereft him of his right, he meeneth not that
God uses a tyrannical manner of dealing with him, another meeneth he that
himself is so rightuouse that God had not cause too punish him yet more
rigorously: but rather he has an eye to the ordinanarie righteousness that is
written of in the law, and to the purpose of such as had condemned him. For
(as I have said) Jobs friends went no further than thus: namely, God punishes
such as have done amiss, and is the father and Savior of good men.
Therefore it follows that Job is a wicked man, and a despizer of God, and that
all his life is out of order. And why? For men see he is punished with
extremity. If ye mark all the adversities that happen commonly in this world,
they be not so great as this is: and therefore it must needs be concluded,
that God has found this man to be an outrageous sinner above all the rest.
Lo what conclusion Jobs friends made. But they delte yet worse: for they
rested upon the curses that are in Gods law, imagining that all of them must
be accomplished in this present life, and that there is no more reward for the
good and for the seruers of God after death, and that it is not too be thought
that the wicked shall be punished any where else than here. This is an ouerth
wart expounding of Gods law. For although our Lord threaten that he will
punish offenders: he meeneth not to restreyne himself to any certain time. True
it is that this is ordinarily seen in this present life, howebeeit not
continually: we must not make a general rule of it without exception: for
that were a bringing of God too much under coram. So then we see that Job had
the better end of the staff against his friends: and therefore let us bear in
mind how it has bin told before, that it stands us in hand to have great
discretion in judging of the afflictions that God sends, as well upon our
selves as upon our neighbors. For if we should conster Gods love toward us,
according to his present handling of us: it were enough to make us despair at
every blow. True it is, that if he punish us, we be always well worthy God
has bereft me of my judgment. What is the meening of these words? As I have
said before, Job meeneth not that God uses a tyrannical fashion in doing so.
Mark that for one point. And again, he meeneth not that he has so good right
on his side, as that he shall be able to get the upper hand, and to clear
himself not too have done amiss, when the matter shall The almighty (says
he) has set my soul in anguish. For so long as we perceive not the cause why
God has punished him so, so long his right is as it were buried, insomuche
that he may seem to the world to be a wicked and detestable person. But
let us mark well, that he speaks here after the common opinion, and
meeneth not that God has not ryghtfull reason so too do, specially in his
own secret purpose, but that it behooves us to mount up higher, and too stye
above all the thick and dark clouds that darken the light, or else we
shall never know Jobs righteousness. So we see there is a double
righteousness in God: the one which is manifest unto us, because it is
contained in the law, and also has some agreement with the reason that God
has given us: and the other which passes all our understanding. Therefore
we comprehend not this but by faith, and we must rather honor it as a thing
hidden from us, waiting for the coming of the latter day, wherein we shall see
the things face to face, which are now dark and hidden of us, and as it were
to abhor us, and in letting us alone in that plight as good as overwhelmed.
And mark the cause why it is said that he will make the righteousness of his
servants to shine forth as the break of the day. The giving of this promise
is not as much to say as it shall always be performed to eyesight: for it
behooves us oftentimes too abide shame and reproach. Yea and Saint Paul
himself shows it, I say even he that had lived in angelical perfectness,
shows that he was subject thereunto, and not only that he was cast up too
the Lord lives who has bereft me of my judgment, even the Almighty who
has set my soul in anguish. Here Job plays not the restie Horse. For
although he have double anguishe: yet knows he well that God has all
dominion and superiority over him. For he would not say God lives, except it
were to honor him, as if he should say, Lord I am thy silly creature, and
thou have all power over me. I said he was in double affliction, which thing
we ought to mark well. For we have seen how he was persecuted both in his
goods and in his person, so that he endured as much as was possible for a
mortal wight to endure. And yet had he another affliction, which is, that he
was tormented by such as came to move him to despair. For it passed all other
miseries, too have it said too him, God hates thee, thou see well enough
that thou have no more access to him, it is in vain for thee to look for any
ease at his hand: for he is against thee, and he gives thee a sure token of
it in afflicting thee after this manner. What should thou do but condemn
thy whole life before passed? If thou will have any mercy at Gods hand, thou
must change altogether, and acknowledge that hitherto thou have been stark
naught, a mocker of God, and a man full of hypocrisy and lewdness. Thus then
ye see the two afflictions that Job endured, and yet notwithstanding honored
God still. For he swears by his name: howbeeit not as men do now adays
which blaspheme God in swearing. For doubtless what else are the oaths that
are sworn now adays for the most part, but reproaches unto God in despizing
his name? Like as if a man swear at adventure, he shows well that he
regards not the name of God, which ought to be holy in our sight, that
whenever we hear any speaking of it, we ought too cast down our heads,
and acknowledge the infinite glory that is in him. But contrariwise the name
of God runs roundly in our mouths in way of mockage. And therefore look
how many light oaths a man makes, so many are the reproaches and injuries
wherewith he disgraceth the name of God. Again there are also forswearings,
which are yet more heinous: in so much that after a man has invred himself
to swear foolishly, he goes foreward with it to falsify the truth, and to
turn it into a lie, and the name of God shall run in such wise with it, as it
shall be a pleasure for men to think upon it. But Job in his swearing had an
eye to the principal point: which is, that when we swear by the name of
God, we must acknowledge him to be our judge, yielding him his due authority,
by setting our selves before his throne to be condemned by him if we have done
amiss. We see then how Job acknowledges his afflictions too come of Gods
hand, and deals not stubbornly. He kicketh not against his master like a
restie Jade, but humbles himself and says, God lives howsoever the world
goes. True it is that I see my self to be a forlorn man, and I endure so
much, as it is impossible for me to be so pacient as I ought to be. Yet will
I not be so desperate as to play the mad bedlem, and to say, I know not what
God is, I would he would let me alone, and that he had no more power over me:
but contrariwise I know him to be my judge, and to have all authority: I will
not embrace the mighty power which he has over me, but I will hold me always
under his hand, acknowledging my afflictions to be of his sending. And
therefore not without cause have I said, that we have here an excellent
doctrine. For we be taught, first to acquaint our selves with chastizement and
correction at Gods hand. Wherefore when we happen to be tempted to despair,
and feel such a fearfulness in our selves as we think our selves to be
already in hell: let us acknowledge our own frailty and lean unto this,
namely that God hydeth our judgment, and bereeueth us in such wise of our
right, as that so long as he lives there shall not pass any deceyte nor
wicked word out of his mouth. Hereby he shows, that he speaks as in the
presence of God. And that is a thing well worthy to be noted. I have told you
oftentimes in expounding this book how there is an ouercommon vice among men
which marreth them: which is, that they be so wedded to the world, as they
never come in the presence of God to examine themselves there. As how? If men
blame us falsely: we rest so much upon them, as we enter not into our selves to
examine our selves before So long (says he) as there shall be any wind or
breath in me, and so long as the spirit of God is in my nozethrilles. For he
speaks not of his life as though he hilde it without the grace of God. True
it is, that we may say, it is a thing common enough, and no man will deny but
we be beholden too God for our breath and for all the liveliness that we
have: but yet for all that, how many are there that acknowledge it in good
earnest? men live here after so brutish a fashion, as it might be said that
they take themselves to be sustained of themselves and of their own power. To
be short, there are very few that know rightly, what S. Paul means by
saying, that we have our life, moving, and being in God: there are very few
I say, which know that. And therefore let us mark well how Job shows us
here, that he was not carried away as many men are, who are so dazeled with
their passions, as they have no more skill at all, neither know what they say.
True it is that indiscreet words escaped him, (as we have seen, and shall
see hereafter:) but yet nevertheless, he always hilde himself upon the good
foundation, and although the buylding were not suitable to the same, yet I say
he hilde himself in the fear and awe of God. And further let us mark well
this circumstance, that Job speaks not at his own leisure and ease. Ye see
he is in such afflictions, as God seems to be fully determined too destroy
him utterly: and yet he honoreth him still for his life, acknowledging him to
be the party of whom he has his life. And I pray you, what excuse shall we
have if we be not fully resolved thereof, since that God gives us releace too
make us mindful of his grace, or if we do not acknowledge and confess, that
our life and all that ever depends thereupon, proceed of his grace and
power? Shall we not be the more inexcusable? As often then as we think upon
our life, let us remember that it behooves us to make the same confession that
Job makes here: namely that there is neither blast nor breath in me of mine
own power, but it is God that has given me euerywhit of it. True it is that
when Job speaks here of Gods spirit, we must not imagine as the fantastical
sort do, who think that the very substance of Gods spirit is in them: for
there is not a more abominable heresy than that is. And it behooves us
always too mark such manner of speeches in the holy Scripture, to the end
we fall not into such heresy, as to say, that Gods spirit is in us as
touching his very substance. For what a thing were that? It should ensue that
Gods spirit were subject to ignorance, to change, and to mutabilitie, yea and
that he were defiled and steyned with our sins and vices. And yet
nevertheless (as I have said) it is a point that has sore troubled the
Christen Church: like as the unhappy Heretic that was punished here, had a
conceyte to say that men's souls were parttakers of the substance of the
Godhead. But that is a thing so horrible and against nature, as a man must
needs be utterly grown out of kind, ere he can come to it. So then let us
mark, that the speaking of Gods spirit here, imports not that the substance
of him is in us: but it is meant of his breathing, that is to say, of that which
he inspireth into us by his power according as we see how the Sun abides in
the sky, and yet the brightness of his beams does in such wise come to us,
as we enjoy his light and heat. But is that as much too say therefore, that we
hold the Sun here beneath? And in good sooth, when as we see, that the Sun
by his power which he sheadeth down hither, cheereth the earth in such wise,
as it bears fruit, and yields sustenance too the nourishment of men: what
shall the incomprehensible

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to bring us so to his lure, that when we know our
sins, we may always give him glory and praise, not doubting but that if he
scourge us, the same is for our welfare and soulehealth. And yet
notwithstanding let us learn too submit our selves so far unto him, as we
may suffer our selves to be brought to nothing in our selves, that we may be
strengthened by his hand, yea and that so strongly and mightily, as we may be
able to withstand all temptations through the power and mean of our Lord
Jesus Christ, so that both in life and death he may always find us obedient
children, according as he shows himself a merciful father toward us.
That it may please him to give this grace not only to us, but, etc.

The.xcviij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxvij. Chapter.
5 God forbid that I should justify you: I will never give over mine
innocence till till I die.

6 I will keep my righteousness, and not forsake it: and my heart shall not
vpbrayde me with my days.

7 Cursed be he that gainsayeth me, and wicked be he that rizeth up against
me.

8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, when he has heaped up, and that
God plucketh away his soul?


AFter that Job had declared his mind concerning that which he had said, and
showed that he had not blasphemed God, but only meant that the afflictions
which befell him me not by reason of his sins, but for some extraordinary
purpose of God which was hidden from men: he protests that he will stand
steadfastly in the same mind. And it behooves us to mark well this dealing:
Gods truth, but only some imagination: it is certain that they be as it
were bewitched by Satan, at leastwise if they be wedded to it, as men say.
Behold the Turks, they be sufficiently hardened in their errors: but ought
that fastness or rather that steelinesse of theirs to be counted a says? No.
And why? For there is no certainty in it. Then behooves it us to understand of
whom we hold our doctrine, that is to wit, that we hold it of God: and we must
be fully persuaded, that it is he which has called us to his schole. Well
then, have we the said certainty? We God forbid that ever I should
instifie you: let us mark also, that it is no small fault before God, to make
countenance of consenting too such as mainteyne an evil case and go against
the truth. For although a man do it not with his heart, but be otherwise
minded in himself: yet God is blasphemed therein, for we know how great store
he sets by his truth. So then, if there be any that maynteyne an evil
case, or set themselves against the truth too deface it, or go about any wicked
God forbid, and that he abhors that cursed might his adversary be. True
it is, that between those two verses there is a third: nevertheless it will
be good too match these two sentences together, Cursed (says he) might
mine adversary be, and wicked be he that ryzeth up against me. First he
shows himself to be full sure of his hold: for he spiteth all such as
shall intend to strive against him, and defieth them as if he were at war
with them. True it is that a harebraynde person will peradventure use the like
stoutnesse, and advance himself against the whole world without shrinking
awhitte. But I have told you before, that Job builded not without laying of a
sure and steadie foundation, but was fully resolved in Gods truth. So then,
whereas he now defyeth all such as would fight against him: he shows that in
such caces there is no playing on both hands, nor no being of neuters to row
between two streams: but we must be either on the one side or on the other,
without fleeting to and fro, and march on in true soundness, saying: is this
Gods case? Then must all of us be advocates in it, and mainteyne it. Have we
conceived any wicked quarrel? Is there any token that the matter is against the
truth? Let us labor to thrust it down, and let it not be suffered. For if we
dissemble, we cannot deny but we be traitors to God. So then we see the
zeal that ought to be in us, not only to confess the truth when we know
it, and to show that we hold it for good: but also to withstand all errors,
and all false and wicked opinions. For it becomes us to be inflamed with such
a stoutnesse, as is showed us here in the person of Job. Then let us mark
well, that when the doctrine of salvation and the things that belong to Gods
service and religion do come in question: we must not only admit that which
we know to be good and true, yea even with a teachable and obedient mind: but
also we must shun all false opinions that are contrary too the truth, and
not liable unto it. I say we must resist them fiercely, and declare that all
such as gainsay us, and agree not with us are wicked and cursed, that is to
say, to be hilde at our hand as enemies of righteousness and truth, because
they refuze too join with us in the obeying of our God, and are become
rebels, and reject the truth. Seeing then that they separate themselves in
that wise from God, and so break the true band of all unity: it behooves us
to have open war with them, and in no wise to agree with them. For as for
them that are desirous to pleasure the wicked, and would feign hold in with
them, and therefore (as the Proverb says) do hold with the hare, and hunte
with the hounde: they show themselves to bear two faces in one hood, and to
play two parts in the Interlude without changing of their apparel. But God
can abide no such counterfeyting. And therefore let us remember well what is
said here: namely that the matter stands not only in saying, I am
contented that such a thing shall pass and I will not strive against the
truth: but if we will show our selves too like well of Gods truth, we must
maynteyne it out of hand, and all such as set themselves against us, must be
our enemies, and we must detest them, assuring our selves that there is no more
agreement between truth and untruth, than between fire and water. Mark then
what we have yet to note. Job adds further, That his heart shall not vpbrayde
him with his days, or that he will not step aside, or that he will not go
back. As touching the Hebrewe word, it may be taken to offer reproach: and it
may also be taken too wexe young again: and thereupon it comes to be taken
to recoyle, or to return back. And this signification agrees very well,
when he says, My heart shall not retire back, as though it wexed young
again. And how? Of my days: that is too say, of all the time of my life that
I have passed. To be short, Job meant to betoken, that he would never swerve:
but like as he had continued unto that day to serve God, yea even in all
soundness: so he would not thenceforth step aside nor run back and become
another man, What is the hope of the Hypocrite (says he) seeing that for all
his heaping up [of goodes] God plucketh away his soul? Here Job protests,
that he is not of opinion, that God punishes not men's sins in this world
or that he is asleep and opens not his eyes, but lets things slip in
such wize here bylowe, as all things universally are turmoyled. All things
(says he) must come to account in the end, howbeit that men perceive not
Gods judgments by eyesight at the first dash. This is in effect the matter
that Job declares here. It behooves us always to bear in mind, what we have
seen What is the hope of the Hypocrite when he shall have heaped up, and God
shall take away his soul? By these words Job signifies, that we must not
enclose man's happiness within his present life. How then may we say that men
are happy or unhappy? we must not have our eyes fastened upon this world (for
that is a very narrow bounds:) but we must go to death: for that is the point
where our Lord shows us, that it is to no purpose for us to have lived here
in ease, to have ho orded up much goods, too have been in honor and credit,
to have crammed our selves with quietness, and (to be short) to have had all
our wishes here. God (I say) shows in death that, all this geere was but as a
flightfull and vanishing shadow. And therefore if we will judge rightly of
men's states, whether they be happy or unhappy: let us not look only too
their living here, or how they be dealt withal for a twenty, thirty, or
fifty years: but let us consider that when men pass hence, God calls them
to him, according as it is said in the ninetith Psalm, that God causes them
to make but one turn as though they ran in a ring, and then come home too me
ye sons of men says he. Mark what we have to conceive in the first
place, to the end we be not overtaken with a false opinion, as all they be
which think no further than upon this present life. For they are ravished
incontinently as soon as they see one that is rich, and they say, he has so
much goods, he has so much of fair lands, there is nothing but triumphing
with him, he is well housed, he has money in his purse: again, such a one is
of great credit, well freended, greatly allied, and another, is counted very
wise, so as every man stoupeth to him. Lo how our eyes shall be dazeled, or
rather seeled up, so as we shall discern no more, when we think no further
but upon this world. And therefore let us bear in mind what is said here,
namely pluck, shows that the death of he down his horns and boweth his
neck to before the yoke, but because our Lord has given him his lesson
without will and without understanding, so as the poor beast has an
inclination to do that which is his duty? And is it not a shameful thing,
that men in the mean while are more stubborn than Oxen, Horses, or Asses? So
then let us learn wherefore God has set us in this* world, and to what
purpose we live here: that is to wit, to the end we should know that we
be set here but as in a journey, and that we be lodged and sustained

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgemente
of our sins, praying him to have pity upon us wretched creatures: and
because we be so loath to follow that which he shows us, that it may please
him to stablish us in such a zeal by his holy Spirit, as we may never
swerve, nor be turned from the right way wherein he shall have once set us. And
for as much as so long as we live in this world, we be inclined, yea and given
up to many vices and imperfections: let us pray him to grant us the grace to
resist them in such wise, as he may be glorified by our confessing of his
name, whyther it be in life or death: and that in the mean while we may be
knitte too him by faith and hope, so as we may persiste therein too the end,
and until he have gathered us into the everlasting heritage which is
purchased for us by our Lord Jesus Christ. That it may please him too
grant this grace not only to us, but also too all people and Nations of the
Earth, bringing back all poor ignorante souls from the miserable bondage of
error and darkness, to the right way of salvation, for the doing whereof, it
may please him to raise, etc.

The.xcix. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxvij. Chapter.
8 What is the hope of the hypocrite when he shall have heaped up, and God
shall have plucked away his Soul?

9 Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?

10 Will he set his delyght on the Almighty? will he call upon God at all
times?

11 I will teach you what is in the hand of God, and I will not conceal
from you what is with the Almighty.

12 Behold, ye have seen all these things, and why do ye vanishe away in
vanity?


WE saw yesterday, that if we will judge of the state of men, we must not
rest upon this present life, but we must go further: for if we look no further
tha^ to the life of man: we shall see that it is but as a shadow, and although
it were granted that he had all his own hearts desire, so as god would give him
whatsoever he would wish: what were all that but That God will not bear the
wicked when they pray, no not even in the mids of their distresses. This
deserves too be well marked. Job shows wherein the chief weal that we
can have or wish to have consists, namely in having recourse unto God, and
that he be merciful to us to succor us at our need. Let us put the case that
a man had all things else that could be imagined, and yet wanted this: surely
all the rest were truth. For they have not the knowledge to say, my God
calls me and allureth me to him, and I shall not be disappoynted in coming to
him. Seeing it is his pleasure to reckon me in the number of his children: I
will go to him, not upon a foolish rashness and presumption, but with
obedience to the voice of my God, trusting to his promise. The hypocrites
cannot speak that language: and therefore they have no truth in them. For it
stands them in hand to have faith, and faith depends upon Gods promises,
which the ungodly never tasted of. Again, we ought VVben trouble comes upon
the hypocrite: because that then we know and feel how auaylable our prayers
are, and what fruit they yield us. True it is that God shows his goodness
that the ungodly will not delighte in the Almighty, nor seek always unto
him. When he says that the wicked man will not seek always unto God: it is
a confirmation of that which has been touched already: that is to wit, that
we must not only pray when we can none otherwise do: but also that we must do
it ordinarily, as in very deed we cannot pass one minute of an hour without
Gods help. And surely the favor that we look for at his hand, consists
not only in delivering from death when we be as good as at the pits brim: but
also in preserving us and in turning away evil from us. For we see that in
this life we be continually beseeged with a hundred deaths, and the miseries
wheretoo we be subject, are without number. God therefore must be feign to
guard us, and to be our wall and bulwark, according also as he says by his
Prophet Esaias, that he is our fortress and shield, and so is he also named
oftentimes in the Psalms. Ye see then how we ought to call upon God, not
only when he touches us, and smites as it were with hard strokes upon us:
but even when we be at our ease and rest, and perceive no danger toward:
even then (say I) behooves it us nevertheless to consider, to how many
miseries our life is subject: that being persuaded that we can not escape
them except God preserve us, we may run unto him and say, Alas Lord, keep
us thou under thy protection, and by thy providence make us able too pass
through so many deaths which hem us in round about. And this must be done
both evening and morning. Moreover we know: (without going any further) what
temptations assail us daily. And therefore when we pray unto God, it must not
only be that he should preserve us from the dangers wherein we are concerning
this present life: but the chief point is, that he should reach out his hand
to deliver us from Satan's temptations, and not suffer us too fall into evil,
that the wicked prays not at all times unto God. But there is yet one point
more which we ought to mark well. For Jobs intent is to do us to wit, that
whereas the wicked man does now and then make countenance to pray, yet does
he not continue in that mind, he proceeds not constantly and after one
continual rate. And here ye see wherein that the wicked man will not set his
delight in God, which is a notable saying, and contains a good lesson. For
here Job puts a difference betwixt the pleasure or joy that Gods children
and the faithful sort have: and the pleasure which the faithless take. Hereby
we understand, that all skorners of God, all malicious persons, and all looce
livers, (although they seem to be the happiest folk in the whole world) are
unhappy, and there is nothing but wretchedness in them. On the contrary
part, although the children of God be taken to be forlorn, wretched, and as
it were damned creatures: yet are they right happy because they set their
delight in God. Thus see we a sentence right worthy to be well marked, and to
be called of ten times too rememberance. There is none of us but he desires
to have joy: and yet in the mean while we know not what the true joy is,
nor wherein we ought to take it, nor wherevntoo we ought to refer it. And
that is the cause why the joy of this world is cursed by the mouth of Gods
own son, who says: woe be to you that laughe. And why? Will God have us to
be always sad? Is God grieved and offended that we should make any mirth? To
what purpose serve the texts where it is said that God would feign have men to
be merry, and gives them wherewith to be merry? For he not only voutsafeth
too give them nurrishmente and sustenance: but also gives them abundance
wherewith to be merry. How commes it to pass then, that our Lord Jesus
Christ curses the laughter of the world? It is because men besotte themselves
in their mirth. And what is their joy? It is a clean forgetting of themselves,
and a turning away from God, according as we see that most men cannot be
merry, unless they thruste God a good way off, and run riot, and give
themselves to such superfluity, as there remains no more wit nor reason in
them. For somuche then as men do so pass their bounds, needs must their mirth
be cursed. To bring examples hereof is needelesse as now: would God the thing
were not so much known and practiced as it is. But what? There is not that man
of us all, that finds That he will teach them what is in the band of God,
and what is with the Almighty. Yea and he adds, that his friends were very
vnwittie, since that they had seen all those things, and yet nevertheless did
speak so aukly, according as we have seen before. But Job has already put a
sufficient difference betwyxte Gods children and the unbelievers, showing that
we ought not to deem any man's life unhappy for the outward show that
appears for a day or twain, or for a little time: but that we must enter
innermore, and search what is in the heart, yea and we must come to the hope
that is in them at their death, and look whither while they may live here,
they be joined unto God, and call upon him and flee to him for refuge, and
yield themselves wholly to him, and rejoice in his goodness: and whither that
at their death they be able too commit themselves too his keeping, and to
betake their souls to him, believing that they be safe when they be in his
hand. For these are they that are happy. Contrariwise, such as are esteemed
to be honorable, such as are in authority, such as live in delight and
pleasure: such are always unhappy, because they separate themselves

But now let us fall down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgemente of our sins, praying him to humble us in such wise, as we
may have our recourse unto him only, and that forasmuch as it pleases him to
handle us so gently, and to make us feel his goodness so many ways, to the
end we might be moved to come unto him: he will not suffer us to gad after
our own delights and lusts, but that when he has once brought us into the
right way, we may never be turned out of it, so as we may always go forward
more and more, till we be come to the heavenly heritage whereunto he calls
us. And so let us say, Almighty God our heavenly father we acknowledge and
confess according to the truth, that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to
Heaven, to present our selves before thee, nor to presume so far as that our
prayers should be, etc.

The.C. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxvij. Chapter.
13 Behold what the portion of the wicked is with God, and the heritage that
the extortioners receive of the Almighty.

14 If his children be multiplied, they shall be put to the svvorde, and his
offpring shall not be satisfied with bread.

15 Their remnant shall be buried in destruction, and their widow shall not
weep.

16 Though they heap up silver as duste, and gold as clay.

17 The righteouse shall cloth himself with it, and the innocent shall divide
his silver.

18 He shall build his house as a moth, and as a watchman makes his lodge.

19 When the rich man sleeps, he shall not gather aught: he shall open his
eyes and nothing shall appear.


IT should seem at the first blushe, that Job speaks another language here
than he had done before, and that he says and vnsaies, and agrees with his
counterparties: nevertheless we have seen already that his meening their
portion and heritage with him. Hereby we understand, that if men escape
unpunished here below, and no man takes vengeance of their misdeedes, and of
the outrages and extortions that they have committed: God who is above will not
miss them. Therefore at length they shall come to their account, and that
shall be as their portion or heritage. For although they be not punished at
the first day, yet will God work in the end. According too that which I have
declared already, I say, we must not make it a general rule, but yet shall
it fall out so oftentimes. Then let us learn to have an eye unto God in all
our life, and let us not think our selves discharged when we be escaped the
hands of men, another let us flatter ourselves thereupon, as though we had
made a fair hand: but let us have an eye to this heritage which God tells
us that he has prepared for such as have lived amiss. Like as the son and
heir of a man shall not possess his fathers goods and lands at the first
day, but shall be owner and master of them in time: so on the contrary part
God punishes not the wicked sort incontinently when they have offended: but
yet is their possession kept for them in the end, and shall be reserved
certainly for them, as an heritage whereof they cannot be disfeated. Mark
that for one point. And now it is said, That if their children be multiplied,
they shall go to the sword, and their of spring shall be overthrown, so as
it shall be buried in destruction without any remedy. By these sayings we
understand, that God not only punishes the wicked and the despisers of his
majesty in their own persons: but also extends the same vengeance even
unto their children. Truly we will think this strange to our own
understanding. But it has been declared already heretofore, that God may
punish the children of the wicked, without doing them wrong. And why? For we
are all cursed in Adam, and bring nothing but damnation with us out of our
mothers womb. Now then if God leave us in our own state, all of us both
great and small are already appointed to destruction. If God should rend up
the whole world and plunge it into the bottomless pit: might he be accused of
cruelty? No: For his gentle handling of us comes of his own mere
goodness, and not of any deserte of ours. Then if he withdraw his grace
from the offspring of the wicked, and to punish the fathers, do wrap their
children in the like destruction, so that for so much as the father has run
further and further into wickedness, his children must be feign to fill up the
we know that the same is for their welfare. For by that mean he intends to
inure them too patience, or too take away the occasion of falling asleep
here bylowe, or else (to be short) he minds as it were too minister some
purgation to them or to let them blood, because he sees well that the
abundance which they possess, would be as a noy some superfluity to them.
When a surgion lets a man blood: it seems to be to his hurt, and in
very deed it is the selfsame way whereby a thief murthereth a man: but yet
the letting of him blood by the that when the wicked man shall have heaped up
gold as dust, (as of treasure, apparel, household stuff and such other
things, and also of Land) the rightuouse shall cloth himself with it. This
may come to pass many a time and often, and when it happens, we must not
be blind so as we should not in the world. For they must be feign to pay a
dear shot for the goods that they have crammed up in this world, for their
sotting of them selves in all ryottousnesse, for abusing of his gentleness and
patience, and for mocking at him, and at his doctrine, and at all religion. So
then the last punishment which God denounces against the wicked, can not
miss them. But yet in this world it may welynough fall out that they shall not
be punished at the first dashe, at leastwise that we can perceive. Now let us
come to that which Job says. The wicked (says he) shall heap up money as
dust. For God to show his vengeance the better, suffers the wicked to enrich
themselves after such a sort, as they seem to be Seagulfes that swallow up
all the goods of the world. And certesse if a wicked man should never prosper:
men should not perceive the punishmente that is spoken of here, namely that
when he is grown rich, and has gathered much: yet he can not afterward enjoy
it. If a man should ask those that take such pain to heap up riches, what
their intent is: O (say they) I can not tell what may befall me: for That the
wicked man shall build his house as a moth, and that it shall he as a
watchmans Caban, even such a watchmans Caban as watches the Vyneyardes. When
the unbelievers and the despizers of God do buyld, they bear themselves in
hand that they shall dwell in them a thousand years after their death. For does
not the stateliness that is seen in the buildings that are made by the
despizers of God, show that they imagine an immortality in this world? They
bear themselves in hand, that they shall prolong their life by their Palaces.
When a man has builded his house to continue for a thousand years, he
believes that his house is tied to him, and that he shall by that means be
renoumed. But God scorneth such ouerwening. For this cause Job compares the
houses of wicked men, too the houses of mothes. How so? The moth marreth and
wastes all things, to make himself a lodging: he eats cloth, he eats
furre, he eats all that he finds, and to be short, where so ever a moth
lodges, it is always too another bodies cost and hinderance, and yet
notwithstanding there is nothing but corcuption and vermin in his lodging.
When a vinekeeper makes his Caban to watch the vineyardes, it is but for
three months: for as soon as the vinetage is done, down goes the Caban: and
although no man set hand to it, yet it falls down of it self. Even so it
is said here, that the wicked men do make them stately houses, and bear them
selves in hand that when they have builded after that manner, they shall dwell
in them for ever. But what? What are they themselves? Even as a moth, that is
to say, they have nothing but corruption, and that must they be said to carry
with them continually. Seeing it is so: surely their houses will not continue
long. True it is that they shall make a great show for a time: but in the end
God will beat down their houses, so as they shall not abide in them any long
while. Thus see ye a notable judgment that God executes upon those that will
make such estimation of the^ selves in this world. And for as much as we see
examples thereof: we ought too mark them well, and thereby learn, not to
nestle out selves in this world, nor to build by guile, wrong, and extortion.
Let our building be according to the goods that God has given us. And let not
such as are well housed, besot them selves in their own lusts to nestle
themselves here. For let men nestle themselves upon earth as much as they list.
and yet shall it not bar God from plucking them away. Then let us keep our
selves well from making our nest here bylowe: according as it will be said in
the nine and twentieth Chapter, that Job made his reckning that his state should
never change. But men beguile them selves in behighting them selves such
euerlastingnesse, and God also laugheth their fond presumption to scorn. And
therefore if the godly be lodged after their own mind, yet let them count
them selves as strangers in this world, and let them be always ready to
part hence whenever it shall please God. And if they have not the commodities
that were to be wished: yet let them go for ward still, and learn to know
that God aduertizeth them by eyesight, that this is not the place where they
must abide, but that it behooves them to pass further. Thus then ye see what
we have to remember when we perceive that our Lord will not have men too set
their minds upon the things That the wicked man shall die, and not be buried
honorably, and that he shall open his eyes, and see nothing. This serves too
conclude the matter that has been treated of: for Job meeneth, that it may
well come to pass (and so it does indeed) that the wicked shall stumble, yea
even after he has been advanced. For the thing whereat he looks, is that
our Lord exalts the wicked, and afterward lets them fall, yea even a
deadly fall. For as touching to himself till the latter day. As much is to be
said when we see good men burned, and put to open shame, and Gods children
perish with the wicked, yea as touching the body, so as they be carried to
the gallows. For although they be the martyrs of Jesus christ, and that that
slander be more honor to them before God, than all the preserments in the
world: yet not withstanding, God gives them not buri^all. And how comes
that too pass? How falls out the threatenings against the wicked, that is
spoken of here? It behooves us to come back

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us feel them more and more, that we may
be sorry for them in such wise, as we may desire nothing but to be governed
by his holy spirit: and therewithal let us beseech him humbly, too
vouchsafe to use his infinite mercy toward us, in releasing the offenses
whereby we be bound before his judgment, and that we may so pass through the
world, as we may not be wedded to worldly things, but stablished in faith and
hope, until our Lord have called us into his Kingdom, where we shall fully
see the things of which we know but a small portion as now: and that in the
mean while we may be strengthened against all the stumbling blocks of the
world, and never cease to give glory to our God, notwithstanding that
ourfleshly reason comprehend not the huge depthes that are in his works. That
it may please him to grant this grace not only to us, etc.

The.Cj. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xxvij. Chapter. and the first upon
the.xxviij. Chapter.
19 When the rich man sleeps he shall not gather ought: he shall open his
eyes and nothing shall be seen.

20 Troubles shall come upon him as water, and a tempest shall carry him away
by night.

21 The East vvinde shall bear him away, and he shall be gone, and it shall
hurl out his place like avvhirle vvind.

22 He shall rush in upon him, and not spare him, he shall flee from his hand.

23 Men shall clappe their hands together against him, and hiss at him out of
their place.


The.xxviij. Chapter. Silver has his spring, and gold has a place to grovve
in.

2 Iron is taken out of the earth: and Brass is molten out of the stone.

3 God has set an end unto darkness, and unto all things that tend unto
end, the bounds of darkness, and the shadovve of death.

4 He ouerflovveth the river against the inhabiter, the waters are forgotten
of the foot, and when they have risen above a man, they sink again.

5 Out of one self same earth comes bread, and under it there is a change
as it were fire.

6 There is a place where of the stones are Sapphires, and the moulde is gold.

7 No bird has known the way of it, neither has the eye of the kyte seen
it.

8 The Lions vvhelpes have not vvalked there, neither has the Lion passed by
it.

9 He lays his hand upon the rock, and turns up the mountains by the
roots.


ACcording to yesterdayes talk, it is said here, that the rich man shall
open his eyes and find nothing. Whereby it is meant that the rich men shall be
safe for a time, and think that they shall never want any thing. But in the
end all shall be hidden from them, and there shall be no more hope for them:
they shall awake and seek succoure, but not it, knowing that our life is
subject to so many chaunges, as you would wonder to see it. Therefore let us
watch in calling upon God, let us watch that we rest not upon the things that
we have in our own hands, let us watch to know that we have need to be
succored many ways: and by that mean let us learn to return unto God, and to
settle and ground our selves upon his only providence and goodness. This is
the warning which we ought to gather of this sentence. But this is not seen
always. Therefore (as I said) let us learn, not to make a general be shall
open his eyes or look about) not to the rich men, that fearfulness shall
overtake the wicked man as a rage of water. He speaks here of waters: but he
meeneth, that it is as a sudden storm, when a tempest or a whirle wind
comes by night. As this judgment of God is common, so it is also notable:
that is to wit, That fearfulness shall come upon them as a rage of water:
according also to the saying of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians, that when
they shall say peace and all is safe: then shall they be suddenly overthrown,
and the destruction which they thought not of, nor once doubted, shall come
upon them. So then when there is any talk of such alteration which God
sends upon the wicked, (which is that he destroieth them suddenly, as if he
sent a storm or tempest in the night:) let us learn, not to be so sotted in
foolish presumption, as to think that God will let us alone in rest: neither
let us flatter our selves, but rather let us know that our Lord intends to
keep us under in lowlynesse, to the end we should have our minds the freer
too come unto him, and not be drawn away by the vanities of this world, but
rather be provoked too give our selves wholly unto him. Ye see then how it
behooves us to seek peace in God, and not in worldly goods. If we do so,
let us not be afraid that we should be overthrown with any sudden
tempest, or that God will send any such fearfulness upon us, as shall
trouble us: but contrariwise, all such as presume upon their earthly
prosperity, must be feign to feel the hand of God: And although not in this
world, yet in the world to come, they must be feign to come to an account: and
the^ can they not escape the hand of the heavenly Judge. Wherefore let us walk
advisedly. Furthermore, though the wicked be now and then without fear, let
us not think that God has forgotten their wickedness: for we do not
always perceive his judgments presently, as I have said. Therefore it
behooves us too tarry for the discovery of them, until the last day:
assuring our selves, that God will sometimes try our faith, by holding his
hand as it were hidden from us. And further, it behooves us to note, that
although the fear which God sends upon the wicked, and upon the despyzers
of his word, be not perceived here: yet notwithstanding, they feel a
secret fear continually in their hearts, as it is said by the Prophet
Esaias, That there is no peace for the wicked, but that they are like the waves
that beat one against an other. So long as there is any violent wind, we
see the water is so turmoyled, that the waves break one against an other. Even
so the wicked (without trouble at other men's hands) do torment themselves,
and are hangmen too them selves in all their thoughts and affections. They
shall quake at the falling of a leaf when no body follows them. But this
fearfulness shall be secret: for outwardly they set a good countenance upon
the matter, and also they know not them selves, but are dulled in them selves,
and chafe at God, and admit not the warnings that he gives them to move them
to repentance. Therefore let us learn to seek this peace that I have spoken
of, which is too have a good and pure conscience* so as we lean unto God and
call upon him. And then although he send us troubles: yet shall we not be so
utterly overthrown, but we shall have whereof to rejoice in his goodness. But
it is said, finally, that they shall be carried away by the East wind, driven
out of their place, and over whelmed with miseries, and shall flee away. These
similitudes of the Eastwinde and of VVhirlewinds are added, all to one purpose.
For in respect of the country of Iewrie, their Eastern wind was
boystousest, as all the holy Scripture shows. And so it is meant, that when
the That every man shall clappe his hands, when he sees the wicked after
that fashion, and every man shall hiss at them in the way of scorn and
mockeris, out of his place. That is to say, the poor folk that had been
oppressed before, and durst not show them selves abroad in the streats, because
of these Robbers that fleeced them, and were ready to eat them up, shall
rejoice when our Lord does after that manner destroy such as had been in
credit and authority, in so much that they shall clappe their hands, and
mock at the pride and ouerweening that is in such despizers of God. Here it
might be demanded, whether it be lawful for the good and faithful, to be
glad when they see the fall of the wicked. This were a superfluous question in
this place, because it is not told us that it is lawful so to do: but only
barely showed us, that the world is glad of it, according also as it is seen
by experience, that when the pillars and pollers that have molested all men
as well great and small, do die, and are beaten down by the hand of God: it is
a thing that all men rejoice at. And why? For they have been the enemies of the
world. But yet we must mark this caveat, that if our rejoicing were not
fleshly, ne proceeded of a desire too revenge, it were good and holy, and
allowable before God. But if we be provoked to rejoice through aduengement,
or through fleshly affection: then is our gladness cursed, and to be
condemned. And so when men are moved by their passions, whether it be to
gladness or to sorrow: surely their joy, or their sorrow is commonly
sinful. Wherefore if a man will rejoice at the fall of the wicked, he must not
do it upon any fleshly desire, but only in allowing Gods justice, and in
agreeing to that which he shows: and yet in the mean while he must always
be established and grounded more and more in his fear and love, and also have
good government of his own affections. Thus you see that it may be lawful
for us to rejoice in the destruction of the wicked. But let us take good heed
that we be not stirred thereunto by our fleshly affections, ne intermeddle
any thing of our own. Yet notwithstanding as touching this present text, let
us mark how it is showed us here, that the wicked which are full of
ambition and vayneglorie, and seek to have the estimation of the whole world,
must needs become loathsome, and God will bring them so into hatred, that
every man shall rejoice at their destruction. Ye see then that they shall be
disappoynted of their expectation. Although this happen not at all times: yet
let not us think that our Lord has therefore forgotten his duty, but let us
tarry for the revelation which is promised us at the last day. And here ye
see why Job declares many of the secrets of nature that are seen in the
world, and therevppon concludes, that if a man had the understanding of all
the things that are hidden, yet notwithstanding, Gods wisdom, surmounteth
and is far higher. Some take this as though it were said: things change in
this world, and we see no continuance in the order of nature: for where
fruitful feeldes have been, that have borne good corn, there men see
fire: that is too say, barreynnesse. And where a man would have thought there
had been but gravel or sand, there oftentimes has been Gold, and
precious stones. We see them many chaunges in the world, as it is said in the
hundred and seventh Psalm. That is the matter which the Prophet treats of
there, showing that by reason of men's sins, the earth becomes barreine, in
so much that it seems that men have sown salt there: And the places that
were well inhabited, become deserte, so as men are constreyned to eschew them
for famine, and for the heat and cold, which grieve them in such wise as
they wot not where to become: And also that God with his goodness, ouergoing
the naughtiness of man, that God has bounded the darkness. Ye see how
darkness hides all things. In the day time men may discern white and black
asunder: but when night comes, behold, all things are defaced, our senses
fail us, we discern not a man from a stone, we discern not a house from a
hill. But yet for all this, the darkness which bereeueth men after that
sort of their sight and discerning, is bounded, and God sets it a stinte in
the end. Hereby Job meeneth, that although there be a great diversity of
things in the world, yea even unto the very darkness that hydeth away the
sight of all things: yet notwithstanding men do go through with them: for
anon after, God sends light, and the darkness continues not for ever. And
here we have a good and very profitable lesson: which is, that man's reason
may have some ability to understand and judge of these lower things, which
concern the present transitory life: but as concerning the things that are
heavenly, and belong too the kingdom of God, and as concerning his judgment:
all those things are hidden from us. I said that this doctrine will be very
profitable, yea verily if it be well understood as it ought to be. Truly there
are many even of the smallest and lowest things which we cannot conceive,
except God give us ability: according as we see how there are many simple
idiotes (as men term them) which know no more than brute beasts. Such manner
of folk are set of God before our eyes as looking glasses, too humble us
withal. When we see a stark idiot that has no wit nor reason, it behooves
us to look well upon him, for he is a mirror of our nature. Whence comes the
reason and Nature barreth it not from being Gods gift, but serves to do us to
understand that the thing is given to the unbelievers also, and to those whom
God has not forgotten again by his holy Ghost, who is named the spirit of
adoption, because he is the mark that God imprinteth upon his children. So
then, although we have not the holy Ghost, to be regenerated, and to have the
earnest penny and pledge of the hoped salvation, yet may we well have
understanding. For it is a common thing both to the believers and unbelievers,
to judge of the things that to pass, that the craftiest and such as take
themselves to be peerlesse in policy, are destitute of all reason, and put to
the soil, according as the Scripture says, that God catches the wise in
their own wiliness, as in a pitfall. We see this. And how is it possible
that a man which was so well advised, should as now be so overtaken, and
dazeled in so small a matter: Has he not wit in him? Verily as though God were
not in heaven, to blind such as think themselves too see clearly, and trust
in their own skyll and wisdom. It stands him in hand too punish such

And now let us fall down before the face of our good God with
acknowledgement of our sins, praying him too make us feel them better than
we have done, that in beholding his judgments, we may always be provoked to
walk the more in his fear: and that when we have profited in sound
understanding, it may please him to make us go forward more and more, so as
we may not hereafter be wrapped in the utter destruction which is prepared
for the wicked that are hardened and stubborn against him, but that by
correcting our vices, we may prevent his judgment, and obtain grace and
mercy: and that after he has afflicted us in this world, he may give us the
rest that he has promised too those which are his: that is to wit, that
being delivered from all the miseries which we have to endure in this world,
we may be gathered up into his heavenly glory, to be made partakers of all
his goods, and to be reformed to his Image in true perfection. That it may
please him too grant this grace, not only to us, but also too all people and
Nations of the earth, etc.

The.Cij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxviij. Chapter.
10 He cutteth the rivers in the Rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.

11 He binds the Rivers that they ouerflovv not, and brings to light the
things that are hidden.

12 But where is wisdom found, and where is the place of understanding?

13 Man knovveth not the value of it, neither is it found in the land of the
living.

14 The depth says, it is not in me: and the sea says it is not with me.

15 The fine Gold shall not be given for it, neither shall Silver be vveyed
for the exchange of it.

16 It shall not be valued with the wedge of Gold, nor with the precious
Onix, nor with the Saphyre.

17 Gold and Crystal shall not match it, neither shall it be exchaunged for
plate of fine Gold.

18 There shall no mention be made of Coral, nor of Gabish: VVisdome is more
vvorth than Pearls.

19 The Topas of Aethyop shall not be made equal with her, neither shall she
be pryzed with the wedge of clean Gold.

20 Whence then comes wisdom? Or where is the place of understanding?

21 It is hid from the eyes of all that live, yea and it is hid from the fowls
of the air.

22 Destruction and death say, we have heard the renoume of her with our ears.

23 God knovveth the way of wisdom, he can tell where her place is.

24 He beholds the ends of the world, and sees all that is under heaven.

25 It is he that has vveyed the vvindes, and measured the waters.

26 Which has set a law upon the rain, and appointed the way of the roaring
tempests.

27 Then did he see it and know it, he dispozed and ordained it.

28 And has said unto man, the fear of the Lord is vvisdome, and to eschew
evil, is understanding.


IHaue declared already what Jobs intent is here, and what he meeneth by the
word VVisdome. His intent is to show, that men are too far ouerseene when
they will comprehend all Gods secrets, and be ignorant in nothing. And that
we may know It is not to be found (says he) among men alive or dead. True
it is that many may take upon them too be wise, and also brag that they
carry wisdom in their selves: but yet for all that, that a man cannot find an
equal thing to exchange for it. Let a man heap up both Gold and Silver: Let
them gather together al precious stones: and all this shall not match it. So
then we see in effect, that Jobs meening here, is to humble us, to the end we
should not think our selves able too comprehend Gods secrets: but rather
should willingly be ignorant of the things that pass our capacity. And
furthermore if we intend too know what is meet for us, let us desire God
too show it us by his holy spirit: for too that point must we come. By the
way also let us come too the conclusion that is set down here: that God has
all wisdom in himself, as he has well showed, if it were but in the
creation of the world, when he ordained the counterpeysing both of the winds
and of the water. Therefore like as only God has all wisdom in himself,
and is the welspring thereof: So also has he ordained men to be wise, by
fearing and serving him. We see then in Jobs conclusion, that the wisdom of
men, is not to be inquisitiue too know all things through fond curiosity:
but too keep themselves within their bounds, and to know that it behooves
them too serve God, and to submit themselves unto him. That is the true
wisdom, and there must men hold themselves as it were brideled and at a
stay. Thus much concerning the letter of this sentence.

Now let us consider how we may profit our selves by it. And first of
all let us mark well, that when he says, that wisdom is not too be
found among the living. It is always too admonish men, that they may not
trust too their own reason, nor attribute so sharp and subtle wit too
themselves, as too comprehend the reason of Gods works. And this
admonishment is very needful considering the pride that is in us. For if we
be so proud and presumptuous in natural things: much more do we
ouershoote our selves in other things, so as every one of us takes himself
too be so witty as nothing may escape him: and we contend not any more who
shall bear the bell amongst us, or who shall be wiser than his fellows: but
we fight against God, which is a horrible thing, and yet we be so mad, that
we do it. For proof whereof, it men trusted not too much to their own wit: we
should not have so much ado to bring the world in order: For both great and
small do mount up intoo such presumption, as there are very few that yield
themselves pliable unto God too suffer themselves to be governed by him. But
specially when God intends to teach us, the vnskilfullest, yea I say the that
wisdom is not to be found among men. Job (or rather the holy Ghost by Jobs
mouth) meeneth here in effect to beat down all the loftiness that is in us,
when we imagine our selves too that wisdom is not purchased with Gold nor
Silver, nor precious stones. And that is to bereue men of all their vain
presumption: for if a man be rich, he thinks himself a huge and meruaylous
man, and utterly forgets himself, because he is esteemed of other men. And
so Job shows, that whatsoever excellency That God has seen, had, and
disposed wisdom from the creation of the world, and afterward has said to
man, Behold, how you shall become wise, that is to say, by fearing me. Here
Job compares God with us, because it is impossible to abate or tame our pride
otherwise than by force. And the only mean of that is by bringing us to God:
for men may well enough show us the infirmity and rudeness of our wit: but
yet will we ever draw back, nor never come to that point, nor cease to keep
still some pride in secret. Although then we be convinced that our wit is so
weak as is pity to see it: yet notwithstanding we will not give over this
foolish opinion that we have of being wise. But when we be brought unto God,
then are we driven to know that we are nothing, and that we must not deceive
our selves by our own selfeweening. See how Job sets God before us here:
and to the end we should know the wisdom that is in him alone, he sets
the creation of the world before our eyes. Well says he, are men so sharp
witted, as to comprehend all Gods secrets, as how he disposes the order of
nature, and how he has as it were weyed the winds and waters, and other
things? True it is as I have said, that the Philosophers have well conceived
the reason of the things that are seen in this world. But if men come to the
Creation, it is so wonderful a thing, as they must needs be abashed, and
reverence the infinite wisdom of God, and confess themselves unable to
comprehend it. Thus ye see Jobs meening in this sentence. And thereupon he
shows us that we must thoroughly believe, that our wisdom consists not in
searching, examining, and seeking out of all things: But in knowing that which
is profitable for us according too Gods ordinance. Behold here an excellent
sentence. For it is all one as if it were said, that Gods secrets are known
to none but himself, and that no body is of counsel with him, as it is said
in other texts of the Scripture: and therefore that we must not presume, to
enter into his secret determination, nor to know more of him than is lawful
for us, but must learn only what pleases him too show us in his school,
and assure our selves that all our wisdom is there. And this is the cause why
I said that this is an excellent sentence. And why? For there are two vices in
me^ that God has spoken it unto men, is of great weight. For it is all one as
if he should say, that God intended to cut men off from all occasion of
searching his secrets and determinations, further forth than he shows them,
and therewithal declares that the doctrine which he will have men to learn in
his school, is profitable to edify them in holy life, that they might learn
to submit themselves unto him that created and formed them, and walk in his
obedience. Thus ye see the wisdom that God has ordained for us. To be
short, Job in setting the fear of God before us as our whole wisdom:
meeneth that our Lord plucketh us back from that which we have most mind
unto: that is, from our vain speculations which can serve us to no purpose,
but to puff us up with foolish vaineglory to have the said windy knowledge
which will make us presume over far, nor yet has no profit nor instruction in
it. Job then has set those two things one against another, one on the one
side, and an other on the other, saying: will men be wise, they must not make
themselves wise after the manner of God. Behold, God has all perfection of
wisdom in him, the nearer we preace unto him, the more shall we be
confounded: for it is not for us to make our selves like unto God in wisdom,
but rather to submit our selves unto him. Lo what our wisdom is. We see
what happened to our father Adam and our mother Eve: for God was not so
niggardly as not themselves to be taught by god. But yet for all this, the vice
that God finds fault withal in this text of Salomons, is ouercommon and
ordinary: that is to wit, that when he sends this treasure of wisdom
which ought to be common too all men, knocking at their gates, and bidding
them to the feast: every man does rather shrink away, tha^ draw nearer.
Furthermore, as God in that place accuses and condemns men for their beastly
carelessness and unthankfulness: so shows he all the faithful, how greatly
they ought to esteem to be taught of him: to know his will in such wise as
is contained in the holy Scripture. And therewithal let us not be so
thanklesse, as to reject the benefit that he minds to bestow upon us and
offers unto us: but let us be atte^tiue, and endeavor to put away all our
evil affections, and suffer our selves to be so taught of God, as we may be
edified by the things that he shows us, and profit in them more and more,
and be desirous too be stablished in them all the time of our life.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good

The.Ciij. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxviij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the former text.

I Have told you already that Jobs intent was, to show men that they ought
to hold themselves in such sobriety, as not too covet too know more than God
permits the^: and also that they must not run gadding astray, but follow
the way which is poynted to them. For this cause Job sets a difference
between God and us, and shows that it is no reason that a mortal man
should presume too seek the things that that God has said to man. For it
serves to show that it is not lawful for us to know more than is given us
from above. And furthermore let us mark well the grace that God grants us
above other creatures. For where as Job says expressly, that God turned
himself unto men to give them some wisdom by measure: therein he shows,
that we be not like brute beasts that live without discretion, but that God
has given us an excellent privilege, which is that we should have
understanding Mitte arcana Dei: the meening whereof is, that they must not
inquire of Gods secrets. See how men do retch their bounds continually, and
cannot keep a good mean. Therefore let us remember how it is contained in this
streyne, that God says expressly unto men, This is the wisdom. Job then
magnifieth this knowledge which God has given us in separating us from other
creatures: according as it is said in the first chapter of S. John, that we not
only have life to eat and drink* and to exercise our body: but also that we
have the light of understanding. And for as much as this benefit deserves to
be magnified: let us take good heed that we be not deprived and bereft of it
through our own unthankfulness. When God opens our eyes, and we shut
them, are we not worthy to be blamed as peruerters of the order of nature?
when God gives us discretion too know good from evil, and sets us here to
behold his works, to the end we should approach unto him, and be parttakers
of his image in respect that we be reasonable creatures: if we defile all
this, and will not know any thing: is it not a manifest fighting against God,
and an utter renouncing of the benefit which he would bestow upon us, yea,
and of such a benefit as is most principal and highliest to be esteemed of al
others? ye see then in effect two things which we ought to bear in mind. The
one is that this is the wisdom, he spoke purposely unto them? Why spoke he
not also unto other creatures? Because he listed not to do them the like honor
that he has done to us, not to advance the^ to so high degree. And therefore
(as I said) all they which pass not to profit in wisdom while they live, do
well show that they go about to withdraw fearing of God. It is our wisdom
to fear God. It seems here, that Job restrains ma^s wisdom to much,
when he incloseth it wholly within the fear of God: for we know that our Lord
teaches us other things also in his word. But yet so it is, that our whole
wisdom is to harken unto God when he speaks, and to bear in mind
whatsoever he says, and not to make ourselves wilfully deaf: but to have
our eyes and ears open when that our wisdom is too fear God. But we must
briefly mark So then we see now what is the meening of this text: Namely
that such as are edified to fear and obey God, are men of right
understanding: and that the same is the thing whereupon we must set our
minds, and not upon wandering speculatio^s: this will be the easier to
understand, if we add one other goodly text of the Prophet Esaias in the.33.
chapter: There he speaks of the true reformation of the Church, that was
before the scattering and destruction thereof. Therefore he says, that the
things which were seen to be turned vpside down as then, should Treasure,
he shows that that is the thing whereupon men must wholly settle
themselves, as upon their full and perfect felicity, and wherein they must
take their full contentation and rest. Now we see that the thing which is
spoken here, is very true, that is to wit, that men shall then be wise and
skillful, when they shall have profited so far as to walk in obedience to
God, and in holiness of life. And furthermore let us come back to that
which has been touched already: that is to wit, that therewithal we must
apply our whole study, and set our whole mind, upon the things that are
conteyued in the holy Scripture, because there is nothing there which is not
for our profit. And surely it is impossible to fear God and to give our
selves to his service, unless we be acquaynted with his goodness: according
as it is said in the hundred and thirtith Psalm, Lord thou art good, and
there is mercy with thee, too the end that men should fear thee. We see
then that men can not be grounded in the fear of God, until they have known
Gods mercy, and taken hold of it, to the end to come to him with a free
heart and too seek him. For so long as we shun God, we are fierce against
him, and consequently rebels. But men shall never conceive a right taste of
his goodness, except they be taught it by the Scripture. And that also is the
place where true fear is. For we must not think that under this word
Fear, the Scripture meeneth only some bondage that men should yield unto
God, as though they were enforced thereunto. But this fear here imports,
that we must be fully minded to suffer ourselves to be governed by gods
hand, and above all things know what his goodness and mercy is, and yield
him such reverence as we may be truly joined unto him. And undoubtedly, when
he speaks of the honor that belongs unto him, he not only alleges his
majesty, nor only says that he is master and Lord: but therewithal also
says that he is a father. For he cries out by his Prophet Malachie, If I be
your master, where is your fear? And if I be your father, where is your
love? True it is that in that place he puts a difference between love and
fear. But afterward he shows that those two words come both to one
end: that is to wit, that forasmuch as we ought to acknowledge him both as a
father and a master: we ought to love him, howbeeit with such reverence as in
all our life we desire nothing, ne seek nothing but to obey him. So then we
see now, that Job is so far off here from intending to reject faith: that
he rather leads us unto it. For that also is the point whereat we must
begin too walk in the fear of our God. And this is the cause why Saint
Paul (when he speaks of wisdom) prays God to open the eyes of the
Ephesians, too the end they may know how to hope for the salvation that God
has prepared for them in Heaven by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
And afterward in the third chapter he says, that it behooves us to know the
kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love that he has showed to assure
us of our salvation: insomuche that he is our length, breadth, heyghth, and
depth. As if he should say, we might well streyne our selves on all sides,
but if we would mount up never so high, we could not be able to go beyond the
co^prehending of the love which has bin showed in the person of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Also we may well seek all depths, but yet we must hold this for
a certainty, that when we have gone to and fro, all that ever it behooves us
to know, is but to conceive how God shows himself a father and savior,
according as he has adopted us in the person of his Son, minding too make us
partakers of his goodness and mercy, wherein our welfare consists. Now then
we see, that to fear God it behooves us to be sure of his goodness. But here
Job has set down one particular for the whole, purposely to condemn
VVisdome, is that where as men are drawn away by their own vain
imaginations, when they buyld new wisdoms in the air: we must say, that our
Lord has not without cause entitled his word by the name of wisdom. For his
qualifying of it after that sort, is to show us that we must come thither, and
submit ourselves unto it, and rest wholly there. And why? For it is the thing
wherein lies our whole perfection. And as touching that which is said of the
fear of God: like as Gold and Silver are tried in the furnace, or by the
tutchstone: so must we be tried, that it may be known whither we have
profited in the holy Scripture, that is to say, whither we be edified in the
fear of God or no. We go to a sermon: and they that have the commodity do
read Holy Scripture also. Very well, it is a good and holy exercise, and
would God we were yet much more given unto it without all comparison than we
be. But yet therewithal it behooves us to know whither we have bestowed our
time well or no. And how shall we know that? Not by that we can skill to
talk of it, and give fair answers to men's demaundes, nor that we be able
to resolve all doubts that shall be alleged, nor that we can give fit
expositions to the text* to say, thus must they be understood. True it is
that these things are necessary: but that is not all. How then shall it be
known whither we have profited either by Sermons, or by reading of Gods
word? [wee shall know it by this,] namely if our life yield records of it.
If we fear God, it is a token that we have studied well in his schole, and
that like as he on his side has been a good and faithful schoolemaister, so
we on our side have not lost our time. Thus much have we too mark. And
furthermore we see, that when the holy Scripture intends too give a good
and sure mark too discern the faithful from the despizers of God: it says,
let the^ that fear the Lord praise him: you that fear the Lord enter into
his house. Let them that fear God be glad and rejoice. Let men that fear God
rest boldly upon him. Ye that fear God bless the Lord. This (I say) is the
true mark whereby to discern Gods flock from all the wild beasts that
raunge abroad. So then if we come to a Sermon, or have the Bible in our
hands: let us learn to know, that God meeneth not too puff us up with vain
presumption of knowledge, nor to scratch our

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with the acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to forgive us our faults past, and to call us in
such wise unto him, as we may be increased and settled more and more in the
grace of his holy spirit, so as we may be rid from all the vices of our flesh,
and therewithal that he forbear us in our imperfections, until he have taken
us out of this present life, to make us partakers of his everlasting glory. So
let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly father we acknowledge in our selves,
and confess as truth is, that we are not worthy to lift up our eyes unto
heaven to come before thy face, and that we ought not to presume so far that
thou will hear our prayers if thou have an eye too that which is in us. For
our consciences accuse us, and our sins bear witness against us, and we
know that thou art a rightuous judge that justifies not the sinners and
unrighteous, but punishes the faults of them that have transgressed thy
commandments. Even so Lord, in considering our whole life, etc.

The.Ciiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxix. Chapter.
Job took up his parable again and said:

2 Would God I were as I was in times past, when God preserved me.

3 When his lamp shined upon my head, and I vvalked in the dark by his light.

4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the Providence (or company) of
God was in my tent.

5 When the Almighty was with me, and my servants round about me.

6 VVhen] I vvashed my paths in butter, and the rock povvred me out Rivers
of Oil.

7 When I went out to the gate of the City, and made a chair to be set for
me there.


IT seems at the first sight, that Job bewayleth here the time past, and is
grieved that God had changed his state by afflicting him so sharply, whereas he
had made him too prosper before: but his meening is not so. For he sets
himself against those that had judged amiss of his affliction, as if he had
been a man forsaken of God. His intent therefore Prophet Esaias) and we must
consider that it is no playing with God. For although he wincke at things for a
time, he will in the end call those to account which thought themselves to be
escaped, and of whom the world supposed, that they should abide unpunished.
Ye see then that we must not settle our judgment simply upon affliction, but
consider what the life of them has bin, whom God punishes, to the end we
may acknowledge their chastizementes according to their deserts, for the better
profiting of ourselves thereby. For if we see a good man punished makes us to
prosper: and rather let us know (as I have said already) that he gives us
leisure to dispose our selves to the receiving of the adversities which he
shall send us, being well assured that he will pity us, and not handle us
rigorously. Likewise if we see that God lets the wicked run at rouers,
and lays the bridle in their neck, and destroys them not at the first
brunt: let us not think they make the better market for that, another let us be
tempted to envy their good fortune, as it is said in the seven and thirtith
Psalm: but let us exercise Why (says he) am I not as in time past when God
kept me? In saying that God kept him, Job meeneth that he had as now
forsaken him. Not that he was settled in that opinion, but for that he had, an
eye to his own natural understanding, as all the faithful do diverse times in
praying unto God. For they may well use this manner of speech to say, Lord thou
have forsaken Where are the times become wherein God preserved me? For he
meeneth that God has showed by effect and by very eysight, that he had
preserved him, as if some man should say, seeing that Job is so persecuted, is
it to be said that God keeps him? Is it to be said that God mainteineth him?
No, but rather that God has forsaken him as a wretched creature. Job the^
speaks not here of the thing as it was in very deed, as though God had at
that time forgotten him: but he speaks of that which might seem to me^, and
of that which he perceyueth by his natural wit, howbeit that he resisted it by
the force of faith, resting himself upon Gods promises, and fighting against
the te^tation that was put unto him. Ye see then in what wise it behooves us
to take this text, and therewithal to apply it to ourselves: and so let us
understand that if we be in prosperity, we must not term it good fortune
(according to the manner of me^ which always are so malicious, that they rob
and bereue God of his honor that belongs unto him) but we must use such
language as this, namely that God preserves us. What is the cause then that
God prospers us? what is the cause that we live and are still mainteyned when
we be beseeged with a thousand deaths? It is because God pitieth us and is our
Protector. Lo how it behooves us always to resort to Gods providence, that we
may yield him the praise of all the benefits which he bestows upon us, yea
eue^ in respect of this tra^sitory life. And furthermore, when our Lord
changes to outward apperance, and suffers us to be assaulted on all sides,
so as one man pilleth us, and another defameth us, and many adversities light
upon us: might it not be said to ma^s seeming, that God has forsaken us, and
will no more come at us? Yet notwithstanding let us not cease to receive the
promis which God gives us, yea and to hope even against hope, as which is the
lesson that is taught us in the person of our father Abraham, as S. Paul
speaks of him. But Job adds, that in that time God had lightened his lamp
upon him and that he had walked in his light in the mids of darkness. Let
us mark how it is diverse times said, that God inlighteneth us when he teaches
us by his word, and for that cause is it termed a lamp. But in this text it
has another sense. For Job meeneth not simply that God taught him by his
law, or by any revelation of the holy Ghost. But that God had given him
comfort in all his adversities, and therwithall also a good and desirable issue
of them. What then is the lamp of God? It was Jobs prosperity, in that God
stood by him, according also as we see that the scripture likneth the
afflictions of this present life unto darkness. As for example, if we be in
war or be troubled with famine or pestilence: we are as it were in the night:
Gods countenance is hidden from us: and we know not on which side to turn us.
So on the contrary part, when our Lord ha^dleth us lovingly, it is as much as
if the sun did shine upon us, we see that the daylight makes men glad, and
contrariwise that the light makes men sad and heavy. Also when it is clowdie
and raynie weather, we are after a sort beaten down and every one of us
shrinketh. So then let us mark, that Job does here continue his matter, by
saying that the lamp of God shined upon him, when he was in happy state, and
every man laughed upon him. Wherein is confirmed yet better, the doctrine
which I have touched: namely that need must not father the prosperity of this
world upon fortune, as we see these worldlings do, which look not unto Gods
hand another in weal nor woe. Therefore we must not do so, but rather whenever
we have any prosperity, let us consider that God shines upon us, and shows
us a loving countenance, and would have us to know him to be our father, that
we might glorify him. that God had given him light in the midst of
darkness. And he says this, because it is not possible but that we must be
in many inconveniences and dangers in this world, I mean even those which
seem to have all things as they would wish. Although we perceive some man to
be as it were exempted from all trouble: Yet notwithstanding so long as he is
upon earth he must needs walk among thorns. We shall always be threatened
with many deaths: and though a man have his Garners and Cellers full: yet is it
not to be said but that he may be made poor in the turning of a that Job in
the time of his youth had the providence of God also in his tent. The Hebrew
word which he uses here, does signify a latertime: but by a similitude
it is taken for youth, not for the youth of fifteen years, but for the time
of man's chief courage and lustiness, as from the years of five and twenty
unto the years of five and thirty. And why? For then is a man in his chief
flower, not for begetting of children as some have expounded it, (for that were
to fond and gross:) but because that man is then in his full ripeness too
give counsel, and to do any thing that belongs too man's life. For in that
age we see that men do so dispose themselves as they may be put to the doing
of some service. So then, like as the latter time brings forth his fruits:
so also in that age man is fit to yield his fruits, that is to say, to be
employed to some service. But in this text, a man may well take that word
both in that signification, and sometimes otherwise also by similitude: which
is, I would I were as in my later seazon, that is to say, as in the time when
men gathered the fruits of mine abundance. Lo what Job meeneth. When it is
spring time of the year, we see how the blade that shall bear corn, shoots
forth, and the vynes begin to budde. Howbeeit as yet there is nothing but
hope: We see the meddowes spring up with green grass: but in the latter
season the cattle are fat and well fed, because they have had pasture, and
the riches of the earth are gathered and laid up. Thus ye see the time of
abundance. And so I doubt not but Job meant too say, when I was in my riches,
when God had given me so great abundance of goods as they flowed in my
house. And afterward he adds, that the providence or company of God was
upon his tent, pursewing the matter which he had talked of already. The Hebrewe
word which Job uses, signifies providence or company, and both of them agree
very well: therefore men need not to trouble themselves much, for the sense
continues all one. Therefore [the meening of it is,] when I had the providence
of God upon my tent, that is to say, when God watched over me to guide all my
affairs: or else when God kept me company, that is to say when I found him
favorable unto me, so as he was near me to hold me as it were in his lap.
Here Job continues his acknowledging of Gods benefits. And let us mark
well, that if a man which was tormented after that sort, was notwithstanding
not so far besides himself, but that he always glorified God: what is to be
said to us, if we think not upon God when he lets us alone quietly in the
mids of our ease? We know that when a man is pinched with adversity, he is
so dismayed as he remembers another God nor himself, but is carried away, and
his wits be amazed. And now in what state was Job? Have we not seen, that
there was never yet almost any creature, that was tormented after that
fashion? And yet nevertheless it is seen, that he still directs himself
unto God, and glorifieth him by confessing that the benefits which he had
received in times paste, fell not to him by casual adventure, nor were
purchased by his own travel and policy, nor that he was beholding unto
men for them. How then? It is God (says he,) who has lighted his la^pe upon
me, it is he that has guided me, it is he that has been at hand with me.
When Job speaks so, ought it not to be a record to condemn those men double
and treble which are not so dismayed, and yet nevertheless do forget God, and
swallowe up his benefits without doing him any honor at all? Then let us
learn to glorify God for all things, after the example of Job, both in
prosperity and adversity. And in so saying, he adds what his state was for
the time that God was with him as his companion and guard, that is to wit, that
his feet were bathed in butter, and that the rivers flowed unto him with oil.
By these similitudes Job signifies, that God had set him in such prosperity,
as he wanted nothing. And when he says that he trod in butter and bathed his
steps in it: it is as much to say, as that god made that his feet were
bathed in butter, and that the stones yielded him honey, that is to say, that
even the hardst things were turned unto him into pleasure: And now he shows
that he was had in honor and estimation. The Gouerners (says he) tarried at
the Gates, there I made a chair to be set for me, and every man yielded me
honor and reverence. When Job says so, it is not in way of bragging, (for he
bears the shame that God had laid upon him, with all humility) but he
reproves his adversaries. As if he should say, you judge of me as now that I
am a damned and cursed man. And why? For ye see me a wretched carcass,
destitute of all help, and every man scorneth me. But see whither ye judge
rightly or no. For it is not long ago since I was honored of all men, and then
would you have douked to me too. Therefore you judgment is not right and
indifferent, because you stay upon visible things, whereas you ought to look
further. Now you see what Jobs meening is. Wherefore according to that which
has bin declared, forasmuch as we can go no further as now, let us learn as
often as our Lord does us any good, let us learn (I say) too acknowledge that
the same comes not of fortune, but of the hand of God. And on the contrary
part, whenever it pleases him to afflict us, let us know that his intent is
to waken us by that means, and that it serves not to put us out of heart, but
to humble us. And therefore let us not cease to resort still unto him,
assuring our selves that when he has beaten us with his rods, he can well
cure us again, as he that knows the remedies that are fittest for our
welfare.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him too make us feel them in such wise, that being
heartily sorry for them, we may seek nothing but to rid our selves of our
fleshly affections, that we may be fully clothed with his holy spirit, to
the end we may yield our selves to his obedience. And that we may know how to
profit our selves in such wise, both by our own afflictions, and by the
afflictions of our neighbors, as we may be still instructed more and more in
his fear, and glorify his judgments, and not to be so wrapped in these
present things, but that we may always look higher, and that in the mids
of our afflictions, we may not cease to resort unto our good God, trusting
that he will continue his goodness toward us, even till he show us that thing
in effect and experience, which he now warranteth by his word. That it may
please him to grant this grace, not only too us, but also to all people, etc.

The.Cv. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxix. Chapter.
8 When the young men savve me, they hid themselves, the Princes rose up,
and stood upon their feet.

9 The Gouerners left speaking when I spoke, and laid their hand upon their
mouth.

10 The Princes hilde their peace, and their tongue cleaued to the roof of
their mouth.

11 The ear that heard me said I was happy, and the eye that savv witnessed
with me.

12 For I delivered the poor when he cried, I helped the fatherless that
was succorlesse.

13 The blissing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I
comforted the heart of the widow.


THe more precious that a thing is, the warelier ought a man to keep it, and
the The young men ( says be) hid themselves when they saw me. What
moved the young men too hyde themselves? For if a man pass his bounds, young
men will rather take the more boldness too do evil, when they shall have
such a shadow and Hyde, imports a shame which those had that feared not
God. For yet nevertheless they were hilde in awe before men, and were loath to
have their lewdness known. And specially if a virtuous man that have some
gravity in him, do come in the way: with a searingiron, insomuche that whereas
otherwise I would suffer the sun, the heaven, the earth, and men, to bear
witness of my lewdness: Yet notwithstanding I am restrained when I see that
men shall point at me with their fingers, and that I shall be hated and
abhorred: For vice is cursed of it self. We see then that this
shamefastness which men have, is as a process, that God makes against us
aforehande, as if he should charge a Iewrie, and take informations and
inditements against us, to the end we should be cast, and that notwithstanding
all the that the Princes rose up before him, yea and that the cheef men and
gouerners bild their peace when they heard him speak. Here we see an order
that nature teaches, were it not that the malapertnesse of men peruerteth all
things. And if we follow that which our Lord shows, I say even according to
the order of nature: It is certain that if there were a man that had the gift
of teaching, and more judgment and knowledge than other men, he should be
harkned unto, and every man would hold their peace when he spoke. What is the
cause then that when a man shall speak good reason, and have the gift to
edify others: he is not received, but despised: and many bablers thrust
themselves forth and will needs be heard with their tongues running at riot,
by means whereof the truth shall be put back, and thrust under foot? what is
the cause thereof: It is for that men cannot abide that God should guide and
govern them, but (as I say) they corrupt all the order of nature by their
malapertnesse, or rather madness. For needs must we become wood beasts, when
we cannot abide to submit our selves to truth and reason, and to admit them
that are ordained over us as it were in Gods stead. Therefore less we see
there are very few now adays that can abide to be taught, but every man
takes upon him too be a teacher. And see how ill we practice the lesson that
is given us by Saint James, where he says, that we must not covet too be
many masters: for contrariwise there is none of us all, but he thinks
himself able to guide the whole world: and in the mean while there is not
any man that can abide to be taught or told any thing, no though he be but a
young Calfe. So much the more then ought we to mark this circumstance, which I
have he had succored the poor, and afflicted, and that the blissing of him
that was ready too perish had bin upon him, and that he had bin the defender
of the fatherless, and the protector of the widows. So then this uprightness
purchased him authority, according as it is said in the fiftenth Psalm, that
we must honor them above all men, which have the fear of God. And surely (as
was declared not long ago) seeing that the fear of God is our wisdom, yea
even our true wisdom: we must also consider whether a man deserve to be heard
or no. Furthermore when a man walks uprightly, and gives good assurance that
his speech is not feyned, and that he is no dissembler that does but babble
from the teeth outward, and has no affection at all in his heart: if a man be
such a one, as that his whole life warranteth that he intends too teach
other men in good earnest, to the intent that God may be served and honored:
let us assure our selves that we must take such a one for a mirror or looking
glass: for if we make no recking of the good life of such as ought to teach
us, we reject the assurance that god gives us of his doctrine. True it is (as
I have said,) that men cannot bar the word of God from continuing in his
full state: for it depends not upon the virtuous behavior of men. But
howsoever the world go, when God is so gracious unto us to teach us by such
men as witness by their lives, that their only seeking is that men should
serve God, I say when we have such a record: it is as it were a sealing of the
doctrine, and it is all one as if God should relieve our infirmity by driving
and pricking us forward, because he sees us so negligent and slow to come
unto him. Is it not a sign that we be slothful beasts, if we make no
account of this? So then let us mark well this sentence as it is touched here
by Job: and therewithal let such as have the charge to teach others look well
to themselves, that they behave themselves in such wise, as their life may be a
pattern to all men, and bear witness that they speak not in vain, but that
they speak the word of God which is thoroughly engraven in them: and let us
also take warning in their persons too have the word of God in estimation,
that we may yield our selves too his obedience as well as they. Thus ye see
the thing which all ministers that the blissing of him that was ready too
perish, came upon him. Let us mark well this saying: for when a man is at
deaths door, it seems to us, that whatsoever still the example of Job: and
show that we fear God: yea and let our showing of it be, not by I wot not
what Ceremonies, wherein there is no substance, but by the things that our
Lord commands us, especially in his law: which are that we should
execute justice, righteousness and mercy: that is to say, that we should
yield every manne his right, that we should absteyne from all evil, from
all injury, craft, and violence, and endeavor to serve our neighbors,
cheefely in having pity and compassion upon those that are in adversity, too

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him too have pity upon us, and too make us so to
feel our sins, as we may be humbled in true repentance, and come to seek
him in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ: and that when he shall have
received us too mercy, it may please him so to guide us with his holy spirit,
as his glory may shine in us, and we in the mean while may not covet to be
honored of men, but hold our selves contented, that his glory shines so in
us, as his name be exalted: and that it may please him to make us to walk in
such soundness under his obedience, that such as wander and go astray, may
be brought into the way of salvation by means of our example, so as all of
us together may serve him with one common accord all the time of our life. And
for the performance hereof, it may please him too stir up true and
faithful Ministers of his word, etc.

The.Cvj. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxix. Chapter.
13 The blissing of him that was ready to perish, was upon me, and I
comforted the vvydovves heart.

14 I was clothed with righteousness, I apparayled my self with judgment
as with a Robe or a Crown.

15 I was the eye of the blind, and the foot of the Cripple.

16 I was the father of the poor, and I sought out diligently the case that I
knevve not.

17 I brake the chavves of the wicked, and plucked the pray out of his teeth.


We began yesterday too show how Job gives here a trial of the virtues of
a man that fears pitilesse to such as God has sent too us to be succored.
And thereafter as our heart shall have been hard and unkind: so will God shet
the eyes of such as see us in poverty, so as they shall have no remorse of us:
we may well complain and smart, but no man shall regard it. And why? For it
is the payment that we deserved, when we had not compassion of those that were
in distress: specially seeing God sends us such a trial, of purpose too
know whether we be willing to serve him or no. To be short, we see here,
that mercy is one of the principal that the blissing of him that was ready
to perish, was upon him, and that he had bin the father of the widow, and the
defender of the fatherless. And furthermore let us mark well, that according
as we see the wants and necessities of our neighbors, so is it all one, as if
he should say to us, Behold, I show you, that I would have men to communicate
together. For god could well enough bring to pass, that every man should be
contented with his own person, and to live alone by himself. But we see that
there is none of us al which has not need of others help. I speak even of
the richest and those that of the lame, of the blind, of such as were ready
to perish, of the widows, and of the fatherless,) every of us ought to
consider, go to, how ought I to behave my self in this case? For if god have
given us wherewith, he binds us out of hand to help such as want. And if we
have not that consideration with us: it is a disappointing of our neighbors,
and we rob them of the thing that God has ordained to help them with: and
further we must yield an account for keeping back of that thing which God had
committed unto us, to the use and end that such as want it should be succored
by it. So then let every of us consider well the ability that is given him:
for we shall pay dear for gods gifts, if they be not bestowed as they ought to
be* specially if we consider no^ that they be precious in gods sight, and
thereupon do use them purely as he commands. There is not any of gods gifts
so small which is not worthy to be had in estimation: and that is then done,
when we apply them to their right and lawful use. Therefore when god indueth a
man with any gift: it behooves him to think, this is not for my self alone:
true it is, that God will have me to use it with thanks giving: but his giving
of it is also, to the end that I should have wherewith to help my neighbors:
and therefore I must streyne my self thereunto: and if I play the niggard in
that behalf, god ca^ well show that I am but as a steward of their goods, and
that they are not mine to dispose as I list, but that the dealing of them only
is committed unto me. Wherefore let every man consider in what wise god will
have his gifts esteemed, and let every of us so drink of his own waters (as
Solomon says) that our rivers may flow forth to our neighbors: let us not play
the glutto^s by our selves alone: but let us have such a spring as may both
satisfy our selves, and also releue such as want. Let us drink of the fountain
that God has given us: but yet therwithal let us so deal, as other men also
may feel of it, and let us not be like wild beasts. Thus ye see what we
have to remember in this sentence. And furthermore let us also mark on the
other side, that if we be not too cruel, the very necessity^s themselves
ought too move us to succor our neighbors. And truly though we had neither
law written, nor the Prophets, nor aught else: Is not nature her self a
sufficient good mistress to bow us, and to soften our hearts, when we see men
in any necessity? Behold, one man is blind, another lame, and the third
lacks the goods of the world, and another wants defense, and another has
need of counsel: in this case we see our own flesh (as the Prophet Esaias
says) we cannot renounce our own nature. Therefore when we see men which are
made after our own likeness in necessity: if we succoure them not, are we
not as ill or worse than brute beasts? So then that he had made inquisition of
the case that was not known unto him, because he was minded too know the
truth out of hand. He speaks here, not in his own private person, but as
one that had authority too do justice, as we have seen before. And this is a
point well worthy to be noted of such as are in office of justice. For here he
shows, that they ought to be watchful in searching out every man's right, to
the end they suffer not any to be oppressed, nor yet to do any deceit or wrong.
True evident: and yet notwithstanding, they will thrust in their lies to snarle
and entangle it utterly. To be short, there is nothing to be seen but so
villaynous shamelessness, that the very babes may judge of it. And will God do
nothing in the mean while? Will he suffer men to scorn his Majesty after
that sort, and to defile his sacred seat which he had dedicated too his
own name? No no. So then we see that such as are set in the seat of
justice, shall have a terrible account too make, and that there is a dreadful
curse prepared for them, unless they be vigila^t that be brake the chawes of
the wicked, and plucked the pray from between his teeth But this cannot be
done unless the Judges and Magistrates have such a stoutnesse in the^, as they
cannot abide any evil without resisting it. And I have broken the Chawes of
the wicked, and plucked the pray out of their teeth. But now let us mark, that
when God ordeineth magistrates, that is to say, when he calls me^ to the
office of justice, and armeth the^ with his sword, in so doing he binds them
to maintein the good and the innocent, and to take upon them the defense of
right, and also to set themselves against al wrongs, misdealings, and
violences. Now if a Judge say, I know not who had right or wrong: who was to
blame for it? For first of all God will never fail to give wisdom to such as
ask it: and again, he will also bliss their labor, which travel faithfully
to seek out the right. But what Judges are so far of from making inquisition
for such as are oppressed: that if men do so complain unto them, that the air
shall ring of it, yet notwithstanding in the mean while the ears of such as
ought to set to their hands to remedy it, are deaf? If a man have patiently
put up a wrong, and the Judge be made privy to the case, he is not to be
excused, he cannot say, he came not to complain to me: no, but the fault was
committed before thine eyes, and it was thine office too redress it, but thou
have made no account of it, and think thou to escape clear before God? But
ye shall see poor folk complain, and come show their right, and yet can
have no redress. And contrariwise, where no evil has bin done, there the
sword must be drawn, and the matter must be handled with vehemency as if he
were mad. Some ^^n will say, it is but the zeal of justice. It is much to the
purpose: no it is too vilanouse a shamelessness wherein there is neither rhyme
nor reason, when they suffer a poor man to be troubled, and in the mean while
deal with all the rigor that may be in a matter of nothing. If a poor man
that is wronged do comp^ayn and lay forth his right, tush it is nothing, come
again a seuennight hence: and then he shall be delayed so long, that he shall
be tired. If a plain man have not rents and revenues to live upon, if he have
not men at his beck to solicit his matter, if he be a handicrafts man: he
must sterue for hunger, if he will recover right in a matter that is never so
evident. He has wrong done him, the world sees it, the matter is apparently
that he had clothed himself with his righteousness, and that he had made
Justice (that is to say vprightnes) as his Robe or Crown: that is too say
that he was decked with virtue, and not with bravery, as those be whom God
has advanced to some credit, who bear themselves in hand, that the world
is not worthy to look them in the face: they play the Peacockes, and spread
their wings abroad. Ye see then the decking of those which at this day are in
authority and state of Justice: for there is nothing to be seen but pride,
there is nothing but pomp and bravery, and yet they think themselves not to
be mortal men. But contrariwise it is said here, that the man which
regards God, and indeuereth to execute his duty faithfully, takes
righteousness for his Robe, and upright dealing for his Cloak or apparel. I
pray you if it were but for honesty sake, would a man suffer his coat and
cloak too be plucked from him, and himself too be sent too pick pagles, as
the proverb says? If it were neither whote nor cold, would he not keep
his clothes still, to the intent he might honestly keep company among men?
But if a man be stripped, and chance to be in the rain and wind, so as he
is left ready too starve for cold, or too swelt for heat, and his coat is
plucked in pieces: will it not grieve him at the heart? And yet notwithstanding,
righteousness and upright dealing are our very clothes, and coats where
with we be apparayled. And if a man have behaved himself faithfully in doing
his duty: God mainteyneth him, and he is fenced by protection from above,
he shall be in Gods favor, although no man made him good countenance among
men. Ye see then in what sort we ought to be clothed and apparelled before
God and his Angels: namely by keeping the said righteousness and upright
dealing, so as we have not been spoiled and destitute of it. Then although
that diverse times either by flattery, or by briberie, or by threatening or by
hatred, or by some other temptations, men labor too get away this clothing and
apparel of righteousness, and upright dealing from us: let us take good heed
that we be not spoiled of it, except we will have our shame and dishonestie
showed openly before God and his Angels. Furthermore, as touching the world,
and this present life, let us be well ware, that we lay not our selves open to
the cold or heat: that is too say, that God suffer us not to fall intoo many
wantes, and therewithal send us no succor. And why? For when we have been
so cowardely or slothful, to suffer our selves to be spoiled of our
clothes: It is good reason that we should smarte for it afterward. I had a
cloak to cover me, and keep me from the rain: and I have let it go at
adventure. Now, am I not worthy to be wette to the skin, seeing I hilde
scorn too cast my cloak about me? Behold, God declares unto us, that to
the intent we should be well clad, he himself has clothed us with his
own righteousness. And we cast away that righteousness as a thing of no
value: we make no account of the said upright dealing and equity which he
commends so greatly unto us: But we cast it away as it were into the wynd.
Seeing then, that we unclothe our selves after that sort, I pray you, deserve
we not that our Lord should give us up to all shame, to be mocked and
skorned, and therewithal to be left utterly destitute of all things, and
finally too have no aid nor succor, neither of God nor man? Lo what we have
to mark in this text. But truly we can never discharge our selves thoroughly
of that duty, I mean not only the Magistrates which have so high and hard
a charge, but also them which have no more to govern but themselves,

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him too make us so to feel them, that being utterly
dismayed, in our selves we may make our recourse unto him, trusting that the
same shall not be in vain, because he is willing and ready to help all them
that seek him. And so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The.Cvij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxix. Chapter.
18 I said, I shall dye in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.

19 My root is spread out to the water, and the deavve shall lie upon my
harvest, and it shall be very great.

20 My glory shall be renewed, and my bow shall be strengthened in my hand.

21 Men heard me with longing, and hilde their tongue at my counsel.

22 They replied not to my words, and my talk dropped as rain upon the
hearers.

23 They vvayted for it as for the deavv, and they opened their mouth as after
a desired rain.

24 If I laughed with them they believed me not, neither suffered they the
light of my countenance to fall.

25 When I came in way, I had the chief room, I was among them as a king
with his army, and as a comforter of them that mourned.


Job having spoken of the authority that he had purchased by his virtues, and
by the gifts of grace that God had put in him, does now add that it seemed
that his state should never have changed. And therein he shows that he was
not like those which reign over me^ whether they will or no, and are always in
doubt and uncertainty: according as we see that such as attain to honor and
authority wrongfully, may well bear great sway, and make all the world to
quake under them, but as soon as the wind turns, the least change in the
world overthrows them. Why state, when he is once in it. We see what David
himself confesses: When I was in my prosperity (says he) I said I shall
never be removed. True it is, that in the tenth Psalm, he puts it over to
the despizers of God. For in speaking of their prosperity, he says, that
they bear themselves in hand, that although the whole world should be
turned vpside down, yet are they so exceedingly well fenced, that they shall
continue safe still. Ye see then, that the worldlings and unbelievers presume
upon their own power, and take themselves to be so well City, a Shire, yea or
a Reahn ouerthrown (as I said before) where a man would have thought there had
bin so much help as it had been impossible too have come unto it: I say if we
see all this overthrown: let us understand, that our Lord sets that looking
glass before our eyes, to the end that every of us should think the better
upon his own frailty, and not fall asleep in any presumption or vain
trust. Thus ye see how we ought to profit our selves by this text, and by the
experience which our Lord gives us of it all our life long. But Job uses the
mo similitudes that the deaw shall lie always upon his harvest, or upon his
branches: (for the Hebrewe word imports both twayn, and all comes to one
end.) And again, that his days shall be multiplied as the sand. As if he
should say, without number. And again, that his glory shall be renewed, and
that his bow shall not be beaten down. True it is, that some men understand
these sayings to concern the hope of the resurrection: but men may see by the
whole process of the matter, that Job treats of the state of this present
life. that al me^ herkned to him, yea and that they berkned in such sort as
they waited for his words, and every man gaped, as a man that is athirst, or as
we see how the earth when it is very dry does crany, as if so be it desired
rain to drink. Job then declares, that he himself was such a one: that is to
wit that he was as the rain and the deaw, and that all such as heard him, were
as it were altered at his words, and hung upon his talk as upon an vnreuocable
judgment. And this is declared unto us purposely, to the end we should know
first what a man Job was, whom we see so sore smitten by Gods hand. Therefore
let us not complain and grudge against God, nor accuse him of cruelty, when he
afflicts us. For we see what Job gained by it namely that he abode vanquished
and confounded when he went about to strive against the chastizementes that God
sent him, and yet nevertheless, ye see what holiness of life, and what
perfection was in him. Therefore let us learn that God is always just in
afflicting us, and that if we compare ourselves with Job, we shall find
ourselves to be far short of the perfection that was in him, and yet was he
beaten more sharply than we be. So the^ we have none other shift, but to
receive Gods stripes with all lowliness and patience. Mark that for one
point. And herewithal we see in Jobs person, what reverence we ought to bear
to such as God sends to teach us faithfully. It is said that men hearkened to
him with longing: wherein he shows that me^ ought to have a desire to profit
in knowledge, and that seeing nature provoke the^ to desire to eat and drink
for the nourishment of their bodies: they must not despise the food of their
souls, which is the knowledge and lerning of goodness, whereby they differ
from brute beasts. When we know a thing to be good to maintain us: we need
neither master nor teacher to teach us to covet it: neither need we any
provocation to it, or any body to put us in mind of it. Every man (as I said)
can skill to covet to eat and drink, every man can desire too be clothed.
Why so? For we know that those things concern our life. But now, is not our
soul the excellentest part of us? And how ought that to be interteyned? Not
with eating and drinking: But there is a thing agreeable too the nature of it,
which is to have reason and understanding, that our life be not brutish, but
that we may show ourselves to be creatures formed after the image of God. So
then, in this verse it is showed us, that if we be not too blockish (or at
leastwise if we have any reason at all in us) we ought continually to devise
how we may profit, by knowing too what end man is borne in this world: namely
to be more and more stablished in the knowledge of God, after we have once
received it. But we see many so retchlesse, as they pass not to hear any
thing: and we see othersom that cannot be satisfied with dispising the doctrine,
but they also hate it, and utterly absent themselves from it as much as they
ca^. And do such folk deserve to be counted men? No: for the thing wherein we
differ from brute beasts, is that we have some reason and understanding in us,
to discern between good and evil: yet notwithstanding there is such grosnes and
infirmity in our wits, as we have need of furtherances. Yea and though we
had all the furtherances that could be wished: yet is it apparent, that there is
still default in us. For what is the cause that we reject all the benefits
that God offers us, but because we be woise than beasts? So then we must
needs conclude, that if a man knew the end of his creation, and why he
lives in this world: he would always be moved to profit in knowledge, as to
set his mind thereupon, and he would never refuse the means when they were
offered, but would think with himself, behold, God intends to teach me, and
therefore That his words were wished and waited for, as the rain or deaw. And
Moses also uses the same in his song: ye heavens (says he) let my words
drop as the deaw, or the rain in their season. Now for the understanding
hereof, we must not only consider the rain in it self, but also that his
words were waited for, and longed for as the rain and deawe. That is to wit,
we must assure ourselves, that the good doctrine which God sends unto us for
our welfare, comes to us from heaven, and that although we hear it at a
mortal man's hand, yet notwithstanding it is of Gods sending. Ye see then how
Gods desire is too water us. Too what intent? To make us receive good seed out
of hand, and to bring forth good fruit according as it is added here. For Job
not only says that his words were longed and waited for. But also that men
received them immediately with great and earnest good will, and also that there
was no more replying to the contrary. Then if it please God to teach us, and
(for the doing thereof) to raise up meet men induced with the grace of his
holy spirit, under whom we may profit. Let us give ear to them with all
reverence, and yield too their good doctrine without any constraint. True it is
that we ought to examine spirits, and that we must not at all adventure
receive all doctrines that are set before us, until we be sure that they are
of God. But when we know that it is God that speaks, that is too say, when
we are sure that we be taught in his name, and as it were by his mouth: then
is there no replying, but we must do him the honor to settle ourselves
fully upon his word, so as we may yield ourselves obedient unto it, and it may
have full course and authority among us. True it is that many can find in
their hearts to suffer God too speak without kicking against him, so as they
know the things to be good which are preached unto them: but yet do they
strive against him in their life. And that is the thing wherein our Lord
intends to try whether we be his or no. Have we heard Gods word? We must
not reply against it, but we must glorify God, assuring our selves that there
is nothing better for us than to obey him. Have we once acknowledged that? Let
every of us (when we be returned that if Job iested with them, they believed
it not. Whereby he meeneth, that he had such a gravity in him, as men durst
not believe that he would jest, because that in all his conversation he
showed himself as a Prophet of God, and had gotten so great credit as the
very reverence which men bear unto him, was a cause that men thought not that
he would abace himself to become fellow like and companion with others. And
afterward he adds, they constreyned me too let the light of my countenance
fall: that is to say, they compelled me to hyde my cheerful countenance,
because that although they were glad to see it, yet durst they not show like
countenance again, for fear of offending him by any manner of way. This
serves to confirm the matter more which was spoken of already. For the holy
Ghost shows us as it were in a looking glass, what the reverence of the
whole people was in those days, toward a man that was endued with excellent
gifts, notwithstanding, the same spirit that rested in him, speaks at this
day unto us. Then if men honored him in such wise as they durst not show like
countenance when he laughhed, for fear of displeasing him: It shows well the
obedience which we should yield too Gods word, and that we ought to esteem
and honor the doctrine, in as much as we know it proceeds from him for
our welfare. And herewithall Job shows also after what sort he behaved him
self among those that honored him so and gave him the chief room as unto a
king: namely, that he had been a comforter of the afflicted. Therefore he

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledging of
our sins, praying him that when he has made us perceive them, he will also
give us such repentance as we may heartily desire to be healed by the remedies
that he sends us: and that for as much as his word is the true medicine to
purge all our diseases, he will make the same to work effectually: and when
he has given us health, he will feed us with the selfsame food, and
strengthen us more and more thereby, so as we may show by effect, how it is he
that lives in us, and therefore that we may not live any more after the world
and the flesh, notwithstanding that we dwell here: but that our living may
only be to feed our souls with his word, until he have called us intoo the
kingdom of heaven with his Angels, where we shall need no more teaching, nor
to have the means which are requisite for our infirmity as now. That it
may please him too grant this grace not only to us but also too all people
and nations of the earth, etc.

The.Cviij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxx. Chapter.
Now they mock me which are younger than I, whose fathers I have refused
to set with the dogs of my flock.

2 For vvhereto did the strength of their hands serve me, seeing that age was
perished in them?

3 They being destitute by means of dearth and famine, fled into the place
that was solitiarie, dark, desolate and waste.

4 They did cut up vveedes by the trees, and the Juniper root was their meat.

5 They were chased from among men, and men shouted after them as after a
thief.

6 They dwelled in the clefts of rivers, in caves of the earth and in rocks.

7 They roared among the trees, and gathered themselves together under the
bushes.

8 The children of fools, yea the children without renoume were brought
lovver than the earth.

9 But now am I their song, and their matter to talk upon.

10 They abhor me and flee far from me: and forbear not to spit in my face.


WE have seen the honor wherein Job had been for a time: and his rehersing
of it is, too the end that by comparing it with the reproach wherein he was,
he might show how he had the more cause to be fallen. A poor man that shall
have lived at home in the country, and never tasted of honor and pomp, is
always at a point with him self, when men scorn and disdain him, or show
any token of contempt toward his person. The good men also which shall have
lived in simplicity, will not be so greatly grieved at it, but will ouerpasse
it. But as for him that has been brought up in pleasure, and has had
abundance of riches, he can abide no shame without deadly wounding to the
heart, because men hilde him in some estimation. And although men when such
extremities betide us, out Lord prepares us to patience. And thereupon let us
mark the example of David, who was a man subject to passions as we be, and
yet notwithstanding submits himself wiilingly, when he perceived it to be
Gods will that he should be as it were torn in pieces, yea though it were
wrongfully. For that is not the matter that must grieve us: but rather we must
be of good cheer when our consciences answers well for us before God, and
when we know that men persecute us wrongfully. This (say I) is a thing the
good, and to turn light into darkness. Although the^ that God have ingraued
such an insight in the despisers of his majesty, that they commend all things
which they know to proceed of him: yet nevertheless they by and by after fall
to such a rage, as they shut their eyes, and become brutishe wilfully. And why?
to the intent to spue out their blasphemies and raylings against God, and
against the gifts and grace of the holy spirit. Therefore it is no wonder
though such as fear God and walk in soundness of life, be subject to many
slanders and reuylings: according to our own nature, which is too much
inclyned thereunto. But I am a poor man, I was never in credit or estimation,
the world has not heard any talk of me: Now if I see a great personage cast
down, it is as if a mountain fell down: and what else should I think of it,
but that our Lord intends to set so much the greater brightness upon his
judgments, to the intent that I should consider what I am my self? I am
here a silly woorme, I do but creep upon the earth, and such a one did as
it were soar above the clouds: and yet that the young folk mocked him; yea
even those whose fathers he would not have vouchsafed too have made his
d^g^eepers. I^ s^o^lde seem that Job speaks here with great scornfulnesse.
For he gathers together all that is possible for him in disdain of those that
scorned him: as when he says, their fathers were beggars, I held scorn of
their service, they were rascalles, and poor steruelings that scraped up the
earth with their nails too gather roots, and they did eat the berries of
Juniper in the woods: and now I see my self scorned by them. It seems (I
say) at the first blushe, that Job is inflamed with some scornfulnesse and
presumption. But like as I have declared heretofore that he expres^ed the
temptations which he felt, but yet consented not unto them: so it behooves us
to remember this text, that Job looks upon the thing as it is, and yet in the
mean while ceasseth not too fight against the gripes that gnawed his heart and
his maree, to the intent he might patiently bear such reproaches. For surely
when we be scorned by such as have not any commendable thing in the^: that is
much more hard and strange to us. We be despized at honest men's hands, we
consider that we must not sooth our selves in this case for to make excuse: for
there is some cause why, seeing that such men do find fault with us. But if they
that be wicked and unruly, and full of al shamefulnesse, do mock us: surely such
an extremity makes the reproach seem the greater, so as we be the more
grieved with it. Thus ye se what Job looked at, in saying that those which were
such abiects, had lift up themselves against him. And let us mark well how Job
has declared heretofore, that he was not honored for his riches, for his high
estate, or for his noble birth: (those are not the things whereon he grounded
him self) but because he had walked in so great uprightness and perfection,
that at the sight of the virtues which God had put into him, men were
constreyned to yield him reverence, and he had not abused those graces. Now
the^ ye see why he thought it a very hard and grievous case to be despised by
those in whom there was nothing worthy of praise. Howbeit forasmuch as we see
that Job was brought so low: let us understand that if our Lord send the like
in these days, it behooves us to be strengthened by this example. And therefore
although the thing be heavy and hard for us to bear: yet notwithstanding let
us be so mylde as to stoop as often as it shall please God to afflict us.
Verily there is even a natural reason which ought to teach us this. As how? We
must not think it strange, though verlets and such as have neither honesty
nor good quality, nor manners in them, do rush out into railing. For we see
this come to pass daily: and the thing that is of custom and ordinary with
us, ought to seem no novelty: but we ought to be thoroughly acquainted with
it. But besides this natural reason, let us also consider (as I have touched
already) that it is our Lords intent to try our patience the better, when he
casts us after that manner into contempt, not only of those that are in
authority and estimation, but also of those that are the veriest shakerags, so
as we would think our selves to be assaulted rather of brute beasts, than of
men. Therefore when our Lord afflicts us by any such means, it is to meeken
us: We see it is a general thing even unto all mankind. How happens it that
lice, fleas, and flies, and such other vermin make war both against great
and small? For no man can exempt himself from them. And although al men be not
combred with filth and stinck, yet notwithstanding our Lord makes us subject
to those worms, as it were to anoy us, eue^ though we be kings and princes, so
as every one of us must abide that he would not have vouchsafed to have set
their fathers to be keepers of the dogs of his flocks. For in the last
Chapter he had showed himself to be of so great courtesy, as he was not only
the father of the fatherless, and the defender of the widows: but also the
eye of the blind, and the foot of the lame: that is to say, that he had had
compassion of all poor folks, and used kyndnesse toward them in succoring
them. Now therefore to say that he vouchsafed not to match their fathers with
his Dogs, it seems clean contrary. But let us mark, that Job speaks
not here, of his own disposition

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them in such wise, as we may
learn too condemn them in oureselues, according as in deed we have all
cursednesse: and therewithal, that if he afflict us, we may by that means be
inured to be sorry for our offenses, and to mourn for them, referring our
selves unto him, and praying him to deface the faults that we have committed,
and to wipe them out of remembrance, not only before him, but also before men,
too the intent that our life may not be a stumbling block, but an edifying
unto all men. And that all of us both great and small, may learn to frame our
selves too his obedience, that having mutual fellowship one with an other, we
may live toogither in good peace and brotherly love, and by beholding the
chaunges of this world, be led further to the hope of the heavenly life, to
the end we may pass here bylowe as through a pilgrimage, wherein he will
not have us to rest. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only to
us, but also to al people and nations of the earth, etc.

The.Cix. Sermon which is the second upon the.xxx. Chapter.
11 Because the Lord has broken my cord and afflicted me, they also have
broken their bridle against me.

12 Theyong men rise up at one side, they pinched my feet, yea and they did
beset my paths with their stumblingblockes.

13 They marred my way, and indeuered to hurt me, and no man helped me.

14 They came against me as an ouerflovving river, and persecuted me
wrongfully by reason of this calamity.

15 Fear turned upon me, they pursued mine excellency as the vvinde, and my
vvelfare passed away as a cloud.

16 My soul was poured out upon me: the time of adversity caught hold of me.

17 My bones are perced by night, and there is no rest in me.

18 My clothing has changed color through the greatness of my misery, and
the hemme of my garment cleaves to me.

19 He has cast me to the ground, and I am become as dust and ashes.

20 When I cry unto thee thou hear me not, and although I wait, thou
regardest it not.

21 Thou art become cruel unto me, and art against me with the strength of
thy hand.


Because Job had heretofore declared, that men of more value had stepped
up so malapertly against have no such advantage of us, except it were given
them from above. For as much then as our Lord makes us despised, every man
can lift up himself against us: and it behooves us to bear this lesson well
in mind, to humble our selves withal. For until we have the skill too know
that it is God which puts us to reproach, and also which gives men leave to
persecute us: we shall never be tamed as we ought to be. Mark that for one
point. But after that Job has spoken so, he adds other like complaints:
that is to say, that the young men which had as rose up at one side, and tripped
up his heels to make him fall, or cast stones in his way for him to dash or
stumble at. Hereby he meeneth that he was mocked on all sides, and had no
more the reverence that he spoke of before. To be short, he meeneth that God
had laid him open to all injuries. And afterward he adds, that his soul
vexed him: Wherefore he shows that he was wounded through and through. For
it might fall out that a man should be mocked and not pass greatly for it. But
Job shows that the That his soul had been persecuted, and his welfare as it
were plucked from him. The Hebrew word which he uses does properly signify
Royal, Princely, or excellent: and also bou^tifull, liberal, willing, or
freeharted: and the word Soul is not expressed. Therefore it seems that Job
meant too name his soul, and to term it Royal or princely, as the noblest,
freest, liberallest or bou^tifullest part, like as kings and princes are termed
bountiful or liberal, because they That Job says that his highness was
overthrown, and his welfare taken quite from him. First therefore he sets
down the word Excellency or Highness, and afterward adds the word
Welfare, which has a further scope. The natural meening then is, that whereas
he had been was cast down in himself. For although a man's enemies mock him,
and he perceive well that they backebyte him on all sides; yet if he be at rest
in himself, such a man shall not be so greatly tormented, as he that is
utterly dismayed and can endure no more. And undoubtedly if a man see such
cruelty in men, as they are not satisfied with the misery that he indureth,
but also fall to blowing of the fire, and to greeuing of him further when they
see him as good as half dead already, so as every man strikes at him too
murder him, and to increase the torment wherewith he is already afflicted to
the vttermoste: that augmenteth his greef and anguish much more. Thus ye see
what Job meant in this streine when he says that terror took hold on him,
that he had no rest, that his pulses did beat continually, and that he had no
releef at all: like as a man that is in a continual ague, or that is so
tormented as he has no leisure to take his breath. Job then by such complaints
signifies, that he is not only mocked as diverse are, which yet for all that
forsake not their meat and drink and mirth, nor as they that are able to
defend themselves, so as though men practice evil against them, they are not
able to bring it to pass: but contrariwise he shows that he was so
afflicted, as he stood in fear of it. And under this word Fear, he
comprehends all the anguishes that we can feel, when either our Lord God,
or men, do set themselves against us. Yea and that word imports much more
than heaviness or anguishe: for heaviness is a greef for adversities present.
But when we are in fear, it is as if we saw death threaten us, and that we
were besieged with many dangers. For then we imagine, how now? Indeed I am in
misery already: but that is nothing. For such a misery may happen moreover:
and peradventure also an other on the other side, and yet another to that.
Therefore when we foresee such dangers, and it seems unto us that when we
be escaped from one death, there comes a second, and a third, and to be
short, we are assailed on all sides: that is a thing that stryketh our heart
dead: and that is it which Job meeneth by saying, that fear had caught hold
of him within: And this text ought to be well that God had cast him to the
ground, and that he was become like dust and ashes (for he had erst said, that
his garments were changed and cleaued as it were to his skin:) Thereby he
shows that he was utterly overthrown, and that there was not one spark of
hope of life left in him, insomuch that it might have bin said: behold a man
utterly consumed, in whom there reigns nothing but death. For by these words
carth, dust, and ashes, he not only meeneth that his strength failed him: but
also that he was become as a dead coarse, yea even as good as half rotten.
Job then shows right well, that there was no more token of life in this
extreme affliction which he endured: but rather that he was condemned, yea
even of all men, wherein it is showed us, that our trust must not be tied too
the things that are seen, but that we must trust in God, yea even in the
midst of death. And that when we seem to be past recovery, yet
notwithstanding we must take hold of the life that God has promised us, and
continually embrace it. And herewithall let us mark also, that Gods power is
not subject too any human or worldely means: but that he works after such
a fashion, as is incomprehensible and secret unto us. Lo here the two things
which we have too mark in this text, which go jointly one with another. For
why have we said that faith must not be enclosed in the things that we
see, but because it is grounded upon the power of God? But this power is
infinite and may not be compassed or ruled by worldly means, or by ought that
can be seen. For God is able to work after such manner, as is unknown to us.
Seeing it is so, it behooves our faith also too be enlarged likewise. And so,
for the better understanding of this doctrine, let us begin at the second
point which I have touched: which is, that Gods power whereby he intends to
work for our welfare, is not bou^ded within these lower things: and therefore
that we must not say, that God will do thus or thus because the order of
nature is so, or because we see some likelihood of it, or because there is
such a mean or help to compass it. For that were to do him great wrong,
inasmuch as the things that are in him are infinite. Therefore we must not
enclose Gods mighty power within our imagination and understanding. Like as
Gods goodness is endless and a bottomless pit: so also are his wisdom and
righteousness, and the same is to be said of his power. Now if we would
comprehend this mightiness and power: I pray you are we able too enclose it
in our brain? It is impossible. So then let us mark well, that when God
intends to save us, he does it not after the common fashion, but works by
miracle toward us: insomuch that he will raise us even from death. And that is
the cause why he chalengeth the office of sending men to the grave, and of
talling them back again. Also it is said in the Psalm: that the issues or
outgoings of death of our God, it is to the end that the faithful should
taste the neerenesse of God, and that he should make them feel the thing by
experience, which is contained here: namely, that he has the issues of death
[in his hand.] And what are those issues? It is that when death shall have
reigned over us, and we seem to be utterly overwhelmed, so as there is no more
hope of life: our Lord can well quicken us, yea even after a wonderful fashion
unknown unto us, and which men cannot perceive until it be showed by that
although be turned himself unto God to call upon him, be was not heard: yea
and that when he ^^ld on and waited Gods leisure: God pitied him not, ne made
any countenance to regard him, but which worse is, turned toward him as a
cruel person. Surely this is the greeuousest temptation that might be For if
any adversity happen unto us, we know that upon none but the unbelievers.
For if we cry, namely in faith and hope: it is certain that the promise which
was spoken of shall be infallible. But forasmuch as the crying of the faythlesse
is but a howling and roaring without any trust in God: and that although they
know that without him they be but forlorn and fordone, yet they set not their
minds upon him: therefore they are not heard. Wherefore since we see this
temptation of crying and not being heard did light upon Job: let us conclude
that if god make not cou^tena^ce to hear us, it is not for that he rejects
our prayers thou have turned thy self against me, and art become as though
thou were cruel. By this saying he meeneth not only that he was not
delivered from his miseries and adversities, nor eased of them: but also that
the fire seemed to be the more kindled, that the gulfs seemed to be open the
wider, and (to be

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him to touch us in such wise, as we may turn to him
with true repentance, and that by being exercised in the manifold wants,
miseries, and afflictions that linger upon us in this temporal life, we may be
rightly humbled under his obedience, to give our selves wholly to his service,
and to put our selves into his hand, acknowledging that he has all power and
authority over us: and that in the midst of all the distresses wherewith we
be combred, it may please him so to assuage all our greefes by the grace of
his holy spirit, as we may still rejoice in him, and always trust in his
goodness, even till he have delivered us from all the necessities and
miseries of this mortal life, and called us to his heavenly rest. That it may
please him to grant this grace not only to us. etc.

The.Cx. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxx. Chapter.
21 Thou art become cruel unto me, and have caught me up with the force of
thy hand.

22 Thou have lifted me up above the vvynde, and caused me to ride upon it,
and made my vvitte to fail.

23 I know that thou vvilt put me into the grave, in the house appointed for
all that live.

24 Yet shall none stretch out their hand thither, although many cry in their
affliction.

25 Have not I wept with such as had hard days, and has not my soulebin
sorry for the poor?

26 I have looked for good, and evil is come upon me, I vvayted for light
and behold here is darkness.

27 My bowels boil, and there is no rest in the time of the adversity that
has caught hold of me.

28 I go mourning, and cry out in the congregation.

29 I am as it were a brother to dragons, and a companion to Estriges.

30 My skin is become black upon me, and my bones are dried up.

31 My harp is turned to weeping, and my Organes to the voice of lamenting.


I Have declared heretofore how great a temptation Job endured, when it seemed
that his praying too God did him no good. For that is our last refuge in all
our adversities, and the souerain remedy that can never fail us. Then if it
seem that god showed himself cruel toward Job. Now when he speaks so,
it is not to accuse god of unrighteousness but to show the extremity of the
pain that he felt. Then if we be tormented with any excessive rigor, we may
well term the same a cruelty, but yet it follows not that we should
condemn God for it. Ye see then what Jobs meening was. And for the better
conceyuing hereof, let us bear in mind what has bin declared heretofore
namely, that the faithful which are pressed by the hand of god, heretofore. And
truly whenever our affections ouermayster us, it is impossible that we
should think of god and speak of him so reverently as we ought to do. Why so?
For our affections are blind: and if we will speak of God with such reverence
as he deserves: it behooves us to gather our wits to us, and to keep the^
quiet and peasable. So then seeing that Job shows and declares here, what
his former temptations were: no dout but he speaks unadvisedly. And therefore
we must not draw this saying to an example as though it were lawful for us to
follow them. that God had lifted him up upon the wind, and made him to ride as
it were in the air, and caused all his strength and substance to fail him.
When a man is so caught up, and carried away as it were in a whirle wind, it
is a dreadful thing. For if a man were beaten down and died there: it would
not be so terrible, as when God hoyseth him up into the air as it were with a
sudden tempest. We see then that Jobs intent is to confirm the matter which
he has declared: that is to wit, that God exercises and tries his servant
after strange fashions. And therefore let us not conceive Gods wrath only
according to the examples that we have seen with our eyes, and felt by our
own experience: but let us understand, that God can try us by such means as
are unknown to us, yea eue^ in such wise as we shall be worse than forlorn.
And when we know this, let us also pray God to strengthen us at our need: and
although that to the outward appearance we see nothing on all sides but the
grave, and it seems that we should be swallowed up, not only of bodily
death, but also of hell: Yet notwithstanding let us not cease to continue in the
fear of our God, and to rest always upon the trust of his goodness,
determining fully to call upon him, and to flee unto him alone for refuge, yea
though all our senses withstood it, and that it seemed to us that we were
barred from all access unto him. Thus ye see what we have to mind in these
verses. And so let us not think it to be a needless tale, when mention is
made of the winds and of the storms, and of Gods making of him to ride in the
air: For it serves to show that our Lord has strange ways to chastise
us, when it pleases him, and that we ought not to be taken unawares by them
for want of having thought of them before hand. And furthermore, if we feel
not so great and outrageous afflictions in us: let us assure our selves it is
because God bears with us. So then what ought we to do when we suffer
adversity? If we be grieved and tormented more than reason: (for so it may
seem unto us,) let us take example of Job. How now? Thou art not yet come too
the extremity that this good servant of Gods was at. And what is the cause
thereof, but for that thy God has respect of thy feblenesse: but he will not
handle thee so roughly though he could well do it and has just cause so too
do. Thou see then how he uses gentleness still toward thee: what rigor
soever thou feel, thou art not yet so martyred as that thou can say, that
he is come upon thee as a cruel lio^ that has torn thee in pieces. Thou can
allege no such thing: and therefore thou may well seek to thy good God, and
return unto him: and seeing he shows himself so kindharted and pitiful
toward thee, he will still be thy father and preserver. Ye see the^ how this
comparison ought to serve our turn, and that it behooves us to master our
affections when we feel to much hartburning and repining in our selves, and
that we be tempted to stomaking and rebelling against god. It behooves us I say
to think upon the things that are set down here. And Job alleges again unto
God, that he is a poor frail man and near unto death, and that therefore it
is a marvel why God should persecute him so roughly. I know (says he) that
thou will send me to the grave too the house that belongs unto all that
live. Seeing that the state of all men is such as thou have set them here too
make them pass away as it were in a moment: why should thou try thy self
and utter thy force upon them and against them? Lo what Jobs meening is: we
have heard the like sentences heretofore, and it is not without cause that they
be repeated here. For undoubtedly God will have us to pray and I know that none
shall stretch his hand thither, or that God shall not stretch his hand thither.
But the natural sense is this: when never so many men have bewailed me, yet
shall none of them stretche his hand thither to succor me: when death has
once caught me, there is no more remedy: all man's help booteth not. We see
then that Jobs intent is to say, seeing that death taryeth for us, and is
allotted to us: and when we be dead we are clean dispatched, and no man can
succor us: at leastwise give us some truce while we be here. Why vtterest
thou so great rigor against us? Thus ye see in effect what Job meant too say.
And I have told you already, in what wise it may be lawful for us too use
this complaynt: that is too wit, without murmuring or disputing. And by the
way let us mark, that too the intent we lift not up our selves against God,
ne strive against the rods wherewith he scourges us in this extremity: it
behooves us to come to one other consideration: which is, that although we go
forward unto death, and have always one foot in the grave: yet we know
that god has stretched out his hand to deliver us thence. For to what end
came Jesus Christ into the world? Yea why went he down into hell, that is to
say, why suffered he the anguishes that were due to all wretched sinners, but
too deliver us from them? So then if men cannot now conceive good hope to be
comforted in death: it is al one as if they would deny that our Lord Jesus
Christ has suffered it in his person. For whereas the Son of God abaced
himself so far, as to be subject to our curse, and to feel Gods hand against
him: that was to the end to deliver us from death, and to assure us that the
victory which he has purchased, is for us. Seeing then that he has power
over death: let his resurrection always come before our eyes, and let us
assure our selves that God has stretched out his strong and victorious hand,
to deliver us from the bondage of Satan. And therein let us consider, haut not I
wept with him that was in adversity, and had hard and sharp days or times?
was not my soul sorrowful with the poor or afflicted? Now then I have looked
for good, and evil is happened unto me: I have hoped for light and behold
here is darkness. Hereby Job declares that he sees not the reason why God
deals so roughly with him, forasmuch as in his prosperity he had not been
cruel but pitiful toward the poor and such as were in heaviness, and that
he had not been drunken in his pleasures, but had always considered what the
miseries of man's life are, so that he wept with them that did to punish us,
and why? For since the time that thou did prosper us by thy favor, we have
forgotten thee, and laid the bridle in our necks, and taken to much liberty.
And therefore it is good reason that thou should punish us, and that we
should feel the fruit of our sin and vnrulynesse. Lo how we ought to call
to mind our former faults, when God visits us by any affliction: And
specially how we ought to consider well, whether we have not been
unmerciful toward such as deserved our succor. For we have made no account
of others: it is I have waited for light, and behold here is darkness: I
have hoped for good, and behold here is evil: let us look for good according
as God promises it. For (as S. Paul says) the fear of God has promises,
not only of the everlasting life, but also of the present and transitory life.
So then let us always look for welfare at gods hand: that he was a companion of
dragons, and a brother of Estriges: that is to say, as a wild man, so as he
was no more of the number and company of other men, but God had so far
forsaken him, that he was become as a wild beast. And who is he that speaks
it? A man that lived in such holiness and perfection, as he might rather have
been compared with an Angel, than with a mortal creature, and yet for all
that, we see how he was handled. Hereby we be warned to put our selves wholly
into the hands of God, and not cease to trust in him though he scourge us
roughly, and seem minded to ouerwhelme us utterly: But to put that thing in ure
which we have seen here before: namely, that though he should kill us, yet we
would hope still for his mercy, and fight against the battails of death, and
grounding our selves upon his promises, hold our own still and continue
steadfast in the midst of all our adversities. Lo what we have too mark. And
furthermore if God scourge us for our sins: we must be the less plunged in
sorrow by reason of those afflictions, and take them so much the more meekely
and with a quiet mind, considering how we have need to be handled so sharply,
in respect of the diseases that are roted in us. In the mean while, forasmuch
as we cannot be merry but with offending of God: we have a threatening added
here, that he will change our harp into mourning, and our Organs into voice of
lamenting. We see how the world abuses Gods benefits in these days. For if
every man look into himself, we shall see that if our Lord give us rest, by
and by we start out of our things (as the Proverb says:) And again, if we
come to the common state, alas we see that the world is as far out of order
as may be: and (to be short,) it seems that men have conspired to grieve God,
and the more that he shows himself loving and kind toward us, it seems
that we become so much the bolder to provoke him. Since it is so, we may well
be afraid that he will turn both our harpes and our organes to weping wayling
and sorrow. For we are well worthy of it. And good reason it is, that he should
cast us into heaviness and anguish, seeing that we have abused his benefits
so shamefully. Yet notwithstanding if it please God to make us feel his hand
by afflictions, whether we know the cause of it or no: let us not therefore
cease to flee unto him, in hope that he will receive us to mercy: yea verily if
we condemn our faults, and that our co^demning of them be in such wise, as we
assure and warrant ourselves that he will continue his goodness toward us,
and make us always too feel his grace, even till he have filled us with it
to the full.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him too make us so to feel them, as it may be to bring
us to true repentance, and that yet notwithstanding we may not cease to taste
continually of his goodness toward us, to put our trust therein, and to flee
thereunto for our refuge in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And so let us
all say, Almighty, etc.

The.Cxj. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
I Have made a covenant with mine eyes: And have I (...) looked upon a maid?

2 And what is the portion of God from above, and the inheritance of the
almighty of heaven?

3 Is there not a cutting off for the rightuouse, and confuzion for such as
conspire (or practice) wickedness?

4 Does not he behold my vvayes, does not he count all my Steps?


We have seen already heretofore how Job protested, that he was no such man
as his friends would have made him believe: for they were of that he made a
covenant with his eyes not to cast any unchaste look upon any maid living.
And it is a sign of great and as it were Angelical perfection in man, if he
be able to protest that he has not bin provoked unto evil. For it may well be
that a man shall have some sudden and fleeting temptation, and yet
notwithstanding not consent thereunto, but rather shake it off and hate it. And
truly it were a great virtue, if a man could have all his wits so sound and
unattained of any corruption, as he could never himself to be toward us, and
to receive his promises, and to ground ourselves upon them, to say, no,
howsoever the world go, yet will I trust in my God, and flee to him for
refuge. Howbeeit although we finally atteyne to this assurance and
vndoubtednesse: yet notwithstanding if we waver and doubt before we come
thereunto, it is a greater fault than the first, and we are already guilty of
mistrust and unbelief before God, because we have received so wicked a
temptation. Lastely comes the third degree, when we be utterly overthrown
and know I have made a league (says he) or couenawit with mine eyes. I have
told you that this is a token of great perfection. And why? For if a man can
withholde his sight, so as he conceive not any thing that might draw him unto
evil by looking about him* and show that there is true chastity and honesty
in him: It must needs be said that he is clear as an Angel from all
corruption. And Jobs protesting hereof is not in vain: wherefore let us
consider that he lived in this world as an Angel of God. True it is that of
nature he For in the end his hypocrisy must be discovered and laid open to
be punished with all the rest. They then which imagine that they do not amiss
nor offend God when they be tempted to evil, gain nothing by it, another do
they amend their market: for needs must that hypocrisy of theirs be
grievously punished. Wherefore (as I said before) although we consent not to
evil, but only be as it were tickled with it, and have some liking of it,
howbeit that we withstand it: It is already a fault and oversight in us. If we
do but conceive such evil liking, it us cry out before God: alas Lord, thou
have given me thy grace to go forward in thy service, I do my endeavor, I
enforce my self, I resist all my passions, and I fight against my self, and
yet am I not rightuous before thee, but there is much amiss in me still. Lo
how the faithful after much pains taking and enforcing of theirselues above
all their strength, ought always to be of this mind to condemn themselves
when there shall be any faultiness mingled with the good which God grau^teth
them to do, and learn to yield themselves gilty before him, and to humble
themselves, what is the portion of God from above? what is the heritage of the
A^nightie of heaven. Job shows here, that his speaking is not to vaunt
himself before men, and to purchase himself reputation for his virtue and
holiness, as they do which seek but the praise of this world: but that he
has his eyes fastened upon God, and speaks as in Gods presence, desiring him
to be his witness and judge. And to that point also that the unrighteous man
shall be cut of. Wherein he shows, that he which has given his eyes to
vanity, is condemned for a sinner and a wicked man before God, notwithstanding
that he have not consented fully unto it. Let us bear in mind what has been
said concerning Jobs time. For although we know not whither he lived before
the law, or no: yet notwithstanding he lived before the Prophets times, as we
have declared in that mention is made of him as of a man of ancient time. And
so ye see that Job was in such time, as God had not yet given any large
vtteraunce of his doctrine: nor such light as came afterward. For the
Prophets did greatly inlighten the things that were dark in the law. Job lived
before their time, and therefore had but as it were some little spark in respect
of the doctrine that was afterward: and yet nevertheless he knew he could
not be tempted to any evil lust, but he should be blameworthy before God. And
what shall we be then, who have the sun of righteousness shyning upon us
in the highnoone day? For behold, Jesus Christ with his Gospel brings vsso
great light, as we have no excuse. If we say, I understand it not, it is too
high and profounde a matter: what have we not doctrine large enough, seeing
that Gods will is showed us too the full? How then should we be excused if we
knew no more than Job knew? And herein it is to be seen, how great and
horrible Gods vengeance is in the Popedom, seeing that those beasts durst
deny that a man sins when he is so tempted unto evil, and has such
provocation in him, and conceiueth so evil thoughts, sobeeit that he consent
not thoroughly to it. But Job who (as I have declared already) had no doctrine
at all in comparison of that we have, did nevertheless know this well enough.
And therefore let us look more nearly to ourselves: and seeing that God has
granted us such grace and privilege, as to make his truth much more known
unto us tha^ it was at that time: let us be watchful, and as soon as we open
our eyes and espy any vanity or evil affection in us, let us think with our
from above, from heaven. The repeating of this word here is no superfluous
speech. And why? For he makes a covert comparison between Gods judgment,
and the opinions that we can purchase before men. Ye see then that men may
justify us in all points, and not know our filthiness and poverty: by
reason whereof we shall be taken for little Angels, and thereupon think that
there is nothing amiss in us: but what have we gained by it? Nothing at all:
for behold how Job calls us up above. Very well: true it is that sinners may
perchance clear themselves and easily is there not a cutting off for the
unrighteous, and a punishment for such as commit crymes^doth not God look upon
my ways, and does he not number all my steps? Here Job expresses plainelye
the portion and heritage whereof he spoke. And it serves to wound us the more
to the quick by the feeling of our sins. True it is that he stands not
upon all the things that are spoken of in the law: another uses he so many
words: but yet does Cutting of imports more than heir and heritage. For (as
I have said) men bear themselves in hand, that they shall escape with some
light punishment: and like as when an offender is kept in prison and knows
not that he has deserved ha^ging, he bears himself in hand that he shall
escape with a whipping, or that he shall be banished: even so (say I) men
conceive not Gods wrath as it is, neither know they the punishments which
they are worthy of, because they think not of the everlasting death. We see
then how Job, after he had spoken of the portion which is prepared from above
for the wicked, does (not without cause) add, that there is a cutting of and
confusion to destroy them utterly. And hereby we know that Gods spirit
reproves us of rechlesnesse. If we were attentive at the first to know Gods
judgments, or at leastwise to understand our own faults: we should not have
need of the doubling of his words: it were enough for us to have been
warned in one single word. But after that the holy Ghost had spoken of the
portion that God prepares for all the despisers of his law: now he adds, a
cutting of, because we be as it were brutishe, and when a man tells us a
thing simply, we conceive it not, but are possessed with such dullness, as we
feel not the strokes of Gods hand, though he strike us hard. And how then
shall we be wounded as we ought to be, by the threatenings that he gives
us? surely if he do but speak, we will not be touched nor cast down in
ourselves, seeing that we cannot be sufficiently humbled by the blows of his
hand. And so let us mark well, that our carelessness and dullness are
reproved here. Wherefore let us wake, seeing that God calls upon us so
earnestly, and let us learn to think better upon ourselves. This is it that
we have too mark in this verse. In conclusion whereas Job adds, does not
God look upon my ways, and keep a reckening of all my steps? Let us mark
well that he applies the doctrine to himself, which he had set down in
general. For he had said, what is the hyre or portion of God from above? what
is the heritage of God from heaven? Job had spoken so of all men: and now he
applies the same doctrine to his own use, declaring to what purpose he had
spoken so: therefore as often as Gods judgments come to our remembrance,
whither men do ^^l us of the^, or we ourselves read the^: let us have the
wisdom to enter into ourselves, and to look every one upon his own person.
For Gods judgments must not lie as it were buried and never be spoken of: but
every man must make them auaylable to himself, and put them too his own
particular use. Ye see then how we have to mark, that after Job had set down
a general doctrine, he came by and by to the beholding of his own person,
saying: God sercheth and knows my ways: that is to say, forasmuch as God is
judge of all men, I cannot escape his hand. For does not God (says he) know
all my ways? and does he not keep a reckening of my steps? Thus much
concerning the first point. And as touching the second, let us mark also the
style that Job uses: which is that God marketh his ways and steps, and
keeps a reckening of them. For it serves too express* that God beholds
them not aloof, nor only looks upon the things that are apparent to the
world: but also looks nearly and narrowly to all our works, and notes
and marketh euerychone of them, and that his sight is not dim, nor vieweth
things at randon, but marketh, counts and numbreth all things, so as nothing
escapes him, another is any thing forgotten with him. Now then (I pray you)
have not we the better cause to consider our ways and to reckon our own
steps, when we see that all is present before God? what is the cause why me^
do scarcely know the hundredth part of their sins? yea and some man shall
commit one fault a hundred times a day, and

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so too feel them, that being
displeased with ourselves for them, we may learn to hate them and abhor them
more and more, and to follow that which he commands and appoynteth with
greater earnestness and affection, and therewithal that it may please him so
to reform us by his holy spirit, as he may reign quietly in us, and we be
joined to him in such perfection, as we may seek nothing but to be wholly
conformable to his righteousness, which thing shall then be accomplished,
when he shall have taken us out of this corruptible life. That it may please
him to grant this grace, etc.

The.Cij. Sermon which is the second upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
5 If I have vvalked in leazing, or if my foot have been hasty to deceyte.

6 Let God vvey my works in the ballaunce of Justice, and let him try mine
uprightness.

7 If my steps have turned out of the way: or if my heart have vvalked after
mine eyes: or if any spotte have cleaued to my hands.

8 Then] let me sovve and let an other man eat the fruit, and let my plants
be rooted up.


AFter that Job has protested that he had lived chastely, in such sort as his
eyes were not defiled with one evil look: now he adds, that he had lived
so that he had not beguyled any man, and that his foot had not stepped aside
at any time unto leasing or malice. And this is well worthy to be noted. For
one of the principal parts which God requires in his law, is that we should
have the said uprightness, that we walk not into bywayes and suttleties, to
draw our neighbors goods unto us: and surely it is a very difficulte virtue,
so to do, howbeeit that every man is desirous to be counted upright. For the
nature of man is always so given unto hypocrisy, that there is not so much as
one word to be heard, wherein there is not somewhat amiss: insomuch that
when we buy and sell with our neighbors, we are always disguysing of things
to draw all to our own profit. Seeing then that we perceive such a root of
deceitfulness in us, we have so much the more need to give our minds to
this uprightness and sou^dnesse, so as we may protest before God, that our
life has not swarued aside unto leazing. Also there is another reason: that
is to wit, that deceytes are worse than open violence: like as he that
kills a man by poisoning, is more faulty than he that slaieth a man with his
sword. And why? For this trayterousnesse of killing a man under the color of
making friendship to him, or of making him good cheer: is a very detestable
thing, and the crime is utterly unpardonable. Even so when a man beguileth his
neighbor by craftiness, and creeps into his bosom by suttletie, so as a
man cannot beware of him: is it not a sign of a more treacherous nature? These
two reasons therefore ought to teach us so to follow uprightness and
soundness* as our neighbors may not by any means be beguiled by us. And that
is the first thing which we have to mark here. Furthermore let us
understand, that truth is a precious thing before God, in so much that he
takes that name upon him when he intends to express what a one he is.
Needs then must untruth and guilefulnesse be so much the more detestable
before him, because they be full contrary to his nature. Also when it is said
that we must be fashioned like unto the let God wey all in the ballaunce of
justice, and let him try mine uprightness. This similitude of the ballaunce
is very notable: for it shows us what manner of justice we shall some meenes
or other of serving God, to say, this is good and I will do such a thing? It
is because all of them bring false weyghts and false balaunces. For every man
would prefer his own device, but God rejects and condemns every whit of
it. Therefore let us have the meekness to rule and govern our life by the
commandments of God: and then all his desire of having sundry means to serve
God withal, shall be laid away, and we shall have one common, certain and
infallible rule. And why? For there is but the only one ballaunce of Justice,
and let God try mine uprightness. Wherein Job shows, that it belongs
only unto God to judge whether we be good or evil. True it is that he
signifies two things: the first is, that God will not judge men's lives at
adventure, but only by his that God will try. By these words he signifies,
that all the tryalles that are made as now, have no certayntie nor any stay to
rest in, but that God will overthrow all. Wherefore let us learn to walk
in such wise, as we may protest before God, that all our laboring and
traueling has been toward him, that our desire has been to be subject unto
him, and that we have ever honored him as our guide and governor: Lo what we
have to mark in this streyne. And now Job adds consequently, if my foot or
pace stepped out of the way, or if my heart have walked after mine eyes, or if
any spot have cleaned to my hands. This is according too the talk which he
had concerning his uprightness and soundenesse: howbeeit he expresses the
thing yet more, which he had said before. And first of all he protests
that his foot stepped not out of the way. Verily we cannot live so perfectly,
but we must make many false steps, and oftentimes swerve to and fro, though
it be but through oversight and frayltie. But here Job declares that he
steppeth not out of the way: and he uses the similitude of way (as the
Scripture is wont to do:) and it serves to draw us the better too the obeying
of God. When as Gods law is called a way: I pray you ought it not to be as a
spur to prick us forward to walk as God has ordained? and ought it not
also to be a bridle to hold us in subjection? if we have occasion to go to
any place, do we not desire to keep the best way: yea and the shortest,
easiest and certaynest? And if any man beguyle us: are we not very angry with
him for it? And if we stray, does it not grieve us? In so much that every step
werieth us, and we think we have a clogge of lead at our heels, when we
know not whither we be right or whether we go out of our way? Seeing then
that men are so careful to know the right way in their trauayling, that they
may come well to their iourneyes end: is it not great pity that in the way of
our life, we are willing too go astray, and seem to be desirous of it? for we
are not only negligent of inquiring, to the intent we might not starte aside
nor step out of the way: but also when the way is before our eyes, so as God
points it out with his finger and calls us thither, incoraging us to follow
him and warning us to turn another to the righthand nor to the left, but to
keep on the hie way as he shows it us: we are not willing to take heed to
it. And the cause why the Scripture uses this similitude of a way, is to show
us that if we miss of our way, our ignorance can not excuse us. And why? If my
heart has followed mine ties. For hereby he meneth that he was notso evil
minded, as to consent to any of the vanities, which men conceive feel any
burning within us: and that it be not long of us that we have not the thing
which our liking lusts for: then does our heart walk after our eyes: that is
to say, our heart having conceived amiss, thought by reason of the eyesight
thorough the corruption of original sin, has followed it: that is to say,
has yielded to a motion which was contrary to Gods law: and we have not
bridled our affections in such wise, but that somewhat has stirred us up unto
evil. But if we have the conceyte to say, this is fair: and yet
notwithstanding do stop there: or else that if he had any spot cleaning to
his bands. This is yet one other similitude, whereby he meeneth to declare yet
better the uprightness of his life. For like as we handle things with our
hands: so also when we have to deal with men, all things that we deal
with, do as it were pass through our hands, and are handled by us. Job then
meneth that in his affairs and dealings with men, he was never stained with
any craftiness, violence, corruption or such other things. And surely that was
a great uprightness. Nevertheless we must always mark, that Job speaks
not of him self in way of boasting, but rather the holy Ghost intends
here to give us a myrrour of perfection, to the end that when we know there
is any spot in us, we should assure ourselves that God calls and summoneth us
to our account, and that we can not escape unpunished. For by and by there is a
curse added: let me sow (says Job) and let an other man eat, and let my
plants be plucked up, as if he should say: If I have labored to enrich myself
by unlawful gain, let God pluck away al my substance, and let all perish
and go to havoc. Ye see in effect what is showed us here. Now therefore
let us take heed^ to walk more carefully than we have done. For men dispatche
them selves thereof too lightly. If they have any mean trade of living, and
content them selves with it how so ever they fare: Straight ways they are
rightuous (so think they them selves) and there is nothing amiss in them. But
yet for all that, we must be feign to come to the balance, as I have
touched before. And because the law of God moves us not, the holy Ghost
adds one other help: which is, that in the example of Job, he shows us
how our life ought to be ruled. Thus ye see how by the way we have to
mark, that Job mente not to magnify him self, but to show in his own
example how we ought to live. Besides this also, although we have indeuered
to walk in such perfection as we have brydeled our affections, as our
wandering lusts have haried us away, as we have always preserved every man's
right, and as we have not used any craft or malice against any man: yet
must we always hang down our heads before God, as we have seen
heretofore. And if God scourge us, although it be not for our sins, but for
some other purpose, as namely to humble us, or to try our patience: yet must
we cast down our heads still, and furthermore acknowledge that we are always
guilty howsoever the world go, and that God shall always find some fault in
us, so as he might justly reject our whole life. Thus ye see how we ought to
practice this sentence. Nevertheless (to be short) it behooves us to have our
eyes always fastened to our hands: that is to say, to deal so purely in all
things that we take in hand, as our doings may not in any wise be stained:
but it is hard for us to have such a pureness: for look how many dealings
we have to do with, so many pieces of pitch do pass through our hands. And
how is it possible that we should escape without catching some spotte? God
therefore must be feign to work in that case, and too preserve us even after
a wonderful fashion. And it ought to provoke us greatly too prayer, when we
see there is such an vncorruptnesse required at our hands, and we draw
clean backwardes: in so much that we are so far off from being clean, as
we perceive not the spots and blottes that are in us. Then remains there
none other shifts, but to fly to God for refuge, not only to crave
forgiveness of the faults that are past, but also to desire him to guide us
by his holy spirit, and too keep our hands clean, so as we may be
restrained from all craftiness and malicious dealing in all things that we
have to do with men, what so ever they be. More over let us mark well the
curse that Job sets down here. For although he apply it but too his own
person: yet notwithstanding he pronounces generally what payment is

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him so to open our eyes, as we may walk before him, and as
it were in his presence, and that seeing he has showed himself so familiarly
unto us by his word, we also may behold him as he has declared himself
there: and that there with all we may make such a trial of our whole life, as
we may peceyue the wretchedness that is in us, and the miseries whereunto we
be subject, and fly unto the remedy which he has set forth unto us by his
goodness, which is to have recourse unto his mercy, and to pray him to
guide us in such wise by his holy spirit, that we renouncing all our wicked
affections, may seek to frame our selves wholly to his holy will, and to
walk under his obeisance, until we be come to the full perfection whereunto
it behooves us to tend all our life long, and which appears already in his
Angels. That it may please him to grant this grace, etc.

The.Cxiij. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
9 If my heart have been deceived in any woman, or if I have laid weight at
the door of my neighbor.

10 Let my wife grind unto another man: and let stranngers bovv down upon
her.

11 For that is a loocenesse and iniquity to be condemned.

12 It is a fire that deuoureth all too destruction: yea and which should
pluck up the root of my revenue.

13 If I have refused the judgment of my servant, or of my maid when they
striued against me.

14 What shall I do when God stands up? And what shall I answer when he
does visit me.

15 Has not he that has made him made me [also] in the womb? And has not
he fashioned us in the womb.


WE have here two protestations of Jobs making, which are worthy to be
marked. The one is that he had lived so chastely, as he was clear before Let
other men (says he) bow down upon my wife, and let her suffer that reproach,
yea and let me endure it as well as she. If I have been led away, or if I
have laid wait at my neighbors door, that is to say, if I have watched to do
him any harm. And afterward he declares why he abhorred whordom so much. For
(says he) it is a wickedness, yea and an iniquity that belongs unto
Judges* that is to say, which is worthy to be condemned. For it is a devouring
fire and a thing that would pluck up my wealth by the root. Thus ye see how
Job continued in chastity, and gave not him self to the filthiness of
whordom, because he knew it was a cursed thing, and such an offense as God
could not bear with. Now as touching the punishment which he sets that it
is an over great loocenesse, yea and an outrage worthy to be condemned: it is a
burning fire to devour al things even to destruction. This does us to
understand, that we must not judge of whore dome after the common opinion of
men which make but a sport of it: according as we see how the scoffers jest at
it, and many despizers of God, and heathnishe folk make but a game of it. Men
shall hear this devilish blasphemy, it is but a venial sin: It is to be
forgiven, and such other things: and these things have not begone of late
days. And that is the cause also why S. Paul having spoken expressly of
whoredom, says: My friends, beware ye be not tempted with vain words. For
by reason of such things the wrath of God comes upon the unbelievers. Satan
had at that time imbrued the world with such mockeries, that whordome was not
counted so horrible a thing as it ought to be. S. Paul says it shall be to no
purpose for me^ to babble and flatter themselves with such toys. And why? For
Gods wrath shall nevertheless have his course: and he has showed from time
to time, that he cannot bear with whordom. And truly we ought to mark first
of all, what it is to defile our bodies, which ought to be the temples of the
holy ghost. And other sins says S. Paul are committed in such wise, as the
soil and stain of them abides not so much in the body of man, as the soil
and stain of whordome does. For it seems that whores and whoremongers would
as it were wither their own bodies, to bear their shame and dishonestie in
them before God. If we considered well that by whoredom men do vnhalowe the
temple of God, and of his holy spirit, and dismember the body of our Lord
Jesus Christ: surely we would abhor that sin more than we do. Again, when
aduoutrie and whordome are matched together, it is a perverting of al right and
equity among me^ If a man rob another man of his goods, he shall be punished: a
thief shall be rebuked at al men's hands: he shall be cried out on, and men will
spit in his face: and yet aduoutrie is more tha^ a simple robbery. For therein
men rob not other men of their goods and substance only: but also of their
honor and honesty, and all* and they rob not only those that are borne, but
also those that are unfashioned in their mothers wombes. Again, is not marriage
a holy league or covenant, as our Lord names it in the scripture? If a man
falsify a covenant that is made in any bargayning, and selling, by conueying
some secret title or interest to himself, or by suborning some false
witnesses: it is and ought to be punished. But behold, the chief covenant
that can be in the world is broken and falsified: Solemn declaration is made
of the faith that the husband owes to his wife, and the wife to her husband:
they come into the Church as it were in the presence of God: and they call upon
him to be their judge, if either of them keep not the promise that he has
made: and yet notwithstanding, all this comes to nothing. So then if we
considered these things aright: surely whore dome and aduoutries that it is a
fire which deuoureth all too destruction, and plucketh up his wealth by the
root. Needs must men be worse than brutishe: if this at leastwise do not
waken them. For it is not only said, it is a loocenesse, or it is a sin that
deserves to be condemned: but it is a fire that consumes them selves to
chastity, not through a forced fear, but by knowing the grace and honor that
God has done unto them, in that it has pleased him to come unto them after
that sort. Therefore let them desire nothing so much as to come unto him by the
means of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus much concerning the protestation that
Job makes here of whoredom. And now let us come to the second protestation
which he adds: which is, that he was so far off from taking away of other
men's goods, that he used not any pride or cruelty eue^ toward those that
were his ^f^ (says he) have refused the judgment of my servant, or of my maid
when they striued against me. For the word strive which For (says he) he that
made them, made me also, we were fashioned all of one. This may be taken, that
we were fashioned all in one womb, that is to say, we come all of Adam, and
are all of one nature: Howbeit, it must yet extend further. Job then
considered two things when he bare so gently with his servants. The first
is, that we have one common creator, and are all come of one God: what shall
do when God comes to visit me? should he not lift up him self against me?
Might I be able to stand before his face? If he should call all my life to
acc^^nt, how could I answer, if I have been churlishe too my servants? Lo
here a text which imports a very great and profitable doctrine, if so be
that we can use it well. For if we ought too be so gentle toward our
inferiors, that when it lies in our hand to oppress them, we must of our
own accord be a law, measure, and rule to our selves: how gentle ought we
to be toward our equalles? For it seems that if any man be subject unto me,
I may use such authority over him: as he shall not speak, but I may do what
I list to him: according as we see how men bear them selves in hand, that
they may do much more than they may, and if God give them an inch of
authority, they take an el, so as there is no ho, nor measure with them. But
surely it behooves us to spare those that are our inferiors, and above whom God
has advanced us* And what then must we do, when we have to deal with our
equals or superiors? A master shall be condemned before God, if he oppress his
servant by violence, or if he be so presumptuous and stately, as he can not
abide that his servant should defend him self in a good quarrel. And what shall
become of the servant if he be stubborn against his master? What shall
become of the child that sets himself against his father? or of the subject
that rises against his Sovereign? Surely these things are less to be borne
withal. Then see we here a general doctrine common to all men: which is,
first that such as are advanced to any authority, must know that Gods
setting of them in that state, is not to give them the bridle to vex others,
and to trample them under their fete: but it behooves them to refrain them
selves always of lowlynesse and myldnesse. Mark that for one point. For the
authority which is amongst men, ought not to have such pre-eminence, that he
which serves, and is of low degree, should therefore be despized. True it is
that a man should be master of his own house, and there is no souereintie so
noble as that. And therefore a man would look too have him self only heard
and obeyed in his own house. Nevertheless, we see that a master has no
such power over his men and maids: but that he ought too hear them patiently
when any wrong is done them. Then if a man ought to use such gentleness
toward his underlings in his own house: what ought such to do which have
authority of justice? For they have no such power as masters have over their
servants. They have an honorable authority and pre-eminence: but that is not
to lord it over me^, so as others should be in bondage to them. Nay rather let
not kings and princes flatter themselves, neither let them bear them selves in
hand that the world is made for the^, but rather that they are made for the
multitude. Has not God stablished principalities and kingdoms for the common
welfare? It was not to advance two or three only above the rest: no, but it
was to the end there should be some order and state of government among men.
And therefore Kings and Princes ought to beware, that they live in such wise
over their Subjects, as they misuse them not, nor execute any tyranny over
them. For they shall be much less excuseable, than are the masters that deal
cruelly with their servants. And much less liberty have they which are
called to the state of justice, and set as Gods officers to yield every man
his right. If such forget them selves, or be carried away with pride, God must
needs punish them more roughly than the masters that have done any outrage or
wrong to their brethren that served them. Furthermore, is it so that such as
have any authority over others must not exalte them selves? What shall they
do then which are of equal state? How ought every one of us to live with his
neighbor? If a man exalte him self, whereas he ought too acknowledge him
self equal and fellow like, so as he plays the Bull: I pray you must
not such pride be tamed? And when a man that has nothing in him but headie
ye see what Job, (or rather the holy Ghost) meant to betoken in this streine,
when he says that he which created the master, created the servant also. So
then when we be touched with any vain presumption, to set more by our selves
than by other men, and to covet such superiority as every man should stoop
before us, and cast himself at our feet, and we our selves have our full
scope: let us come to this consideration: saying, yea although I be a master,
God has made my servant, and has fashioned him as well as me. When we
think after that

And so let us fall down before the face of our good god with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to receive us to mercy, and therewithal to pluck us
back in such wise to himself, as we may desire nothing but to submit our selves
wholly unto him, and that notwithstanding any authority which he gives as well
to one of us as to another over men, yet we may consider that there is one
mutual bond among us, and one of us is subject to another, to the end to
discharge our selves of our duty, and to walk after such a sort in brotherly
unity, as we may all of us with one common accord and (as it were with one
mouth) claim him to be our father. And so let us al say, Almighty God, etc.

The.Cxiiij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
16 If I have disappoynted the poor of his desire, or if I have vveryed the
eyes of the widow.

17 If I have eaten my morsels alone, and that the fatherless has not had his
part thereof.

18 (For from my youth he has been brought up with me as if I were his
father, and she has been with me from the womb of my mother.)

19 If I have seen a man perish for want of a coat, or the poor for want
of a garment.

20 If his loins have not blissed me, if he have not been vvarmed with the
fleece of my lambs.

21 If I have lift up my hand against the fatherless seeing my help at the
gate.

22 Let mine arm fall from my shoulder, and let mine arm be broken from the
bones.

23 For I have feared the punishment of God, and could not bear his burden.


Here Job shows what manner of louingnesse he had to succoure the poor and
needy. He had protested heretofore, that he had not done any man wrong: but
here he passes yet further, namely that pitying the necessity of such as
came too him for succoure, he relieved them of his own goods and substance,
yea even without making them to linger for If I have disappoynted the poor of
his desire: that is too say, if I succored not the poor when I saw him want
and needy: or if I have weryed the eye of the widow. For if we wait for
anything with a longing, our eye is always upon it, and when we look over
earnestly upon any thing, our eyes faynte and dazel. We see then how Jobs
meening is, that he hung not down his groyne in his bosom (as they say) when
poor folks came to desire his help, but succored them out of hand. Also he
adds that he saw not men sterue for cold which wanted raiment, but rather
dealt so with them as their loins and sides blissed him: that is to say, they
felt the favor which he showed them, They were warmed with the fleece of my
lambs: to be short, he says, that he had not eaten his morsells alone, nor
devoured by himself the goods that God had given him, but had given the
widows and fatherless part with him, whom (says he) I have brought up with
me as their father. Wherein he does us to wit, that he had bin a father to the
fatherless. From my mothers womb (says he) I have had the widow with me, I
have taken unto me the poor that needed suctour, and I have never failed
them. And if it be not so, let my shoulders fall out of the socket: that is
too say, let me be dismembered, and let me fall in pieces like a rotten carren.
Let mine arm (says he) be thrust out of the joint, and let the bones of it be
broken: Let the world see gods great and horrible curse upon me and my body,
(says he) if I have done wrong to those that were feeble, and I was always
afraid of Gods scourge, for I was not able to bear his burden. Herein he
declares as he has done heretofore, that it was not the respect of men, or
the shame of the world, or any other consideration that lifted him from doing
Alms imports as much as mercy. Now we see that among other tytles, God
chalengeth this unto himself, that he is gentle are clear quitte. For if God
had given us wherewith too help such as have need, if we do it not, we be
blameworthey. And why? For we have taken away Gods goods, and put them to
another use than he meant. If a servant be put in trust too receive his masters
goods, and his master has appointed him to give thus much to such a one, and
to pay such an other a sum of money that he owes: or if he have set him an
ordinary after what sort he will have his goods spent: if the servant play
the niggarde, so as one man comes crying after him, pay me: and yet not that
which is showed us here of Job. True it is, that although we have not this
perfection, yet will not God fail to accept us as I have said. Insomuch that
although our alms deeds be not such as they ought to be: yet will God take
them in good worth, so we have the said compassion toward such as are in
distress, that we indeuer to do them good, and that our doing of it be with a
cheerful mind. But in the mean while, if we cannot match Job to the full,
shall we not therefore follow him? Shall we not at leastwise labor aloof, to
fashion our selves after that he had not seen him perish^ which wanted
clothes: nor suffered him too sterue for cold, that had no raiment to cover
him: but their sides and loins (says he) has blessed me, and been warmed
with the fleeces of my sheep. Here Job shows that he had labored all kind
of ways too do alms deeds, not only in giving meat and drink to such as
were ahungred, and athirst, but also in clothing the naked. And truly if we
intend to be merciful, it behooves us to succor the necessities of our
neighbors, in such sort, as we see them: for it is not enough too succor
them in part. True it is that all men cannot do as Job did: for we have not
so many thousands of cattle as he had, who might have bin accounted amongst
the great Princes of these days in respect of his revenue: according as we see
he had not only yokes or hundreds of Oxen, but whole droues, yea as many as
could be kept in five or six Villages, or rather in a whole Country, which
was much more. For we have seen well enough, that his substance was only
Cattle, as the Cattle of a whole Country. Every man therefore cannot attain
to that. But howsoever the world go, let us consider our own ability: for
according there unto it behooves us to indeuer to do good, like as we know it
is said that the widow which gave but two mites, was more praised and
commended of Christ, than such as had cast in great sums of money. The reason
is, because she had given her whole substance, whereas the others had given
but a small portion in respect of their riches. So then let every one of us
consider his own state: and when we see our neighbors want either meat, or
drink, or clothes, at leastwise if we be not able to succor that their loins
blissed him. Wherein he declares that they had occasion too cun him thank
for that he had relieved them after that sort. And therewithal that the sides
or And on the contrary part let us mark, that although the poor ask not
vengeance against us, nor compain of us: yet notwithstanding their sides will
curse us in suffering smart, when we shet our eyes and have no pity of them,
but say, I am at mine ease, and I care not how othermen fare. Now if we have
been so cruel hearted: it is certain that when we vouchsafe not to succor
the poor and needy that sterue for want of relief, God will make their sides
and loins to speak, and although the parties themselves open not their
mouths to co^plain of our unmercifulness: yet notwithstanding the anguish
that they suffer, cries and complayneth before God, and vengeance ensues
according to the complainte: and it shall come so too pass, although men
speak not a word, as I have said before. Now after that Job has spoken so: he
adds, that he lifted not up his hand against the fatherless, no though he
saw his help at the gate: that is to say, although he could have done it
without punishment of men. For in those times men sat in justice at the gates
of towns, as places of most resort. Job then says truly, I could have made
one man quake, and another to run away, and I could have bin as thunder amongst
them, and no man should have opened his lips against me. Why so? For a man of
credit shall be borne with, and folk shall not dare complain of him: and if
they do, the judges shall not dare too redress it. Then although I had my full
sway, and that justice would have suffered all that I had attempted: yet
notwithstanding I abused not my credit, neither did I trample poor folk
under my feet. If there were a fatherless child, I sought not to profit my
self by him. For we know that fatherless children are oftentimes put to the
spoil. Job then shows, that he was of such an upright mind, that when he
could have taken away other men's goods, he never went about it, nor never
meant to make his own advantage of other men's cost: no not though he had
liberty to do it on man's behalf. Howbeit, he adds a reason why. For (says
he) Gods punishing and casting down of men made me afraid. As if he should
say, I did not respect whether men would speak evil of me or no: but only I
hilde mine eyes fast upon god who is my heavenly judge. And here we see,
first of all that there has bin great corruption in all times, and that such
men as have been ordained to yield every man his right, have not discharged
their duty therein. Then is it no new thing, if Judges do nowadayes reach out
their hand to the wicked sort, bolstring and bearing them in their wickedness.
For it has always been an ordinary custom. And therefore such as are in
state of justice, ought to look the better to themselves for the discharge of
their duty before God. But what? This corruption has reigned a long time, and
at this day it has full scope more than ever it had. If a man say: it makes
no matter, seeing the mischeef has bin of so great antiquity: truly it is
not to be excused for all that. Also there was not such knowledge of God at
that time, neither were men so well acquainted with the doctrine as they be
nowadayes. Wherefore if they that do now sit in the seat of justice, and
have the mace in their hand: do suffer extortions, or see a poor man trodden
under foot, and make no account of it: or wink at men in authority, when
they take more upon them, than becomes the^: what excuse is there for them,
seeing their ears are daily beaten with admonitions and warnings, and they are
told their duty both toward god, and toward the people that is committed to
them? Wherefore let us mark upon this doctrine, that if there were then such
corruption ordinarily in the world, that the Judges supported the wicked: it
behooves us to comfort every man himself, when we see the like confusion at
this day. And it mustnot grieve us overmuch, though we can getneither right nor
reason against such as do us wrong, nor be able to bring our matters about.
Then stands it that gods punishments made him afraid. Therefore let us learn
to walk in soundness, and in good conscience: and when we intend to do any
thing, let us examine whether God permit it or no: and if we see that it
displeases God, so as he has forbidden and disalowed it: let us let it alone:
and although men sooth us, yea and give us liberty to do what we list, yet let
us keep our selves from doing it. And why? For it behooves us to come before
the heavenly judge. And what shall it avail us then to have escaped the hands
of men? For it shall be but a doubling of the vengeance. And why? Because we
show well by our deeds, that we fear men more than God. And do you not see
how we offer him too heinous injury in preferring mortal creatures and
wretched carions before his Majesty? I shall be afraid of men, and in the
mean while mock God, and his Majesty shall be nothing with me. Again when
we have corrupted Justice either by hatred or by favor, or by some other
crooked means, so as we have won the Judges: see ye not yet a second
outrage which we offer unto god. Is it not a defiling of that which he has
hallowed? But justice is a holy thing: and we vnhalow it when we turn those
unto evil which are set in that seat, and whom God has appointed of
purpose, that the authority of his name should shine in them. If we (I say) do
go about to thrust them aside: is it not a point of high treason to God? And
for that cause I said that we do but double Gods wrath upon us, by shifting
our selves from men's hands after that sort. Ye see then that we must fasten
our eyes upon God, and look unto his judgment, to the intent we may of our
own free accord refrain from doing evil when we may do it, although the
same be permitted us on men's behalf. And therewithal also let us mark,
that this our fearing of Gods punishment, must not be only when we feel it,
but before it come at us. For it is too late for a man to feel that God is his
judge, when he is stricken with his hand: and therefore let us be afraid when
God threatens us, and before the strokes light upon our heads. Ye see then how
every man may refrayn from evil doing, if by the eye of faith they foresee the
punishments a far off, which are prepared for all evil doers, and for such
as trouble their neighbors. And God she weth us great favor when he warns
us aforehande, to the end we might prevent his vengeance. Thus ye see what we
have to bear in mind. And the conclusion which Job adds is this: how shall I
bear his burden? It is to show us that thing which is spoken to us by the
Apostle: namely, that it is a right dreadful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God. We are afraid of men's punishments which touch but the body:
and what is done for the fire of Gods wrath which consumes all things, and
yet never goes out, but burns in such wise as we must be forced to continue
in it, yea and to endure it without end? Why regard we not

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us feel them in such wise, as we may crave
forgiveness, and be so sorry for them, as we may indeuer our selves wholly to
amend them, and too profit from day too day in his obedience, until we be
fully reformed. And that we pitying such as are in necessity, may indeuer too
succor them, and be like minded unto them: praying our good God to have
pity upon them, and to succor us also: and that although we be unworthy of
it: yet notwithstanding, seeing he has already made us to feel his goodness,
and mercy, we may not doubt but he will bestow more and more upon us, and
increase his grace from day to day in us, if we flee to him for help with true
humility, according as he calls and allureth us daily unto him by his
word. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only to us, but also,
etc.

The.cxv. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the. 21. 22. and. 23. verses, and then upon the
text which is added here.

24 If I have set my heart upon gold, or if I have said to the wedge of gold,
thou art my hope.

25 If I rejoiced of being rich, or because my hand had found abundance.

26 If I have looked up to the shining Sun, or to the Moon vvalking in her
brightness.

27 That my heart has been deceived in secret, and my hand has come to my
mouth.

28 That were damnable wickedness, and I had denied the God above.


YEsterday we saw the protestation that That he had not put his trust in
gold, nor said unto his riches, I rest my self in you, nor rejoiced when his
goods increased. We have always too bear in mind what has bin showed
heretofore: that is to wit, that Job touched not some one virtue alone, but
comprehends generally the whole rule of good life which God has given us.
And in very deed it is not enough for us to have performed a piece of the law
(if at leastwise we were able to do it:) But it behooves us to indeuer to rule
and frame our life throughout according to all things which God commands.
In like manner then as Job has protested that he had not showed himself
cruel toward the fatherless and poor: so now he says, that he was not
puffed up with pride and presumption in himself, nor did set the more store by
himself, because he was rich. Surely this was a singular virtue. For we see
commonly, that if a man have some little thing to brag of, me^ If I have set my
heart upon gold: or if I have said too the wedge of gold, thou art my trust.
Here Job brings in a talk between himself and his money. Verily a man will
not talk unto his riches when he opens his chest and coffer: he will not
enter communication with them, as though he had some body to talk with him:
but in this manner of speech, Job does very well set forth the folly and
ouerweening of rich men in trusting too their riches. And why? They have there
as it were a secret conference and conspiracy with their gold and silver.
True it is that they speak not, but yet without speaking they cease not to
have the thing which Job shows here. Wherefore as often as we be tempted
to put our trust in creatures and earthly things: let us call too mind that it
is a robbing of God of his honor, and a purloyning of it from him, to give it
to a thing of nothing: and therefore let us abhor such dealing. Therewithal
also let us remember the condemnation that Job lays here upon us: and let us
compare our selves with him. What a shame is it that a man should advance
himself, and gaze upon his feathers, and think himself to be a ^oly fellow,
because he is worth I wot not what? Behold, Job possessed great treasures,
and had gathered gold and silver in heaps: and yet notwithstanding he always
hild himself in such lowliness, as if he had bin a poor man. What a shame
then is it for us to be lifted up with a little, seeing that Job was not
blinded with all the great abundance that God had given him? Mark that for
one point. And furthermore let us mark, that it is a great trial of a man,
when he is rich, and yet notwithstanding becomes not proud, but continues
always mild, and without presuming of himself, walks as if he were no
better than another man. Ye see here a good trial. And therefore let us not
think we have atteyned any great virtue, if we be not come to that point. For
there is not a man to be found in this City of Geneua, no nor in this whole
country, that is like unto Job. And truly if a man should gather all the
richest me^ together, they were (as you would say) nothing at all in comparison
of that which Job possessed. They that boast themselves nowadayes of their
riches, are as if they should think themselves to be great men, because they
be but mounted upon a blade of an Onyon, if a man should compare their wealth
with Jobs. But when our Lord does so hold me^ at so low an ebb: let them
assure themselves that it is for their profit, and that if they were in
greater wealth, they would burst: and it would be a cause of their decay, and
they would mount so hie, as they should break their neck. So then let us
mark, that our Lord procures our benefit and welfare, when he suffers us
not to mount so hie. For we could not weld our good fortune (as they term
it:) we see that although we have no occasion too advance ourselves, and that
our state be as simple as that Job did not put his trust in Gold, nor
vaunted himself though he saw he was rich. But yet is that well worthy to be
noted which he adds: that is to wit, that be rejoiced not when his hand
could heap up much, nor when goods came to him from all places: nor
rejoiced at all in that behalf. of rejoicing in God and not in riches. What
then does that import? That having an eye to God, who has given us the goods
that we possess, we should understand that therein he meeneth to show
himself a father toward us: and that seeing he is our father, it is good
reason also that we should be children on our sides toward him. But Gods
children we cannot be but we must use brotherly love toward men, bearing
in mind that the goods which we have, are laid as a pledge in our hand by
God for the releuing of our neighbors that have need.

And further let us understand, that God will not have us tied too these
earthly things. If we regard God, we will immediately have an eye too the
endless life that he has prepared for us in heaven: and then shall we not
be wedded too these corruptible things, neither shall we make riches too be
as dirt and mire too wallowe our selves in. Such as give their hearts over
unto riches, as it were in a quamyre, as men say here. For like as there,
after they have plucked out one leg, sincke deeper with the other, so as
they cannot get out: So those that put their trust in this world, are so
far unable too raise up themselves to Godwarde, that they stagger, stumble,
and reele: and to be short, cannot get out of the gulf wherein they be
plunged. On the contrary, behold here how our Lord offers himself to us,
and calls us to the heavenly life, as if he should say, hye you apace to
me, If I have looked up to the Sun when he shined, or to the Moon walking in
^ir light, or if I have laid my hand upon my mouth: for surely that were a
beynouse thing, it were a renouncing of God above. Some have expounded this
sentence, as though Job should protest that he had not worshipped the Sun,
and the Moon, because that in old time the same was a very common
superstition, specially in the East countries, and Job was of those parts, as
we have seen heretofore: and so it should seem that Job mente too declare
here, that he had not done as most men did among whom he lived, that is to
say, he had not wondered and gazed at the Sun and the Moon, nor attributed
any godly Majesty unto them, nor made Idols of them. And surely God tells
his people expressly by Moses, that they must not be so blind as to
woorshippe the Sun and the Moon. For what is the Sun? True it is that he
has a wonderful light in him, and that we see there some marks of Gods
glory. In like case is it with the Moon. And that also is the cause why it is
said, that they preach unto us, and that God speaks unto us, as it were by
their mouth, to the end we should be allured to come unto him. But
therewithal God says unto them: If you woorshippe the Sun and Moon, you
are unthankful. For to what end have I created and fashioned them? It is to
the end ye should know me, even me that am the Creator of them. If ye do
the contrary, your unthankfulness will be doubled. For what is the Sun?
your servant. What is the Moon? your handemayde. Wherefore does the Sun
shine, but to give you light, and to make the earth fruitful, according as God
gives him that use? So then, seeing that the creatures (how noble soever they
be) are subject unto us, and god has ordained the^ to do us service: Is it not
a foul unthankfulness for us to make Idolles of them? This exposition is very
true: but yet it agrees not to the present place. For here Job meant to use
another similitude, of purpose to go forward with the matter that we have
treated of already: namely that he had no presumption or pride in him. For
we see how the proud sort do cast up their nozes into the wind (as they
say) and take not themselves too be of the common rate of men, but make I wot
not what a stately countenance, as though they would separate themselves for
this mortal life. And their pride extends not only to their neighbors, but
they also look so lofty every where, that they preace before God with such a
stateliness, as the Sun and Moon (though they be far above us) are
notwithstanding not high enough for them, but they ouerlooke them, saying:
where are we now? Which of us is the greater? Which of us is the higher?
Job then meant to express men's foolish hautinesse in aduauncing and setting
out themselves out of measure, and (too be short) in that they vouchesafe not
too hold themselves in the common train, but would be greater than God
grants them to be. Thus ye see what it is too look up too the Sun when
he shines, and unto the Moon when she walks in her brightness. And yet
nevertheless, we see that our Lord gives us there a token of our feebleness.
For we cannot look upon the Sun, but our eyes are dimmed out of hand.
True it is that God would have us to rejoice in the light of the Sun, and
that his heart was not beguiled in secret, so as his hand should be laid to
his mouth. When he says that he was not beguyled in secret by his heart:
It serves too express the better, that he had not only been courteous and
lowly toward men, but also had been continually as a little one before God,
notwithstanding that men praised him: and that although every man did that he
kissed not his hand, or that his hand came not too his mouth too be kissed.
Some expound this saying, that he commended not his virtues to make them
meritorious, or to settle the trust of his welfare if my mouth have kisse^ my
^and, that is to say, If I have leaned to mine own credit or to any thing
else, or if I have been so beastly as too make Idolles of my goods, and to
honor them, (for this word kiss betokens to do homage, or honor.) Then if
my mouth have kissed my hand: that is too say, if I had that vain self
trust that I did any homage or honor to my self: If I have done so (says
he) let God curse me. For out of doubt, that were a renouncing of the living
God, or the Souereyne God. Here we have too mark, that the said
highmindednesse is an intolerable thing before god. And this manner of speech
of looking up to the Sun which Job uses, is to be marked well. True it is
that naturally our countenance looks upward, and that God would there should
be a difference between us and the brute beasts in this behalf. For he has
given the beasts as it were hanging looks, because they look but downewarde
too the ground: but man has his countenance lift upward, because he looks
for a better and excellenter state in heaven: And in very deed it is to the
intent we should always look up alofte, too seek God and his heavenly
kingdom: but in the mean while this is no let, that we should not humble our
selves. And this also is the cause why David protests, that he meddled not
with great matters, nor with wonderful things that were to high for him.
This manner of speaking is partly like unto the similitude that Job uses.
David says, Lord thou know I have not walked in great things. How so? Is
it not lawful for men too deal with great matters? The state of justice is
honorable, and the carrying about of Gods word is a great thing also: and
to be short, there is not that man which finds not some let in his
vocation. If a man instruct others, or if he take upon him but to teach
children in a school: either of them both are creatures fashioned after the
image of God, and he ought too refourme them: And is not that a great matter?
If a man have a whole Country to guide, is it not an excellent matter? Yes,
but David speaks of the puffing up of the heart when we would advance our
selves. For we know that he had to deal with matters of great weight* and
therefore he adds, nor in wonderful things that are above me: that is to
say, I had no desire to deal with the things that passed my capacity. And Job
says here, I looked not up to the Sun: that is to say, I did not cast up my
noze, nor play the royster to advance my self against God, of all the time
that I was in reputation of the world. Hereby then we see (as I touched
before) that this foolish lust of men to make themselves esteemed is an
intolerable thing before God. What is too be done then? It behooves us to
come to the remedy, which is lowliness. Seeing that God forbids us to
lift up our countenances on high, let us cast them down with our own good
will: For we have sufficient cause so to do. If we looked well upon our
selves, we would continually practice this proverb, namely, that he that
knows himself best, will set least store by himself. But forasmuch as we
are loathe to know ourselves, and what our state is: It is no wonder though we
be so carried away with this foolish pride, as we could find in our hearts
to stie above the Clouds. Wherefore let us mark, that it stands us in
hand too examine well our own wantes, to the end we may be restreyned to
all modesty, and be able to protest that we have not cast up our heads, but
that we have always looked downward in acknowledging that we have not whereof
to make any boaste. Mark that for one point. Secondly, when it is said, that
Jobs heart was not led away in covert. Let us bear in mind, that humility
or lowliness consists not only in the outward appara^ce toward me^: for we
shall see

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them better than we have
heretofore done: and that seeing we be so miserable, we may thoroughly consider
our own wantes, and learn too shake off all pride: and that forasmuch as our
Lord shows us so often that all our welfare, felicity and glory consist in
him, we may learn to seek them there, and so to mortify al our fleshly
lusts, as Jesus Christ may reygne there peaceably, as unto whom all sovereign
dominion is given, to the intent that all knees should bow before him: and that
inasmuch as it behooves us to pass through this world: and the things that
may hold us back there, are all convenient for the necessities of our life,
he suffer us not to be still entangled in them, but that we may travail
toward the heavenly kingdom, and so use the creatures which he has ordained
to our use, as we may not make them Idolles, and that we may another thorough
misgouernment nor thorough any other outrage be wedded to this world, but so
pass thorough it, as we may always still go forward to be gathered up into
the everlasting rest which is purchased for us by our Lord Jesus Christ. That
it may please hin to grant this grace, not only to us, but also too all
people and nations of the earth, bringing back all. etc.

The.cxvj. Sermon, which is the sixth upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the 26. 27. 28. verses, and then upon the text
which is added here.

29 If I rejoiced at the adversity of mine enemy: or were glad when evil
befell him:

30 Or if I have suffered my mouth to speak evil of him, or to utter curses
against him:

31 If my household folk have not said, who shall give us his flesh to eat?
we are not satisfied:

32 If the stranger did lodge in the streate, or that my gate were not open
for them that trauayled by the way.


I Have begone already to expound the sentence where Job protests that he
looked not up too the Sun and the moon. And the effect of my saying was that
he declares thereby that he was not puffed up with pride as those are which
presume upon themselves and think they are of that that were a renouncing of
God on high. For he had said before, that it was a heinous offense and
worthy of death. And here we see, how God abhors that highmindednesse
of men, when they would advance themselves above measure. And thereof we may
gather, that lowliness is a sacrifize most acceptable too him of all others.
Also of our own nature we do not easily abace our selves: in this behalf
it behooves a man to be as it were brought too nothing, that he may not
esteem of himself, if he intend too be taken and reputed for humble before
God. For humility or lowliness is not an imbacing of our selves when we
have wherewith too magnify our selves: but it is an acknowledging that there
is nothing but wretchedness in us,

Thus ye see what the true and right humility or lowliness imports, namely
that a man should not esteem of himself, according also as in very truth we
have no reason so too do, and whosoever sets by himself must needs be
over blind and brutishe. For he

And therefore as for those that flatter themselves nowadaies thorough
ouerweening: they not only beguyle themselves, but also rob God of his
honor, and by that means become rank traitors too him, and moreover

Therefore let us mark well, that it is impossible for

Furthermore let men esteem as much of themselves as they list: and yet
for all that they shall feel God against them as their mortal enemy too
their utter confusion. For he that exalts himself, rusheth against God:
but he that humbles himself, leans under his hand. If we know our own
wretchedness, it will as it were beat us down: and then will God reach us
his hand too lift us up and too set us in his lap. But will we needs go
about too trust too our own strength? It will be too hard an encounter
for us: which shall serve too break our heads be we never so proud. For
God must show himself our adversary when there is such presumptuousnesse
in us. Ye see then what we have too remember in this streyne.

But let us mark that this looking up too the Sun and the Moon, (that is
too say, men's loftiness in presuming upon themselves) may be of two
sorts: the one is, when under color of their riches, or of some honor
wherein they be placed, they forget themselves and think not any more that
they be mortal creatures. When they are come to that point, God may well
punish such blind pride, according as it is a fond thing and worthy to be
scorned of the whole world. For what is our life? or what are all the
appurtenaunces of it? But there is an other manner of pride: which is, that
men so flatter themselves, as they think they have both wisdom and power
too govern themselves, and that they can deserve much to godward. Now when men
presume so far of themselves: as too challenge the praise of their own
salvation, they must needs stumble with a deadly fall: because the principal
point which God reserueth to himself, is that we should know our selves to be
in state of damnation, and utterly forlorn and past recovery, and that we
should recover no hope but only in his free goodness. When this doctrine is
defaced: it is as much as to exalt men to the end that God should be brought
too naught, and it is all one as if men would put Gods honor to the spoil.

Wherefore let us learn too cast down our heads, assuring our selves
that if we could glory in God alone, being beaten down in our selves and
having corrected the foolish self weening wherewith we be puffed up: God
would relieve us and make us partakers of his glory, and we might believe that
all the goods which he has, do belong unto us. Have we nothing on our side?
God is rich enough to supply our wa^ts, and we may assure our selves, that he
will not fail us in any thing, according as the Scripture says, that
although men be poor and wretched, so as there is nothing in them whereof they
may boaste: yet notwithstanding God is their glory and will cover al their
uncleanness, so as they shall not be ashamed to go cheek by cheek with the
Angels of heaven, as Gods children and members of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus
much concerning the humility or lowliness that I spoke of. And when Job has
spoken so, he adds an other protestation: which is, that he rejoiced not
when any inconvenience happened to his enemies, nor was glad when he saw
the^ fall, nor had given his mouth leave to cast foor^h curses upon them: yea
and that he had so persisted in that mind, that he had not given ear too his
household servants to provoke him to revenge: but did nevertheless restreyne
himself, which we have to note, is that those which lived under the law
offended God when they intended to revenge themselves: and therefore what shall
become of us which have such a declaration as I have told you already? Howbeit,
it is not enough for us to bear our enemies no evil will: but we must also
have a mind to seek their benefit and welfare. And this is well worthy to
be noted. For diverse have tho^ght they should be discharged before God, so
they ran not with naked sword against those that have offended them or done
them any wrong. As for be punished as it were by the chief court of justice.
But Jesus Christ leuing the similitude, says plainly, that such a one is
worthy of hell fire. He meeneth that all three are worthy of it, but yet
notwithstanding he shows the degrees of the evil. Then if a man have any
sudden choler: although the same settle not in his heart: yet ye see he has
already deserved everlasting death before God. How shall we do then if we
foster deadly hatred in our hearts and be full of venomous rancour to be
revenged of them that have done us any wrong? wherefore let us learn to that
his household servants had been as fyrebrandes too provoke him, and would
feign have had him revenge himself: and yet for all that he had not been
moved a whit as he says. Some understand this sentence very rudely: as
though Jobs servant should be grieved with him for entertayning strangers to
courteousely, and therefore wished him dead for the pains whereunto he did
put them. But that is quite from the matter. For Job meneth to declare no more
here, but that although his servants provoked him too revenge when they saw
men do him harm and wrong: yet notwithstanding he refrayned himself, and
yielded not to such temptations. And this is well worthy to be noted: for it
was an excellent virtue in him, to be less moved with the wrongs that were
done to him, than his household servants were. There is no man but he takes
his own wrong so to heart, as other men cannot pacify him. It may perchance
be said to a man that has a displeasure done him, stay your self, I will
take the wrong as done to my own person, let me alone with it, I will revenge
you well enough: but yet cannot that content his mind, his affections are so
far out of order. But we see contrariwise that Jobs servants were grieved
when men did wrong to their master, and not he himself: and therefore it must
needs be said, that the spirit of God wrought in him after a singular and
wonderful fashion. Howbeit we must mark by the way, that he does not
vaunte himself here to purchase estimation: but is set forth as a mirror
and pattern for us, as if God had set him upon a scaffolde to the end we
should labor too fashion our selves like unto him, and be out of all doubt
that there is no excuse for us, if we follow not such an example. What is
to be done then? Although we have temptations to provoke us too revenge our
selves of our enemies, yea and that men also do prick us forward and inflame
us, and other some also do flatter us in our sins: yet must we not therefore
believe such flatteries, but we must settle our eyes and minds upon God. For
what is the cause that men do so easilye pardon and justify themselves when
God condemns them, but for that they give ear too such as come too pick
thanks by tale bearings? And why? is not that lawful for us to do? Specially,
if I have done you wrong: why should you not seek your revenge and requyte
like for like? there needs no retoricke to persuade us too do harm to our
enemies: for there is not that vain nor sinewe in us, which is not forward
enough that way: yea, we are rather to furious in that case. And yet in the
mean while behold what advocates do come too cloak our vices by soothing us
up in our sin. So much the more then behooves it us to mind diligently
what our Lord Jesus Christ commands us: namely to love our enemies in such
wise as our ears be stopped against all things that may be alleged to us by
men. So that if there be any folk that flatter us, and seem maynteyners of
our honor and profit, and that they could that the stranger was not lodged
in the streates, but that his gate was always open to him. Here Job declares
that he was freendly to such as had no mean to recompense him: and that also
is the very effect, whereby we show that we have a right charity toward men.
For if we do good to such as are able to requite it, and to such as are allied
unto us, either by kindred or by some other bond: it is no true and perfect
proof of our charity. True it is, that that freendlinesse is good, if it be
ruled according to godliness: but yet it is possible that in so doing we shall
have more regard of ourselves than otherwise, like as we

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may be sorry
for the vices that have reigned ouermuche in us, and do yet still reygne: and
that we may flee for refuge to his mercy: and that therwithall it may please
him to tame and mortify all our wicked affections, and to bear with our
infirmities, guyding us to himself, and drawing us nearer and nearer unto him,
until we be come to the end of the race whereunto we travel all the time
of our life. And so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly father, we
acknowledge and confess according to the truth, that we be not worthy to
lift up our eyes to Heaven, etc.

The.Cxvij. Sermon, which is the seventh upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
33 If I have hid my sin as every man does, or put mine iniquity in my
secret:

34 Though I were able to break a great throng: yet the despized of houses
astonished me, I kept silence, and I went not out of my door.


HEre we have a protestation well worthy to be noted. For Job shows us by
his own example, that when we have that he had not hid his sin, nor laid
it up in secret. That is to say, he had not labored to clear himself before
men, but had yielded himself guilty, and acknowledged his offenses. Mark
that for one point. Therewithal he shows how men are attainted with the vice
of hypocrisy, and that it is their fashion to deny things, and to use
startingholes, so as their faults be put under foot. In this place he has
used the word Adam, which signifies a man, and is sometimes taken for every
man. In this text Job meant too say, that there shall never be any found so
well touched, as to acknowledge may become their own judges, and obtain mercy
of the heavenly judge by returning unto him. To be short, we see that
hypocrisy is condemned by this text. The best for us were to absteyne utterly
from sin, and to keep our selves from it. But forasmuch as we be so frail
as we cannot live in this world without taking many falls: the remedy is
to stoop and mourn before God, and moreover not to go about too save our
honesty in such wise before men, as we should not yield our selves guilty as
often as need shall require. True it is that God that Job did not put his sin
into his secret. This imports very much: For men cannot beguile God, but
they beguile themselves, and thereupon it seems too them that they have
gained much, when they can put their sins out of their mind too think no
more upon them. If a man can forget himself and cast his faults behind his
back, or thrust them under his foot without thinking any more upon them: then
is he no more sad, then feels he no more grief, but is sotted in his
wickedness, he is as it were stark rotten, and feels not any more of it.
But yet in the mean while God ceasseth not to do the duty of a judge: For
all things are registered before him, and although he make no countenance for
a time, yet must all come too an account before him. Men could find in their
hearts to be always hidden, that is too say, not too see their faults, and
then they think they shall never come to light. But their sin continues
still, and although it be buried in respect of men, yet will God bring it to
light. Job then shows here, that men do but beguile themselves by covering
their sins after that sort. For they must needs appear and be brought too
light, howsoever the world go. Then let us remember, that it is best for us too
vncloke our own faults, that God may deliver us from them. For if we bring
them before him with a free heart, and condemn the evil that is in the^: it is
certain that they shall be utterly don away if we require it. Therefore let us
condemn the evil where we find it, to the end we be not condemned of God. For
as long as we do hold our hearts so close, and labor to conceal our faults
in the^: it behooves God to fight against us, and us to feel how it belongs
to him to scatter the clouds, and to pluck away the figleaues wherewith we
shall have covered our dishonesty, insomuch that we shall be enforced to perceive
it spite of our teeth, and it shall be known both to me^ and Angels. This is it
that we have to remember in this streyn, where mention is made of putting a
man's sin into his secret. To be short, it will happen unto the^ as it does unto
those that hide a sore. The sore is hidden in the body, and yet in the mean
while there is no mean made to purge it, but a man covers it in such wise as
it shall not be known, and yet the infection doubleth for all the cloking of
it, and the rancor of it increases more and more for want of clensing of it.
It were better that it were opened: for then should it have some issue to purge
it self, which thing it cannot do, because the disease is so pent up within.
Even so fare we when we go about to hide our faults. For then is there as it
were a rotten sore, and we would feign hold it in by force, and our stryuing
to keep it secret, breeds a greater rankling, which causes the mischief
too increase and inflame more and more. What is to be done then? There is no
means but that which I have spoken of: which is, to come before god and not to
be ashamed to confess our wretchedness to the end that he may remedy it as
he knows most convenient for us: and also to become our own judges, for he
is so gracious unto us, as to make us our own judges: and instead of
condemning us, he is ready to acquit us. On the contrarypart, drag we back
as much as we can, we do but offend our God, and provoke a greater vengeance
against us. And that is a cause, why it is not for us to shet up our faults in
secret as we are wont to do. And here is mention made expressly of our
hydings, clokings or couerts, because men of their own nature do find many
pretty shifts and sleightes to shun Gods presence: yea for a while. True it is
that we may well shrink aside, but yet does God see us thoroughly. Nevertheless
(as the Prophet Esaias says) the wicked do dig themselves caves, and when they
think no more upon Gods judgment: then it seems to the^ that they have very
well shifted off the matter. And further if that serve not their turn, they
fall to the flat contrary, and run up and down, and when they find any new
mousehole or cranie, then are they safe, (so bear they themselves in hand,)
and if they cannot hyde themselves altogyther, that although he had bin able to
break a great throng: yet he feared the veriest rascolles, and went not out
of his house. Hrwbeeit before we pass any further, let us mark what manner a
man it is that speaks. It is Job, who had lived an Angel amongs men, and had
behaved himself so incorruptly, as his like is hardly too be seen through
the whole world: and yet notwithstanding he says, that ^e hid not his faults.
How shall we do then? For if a man compare the rightuousest and perfectest men
with Job, he that he had feared the veryest rascat^es of all men,
notwithstanding that he was able to break and bear down a greas throng of
people. This text is taken otherwise of some men. For the Hebrew word that Job
uses* here (I mean the word which I have translated to break or burst
asunder) signifies sometime to fear or be afraid. So then the said word
signifies both to fear or be afraid: and also to oppress, bear down,
trample, tread under foot, break, broose, or burst asunder. Some therefore
expound it as though Job declared that he had not feared a great multitude:
that is to say, that he was never abashed to rebuke evil wheresoever he saw
it: according as when we be zealous to Godward, it is certain that we will
not suffer any man to offend him without setting our selves against him: or
seeing that God has done us the honor to make us his advocates: we cannot at
leastwise but declare our misliking of the evil, and indeuer to stop it as
much as may be possible, putting the lesson in ure which Saint Paul shows
us in saying that we must not have fellowship with the fruits of darkness, but
must reprove them. Many therefore do expound this text as though Job protested
that he had set hi mselfe against evil, and let it by all means
wheresoever he found it: and that although he might have purchased himself
displeasure and hatred of the whole world, yet notwithstanding he ceased not
to condemn the evil always where he found it: and this doctrine is good
and profitable. And surely we see how necessary a thing it is to stablish
our selves in such steadfastness. For if we intend to stop evil doing: we
must have the whole world, that is too say, most men our enemies. True it is
that God commands us to seek peace with all men as near as we can. But
when we do our duty in that behalf, we shall be sure to set the whole world
in our tops, if we go about to rebuke sin. For we see how every man
flattereth himself, and corrections are so hard and bitter, specially now
adays as no man is able to suffer them. Then seeing it is so, we had need to
settle our selves in such stoutnesse, that although the whole world should
rise up against us, and all men without exception should labor to oppress us,
yet we should not swerve aside, but persist even to condemn the evil. This
doctrine surely is good and profitable: but if we consider the order of the
text: we shall find the natural sense to be that which I have touched. The
first word that Job uses here signifies, when, if, for* albeit, or although.
Some think that by this protestation Job meant to deny that he stood in fear
of any never so great a multitude: for the Verb that comes after the first
word (as I said) signifies to fear: howbecit the commonest signification
of the first word is the same that I spoke of Albeeit, or Although: and
thereunto the Verb does commonly signify to break. And so I see Jobs meening
is that although he were able to break and scatter a great throng of people,
that is to say, although he were of great might, credit and authority: yet
notwithstanding he did not ouerawe men to stop their mouths, but abaced
himself so far, as to fear such as were most despized and as it were the
ofcastes, rascals, and common laughing stocks. This proves well his former
saying. For it is a very good sign that Job meant not to hide his face, seeing
he had the mildness to fear the basest sort. We despised: for behold, the
cause that makes us so proud that we cannot be corrected: is our looking
what men are, whether they be our equals or no. And if they seem no better
than our selves: we think they have no advantage over us. Shall such a one
take upon him to rebuke me? Is he better worth than I? And furthermore we be
not contented to esteem men as our equalles, though they be much our betters,
but we cast them under foot. For we can good skill to note other men's
vices, yea and to inhaunce them, saying: Who is he? do not men know that he
has done many things amiss? And in the mean while our own faults be
smoothed: all is clear in us, and vice is made vrtue. This is the things that
rocketh us asleep in such pride as we cannot receive any yoke or correction,
when God sends men unto us to find fault with us, and to show us, how
greatly we be to blame. And therefore so much the more behooves it us to mark
how Job says here: I feared the most despised, that is too say, even such
as were as the offscourings and filth of the world, yea even the veriest
rascalles in whom there was no dignity nor any thing else. By this we see
that if God do us not the honor too warn us by men of great estimation and
credit: It does not therefore follow that we should despise the warning that
other men give us. And for proof hereof, the firsthing that we ought to think
when any man reproves us, is that he is a messanger sent unto us of God:
insomuch that if a little child should speak to us, and our conscience tell
us that he says truth, we resist God if that he went not out of doors: he
meeneth not that he used any back shrinkings, but that he refrayned himself
willingly: suffering himself to be condemned without gainsaying, and hyding
himself as a man convicted. This in effect is the thing that we have to note.
True it is that a man may sometimes hyde himself, and yet not cease to chawe
upon the bit, and to seek reuengement against such as have defamed him. But
whereas it is said that Job went not out of his doors: It is not meant that he
did it to the end he would not hear his reproach, and in the mean while
practice to be

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of his sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as being convicted of
them, we may not follow our father Adam in using outleapes too think that we
shall be quiet by shrinking aside from them, but rather that we may consider how
we be more than damnable: and thereupon flee only to his mercy, and also
learn to be sorry and to feel our own shame before men, to the intent that when
we have discovered them before God and his Angels, we may bow under his
majesty which shall not be dreadful unto us, because we be reconcyled unto
him by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ: And that forasmuch as we cannot
live in this world without feeling our vices and imperfections overmuch: it may
please him to guide us continually by his holy spirit, until he have clothed
us thoroughly with his own righteousness. That it may please him to grant
this grace. etc.

The.Cxviij. Sermon which is the eight upon the.xxxj. Chapter.
35 Oh that I had somebodie to hear me, my mark is that the almighty should
answer me. Let mine adversary wright a book.

36 If I bear it not upon my shoulders, I will take itto me as a crown.

37 I will reckon all my steps, I will present my self to him as a prince.

38 If my land cry out against me, or if the furrovves thereof do weep
together.

39 If I have eaten the foy son of it without silver, or if I have oppressed
the owners of it with sorrovv.

40 Let it bring me forth thistles in stead of wheat, and darnell in stead
of barley. This is the end of Jobs words.


WE have seen heretofore how Job co^plyned that God harkened not too him that
he might obtain reason at his hand. Truly in saying so, his intent was not to
blaspheme, as though God had bin cruel and unjust to him: that all his desire
was that God should answer him. Wherein he does us to wit, that if God
would be so gracious to him as to show him why he was so tormented: that
knowledge should suffize him. Howbeit that there was no apparent reason why he
should be handled so roughly, seeing his life had bin without blame, and that he
had indeuered answer may be expounded two ways: that is to wit, that God
should come before him as his adversary party, and lay forth his reasons and
articles: or else that he should answer, that is to say, that he should
declare himself to be on Jobs side. Howbeeit, forasmuch as heretofore he
has oftentimes said, that if God would condescend to show the cause of that
his justice, it should suffice him: I take this text as if it were said, I
desire no more but that God should show me the reason why he scourges me:
For as for in let him make a great book of it: It shall not grieve me to carry
it upon my shoulder. For it shall be no heavy burden to me, but rather it
shall be a crown to me, and an orname^t to deck me withal. Now we see in
effect what Job meant to say namely that he had bin no such man as he was
reputed and taken to be: according as we see how his friends condemned him for
a reprobate, because he endured so great torments, and it seemed unto them
him, is not to our great confusion? And this doctrine is well worthy to be
noted. For we see how men do daily fall to murmuring and grudging in
themselves. And what else is that, but to provoke God, and to desire to go to
law with him? But shall we bring our matters well to pass? True it is that
they which skirmish after that fashion when they be afflicted, say not that
they would have God to be against them: but in the mean while, that is the
mark which they shoot at. For if a man be impacient in his affliction, and
hold not himself in quiet My mark (says he) is that the almighty should
answer me. If mine adversary wright a book, and it behoue me to bear it, I
will not be ashamed to carry it. I shall not be like an offendour that is
indyted and condemned: but that book shall rather maynteyne my soundness: I
durst (says he) dock my self with it as with a crown. When Job speaks so,
he meeneth that all the accusations which were laid against him, were false:
and that he had been wrongfully but would have their shame covered, and yet in
the mean while they themselves blaze it abroad, so as every man knows it.
We must not go that way to work, but every man must in that case judge of
himself as he ought to do of his neighbors: and we must learn to condemn
the evil, and to allow the good, without accepting of persons. Lo after what
manner we may maynteyne a good quarrel. And that is the cause why Job says,
if God would answer me, though all the men upon the earth should bend
themselves against me, and that mine adversary party, that I shall take it as
a crown to deck me withal, It shall be an ornament unto me. But herewithall
let us mark also, that when we intend to mainteyne our own innocence: It is
not enough for us, to hyde our shame before men: but our princypall point must
be, that God may be as our warrant, and answer for us. True it is that the
answer where of Job speaks, is meant as I have declared: that is to wit, that
God should as it were enter an ordinary process against him, and show that he
will bear the book that shall be made against him as a crown, that is to
say, the process whereby he shall be charged after that sort with his faults: It
is not meant that it is always an honor unto us before men too have a good
case. And surely it is impossible to find a better case than Saint Paul's
was, and that he had served God faithfully in his office, and yet
notwithstanding he failed not to be charged and accused falsely. And what does
he? For as much as he sees that men are blind and ignorant, and judge
wrongfully: he appealeth to the day of God. I appeal (says he) to the day of
the Lord. Ye see that saint Paul is constreyned too use such remedy,
according as oftentimes it comes to pass, that we be defaced, and that the
world holds us for wicked, so as we be disgraced, because the wicked are so
shameless, that all is one with them to speak evil of men by hook or by
crook. But yet in the mean while we shall not cease to go still with our
heads upright. And why? For we may appeal unto God for our warrant, as we
see the Prophtes do. When Jeremy says, Lord if I be a deceyuer, thou have
deceived me: It is because it was laid to his charge that he did nothing but
beguile the people. Well (says he) if it be as you say, then has God
deceived me. When he speaks after that manner, he meeneth not that there is
any deceyt or guile in God, but he does boldly repress all the slanders that
were laid upon him, saying: Arm your selves against God, for I know that he
will maynteyne my quarrel. And Esaias reporting that he was rejected of men, and
as greatly reproched and despised as could be: says, yet will the Lord answer
for me. So then whenever we be defaced and oppressed by men, and blamed by
the whole world: yet shall we not fail to have a crown of glory, if we have
record before God. And that is the cause why Job says that he will
overthrow all the slanders that shall be laid against him. No no (says
he) I will not come as an offender that is condemned already in himself, before
that informations be put in against him (for he is convicted in his own
conscience of the misdeede that he has done:) but I will come as a Prince.
And undoubtedly the children of God are the judges of their judges when they be
wrongfully oppressed by men. It is certain that they dare more boldly appear,
referring themselves wholly unto God, and resting in him, than those dare which
condemn them through malice, violence and tirannie. Whereas the enemies of
the truth do now adays condemn the faithful to be burned, and in doing
thereof do sit under their clothes of Estate: do we not think that gallows is
more honorable whero^ a martyr shall be tormented, or a stake that is set up
for a child of God to be turned at? Yes: For that surmounteth all the thrones
of the world. Kings and Princes together with all their judges, must needs
through their wickedness vnhallowe the seats that are hallowed and dedicated
unto God. And forasmuch as they sit in them, they must needs be full of
filthiness and infectio^, because they follow concerning the reckening of all
our steps) let us be ready to yield an account whenever we shall be
accused of any crime. Let us not think too escape Gods judgment by concealing
any misdeede in us: but let us consider that it behooves us to answer for
ourselves, and that although men do justify us, yet they cannot hyde the
things that are in us from God. Now after that Job has spoken so, he added his
last protestation for a full knitting up. If my land (says he) have cried
against me, or if the furrows thereof complain that I have eaten the foyson
of it without money, or if those that have tilled it complain of me that I
have oppressed them: let me eat Tristles insteade of wheat, and darnell
insteade of barley. Hereby Job concludes that which we have seen before:
that is to wit, that although he had bin grievously afflicted by the hand of
God, yet notwithstanding men ought not to have condemned him as though he had
been a greater offender than others whom God spared. And why? For (as I have
said) God keeps not all one rate in afflicting men. Sometime he punishes
them for their sins, and otherwhyles when he intends to visit his own
servant with extreme rigor, he reserueth the cause of their afflictions to
himself. For although they have served him and endeavored to frame themselves
wholly to his righteousness: yet will he not therefore forbear to send them
right great afflictions. In that case we know not what to say, until the
last day when God shall manifest the things unto us which now are hidden. So
then Job shows that we must not esteem his life according to the state
wherein he is. For although he be the miserablest of all men to outward sight:
yet does he protest that he had a desire to serve God. And wherein shows he
that? we have heretofore seen many of his protestations, and now this is the
last, that his land cried not out against him. True it is that the earth has
no mouth to cry nor complain, another has it feeling to suffer any wrong at
our hand, another seems it that we do the earth any wrong: insomuch that
although it could speak, yet a man would not say that it had cause either to
cry or to weep or to make any complainte against us. What does Job then meene
by saying that his land complained not, and that his furrows wept not? He
meneth not that the earth of it self has cause to complain: but the holy
scripture uses such manner of speech, to make us perceive the better and with
greater vehemency, that if we do amiss before God, the creatures shall be
against us, and bear witness against us. As how? If we have oppressed the
poor laborers that til the earth to give us food: If we have used extortio^
against the^, or if we have plucked away their goods: not only they shall bear
witness against us, but the earth which they have tilled shall also depose
against us. And why* For they have bestowed their sweat there, and that is as
their blood. Now it is a great cruelty in us, when we think not how the earth
on her behalf has opened her bowels according to the order that God has fet,
and yielded her fruit when she was tilled. The earth the^ has don her duty
and wrought with her labourer, as if there were a mutual agreement betwixt
the^, and yet notwithstanding behold how the Seagulfes devour the foyson

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may have our whole
recourse unto his mercy, and therewithal every of us so enforce himself to
walk in pureness of life, as we may be able by the power of his holy spirit,
to resist all te^ptatio^s, and to follow whether soever he call us, and justly
protest that we have served the living God, and sought nothing but too
glorify his name as it becomes Christians too do. For the performaunce
whereof, it may please him too grant: that all the time of our life, we may
seek altogether to please him, and by that means edify one another, too draw
even the silly ignorant sort to the light of the Gospel, whereunto our good God
calls us by his grace: and that to the same end it may please him, etc.

The Cxix. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxxij. Chapter.
THese three men left speaking to Job because he esteemed himself to be
righteouse.

2 And Eliu the Son of Barachel the Buzite, of the house of Ram, was angry
and sore displeazed with Job, because he said he was more rightuouse than God.

3 Also he was angry with this three friends, because they had made none
answer, and yet condemned Job.


THat we may fare the better by that which is contained here, and by the
things that we shall see hereafter, we must bear in mind what we have seen
heretofore: namely, that Job having undertaken a good case, did handle it
amiss: and that those which that Eliu the Buzite was angry and inflamed with
wrath, because those said men had not disproued Job, and yet notwithstanding
had condemned him: and also that he was angry with Job, because he went about
to justify himself about God. So we see that this anger of Elius was not
without cause, as well against Job, as against his three friends that came to
comfort him. For although Job had a just and reasonable quarrel, yet did he
far ouershote himself: and although the other alleged very good reasons, yet
did they resist God: for their reasoning was to an evil purpose. Now in the
mean whole it is said, that Jobs three friends left off to dispute any more
against him, because he thought himself to be righteouse. We have seen that
Job made not so great the Buzite, of the house of Ram. For here we see first
the au^cientnesse that we touched heretofore: and the* principal point also
which God me^t to declare unto us, is that there has always remained some good
seed of religion among those that were wrapped in many fond fancies. And that
is a very notable point. For we know that the world did out of hand fall away
from God, and all men turned aside to corruption and lies. I meene even
immediately after the flood, notwithstanding that the vengeance of God were so
horrible and worthy of remembrance, and that the children of Noe which had
escaped, (having lived a long time after) might tell their children and
successors after what manner God had taken vengeance of the wickedness of the
world. For notwithstanding all this: yet they fell all away and forsook the
right religion, turning aside unto lies, idolatry, and all other disorders.
Herein we see that men are exceeding frail, and that there is nothing harder
than to hold them in the fear of God and in good religion. True it is, that in
respect of evil, we be but too steadfast, we cannot be bowed aside: and if
a man would go about too amend the evil in us, he knows not at whi^ch end to
begin, another can he bring it to pass, because there is such a piteouse
hardhartednesse in us. But as for goodness: we forgo it byandby: there
needs nothing to thrust us from it. We have a fair mirroure hereof showed
us in this, that men went astray, and forsook the pure knowledge of God so
soon after the flud, notwithstanding that they were told of it. And here
withal we see in this example of the person of Eliu, that God has always
left some good seed in the midst of darkness, and that there has always
bin some good and holy doctrine. And why? To the end the unbelievers should
be left inexcusable, so as they could not allege that ignorance reigned over
all. For whereof came it, that God was not served and woorshipped purely, but
for that men turned their backs upon him? And they did not that through a
simplicity, whereunto they might give some color of honesty: but rather of a
stubborn wilfulness. Men are loath to be beguiled, yea or to seem to be
beguiled: but when it comes to the serving of God, they shet their eyes,
quench all the light that shyned in them, and seek nothing but to give which
is given us at these days. Thus ye see what we have to mark in the first
place of this sentence. Now as touching the anger of Eliu, let us mark that it
is not blamed here as an inordinate passion: but it is a good and alowable
misliking, because it proceeds of a zeal that Eliu had toward Gods truth,
when he saw Job justify him self in such wise, as be esteemed himself more
righteouse than God. Jobs friends had not this knowledge. For they hyld opinion
against him, that he was a wicked man: and Job declares that he was not so: No
more was he indeed. that Job intended to justify himself above God. Truly
his intent was not so, and he would rather a hundred times that the earth had
swalowed him up, or that he had never bin borne into the world, than to have
thought such a blasphemy. And truly I have told you, that as often as he
ouershot himself, it was not to conclude fully so, but it was through the
raging of his passions, according as it is very hard for men to stay
themselves, wit is not able too mount so high, and that they be too deep a
dungeon for us to go down into. And let us practice this thing cheefely in our
selves. For inasmuche as men are full of hypocrisy, they always believe
themselves to be clear and guiltless before God. And although they be not
fully persuaded of it: yet they bear themselves in hand, that God has no
cause to pursue the^ with so great rigor. Every man flattereth himself too
lessen his own sins, although he be fully convicted. Well (says he) it
is true that I am a sinner, yet am I these scorners of God do, which say: Oh,
will you storm so? Is it meet you should be angry? Might you not use a
quieter fashion? They blaspheme and despise God wickedly, according as there
are many to be seen, which could find in their hearts to overthrow al
doctrine: seeking nothing else but too spread such corruptions abroad, as men
might not any more know God, and that his truth might be buried. And when
they have so done, they would have men to wink at them, or rather to allow
all their doings, and to tell nothing but fables in the Pulpit, so as

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may sigh and
sobbe for them, and that whereas we have been ouermuche hardened heretofore, by
soothing our selves in our vices, so as we could not be grieved to see the
world so far out of order: we may learn hereafter to be sorry for our
evil doings, and to desire him of forgiveness, to the intent he may so guide
us all the rest of our life by his holy spirit, as we may seek altogether to
serve and honor him in all points according to our calling. And so let us all
say, Almighty God our heavenly father. etc.

The.Cxx. Sermon which is the second upon the.xxxij. Chapter.
4 Eliu vvayted till Job had made an end of his words, by cause they were all
elder than he.

5 And when Eliu savv those three men to have no reason, he was moved to
anger.

6 Therefore Eliu the son of Barachell the Buzite answered and said, I am
younger in years than you, and you are ancient, and therefore I doubted and
was afraid to put forth mine opinion.

7 For I thought with my self, the years shall speak, and the length of
time shall bring forth wisdom.

8 But it is the spirit of God which is in men, and the inspiration of the
Almighty gives understanding.

9 The great men shall not be wise therefore, neither shall the aged have
judgment.

10 Therefore I say, hear me, and I also will show my doctrine.


YEsterday I treated of the zeal of Eliu, which is praised too us here by
the holy Ghost, not be subject too the lusts of youth. And by these lusts
of youth, he meeneth not disorderednesse in playing, whorehunting,
drunkenness, or other such looce behavior: for Timothy was a myrrour and
pattern of all holiness in himself, yea and Saint Paul was feign too exhort
him too the drinking of wine, and yet notwithstanding he speaks to him of the
lusts of youth. And why? For in as much as he was young of years: it was
possible for him to be ouerhastie in diverse things. Now if it behooved
Timothy (who passed his elders in of them. Now if God list to call young men
to publish his word abroad: It were no reason that the holy Ghost should
be so brydeled, that young men might not speak, and old men be contented to
hear them. True it is that like as God calls some of all sorts: so has it
commonly been his will, to be served by the elder sort: nevertheless he
has declared also, that his truth is not tied unto age. So then we see now
what modesty ought to be in all men generally, and specially in young men:
that is to wit, that they must yield them selves quietly, too I said age
shall speak, and the multitude of years shall utter knowledge. But it is the
spirit of God that owelleth in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty
gives understanding. Mark how the order of nature goes before: that is to
wit, that we must give care to our elders: For when men choose governors in
a City, or in a Country, if they should take young light headed and
brainelesse fools, which have no skill to govern their own persons, the
chosing of such to be their Judges and leaders, were a perverting of the order
of nature, that it is the spirit of God which is in men: as if he should say,
true it is, that we must not judge that old men do dote, except we know
how the matter goes: neither must we fail to give them room and place:
but we must yield such honor to their age, as to say, well, the man that has
seen much, is able to teach us. But if we perceive that he discharge not his
duty, or that he has lost his time which he has lived in the world: then if
the spirit of God be in a young man, it behooves him to put forth him self.
Then let us mark well, that the observing of the order of nature, must not be
always with such condition, that when God indueth them with any gifts of
grace, they should not serve his Church, or that they should not teach, not
only their equals and companions, but also even the oldest me^ of all. And
consequently, the rich men must not stick to their age, and thereupon be
impatient, and reject all warnings, to say, how now? I have lived a long
time, and shall a young *ladde teach me my lesson? No, but let them think thu^
with them selves: I ought too have profited in such wi^e, as I might have
been a leader of others: but I see ne^we, that I have need to be led my
self: I am a young child in comparison of those that should have been taught
by me. And seeing it is so, that God has disappoynted me of the grace that
was requisite in a leader: it behooves me too be a scholar and not a
master. Ye see then that old men ought too yield themselves too
conformity, when they see that God has given It is the spirit of God which
dwells in men: It is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives
understanding. Do we see wretched men blinded, and so plunged in ignorance, as
they cannot come to the Gospel? Let us not marvel at it. And why? For it is
man's natural kind, not to discern any whit of Gods secrets, until we be
enlightened. But contrariwise when we see a man that knows God (whether he be
young or old) or if we see an old man that has bin saped a long while in the
dotages of Papistrie, come too right Religion, let us assure our selves that
God has wrought a miracle in that case. Also if we see young folks come to
it, let us assure ourselves that God draws them to him after a marvelous
fashion. For they do not easily receive the yoke, because they be full of
presumption as I said before. Then if God tame them, and make them teachable, it
is his mighty hand that has brought the^ unto it. And so we se, that this
text ought to serve us in two things. The first is, that seeing that by our wit
can never reach so high as to know God or his truth: we ought to put our own
reason from us, and to renounce it utterly. And that is the thing which
Saint Paul terms too be made a fool. Then if we will have our Lord to
fill us with his wisdom: it behooves us to become fools: that is to say, we
must not bring any thing of our own, nor ween our selves to have one thing
or other: For that were a shetting of the door against God. Wherefore if we
will have God to continue the grace of his holy spirit, when he shall have
given us any For it is the spirit of God that gives understanding. Wherefore
let the same be a ground for us, to magnify Gods grace the more, which we
shall have received: and therewithal let us not be carried away, though we
see such rebelliousnesse. And why? For men do but follow their own kind,
they follow their own head, and in the mean while resist God: and that that
great men are not always wise, and that sometimes aged men have no
understanding, skill, nor discretion, more than other men. Truly Eliu meeneth
not here to pervert the order of nature. For he has protested heretofore,
that he would hearken to the aged, and was willing to submit himself too
their that the great men shall ^^t always be wyze, nor the aged men always
the men of best understanding. As if he should say, we must not make a
general rule too say this man is advanced too hie estate and authority, and
therefore he must needs be a man of knowledge: we must not gather any
such consequent of it. And why? For God can well forsake the great ones, so as
they shall become gross beasts, and the longer they shall have lived, they
shall but have misspent the more bread in being fed at Gods cost, in so much
that it had been better (as you would say) that an Ox had been fed with it.
For it had been better bestowed. So then let us learn, that for as much as
God distributeth his spirit to those whom he intends to apply to his
service: they ought so much the better to imploye themselves carefully and in
the fear of God. And if they do otherwise, it will appear that those which
were taken to be wysest, shall be utterly blinded, so as they shall not know
God, according as God threatens by his Prophet Esaias, saying, that the aged
shall not see any whit, and that the wise shall become brutish and utterly dull.
We see the^ how God declares a much more horrible vengeance against the
great men, old men, and gouernoures, than against the common people. Hereby
we be warned, that we must not attribute an infallible authority too them,
as though they could never errenor misgouerne others. Now if God do blind
the old men, great men, and such as are in authority after that sort: what
shall become of them (I pray you) if God give them not his holy spirit? And
let us mark well the cause why God makes that threatening. It is for men's
hypocrisy, because they served him but for countenance sake, and their heart
was far from him, so as they protested too serve him with their mouth, and in
the mean while gave them selves to the traditions of men: that is too say,
God reigned not alone over them by his word, but men had their own scope. But
God can not abide that his authority should be so diminished. And that is the
cause why he says, I will bind the wise, and take away understanding and
reason from the aged. Wherefore if we desire to have God to govern us, and
too reign among us, and to inioye the gracious gifts that are necessary for
our salvation: let us learn that it behooves us to yield him the dominion and
soueraintie over us, and all of us both great and small, must ftame our selves
to his obedience. Furthermore, let us take his word for our rule, and suffer
our selves to be governed by it: assuring our selves that otherwise we must
not look that the holy Ghost shall work in us. And therefore let us seek
all the means that can be to be taught. God would that there should be
shepeherdes in his Church to preach his word, and that we should receive
correction and warning at should be shepeheards in the Church to preach his
word, and that we should receive correction and warning at their hands. Is
not this done so thoroughly as it ought to be? Let us pray God to supply that
defaulte. Wherefore let us walk in such humility, as our whole desire may
be, that God should have all pre-eminence over us, assuring our selves that
we can have no further reason nor understanding, than we be enlightened by
his holy spirit. That is the mean whereby he will never suffer us to be
thrust out of the way, but when he has once

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him too make us so to perceive the^, as we may be utterly
beaten down in them, and specially that knowing what a number of wantes and
miseries be in us, we may pray him to reform us and cleanse us from all our
spots, and make us so pure by his holy spirit, as he may always
acknowledge and auowe us too be his children: and that we also on our side
may serve and honor him as our father, and show such brotherly love one
toward another, as he commands, so as we may seek nothing but to exalt
his holy name among us, and every of us in his degree too yield him his due
honor. That it may please him to grant this grace, etc.

The Cxxj. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxxij. Chapter.
11 Behold I have vvayted for your words, giving ear while you prepared
your selves and sought out your reasons.

12 Then I considered you, but there was none of you that disproued Job, or
that ansvvered his words.

13 But to the end you may not say, we have found vvisdome: God has cast
him, and not man.

14 He has not directed his words unto me: neither will I answer him
according to your words.

15 They were afraid and ansvvered not, but left speaking.

16 And I tarried, but they spoke not: they stood still and ansvvered no more.

17 I also will answer in my turn, and shevve mine advice.

18 For I am full of matter, and the spirit of my belly constreyneth me.

19 Behold my belly is as the wine that has no vente, and as the nevve
Barrelles that burst.

20 Therefore I will speak and have a vent, I will open my lips and
answer.

21 I will not now accept the person of man, neither will I give titles to
man.

22 For if I should flatter, I can not tell whether my maker vvoulde destroy
me incontinently.


LIke as it was declared yesterday that no man ought to put forth himself too
hastily, but that we should rather seek too learn than to teach others,
except necessity constrained us: So now it is showed us here, that we must
not thrust our selves into any unknown matter, before we know well how the
case stands. And truly we see Now let us come to that which Eliu says. He
declares that his discourse shall not be such as the other men's were. Say not
(says he) we have have found wisdom: for God has overthrown Job and not
men. Here Eliu betokens that he will take another way in disputing against
Job, than the other men had done. For what way hild they? Thou art afflicted by
the hand of God (say they) and not without cause: and therefore it must be
concluded, that thou art a wicked man. Thine affliction is so great and
unmeasurable, as there was never yet any man in the world seen then is the
thing which we have too do, when God makes us to behold his vengeance, in
such as have been utterly rebellious against him. But if we see the good men
visited: it behooves us to think: Alas, if the green tree be cast into the
fire, what shall become of the dry? When we compare our selves with such
as are in a manner half out of this world already, we shall see very
great virtues in them, and yet notwithstanding they are handeled much more
greeuouslye than we. Therefore we must needs say, that God bears with I
waited (says he) and they spoke no more, but gave over their talk. Hereby he
betokens, that they were confounded, because they were evil grounded: For
we know that the truth is always invincible. True it is that he which has a
good case, shall not always be heard: For we see that a good case may be
oppressed by brainelesse and frantike folk when they have their full scope.
For they stop the mouths of such as have just cause to speak. But when
things go orderly, if a man have a good case, God gives that he also will
speak in his turn. This word Also ought to be well weyed. For thereby Eliu
betokens, that he puts forth his advice in due time. Why? I have told
you already, that because he was a young man, he ought to have yielded
reverence to the aged: For otherwise it had bin a perverting of the order of
nature. Therefore it behooved this modesty to go before, and that Eliu should
suffer his elders to speak, and he to hear them. That done, for as much as
God gives him the grace to discern the case better than they had done, he
also speaks in his turn. We see then that he runs not a head, that is
to say, he thrusts not himself into the matter at adventure: but holds his
peace till convenient time serves, and then speaks. And this is a point
which we ought to mark very well. For we know that in Gods Church all things
ought to be handled orderly and comely, as Saint Paul says. Therefore there
are two things requisite in the manner of teaching: First, that order be
observed: and secondly, that the order be matched with honesty, so as the
things may be comely and convenient. Seeing it is so, let us bear in mind
the example of Eliu, and let us hold us to the doctrine that Saint Paul
gives us in the said text: which is, that there be no disorder amongst us,
according also as Saint Paul says in another streine of the text by me
alleged, and that he is like to a caske full of new wine. If a man put new
wine intoo a Caske and close it up, and give it no vent: the caske bursteth
when the wine boyleth. Even so says Eliu that his mind is shet up as if a
caske were full of new wine, and could hold no longer, but must needs
burst out. Hereby he meeneth that necessity constreyneth him to put forth
his opinion, to the end that the case which had been evil debated, might now
be ordered by reason. And because Eliu speaks here with great vehemency:
some perceiving not the cause, have in this man. And why? For youth of it self
shall not be heard among men, because that old men make great account of their
age, and think themselves to be of great ability and wisdom: and that makes
them so much the more arrogant. For by means thereof, they are so
forepossessed with a foolish opinion, as they cannot find in their hearts to be
taught, but with great hardness, and as it were by force. Therefore it behooved
God to touch Eliu to the quick, and to make a great alteration of mind in him,
to the end that his doctrine might have some entrance, and it. Then let not
these temptations withholde us from fighting valiantly against them: but if we
see our selves ready to be hated, and that men practice mischeefs against us,
for mainteyning good quarelles: let us not give them over for all that. True it
is, that that were enough to draw us back, and to stop our mouth:
nevertheless it behooves us to fight against such temptations after the
example of Eliu. Ye see then how Gods servants ought too be fully resolved,
not too swerve from confessing the truth when need requires. And finally,
Eliu says, that there shall be no accepting of persons with him, and that he
will not use any flattery, because that if he should sooth men, he cannot tell
whether his maker would destroy him. Eliu meeneth to say in effect, that he
will not be brideled by the authority of man, that he should not speak
freely when it comes to the mainteyning of Gods truth. But this can not be
laid forth at length as now, and therefore it is enough for us to have Elius
meening. Surely it is not an evil thing, nor utterly to be condemned, to call
a man by an honorable title. Howbeeit, forasmuch as the same that he will not
give tytles to men, that is to say, that he will not exaltmen so high, but that
the truth shall be above them. So then, let us bear in mind, that although
it be lawful for us to yield honor unto men, yea and that we ought to do it,
insomuch that we must honor not only our superiors or equals, but also our
inferiors, according as the scripture commands us: yet notwithstanding,
whether it be toward

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us feel them better than we have done: and
that for the bringing thereof to pass, we may not presume aught of our
selves, knowing well that we cannot open our mouth except he guide and govern
us by his holy spirit, and therefore that it may please him too instruct us in
such wise, as we may have our mouth open too speak when need requires, and
that we may not follow our own affections and lusts in speaking, but that
all our life may be agreeable thereunto, and be bestowed in such obedience
toward our God, as we may seek nothing but to frame it wholly to his holy
will: and that although we be subject too much wretchedness and corruption
in passing through this world: yet we may not fail too labor still for the
full perfection, whereunto God will call us, when we shall have glorified him
in this world. That it may please him too grant this grace, not only to us,
but also to all people and Nations of the earth, bringing back all poor
ignorant souls from the miserable bondage of error and darkness, too the
right way of salvation, etc.

The.Cxxij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxxiij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the three last verses of the former Chapter, and
then upon the text that follows.

THerefore Job hear thou my talk, and hearken unto all my words.

2 Behold I have opened my mouth, my tongue shall speak in my palate.

3 My words are the rightnesse of my heart, and my lips shall utter pure
doctrine.

4 The spirit of God has created me, and the breath of the Almighty has
given me life.

5 If thou can, answer me, and prepare thy self against me, and debate thy
case stoutely.

6 Behold I am to Godvvarde as thou [or according to thine own mouth] I am
also formed of the clay.

7 There is no fear of me too trouble thee, and although I press thee, yet
shall it be no heavy burden to thee.


I Have begone already to lay forth the protestation that Eliu made speaking
rightly without regard of men: and (as it has been declared) the man that
will speak rightly and godlily, must have his eye shet that he accept no
persons. For if we be led either with hatred, or with favor, there will be
nothing well ruled in us, there will be nothing but trouble. Specially when it
stands upon teaching in Gods name, it behooves us to be well advised to
turn away from all hear thou me. Truly I speak with my tongue, and I utter
my words from my palate. But yet notwithstanding, my saying are the rightnesse
of my heart, and thou shall not hear any thing but truth and uprightness at
my mouth. See here what a protestation Eliu makes, to the intent to be heard:
that is to wit, that he will not speak feynedly, and as a double minded man,
but will set down things purely, according as he knew them to be, and as they
had bin reveled unto him. Mark that for the first point. Secondly he adds,
Behold I am in respect of God as thou art, or according to thy mouth. The word
that he uses signifies properly a mouth: howbeit, sometimes it is taken for
Measure. Now we have seen heretofore, how Job desired God to come to him,
without bringing any such terror as he felt. If God were my match (says Job)
I could answer him: and although he have all authority over me, yet could I
mainteyn my case. Lo after what manner Job speaks. And so this sentence might
be expounded thus: Behold I am according to thine own mouth: that is to say,
according as thou have desired: or else thus: Behold I am according to thy
measure: that is to say, I am like unto thee, in respect of God. Nevertheless,
the meening will abide always one: And therefore we need not to stand much
upon the word. Let us consider still wherevntoo Eliu intends too come: that
is to wit, that he is not God that he might make Job afraid, but that he is
created of clay as Job is: that is to say, that he is a mortal and transitory
creature which has no strength in himself. For (says he) it is the spirit of
God that has fashioned me: and the breath of the Almighty has given me
life. To be short, we see how Eliu tells Job here, that he will speak
against him with su^^ reason, as he shall be overcome. Thou shall no more
allege (says he) that God makes thee afraid, that his glory is terrible to
thee, and that thou can have no right at his hand: thou shall not be able
to say so. For who am I? Behold, I am a wretched lump of earth and mire. True
it is that I have breath and life, howbeit I have them of God: but yet am I as
full of frailty that his words are the rightnesse of his heart: and that he
will not speak any thing which he has not thought and conceived in himself.
This is well worthy to be noted: For thereupon we may gather, after what sort
he ought too be disposed which bears about the word of God: namely that
he must not have store of bibblebabble at his tongues end, nor Behold me
(says he) hear me: for there is nothing but right in my talk. It is all one
as if he did set it down for a rule in that all goodness comes of him.
Again, he will also have all Lordeship and power over our life, and therein
hold us so in awe, as we may be governed by him, and according to his good
will: he will have men to be utterly abaced, and bereft of the trust of their
own righteousness, wisdom and strength: he will have us to come and draw
water in our Lord Jesus Christ, as in the fountain of all goodness: he will
have us to call upon him purely, and he will have the Sacraments which he has
ordained, to be received as warrants of his grace, and as means and he cannot
make Job afraid. Nevertheless that the spirit of God has created him, and
that the breath of the Almighty has given him life: and further, that he is
but mire and clay. Truly this is well worthy to be noted of all men. For if
we could bear well in mind that which is showed here: undoubtedly all pride
would be buried in us. For what is the cause that men do glory so much in
themselves, and are so full of ouerweening, but first for that they know not
their own original beginning: and secondly for that they have not the skill
to consider in good earnest, that look whatsoever they have, they hold it of
God, and that it is no heritage unto them, but that they have their life and
all the appurtenances thereof, because it pleases God to preserve them. Then if
men could first consider from whence they come, and secondly that whatsoever
goodness is in them, they hold it of gods mere grace: it is certain that they
should be rightly meekned. Therefore it is said, that we are fashioned of mire
and clay. Now let us go boast our selves, and make as great vaunts as we list,
and yet shall we not be able to change our nature. Wherefore, when a man
feels himself tempted with pride, so as he would exalt himself to much: let
him enter intoo himself, and consider from whence he came, and out of what
thing God took him. If but only our feet be myrie, it seems to us that we
are the less worth. And if the mire do but touch us, we think our selves
defiled: yea if it do but hang on our shoes. And yet for all this we be made
of clay. Therefore we ought not so too forget our pedigree from whence we
come, namely that we are but earth and dust. True it is that this saying is
common enough, and every man confesses it: but in the mean season no man
acknowledges it. For such a through conceyte were enough too purge us of all
pride. What else is the presumption and ouerweening that is in men, but only
a windiness, because they be puffed up with ignorance, and have forgotten
themselves? So much the more then ought we to wey well this speech, wherein it
is said that we be created of clay or mire. True it is, that there were some
worthiness and excellency in our nature meet to be commended, if we were
thoroughly whole and sound: but yet were it not lawful for us to be proud of
it. And seeing we are so corrupted in Adam as we be, it is certain that we
ought to be double ashamed. And why? For we were created after the Image of
God. And what manner of Image is it now? It is a disfigured one: we be so
defaced, that the mark which God had put into us too be glorified thereby, is
turned into his dishonor: and all the gracious gifts that were bestowed upon
us, are become as many records to make us guilty before God, because we
defile them, and so long as we continue in our own nature, we do but abuse
the benefits that we have received, and apply them unto evil. And so ye see
always that our confusion increases, by all the gifts which God has
bestowed amongst us. But yet let us put the case, that we were as uncorrupted
as ever our father Adam was at the first. Should we therefore presume of our
selves under the color that God had so innobled us? Truly we hold all things
of him. What is it that puts a difference between us and the brute beasts,
and makes us more excellent? Have we it through our own purchase? Have we
gotten it by our own strength? Have we it by inheritance from our forefathers?
No. But we have it of gods free gift through his own mere goodness. So then
what is to be done, but only to humble our selves? This is the thing which we
have to gather ingenerall upon this streyne, where Eliu confesses himself too
be made of clay, and that he is beholden to God for his life and breath,
because he bestowed them upon him of his mere goodness. And now by the way,
those whom God will have the spirit of God has created me, and his breath has
given me life. So then (adds he) there is no terriblenesse in me to make
thee afraid, but only reason shall bear the sway. Here Eliu shows what
the duty of a good teacher is: namely to look well to himself, and to view
and consider himself before he open his mouth. And why? for they that have not
known their own frailty, will have no compassion of their neighbors: and
when they fall to rebuking of such as have done amiss, they go to it with
such rigor, as it shall be rather to make the wretched wanderers stray
further, than to bring them into the way. And when it comes to comforting,
they have no skill how too do it: or if they come to teaching, they do it with
a disdain. Therefore if we will teach Gods word as we ought to do, let us
begin at the knowing of our own infirmities. And when we be well acquainted
with them, that will lead us to a modesty and meekness, so as we shall be of
a mild heart to viter the word of God. True it is that forasmuch as there are
many which are full of pride and stubbornness: the word of God had need to be
unto them as a hammer to broose and break their hardness: but yet
notwithstanding we ought first and foremost to teach those that yield
themselves teachable. And how may we do that, when we know not what need we
have to bear with them? But bear with them we cannot, except we feel how
frail we our selves are. For he that knows not his own wantes, has no
compassion to partake other men's sorrows, and to comfort them. So then will we
teach the ignorant faithfully? we must understand that there is nothing but
ignorance in our selves: and that it had bin worse with us than with all other
men, if God had not given us the things which we have received of him.
Again, will we comfort the wretched and afflicted? Let us first understand
what it is to be afflicted, let us have passed that way our selves, and let us
be touched with grief and heaviness, that we may comfort our selves with
others that are in sorrow, and have skill to bear with them. Furthermore if we
will rebuke such as have done amiss, let us not do it with over great rigor,
but rather let us pity their destruction. True it is that sometimes vehemency
must needs be joined with it: for when we see their wretched souls perish,
it is no time to cocker them: if men be wilful in their stubbornness, we must
not only strike them, but also wound them to the quick. Yea, but yet
therewithal it behooves us to have this point aforehand, namely that we have
bin acquainted with our own infirmities, and that it grieve us to deal
rigorously: like as although a father beat his children, and use much more
rougher words to them than he would do to strangers: yet notwithstanding his
heart bleedeth, when he is feign to transform himself after that sort. Then
let us mark, that a man shall never be meet to be a teacher, except he have
put on a fatherly affection, and first of all know his own infirmity, to the
end he may frame himself to such a pitifulness, as he may have compassion of
al such as he has to deal withal. This is the thing which is showed us here
by Eliu. Furthermore let all such as are placed in authority, consider well
that they must not abuse their power unto tyra^nie, to oppress those that are
under them. For they shall have a double account to make before God, if under
the color of their authority, they will have men to fear them and stand in
awe of them, and not seek chiefly the honor of God and the welfare of those
that are committed unto them. And see here how Ezechiell speaks of evil
sheepherds which have misintreated Gods people through tyranny. He says that
they reigned over them with all rigor and lordlinesse. Yea but contrariwise it
is showed us here, that all such as will quite themselves faithfully toward God
and their neighbors when they be set in hie degree, must not therefore aduau^ce
themselves, but rather know that if they intend to carry

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him too make us so too feel our wretchedness, as we may
be taught, not to challenge any thing at all to our selves, nor too be abused
any more with vain follies, but too acknowledge that we be altogether
miserable, and thereupon to desire to be succored of him through his mercy,
and be thankful for the benefits which he has already bestowed upon us, to
the end that by his gracious goodness in continuing them toward us, we may
learn too apply them to the glorifying of his holy name, and to dedicate them
unto his service, beseeching him further too bear with our weakness, until
he have utterly rid us of it, and transformed us into his own glory. And so
let us all say: Almighty God our heavenly father, we acknowledge and confess
according to the truth, that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes, etc.

The Cxxiij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxxiij. Chapter.
8 Doubtless thou have spoken to mine ears, and I have heard this voice of
thy saying.

9 I am pure and without sin. I am clean and there is novnrightuousnesse in
me.

10 He has found occasion against me, and taken me for his enemy.

11 He has put my feet in the stocks, and taken heed to all my vvayes,

12 In this thou shall not be justified, I will answer thee that God is
greater than thou.

13 Why striuest thou against him? for he will not answer to all words.

14 God speaks once and twice, and men hear it not.


WE must call to mind what was treated of yesterday: that is to wit, that God
does us a great pleasure, when he vouchsafes to apply himself so far to
our infirmity, as too speak familiarly unto us by the mouth of be of the
more authority: howbeeit in the mean season we would be as it were aghast, and
so should we not be masters of our wits to consider what he says. But when
a man speaks, we may the better at our own ease, both ^aste and digest the
things that are spoken. Ye see then in what wise God bears with us. Surely
we see that when the law was to be published, the people of Israel said,
let not the Lord speak unto us, for we be undone if we must hear him. And
why? For since the time that God had begone too show his Majesty, there was
Doubtless thou have said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy
words: That thou art rightuous and without sin, and that thou art not
guilty of any iniquity. Therefore therein thou can not justify thy self,
that is to say, thou can not maintain thy quarrel that thou have not done
amiss. And that it is so: how will thou answer God, seeing he is greater
than thou? Thou^ accusest him that he has sought occasion to punish thee, and
that he has set thy feet in the stocks, so as thou have no liberty to
mainteyne thy case. But think not thou to escape by that. For thou must be
condemned, and God must make thee feel that he does justly punish thee after
this sort. Here we have to examine, first of al, whether Eliu do charge Job
wrongfully have some other respect in afflicting us, and yet handle us more
roughly, than such as are altogether unruly and make an utter skorne of Gods
majesty: let us mark that his doing of it, is not because of our sins.
Why then? He intends to try us and to make us know whither we be wholly
his or no. For so long as things go as we would have them, what know we
whether we be forward to serve God or no* But when we must be feign to
renounce our own will, to subdue all our own natural wit and
understanding, and (to be short) to fight against our own God (says he) has
taken occasion (or picked a quarrel) against me, and thereupon has set my
feet in the stocks, and tormented me and looked unto all my paths: he
spieth me out, and has his eye so upon me, as I cannot stir a finger, but
by and by I have committed a fault. True it is that Job intends not too
accuse God of unrighteous, or of punishing him without cause. Howbeit
herewithall let us mark well, that he was so carried away with his affections,
as there escaped many let us learn to condemn ourselves, although we have bin
pacient. And seeing Job is reproved so grievously by Eliu in this sentence: let
us be sure we shall be found much more blameworthy: specially if we have not
endeavored to obey our God, nor yielded him the honor which belongs unto him.
Lo what we have to mark in this streyne. And by the way, if Job be condemned
here to have blasphemed God: what shall become of us, when we be so carried, as
there is no more patience in us, as it is most commonly seen? Then how can we
bear this condemnation, if we God has set my feet in the stocks: Eliu
rehearses Jobs words as Job had meant them. For God gave him no liberty: as
when men hold an offender in the stocks, it is a kind of punishment to make
him confess that which he would not, whither he will or no. Job then had used
the said comparison, saying: that God gave him no means to Herein thou shall
not be quit (says he:) And why? For God is greater than thou. This present
reason seems to be very cold to convince Job, and to decide the present
case. For first of al, who knows not that God is greater than men? And who is
so mad, as not to confess his greatness, and to acknowledge it in him: We
see many fantastical heads that despise God: but yet they stick not to
grant that God is greater tha^ they. Eliu the^ says no new thing: and
although the same speech were not very common, yet notwithstanding what a
reason is it to say, God is greater tha^ we, and therefore it follows that it
shall not boot us to mainteyne a good case. It seems rather that Eliu
agrees to that which Job had said: that is to wit, God uses such rigor
against me, howbeit that is of his absolute power: he is great, and I am not
able to make my part good with him: he is my maker, and I am but a poor
earthen pot: there is nothing but infirmity in me. It seems here then, that
Job does father an absolute power upon God, as who should say that he did what
he lists against men, without reason or equity. But let us mark that it
behooves us to take this sentence otherwise than the words sound. For
whereas mention is made of Gods greatness: it is meant to go jointly with all
that ever is in him. And truly we must not separate the virtues that are in
God: for they are his own proper being. Men may well have some virtues in
them, that may be taken from them: but it is not so with God. When we speak
of his power, or his justice, or his wisdom, or his goodness: we speak of
himself: they are things inseparable, and cannot be severed (that is to say,
they cannot be taken away from his Being:) for they are so joined together, as
the one of them cannot be without the other. Is God myghtie? so is he also
good. His myghtinesse defeateth not his goodness, nor yet his Justice.
Therefore whereas Eliu says here, that God is greater than man: he meeneth
not that his greatness is only in power, but also that with his greatness of
power, there is infinite justice, infinite wisdom, and all other things
infinite in him. And what are we in comparison of him? That therefore is the
natural sense of this streyne. Now we see that this argument is good to put al
men to silence, and to make them stoop to humility, that they may stand no
more in contention against God. And why? what is the cause that we murmur in
our afflictions? That we cannot suffer God to handle us according to his will?
that he seems to have done enough and to much already? And that we demand
so curiously why God uses such rigor against us? what is the cause of all
this? for that we think not upon Gods God is greater than thou, and how then
will thou plead against him? Hereby we be warned, first of all that whenever
God answere^th not all words. This imports a great substance. For Eliu
intends to show us, that we cannot comprehend al things as now, because God
lists not to reuele the^ unto us. This is in effect the thing which he meant.
And it behooves us to mark, that God manifests himself unto us in part, to
the end we should not be left untaught in the things that are good and
expedient for us. Nevertheless he knows our capacity, and according
thereunto reueleth his will unto us, reserving in the mean while unto himself,
the things that we could not comprehend, because they pass our understanding.
If we bear this lesson in mind, we shall have profited well for one day:
Behold, God has taken upon him the charge and office to teach us, and
therefore we must not be negligent in hearing: seeing that he is so gracious to
us as to be our master, let us in any wise be his scholars and give diligent
heed to that which he says. Howbeit let us mark therwithall, that when he
executes the office of a scholemaster toward us, it is not to open unto us
all things that we would doubt of, or whereof we would be inquisitiue. What
the^? The things that he knows to be for our edifying, that is to say, which
he knows to be for our behoof. And so it behooves us to mark three things.
One is, that we must have our ears open to receive the doctrine that God
teaches us, and not be as brute beasts when he does us that honor, but apply
our indeuer to profit under him. Thus ye see the first point. We must not
do, as the wretched Papists do which would know nothing: O (say they) it is a
dangerous matter to inquire of Gods secrets. It is true that we must come to
it with lowliness and reverence: but ought we therefore to have our ears
stopped, or deaf, when God speaks to us? So then let us always learn to be
ready and willing to receive whatsoever is said or set forth unto us in the
name of God. Thus much concerning the first point. Secondly let us mark that
God will not show us all things as now, but we must content our selves with that
which S. Paul says in the first to the Corinthians: that is to wit, that as
now we know in part, and see as it were in a glass and darkely: for as yet we
be not come to the day of the full revelation. For although the Gospel be
called the brightness of the noone day: yet notwithstanding the same is
referred to our measure. God inlighteneth us there sufficiently: we see his
face in our Lord Jesus Christ: and we behold it to be transfigured into the
same: but howsoever the world go, we see not that which is prepared against
the latter day. It behooves us to increase

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him too make us feel them better than we have done, that
we may not only crave pardon of him, but also beseech him to renew us by his
holy spirit, and to cleanse us from all our fleshly affections: and that
forasmuch as there is nothing but vanity in us, and we cannot but stray from
the right way, if we follow our natural inclination: it may please him to
redress it and to guide us by his hand unto the end of our life. That it may
please him to grant, etc.

The.Cxxiiij. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
14 God will speak once or twice, and men hear him not.

15 In a dream and vision of the night when sleep is upon men, and they are
at rest in their bed:

16 Then opens he the ear of men, and seals his chasticement upon them.

17 To the end to dravve a man back from his work, and to hydethe pride of
men.


HEre Eliu goes forward with the matter which he had begone already in the
last sermon: that is to wit, that God yields no account of his doings and
sayings unto mortal men. And we have to mark here, that which I have declared
already: namely that Eliu treats not here of that doctrine of god which
ought to be clear and easy unto us. For god (as he protests by his Prophet
Esaias) speaks not unto us covertly, another is it for naught that he says,
seek me. that God will speak once or twyce and men shall not hear him. It is
the worse for us, that there be many sentences concerning God, that God
speaks unto men in visions by night when sleep troubles them, and also
that he speaks by chasticements. It seems unto them that here be the two
manners of speaking unto us which God uses: so as sometime he reueleth himself
by inspirations, and sometimes also touches us with his hand. But this is
nothing to the purpose, and it is a constrained sense. Furthermore we need not
to beat our brains much in seking diversities of expositio^s, seeing that the
natural sense is manifest unto us. Therefore let us follow that which I have
declared already: which is, that God shall speak once or twice, yea and yet not
be understood. Thus we know what Eliu meant to say: and now remains to apply
the same to our instruction. And how? first of all by knowing our own
slenderness: for what is the cause that me^ take so highly upon them to seek
and search after such a sort as nothing may escape them: but because they
think themselves able enough too find out all things? but if a man be
thoroughly well tamed, in such sort as he challenge nothing to himself, he will
be no more so proud and lofty to search Gods secrets to far out of
measure. So then to the intent we may take profit of this text specially, first
let us humble our selves yea even by acknowledging that our understanding is to
small and gross. Mark that for one point. And on the other side let us
consider also, that Gods secret judgments are a dreadful dungeon, that his
ways are incomprehensible, and that it is not lawful for men to wade to far
in them, but must content themselves with that which he declares. Ye see then
that the second point which we have to mark, is that when we think upon the
highness of God, we ought to be ravished to the honoring of it, and conclude
that we must not take upon us to be able to know and comprehend all that is in
him. For whither were that to go? we crepe here upon the earth, and we know
that he far surmou^teth the heavens. Then seeing it is so, let us honor his
secret judgments, assuring our selves that he will always have authority to
speak and utter what he lists, mauger al them that speak against him: yea
and that when he speaks once or twice, that is to say, when he shows his
pleasure and will: men shall know nothing of it because they are to rude to
conceive the things in one word, which God has determined in his purpose: but
shall daily see one thing, and yet not withstanding be new to seek of it, yea
and still dazeled at it, even at the end of a year or ten: and although they
have seen one thing often, yet the reason of it shall be hidden from the^.
Were it not for the pride that is in us, it is sufficiently confirmed unto us
by experience, that we never come to any reason but by co^pulsion, and that we
will always needs be selfwise, eue^ though our ignorance show it self enough
and to much. Nevertheless it is not without cause, that we be warned in this
text, that God will have his determinatio^s as it were buried and hid. We see
the effect of it daily and we know not what to say, saving that it is a
wonderful thing, and that it behooves us to bridle our selves, in waiting
till our Lord reuele it in greater perfection, which shall not be till we be
bereft of this mortal flesh. Thus ye see what we have to mark here. And
according to the article which I have touched already, let us note also that
here is no speaking but of the judgments which God will have hidden, because
it is not for our behoof to have full knowledge of the^ as yet. It is said in
the. 62. Psalm that god speaks once, and David protests that he will bear
it twice, namely that there is might and mercy in God. There is no treating of
Gods wonderful judgments, as there is here. Of what then? of the things that
we learn by his word, which are brought to our remembrance and set before us
continually. For on the one side God makes us to feel his myghtie power, to
the end we should fear him and walk according to his will: on the other side
he gives us his mercy, to the end we should take comfort and joy at it.
What learn we daily by gods word, but that he is the master to whom it
behooves us to be subject and that we must not live after our own lust, but
that God must reign over us, and his that God shall speak once or twyce
without being heard: that is to say, without being understood, because the
wit of man is to weak. But now let us come to that which Eliu adds. He
says that when men be laid down to sleep and are at rest and asleep: God
speaks and opens their ears, of purpose to withdraw them from their own
works, and to tame or hyde the pride which is in men: (that is to say) to
cast it down and to bury it: or else too seek his discipline or instruction
in chastizing them. If he see them hardeharted and that they receive not the
plain doctrine or instruction which he gives them: then is he feign to
stryke upon them, and to tame them with his rods, and to enforce them to be
taught in his truth. This is in effect the thing which is treated of here.
Truly Eliu speaks of his own time, for I have told you already, that he
was not of that people which God had chozen to communicate his law unto. For
if that he and those whom we have heard speak, and Job himself were after
the time of Moses, which thing is uncertain: yet were they strangers from the
Church of God: and the knowledge which they had, was given them by an
extraordinary manner, in as much as it pleased God to inspyre them. And this is
the cause why he says that God inspyreth men, even by dreams: and that when
they are asleep, God does as it were pluck them by the ear, and give them
warning to think upon him. True it is that God inspireth us also, and
although we hear his word to our instruction, and have his holy Scripture to
read: yet does he not cease to warn us still, and to give us many
heartbitings, which are as many summoning too call us back too himself, when
we are gone astray. For we see how men bury the said knowledge, and secke by
all means to forget God: but God comes to search within us. Therefore when
we feel any prickings and thoughts that stir us up: let us understand that
God puts us in remembrance of himself, because we be inclined to forget
him, and to become as it were brutishe. Specially in the nyghtetyme when we be
alone, and our wits gathered to us, that we wander not here and there: then
if there come deep thoughts that wey with us so far as even to make us to
sweat or tremble, or else if we be in such disquietnesse of mind as though we
were upon a rack: it is God that works in that case: and he summoneth us,
because he sees that we are as it were fugitives, like a young boy that leaves
his fathers house, and runs abroad blowing a feather in the wind. God
then, seeing us run so astray, calls us home by visions in the night. True it
is that they shall not be such as Eliu, Job, Eliphas and the others had. And
why? for we have the help which they wanted: that is to wit, the word of God,
which is preached to us and we do hear it. Thus does God reuele himself unto
us, because that God seals his instruction in men by chastising them with his
hand: it is an article well worthy to be borne in mind. For here it is showed
us, that God must be feign to speak unto us with many strokes of hand as they
say. And why? for he is so gracious unto us, as to allure us gently by his
word: and when he sees that this gentleness avails not, he uses a
greater vehemency to tame us: for here he rebukes us for our sins, he
makes us afraid, and he cites us to his judgment, to the end we should
beware and restrain that God opens men's ears: (yea truly, for we know well
that God works by a secret power in us when he sends us the inspirations
that are spoken of here:) But he adds this as now, because we would feign be
so sotted, as there should be none other life with us, but to give ourselves
too making of good cheer. We see how men shun Gods presence as much as
they can, and seek by all means to run astray in all vanities. God then
opens our ears, when he touches us in such wise, as we be compelled to
bethink our selves. A very thief that is hardened in his wickedness, and
could find in his heart that all remembrance of Justice were abolished, shall
notwithstanding not fail to have prickings and hartbitings too sling him
withal. And whereof comes that? even because God opens his ears: howbeeit
let us mark, that there is a double opening of our ears which God woorketh in
us. For sometime he opens our ears to the end that we should be enforced
too perceive that it is he that speaks: but yet for all that we cease not
to be stubborn still, and to refuze the doctrine and corrections which he
gives us, so as we receive no chastizement at his hand to amend us. There
is an other opening of our ears, which is better: which is when God softeneth
our hearts, so as we do willingly receive his sayings, and give heed to them,
and yield our selves wholly too his doctrine. When it is said, that God
opens men's ears: it is not to be understood, that all men indifferently do
yield themselves teachable unto him, and that all are disposed to obey him. No:
he speaks as well of the reprobates as of Gods children. For the reprobates
shall have some opening of their ears, insomuch as they shall be feign to
perceive (spite of their teeth) that God speaks unto them. Howbeeit
forasmuch as they shake of that thought, and thrust it under foot: they
continue always as deaf. In the mean while the good men take profit of it:
for they know it is no striving against God. And whereas Eliu adds, that God
seals his instruction: he speaks of such as are so dull upon the spur,
and so stubborn as God can not subdue them by his word. Therefore such as
do so shake off all doctrine, must be forced too hear God speak after an
other fashion: that is to wit, God must be feign to beat them, and to teach
them with hard stripes, and to show them by force, that he is their master.
Ye see then how this streyne ought to be understood. Therewithal let us
mark well the manner of speech that Eliu uses here: which is, that God
signeth or seals his instruction by chasticements. Hereby he shows, that
chasticementes serve to make the instruction of authority, when men reject it,
and make no count of it: and that could not be, except the instructions of Gods
word were matched with his chasticements. For if God should but only beat,
without sending any knowledge of his will: what a thing were it? Therefore it
behooves him to teach us with his beating of us. And why? for if a father
beat his child, and dragge him about by the hear of his head, and tread him
under his feet, and yet speak never a word to him: the child shall be
utterly dismayde because he knows not what his father meeneth, nor why that
choler is come upon him, and so the child shall be never the better for it.
But if his father say to him, thou naughty Gods intent is to draw men from
their own works, and to hyde their pride. Here in he expresses, that God in
sealing his doctrine by afflictions, not only respects the magnifying of
his word, that it might have full majesty: but also therwithall procures
men's salvation. The end therefore, which God ameth at in afflicting us, ought
to be as sugar to seazon the bitterness which otherwise shows it self in
afflictions. Ye see Gods afflictions are combersome to bear* Yea truly* For
we shun al things that we mislike of And morouer Gods wrath is a terrible
thing unto us. Now whenever God punishes us, it is a token that he is angry
with us, and therefore we cannot but be afraid, grieved, and distressed.
Howbeeit God sweeteneth all this, by showing us, the end that he intends:
which is that he meeneth to frame us to his own hand, and that all his
seeking is to make us follow him too obey him. Thus ye see what Eliu adds
in saying, that God intends too drawemen from their own works. Now when he
speaks here of works, he meeneth not generally all things that men take in
hand* but the things that they do rashly and of their own head. For we know
that God has created us to labor, and that he will not have us to be idle
and unoccupied, but that every man should apply himself to that which he is
able, and that we should consider wherein we may serve both God and our
neighbor, and every of us employ himself therein according to the ability
which he shall have received. Therefore when God afflicts us he meeneth not
too draw us from our works, that is to say to make us utterly good for
nothing. True it is that when we be brought low with sickness, our arms and
legs be as good as broken, men must be feign to serve us, the world must be
combered with us, and we are able to do no service: but yet does not God draw
us utterly from all work: For patience is a work that God esteems above all
other things. So then (to be short,) God draws us not from all works by
afflicting us: but the works that are meant here, are the folish enterprises
that men take in hand. For if God let us alone and lay the bridle in our
neck, how bold are we to practice this or that? Nothing can stick with us:
in so much that we would remove heaven and earth. I must do this (say we) and
I have such a way to go. We see now that God intends to hyde the pride of
men. For herein he shows the welspring of all our enterprises, which is the
pride that is in us. What is the cause then that men do leap after that sort,
and fling themselves in the air, and make such kicking and wincing? Eue^ their
foolish ouerweening which blinds them. For if men knew themselves, they
would be tame enough. But they

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledging of
our faults, praying him to make us feel them better than we have done. And
for as much as he has chosen us to be of his household: let us desire in any
wise to be guided by his hand in all simplicity and reverence, and that for
as much as he has kindled the light of his word amongs us, we may be governed
by it unto the end, and our mynds maynteined in such pureness as they ought to
be, so as we may from day too day grow and increase in the knowledge of his
word, until we come to behold his glory fully and perfectly, and be
transfigured into the same: and that although it behoue us as now to pass
through many battles, and to feel unto what wretchedness we be subject in
this world: yet notwithstanding we may be vphild always by his power, to get
the upper hand of al temptations, to the intent that his goodness may
strengthen us more and more to walk in his obedience. That it may please him to
grant this grace, etc.

The.Cxxv. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxxiij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the.xvj. and.xvij. verses, and then upon the
text which is added here.

18 He plucketh back his soul from the grave, and his life that it should not
come to the svvorde.

19 He chastizeth man with grief upon his bed, and breaks his bones with
chastizementes*

20 So as his soul refuses bread, and his life the pleasant meat.

21 His flesh is consumed so as it is seen no more: and his bones also
which are not seen, do clatter.

22 His soul draws to the grave, and his life unto them that follow at
death.

23 If there be an eloquent messanger ( one among a thousand) to shevve a man
his righteousness,

24 That God has pity of him, and says, deliver him, to the end he go not
down into the pit: I have found atonement.

25 His flesh shall come again more fresh than a chyldes: and she shall
return to the days of his youth.


WE saw yesterday that God must be feign too draw us by force from our
foolish enterprises: because that naturally we be so presumptuous, as there
is nothing but we would be meddling with it. If God should but only warn us to
be myld, and not to thrust forth ourselves ouerhastily why w^e fall not intoo
the grave, is that God afflicts us. But therewithal Eliu shows us that it
consumes our flesh, so as we have no more the shape of man, but are like
unto dead men that are taken out of the earth, and our bones do clatter
without, and we can not so much as take breathe, but are in continual
tormente, so as we have no release, but God persecuteth us with such
extremity as we can no more. Thus he shows that God can not at the first
blow win that thing at men's hand, which were to be desired: that is to
wit, that they should know themselves wretched and full of infirmities, and or
a pit. Then are we ready to fall, not to break our arms or our legs, no
nor only to break our necks: but also to perish for ever, and to be wiped
out of the book of life, and to be cut off from the kingdom of heaven. Lo to
what state our pride brings us. For so long as we flicker after that sort in
the air, and think we have any strength of our selves, and build thereupon
after our own fancy: I say so long as we be possessed with such foolish
presumtio^: we are always ready to stumble and to perish. But God having pity
on us, sends such remedy as he knows to be convenient: which is, that he
afflicts us and beats us with his rods. If we grudge and can not be
pacient when God does so chastise us: Is it not an extreme unthankfulness, not
to suffer God to remedy our destruction and to draw us from it? So then let us
mark well, that here the holy ghost meant to make gods chasticeme^ts sweet and
amiable to us, to the end we should bear them* quietly when they be sent us.
Mark that for one point. Verily this will seem strange too fleshely reason.
For [oure fleshely reason will saye] could God provide no better mean for
our welfare than by tormenting us after that sort? Behooved it him to send us
to death that he might call us unto life? Surely it is an incredible manner of
proceeding if a man debate it according too his own reason: and he will think
it but a foolishness that God should kill us in pardoning us. For what are
afflictions? Signs of his wrath: and we know that all diseases are the
messengers of death, and that all the sorrows which we conceive are drownings
of us. But our Lord sends us sorrows, sicknesses, and torments, and holds
us in them as upon the rack till we can no more, and till we faynte in such
wise as our life draws to the grave. For these words concern not the small
afflictions where with we are accustomed: but they concern Gods sending of us
to so great extremity, as there remains no more hope in us. And how is that?
must God cast us into the bottom of death, to the end to draw us out again?
But so works he, and we must not plead against him, for we shall always
have the worse end of the staf. And out of doubt, that is the cause why the
holy scripture says, that it is his ordinary manner to kill before he quicken,
and to bring to the grave before he raise to life. Then let us understand that
God intends here to exercise our obedience, by trying us to the uttermost
so as we can endure no more, no nor so much as draw our breath, but seem to
be utterly choked. Therefore when our Lord brings us to that point, it is
to the end to know whether we be wholly his, and whether we can abide to be
governed by his hand or no. Howsoever the world go* when we be tempted in our
troubles and greefes, let this sentence come to our mind to comfort us
withal: behold it is said that tha: God breaks men's bones: that is to say,
uses so great violence, as there remains no strength at al in them
unconsumed. Their flesh wastes and consumes away, so as there remains but
an image of death: and a man is so continually tormented, as he is like a dead
man. It is not without cause that all this is that God consumes ^ll a man's
flesh, that he bruseth and breaks, that he swalloweth up, and that he
kills men. And why? to quicken them. And so although his anger be dreadful
unto us when he visits us with rigor, and that we be driven to feel the
things that are contained here: yet notwithstanding he cheereth us with the
hope of salvation, which is the only mean to bring us unto life. Wherefore
seeing that our God gives us hope, and that we be not the first that have been
so dealt withal, but that he has handled his servants after that sort in all
times: let us suffer our selves to be as it were swallowed up of sorrow, and
to be set there as in a gulf. And truly we see that Eliu following that
which has been showed in the foresaid song of Moses, speaks not so
without cause. Mark then how this sentence ought to serve us to double use.
The first is, that when we be in rest we must take time to bethink us how
dreadful Gods wrath is, to the end we may walk in fear and carfulness
and submit our selves under his hand. And the second is that we must not be
too much afraid when God visits us so roughly, knowing that he has dealt
after the same sort toward those whose salvation he has procured. Then let
us not think it strange that he should deal so with us, but let us learn to
fashion ourselves like unto those, which have waited to be fully comforted at
Gods hand after they had bin in heaviness, yea even after they had been
swalowed up of sorrow. And therewithal let us mark also the long continuance
of our afflictions, whereof Eliu speaks here. For he says not that Gods
afflicting of a man in such wise as he shall seem to be utterly forlorn,
shall not be only for one brunt* and to relieve him again byandby after: No,
but contrariwise when he lays his hand upon those whom he intends to
afflict, he makes it heuier and heuier, in so much that if a poor creature
be sore tormented to day, it shall be double to morrow, and afterward be so
increased, as it shall seem to have another end nor measure, and it shall
continue so long, that he shall pass through a hundred dethes, before God shall
seem to relieve him. So little then shall we be delivered from our afflictions
immediately when we have felt them: that they must be increased more and more.
For it is the good pleasure of God, that we should fight against many deaths.
Truly this seems right hard unto us: howebeit let us mark that a rough
horse must have a rough ryder, and that for as much as we be tough wood, it
behooves us to have hard wedges and hard strokes with a beetle. True, it is
that we think not ourselves to be rebels against God* but if we consider the
thing as it is, without flattering of ourselves: we shall find that the
nourishing of wilful stubbornness in us* is no small nor common thing. Some
chawe upon the bridle in such wise against God, that although their
afflictions increase, yet they cease not to gnashe their teeth still, and to
play the wild beasts. And an other sort pretend some token of humility: but
what for that? They be so fickle, that to day or to morrow it is quite out of
their heads. So long as a man is hild at a baye, he will undoubtedly say I have
offended my God, it behooves me to turn a new leaf: and he will not only
make countenance before men thorough hypocrisy that he is willing to amend:
but he will also think himself to be utterly changed, and that there is no
more any wicked affection in him. But what? if God deliver him to morrow
morning, he will become worse than he was, or at least wise as bad. See in
what plight we be. And therefore let us not think it strange that God should so
increase his strypes. If he see that we can not be won, but that there is
such a sturdinesse in us as that he chastizeth man with greef upon his bed.
When Eliu speaks so, it is to show us that if God punish us in good earnest,
that a man forsakes his meat, in so much that he finds no taste in pleasant
meats, and would feign be out of the world: It is to show us that when we be
touched with the feeling of Gods wrath, and have conceived it too the quick:
we can find no taste in any thing. What is it then that gives us taste of all
the benefits that we received at Gos hand in this world? It is his grace.
True it is that the heathenishe sort, and the despysers of God which are saped
in their sins, and are become utterly brutishe, and feel no more sting of
greef: do find taste enough in their pleasures: yea even in their beastly
pleasures: For they have not yet conceived the wrath of God. But as for those
that feel God against them, they must needs mislike al things that are
desirable of their own nature, yea and utterly loathe them. And why* For they
cannot take pleasure, even to live. Although this life be full of much
wretchedness, and is as it were a Sea of all miseries: yet must we set store
by it, because God has set us in it, and preserves us in it, to the intent
we should know him to be our Creator and father, according as in deed the
end why we were created, and why we be mainteyned in this transitory life: is
that we should know how it is God that interteyneth us here, and that we should
feel his fatherly goodness, in that it pleases him to have a care of us and
to govern us. So then our life ought to be dear unto us in that respect: and
when he shows himself angry, our life must needs be bitter. For it is
impossible that a man should not desire too be fordon when he feels that:
according as it is wri^ten that they shall say too the mountains, cover us.
Thus ye see to what point we are come. And therefore let us learn to find
taste, first of all, in the goodness of our God, to the end that the rest of
his benefits may be pleasant unto us, and that we may find savor in them. I
say let us learn to taste the goodness of God: that is to say let us not be so
given to worldly things, as that our cheef mark should not be to say, let us
seek to obey our God, and to submit our selves quietly under his hand. Ye see
then, what we must desire. Have we so do one? whenever we enjoy the benefits
that he gives us, whither it be in eating and drincking, or in the rest of our
life: let our rejoicing be in such wise, as it may be wholly referred too the
acknowledging of the fatherly goodness of our God, too say, behold God does
well show the care which he has of our welfare, seeing he voutsafeth to feed
our wretched bodies. Behold, they be but dead carkases, and yet God voutsafeth
to nourishe them. Ye see then that it behooves us to eat and drinck in such
sort, as we may think continually upon the goodness of our God. Furthermore
when all things be out of taste with us, and that we be so ouerpressed with
anguishe as our very life is hateful too us: let us consider from whence the
same proceeds. And that is because God has hidden his co^tenaunce from us,
and we feel no more his fatherly goodness which should make us too sinde taste
and sauoure in all his benefits. So then if we mourn and be in perplexity
and anguishe, let us pray God to make us feel his goodness which as yet is
unknown to us. And when we feel that, let it serve us not only to take breath
by, and to set us in rest: but also to restore us in such wise, that whereas we
were utterly dismayed before, we may gather new courage and come again to the
flower of our age, according at it it said here byandby after. Thus ye see
what we have to bear in mind. To be short, it is said that the flesh of a man
shall waste away, such a messenger as is hardly to be found amongst a
thousand, and he shall bring him a message of righteousness, [that is to wit]
he brings him word that God justifies the sinner, and receives and
accepts him into his favor Ye see then after what sort we be restored does
it still also daily by his ministers. True it is that Iesns Christ is the
party that has let us looce from the bondage of sin and everlasting
damnation, wherein we were by nature: But yet has he committed the same
charge to all she peherdes of his Church. Ye see then that the thing which we
have to bear in mind when Eliu shows us the mean whereby God restored those
whom he had sent as it were unto hell, and which were as good as drowned: is
that he sends them a messanger that is able to warrant them righteousness.
And he speaks purposely ryghtuousnesse, not because those which ought to
comfort us should use flatteries too make us believe that we be ryghtuous,
and preach unto us our own virtues and merits: no: but the righteousness
which he speaks of here, is that God is made at one with us, And how is
that? Because he imputes not our sins any more unto us. Then are we
rightuous, not in our selves nor through our own virtues, but because it
pleases God to forgive us. And it is a point which we ought to mark well.
For when the world seeks ryghtuousnesse, justify. It might well said that we
find favor or grace when God pardons us, according also as it is often said
so: but the holieghoste thought it not enough to use such words. And why? For
one among a thousand: It is to make us set the more store by the benefyte,
whereof we sildome make account: that is to wit, of the mean of our
atonement or reconciliation. Then is it declared, that the same is no base nor
common thing. It can not at all times be stumbled upon that we should have a
man sent of God to warrant our salvation, or to be the mean of our
atonement with him: and therefore it is no such thing that we should cast
it under our feet. And that is the cause, why the Prophet Esaias says: how
beutifull are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of peace? Now by the
feet the Prophet meeneth their coming and presence, as if he should say, if
the world knew what a benefit it is when God declares his mercy unto it,
it would love and esteem those that preach the Gospel, and it would
acknowledge that God has committed such a treasure unto them, as surmounteth
all the goods that we can wish. Saint Paul also alleging the same text,
applies it to show that the preaching of the Gospel is a singular gift of
God. Then let us not think that the same comes of men: but let us be fully
assured and resolved, that God seeks us when his Gospel is preached unto us.
God must be the builder thereof, such goodness must proceed from him: and
therefore if we father it upon men, it is too great an unkindness. Wherefore
let us beware that we deface not the goodness of God: and when the Church is
in such order that we have preaching and all other things: let us assure our
selves, that it is all one, as if God came to seek us, to bring us to
salvation. And there withal let us know, that he grants not that grace and
privilege to al men. In good soth there are countries which we esteem, and
also (to the worldward) are to be more esteemed than we: which yet
notwithstanding have not the message of salvation. Let a man go through the
whole world, let him search al nations, yea even those which have been most
excellent in times past, let them go seek in Greece where al sciences of the
world were enclosed, as it seemed: let him go into Italy, into France which
now is in some estimation, or let him go into Spain: And what shall he find,
but utter desolation? For there, not only those which ought to be the
messengers of salvation are utterly dumme, but (which worse is) ye shall
hear mastie dogs barking out blasphemies against God, and ye shall see
wretched souls led too destruction, and the Devil hunting every where after
his pray. For undoubtedly look how many preachers go up into their
Pulpits, so many dogs are there to hunt and fetch in the game, and too bring
it into Satan's toils, that the wretched souls may go to damnation. But
here we have Gods promises preached unto us, to lead us to salvation.
Therefore we see it is not without cause said, that a faithful messenger of
Gods grace, is an odd man among a thousand, and so rare a benefit, as we
ought too esteem hyghly. How be it this is not said to make us esteem the
persons, but to make us to receive the benefit which is ministered unto us by
them with the greater reverence, that is to say to make us receive the grace of
God, for so much as it pleases him to draw us to him, and to justify us of
his fatherly love, showing us that although we be wretched and miserable, and
that there be nothing in us but death and damnation, yet he will not leave
us there, but deliver us by the mean of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, praying him so to
make us feel our faults, as we may mortify all our lusts more and more,
and be withdrawn from the corruptions of this world, and frame our selves to
seek unto him: and that for as much as in this mortal life we be subject to
much wretch ednesse and misery: It may please him to reach us his hand from
above too deliver us from them, after he has once taken us from the gulf of
death. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us, but also to
all people and nations of the earth, etc.

The.Cxxvj. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xxxiij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the xxiij. xxiiij. xxv. verses, and then upon
that which is added here.

29 He shall pray, God and appease him, and behold his face in triumph, and a
man's righteousness shall be restored unto him.


WE saw yesterday that when God afflicts us, he procures our is as an odd
man among a thousand, so as he is not to be found at adventure, but is a
treasure which God reserueth to those whom he thinks good. Besides this, I
have told you that God in promising men the forgiveness of their sins,
gives charge and commission too the ministers of his word, to draw them from
death, according as it is expressly said, that the keys of the kingdom of
heaven are committed to those which preach the Gospel. Too what end? To
forgive sins: not of their own authority, but to the intent that the
wretched sinners God will have mercy of a man when he sends him a good and
faithful teacher, and gives his appointed ministers the said charge and
office of rescuing and delivering the wretched creature that was in way of
damnation. How be it to the end that all these things may be the better
understood: here are three points to be marked. The one is that Eliu shows
us the cause and foundation of the forgiveness of our sins: namely that God
is merciful unto us, and of his infinite goodness will not have us to perish.
That is one point. The second is, that the office of such as preach the
Gospel, is to draw wretched souls out of death, and to set them at liberty.
And the third is, that the same is not done, but by express commission given
of God: according also as it belongs not to a mortal man to take upon him so
high a thing, which is above our ability. Then as touching the first point we
see that the holy ghost brings us here to the welspring, of the grace which
we obtain of God. When he forgiueth us oursinnes, why is it? Not for that we
are worthy of it: not for that we are able too be beforehande with him: not
for that we bring any thing that ought to procure his favor toward us: but
because he looks upon us with mercy. To be short, the holy ghost fathereth the
remission of our sins upon the only free goodness of God, for we be so
wretched as there is nothing but damnation in us. Behold, it pleases God to
succor us, and he does it not for any thing that he finds in us, save only
infinite miseries: but of his own goodness which moves him thereunto. This
then is a point which we ought to mark well, to the end that when we come to
obtain forgyuenesse at Gods hand we may not imagine to appeaze him with our
own merits, nor to be particausers of the remission of our sins, but look
upon that which is told us here: that is to wit that when God will have pity
of us, he receives us to mercy out of hand. And so Eliu meant to aduertize us,
that God does not always make us to feel that goodness: but that although he
love us, and be minded to provide for the things which he knows to be
profitable for us, yet does he not always give us that feeling, but hides it
utterly from us: as when God afflicts us, it is said that he turns his
back to us, or else that he voutsafeth not too look upon us, or else that
his countenance is louring toward us, and that we be not able to behold it.
Then let us mark well, that the faithful shall now and then be dismayed, and
seek God, and not be able to find him: not that he has forgotten them, or
rejected them, but because he will not as then make them too feel his love.
And that is the cause why Eliu says expressly that God is merciful to us
when he sends deliver the sinner or set the sinner free. For when God gives
express charge to such as speak unto us, to draw us out of the gulf of
death, that we might enter intoo Paradise, it is all one as if his voice
sounded Therefore if we stick to that simplicity, we may be sure that the
commission comes from above, and that men take not ne usurp not any thing
upon them of their own brain. Thus ye see what we have to mark upon the
word where it is said, that God will pity him and deliver him. Then must every
whit of it come from above, and none but God only must work in this behalf
by his free goodness, according also as he himself protests by his Prophet
Esaias saying, I am he, I my self am he which wipeth out thine iniquities O
Israel. Then must too the end that his soul should not enter into the pit.
We have seen already heretofore, that the wretched sinners are near to the
grave, and that they are as good as dead and consumed so long as God pursues
them with rigor. But now Eliu adds, that God preuenteth that mischeef by
sending the said message of the release of our sins, so as we fall not into
God has found reconciliation: let us mark that he intends here to express
yet better, the thing that he touched even now. Which is, that we must father
the atonement which God makes with us, upon Gods own free goodness, and
that it is he which works, yea even before we could have any thought or
mind to come unto him. For he must be feign to seek us when we be gone astray
and have forgotten him, according too the saying of the Prophet Esaias. True it
is that we are often commanded to seek God, and to turn unto him when he have
offended. according as it is said in another place of Esaias, behold the
acceptable time, behold the days of salvation. And why does he term the time
of salvation an acceptable time? Because God has choze^ it of his own mere
goodness. And that is the cause also why it is said in another place of Esaias,
Comfort ye, Comfort ye my people, shall the Lord say. Thus is it his doing
too comfort us in our afflictions, or else we should be swallowed up with
sorrow. And therefore he adds, that he repents him at the heart, that he
had scourged his people, and tells them that a man being so comforted by the
message that God sends him, becomes young again and is restored, and his
flesh becomes as fresh as a young chyldes. VVherin he shows the true mean
of co^forting us. Which is not to forget God, and to seek fond vanities to
sotte our selves withal: but to be certified of Gods goodness. And it is an
article which we ought too mark well. We see after what sort men labor too
comfort themselves: namely, by forgetting God: For it seems too them too be a
melancolike matter too think upon him. And in good sooth, how many are there
which will say stoutly enough, that they be us in his goodness. And this is
it which Saint Paul meeneth when he says, that the peace which passes all
man's understanding shall get the upper hand in our hearts. When he speaks of
this peace of God, he meeneth the gladness which in given us through the
remission of our sins. And further he says, that the same peace passes al
man's understanding. And afterward he adds, that the same gets the upper
hand or victory in our hearts. His meening is that while we live in this world,
we shall have many troubles and greefes, yea and be in danger that a man shall
pray unto God and appease him, or find him favorable. Behold here yet one
point more which imports very much: For without this calling upon the name
of God, we know not rightly the fruit of the joy that is spoken of here. For
wherein consists all our welfare? Even in that we may boldly come unto God,
and have leave to rest as it were in his lap when we be afflicted, so as we
know that knowing that we shall always find him a pitiful and merciful
father toward us, if in seking him we hold the right way as he shows it us.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him so to put them away, as we may not doubt, but that he
will accept us as ryghteouse for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake: and to grant
us the grace that our coming too present ourselves unto him, may be, not only
to be discharged of the burden of our sins, but also too be so cleansed, as
he may dwell in us, and so govern us by his holy spirit, that we may walk in
all obedience to his law and to his holy commandments which he has given
us. And so let us say, Almighty God our heavenly father, we acknowledge and
confess according to the truth, that we be not woorthye to lift up our eyes
to heaven, to present our selves before thee, nor to presume so far as that
our prayers should be, etc.

The* cxxvij. Sermon, which is the sixth upon the* xxxiij. Chapter.
26 He shall pray unto God who will be favorable to him: he shall see his face
with joy, and he will render ( or return) a man his righteousness.

27 He will look toward men, and say, I have sinned: I have turned away from
goodness, and it has not profited me.

29 He has redeemed my soul, to the end it should not go down into the
grave: and my life to the end it should see light.


ACcording to that which was declared that God will show him his face, and
that his righteousness shall return unto him by that mean: or else that a
man shall see the face of God. But we must not greatly stand upon the words,
seeing that the meening is evident. Therefore it is all one as if it were said,
that so long as men are accused in their own conscience, that righteousness
shall be restored unto a man. Eliu had said heretofore that if a wretched
creature be in trouble, so as he feel Gods wrath and vengeance, there is no
way to comfort him, and specially to restore him too life, except the gospel
be preached, and that God send him some man to tell him his word purely, whereby
the wretched sinner, that was ouerwhelmee, may know that the gate of paradise
was opened unto him. In discoursing hereupon, Eliu said that the preacher of
the gospel should declare to him that was so afflicted, his righteousness. And
what is that righteousness? I have declared already, how it is not that men
are righteouse in themselves, or that they are able to stand before God: but
that this righteousness is, that God burieth their faults and imputes them
not unto them, but cleanses them of his own free goodness. For the blood of
Jesus Christ is the spiritual washing of our souls, namely when they be
watered by the holy Ghost as saint Peter says. And there ye see also the
understanding of this text, that a man's righteousness shall be restored unto
him or return to him again. For so long as God pursues us as a judge, and
summoneth us too yield up our account: we be overwhelmed by our sins, and
there needs no other process nor witness against us. But when God calls
us to himself, and shows us that there is good remedy for us too be
discharged of the bond of death, wherein we are bound: (which remedy is to put
our whole trust in the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to
receive and embrace the promises of salvation which he gives us) that is the
returning of our righteousness unto us, which had bin erst alienated from us,
and whereof we had bin utterly bereft. So then let us he will look toward men
and say I have sinned, I have turned away from goodness, and it has not
booted me: he has delivered my soul from the pit: This text is expounded by
some men as he will look toward men and say I have done amiss, I have turned
away from goodness and it has not stood me in any stead, or was not meet
and convenient for me: a man may see and easly gather, that Eliu goes on
still with his matter, showing that they that there is no welfare but in his
mercy, and that we are all damned, if the only goodness of our God remedy it
not. These (say I) are the three degrees which it behooves us to keep. But I
told you that we must begin at ourselves. And why? We shall see many which
will blase abroad Gods praises with full mouth, but they have not well
foremynded the^ in their heart. There are which think themselves discharged when
they have said, O my God, have pity upon me, I have been such a one, I have
done such an evil deed. True it is, that such men have some that he will
have an eye unto me^. And it behooves us to mark the order, whereof I have made
mention already. For Eliu began not at that point, but said at the entrance,
that the sinner shall be wakened: namely, for that God shall send him remorse of
conscience: and if he receive not that, nor become the better for the warnings
which are given him, nor be afraid of Gods justice for all the threatenings
that are made unto him: he shall feel his hand so hard and heuie, as he
shall be enforced to perceive his own confuzion, and to be grieved at it, and
to become as a dead man. I have sinned, I have turned aside from goodness: I
have been a wretched man. Here then it is showed us after what sort God ought
too be glorified by us: that is too wit, we must acknowledge that he only is
righteouse, and that there is nothing but iniquity in us, as S. Paul says
in the third too the Romans. For when he says there, that God is justified:
he meeneth that we ourselves must first be condemned. I have sinned, I have
turned away from goodness, and it has not profited me: The holy ghost
shows us that our confession must be pure and freeharted, and that we must
not speak by halues as the hypocrites do which say. O it is true that all the
world is sinful and all men are faulty: and so (too their own seeming) they
are well quit. Surely there is no dallying after that sort with God: but we
must set forth our sins to the uttermost: that is too say, we must feel
them to be an intolerable burden: according also as we see that Daniell
does, saying: Lord we have sinned. Is that all? no: but he adds, we have
dealt wickedly, we have traitorously transgressed the law, and we have been
wilful and froward. For what cause does Daniell pack so many words together
and make such a heap of them? It is to show us, that such as will discharge
themselves so lightly too Godward with speaking but a word of their faults and
away, are but hypocrites, and never felt what their offenses are. So the^ let
us mark well, that there is no superfluity in this text, where Eliu, (after
he had showed that the sinner which is quit at Gods hand, will confess his
fault,) says not only, I have sinned, but also adds I have turned away from
goodness. VVherin he does us to understand, that a man must not stick to
confess his det fully, and to say, I have been utterly froward and maliciouse,
I have bin given to all wickedness, I have strayed (...) and clean from the
way of salvation, I have be(...)elf against God, and I have given myself
wholly unto Satan as much as was in me. Thus ye see how we must deal: [that
is to wit,] not for countenance sake, but so as the heart do speak before God,
and then the mouth also agree with it, too confess before men what we have
felt within ourselves. And this is in effect the thing which is showed us here.
But now let us apply this too our selves, and consider what entrance we give
unto God, to lay forth the treasures of his goodness toward us. For a man
shall see nothing throughout but hardness of heart, and shamelessenesse. How
many are there in these days that humble themselves? Nay, contrariwise al are
wild beasts, and those which be most faulty are least ashamed too mainteyne
their wickedness, and to set up their bristles against men whensoever they go
about to amend the^: and yet notwithstanding these men cease not too vaunt
themselves of the gospel. As for reformacion it is nothing worth with the^,
and yet it is the Apcee of the christians: And what is the first lesson that
we ought to bear in mind, but only this: namely that we may be enlightened,
to know the wrath of God, and to feel how haynouse our sins are, so as we
may be sorry and utterly ashamed of them: and that we may embrace Gods mercy
and take hold of it, to the end to be reconciled to him for our lord Jesus
Christ's sake, and by the mean of his death and passion: And finally, to
confess our wretchedness before men, to the end that the whole praise may
be yielded unto God, as meet is it should be? Behold I say whereunto we
ought to inure our selves. But what? as I have touched before, when men have
done amiss, and that not lyghtely but grievously, so as one becomes a
drunkard, another a whoremayster, a third a swearer, the fourth full of malice
and cruelty, and another a beater of him that seeks nothing at his hand: If a
man showed them their faults, what shall he see? wild beasts which can by no
means be tamed, and which he has delivered my soul from the pit, and my life
from entering into the grave. Truly this cannot be thoroughly dispatched as
now, but it must suffize us, to have a short abridgement of it, as need
requires for the joining of this part too that with I have declared already.
Discourse has bin made of the confessing of sins, how me^ ought not to be
ashamed to condemn themselves, and that afterward it behooves the^ immediately
to add the praise of God in that they have known his goodness. And therefore
it is said, I have sinned, I have turned away from goodness, yea, and It has
not booted me at all: But my God has drawn me out of the pit. The^ as soon as
the holy ghost has taught us to acknowledge our wretchedness and to be ashamed
of it: he will have us immediately to preach gods mercy, according as we have
felt it, how he suffered us not to perish, as we must needs have don if he had
not helped us. And let us mark well how it is said here unto sinners, that it
shall not boot the^ to resist their maker. Then what shall we gain when we hyde
our sins and think not upon the^, but rather nourish them by fond
selfelyking? Alas, alas, it is always too our greater destruction. But when
God discovers our iniquities, and makes us too feel them, the^ does he
procure our profit. For therein he provoke us too resort unto him. Thus ye
see the first point that we have to mark in this streyne: and further let us
mark also, that when God shakes us off and lays our wickedness too our
charge, there is no remedy but we must be forlorn, until our God be pitiful
to us, and receive us too mercy. And therefore whenever God forgiueth our
sins, it is all one as if he raised us from death, so as we must conclude,
that when we be so reconciled unto God, then has he wrought a resurrection
in us. We were dead, and there was no hope of life in respect of our selves,
and he reaches out his hand to make us alive again, and too draw us unto
him. So then let us learn to magnify the grace of the forgiveness of
sins, acknowledging that God does raise us to life, as often as it pleases
him to receive us to mercy. And forasmuch as we see that Satan ceasseth not to
thrust us from so great a benefit, let us be so much the more inflamed and
provoked to exalt it highly as it deserves.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good

The.cxxviij. Sermon, which is the seventh upon the.xxxiij. Chapter.
And the first upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.

29 Behold, God does all these things thryce to a man.

30 To d^avve back his soul from the grave, that he may be enlightened with
the light of life.

31 Mark, O Job, and hear me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.

32 And if thou have matter, answer me and speak: for I desire to justify
thee.

33 If not, hear me, hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.


The.xxxiiij. Chapter. 1 ANd Eliu spoke again and said:

2 You wise men hear my words, and you men of understanding hearken unto me.

3 For the ear tries words, and the mouth judges of meats.


WE have seen heretofore how God provides for our welfare. For in as much as
we are wretched creatures, ne on his part must be feign to remedy our vices,
or else there will be no hope of us. Ye see then, that we be utterly
forlorn and undone, if God have not pity upon us. And the mean has bin
declared unto us: namely that he teaches us to receive his grace, sometimes by
the chasticements which he gives us, rods are not so well printed in us, as to
make us remember them as were requisite, and that we are not earnest to call
upon him, but had lever gad about, and wander away in our own vanities, and
in stead of seeking our salvation, we be harried here and there, and our
wits are so wavering, as they cannot rest where they should, and therefore
do continually roue abroad without ceassing. And whereas Eliu sets here
Three tunes: he meeneth many times after the manner of the holy Scripture.
Which is, not to determine any certain number, but to the intent to draw
back* he betokens an enforcing necessity. True it is, that god could well
save us without this mean: but here is no disputing of Gods mighty power: and
Eliu has respect too our state, which also is the point that we must rest
upon. And therefore let us learn, that if God should deal gently with us, and
let us alone in quiet, that we might sleep in our sins without waking: it
would be the cause of our destruction. Then is it needful that we should be
handled with such rigor as we oftentimes are: yea and if he bare not with our
frailty and feebleness, he should be feign to use a far greater roughness
toward us. Therefore howsoever a man be afflicted, he ought to bear it
pacie^tly, assuring himself that God does it not without cause, no nor even
without a necessary cause. Also therwithall we have to mark the comparison
which is set between the grave, and the light of life. What is it when God
with draws us back from death? And why does he bring us to the light of
life? ye see on the one side an extreme misery, ye see also one the other
side a sovereign benefit. And therefore let us learn, that if God suffer us to
follow our own lusts we make have always toward the grave: that is to say, we
do nothing but plundge ourselves into utter destruction, out of the which we
ca^ never get out again. Lo what man would do, if God should give him the
bridle. And hereby we have good cause to mislike of ourselves, considering the
frowardnes that is in us. True it is that every one of us will say he is
desirous to go unto God, and to attain to salvation: but in the mean while
what do we? look upon our life, look upon our thoughts, look upon our whole
doings: and it will seem that we be mad in seeking our own destruction. For
we cease not to provoke the wrath of God, as who should say, we could never
come soon enough to the depth of our misery. Seeing then that we be so given
too all evil by nature, as though we were desirous to perish wilfully: let
every man learn to know himself, and to mislike of himself, and thereupon
suffer God to govern him, seeing our own guyding and government is so
wretched and unhappy: and let us forget all the foolish presumptions wherewith
the world is so sotted, that every man thinks himself wise enough, if he may
have his own free will. Lo how men deceive themselves in making themselves
believe that they have great store, both of wisdom and strength. But
contrariwise we see that God had need to correct by force this cursed
affection of desiring to know more than is meet for us. Therwithall on the
other side let us consider whereunto God calls us, when he draws us back
from the grave into the light of life. He sets us not in some middle state,
to say, ye shall not be stark dead, ye shall but la^guish: but he calls us
to the light of life, that is to wit, to that newenesse whereby we are
regenerated to the incorruptible and heavenly life. The matter then concerns
not Gods delivering of us only from death: but also his bringing of us to his
everlasting kingdom. And although we walk in many corruptions here bylowe,
and are beset round about with them, yea and that they dwell in us and are even
in our bones and maree: yet will God guide and govern us, even till we come
into his kingdom. Thus ye see a comparison which confirms yet better the
infinite gracious goodness of our god, to the end we should be the more
stirred to seek him: and when he shall have brought us into the right way,
indeuer our selves to go forward from day to day: and when he shall have
drawn us back, suffer him to teach us, and desire him to continue his
teaching still. And here withal let us mark also, that we must not be
discouraged though we do oftentimes fall back and seem to clyue asunder. And
when God has set us in a good trade, and that we be as it were thoroughly
tamed, if the vices of our flesh happen now and then to get the upper hand
of us, so as we be driven from him, and our infirmity grows into misbeleefe,
so that God will work many times in a man, to the intent too bring him into
the light of life. Therefore when we be come unto God, and have had a sure hope
of salvation: if now and then we fall into trouble and anguish, so as a
suddayne storm seems to ouerwhelme us: let us not therefore cease to trust in
God. And why? For it is said that he will begin his work new again in us:
not that we should give our selves the bridle, (let us beware of that,) but
that in the mean Job hear me, give good ear, at leastwise if thou have no
matter against me: for I stop not thy mouth, speak, if thou have
wherewith to justify thy self: if not, hold thy peace, and hear me speak,
and I will teach thee wisdom, for I desire to justify thee. As if he
should say, I would feign that thou we be bound unto God for all things which
we have, in so much as the honor ought to be yielded unto him as to the
beginner and performer of all* he adds that all men should give ear to it,
and hold their peace, according also as S. Paul says in the third to the
Romans, which I alleged one of these days paste. Now when Eliu says, that
he is desirous to have Job quit: thereby he shows that he went not to it of
a fierce and contentious mind, (as me^ are wont to do when they will mainteyne
a contrary part) nor of purpose to grieve the man. No, but he would hear me
ye wise men, give care to me ye men of understanding: for the mouth judges
of meats whether they be sauery or no, and the ear tries words. Here Eliu
does first of all tell us and advertise us, that this doctrine is not only
for the rude and ignorant, but also for all men: and therefore that no man must
hold skorne of it, as though he were learned enough already: for the wisest may
be more confirmed here, and find that they loose not their time in harkening
to that which is said and contained here. And undoubtedly if we knew what is
in us, we would be more attentive to hear the doctrine that is daily preached
unto us. And first of all, is it not a thrusting away of God, if we take
skorne to be taught, as though he had ordained an unprofitable thing? Behold,
it is Gods will that the Gospel should be preached, and that men should hear
it and give ear unto it. But has he said that ought too be done but only
of the ignorant, and of such as are still as it were in their Apcee? No: It is
spoken to the whole body of his church, insomuch that he will have both great
and small to follow that rule. And S. Paul shows that we must continue in
this order till we be come to the perfect age, even to the age of our Lord
Jesus Christ. But where shall we find this perfect man? He is not to be found
in this mortal life: we must be bereft of this mortal body, and God must
have taken us home too himself, before we can come to this perfection. So
then seeing it is Gods will that the whole body of his Church should be taught,
yea even the perfectest and excellentest sort: shall it not be to lewd an
ouerweening, if we bear men inhande that the doctrine is superfluous for us,
and that we have no need of it? let us look upon the example of S. Paul
who was a mirror of Angelike holiness, and yet notwithstanding he says
that he indeueed still to go forward daily. When he was near death and had
foughten valiauntly for the honor of God, yet still he forgatte all that he
had done before. And although he had served God faithfully and suffered many
things for his names sake: yet notwithstanding he had his eye always upon
that which was remaining, and said, I must not regard that I have done one
thing or other, and in the mean while fall asleep and not indeuer my self
too pass further: but I must keep on forward and streyne my self to come to
that which remains. Herein (say I) S. Paul shows us well what we have to
do. So then let us mark, that we must not be to nice to shake off the
doctrine which is set before us, as though it could serve us to no purpose, or
as though we were learned enough already. For here the spirit of God
exhorts the wise men, and men of most understanding, to hear and receive the
things that are said. Therefore we see that Gods wisdom is so infinite, as
it can never be thoroughly comprehended. So long as men live in this world, it
is enough that they have some taste of it, and profit daily more and more in
it. On the other side, let us mark well, that when we have learned any thing,
we keep it ill, and forget it out of hand: and therefore we had need too
be put in mind of it: and God is so gracious unto us, as to set his mercy
before us, to the end we should not be utterly as it were desperate and paste
hope of trusting in him. For the understanding of a thing in our brain, is not
all that we have to do: but it must more over be printed in our heart. This
doctrine is not speculatyue or a gaze, (as men may term it) as humane sciences
be, (for in them it is enough to have conceived what they be:) but this must
be rooted in our hearts. Now let us consider whether we have such a belief of
Gods will, as we need not to be daily put in mind of it, and showed it. And
so it is to be concluded, that the wise men and men of understanding are
counseled here to harken and give ear: and thereby (as I said) all
loftiness must be laid down, and we must intend to be taught of God. And so
much the more must we follow the rule that is given us here, because we see
that the world finds no taste in Gods word. The ignorant For the mouth
(says he) does serve to taste meats, and the ear to try and judge words.
Hereby he betokens, that such as disdain to give ear to God and to his
truth to be taught by it, and seek not to be confirmed more and more in the
things that they have heard already: peruerte the order of nature, and become
as it were monsters, and worse than brute beasts. And why? also that we are
so buzied in our earthly cares, that some (...)arre themselves with eating and
drinking, and are always at their gluttony and riot: and other some are busy
in pinching and gathering, and desire nothing but too heap up more and more:
and other some follow their whoredom, and other some their ambition, to get
them estimation and credit in the world, let us bethink our selves better.
Seeing then that we be hilde so fast here beneath, what is to be done? Let us
indeuer to turn away from all these pluckings back, and consider wherefore our

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgeme^t of
our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may learn to be sorry
for the^, and to withdraw our selves from these earthly things, and be
contented to be visited by his hand after any manner of way, acknowledging our
selves to be so wretched and miserable creatures, as we deserve well to be
utterly overwhelmed by him, and yet not forbearing to resort to his mercy,
assuring our selves that he is ready to receive us into his favor, and
therefore desiring him to make us continually to taste his goodness more and
more, to the end that in passing through the afflictions of this world, we
may not ces^e to be comforted and to rejoice in him, and to bliss his holy
name, fith that he has once showed him self a father and Savior toward us.
That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us, but etc.

The Cxxix. Sermon, whch is the second upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
4 Let us chooze a judgment, and consider among our selves what is best.

5 For Job has said, I am rightuous, and God has overthrown my right.

6 I also am a lier in my right: mine arrovve is grievous without any sin.

7 What man is like Job? he drinks skornfulnesse as water.

8 He walks with those that work iniquity, he walks with the wicked.

9 For he says, a man shall not please God in vvalking with him.

10 And therefore ye men of understanding hear ye me, God forbid that there
should be wickedness in God, or any naughtiness in the Almighty.


WHen the case stands upon yielding of account of our life, we must not
look too have any other judge than God, who (notwithstanding any appeal,
(will give sentence of us according too his own knowledge, and then will it be
in vain for us to reply, for we shall gain nothing by it. Howbeeit for
as much chooze men (says he) to judge betwixt you and me. True it is (as I
have said) that there is no reason why God should abace himself so far. His
meening is no more but to show, that although we had liberty to cite him and
to plead our case against him: yet should we always be overcome. After the
same manner does he deal here in this text when Eliu says, Let us chooze
judgment, according as he had protested heretofore that he would not be
afraid to speak. Forasmuch then as Job had complained that God abashed him
with his majesty the least doubt which we can have of Gods righteousness, and
the least disputing that we ca^ make with him, is blasphemy though it seem
not so to us. Let us mark well the^, that here the holy Ghost discovers the
malady that was as it were hidden, to the end we should understand, that
whenever any fancies come in our head to darken gods righteousness, or to
deface his glory by any means, although we purpose them not: yet are they
horrible faults, and we cannot condemn them enough, another are they venial
sins as the Papists make them. For that Job had walked with the wicked. As
how? Does Eliu accuse Job too have been a despyser of God, and a man of
disordered life, seeing that heretofore he had protested that he had walked in
such perfection, as it was hard too find a man like unto him? For we have
seen that he was the eye of the blind, the feet of the lame, and the father
of be ready and willing to condemn our selves. But as for those that deal
stubbornely, and will needs dispute and check with him: they shall find in the
end, that their wilfulness shall serve them to no purpose, but to put them to
double confusion. And so we see it is not without cause that God has
distinguished his law into two tables, to show us that the service and
honor which we owe him, goes formest: and that then follows the duty
which we owe to our brethren. The service of God therefore must be as the
foundation of our whole life, so as we must I am rightuous and God has
overthrown my judgment. It is not meant (as I have told you before) that I am
made a lier in mine own right. Thereby he signifies, that he was not
admitted in his own defense: which is all one, as if some Judge were
unreasonable and cruel, and would oppress some good and rightful that Job
drunk scornefulnesse as water: it is meant that he was so dulled, as he
perceived not that the words which he had used, were uncomely and worthy to
be rejected, and that he had deserved to be scorned as a witless man. Yet
notwithstanding we have seen that Job spoke many excellent sayings, yea and
that he was the instrument of the holy Ghost, so as we may gather great
learning of the things that he spoke. Seeing it is so then, why is it cast in
his teeth, that he drunk scornefulnesse as water? It is because that when a
man's passions are so inflamed that he knows not what he speaks, it cannot
be but that he must be carried away after that sort. Now if this befell unto
Job: I pray you what shall become of us? His patience is set down for a rule,
and I have told you that the end which he had, shows that there is nothing
better for us than to abide the good pleasure of god in all the chastisementes
which he sends us: whatsoever they be. And yet for all that, he is accused as
a shameless person that drinks lewdness as a fish sucketh in water. If
this be laid to his charge, and rightly: I pray you what shall become of us,
when we see our selves a hundred times impacienter than he, and that there
needs no furtherance to make us chafe and fret against God? Ought we not too
think that we are worse than dull? So then we see in Jobs person that the
holy ghost meant to show us what we be when adversities comber us ouersore, and
that our frayltie and feebleness are so mingled with them, as we know not
where to become, but gnashe our teeth and chawe upon our bridle, and are so
straught, as we neither keep way nor path any more. This is it then which we
have to mark in this streyne. Now let us come to the sentence which Eliu
adds. He accuses Job to have said, that it profits not a man to have
walked with God. This walking with God imports that a man so gives himself
to the service of God, as he thinks continually to give an account, and
acknowledges in himself after this manner: he that has created and formed me
governs and guides me, I cannot shun his hand nor escape his judgment, and
therefore I must be present before his eyes, so as he shall see, not only all
my works, but also my thoughts. Lo what it is to walk with God. And the holy
scripture does purposely use that kind of speech, because me^ are like Coliers
sacks (as they say) which make one an other black. And experience shows, that
when we walk without having an eye unto God, there is none of us but he takes
liberty to do evil, under the shadow that other are as bad as himself: and in
the mean while also gives occasion to other of his neighbors to do evil:
insomuch that at this day, there is not any of us, but he gives evil example
by some means or other, through the vices which all of us have of our own.
And therefore when we walk with men, we walk in horrible confuzion: all our
life is like a hotchpotch, or a dark dungeon, so as nothing can be discerned
in it. Behold (I say) what it is to walk with men. But what is to be done?
Seeing that in walking after the world, we become worse and worse, and every
man draws his neighbors unto evil, and he himself follows them as fast too:
Is it not a perverting of all order? Then there remains nothing for us, but
too gather us unto God, and to frame our selves wholly unto him. It is said that
Enock walked with God. And why? Because he was not perverted, and although the
whole world was at that time as corrupt as might be, yet notwithstanding Enock
the unbelievers. So then although he seem to have forgotten us, yet
notwithstanding we must assure our selves that he will pity us, and that in
the mids of his rigor he will assuage his stripes, yea and that we shall be
discharged at his hand: for we should be overwhelmed a hundred thousand
times, and utterly perish, if he preserved us not by his infinite goodness.
Thus much concerning this point, wherein Job was condemned for saying that it
shall not boot a man at all to have walked with God. It is not for that he was
thoroughly persuaded it was so: but because God forbid that ever there should be
iniquity in God, or unrighteousness in the Almighty. Here we have to note,
what the sum of Elius words is, that

Now let us fall down before the face of our good god with acknowledgeme^t of
our faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may be sorry for
them, that we may hate our wicked life past, and do our indeuer hereafter to
frame our selves to his will, that he may receive us to mercy: and that in the
mean while he will so govern us by his holy spirit, as we may seek
altogether to please him, and to frame our life to his holy service. And so let
us all say, Almighty God our heavenly, etc.

The.Cxxx. Sermon whch is the third upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
10 God forbid that there should be unrighteousness in God, or iniquity in
the Almighty.

11 For he shall render unto man according to his work, and cause every man
to find according to his vvayes.

12 God will not condemn for naught, neither will the Almighty overthrow
right.

13 Who is he that has visited the earth besides him? or who is he whom
he has set over the world? or who has builded it?

14 If he turn his heart toward him, and dravv away his spirit and his
breath.

15 Then shall all flesh fail together, and man shall return into dust.


WE have too lay forth this sentence which seems to be meetely common,
namely, that there is no unrighteousness in God. Every man confesses it, but
few do know it, and are fully persuaded of it. If we be at rest, and God do
to us as we that he will render unto men according to their works, and make
every man find according to his ways. This ought to be well noted. For to
know that God is rightuous in himself, is not all that is to be done: his
righteousness is not so shet up that God will render unto a man according too
his work, and make every man to find according too his ways: It is not so
meant as though God punished the breakers of his law out of hand, and
mainteyned the good: but it is to show that God does no man any wrong. Then
may it well come to pass (as it happens daily) that God will bear with the
wicked for a time: for it is seen that he makes no countenance when men
run riot in all evil, nor seems to think upon them, nor to see them. And
that is the cause also to harden the wicked to make them the bolder. For under
the color that God punishes them not out of hand, it seems to them that
they be quite escaped and discharged. So then god does not always punish evil
doings out of hand, another does Eliu meene that he does so. But in the end when
God has delayed a long time, and prolonged the term of the wicked: at length
he will show that although he waited for their repentance, yet he forgot not
their misdeedes, but registered that God will render recompense, or requite.
Saint Paul speaking of the righteousness of god, says not that he will
recompense from day too day, but that God will render, he presupposes the
thing that is true: namely that it behooves us to hold our minds at a stay,
until God show us the things that are hidden from us for a time. Our faith (I
say) must be exercised in waiting patiently for the things that we perceive
not as yet. It is enough for us that God gives us some tokens of his justice,
and shows us some notable examples, whereby we are enforced to feel, that he
has an eye unto men to punish for us is, that when we see that God calls us,
and allureth us to come unto him, we fall to feeling of our offenses before
the blows come, and be sorry and mourn for them, so as God may be inclined
to forgive us. Lo what we have in effect to remember in this sentence.
According hereunto Eliu for the greater confirmation of it, says, that God
will not condemn for naught, nor overthrow the right. He speaks no new
thing, but ratifieth his own matter, even by aunswering unto that which was
alleged by Job. First therefore he says, that God will not condemn for
naught: that is to say, men can never allege, that he does them wrong, or
that he makes them believe that they have done amiss [when they have not,]
according as oftentimes a poor innocent shall be oppressed among earthly
Judges, by charging him with a thing of nothing, wherein he is not faulty, and
yet he must be fame to pass that way, and there shall be false witnesses too
face him down though he were the righteousest man in the world. There then a
man may oftentimes be punished wrongfully and without cause. But it is not so
with Gods justice: that God will not overthrow the right. For when we have no
better shift, we flee too this startinghole, that God is almighty and does
what he list, and we cannot resist him, and that he deals crosly and
ouerthwartly with us. And although we speak not so: yet have we such crooked
thoughts, so that under the color that God is Almighty, and that we be poor
and frail creatures, we would make him believe that he tormenteth us to sore.
But contrariwise, it is said, that God peruerteth not the right: that is to
say, that he never punishes men without a continual respect who is he whom
God has ordained too set over the world besides himself? Albeit that the
word which Eliu uses here does sometimes signify to visit: forasmuchas
the sense is all one, we need not to stand much upon the word. To be
short, Eliu meant to say, that there is none but God which governs the
world, and that he has not any fellow, neither is there any other creator to
have builded the heaven and the earth, but he has all in his hand, and
guydeth and governs all his creatures at this day: so as nothing is done
without his will. Ye see in effect what Eliu meant to say here. But it should
seem that this reason is not fit to mainteyne the righteousness of God. For
his mightiness is not in question here: and besides that, (as I have touched
already) sometimes under the color that God is Almighty, men would accuse him
of tyranny, as though he had no regard of our infirmity and weakness. Mark
then how men take occasion to advance themselves against God by confessing his
almightinesse, saying: It is true that he is the souereine, but yet it follows
not therefore that he has not good stay and government of himself as he ought
to have. For albeit that men vex and torment his servants: yet it seems that
he passes not for it, nor has any regard of them. But contrariwise, Eliu
intends to show, that God is righteous And how shows he it? For he only
(says he) governs the world. This seems to be nothing to the purpose. But
when all is well considered, it is a peremptory reason (as they term it) and
sufficient enough to stop all our mouths. And this is it which he meeneth by
this which he adds immediately after: namely, shall he which is unrighteous
govern? True it is that in respect of the world, the wicked shall sometimes
govern. And why? For behold kings which are borne of women, come to the crown
by heritage, and so likewise the Princes. And they bestow offices upon their
bawdes, and upon men of no value, as it is well known what manner of ones these
Courtiers are: or else they sell the offices, and so all justice goes to
wrack. And how are things handled where governors are ordained by election and
voice of the people? Not in the fear of God, nor in reverence, as though they
meant to ordeyne officers that should reign with justice: but with flocking into
tauerns, and there they commit the shamefullest things that ca^ be. Then seeing
that kings and their officers and magistrates that go by election, come to
their degree by so devilish means: the wicked must needs reign. But it is
not so with God And why? Because that naturally he has the souerein dominion
of the whole world, and the same is due unto him: he was not chosen to it by
rascals that would feign have all confusion to reign, and which chose such as
should support them in their evil, and do nothing but overthrow al good order
and common weal. God was not chosen in a Tavern by parcialitie, briberie and
wicked practices: he was not called to his office by favor: neither has he it
by succession of heritage, as though his Peers had agreed that he should
succeed after a mortal father: there is none of all this in him. What then?
He has the government of that besides him there is none set over the world,
nor none set over the earth: and that is to betoken, that his creating of the
world, and his governing of it, are things that go jointly together. The^ if we
imagine that god governs not all things, but that some things happens by
chance or fortune: it follows that fortune is a Goddess that has created
part of the world, and so is not all praise due to God alone. But behold, it
were a cursed blasphemy if we should think that the devil could do any thing
without Gods leave: for it is all one as if we should make the devil a
particreator of the world. Therefore let us learn that there is an inseparable
bond between these two things: namely that God creates all things, and that
he governs all things. And that is the cause why it is expressly said, that
God has builded the world. And do we then think, that he now calls a
companion to help him to order his creatures? True it is, that God does use
inferior means to govern the world: howbeit, that is not to diminish his
own authority, or for that he will have any companion: for he reigns
continually from above. What else are the greatest kings, but only Gods
hands? And he serves his turn by them as he thinks good. According as he
by his Prophet Esaias vpbraydeth the proud Sennacherib, who thought himself
too have made all things by his own cunning. Yea (says God) what art thou
else, but the axe in the hand of him that heweth? If a man hold a saw or a
knife to cut withal, and too serve his turn at his pleasure, can the tool
turn it self against the man? No: but it is to show that a man has not only
his hands and arms to help himself withal: but also that he has the things
that are without him at his commandment. Is there any power in mortal
creatures, but from the living God? do they not hold all of him? Then are we
nothing if we be separated from him. For it is he in whom we have our life,
moving and being. Therefore let us understand, that when God uses worldly
means, and serves his turn by men, as by instruments: that is not to lessen
or to strengthen his own authority, but contrariwise to show that he has the
guiding of them, and that if he do but command or whistle as he himself
says, men must needs go forward to execute his will, yea and the very devils
of hell are compelled unto it. And although they be unwilling, and that it be
utterly against their intent: yet notwithstanding God drives them by violent
power, to execute the things that he has ordained in his providence. And so we
see now after what sort we must consider Gods providence: namely, that he has
a care of the whole world, and watches over al his creatures, not only to
foresee what may happen (as some fantastical persons imagine that God
beholds the things as it were aloof, which are here beneath, and then
provides for them afterward) but also (which much more is) that nothing may be
done which he has not determined, so as his will is the rule of all things.
Thus ye see what is showed us in this text. And therefore it behooves us to
mind well the providence of God, too the intent that when any adversity
befalls us, we may always go to the first cause. True it is, that diverse
times men shall do us us wrong, as we see how they had robbed Job of all his
goods. Men then may spoil us of our goods by deceyte or violence, or they
may oppress us by slanders and wicked reports, yea and a man may be
wrongfully slain. In these things it behooves us too acknowledge Gods
providence as Job has done. He set not himself against the thieves which had
robbed him, but says the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away: and
yet notwithstanding Satan had been the worker of it. But Job knew that God
which made the world, does always watch to govern and guide it, as is
showed here. that if God turn his heart unto us to take away his spirit and
breath, all flesh shall fail, and by and by we shall be changed to dust. Here
Eliu matcheth Gods mightiness with his goodness. And so he shows, that
when we be governed by Gods hand, we must needs feel that he is good and
merciful toward us, in that we perish not every minute of an hour. And
why? For what needs there more too turn us into dust, and too bring us
utterly to nothing, than only the look of God? it is said that if God do but
blow upon men, immediately their freshness changes and withers, and
fades

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins* praying him to inure us more and more to the considering and
knowing of them aright, so as we may learn, not only to confess them, but
also to condemn them in our life: and every of us particularly too do the
things which all of us ingenerall are exhorted to do and therewithal suffer
our selves to be guided by his hand, and patiently receive all the adversities
that it shall please him to send us, to the end we may not settle our selves
to much upon this transitory life, but aspyre upward to the everlasting
kingdom whereunto he calls us, where all our joy and felicity shall be
truly accomplished. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to
us, but also too all people and Nations of the earth, bringing back all poor
ignorant souls from the miserable bondage of error, etc.

The.Cxxxj. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the. 14. and. 15. verses, and then upon the text
which is added.

16 If thou have understanding, hear what I say, give ear unto my words.

17 Shall he govern that hates judgment? or shall the wicked condemn him
that is righteous?

18 Will a man say to a king, thou art unfaithful? or unto princes, you are
wicked?

19 *He accepts not the person of the great ones, neither regards he the
high or the low: for all are the work of his hands.

20 All shall die suddenly, and at midnight the people shall be taken away and
perish, and the mighty shall be taken away even without hand.


I Have told you heretofore, that men are here put in mind of their own
frailty, to the end they should know that God spares them, and that if we
abode but one minute of an hour upon the earth, we ought to think the same a
gracious turn of his. And why? If we have any life and then withdraws his
breath to himself, when he sends us into dust and rottenness: and yet
nevertheless, he fails not to take up our souls, and to keep them till the
latter day. To be short, Eliu meant to show here, not only that we be weak and
transitory, but also that al our strength is nothing, furtherforth than it is
vphilde by the only goodness of God. And when he undoes us too outward
appearance, that is to say, in effect, he does but the thing which he had
determined as he thought good. And that is the cause why we ought always to
return If thou have understanding hearken to me and give ear too my words.
Here he shows again, that the beginning of true wisdom, If thou have
understanding hear me. For he shows, that if a man have wit and reason,
he will always suffer himself to be taught, that he may fare the better by
it all his life after. Then on the contrary part, we must mark, that if a man
stand stubbornly in the thing that he has conceived, and give not men leave
to tell him their mind, nor will hear any thing at all: he is but a fool, or
rather stark mad. For it is a kind of very madness, how durst thou say to
a king, thou art unfaithful, or unto princes, you are wicked? If th^^ had
a sovereign Lord that reigned over thee, thou would stand in such awe of
him, as thou durstest not missebehaue thy self toward him. Then let us see if
it be not a devilish furiousness, for men to presume too murmr against God?
For what likeness is there betwixt them? A king may be wicked, what majesty
soever he have: and when princes and governors are wicked, they will very ill
discharge their duties: and yet notwithstanding me^ bear with them, by reason
of their state. But behold, God which accepts no man's person, breaks these
great ones that are so honored of the world, and razeth the^ out as well as the
little ones, showing well that he makes none account of the loftiness of his
creatures. And hereupon who dares open his mouth against him? Now then we see
what Elius intent is. Howbeit, for the better understanding of this text, let
us mark that although princes and gouerners be not such as they ought to be:
yet nevertheless God will have them to be honored: and although that of
themselves they be unworthy of it, yet has God imprinted his mark in them,
and will have men to do him the honor to say, very well Lord, these reign in
thy name, and therefore it behooves us to be subject unto the^. And surely this
is no vain trial. For if all such as are in authority did rule like good
fathers, and that we saw with our eyes that they had none other care but to
govern us well: what matter were it to obey the^? We would do it in respect of
our selves, and that were no obeying of God, but only a regarding of our own
profit. Contrariwise, when wicked and froward persons have authority over us,
and we see notable faults in them: If we nevertheless be mild to hold our
selves under their bridle and yoke, it is a token that we reverence god as he
deserves. Seeing it is so: we be bound for his sake too obey those whom he
sends, and whom he ordeyneth too be our superiors, although they be
unworthy of it. And that is the cause why it is said in the law, Thou shall
not rail upon the ruler of thy people. God shows well that there shall be
Tyrants: and he manaceth his people with that punishment, saying expressly that
he will chastize them by sending them wicked governors, which shall seek
nothing but too pill and oppress, and too reign in all outrage: and yet
nevertheless he wills men to honor them. Why so? For although they
deserve not that men should acknowledge them for their superiors: yet
notwithstanding will not God have those to be received for his sake, which
otherwise are nothing worth? Ye see then that we must be subject too such as
have public power and authority, because we know it is Gods will to humble
us after that manner. Yea, and we see that the children of God have bin feign
too submit themselves in bondage too the unbelievers, when God did bring them
to it. And truly we see also the example as chafe and set themselves against
God, than the reverence which they bear too men. Such as spewe out their
injuries after that sort when God handles them not after their own lyking,
and murmr saying, I cannot tell what God meeneth by it: is it meet that he
should plague me after this manner? Why suffers he the wicked too do the
worst that they can, and the good too be turmoyled, and yet in the mean while
he remedyeth it not? I say if a man should ask these fellows that make
such disputations, and are that be will not accept the person of the great:
but without regarding either rich or poor, lays his hand upon all men, and
rooteth them out in one night: and even the strongest shall be taken away with
out hand. When we hear this, let us understand, first that such as are
great must not trust in their riches, credit, knowledge or any thing else.
True it is, that to the worldwarde they shall be honored, and it will seem
that they are able to mainteyne themselves, because they be rich, and have
well wherewith, and also because they are in favor: but all these things are
nothing with God. Therefore let no man be proud of his own greatness. For
such as stand gazing like Peacocks at their own tails, do but run headlong
into their own confusion. For inasmuch as they flatter themselves, they become
always the bolder too do evil: and that is no more but a further kindling of
Gods wrath against them. Ye see then, that great men ought too put this
doctrine in ure, of knowing that God accepts not men's persons: and by the
means thereof they ought also too look that they trample not the little ones
under their feet, and such as are under their power. Mark here too what
end this doctrine is applied, and to what purpose it is told us, that God is
no accepter of persons. And why: Too the end that he which has servants
should not oppress them, but use them uprightly as Saint Paul declares: and
that he which is in public authority, should have such a regard in
governing his subjects, as to know them to be his brethren, because that all of
us are the children of God and he has done us so much honor, as to make us
the members of his only son our Lord Jesus Christ. So then let the great men
of this world learn to abstain from swallowing up of the little, and from
using of outrages toward them: and let us all learn to absteyn from
aduauncing our selves proudly against those that be our inferiors. And why?
For there is no accepting of persons before God. And if men trust so in the
shadow of their riches and credit, let us assure our selves that God will
judge them without regard what they be now, yea and that their damnation is
ready prepared for them, so as they shall be forced to feel that they are a
part of the shape of this world which vanishes out of hand, as Saint Paul
says. And heerewithall let us mark well how it is said that both great and
small shall be taken away in the turning of a hand, and that God will make
all too be wyped away at midnight, in the time when folk give themselves to
rest, and when every man seems too be at his ease: yea and that the strongest
shall be taken away without hand, that is too say, without any preparation.
God shall not need too arm many soldiers, or too prepare himself greatly
too overthrow the greatest and strongest. He needs no more but too blow
upon them, or else too turn away his heart, to the end too draw his spirit
from them, and all shall perish as has been declared heertofore. Hereby we
may be taught every man in his own state. So then let the great ones know,
that Gods aduauncing of them, is not too the end that they should dispyse
others, nor vaunt themselves in oppressing the lesser sort: but rather let them
know that they are so much the more bound unto God. For what have they of
their own? And seeing that all things be given them: ought they not therefore
too acknowledge from whence they come? Above all things let them remember what
S James says, let the brother (says he) which is exalted too the worldwarde,
glory in his lowliness. And why? For if the rich and such as are honored, or
be men of skill and credit, do glory in their highness: they forget
themselves in so doing, and are unthankful to God, and throw themselves hedlong
intoo destruction. Therefore it behooves them to look nearly unto themselves,
to know that they have nothing but of the mere goodness of God, and that
forasmuch as they hold all of him, it behooves them to dedicate themselves
wholly unto him, and not too take that God will wipe away the strongest without
hand: it is too the end we should learn too put a difference betwixt God
and men. For when the greatest princes intend too be avenged of their
enemies, they have need too arm men of war, and too seek means too bring
their enterprise about. But if that God will destroy the strong without hand,
too the end we should not think too escape though we have furnished our
selves, and provided long aforehande for all our matters, so as it seems
unto us that God cannot come near us. Then let us not ymagine these vain
fancies, for God can tell well enough how to entrap us by some mean that we
cannot conceive. Our destruction shall come without hand, or without
inferior mean. Lo how we ought too mind these sentences, when it stands
upon the fearing of God and his wrath. But therewithal on the contrary side
we have a comfort, in that it is said, that God will save his people without
bow, without spear, without swoorde, and without the hand of man.
Therefore like as we be taught there too humble our selves, and too know
that all the means in the world shall not avail us, if God be our enemy:
and as every of us is taught to rid himself of the vain pride wherewith
we be puffed up by nature: And finally, as we be exhorted too modesty,
too the end we should present our selves before God, and consider that if he
turned away from us, he could every minute of an hour change us and bring us
too nothing, and pull down the highest of us all: so on the contrary part,
when we be misintreated and oppressed here beneath, and we see great
alterations, so as the Tyrants become like woolues to devour the sheep and
flock of God: let us resort too this warrant, that God having promised to save
his Church without man's help, will put the same in ure, even unto the end.
Then although we be destitute of all worldly helps, so that we seem as it
were left up too the spoil, and our enemies are furnished of all things that
may serve them too destroy us a hundred thousand times: yet let us trust in
the mightiepower of God, which is invisible too the world. We perceive not
how God will maintain us: and undoubtedly it is a strange thing how he
mainteyneth us at this day: but that is too the end we should be always
confirmed more and more in his doctrine, that we shall be saved without the
hand of man: that is to say, that God will utter such a force, as is yet
hidden from us, and as we conceive not, when it shall please him too pluck us
out of the VVoolues throat, and too mainteyne us. Now if God must work after
such a fashion to preserve us in this temporal life, I pray you what shall he
do for our salvation, which is a far higher and preciouser thing? Will God
aid himself with man's hand, when it comes too the drawing of us out of
hell, and too the delivering of us from the tyranny of the devil and of
sin, too advance us too his heavenly kingdom, and to defend us against so
many temptations? No: but let us assure our selves, that he does it of his
own power, and of his own mere goodness. Ye see then that on the one side
it behoucth us too learn fear and humility, that we be not pussed up with
vain presumption to despise God, but rather tremble under him, considering
that we have not any thing to resist him, nor any other remedy, but to present
our selves before him, praying him to behold us with mercy. And afterward
when we be so dismayed and beaten down, let us come to the second point, which
is to be of good chere

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him so to open our eyes, that we may not be seduced by
hypocrisy, nor presume to advance our selves rebelliously against him, but
that we may be pacient eue^ in the adversities that he shall send us, and
learn to humble our selves under his majesty, to glorify him in all things,
and be well ware that we resist him not in any wise, neither with hand nor
tongue, but be ready to frame ourselves peaseably to his good will, knowing that
he is always just and upright: and that we may so live while it shall please
him too keep us in this world, as we may consider that our life depends
upon him, and that otherwise we should fail every minute of an hour: and
therwithall learn too yield him thanks for that it pleases him to continue
his goodness toward us, whereof we be so unworthy. That it may please him
to grant this grace, etc.

The.Cxxxij. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
21 The eye of Gods is upon every man's ways, and he sees all the steps of
a man.

22 There is no darkness nor dimnesse, so thick, where they that work
iniquities may hyde themselves.

23 God lays not more upon man, so that he walk with God in judgment.

24 He breaks the mighty without inquisition, and sets others in their
place.

25 For he brings their works to light, and turns the night to break them.

26 He smites them as wicked in the place of the Seers.


WE saw yesterday, that if God list to be knows men's ways, and marketh all
their steps. So the^ if any of these great chasticements happen, so as a
mighty people be overthrown in battle, and a Realm conquered: let us assure
our selves that God utters not such power without cause, but that he does
it through his justice. And though we perceive not the reason why God uses
such rygour: let us refer the knowledge of the whole unto that the ways of
men are known unto him. How happens it that oftentimes we enter into
disputation of Gods judgments, and think them strange. It is because we see
not so clearly as he does. Howbeeit, forasmuch as it is his office to judge of
men's ways, let us agree with him, and although we see not why he does it, yet
let us assure our selves that his case will always fall out to be good and
rightful, seeing that he ought to chastise not only [particular] persons, but
also whole Nations and Countries. This saying, that God marketh men's paces, is
taken two ways in the Scripture. For sometimes it is referred to Gods
promises, because he is careful too govern us. But in this text (as also in
many others) it is said, that God beholds our steps, because nothing is
unknown too him, but all our whole life must come too account before him.
Therefore let us walk as before his eyes: for it shall be in vain for us too
hide our selves, according also as Eliu adds, that there is neither
darkness nor mist so thick, that the wicked can bide themselves in it. And
not without cause is this added. For we see that although every man confess
that God beholds all our works, and must needs be our Judge: yet
notwithstanding, men do for all that bleare their own eyes, and not consider
that God perceyueth them. And surely it is not for naught said in the Psalm,
that the wicked bear themselves in hand, that God sees not their craftiness
and malice at all. Also they are vpbrayded by the Prophet Esaias, that they dig
themselves caves under the earth, too hide themselves from God. Seeing then
that hypocrisy does blind men so sore: It is needful too mark this
sentence, that there is no darkness so thick, that can hide the wicked from
Gods sight. And for the better conceyuing hereof, it behooves us first of all
too remember what I have touched: namely that men, although they be sure that
they shall one day come before the judgment seat of God: do neuerthe less
seek startingholes, and thereupon ouersleepe themselves in their lurking
holes, as though they could beguile God. See what an hypocrisy is this. And
heerewithall let us mark, that men deceive themselves there is neither
darkness of death, nor (...)ye mist so thick, as can bide those that work
wickedness. Therefore the Apostle in the Epistle too the Hebrews witnesses,
that like as God knows men's hearts, so he will have his word too be as
a two edged sword too cut asunder our thoughts and affections, yea and too
enter even unto the maree, too discover the things that are hidden in us. And
Saint Paul's meening is, that when Gods word is preached, we must needs be
reproved, as though all our articles were written against us, and our whole
life were laid before us, that we may be convicted, and utterly cast down,
too the end too glorify God, by acknowledging how greatly we be guilty
before him. And therefore let us not only cite our selves before Gods
judgment seat, too the intent too correct all feynednesse: but also as often as
his word rubbeth our sores, and rebukes our vices: let us take it patiently,
and not presume too be wilful. For what shall we win by it? We see many
men now adays which chafe and frette if their vices be touched: for they
would that folk should bear with them still. And that is all one as if they
would not that God should have any authority more over them, nor be any
more their Judge. But if they considered well what is said here: they would not
be so dull as they are seen too be, in that they be always new to learn
what things are. If a man show them any thing that is commonly known: they
are as scornful of it as may be. And why? Because they never felt the
auayleablenesse of this doctrine, how there is no darkness in Gods sight, but
defyle themselves, hanging their groynes down too the grounddwarde like swyne,
and sleeping after such a sort, as it should seem unto them that all their
sins are nothing, notwithstanding that he will not lay more upon men, that
they should come to judgment with him. This text is dyuersly expounded: for
some take it, as though God would lay no more burden upon a man than he
ought, and than a man could bear. But when the whole process of the text is
well considered, we shall find that forasmuch as this treatise concerns
Gods judgments, Eliu vpholdeth, that God afflicts us not after such sort as
we may have occasion too plead against him. It behooves us always too
consider what matter he deals withal. If a man will know what is meant by a
sentence, let him consider with himself: the case concerns such a thing, that
is the ground which is treated of, and thereunto must the whole sequel be
referred. Then if all things be considered, the general ground of this text,
is that men may peradventure grudge against God, but in the end they shall be
confounded. And why? For although God seem as now to handle us with great
rigor: yet when things are thoroughly well known, our mouths shall be
stopped and God shall be glorified, as it is said in the one and fifty
Psalm. Let us mark well then, how it is showed us here, that for all our
fair pleading against God, our case shall quayle in the end. And why? For it
will be found, that God has not handled us vnindifferently, nor laid too
sore a burden upon us, that is too say, he has not afflicted us out of
measure. For although he do now and then strike men more than they are able
too bear: yet is it not more than reason, nor more than they have deserved.
And hereby we be put in mind of the pride, or rather of the rage that is in
us, which drives us too murmr against God. For how do we plead with him?
It should seem by us, that there is some Judge or Vmper by whom he should
be judged. If God were to make an accounte, should we be the bolder too spite
him, when he handles us not after our own liking, and that things come not
to pass as we would have them? Then let us learn, that men are here
condemned of the devilish pride which provoke them to plead against God.
Howbeit, it behooves us to consider well, that God will not abace himself so
far as too answer us when we summon him to the law: he will not in this
case appear as our counterpartie. True it is (as I have declared before) that
he will doubtless come thither: but to what end? Even to show the thing
that is told us here: that is to wit, that although we had the that God will
break the mighty, yea even without inquisition, and put others in their
place. And why? For he will bring their works to light, and turn the night to
the dark, to the end too break them. Whereas he says that God will break
the mighty without inquisition: it is to the end to make us feel better the
authority which we despize so boldly, because we be too dull. True it is that
some in stead of this word inquisition, do translate number: as if it were
said, although the mighty were infinite in number, yet notwithstanding God
would not fail to break them. But word for word it is thus: he will break
the strengthes or multitude of men: For the word imports either of both: and
afterward there follows, there shall be no inquisition. For as much as the
word inquisition is there: and that it signifies properly to search or make
inquiry: no doubt but Eliu meant to say, that God needs not to make any
inquisitions as earthly judges do. For in as much as they are creatures, there
is no ignorance in them, and therefore they are feign to help them selves by
such means. For they can not prophecy of things. But for as much as all
things are open before God, he will judge men without any such kind of
proceeding as we see in commonweals in this world. But yet there is more in
it: which is, that Eliu meant to betoken, that God will not always make us
privy why he executes his judgments, but we shall be blind in that
behalf. This inquisition then whereof he speaks, is properly referred unto
God in chastizing men. As if it were said, when judges make out a process, it
shall be commoned of, and the form and style of it shall be observed, so as
men shall know the things, and afterward the sentence shall be published,
that men may know the crimes of the offendour, and after what sort he was
convicted. But we must not measure Gods mighty power and authority by these
laws of men. And why? For he will break without inquisition, that is to say,
without showing us why? He will not always publish his sentence: men's offenses
shall not always be rehearsed there: neyshal it be uttered why we are
punished: that shall be hidden from us: But yet in the mean while, he will not
cease to put his judgments still in execution. Now we see the natural
sense of this text. But yet notwithstanding he adds, that this thing is not
done unjustly: For God (says he) will bring their works to light. Although
then that God punish without inquisition (that is to say without such form
of proceeding as is requisite in worldly policy:) yet does he all things with
reason and uprightness. And if this be not perceived at the first day, let us
tarry till all things be discovered, and till he bring the things to light
which are now wrapped up and confounded together. And here we have to take
warning, that we flatter not our selves as we have been wont to do. For behold
what is the cause why we do continually follow our own sway, when God
seems to spare us, and think we have liberty to do evil because we are
unpunished. It is because that when God begins too chastise us after the
common manner, we perceive it not, but are forepossessed with a blockish and
fleshely carelessness. And afterward when it comes to great roughness, we
be so dismayed, as we know not where we be if he thunder upon the suddeine.
Which thing he does when he thinks good. For after he has for borne a long
time, he needs no more but to lift up his hand and men perish in the
twinkling of an eye, as has been said before. Therefore to the end that every
of us may stir up him self with it both early and late: let us remember this
text, that God will not make long process in punishing us, nor is bound to any
laws. Let us consider (I say) that we must always be in a readiness, and not
delay til he smite us, but rather advisedly prevent his judgment, according as
it is said that the man is happy that God having so broken the great and
mighty men, does put other in their places. And again on the other side it is
said, that he punishes them in open sight, yea and that he punishes them as
offenders. I have said already, that whereas it is said, that God discovers
their works, and punishes them in such sort: it is to the end that we should
always stand in awe of Gods justice, and not imagine that he uses any
tyranny or cruelty. Therefore let us keep us from surmising any such power in
God, as should be uttered without reason. True it is that that God punishes
them instead of the wicked. that is too say, in such sort as the wicked, to
signify that they can win nothing by their replying, nor allege any thing
to clear themselves, specially seeing they appear not to be clear before
men. Mark that for one point. And another is, that he says, that he puts
others in their place. And that is to the end we should know the cause of the
chaunges which happen oftentimes in this world. According also as it is said
in the hundred and seventh Psalm, which is a right exposition of this
sentence. We be as it were straught, when we see a plague to unpeople a
country, or if there happen a famine, or if the land that has bin very
fruteful becomes barren, as if salt had bin sown upon it: or else if all
things be so troubled with wars, as a country is laid waste, or the Princes
thereof are changed: when we see any of these things, we are astonished. And
why? For we know not Gods providence which reigns above all worldly means,
neither do we think upon men. For if we considered after what sort men behaved
themselves, we would not think it strange that God should make such chaunges
and alterations. Thus ye see why it is expressly said, that God puts other
in their places: namely, to the end that when we see things change in the
world, we should not think it any novelty. And why? For therein God shows
himself to be a Judge. Let us not father them upon fortune: but let us assure
our selves that God does there utter his arm, because men can not maintain
them selves in the possession of the benefits which he had bestowed upon them.
And thereupon let us consider what our unthankfulness is, that we may amend
it. For as soon as our Lord has made us fat, and set us up in any wealth:
byandby we turn our selves too kicking against him, like horses that are too
much pampered. And is it any wonder that God lays his hand upon us, seeing we
are so proud and unthankful? Let us mark what the modesty of men is now
adays. When God does them any good, do they so behave the^ selves as they may
possess it long? No: But contrariwise, they spite God to the end he should
bereeue them of it by and by. Seeing then that the pride and unthankfulness is
so heydous, as I have said: we must not grudge at the change of things, nor at
the great number of alterations. And why? For we provoke God unto it? Howbeit,
it is not enough to know that God takes away one people and puts another
in their place, and sets new inhabiters in a country, and remoueth men
after that sort: It is not enough (I say) to know these things, yea and that
he does them justly: but also even when we be in our best state, let us pray
him to grant us the grace to enjoy his benefits in such wise, as we may still
possess them, and be guided by them, to the everlasting heritage which is
prepared for us in heaven. Thus ye see how we ought to put this sentence in
ure: and as for the rest, it shall be reserved till tomorow.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to receive us to mercy, and therwithall (after he has
humbled us under his mighty hand, and made us feel his just corrections to
our ame^dment) to indue us with the gracious gifts of his holy spirit, and to
increase the^ more and more in us, till we be fully reformed to the glorious
image of his righteousness and Majesty. And so let us all say: Almighty God
our heavenly father, we acknowledge etc.

The.Cxxxiij. Sermon, which is the sixth upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
26 He strikes them as wicked in the place of the Seers.

27 Because they have turned away from him, and have not considered all his
vvayes.

28 To make the cry of the poor come unto him, and too make them hear the
outcrie of the afflicted:

29 And when he sends quietness, who can make trouble? when he hides his
face, who shall see him, as well upon a nation as upon a man?


WE saw yesterday after what sort that he does it in the place of seers.
Wherein he shows us, that Gods judgments ought to be thoroughly known unto
us even for our instruction. For when God punishes sinners, it is that God
chastises offenders in the sight of men, or in the place of seers [or lookers
on]. Hereby we be warned to take better heed than we have done, in noting and
marking Gods judgments. It is a great because they turned away from him, and
considered not all his ways. Over and besides that we have seen already that
God strikes not men wrongfully, but to punish their sins: here it is showed
us what is the welspring of all evils: that is to wit, the withdrawing of our
selves from him which is the fountain of all righteousness. For our life
ought to be so ruled, as we should obey God and seek him, and walk as it
were in his presence. And therefore when a man is gone away from him, he cannot
but run into all confusion: and that is the cause of men's destruction. So have
we a very profitable lesson in this text, to show us how we may keep our
selves from going into destruction. And that is by holding our selves as it
were shet up under Gods wing, and by clinging unto him to obey his will. If we
have this wisdom in us: it is the thing wherein our welfare lies. But
contrariwise if we forget God: can we escape his hand? If our life stray here
and there, we are undone, and damnation is at our backs. For it is said that
God will in open sight and after a terrible manner, punish those that run away
from him. But let us mark well, that Eliu speaks not of such as had been
brought up in the law, and had had the Prophets, and been taught the doctrine
of God familiarly, but of the Heathens which had had but a small taste of the
light, and yet notwithstanding for as much as they gave themselves unto evil,
it is said that they were withdrawn from God. And why? For although he were
not so near unto them, as unto those to whom he had given his law: yet
notwithstanding we must hold this for a general rule, that for so much as
God has set us in this world and created us after his own image: we according
to the order of nature, ought to tend unto him, and to make him our mark to
ame at. Therefore when we run that they considered not all his ways. VVherin
it is signified unto us, that men are never so ignorant and unskillful, but
that there is naughtiness enough in them to make them guilty, and to bereue
them of all shifts before God. Here (as has been declared already,) Eliu
speaks generally of the whole world: for he was no Jew that he might have
had the law and have spoken of his like: and yet notwithstanding he says
that those too whom God has given no more but their natural wit, as he had
given it too all other men: considered not his ways. He says not that they
had done amiss, or erred, because they could do no better, or because they
had no light of doctrine (howbeit, that might have been said:) but here the
spirit of God meant to urge men, to the end they should know that their
condemnation was just, and that they could not allege it for a cloak, that
they had done amiss through ignorance, for want of one to govern them,
whereas they themselves were of a good and upright mind. For if men had a pure
and hearty desire to come unto God: surely he would not fail them on his side.
And undoubtedly this promise shall not disappoynt men: knock, and the gate
shall be opened unto you: seek and you shall find. Then if we see that men
do so raunge over the feeldes, and as it were run astray: let us mark that
they have not a pure and rightmeening mind to go unto God. True it is that
they may well have some show of devotion, as we see among the papists, where
many seem to be the best minded in the world, and to all likelyhoode utterly
ravished with devotion to Godward. But if a man look narrowly upon their
doings, he shall find that all is but hypocrisy, and that God does not give
them the bridle after that sort without just cause Ye see then that the thing
which we have to mark in this text, is that although the wretched Paynimes
dwell in darkness, and may be likened to blind men which grope and se not the
way, and have nothing but gross ignorance in them: yet notwithstanding they
can not be excused of maliciousness and stubbornness, and of wilful turning
away from good unto evil, even of set purpose: For it is written, that they
considered not the ways of God. These things are not wyted upon the brute
beasts, nor upon the stones which have no understanding: and therefore it
must be concluded, that they which are most rude and barbarouse, (even they I
say) have refuzed to go right, and that if they had had a good desire, they had
not been left destitute of Gods grace. Yet is it not therefore to be said that
we are able to do well, and that there is such an ability in us, that we be
able to seek God: we entreat not of that matter: and when the Papists make
such conclusions, they show themselves to be stark beasts. For when it is
said that men sin not by ignorance but through a certain wilfulness: the
Papists conclude that seeing it is so, it follows that we have sufficient
reason to govern our selves well, and that we be cleeresighted, and to be
short, that we have a freedom to do good or evil. But it is too great a
beastlynesse too reason after that manner. And why? For they be not things
unable to be matched together, that men should have their eyes as it were
piked out, so as they should not be able to see or discern any thing, and yet
therewithal also be altogether wicked. And therefore they are nevertheless
convicted, not too have considered Gods ways, nor to have been led in the
right way, for that they were carried away by pride. Ye see then in what wise we
ought to match the one with the other: namely that by reason of sin, we be al
of us bereft of reason and understanding: See how the heritage which we have of
our father Adam, is that our minds are combered and confounded, so as we can
not discern the thing that is for our welfare, but draw clean from it,
according as it is said that even our light is turned into darkness, until
God inlighten us by his holy spirit) and yet nevertheless that our
ignorance is not such, but that all the ways of God. Wherein we be
aduertized, that it is not enough for us too content us in part, and too serve
him by halues, but we must thoroughly and wholly frame our lives altogether to
his will. For, to give ear to all that he says, and to submit a man's self to
him without exception, come both to one end: and undoubtedly those two
commandments are inseparable. Like as God himself cannot be divided: so also
let us mark that his righteousness can not be divided. What manner of one is
the righteousness of God? He has comprehended it in his whole law. He says
not only that a man shall absteyne from whoredom, another has he only
forbidden theft, another has he only condemned murder: but he has joined ten
commandments together, and will have men to hold them all. Now if one man
obey God in chastity, and another in absteining from fleecing of his
neighbor, and a third in keeping himself from doing wrong or violence, or
from taking leave to hurt or harm other men: is not this a rending of Gods
righteousness in pieces? For (as I said) all the commandments are
inseparable, and there is in them a holy bond which ought to be kept unbroken.
And so let us mark well, that if we will be blissed of God, we must take good
heed, not to some one part of his ways, but to all. Thus ye see what Eliu
meant to note here. And hereby we see that every man ought to be diligent in
looking to himself. Therefore if we intend to examine our life well, and to
square out our works and our thoughts by it: when we have sound any outward or
actual sin in us, let us proceed further, and see whether we have not had
wicked affections: and thereupon let us learn to condemn our selves, and pray
him to clenze us from the evil which we feel so in our selves. Lo how we
ought to practice this sentence. And furthermore it is showed us also, that
when men have once begone to ouershoot themselves, they run astray further and
further, and become every day worsse than other, till they have renounced God,
and quite cast him up. We are not so malicious as to give our selves over to
al vices at the first day: we shall be hild in the fear of God for a while:
but if we take liberty to run at rouers, and God do happen to wink at our
sins and iniquities then Satan takes possession both of our souls and
bodies, and thenceforth carries us away in such wise as we become utterly
unrecoverable. Ye see then that after men have once left to frame themselves
wholly to Gods will, and to give themselves to sou^dnesse and simplicity: they
do so appayre, as there is no more consideration in them, but they grieve God,
not in some one sin only, but by all means and in all caces, so as they
utterly reject al his ways. And furthermore we see here yet better than
before, how rightful Gods justice is in chastizing us. And why? They that had
done amiss, rebelled still further against God: they ran away from him, and
had no will to be taught good: but gave themselves over unto evil, wittingly
and willingly: then is it not high time that God to make the cry of the poor
come unto him, and to make him hear the exclamation of the afflicted. Here
Eliu notes one kind of sin which God punishes in men. True it is that we
offend many ways. Howebeit for as much as men can not be brought too know
their faults, until they be more than convicted of them: here Eliu has set
down a kind of sin, which is most apparent and easiest to be seen. For
when outrages and extortions are committed, so as one man polleth another of
his goods, and they that are grieved have no redress at vsvp and we have no
remedy, but seem to be as sheep in the wolves throat. Go too: our Lord
has promised that the cry of all extorcions which men do, shall come up to
him. Seeing we have this buttresse, let us be contented, and tarry till he
show by effect, that he is near us and has a care of our welfare. Lo how
we ought to practice this sentence. It follows, when God gives rest, who
shall make trouble? and when he hides his face, who shall see it as well upon
a man, as upon a nation? Here Eliu meant to repress (in Jobs person) all the
quarrels that we make if God give rest, who can make trouble? And if he hide
his countenance who can see it? Now, this rest that God gives, is of diverse
sorts. For the faithful have the rest whereof the Scripture speaks: which
is, that they lean unto God, and put their trust in his goodness, and doubt
not but that he governs them. Heerevpon they may sleep at their ease
according as the Prophet speaking thereof, says that every man shall sleep
under his fig tree and under his vine when he is so in Gods custody, and
that we shall know it. And this peace If God hide his face, who can see him?
Herein we are warned, that it is not for us too search too far aforehande
what God does, but that we must content our selves with the knowledge of that
which he shows us. What is this face or countenance of God? It is not a
shape like unto a man's visage, which has nose, eyes, and mouth: but the face
of God is the record which he gives us when we know his will. God therefore
shows us his face, when he tells us why he does this thing or that, and
it is all one as if we saw him before our eyes. Contrariwise he hides his
face from us, when he afflicts us, when things seem strange too us, and
when we know no reason why he works after that sort. Therefore when God
holds us so in ignorance, it is a hiding of his face from us. And let us
mark well how it is said, that we may well strain our selves to see him: but
we shall never attain too it. Then is it a Devilish presumption when men do
so enter into disputation of Gods works, storming and chasing if God do things
otherwise than they think good, desiring to frame him to their will, even as
though they would look upon him whither he will or no when he hydeth
himself: or as though they would pull him down too them. And may they bring
that to pass? No: what is to be done then, that we may take profit of this
saying? Truly this lesson deserves to be laid forth more at large.
Howbeeit as at this time (to the intent the matter be not broken of:) let us
mark that whenever it pleases God to show himself unto us, it behooves us
too know him, and to consider his works, as he shows us them, and to be
attentive to mark the reason why he does so. And when he works after a
strange fashion that is unknown to us: let us reverence such secrets,
acknowledging nevertheless that he is always rightuous how so ever the world
go: and let us dwell continually in that belief, and hold us quiet, waiting
patiently til he show us more fully the things that are hidden from us as now:
assuring our selves that during this life our knowing must be but only in
part.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him too make us so too feel them, that all the time of
our life we may mourn before him, desiring him of forgiveness, and
acknowledging our selves exceedingly guilty, until that he of his free
goodness deliver us from the damnations wherein we are, and from the dangers
wherewith we are besieged. That so long as we be in this world, we
acknowledging our infirmity and weakness, may suffer him too govern us and
guide us too the right way of salvation, in such wise as we may never be shaken
down, but that what so ever temptations befall, us we may stand steadfast in
the calling of our God till he have taken us out of this world, to bring us
into his heavenly kingdom, where we shall enjoy the everlasting rest that he
has prepared for us. That it may please him, etc.

The.Cxxxiiij. Sermon, which is the seventh upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
29 And when he hides his face, who is he that shall see him? he is upon
nations, and upon men together.

30 In that an Ipocrite reigns, and there is a stumbling block to the people.

31 It belongs to God to say, I have forgiven, I will not destroy.

32 But that which I have not received, teach thou me: if I have done
wickedly, I will do so no more.


IT was partly declared yesterday, after what manner God hides his face from
us, that it be not seen: that is to wit, when me^ are troubled in this world,
and see not the reason and as well upon a whole nation as upon one man. Both
generally and particularly God ca^ so entangle things, as we shall not In so
much that the hypocrite reigns. True it is that this present sentence may be
laid forth diversely: but the sequel of the text shows well enough, that the
meening is, that when a wicked man, or when a naughtypacke reigns, and there
is a stumbling block or a snare cast among ^he people: for the words import
either of both: it is a trouble to us when we see the wicked reign, so as
there is nothing but tyranny, that the wicked man reygneth: let us mark that
although it be a sore temptation, to see such reygne as are naughtypackes,
despizers of God, and given to all evil, and to see that might overcomes
right, so as a man can not tell whither to go for refuge: surely it is a great
and hard cross to overcome: nevertheless the holy Ghost intended to set it
before us, to the intent that we should be armed against it. So the^, has
unrighteousness gotten full scope? Are the wicked grown so Iustie as to
confound all things, and to handle matters with such corruption, as there may
be no more remedy? The holy ghost aduertizeth us, that it is Gods will to hide
his face after that manner, to the intent to try our obedience. Therefore let us
rarie till he inlighten us, and then shall we know how that he has not sent
these troubles among us without cause. Thus ye see in effect after what manner
we ought to put this sentence in ure. Now Eliu adds that it belongs to god
to say, I have forgiven, I will no more destroy. As if he should say, that god
holds the raines in his hand to guide men at his pleasure, and if it please
him to punish our sins, we have nothing to reply why he should not condemn
us: and if he bear with us, yea or list to forgive us altogether, who shall
resist him, who shall let him to show us favor? True it is that this is
strange too man's understanding at the first sight. For seeing that God in this
streyne. Now he adds, that he will no more destroy when he has so pardoned.
And herein we have one good lesson more: which is that when God spares
sinners, he is reconciled unto them, and fully at one with them. True it is
that sometimes God punishes not the wicked, and although their sins be told
the^ and brought to their remembrance, it will seem that they are escaped his
hand for a time. But then is not this saying performed, that God will not
destroy. And why? forthere he forgiueth not, but nourishes the wicked as men
fat oxen and True it is that they desired that too: but first of all, they
desired God to forgive them their sins and to be no more angry with them.
And why spoke they so? For they saw well from whence afflictions come: how
that they be the fruits and records of Gods anger: and therefore they went
always to the root of the mischief. Even so must we do. And that is the
thing whereof we be warned in this place where it is said, that God will not
punish after he has forgiven. True it is that it follows not that God
forgiueth us, because he makes no countenance If I have not perceived, teach
thou it me: If I have done amiss, I will do so no more. These things are
added here as it were in skorne. For Eliu brings in God speaking unto Job,
and offering himself to be reproved and amended, if he have done amiss.
True it is that for as much as these words are somewhat cut off, men have
taken them in another sense: howbeit, the natural exposition is this: We have
seen heretofore that Eliu has exalted God in such liberty and soueraintie,
as all mortal men must needs this sort: it is to show men that they are
very devilish in presuming after that manner to set up their bristles against
God, and to murmr when he works not to their lyking. So much the more
therefore ought we to wey well the words that are contained here. And as often
as we be tickled with any intents to be to inquisitiue of Gods doings, or
too bring him under coram: let us consider what we do, and into what maze we
enter. For it is all one as if we would rob God of his Majesty, and abace him
in this world and make him subject to that we think good* Alas, be short, it
is all one as if he said, we be wiser than God, we see things that he saw not,
and therefore we must provide for them. And after what manner? By putting away
the ordinance of Jesus Christ. Behold, our Lord Jesus Christ says drink ye
all of this cup. He says expressly drink ye all: And behold, the Pope
comes and cutteth off that word, saying: it is true that so was the
ordinance of Jesus Christ. But we have not don it without good reason, it is to
provide for inconveniences: I have foreseen it to be so. And what shall we say
of Gods son: who is the

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us feel them better than we have done, so
as we may be sorry for them and ask him forgiveness, and that therwithall we
may know that there is no other help for us, but to put our selves to his
mercy, that he may spare us: not for some little time only, but so as we may
be always vphild by his power, and so assured of his mercy, as we may not
doubt but that he will guide us, even unto the end, until he have delivered
us from all the adversities and miseries whereunto we be now subject. That it
may please him to grant this grace not only to us, etc.

The.Cxxxv. Sermon, which is the eight upon the.xxxiiij. Chapter.
33 Will God perform the thing by thee? For thou have misliked it: but will thou chooze and not I? what know thou? speak.

34 Ye men of understanding speak you, and let wise men hear me.

35 Job has not spoken in vvisdome, neither has his words bin in
understanding.

36 I desire that Job should be tried to the utter most, to the end we
might see the answers for men of wickedness.

37 He will multiply his sins by iniquity, he vaunteth himself against
us, and multiplieth his words against God.


WE have seen heretofore how God will he perform the thing by thee? Then
like as heretofore, he had (as it were) dalyed, to the end that men might
know the better, how fond their ouerweening is: so also on the contrary part,
he shows that it is no dalying with so great a Lord as God is. For when we
have replied never so much, what are we? Is it meet that he should be subject
to our lusts? Should he ask counsel at our hands to know what he should
do? Were not that an overthrowing of the whole order of nature? So will he
perform the thing by thee? For although men over labor themselves, yet shall
they not win so much, that God should yield unto them, and be subject to
their pleasure: And therefore spite of their teeth they must pass the way
that thou have mislyked, thou shall chooze and not I. Here again in this
streyne God is brought in, complaining of men's pride for pleading so against
him. For surely they that cannot content themselves with Gods will, do mislyke
his doings, and by that means pretend to have choyze and election, as though
it were free for them too say, this is not well done, God must leave to do so.
True it is that we would abhor such blasphemies: and if it should be
demanded whether any of us would take upon him to let God of the executing of
his determinations: every of us would answer, God forbid that ever I should
intend to then shall thou choose and not I. And because men cannot find in
their hearts to condemn themselves, except they be compelled: here God adds
for a conclusion, what know thou? speak it. As who should say, he
reproves us for our ignorance. Our tongue will be as nimble as may be, and
it is hasty to speak a thing before we have conceived it: but God tells us
that if we had but one drop of reason, we should be as it were dumme. And
why? For if a man speak he wot not what: Is it not a sure record of his
folly? And yet notwithstanding, we will be talking, insomuch that our Lord
needs but to cross us with somewhat that mis^^keth us* and it whetteth us
too murmr against him. what know thou? speak it. As if he should say, I
give you leave to speak, sobeit that you show by your doings that you be
wise men, and men of understanding: But you are stark fools, and there is
nothing in you but ignorance: And must you then take upon you such liberty to
speak, and have not what to say? Now if we can make our profit of this
streyne, it conteyneth a good lesson. For first we see, what is the rule of
our life, namely too yield God his due authority, that he may dispoze of us,
that is to say, that he may do all things, and yet not by our advice. Then it
is not for us, to set God a law and too point him out his lesson: but we must
agree unto all that he does. Mark that for one point. True it is that we may
well demand the things which we think to be for his glory, and for the
welfare of his church, or for our own private benefit. For he shows such
familiarity toward us, as to say unto us, discharge your hearts, and your
cares. According also as Saint Paul says, that we must make him privy to
our desires. Therefore when we be in any unquietness, let us refer our
selves unto God, and pray him to do the thing that we think good, howbeeit,
let us rule our selves always by his word: notwithstanding if it please him
not to grant our desires, yet must we use thanksgiving as Saint Paul
says in the same place, and our desires must not be headie, neither must we
constrayne God to do that which we require, but contrariwise although he say
us nay, and mind therein to excercize our patience, let us always bliss and
glorify his name, acknowledging that he does all things with inestimable
justice, uprightness, and wisdom, and that we our selves know not what is
good, but are poor blind wretches, and therefore he must be feign to see
for us. Thus then ye see that the first point which we have to mark here,
and to put in ure this streyne, is that God must not do things at our
appointment. Howbeeit this stretches yet further, that is too wit, if we
find any thing in the Scripture which is strange to our understanding: let
us assure our selves, that we must not lean so too our own reason, that God
should do what we think ought to be done. How then? Let his will reign and
let men stoop unto it: For he ought not to ask counsel of us. Then behooves
it both the Angels of heaven, and men upon earth, to humble themselves, and
God only too bear the sway: Yea even with such freedom, as it be confessed
that it belongs to him to do whatsoever he does. And on the other side we be
warned, that we cannot do a worse thing, than to repine and grudge at God, when
things fall not out as we would wish them* And why? For it is a mislyking of
the only rule of righteousness. And what a thing is that? If a man fall to
evil and do amiss through frailty, he is not therefore to be excused: but
when he comes to such a fullness of sin, as he is not contented to offend
God, and too break his law, and to abolishe all order, but also would quench
Gods righteousness, and have the light turned intoo darkness, so as there
might be no more discerning between good and evil: what an
oueroutrageousnesse is that? And yet notwithstanding, as often as men repyne at
God, and cannot patiently bear his doings and glorify him: therein they
mislyke of him, as though they would usurp authority over him to judge him,
and not only that, but also condemn his righteousness, which is too
outrageous and beastly a dealing. Therefore when we be tempted too grudging
and impacience, let this text come too our remembrance, and let us say, thou
you shall have the choice and I shall meddle no more. It is all one as if we
would bereeue God of his being, and abace him in such wise, as we might be
masters over him. But very what know thou? speak it. For (as I have
touched already,) if we mean to twit a man what know thou? And it is
certain that in this place our Lord meant to condemn all man's wit, like as in
other places of the holy Scripture where it is said that God knows the
thoughts of men how they be but vain, and that he sercheth all their secrets,
and ouertaketh the wily in their wiliness, and that men may well bear
themselves in hand that they be sharpwitted and subtle: and yet all is but
smoke and vanishes away straight. So then in this text our Lord says, go to,
if you have any wisdom show it, but if you have no skill, why then do you
speak? Here we have a general doctrine* which is, that we must not claim
any thing of our own wit to trust unto it. Therefore as often as our wit runs
at rouers, so as we presume too talk and judge of matters reshly: let us
assure our selves that the holy ghost sets himself against it as our
adversary party, and shows that there is nothing but foolish rashness in
us. And why? For we have no skill. True it is that God has given us reason
and understanding: but that is but only to do us to wit, that the light of God
shyneth in our darkness, of purpose to make us inexcusable, insomuch that we
have no knowledge, except God speak unto us, and inlighten us by his word:
and that is the way whereby we may be men of understanding, according as it
is said in the Psalm, that our wisdom is to profit under him. And therefore
let us mark that we must utterly distrust all our own reason, and know that
till our Lord have enlightened us by his word, we are utterly void of all
discretion, and there is neither modesty nor honesty in us. Lo what we have
to bear in mind. Furthermore when we speak let us be sure aforhande that our
Lord has taught us, and that we have the thing of him which we utter, and
not imagined it of our own brain. If all this were well practiced, we should
see the world in another order than it is: For there are two things which
displace all right. The one is, when we will be wise in our own conceyts* and
the other is, when we give bridle to our affections and lusts. But if we
knew well the thing which is spoken here: that is to wit, that we have no
skill at al, and that our speaking is but too bewray* our own folly: I say if
we were thoroughly persuaded of that: no doubt but God should be exalted, and
all men would hold themselves to his word, so as there should be one common
accord, and there would not be so much disputing of this and that. And for
proof hereof, why do the Papists debate so much upon all the articles that are
in controversy between them and us? It is not only because they cannot find
in their hearts to be subject unto God: but also because they be so saucy to
step forth with their Lordly conclusions, too determine and bind men's
consciences to their resolutions. Then if Amen whenever the pure truth of
God were laid before us But there is a second mischeef, which is, that our
affections are too unruly, and we give them leave to run at rouers. By reason
whereof if god afflict us, or if things fall not out to our looking, we fall to
stormiug, and every man let men of heart speak, that is so say let men of
understanding speak, and let wise men harken. Here at the first sight Eliu
seems to speak things contrary: for to speak and to harken agree not
together. Yet notwithstanding it is not without cause that he wills wise men
to speak, and men of understanding to harken. For a man shall never speak
well, except he be willing to hear: neither shall he ever be fit to teach,
unless he be willing also to receive good doctrine. We see then that Eliu
matcheth two things together, which ought never to be separated asunder? And
that is the thing which I have spoken before, namely that we may well speak,
howbeit when we have learned before. I have believed (says the Psalm) and
therefore have I spoken. Therefore it behooves us to keep that lesson, for
how can we believe, unless we have given ^are and suffered our selves to be
taught? For we must be teachable when good things are set before us, according
also as it is said that the wise man shall become wyser by hearing. Ye see
here a saying of Solomon, which shows full well, that to speak is no let
but a man should harken: according also as to harken is no let but that a man
may speak. For wherefore is our Lord a master, but to the intent that we
should hear him, and every of us teach his neighbors, and thereby make the
thing auaylable which we have received? If God have given me any gift of
grace, I am bound to utter it to my neighbors when I see them do amiss. So
then to speak and to hearken are two things, that not only agree very well,
but also (which is more) are inseparable: at leastwise if all things be well
disposed and considered in good order. True it is that speaking is here set
foremost. nevertheless when as Eliu says wizemen, he therein presupposes
that they which spoke had first learned before, and knew what to say. And
again whereas in the second place he sets down that they should harken:
it is to do us to wit, that our speaking must be after such a manner, as we
must nevertheless give ear when another man has to speak, to whom God has
revealed more than to us: according also as Saint Paul sets it down for
an order in prophesying. Let him that is a Prophet (says he) speak, and let
but two or three do it at once, for avoiding of confusion. Now then in that he
calls them Prophets, he shows that it behooves them to have what too say,
and none must thrust himself forth unless he be called: like as he says in
the.xij. Chapter of the first to the Corinthians, that we have received the
things at our Lords hand, which we communicate to our neighbors. Then must
not any man take upon him an office in the church, except he be called and
have wherewith to furnishe the room. For it is a record that God will be
served by us, when he deals his gracious gifts to us by his holy spirit. S.
Paul then declares and presupposes, that such as speak, are furnished
aforehande. Nevertheless he adds, that when God has reveled more to another
man, the first must hold his peace and give room to the spirit of God. And
thus ye see why it is said here, that although wise men speak, and that God
allows them, and also let wise men speak and let men of understanding hear.
Whereas none but fools, witless folk, and mad men, have liberty to speak,
and bind other men to the stake, so as they have all authority yielded too
them, yet notwithstanding they have no ears to hear, nor to receive
correction. If a man would tell them their faults, they be such as cannot
abide any bewraying. Nevertheless, if we go against the thing that God has
stablished, our stryuing to overthrow it shall be but in vain. It is too
hard a wall for us: And therefore let such as rushe against it, assure
their selves that it shall be to their ruin and destruction. Lo what we have
too bear in mind. And therefore since we know how things are confounded
nowadayes: let us learn too return thither as God calls us: which is,
that his doctrine should be heard and take place amongs us, so as all of us
should be diligent to receyne it, and he which knows he has done amiss,
should seek to amend it: that by that means we might all do honor to him
that ought too have souereyntie over us, and consider that if Job were
condemned for gyuing himself the bridle too much in that he mortified not
his affections, nor hilde them sufficiently in awe: Alas what shall become of
us? Then let us think upon it, and be ashamed to see the wretchedness that
has reigned too much amongst us. For I pray you, to what purpose is it for us
too speak of the reformation of the Gospel, when in the mean season we
strive after this sort against God? whereas wickedness has his full scope
nowadayes: so far of are men from repressing it, that it is rather mainteyned
with tooth and nail: insomuch that if a man take upon him to speak, and to
show them their faults: then the lamb does always trouble the water.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us to repent them, that being governed by
his holy spirit, we may fight mansully against all the temptations and
afflictions of the world, and while that it shall please him to keep us
here, we may seek to be altogether subject to his holy commandments.
And so let us say, Almighty God our heavenly father, we acknowledge and
confess according to the truth, that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes
to heaven, to present our selves before thee, nor to presume so far as that
our prayers, etc.

The.cxxxvj. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxxv. Chapter.
ELiu proceeds saying:

2 Did thou think this aright, when thou saydest my righteousness is
above God?

3 For thou have said, what shall it profit me, or what shall it avail me,
not to have sinned?

4 I will answer thee and thy friends likewise.

5 Look up to the heavens and behold them, look up to the air that is above
thee.

6 If thou sinnest: what do thou against him? And if thy sins be
multiplied? what hurtest thou him?

7 If thou be rightuous: what give thou him? Or what shall he receive at
thy hand?


ELiu continues here still to blame Job sor blaspheming the ryghtuousnesse of
God: and he groundeth it upon this point, that Job had meant that his own
rightiousnesse surmounted God. Not that he uttered those words, or pretended
any thing: but and there and could not see three foot before him without
dazeling of his eyes: his wits were after a sort berest him. That was the
cause why he could not comfort himself with the hope of the rest that was
promised him. For he had assuaged all his anguishe, if he had remitted himself
unto God to say, even so Lord, yet have I always hoped that thou will make
me feel, that such as shall have suffered their afflictions patiently, shall
be happy in the end. Lord thou give me knowledge, that such as wait upon
thee shall never be disappoynted of their hope. For thou will off, and let
the same serve to comfort us, so as we may say, yet will God have pity upon
us in the end. And therefore let us pass on still, and boldly go thorough with
our course. Lo what we have too mark in this streyne. And that the sense is
such, it appears by that which Eliu gathers of it. For he lays it forth
saying: thou have said what shall it boot me not to have sinned, and what
shall it profit me? The thing then wherein Eliu vpbraydeth Job that he
would make himself more rightuous than God, is that he had thought it to be
an unprofitable thing I will answer thee and thy companions. In saying so he
shows that when men strive in that manner against God, they shall gain nothing
by it, though they had never so great a band and train. For God is able enough
to beat them back with one word to their confusion. Job had no companions,
but spoke alone in the mayntenaunce of his quarrel: But Eliuze intent is to say,
Although thou had a great army with thee, and that you had conspyred
toogether too accuze and blaspheme God all with one mouth: yet
notwithstanding, mine answer shall be sufficient for you all. Here then we
see how strong Gods truth is, and that it is in vain too fight against it,
and that although we be fenced and have many partakers, yet must God always
have the upper hand, so as his righteousness, shall continue vnappayred.
When we have barked our fill against it, we shall not be able to byte it, as
shall be said anon. Mark (I say) what we have to remember in this strain.
And therefore first of all let us learn, not to be lavish of our tongs when
God afflicts us, and when things go not after our mind. Let us not be
impacient therefore in our afflictions, I will answer thee and thy companions,
is not written alonely for the person of Eliu: but the holy Ghost gives us
that promis, to the intent we should not stick to enter into battle, and to
stand stoutly to it to the uttermost, since we know our case is good, and
that God fights for us because we mainteyne his quarrel. Therefore, when we
have such a certeintie, let us fight boldly against our enemies, for they
must needs be confounded in the end. Thus ye see what we have to bear in
mind, and how we may put this Behold the Skies (says he) look up too the
greatest heavens: they are higher than thou, and thou cannest never reach too
them. This seems to be a very raw answer: For had he none other reason
whereby too show the ryghtuousnesse of God? Yes: But if this saying be
applied as it ought to be: it is enough to stop the mouths of all such as
blaspheme God. For by beholding of the heavens, he leads us to another
consideration: which is, that our doing well profits not our God, and that
our doing evil, cannot hurt him: For what shall he be the worse for it?
Seeing it is so, he is not to be measured according unto men: For he is not
reuengefull, as who would say he is angry when a man does him wrong, or that
he is led by affection, like a man that looks to be pleased, and thinks
himself beholding to another man for doing him any service. God is none such.
So then we must not measure him by our own meateyearde, nor imagine any
fleshlinesse in him. For the very skies that are under his feet, do show
well that he is not like us, nor meddled here with us to have any part at all
of our nature. Therefore we see that this reason (where it is said, Behold
the Skies and look up above thy head) is sufficient too beat down all those
that dare lift up themselves against God. But now it is needful to lay out
that which follows by peecemele, too the end it may be the better
understood. When Eliu says, if thou do good: what profit does God receive
by it? He shows thereby, that God is not bound unto us. Mark that for the
first point. The second is, that he is not affectioned, as men are: when any
pleasure is done them, they are moved with it, because they be passible: but
God is not so: we can another show him friendship nor favor. And so he is not
like unto us. And as touching the first point, namely that God is by no means
bound unto us, do what we can. It is a very true thing. Notwithstanding we see
how men grow proud, yea even without cause or occasion, and would make God
believe that he is beholding to them although they ca^ bring him nothing. And
this draws after it a mischeeuouse tail of superstition. Why do the Papists
labor so much at this day for these ceremonies and gewgawes? It is because they
think that God receives some profit by the^, when they make many gewgawes,
and have babbled and trotted from place to place. They think they have made a
fair work when their churchstuffe is well decked, and when they have well
trimmed and washed their puppets, as if a man had made a goodly banquette and
decked up a house, and bestrawed it with russhes and other things. The Papists
(I say) surmyze that God delyghteth in these nyce toys, and that he takes
pleasure in them. But we must not imagine that we can bring any thing unto
God. And that is the cause why it is said in the sixtenth Psalm. Lord, my
goods cannot come at thee. How then? But I honor thy saints that are on
earth. Forasmuch as God can receive no benefit by us, he commends our
neighbors unto us: and when we do good to such as are in necessity, living
freendly and uprightly among men, and indeuering to imploye our selves
faithfully where we be able to help and succor: God accepts such things as
sacrifices. So then let us remember this doctrine, where it is said that we
cannot bring any thing unto God. For it serves to abate all pride in us, to
the intent we might not think that God is any thing beholden to us, nor be led
unto foolish superstitions, to gad up and down and to do many things of no
valewe, That do we never so much evil, we can not burt our God. Therefore let
us assure ourselves, that God will not punish us for our sins, by reason of
any spyght he bears unto us, nor for that he desires to be revenged, as a
man does when he is offended. For when a man has any wrong done him, so as
he is harmed in his own person, or hindered in his goods, he will seek to be
revenged. God (I say) is not moved with such considerations. Wherefore then
does he threaten us? Because he will not have us perish: he shows the
fatherly regard which he has of our welfare, and in the mean while if he
punish us indeed, therein he shows his justice. For in this case, there is
no going too law with him as if he had some private quarrel to us: but he
punishes us as a just judge: according as his office and nature do afford.
Then seeing that our God proceeds after that manner: what have we to do, but
to consider his fatherly love when he chastyzeth us? For by that mean he
draws us back from the way of damnation wherein we are. Therefore when we
feel his hand, how rough soever it be, let us always consider that he
shows himself rightuouse. What is to be done then, but only to trust in
him, and to comfort our selves by it, and therewithal to desire him to have
pity upon us, that although we have offended him, yet he may not forbear to
receive us to mercy? Heerewithall let us be fully persuaded and resolved, that
God will not bear such a stomach toward us, as a proud and stately man
will do. But forasmuch as he is the fountain of all goodness and mercy: if
we come unto him, he will make us feel how merciful he is minded to be
toward us. And although he chastise us now and then, yea eue^ more roughly
than we would: yet will he make us to perceive that he does it for our welfare,
to the end we should not perish, and that his brydling of us so short, is to
humble us and to make us bow under his mighty hand and chasticements.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them better than we have done,
too the end we may finishe our race with the greater patience through out
the miseries and calamities of this world,

The Cxxxvij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxxv. Chapter.
8 Thy wickedness touches a man like thy self, and thy righteousness the
Son of man.

9 By reason of the multitude of oppressors, men cry out (or hovvle) because of
the mightiness of masters.

10 And no man says, where is God that has fashioned me, which gives us
songs in the night?

11 Which teaches us more than the beasts, and instructs us more than the
birds of the air.


FOr a conclusion of that which was declared yesterday, we have to consider
what Eliu utters here in few words: which is, that our misdeedes do touch
men, and not God, and likewise our righteousness, to the end we should not
imagine that God is choleric to revenge himself when we have offended, or that
on the contrary part he is bound unto us, as if our service did him any good.
The^ poor folk know not what to do, their houses are burned, and their goods
are utterly spoiled. By means whereof the people are in such anguishe, as it
had been better for them too have had their throtes cut at the first, than too
pine after that sort as they do. But yet for all that, they look not unto
God. If a man go into strange Countries, he shall hear many complaints, and
he shall not need too go very far for the matter: for wheresoever be taxes
and impositions, or wheresoever men of war pass like floudes of water, there
is no man but he shall For they say not, where is God that made me? which
gives songs in the night, which instructs us more than the beasts, and
teaches us more tha^ the fowls of the ^yr^* This (as I touched even now)
serves to answer that it might be alleged, that wretched men do call upon
God when they are afflicted. Yea says Eliu, but it is but faynedly, and
therefore it is in vain. For inasmuche as the prayers which the most part of
the world makes are but bypocrisie: therefore God hears them not. Thus the
reason that Eliu sets down, is that they go not unto God, as to their
maker that has fashioned them, no^ as to him that comfort men, nor as too
him that gives the^ so many benefits as they ought to magnify his mercy
what misery soever they endure. Then if we acknowledge not God to be such a
one as he shows himself toward us, nor esteem the gracious gifts which we
have received at his hand: I say if we come not to him thus minded: there is
nothing but seyning and falsehood in us, and therefore we must not marvel
though he shette the gate against us, and make no countenance to hear our
requests. Behold a text right worthy to be marked. For ye shall see in these
days that the Papists make processions when God lays his hand upon them. If
there be any plague, or famine, or other adversity: true it is that they
turn unto God, and so do the Paynims as well as they. But what? Do they call
upon him with a true and rightmeening heart? Alas they are far wide of it: all
that they do, is but ceremonies. And for proof hereof, let us mark well that
men cannot seek God rightlye, except they know him to be such a one as they
should feel him by experience. First of al when we call upon God, we must
remember that he is our maker, and that we are in his hand. But now let us
examine those which make countenance of praying. If a man search their heart:
shall he find that they have skill to say, seeing that my God has fashioned
me, I am in his hand, and it belongs too him too rule me in my life, and
too provide for all my necessities: I hold all of him, and therefore it
behooves me to suffer my self to be governed by his hand and according to
his pleasure? Shall a man find one among a hundred that is thus minded, and
that speaks with a true heart, to yield honor too God, as too his maker?
They will confess it well enough with their mouth: ye^ (say they) we were
made by him, and he has given us life. But in the mean while for all their
confessing* yet are they not fully resolved of it: it is clean contrary with
them. So then there are no prayers that are worthy to bear that name, when
men are so brutisheas they acknowledge not God for such a one as he shows
himself toward them. Howbeeit the matter consists not only in
acknowledging God to be our maker: but we must also therewithal esteem the
gracious gifts which he is ready to give us, according as it is said
expressly in this text that be gives songs in the night. Some men expound
this saying after this sort: namely that the birds do cheer us with their
singing, and that the same ought too be imputed too Gods goodness, and that
men show their unthankfulness in not acknowledging it* Other some take it
that God does comfort us, by making the stars to shine, and there by gives
us occasion to set forth his goodness. For although the Sun be down, and
darkness ouerspreade us: yet does God lighten us by them, as by candels, as
who should say, that his majesty is not quenched, nor altogether hidden from
us. But such expositions are to much streyned. Therefore we must take it
simply, that God gives Songs even in the time when men are asleep. For the
night seems as it were to make al things dead. When the sun is down and
all things are whist and still: there seems to be as it is God that teaches
us more than the beasts, and which gives us more understanding than too the
fowls of the air. Here he makes a comparison between men and beasts. For
if heaven and earth could speak, it is certain that they should needs
praise God though they have no understanding, nor are advanced to that
dignity which we are. And why? It is a great honor that God has done them,
in that they are the work of his hands, and in that they are his creatures.
Now if God have inhonored heaven and earth, and all the senseless creatures,
in that he has voutsafed to create them: and if he have inhonored the beasts,
though he have made the^ void of reason: what has he done to man, to whom he
has given such understanding? That is the cause why Eliu does here compare us
with the beasts. For whereof was it long that god made not us Asses or horses?
For the noblest and excellentest man upon the earth can not say, I made my
self, or it was my will to be made such a one. For God could well have made
him a dog, or a swyne when he had made him a man. Then must we not seek the
ground in our selves why God made us reasonable creatures, but we must
commend his goodness toward us, specially seeing he has so greatly
honored us, as not only too make us of the number of his creatures, but also
to advance us above the brute beasts, by giving us wit and reason which he
has Gods election are out of their wits, specially seeing it behooved them to
return to this matter which is showed us here: namely that it was known, even
unto the very Paynims: for it appears that even among the Painims some have
used this manner of praising God. Therefore such fantastical heads, must be
set to schole to the Infidels: for they are not worthy too have their
maliciousness (which is matched with such pride against god) reproved by the
holy scripture. And further, if the consideration of the benefits which God
has bestowed generally upon al

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them better than we have done:
and therewithal to open our eyes, that we may not be so dulheaded as too
forget or despyze his benefits: but may magnify them according to their
worthiness, and think upon them in such wise, as we may be provoked by them
to serve and honor him, and to walk advisedly according to his good will, and
take such example of the chasticementes that he sends to our neighbors,
as the same may serve us for corrections, and that if it shall please him to
chastise us in our own persons, and to make us feel the strokes of his hand
as we have need: he will turn all too the furtherance of our salvation, so
that in passing through all the troubles of this world, he may strengthen us
continually with his power, until he receive us into the everlasting rest,
which he has prepared for us in his kingdom. That it may please him to
grant this grace not only to us, etc.

The Cxxxviij. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxxv. Chapter.
12 There they shall cry, and God will not hear them, because of the pride
of the wicked.

13 Surely it is but vanity: God hears it not, another does the Almighty
regard it.

14 Thou have said he sees thee not, there is judgment before him: vvayt
for it.

15 But now his visiting is not in anger ( or it is nothing to his visiting
in his wrath) another punishes he greatly in anger.

16 But Job has opened his mouth in vain, and multiplied words without
understanding.


FOr as much as the first sentence which we have now rehearsed, ought to be
joined to the matter that I handeled yesterday, it that there they shall cry:
as if he should say, very well, it is true that men shall all this is but
vanity, God hears not, another does the Almighty regard. This objection is
made in the person of the unbelievers: For although it be told them that God
does justly leave men weltring in their own wretchedness, because they come
not to him with faith and obedience: yet notwithstanding they cannot conceive
the reason, but imagine foolishly that God hereth not, and that he seems to
let the world go at havoc, and that things are ruled here beneth by Fortune.
Ye see then that the faithless do with a brutish and suddeine conceit, catch
hold of the thing that is showed to their eyes, without further discerning: as
though we were loath to consider any further reason, than that which comes
next to hand, and would say, O, I see that yonder man has done such a thing.
Yea, but thou must seek further, and understand the reason of it. No marie, I
will not be inquisitiue. Is not this a wilful bereuing of our selves of wit
and reason? Is it not a shetting of our eyes against the light? Even as much do
the unbelievers. They see that God hears not those that cry: and thereupon
they fall to storming, yea and to accusing of God. And therefore no marvel
though God make not his succor and favor to be felt of such as do nothing
but chafe in their adversities, and yield him not any obedience, ne seek unto
him with such mind as they ought to do. So then, god has just cause to let me^
perish after that manner: And why? Because he calls the^ to him, and they come
not to him the way that they ought to do. If a man tell the faithless these
things: they shet their eyes and think not upon them. Is it not as much then as
if they said there were no providence of God at al, and that he had no regard
of us? Is it not an utter burying of it? And yet nevertheless, that is the
thing whereto our fleshely reason carries us, if we be not restreined with the
bridle of lowlynesse and modesty, too deem of Gods works and judgments
according as his word shows us. This then is rehearsed now by Eliu in the
person of the unbelievers, although thou say, God sees not: there is
judgment before him, look thou for it. Here Eliu remedieth the said
frowardness which has bin discovered, to the end we should bethink us of the
evil that is in us, and give it over. True it is that these words are as it
were crased by reason of their shortness. And because it is set down thus,
Behold thou say, or else albeit that thou say, he shall not see it. This
saying may be taken also in the person of Job: as though Eliu vpbrayded him
too have thought thus: Thou shall not see God, another shall thou know what he
is. But when all is well considered, the sentence must be knitte together, and
therewithal it must also be distinguished thus: Although thou say then, he
shall not see it. Hereby Eliu signifies that men advance themselves too
much, and that they ought to consider their rudeness and small capacity. For
it is not in them to see God, that is to say, to search him to the bottom. True
it is there is judgment before his face: or judge thou: For the saying may be
set down two ways. If we take, Judge thou: It is an exhortation to humility
and repentance, as if Eliu should say, wretched man I see thou liftest up thy
self against god, and what makes thee to do so, but because thou iudgest not
thy self? Therefore enter intoo thy self, and look upon thine own
wretchedness, and then will all thy pride be plucked down. Thus ye see the
remedy that is given us here by the holy Ghost, to reprove us when we run
astray, and have through our unbelief conceived any wicked and hasty
imaginations against God. For if we will be brought into the right way, we
must go down into our own selves, and examine our own ignorance and
sinfulness, and then shall we be ashamed, and forget the wandering conceytes
wherewith we were carried too and fro* Lo what sense and doctrine we ought to
gather of this saying, if we take it to be set down, judge thou. But the
very true meening of this Text is, that there is judgment before God. And
therefore Eliu concludes, that men should look for it. Here is a counterviewe
between the face of God, and our sight: as if Eliu should say, that God
ceasseth not to be rightuous although it appear not unto us. Then if we will
know that God governs the world, and orders all things uprightly: we
must not measure him by the things that we perceive. And why? For Gods
judgment it to high for us, and we can not reach unto it at the first
brayde. Therefore let us mark well that God sees what is good and rightful,
whereas we are most commonly blind. What is to be done then? Nothing else, but
even tarry, according as the faithful man must be fed with hope that he may
yield himself peaceable and obedient unto God: and we know that it behooves
us to hope when things are not visible to us. Now have we the natural sense
of this text: It remains that we apply the same to our own instruction.
Although thou say thou shalt not see it. This shows us, that we must not
have our tongue at liberty to shoot forth whatsoever we think concerning God.
But we must bridle our tongs, and hold our thoughts as prisoners, assuring our
selves that God intends to keep us in humility by concealing the reason of
all his works from us. Therefore let those that will not be condemned by the
spirit of God, take heed that they rushe not out too far. Mark that for
one poyet. And why? It ought to be well considered, that we be not able to
see God: howbeit (as I have said already) true it is that God grants us the
grace and privilege to show him self unto us, howbeit that is but so far
forth as he knows too be expedient for us. God being invisible of him
self shows him self in a glass so far as is convenient for us, that is
to wit, in his word, and in his works, but yet must we not be to inquisitiue
of him. And this is also the cause why he sends us always to the mean,
which he has hilde, to allure us to know of him. For he knows our
overboldness, and also the fickleness of our wit, and that we be so
unconstant as it is pity to see. Truly they are two great vices, when men are
so ouerhardie, and also have so disordered lusts. On the otherside, there is
ignorance or rather beastliness, and moreover also frowardness. And therefore
we have need to be restrained by the mean that God has given us, which is,
too be contented with the things that are contained in the holy scripture:
that there is a judgment before his face, and that we must wait for it. I
have touched already, that we must not esteem Gods judgments that there is
judgment before the face of God. Mark I say how it behooves us to correct the
overboldness that yea and until he know it too be convenient. For it is
not for us to bind him to the stake, and to say, this thing must be done after
this manner, and that thing after that. But we must learn to repose ourselves
in God, and then shall all pride be beaten down, so as we shall think all
Gods doings too be good, ryghtfull, and just, although they seem strange to
us at the first sight. Thus ye see what we have to mark in this text. Now
Eliu adds, that Gods present visiting or punishing is not in his anger: and
that he knows not in multitude greatly. Truly this For he will not examine
things to the uttermost. He searches not things too deep: he does but only
pass over them, and as it were with a glaunce (as men term it.) Hereby Eliu
meant to show, that when we be afflicted to the vttermoste, so as God seems to
thunder in such wise upon cause why we consider not the greatness of our
sins, is our hypocrisy which hinders us, and keeps our eyes blindfolded.
But if a man would examine himself thoroughly: he should find him self a
hundred thousand times confounded, before he came half too his ways end.
For God sees much more clearly than we do. When we have spyed one fault,
God will spy out a hundred thousand, yea even of millions: what shall the
heavenly Judge do? So then let us mark that God forbeareth us of his own
mercy, to the end he would not try in multitude greatly [or in great number]
to signify that it were impossible that any creature should stand out, if
God of his goodness did not spare them, and continually abate the rigor of
the punishments which we have deserved by our sins. And heerevpon (as I
have said already) we must needs think that there is a far other
judgment, than can be perceived in this world, howbeeit we know it not as
yet, and God bears with

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to touch us so to the quick, as we may learn to
return better unto him with true repentance, so bethinking us of our life
paste, as we may amend it hereafter, and henceforth learn to give our
selves wholly too his service, in following his holy commandments as they
are showed in his law, whereby we ought to rule our whole life. And so let
us say, Almighty God our heavenly father, we acknowledge and confess, etc.

The.Cxxxix. Sermon which is the first upon the.xxxvj. Chapter.
ELiu spoke again and said,

2 Hear me and I will argue with thee, for yet have I words to speak of
God.

3 I will extend my knowledge a far off, and prove him to be rightuous
which made me.

4 My words shall be void of untruth, and the perfect of knowledge shall be
with thee.

5 God being mighty, yea being mighty in strength of mind, enuieth not, [or
rejects not.]

6 He quickneth not the wicked, but gives judgment to the afflicted.

7 He will not turn away his eyes from the rightuous.


THey that had heeeretofore vphild that God leaves no sin unpunished in this
world, are beguiled, as has bin declared more fully already. And sure we see
that God reserueth the punishment of many faults, to the end to make us look
the further. For if he should as now execute a full judging wherein nothing were
missing: we should have no occasion to hope for the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ: though they call upon him. Therefore it behooves us so to acknowledge
Gods providence, as we consider that he reserueth many things till the last
day. And this is the matter that Eliu should treat of here. This Chapter then
imports none other thing, but that if we open our eyes, we may easily see
that God holds the bridle of all worldly things, and shows himself to be
careful over us. True it is that we see not so perfect and good a state as
were to be wished, no, it is far wide of it. Howbeeit the reason is apparent:
namely, that God is minded too Hear me (says he) for I have yet matter too
speak concerning God. And what matter? I will extend my knowledge a far
(says he) to prove that ^e which made me, is righteous. Eliu in saying that
he had yet to speak of God: shows that a faithful man must not give over
the maintenance of Gods quarrel, too the end to stop their mouths, which
murmr against him, or blaspheme him. And truly if we had but a little piece
of the zeal that is commanded us in the holy that there is yet more too he
spoken of God. This word yet imports that when a faithful man has set
himself against the wicked which impeache Gods honor, he is not discharged
for showing only that he consented not unto them: but as much as in us lies,
we must too the uttermost withstand and resist those that offer wrong unto
God, and go about to diminishe or deface his glory by any manner of means.
We must I say, be their enemies to the uttermost, and never give over the
battle, in so holy and just a quarrel. But in the mean while, we see the
wicked are always ready to mainteyne evil caces: and in these days the
wickeddest man shall find most bearers and bolsterers, insomuch that a man
might conclude, that if he will be favored and borne out, he must give
himself too all evil. And again every man will sell his conscience and his
tongue for a little good cheer or some other such corruption. These things
are manifest, and yet in the mean while, they which say, they have some zeal
of God, are dumb, and dare not open their lips. Seeing then that these
villaynes are so outrageous: I pray you shall there need any other record too
condemn those that have had no courage and stoutness too mainteyne Gods
honor, than the wickedness that is seen in the wicked, in that they do so
link together in all evil. Thus as for goodness, ye shall not find a man
that will hazard himself for it. The wicked may spite God in their
mainteyning of wicked matters, under the color of some present that shall be
given them: and in the mean while, no man shall have the mind the maintain
goodness. Therefore let us learn to be more zealous of Gods glory than we
have been. And first of all, when we see men go about to overthrow the good
and pure doctrine: let us show what faith there is in us, and make confession
of it, by withstanding Satan's lies, and such as seek nothing but to bring
troubles and stumblingblockes into the Church of God. That is one point.
Again, do we see God scorned and dallyed withal, and men talking of the holy
Scripture to bring all religion in disdain? Let us be inflamed with a holy
anger, for it is a cause which ought too move us, and grieve us, when we see
Gods honor wounded, and his religion misused. So then let us show that we
have yet too talk of God. Thirdely, when we hear blasphemies flying abroad
in the streets, or in the markets, or in vittayling houses: let us labor to
resist them to the uttermost of our power, that we may rid and clenze away
such abomination from among us. Wherefore as much as in us lies, let us not
suffer Gods name too be reuyled. And for a conclusion, whenever we see any
evil reign, let us cast a stop before it, and labor too amend it, and
then will God do us the honor too acknowledge us for his Proctors and
Advocates. But if we do otherwise, we give Satan the upper hand, and are
guilty of betraying the name of God, for that we made no account of the thing
which is principal, and so ought too be taken. This is it which we have too
mark upon the words where Eliu says: that yet he bath still too speak of
God. Afterward he goes forward with the same sentence, according also as it
is a case well worthy that the faithful should employ themselves in it too
the uttermost, yea and streyne themselves above all their forces, for when that
we will extend his knowledge a far: thereby he shows, that when we
speak of God, we must lift up our minds higher than our natural
understanding mounteth. And in good sooth, shall a man ever attain unto God,
if he judge according, to his own fancy and fleshly reason? No. But we
shall rather darken his glory. So then, if we will glorify God, let us
learn too reach out our knowledge far and wide, according as example is
given us here. And how? For a man shall never reach out his knowledge as he
ought to do, too that he will prove him to be righteous which made him. Here
we see whereunto all our talk ought to tend when we speak of God: namely to
the mainteyning of his glory. And what doctrine soever is referred to that end,
we must hold it for good and holy: like as when men reason and dispute too
diminishe the honor of God, it is certain that there is nothing in them but
frowardness, how fair colors soever they pretend. So then whenever we
speak of God, let us bear in mind to prove him righteous, that is to say,
too yield him his duty, so as he may be magnified at our hands, and we
acknowledge him such as he would be known to be, that all mouths may be
shette, and have no occasion too mislike of him. Thus ye see that the talk
which we ought to have concerning our God, must be to sanctify his name:
according also us we desire in the prayer that we use every day. And Eliu
adds immediately, that his words shall be void of untruth, and that he
will show unto Job that his knowledge is perfect. Here he protests that
he will not mingle any thing with the good doctrine, nor go about too
disguise it. And surely it is one point further which we ought to mark well,
that when we open our mouth to treat of God and of his works and word,
there must not be any mingling with it, but pureness must be kept, so as all
that ever we speak be whole and sound. For as for him that mingleth good
matter and evil matter together, what does he else, but bring good meat, and
well seasoned to the taste, which yet notwithstanding is poisoned? Eue^ so is
it with all such as make a fair show, and do indeed allege good and true
sayings: and yet notwithstanding do interlace them with lies and errors. Let
us mark well then that he which executes the office of a Teacher, must not
only regard to have good sayings, but specially indeuer too have this
simplicity, that he neither add nor diminishe any thing from Gods pure
doctrine. And therefore if we will have a well ruled faith, we must go by that
line and take good heed, that in teaching, we use nothing too guide us, but
the pure will of God, and that all our words be referred and conformable
therevntoo. But if we handle things otherwise, and deal not with such
soundness and uprightness as God requires, who (as we say) will have his
word preached in singleness, I say if we have not that mind with us: we
shall perceive in the end, that we have been out of the way. Here then we
be taught too receive the pure and holy doctrine as we ought to do, and too
see that it be not mingled. For what a thing is it, too mingle poison with
good drink or good meat? That is the thing which we have too consider in
Elius words. And whereas he says, that he will be perfect in knowledge
toward Job. It is of some men referred unto God, as if Eliu should say,
that in the end Job should perceive, that it was not for him too set God too
school, as we have seen heretofore that he went about to do: not of set
purpose, but because that by his murmuring it might seem that he would have
ruled God after his own manner: and that because he contented not himself
with his doings, he would have found fault with him, and have reserved his
ordinance. For this cause (as some think) Eliu says here, that God shall be
found perfect in knowledge. Howebeeit this saying ought rather too be referred
too him that speaks: as if he should say, thou shalt perceive that I am a
faithful teacher. His meening then is, that forasmuch as he will speak that
God being strong despyseth no man, Verily (says he) that is of strength and
courage. Here he takes a ground to separate God from men, and too take him
out of their number, too the intent we should not think of him as of our
selves. For the very cause why we judge amiss of him, is for that we would
always fashion him after our smalnesse, as who should say there were not an
infinite difference of power betwixt him and us. Then if men go about too
resemble God unto a mortal man, it is a defacing of his Majesty, be angry,
for fear least men should bereeue him of his right. True it is, that men are
blameworthie for so doing, but yet can not any thing prejudice him at all. So
then there is no infirmity in him, that he should envy his creatures: for
he is great. And Eliu adds moreover, that he is great in streength of
heart, or that he is mighty in virtue of mind. Herein Eliu touches another
vice which is in men. For even they which are mighty, and ought not to envy
their inferiors, are notwithstanding so womanish hearted, that they are
afraid of them: according that God quickneth not the wicked, that he gives
judgment too the afflicted, and that he turns not away his eyes from the
righteous. These sentences which Eliu takes, are general: and also it
behooves us generally too conclude, that God is righteous even when we
perceive not any sign of his righteousness. And we must remember the thing
that has been declared before: which is, that when we see that things are not
set in so good order and perfection as we would wish: it must put us in
mind, that God will one day judge the world in the person of his son,
according too the article of our belief, that Jesus Christ must come too
judge both the quick and the dead: and truly (as I have said) if all things
were disposed as were too be wished: what a matter were it? We should no
more look for the last resurrection. Do we then see that God executes not
all his judgments, but reserueth some too himself? Let the same confirm us
in the hope of the last day, and of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,
unto whom God his father has given all power, too the intent he should
appear in his Majesty, too right all things that are out of order, and too
set them at a stay. And when we see that God punishes some offenses, and
delyuereth those that are his: whether it be our selves or others, let the
same susfise us too allow of his providence. I see that God has punished
such a fault: then must I conclude that he has showed me as it were a
myrrour of his justice, and that the wicked shall come too account before him.
For why, he accepts no persons, he is not an earthly Judge that will do
good justice by startes, so as if there be some fault committed, it shall be
punished with great rigor, and in the mean while, many others shall be let
slip through some briberie or parcialitie, and so shall the Judge be quite
and clean changed. This is evident, insomuch that all the Justice in the
world, yea even the best that is too be found, is but theeuishnesse because
it proceeds not of a good and sound mind that holds out continually. But
there is no such thing in God: he is not moved with favor, nor corrupted
with rewards. What then? He judges according too the truth. Seeing it is
so: we must needs conclude, that when God punishes an offense, therein he
shows us that nothing escapes him but that all our works must come too
account before him, and that although they be hidden at this day, so as they
be not perceived at the first, yet we shall be nevertheless guilty when
we come thither. So then, let us learn too practice this lesson that is
showed us here, that is to wit, that God turns not away his eyes from the
righteous, no^ quickens the wicked. And how shall we know that? Not
always, nor all after one rate, as I have said before but yet God gives us
sufficient proofs, too conclude that he watches over the Godly, too the end
too maynteyne them, and that he keeps them in his protection, pitying them,
and delivering them from all dangers. I say, we see such examples hereof,
as we must needs have this matter fully settled and concluded in us.
Furthermore, we see also that God lifts that he quickneth not the But as
this doctrine is set down here too teach us too glorify God in all
respects: so also let us mark that it must edify our faith, and teach us
the fear of God. Do we then see that God turns not away his eyes from the
Godly, but has pity upon them too help them? Let us be stablished in trust
of his goodness, that we may resort unto him as often as we be afflicted.
Have we seen that God has delivered any man, or that he has delivered our
selves? Let the same make us too return too him, and say, how now? My God
has made me too feel by experience, that he is ready too help all such
as trust in him: and the Scripture says unto us, Come unto me all ye that
labor, and are heavy laden, and I will refreshe you. Ye see then, that all
the records which God gives us, witnessing that he will not turn away his
eyes from the Godly, must confirm us in the promises of his goodness which
he gives us. Also on the contrary part,

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him too make us feel them in such wise, as we may
learn to be sorry for them, yea and too be angry and grieved at our vices,
and sinful lusts, so as we may seek earnestly too have his righteousness
raygne in us, and too be reformed too his holy will, and that moreover
forasmuch as we have too fight against the temptations of this present life,
he will give us armor too defend our selves withal, that although we
know much misery and wretchedness in our selves, yet we may not doubt but
that he will uphold us, and supply our wantes by his grace, according as we
know that all perfection of virtue and goodness is in him, to give the same
unto us, according as he knows us too have need. That it may please him to
grant this grace, not only too us, but also to all people and nations of the
earth, bringing back all poor ignorant souls, etc.

The.Cxl. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xxxvj. Chapter.
6 He quickneth not the wicked, but gives judgment to the afflicted.

7 He will not turn his eyes away from the righteous, he will set kings in
their seats and they shall be exalted for ever.

8 If they be in the stocks, and bound with the cords of affliction.

6 He will show them their faults, and make them feel their sins, and
they shall be touched with them.

10 He will open their ear to the end to amend them: he will speak unto
them, and make them depart from iniquity.

11 If they hear him and obey him, they shall pass their days in
prosperity, and their years in glory.

12 If they hear not, they shall pass by the svvorde, and be consumed
without knowledge.

13 The hypocrites of heart do put to wrath: they cry not even when they be
bound.

14 Therefore their soul shall die in youth, and their life among the
whoremongers.


AFter that Eliu has generally said that God turns not his eyes from the
righteous, but has a care of him: and contrariwise, that he quickneth not the
that be gives judgment to the afflicted. For if a poor man that is utterly
destitute of succor, and an outcast in the world, is nevertheless delivered
from vexation and trouble: the same must needs proceed of God, yea I say, it
must needs be fathered upon God. For if we have no stay in the world, and
yet have strong and mighty enemies: what is to be said, but that we are undone,
and that there is no more hope of our life? Then if we recover, government of
Princes and of men that sit in the seat of Justice: wherein we perceive that
God is righteous, and that he will not have things to be out of order. And
although there be not a continual rate euenly kept at all times (as was
declared yesterday) yet notwithstanding when we see that there that God
stablisheth Kings, and that not for one day, but too the intent that the same
order should stand for ever in the world. True it is that there are many
chaunges off and on, and that there fall great alterations upon Principalities
and Lordshippes: and therein God showed also that it is his office too pull
down the proud. But yet nevertheless, even in despite of men and of all
their rage, there shall some order remain still here below, I say even in
respect of tyrants. If a King reygne wrongfully, so as he be a despizer of
God, and full of cruelty, outrage, and insatiable couetousenesse: yet
notwithstanding he must be feign too keep some shadow and countenance of
Justice, and he cannot go beyond it. Whereof comes that, but because God
shows himself there? And therefore let us learn to profit our selves in
such wise by the things that are seen in this world, as God may be glorified
at our hand, as he deserves: and specially when we see him deliver the poor
that are utterly oppressed, and another have, nor hope for any succor at men's
hands: let us there consider his mighty power and goodness, and dispoze our
selves too yield him his due prayze. This (say I) is the thing that we have to
note. Howbeit herewithall, to the intent to prove our selves to be Gods
children, let us beware that we lend our helping hand to such as are wrongfully
persecuted, and that according to the ability which God gives us, we do
succor such as are trode^ under foot, and have no means to revenge or bear
out themselves. We must (I say) do our indeuer in that behalf, and streyne
our selves too it in good earnest. Secondly, since we see governors and men of
authority so froward and spiteful, and yet notwithstanding that God suffers
them not to fall quite out into all disorder: there let us humble our selves to
honor his providence, assuring our selves that if he restreyned not their
wickedness, we should be overwhelmed with an horrible fludde, and all should
be swallowed up and drowned out of hand. Therefore it behooves us to magnify
God in that we see there remains some justice and good order, although that
such as reygne and hold the swoorde in their hand, be utterly wicked and given
to all naughtiness. So then, let us consider the same, and let us (as much as
in us is) maynteyne the order of justice, for so much as it is a sovereign
benefit that God bestows upon mankind, and that therein also it is his will
too haue^ his providence known unto us. And since we see that Princes and
Magistrates and all officers of Justice are so far out of square: let us be
sorry to see the order so perverted which God had dedicated to the welfare of
men: and not only let us abhor such as are the enemies of God, and withstand
the order of government which he had set over the^: but also let us know, that
they be the fruits of our sins, to the intent we may impute the fault and cause
of the whole mischief to our own selves. Thus ye see what we have to remember
in this text. Now let us come to that which Eliu adds: He says that if the
good men, or else if the great men of set in the stocks: I say if they be at
any time brought down, even too shame and reproach, so as men put them in
prison and fetter them, and they be tied to confuzion with coardes: yet
notwithstanding God forsakes the^ not in such necessity, but makes them to
feel their sins, and tells them the faults that they have committed, to
the end that upon knowledge of them, they may amend them and return into the
right way, and he opens their does God show them their sins that are so
tormented, and makes them to perceive what they be: and that is to the end to
bring them to good amendment. too shame us. So much the more therefore must we
be provoked too think upon our sins, and too be sorry for them, and
therewithal too mark how Eliu adds, that God does then open our ears.
That saying betokens two things in the holy Scripture. For sometimes it
signifies but too speak too us: and sometimes it signifies too touch our
hearts in such wise as we hear what is said too us. God therefore opens
our ears, when he sends us his word, and causes the same to be set
before us: and again he opens our that if they hear and obey, they shall
spend their days in weal, and their years in glory: but if they berken not
too him, they shall pass by the swoorde, and dye without knowledge. Here Eliu
shows us yet better, the profit that we have by being in adversity. It is
undoubtedly a great benefit, and which cannot be sufficiently valued, when we
be drawn to repentance, and that whereas we were in the high way to
damnation, our Lord brings us back to himself. I say it is a thing that
ought to assuage all the sorrow of our afflictions. Howbeeit there is yet much
more in it: namely that our Lord shows us by proof, how profitable the same
is for us, to the end we may be delivered from our adversities and succored
by him, and he show himself favorable to us by that means. Seeing then that
all this is found by experience: have we not cause too be glad when God
delivers us after that sort? For if he should suffer us to be sotted in the
pleasures of his world, in the end we would grow paste grace, and
therefore he is feign to remedy it in due season. And if he do it by
afflicting us, and thereupon deliver us to the intent we should perceive his
hand: is it not a singular proof of his favor, and of our faith? If God
should suffer us to welter in our own filthiness and to settle in our own
lees (as the Prophets term it) we would rotte away as I have said before: and
besides that, we would not esteem his grace toward us to he such as he
shows it by taking us out of the adversities whereunto we were fallen. Lo
here a double benefit that redoundeth unto men by Gods correcting them after
that manner. For first and formest they be brought back unto him: and
secondly they perceive his fatherly goodness when they be delivered by this
grace. Thus ye^ see what we have to mark in this streyne. Now a man might
demand, yea, is it so? are we sure that Gods intent is to draw us to
repentance, when he scourges us himself, or when he suffers us to be
troubled by man? What can we tell whither his purpose and will be such or no?
Hereunto we answer: In as much as we see that afflictions last but for a time,
and God delivers us from them: let us understand thereby, that he minds
not to undo us utterly, but is contented that we be beaten down and humbled
under his hand. But if our necks be of brass to withstand him, so as we will
not bow for the corrections that he sends us, we do nothing else but
continually double his strokes. Then on the contrary part, if we feel our
sins so, as we crave forgiveness of them, and he perceive us to be rightly
touched: then makes he our adversities to turn to a wholesome medicine too
us, and thereupon he delivers us from them. We see all this (I say) even
with our eyes. So then let us not grudge any more when we see God send such
troubles into the world, another let us be offended at it as though he had
his eyes shet. For he knows well enough what he does, and he has an
infinite wisdom which appears not to us at the first dash: and in the end
we shall see that he has dispozed things in good order and measure. Also let
us learn herewithall, not to be to much grieved when we be afflicted after
that manner, assuring our selves that God does by that means further our
salvation. Again, would we be healed when we be so in trouble and pain?
would we have a good and desirable end of them? Then let us follow the way
that is showed us here, namely to hear and obey. How to hear? By being
taught when God holds us as it were in his schole, so as our afflictions may
be as many instructions to resort unto him. Then let us hear these things, and
let not that slip out of the one ear which entered in at the other: but let
us obey, that is to say, let us yield God such obedience as we ought to do:
and let us not seek any thing else tha^ to frame ourselves wholly unto him. Lo
by what that we shall pass by the swoorde and be consumed without knowledge,
that is to say, in our own folly. Whereas it is said that we shall pass
by the swoorde: the meening is that the wounds shall be utterly that such ^s
give no care unto God shall die without knowledge, that is to say, their own
folly shall undo them. This is said to the end that men should be left without
excuse. True it is that we will shield our selves with ignorance when we go
about to qualify our faults, or else to wipe them quite away. We will say, I
thought no such thing, I wist not of it. But let us learn to know that when
any mention is made of men's ignorace: it is to condemnethem the more because
they played the beasts and had no reason at all in them. And even so does the
Prophet Esaias speak thereof. The very cause (says the Lord) why Hell is
open, and why the grave swalloweth up all things, and why all my people are
consumed, is for that they had no knowledge. God complayneth there of the
sinners for casting themselves wilfully into destruction: and therewithal
says that that befe^^ them for want of knowledge: yea but immediately he
vpbraydeth the Jews that they were become brutish. For the Lord on his
behalf does sufficiently warn us, that it is long of none but of our selves
that we be not well taught. Truly God is a good scholemaister, but we be ill
scholars: God speaks to us, and we be deaf: or else we stop our ears to
the intent we would not hear him. So then, the ignorance whereof Eliu speaks
here, is wilful, because men cannot find in their hearts that God should
point them their lesson, or teach them to come unto him, but ^ad lever to follow
continually the common trace, and therefore shet their eyes and stop their
ears. Thus ye see an ignorance that is full of wilfulness and stubbornness.
Now it is true that for a time the wicked do like well of themselves when they
feel not Gods hand. Howbeeit it is so much the worse for them, as we see
examples of it day by day. If a man speak to these unthrifts that are given to
al naughtiness, and threaten them with Gods vengeance: they do but nodde their
head at it, and make a mock at it, bearing themselves in hand that it is but
a sporting matter. Again, they take sermons in scorn, and turn all the holy
Scripture into skoffing, to the end it should have no more reverence nor
authority. We see this before our eyes, Howbeeit, they do always impair
their case: for surely this saying shall not fall to the ground, namely that
whosoever will not hear God in affliction, must needs perish without
knowledge: that is to say, the ignorance that the Hypocrites of heart do put
too wrath, and that they cry not when they be bound: that their soul shall die
in youth, and that they shall perish with the whoremongers. He says
Hypocaites of heart: and why does he term them so? He meeneth those that are
imbrued with naughtiness, and have a backenooke too shrink into from God, and
Hypocrites of heart, that is to say, which have in them the root of contempt
and of al stubbornness, so as they mock God and have no reverence of his
word, but the Devil has so bewitched them, that they condemn the good and
follow the evil, or at lestwise allow it, and could find in their putting to
wrath: for it is as much as to kindle the fire still more and more, and to throw
wood into it to increace it. And in good sooth, what do the froward sort when
they strive and stomach against God in that wise? Do they amend their case and
state? Alas, they do but heap up wood more and more, and the wrath of God
must needs burn the whotter. So then let us mark, that if we resist Gods
chastizeme^ts, thinking too beat them back by our wilsulnesse and
frowardness: we shall but increace wrath, and Gods curse shall augment more
and more, till we be utterly consumed by it. Now when we hear this, what have
we to do, but to pray God, first to purge us in such wise, as we may not
have the said rooted stubbornness and privy spytefulnes in us: but that
although we have done amiss through infirmity, yet there may always be some
root of the fear of god in us, so as we become not utterly past ame^dment.
Also let us ever indeuer to inure our selves to the said soberness and
singleness of heart, to the end we be not so snarled in our sins, as to
like well of them and to foster them. And moreover let us mark well, that if
we will work wyles and pollices with God, our market shall not be amended
awhit by it, but we shall rather increace his wrath toward us. Ye see the^
that men ought to look well to the ame^ding of their evil doings, seeing that
Gods curse shall be so increaced upon them. And here is express mention made
of the increasing of Gods wrath, because men think themselves to be escaped,
when God has delivered them from some one mischau^ce, for then they think all
the worst is paste. But we think not upon the means that are hidden from us,
namely that God will anon after bring forth new rods, that he will draw new
swords, and that he will suddenly thunder upon us when we look not for it.
For as much then as we are not sufficiently afraid of Gods wrath: therefore it
is purposely said that the same increaceth, and that we heap it more and more
upon us: insomuch that a hundred thousand deaths must needs way te upon us,
when we shall have despised the message which God sent us to bring us back
again and to guide us into the right way. Therefore when we shall have
despized Gods warnings after that sort, we must be feign to feel his horrible
vengeance upon us, whereas otherwise he protests that he is always ready to
comfort such as submit themselves willingly to his good will.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgeme^t of
our faults, praying him that his correcting of us and our feeling of his
stripes may not be in vain but that we may learn thereby to return unto him,
so as we may not tarry till he show us some sign of his wrath; but that
forasmuch as we be daily allured by his word, (and that after so loving and
gentle a fashion as we see,) we may not grow hardharted, but rather give
dilligent ear to that which he shall say, that we may prevent his judgment:
and that whenever he lists to execute any rigor upon us for our sins,
we may not therefore cease to have an eye continually to his promise, and
too hope that after he has made us to feel our own miseries, he will
deliver us from them, namely upon condition that we learn to be sorry for
them and to forsake them. That it may please him to grant this grace not only
to us, but also all people and nations of the earth, etc.

The.Cxlj. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxxvj. Chapter.
15 He sets aside the poor in their affliction, and opens their ears in
their oppression.

16 Truly he vvoulde pluck thee out of the mouth of distress, and set thee in
a large place, where there should be no streyghtnesse: and the rest of thy
table should be full of fat.

17 Thou have filled the judgment of the wicked: but yet shall judgment and
justice hold out.

18 For behold the wrath, to the end that he destroy thee not with thine
ability, and that the multitude of gifts deliver thee not.

19 He will not regard thy greatness, nor all thy provision, nor all thy
force.


WE have seen heretofore, that shall die in the flower of their youth and
with whoremongers: as if a man should say that God opens the ears of those
whom he afflicts. And not without cause is this repeted, forasmuch as it is
hard to make me^ believe it, and yet not withstanding we may well consider that
this doctrine is more than necessary that God sets them aside [or sholeth
the^ out] in affliction. True it is that some translate it Deliver, according
also as it is taken in that sense. Howbeeit it is not meant here that God takes
them out of their affliction, but it is set down in [ or ] affliction. So
then it is a similitude that Eliu uses: as if he should say, that God
sholeth out and gathers to himself those whom he chastizeth, because that
when men are in prosperity, they wander and dote in their own imaginacions:
but as soon as God lays his hand upon them, and makes them to feel his
rigor: it is all one as if he should take them aside to himself, to show them
their faults, and to bring them to repentance. Now we see in effect what Eliu
meant to say. And let us mark well, that the opening of men's ears by
affliction, such as God will not suffer to perish, and for that cause does he
chastize them. Now if it be needful that God should work so toward his
chozen: what had he need to do generally to all mankind? Here is no mention
made but of those whom God knows and auoweth for his children, and whose
salvation he intends to procure by governing them with his holy spirit: and
yet notwithstanding even they should have their ears stopped, and they should
be sotted in their own pleasures, if God drew them not to himself by
afflictions. Therefore let us learn that God will pluck a man from the ^rim
(it is properly from the mouth) of anguish and affliction, and set him in a
large place where be shall be no more in distress, and the rest of his table
shall be full of fat. The word Rest may be taken as well but thou have
performed the judgment of the wicked. Thou see then that thou can not
abide that God should do thee good. Now it is true that Job is accused partly
wrongfully. Nevertheless it is not without cause that Eliu condemns him for
grudging against God, and tells him that judgment and justice shall hold
out, not withstanding all his murmuring. In the mean while, we may gather a
good lesson out of this verse: which is, that when God scourges us, we must
that Job had fulfilled the judgment of the wicked. True it is that these
words may also be taken, as though it were said, that he had filled justice
and judgment, with the judgments of iniquity. But the true meening is, that
Job had ouershot himself so far as to cupple himself with wicked men.
Nevertheless, this is not meant of his life, as though he had been a thief, a
whoremo^ger, or a murderer, or as though he had been a blasphemer or a looce
liver: Eliu meant none of all those things: but the meening is, that Job had not
glorified God in his adversities, but had repyned to much against him, yea and
had gone about too exalte himself, as though God had done him wrong, and used
cruelty toward him. Thus ye see wherein Job is condemned here. Not that he
had led a leude life: but for that he had not borne his adversity patiently
enough. And that is called a fulfilling of the judgment of the wicked, that
is to say, an agreeing to their fashions and enormities. For we have also to
note, that nothing is more precious unto God, than the glory of his own
name. True it is, that when men give themselves, some to whoredom, some to
outrage, and some to gluttony: therein Gods justice is impeached, and the
order that he has set among us is perverted and broken: and (as much as in
us lies) Gods majesty is always defaced. But yet notwithstanding, when a man
blasphemeth God openly, and humbles not himself under his hand: no doubt but
it exceeds all other sins, and is to be condemned more grievously.
Therefore we ought too mark well this streine, where Job is vpbraided with
fulfilling the judgment of the wicked. Now, that we may take the more
profit of this sentence: it behooves us to that judgment and justice shall
hold on still. As if he should say, that men may well play the mad bedlems, but
yet shall God continue still in his full state, and in the end that his being
angry, is to the end that a man should not be confounded in his ability:
for then (says he) there were no remedy: he will not pass for gold nor
for silver, nor for all the force of the world. Lo here a goodly confirmation
of that which we have touched already: that is to wit, that Gods causing of us
to feel his wrath, is to the end we should not be utterly destroyed: for if
he spare us, we do nothing else but harden more and more. When men have
once stepped awry, and God bears with them: the more that he forbeareth
them, the more do they grow brutish. For although that in using gentleness
toward us, his intent is to win us by that mean: yet notwithstanding our
nature is so froward, that in stead of coming to him, we dragge still from
him. To be short, we see it is to common a thing among men, to dally with God
when he uses them gently, and to do nothing else but mock at his goodness
and patience. Forasmuch as it is so, God must needs utter his wrath, or else
we should all of us perish, and his long forbearing of us would be an
augmenting of our damnation* And that is it which Saint Paul meeneth when he
says, that Gods afflicting of us is to the end we should not perish with the
world. Therefore it behooves us to be of good comfort in the mids of our
troubles, seeing that God has a regard of our salvation, and procures the
same by showing himself rough toward us. For we cannot abide that he should
be a loving father to us, and that he should handle us tenderly: we abuse his
goodness continually: and therefore he is feign to make us feel his
displeasure, or else we should utterly perish. to the end that God do not
utterly overthrow him and consume him with his ability. This serves to abate
men's pride in that they will needs strengthen themselves continually against
Gods hand. And for that cause Eliu adds, that there shallbee no raunsoming:
for we may well bring great presents, but yet shall another gold nor silver be
able to deliver us from the hand of God: but rather the same shall be an
occasion too destroy us. And here we must understand, that God intends to
abate men's aduauncing of themselves against him. For if one man be rich,
another in good credit, and a third in good estimation and woorshippe: we make
bulwarks of these things against God, and we think ourselves well enough
senced to withstand his hand. Or if we have not that foolish conceyte: yet
will there always be some blockishnesse in us. For until such time as men be
brought to nothing, so as they know there is another strength nor ought else in
them: they think themselves able to withstand God. What is to be done then?
Let us learn that all our ability is less than nothing, specially when we
have to deal with our God, for he will do no more but blow upon it. We
may well gather together all the strength in the world, not only which might
be in any one man, yea though he were the stro^gest that ever was: but also all
the strength that is in all creatures above and beneath: and yet shall it be
nothing worth at all if we have the hand of God against us. And therefore
let us mark well, that if we will humble ourselves before God, we must dispatch
away all vain presumptuousnesse, and not think we have any thing remaining
in us: in so much that although we think we have some courage and strength in
us for a time, yet it behooves us to know that all the same is but a smoke, if
it please God too consume us. And thereupon let us return unto God, praying
him to give us ability by his power, that is to say, to make us to rest
always upon him, knowing that we hold our life and all the appurtenances
thereof, of his only free goodness. Thus ye see what we have to mark in this
streyne where it is said, that God will destroy men with their ability, and
that they shallbee consumed notwithstanding all their strength. And whereas it
is said that there shall be no raunsoming: it serves to ex^pesse the better
the thing that we come to say. I or although all men grant, that another gold
nor silver are able to ransom a man from the ^^d of God: yet we see that they
fall asleep in their riches, credit and such other things. And when they have
granted that they cannot withstand God: yet do they make bulwarks of them,
as though they were able too beat back all harms, and so they fight against
God How so? whence comes such presumptuousnesse? Behold, a woorme of the
earth, which is but carrion and rottenness, aduaunceth it self against God:
and must not that needs be a horrible and more than beastly blockishnesse?
Yes surely. Specially when a man is rich, so as he thinks S. Peter tells
us, that we be not bought with gold nor silver, but with the precious blood of
the unspotted Lamb. Thus ye see that the point whereunto we must come for the
concluding of this text, is that after we once know that we be bereft of all
means to escape Gods hand, and that we should of necessity be utterly
consumed, but that he uses pity toward us: we must understand that he has
given us a good remedy, in that it pleased him too offer up his only Son in
sacrifize for us: for then were we fully raunsomed, and that is a sufficient
discharge to put away all our faults, so as the devil shall not have any
interest in us. For although we were overwhelmed with the infinite multitude of
our sins: yet notwithstanding if the blood of Jesus Christ answer for us,
it is a sufficient satisfaction for all our offenses, and enough to appease the
wrath of God. Ye see then whereunto our refuge must be. But we cannot come to
the blood of Jesus Christ, until we be bereft of all stateliness, as well past
as to come. Paste, to the end we may consider that we should utterly perish in
our sin, and be quite and clean overwhelmed, if God had not given us this
mean of being purged by the blood of his Son. And to come, to the end, we be
no more carried away with such rage, as to lift up our selves against God, as
though we could escape his hand, but rather hold our selves in such awe, even
with a willing mind, as we look not that God should cheyne us up like wild
beasts, but as every of us may bridle himself of his own accord. Let us
have such modesty in us, as not to attempt any thing against him: but
whenever it shall please him to chastize us, let every of us think thus in
himself: Go to, my God chastises me for such a sin, and after such a manner:
and it behooves me to make my profit of it. Therefore let us not be deaf when
God warns us after that fashion: but let us look narrowly too our selves,
and be watchful according to the examples that he gives us, to the intent we
grow not past grace, and so the thing befall us which is spoken heretofore,
namely that we heap up continually a greater wrath and a more horrible
vengeance of God upon us.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgeme^t of
our sins, praying him to give us such repentance of them, as we may resort
wholly unto him, to submit our selves fully to the guyding of his holy
spirit, that we may walk rightly according to his good will, in such wise as
his name may be glorified in us all our life long. And so let us all say,
Almighty God our heavenly father, etc.

The.Cxlij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxxvj. Chapter.
20 Consume not the night to root out the people under them.

21 Keep thee from turning to iniquity, for thou have chozen it rather than
affliction.

22 Behold, God exalts by his power, who is like him to teach?

23 Whom has he set over him in his vvayes ( or who has ouerlooked him in
his way?) who shall say unto him, thou have done amiss?

24 Remember thou to magnify his work which men behold.


WE know it is a good and profitable thing to think upon gods works. And that
also is the thing whence we must fetch all our learning and wisdom through
our whole life. But specially in the night time when we be alone by our
selves, we have leisure to be occupied in applying our minds to that study.
For we ouerpasse the things that we that we must not spend the night in musing
to much bow the people are rooted out under them. It is good to seek how
God rooteth out nations, to consume or swallowe up the night Mark that for one
point. And furthermore let us mark, that whereas it is said, that the people
are rooted out under them: it is to magnify gods power the more, in that he
causes me^ to sink as it were into a bottomless pit in the same place that
he shall have given the^ to dwell in. If a whole nation were driven out before
our eyes, and conveyed into some far country, and continued still the same
that it was: that were no matter to make us to wonder so much. But when
suddeine changes come in the world: it that nations shall be rooted out of
their place, and as it were under their foot, as though the earth had opened
and swalowed them up, so as keep thee from turning to iniquity: for thou
baste chozen it rather than affliction, or else because of affliction: for the
Hebrew word and manner of speech imports both twain. First and foremost Job
is warned here, that he should not turn to evil. And under that term we
meene not either robbery, or murder, or spitefulness, or such other like
things: but we understand the hartburnings against God, and the grudgings and
rebellings that proceed of impaciencie. The cause then why it is said that lob
must keep himself from turning unto evil, is for that he showed not himself
to be pacientynough in submitting himself unto God, and in acknowledging his
righteousness during the time of his adversity. And it is purposely said unto
him, that he should stand upon his guard: for it is a hard thing too forbear
falling, when we be pinched with adversity. Again, look what is said unto
Job, ought to serve us all. And so let us take this saying as an exhortation of
the holy Ghosts to us al in common, that we should be watchful when we be
afflicted, so as we swerve not aside unto evil. What is the reason? For
as soon as Gods hand touches us, we be grieved out of measure, and there
needs no more to put us out of patience. Specially if the affliction be
great and violent, then are we utterly dismayed, what stoutnesse soever there
were in us before: and whereas a man would have thought us to be invincible, we
be quite out of heart, and wot not where to become. Seeing then that there is
such frailty in us, it stands us in hand to look well to our selves, and
to do our indeuer to hold fast that which is good. Yea verily: for although a
man streyne himself to the uttermost, yet shall he have much ado to stand
out, that he stumble not by some means or other. Yet notwithstanding we have
cause to be of good cheer, for so much as that Job bad chozen evil rather than
affliction, or because of affliction. Both these translations tend to one
end: which is, that Job bare not his case peasably with humbling of himself,
but lyfted up himself against God in his affliction, and considered not that it
behooved him to have stouped under the hand of him that hilde him in his power.
If a man ask how Job rather than affliction: (for that is the most convenient
and fit translation, notwithstanding that both of them (as I said) do come to
one end:) that manner of speaking has a certain grace in it, whereof we may
gather instruction. It is said then, that Job choze iniquity rather than
affliction: And how* When a man chafeth against God, does he therefore
escape his hand? No: but he holds not himself in his array, for adversity
ought to make us to stoop, but we fight against the hand of God. True it is
that our so doing is in vain, for we shall be disappoynted of all our hope,
and we shall gain nothing by it: but yet for all that, as often as we gnash our
teeth after that manner against God through impaciencie, our meening is (if it
were possible) to be no more subject unto God. And that is the cause why I
said that this saying imports a good doctrine. For if we perceived thoroughly
that all such as can not yield meekely unto adversity, are loath to be subject
unto God, and could find in their hearts to beat back all his force: we
would abhor impacientnesse much more than we do, yea and we would think it
to be an intolerable blasphemy. Then if we stick not to chafe and turmoyle
when Gods hand is upon us: it is a token that we be not acquainted with that
which is said in this text, namely that all such as are impatient are loath to
be subject any more unto God, and would feign have the soueraintie and
authority abolished which he has over them. This is a thing that ought to
put us in mind to be more pacient than we have been wont to be, whenever it
pleases our God too frame us to humility. And after this Eliu adds, That
God exalts by his power, and who is like him in teaching? or who is such a
lawmaker as he? Othersome translate it, who is he that rusheth or casts
forth as he does? For the Hebrew word betokens also to cast or throw
Nevertheless, the process of the text shows, that forasmuch as Gods
wisdom is treated of here, it is better to take the word for ^o teach or to
task men too a law or doctrine, according as the word betokens most
commonly. Now then it behooves us too take this sentence after the first
manner: which is, that God bath not his like in teaching. This is not referred
simply to the word of God, but also too the inward power which God utters,
when it pleases him to touch us to the quick, and to pierce our hearts in such
wise as we come to him. Truly whenever Gods word is preached, or when men
Behold, God exalts or aduaunceth by his power. Hereby he shows, that if
God work with us, we must not go about to know the uttermost of all things
that he does, as we may try the works of men: for inasmuch as we have them
before our eyes, we behold them and look every corner of them, and also we
be able to handle them with our hands, and to toss them and turn them at our
pleasure. It is not so with the works of God. And why? For he exalts in his
power: that is to say, he is wonderful in his doings. Therefore men must not
attempt nor preace so far, as to search the uttermost of his doings, or to
judge at adventure of them and to give bridle to their rashness, when they
comprehend not all that is in them. And why? Seeing that Gods works are so
high, (as which do proceed of his infinite power,) it behooves us also to stay
at them. For we be couched here by low, there is a great distance between
them and us, and we cannot fly so high. Wherefore let us hold us contented
with that which God sends, and suffer our selves to be governed by his holy
spirit, and neither covet nor desire too know any thing, save that which he
shall have showed us. To be short, let us be his scholars, assuring our selves
that all our wisdom consists in brideling our own fancies, so as they
raunge not abroad. Now we see what the meening of Eliu is. And therefore for
the better confirming of the matter which I have dealt with heretofore, let us
follow the said admonition. It has been said that it is a good thing to apply
our mind to the considering of Gods works, so be it that we deal soberly,
acknowledging the slenderness of our own understanding. Therefore whereas it
is said, that God exalts in his power: let us understand that he intends
not to let us wander after our own liking. And therefore let us not be so
proudas to say, that his works are to be esteemed as men's works: but let us
assure our selves that he will have men to magnify them, and to honor them.
Furthermore forasmuch as wisdom fails us, and yet notwithstanding our
flesh tempts and tickleth us to be desirous to seek more than is lawful
for us to know: let us bear in mind that there is none like god in teaching,
and therefore that it behooves us to come to him, to the end that he may
inlighten us, and that our minds may be governed by his hand and direction.
When we be taught in that school: we shall profit enough in Gods works,
and therewithal we shall have wherewith to bar all our own curiosities.
And undoubtedly it behooves us to be always watchful, that we may restrain
our selves. For although the faithful be modest, and framed a long while
aforehande to receive instruction at Gods hand: yet notwithstanding there are
still some curiosities flittering in their heads, so as they be haled away, and
many imaginations come in their minds, causing them to say, why is this? and
why is that? But let us always come back to this conclusion, that for so much
as we be not able to comprehend Gods works, no nor any creature else is of
power to do it: it behooves us too come unto him, and he must not only
teach us by his word, but also inlighten us and order our thoughts, and
bring us under his lure, to hold us fully in awe. Thus ye see in effect what
we have to remember in this sentence. Now it is said anon after, who shall
ouersee him in his way? And who shall say to him, thou have done amiss? or
else, whom has be set over him in his way? for the Hebrew word signifies to
give pre-eminence and lordship, and sometime to visit or ouersee.
Nevertheless the meening of Eliu is evident enough: namely that it is not for
mortal creatures to control God, or to make search to find fault with his
doings, and to blame them as though he were misaduised and knew not how to
order things as they should be. This is the sum of that which is contained
here. Now to the intent we may gather a more familiar doctrine of this
sentence: let us set it down for a ground, that men must be judged by God,
and that they have not authority that we must remember to magnify them. And
why? For at length we shall find men to be convinced by experience, that God
does not any thing but in all uprightness and equity. Therefore let us
consider it that our minds may be restreyned, to the end we fall not to
straying and gadding over all the fields. And it behooves us too join these
two sentences together as they be matched here. The first is, who is he that
can say unto God, thou have done amiss? And the other is, That we must
remember to magnify him. Truly most For he has not set any person over
himself. Herein is showed us that men are ouerfoolishe and distitute of
reason, when they dispute so against God: Why? For who has set them in any
such office? If a man should take upon him to judge those over whom he has
no authority, and to set taskes and tallages upon them, and too give sentence
upon their doings: would the world think well of such presumptuousnesse?
would it not take such a man to be a stark fool? But we be far more fond
in lifting up our selves against God. If a poor Beggar should give away
Dukedomes and Lordships, and appoint Judges and Lieutenantes in a Country:
every man would laugh him to scorn. But we do much more when we take upon
us to rule God, and to give him his lesson. And what a presumptuousnesse is
that? If we would take in hand to subdue all Princes to our lure, it were not
so great and furious stateliness as this. Now then Eliu shows here, that if
we be tempted too judge ouerhastily of Gods works, and that our reason wexe
to bold and proud: we must come to this point to say, What? when all things
are thoroughly considered, is it mere for us too look unto God to control
him, or to spy out his doings too find fault with them when they have passed
his hands? Have we the oversight of him? Is it for us too examine his ways?
Then if we be once fully resolved of that point, it will be enough to bar
all curious questions, and to hold us in awe. For (to be short) it behooves us
to conclude, that gods showing of his works unto us, is to the end that we
being under the^, should look upon them, and consider them. It is said here,
who is he that shall ouersee [or ouerlooke] him? This saying imports much:
for there are two sorts of looking upon Gods works. The one is when we
perceive our own smalnesse, and acknowledging that we do but creep here
bylow, do lift up our minds aloft by faith, assuring our selves that we be not
able to comprehend so high and profound secrets, and (to be short) when with
our faith there is matched this lowliness of honoring the things that are
unknown to us. Thus ye see one good manner of looking upon Gods works, for it
is under him. Therefore when we be so lowly and meek hearted, and having
considered our own measure, do lift up our heads and cast up our eyes,
desiring reverently to know what it pleases God to show us, and no more: then
do we look upon Gods works under him. But contrariwise it is said in this
text, who is he that shall ouerlooke him [or look above him] in his ways? Lo
here a contrary way of looking, when men advance themselves and mount above
with their Ergoes, and with a desire too ouerlooke Gods works as though the
same were under them. But when they mount after that manner, they must needs
break their necks: for what manner of Ladders have they? Again, let us labor
as much as we can in our vain imaginations, and it is certain that we shall
have no foundation to bear us up. So then it is an untoward and cursed
fashion of looking upon Gods works, when men step to him as though they
would thrust all his doings, under their feet, and call him to account, and
sit in judgment upon him as though they had superiority to ouerrule him.
Let us keep us from such diuelishe pride: for it is added as an appurtenance,
that we must remember to magnify Gods works. And that is the second
sentence, which I said was too be matched with the other former one. But why
is it said, that we must remember it? For it seems that Eliu might have
said at one word: Magnify thou the works of God: but he says Remember
thou. Why so? For we be willingly occupied about our own wicked
imaginations, which hinder us from yielding God his deserved and due glory.
And therefore it stands us in hand too quicken up the remembrance of our
mind, seeing we be so forgetful of God. As for example. When we should
think upon God, the first thing that will come to our thought, shall be some
illusion of Satan's, to make us fall in a rage, or too cast us into despair, or
to snarle us in some distrust, or else to make us tumble into our destruction.
Ye see then that our wits are ouerwrapped that men know them, to do us to
wit, that when men have fought their fill against God, (according as we see
that pride is always in us:) yet in the end we must needs be overcome. For
God will peradventure suffer us to inquire of him vnaduizedly: but when we
have so given the bridle to our fleshly lusts, and Satan has carried us away
in our foolish affections: in the end we shall perceive (how be it all to
late) that God is rightuous, and that we shall continue so, spyte of our teeth.
So then seeing that experience shows that Gods works deserve all praise, what
is to be done? Shall we take upon us to inquire of all his doings too the
uttermost? let us shun that: and let us rather learn to honor him with all
humility, and in so doing too yield him the righteousness which he
deserves, and to confess that his wisdom, his justice, his goodness, and
his mightiness appear in such wise in all his works, as he must needs be
known to be such a one as he is, that is too wit, a most loving father
toward those that are his, and a just judge toward those whom he has
forsaken.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him so to touch us, as we may utterly condemn ourselves
before him, namely to the end we may be acquit through his mercy: and that
therwithall it may also please him to remedy all the vices that are in us, and
so too clenze us, as we may draw nearer and nearer to the heavenly life. And
forasmuch as we be so much inclined to pride and presumption, as we cannot
bow under him as were requisite: let us pray him to grant us the grace to
submit ourselves to him with all humility and fear, so as we may be fit too
receive instruction, both by his word, and by his holy spirit, to the intent
that in all points and all respects we may yield him his due honor, and he
guide us as obedient children under the government of their father. That it may
please him to grant this grace, etc.

The.Cxliij. Sermon, which is the fifth upon the.xxxvj. Chapter.
25 Men behold it, every man sees it a far off.

26 Behold, God is great, the number of his years is not known, there is no
counting of them.

27 For he restrayneth the drops of water, and afterward makes the rain
of his moisture to pour down.

28 He makes it to come from heaven, and it sheadeth dovvvne upon the
multitude of men.

29 Who can know the diversity of his Clovvdes, and what is the heap of
his Tent?

30 He stretches out his light, and covers the roots of the Sea.

31 By them does he execute justice upon the people, and give abundance
vvherevvith to live.

32 He clotheth his dry streams with the clovvdes, and commands them to
go against them.

33 His companion brings him tidings of strife, and there is anger in mounting
up.


We have too bear in mind the matter that was glaunced at yesterday: namely
how it is showed us here, that although men would shet their eyes, yet can
they not bring to pass that god should not set himself before them, and that
his works should not be known to them. Hereby we be warned that if any man
know not God, the same That men behold them a far off. For this similitude
imports, that they be so excellent, and that there is such a greatness and
majesty in them, that although there be a far distance between them and us,
yet are we able to see them. We know that if a man that men behold Gods
works a far of. How far off? So far, as our eye sight must needs be
utterly dazeled. But yet as far of as it is, we perceive how God works: and
therefore it follows that there is such a majesty in Gods works, as we
ought of duty to honor him therein. Now then let us mark, that such as
glorify not God as they should do, can not cloak themselves with ignorance:
for it is but a vain that because God is great, we know him not, neither is
there any numbering or accounting of his yea^es. This sentence should seem to
rep^gne that which I have said already: for to know and not to know, are
things utterly contrary. We saw in the last verse, that although God be far
off from us, yet notwithstanding his works are so great that we see them: and
now it is said, that God cannot be known. But by the knowing that is spoken
of here, it is meant that we cannot comprehend God in such wise as he is in his
majesty: we come far short of that: it is enough for us that we have some
little taste of it: we be not able to comprehend the infinite light that is in
him: it suffizeth that we have some little sparks thereof. Thus then ye see in
what wise God is not known: namely in that our capacity is too small to
conceive and comprehend him. Yet notwithstanding his meening is not to be
utterly hid from men: for he shows himself enough to be honored at their
hands. Therefore this knowledge which we have of God, is not to be able to
determine of him, and to say thoroughly what is in him: but yet nevertheless we
are inexcusable if we honor him not, for so much as he has showed himself in
such portion unto us, as he knows us able to bear, and as is for our
profit. Now we see after what manner we behold God, and how he may be known
of us: that is to wit, by looking at him as it were in a glass when he
claddeth himself with that visible majesty which is seen in heaven and
earth. Lo in what wize he ought to be looked upon. And for that cause it is
said, that the creatures are as his seat: those are his ornaments: and as a
Prince that appareleth himself in his royalty too have the more reverence:
even so Gods ornaments are in the heaven and in the earth: and there it is that
he must be looked upon. For as for his substance or being, that is invisible
and hidden from us. But he utters his virtues in such wise, that although
we were blind, yet might we grope them, according also as S. Paul uses the
same similitude in the 17. of the Acts. Seeing it is so, let us learn that we
do then see God, when we consider his works: for his mighty power appears
there, and shows us that he deserves well to be glorified at our hands.
But yet must we not presume to know him perfectly, so as we should be able to
define what his glory is: for that passes all our understanding: we must cast
down our eyes and confess that he dwells in vnapprochable light. Therefore
our knowing of God is but in part: and therewithal it behooves us to confess,
that we be so ignorant and weak, as it is enough for us to have some taste of
Gods majesty, and we must hold ourselves at that stay since we see that our
wits fail us, and that we be as good as forlorn. I say it behooves us to
hold ourselves within our own slenderness, praying God to rid us of this
mortal flesh, to the intent we may behold him as he is, when we be become like
unto him, as it is said in S. John: and furthermore that in waiting for that
day, he reform us presently after his own image, to the end we may behold
him the better. For thereafter as God cleanses us from all our fleshly vices,
and from all the heavy dross that we feel in ourselves: so makes he us
the meeter to behold him. And so upon the knowledge of the weakness of our
own wits, we have to pray unto God to reform us more and more, to the end
we may profit and increase in his knowledge. VVheras mention is made of the
numbering of his years: and whereas it is said, that they cannot be reckned:
truly a man may think it rude geere at the first blushe: for inasmuch as God
had no beginning, it needs not to be said of that euerlastingnesse, that
the years thereof cannot be reckned: and therefore that saying might seem
superfluous. But if that a man cannot reckon the number of Gods years.
Therefore whenever we would be judges over him, and are tempted with the said
presumptuousnesse and desire to mount higher than becomes the Rain,
thunders, and vapors, and such other like things, as Hayle, tempests, and
whirlewinds. When we see those things, God gives us such signs of his
majesty as we must needs honor him, or else we be too unthankful and
blockish. True it is that God has other works higher and harder too
comprehend than these: but the intent of the holy Ghost was, to teach us
grossly according to our rudeness and homeliness: and that God restrayneth
[or holds backe] the drops of water. And it serves too express better his
excellent power, which would not be believed if men saw it not with their
eyes. If a man should tell us that the drops of water were hild up, (that is
to say, that the water which is so fine and subtle a thing that it sheadeth and
soketh away and has no fastness in it, is nevertheless hild up in the air,
notwithstanding the great number of the drops, and the great quantity of
it:) we would think it strange, if we had not experience of it. If water were
a firm and substantial thing, there might well be some mountain of it for
God to hold together. that of his vapor he makes Rain. If a man demand
whereof rain is ingendered: I say, of nothing. The vapor of it own self
would not ryze up from the earth, which has her steames within her holes, for
that is her nature: but the ryzing up of it is by the drawing of the sun,
which sucketh up the moisture to hale it up on high. Otherwise what ropes
needed there that God has as it were his Pauilions [or Tents,] according as
we know how it has been declared heretofore, that the clouds and all the
cope of heaven are termed Gods Pauilions or Tents. And diverse times it is said
that the clouds are his chariotes, namely because he guides them and makes
them to go foreward, or else does as it were walk upon them to make his
triumphs. Thus ye see how God is presented unto us as a Prince, in that he
uses the heaven as his palace, and his majesty shows where the Clouds are
termed the pillars of Gods palace, and are said to hold up his Pauilion, or
else to be joined to it as a part of it. For it serves to show, that it is
enough for us to taste what Gods majesty is, so far forth as he utters
the same too us by his works. Eliu speaks also of the effects of Rain. He
says that God executes his judgments upon men and gives abundantly whereof
to live. VVherby he meeneth that God will (when he lists) make the rain to
serve to set forth his goodness: so that if he mind to show himself a
fosterfather toward men, the Clouds shall bring him wherewith to further
them. For like as if a Prince intend to succor a Country that suffers
famine, he will appoint men to bring victualles thither from a far off both
by land and by water: even so the Clouds bring us Gods provision, namely when
he utters his infinite goodness toward us. Contrariwise, when he purposes
to show his rigor, the Clouds execute his vengeance upon us, and he utters
his displeasure there. And why? For when raynes are outrageous they do great
harm, and make such floods that both Hay and Corn are swepte away. Moreover
there follow other wastings also, according as it is diverse times seen, that
the Sea drowneth a great Country. Ye see then how God does by rain
execute his justice, and also on the contrary part make us to feel his
goodness. And that is the cause why it is said, that he covers the roots
of the Sea. For when we behold the rain and the Clouds: at the first brunt
it touches us and makes us afraid, and it is meet also that we should be
stricken with some fear. But when God withholdeth the waters, so as they pour
not down upon the world, ^e swallowe us up here at the first dash: that
makes us to perceive Gods providence the better. Now then we see what Elius
intent was. And finally he says, that God willmingle darkness and light
together. For when the Sun shines, there comes now and then such a
sudden storm, as men are abashed at it: as in the Summer time the weather
shall be so calm and fair as can be devised and in the turning of a hand,
ye shall see such a tempest, as it shall seem that the world should go to
wrecke. And who does that. Must not he needs be an excellent master which
commands it? Must not that excellency of God be wonderful? Furthermore it
is said here, that God commands the Clouds too mount up, and again, he
commands the fire which is in the air, that is to say he commands the
steamings which being of fiery nature are whote and dry. God then commands
them to iustle against the Clouds that are about and thereupon follows a
battle, as if two armies incountered together with mortal anger. Even so is
it in the encounter that is between the Clouds, and the dry gleames that are
above. Then is there as it were an anger when these creatures meet, and each
of them as ye would say at deadly foade with other. And who does that? Needs
most God be the co^maunder of it. For if we should say it were done by
haphazard, we should be too brutishe, and the very babes might laugh us too
scorn: for there is no man but he knows that God further, it might be
demanded too what purpose Eliu alleges these things, seeing he reasons of
a far other matter: which is too show that God is incomprehensible in his
doings, and that men must not presume to strive against him, nor too mainteyne
their own quarelles as though they were rightful, and that God were cruel in
afflicting them. This seems to be nothing at all too the purpose. But I have
resolved this question already. Only I will say a word of it sle^ghtly, to
renew the remembrance of the thing that has bin spoken heretofore at length.
that God execute^^ his judgments, and gives men abundantly wherewith too
live. It is to the end we should know, that all the order of nature is in
Gods hand, and that the air is not governed by it self, nor the rain
comes at the appoyntement of the Sun. How then? For we see contrary
effects. Behold, water drowneth men and sweepeth them quite away: and again,
it mainteyneth them. Ye see here two contrary woorkings: nourishment on the
one side, and wasting on the other, so as God destroys and ouerwhelmeth all*
Both these twain we see: and what is the cause thereof, but that God
ouerruleth things from above. So then, let us learn too magnify God in this,
that we see him apply his creatures too such use as he thinks good.
Furthermore, when on the one side we see his rigor: seeing that he myndeth
too punish our sins, we ought too consider that therein he shows
himself a Judge, to the end we should condemn our selves before him, and
flee for refuge too his mercy, for so much as he utters the treasures of his
goodness, and shows himself liberal. Which thing he does at such time as
he declares himself to have a care of us by sending us provision by the
Clouds, whereby he makes the earth fruitful: to the end it should yield us
sustenance. When we see this on the other side: let us be satisfied with the
goodness of our God, too put our whole trust therein, and to rest thereupon,
concluding that sith he shows himself a father in the cherishing of our
bodies, which are but frail carkesses: much more reason it is that seeing he
has fashioned us anewe unto his own glory, we should not doubt but he is
charie of our salvation, and that he shows himself a father in that, more
than in all the rest. This is it that we have too mark in this streyne, where
we see that God as now applies his creatures to his own pleasure, using them
on the one side, as Rods to execute his justice, and on the otherside, making
them to serve our turn, even by employing them too relieve the necessities of
this present life. Therefore let us bear all these things in mind, that we
may be taught in his fear, both to rejoice and rest in his goodness, and
also too settle our trust wholly upon the same.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us perceive them better than we have done:
and that therewithal we may know that we must mislike of our selves still
more and more, to the end to correct the sinfulness that is in us: and that
forasmuch as it has pleased God to draw us already unto him, we may consider
the grace that he has begone in us, and thereupon take courage to go foreward
still more and more, till we be come to the perfection that he calls us
unto, and never be weary of traueling thitherward, and that in the mean
season we may have our eyes open to behold his goodness, power, justice, and
wisdom which he shows us: and he reform us wholly to his obedience, so as
we may seek nothing but to dedicate our whole life too his service. That it
may please him, etc.

The.Cxliiij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxxvij. Chapter.
ALso my heart trembles at it for fear, and it leapeth out of his place.

2 Harken to the noise of his voice, and to the sound of his mouth.

3 He directs it under the whole heavens, his light is upon the vvings of
the earth.

4 Again he brayeth with a great sound, he thundereth with his myghtie
voice, and he taryeth not after that his voice is heard.

5 God thundereth terribly with his voice, he does vvonderfull things, and
which a man cannot comprehend.

6 For he commands the snow too fall down upon the earth: and
[likevvise] the svveete shovvers, and the raynes of great force.


THis serves at leastwise, that while we be in this world we should have our
eyes open too consider the works of God that are near us and easy to be
seen, though we be no learned nor deepewitted folk. For even the veriest
that his heart leaped out of his place at it, and that he was afraid at the
sight of such things: as if he should say, that our knowing of God must not be
a gazing in the air after our own lyking, and in the mean while to conceive
but only some dead thoughts: but it must be a lively touching of our hearts,
and of all our powers to the quick. And this is general to all men. But the
unbelievers (do as much as they can) kill this fear wherewith they ought to
be touched, whereas the faithful make their profit of it, and willingly
provoke themselves too the said awfulnesse, too the end too do homage with
all reverence too the Majesty of God. Then let us bear in mind, that Gods
manifesting of himself unto men, is not only to put some fleeting conceyte
intoo them, so as they might say, There is a God, and fall too reasoning of
him: but also therewithal too give them a lively instruction inwardly, so as
they may become the better minded. This (say I) ought too be in all men.
Howebeeit we see that the unbelievers do (too the uttermost of their power)
beat back the fear which they have conceived, and labor too play with
God, and too get liberty too be quite and clean out of awe of him. Lo at
what point the faythlesse sort are, so as they fight against their own
natural understanding, and indeuer themselves too become brute beasts, that
there may not be ought in them to trouble them any more. And why do they so?
For God is against them, for so much as they be given too all evil. They see
that God cannot away with them, and therefore they shun him, and labor too
rid him quite away, like as an Outlaw or a Thief would feign that there
were no civil Magistrate in the world, to the end that his sins might
escape unpunished. In like case is it with all worldelings: forasmuch as they
cannot disbarre the hand of God, so long as he sits in his majesty too
judge: they would fain exempt themselves from his jurisdiction: and that is the
cause (as I said) why they labor to quench the light of reason which was given
the^. But they cannot bring it to pass: and therefore they are as Mules that
chawe upon their brydles, and fall too repyning against God, and howsoever
the world go with them, they grow hardhearted, and wexe every day more
blockishe than other, till God have given them quite over, so as they feel no
more remorse of mind, as Saint Pa(...) speaks of them. And surely it is the
extreemest of all miseries, and the very vpshotte of their decay, when they
feel no more grief, that is too say, when they have no more remorse of
conscience, but bear with themselves in sinning, and go on still in their
common trace, according also as Solomon says, that the wicked man is then
come too the gulf, and dungeon of that his heart trembled and leapt out of his
place. True it is, that the wicked shall be afraid of thunder and lightning,
and spite of their teeth the Majesty of God must touch hear Gods voice, yea
even a voice of great noise (says he) and a sound that proceeds out of
his mouth. Here Eliu speaks not of the word, which is daily preached unto
us, for us too take learning by it, and wherein God does familiarly show us
his goodness: but by Gods roaring voice, and by the noise that proceeds out
of his mouth, he meeneth the thunders that are made in the air: and there in
he declares by a similitude, that our Lord has a manner of speech which is
able too make all Creatures too quake. And not only in this place, but also in
the nine and twentieth psalm it is said, That the voice of God sweet and
gentle showers, and also of the boystuousnesse and violence that are seen
oftentimes in that behalf, as in pursuing that which he had touched already
concerning Gods judging of the world, sometime by sending rain from heaven,
and sometime by giving abundance of food. For if a sweet rain come in due
season, it will make the Earth frutfull: but [otherwise] the rain will mar
and destroy all the benefits whereby we look for sustena^ce. Therefore we
perceive both twain of these things in God: and that deserves well to be
considered. Also that is the cause why it is said, that God does wonderful
things which we comprehend not, by the thunders which he sends. For in
very deed, after it has so flashed, and that the Lightning has flowen
throughout, and the Thunderclappes have been heard: immediately there comes
a tempest, and God lets the rain, and the storm, and the hayle too pour
down without tariance: and whersoeuer the dint of the tempest lights, there
ensue incredible things. For ye shall see a man consumed too ashes. He shall
keep still his shape, and hardly shall ye find a hole so big as a pease,
and yet notwithstanding the man shall be quite consumed. A hard swoorde shall
be utterly molten, and the scabber that yields shall be whole still. Trees
shall be sometime rooted up, sometime wrung asunder, and sometime utterly
consumed, so as there shall be nothing left of them. As much is done too houses.
To be short, if a man consider all the effects of a tempest, they be things
that could not be believed, if they were not For our wits must not friske
and wanze away in the air, as though the thunder were ingendered there,
without the commandment of a superior master. Then let us come unto God,
and assure our selves that the thunder must needs be ingendered by the power
of his mouth. And when the air is so troubled, and all on a rore: let us
understand that the same is no dead thing, but the very order which God has
stablished, whereby his power is manifested unto us. Ye see then what we have
to remember. But if we can perceive that God moves men's hearts the wings of
the Earth, that is to say, over all the borders of the Earth, and the
Thunderclappes are heard from the one side of the world, to the other: ought
not God too be known in all things, and ought not both great and small to
do him homage? Yes verily. And wherefore then does the Prophet speak
specially of the Temple of God? It is according too the comparison that I have
touched: which is, That God affrighteth and wakeneth the Heathen men when he
thundereth: howbeeit, that is not to bring them too salvation, but only to
convince them utterly, too the end they should not pretend any tryfling
excuse that they knew not God nor his Majesty. They knew him sufficientely
too their utter condemning, but as for us, Gods intent is too draw us too
salvation when he speaks unto us. For there he thundereth not too make the
air rore, neither makes he confused noise, as I have said: but he speaks
gently and familiarly, he utters his heart unto us, he shows us which is
the way of life, and he inlightneth us with the brightness of his word which
shines upon us. Thus ye see why God deserves too be glorified in his Temple.
For although he be manifested too the whole world, and all creatures are
invited too praise him, yea and that they be constreyned and enforced
therevntoo: yet is there a far other more mighty and royal power in the
word that is preached unto us. For there God shows and utters himself in
such sort, as we must needs be worse than brutish and blockish, if we
think not upon him too submit our selves too all that is spoken too us in his
name and authority. Thus ye see what we have too bear in mind. And by the
way let us consider how malicious the world is, seeing that the word of God
(for all that it is so well preached and known,) is notwithstanding so ill
received of most men, and so little reverenced, insomuch that it should seem
that men are purposed too spite God in rejecting all doctrine, notwithstanding
that they know and are fully assured that it is of him. See ye not how
rebellious the Papists are that God does great and mighty things in
thundering, and in sending forth lightnings and tempests, and that we
comprehend it not: let us be sure that in speaking both by his law, and by
his Gospel, he intends to lift us up above all our understanding, as in
very deed we shall never profit in the doctrine of God, nor in his word
that is set forth unto us, if we have not this principle, that is to wit, that
God exercises us in secrets that surmount all our capacity: according as it
is said, that God has prepared such things for those that love him, as never
eye of man saw, nor ear of man heard, nor never entered intoo the heart of
any creature. Then if we have not that ground, we shall never taste the
things that are preached too us every day. Now too the intent we may taste
them well, what is to be done? Let us consider that our Lord calls us to his
heavenly kingdom, and is minded to draw us out of this world. Intend we then
to be good scholars, and to profit in the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ?
Since we see that we be plunged [ouer head and eares] in this world, and in
these corruptible things: let us labor too wade out, and let us from day to
day fight against our own affections, that we may draw near unto God, and be
made al one with our Lord Jesus Christ, according as Saint Paul shows us in
the third to the Collossians, that if we mind to have part in heaven, and
too cleave unto Jesus Christ, who is gone up aloft, and to be made one with
him: it behooves us too mortify whatsoever is of the earth. Furthermore, let
us consider that our wits are too rude and feeble too conceive what God is
in full perfection, insomuch that we shall never have any small taste of him,
except he guide us by his holy Spirit, according also as Saint Paul makes
the same conclusion in the foresaid text which I touched, where he cyteth the
saying of the Prophet Esaias. Therefore after he has said that the sensual
man comprehends not the secrets of God: he says we be renewed by the holy
Ghost, too the end we may have knowledge of them. True it is that we have
not been of counsel with God, according as he declares there again
afterward. But yet does he admit us counsel so far forth as is expedient
for us. Therefore when as we know our own infirmity, let us pray him too
inlighten us by his holy Spirit, that we may know the things which otherwise
would be to high and profounde for us.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of ours faults, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may be touched
with them, to condemn our selves for them, and to mislike of our selves: and
that in the mean while he will so work by his holy spirit, as we may be
renewed too obey him, and to walk in his fear: and that we may profit therein
more and more, until such time as being quite rid of all fleshly corruptions,
we be clothed again with his righteousness and heavenly glory. And so let us
all say, Almighty God our heavenly father, etc.

The.Cxlv. Sermon which is the second upon the.xxxvij. Chapter.
7 He seals the hands of all men, to the end to know the men of his
work.

8 The beasts shrink into their dens, and keep themselves within their
lodgings.

9 He makes the vvhirlevvinde too come out of a heap, and the cold comes
from the scattering vvinde.

10 At the breath of God the frost is given, and again abundant waters out
of a narrovve place

11 He makes the Clouds too labor too moysten, and sends rain, and
makes the Cloud too shed out through his light.

12 He makes the circles too turn about by his gouernanee, too the end to
do what he commands over the whole world.

13 VVhither it be for a scourge, or for his Earth, or of mercy that he takes
it away.


We saw yesterday, that the astonishment which men conceive of the thunder,
is as a proof of Gods majesty and power. According thereunto it is said
here, that God in does as it were set a seal upon men's hands, too keep
them close, namely, too the end too know the men of his making. And the
beasts also are feign too shrink intoo their dens. As if it were said,
that God draws men apart, as if some body should gather all his folk
together, a householder his householde meynie, a prince his subjects, or a
Captain his soldiers, too the intent to muster them. Thus ye see the
chief intent of this streyne. And the same extends even too the wild
Beasts, too show too the end too know the men of his making. It folloueth
therefore that God does then know men, when he holds them after that manner
as it were locked and shet up within their houses. Too the end that this may
be understood the better: when men have liberty to go and run, it seems
that they be as it were exempted from subjection. If it be fair weather, one
goes into Seal, as when men seal a Letter, too the end it should not be
looked intoo. Also a man may seal a Cofer, or a Cupboorde, by setting a Seal
upon it, when he will not have any body to look intoo it. God then uses a
dreadful kind of sealing, when he sends thunder and tempests. Here is no
printing of wax with a ring or other material Seal: but he compels men
too keep themselves as it were shet up, so as they be after a sort close
prisoners in their own house. It is not with their own good wits: and
therefore let them consider that there is a master above them, and that no
part of their whole life is in their own hand. Thus ye see how this
similitude is set down here, too the end we should compare the
incomprehensible majesty of God, with all the things that we can see among the
worldly creatures. And it is said immediately, that God makes the tempest to
come out of the beape of Clouds, and again, that it is the scattering wind,
or the Northwinde that causes the cold too come. These chaunges here do set
forth Gods mighty power the better, to the clouds and makes them labor too
relieve us if he intend too give us reasonable weather: I say when we see
such alteracions: then must we needs be worse than blockish if we think not
upon God. And undoubtedly (as I said before) he brings himself to our
rememberance, and shows himself after a more manifest and visible manner,
than if things should always keep that God by his government makes the
Circles too turn about: for I expound this as though it were said, that the
world is renewed when such alteracions happen. If there were but one season all
the year long: things would look always after one that God makes the
Circles (that is to say the world) to turn about, making them too change now
after one fashion, and now after another. And why? To the intent that if we
be not sufficiently taught by one mean, we should lift up our countenance
too heaven, and look round about us, that at leastwise by beholding the sodein
alteracions that are made, we might be provoked the more too know God, that
he might be glorified, according also as we have more occasion so to do. This
is it that we have to remember in this streyne. And now we see that the mo
means that God gives us too come too him, that we might be taught to fear
and honor him: so much the less can we excuse our unthankfulness, and so
much the more shall we be too blame if we cannot profit ourselves by them.
Therefore* there is another fair weather nor foul, heat nor cold, hayle nor
tempest, which shall not set it self against us at the judgment of God. They
shall bear witness against us, to discover and show the lewdness that is in
us, because we have not honored him that has showed himself so many ways,
and on all sides allured us to behold his majesty. And therefore as often as the
weather changes, although the alteracions be troublesome too us at the first
sigh(...) yet let us understand that they be for our welfare, for by that
means God wakeneth us, as I said before. The having of fair weather were
enough too besotte us, if there should be no change. But if rain come, then
we think with ourselves, very well, God can make a new world in the turning
of a hand, yea even without perishing of the substance of it at all: Howbeeit
the fashion of it shall be so defaced, as it shall seem to be new turkined.
Now then, when we consider this: we know that Gods using of such alteration
as we see, is for our welfare and salvation. Furthermore let us mark well the
fashyons of speech that are set down here. For if there be a great drought,
the sky seems to be of iron or brass, and after the same manner also does
the holy^ scripture speak of it. When God threateneth to punish men by taking
away the Rain, he says, I will give you an earth of iron, and a heaven of
brass: the earth shall be shet up so as she shall not open her breasts to
give you suck, and the heaven also shall be so hard, as it shall give you no
rain. Now if Rain come after a great drought: the same is the more
wonderful: for men would not have looked for such a change, if they had not
seen it come to pass. Therefore they marvel at it. But the woontednesse
dimmeth our eysight, and makes us not to esteem Gods miracles as we ought to
do. Nevertheless, when the wether is so soon changed and altered, and so
suddeinly darkened: the thing in it self shows a singular woorking of God.
Also it is said, that God makes the clouds to labor to moysten the earth*
namely as though they clyued asunder and emptied them selves, that the earth
might receive nourishment. Mark this labor whereunto God imployeth the clouds
for their service, in that he dreepeth down the rain from them, and afterward
when they have sucked up the moisture from beneathe, they yield over their
nourishment back again, and in the end wanze away and consume to nothing.
Therefore when we hear that God guides his creatures after that manner, to
employ them to our use, as if he should send us men that he chaceth away the
clouds with his bryghtnesse: it is yet one change more, which is wonderful
and ought to make us too perceive the hand of that he sends both clo^des
and whirlwindes: and all to do the things that he has ordained through the
whole world. As he should say, that it behooves us always to consider Gods
mighty power nor set otherwise than God has limited his pace and assigned his
course, in so much that he misseth not one twincling of an eye of it. As much
is to be said of all other creatures. As for us then which have speech, which
have ears to hear, which have understanding and reason: have we not
sufficient evidence to condemn us, if we apply not al those things to the
obeying of our God, seeing that the whole order of nature is naught else tha^ a
proof of the obedience which all creatures both above and beneath do yield unto
God? We (as has been said already) that through the universal world the
creatures do what so ever God has ordained. Now in effect we see here the
providence whither it be for his scourge, or for his earth, or for his mercy.
In saying so, he shows (as was touched yesterday) that it is not enough too
know that all things are under Gods hand, and that nothing is done but by his
will and disposing: but we must also mark the end of his purpose, and the
causes why he works so. But as now our wits are feeble, in so much that
although God chawe our meat to us, yet can we not digest whither it be for
a scourge, or for his earth, or for his mercy. Whereas it is said whither it
be for a scourge: thereby Eliu shows, that God chastizeth the world by
rain, heat, cold, tempests, and storms. These then are every one of them
Gods scourges, wherewith he smites us for our sins. Yet notwithstanding it
is not for us only that he has created the world: considering that he
pitieth the earth saying that it is his. Also men are not worthy that he
should use mercy toward them: Howbeit he myndeth too maynteyne the earth as
his own workemanshippe, handled, he is constreyned to use roughness. At
leastwise yet let us then bow under him, when we feel his rough strokes, in
striking us with hayle, rain, thunder, wind, frost, tempests, and drought.
Therefore when as we feel so smart blows, and the hand of God makes us to
quake, and that the same fear serves not to dismaye us, but too bring us
under his lure that we might crave forgiveness of our sins: let us learn
that we be worthy to be so beaten, and let us further understand: that we
shall not cease too provoke his vengeance more and for his earth: God has a
respect to him self when he destroys us not utterly. Do we then see that God
suffers us to live? Although it be with many adversities: yet do we see a
favor and forbearing in him. For needs should we be utterly wyped away at
the first brunt, if he should deal with us after our deserving. And therefore
let us mark that God does it for his earthes sake. Yea: for we be not worthy
to have it done for our sakes: and therefore he shetteth his eyes and
voutsafeth not to think upon so shameful creatures as we be. Ye see here a
disdeyne set forth unto us: that is to wit, that if God had none other
consideration than of us, he might rende up both heaven and earth to destroy
us. And this serves to bereave us of all our pride, and to make us so much the
more ashamed, to the end we might leave our flattering of ourselves: for we
see that me^ would fain hide their own

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him so to touch us to the quick, that we misliking
ourselves, may desire earnestly to be clenzed by his grace: and therwithall
that in as much as in all the order of nature he gives us so fair
lookingglasses of his glory, goodness and justice, we in beholding them, may
be ravished to walk in his fear, so as we may serve and honor him, and
yield ourselves wholly to his obeisance, to the end that he may lead us peasably
whither it pleases him. That it may, etc.

The Cxlvj. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xxxvij. Chapter.
14 Hear these things o Job: stay thy self, and consider the wonders of God.

15 Know thou how God has set them a law, and how he makes the
light to shine out of his clovvde?

16 Understand thou the scatterings of the clovvdes, and the miracles of him
that is perfect in knowledge?

17 How thy clothes are vvarme when he makes the Sovvthvvinde to blow?

18 VVart thou with him to stretch out the heaven, which is fast as a molten
glass?

19 Tell us what we shall say too him: for we can not order our matters
because of darkness.

20 If thou speak, who will report it too him? and ifany man tell it him,
shall he not be svvallovved up?

21 When the Sun is hid men see not his light: and again the vvinde
blovveth and brings cleerenesse.

22 Fair vveather comes from the North: and therefore God ought too be
exalted with praise.

23 He is mighty in his goodness: he is strong in power, in judgment, and
in justice: and he afflicts not.

24 Therefore do men fear him, and he will not regard any that are vvize
in their own conceyte.


IF we knew what is said here of the works of God, that is to wit, that
they be wonderful: there is none of us but he would take much more pain to
consider them, specially seeing our wits are so slender and frail. But what? we
think our selves so skillful, that even with one little cast of our eye we
have learned all that is too be known, and in the that all Gods works are
miracles: and on the other side he says it behooves us to stay upon them,
namely because our wit is to feeble to have any true knowledge of them out of
hand. Therefore we had need to bestow all our study thereupon. Furthermore
we be commanded too bea^ken: for except God speak unto us, as for us, we may
well apply al our wits to the considering of his works: but we shall never
come to the cheef point. Ye see then how we have three points to bear in
mind. The one concerns the excellency and majesty that is to be seen in
all Gods works, so as they be not to be despized. The second is, that for as
much as men are rude and gross witted, their looking upon the things that God
sets before them, must not be with casting their eyes aside at them with a
glaunce and away: but staying, it is not meant that we should be ydly
occupied in gazing about: for our musing upon God must not hinder our
serving of him nor our employing of our selves about the things that he has
appointed. It is clean contrariwyse: that is to wit, the more a man
considers Gods works, the more ought he to be stirred up to do his duty,
and the more ought he to be provoked and thrust foreward thereunto. Truly
they that stay in thinking upon Gods works, do but as it were go back to
leap the better. For the end of it is that we should not be wanderers as we
see men do, which run trotting up and down from place to place, and could
find in their hearts to remove the world with them when they be so let in
their enterprises. But what for that? They may well break their arms and
legs, and yet be never the further soreward, if they hold not the right way.
What is to be done then? Let us be guided by sober aduisednesse. And so let
us stay in such wise upon Gods works, as we may be restreyned from wandering
after that sort, and not become stragglers. Howbeeit therewithal let us also
apply our selves to that which God commands, and let that be our mark to
shoot at. Furthermore let us assure ourselves that of our own nature we have
another wit nor reason to give ear unto God: for it belongs to him to show
us what we ought to consider in his works, that we may fare the better by
them. True it is that the heathen men have disputed curiously of the secrets
of nature, and in a manner nothing has been hidden from them. Yea: but all
was but a musing upon the world, and not a coming unto God. And what else is
such wisdom than a confuzed dungeon? For what an unthankfulness is it, that
men should so curiously search out all Gods works, and not think upon the
maker of them, nor any whit regard him? Therefore cursed be the wisdom, which
buzieth it self about the curiouse searching out of the inferior or lower
causes, and in the mean while despyzeth the maker. Yet notwithstanding it is
certain that God gave understanding to those that treated so curiously of the
order of nature: howbeeit for as much as they heard not God speak, he had his
word to guide them aright: they missed Job can tell what commandment God
has given to all his creatures, he has set in the clouds, how he shedeth the
light through the^, and whether he know the order and disposition of the
clouds, and the woonders of him that is perfect in knowledge. When he says,
know thou how God did set a law to his creatures? there are here two things
to be noted: One is, that God not only has created his works once for a do:
but also that he governs them still, and applies them to such use as he
thinks good, according as I have declared these former days. Howbeit, for as
much as this saying is set down here new again: somewhat of them but in the
end they must needs conclude, That Gods wonderful works are to high for us.
Therefore he says, come on, can thou discuss me why thy clothes are warm
when God gives rest to the earth by the south wind? That is to say, in summer
when the wether is whot, and the Sun bears power, if the wind draw not
northward, but that the south wind reign: yet notwithstanding the wind is
none such as a man may perceive it. L^ke as in Summer time when the wether is
calm, true it is that the cool gales come peradventure from the south: that
God makes the earth to be quiet by the Southwinde. Can thou at such times
so much as judge why the sweat issues out of thy body? Thou see thy
clothes wet with it. And besides that, thy clothes shall burn thee if the
Sun have shone so long upon them as to heat them through, so as they shall not
be able to fence wart thou with God (says he) when he did spread out the
heaven? We see this work as a mirror of molten glass. Lo what a marvelous
molten work this spreading out of the heaven is. Art thou able to comprehend
the inestimable power of god which shows it self in all these things? Now we
have in effect to gather upon these sayings, that although there be some
natural causes of heat and cold: yet does it not follow that we understand
what is in them. Specially where as the southwind bears sway in as it were a
molten lokingglasse, and yet notwithstanding the scope of them is infinite: and
therefore needs must the workemaister of them be wonderful. Lo how we ought to
put this lesson in ure. Now it is said immediately, Tell us what we shall say to
him: for we can not order our matters because of darkness. Here Eliu mocketh
Job: but in the mean while the doctrine touches us all, which is, that he
which will presume to take hold to talk with God, and to reply against him,
must tell us how we should speak unto God, and what we may allege to him, to the
end we may show him that there is some fault to be found in him, and in his
works. It is all one then as if the holy Ghost should say, go to, there is none
of you all but he is so selfwise as he will take upon him to pick some quarrel
to Gods works. And soothly if we consider the overboldness that is in all men,
we shall see that God can not content us, and that if it were in our power,
every of us would put too his piece, and have a snatch at him, [saying:] Why
is not such a thing done? And this or this were good. To be short, there
would be a terrible hotchpotch, if God should harken to our wishes and follow
them. And whereof comes that? Of devilish pride, for that we will needs be
wise in finding fault with Gods doings. But Behold here how the holy Ghost
scorneth such presumptuousnesse, and says: Seeing that every of you takes
upon him to be so great crafts masters: ^ell us how we shall speak unto God.
If ye come to him and say, go to, I will have such a thing done: ye must show
him some reason why. And what reason can ye bring unto God? This is told us of
set purpose, because men entangle them selves in their own fantastical
imaginacions, when they be disconte^ted with God and his works. And I beseech
you, who gives us such leave to missebehaue ourselves against God, and to
reply this and that, but only for that we regard not his majesty? for had we
any regard of that: it is certain that we would quake for fear. So then it is
not for naught that the holy Ghost brings us to speaking with God, as if
Tell us what we may say unto God. And whereas it is said, we cannot order our
matters because of darkness: therein the ignorantnesse of men is the better
expressed unto us. For here we be as it were wrapped in darkness, so as we
see If I speak, who shall report it unto him? shall not be be swallowed up
that dares utter one word? Here Eliu expresses yet better the thing that I
have touched before: that is to wit, that all the unadvised words which we
shoot forth concerning God, and all the wanderingimaginations which we
conceive in our brains, are as it were grudgings that are made in
huckermucker. And thereunto tends the similitude which I alleged of a
cowarde that durst not stir one finger, and yet notwithstanding falls to
moyling against those to whom God has given more discretion, and seeks to be
wise by backbyting of other men. Even so deal we to Godward. For there is none
of us but he has to much boldness and skill to reply against gods doings: but
yet for all that we do but brabble: and as for him he voutsafeth not to hear
our words. So then, Eliu shows here, that men shall gain nothing by settling
the^ selves after that manner against God. And why? Who is he that shall report
it to him? This is as if some beggar should speak of a great King and say, O*
it were meet that the King should be better aduized than to do this or that.
For it might be answered, my freende, you must then get some messenger, too
go give aduertizemente of this which you speak, for seeing that the King
has not advice and wisdom enough except you be of his counsel: you were
best to go to him to give him your advice, or else to find out some messanger
too send him your counsel by. If a poor beggar should speak who shall report
it to him? we debate matters here by low: and yet in the mean while we be
but frogs. The frogs can make a great crooking well enough in their
marshes and puddles: and yet men pass by them and stay not for all their
crooking. Even so is it with all the talk that men hold: for there is no
reason in who shall report it to him? True it is that God hereth it, and
nothing escapes him: but yet for all that, he voutsafeth not to stoop to our
bibblebabble, as though we were his matches. Tush we be but frogs, as I
said before. To be short, this serves to show us, that we shall never get the
upper hand in pleading against God: and moreover If any man speak (says he)
shall be not be swallowed up? He shows us here, what confusion is prepared
for all such as dare so set themselves against God, and would feign find fault
with his works. What shall they gain then in the end. They shall all be
swallowed up. We see that all creatures must needs tremble at God majesty.
And what shall be done then when there is manifest rebellion? God can with one
frown make the mountains and rocks to melt, empty the sea, and destroy the
whole world, if he list. And surely there is no rebellion another in the earth
nor in the water, nor in any of all the rest of such creatures. But behold,
man who is but a handful of dust, will needs wage battle against his maker:
and I pray you, can he hold out? All the world should perish as soon as it came
under Gods hand: and behold a worm, a wretched carrion will put God to silence.
And not only so: but he will also rob God of his honor, and not have him too
be counted wise and ryghtuouse as he is worthy. Alas, must we not needs be
worsse than blind when we come rushing with such boldness against him?
Therefore let us mark well (according to that which I have touched) that when
we set up our bristles after that sort against God: we seek but our own
destruction, and too be quyte swallowed up. Will we then be mainteyned under
the hand and keeping of our God? Let us learn to humble ourselves to him, and
to pray him to show him self too us, and according as it shall have pleased
him too show himself, so also to grant us the grace too walk in continual
modesty, and to have our eye always upon this mark, namely that he
deserves to be honored at our hand, and that we acknowledging our selves to
owe him such reverence, may learn too submit us wholly unto him. Thus ye
see how we may approach unto our God without fear of the fire of his terrible
wrath. Nay rather let us be sure that he will be as a refreshing unto us, so
as we shall be mainteyned by his grace, condicionally that we come too him
with all humility, without preacing over far too inquire of him and his
secrets. Therefore we must content our selves with that which he shows us
by his word, assuring our selves that it is for him to reach us his hand, and
for us to go as he guydeth us.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them continually more and more: And
that for as much as it pleases him to grant us so great abundance of
worldly benefits, as to have applied and ordained all his creatures to our
use: we by receiving such bountifulness at his hand, may learn to know
him for our father, assuring our selves that seeing he has a care of our
bodies in this world, he will not fail us in the things that concern the
spiritual life of our souls: and that although in this world we be tangled
in many affections which comber our wits, so as they be not at liberty too
consider Gods works accordingly: yet we may not therefore cease too take
courage to muze upon them: and that in the mean season he guide us in such
wise by his holy spirit, as we may learn to like well of all his doings,
and to glorify him in his justice, truth, and goodness, and in all his other
virtues which he shows us daily in his works. That it may please him, etc.

The.Cxlvij. Sermon, which is the first upon the.xxxviij. Chapter.
THe Lord answering Job out of a vvhirlevvinde, said:

2 Who is he that darkeneth the secrets in words without knowledge?

3 Girde up thy loins like a valiant man: and tell me the thing that I shall
demand thee?

4 Where were thou when I laid the foundation of the earth? tell it, if
thou haste understanding.


We have seen heretofore, that Eliu by a whirlewind, to the end that being
therewith put in fear, he should yield himself to the acknowledging of his
fault, and wholly obey whatsoever should be said to him. And so we see that
God applies himself to us after all fashions, to the intent to win us. For
that the Lord spoke unto Job out of a whirlewinde. It was not enough for him
to have given some token of his presence, but he did also raise as it were a
vehement tempest. We shall find in the Scripture, that sometimes God raised
thunder after the same sort, when he listed too speak to his faithful ones.
But we have specially to mark here, the circumstance of the place, that
for so much as Job was not sufficiently tamed: God was saine to show a terrible
force to him. The cause then why he thundered and raised this whirlewinde, was
that Job should know with what a Lord he had to deal. In general, it is
commonly said, that God dwells as it were in a dark cloud, or rather that he
is compassed about with light: and therefore that we cannot come at him,
insomuch that if we would look upon God, our senses dazzle by reason of the
thick darkness between him and us. This then is very well spoken in
general of the glory of God, to the end we should not presume to be over
inquisitiue of his incomprehensible determinations, but taste so far of them
as it pleases him to discover them unto us, and therewithal consider that all
our senses fail us if he vouchsafe not to come to us, or else to lift us up to
him, and yet nevertheless, that for another respect, (that is to wit, because
of our sturdinesse) God must be feign to show himself terrible to us. True it
is that he would feign draw us to him by gentleness, and we see that when men
be well disposed to submit themselves unto him, he uses the said loving manner
of inuiting them unto him as gently as may be. But when he perceives any
sturdinesse, he must needs first of all make us to stoop, for otherwise what
should he win by speaking too us? And that is the cause why in publishing his
law, he rayzed thunders, blew trumpets in the air, and made all to shake,
insomuch that the people were so afraid, as they said, let not the Lord
speak unto us, for then are we but dead, we be utterly undone. Why did God
shake the earth after that manner? and why did his voice rore with such
terriblenesse? Meant he too drive away his people that they should not hear
him? the Gospel, nor never been touched rightly at the heart to obey God, if
he had not sent them some token that he was minded to chastise them. Heerevpon
when they felt once by afflictions, that there is nothing but wretchedness in
this world: they were enforced to mislike of themselves, and to cut off their
pleasures wherein they had bin plunged heretofore. Ye see then how God draws
men to him after diverse sorts. But let us profit our selves by the means
that he uses toward us, and again, when he speaks not to us in a
whirlwinde, let us on our side be who is he that darkneth the secrets in
words without knowledge? Gird up thy loins like a valiant man, and answer me
to all my demaundes. In the first place here God mocketh at Job, because he had
striued with him, and borne himself in hand that he could mend his case by his
disputing. And that is the cause why it is said, who art thou? Now when the
scripture shows us who or what we be: it is to make us utterly nothing. True
it is that men will make great account of themselves, and bear themselves in
hand that there is some great worthiness in them. And well may they esteem
highly of themselves, but God in the meanewhile knows that there is nothing
in them but al what art thou? Thou art but a man. The pronouncing of this is as
it were an utter bereeuing of us of all occasion of boasting. For we know
there is not so much as one drop of goodness in us: and then have we no more
cause to vaunt our selves in any manner wise. That is the cause also why god
adds, Girde up thy loins like a valiant man: that is to say, Set as much
store by thyself as thou listest, bear thy self in hand that thou art as a
Giant, be thou furnished thoroughly, and be thou armed from top too toe, and
what shall thou gain by it in the end? Think thou too stand, if I set
myself against thee thou wretched creature? What have thou? Here we see what
Gods meening is. For (as I said before) this foolishness of self estimation,
and of selfeweening that we be of some value, is so rooted in us: that it is
very hard to bring us to a right understanding of who is this? Let us not take
it too be meant only of the person of Job, but of all mortal creatures, as
if our Lord should say, How now? Is there such malapertnesse in man that is
but a pot ^ of brittle earth, in man that is but a vessel full of all filth and
naughtiness, and in man that is less than nothing? is there such
malapertnesse in him as to dispute against me, and to be so inquisitiue before
hand? whether were that to go? Who art thou o man? According also as we see
that Saint Paul sets the same word as a stop in our way, saying: Who
art thou o man which reasonest with God, and pleadest against him? And this he
sets down after he has alleged the objections wherein men think
themselves to have a fair color to dispute against God, and to demand why
he should destroy those whom he has created, and why he should put a
difference between one and another without knowing any cause, so as the one
should be called to salvation, and the other be rejected. After that Saint
Paul^ ^athe set down those things: although men take pleasure in such
objections: yet he says, O man, who art thou that set thy self after that
fashion against God? And this is it which we have to mark upon this saying,
who is this? Therefore whenever any man is tempted to pride, let him think
with himself, Alas, who art thou? Here is no entering into battle against
such as our selves are, and against our matches: but if we will needs be so
bold as to be inquisitiue of Gods secrets, and to let our fancies and tongues
looce to imagine unprofitable things, or to talk against God and his honor:
we must be feign to think, Alas, who am I? when every of us shall have
entered into himself, and considered his own feebleness, and perceived that
in effect we be nothing: we shall be cooled well enough, all this
prittleprattle, and all our former conceytes will be laid a water: yea and all
our imaginations will be brideled and imprizoned, as shall be declared yet more
fully hereafter. Now it is said expressly, Gird up thy loins like a valiant
man: too do us to wit, that when the whole world has laid their force
together, and uttered the same, all is nothing. Ye see here how God spiteth or
defyeth Job in bidding him to furnish himself, and to come armed and weaponed
as a Giant, or as the valiantest man that could be found. Hereby he expresses
yet better the thing that I have said already: that is to wit, that the
condemning of men in the scripture, is not meant simply of the common sort, and
of such as are despised and out of credit and estimation: but extends even
to the greatest, and to such as think they touch the clouds with their heads.
So then although men imagine themselves too have some apparaunce of honor: let
them assure themselves that the same is nothing before God. As for example,
They that are excellent in comparison of their neighbors, will surely conceive
some opinion and well lyking of themselves: if a man be counted skillful, of
good wit, and of good behavior, he will set much by him self in respect of
those that have not the same qualities: finally if a man be endued with great
and commendable valiant man imports, It does us too wit, that what special
power or virtues soever we have, the same must not puff us up with pride
against God. Furthermore it is said also, that Job wrappeth (or darkneth)
secrets in words without knowledge. Hereby God shows that when we have to
deal with his secrets, we must bethink our selves well, that we may proceed
soberly and secrets, God intended to signify the high things whereof Job had
spoken. We may well dispute of many petie trifles, yea and discourse of them
at randon: and in so doing our talk shall be but vain and fond, but yet shall
there not be any blasphemy there in, neither shall Gods name be unhallowed.
But when we enter into the doctrine of salvation, and into Gods works, and fall
to disputing of his providence and will: the^ must we not go to it so
unadvisedly, for we do but wrap up or entangle secrets in unskillful words.
We see secret meeneth. Also there are drunkards among us which could find in
their hearts to subdue God to their fantastical mind. Though they were the
wisest men in the world, and the best seen in the holy scripture: yet should
they be feign to come too this point. That Gods secret determination is above
us. But they be utterly dull and brutish, there is neither skill nor reason in
them, the wine ouermaystreth them like swine: and yet they will needs play
the divines, and control things in such wise, that if a man should now
adays believe them, he should be driven to frame and forge a new Gospel.
And therefore let us remember how it is showed us here, that when we talk of
God, we must not take liberty too plead and babble as we our selves think
good: but consider that he has reveled his secrets unto us in the holy
Scripture, and that both great and small must submit themselves therevntoo
too honor them. And that is the cause why here is mention made of words
without knowledge. Now then God shows us here, that whenever we speak
of him, and of his works, it is a matter of secrecy, a high matter. On the
other side, what is it that we can bring forth? what is that little which we
can conceive in our understanding? It is but words without knowledge. Let men
put themselves into the balance, and they shall be found lighter than vanity
it self, as it is said in the Psalm. So much the more then behooves it us
too mark this doctrine, that there is neither skill nor aptness in us to
treat of Gods works, except he teach us. The way for us too become wise, is
to be governed by the spirit and word of God. And therefore when we find not
the thing in Gods word, which we desire to know: let us understand that it
behooves us to abide ignorant of it, and thereupon too keep our mouths shet.
For whenever we go about to speak, there shall be no knowledge nor any thing
but untruth in us. This then is the accusation that God sets Answer me to
all my demaundes. At leastwise, if thou have understanding, make me also to
understand that which I would know of thee. Here God proceeds in mocking
the foolish ouerweening of men, in that they ween themselves to be so fine
witted, that they are able to dispute and plead against him. Therefore he
says, Very well, no doubt but you be very able men (to your own seeming,)
when you speak and I let you raunge [at your will.] But I also must have my
turn too speak too you: and reply you upon

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may return too
him with true repentance, and he thereupon vouchsafe so to reform our whole
life, as our whole seeking may be too submit our selves to his holy
commandments. And so let us all say, Almighty God heavenly father, we
acknowledge and confess. etc.

The.Cxlviij. Sermon which is the second upon the.xxxviij. Chapter.
4 VVherevvast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? shevve me, if
thou have understanding.

5 Who has laid the measures thereof? can thou tell? or who has set the
compass upon it?

6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof stayed? or who is he that has
laid the cornerstone thereof.

7 When the Stars of the morning rejoiced together, and all the children of
God soong in triumph?

8 Who has shettevp the Sea within doors, which in emptying it self
comes forth as out of a womb?

9 When I made the clovvdes as the garment thereof, and the darkness as the
svvadling bands thereof:

10 I have stablished mine ordinance upon it, I have shet it up within bars
and doors.

11 And I said, hither shall thou come and not pass any further, and here
shall thou stay the lifting up of thy waves.


WE grant well enough all that is rehearsed here concerning Gods works as we
see them both in heaven and where Job was when be laid the foundation of the
earth: as if he should come on, let me see if thou have understanding? who bath
laid the measures of the earth? Tellmee if* thou know him. Or who has set
the compass upon the same, to make it to be so well proportioned? who has
settled the earth upon her corners, and whereupon is it stayde? Job, tell me all
these things, says God. Truly when we behold the greatness and
weightinesse much labor and time about it. But it is not so with God: for we
see that he did quickly finish all his goodly workmanship that is seen in
heaven and earth. To be short, we see here that God mocketh men's pride, in
that they presume to control his works. If I spoke but of some mean work too
such as are cunning in masonrie and in carpenters craft, and should say to
them, it were better for you to do thus or thus, so as I would play the
maystermason, and yet have no skill in the matter: should not the
maistermasons and carpenters have just cause too laugh the line and the
compass. As if he should say how now? If I were a mortal and corruptible
creature, yet would men in beholding my works do me the honor to say, Behold,
here is a very excellent and skillful workman, he is very cunning, his work
speaks for him. Yea if some handicraftes man (as I said before) had done some
mean piece of work, men would not be so bold as to find fault with it: or at
leastwise they would not do it which had Compasses and of measuring of the
earth: we see well that there needed a wonderful power and incomprehensible
wisdom for the setting of all these things in order. For the earth would
never have settled and stood still as it does if it were not in the middle of
the air, in such just measure and proportion, and in such conueniencie and
temperature, as nothing were amiss. Furthermore when we behold the great
and far distance not only between the earth and the clouds, but also
between that and the sky where the Stars and Planets are: should we not be
more abashed? And now when we consider the highness which we see in the sky
above the earth: what is the earth? As great a mass as it is, and as weighty
and houge as men see it to be: if we compare it to the greatness of the
heaven, must we not needs confess with the Philosophers that it is but a
little Ball? What proportionablenesse is there between the one and the other?
And yet nevertheless if we look but upon the Mountains that are on the
earth, we shall find even there whereat to marvel, and wherefore too
glorify the woorkemayster that made all. Again, when on the other side we
behold the steadiness of the earth, ought it not to rauishe us into
woonderment? Although we see great variety in it: yet That the stars sung
praises, and the children of God rejoiced in triumph, at the creating of the
world. By these words God betokens, that as soon as the stars were made,
it was a set song or melody to glorify him. Not that the stars sung, nor
that they be sensible creatures: but for so much as god did therein set out his
own greatness, goodness, power, and wisdom: it is all one as if he had
spoken loud and shirle. Do we then lift up our eyes to heaven? We must needs
hear the melody of the stars, according as they began to sing at the
creation of the world. And surely such melody ought of right too waken us,
and to stir us up to sing the Lords praises, and to glorify him: Yea though
we were stark deaf, yet ought we to give ear to so melodious songs, and to
receive them: for behold, even the Angels of heaven are provoked so to do.
But we be to blockish in that behalf, insomuch that when we lift up our eyes
to heauenwarde to behold the stars, we consider not too what purpose they
should serve us. Yet notwithstanding it behooves us too apply this text to
our instruction, to the end we may fare the better by it. Now then it is said
in the first part, that the stars began to sing from their first creation.
After what manner? As I have told you already, not with tongue, for they be
senseless and dumb creatures: but the goodness, power, and wisdom of God
which shine forth in the stars ought to serve us for as many songs. If the
air rung with shirle and clear voices, we ought not to be more stirred to
glorify our God, than when we see the wonderful order which he has set
before our eyes. Howbeeit to move us yet better to glorify him, it is said
that the Angels rejoiced at that sight, and at the hearing of such melody of
the speechless creatures, in so much as it made them for to triumph. Hereby
we ought to be moved to glorify our God, and such a joy shall be a right and
true joy, and a far other one than the joy of these mad worldelings and
unthrifts, which cannot be merry but in displeasing God. We see here a far
other gladness set before us, which is, that the Angels of heaven did as it
were leap for joy, when they saw the excellent course and wonderful order of
the heaven by gods appointment. They were then moved to such a rejoicing as is
mentioned here. Seeing that the Angels do guide us to the glorifying of God,
and to the singing of praises unto him: ought not we to be glad when we behold
the goodly order which is in the sky? Is not that the point whereunto we
ought to come as often as we lift up our eyes aloft: But what? we be far off
from putting the thing in ure which we be exhorted to here: for truly when
we hear any text of that doctrine, it slippeth away. Although we be warned
never so much that we ought to glorify God in looking up to heaven and
rejoicing at the light of the Sun: and although we be sufficiently put in
mind to do it: yet does it slip from us. But seeing that the cheef service
which god requires of men, is to be praised at their hands, and we make none
account of it, but (which worse is) do rob him of his honor, and disfeate
him of that which is his, in that we glorify him not as he deserves: surely
we shall pay deerly for it when it comes to the reckening. True Gods
children, to the end we should be the more persuaded to run too the
triumph that all Gods children rejoiced in triumph, when they saw the
stars of the morning rejoicing together. And it is purposely said All, to the
end we might know, that such as give not their minds earnestly to the
magnifying of God in his power which he utters in his works, shall be cut
off from his house, and are unworthy to be reckened in the number of his
children. Now let us pass further. Our Lord comes to the Sea. Who has
set bars (says he) to the Sea? who has shet it up within bars and
doors? Thou shall not pass any further, thus far shall thou come and no
more. When the sea swells, it seems that it should drown and swallow up
all: yet notwithstanding we see it is all the while as it were in prison, yea
and God holds it as a nource should hold a little babe* He has set the
clouds and mistes about the sea, as little swaddling bands, and as a garment to
cover it. The sea the^ seems to be as a little babe whom God weeldeth as he
lists. And herein also he continues the magnifying of his works, too
shewevs that such an excellency ought to suffice to make us walk in
humbleness, and not to be any more so bold as to set up our bristles against
him, according also as he speaks by his Prophet Jeremy: Fear ye not me
(says he) me which have set the bounds of the sea? He says this, because
the Sea is above us. True it is that the simple and ignorant perceive not that
the Sea ouerpeareth us, and that it is higher than the earth: but they suppoze
that the water is under the earth and far beneathe it. But it is clean
contrary. And when we be near the Sea, we see and perceive even by
eyesight, that it is higher than the earth. Now seeing that the sea is so
above us: whereof is it long that we be not swallowed up every minute of an
hour, seeing that the water mounteth far above our heads? And specially
when mention is made of the fludde that did once drown the whole earth, it is
said that God opened the springs and all the windows of heaven, and also that
he opened the deepes, so as the waters were not restreyned, but let looce. By
that dreadful judgment of the fludde, God showed us as in a mirror, the
thing that should be continually upon the earth, if he with hilde not the
waters by miracle. We see then that the sea should ouerwhelme all. And what
lets it? See ye not an open miracle? Are we not convicted too be worse
than churles, if this cause us not to worship God, and to fear him according
to his power, so as he may have all souerayntie over us, and we be utterly
beaten down? And if men presume to set up their bristles so against God: let
them but pick their quarrel to the sea, and see if they shall be heard above
it or no. And what else is the Sea with his great surges and hideous waves,
than a sign of the power of him that made it? Now if the waves of the Sea
astonish us: Alas, how much more terrible must the majesty of our God be to
us? When the Sea casts up his boylings with such hideousness as we see: we
tremble at it: and shall we not fear the maker of it? but rather bleare out
our tongues at him? What a dealing is that? Must it not needs be said that men
are stark mad? And that is the cause why God vpbraydeth men be his Prophet
Jeremy (according as I have alleged the text before,) saying: Fear ye not
me? me which have bounded the sea with sands for an everlasting ordinance?
But now let us come again to the words that are placed here. God says, that
he has bounded the Sea. And what are those bounds? Like as erewhile he made
mention of the compassing of the earth: so now he speaks of the Mistes serve
too restreyne the Sea, that it should not pass out of his bounds and
borders, like as Swadlingban^es are to keep in a young babe. The child would
feign pull out his arms and legs to make sport: but he is so hild in with
his swadlingclothes, as he is feign to tarry there like a Mystes to hold it
back: and thereby we see

Now let us fall down before the presence of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him too make us feel them better than we have done,
and specially to know what we be, how there is such frayltie in us, as we
fail in all points, and our wits are so rude and gross, as we cannot attain
to his glory, that thereby we may learn to be utterly cast down in
ourselves, and yet not cease too seek to be lifted up by faith in our good
God, namely so it be always with sobrenesse and modesty: and that we knowing
how much we be beholding and bound unto him for the number of benefits
which he bestows upon us daily, may be stirred up, yea and wholly inflamed to
yield him thanks, that by our example the poor ignorant and misbeleuing souls
may be drawn to one selfsame faith and knowledge of the truth, so as all men
may with one common accord, praise, magnify, and exalte him as he deserves:
And that for the bringing hereof to pass, it may please him too raise up true
and faithful ministers of his word, etc.

The.Cxlix. Sermon which is the third upon the.xxxviij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the. 8. 9. 10. and. 11. verses, and then upon
the Text that is added.

12 Have thou since they days commanded the break of the day? or have thou
appointed the light his place?

13 That it might take hold of the Corners of the earth, and that the wicked
might be shaken out by it?

14 It is transformed as clay vvhereon a mark is set, and they hold
themselves as a garment.

15 And the light shall be hidden from the wicked, and the arm that is lifted
up shall be broken.

16 Haste thou entered intoo the deep waters of the Sea? or have thou
searched the bottom of the depthes?

17 Are the gates of death known unto thee? or have thou seen the gates of
the shadovv of death?


THe thing that causes men to judge folishly of Gods works, is that they make
too much haste, and tarry not for the end, that they might know how God has
provided for all things. And so all that God has given the Sea a law, to say
to it, thou shall go but thus far and no further, If the sea were ever calm,
and that there were never any storm or tempest: men should not so well perceive
Gods providence, and his fatherly care which he has of men to maintain them
where he has planted them. But when as the sea has leave to lift up it self
so high and mightily, and yet it cannot pass his bounds, but is restreyned by
this ordinance of God: thereby we may perceine that god has dispozed all things
in good measure and reason. Now this Have thou in all thy days commanded the
morning light? Have thou made it too know his place when it ought to come
forth? Here our Lord proceeds to mock at men's pride when they take upon
the^ to judge of him, saying how long is it since you were borne? Was there no
light nor day before you were? Seeing ye be so wise as to find fault with me,
it is as much to say as there was no order in the world before you were borne:
the morning light wist not whence to come, nor whither to go: without you there
had bin no orderlinesse: nothing had bin made, if you had not bin. Since ye
think your selves so wise, and will needs control me: I do but only ask you
whether you have at any time appointed from whence the light shall arise: and
[although ye never did it, nor can do it] yet you are still finding of sault
with my doings. As for me, I have always set the difference betwixt light and
darkness ever since the beginning of the world: I have Haste thou in all thy
days commanded the break of the day? For before we were created, God has
already set all things in order, yea and that so well, as it shall be to no
that the break of the day spreads abroad and lights upon all the wings
(that is to say, upon all the uttermost parts) of the earth. For in the Hebrew
tongue, the word wing signifies the borders or utmost parts of any thing.
Ye see then, that the light casts it self abroad, and spreads over all
the world as soon as it is in it. When we behold the darkness of the
night, we would say that there must needs be some great battle to chase
the same away. How so? Who is he that could rid the earth of darkness, so
as men might see euerywhere about them, whereas they were earste as good as
shette up in a dungeon? Who would think that the light should so prevail
that the wicked shall be shaken out of the earth. Some expound this, that the
Sun ingendreth many diseases, and therefore that when the day breaks, it is
as ye would say, a clensing of the world from wicked men, in as much as that
the earth takes as it were a new shape, and that the things which the earth
conteyneth, serve it for a garmente when the Sun shyneth after that manner.
For in the night season the earth is shapelesse, a man sees nothing of it. It
is then (as ye would say) a great Quamire, where nothing can be discerned.
But when the Sun begins to rise, it is as a man had taken pottes out of a
lump of earth, and made them and well trimmed them. Then is the earth
fashioned, which before was without fashion. Therefore when God sends the
light of the day, it is all one as if he fashioned the whole earth by giving
it beauty, to the end we should behold it with woondering: and so whereas
it was naked, shet up and barreyn before, (at leastwise as in respect of our
eyes:) he clotheth it again. For here the case concerns men's sight. The
earth in the night is as it were desert and waste, and there is nothing seen
upon it. But in the daytimes it is clothed again, because that which way
soever we turn our eyes, we see the goodly deckings that god has put upon
it, according as he says, that he crowns the year with his blessing:
insomuche that when he replenisheth the earth with fruits, it is all one as if
he did put on goodly garments, Crowns, Garlandes, and such other things
upon it. When we see that God works after that manner, have we not whereat to
be astonished, yea and cause to confess that the greatenesse of his works
surmounteth all our wits, and that we utterly fail of them? For although we
may in part taste of his goodness, power, that the earth takes a new shape
or fashion, and that the things which God has set upon it, are as garments
wherewith it is decked. And whereas this is done day by day: yet if common
custom inured us not that the wicked shall not enjoy the light, and that the
lofty arm shall be broken. This serves to prevent a question that might be
objected. How now, [might some man say?] Seeing that god has ordained their
light shall be taken from them. When he says their light, he shows that
for the present time we have no more advantage (to outward appearance) than
the despisers of God and the heathenish sort have. For they draw the air as
well as we they have the light as well as we, and they eat and drink as well
as we. Ye see then that it behooves us to bear patiently such mingling as
now. Nevertheless it is not without cause that God does here lend the
light unto the wicked. For it is too make them the more inexcusable, yea and
in very deed it is but such a light as shall not continue with them for ever.
But whereas we on our part do homage unto God, as well for our life as for all
the appurtenances thereof: it is for that we shall be heirs of the world as
his children: and not without cause does S. Paul in the fourth to the Romans
co^uey the same to Abraham, and to all the faithful. Therefore let us learn
that whenever the Sun shines, the same is a part of our inheritance: and
forasmuch as God has adopted us to be his children, the Sun is a detter
unto us, and we may reckon it as a part of our goods. As much is to be
thought of our eating and drinking, and of our inioying of all the things that
the earth brings forth. It is not due to us on Gods behalf, but it
proceeds of his mere liberality. But for so much as he has chozen us too be
his children, and we do with a pure heart claim him to be our father: the earth
owes us nourishment, and al creatures are in our hand, that is to say, we may
use them freely. And the same use of them shall continue to us for ever: not
that we shall have any need too eat or too drink, when we be once gone out
of this world: but my terming of the use of them to be continual or
everlasting, is for that it is blessed and blissful: and our present using
of Gods creatures is a help to further our salvation: for by that means god
makes us to feel his goodness and love. And when we be made partakers of the
heavenly glory, the world shall then be more ours than ever it was,
notwithstanding that we shall not have any need of meat, or of drink, or of
raiment. For yet shall we have a better and perfecter possession of it than we
have at this day. So then, not without cause does God add here, that the
light which the wicked have, and which they claim to themselves, shall be
taken from them. And that may serve us for a declaration of that which was
touched before, namely, that the wicked shall be shaken out by the breaking of
the day, that is to say, that they will disguise themselves, but our Lord
does then restreyne them, and that although there be some disorder, yet men
see some order intermedled with it, whereby the great troubles are assuaged,
which without that, were ynoughto destroy the whole world. Therefore if
nowadayes we see that the wicked may boast of their having of the light as
well as we, yea and (which worse is) that they have their full scope, and
that the poor children of God are trodden under foot, troubled and put to open
shame, and scarcely have wherewith to feed themselves slenderly: it behooves
us to bear it patiently. And why? For in the end the light shall be taken
from the wicked. It is said also, that the lofty arm shall be broken. By
the lofty arm, God betokens the power and credit which the wicked have in
the world, in as much as he gives them their full scope for the exercising of
his children: for it is for our behoof to be tamed. If we had the world at
will, we should no more know what it is to bear Gods yoke. therefore it
behooves us too pass through the troubles and disorders that are seen. Also
it is to try our faith: for had we a Paradise here in this world: where were
our hope? We could not be moved to seek the spiritual life. Yea and
although we be as miserable as may be: yet can we not perceive that there
Did thou ever atteyne to the drops of the Sea? The Hebrew word which God
uses here, betokens Tears, for it comes of a word that signifies to
weep or shed tears. And if a man translate it, unto the great deepes of
the Sea: the word will also very well agree with it. But by the way it
behooves us too mark the similitude: which is, that God meeneth that the
springs which are in the great deepes, are as Tears. Whence comes the
infinite abundance of water in the Sea, but of the drops that are there,
whereof flow the waters? Now the said abundance is as it were Tears. And
surely the welsprings are termed (as ye would say) the eyes of the earth. For
look as the eyes do shed forth tears in a man: so do the fountaynes ooze
out moisture in the earth. God therefore in this streyne uses that similitude
and says: Come on, did thou ever go down into the bottom of the Sea, to
search out the drops that it yields forth? That is to say, did thou ever
enter into the depes, to see the waters that sewe out there, and to know whence
the abundance comes which thou see, and whereat thou art abashed? And for
the better confirmation here of, he adds, Haste thou seen the gates of
Death? or have thou behilde the gates of the shadow of Death? Here and in the
things that he will add afterward concerning the great roomth or largeness
of the earth: he intends to show in effect, that our wits are to slender
and feeble, to co^prehende what is in the things that are most apparent and
near unto us: and that we must needs (spite of our teeth) confess that god
shows us such wonders, as serve too rauishe us above all our understanding.
Then if we be enforced to confess that there is such wisdom in God, yea even
in respect of his works which are open to us, and which he shows us as it
were with his finger: what shall we do in the things that are hidden, and
which he reserueth to himself till the last day? As when he suffers or
appoints many things to be done in the world, which seem strange and
secret to us, and wherein we perceive no reason, for they be [perchaunce] some
of his spiritual Secrets. What will we say to them? If we cannot
comprehend the things that are here as it were before our feet, and
whereupon we tread, I say if we can not fasten upon them: what shall we
say too the things that are above Heaven, and which surmounte all creatures,
and outreache the common order of nature? Lo in effect what Gods meening is.
But now let us learn when our wits are too eger in judging of things that
are not lawful for us, let us learn (I say) to think upon the Sea, and upon
the deep places of the waters, and say, Go too wretched wight, what intendest
thou too do? It is said that Gods Secrets are so deep a gulf, as a man can
never come too the bottom of them: and that those gulfes do far exceed the
gulfes of the Sea. Can thou but drayne a River, to see from whence the waters
spring? No, thou can not so much as conceive what the spring of a little
fountain is, whereoutof nevertheless there issues a great Brook. When
thou have bethought thee thoroughly, thou can not tell how too drayne out a
River or a Fountain: and how can thou then enter into the gulfes of the
sea, too spy out by inchmeale whence that abundance of water comes, which is
gathered together there? Now if thou comprehendest not a material thing: how
dare thou plead against God, and be so rash and full of presumption, as to
reply against the judge, and to go about to subdue him unto thee? Lo what we
have to mark upon this streyne. True it is that this doctrine seems to be
common among us: and there is no man but he understands it. But what for
that? Do we fare ever the better by it? [No no:] we see

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may think better
upon the wantes and corruptions of our nature than we have done, to the end
that we distrusting ourselves, and being utterly at our wits end, may run
unto him, and not desire any thing but that he will so govern us, as we may
be clenzed from all our vices, and so reformed after his image as all the
sinfulness of our nature may be beaten down and killed, to the end that we
feeling how his power has wrought so in us, may glory in nothing but in his
mere goodness. That it may please him to grant this grace not only to us,
but also to al people and nations of the earth, bringing back al poor
ignorant souls from the miserable bondage of error and darkness, to the
right, etc.

The Cl. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxxviij. Chapter.
18 Have thou considered the large places of the earth? tell if thou know all
this?

19 Which is the way where light dwells? and where is the place of
darkness?

20 That thou may receive it into his bounds, and understand the paths of
his house?

21 Have thou known before thou were borne, though thy days be many in
number?

22 Have thou entered into the treasures of the snow? Or have thou seen the
treasures of the Hail?

23 Which I have laid up for the time of adversity, and for the day of
war and battle?

24 By what way is the light parted? and is the East vvinde scattered upon
the earth?

25 Who is he that has divided the course of the Rain, and the way for
the lyghtning of the thunders?

26 To make it rain upon the land where no person is, and upon the
wilderness where is no man.

27 To fill the vvild and vvast places, and to make the budde of herbs to come
forth?

28 Who is the father of the rain? or who has begotten the drops of the
deavve?

29 Out of whose belly came the ice? and who has engendered the frost of the
heaven?

30 The waters are hidden as a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.

31 Can thou restreine the pleasantness of the Pleyades? or untie the bands
of Orion?

32 Can thou make the Mazzaroth to come forth in their time? or can thou
guide Arcturus with his Sons?


ALthough the matters that are rehearsed here do seem to be none other than
such as are commonly known already: yet if we look well too all things,
every man will deem it needeful that our ouerweening should be repressed, not
with a word or twain, but with long declaracions, such as God makes here.
For although we have granted that our wits are to weak to comprehend Gods
works: yet notwithstanding there needs but the turning of a of the earth, and
God demands whither a man be able to measure it or no. And there is a dubble
measuring of the earth. The one is too know of what largeness the world
that is inhabited is of: and this may after a sort be comprehended by
conjecture. Also there is the whole earth in it self in comprehending the same
part that is so covered with the sea as it is not seen: and it is impossible
too judge of the greatness of that. But put the case that men could determine
of every whit of it: yet notwithstanding when men had known such a miracle,
they of the way of light, and afterward of the thunder and lightnings,
according as mention was made of them before. And not without cause is this
matter repeated. For (as we saw yesterday) as soon as the break of the day
appears* the whole world is by and by lightened throughout, and the wings of
the Earth, that is to say, the uttermost parts of it are discovered, so as the
earth takes a new shape, and all this is done in one instant of time. Seeing
then that such a miracle appears before our eyes: is it not reason that God
should be gloryfied thereby? And if we will needs play the iolie fellows
here: do we not deserve to be punished for our ouerweening, and too be laughed
to scorn at Gods hand for this foolish lust of ours, which we have to
comprehend the things that are to high for us? By what path should the light
go? Is it in us to appoint it? If we would appoint it his way how far and
wide it should spread, how is it possible for us too go beyond the whole
mass of the earth, and too attain to the uttermost part of the world? What
a furious madness were it for us to presume to judge of Gods wonderful
works? Since we cannot conceive how it comes to pass that the light is so
soon spredde abroad, when it has once taken possession by the name of the
Sun, to reign over the day? So then let us learn to exalt God in such wise
in all his creatures, for the greatness and highness of his works: that we
on our side acknowledging our own slenderness, may be as it were brideled to
humble our selves before him. For, the way for men to honor God accordingly,
is by no mean(...) to glory in themselves, nor to take any thing upon them
above him. For if I magnify God never so much, and in the mean while, will
needs be as his companion: to what purpose is that? We cannot do God
greater wrong, than to compare our selves with him, or to desire to abace him
unto us, to say that he should be our mate and fellow. God then shall never
be duly honored of us, except we be first as it were brought to nothing,
and that we acknowledge that there is nothing in us but wretchedness. Lo what
we have further too bear in mind, when mention is made here of the way
which is hilde by the light, either when it sets, or when it ryseth too the
world. It is said afterward, That no man knows the treasures of the Snow
and the Hayle. It is not here only that God uses the same similitude of
treasures. For when he speaks of any of the chastizements which he sends
upon men, he says he has terrible sorts laid up in his treasures, which no
man knows of. And this similitude imports two things. The one is, a great
store (for a man will not say that a dozen of Frenchecrownes are a treasure,
but there must be a great mass or quantity of them:) and the other is, that
a treasure is hidden or laid up. Therefore when God speaks of the treasures
of snow and hayle, he means that there is a store of them so far passing the
understanding of man, as we must needs be astonished too think upon it:
and therewithal he betokens also that the cause thereof is hidden from us.
We see the Snow and the Hayle wellynough: but do we perceive any thing of
the making of the hayle and snow? Do we know how it comes too pass?
True it is, that the Philosophers can well dispute of it, and men shall see
some causes by them alleged: But yet is that a very small insight of the
wonderful order that God has set in nature: he has a secret priuitie by
himself which is further off from the reach of our capacity, so as we come
short of it. Now we perceive wherefore God speaks after that manner
Treasure, for the well applying thereof to our own use. Besides this, let us
call to mind how it is said in the song of Moses, That God has his
chastizements laid up in his treasuries, which we comprehend not: to the end
we step not out of square as we see men do, which oftentimes work spite
against God, bearing themselves in hand, that they be escaped Gods hand. For if
he have delivered them from any inconvenience: it seems to them that the
worst is past, and so they do but shake their ears, as the Proverb says.
Let us call too mind that God keeps the treasures to the time of adversity,
and to the day of encounter and battle. As who would say, they be his
artillery, his spears and his swords wherewith to fight against his enemies.
No doubt but God in using this similitude of encounter and battle, meant too
betoken that if we have any war with him, he is fenced and furnished
already after such a sort, as we must needs go by the worse: for we have
no strength nor power too stand against his hand* We may well put on
armor, and assemble all the aid of the world: but which of us can escape his
hand when he shall have set al his creatures in battle after that manner
against us, and commanded them too give charge upon us? And therefore let
us learn first of all, that Godneedeth not too borowe help, when he would be
auendged of his enemies: it is enough for him to determine it in his own
purpose, or too speak the word, or to show but his will: and immediately
both heaven and earth will bring him armies out of number. For since he
covers the earth a foot or twain thick with snow, is he not able to
ouerwhelme us when he lists? think we that his power is abated that he
cannot send snow thirty poles deep above our heads? Again, sometimes we
see the earth frozen, and the wind does so bind it as it becomes as hard
as iron: and what lets that God should not leave it always in the same
plight? Let us mark then, that God needs not to make any great preparation
to encounter his enemies, and to put them to the foil. Let him but only say
the word, and the whole world shall be on fire, and there is not that creature
which shall not serve to destroy men. Since we hear this, let us learn to
stoop under the mighty hand of our God, and not make war with so mighty a
Lord: for what shall we gain by it? Then let us learn to obey him: for either
we must be vphild by his hand, or else we must have it against us, there is no
mean between the^. True it is that God will bear with us for a time,
according as it is said that he wayteth for men as it were in covert: but yet
must we needs be under his protection, or else have him our enemy, and so
will it appear in the end. Therefore let us yield our selves unto him that
he may preserve us and we continue under his governance: and if he be the
keeper of our welfare, let us assure our selves that we be safe against
both hayle and all other storms and tempests. And why? For the hayle is not
ingendered of it self, another does the snow fall without his commandment:
they are both of them his treasures. When a man lists, he will lay forth
the things which he keeps locked up: and even so is it with all creatures,
for God sends them forth at his pleasure. Therefore we need not to fear
the hail nor the storms, so long as we be in Gods keeping: but contrarywize
we must needs be disquieted and vexed continually, if God be against us. And
herewithall let us mark how it is said, that he reserueth them to the day of
battle, and to the day of adversity. As if he should say, men need not to
vaunt themselves as they be wont to do, when God scourges them not: for
prosperity does so rock us asleep, as we bethink us not of our faults,
another enter into account with our selves, to know in what case we be to
Godward: but as long as we have any respit, we be like evil paymaysters and
unthrifts that wast away all. For he passes not for the owing of a hundred
crowns so long as he is not called upon nor his day of payment come: but he
makes good cheer so long as he has one penny in his purse. Even so play we
with God. If he give us any respite, we do nothing else but ruffle it out, and
we think no more upon him. Therefore according to that which is showed us
here, if God send another hayle nor thunder, nor skare us one way or other from
heaven: we must not thereupon run astray, nor fall asleep. And why? For he
can spy fit time too chastize us. Then let us prevent him, and not tarry
till that God will rain upon the wilderness where noman dwells, and that
the earth shall be so moystened as it shall yield fruit. VVherin this matter is
still continued, namely that God works after such a sort even in the common
order of nature, as we be abashed and our wits be dazeled at it. No doubt
but we shall see his doings, yea and conceive some reason of them: but yet
when we have cast our cards thoroughly, we shall always be driven too
conclude, that Gods wisdom is hidden from us, (I meene even in all these
manifest things) and that there is a cause above us whereunto we be not able
to reach. Therefore it behooves us always to come back too this point, to
comprehend thoroughly what is contained here. We see the rain fall, and we
know in effect that it is ingendered of vapors: but when we see that the
rain causes the earth to budde, yea and that the very wildernesses where
dwell no inhabiters wexe green also: we see a thing to wonder justly at. It
will trouble a man curstly to water a garden: and for all his travel and
labor he can bring nothing about, except God give influence from heaven. All
the waterings in the world will do no good, unless some rain or dew fall
from heaven. One of these has more workfulnesse in it, than all the waters
that can be brought by man's deuyce. Therefore when we see the deserts grow
green: therein God intends to show by assured tokens, the effectualnesse of
the rain which he sends. For in little Gardines men are continually
watering of them, and afterward comes the rain and the dew, so as things
grow there even apparently to sight. But look upon a waste ground which is
burnt up too day, and noman waters it, and the soil is dry of it self: and
yet notwithstanding God makes it to bring forth abundance of herbs and
grass, by means of his rain. Since we see such things: the more familiarly
that God shows himself to us, the iuster cause have we to glorify him: and
if we do it not, we cannot by any means excuse our selves of unthankfulness.
Is it not a great matter that we see Gods miracles with our eyes, (yea he
poynteth us to them with his fingar, and the thing is not seen only once in a
man's life, but it begins new again day by day): and yet notwithstanding
we think not rightly upon them? We tread upon the grass with our feet,
and yet we vouchsafe not to cast our eye thither to say, blissed be God that
makes the earth bear fruit after this sort. Furthermore let us therewithal
bethink us of our own rudeness and dullness: I cannot tell how one branch
of an herb springs forth: I see it with mine eye, but the cause of it is so
hidden from me as I am at my wits end. I see that when a grain of corn
rotteth [in the earth] it springs again, and brings forth a number of
graynes for the nurrishment of men. I see all these things: and are they not
all of them miracles of God? and yet for all that, I consider them not as I
ought to do. Surely a man would think at the first blushe, that this lesson
were superfluous, and that it were a needelesse thing to treat of the growing
of corn and grass. For does not every man see it* And are we not well enough
acquaynted with it? Yes truly: but yet for all that, who Come on, want thou
borne when I created the Planets, and the other Stars, and all the signs of
heaven? want thou there? Or art thou able to bid them go that they may go, or
can thou restreyne the pleasantness of the Pleyades, or can thou untie (or
vnknitte or loozen) the hands of O^ion? Here are certain of the celestial
signs named, wherein the Hebrews them selves do not agree: but yet
notwithstanding, a man may perceive that the first word which is set down
here, betokens certain stars that appear in the springtime, and bring a
sweet rain too open the earth and too make it yield fruit. For that cause it
is said, Can thou bind up or restreyne the pleasantness of the Pleyades
which cause the earth to become fresh and green? Can thou restreyne God
from sending men the pleasant spring time to glad them withal? Afterward he
speaks of Orion, which is a clean Arcturus, which is termed a keeper of the
things that can be shet up or restreyned, and of the vapors that are haled up
into the air. But it is not needful to stand much upon that point: it is
enough for us to know that it is a sign which betokens great tempests and
rage of waters. Therefore it is said, Art thou able to untie his bands? as who
would say, we bear no sway in the skies, in so much that we can not but be
ravished out of our wits to think upon which we shall then be, when we have
the [inward] witness that he has received us to mercy, and takes us for
his children. Furthermore, when so ever we think upon Gods works, let it be
with such soberness and modesty, as we may learn, not to be to inquisitiue
of Gods majesty, but to hold our selves contented to be taught according to
our measure and capacity. And there withal when he opens things to us by the
ordinary means of his word, let us open our eyes to consider them as we
ought to do, and yield our ears to him to harken what

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement
of our faults, praying him to make us feel them better than we have done,
and generally also to bewray our wantes, to the intent to deface us utterly and
to make us seek our whole welfare in him: and therewithal to apply us to his
service, that he may be exalted more and more among us, so as we on our
side may acknowledge him to be our God, and he on his side acknowledge us for
his people. And so let us all say, Almighty God our heavenly father, we
acknowledge and confess according to the truth, etc.

to them again.


Here the same matter is pursued still, that has been treated of these
former days: which is, that men comprehend not the whole order of nature,
but rather are convicted of their own unskillfulness, where that men know not
the way of heaven: that is too say, that they wot not what order should be
kept there, and yet notwithstanding that for as much as they see what God has
done, they ought to be amazed at so great wisdom as is showed there. If we
were put to the building of a heaven, at which side would we begin? Nay, if
it were but the making of the body of some one Star or Planet, could of the
things that are seen with our eyes, that is to say, to know the reason of them
and to refer them to a right end. Now it follows not by and by, that because
we have a thing in estimation, therefore we be able to do it ourselves. If we
look upon a singular piece of work, we shall be constreyned to commend him
that made it (I mean even among mortal men:) but yet does it not therefore
follow, that we can do it as well as he: but contrary wise the same welliking
of ours is a record that we understand nothing at all of it in comparison. And
now let us come unto who is he that shall restreyne [ or stay] the barrelles
of heaven? The clouds are so terrned, not only in this text, but also in the
Psalm, to make us understand Gods wonderful power in holding back a Tubbe or
a water pot. Ye see then that the clouds are as it were Gods vessels,
(how be it not made of wood or of earth:) and without any thing to The earth
should be always in one clodde, and men could not sow. Likewise on the
contrary part, if there should come no Rain at all, the Earth would be to
hard, so as it could yield no fruit, but would become like iron, so as men
could get nothing out of it. Now then it the lightening, or the Planetes, or
storms to have them in such wise at our commandment, as they should say,
lo here we he. We may well command the Sun and the Moon: but can we
cause them to make ever the more haste? Can we either hinder or further that
wet can not send forth the Planets, Thunders, and Lightenings. True it is
that Joshua did once stay the course of the Sun by saying, Sun, stand thou
still in thy place, and go not forewarde. But did he that by his own power?
Nay rather, God showed in the mouth of a mortal man, how mighty and
effectual his word is. Iosuaze words were but a sound that vanished away in
the air: but for as much as he spoke them by the authority of God, and
attempted not any thing upon his own head, the Sun could not but obey him.
Then if the Sun obeyed a mortal man's voice because it was the
commandment of God: is it not a much more mighty thing when God has in
his own Majesty, in his glory, and in his everlasting Being, spoken and
settled the course of the Sun and the Moon. and all the order of heaven?
Therefore if we mark well these words to our own profit, they will make us
exalt our God as he is worthy, and to submit our selves wholly unto him, and
to hold al our conceits and thoughts captive, to the end we take not upon us
more than is lawful for us. And surely it is too no purpose for us too start
out of our bounds against him: for it is said here, that the Planets and
(...) will not say here, I am. Ought they to be (...) commandment? When men
will needs take more upon them than is meet for them, when they will neades
work spite against him, yea and when they leap so far out of square as too
blaspheme him, can they change any thing in the order of nature? Can they make
the Sun, or the air, or any part of the world to stand in awe of them? Is
there any creature that will move for them? God therefore does mock at our
folly and pride in speaking after that manner. On the contrary part, we see
that the Sun and the Moon and the Stars do say unto him, lo here we be.
For without speaking they do whatsoever God appoynteth them. They have another
wit nor understanding: and yet for all that, they be led by a secret
inclination to execute gods will, and what so ever he bade them at the creation
of the world. Since we see this, ought we not to reverence the Majesty which
even the senseless creatures obey? Ye see then what we have to gather upon
this saying. Now it follows consequently, that it is not in us to hunt the
pray for the Lions, and too feed the Lions whelps their fill: nor to give
the Ravens whereon to feed and to nourishe their young ones when they cry unto
God. We know what manner of feeding the Lions and other wild beasts crave.
It is not a two or three morselles that will satisfy them, but they require
much sustenance because they be beasts that devour and swallowe up much. Now
who is he that can find them provision? True it is that a Prince may well
keep some Lions for his pleasure, or some other wild beasts: but what Prince
is able to find food and sustenaunce to all the Lions in the world? now
were there nothing else but this, that all the wild beasts (as we see) have
wherewith to sustain them, and specially of Gods provision: is it not a
sufficient miracle to stir us up too acknowledge the goodness of God? But
we shall see Gods meening in this text yet better if we have an eye to our
selves. What lets the Lions and other wild beasts to devour all the men
in the world? How happens That God feeds them, both them and their young
ones, when they cry unto him. True it is that the little birds have not
understanding to cry unto God, another have they speech to speak with, and much
less are they led in that case by true faith: but yet notwithstanding for as
much as they lack food, and have no means to sustain themselves in this
world: therefore it is said that they cry unto God, according as it is said in
the Psalm, where the self same manner of speech is used. And this saying ought
too be weyed well, for it is a great confirmation of the things that have bin
said: that is to wit, that if God feed the wild beasts which houle and cry
and bray without knowing that there is a maker which should nourish them: what
ought they to do which are sure that God who has set them in the world,
reserueth to him self the office of maynteyning them, and of giving them what
so ever they have need of? Think we that he will fail them? Again, let us
first of all mark what is meant by this word Cry, The Ravens birds do cry
unto God. Why so? Not for that they cry in faith or understanding, not for
that they pray as men are taught to do: but for that they cry for want of
means [to help themselves.] Behold then, the Ravens birds are a hungered, their
da^mes fly abroad to seek their pray, and sometimes they find none. In the
mean while their young ones are half starued, and no body provides for them.
Now is God feign to put to his helping hand, whether it be by giving them
worms to iobbe at, or by some other secret means. Thus ye see how the young
Ravens do cry unto God. The like may be said of all other beasts: namely
that when they be helpless, they resort unto God: not that they do it of any
understanding, but the case is such as they may well wander in the world, and
be still destitute of al succor, so as there is no shift but that God must
reach out his hand, and of his goodness give them the thing they have need
of. But now let us return to the foresaid comparison between ourselves and
the brute beasts. For seeing it is said that God shows himself [bountifull]
when the beasts are destitute of natural means to help themselves, and that
it is all one as if they repaired unto him: what ought we to do? For although
we have abundance even till we be ready to perbrake our goods up again: yet
must we always understand that the things which we have are given us of Gods
own hand: and if we happen to suffer penury and want, we be so much the more
provoked to repair unto him. Therefore men must not shrink back, nor chafe
upon the bridle when they find themselves destitute of help. What must they do
then? Let them think thus with themselves: behold God calls us to him. And
in good soth he declares and protests that his mind is (after a sort) to
provoke the beasts to repair unto him, and therein also to show himself to be
the [soueraine] gouerner: for otherwise he should leave nothing in the world,
but all should lie wast: how much more then ought I to repair unto him? Now
then let us mark well, that whenever we want provision, so as we wot not
where to become or which way to turn us: it is as much as if God told us that
it is his charge to give us know thou the time when the wild Goats or the
females of them do kidde? know thou the time of the Hyndes, or how they
bow themselves at their Caluingtyme? that they how themselves as though they
should cliue asunder, and strain themselves exceeding sore. True it is that
women also are said to streyne themselves: but the streyning of the Hyndes is
greater: in so much that they which have had skill of the secrets of nature,
say they are feign too use a medecin, which is the taking of a certain herb
to help themselves withal, and that otherwise they should stand at a stay, if
they took not somewhat too haste their delivery. We see then here how it
is not for naught, that God sends men too the Hyndes and Sheegoates (for
the kind is not altogether certain, but that is no matter of importance.) And
why? For it is a strange case that the beasts which know not what they bear,
should notwithstanding have the wit too bear out the burden and to fence
themselves against it, as though God had taught them, or that it were said unto
them, it behooves you to preserve your own kind and offpring. Seeing then that
the beasts have such an inclination, is it not God that works it from
above? For what would become of them if he governed them not? Again, when the
beasts come to be delivered, their brutishness is such, as it is no telling
of them that they must keep themselves quiet, and that they must have young
ones, and that they shall be glad of it, as it is said unto women that they
shall have whereof to rejoice when they see a manchilde borne into the world.
None of these things can be said too the beasts, for they know not what
shall pass out of their bodies, another can they tell whither the thing which
the Hinds and of the she rockegoates or other wild Goats: yet have we a
general lesson to gather of all beasts: namely that God must needs stretch
out his hand in guyding the said order when he intends too multiply living
creatures, and that by his guyding thereof they have offspring and increace, and
that without the some guyding, all things would come too horrible confuzion.
And specially since we know the said secrettes, how there are peculiar
difficulties in Hyndes over that there are in other beasts, as I said before,
and that that the caluing time of the Hyndes is not known unto men: that is to
say, that it is not in men to appoint it: let us understand that we must not
try maystries with God, in going about too wreste ourselves out of his
subjection. And why? For before we were borne, God has showed that our life
is not in our own hand, but at his order and disposition. It is well enough
known how long time Hyndes do go with calfe, and men may judge it by certain
conjecture. Not that men do look so narrowly to it: but if a man mark from
the time that the males and females go to rutte, he shall find that they go
full eight months. Very well, their caluingtime then may well be known. But
here it is said, know thou the Caluing time of the Hyndes? Yea: for that is
not to the purpose that God speaks: but yet has he so ordered it. It is not
for us to know how long the Hynds should go with calfe: that is to say, it is
not we that have appointed them either their months or their days. We be
skillful folk. Now then, seeing that God will have the Hyndes to go with calfe
full such a time, and that when the term is expi^ed, he delivers them,
giving the^ helps and guyding the matter as he himself has ordained: It
behooves us to conclude thereupon, that he has reserved the Lordship of all
beasts to himself, and that in as much as he fed them in their dammes
bellies, he holds them in subjection after they be come forth, so as he
guydeth them at his own pleasure. And when we have so thought upon the
beasts, let us come too our selves. I would feign start out to play the
suttleheaded fellow, in replying against God, saying: why does God deal thus
or thus with me? Why does he not send me mine own desires? But when we
enter into such murmurings to lift up our selves after that fashion against
God: let us come back to our birth and say, Alas how came thou out of thy
mothers womb? who took thee out of it? True it is that there were helps: but
yet must we come too that which is said in the two and twentieth Psalm, that
it was Gods hand which took us out of our mothers womb. All the women in the
world may beat their brains about it, but they can do nothing in that case,
except God work with them, even by a wonderful power. Therefore if we do no
more but think upon our birth, we must needs stroupe to say, Lord, before I
came into the world thou did well show that I was in thy guiding. For in
what case was I when thou tookest me out of my mothers womb, yea and of all
the while that thou did maynteyne me there? Were it not a passing
strange thing, if the shetting up of children there, were not an ordinary
*matter among us? We live by the air: and whenever we cannot take breath,
by and by we be choked out of hand* the life of man consists in his breath:
do but stop our breath, and we be dispatched immediately. True it is that the
little babes have some vent too take breath at in their mothers womb: but
whereby? even by the nauill. And in the mean while, wherewith is the child
sustained? with all manner of corruption: he lies there among all manner of
excrements, and all kind of wretchedness: in so much that if it be considered
how he is borne there by the space of eight months, and how he is
maynteyned: a man may see Gods mighty hand, yea and that so passingly, as we
must needs be amazed

Now letvs fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of our
sins, praying him to open our eyes, that we may learn to perceive how we
ought too be so beaten down in our wants and wretchedness, as we may be
clearly bereft of all pride, so as we attempt not too waunt our selves, nor
too chalendge any thing at all unto us, but that we acknowledging that there is
no goodness in us, and that we be altogether unprofitable, may resort to our
good God to receive power and strengh at his hand to follow his will, to the
end that in walking according too the same, we may be brought too yield him
praise and thanksgiving. And for the doing thereof, it may please him too tame
the pride that is in us, and which hinders us to praise him as he deserves,
to the end that being all of us made clean, we may return unto him with one
common accord, framing our selves pe^sably unto his word. That it may please
him to, etc.

The.Clij. Sermon which is the second upon the.xxxix. Chapter.
8 Who has set the vvild Ass at liberty, or who has loozed the bonds of
the vvild Ass?

9 It is I which have set his house in the wilderness, and his dwelling in
the salt places.

10 He laugheth the multitude of the City to skorne, he hears not the cry
of the Extorcioner.

11 He seeks out the mountains for his pasture, and searches after every
green thing?

12 Will the Unicorn serve thee? or will he tarry at thy crib?

13 Can thou tie the said Unicorn with his line, ( to labor) in the
furrovves? or will he break the cloddes of earth in the valleys after thee?

14 VVilt thou trust him because his strength is great, and yield up thy labor
unto him?

15 VVilt thou believe that he will bring homethy corn, and gather it
together into thy barn?

16 Have thou given the Peacocks their goodly wings, or feathers to the
Storck and the Estrich,

17 Which leaves her eggs on the earth, and makes them vvhot in the dust:

18 And forgets that the foot may tread upon them, or that the beast of
the field may break them?

19 She shows her self cruel toward her young ones, as though they were
not hirs, or as though her laboring were in vain, without any fear.

20 For God has deprived her of wisdom, and not given her understanding.

21 When time is, she mounteth on high, and skorneth the horse and his rider.


IF we had no more but some one only kind of thing to look upon in the whole
world: yet ought the same to suffyze to make us too give glory unto God. For
there is not anythi^g wherein he shows not himself such a one toward us, as
we be compelled too honor him. But God perceiving men to be still too
negligent and slow in knowing him, purposed too stir them up with such
variety, as they should no more excuze themselves of their not knowing wild
and untamed Asses, God says it is not for us to give them liberty. It is all
one as if he said, that when we behold the wild Asses, we must think that if
all Unicorns, or some other such kind of beast: how be it men commonly agree
that it is the Unicorn which is spoken that the Unicorns will not be in
subjection too us, and that we cannot occupy them as we do Oxen and Horses
and Asses: nor by any means tame them, that they might till the ground, or
draw home our corn into the ^^^ne, or unto the threshingfloore. Since it is
so, let us understand that it is not for us too ouerrule Gods works: we may
well streyne our selves to it, but we shall never bring it to pass. For if we
cannot tame a wild Ass or some other wood beast: how shall we rule the whole
world? And if we cannot do that: how dare we lift up our neb against
Peacocks and Estridges, or else (as some have understood it) of Storkes.
Howbeeit although the Storkes are spoken of in the second place: yet
notwithstanding, the things that are added in the end, cannot agree but to the
Estridges, that is to wit, that they despise the horse and the ^^^seman by
reason of their swistnesse: and again that they forget their eggs, and are so
foolish that they lay them in the San^e and think no more of them. There is
then a the wild Asses are spoken of: it is said that God vntie^^ them and
sets them at liberty, and that they go to seek feeding in the mountains,
and that they dwell in wildernesses and salt places: and that therewithal they
skorne such as are in Cities and are subject to tallages, imposts, and such
other charges. The wild Asses know not what any of these things mean: for
they have a free state. Now when God speaks after that manner, it is to rebuke
men for setting by themselves, and for forgetting their own state. For most
men are underlings, and yet we see how they brag themselves, so as it seems
to them that the earth is not worthy to bear them. And whereof comes such
ouerweening? For if they compare themselves with the wild Asses, they shall
find that the Asses have a more desirable thing than they have, that is to wit,
liberty or freedom. Every man confesses freedom to be the chief benefit
that we can enjoy. But so it is, that we be in bondage, and the wild Asses
are free. And yet notwithstanding we fall to boasting, and bear our selves in
hand that there is such an excellent worthiness in us, as we ought to be
carried above the clouds, and God ought to reach out his hand too set us upon
his shoulders. Thus see we the folly of men in that behalf. And therefore
let us mark well that God meant here to humble us, and to correct the pride
that is in us, because we cannot refrain from esteeming our selves beyond
measure. And why is that? Because we think not upon him, nor upon his works.
Howbeeit we need not mount so high as unto his majesty to humble us: the very
beasts can teach us and be our schoolemaysters: for we be not worthy to have
other teachers than them. Nevertheless it might be de maunder whither the
wild Asses are to be preferred before m^ for that they rome abroad every
where, and are not hilde in awe or subjection, nor can be tamed by man. The
answer is, that if men had continued in their vncorruptnesse, they should have
been subject too reason, not as in the way of bondage, but every man should
have had such rule of himself, as God should have reigned euerywhere: there
should have needed no laws, no iusticers, nor no swoorde too have executed
men for doing evil: there should have needed none of all those things. For
every man should have been as a law and rule too himself: he should have had
Gods law printed in his heart. And such a willing subjection should have been
more noble and excellent, than all the dominions in the world. But for as much
as we be corrupted, it behooves us too be hilde in thraldom: for therein God
shows us that we be not able to rule our selves, since he will have us too
be brought under awe of others. And not only by laws and civil order are men
hild under the yoke* but also God suffers hard and combersome charges to be
laid upon them, according as we see druerse times that when tyrants bear sway
in the world, they be so far off from being fathers too their subjects: that
they vex them, pill them, poll them, and bite them as much as they can. In this
behalf then our state serves as it were too shame us: and God teaches and
tells us that the beasts in some respect have a better time than we. Yet
notwithstanding it is not to be said, that God has in all respects so utterly
rejected me^, that the beasts are in better case than they. For we see that
when he compares his people of Israel too a wild Ass by his Prophet Osee:
it is too show that there was Unicorn cannot be tamed: that we cannot use
him to our commodity: that although be be strong and light, yet will be not
till the earth at our pleasure, nor draw the plough, another will be draw the
carte to bring home come into the barn: too be short, he is not too serve
man's turn, but altogether for himself. Here we have to note, first of all,
that whereas the beasts do us service, it is because God tameth them, and
puts them into our hands, to the end we should enjoy them. And for proof
thereof, why does a horse suffer himself too be ruled by a man, and draw the
plough or the harrowes, and carry a rider or other burden on his back? How
happens it that men do break Mules, Asses, and Oxen? For a horse is strong
enough to withstand a man, and we see he is a stout and coragious beast.
How then does man get the maystrie of him? And surely if a man were not
acquaynted with the taming of Oxen, their horns were a terrible thing too
look^ upon: the very shaking of their head were enough (...) abashe a man:
their great eyes and thick necks [would aghast him:] and if they should bend
their horns at him, they were enough too run him through if he came near
them. Again we see what huge bodies they have. And how could men have any use
of them, if it pleased not God too give us the maystrie of them? For as well
might the Unicorns be tamed as horses and oxen, if God had not given them that
[diuerse] nature. So then let us behold Gods goodness in applying those beasts
to our service, which otherwise were able to amase us with their only look, so
as we durst not come near them. A little child will rule oxen, in so much that
when they be accustomed to the yoke, he shall keep the^ there with a little
stick, he shall make them bow down their thick necks, and stoop with
their broad horns, and (to be short) he shall weelde them in such sort that
whereas they were able too bear down all things before them, there shall be no
resistance at all. Since we see this, let us acknowledge that God has showed
himself bountiful toward us, seeing he has after that manner made such
beasts subject to us, as were able to have made us afraid (as I said before)
and will nevertheless have them apply themselves too our service, so as men
may tame them. Behold, the Elephant is tamed, which is a passing terrible
beast: for the very look of him overcomes all other beasts. Truly he is as a
mountain, and seems too serve of purpose to destroy us: and yet
notwithstanding* when he is subdued, he becomes after a sort tame: not that
he keeps not still some incling of his own kind: but yet is it a wonder to
us that man can after some manner ouermayster him, and make him too serve their
turn. On the contrary part, the Unicorn being but a small beast, and having
no more but a certain nimblenesse in him, keeps always his sturdinesse, in
so much that all the men in the world cannot by their cunning and strength bring
him to subjection. Since we see this, let us be convicted at leastwise by such
comparison. And when breaking of the cleddes, and of tilling of the ground, and
of carrying the corn into the barn: it is too the end that men should be the
better warned, that they had need to be provided of many helps at Gods hand.
We could not continue in the world, if we had not meat and drink: we could
not live two days, if we were not nurrished. And who is he that gives us
bread? Are men so able of themselves as they can till the earth alone? No: they
may well employ all the strength of their arms, and they may well dig and
delue: but alas, all that is not enough too make the corn grow for their
sustenance. And who shall clothe them while they be tilling of the earth? where
shall they get coats, hozen and shoes? who shall furnish them of all their
necessaries? for we see we be subject to so many things, that only meat and
drink will not serve our turn. What a number of helps have we need of too
mainteyne us in this wretched life? considering then that God had need too
give us such an innumerable sort of helps: let us therefore think upon the
great number of benefits which he has bestowed upon us: as in that he has
ordained horses and oxen to till the ground for us, and to bring home the
corn into our Barnes, and furthermore given us such skilfulnesse, that when
we have done amiss, by and by we have a remedy at hand. Seeing that God has
made us too behold his goodness after that manner before our eyes, let us also
consider how deeply we be bound and indetted unto him to serve him with all
lowliness. For behold, the chief point that is showed us in this book, is
that men shall never yield God his due honor, except they stoop unto him,
without presuming too grudge against him, or without taking upon them to teach
him his lesson. And undoubtedly it is not our school, that he ought to come
unto. He has such wisdom in himself, that (as has been showed heretofore,
and as shall be showed further hereafter) we be constreyned, (I say we be
constreyned) to be abashed at the sight of Gods doings. And as we be abashed
in that behalf, so also behooves it us to learn to glorify him: for that is
all that we can do. Now let us come to that which is said of the Peacockes and
Estridges. Who is he (says God) that has given so goodly wings to the
Peacockes? God shows us in one word, that one only fether is enough to prove
us stark fools, in that we cannot be contented with his doings. Let us look
upon a Peacockes fether: is there not so wonderful a workmanship in the
same, as we wot not what to say to it, but only to glorify God? I say that
even the unbelievers are compelled therevnto-Seing it is so: I pray you are our
wits able to reach so high as too the skanning how God governs the world,
and too the things that are much higher without comparison? Must they notneedes
come short? If one feather of a Peacocke ravish us, and hold us as it were in a
gaze at it: what shall all the workmanship which appears in the whole world
do? what shall the special governing of mankind do? And yet notwithstanding,
that is the thing whereat men do utter their blasphemies: that is the thing for
which they chafe and storm against God, being desirous that he should govern
by their advice and after their fancy. And that is because they have not their
own liking, nor are dealt with at Gods hand as they themselves would wish. Yet
must we needs be proved to have failed of our duty, if we can consider
what he tells us. the wings of the Estridges: but that is rather to stay
upon that which is added concerning the fondness, lightness, and strength
that is in them. Also he speaks of Storkes: and that may be the rather too
bring us to the reasonableness that is in them: for there is more kindness to
be found in them, than there is oftentimes in men. For when the young Storkes
are grown great, they reknowledge their dammes, and feed them in their old
age, too requite that which they did too them in the Estrich mocketh both the
horse and his Rider. This serves to show the nimblenesse that is in that great
birdbeast: for it is half a bird [of the ayre] and that God has bereft the
Estrich of wisdom: let us understand that it is too warn us, that in as much
as we have reason and discretion, we be so much the more bound unto God, for
giving us so inestimable a benefit and privilege. For what a thing is it too
discern between good and evil, and too know what is our duty, not only
for walking in this world, but also to attain to the everlasting life? what a
principal thing is it, that we know how God has created us after his own
image, and prepared our heritage for us above? Seeing then that we have the
skill too discern between honesty and dishonestie, and between vice and
virtue: and that moreover God does so inlighten us by his holy spirit, that
the heavens are after asort opened unto us, and we pass above the world to
come to the company of the Angels, and to the endless glory which is
purchaced for us by our Lord Jesus Christ: in as much (say I) as we have all
this: how much ought we too make of such a treasure? And by the way, who is he
that gives it us? For (as I have erst said) we should be like these
foolish Birdbeastes that are spoken of here, and we should have no more
wit than the Estriches: but that God provides otherwise for us. Thus then
ye see how men ought too bridle themselves, and too apply all their wit and
reason too the honoring of God, and not advance themselves any more against
him. But the chief thing is that they must obey him, and consider that there
is infirmity still in themselves, and that it is enough for them if they can
in some small quantity discern the greatness and heights of Gods works, and
that in creeping upon the earth, they go foreward still with all hu^blenesse
and modesty, knowing well that they cannot as yet atteyne too the depth of
Gods secrets. And that is the thing which I touched at the beginning for the
better confirmation of this text: namely that God on the one side intends
too make us perceive his goodness, to the end we should have no cause too be
grieved or to be out of patience, as though he had given a better state to the
wild beasts than to us: and yet nevertheless to the intent to humble us, we
see our serves in such plight, by reason of the corruption that we caught by
sin, that the beasts do pass us in some respects and particular points.
True it is that we shall always be preferred before the beasts, and be
placed in higher degree above them. Yea and whereas we have not so great
strength and nimblenesse as the beasts have: the same is to our profit, that
is to wit, too humble us withal: Estridges eggs: if God extend his providence
too the hatching of her eggs, even when they be left and forsaken: it is much
more likely that he will never forget us, us (I say) which are more excellent
creatures. And in good sooth we see he has provided much better for mankind,
than for those cattle. For behold, the hens

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgeme^t of
our sins, praying him to make us feel them better: and generally too open
our eyes, that we may no more be puffed up with pride and presumption, nor be
any more drunken with our own vain fancies, too stand in our own conceyt and
too boast our selves: but that we may rather learn too submit our selves to
him, to hold all our goods of him, and to do him honor for them,
acknowledging that if he continue not his mercy toward us, we be utterly
undone at every minute of an hour: that by that mean we may be always hild
in his fear and subjection, and profit therein more and more, and that
moreover he may vouchsafe too bear with us still, so long as he sees us yet
hemmed in with so many infirmities and corruptions, until he have utterly
bereft us of them, and transformed us unto his glory and image. That it may
please him too grant this grace, not only to us, but also to all people and
nations of the earth, bringing back all poor ignorant souls from the
miserable etc.

The Cliij. Sermon, which is the third upon the* xxxix. Chapter.
22 Have thou given strength to the horse, or environed his neck with neying?

23 VVilt thou make a horse afraid as a grassehopper (or Locust?) the neying of
his nosthrilles is terrible.

24 He diggeth the earth with his foot, he reioiceth, he goes with boldness
before the armed man.

25 He passes not for scaring, he fears not, another shunneth he the svvoord.

26 Let the Quiver rattle, and the steel of the spear and of the shield.

27 He svvallovveth up the earth in rage and fierceness, and he passes not
for the noyze of the trumpet.

28 When he hears the trumpet, he says, ha ha: he smells the battle a
far off, and the noyze of the Captains, and the shouting of the army.

29 Will the hawk take him to his feathers by thy wisdom, or will he
spread out his vvngs toward the South?

30 Will the Eagle mount up at thy commandment, and make her nest in the
high places?

31 She dwells upon the rock, and abides upon the high mountains as in
infortresses.

32 And from thence she espieth her pray, and her eyes look far off.

33 Her young ones suck up blood, and haunt where dead bodies are.

34 And the Lord ansvvered and said unto Job.

35 Is it learning to strive with the Almighty? let him that reproves God
answer to this.


IF we were dispozed to be taught of God, he also on his part would deal
so with us, as all his teaching should be to lift us up out of hand unto
himself, yea and that after so familiar a fashion as a father talks to his
children. Howbeit, forasmuch as we be hard to be governed, and in stead of
yielding Horses, and of their nature, he shows that men know not his works,
when they will needs auaunce themselves after that sort against him. And
therewithal he shows that unless it please him, he will not vouchsafe to
answer any of our replies, but it shall be enough for us to be disproued by
the brute beasts: Yea even by the horses which are of household with us: so as
he shall Is it in man to give such strength as is seen in Horses? Or special,
to give them so lusty and coragious a nature? For besides that horses are
strong of limbs, we see that they be partly bred of purpose for the wars.
Men see how they cast themselves into the mids of danger: and they are
inflamed with such a furiousness, as a man would say that they be of one
mind with the Trumpettes and with the great shoutes, yea and (...) they do
even encourage the men. Since we see this, (...) that there is terriblenesse
even in their nozethrils, so as he is a dreadful beast of himself, and yet men
know but a small piece of Gods working in that behalf, for he has not uttered
all his power there too the full, but has only given a little sign and mark
what he is able too do: if men consider it thoroughly, ought they to strive or
check any more? dare they now set themselves against the living God? they
durst not answer a horse, they durst not rub him upon the back, they would
be afraid of him: and yet they be not afraid of the infinite power whereof
they see but a small drop in all the horses of the world. Ye see then what
we have to remember in effect upon this streyne. And even in the same we see
that God has used no superfluous language in speaking here of the hardiness
of horses, and of their strength, and that men cannot scare them as
Grassehoppers, but that they run upon the spears and arrows. It was
needful for him to speak so. And why? For we be hardy and bold enough
too carpe at God when we know not his glory* And it is our own blockishnesse
that gives us that boldness: for in as much as we draw a curtayne before
our eyes, which keeps us from the sight of Gods glory, that is the thing
that makes us so brutishe. So then, because we play the sharpsighted men, and
will needs comprehend all things in our own fancy, to know the infinite
power of God: therefore does God treat here of Horses, and set before us the
strength and power that is in them. And why so? To the end we should be
ravished in wondering at his guyding. For it behooves us always to come back
to this point, that God has not uttered his power altogether in horses nor
given us there to understand the uttermost that he is able to do: but has set
forth but only as it were one drop of his providence there. And yet for all
that, if we consider well what is said here: were it not that we be accustomed
with the sight and handling of horses, every of us would run away before
them, and they would be terrible beasts to us, specially at the sight of their
boldness which they show in battle. Thus ye see how we must apply all the
things to our instruction, which are rehearsed here particularly concerning
horses. Yea and on the other side we must note the goodness of God, in that he
tameth horses after that sort, to subdue the^ unto men and to apply them to
their service. Think we that a horse which is vntame of his own nature, yea
and bred as it were of purpose for battle, would suffer himself to be so
ruled and weelded, if Hawks and Eagles. Have thou (says he) given wings to
the Hawk? or will he fly at thy commandment when he soreth toward the
South? or when it seems that he would stie up into the Sun? Have thou shaped
the Eagles (says he)? Is it thou that give them their nestes in the Rocks,
and in the towers of the mountains? that is to say, in the high and lofty
places? Art thou able to set such an order in nature? And whereas their young
ones feed upon blood, and are bredde thereunto: is it thou that have invred
them to be fed and nurrished with such a sustenance? The Eagles find where
the dead bodies are, and they smell them out a far of: yea and they be so
sharpsighted as they ^e able to spy them out euerywhere: and surely it is
certain that this foul has the sharpest sight of all others. Is it thou
then that has given such nature to the Eagles, says god? We see how God both
above and beneath offers us mirrours (or rather lively images,) wherein we
may perceive his mighty power to humble ourselves: and yet notwithstanding we
must consider also, that in the same there is wherewith to stop us, when we
be so foolish or mad as to the hawks that fly in the air. It is a
strange thing, only too see that a living creature can cast forth it self
and mount up with such force, as it seems that it should pearce through the
clouds: and no doubt but we would be exceedingly abashed at it, if we were not
accustomed with it. For do we surmyze that the same is done by haphazard? Were
it possible for the birds to mount up after that fashion if God had not given
them that nature? Now if we see Gods hand apparent in a bird: which of us
shall take upon him to teach God his lesson? for we be confounded in a very
small thing: and what proportionablenesse or nerenesse shall there be, if we
make comparison between God and his creatures? Again, if we compare a hawke
with the residue of the whole world: it is nothing. And if so small a portion
of Gods works ought to ravish us and amaze us: what ought all his works to do
when we come to the full numbering of them, so as we fall to discoursing of all
the things which we see both above and beneath? Moreover when we consider
that the Majesty of God is yet higher above all the Heavens, and so far off
from us as we cannot reach unto it: does it not become us to stoop, to
honor and reverence it, and to be restreyned from passing any further,
whenever the Devil shall labor to make us carpe against it, or to grudge at
it by any manner of mean? As for the things that are spoken here concerning
the nature of Eagles: it may be taken, that their young ones do suck blood
anon after that they be vnclozed, because that one kind of Eagles do cast
their young ones out of the neste, so as they be driven to shifte for
themselves: and it is said that they bring up none but the black ones:
howbeeit they that write of such matters, do vary in that point: for some
say that the Eagles do cast away their yo^g ones as bastard Eagles, if their
sight be not strong enough to look full upon the shining Sun. But we have
not to do with the curious points of the Philosophers, it is enough for us that
God does here show us the nature of Eagles in such wise, as it is known: and
he uses (as ye would say) that gross fashion, to the intent we should have
no cloak nor excuse of ignorance. Look me then upon the Eagles that are
bredde to the pray: yea even from the shell they have the property of sucking
blood: and it is a strange thing that a bird should so feed and nourishe
it self with blood. that the Eagles resort thither as they perceive any dead
bodies too be, and that they smell the dead carkesses a far of, and spy out
their pray too make their flight thitherward. Now when we see such things,
let us understand that our Lord has put a secret moving into them: for it
were impossible that the Eagles should have it of themselves, but that G^d has
inured them to it, and imprinted I wot not what a thing in them, whereby he
shows himself to be wonderful. So then, when we look about us and behold
the diversity of works, we be enforced spite of our teeth, to know that there
is a Creator or maker which bears sway: for if all beasts were of one nature
that the Eagles gather together to the place where caryons are: that is to wit,
that since the birds which live by pray have skill to seek their feeding, and
specially that the Eagles do smell a far off where aught is for them to
feed upon: much more reason is it that we should resort to the place where
God shows us that our life is. And therefore seeing that the birds resort
together for corruptible food, yea and run thither and take pain for it:
what excuse is there for us if we on our side refuze our [spirituall] food
when it is offered us, and have not the wit to resort to the place where our
life is? Shall there need any other witnesses against us than the Eagles?
according also as our Lord Jesus sets forth the same similitude unto us.
For after he has spoken of the great troubles that should be in the world:
he says that wheresoever the dead carkesse is, thither will the Eagles
resort, according wherevntoo we of the country may say the like of Ravens.
Ye see then that these poor birds have a natural inclination to seek their
meat and pray: and where shall we on our side find our life? Should we be
so witless, when our Lord Jesus Christ calls and allureth us unto him,
telling us that when we be come thither we shall find all that we want, and
be enriched with all manner of good things, so as we shall be fully replenished
with his nurrishment and strength, even to our full contentation? Therefore let
us think upon it: for seeing we have such assurance, must not the Eagles
bear witness against us at the great day, if we be retchlesse now? But let us
come back to the principal Is it learning to contend with the Almighty? Let
him that corrects God answer to it. This then serves to show us too what
purpose so many things have been discoursed. For a man might think it
strange, that God inte^ding to maintain his righteousness and to stop men's
mouths that they should not carpe against him, should speak of the stars, of
the tilling of the ground, and of the manner of sailing, and set, forth the
natures of beasts. Too what purpose is Does he then show himself to be wise,
which contendeth with the Almighty? True it is, that forasmuch as the Hebrew
word that is set down here, signifies as well to Teach, as to Correct,
(for word for word it is thus: Is it learning or correcting to strive with
the Almighty?) It might be taken as though it were said, does the man that
so quarelleth and strives with God, prepare himself too be chastyzed? No:
but contrariwise he hardens himself. Now our true wisdom is to have skill
to chastize our selves, and to know our own wants, that we may be sorry and
ashamed of them, disproued: for do we not see a wonderful woorkemanship of
our God in every of the tips of our fingers ends? Is there any of our nails
that witnesses not that God is so excellent a workemaister, as we ought to be
co^fou^ded as often as we think upon the least thing that he shows us there?
Now then we have the true and natural meening of the sentence, where it is
said, Let him that reproves the Almighty answer to this Howbeit, it behooves
us to mark how profitable this doctrine is for us. True it is, that all of us
will at the first sight say, that it is to lewd and heinous

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement
of our sins, praying him that we may be so touched with the^, as it may
thoroughly beat us down before him, and make us flee to his only mercy, as
the only remedy for us: and that he not only forgive our sins past, but
also govern us in such wise by his holy spirit henceforth, as our whole
desire may be to walk in his obedience. And so let us all say, Almighty God
heavenly father, etc.

The.Cliiij. Sermon, which is the fourth upon the.xxxix. Chapter.
and the first upon the.xl. Chapter.

36 Job answering the Lord, said:

37 I am of bace degree, and what shall I ansvverc thee? I will lay my hand
upon my mouth.

38 I have spoken once, and I will answer no more: yea twice, but I will
not turn again.


The.xl. Chapter. ANd the Lord speaking out of the vvhirlevvinde said unto
Job,

2 Gyrde up thy loins like a valiant man: ask me, and I will make thee
understand.

3 VVilt thou disanull my judgment? vvilt thou condemn me to justify thy
self?

4 Have thou an arm like God, or thunderest thou with such a voice?

5 Cloth thy self with glory and majesty, be excellent, put on thy costly
apparel.

6 Spread out the indignation of thy wrath, look upon all the proud to bring
them down.


WE have seen already that god to that Job granted himself to be of bace
state, and that it behooved him to hold his peace, and to keep his mouth shet:
therein it appears that God magnified not himself in vain, and that his
speaking so out of a VVhirlewind, was not without effect. And why? For ^o, Job
is tamed as a little lamb, and he goes not about to reply any more.
Heretofore he had striued, and taken upon him to contend with God in
mainteyning his own case: but now is all that geere laid a water: and he
says Lord I see now I am of bace state. Truly it should seem that this
saying caryeth no great pith in it: but if we consider well the foolish
ouerweening that is in in men: we shall see that Job had profited greatly in
that he could say, that he was of bace state. If it be demanded of whence we
be come, [and what we be:] we will answer that we be wretched creatures, taken
out of the earth, so frail as it is pity to see, and fraught with store of
infirmities. We will confess these things with our mouth, but yet in the
mean while we will not cease to esteem of our selves: we forget from whence
we came, and whither we must return, and what our present state is: none of
this comes to our mind. Men then are (as ye would say) drunken by bearing
themselves in hand that they be much worth, and they challenge a worthiness to
them through fantastical imagination. And therefore whenever any man does
truly and unfeignedly know how too despyze himself, and that he has not
aught in him wherefore he should advance himself: it is very much, yea it
is great wisdom. And let us mark well, that we shall never come to such
reason, till we be [throughly] touched with the Majesty and glory of God.
For so long as men look one upon another, they take occasion to esteem of
themselves, saying: Am not I as well too be liked as he or he? This comparison
then which men make one with another, blinds them, and makes them too think
always that they be I wot not what. But when we come unto God, and he
shows himself as he is: all this ouerweening of ours must be feign to
vanish away, and to disperse and come to nothing. And so we have to beseech
God to make us perceive his glory, to the end we may enter into the said
examination of our own wretchedness, and disable ourselves in such wise, as
none of us may beguile himself any more by his own foolish that he will lay
his hand upon his mouth, and whereas he has spoken once, he will not fall
too it again: and that whereas he has spoken twice, he will do so no more.
VVheras he says he will lay his hand upon his mouth, it is a sign and
protestation that he will not proceed any further: and that manner of speech
is rife in the scripture. And it serves to do us to understand that we must
restreine our foolish appetites, and that when our flesh tickleth us to
speak, we must resist it, as if it were by putting a muzzle or a bridle
upon our mouths to refreyne them. If a man were so wise of himself, as he
would not be tempted to speak amiss, he should not need to lay his hand
upon his mouth, for he would hard for me, and I do always incline to the
other side. Yea, but it is enough if we res(...) against it. Not that we be not
worthy to be condemned though we overcome it: (for the very only imagination
and conceyuing of it in our thought, is wicked and sinful before God:) but for
that he of his infinite goodness takes it in good worth, when he sees that
the evil likes us not, but that we labor to repress it. God then perceiving
us to have that inclination, fay leth not to accept us. Wherefore seeing he is
so gracious toward us: we ought too have so much the having spoken once,
leaves off: yea and that seeing he had spoken tw^^e, he would do so no more.
Whereby he betokens first of all, that if we have gone too far in speaking
amiss, we must not therefore harden our selves as we see many do, who when
they have once ouershotte themselves and raunged far out of square, will not
be brought back again, but play double or quit as they say. We must not do
so: for although the evil be of continuance, Whereas I have spoken once or
twice, (says he) I renounce it every whit, and I will no more do so. Hereby
we be taught (as I said) that although we had never so many fair clokings,
and thought our selves to have very good reasons, and well grounded to
maynteyne our case: they be nothing Gyrde up thy loins like a man, which
saying we have heard heretofore. Now if a man might think it strange that
God should still speak terribly unto Job, and as it were defy him, and mock
at his presumptuousnesse: seeing he was utterly cast down in himself. But
hereby a man may see, that when we be humbled, there is yet still some remnant
of pride hidden in us, which appears not but before God, and he must be feign
to purge us of it. It is certain that when Job confessed himself to be a
wretched creature, and a man of no value, he used no feinednes, but spoke as
his heart gave him. Yet see then, that he was fully tamed and come to a meek
and humble mind, desiring to be wholly obedient unto God, and yet for all
that, he needed to be chastized still, and to be better schooled, to the end
he might acknowledge himself to be as he was, and thereupon yield all glory
and praise unto God. And why so? Because (as I said) there is always some
backenooke: and although men be brought unto God, and be desirous too frame
themselves too Gods will: yet are they not thoroughly clenzed of all pride at
the first, but God perceyueth that there is still some secret disease behind,
the which it behooves him to amend. Lo here a very notable text. For have we
once slightly consessed that Gods afflicting of us is rightful, and
acknowledged our sins: we wonder that he should go forward still in
handling us roughly. It will make us to say, how now? Ought God to be so
rigorous toward me? For he knows that I have humbled my self: and
whereas I have done amiss, I have acknowledged my faults, yea even my
faults, I consesse them, I accuse my self of them. Is not that enough for
him? What would he have more? It seems then to us, that God after a sort
does us wrong, if he stryke us still when we have once in a word or twain
confessed our selves to be sinners. Yea? But let us look at Job: he had not
only confessed himself to be a man of no value, but also thought it [with
his heart,] and had restreyned himself from replying any more, and was
stricken in fear with the glory of God that had appeared unto him: and yet
notwithstanding he needed still too have God to thunder at him, and too show
himself terrible too him in a whirlewinde to make him more afraid. If Job
having bin thrown down after that sort, had need to be put in fear still,
to the end he might know himself better, and see his own wretchedness,
and forget all rebelliousnesse: alas what had we need of? And yet
notwithstanding ye shall see a number, which have nothing in them but
hypocrisy, yea and very shamelessness, who wring their mouth aside too say, It
is true that I have done amiss. And when they have once said that word, as it
were but in way of scorn and mockery: if men accept them not in posthast as
rightuous, and handle them not very nicely: it secmeth to the^ that they be
unreasonably dealte with. But (as I said before) although we have felt our
sins yea even earnestly, and confessed them without feygning, and desired
heartily that God should govern us, and have all dominion over us: yet does
it not follow but that there is some naughtiness lurking still behind,
though it be not known of* Truly (too our own seeming) there is no pride
in us, because we see it not presently: but within a day or two it would be
seen if God remedied it not. And therefore let us not think it strange, that
God should speak unto us in a whirlewinde as in a thunder, even when he shall
have scourged us till we can no more. Let us not wonder though God continue to
speak unto us so, for he knows good cause why to do it. And although we
perceive no faults in us, yet let us not cease too condemn our selves. Yea and
although there were none at all in us [presently **] yet does God know that
Girde up thy loins like a lusty stout follow. True it is, that in the Hebrew
there is but the one word man: howbeit the same imports as much as a
valiant, hardy, stout, His meening then is, Show all thy valiantness. And
therein we see that God speaks not only to the person of Job: but also to all
mankind without exception: as if he should say, let men bring all the force
that they can, let them put themselves in as good array as they list, and let
them come with all their furniture: and what shall they gain against me? This
therefore is as a defiance that God makes both too great and small, to show
that they cannot bring any power that shall be able too match his: and that is
the first point. Howbeeit Girde up thy loins like a man: therein he declares*
that our presuming so upon our own strengthes, is too no purpose. What makes
us so bold as to presume to be rightuous, and to desire too seem wise: but
that we surmyze the thing that is not? If we were not overtaken with that
fond opinion that there is some valor in us: we would never be so bold as
to encounter after that fashion with God. Therefore here is express mention
made of girding up the loins: it is spoken after the manner of that time, and
of that Country also, because men went in long garments: and when they did set
forth either too battle, or to journey, they girded up their loins to weld
themselves the better. God then shows here, that when men have done all that
they can, in the end they shall be confounded. And therefore let us not attempt to
vaunt ourselves, for it shall always but argue the more foolish pride in us.
But let us win our spurs by condemning our selves, as which is the only mean
for us to get favor in Gods sight, according as it is said that we shall be
quitte at his hand, if we learn to condemn our selves. But if through pride
we fall to iustling against his hand which is to strong for us: we must
needs be crushed and broken too pieces under it, and feel that it is to
heavy a load for us to bear. Now it is said further. VVilt thou overthrow
my judgments, and condemn me to justify thy self? If thou intend to do so,
see [first] if thou be able to beat down all the proud folk in the
world. Here God enters into the case which he has to plead against Job:
that is to wit, whether of them shall be more rightuous: Not that Jobs intent
was to blaspheme God so lewdly, as I have said before: for he would rather
have dyed a hundred thousand times, than to have conceived so cursed a
thought, as to purpose to condemn God. But yet for all that, when soever a man
will justify himself, or has that imagination running in his head: he must
needs condemn God: and if he will needs mainteyne his own case, he must
needs overthrow the judgment of God: This matter has been laid forth
before: nevertheless it must needs be brought to remembrance again, and it is
no superfluous repetition which the holy Ghost sets down here. Therefore
let us mark well, that whenever a man undertakes too mainteyne his own
case as rightful: his meening is to condemn god, howbeit not directly. And
although he intend it not of set purpose in his heart: yet does he it [in
effect.] Why so? For God cannot beiust, and a Judge also until we be all
damnable. So long as men have any righteousness in themselves, how shall God
be their

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him to make us feel them better than we have hitherto
done, and that we may learn more and more too glorify him, yea eue^ in such
wise as we may be utterly thrown down, knowing that there is nothing but all
wickedness and cursednesse in us: and that in glorifying him, we on our side
may have our mouths shette as in respect of presuming any thing, and not be
carried away by the example of the proud, which think themselves too bear as
much rule as God, but learn too know what we be, too the end we may yield
our selves wholly subject to his Majesty, that by that means he may
acknowledge us and auow us for his people, and we on our part consider how
much we be bound unto him. That it may please him to grant this grace not
only to us, etc.

The.Clv. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xl. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the 4. 5. and 6. verses, and then upon the text
which is added here.

7 Cast thine eye upon the lofty to pull them down, destroy all the wicked,
and raze them out of their places.

8 Hyde them in the dust, bind their faces in darkness.

9 And then will I say that thine own hand can save thee.

10 Look upon Bemoth whom I made with thee, he will eat hay as an Ox.

11 His strength is in his loins, and his force is in the nauill of his belly.

12 He sets up his tail as a Ceder, the sinevves of his Coddes are
interlaced together.

13 His bones are as brass, and his small bones are as bars of iron*

14 He is the beginning of Gods vvayes, he that made him casts his svvorde
against him.

15 The mountains bring him forth grass, and all the beasts of the feeld
play.

16 He keeps among the Reeds, and in moist places.

17 The shadows shall cover him, and vvillovves of the River hide him.

18 Behold, he drinks up Rivers, and is not astonished at it: he hops
that Jordan shall pass through his throat.

19 A man will take him by the nose with a hook, and strike him through.


We saw yesterday, that when men Is thine arm like the arm of God? or
rorest thou with such a voice as he does? Now if a man look vpo^his own arm,
yea or upon all the force of the worlder what shall he find in comparison of
the infinite power that bears sway over all? True it is (as I have said
already) that men are foolish enough to think their own strength great, so
long as they look no further. But as soon as god she weth himself, al other
things must needs be as it were brought to nothing. And to the end that this
thing may to cloth himself with glory, power, and majesty After the same
manner speaks the Scripture of God. And (as the thing it self shows) what
else is the heaven tha^ an imperial or kingly roabe of god, so as we be
enforced to a reuerentnesse by the beholding of his creatures? For there is not
any thing which serves not to set forth the majesty of God, to the end that
we should honor it as it becomes us, and as it deserves. But now let us go
seek out the like apparellings: who shall be either the Tailor [to make them]
or the Imbroyderer of the roaring voice: True it is that men will cry out too
loud, according as we see how they whet their tongues to blaspheme and spyte
God. It is said in the Psalm, that the wicked think it not enough for them to
be proud among men, and to accuse one falsely, and to defy another, and too
work treasons and wicked practices: but they also cast up their groynes
against heaven, and assault God himself: and their pride is so great, that
they dare buskle against the Majesty of God. Now then ye see that men rore,
but yet will God make them hold their peace well enough if he list. And after
what manner? We have seen, heretofore (according also as it is said in the
Psalm) that the Thunder is Gods voice. Then since the Thunder makes the hills
to rore, so as the air is after a sort cloven asunder, the Earth quaketh,
Trees are torn up, and the Rocks are shaken: I say when we hear all this,
which of us shall presume any more to speak against God? For he has a voice
that can well enough put us to silence. Let us cry aloude with full throat,
yet will God be heard spyte of our teeth, and all our moylings must fall to
the ground. Furthermore, although God thunder not after such a fashion, yet
must he needs stop all our mouths in showing us his will, and make all our
outcryes to be laid down. He needs not to come down from heaven to do it,
nor too show himself here in visible shape: but like as he made all things
by his word, and all things are vphilde by the power thereof: so will he
by*the same cause us to folter, not only in our tongues, but also in our wits,
and in all our powers* God then has diverse manners of speaking, whereby he put
th me^ so to silence, that if they would carpe against him, they shall have no
audience: and therefore let us learn to hold our peace willingly, and too put
in vr^ yesterdayes lesson: which was to lay our hand upon our mouth (that is
to say, to resist the diuelishnes of our pride, notwithstanding that naturally
we be bold to advance our selves against God) and therwithall learn to give
glory simply unto God, in confessing that there is nothing but wretchedness
in our selves. When we be once confounded with our own good will: Gods voice
will not only not be dreadful any more unto us: but also it will cheer us up,
and he will open our mouth that we may speak freely. VVherof comes it that
the faithful can vaunt themselves against the devil and despise death?
VVherof comes that boldness of ours, that we can call upon God as whether
they can destroy the proud with a look: or whether they can root out all
the wicked. If they can do that: then show they themselves, that they have
somewhat whereof too boast. But if they cannot: how dare they commence any
quarrel against God? Here is still the same comparison that I have touched:
which is, that when we know what God is, and what his of the proud and wicked
sort. Therefore let us mark well these two things: namely, that God does here
magnify himself, forasmuch as he can with his only look overthrow and
destroy the of the earth should come of set purpose too fight against God? But
yet so it is, that all such as presume of themselves, all such as think they be
of any valor at al, all such as bear themselves in hand that they be either
wise, or virtuous or rightuous: all such (say I) do make war against God.
Though they speak it not with their mouth: yet is it all one: for so it is in
very deed: and therefore God tells us that a man cannot justify himself, but
that in so doing he assaulteth heaven. Now then, if we were thoroughly persuaded
of this doctrine, that all proud folks are That the countenance of the Lord
is upon the lofty ones, too root them out of the world, and that none but
the meek ones have the everlasting that it is Gods office too b^^^e down the
pride of all men with his look. And he adds thereunto the wicked, to show
that he is an enemy to all lof^ie ones, which forget themselves and believe,
that they be able to work woonders of their own power. For if men were not
so proud as to despise God: surely they would hold themselves still, and not
give the bridle so to their lusts. Needs therefore must pride carry us
away, when we use violence and outrage toward our neighbors, for when we
devour one, and fleece another of al his goods, and show all the spite and
malice that we can: it is a token that there is no fear of God in us, and that
we know not so much as that we be mortal men. For he that knows how he has
but as a journey to pass through this world, and that his life is brittle and
transitory: will certainly bridle himself, if it were but even in that only
one respect. And therefore needs must men be bewitched, and utterly ignorant
what themselves are, and what their state is, when they ouershoote themselves.
And verily that is the cause why the Prophet Abacuck (when he says that the
rightuous man shall live by faith) avouches on the contrary part, that all
loftiness shall be beaten down. What meeneth he by all loftiness? he
meeneth all sturdinesse against God, and all scornefulnesse against men.
Howbeeit he uses the word loftiness, because men forget themselves, and
are as it were out of their wits, when they ouershoote themselves after that
sort to chafe against their God. But now it might be demanded, whether God
does root out all proud folks out of the world. For by all lykelyhod he
rather spares them, and lays the reins of the bridle looce in their neck,
so as they triumph at their pleasure. Howbeeit let us mark, that it is not for
us too appoint the term, too say that at such an hour God shall confound
and destroy all proud folk: he will do it, howbeeit in his due season. And
therefore although the proud folk do bear sway, and God seem to let them
do what they list, yea and that they laugh [in their sleeues] as though there
were no power to repress them: yet has he still his office which belongs
unto him, namely of rooting out the proud and wicked sort with his only look.
Yea, but (as it is said in the scripture) sometimes he hydeth himself from his
faithful ones, not that he ever forgets them, or is not careful of them:
but he shows not himself in outward working, to the intent too try our
faith and patience. It may seem too us that God has forgotten us when we be
in any danger, and specially when we feel the blows, and finally when we
see death present, and in the mean while we perceive not that God myndeth to
reach us his hand, and yet even then we cry unto him, Alas, Lord where art
thou? Why have thou forgotten me? Such complaints make we according to our
fleshly understanding: and so God seems not too look upon the proud, when
he suffers them to cast forth their poison after that fashion, and bears
with the numbers of outrages and enormities which they commit. Yea, but
forasmuch as their time is not yet come, let us tarry till God open his eyes
upon them, and then shall they be destroyed. Then if they be borne withal for
a time, and God wink at them: let us assure our selves that their turn is
not yet come wherein he will look upon them in his wrath, to root them out,
as I said before. Now this lesson ought to serve to double use. For the
faithful ought to take comfort at it: and although God deliver them not from
the tyranny of the wicked at the first brunt, yet have they cause to rest upon
him. Why? For he has not given over his office, no though they exalt
themselves against him: but their time is not yet come. He shall feed them as
men do Oxen: and like as men know when it is time to kill the Ox, so does God
know well enough the that if a man had that [power] he were able too save
himself by his own hand, as if it were said, that God confesses, that then
a man might pass him. Therefore when any of us has Behemoth. Now the word
Behema signifies simply a Beast, and under that name are Oxen and all other
beasts comprehended. Here it is said in the plural number, look upon
Behemoth whom I created with thee: and although the word Behemoth be the
plural number in the Hebrew: yet is it spoken but as of one beast and no mo.
Howbeeit forasmuch as God meant too betoken here one sort of beasts: that is
the cause why he sets Behemoth in the plural number. Nevertheless it
cannot be coniectured what kind of beast it is that he speaks of except it
be an Elephant, by reason of the hougenesse of that beasts body. But it is
evident that he speaks not here neither of Oxen, nor of Horses, nor of any
such other beasts: for it is said, look me upon Behemoth which cateth ^ay
as an Ox. God then makes an express difference between that kind of beast
whereof he speaks and Oxen. And therefore without troubling our selves too
much [for that his [great] bones are as brass, and his little bones or
gristles (as men term them) are as bars of iron. For it is an incredible
thing to us which are not acquainted with it, but they which see those beasts
ought to be afraid at the only look of them: the bigness of them is so
houge, as they seem too be things made by art [and not by nature.] But if
we were wize that these Elephantes were created with us, too the intent too
show us, how God has made the difference [betweene things] as he himself
listed, and that he has set a wonderful order in the world, so as men must
needs be ravished besides themselves when they think thereon, at leastwise
if they have the discretion to mark the things that are wide open before them.
Behold a man that has but a little body, is nevertheless appointed too be a
Lord and master in this world. Wherefore are all things created, but only
for our use? And we see an Elephant is so strong, that he is able to strike
down a great sort of me^ with one stroke of his foot. Then since we see such
things, and that there is such order in the world: it does well show unto us,
that God has done us great favor in making us so little as we be, and yet
notwithstanding that he has showed himself in the brute beasts also.
Insomuche that if the knowledge of the things that be put into our selves be
not enough for us: if we look upon the beasts, there we shall find things
to astonish our wits. And therewithal also let us mark well, that if
governing should go by greatness, then might the Elephants well reign over
us. But what? we see they suffer themselves too be ruled by men like little
Coltes in a stable. Also we see on the other side, that God has left them
destitute of many things. Behold what houge bodies they be, and yet
notwithstanding they cannot bow their legs, but are feign to stand
continually: for if an Elephant be down upon the ground, he cannot get up
again. Now when we see such a force on the one side, and such a default on the
other, (that is to wit, that those beasts cannot bow their legs, but are
feign too sleep standing, insomuch that if an Elephant be laid flat, he cannot
rise again alone, but a man were as good too rayze up a whole house:) ought
not such a sight too make us to glorify Gods goodness? For whereof is it
long, that the Elephants devour us not all? They eat hay as Oxen do. Seeing
then that these beasts which were able too execute such cruelty as to root
out all mankind out of the world, do feed of grass in the mountains, and
hyde themselves under the shadows of trees, and yet notwithstanding break not
out into such rage as they might do by reason of their hougenesse: whereof
comes it but of that it was Gods will to tame them, to the end to give us
room to dwell on here beneath? Again, whereas we be hemmed in on all sides
with so many sorts of wild beasts, could we continue vndeuoured one day in
this world, if God restreyned not their rage with a secret bridle? Therefore
let us learn to look so upon Gods works, as we may worthily magnify his
power, goodness, wisdom, and righteousness, by humbling, yea and even by
utter disabling of our selves, according as in deed we be nothing.

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgment
of our sins, praying him to make us so to feel them, as we may all learn to
walk in his fear, and to put us wholly into his hands without presuming any
thing upon our selves, but rather acknowledging our weakness and infirmity,
and beseeching him to help us: and that forasmuch as we should be overcome a
hundred thousand times a day, if he were not our defense, sheeld, and
safegarde: it may please him to guard us fro^al our spiritual foes, and to
deliver us from all our temptations by giving us power to outstande them, till
he have taken us out of this earthly life, which is a continual battle. That
it may please him too grant this grace, not only to us, etc.

The Clvj. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xl. Chapter.
And the first upon the.xlj. Chapter.

This Sermon is yet still upon the last ten verses, and then upon the text here
following:

20 Can thou dravv up Leuiathan with a hook, or bind his tongue with a
cord?

21 VVilt thou put a hook in his nozethrils, or perce his chavves with an
angle?

22 Will he make much intreatance to thee, or will he speak thee fair?

23 Will he make a covenant with thee, and vvilt thou take him a servant for
ever?

24 VVilt thou play with him as with a littlebird? or vvilt thou bind him for
thy young maids?

25 Shall the companions make a feast of him? or shall the merchants divide him
among them?

26 VVilt thou fill the baskets with his skin, or the fishers dorser with his
head?

27 Lay thy hand upon him, remember the battle and go no further.

28 Behold, his hope is disappoynted, and shall he not fall down at the sight
of him?


The.xlj. Chapter. THere is no man so cruel that dares wake him up: who
is he then that shall stand in my presence?

2 Who will prevent me, and I will satisfy him? All that is under heaven is
mine.

3 I will not conceal his members, nor his power, nor the comeliness of his
making.

4 Who will open the foreparte of his garment, or who shall come too him
with his double bridle.

5 Who shall open the gates of his face, and the rovves of his so terrible
teeth?

6 His scales are as strong sheeldes, fast set as the print of a seal.

7 One of them is clozed to another, so as the vvind cannot get through them.

8 They be shet one within another, they cleave together and cannot be sundred.

9 His neezing is like the shining of light, and his eyes are as the davvning
of the day.

10 Out of his mouth go lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.

11 Smoke steameth out of his noze as out of a seething pot or cauldron.

12 His breath sets coals on fire, and flame flasheth out of his mouth.

13 In his neck dwells strength, and labor is rejected before his face.

14 The parts of his flesh are knit together, every one is substantial in it
self without fleeting.

15 His heart is substantial as stone, and hard as a nether millstone.

16 The mighty are afraid when he rises up, and the waves are troubled.

17 When the svvorde touches him he will not stay [for it] nor for the
spear, nor for the dart, nor for the habergeon.

18 For he regards iron as straw, and brass as rotten vvood.

19 The Archer cannot put him to flight, the stones of the sling are turned
into stubble unto him.

20 He esteems darts as much as stubble, and laugheth at the shaking of the
spear.

21 Under him are sharp stones, and he spreads out sharp poynted things
upon the mire.

22 He makes the deep to sees like a cauldron, and makes the sea like a pot
of ointment.

23 He makes a path to shine after him, and esteems the deep as an old
thing.

24 His dominion is not upon the earth, and he is made to be afraid of nothing.

25 He beholds all high things: He is king over all the children of pride.


I Showed you yesterday, that after God had set forth many living things of the
Behemoth) and also upon the Leuiathan: we have too mark thereupon, how
men have been of opinion, that by an allegory the Devil is spoken of
here, rather than either the Elephant or the VVhale, and that they have gone
about too prove that fantastical device of theyrs by this, that in the end
it is said, that the said VVhale is the king of the children of pride. But in
speaking of the other kind of beast that I touched yesterday, it was said,
that God makes them to eat hay and grass like Oxen. We see then that his
intent is too show us Gods mighty power in the things that are too be seen,
and not to describe the Devil too us. As touching the word Leuiathan,
through the whole scripture it signifies a VVhale: and we see it too be so in
the hundred and fourth Psalm, where the Hebrew word Leuiathan is translated
a VVhale: and it is well enough known, that there the Prophet speaks of
Gods wonders which men see in the sea, yea much more than upon the land. There
is one peremptory reason too show us that we must take this text simply as
it stands, and not shiftingly. For we have seen heretofore how it was gods
intent to teach men after a gross and homely manner, according to their own
small capacity, and that his doing thereof is to the end that his mighty
power should be the better proved unto them. Moreover he meant also to upbraid
them with their folly, in that they dare set themselves against him, for so much
as the very beasts are able to reprove them. Wherefore let us mark well,
that here God gives men a lesson, thereby too skorne their pride, in sending
them to the brute beasts: but this could take no place, if it were spoken of
the devil. And whereas whale should he the king of all the children of pride:
it is not for that the beast has any such affection. But rather it is said too
compare men with the VVhale, as if our Lord should say, It is true that men
will lift up their sheelds very high, and fetch leapes above the clouds but
when they have gathered all the force they can, and presumed to the uttermost,
what is it in comparison of the VVhale? When a man has vaunted himself to
the vttermoste, let him but come to encounter with a whale, and the whale shall
have more cause to vaunt himself was not the Elephant created with us? Are we
made of any preciouser mould than he? Is there any quality in us, why we
should be more excellent? No: there is nothing that makes a difference betwixt
us, but God. Now we see that the Elephants which have so terrible a force, are
notwithstanding not so bold as to bend themselves against us: they go and hyde
themselves in moist places, and cannot have any covert that is commodiouse for
them. Seeing it is so: we see on the one side how greatly we be bound unto
God, and therefore we ought of good reason too acknowledge our own weakness
when mention is made of the brute beasts whom we durst not come near, no nor
so much as look upon them. How should we do then, if God restreyned them not?
Now after this, God leads us too the sea, and shows us that there also we
have wherewith to pull us down: not only by reason of the great multitude and
diversity of fisshes that are there to be seen, insomuch that even the
heathen and misbeleeuing writers were constreyned too say, that whereas men saw
many miracles upon the land, the sea was the true storehouse of the woonders
of nature: but also eue^ in respect of any one sort or kind of the^: as for
example let us take but only the whale, and is it not an incredible thing to
see so houge a creature, living in the water? who were able to fashion the
mould of so great, howge, and strong a beast as that is seen to be? For by
lykelyhood it should come forth to pray upon the land, and there should not be
food enough to suffize him in the water. Also we see what is in his bones, or
in his backebones, which are more than bones: they be (to see to) iron and
steel: and it is a wonder to look upon his flesshinesse. Therefore a man had
need of great riches that should interteyne such a body. And who can sted his
turn but only God? For he has appointed the world too keep him, and therefore
has he provided all things for him. Wherefore, since we see this, let us
learn to submit ourselves to him, or else there shall need none other judges
to condemn us than the brute beasts, another shall there need any other
evidence too cast us, than the creatures that are dispersed through the world,
as well in the waters as upon the land. If we be are away this singleness, it
will stand us in better sted than all the curiouse expositions that can be
devised, as when these Allegorimakers serched out his ribs and backebones,
and treated also of his skin and of this and that, and to be short, there was
not that piece of him, wherein Who is he (says God) that can stand in my
presence? Seeing that no man dares waken up a whale, no nor com near him
(says he:) who is he that dares maynteyne himself before me? This is the
comparison that I have touched already: that is to wit, that if the
creatures (which being nothing of themselves are but a small portion of the
power that is in God,) do astonish us: what will his infinite majesty do?
What is all the whole world in respect of God? It is said that he holds
both heaven and earth, and that he needs that all things are his. For if a
man should say, it is true that a whale is a terrible thing, but God is not so:
Yea, would God answer? and what is a whale but as a dart that I shall cast, or
as a stone out of a sling? Then it behooves us to know, that God has printed
some mark of his power in whales and other great beasts, to the intent that
men should know how that the same proceeds from his hand, and that he
serves his turn with them, to apply them to such use as he lists, insomuch
that a whale ought in our sight to be considered as if God should cast a stone
out of a sling, and the air rang of it, so as we were astonished at it. Seeing
then that all things are so in his hand: we have good cause to tremble before
him. Nevertheless our Lord meeneth not too drive us from him: but yet must we
needs be abashed at the first brunt, to the end we may yield him his
deserved reverence. So then, he calls and allureth us to him, to the intent
that we should find all ioyfulnesse there, but yet can we not come at him, till
we have been utterly beaten down. Therefore there must first go a fear before,
to daunt us in such wise as we may not be able to stand, but may find ourselves
utterly undone and east away, if God should utter his power against us. It
behooves us to know this: and the^ shall all our fear be assuaged, that is to
wit if we hold him for our father. But yet for all that we shall never yield
him his due reverence, except he daunt us and tame us in such wise, us we know
not where to become. That is the thing which we have too remember in this
streyne. And so let us follow this general lesson, that it is impossible for
a mortal creature to stand before God. And how should he stand? For first and
formest he must needs cast us flat to the ground, and afterward set us up
again. But if we will hold our own, and fall to playing the lusty tall ladds:
we shall never bring our purpose to pass, but it shall rather be the cause of
our decay. The word stand then betokens that a man can never have a good
case in maynteyning himself to be ryghtuouse and wise, but must first of all be
utterly disabled, and acknowledge that God has all might, power, and
ryghtuousenesse in him, and that we cannot be but overwhelmed in our own
nature. True it is that God not only would that we should stand, but also
lifts us up above the heavens: not in respect of our bodies as yet, but by
raising us up when we be beaten down. Then let us mark well that there is
great odds between men's desyring to be somewhat of themselves, by taking
upon them to be wise and ryghtuouse, and between utter disclayming of all
goodness, and thereupon to resort unto God, and to pray him to set them in
good state forsomuchas they be utterly bereft of all glory and have nothing in
themselves but shameful confusion. When we have learned this lesson, that no
man is able to stand before God, so as we acknowledge that there is nothing in
us but filthiness and dung, that all the gay likelyhod which we ween
ourselves to have, is nothing but vanity, and that all the opinions which we
have conceived do but beguile us, when we be once thoroughly persuaded of this,
then will God lift us up, and we will think ourselves so beholden too him and too
his mere grace for all things, that we will glorify him as our father, and as
the giver of them unto us, yea even without being bound thereunto, and without
finding any desert in us. And it is a general who will prevent me, and I
will satisfy him? As if he should say, that if we will plead against him,
he must needs be in our det, and be bound unto us, and we must have some
right and interest. And where shall the man be found that may prefer his
title unto God, too say that God is bound unto him? But we see who is ^^
that has prevented me [or been before hand with me] says the Lord? Then let
us mark well that here God bereeueth all mankind of the false and devilish
opinion wherewith they are so besotted, by saying that he is not bound unto us
but we unto him, so as we cannot bring aught unto him, another does he receive
any recompense at our hands by the service that we do unto him, for he has
no need of us. Now we see in effect, that all the wisdom and rightuousenesse
of man is beaten down and brought to nothing. For there are two things that
make us to lift up ourselves against God: the one is when we ween ourselves
to be to wise, and the other is when we think we have some rightuousenesse and
worthiness of ourselves. Howbeit God shows us on the one part, that we may
well pratle and prate: but in the end he will put us to silence well enough.
VVhyso? For what title can we pretend against him? Then let us forbear to be
selfwyse, and learn to be sober and lowely, and let us acquaynt our selves
with Gods works so far forth as he shows them to us, always restreyning
our selves with this bridle, that we pass no further than is showed us in the
holy scripture. If we do so, we shall be guided always by the holy Ghost.
Let us then keep ourselves from saying, O I would feign know such a thing. Let
us not be selfwise in seeking whatsoever we have a mind unto, when we ought not
to know it: but let us be contented with that which is opened too us in the
holy scripture, and specially with the things that may edify us in faith and
the fear of God. will thou hold him in thy service? or will thou put books
into his noze? or will thou play with him as with a spaniell or a bird* It is
to do us to wit, that we be so much the less to be excuzed, if we
acknowledge not our maker, seeing we find our selves confounded in making
comparison between us and a whale. And yet for all that, when men dispute of
Gods woorks, in their own brain, and control him and are not contented with
him if he work not after their lyking: it is all one as if they would
overthrow him. And is that possible? Behold, there is a brute beast which men
cannot tell how to tame. True it is that this comparison is not peculiarly fit
in all respects, another is it requisite that similitudes should match fully and
answerably in every point. But it serves to show, that if a silly beast
which has another reason nor understanding, has such force in him as to make
us afraid of him and to run away: what shall he do which has made and
fashioned all things? Again, if a men dare not waken up a whale: how dares he
step forth to make war with the living God, as all they do which fall to
carping and quareling with him as much as in them lies? Behold, our Lord would
feign show himself gentle and loving toward us: and in very deed we see how
he is willing to bear with our weakness, and we play the madmen and wild
beasts, and fall to carping at him openly, as though we were at defiance with
him. And are we able to abide his presence? Shall it not be much more
terrible to us than the presence of a VVhale? Again, seeing it is said that the
whales do make the deep to see the like a cauldron, and iumble the sea
together like a pot of ointment (according also as it was said of the Elepha^t,
tha^ he would make the River of Jordan to pass through his throat) I pray you
if we were aghast too see a beast at that point too swallowe up houge waters:
how much more aghast ought we to be at the majesty of God? It might seem to
us that the VVhale might be choked in the mids of the waters: and yet
notwithstanding he is so great and houge a beast, as he cutteth the sea
asunder, makes it too boil like a pot with his snorting and neezing and (as
it is termed here) ouerturneth ships, and is like to swallowe up all that
comes in his way: and shall our Lords neezing be no greater than a whales?
Yes, he has a snorting that is spoken of in the Prophet Esaias and also in the
hundred and fourth Psalm, insomuch that if God do but puff or blow upon us,
we must needs be destroyed at the first blast. Seeing then that there is such
terriblenesse in the nozethrils of a beast: what is there in the breath of god
which is the welspring of all power, either to set us up and quicken us, or to
overthrow us and undo us? We see then that these parts are not set down
and touched there without cause, and that these kinds of beasts are not picked
out from all other, but for good instruction: at leastwyse, if we have the
discretion to apply all these things to God, and to make such comparisons as I
have spoken of. VVheras mention is made of the hardness of the whales flesh
and of his bones: it behooves us to come to this consideration: How now? What
shall be become of us if God lift up his hand against us? See how the whale
ouerturneth great ships and drouneth them in the sea, and has not God
bars of iron far harder to strike us down if he list to touch us with
his hand? Now let us go iustle with him [when we will.] Seeing then that we
perceive so well how infinite the power of Gods hand and arm is, specially
when he is armed against us: we may well see that this treating after that sort
of the Whales flesh and bones, is no superfluouse talk. But on the other side
let us consider also, that if a beast have such power in him* insomuch that it
is said of him, that he laugheth at the shaking of spears, and is not afraid
of the sword or of any other weapon: thereby it is showed us, that if we be
armed with the power of our God, we be in good surety, and have no cause to be
afraid or to take thought for any thing. We see that it is God

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgeme^t of
our sins, praying him to make us so to feel how poor and miserable we be,
that upon the knowing of his goodness and love toward us, we may covet
nothing but to yield him his due glory for bestowing so many of his graciouse
benefits upon us, as in that he has made us Lords and Masters of his
creatures here bylowe, which were able to scare us out of our wits, so as we
may not be unthankful for such privilege and prerogative as he has granted
us, but do him homage for all the benefits that we have received at his hand,
waiting to have him increase them, even till he have brought us too the full
perfection. And so let us all say, Almighty God, etc.

The.Clvij. Sermon which is the first upon the.xlij. Chapter.
Job ansvvered the Lord and said.

2 I know that thou can do all things, and that no thought shall be kept
back from thee.

3 Who is he that darkeneth secrets without knovvedge? I spoke and
understood not: these things are vvonderfull above me, I have not known
them.

4 Harken therefore and I will speak* and I will ask of thee to the end thou
may teach me.

5 I have herd of thee with mine ear: and now mine eye has seenethee.


WE saw heretofore the fruit that grew of the declaration which God made
unto Job: and whereas he doubled his words, it appeered more evidently unto
us, how much he profited by that correction. He his fear and love. Or else
without that, we be unsteadfast, and return to our old byasse: and when we
think ourselves to be wholly brought home, it shall be nothing but a smoke that
will vanish away out of hand. Ye see then what we have to bear in mind. Also
according to Jobs example, when we have considered our faults one day, let us
streyne ourselves to know them yet better the next day, and to be the more
grieved at them. For if we think we have discharged our duty with the saying
of one word, or with the conceyuing of some one good thought: we deceive I
know that thou can do all things, and that no thought shall be kept back [
or letted] from thee. Some expound this, as though Job yielded all power and
might unto God, and therwithall also an infinite forecast to provide for all
things and to guide them: as though he should say, Lord I know thou haste al
things in thy hand, and that nothing is hidden from thee, and that thou art
privy to all things. But it is a common of Gods thoughts. We see many
fantastical persons, who when they talk of Gods almightinesse, fall to gazing
at this and that, saying: If God be almighty, why does he not such a thing? If
God be almighty, then can he do this. Yea, but we must not raunge abroad so
after our own imaginacio^s: Gods almightinesse ameth not at our dotages nor at
any common thing. VVhereat the^? Gods almightinesse and his will are things
inseparable. God is almighty: but is it to do whatsoever man has forged in
his brain? No fie: but it is to accomplish whatsoever he has ordained in his
own purpose. So then let us learn to knit these two things together, namely
his almightinesse and his will. And that is the cause why Job said, that no
thought shall be let, kept back or res^reyned from him, that he should not
execute it: not the things that men conceive and determine, (for it is not for
the^ [to have their wills]) but the things that God has ordained and which he
knows to be good. Now we see after what manner Gods almightinesse ought to be
known of us: namely to the end we should not doubt but that al things shall be
done which he shall have determined, not by taking co^sell at our hands, but
because it is at his assignement to appoint what is good to be done,
forsomuchas he is the fountain of al wisdom. For all these things are so in
his hand, as nothing can hinder his accomplishing of whatsoever he has
devised. This will be the better understood by the practicing of it. Such as
blame Gods almightinesse without cause or reason, fall too seeking of by
matters, saying* Why does not God such a thing seeing he is almighty? yea? Is
it for us to make him play tricks to and fro? It belongs to him to determine
and apoint, and afterward to bring it also to pass. Yet notwithstanding, those
[foreward fellowes] take no heed of grau^ting all power unto God, when it
comes to the point that they should trust in him. And yet the very thing
whereunto we should apply Gods almightinesse, is that he will not fail to keep
his promis, and that forasmuch as our welfare is in his hand, we are sure that
none evil can betide us, and that since he has us in his protection, we be out
of doubt that no enemy shall prevail against us. This (say I) is the cause
for which we should mind Gods almightinesse, according as it is showed us
where it is said that no man shall pluck us out of Christ's hand who has taken
us into his keeping. And why? For the father who has committed us to him, is
stronger than al. Why and to what end has Jesus Christ alleged to us the
invincible power of God his father? It is to the end we should be quiet, and
not doubt but he will save us, notwithstanding all the atte^pts that Satan can do
or devise: for God is almighty. Herein we see that we must join Gods
almightinesse with his good will, even such as he shows it to be by his word.
If we be once at that point, we shall not give ourselves the bridle to gaze and
raunge abroad: and yet shall we have also wherewith to beat back the skornes of
such as can find in their hearts to play with Gods almightinesse who is be that
bydeth secrets without knowledge? God has heretofore vpbrayded Job herewith.
And it should seem that Job me^t to confess it to be so in deed, that is to
wit, that he had wrapped up Gods wisdom in his own folish words. For if we
reason of Gods woorks after our own ability, and take I have spoken I wist
not what: these things are mar^elouse above me, and I have not understood
the^. This confirms the thing that I said even now Job confesses that he had
spoken without skill. As how? Because I understood not the things that I spoke
of, says he. It is as much as if he had said, I have put forth my self too
unadvisedly. And why? Because those things were to maruelouse for me, and I
have not known them. And here we have to mark, that the cause why Job
granted himself to be ignorant, is the hyghenesse of the secrets whereof he
would have spoken. God made him to feel his hand, but yet did he not conceive
the cause why he should be so afflicted, and thereupon he entered into these
deep temptations to say, what meeneth this that I am pinched with such
extremity? Cannot God find in his heart to dispatch me out of hand? I would
feign that he had destroyed me. He makes me I spoke I wist not what. But
herewithall it behooves also too be well advised for afterward, and to
practice the forealledged lesson of believing [or of being sure of our matter]
before we speak. And let us beware that we believe not aught, but that
which our God has showed us. So then we must come to this point, that our
faith be grounded upon the word of God, and that the holy Scripture be all
our wisdom. When we be once come to that knowledge* then may we speak, yea
we may speak of the things that pass our understanding, in as much as God
shall have showed us them by faith, as we have said before. Howbeeit, it is
not enough for us too acknowledge our faults: but we must also resort to the
remedy out of hand, according as Job has given us example thereof. For after
he had said he had put forth himself without understanding well what he spoke:
he adds, Hear me and I will speak: I will ask of thee, to the end thou may
teach me. Here Job prete^deth to repress himself, because he saw he had
played the looce colt, in not keeping himself within his bounds. Then his
confessing of his fault is not after the fashion of many men, which think
themselves quite discharged with saying ^^ one word, I have done amiss, and
byandby after return to their old byasse, and are always new to begin: he
does not so: but he says, Lord, seeing there has been such foolish rashness
in me, and that I have so far ouershot hear me, I will speak, his meening
is not too crave audience to speak what he lists (for he had done so to
much already): but he excuses himself in saying immediately that his
questioning with God shall be to be taught at his hand. Therefore let us mark,
that there are Hear me, and I will speak, I will ask of thee to the intent
to be taught. If we come to God to learn at his hand: it behooves us too
yield our selves teachable. And what is the first point of teachablenesse? It
is that we take him for our master and obey him fully in any thing that he
shall list to tech us. For when a young child co^mes first to school, if he will
needs chooze his books after his own lyking, to say, I will learn such a
science, or I will be taught such a thing or such a thing, before he have
gone to his Apcee, so as he will be a great Doctor, before he have the mean
whereby to be taught, or be come to the place where learning is to be had: I
pray you is that a scholerlyke modesty? But if a scholar that takes a man to
teach him, ought to submit himself wholly to him: what ought we to do to God?
What comparison is there in that case? So then let us mark well, that if we
desire unfeignedly to be taught of God, we will not follow our own lusts, to
say that he should show us whatsoever we have conceived in our own head:
but we will hold us contented with that which he knows to be for our
welfare: and too discern that it belongs unto him. And for that cause Job
concludes, that heretofore he had heard speaking of God, but now he had
seen him with his eye. As if he had said, Lord, it is true that heretofore
I have heard speaking of thy majesty, but now I know it after another
manner: and that is to the end to submit myself wholly unto thee. Job
makes comparison here between the knowledge that he had had before, and
the Revelation wherein God opened himself so manyfestly unto him, that he was
utterly abashed and touched with such fear, as he could do nothing but
glorify God, as we see he does. Howbeit, it ought too suffyze us too have
heard God spoken of: for thereof also proceeds knowledge. Faith (says Saint
Paul) comes by heering. And faith brings us perfect wisdom, as it is
said in another place. And what desire we more, than to know that we be the
children of God? and that is known by faith, as Saint John says in his
Canonical Epistle. And again S. Paul says in the first to the Corinthians,
that by faith we enter into Gods secrets, yea eue^ into the deepest of them.
For his spirit dwells in us, too warrant

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God with acknowledgeme^t of
our faults, praying him to make us feel them more and more, to the end we may
come to him with true repentance, and he not suffer his daily calling upon us
(as well by the doctrine that is preached to us in his Gospel, as by the
corrections that he sends us,) too be unprofitable to us, but that we may
learn to be confirmed more and more in the feeling of our sins, so as we
may crave forgiveness of them at his hand, and seek the remedy of them in
his goodness, and therewithal desire altogether to be taught in his schole,
and to yield our selves teachable unto him, even till he have rid us of our
ignorance, and stripped us quite and clean out of all the vain trusts wherein
we be wrapped as now. That it may please him to grant this grace, not only
too us, etc.

The.Clviij. Sermon, which is the second upon the.xlij. Chapter.
6 Therefore I abhor it, and I repent in dust and ashes.

7 After that the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, he said unto Eliphas
the Themanite: my wrath is kindled against thee, and upon thy two companions:
for ye have not spoken rightly before me as has my servant Job.

8 Therefore take ye seven Oxen and seven sheep, and get ye to my servant
Job, and offer sacrifize for your selves: and my servant Job shall pray for
you: and I will accept his face, to the end that your folly be not laid to
your charge: for you have not spoken rightly concerning me, as has my servant
Job.


WE saw yesterday what it is too perceive Gods presence and to be touched with
his glory, because that without that, it is impossible for me^ to come to good
order, whatsoever be said unto them. For either they possible too be vncaced
out of that old skin wherein he is wrapped. This is the true trial of our
repentance. And herin we see how shameless they are which say they be
repentant, and yet a man cannot get one word out of their mouth, that shows
any token of lowelinesse: but they are so far off from intending to yield
themselves with their whole hearts unto God, and from indeuering to make amends
for the offenses which they have done: that they will still maynteyne
themselves in their wickedness. But put the case that a man acknowledge his
fault: yet is it nothing that he will repent him in dust and ashes. As if he
should say that he is ready to yield himself as a wretched offender unto God.
For a man may well repent him without putting of sackloth upon his back, and
without casting of dust upon his head. Nevertheless, the men of old time used
those ceremonies, when they intented to make solemn protestation, that they
were utterly condemned before God, and that there was no remedy for the^, but
that God should be graciouse to the^ as to miserable offenders. Therefore let us
mark well, that Job speaks not here of us from making amends for the offense
which we have given by our doing amiss. Hereupon it is said, that God
after he had spoken unto Job, turned himself to Eliphas the Themanite, and
said unto him: My wrath is kindled against thee and thy companions: for ye
have not spoken rightly before me as my servant Job has done. We have seen
heretofore that God found fault with Job: and now secondarily he finds fault
with his companions, yea and that much more roughly. Before we come to the
comparison that is made here between Job and his friends: we that God having
spoken those words unto Job turned his talk to those that had wrongfully
condemned him. Hereby we be warned, that although God chastize his own with
fatherly ge^tlenesse: yet notwithstanding he executes his Justice thoroughly
upon them: according as it is said that his punishments or chastizements begin
at his own house or Church. Ye see then that God rebukes Job, and in the
mean while lets the other alone which had offended more grossly than he A
man might dema^d here, yea, is that Job spoke rightly before God. How was
that? For God notwithstanding condemned him as an ignorant, ouerweening, and
impatient person. And where is then the said rightnesse (I have told you
heretofore how Job had vndertake^ a good case, howbe it he proceeded amiss in
it. Job therefore ouershot himself in the following of his matter, but yet for
all that, his case was good still. Co^rrariwise Jobs friends used goodly reasons
and such as we have gathered holy doctrine out of: but yet was the ground
work of them evil. They took a general ground quite besides the case which
was, that Job was punished for his misdeeds, and that he was to be taken for a
wicked and cursed creature, seeing that God used such rigor toward him.
Furthermore also they did set down a false and untoward doctrine: saying that
God does even in this world handle me^ according to their deserts. But that
were as much as to take away the hope of the everlasting life, and to shet all
fauorablenesse of God out of this frail and transitory life: and that were a
turning of al things vpside down. And therefore it behooves us too call these
two points to remembrance, that we may know the ryghtnesse that is spoken of
here. And to be short, we must note the text that I have alleged out of the
Psalm heretofore, namely that the man is blissed which judges discretly of the
poor that is in adversity: where the Prophet shows us that when we see
any man in adversity, Gods will is, that we should have the discreetnesse,
not to condemn him at the first dash, but to look up higher: that is to wit,
[to consider] that adversities do sometimes befall men for the chastizement of
their sins: sometime for the trial of their patience: sometime to prevent
some faults which they might fall into: and also that God sets the^ forth
to be as mirrours, to the end that we seeing their obedience might be edified
thereby: and sometimes for some other secret causes unknown to us. Therefore let
us eschew rashness when we see God afflict any man roughly, and let us not be
to swift of judgment to say that he is worthy to be so handled, and to
commend such as live at their ease, as though they were better beloved of that
Job has spoken ryghtly, and his friends amiss: it behooves us to take this
general rule, that when a man is in forewardnesse to follow God and to fear
him, the same shall be accepted, notwithstanding that he commit gross faults:
whereas if another man have not the true fear of God rooted in him, although
he have apparent virtues that are very commendable before men, yet is all of it
nothing worth, it is but stark filth. Look (I say) upon a man that fears
God, and is rightly and purely minded too give ergo we deserve to Godward and
have pure and right hearts to come unto him. Alas whereof comes this
rightnesse? deserve we such a co^mendacion at the mouth of our God? And he
might also condemn us a hundredthousand times without showing us any favor.
Howbeeit forasmuchas he wypeth out our faults and forgets the^, and
inte^deth not to have any regard of them: therefore accepts he us for
rightuouse. And therefore in this case let us acknowledge only his mere mercy
and goodness, and let us honor him for the same. And furthermore, seeing it is
said that our Lord is contented with us, and accepts the things for good and
commendable, which notwithstanding are defiled: and that although there be much
amiss and many great faults and imperfectio^s in our works, and that we
deserve to be abhorred of God, because we can bring nothing to him of our own,
but filthiness, yet notwithstanding he accepts and receives those works
which are so stained with vices, as a sacrifise of sweet sent: we ought to
take courage to do well. For seeing it is so, ought we not to be the more
inflamed to serve and honor him. Ye see then what we have to mark in this
verse. But by the way let us mark also, that we may well do heroical acts (as
men term them) and behave ourselves as virtuously and courteously as can be
deuized, and men may carry us upon their shoulders, and yet all this shall be
nothing, except we have a lively root in our hearts, and be desirouse to serve
God, as the mark that we have taken to shoot at. It were much better to go the
right way limping, than to make great leapes and yet be never the further
foreward: yea, or to make great shows, and in the mean while too have our
hearts snarled in all wicked affections. Then let us beware that we covet not
that God sends Eliphas and his companions unto Job, and commands the^ to
offer sacrifices, and says that Job shall find grace to the end that their
sins may be forgiven them. Here first of all we have to mark, that although
God rebuke Eliphas and his companions after that manner: yet he would not drive
them quite away: and that although condemnation were pronounced upon them, yet
was it not to the end they should suffer it, so as they should lie still
there, utterly thrown down without remission. There are then two sorts of
condemnation which God pronounces upon men: and of those two, the first may
also be divided intoo other two. Generally God condemns us, either to the
end to acquit us when he shall have found us too be humbled: or else to
destroy us utterly, as he does the unbelievers. Yet notwithstanding there are
two sorts of condemnation which are to our welfare. The one is of such as are
already faithful, whom God chastizeth daily. For although God account us of
his household, and that we be fully reconciled to him: yet have we need to
be condemned, and to be stirred up thereby continually more and more, that we
may be ashamed of our selves, and be sorry and hate our sins, and seek the
remedy of them, to the end to magnify his mercy the more, which he shows
to us in that we obtain forgiveness at his hand. Thus ye see there is a
condemnation which god lays upon his chosen, notwithstanding that they be at
one with him, and he has taken them into his flock. And there is yet another
condemnation which is healthful also, and that is of such as are after a sort
strangers from gods Church, and have none acquaintance with him, according as
we see how he condemned Saint Paul at such time as he was a persecuter. And
even in the person of Saint Paul we may the better understand the thing
which I intend too say, for if I should allege two several persons, the
thing would not be so easy to be understood. Behold, Saint Paul was so
wicked a man, as ye would have thought he had been utterly past recovery:
and yet was he one of Gods chosen. He was marked out before hand from his
mothers womb to be an Apostle: and yet notwithstanding he seemed not to be
of Gods Church, but rather an utter enemy too it. Neuerthelater God condemned
him when he did beat him down, and rid him of the pride wherewith he was
inflamed before, and made him in that case as a poor slave. That burden was
very heavy too him, and it was a condemnation too him: yea, but yet was it to
his welfare. It was meet that the same pride of his should be subdued and
beaten down, by force. Ye see then how it was a healthful condemnation, but
yet was it of a man utterly estraunged from God, and which seemed to be quite
past hope of recovery. Now after that Saint Paul was once condemned after
that fashion, and thereby brought into the fold of Gods flock, so as he
became a sheep, yea and therwithall also a shepherd, and was not only one of
the lambs of Jesus Christ, but also a shephearde of his flock: yet behooved it
him to be condemned again. As how? God buffeted him. For he says that God
gave Satan leave too give him buffets, as it were in way of reproach, too the
intent he should not exalt himself by reason of the highness of the
Revelations which God had given him, and it behooved him too have that
counterpoyson too drive out the poison of pride, and keep him from it. Thus
we see in Saint Paul's person, that there are two manners of condemning which
are too our welfare. We see the like in this present place, where Jobs
friends be condemned to their own salvation. For thereby God opens them
the gate, and shows them that they may hope for pardon, if they come too him
with true repentance. But yet does he draw back from them, so as he comes
not familiarly unto them as he did to Job, neither grants he them access
and entrance unto him, but by the mean that is expressed here: that it too
wit, that Job should make intercession for them. Here therefore we see two
diverse examples of Gods mercy. And Sacrifizes:

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our faults, praying him too clenze us more and more from them, and that
whenever we be rebuked by him, he will therwithall make us too feel his
fatherly goodness. so as we may have whereof to take comfort in our
aduersityes, and not be grieved though he begin too chastize us, and in the
mean while spare the wretched unbelievers: knowing that by that means he
declares too us, that seeing he has chosen us to himself, he will not have
us too ^^rishe. And therefore [let us pray him] that he suffer not his rods
to be unprofitable to us, so as we should abide still hardened in our sins:
but that he will draw us to him thoroughly, that we may with all lowliness
acknowledge our sins, and be sorry for them in our hearts: yea and also
protest before men how much we be bound unto his mercy, to the end that our
neighbors may be edified by us, and one of us draw another to the glorifying of
him in all our whole life: and for the doing hereof, it may please him to
stir up true, etc.

The.Clix. Sermon, which is the third upon the.xlij. Chapter.
This Sermon is yet still upon the eight verse, and then upon the Text ensuing.

9 Then Eliphas the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the
Naamathite, went and did as God had commanded: and the Lord received the
face of Job.

10 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends,
and he blissed the latter state of Job more than the first.

11 And all his brethren, and all his sisters came unto him, and all they that
had bin of his acquaintance before: and they are with him in his house, and
had compassion of him, and comforted him, of all the adversity which the Lord
had caused to come upon him: and he received of each of them a piece of silver,
and of each of them an ornament of gold.

12 And the Lord blissed the latter state of Job more than the first, insomuch
that he had.xiiij. thousand sheep, six thousand Camels, a thousand yoke of
oxen, and a thousand Sheeasses.

13 Also he had seven sons and three daughters.

14 And he called the name of one, Iemima, and the name of another, Kezia: and
the name of the third, Kerenhapuk.

15 And there were not found more fairer women in all the Country, than
Jobs daughters: and their father gave them in heritance among their brethren.

16 And after these things, Job lived a hundred and forrie years, and he savv
his sons and his sons unto the fourth generation.

17 And he died aged and full satisfied with days.


We have seen how God in rebuking Jobs friends, would not leave them
hopeless, but called them to to bring their sacrifices to Job, to the end that
he should pray for them: and that was too humble them. For although God show
himself gentle and welminded toward us: yet have we need that Job should
pray for those that had offended: But yet notwithstanding, it is not to be
doubted, but that as well by the sacrifices as by Jobs person, God meant too The
very Heathen men have also followed the same: but they understood not to what
end: [and therfore] it was but only a witness against themselves.
Nevertheless it was Gods will to leave a president through the whole world,
where by me^ should acknowledge that there was nothing but damnation in
themselves, and that they could not be rid of it, except their sins were
blotted out by making some ame^des. But now have we the truth of it reveled
unto us in the Gospel: which is, that as often as we pray before God, we must
have our recourse too the to the end I do no folly unto you, (for so is it
word for word in the text:) that manner of speech would be somewhat with the
hardest. But if we mark what is written in the eightenth Psalm, we shall
have a plain and easy declaration of this saying. It is said that God will
handle men according as he finds them. With the froward (says he) I
will deal frowardly. This may seem very strange: nevertheless, to the end
I do no folly with you: as though our Lord should say, too the end that I
handle you not according too your folly and frowardness: for the word
imports that also. Too the intent then that I execute not my vengeance upon
you, that is to say, to the intent I handle you not after such fashion as you
have deserved: look that ye go to my servant Job. This is according to that
which I have said already: namely that forasmuch as Jobs they did as God had
commanded them. And herein we see how men are changed when God speaks to
them effectually, not only by making that God received the face of Job, and
turned his captivity, or was turned at his repentance, when he prayed for his
friends. Seeing it is so that God regarded the face of Job, and accepted his
prayer, for so much as he had appointed him to be a pr^est: I pray you have not
we a much better certentie, seeing our everlasting Advocate who is entered
into the Sanctuary of heaven, that is to wit our Lord Jesus Christ, shall
never be refuzed, nor we neither if we come to God his father by his means,
holding evermore the way and furtherance that he has given us? Behold, Job
was a poor man, and even entering into the high way to blaspheme God: and
although he did hold himself in patience in the winding up, yet had he such
pangues as made him to fling over the feeldes, in so much that he o^fended God
grievously, as I have declared heretofore: and yet for all that, when God
enjoined him that office of praying, he heard him: not only for himself, but
also for strangers, yea and for such as had been his enemies, and were as
good well near as separated from God. For they had utterly perverted his
word, and beaten down and destroyed the hope of the endless life that is to
come, as I have said before: and yet notwithstanding, Job obteyneth grace for
them. Now if it be said that God made that thing auaylable which was but a
little dim shadow: what shall be done now that he has appointed his own
only son to be the Priest, and commanded him, not too offer up Goats and
Calves that God made Jobs captivity to tuine, or was turned at his repentance:
for so may the words be taken. But the playnest translation is, that he
turned Jobs captivity, so as the anguish wherein he was, was taken away: or
else, his captivity, that is to say, his cattle and substance [that had been
taken away from him] were restored again. But howsoever it was, it betokens
that in the end God had pity upon his servant. Yea and it is purposely
expressed to have come to pass, when Job prayed for his freindes, that is too
say, for those that had persecuted him, as we have seen before. And herein we
see that if we love our enemies, and procure their welfare and salvation: it
shall be to our own benefit and profit, and God will make the blessing to
return upon us. We be diverse times afraid least we should be too
gentle and kind hearted when men have offended us: and this devilish Proverb,
that if a man play the sheep, the woolfe will eat him up, is too much
practiced. That is the cause why we be so wedded to our own revenge, when
men have troubled us or done us any wrong. It seems to us that in forgiving,
we be laid open to all reproach, and that our enemies will take the more
boldness at it against us. But it behooves us to let all those fancies go: for
God has taken the charge of us himself, and has given us a good Shephearde,
even our Lord Jesus Christ, who has promised too keep us. And furthermore
let us mark well, that when we pray for such as vex us, the same blissing
will light upon us. If it please God that it take place: it is very well:
whereas they were enemies before, now they shall be our brethren. And if they
continue wilful in their malice, yet will our Lord make all the requests to
redounde to our selves, which we shall have made for the^. Thus ye see why it is
purposely said, that God looked mercifully upon Job, when he had prayed for
those that had so misvsed him, as we have seen. And so it behooves us to call
to mind how S. James says, you have heard of the patience of Job, and seen
what end and issue God gave him. Now he shows us that the afflictions which
God sends upon his children, last but a while, and that the end of them is
right happy, so as it is far better for them to be so afflicted for a time,
than to live always at their ease. For if God should spare them to much, there
were not that man which would not fall asleep in this world: We should no
more know what obedience were: the lusts of our flesh would play the reslife
iades: and we would think upon nothing but this present transitory life.
Therefore let us understand, that when God afflicts his faithful ones,
first it is not of purpose to press them to the vttermoste: for he knows
what they be able too bear: and Saint Paul says accordingly, that
forasmuch as God is faithful, he will not suffer us to be tempted beyond
that which we be able to bear. And furthermore he shows in the end, that we
have cause to wish to be so beaten with Gods scourges, according as David
says, Lord it was good for me that thou did chastise me. Insomuch that we
may always glory in our adversities and corrections. That is the thing which
it behooves us too mark in this streyne. For it is not for Jobs sake that this
was written, that God blissed his latter state more than his first, that he
doubled his goods and substance which were very great before, that he gave
him sons and daughters, and that he lengthued his life, so as he saw the
children that came of his own race unto the fourth generation, after he had
seen himself at so low an ebb. True it is that here the holy ghost meant too
leave a memorial of the gracious goodness that God showed upon the person of
Job: howbeit, that was not for his instruction, but for ours. Then is it not
without cause that Saint James has set us down that scarce knew how auaylable
Gods favor is too help us at our need, does in affliction see that God
strengthens him in such wise by his holy spirit, that he bears the
affliction meekly: and when he is delivered, then knows he that god did put
to his hand: and thereupon he gathers that seeing god has assisted him for
one bru^t, he will never fail him after. If we had none other thing but that on
the one side we see the help that God gives us: and secondly that he works
in us by his holy spirit, to the intent we should not quail: and finally
shows us by experience (...) of Jobs daughters: for in effect the scripture
me^t to betoke^, that God made him to prosper in such wise to the worldward,
as we may see with our eyes that he favored him, yea even beyond the common
rate. And let us not think it ^^^aunge, that God would in those days utter
his love toward the faithful, by earthly and transitory prosperity. For
the heavenly life was not then so perfectly to take knowledge of gods fatherly
love thereby: for if you lived but three days in this world, it were enough to
give us a taste of Gods goodness and mercy, and to confirm our faith. For
seeing that our Lord Jesus Christ has died and is rise again, we need no long
time in this world to know that God is our father, and that we be sure of our
salvation. Therefore as soon he gives us knowledge of the truth of his
Gospel, let us always be ready too die, assuring our selves that he has
adopted us for his children, and that he will show himself our father both in
life and

Now let us fall down before the face of our good God, with acknowledgement of
our sins, praying him too vouchsafe to touch us with them more and more, that
we may come to him with true repentance to frame our selves after his
righteousness: and that for as much as we be wretched sinners; and wrapped and
overwhelmed in so many temptations as it is impossible for us too discharge our
selves of the hundredth part of our duty, it may please him too aid us with
his holy spirit, and too bear with our infirmities and imperfections, until
he have quite and clean rid us of them. And so let us al say, Almighty God
heavenly father, etc.

All praise, honor and thanks be unto God.
The prayer which master John Calvin made ordinarily before the beginning of
his Sermons.
LEt us call upon our good God and father, praying him too vouchsafe to turn
away his face from the great number of faults and offenses, whereby we cease
not too provoke his wrath against us: and forasmuch as we be too too
unworthy to appear before his majesty, it may please him too look upon us
in the countenance of his well-beloved son our Lord Jesus Christ, accepting
the desert of his death and passion, for a full recompense of all our sins,
that by means thereof he may likevvell of us, and vouchsafe too enlighten us by
his spirit, in the understanding of his vvoo^^, and grant us the grace to
receive the same in true fear and humility, so as we may be taught th(...)y
to put our trust in him, too serve and honor him by glorifyng his holy name in
all our life, an(...) yield him the love and obedience which faithful
servants owe to their masters, and children (...) their fathers, seeing it
has pleased him to call us too the number of his servants and children. And
(...) us pray unto him as our good master has taught us to pray, saying. Our
father.

The Prayer that Master John Calvin ordinarily made at the ending of this
Sermons.
LEt us fall down before the face of our good God, etc. (Here he adds as
the matter treated of (...) sermon, gives him occasion to require at Gods
hand, and because the same changes almost in every Sermon, it cannot here be
specified.) That it may please him too grant this grace, not only too us, but
also too all people and nations of the earth, bringing back all poor ignorant
souls from the mis(...)le bondage of error and darkness, too the right way
of salvation, for the doing vvherof, it may please him to raise up true and
faithful ministers of his word, that seek not their own profit and
vainglorie, but only the advancement of his holy name, and the vvelfare of his
flock: and c^^^rarivvise roo^^ out al sects, errors and heresies, which are
seeds of trouble and division among his (...), to the (...) we may live in
good brotherly concord all together: and that it may please him to guide with
his h^ly spirit, all kings, princes, and magistrates that have the rule of
svvord, to the end that their (...)ning be not by covetousness, cruelty,
tyranny, or any other evil and disordered affection, but i^ justice and
vprigthnesse, and that we also living under them, may yield them their due
honor a^ obedience, that by the mean of good peace and quietness we may
serve god in all holiness and ho^estie: and that it may please him to comfort
all afflicted persons, whom he visits after diverse ma^ners with crosses and
tribulations: all people whom he afflicts with plague, war or famin^ or
other his rods: and all persons that are smitten with poverty, imprisoment,
sickness, banishment or other calamity of body or vexation of mind: giving
them all good patience, till he send them full discharge of their miseries: and
specially that it may please him too have pity upon all his poor faithful
ones, that are dispersed in the captivity of Babylon, under the tyranie of
Antichrist, chiefly which suffer persecution for the witnessing of his truth,
strengthening them with true constancy, and comforting them, and not suffering
the wicked and ravening wolves too execute their rage against them, but
giving them such a true steadfastness as his holy name mayebe glorified by them
both in life and death: and finally that it may please him to strengthen all
Churches that are novvadayes in danger and assaulted for the quarrel of his
holy name, and overthrow and destroy all the devises, practices and attemptes
of all his adversaries, too the intent that his glory may shine over all, and
the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ be increased and advanced more and
more: Let us pray him for all the said things in such wise as our good master
and Lord Jesus Christ has taught us to pray, saying: Our father, etc.

ALso let us pray our good God to give us true continuance in his holy faith,
and to increase it from day to day, whereof we will make confession, saying:
I believe in God the father, etc.

The blissing of the people after the Sermon.
THe grace of God the father and the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ through
the fellowship of the holy Ghost dvvell with us for ever.

Amen.
