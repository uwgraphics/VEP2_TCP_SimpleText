A SATYR AGAINST COFFEE.
AVoid, Satanick Tipple! hence
Thou Murderer of Farthings, and of Pence;
And Midwife to all false Intelligence!
Avoid, I say, of Hell thou art,
For God no liquor does to man impart,
But that which quenches Thirst, or chears the Heart.
Baked in a pan, Brewed in a pot,
The third device of him who first begot
The Printing Libels, and the Powder Plot.
A Swill that needs must be accursed,
And of all sorts of Drink the very worst,
By which the Devils Children (Lies) are nursed.
Now if I fancy not amiss,
Vespatian, who imposed Excise on Piss,
Would for no smell of Lucre suffer this.
The Sister of the common Sewer,
That passes through the Reins with Streams impure;
That Robs the Vintner and undoes the Brewer.
For by this poor Arabian Berry,
Comes the Neglect of Malago and Sherry,
And sooty Surges rise to Charon's Ferry.
The Sweat of Negroes, Blood of Moors,
The Blot of Sign-post, and the Stain of doors,
And the last Shift of Publicans and Whores.
Give over you Whifflers then! enough;
Convert your Powder into Irish Snuff,
And lay your Lace upon some richer Stuff.
