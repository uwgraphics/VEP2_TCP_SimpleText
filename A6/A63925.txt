By me JOHN TURNER, Prisoner of our Lord Jesus Christ (committed by the
Bishops) near 14 years, for affirming Christ Jesus has left in his written
Word sufficient direction to order h^s Church and Children in h^s worship: So
that nothing may be done, over nor above nor besides what is commanded therein
by a Precept and Example or a true gathered consequence; which I dare not but
affirm, though I die for the same. And now delivered, (as abusively Imprisoned
all this time) by the most Honorable Lords in Parliament, 1641.
1 Cor. 15.57 Thanks be unto God which has given us victory, through our Lord
Jesus Christ.
