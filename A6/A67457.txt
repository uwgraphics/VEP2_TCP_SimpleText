AN ABSTRACT of a Treatise concerningthe payment of Tithes and Oblations in
London.
CHAP. I. A Historical narration of the payment of Tithes and Oblations from
the time of ROGER NIGER Bishop of London, about the year 1230. till the 37. of
HENRY the 8.
BY the Custom of London, the Parish Churches were anciently endowed with
certain Oblations, viz. one Farthing of every ten shillings rent of all Houses,
Shops, etc. to be offered by the Parishioners upon every Sunday, and upon
every solemn and double feast, especially and by names of the Apostles whose
Eeves were fasted: Which offerings coming to more then a tenth part of the
rent, L^ndw^o^ lib 3 tit de De^mis cap. sanct. Ec^l. verbo.

Negoti^tionem ^ol. 103.


were paid in lieu of prediall tithes of the Houses, and in recompense of the
want of Gleabe, as appears at large by Lindwood and by other Records hereafter
mentioned.

The Citizens neglecting to pay the said Offerings or Tithes to their own
Curates, and giving part thereof to the Dominicans and Franciscans, who were
lately come over and began to Preach here, and draw people after them, Roger
Niger Constitu^ion about Anno H 3 1230. Book of Common Customs of London,
fol. 18. Dr. Tildsley, in Prefat. contra Seldom.
a Constitution was made about the year 1230. by Roger Niger Bishop of London
(authoritate ordina^ia) commanding all to pay to their own Curates, as is
before expressed, Et prout long retroactis temporibus consuetum extiterat.

After this when Rents increased, the Citizens refused to pay, if the rent came
to above 40. s. per annum, Arundels Constitution, anno 1397.21. R. 2. extant in
the Office. Lib. Arundell, fol. 1. and in the book of Common Customs.
pretending that no more was intended by Nigers constitution. Whereupon a
constitution was made by Thomas Arundell Archbishop of Canterbury, declaring
the ^ormer, viz. That they should pay the said offerings or tithes to
whatsoever summethe rent should amount; and this sub paena majoris
Excommunicationis.

These Constitutions were confirmed by Pope Innocent the 7th in his Bull dated
in May 1406. Et pontificatus Anno secundo, Pope Innocents Bull in the book of
Customs.
and all defects supplied, if any were.

After this the Citizens pretending a copy of Roger Nigers constitution (which
was adjudged afterward to be spurious) would pay only on Sundays, Anno
1453. 3^ Hen. 6. Pope Nich. Bull recited at large in the Book of Customs,
fol. 19, 20, 21. etc
and the Apostles days, not on the other solemn and double Feasts; Whereupon
Robert Wright of St. Edmunds Lumbard-street was cited before the Ordinary, and
sentence given against him, and upon appe^le, first to the Popes Commissary,
and after to the Pope himself, the sentence was twice affirmed, and upon the
Letters of King Henry the 6. Pope Nicholas the 2. sent out his Bull commanding
the Citizens to pay upon all the said Feasts, authorizing the Ordinaries to
enquire hereof at the Visitations and to curse the offenders, 7. Idus Aug. and
Pontif. anno 7.

The same year before the Bull was received, An award 31* H. 6. mentioned in
the Act of Common Council, 31. H. 6. and recited at large in the book of
Customs.
an award or Composition was made by eight arbitrators, wherein some days are
left out which are appointed by the Bull, the whole offering in 52. Sundays
and 22. Holidayes, amounting to 3. s. j. d. in the pound, which award was
agreed by Act of Common Council, 31. H. 6.

After this (by Act of Common Council) the Citizens bind themselves in all
things to obey the Bull of Pope Nicholas, Act of Common Counc^ll, 31. H. 6.
according to which they paid for so many days that the Tithe or oblation
amounted to 3. s. 6. d. in the pound, Bull received by Act of Common Council
14. Edw. 4. 3. Martij 1474, 3. ^. ^. d. in the pound.
14. d. in the Noble, 1. s. 9. d. in the half pound, and not long after in
regard it was troublesome to offer every day in time of divine service, by
mutual consent the same was paid either once at Easter, or quarterly by the
name of oblations or Tithes, ^s appears by the Decimary of St. Magnus Anno
1494, about 7. Hen. 7. in the Book of Common Customs, and by sundry suites
and sentences in the Arches, and by the Bill of the Parsons exhibited to the
common Counsel 19. Hen. 8. remaining on Record in the Guild Hall, and by
Records of a suite in Star Chamber 25. Hen. 8.

Upon occasion of sentence gi^en in the Arches, 18. Hen. 8. against Robert
Hearne of St. Mildreds Poultry for 14. d. in the Noble, the Citizens complain
in Common Counsel, that the Curates took above the rate appointed by the
Bull, viz. 14. d. in the Noble, whereas they should have nothing, unless the
rent came to 10. s. and so ascending from ten shillings to 10. s. and not
under, Acts of Common Counsel A^^o 1^. and 20. H. 8. in the Guild Hall.
and also they sent Bills to every Church, showing what days should be paid
for, according to which computation of theirs the Tithes came to 3. s. 5. d. in
the pound, which was 1. d. less then formerly, and they order that nothing
should be paid for any sum under 10. shillings, and desire that the Bull may
be published in English 4 times a year, as was pr^scribed, and had bin
disused, An. 25. H. 8. when the Popes power was abrogate, some Citizens
pretending they should run into a praemunire, by obeying the Bull; refused to
pay either according to the Bull, or to any former constitution or custom, and
put up a Bill in Star Chamber against some parsons that sued in the Spiritual
Court, praying that they might pay only two shillings in the pound (as other
Parishes without the liberties did) in which suit after publication, both
parties submitted the cause to the Lords, who ordered the Tithe to be only 2
s. 9. d. in the pound, and 16 d. ob. in the half pound, dividing the
controverted Sum viz. 18. d. per pound, O. de^ for 2^. 9 d. 25. H. 8.
by abating 9. d. of what the Clergy would have, and adding 9 d. more then the
Citizens could have paid.

This Order was confirmed by the Kings Letters Pattents, Letters pattents and
Proclamations
Apr. 2.25. Hen. 8. and by Proclamation upon pain of fine and imprisonment, at
the Kings pleasure, and by diverse Acts of Common Counsel made the same year,
and remaining upon Record in the Guild Hall.

The same was confirmed by Act of Parliament 27. Hen. 8. to continue till some
other order should be made by the 32 persons to be chosen for reforming
Ecclesiastical Laws; and by this Act the Major has power to commit such
Citizens, as refuse to pay according to such order. Act of Parliam^nt 27. H. 8,


According to this Order, diverse sentences passed in the E^clesiasticall
Courts, upon emergent controversies of one for the Parson of St. Dunstans last,
for tithe of Wharfes and C^anes, which sentence was given in the Arches 30. H.
8. by a Doctor of Law, especially delegated from the King.

Another for tithe of shops, divided from houses, for the Parson of St. Magnus
in the same Court.

Anno 35. H. 8. new controversies arising about Brew-houses, Dy-houses, Cranes,
etc. a Bill was put up in Parliament by the City, In a little trea^is^ of
tithes of London, entit^led 36, H. 8. by a Citizen.
which passed the Commons, but was stayed by the Lords, containing among other
things, that for new buildings, no Tithes be paid, so long as the Owner lived
therein himself; but if they were let out, then to pay the Tithe as other
houses: and that all Tithes should be recovered by process in the spiritual
Court, or Action of debt at the Common Law, and no otherwise.

Anno 37. Hen. 8. for composing all differences, an Order or award was made by
certain Lords, Decree 37, H. 8 Act of Parliament 37 H. 8.
which is the decree now in question, and an Act of Parliament passed, that
such order as the Lords Referrees, or any 6 of them should make before the
first of March then next following, and enrolled in Chancery, should stand as
an Act of Parliament, and bind the said p^rties, their heirs and successors
for ever. Act in the Bish^ps R^s^^gry,
This Decree was made by the Lords, Feb. 24, 1545. which was delivered the next
day to the Bishop of London, who the some day caused his Register to endorse an
Act on the back side thereof, testifying his receipt thereof from the Lords, and
his comm^nd to the Register to keep it safely, causing diverse persons to
attest the same.

This last Decree or award is now extant among the statutes, but the order of
25. H. 8, and the Procl^mation thereupon, which are still of as much force as
the other, and more beneficial to the Clergy, being not extant in print, are
hereafter added, taken out of authentic Records. After this in the time of
King Ed. 6. The citizens still neglecting to pay their tithes, order was given
by the K. and his Counsel to By. Bonner among other instructions, when he was
appointed to preach at Paul's Cross, to cause the Citizens to pay their tithes
better. Aug. 11. 3. Ed. 6. as appears in Fox his Monuments, fol. 1187. Vol. 2.
Col. 2 Artic. 5. After this, about the middle of Q. Eliz. reign, the rents of
Houses being inhanced, as the pric^s of all other things were, diverse devices
were found out, to prevent and defraud the Parsons of their Tithe, by reserving
the vent under other na^es, as annual and quarterly fine^, du^ing the lease
annuities, new years gifts, interest monyes, rent for impleme^ts, and household
stuff, and by double lea^es, and the like,
of which grievances they have often complained, and by these means are so
many of the beneficies so poor, as we shall show cap. vlt.

CHAP. II. The liberal maintenance of the Clergy of London, before the 25. of
Hen. 8. by Tithe of 3. s. 6. d. in the pound, according to the true value of
houses, the cheapnesse of those times, conscientiousnesse in paying Pe^sonal
Tithes, duties of Weddings, Burials, Churchings, etc. Chauntries, obits, etc.
WE see then the nature of these payments. Now that it may appear how well
the parochial Clergy of London were provided, for in former times, in
comparison of ours; we may consider these particulars.

Prout locari poterant) as it is in the Bull of Pope Nichol^s, and in the award
of 31. H. 8. above mentioned. Now if the payment of 2. s. 9. d. be thought so
much, if it should be truly paid without fraud, that nothing is more
o^jected, then that the Ministers would have too much, and be too rich; what
think they of 3. s. 6. d. in the pound, which was duly paid, as will be made
clear with out any contradiction?

Hence it is in part: That the Benefices in London came to be so highly rated
and valued in the Exchequer, some at 100. marks some at 70. pound, and upwards,
diverse at 30. and 40. pounds: and few under 20 l. or thereabouts, when as yet
the Tithe of diverse of them, is not at this day above 20 l. or 30 l. and some
scant so much in present ^ythes, as they were then taxed; and whereas other
livings in the Country are generally improved (where they are not kept down by
unconscionable Customs, or modi decimandi) since the said valuation, according
as all other things are to 8. or 10. times as much, yet diverse benefices within
the walls of London, are scarce doubled in Tithes since that time: yea some
have stood at a stint ever since, and are hardly so much, as they were then.

That one penny then, was as much as 3. d. is H. 3. where a penny is the 20
part of an ounce, ^ince which time from 20 d. the ounce it was reduced to 26 d.
9. Ed. 3. to 32. d. in 2 Hen. 6. to 40. d. in the 5. Ed. 4. to 45. d. 31. Hen.
8. and to 60. d. 2. Eliz. which continues to this day; and so by that account
2. s. 9. d. in the pound then, was as much as 8 s. 3 d. of the money which is
now paid, though the finenesse of the Coin, did then also exceed ours,
besides the low pri^es of victuals, and all other necessaries, which came so
far short of the enhanced prices in these times, that 1 d. then would go
farther, not only then 3 d. of our money (which it equalled in value) but
farther then 1 s. now, as will appear if we look at the price of Corn and
other victuals in those times, which we find mentioned in credible records.

In the said Act of Parliament in 51. H. 3. which was Anno 1267. somewhat after
Roger Nigers time; made for the assize of bread, and of Beer, and Ale, for
Bakers and Brewers, are mentioned the prices of Wheat, Barley and Oats: and
provision is made that when a quarter of wheat, containing 8 bushels, was at 12
d, what the assize of bread should be, and so from 12 d. to 12 s. which was
then supposed the highest prices that it could at any time amount unto, as that
some times it was but 12 d. a quarter.

It is also there ordered, that Beer and Ale should be sold in Cities and
Towns, according to the prices of Barley and oats two or three Gallons a
penny, and in the Country three or four Gallons for a penny; whereas now, the
ordinary price of wheat is four s. a quarter, and sometimes in dear years 3
l. or 4 l. a quarter, and Beer and Ale sold at far greater prices; according
to the prices of corn, we may conceive were the prices generally of other
things, as Beeves, Muttons, etc.

There is in the Exchequer a Book called the Black Book, See the new book of
Assizes for bread, etc,
composed 23. Hen. 2. Anno 1177. about Rules and Orders in the Exchequer, and
among other things there is mentioned, that for provision of the Kings household
from the time of Hen. 1. the Officers of the Household reducing their victuals
to an estimate of money, did value a measure of wheat to make bread for 100.
men at 12 d. the Carcass of a fat Ox at 12 d. A fat sheep at 4* d. and for
the provander of 20 horses 4 d. during the most part of the Reign of that King
Henry, a quarter of Wheat was sold for 12 d.

After this, in the year 1299. when ^h^re was a great Dearth, by Act of Common
Counsels 27. Ed. 1. these pr^ces were set on victuals, by consent of the King
and Nobility; which were then counted very high prices. A fat Cock 1. d. ob. A
fat Capon 2. d.. two Pullets 1. d. ob. A fat Lamb from Christmas to Shrovetid^
6. d. All the rest of the year 4. d. And in the year 1314. in 8. Ed. 2. to
moderate the extreme Rates of all, these were appointed by Act of Parliament:
A Corne-fed Ox 24. s. A fat stall'd Cow 12. s. another 10. s. A grasse-fed Ox
16. s. A fat Mutton 14. d. A fat Goose 2. d. ob. A fat Capon 2. d. 24. Eggs 1 d.
etc.

After this, Anno 1379. in 3. Rich. 2. a bushel of wheat was at 6. d. a Gallon
of white wine 6. d. of Red 4. d. Anno 10. Rich. 2. which was in the year 1387.
at Leicester, 100. quarters of barley were sold for 100. s.

Anno 1554. And 22. Hen. 6. a quarter of wheat was sold for 12. d. or 14. ^.
One farmer dwelling at Rosey Town, or Cruse Rosey in Hartfordshire, sold 20
quarters of the best wheat for 20 s.

Yea in later times, if we come lower, even in the time of Hen. 8. when prices
were far higher then before, at the Sergeants Feasts at Ely House Anno 23. H.
8. (as Stow relates) great Beeves brought from the Shambles, were at 26 s. 8 d.
a piece, the increase of an Ox 24. s. a fat Mutton 2. s. 10. d. etc. and to
come lower and nearer yet 10 Mariae a barrel of Beer was sold for 6. d. Cask
and all, and 4. great loafes 1. d. and 5^ Mariae Anno 1557, a quarter of Wheat
was sold for 5. s.

According to which cheapenesse of the times, were all fees, wages, and
Salaryes; a Knights fee or sufficient livelihood for a Knight was so much land
as was worth 20. l. per annum, as Cook proves out of the Statute of 1. Edw.
2. de militibus, and of Westminster 2. Cap. 35. and Fitzherbert Not. brev. fol.
82. where he tells us that antiquity thought 400 marks per annum competent
maintenance for a Baron and 400 l, per annum, ad sustinendum nomen and onus of
an Earl, and of late time says he 800 marks per annum was thought sufficient
for a Marquess, and 800 l. per annum for a Duke. See Cook upon Littleton,
lib. 2. cap. 3. Sect. 95. and in later times 40. l. per annum, See Cook upon
Littleton, ^^ 2 cap, 3. Sect. 95.
was thought fufficient for a Knight, as appears by the Statute still in
force, whereby the King may compel any one of such estate to be Knighted, or
else to fine, as Sir Thomas Smith relates de Repub. Angl. Lib. 1. Cap. 18.

I have read in a book of church accounts belonging to St. Gabriel Fenchurch
of Counselors fees about some land; amongst other things. Item, paid to Mr.
Recorder of London for his fee 12. d. In a Leidger book of S^t Magn^s London
for a Lawyers fee, and spent in wine at a meeting of the best of the Parish 8*
d*
All which fees we know are now much increased, and some 100 times doubled,
yea the wages of the Scavenger or Kennell-^aker within our memory have been
doubled or trebled, to what they were before.

According to these prices the livings in London were very great and the
clergy of that city answerable to their Parishioners in ability, and as the
Citizens were and are the wealthiest in the Kingdom, so the clergy had their
estates answerable. The Benefice of St. Magnus in London none of the greatest
Parishes, yet as appears by the printed book of the Common Customs of
London, in this year 1494 which was in the 9. of Hen. 7. as it appears by the
particulars, was in all 105 l. 1. s. 11. d. of which is as much or more then it
is now in Tithe, which sum in those times I dare affirm all things
considered, would have gone as far to maintain one as 500 or 600 l. per annum,
now and that a man might have lived as plentifully then with 100. as now with
5. or 600 l. which if it should be demanded or expected would be thought
vn^e^sonable.

So then by this Tithe out of Houses, the maintenance of the clergy of London
was great in comparison of those times, when the labor is many times doubled;
what was then required, but to say Mass, which was an easy work, p^eaching
was little used unless i^ Lent or towar^s Easter, whereas now by Law or
custom, besides all other Priestly duties, they must preach not quarterly or
monthly, but weekly or oftener, or else be accounted dumb dogs, one Sermon
requiring more pains and labor then the reading of 40. Masses, which required
some pains of the tongue but little or no study of the brain at all.

3. That besides the former Tithe which was in some sort prediall, they paid
also personal Tithes of their clear gains as appears by the award Bill above
mentioned, 31. H. 6. and by the Decimary of St. Magnus, and by Lindwood in the
place alleged, who disputes the case whether the Citizens were free from
personal Tithes, by paying these Tithes of houses, and concludes negatively,
all which personal Tithes are now quite disused, and if they should be
demanded they would cry out as they did of Christ, that we come to torment them
before their time, and would rather with the Gad^rens beseech us all to depart
their Coasts then put them to such charges, and considering the consciousnesse
of those times, this revenue must needs be great, and would have amounted to
more I dare say, then most of the Livings are at this day.

That the people made great conscience

That besides Tithes personal and Chantryes, Obits, Mortuaries, offerings to
Shrines, voluntary oblations, etc. which Chantries were sometimes founded in
perpetuity, endowed with lands for ever, some others for certain time as
appears by the Donnors Wills yet extant, and always beneficial to the Parson
of the Church, who was sometimes solely endowed, and sometimes with the
Wardens, more of which Chantries there were in London, then any where else,
where scarce any Church but had one, and some three or four.

I could instance in some small Parish Churches in London, where the Tithe is
not above 80. l. when as the Chantry lands belonging anciently thereto, taken
away by the Statute of 1. Edward 6. are at this day worth 500 l. or 600 l. per
annum. The offering to the Jmage of the Virgin Mary at St. Magnus by London
Bridge was worth 4. marks per annum 9. Hen. 7. as appears by the Decimary
aforesaid; How commonly were Masses then sold to deliver souls out of
Purgatory, besides the four offering days, used all over the Kingdom, which
are now come to 2. d. at Easter.

How many voluntary oblations did people then give, few of any ability
appearing at any time empty handed; but now men will come with the wise men to
worship Christ, yet they are grown too wise to open their Treasures, and offer
to him: what the duties or payments were anciently for burials, weddings, and
Churchings, we may conjecture by that Schedule annexed to the Bills which was
put up in Star Chamber by some Citizens, 25. Hen. 8. wherein though many
impertinencies and untruths be alleged, yet we may out of their mouths
convince those, who use to object the Casual duti^s now taken, as great
exactions, lately brought up, and not anciently practiced.

Lease of a house belonging to the church 20 s. 40 s. 3 l. 4 l. or more. Leases.

These duties although the Citizens complained off in Starchamber, togetherwith
the tithes, yet the Lords Referrees as it seems, saw so little reason to alter
any one of them, that although they abated the Tithe to 2 s. 9 d. in the pound,
yet they let those duties remain as they did.

That the recovery of Tithes was easy in Nicholas his Bull, and if any did
sue, the cause was heard summarily, sine judicii strepitu, no such delays and
chargeable suites as now, were then known, unless in some special case that
concerned the whole City.

All these things considered, show how liberally the Clergy were then provided
for; although they had not, nor could have the charge which many now have,
being then by Law prohibited to marry, nor was their pains comparable to that
which is now expected and required.

But no^ all is clean inverted, in stead of 3s. 6d. according to the true
value of houses, there is not paid 2. s. 9. d. no not 9 pence in the pound
throughout the City, take one house with another; as for personal tithes,
they are things unknown, not only obits and Chantries abolished as
superstitions, but also Mortuaries and voluntary oblations quite gone, and the
recovery of that little Tithe which is left (if any deny to pay it) so beset
with difficulties, that the most are glad to take any thing they can get, nor
does any one Parish, one of twenty pay him tithes according to any rent,
either old or new, but some small sum such as the Parson and he can agree
upon.

CHAP. III. The decimarie of St. Magnus London, with the Rents and Tithes of
every house, according to the rate of 3 s. 6 d. in the pound, with the other
duties for Burials, and Christnings, Weddings, etc. taken Anno 9. Hen. 7. and
about that time printed.
NOw that it may the better appear both what rents were paid about those
Tithes, and also how the Tithe and offering was paid accordingly; We have
thought good to set down the Decimarie of St. Magnus, London, as is extant in
the said book of Common Customs; wherein every man's Rent then paid is set
down, and withal the Tithe or offering which was paid exactly according to

clear value of the Benefice was this year. 91 16 1.

In this Rentall of St. Magnus we may observe.
1. That the Rents were not then kept secret or unknown, but notorious, and
that the Rent and Tithe still agreed together; whereas now scarce any one house
in a Parish, pays tithes according to any Rent new or old, because the Rents
are kept secret.

2. That tithe was paid according to the full and extended Rents of those
times* which were the true value of the houses, for we find rents of 8 l. x l.
11 l. 12 l. 16 l. per annum, which were as high rents as 80 l. 90. l. 100 l.
are now, and diverse shops let at 5 l. 6 l. 20 nobles, x l. which was without
doubt, the utmost value in those times.

That where the old sums were less then a Noble, they paid according to the
proportion of 14 d. in the Noble; custom it seems prevailing therein, as
Peter Scots, house, whose rent is 4. l. 3. s. 4. d the offering was 14. ^. 7.
d. where 7. d. is for the odd ten groates, and John Palme^s whose rent is 35.
shillings, the offering 6 s. 1. d. ob. where for the (...) pound is 3. s. 6. d.
for the two Nobles 2 s. 4 d. and for the odd 20 d. 3 d. ob. which is all 6 s.
1. d. ob.

4. That they paid tithe then for shops and al, as well as dwelling houses,
though divided from dwelling houses, which many Citizens afterward would have
had exempted, as appears by a suit in the arches 32. Hen. 8. and many now
exempt them under other names, calling their shops sheds, stalls, or standings.

5. That privy Tithes, and Duties for burials, Weddings, and Churchings were
then paid, besides this 3 s. 6. d. in the pound, and therefore are no new
devices of the present Rectors, as some have said, for there we see, they come
to a good sum, per annum, viz. 12. l. 13. s. 4. d. which alone would have
maintained a Parson, as well then as 100 l. now, which few of the London livings
are now worth.

CHAP. IV. The award and Proclamation for the 2 s, 9. d. in the pound, 25.
Henry 8. confirmed by Act of Parliament, 27. Hen. 8.
HOw the tithe came from 3. s. 6. d. to 2. s. 9. d. in the pound, we showed in
the first Chapter; now because the award and Proclamation there mentioned, are
not extant in print, and yet are in force by Act of Parliament, 27. Hen. 8. I
have thought fit to add them here.

The Coppie of the Kings Letters Pattents, wherein the award is recited and
confirmed.

CAILLOR.

Ex tract. per Robert. Michel. deput. Com. Cleric. Civitat. London.

A Proclamation concerning payment of Tithes and oblations, as well within the
City of LONDON, or elsewhere within the Realm.
THE Kings most excellent Majesty, having perfect knowledge, and understanding,
that as well his loving Subjects, Citizens of the city of London of the one
party, as the Parsons and curats of the churches of the said city of the other
party, by their mutual assents, compromitted themselves to stand to, abide and
perform, the Order, Decree, and arbitrament of his right trusty, and right
entirely beloved Counselors: The most reverend Father in God, Thomas
Archbishop of Canterbury, Metropolitan and Primate of England, Thomas Awdeley
Lord Chancellor of England. The Reverend Father in God, Steven Bishop of
Winchester, Thomas Cromwell Esquire chief Secretary to the Kings Highness,
and Mr. of the Rolls. John Fitz-Iames Knight, chief Justice of Pleas, to be
holden before the Kings Highness, and Robert Norwich Knight, chief Justice of
the Common ^ench, in and upon the debate, and variance that was moved between
the said parties upon the Rule, and certainty of Tithe offerings* and other
duties claimed by the said Par^^n and Curats to be paid by the Kings said
subjects, the Citizens of his said City. Whereupon the said Counselors of our
said Sover^ine Lord by great advice, and delib^ration, by one accord, and
assent among other t^^n^s have ordained and decreed, That every the Kings said
Subjects, Citizens and I^h^bit^n^s of his said City, should from the time of
their award and Decree, pay for their Tithes 16 d. ob. for every 10 s. of the
House ^ent, and for every 20 s. 2 s. 9 d. and so accounting and ascending
always by ten shillings, should pay for every ten shillings, after the rate of
16 d. ob. and not above: And yet nevertheless, the Kings Highness is
informed, that diverse, and sundry persons which inhabit within his said City,
not only refuse to pay the said Tithes according as is limited by the said
Counselors; but also that many of the said Citizens, and of other the Kings
Subjects, inhabiting in sundry parts of this Realm, grudged, and murmured, to
pay their Tithe Offerings, and other lawful duties to the Parsons, Vicars, and
others having cure of their souls, like as heretofore by the lawdable Customs
of this Realm they have done and been, accustomed to do and obs^inately, and
wilfully withdraw and detain their said Duties against Justice, Equity,
Reason, and good Conscience, to the great peril of their souls.

For Reformation whereof the Kings said Royal Majesty being the supreme Head
on Earth, under God of the Church of England minding and intending to maintain
and sustain the Honor of GOD, and the Godly observances, and ^ightfull
duties, customable, and by lawdab^^ custom due to the Ecclesiastical
Ministers of the Church of ENGLAND, in as large and ample manner, as heretofore
has been lawdable and honorably used within this Realm.

Does therefore by his present Proclamation straightly charge and command, all
and every his said Subjects of his said City, to satisfy, pay and content,
their Parsons, Vicars, and others having cure of their souls, in the name and
liew of their Tithes, after the rate above expressed, and limited by the Kings
said Counselors. And tha^ all such of his said City as pay less of ye^^^ly
Farm then ten s^illings, and all and every other person, and persons, men,
women, or Children, which do inhabit the said City (being of age to receive
the blessed Sacrament of the Altar, the erroneous doctrine of
Transubstantiation was not then abolished; the very body of our Lord Jesus
Christ) shall pay yearly for the four offering d^yes 2 d. (the Householders
inhabiting within the said city, paying above the yearly Rent of x s. only for
their own persons excepted, and to be discharged of the 2. d. for the s^id
four Offerings.) And over this, his Highness straightly charge and
comm^nds, That all and every other his subjects, in all other parts of this his
Realm, shall pay and content to the Parsons, Vicars, and other the Ministers
of the Church, and having cure, such Tithes, as well praediall; as personal
offerings, and other duties, which by the lawdab^e customs of the Realm, they
heretofore have been obliged, accustomed, and bound to pay, without detaining
any p^rt thereof, and without further denial, contradiction, molestation, or
trouble in that behalf; upon pain that every person offending this his
gracious Proclamation, is to have imprisonment, and to m^ke Fine at his
gracious pleasure, and over, that the off^^dors shall run into his Highness
disp^ea^u^e, and indignation: And his Majesty also ch^rges and commands,
as well all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, and all others having
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction; as all and singular Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes,
Aldermen, and all other his Ministers true Leigemen and Subjects, as well of
this city of London, as elsewhere within this Realm, that they and every of
them, put their effectual endeavors for the due execution of this his
Proclamation from time to time, as to them shall appertain, upon the pains
above rehearsed.

God save the King.
Thomas Berthelet Regius Impressor Excudebat. Cum Privilegio.
The date of this Proclamation is not expressed, but it appears to have bin
presently upon the award in the same year of his Reign: for it must needs be
after the award which it r^cites, and confirms by the Act of Parliament in the
21 year, wherein it stands confirmed, it appears to have bin before Easter,
1535. which was toward the la^ter end of the 25 year of his Reign.

In this award and Proclamation, only the qu^ntity of the tithe is altered
from 3s. 6 d. to 2 s. 9 d. in all other things, the former customs and
constitutions are left in force, so that if formerly the rates were paid
according to the true value of houses, and recovered before the Ecclesiastical
Judge, as certainly they were, the same course was to be observed still, as
appears by the suites and sentences in the arches, here mentioned before.

CHAP. V. Concerning the meaning of the Decree of 37. Hen. 8. that Tithe is due
according to improved Rent, if reserved by that name of Rent, granted by the
City Counsel. The case of double Leases, annual Fynes, Arguments on both
sides. Answers to the Legality, and convenience of paying according to improved
rent: A brief survay of the Livings, as they now are, and they could arise
unto according to the value of houses, with the moderate desires and demands of
the present Clergy, in the late suite before his Majesty.
FOR the conclusion of this tre^tise I have ^hought fit to set do^ne some of
t^^se Arguments o^ both sides, in the points ^hi^^^y contro^ert^d about the
sense of the last Decree of 37 Hen. 8. wherein we must know first that there
are some things clear* and without controversy.

1. It is granted by Counsel learned of all sides, that whatsoever some bold
Ignaroes talk of old Rents: that if a greater rent be reserved at any time by
the name of Rent upon any house, then the old Rent, that then Tithe ought to be
paid according to two shillings 9 pence in the Pound, according to the
improved rent, though the rent be the full value of the House. This appears
by diverse Orders, made by the Lords Majors themselves; wherein Tithe has be^n
decreed, according to the full improved rent, reserved by name of rent.

2. It is granted likewise by Counsel, That if an improved Rent be reserved
by the Owner or Inheritor of the House, that his Act shall charge the House
with Tithe accordingly for ever, though less Rent be reserved afterward by
fines or frauds, or any other devices, unless the house come to be lesser
worth in true yearlie value.

3. They grant likewise, That if a Lessee shall let out his house in part or in
whole at a full Rent by the name of Rent, though afterward he let the same out
for less rent by reason of Fines, or double Leases, yet the Tithe shall be
paid according to the highest rent, during the time or term of years which
the said chief Lessee has in his house.

1. Cases controverted, are chiefly these; where the old Rent is still
continued without increase, by reason of Fynes really paid before hand; whither
the Tithe shall be paid according to the true value of the house or of the old
Rent.

2. When the old rent is only reserved by the name of Rent, and the
improvement is and has always been reserved by other names, as Fynes,
Annuities, New-yeares gifts, etc. to be yearly and quarterly paid, as the Rent
is, and to begin and end with the Lease, done purposely to prevent their
Parsons Tithes, whither those payments be Rents as to the payment of Tithes,
and according to the true intent of the Decree.

Whither the jurisdiction Ecclesiastical be quite taken away by the Decree,
and the Major be made sole Judge, or whither it remain in the same state it
was before the said De^ree.

The first of these I will not insist upon, because there are few such
instances to be found without a^y augmentations of Rents, by fines really
paid; The most of the frauds, and practices having been invented since the
increase of rents, and therefore I (...) that over and shall only propound
(...) A^guments about the two latter (...) I shall not take upon me to (...)
thing, but submit all to the (...) of the learned professors of the (...).

That (...) annual payments, are rents, The Case.
and l^^bl^ to Tithes, as when one lets a House for 1^. ^. supp^sed to be the
accustomed re^t, and reserves 50. l. more by Covenant as ^ year^ly fine, to
begin and end with the le^^^, and to be paid at the same days of p^yment with
the r^nt, that this is a rent and ly^ble to the payment of Tithes may be proved.

1 From the usu^ll acception of the word in co^^on speac^, which agrees with
the Etymology (redditus a reddendo or reditus a redeund^) If a man do but let
out his money he calls (...) interest rent. If one ask one that holds such a
lease i^ question what rent he paies, h^ s^it^ he sits at a dear rent
reckoning all the ye^rely payments; and therefore when the L^nd lord and
Tennant agree, they agree for so mu^^ rent, till the lease come to be m^de by
the S^rive^er: who tells them they mu^t take some course, to prevent the Parson,
who will else claim his Tithes after the full rent, and yet some, even after
such leases made give acquittances for all in the name of Rent; Now here the
Civil Law says, Communis usus loquendi praevalet rigori and significationi
Verborum, and the Common Law attributes much to Common speech 39. Edw. 3.11.
Sir Moyle Finches Case, Col. 6.63, etc.

2. Legally, properly, and even in the construction of the Common Law it is a
Rent; It is none indeed of Littletons Rents, nor rent change, nor rent seck,
nor rent service, it issues not out of the soil, no distress c^n be taken,
descends not to the heir, nor is incident to the reversion, entry of the
lessor does not suspend it, etc.

All this is granted, but yet many things go under the name of Rent, ^ven
legally, and properly which are none of Littletons rents.

J grant you 20. l. during your life to be taken of my person, without
charging of my land: This is a rent as appears by the Registers, the most
fundamental book of Common Law, and by the original writs, which being the
ground of suites are most accurate and curious in names Register, fol. 159. The
writ of annuity. Rex vic. sal. precipe A quod just reddat. B. 20. libraes quae
ei aretro sunt de annuo reditu 20. solidorum here an annuity is called rent.

Fitzherbert not Br. 152. speaks of a rent Issant horse de Cofers 29. Hen.
6.12. Margery Parke^s case, Royne grant a lui un annuell rent de 20. l. pour
term de vie a recever, de quadam pecuniae summa assignata, in partem dotis
ipsius Reginae de magna Custuma London. 1. Henry 6. we read of a rent reserved
upon a Chattell personal, a flock of sheep and such like, and yet in all these
cases, you may say, No distress, no assize, no action of debt till the Term
be ended and all nothing to the purpose, See 30. ass. plo. 5. Shard 14. Edw. 3.
scire facias 122. Co. 5. seignior Mount joys Case.

But must every Statute that speaks of rent extend to those rents; Object.
Answer.
No Statutes must be taken Secundum subjectam materiam, for such a rent as
this is, Sr R. Ct.
not within 32. Hen. 8. of leases by Tennant in tail, nor of 1. Eliz. leases
by Bishops, nor of 13. Eliz. leases by Deanes and Chapters, for as it is said,
Coo. 8.60. Bishop Farnius case, those Statutes look to the benefit of the
heir or their successor, and therefore must be intended of a rent incident
to the Reversion, and issuing out of a thing Maynorable; but in our case the
Statute looks to the benefit of a stranger; the Parson to whom it is not
material what rent it is, so it be a yearly p^yment.

3. Though it were no rent in the Common law, yet without all doubt it is in
the Ecclesiastical Law, according to which it must be here expounded.

4. That it is a Rent in that Law is manifest Pensio quae provenit domo vel
habitatione, and redditus praedialis. Lindwood, fol. 109, and in the enlishing
of the Constitutions above mentioned, Annua Pensio domus, is rendered Rent,
payment, price, pension, farm in the old book of Customs. Now that in
matters Ecclesiastical, the Common Law judges according to the
Ecclesiastical law is certain, for even in special Courts of Common Law it
judges as those Courts would. In matters customary it alters the Common Law
to fit them to the Custom, quia dominus remisit Curiam.

The Statute 31. Hen. 3. Cap. 3. when a man dies intestate, the Ordinary shall
depute the next and most lawful friends of the person dying, intestate to
administer his goods. Now by goods at the Common Law are not meant leases for
years, Wardship, Prochyn, avoidance 4. Edw. 6. Br* grants. 51. If J make you a
deed of gift of all my goods Omnia bona mea, you shall have none of these, yet
it was always taken Sans Contradiction; That the Ordinary may by these words
grant administration of leases. And if an administration of goods be granted
without more words, Wray said 22. Eliz. such an administration has power to
deal with leases for years, because the Spiritual Law so takes the word Bona
by which we are to judge. But this is our case, for now in like manner the
Spiritual Law under Rent includes this annual payment, and Ergo the Judges
are to take it so.

5. That it must needs be a Rent within the intent, and true meaning of this
decree appears.

1. It was made for the maintenance of the Clergy, and so pro bono Ecclesiae,
and consequently ^or the maintenance of Religion and Service of God: How Summa
est ratio quae pro Religione facit.

2. It was made to suppress fraud and covyn, it is spoken of thorough all the
branches of the decree.

Now the Civil law says, Dolis and fraudibus omnibus modis occurrendum, then
specially such frauds as this, for Statutes of such a nature, ^re extended by
equity beyond the word, and therefore well may the word here be taken so far
as Common speech d^^h extend them: for this favor the Judges have ever
extended even to Statutes most penal, for words must stoop to meaning, not
meaning to words, and yet this decree must be extended in equity even beyond
what the words will bear in Common sense in some Cases.

The Register and Fitz-herbert Not. Br. fol. 152. tells us of Redditus Robae,
and like. Now suppose a man make a lease of a House in London, reserving so
many furrs so many Robes shall not the Parson have his Tithes of every 10 s.
valewe, a man makes a lease, and the Lessee covenants in the same Indenture to
pay for it 10 s. yearly and this without intent to defraud the Parson. Beestons
Case Plowden 131.2. doubts whither this be rent, and the Pryor of Binghams
Case is vouched that it is no rent fol. 136.2. But is there any doubt, but this
is a rent within the Decree.

Or if one make a lease of a house and the Lessee grants him a yearly fine
during the term, and if it be behind he shall distrayne for it.

This is no rent but an annuity and the clause of distress only a penalty.
Butts Case Coo. 7.23.2. yet no doubt the Tithe is due to the Parson.

This Decree comes instead of that provision formerly made for Tithes in
London, and not by enlarging, but by way of diminution, taking from the Clergy
9. d. in the pound which they had before, and therefore ought to be taken
strictly against them, and larg^ly for them.

4. Without all question the meaning of the Decree was that the rates therein
expressed should be paid as the rates formerly in use were paid before the
decree; for though there was made an alteration of the rates, 3. s. 6. d. made
2. s. 9. d. yet it was never intended, but that the manner of payment should
continue, and therefore rent in the decree must be taken as it was formerly
taken by constitution or custom, before the Decree which was for any kind of
payment, as is manifest for the practice of former times, appears by the names
then used, viz. rent, pensions, payment, price: in the Book of Customs, it is
called rent or Farm in the Proclamation confirmed by Act of Parliament, 27.
Hen. 8. The Citizens never paid according to any fixed rents, but as the Rent
improved, so did the Tithe: as appears by Arundels constitution, declaring that
if the rent were above 4. d. the old Rent of some house in those times, then
they should pay to whatsoever sum it arose, by the Bull ordaining to pay
Secundum verum valorem pro quo domus Secundum veram existimationem locari
poterit, by the award 31. Hen. 6. wherein Houses let out or kept by the owners
were to pay after a common value, by the Decimary of St. Magnus in the Book of
Customs, 7. Henry 7. wherein they pay after the full Rents, some 10. pounds,
some 16. l. which was as high a rent then as one hundred pounds now; By the
Bill in Star Chamber, 25. Henry 8. wherein the city sets out that the rents
of houses were enhansed and doubled, and that they paid Tithe after the
enhansed Rents, and that diverse new houses were built in void grounds, and some
newly repaired, and that they paid Tithe for them as for other houses, which
they would not have done, had they been as wise as men are now. And in all
former controversies about Tithes, even in those which occasioned the decrees
of 25. and 37. Henry 8. there was no question made at all about the Rent, for
which the Tithe was to be paid but about the quantity, how much in the pound,
and therefore the occasion of the decree being only to settle that, it could
never intend to alter other things which were not at all in question, for such
leases and Fines were never paid before the Decree, nor many years after.

Decree in the Exchequer, for the true value in Ivats case. 16 Iac.
4. By a Decree in the Exchequer Pasch. 16. Iac. the Barons declare that they
conceived the meaning to be that Tithes should be paid according to the true
value, as the houses are worth to be let per annum.

5. The practice of the Ecclesiastical Courts, is such, that diverse sentences
have bin given for payment, according to the true value, whether the annual
payment were called Fine or Rent.

6. The Decree provides, that where more rent is reserved, for implements of
brewing, dying, etc. a third penny shall be abated, and where less rent is
reserved, by ruin, fire, or any other casualties, there shall be abatement of
tithe accordingly, and therefore it must needs be meant; that in other Cases
the house should p^y according to the value.

Those annual payments are not Fines in common sp^ech, nor according to
a^cie^t use, and therefor could never be intended to be exempted from tithes,
for as there were few Fines anciently, so usually they were, some small sum
which the Less^r had been at, for reparation, which the Tenant was to pay at
his coming in, but now by Fine they reserve the whole value of the house,
besides in common speech, a Fine is a sum paid before hand and therefore
called an Incombe, and so in this Decree, is called a Fine paid before hand,
and in some places a gross sum, the rent being paid in many sums
afterward; whereas in these practices, the Fine and rent differ not but in
name, and by as good reason, the Country-m^n that called his pigs puppies,
might refuse to pay his tithe pig, because puppies are not Titheable, besides
the reason why Fines are p^id, is either to furnish the Landlord with ready
money, or to ease the Tennant by bringing down the Rent, or to secure the Rent
to the Landlord, by a Fine paid before hand: None of which reasons are of any
use here, so that the only cause is the Parsons tithe, and therefore no such
Leases are known in any partof the Kingdom besides.

The increase of Rent is either because the house is greater, or fitter for a
greater family, or because Trading increases, and Rent rises, in both which
cases, all reason requires that the Tithe should increase. For by the first,
the Parson has a greater charge of souls. By the second, the Parishioner is
better able to give, his gains being greater.

9. Otherwise, diverse absurdities will follow hereupon, for by this device in a
new house, a new Parishiner, shall come and partake sacr^ and sacramenta, and
yet be bound to pay nothing to the Parson, reserving all by Fine.

Heer^ is Officium sine beneficio. Besides hereby the Ministers means, shall
stand at a stay for ever, though all means of livelihood grow ten times
dearer, hereby the 9. parts shall increase to the owner, and not the tenth part
to the Parson, etc.

10. These practices were resolved by all the Reverend Bishops under their
hands, and by both the Universities, Anno 1620. to be utterly unlawful in
point of conscience.

There can be no fraud here by the common law, Object against the legality.
because the Parson has no present right, or interest in being, nor by the
Decree.

First, because this is a rate Tithe.

Secondly, because the second clause requires only, that where no rent, or
less then was wont is reserved, the Tithe shall be paid according to the rent,
for which it was last letten.

The ground of this is false, Answ,
that there can be no fraud, but where the party has a present right: This is
against as many Acts of Parliament almost as speak of fraud instance M^rlebe
cap. 6. De his q^i primogenitos, etc. of those that enfeose their heirs within
Age to defraud the Lords of their Wardships, the statute says not, that shall
hereafter enfeoffe, but Qui feof^re solent, so here was a fraud by common law
before the statute though not made void, and so penal till the statute, and
yet the Lords which were defrauded had no present right for their interest
grows long after, by the death of the tennant that made the Feofment. See 13.
Eliz. Die. 294.

Here is quasi a Rent in Esse, and to grow upon an instant; for in the instant,
that the Lease is made, the right of the Parson grows to have the Tithe.

The very Decree m^kes it fraud against the Parson, disertis verbis, as 27.
Eliz. does against a purchaser, that purchases the ^and after.

To the second part I answer first, this rate Tithe must follow the rent, and
if that be uncertain, then is the Tithe also, and so subject to fraud.

Secondly, for the clause of the Decree, I answer there is Fraus in intention,
and fraus in executione; here is an intent of fraud, but in effect there is
none, for he intended to deceive the Decree, and it deceived him, where he
in^ended an annual payment to be no ^en^, which the Decree says is a Rent,
and so Titheable, so fraus in authorem redit, and so fraud is out of doors,
besides the substance or body of the Decree is the first clause, and the
question rests, whither this annual payment be a rent within that clause of
the Decree, which if it be, the branch following nihil operatur fraud, or no
fraud, within that branch is not material.

By the Decrees and Acts of 27. and 37. Hen. 8. a new duty is created, for no
tithes were paid before, but oblations only, for the Churches of London had
nothing but oblations and obventions, and therefore the tithes being only by
sorce of those statutes the words must be expounded not according to former
practices, but according to the common Law.

This is clearly otherwise, for these payments are not tithes more now then
heretofore, nor less heretofore then now. For though two ^hillings nine pence
be more then a tenth part, yet it is called a tithe, and so was the three
shillings six pence long before either of the decrees of 25. or 37. Hen 8. in
Arundels constitution, 21. Richard 2. Anno 2397. they are called Oblationes seu
decimae, Lindwood who lived in Anno 1422. says in the place alleged cap. 1.
they are paid in liew of prediall Tithes of houses, and recompense of want of
glebes, referring himself to the constitution of Roger Niger, then extant: in
diverse suites and sentences in the Courts Ecclesiastical, they are called
Decimae, in a Libell in the Arches. 10. Hen. 8. they be thrice called Decimae.
In a sentence there 18. H. 8. it is said to be secundum consuetudinem solvendum
Decimas in Civitate London. In ye Acts of common Counsel, 19 H 8. It is said
the Bull confirmed by that Court, 14. Ed. 4. was concerning Tithes and
Oblations, so in the suit in Starchamber, 25. Hen. 8. they are called Tithes,
and the witnesses depose for 40 50.60. years, these payments were paid
sometimes quarterly, sometimes at Easter, by the name of oblations, or tithes,
so that the custom of offering upon each several day was left off, and the
payments made yearly or quarterly long before, 25. Hen. 8. so that it is
certain, neither the name, nor the nature of those pay ments, or duties, are
altered by any Act of Parliament as is commonly (but ignorantly by many
affirmed) but only the quantity made less, Object. 3. vide p. vlt.
as appears by what is formerly said.

But there is a clause in the decree, that where less then 2. s. 9. d. for
every 20 s. rent has bin accustomed to be paid for tithes, Objections
there such tithe shall be paid only, as has been accustomed.

This clause is by some expounded of St. Martin le grand which is in the city,
Answ.
but not of the city, and the out Parishes which pay 2 s. in the pound by
custom, but this cannot be, for those places are not within the decree (which
extends only to the liberties of the city) and therefore they cannot be
excepted out of a rule wherein they were never included. It must be therefore
meant of such parishes or places within the city, which by special custom
pretended to pay only after the rate of 2. s. in the pound, as appears by thee
citizens bill in Starchamber. 25. H. 8. wherein they name some such places
within the city, and by the Majors precept upon the order then made, directed
to every Ward, wherein it is expressed, that such as paid only 2. s. in the
pound, should pay no more. Now though this were pretended by the city in that
Bill, yet it appears by the depositions their proof came short herein, and
therefore the makers of the Decree, do not specify this rate of two shillings
in the pound, but do only in the general say, that where less then 2. s. 9.
d. was accustomed to be paid, less should be paid, leaving them which alleged
the said custom or any other to prove the same.

Now seeing no parish or place in London does at this day pay according to that
rate of 2. s. in the pound, or of any lesser sum, nor was any such custom
ever yet proved (though often alleged) and whosoever will prove any, must
prove a custom of paying after such a rate, before the 37. of Hen. 8 which at
this day is impossible for any to do, it follows there, that this proviso is
of no use now in the Decre^, nor can it any way bene^it any of thecity in this
case, nor indeed could any man in any suite yet make use thereof.

The livings in London would be too great, Parsons would be all Bishops, some
worth 2000. l. per annum, if tithes were paid according to improved Rents.

It is unjust to detain any man's right, though it would make him never so
rich: Would any rich man think it fit that others should defraud them of
their right, because if it were paid they would be too rich, and because the
Parsons would be little Bishops if they had all, must they therefore live like
Beggars.

If any Living should swell to so great a proportion, the remedy should be to
divide the Parish into more Parishes, and not to deprive the Church of its due.

But to answer this more particularly.

1. These Objections concern not the 97. Parishes within the Walls where few
new buildings can be raised, and if the Tithes were paid according to the
vtmo^t value there would be within the Walls.

1. Eight Benefices not worth above 100 marks or 100 l. per annum.

2. Not above 3. within the Walls worth 500 l. per annum.

3 Not above 6. more worth 400 l. per annum.

The rest would be between 100 and 300 pounds per annum, and the most of them
not above 150 or 200 l. per annum.

2. If Tithes were thus paid it would be.

1. No more then Livings of the like value in the Kings Books in the Country,
for some are at 60. l. some at 70. diverse at 40. l. and 30. l. and few less
then 20. l.

2. Nor so great as where there is like number of Inhabitants of far less
ability in the Country, where some Farmer not worth 500 l. p^yes more Tithe
then 20. of the best houses in London.

3. Nor near so great as before the Decree when yet they could not have such
charges being to live single, and their pains not comparable to preaching now
used, the bare Tithe of St. Magnus Anno 1474. besides Oblations, mortuaries,
obits, trentals, Chantries, etc. which were very many and great was 87. l. 11.
s. 11. d. ob. which was as sufficient maintenance then as 500 l. now, and yet
the Tithe is not above 84. l. and stands in the Kings books taxed at above 69.
l. besides 40. s. in Pensions.

4. Nor should the Clergy have more free maintenance then is suitable to their
education and charge, nor above ordinary Citizens among whom they live who are
many of them worth 5. or 6. Bishops, or half the Parsons in London.

2. For the Parishes without the Walls by reason of new building they are swollen
very big, yet the biggest would not be worth above 1500 l. per annum or
thereabouts, as has appeared by a valuation made of every house, but here
consider;

1. These stand a great part without the liberties, and so are not within the
Decree.

2. They be all appropriate, save St. Andrews in Holberne, and St. Buttolph
Bishopsgate.

3. They are so great that they are fit to be divided, and so the maintenance
would be but reasonable.

4. The particular Parishioners there shall pay no more then those in the least
Parishes in London, so that there would be no greater burden to any particular
man by the Parsons benefit.

5. The Parsons in those Parishes are at more charge and pains, and must keep
two. or 3. assistants.

3. Thirdly, the desires of the present Clergy for increase of their
maintenance were conceived, to be so moderate by all indifferent men, that one
may justly wonder how they could be rejected; for in their demands lately
tendered and sen^ to the several Parishes, we may observe these particulars.

1. There are 30. Parishes within the Walls wherein they desired not that the
whole Tithe should exceed 100 l. per annum, and in most of those Parishes less
was desired, in some 80. l. in some 70. l. in some not above 50. l. per annum.

2. There was but one Parish within the Walls, wherein was desired 300. l. per
annum, nor above 3. more where in was desired 200 l. per annum or upwards in
Tithe.

3. The whole Tithe demanded in all the rest of the Parishes within the Walls
was between 100 l. and 200 pounds per annum.

4. Even in the greatest Parishes without the Walls there was not above 100 l.
per annum desired in any, above that which is now paid, which yet is no more
then some small Parishes within the Walls have allowed for a yearly Lecture.

These demands were all they desired the Tithe should be raised unto, and that
no greater sum should be paid* provided that their successors might not
hereby be concluded or shut up, but that upon the variation of times some way
might be open upon just cause for such alteration of the rates, as the King and
State should think fit.

Object.
The Livings are competent already and some of late improved.

Answer.
The Competency will appear by a general survey of their present estate, viz.

1. There be 20. Livings within the Walls under 40. l. per annum, and some of
them 20. l. some 30 l. in Tithes.

2. There is but one within the Walls worth 100 l. or upward in Tithes.

3. There are not above 20. that exceed 70. l. per annum, whereof few arise to
100 l. all the rest within the Walls are within 40* l. and 70 l. per annum.

All without the Walls and within the Liberties are apppropriate but two.

The Casual profits are not equal to the yearly charge issuing out by
tenths, Pensions, procurations, etc. and wherein some few Livings there is a
little gleabe which was in the most part of the Parsonage-House divided and let
out, there are about 20. Livings that have not so much as a dwelling House.

CHAP. VI. The second Case concerning Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction for Tithes
in London. That the Lord Majors power is not exclusive to the Ordinaries, but
only accumulative.
THat the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction concerning Tithes in London is not taken
away by any of the Decrees, or Acts of Parliament, but remains in statu quo
prius.

1. It is granted, that before 37. Hen. 8. the Jurisdiction remained, nor was
any new duty of Tithe then created as is before proved: Now supposing the
Decree to be an Act, there are no negative words to take it away, and an Act of
Parliament in the affirmative does not take away the Jurisdiction
Ecclesiastical, unless some negative words be added, as not otherwise, nor
in other manner, etc. as Cook in Cawdries case, who says, It is the general
rule in all their Books, citing diverse authorities to this purpose.

2 The parties compromitting were only the Curates and the Citizens, and not
the Ordinary; and therefore no Act made by virtue of that compromise can bind
the Ordinary or take away his Jurisdiction; for the Act of Parliament says
only, it shall bind the said parties, viz. Curates, and Citizens, and their
Heirs and Successors, but mentions not the Ordinary.

3 The original Decree was delivered by the Lords to the Bishop of London, to
be kept in his Registry, and in the time of King Edward 6. the Lords of the
Counsel whereof some were makers of the Decree, gave order to the Bishop of
London in the Kings name, Acts and Monuments, v^l, 2. fol. 1187. Col. 2. artic^
5.
to cause the Citizens to p^y their Tithes, which he could not do without
Jurisdiction.

4. Pro^ibitions were never granted anciently in the time of Queen Eliz. upon
such suggestions, as they are granted for in the Country, Circa metas and
bound^s, and Circa modum decimandi, etc.

5. Though the jurisdiction were quite taken away, yet it is restord again
1.2, Ph. and Mary Cap. 8. toward the end, which sets the Bishops in the same
State for jurisdiction and cognizance of causes, as they were before 20. Hen.
8. and if any say that Statute is repealed 1. Eliz. cap. 1. I answer not wholly
but in part, ^or this clause stands confirmed by general words, viz. That all
Acts and clauses of any Statute repented by that of 1. and 2. Ph. and Mary. and
not revi^ed by that of 1. Eliz. shall stand still repealed, and therefore if
that part of the Decree which takes from the jurisdiction Ecclesiastical, were
repealed by 1. and 2. Ph. and Mar. then it stands repealed still, and by the
same clause is that of 1. Edw. 6. cap. 2. concerning Bishops sending process
in the Kings name, and under his seal repe^led, or else its not repealed to
this day, for though it were repealed in 1. Mariae, 2. chap. yet that Act 1.
Mariae is repealed again by 1. Ia^o^i 25.

6* Besides Tithes in their o^ne nature are originally of Eccle^iasticall
cognizance, and so whatsoever comes in the name of Tithe, except by special
words it be otherwise determined (which is not here) remains of
Ecclesiastical cognizances. 7. Jn the Exchequer, 16. Jack. Ivalts case, it was
over ruled, against the defendants plea of the Lord Majors being to be Judge.

That notwithstanding that Court had knowledge, the impropriation being held in
Fee-farme of the King, and upon this ground, that the Majors power was not
exclusive to any other Jurisdiction, but only accumulative.

7. Lastly, it appears by what was said before Cap. 1. That before this Decree
the Ordinaries Jurisdiction, was not in question, for that the City put up a
Bill in Parliament, 35, Henry 8. that none might sue for Tithes any where, but
in the Spiritual Courts or by action of debt at the Common law, which shows
it was never intended nor desired that the Ordinary should be divested of his
power.

Objec^.
It is objected that the Major is the only Judge named in the Decree, and the
Tithes herein mentioned are not nor can be claimed by any other Law then by
this Decree, and therefore cannot be sued for before any other Judge, then such
as the Decree directs unto.

Answer.
This Argument takes that for granted, which is utterly denied, viz. That the
Tithes in London are grounded only upon the Decree of 37. Hen. 8. as if there
were no other Law now in force which is apparently an error; for this Decree
does not abrogate nor nullify any other Law formerly enforce, further then
where it was contrary to this.

Now it is certain that 2. s. 9. d. in the pound, was due by laws in force
before this Decree, viz. by the Award and Proclamation in 25. Hen. 8. confirmed
by Act of Parliament, 27. Hen. 8. The force of which Award and Proclamation,
and Act were no ways nullified by this Decree, but were only confirmed and
explained thereby, in some things then doubtful, so that they were then and
are still in force; and therefore seeing that by them the Ordinaries power was
not extinct as is clear and granted by all; it is as clear that there is
nothing in this Act to exstinguish it, for the Major had power by the Statute
of 25. H. 8. as well as by this of 37. Henry 8. and there are no negative words
in this more then in that.

Yea, not only are the Award and Proclamation of 27. Hen. 8. and Act of
Parliament of 27. Hen. 8. still in force, but also the Constitution of Roger
Niger and Archbishop Arundell, with the award made in 32. Hen. 6. and other
laws then in use, are all as may be probably concluded at this day in force,
viz. so far as they are not contrary to the Act and Decree of 37. Hen. 8. for
if they were abrogated, I would gladly know when and by whom. In the 25. H. 8.
they were not nor by the Statute of 27. Henry 8. for then only the quantity
was al^ered from 3. s. 6. d. to 2. s. 9. d. and in all other things the payment
was left to the former Laws and Constitutions and Customs according to which
the controversies were determined arising after that time, as appears by the
sentences still remaining on Record, and in the 37. Hen. 8. there is nothing
abrogates any of them further then when they are contrary to what was then
decreed, and therefore it is probably thought by some that for non payment the
Major Excom. is now incurred ipso facto according to Arundels Constitution, and
that none ought to be absolved without payment Nisi in articulo mortis, as is
there set down, and certain it is, that if this last Decree were quite
abrogate, the Clergy might have as good Law for their Tithes as they have now.

Further I answer, that though the Ordinary had no Jurisdiction formerly, yet
the very nature of Tithes here decreed gives him jurisdiction, unless negative
words had been added.

It is further said, that the nature of these payments is altered by this
Decree, oblations are made Tithes, and though formerly the Ordinary had power,
whilst they had the name of Oblations, yet now another Judge being mentioned,
and the Oblations become Tithes the Case is altered.

This is clearly refuted by the precedent History, Answer.
whereby it is manifest that neither the name, nor the nature was altered by
this Decree. The Proclamation appoints 2. s. 9. d. to be paid for Tithes, and
2. d. at Easter for oblation or offering.

So the Award 25. Hen. 8. and so most of the precedent Acts style them Tithes,
and long before not only this last Decree, but before 25. Hen. 8. yea before
the time of Henry 8. the payment on several offering days was disused, and
the whole paid in one or 4. entire payments by the name of Tithes, and yet it
is most certain that then the Ordinary had this Jurisdiction, and that solely.

But it seems these two Jurisdictions of the Ordinary and Lord Major cannot
both stand by the Letter of the Decree, for by the Decree, Object:
if any difference arise-upon complaint of the party grieved, the Major may
make an end, and force the parties to stand to his Decree: Now suppose the
Ordinary should determine otherwise concerning the same matter and force, by
censures of the Church, the parties to o^ey his sentence, h^re it will be
doubtful to whom obedience must be given, and so the one Jurisdiction must
destroy the other.

Answer.
J answer first, it may well be affirmed, that by the party grieved can be only
meant the Minister; for wherein can the Citizen be grieved, if the Minister
demand more then his due, the Citizen may withold payment, and so long J hope
he is not grieved by the Ministers demand.

If it be said, he is grieved when he is sued in the Spiritual Court, J
answer, that this grievance cannot be here meant, because first, the party
must be grieved with some thing mentioned in the Decree, which this is not;
and secondly, the grievance must be such as the Lord Major can help or
remedy, but this he cannot; for he never did, nor can stay the proceeding in
any Spiritual Court, nor ever used any compulsive power against any Minister,
but against the Attorney only, according to the words of the Statute 27 Hen. 8.

Secondly, J answer by propounding the like question. The Exchequer has power
to determine matters of Tithe in London where the Living is impropriate and
held in Fee-farme of the King, as has been often adjudged, especially in
Ivats Case, 16. Jacob. Now suppose that Court and the Major make contrary
Decrees, which of them must be obeyed, or how can the words of the Statute be
made good for the Lord Majors power. Here I know it will be answered, that
the Exchequer being the higher Court must take place, and the Lord Major may
not meddle with causes there depending, but I say this is not mentioned in the
Decree, but only gathered by consequence; because that Court had jurisdiction
before the Decree, which Jurisdiction is not taken away by the Decree, and if
so, then the very same answer do J give for the Spiritual Court which is
superior to the Majors in matters of Tithes, and had power before him many
hundred years in this Case, so that he ought not to meddle with matters there
depending.

But Statutes and Acts of Parliament must be expounded by Judges at Common
Law? Object. 4^


This makes nothing to the question; Answ. 1.
for first the Lord Major is none of those Judges, and secondly, this proves
only that the Judges may prohibit the Spiritual Court if it proceed contrary
to the true meaning of the Decree; but if it proceed according to the true
sense of it, then it may proceed otherwise.

No Ordinary could hold out plea for Tithes in the Country, because there are
Statutes made for all Tithes in the time of Henry 8. and Edward 6. which yet
we know they did, and may do lawfully, and are never prohibited but upon
suggestion, that they proceed contrary to the meaning of those Statutes and
Customs, which the Judges conceive they only are to interpret.
