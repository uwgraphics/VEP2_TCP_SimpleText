TO THE Worshipful Company OF CLOTH WORKERS.
MVsitians are not so much praised for their long, as their well Playing; I
have endeavored to compose this Piece, a piece of perfect Harmony; and from
several Discords, to raise a Concord: The Subject I have undertook (though a
body in it self) has several dependances like the Tree that gives a being to
her many branches. To express much of them in little, may argue some Judgment:
But to assume that to my self, without your generous Approbation, were to
conclude me to have, either none at all, or very little. I confess had my Fancy
had the Liberty to Feast without confinement, it might have digested it self
into some farther illustrations: Nevertheless, I doubt not but you will meet
with something in your small Survey, that is, as pleasing as fitted for the
purpose you intended it; All I aimed at, is to deserve your good Opinion, in
the content or satisfaction you receive by this; and from thence to derive an
Ambition to subscribe my self,

Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, JOHN TATHAM.

To the Right Honorable Sr. JOHN IRETON, Knight. Lord Mayor of the City of LONDON.
My Lord,
THere are a sort of Persons that make Flattery their Trade, and the Subjects
they work upon, are such as are self-Affected, whose Ears are still open to
hear their own Praise: It is confessed, where Disert Inhabits, Commendation is
requisite; so it put on a modest Attire, and not shape it self with the vanity
of Hyperbolizing: And as your Lordship is a known Enemy to such Aereall
Nothings; So have I strove rather to follow the narrow Tract of Truth, than the
common Road of Adulation. All I have aimed at in this Epitome, is to set forth
the ample Love and Affection your Company bears you; And if in the Progress
thereof, I have hinted any way upon your Honors Goodness, as it has been, and
is a general received Truth; So I shall not blush or be a shamed to own it, and
my self in all humbleness, my Lord,

Your Servant John Tatham.

on the top of the Pageant, is sixth a Ram (the Crest of the Companies Arms) on
which is seated a Figure.

The Second Scaene.
A Chariot drawn by two Griffins, wherein is presented the several
qualifications of a true Honorable Person.

IN the same Equipage, the whole Body march, till the first Scaene comes near
Soaper-lane end; where it makes a stand; and the other Scaene, moves with the
Body, till they come near Paul's Chain, where that makes a stand; the Marshall
moving on till the Lord Mayor is ready to flanck the first Scaene, in which
Industry is seated, clothed in Gray, on her head a Kirchief, in one hand she
bears a Card or Shears, in the other a Scepter; on the top of which Scepter, is
an open hand, and in the midest of it an Eye; and at the end of the Scepter,
two small Wings, like those of the Cadices; and being always busied in the
midst of the Stage, a Bush is represented, under which a Sheapheard sits
playing on Bag-pipes, Sheep feeding by him, and other persons clothed in Gray
or Russet, representing the several Occupations appertaining to the said*
Trade, sometimes leaving work and falling to dancing or singing; ever in one
action or other.

The Song.
Who can boast a happiness more securely safe than we:
Since our harmless thoughts we dress, in a pure simplicity:
And chaste nature does dispense, here her beauties Innocence.
Envy is a stranger here; blessed Content our bowls does crown:
Let such slave themselves to fear, on whose guilt the judge does frown:
We from evil actions are free, as uncorrupted air.
With the Turtles whisper love,
With the Birds do practice mirth:
With our harmless Sheep we move, and receive our food from Earth:
Nor do we disdain to be, Clothed with the Lambs Liverie.
Which being endded, on a sudden the Lord Mayor draws near to the Scaen, to
whom Industry makes her Address:

Industry 's Speech.
MY Lord your Pardon if my People do
Exceed their wonted Bounds to honor you;
And laying work a side, presume to play;
The sight of you gives them a Holli-day.
Such seasoned harmless pastime cannot hurt,
That labor's hard,'s not softened with some sport:
And though I Am called painful Industry,
Figured with weary hand and watchful Eye:
Yet I a moderate labor like the best,
Whose burden makes us not the same detest:
For where the Mean is used, it is such a Treasure,
It makes the Toil become a seeming pleasure:
And as no Art or Science can be found,
Or Manull Trade within the spacious round
Of the vaste Universe without me, so
Experience Fames me, and the Finders too.
The Mathematician that can sound* the Seas;
And find their depth, number the Pleiades; Seven Stars

By whom the Mariner his course does steer,
Bringing the Merchant profit far and near:
Finding out Tract-less places, but for me
Had mist the aim of his discovery.
I have digrest from what I was to say;
A lawful calling is our Theme to day:
The benefit of which the Ancients have
Set forth in several Ideoms, wise and grave:
It is a Cities glory, and in part,
Is to the Governor or Head, a Heart,
To which he is a very welcome guest;
Not to devour, but temperately to Feast:
And this of Cloth-working is known to be,
As numerous as full of Charity.
It clothes the naked, feeds the hungry, and
A general profit brings unto the Land.
The Picker, Carder, and the Spinner too;
The Weaver, Fuller and the Dyer do
Relate to it, though in a different kind,
Like several Nations to one power confined:
Yet from those various vains many do feed,
And are supplied with succor in their need:
I fear I Am tedious (Sir) and may offend:
I Will therefore with the Companies wishes end.
May no intestine broils disturb your rest,
But Peace continue in the City.
Nations breast:
That when your time does terminate; all may
Applaud your Government, and bless this day.
The Speech ended, this Triumph moves up to the Van of the Marshall, and
marches till the Lord Mayor come up to the second Triumph.

have been Lord Mayors.

The body of the Scaen is full of Hills, whereon grows several Teasels (part of
the Companies Badge) and about them several Briars and Thistles, where Lambs
feed.

The Lord Mayor being drawn near to the second Triumph Honor, makes his
address thus,

Honor's Speech.
THough some dark Relating to the death of the Protector.
Clouds do interpose our joy;
And seems her comely Beauty to distroy:
The The Companies Colors to their Arms.
Argent's now by Sables overborn,
And Honor should in the same Livery mourn:
Yet that this day may not obscured be,
We'ave set our Confined heart at Liberty.
I come not (Sir) to tell what Honor is,
Or how attended; farther than what these
Do represent; a Mind Serene should be,
Of Lambe-like Innocence, from Envy free:
And armed with Courage, to pass through the Bryer*
Of sharp Afflictions, till the Soul retires.
These are the virtues that make man complete,
Fitted for Honor, and for Honors Seat;
Faith, Hope, Charity, Prudence, Temperance,
Justice and Fortitude, seem to advance
Your this days Triumph, at whose feet does lie.
Each Rebel-Vice, to show the standers by,
The power of Virtue, and encourage them
To shun the Counterfeit, and take the Iem.
Disert is Honors Parent; I am then
Yours by Descent, receive your own again.
To speak the truth of the Antiquity,
Of the honored Company of which you are free.
It Is twelve times twelve years since that they were made
A Genuine Fraternity in Trade.
You are the twelfth Lord Mayor that sprung from thence:
And equal with the rest in Eminence.
As Rivers pay their Tribute to the Maine,
And yet from thence replenisht are again:
So fares your Company, from whom you do,
Receive their Love, and they your liking too:
Then Sir extend your Talent, and expose
Your large Endowments to their best repose,
And the Honor of your Country; temper so
Mercy with Justice, neither may over flow:
Justice does bear a Sword to terrify,
And likewise Scales to weigh Offenses by.
May Fortitude and Temperance guide you ever:
And the whole stock of Virtues leave you never;
That when you shall surrender up your breath,
Your Memory may Triumph after death.
The Speech ended, this Scaen keeps the place, and his Lordship with the whole
body pass through Ave Mary lane, and down Warwick Lane.

The first Scaen placing it self at the South end of Warwick lane, and that of
Honor marches down Warwick lane; and is placed at the Lord Mayors gate; the
Pentioners fyling on the East side the lane, hanging their Targets on their
Javelins.

The Martial in Paul's Church yard, cause the Drums, Fifes, Trumpets, Ensigns,
Streamers, and Banner-bearers, to open to the right and left, for a lane,
through which the Company is to pass; causing the first right hand man to
stand; the rest advancing each before his Leader, until the Master and Wardens
terminate at the Lord Mayor door; So as the Master, Wardens, Assistants,
Livery, and Batchellors have as a Rearguard; a Pentioner with his Target hung
on the top of his Javelin; and then the Ushers, Colors, Trumpets, Drums and
Silkworks, file up and place themselves in several parts as a Frontguard, as
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen pass into the Lord Mayors house.

The Lord Mayor being entered his house, the Martial, Drums, Trumpets, and
Gentlemen-Ushers, march up to the head of the Master and Wardens, two by two:
The whole Body march away to Cloth workers Hall; the Colors and Silk: works
are furled, and with the Scaenes are conveyed to Cloth workers Hall.

Honor finis Coronat.
