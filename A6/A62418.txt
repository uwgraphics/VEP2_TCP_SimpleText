LONDON, Printed by N. T. at the entrance into the Old Spring Garden near
Charing Cross. 1684.

To the Reader.
AMongst the several means that have been of late years to reduce the deluded
Multitude to their just Allegiance, this of BALLADS and LOYAL SONGS has not
been of the least influence. While the Fergusons, and Heads of the Factions
were blowing up Sedition in every corner of the Country, these flying
Choristers were asserting the Rights of Monarchy, and proclaiming Loyalty in
every street. The mis-inform'd Rabble began to listen; they began to hear to
Truth in a SONG, in time found their Errors, and were charmed into Obedience.
Those that despise the Reverend Prelate in the Pulpit, and the Grave Judge on
the Bench; that will neither submit to the Laws of God or Man, will yet lend an
itching Ear to a New SONG, nay, and often become a Convert by It, when all
other means prove ineffectual. Divine Herbert has it excellently expressed, where
he says, A Verse may find him who a Sermon flies,
And turn Delight into a Sacrifice.
It cannot be imagined how many scattered Flocks this melodious Tingling has
reduced to their Princely Hives, who otherwise had never been brought under the
Discipline of Obedience or Government.

And, without ostentation, I may say, I printed my Newspapers (that always*
vindicated the King and Government) to undeceive the People, who were daily
imposed upon by Curtis, Smith, Harris, Care, Vile, Baldwin, Janeway, etc. when
no body else would or durst. For This the malice of the Factious Party swelled
so high against me, that They, with the assistance of a certain Instrument,
(who swore through two Brick-walls before Oats appeared) caused me to be
imprisoned six times, so that for near five years I was never free from
Trouble, having seldom less than 3, or 4 Indictments at a Sessions against Me;
at other times Information upon Information in the Crown-Office, which
villainous contrivances of their Agents, cost Me at last 500 l. in Money,
besides the loss of My Trade and Reputation; The principal Crimes they alleged
against Me, were, Let Oliver now be forgotten* a Song; A Hue and Cry after T.
O. when turned from White Hall; The Character of an Ignoramus Doctor; A
Dialogue between the Devil and the Doctor; The Prisoners Lamentation for the
loss of Sheriff Bethel; And at last for Oates's Manifesto* All which Phamphlets
tended to no other evil than the laying open the Villainies of Oats and the
rest of his Perjured Disciples: But (thanks be to God) Tempora mutantur, etc.
and Truth daily shines more and more.

These Collections (being of so much use to detect the Scandalous Lies and
Falsehoods of the Factious, and to keep the strong-headed Beast within the Reins
of Obedience) I thought fit to publish, that the World may see I have not been
idle in the worst of times, but have done my endeavor (to the utmost of my
Talent) for the Interest of the KING and Government; which, That they may
flourish in spite of all his Adversaries, ^s the hearty prayer of

Your most Humble Servant, N. T.

A Collection of New Loyal SONGS, Made since the beginning of the PLOT.
The Tune, How Unhappy is Phillis in Love.
1.
LEt Oliver now be forgotten,
His Policy's quite out of Doors,
Let Bradshaw and Hewson lie rotten,
Like Sons of Phanatical Whores:
For Tony's grown a Patrician,
By Voting damned Sedition,
For many years,
Famed Politician,
The Mouth of all Presbyter Peers.
2.
Old Tony a Turn-coat at Worster,
Yet swore he would maintain the King's Right;
But Tony did Swagger and Bluster,
Yet never drew Sword on his side.
For Tony is like an old Stallion,
He has still the Pox of Rebellion,
And never was sound;
Like the Camelion,
Still changing his Shape and his Ground.
3.
Old Rowley's returned (Heavens bless Him)
From Exile and Danger set free;
Old Tony made have to Address him,
And swore none more Loyal than he
The King, who knew him a Traitor,
And saw him squint like a Satyr;
Yet through his Grace
Pardoned the Matter,
And gave him since the Purse and the Mace.
4.
And now little Chancellor Tony,
With Honor had Feathered his Wing,
And carefully picked up the Money,
But never a Groat for the King:
But Tony's Luck was confounded;
The Duke who smoked him a Roundhead;
From Head to Heel
Tony was sounded,
Great York soon put a spoke in his Wheel.
5.
But now little Tony in Passion,
Like Boy that had nettl'd his Breech,
Maliciously took an occasion,
To make a most delicate Speech;
He told the King like a Croney;
If e're he hoped to have Money,
He must be Ruled:
Oh fine Tony!
Was ever Potent Monarch so schooled?
6.
The King issues out a Proclamation,
By Learned and Loyal Advice;
But Tony possesses the Nation
The Council will never be wise:
For Tony is madder and madder,
And Monmouth's blown like a Bladder,
And L -- e too,
Who grows gladder,
That they Great York are like to subdue.
7.
But Destiny shortly will cross it,
For Tony's grown Gouty and Sick,
In spite of his Spiggot and Fawcet
The Statesman must go to Old Nick:
For Tony rails at the Papists,
Yet he himself is an Atheist;
Though so precise,
Foolish and Apish,
Like holy Quack or Priest in Disguise.
8.
But now let this Rump of the Law see,
A Maxim as Learned in part;
Who e're with his Prince is too saucy,
It Is feared he is a Traitor in's heart,
Then Tony cease to be witty,
By buzzing Treason in the City;
And love the King,
So ends my Ditty,
Or else let him die like a Dog in a string.
The Whigs Exaltation, a Pleasant New Song,
to an Old Tune of Forty One.
1.
NOw, now the Tories all shall stoop.
Religion and the Laws,
And Whigs on Commonwealth get up
To ^a^ the Good Old Cause;
Tantivy-Boys shall all go down,
And Haughty Monarchy,
The ^eathern-Cap shall brave the Throne;
Then Hey Boys up go we.
2.
When once that Antichristian Crew
Are crushed, and overthrown,
We Will teach the Nobles how to bow,
And keep their Gentry down,
Good manners has a bad repute,
And tends to Pride we see;
We Will therefore cry all Breeding down
And Hey Boys up go we.
3
The Name of Lord shall be abhorred,
For every man's a Brother;
What reason's then in Church or State
One man should Rule another?
Thus having Peeled and Plundered all,
And levelled each Degree,
We Will make their plump young Daughters fall,
And Hey Boys up go we.
4.
What though the KING and Parliament
Cannot accord together,
We have good Cause to be content,
This is our Sunshine weather;
For if good Reason should take place,
And they should both agree,
D'zounds who would be in a Roundheads case?
For Hey then up go we.
5.
We Will down with all the 'Versities
Where Learning is profes^:
For they still Practice, and Maintain
The Language of the Beast;
We Will Exercise in every Grove,
And Preach beneath a Tree;
We Will make a Pulpit of a Tub,
Then Hey Boys up go we.
6.
The Whigs shall Rule Committee-Chair,
Who will such Laws invent,
As shall Exclude the Lawful Heir
By Act of Parliament:
We Will cut His Royal Highness down,
Even shorter by the Knee,
That He shall never reach the Throne,
Then Hey Boys up go we.
7.
We Will Smite the Idol in Guild Hall,
And then (as we were wont,)
We Will cry it was a Popish Plot,
And swear those Rogues have don't;
His Royal Highness to Un-throne
Our Interest will be,
For if He e're Enjoy His own,
Then Hey Boys up go we.
8.
We Will break the Windows which the Whore
Of Babylon has Painted;
And when their Bishops are pulled down,
Our Elders shall be Sainted:
Thus having quite Enslaved the Throne,
Pretending to set free,
At length the Gallows claims its own,
Then Hey Boys up go we.
An Excellent New Hymn, Exalting the Mobile to Loyalty, etc.
To the Tune of Forty One.
1.
LEt Us advance the Good Old Cause;
Fear not Tantivitiers,
Whose Threatenings are as Senseless, as
Our Jealousies and Fears;
It Is We must perfect this great work,
And all the Tories slay,
And make the King a Glorious Saint
The clean contrary way.
2.
It is for Liberty we Plot,
And for the Public Good,
By making Bishops go to pot,
And shedding Guiltless Blood;
We Will Damn the Orthodoxal Beast,
And their Adherents slay;
When these are down, we shall be blessed
The clean contrary way.
3.
When We the King have Bankrupt lain,
Of Power and Crown bereft Him,
And all his Loyal Subjects slain,
And none but Rebels left him;
When we have quite undone the Land,
By Ignoramus sway
We Will settle the Succession, and
The clean contrary way.
4.
It Is to preserve His Majesty,
That we against him rise,
The Righteous Cause can never die
That Is managed by the Wise,
The Association's a just thing,
And that does seem to say,
Who fights for us, fights for the King
The clean contrary way.
5.
Religion still must be the intent,
The Nations Peace and Good,
The Privledge of Parliament
So rarely Understood;
We Will pull the Laws and Reason down,
And teach men to obey
Their Sovereign, and the Rights of the Crown
The clean contrary way.
6.
Our Properties we will upwards set,
By Imprisonment and Plunder,
And Needy Whigs Preferment get*
To keep all Tories under:
We Will keep in Pension Oats and Prance,
To Swear and to Betray
The Interest of the King, To Advance
The clean contrary way.
7.
What though the King be now misled
By the Old Popish Crew?
He Will find our Honesty has sped,
And give us all our due;
For we (he knows) do Rail and Plot,
Rebellion to Obey,
And that we stand for Peace and* Truth
The clean contrary way.
8.
And now my Noble Contrymen
You cannot doubt my Zeal,
That we have so true and Loyal been
To King and Commonweal;
And if at last we chance to Hang
For what we do or say;
Our comfort is, to Heaven we Gang
The clean contrary way.
A Song on His Royal Highness's return from Scotland.
To the Tune of, Hey Boys up go we.
1.
NOw, now the Zealots all must droop,
The Synagogues shall down,
And Truth and Loyalty get up,
The Pillars of the Throne;
The Whigs (who Loyalty forsook)
Shall with one Voice agree,
To welcome home the mighty Duke
Of York and Albany.
2.
Behold with what a Glorious Train
Of Noble Lords and Peers,
Great York is Guarded over the Main,
In spite of all our Fears*
Our Groundless Doubts and Jealousies
Of Popish Slavery.
For who can keep the Crowd in Peace,
But York and Albany.
3.
The Wandering Dove that was sent forth
To find some Landing near,
When Englands Ark was toss^d on Floods
Of Jealousies and Fears;
Returns with Olive Branch of Joy,
To set the Nation free
From Whiggish Rage, that would destroy
Great York and Albany.
4^
And now He is returned in Peace,
With all His Pompous Train,
Whom Heaven protected over the Seas,
To bless this Land again?
Let us with thankful Hearts comply,
And Joyful Harmony;
For Scotlands Hope, and Englands Joy,
Is York and Albany.
5.
Let Bumpers flow, and Bonfires blaze,
And every Steeple Ring,
To set forth Royal Jemmy's Praise,
The Brother of our King:
Let Trumpets sound, and Cannons roar,
And with one voice agree,
Since Heaven again has brought ashore
Great York and Albany.
6,
These solemn Rights they freely gave
To ev'y Factious Brother;
Who thought the Nation to Enslave,
And ruin one another;
To Monmouth, and each Factious Lord,
To Oats and Shaftsbury;
But thought it Treason to afford
To York and Albany.
7.
Now be confounded, all you Tribe
Of Ignoramus sway;
Who by Malicious Plots contrived
To drive the Heir away,
(As you did once before to France)
An Exile over the Sea;
Who (to your grief) did home advance
Great York and Albany.
8.
And may He, with the Joys He wed,
Together flourish still;
And live to crush the Serpents head,
Whose Sting did pierce his heel,
Till Rebels tremble at his Name,
And all the Land agree,
The just Succession to Procliam
Of York and Albany.
The Riddle of the Roundhead.
To the Tune, Now at last the Riddle is Expounded.
1.
NOw at last the Riddle is Expounded,
Which so long the Nation has confounded,
For the Roundhead
Begins the Game again,
Which so well they played in Forty four,
Now with greater hope;
For the fine Sham-plots will never give over,
Till they piously have routed King and Pope.
2.
Anthony that worm of Reformation,
Who of Commonwealth has laid Foundation,
Which the Nation
So hotly does pursue;
Let him be rewarded in the Tower,
For his Merits due:
By that busy Plotting head laid lower,
We may perhaps escape what might ensue.
3.
Perkin make fine legs to the shouting Rabble,
Who to make him King he thinks are able;
But the Bauble
Is only showed for use:
The silly Idiot serves but for a Tool still,
For Knaves to work their Feats,
And will remain but a dull mistaken Fool still,
For all their damned Cabals and Wapping Treats.
4.
The most zealous Parliament devoted,
For the Public good devoutly voted,
Pray note it,
That the Duke must never be King;
And like honest faithful loyal Subjects,
His Majesty implore,
To sign their Pious and Religious Projects,
Or else the threatened King must reign no more.
5.
The renowned work of Reformation,
To be carried on throughout the Nation,
In a Passion
They Vote the Canons down:
Acts and Statutes all must be confounded,
Law and Justice too,
To make way for the proud rebellious roundhead
That they once more the Nation may undo.
6.
Lords and Bishops both are useless Voted,
And the factious crew who gravely Plotted,
Are noted
For Lords and Commons too,
Whigs and Brumighams with shams and stories,
Are True Protestants,
And Protestants are Masquerates and Tories,
The Modern Reformation of the Saints.
7.
Old Queen Bess that made the best Indentures,
Good King Jemmy too against Dissenters,
He ventures*
To turn them out of doors;
To take in Quakers Puritans and Ranters,
The Parliament implores,
To build a Kirk of Whigs and Covenanters,
And make a Lawful Race of Sons of Whores.
8.
Rowley now with Wisdom and grave Reason,
To prevent the swift approaching Treason,
In season
Put a period to their strife;
In Oxford all their stratagem^ confounded,
The Roguish Joyner too;
And may no better Fate attend the Roundhead,
That would the Church and Monarchy subdue.
6.
Oxford Loyal Youths who scorn to sham us,
With a perjured Bill of Ignoramus,
Or name us
For Loyal, Traitors known;
Soon found a flaw in the bottom of the Joyner,
By Justice and the Laws,
Of Church and Commonwealth an Underminer,
Who fell a Martyr in the Good Old Cause.
10.
Now for shame ye Zealots be confounded,
Boast no more Allegiance, since a Roundhead
Is grounded
Upon the Holy Sham:
How dare ye talk of Loyalty, a Hater
Of Justice, King and Laws,
Since the Whiggish Protestant is found a Traitor,
And dies a Martyr in the Good Old Cause.
Ignoramus: An Excellent Song.
To the Tune of, Lay by your Pleading
1
SInce Reformation
With Whig's in Fashion,
There Is neither Equity nor Justice in the Nation,
Against their Furies,
There no such Cure is,
As lately has been wrought by Ignoramus-Juries.
Compaction of Faction
That breeds all Distraction,
Is at the Zenith Point, but will not bear an Action.
They sham us, and flam us,
And ram us, and damn us,
And then in spite of Law, come off with Ignoramus.
2
Oh, how they Plotted,
Brimi^hams Voted
And all the Mobile the Holy Cause promoted;
They preached up Treason,
At every season,
And taught the Multitude Rebellion was but Reason,
With Breaches, Impeaches,
And most Loyal Speeches,
With Royal Blood again to glut the thirsty Leeches.
They sham us and flam us, etc.
3
It Is such a Jury
Would pass no Tory,
Were he as Innocent as a Saint in Glory:
But let a Brother
Ravish his Mother,
Assassinate his King, he would find no other.
They shamed, and blamed,
At Loyallists aimed;
But when a Whig's reprieved the Town with Beacons flamed
They sham us and flam us, etc.
4
This Ignoramus
With which they sham us,
Would find against a York, to raise a M -- thamus
Who clears a Traitor;
And a King Hater
Against his Lawful Prince would find sufficient matter
They sought it, and wrought it,
Like Rebels they fought it,
And with the price of Royal Martyrs blood they bought it*
They sham us, and flam us, etc.
5
At the Old Bailey,
Where Rogues flock daily,
A greater Traitor far then Coleman, White or Staley
Was late Indicted,
Witnesses cited,
But then he was set free; so the King was righted
Against Princes, Offenses
Proved in all senses;
But against a Whig there is no Truth in Evidences*
They sham us, and flam us, etc.
6
But wot you what, Sir?
They found it not, Sir;
'Twas every Jurors Case, and there lay all the Plot, Sir.
For at this season,
Should they do reason,
Which of themselves would escape, if they found it Treason?
Compassion in fashion,
The Interest of the Nation
Oh, what a Godly point is self-preservation!
They sham us, and flam us, etc.
7
Alas what is Conscience
In Baxter's own sense,
When Interest lies at stake, an Oath and Law is Nonsense.
Now they will banter
Quaker and Ranter,
To find a Loyallist, and clear a Covenanter.
They Will wrangle and brangle,
The Soul entangle,
To save the Traitors Neck from the old Triangle.
They flam us, and sham us, etc.
8
Alas! for pity
Of this good City,
What will the Tories say in their drunken Dity?
When all Abettors.
And Monarch-haters,
The Brethren damned their Souls to save Malicious Traitors
But mind it, long winded,
With prejudice blinded,
Lest what they did reject, another Jury find it
Then sham us, and flam us.
And ram us, and damn us.
When against King and Law you find an Ignoramus
London's Loyalty,
To a Pleasant New Tune, Called Burton-Hall.
1
ROwze up Great Genius
Of this Potent Land,
Lest Traitors once more
Get the upper hand;
The Rebel Crowd their
Former Tenants own,
And Treason worse than Plagues
Infect the Town:
The Sneaking Mayor
And his two Pimping Shreeves,
Who for their honesty
No better are then Thieves;
Fall from their Sov'raigns side,
To Court the Mobile,
Oh! London, London,
Where Is thy Loyalty?
2
First, Yorkshire Patience
Twirls his Copper Chain;
And hopes to see a
Commonwealth again;
The Sneaking Fool
Of breaking is afraid*
Dares not change^ is side
For fear he lose his Trade;
Then Loyal Slingsby
Does their Fate Divine --
He that Abjured the King*
Bnd all his Sacred Line,
And is supposed His Fathers
Murderer to be;
Oh! Bethel, Bethel,
Where Is thy Loyalty?
3
A most Noto^ious Villain
Late was caught,
And after to the Bar
Of Justice brought;
But ^lingsby pack^r a Jury
Of his own,
Of worser Rogues then e're
Made Gallows groan^
Then Dugdales Evidence
was soon decry'd,
That was s^ just, and honest^
When Old Stafford died:
Now was a perjured Villain,
And he ly'd.
Oh! Justice, Justice,
Where Is thy Equity?
4
Now Cl -- ton, murmures
Treason, unprovoked,
First supped the King, and after
Wished him choked,
'Cause Danby's Place was
Well bestowed before,
He Rebel turns, seduced
By Scarlet Whore;
His saucy Pride aspires
To High Renown,
Leather Breeches are forgot
In which he trudg^d to Town,
Naught but the Treasury
Can please the scribbling Clown
Oh! Robin, Robin,
Where^s thy Modesty?
5
Pl -- er now grows dull,
And pines for want of Whore;
Poor Creswel, she can take
His word no more,
Three Hundred Pounds,
Is such a heavy yoke,
Which not being paid,
The worn out Bawd is broak,
These are the Instruments
By Heaven sent,
These are the Saints Petition
For a Parliament:
That would for Interest sake,
Destroy the Monarchy:
Oh! London, London,
Where Is thy Loyalty?
6
Heaven Bless Fair England,
And i'ts Monarch here,
In Scotland, Bless your
High Commissioner,
Let Perkin his ungracious
Error see
And Tony escape no more
The Triple Tree:
Then Peace and plenty
Shall our joys restore,
Villains and Factions
Shall oppress the Town no more.
But every Loyal Subject
Then shall happy be,
Nor need we care
For Londons Loyalty.
The Loyal Health. A Court Song,
to a Delicate new Tune.
1.
SInce Plotting's a Trade,
Like the rest of the Nation:
Let 'em Lie and Swear on,
To keep up the Vocation;
Let Tinkers and Weavers,
And Joyners agree*
To find work for the Cooper,
They Will have none of me,
Let Politic Shams,
In the Statesmen abound,
While we quaff off our Bumpers,
And set the Glass round:
The jolly true Toper's
The best Subject still,
Who drinks off his Liquor,
And thinks no more ill.
2.
Then let us stand to it,
And like honest Men fall,
Who love King and Country*
Duke, Duchess and all:
Not such as would blow up
The Nation by stealth,
And out of the flame
Raise a new Commonwealth:
Not such, who against Church
And Bishops do rage,
To advance old Jack Presbyter,
on the new Stage.
But to all honest Tories
Who Will fight for their King,
And to Crown the brave work,
With the Court we will begin.
3.
Here Is a Health to the King,
And his Lawful Successors
To honest Tantivies,
And Loyal Addressors;
But a pox take all those,
That promoted Petitions*
To Poison the Nation,
And stir up Seditions*
Here Is a Health to the Queen,
And her Ladies of Honor,
And a pox take all those,
that put Sham plots upon her.
Here Is a Health to the Duke,
And the Senate of Scotland,
And to all honest Men,
That from Bishops never got-Land.
4
Here Is a Health to L'estrange,
And the boon Heraclitus:
And true Tory Thompson,
Who never did slight us,
And forgetting Broom, Paulin,
And Alderman Wrightus,
With Tony and Bethel,
Ignoramus and Titus;
Here Is a Health to the Church,
And all those that are for it,
Confusion to Zealots,
And Whigs that abhor it,
May it ever be safe,
From the new mode Refiners:
And may Justice be done
Upon Coopers and Joyners.
5.
Here Is a Health to old Hall --,
Who our joys did restore;
And a pox take each popular
Son of a Whore;
To the Spaniard and Dane,
The brave Russian and Moor,
Who come from far Nations,
Our King to adore,
To all that do Worship,
The God of the Vine,
And to old Jolly Bowman
Who draws us good Wine;
And as for all Traitors,
Whether Baptist or Whig,
May they all trot to Tyburn,
To dance the old Jig.
6
Here Is a Health to all those,
Who Love the King and his Laws,
And may they near Pledge it
That Broached the Old Cause
Here Is a Health to the State,
And a Plague on the Pack
Of Commonwealth Canters*
And Presbyrer Jack;
To the uppermost pendent
That ever did play
On the highest Top-gallant
Oth' Sovereign of the Sea;
And he that denies
To the Standard to lore,
May he sink in the Ocean,
And never Drink more.
The Loyal Scot; an Excellent New Song,
To a New Scotch Tune.
1.
BRed of Gued! I think the Nation's man
And nene but Knaves and perjured Loo^ do rule the Roast;
And for an honest Kerl ne living's to be had
Why sure the Deel is landed on the Engl^ Coast.
I have never been here sin' Forty Three,
And now through Scotland gang, to'l see o^ Gracious KING;
But wunds a Gued! instead of Mirth an^ Mery-glee,
I find and s^iv'ling Presbyter is coming in.
2.
For they talk of horrid Popish Plots, and Heaven knows what,
When au the wiser World knows well what they would be at;
For with sike like seeming Sanctity the geudest KING
They did to Death and Ruin bring.
When on the Civil-broils they first did enter in,
(As well ye ken) with Popery they did begin*
And with Liberty and Public Geud was muckle din,
When the Deel a bit they meant the Thing.
3*
That Machine of monstrous Policy,
Ise mean old Shaftsbury for Loyalty so ^am'd
The voice of all the Geudly Rabble Mobile,
The fausest Loon that ever Envy destined Damned
Heaven sure never meant so fou a thing,
But to inform the world where Villainy did dwell:
And sike a Traitor beath to Commonwealth and KING
The muckle Deel did surely never hatch in Hell.
4.
For, like Roman Cataline, to gain his Pious Ends,
He pimps for au the loose Rebellious Fops in Toon:
And with Treats and Treason daily crams his City Friends,
From the Link^man to the Scarlet-Goon.
And with high Debauchery they carry on the CAUSE,
And Guedly Reformation is the Sham pretense*
And Religiously defy Divine and Humane Laws,
With Obedience to their Rightful Prince.
5.
Then, as SPEAKER, to this Grand Cabal,
Old Envy Tony, seated at the head o^th' Board,
His learned Oration for Rebellion makes to All,
Applauded and approved by every Factious LORD.
Cully JEMMY then they vote for KING,
Whom Curse confound for being sike a senseless Loon
Can they who did their Lawful Lord to the Scaffold bring
Be just to Him, that has no Title to a Croon?
6.
But they find he is a Blockhead fitting for their Use,
A FOOL by Nature, and a KNAVE by Custom grown.
A Gay Fop-Monarch, that the Rabble may abuse
And their business done, will soon unthrone.
And Jemmy swears and vows, 'gan he can get the Croon,
He by the Laws of Forty Ene will guided be:
And Profane Lawn-sleeves and Surplices again must done,
Then hey for and PRESBYTERY.
7.
B -- m a Statesman would be thought,
And reason geud that he should bear that reverend Name,
Since he was ene of them that first began the PLOT,
How he the King might Banter, and three Kingdoms Sham.
Au the Malcontents His Noble Grace
To this Rehearsal did invite, to hear and see:
But, whilst He wittily contrived it but a Farce,
The busier Noddles turned it into Tragedy.
8.
And now each Actor does begin to play his part,
And too so well he cons his Geer, and takes his Cue,
Till they learn to play the Rebel so by rote of heart,
That the fictitious Story seems most True.
And now, without control, they apprehend and hang
And with the Nation au is Gospel that they swear:
Then, bonny Jockey, prithee back to'l Scotland gang,
For a Loyal Lad's in danger here.
The State Empirick, a New Song.
To the Tune of, Which no body can deny.
1.
FRom over the Seas not long since there came,
A Doctor of most Notorious Fame,
If you please you may guess at his Unchristian name.
which no body can deny.
2.
This Doctor came hither to cure three Nations.
Who were so silly as to be his Patients;
And first he Blooded 'em for the Fashions.
Which no body can deny.
3.
The Medicine he brought was called a PLOT,
Which was Compounded of the Devil knows what:
When first he Arrived it was Piping-Hot.
Which, etc.
4.
But if we may guess at the Damned Composition*
'Twas a mess of all sorts of English Sedition,
Made up by a Presbyterian Physician.
Which, etc.
5.
To make each Dose go down the safer,
What does the still this Learned Gaffer,
But cover it o'r with a Papist^s Wafer.
Which, etc.
6.
As soon as 'twas Swallowed, the Patient began
To Stare and to Talk like a Lunatic Man,
Of Pistols and Daggers, to Kill and Trapan.
Which, etc.
7.
To some 'twas Emetick, to others Cathartick,
(I mean, to all those who of it did partake,)
In short, it made every Honest Man's heart-ake.
Which, etc.
8.
To say truth we were all in a filthy Condition
This voided a Libel, that Spewed a Petition,
For which we may thank in part our Physician.
Which, etc.
9.
At last it made our Blood so ferment,
That a Rancorous Sore from Men's Body's was sent:
The Ulcer, I mean, of a strange Parliament.
Which, etc.
10.
It Is Venom upon each Member was shed;
The Body it almost had overspread,
Nay, it had even like to have seized on the Head.
Which, etc.
11.
But one wiser then all, did giv't such a Thump,
That it burst and went out, just next to the Rump.
Which made with Joy every Loyal Heart Jump.
Which* etc.
12.
This Ulcer was full of Pistol and Sword,
With Blunderbuss and with your things made of Board,
Your Protestant Flayls to Fight for the Lord.
Which, etc
13.
O Doctor! I fear, you studied Art Magic,
To Compass your Ends, which still were so Tragic:
But now it is hoped that we may lead You a Jig.
Which, etc.
14.
Or else I am sure, without being uncivil,
A Man my believe you deal with the Devil,
For no body else could have wrought us
such Evil. Which, etc.
15.
Your Canting was Charm, Rebellion your Witch,
With these you gave the Poor Rabble the Itch,
When like Emp'rick on Stage you made 'em a Speech.
Which, etc.
16.
You Are Jilted you see by Faction your Whore,
Your little Tap-Pug can help you no more:
Hell ow's Both a Spite, and will pay ye the score.
Which no body can deny.
Titus Tell-Troth: A Song
to the Tune of, Hail to the Myrile Shades.
1.
HAil to the Knight of the Post;
To Titus the Chief of the Town
Titus who vainly did boast
Of the Salamancha Gown;
Titus who saw the world over,
From the Tower of Valadolid,
Yet stood in the White-horse Door,
And swore to it, like the Creed.
2.
Titus at Watton in May,
To Titus at Islington;
And Titus the self same day
Both Here and There again.
Titus who never swore Truth,
His Politic Plots to maintain,
And never yet bawk'd an Oath,
When called to the Test again.
3.
Then Titus was Meekest of all,
When Never a Penny in's Purse,
And often did on Pickering call,
His Charity to Imburse.
But when he swore Damnable Oaths,
And Lying esteemed no Sin,
Then Titus was One of those
Whom the Devil had entered in.
4.
Then Titus the Frown of Heaven,
And Titus a Plague upon Earth;
Titus who will never be Forgiven,
Cursed from his Fatal Birth;
Titus the Curse and the Doom
Of the Rich and the Poor Man too;
Oh Titus, thou Shred of a Loom,
What a plague do thou mean to do?
5.
Titus an Orthodox Beast,
And Titus a Presbyter Tall;
Titus a Popish Priest,
And Titus the shame of all;
Titus who never had the skill
The Wise with his Plots to deceive
But Titus whose Tongue can kill;
Whom Nature has made a Sla*
6.
Titus the Light of the Town,
Where Zealots and Whigs do resort;
Titus the Shame of the Gown,
And Titus the Scorn of the Court;
Titus who Spewed out the Truth,
To Swallow the Covenant;
Yet never blushed at an Oath,
Whom Lying has made a Saint.
7.
Yet Titus believed could be
Against any Popish Lord;
Whilst still against Shaftsbury
The Witness and Truth^s abhorred;
So Titus got Credit and Gold
For Lying, an thought it no Sin;
But against Dissenters bold
The Truth is not worth a pin.
8.
Thus Titus Swore on a pace,
Against those whom he never did see;
Yet Titus with brazen Face
Would our Preserver be.
But as Titus the foremost in Trust
Discovered this Mystery:
May Titus so be the First
That leads to the Triple-Tree.
The Complete Swearing-Master:
To the Tune of, Now now the Fight's done.
1.
ONce on a time, the Dr. did Swea^,
By the help of his Friend the Prince of the Air.
He was busy in Consult, one day in Spain,
And on the same day in England again,
And the Dr. did wear that Noble Don John,
Though little and Fair, was a tall black Man.
2.
The Dr. Swore he brought Commissions to Town
From Father Oliva, to men of Renown:
To raise mighty Force, the King to destroy,
For which many Ruffians the Pope did employ;
And the Dr. did Swear that little Don John,
Was Black, and also a very tall Man.
3.
That forty thousand Pilgrims there were,
Armed with Black Bills, that marched in the Air
And ready to strike when the Pope should command,
And carry to Rome poor little England.
And the Dr. did Swear as few others can,
That little Don John is a tall black Man.
4.
And the Dr. did Swear he had Letters full many
But for all he Swore, he never produced any,
It Is much he kept none to make out the matter
But it may be he lost them, in crossing the Water;
But that is all one the Dr. Swore on,
That little Don John was a tall black Man.
5.
He swore two hundred thousand pounds sent
To Ireland, which was all to be Spent:
In Squibs to burn houses, Ammunition and Bills,
And pay Popish Doctors for King Killing Pills:
Which he swore had been done if the Plot had gone on,
And then Swore Don John a very tall Man.
6.
And the Dr. did swear he knew not some men,
Yet afterward swore, he knew them again;
And the Dr. did Swear by the fair candlelight
He could not discern a Man from a Mite:
But believe him who will, for I hardly can,
That little Don John is a tall black Man.
7.
And he swore he always a Protestant was,
And never cared a Fart for Pope or for Mass,
And he Swore he went to St. Omers to find
What the Jesuits had against England designed.
And the Dr. did swear, deny it who can,
That little Don John was a tall black Man
8.
And the Dr. did swear a thousand things more
That discovering the plot had made him so poor,
And he swore himself 700 pounds worse,
But a pox of all lies, take that with a curse:
But I le not beleiv't, although others can,
That little Don John is a tall black Man.
9.
Now if it should please the Dr. to swear
To keep his hand in, a Man is a Bear;
Or the Dr. will swear his Soul to the Devil,
He wall do it for me, I love to be Civil;
Every man in his way, let the Dr. swear on,
But I beg his excuse in the size of Don John.
10.
The Dr. may swear the Crow to be white,
Or a Pigmey to be of Gygantick height,
Or double his numbers of Pilgrims and Bills,
And swear them drawn up in Lincolns-Inn-fields.
I hear't and believed as much as I can,
That little Don John is a tall black Man,
11.
There Is no stopping the tide, let the Dr. swear on.
The black is the fair, or the fair the black Man,
Or swear what he will I care not a T --,
I Would as soon as his, take another man's word:
So Dr. be damned and Swear all you can,
Don John is not tall, nor yet a black Man:
A Tory in a Whig's Coat:
To the Tune of, Up with Aley, etc.
1.
WHat! still ye Whigs uneasy!
Will nothing coll your Brain,
Unless Great Charles, to please-ye,
Will let ye drive his Wain?
Then up with Prance and Oats,
And up with Knaves a pair;
But down with him that Votes
Against a Lawful Heir.
2.
Your Grievance is removed,
Old Staufford's made a Saint,
Though you but little proved,
The Karle away you sent.
Then up with all your spite,
And show us what you mean;
I fear me, by this Light,
Ye long to vent your Spleen.
3.
That Peerless House af Commons.
So zealous for the Lord,
Meant (piously) with some on's
To flesh the Godly Sword:
Then up with au the Leaven,
With each Dissenting Loon,
Then up with Bully Stephen;
But College is gone done.
4.
What would those Loons have had?
What makes 'em still to mutter?
I think thy're au gone mad,
They keep so muckle clutter:
Then up with Pilk and Suit,
Another Blessed Pair;
And up with every Brute;
But chiefly Goatham's Mayo*
5.
Our Salamancha-Priest
Has left his Flock in have;
And shrevvdly is he mist;
Which makes us all gast:
Then up with Lads of vvorth,
With Baldwin, V^le and Care;
For these must now hold forth,
And Dick shall nose a Prayer.
But is our Parson gone;
And whither gone I trow?
What, back again to Spain?
Gued Faith e'n let him go:
Then up with blundering S.
The Tories Plague, I trow;
It Is he our Cause must bless
With Characters, and so. --
7.
But scurvy Heraclitus,
And Roger too is rude,
And Not, who plagues poor Titus,
Which makes us chew the Cud:
Then up with Associations,
Remonstrances and Libels;
It Is these must save Three Nations,
And will presreve our Bibles
8.
The Popish Fox does seem
To sleep his time away;
But his pernicious Dream
Is only to Betray:
Then up with How. the Mole,
And many more that be;
But up with Little Pole
Upon the highest Tree.
9.
Hieraclitus is a Debtor,
To some within the City,
Who sent him sike a Letter,
He Will pay them in a Ditty:
Then up with au Dissenters,
Up with 'em in a Cart:
And up with him that ventures
His Majesty to thwart.
10.
But now Great YORK is come,
(Whom Heaven still be with)
You Will find (both all and some)
'Twas ill to show your Teeth:
Then up with e^ry Roundhead,
And every Factious Brother,
You're Luck is now confounded.
Ye au must up together.
The Protestant FLAYL:
To the Tune of, Lacy's Maggot; Or, The Hobbyhorse.
1.
LIsten a while, and I Will tell you a Tale
Of a new Device of a Protestant Flayl;
With a Thump, Thump, Thump, a Thump,
Thump, a Thump, Thump.
This FLAYL it was made of the finest vvood,
Well lined with Lead, and notable good,
For splitting of Brains, and shedding of blood
Of all that withstood,
With a Thump, Thump, etc.
2.
This Flayl was invented to thrash the Brain,
And leave behind not the vvait of a grain,
With a Thump, etc.
At the handle-end there hung a Weight,
That carried with it unavoidable Fate,
To take the Monarch a rap in the Pate,
And govern the State.
With a Thump, etc.
3.
It took its degree in Oxford-Town,
And with the Carpenter went down,
With a Thump, etc.
If any durst his Might oppose,
He had you close, in spite of your Nose,
To carry on clever the Good Old Cause,
And down with the Laws,
With a Thump, etc.
4
With this they threatened to fore-stall
The Church, and give the Bishops a Mawl
With a Thump, etc.
If King and Lords would not submit
To the Joyner's will while the House did sit,
If this in the right place did hit,
The cause it would split,
With a Thump, etc.
5.
Two handfuls of Death, with a Thong hung fast,
By a Zealot who hanged himself at last,
With a Thump, etc.
With a moving head both stiff and stout,
Found by the Protestant Joyner out,
To have at the King and the Laws the other bout*
And turn them both out,
With a Thump, etc.
6.
Invinsibly 'twou'd deal his Blovvs,
All to maintain the Good Old Cause,
With a Thump, etc
Would Liberty and Freedom bring
To every thing except the King,
At Monarchy it had a fling,
And took its svving,
With a Thump, etc.
7.
This Flayl was made of the Nevvest Fashion,
To heal the Breaches of the Nation,
With a Thump, etc.
If Faction any difference bred,
T^vvon'd split the Cause in the very Head,
Till Monarchy reeled, and Loyalty bled,
And were knocked in the Head,
With a Thump, etc.
8.
When any Strife was in the State,
This Flayl would end the whole Debate,
With a Thump, etc.
Against Arbitrary Power of State,
And Popery which the Zealots hate,
It would give them such a Rap on the Pate,
They must yield to their Fate,
With a Thump, etc.
9.
It had a thousand Virtues more,
And had a Salve for every Sore,
With a Thump, etc.
With this they thought to have maintained,
The Loyal Tribe, and Royalists brained:
But the Joyner was hanged, and the Flayl was Arraign^d
And the Conquest Regained,
With a Thump, etc.
10.
May Tony and all our Enemies,
Meet with no better Fate then his,
With a Thump, etc.
May Charles still live to Rule the State,
And York, (whom all Dissenters hate)
To be revenged upon their Pate,
By timely fate,
With a Thump, Thump, Thump a Thump,
Thump, a Thump, Thump.
IGNORAMUS^Justice,
To the Tune of, Sir Egledemore.
1.
DId you not hear of a Peer that was Tried?
With a fa* la, la, la, la.
That looks like a Cask with a Tap in his side;
With a fa, la, la, la, la.
This Noble Peer to the Bar was called;
The Witnessses sworn, but the Foreman outbaul'd;
With a fa, la, la, la, la.
2.
Then up Sir Samuel did start;
With a fa, la, etc.
And found the Bill not worth a F --;
With a fa, la, etc.
With that the Court kept such a stir,
The Foreman should prove so s^yll a Sir,
With a fa, la, etc.
3.
The Witnesses for the King swore plain;
With a fa, la, etc.
But had they been as many again;
With a fa, la, etc.
The Jury before such Truths received,
Nor them, nor St. Peter they would have believed;
With a fa, la, etc.
4.
The Witnesses brought him a Traitor in;
With a fa, la, etc.
But the Jury found it another thing;
With a fa, la, etc.
For he who did still his King oppose,
Is made a true Subject in spite of the Laws;
With a fa, la, etc.
5.
Thus this Great Lord of High Renown;
With a fa, la, etc.
The Exalted Idol of the Town;
With a fa, la, etc.
Is cleared by Ignoramus-sway,
For Betraying the Church and the King in a day,
With a fa, la, etc.
6.
The Rabble to show their Loyalty;
With a fa, la, etc.
Did in full shouts with the Jury agree;
With a fa, la, etc.
They Bonfires made with great applause,
And all to maintain the Good Old Cause;
With a fa, la, etc.
7.
And now in spite of King and Queen;
With a fa, la, etc.
More Jollity was in the Streets to be seen;
With a fa, la, etc.
Then on the Twenty Ninth of May,
Though it was the Restauration-day;
With a fa, la, etc.
8.
Another passage I chanc^d to hear;
With a fa, la, etc.
That the Doctor is fallen from the Front to the Rear;
With a fa, la, etc.
He to the Saints does now incline,
Abjures the King, with the Rebels Combines;
With a fa, la, etc*
9.
Yet these pretend now for to Inherit;
With a fa, la, etc.
(As Heirs do Estates) the Light of the Spirit;
With a fa, la, etc.
Yet let them say or do what they will,
They Will find themselves Ignoramus still;
With a fa, la, etc.
10.
But had it been a Popish Lord;
With a fa, la, etc.
One Witness then had served in a word;
With a fa, la, etc.
They had not then inquired so far;
But found it, and never have stepped from the Bar
With a fa, la, etc.
11.
If by this Law the Charter be lost;
With a fa, la, etc.
Will Tony's Estate repay all the Cost?
With a fa, la, etc.
The Boys will then find out the Cheat.
And de De Wit the old Cam^al in his Retreat;
With a fa, la, etc.
12.
They Will Curse that Pate that studied to bring;
With a fa, la, etc.
Plague to the Country, and Ruin to the King;
With a fa, la, etc.
Divested thus of Citophel's Pride,
They Will do him that Justice which Juries denied
With a fa, la, etc.
The Loyal Feast^;
to the Tune of Sawney will never be my Love again.
1.
TONY was small, but of Noble Race,
And was beloved of every one;
He Broached his Tap, and it ran apace
To make a Solemn Treat for all the Town
He sent to Yeoman, Knight, and Lord,
The Holy Tribe to Entertain
With all the Nation could afford,
But Tony will never be himself again.
2.
He sent to the Shambles for all their Store,
And left behind neither Fowl nor Beast;
The Spiggot ran swift and fain would do more
To make all the Lords a Noble Feast;
He sent to Market, sent to Fair,
His Loyal Guests to entertain,
But of the Banquet he had no share,
And Tony will never be himself again.
3.
At two great Halls in London Town,
Designed to meet a Zealous Crew
Of Lords and Knights of High Renown,
And all were Protestants True Blue.
They threw in Guineys free as Brass,
The Noble Frolic to Maintain,
But on Great Charles the Sham would not pass
And Tony will etc.
4.
With Duty to their Lawful Prince,
A Loyal Subject every one;
To pray for him is the Pretense,
And then to Rail and Plot against the Crown
From Church they did intend to the Hall,
Their Noble Guests to Entertain;
But they were Routed, Horse and all,
And Tony etc.
5.
In favor of the King and Duke,
The Heir-Apparent of the Throne,
His Highness they Exclude, and took
A Fop-Pretender of their own;
The meek Guide Moses they withstand,
A Golden Calf to Entertain;
But Royal Charles he dispersed the Band,
And Tony, etc.
6.
The Bloody Papists shall no more
Contrive against his Life and Reign:
Though it was themselves did the Feat before,
And are as ready to do it again.
Thus they Exclude the Rightful Heir,
The Gaudy Fop to Entertain,
But they were met by the good Lord Mayor,
And Tony etc.
7.
With thanks and Prayers for our good King
They Vowed to Sacrifice the Day;
But Royal Charles he smoked out the thing;
And sent the Rabble with a Pox away.
He sent his Summons to the Cit,
Seditious Meetings to Restrain,
The Feast was broke, and the Guests were besh --,
And Tony etc.
8
And now the Capons fly about,
With Frigaces of Ambergreece,
And Chickens ready dressed they Shout
About the Street for pence a piece:
The Whigs did wish the Council choked,
Who did this Noble Feast restrain;
All down in the Mouth to be thus bawk'd,
Poor Tony will never be himself again.
Old Jemmey.
Tune of, Young Jemmey.
1.
OLd Jemmy is a Lad
Right lawfully descended;
No Bastard born nor bred,
Nor for a Whig suspended:
The true and Lawful Heir to the Crown,
By Right of Birth and Laws,
And bravely will maintain his own,
In spite of all his Foes.
2.
Old Jemmy is the Top
And Chief amongst the Princes;
No Mobile gay Fop,
With Brimigham pretenses:
A Heart and Soul so wondrous great
And such a conquering Eye,
That every Loyal Lad fears not
In Jemmy's Cause to die.
Old Jemmy is a Prince
Of Noble Resolutions.
Whose Powerful influence
Can order our Confusions:
But Oh! He fights with such a Grace
No Force can him withstand;
No God of War but must give place
Where Jemmy leads the Van
4.
To Jemmy every Swain
Does pay due Veneration;
And Scotland does maintain
His Title to the Nation:
The Pride of all the Court he stands
The Patron of his Cause,
The Joy and Hope of all his Friends
The terror of his Foes.
5.
Maliciously they Vote,
To work Old Jemmy's Ruin,
And zealously promote
A Bill for his undoing:
Both Lords and Commons most agree
To pull His Highness down;
But ('spite of all their Policy)
Old Jemmy's Heir to the Crown.
6.
The Schismatic and Saint,
The Baptist and the Athiest,
Swear by the Covenant,
Old Jemmy is a Papist;
Whilst all the Holy Crew did plot
To pull His Highness down,
Great Albany a Noble Scot
Did raise unto a Crown.
7.
Great Albany they swear,
He before any other,
Shall be immediate Heir
Unto His Royal Brother,
Who will in spite of all his Foes,
His Lawful Rights maintain,
And all the Fops that interpose,
Old Jemmy's York again.
8.
The Whigs and Zealots Plot
To banish him the Nation,
But the Renowned Scot
Has wrought his Restoration.
With high respects they treat his Grace
His Royal Cause maintain;
Brave Albany (to Scotland's Praise)
Is Mighty York again.
9.
Against his envious Fates
The Kirk has taught a Lesson;
A Blessing on the States,
To settle the Succession.
They real were, both Knight and Lord
And will his Rights maintain;
By Royal Parliament restored,
Old Jemmy's come again.
10.
And now He Is come again,
In spite of all Pretenders,
Great Albany shall Reign
Amongst the Faiths Defenders.
Let Whig and Brimigham repine;
They show their Teeth in vain;
The Glory of the British Line,
Old Jemmy's come again.
The Honor of Great York and Albany,
to a new Tune.
1.
THe Commons now are at a stand,
And evermore I hope shall be;
For Scotland will be a help at hand,
For Great James Duke of Al-ba-ny.
For Scotland,
2.
A braver Nation he cannot have,
For Love, for Truth, for Loyalty;
Each Man will Fight into his Grave,
For great James Duke of Albany.
Each man, etc.
3.
A Soldier stout is he, and brave,
As ever any man did see,
God bless the King, and Queen, and Save
Our Great James, Duke of Albany,
God bless, etc.
4.
He very Wise, and Pious is,
There Is no Man knows the Contrary;
Then Damned be him that thinks amiss,
Of Great James Duke of Albany.
Then Damned etc.
5*
All Loyal Subjects him must love,
The Heir Apparent, still is he,
Next to the King, there is none above
Our Great James Duke of Albany.
Next to the King, etc.
6.
Then let our Reason our ill Will sway,
And every man upon his Knee,
I do not mean to drink, but Pray,
For Great James Duke of Albany.
I do not mean, etc.
7.
There Is no man is so mad to think,
That Drinking can availing be,
It Is better for to Fight than Drink,
For Great James Duke of Albany.
It Is better, etc.
8.
Yet do not think I Will bawk his Health,
But with my cup, most moderately,
I Will drink, I Will fight, and spend my wealth,
For Great James Duke of Albany.
I Will Drink, I Will fight, and spend, etc.
The Well-wishers to the Royal Family.
To a New Tune.
1.
NOw the Tories, that Glories
In Royal Jemmy's return,
The Tavern shall Roar it and Score it,
Your Caps and Bonnets burn:
Let the Lads and Lasses
Set foot foot in their Turn;
And he that passes his Glasses,
May he never Escape the Horn:
Royal James is come again,
There Is for honest men room again,
The true Heir is come again;
Fop Pretenders we scorn,
Then Hey Boys laugh it, and quaff it,
Let Whigs and Zealots mourn.
2.
Let Impeaches and Speeches
Be with the Authors pulled down;
And all that Preaches or Teaches
Against the Heir of the Crown:
No more the Zealous shall tell us
Of the Succession of the Throne;
Till the Rebellious so Zealous,
His lawful Interest own:
Monarchy is got up again,
Every Man take his Cup again,
Till we make the Whigs stoop again:
Who our Peace would enthrall:
And every Rebel that Libel'd,
Do at his Foot stool fall,
3.
Let Us be Loyal and Joy-al,
Spite of each Factious Caball,
Who daily deny all, defy all,
That we can Loyalty call;
Who Smoking, and Soaking,
With the return of the Rump,
Sadly Looking, sit Croaking,
To see it Wore to'th' Stump;
Then set the Glass Round again,
For our time let us not spend in vain,
But let us now Drink a Main,
Fill it up to the Brim:
Come round Boys let us Trowl it and Bowl it,
Till our Joys they do swim.
4.
For Him our Choices and Voices,
Shall all hereafter be free,
Whilst each one Rejoices, our Noises
Shall defend the Raging o'th Sea;
We Will attend him, befriend him,
Let Malice Vote what it will;
Coin we will Lend Him, Defend Him,
And we will rejoice in Him still:
Then let us no Mirth refrain,
Since that now he is safe again,
Well having escaped the Main;
From the Salt Waters set free,
Then Hey Boys laugh it, and quaff it,
And let us Merry be.
5.
Though the Zealous, grow Jealous,
And Create much needless fear,
By which means they would Drill us and Will us.
Like themselves to appear;
But no Wonder, since Plunder,
Is that at which they aim,
That the Whigs wander under
Religious Guile, which they Shame:
But at last we have found them,
And from the bottom unwound them,
So that each man may found them,
And laugh at the Old Cause,
Which was the Ruin and undoing,
Of King and Kingdoms Laws.
6.
Then let us Rout 'em and Flout 'em,
Who rails at the Succession,
That would Rout Him whom we so esteem,
Beyond all Expression;
Fill Clarret, who is for it?
And let each Bumper go round,
Who does bar it, or spare it
May he with Goats Horns be Crowned:
Here Is a Health to the Duchess,
Grant her long Life, Health, and Riches,
And a Young Prince is all our wishes,
Whilst all the Factious Repine
Then come away wi't, never stay it,
Let no man baulk his Wine.
London's Joy and Loyalty On His Royal Highnesses Return from Scotland.
1.
Rouse up ye Tories
Of this Factious Land,
Now Loyalty
Has got the Upper-hand:
The Rabble-rout
Their Errors shall disclaim,
And Homage pay
To York's Illustrious Name;
The London Mayor
Is faithful to his Trust,
And the two present Sh'riffs
Would fain be counted Just;
And every Factious Rebel
Through the Town agree
To show the height
Of London's Loyalty.
2.
Now the loud Threatening
Tempest is dispersed,
And all their shamming Plots
Are quite reversed;
Great Jemmy's happy
Restoration here
Makes a new day
In London^s Hemisphere:
The Clouds are gone
That did oppress his Reign,
And joyful day breaks forth
In this glad Land again.
Then to the Mighty Duke
Of York and Albany
Now London, London,
Show thy Loyalty.
3.
A Royal Pair
With their Illustrious Train,
To London's Joy
Are now Returned again;
Great Gracious Charles
Does in the Front appear,
And Princely York
Advances in the Rear;
The Right Successor
Is Returned again,
Whom former Faction
Sent an Exile o'r the Main,
Then to the Mighty Duke
Of York and Albany
Now London, London
Show thy Loyalty.
4.
Heave'n Bless the King,
Preserve the Lawful Heir,
Let ^ories Sing,
And Brimighams Despair:
To see Great York
Invested in his own,
Spite of all Fop
Pretenders to the Throne;
Then Truth and Justice
Shall our Joys restore;
Associations shall
Destroy our Peace no more,
But to our Gracious King,
With York and Albany
All Subjects seek*
To show their Loyalty.
The Tory Song on His Highness Return from Scotland.
To the Tune of, The Prince of Orange 's Delight.
1.
ROom, room for Cavaliers, bring us more Wine,
His Highness is Landed, about with the Glass;
The Brimigham-piece is but Counterfeit Coin
Yet fain for good Sterling among as would pass.
Hey Bowman more Wine,
Fill up to the Brim;
While Zealots repine
We'll frolic and sing;
For Oats, is confounded,
That Turn-coated Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and true to our King:
2.
A little Old Conjurer threw so much Brass,
And Pewter and Copper amongst the True Coin
That hardly a Penny of Money can pass,
But what is Clipped, Plated, or washed very fine
But thine Boy, and mine,
Bears the stamp of the King;
Then let us have more Wine,
While good Money we bring;
John Thum is confounded,
That Brazen-faced Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our King.
3.
With such a Bold, Impudent and Brazen-face
They Would pass for true Mettle, although but washed o'r;
The Kings Stamp and Image they only disgrace
As they did their Lord and Creators before;
But thine Boy, and mine,
Bears the stamp of the King,
Then let us have more Wine,
While good Money we bring;
For Care is Confounded,
That Scismatick Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our King.
4.
Yet (what is most noted) these Brimigham Elves,
To bear the true stamp are so brazen'd with Art,
That they would have nothing to pass but themselves,
Although they are but Copper and Gaul at the heart.
But thine Boy, and mine,
Bears the stamp of the King,
Then let us have more Wine,
While good Sterling we bring;
For Dick is confounded,
That Libelling Roundhead,
Then let us be Loyal, and true to our King.
5.
They call themselves Loyal, nay more, love the King
Yet Royalists, Tory and Papist mis call;
And rail at all those who stand up for the thing,
With L'strange, Heraclitus and Thompson, and all
Against these the Slaves
Their Libels they fling;
Yet they are the Knaves,
That do Libel the King;
But Langley's confounded,
That Pamphletting Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and true to our King.
6.
Thus Brimighams still the Stamp Royal rebukes
With Brazen-faced Impudence guided so fine
Who hates the King's Picture as well as the Dukes,
And loves it in nothing, unless in his Coin;
But let him still pass
For a counterfeit thing,
About with the Glass,
And merrily sing;
For Ben is confounded;
That Cuckoldly Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and true to our King.
To the King and the Queen, fill it up to the Top.
The D. and the Duchess, whom Heaven has restored;
And next, Hans in Kelder, the Royal Blew-Cap;
To all the true Issue and each Loyal Lord:
Crown every Glass,
Fill 'em up to the Brim:
About let 'em pass,
While we merrily sing;
For Baldwin's confounded,
That impudent Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and true to our King.
8.
To brave Albemarle the next we will pursue,
With Worster and Clarendon, Seymour, and Hall --
To all to their King, and their Country are true,
Who Loyalty love, and confound the Caball.
If Monarchy shine,
And Bowman but bring
Good store of brisk Wine,
We Will make the Dog ring;
For Tony's confounded,
That Spiggoted Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and true to our King.
The PLOT Crammed into Jones Placket
to the Tune of, Jones Placket is torn, etc.
1.
HAve you not lately heard
of Lords sent to the Tower,
Who against the Popish Plotters,
seemed men of chiefest power:
But now they are got into the Plot,
and all their power's in vain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and can never be mended again,
It Is rent and torn, and torn and rent,
and rent and torn in twain:
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again.
2.
Fitz-Harris they supposed
a sitting Instrument,
The Duke, the Queen, and King
himself to circumvent:
But now he is hanged and all his Gang
will follow the same strain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
3.
The Joyner he did march
to Oxford, to be Tried,
Where he did find a Jury,
who were not Whiggify'd:
And for his Joining in the Plot,
a Halter he did gain,
For the Plot is rent and torn*
and will never be mended again, etc.
4.
They say that Mr. Dugdale,
so honest and so true,
Is one of the King^s Evidence,
against this wicked Crew:
And now they aim him to defame,
but all will be in vain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
5.
The crafty Shaftsburyy,
is caught in his own Snare,
He has hired many Rogues,
themselves for to forswear:
Are now undone, with Hetherington,
and all his hired Train,
For the Plot is rent and torn
and will never be mended again, etc.
6.
Thus Innocence we see
begins for to appear,
Since Rogues for want of Pardons,
the Truth are fain to swear:
Had it been so, some years ago,
we'd hit on the right vein,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again* etc.
7.
The pious Commons Vote
it was a Popish Plot,
Which Factious Lords promote,
'twas death to think it not;
Thus piously they all agree
a Plot for to maintain,
But now '^is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
8.
Against the Lawful Heir,
full many a Bill they pass
Upon the Royal Chair
to place a gaudy Ass;
But they may ride to the Devil astride
with Noll new Plots to feign,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never he mended again, etc.
9.
When they could rail no more
of pious Lords and Peers,
To set them as before
together by the Ears;
To Shrives and Mayor they made this Prayer,
they would the Plot maintain,
But now it is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
10.
Brave Rich and Famous North,
(whom Factions did oppose)
For Loyalty and Worth,
The Noble Mayor has chose,
Who hand in hand will faithful stand
to Royal Charles's Reign,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again.
It Is rent and torn, and torn and rent;
and rent and torn in twain.
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again.
The Happy return of the Old Dutch Miller.
To the Tune of the First.
1.
GOod People of England I hope you have had
Experience of my Art in my Trade;
For I am the Miller that was here before,
That ground Women young, of four or five Score.
Then make have Customers, bring in your Tribes;
I Will quickly dispatch them without any Bribes.

I Will cure their Distempers with one Turn or Two.

Then make have Customers, etc.

Then make have Customers, etc.
5.
If any Grave Alderman Perjures and Swears,
Till he runs the great hazard of loosing his Ears.

I Will hide him in the Hopper, and Dip him in the Dam*
Then make have Customers, etc.
6.
If any Hot Zealots, or Turbulent Cits,
With Tumults and Riots run out of their Wits;
For the Toll I Will so Tame 'em, that they shall be all

Then make have Customers, etc.
7.
If you have e're a Fop that is proud of a String,

8.
If you have e're a Lord that is a Pimp to's Wife,

To make Her as Honest as e're He was Loyal.
Then make have Customers, etc.
9.

And stands for a Statesman, I Will make him as able
As ever a Helper in all his own Stable
Then make have Customers, etc.
10.
If you have e're a Lord that used to Preach
I'^h' top of a Crab Tree, above all your reach,
And still the Lords Super exposed in Lambs wool:

Then make have Customers, etc.
11.
If you have ^'re a Knight that is a Knave and Threadbare,

Then make have Customers, etc.
12.
If you have, or had, any Sheriffs that are Whigs,

Then make have Customers, etc.
13.
If you have e're a Doctor that has never a Mouth,
But a Hole in the place for a Nose, Nor. and South
Put him to my Mill, I shall make him speak sense
Behind and before, like a Quaker in Trance.
Then make have Customers, etc.

As when he came Mumping from Flanders or Spain.
Then make have Customers, etc.

Then make have Customers, bring in your Tribes,
I Will quickly dispatch them without any Bribes;
For I am so Zealous for Whiglanders Crew,

A Congratulation on the Happy Discovery of the Hellish Fanatic Plot.
Tune, Now, now the Fight's done.
1.
COme now let us rejoice, and the City Bells ring,
And the Bonfires kindle, whilst unto the King*
We pay on our knees the grand tribute that is due,
Of thanks and oblation, which now we renew,
For Mercies that we have received of late,
From Prudence and Justice diverting our Fate.
2.
The Curtain is drawn, and the Clouds are dispersed;
The Plot's come to light, that in darkness did nest,
Jack Calvin's displayed with his Colors in grain:
And who were the Traitors and Villains it is plain:
The Traps that they laid, and the snares that they set,
Have caught them at last in their own silly Net
3.
The Foreman himself, that offspring of Hell,
In whose wick'd Breast all Treason does dwell,
To the Tower was sent, with his Triple Name,
Whilst the Triple-tree groans for his Carcass again,
And many Rogues more their Leader will follow
Unto the same place, whilst we whoop and hallow.
4.
The Libelling tribe that so long have reigned
And sowed Sedition, shall now be Arraign^d;
Their Shams and their Lies shall do them no good,
When they come to the tree, there is no shamming that wood:
Janway and Curtis in the forlorn hope,
Then Vile, Smith and Care shall neck the next Rope.
5
So, so, let them dye that would Monarchs destroy,
And spit all their Venom our Land to annoy:
If that their Power were to their Malice equal,
And their Courage the same, they would soon ruin all*
But their Courage is low, and their Power but small;
Their Treason is High, and must have a Fall.
6.
When Trojans of old (our Ancestors) were
In danger of Shipwreck, and tossed here and there
Great Neptune soon quelled those Rebels and Storms,
With brandished trident, and freed them from harms;
They ^led from his Face, through guilt of their Cause,
As these from our Lion, if he stretch out his paws.
7.
Go Devils, be gone to the Region below,
Here Is no business of yours, or ought left to do:
No Tempter we need, we can act all our selves,
Without any help from you silly Elve^;
For what Presbyter act, he thinks a disgrace
All Hell should outdo him, or dare show their face.
8.
For produce all the ill that Hell ever hatched,
It Is nothing at all, when it comes to be matched
With what has been Plotted by Traitors of late,
Who aimed at the Ruin of Church, and of State:
By Perjury, Bribes, by suborning all Evil,
By Murder, and worse Than e're came from the Devil.
9.
Now Presbyter come and submit thy stiff Neck,
Thou labour'st in vain our great Monarch to check;
Whose Power Divine no Mortals control,
But hazard the loss of both Body and Soul:
Then banish for ever your Commonwealth hope,
Which tends to destruction, and ends in a Rope.
Epilogue.
With Wine of all sorts let the Conduits run free,
And each true heart drink the K's Health on his knee:
No Treason shall lodge in our breasts while we live,
To God, and to Caesar their Due we will give;
We Will pray with our hearts, and fight with our hands,
Against all Fanat. when great Charles commands.
The Loyal Sheriffs of London and Midlesex. Upon their Election.
Tune, Now at last the Riddle, etc.
1.
NOw at last the Matter is decided,
Which so long the Nation has divided;
Misguided
By Interest and blind Zeal,
Which so well in Forty four they Acted;
Now with greater heat,
They again act over like Men Distracted,
To give to Monarchy a new defeat.
2.
Famous North, of Noble Birth and Breeding,
And in Loyal Principles Exceeding;
Is pleading
To stand his Countries Friend,
To do Justice to the King and Nation,
Some so much oppose,
To renew the work of REFORMATION,
And carry on again the Good Old Cause*
3.
Next Renowned Box as high commended,
And of Loyal Parentage Descended;
Intended
To do the City Right,
With true Courage, and firm Resolution,
He the Hall Adorns;
But the Heads were all in a Confusion:
Such^d in there was and a rattling with their Horns:
4.
Prick up Ears, and push for one another,
Let not Box (an old Malignant) Brother;
Nor '^other
Our Properties command,
He Is a Kings-man, North is nothing better,
They walk Hand in Hand
He you know is the Lord Mayor's Creature:
And therefore it is not sit that they should stand*
5.
Where are now our Liberties and Freedom?
Where shall we find Friends when we should
To bleed 'em
And pull the Tory's down,
To push for our Interest, who can blame us?
Sheriffs rule the Town,
When we loose our Darling IGNORAMVS:
We lose the Combat, and the day's their own:
6.
Then let every Man stand by his Brother,
Poll over ten times, Poll for one another;
What a Pother
You see the Tory's make,
Now or never, now to save your Charter,
Or your Hearts will ache,
If it goes for them expect no Quarter:
If Law and Justice rule, our heels must shake:
7.
Rout, a Rout, join 'Prentice, Bore and Peasant,
Let the White Hall Party call it Treason,
It Is Treason
We should our Necks Defend,
Routs and Ryots, Tumults and Sedition,
Poll 'em over again,
These do best agree with our Condition;
If Monarchy prevail, we are all lost men.
8.
The Lord Mayor is Loyal in his Station,
Alas what will become o'th Reformation;
Of The Nation
If the Sheriffs be Loyal too?
Wrangle, Brangle, huff and keep a Clatter;
If we loose the Field,
Poll 'em over again, it makes no matter:
For though we loose the Day, we scorn to Yield.
9.
Ten for Box, and Twenty for Papillion,
North a Thousand, and Dubois a Million:
What Villain
Our Interest dare oppose?
With those Noble Patriots thus they sided,
To uphold the Cause;
But the good Lord Mayor the case decided:
And once again two Loyal Worthies Chose.
10.
Noble North, and Famous Box promoted,
By due Course and Legal Choice allotted;
They Voted
To be the City Sheriffs
And may they both to Londons Commendation,
Her Ancient Rights restore,
To do that Justice to the King and Nation,
Which former Factions have denied before.
Loyalty Triumphant, on the Confirmation of Mr. North and Mr. Rich, Sheriffs of
London and Middlesex.
Tune, Joy to the Bridegroom.
1.
FIll up the Bowl, and set it round,
The day is won, the Sheriffs crowned;
The Rabble flies, the Tumults yield;
And Loyalty maintains the Field;
Saint George for England, then amain,
To Royal CHARLES this Ocean drain*
2.
With Justice may it ever flow,
And in an endless Circle go;
The brim with conquering Bays be crowned,
And Faction in the Dregs lie drowned:
Then to the QVEEN, and Royal James,
Sacrifice your flowing Thames.
3.
Thanks to Sir John, our good Lord Mayor,
Against Sheriffs Tricks He kept the Chair;
The Court and City's Right maintains,
While head strong Faction broke the Reins:
Then to the famous Sir John Moor,
May after-Age that Name adore.
4.
What Zeal (ye Whigs) to the Old Cause.
Thus makes you act against the LAWS;
That none for Sheriff must contend,
But your old IGNORAMVS Friend?
But now, your hopes are all destroyed,
And your two Champions laid aside.
5.
Is this your love to Church and State,
That no good man must serve of late,
While you can find one Factious Rogue,
To sway the Poll, and get your Vogue?
By unjust means your Rights you claim,
And lawless Force maintain the same.
6
But brave Sir John, while th'storms increase,
His Wisdom made the Tumults cease;
In spite of all Illegal Poll,
The Routs and Ryots did control:
Whence He shall gain a lasting Name,
And after-Age Record His Fame.
7
Amongst the Men of chiefest worth,
The Vote is given for Loyal NORTH,
In spite of Pilkington and Shute,
Papilion, and the Rabble Rout:
Then to brave NORTH a double Doze,
Who the strong Factions did oppose.
8.
Now BOX withdraws, Dubois contends,
And Noble RICH the Stage ascends;
By Legal ('against Illegal) Vote,
The Loyal Tribune they promote:
Then to brave RICH a Health off hand,
Who the loud Tumults did withstand.
9.
For Ropes and Gibbets the next year,
The Whigs we hope) need not despair;
If Rich find TIMBER, (give them scope)
Brave North will never grudge them ROPE:
Then, to conclude, we'll crown the Bowl
With a Health to the K. and each Loyal Soul.
London's Joy and Triumph, on the Instalment of Sir William Pritchard L. Mayor
for the ensuing year.
Tune, Tangier March:
1.
LEt the Whigs revile,
The Tories Smile,
That their business is Completed,
Let all Rejoice
With Heart and Voice,
That the Whig's at last defeated.
The Whigs for Loyalty so Famed,
With all their Hopes are Undone;
Since now brave Pritchard is Proclaimed
The Loyal Mayor of London.
2.
You Polish Brace
Whose Brazen Face,
To the Chair would be Aspiring,
See the Rabble Crowd
Who Poll'd so Loud;
Are bawk'd beyond Admiring;
Learn in time to mitigate
Your bold Tumultuous Fury,
Er'e you shall find, you trust too late,
To Ignoramus Jury.
3.
Let Player Tom
Receive the Doom,
So long due for his Cheating,
Who did purloyn
The City Coin,
To keep up Holy Meeting;
To Rob the Orphan, and the Poor.
His great Discharge of Trust is,
And run upon the Widows Score,
To do the City Justice.
4.
Let Ward Repent,
And Jenks Relent,
Their Practice so malicious,
Let Hobland rue
With all the Crew,
That they were so Officious;
Such Jews as these, who did deny
Their Savior for a Tester,
No doubt again would Crucify
Their Sovereign Lord and Master.
5.
For North and Rich,
And every such,
They set up a Papillion;
Against Pritchard hold,
With Cornish, Gold,
With Riot and Rebellion:
To love the King can you pretend,
Who Royalists deny all;
And with such Vigor dare contend,
Against the Man that is Loyal.
6.
For shame in time
Repent your Crime
Your Riot and Commotion;
And to the Mayor,
Who kept the Chair,
Pay all your just Devotion;
Such was their Loyalty of late,
To give the King no Money:
But freely throw away their Plate,
To join with Rebel Tony.
7.
Thus you before
Did run on score
With Royal Charles your Master;
Like Drunk or mad
Spent all you had
To uphold a bold Imposture:
Let not Knaves again betray,
And rob you of your Reason,
Then leave your Factious Heads to pay
The forfeit of your Treason.
8.
With all your heat
What did you get?
With all your din and quarter;
But to involve
With each Resolve
The more entangled Charter?
To Charles your just Allegiance give,
Your Properties, then plead em,
Defending the Prerogative,
You best protect your Freedom.
Riot upon Riot; or a SONG upon the Arresting the Loyal Lord Mayor and Sheriffs.
Tune, Burton Hall.
1.
ROwze up Great Monarch
In the Royal Cause;
The Great Defender
Of our Faith and Laws:
Now, now, or never,
Crush the Serpent's Head,
Or else the Poison*
Through the Land will spread.
The Noble Mayor,
And his two Loyal Sherieves,
Bearing the Sword's, assaulted
By Usurping Thieves,
Who their Rebellious Ryots
Would maintain by Law:
Oh! London! London!
Where Is thy Justice now?
2.
Smite, smite, the Snakes
Did first their Sting reveal,
Stabbing thy Royal
Brother in the Heel;
And struck so many
Loyal Martyr's dead,
Now in the Sun
Flies boldly at the Head.
Slaves that resist
All Power but their own;
He that would usurp the Chair,
Would next usurp the Throne,
Who neither Royal Heir
Nor Loyal Mayors allow:
Oh! London! London!
Where Is thy Charter now?
3.
London, of Faction's
The eternal Spring,
Yet so much favored
By a Gracious King;
Who does such Deeds
That have no parallel,
Only to teach
Thy Children to Rebel.
This will record thee
In the Books of Fame;
This bold Attempt no Law,
Nor Precedent can claim:
Blood and the Crown, Papillion
And Dubois outdo:
Oh! London! London!
Where Is thy Charter now?
4.
Was this the way
Your Ryots to repair;
In spite o^th Charter,
To Arrest the Mayor?
And against the Sh'riffs
Your sham Actions bring,
'Cause justly chosen,
And approved by the King?
What call you this, but Treason?
Whilst the Fool
That did Arrest the Mayor
Expects himself to Rule;
And, save his own, no other
Power would allow:
Oh! London! London!
Where Is thy Charter now?
5.
Hang up the Factious Heads
That dare oppose
The Sword of Justice,
And the Ancient Laws:
Who in his Office
Dare Arrest the Mayor,
Disowns the Power
That placed Him in the Chair.
Tantara ra-ra!
Let the Trumpets sound,
Double all your Guards* and let
The Cent'nels stand their ground:
He that Arrests the Mayor,
Would bind the Monarch too:
Oh! London! London!
Where Is thy Charter now?
London's Lamentation for the loss of their Charter.
Tune, Packington's Pound.
1.
YOu Freemen, and Masters, and Prentices mourn,
For now You are left with your Charter forlorn:
Since London was London, I dare boldly say,
For your Ryots you never so dearly did pay;
In Westminster Hall
Your Dagon did fall,
That caused You to Riot and Mutiny all:
Oh London! Oh London! Thou Would better had none,
Than thus with thy Charter to vie with the Throne.
2.
Oh London! Oh London! how could Thou pretend
Against thy Defender Thy Crimes to defend?
Thy Freedoms and Rights from kind Princes did spring,
And yet in contempt thou withstandest Thy King:
With bold brazen Face
They pleaded Thy Case,
In hopes to the Charter the King would give place:
Oh London! Thou Would better no Charter at all,
Than thus for Rebellion thy Charter should fall.
3.
Since Britains to London came over to dwell,
You had an old Charter, to buy and to sell;
And whilst in Allegiance each honest man lives,
Then you had a Charter for Lord Mayor and Sheriffs:
But when, with Your Pride,
You began to backslide,
And London of Factions did run w'th' Tide*
Then London, Oh London! it is time to withdraw,
Lest the flood of Your Factions the Land overflow.
4.
When Faction and fury of Rebels prevailed;
When Cobblers were Kings, and Monarchs were jayl'd;
When Masters in Tumults their Prentices led,
And the Tail did begin to make war with the Head;
When Thomas and Kate
Did bring in their Plate,
T'uphold the Old Cause of the Rump of the State
Then tell me, Oh London! I prithee now tell,
Had thou ever a Charter to Fight and Rebel?
5.
When zealous Sham Sheriffs the City oppose,
In spite of the Charter, the King, and the ^aws,
And make such a Riot and Rout in the Town,
That never before such a Racket was known;
When Ryoters dare
Arrest the Lord May'r,
And force the King's Substitute out of the Chair
Oh London! whose Charter is now on the Lees,
Did Your Charter ever warrant such actions as these?
6.
Alas for the Brethren! what now must they do,
For choosing Whig-Sheriffs and Burgesses too?
The Charter with Patience is gone to the pot,
And the Doctor is lost in the depth of the Plot:
St. Stephen his Flayl
No more will prevail,
Nor Sir Robert's Dagger, the Charter to bail:
Oh London! Thou Would better have lain in the Fire,
Then thus thy old Charter should stick in the Mire.
7.
But since with your Folly, your Faction and Pride,
You sink with the Charter, who strove with the Tide,
Let all the lost Rivers return to the Main
From whence they descended; They Will spring out again;
Submit to the King
In every thing,
Then of a New Charter New Sonnets we'll sing:
As London, (the Phoenix of England,) never dies,
So out of the Flames a new Charter will rise.
The Wine-Coop^rs Delight,
Tune of The Delights of the Bottle.
THe Delights of the Bottle are turned out of doors,
By Factious Fanatical sons of damned Whores.
French Wines Prohibition, meant no other thing
But to Poison the Subject* and beggar the King.
Good Nature's suggested with Dregs like to choke her,
Of fulsom stum'd Wine by the cursed Wine- Cooper
Our plaguey Wine- Cooper has tampered so much,
To find out the subtilty of the false Dutch.
He tinctures pricked White- wine, that never was good,
Till it mantles, and sparkles and looks like Bulls blood:
But when it declines, and its Spirits expire,
He adds more Ingredients, and makes it look higher
His old rotten Pipes where he keeps all his Trash
For fear they should burst* Sir, he hoops them with Ash.
When the Sophistication begins for to froth,
And boils on the Fret, Sir, he wisely pulls forth
A Tap, which gives vent to the grounds of the Cause,
And then is to vamp up a second Red Nose.
Then this dingy Wine-Cooper stops it up again,
And keeps it unvented till it is all on a flame.
The Intelligences then were invented to show,
Where Wine of strange Virtues in plenty did flow.
People from all parts of the Nation did come,
Both Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, Doctor and Bum.
The Cooper then pulls the Tap out of his side,
And drinks to the Elders of all the good Tribe.
But when they had gus^'d about all the Bowls,
They found a strange freedom it gave to their Souls
Of secrets in Nature that never were known,
It gave Inspiration from Beggar to Throne.
For the Cooper himself full Brimmers did draw,
And all the whole Gang were obliged to do so.
Amongst these Gabals there was no such thing,
As a Health once proposed to the D. or the King.
But drank to that Idol of Hopes in their Powers.
And Sons of most Infamous Hackney old Whores.
Then the Rabble had notice from Smith and from Ben
What a Heavenly Liquor was sent amongst men.
Both Tinkers and Cobblers the Broom men and Sweep,
Before this Wine-Cooper in Flocks they did meet;
And each under-foot stamped his old greazy Bonnet
To drink M -- th's Health, Boys, whate'r come on it.
The Cooper preceiving his Trade to approach,
He then was resolved once more to debauch.
To encourage the Rabble, and show himself stout,
He pulled out the Spigot amongst the whole Rout
Which kindness provoked them to swear they would bring
Such a Trade to his House as would make him a King.
A Hat or a Bottle was still at the Tap;
But Zealots sometimes laid their Mouths to the Fat.
They charged their brisk Bumpers so many times round,
Till part of the Mobile sprawl'd on the ground:
But when this damned Liquor was get in their Pates,
They fell to Bumbasting, Disord'ring of States.
They began to cant Dangers by formal Sedition
And swear lawful Allegiance 'against lawful Succession.
When these Propositions began to take Fire,
They screwed their Presumptions a hole or two higher;
But still they keep under Hugh Peters's Cloak,
To bring in the Devil, to drive out the Pope.
But then they began for to pick at the Crown
Each thinking that he deserved one of his own.
Then all the Kings Guards they thought fit to Indict,
Swear Treason against all that maintain^d the King's Right.
Both Papists and Protestants no matter whether,
They are not of our party, let us hang 'em together,
Next the chief of our Game is to keep the King poor,
And our Senators must the Militia secure.
The Navy and Cinque Ports we'll have in our hands,
And then we'll make the Kingdom obey our Commands.
Then if Charles do withstand us, we need not to fight,
To make Eighty one to outdo Forty eight.
What ever Objections great Loyalists bring,
Old Adam lived happy without ever a King.
Then why may not we, that are much wiser than he,
Subdue the whole World, Sir, by our Sov'raignty:
If one man alone can keep three Nations under,
Then why may not We that are Kings without number?
Right, said the Cooper, and shak'd his old Noddle,
Three Kingdoms we'll toss, like a Child in a Cradle
Stick close to this Liquor which I do prepare,
'Twill make us as splendid as Noll in his Chair,
We'll kindle old Plots, by contriving of new,
Till none shall be safe but the Cooper and You.
O brave Boys! O brave Boys! the Rabble did rore.
Tantivies and Tories shall Hector no more;
By Us they are out-acted, to Us they shall bend,
Whilst we to our Dignities freely ascend,
Then they were dead-drunk as the Devil could make 'em.
And fell fast asleep, as ten Drums could not wake 'em.
In the Piss and the Spew the poor Cooper did paddle,
To stop up his Tap, but the Knave was not able.
For his Limbs like a Tortoise did shrivle and crease,
Down drops the Wine-Cooper with the other Beasts
And there the whole Litter as yet does abide,
At the Sign of the Butt, with the Tap in his side.
A Song upon the King Poland, and the Prince of the Land of Promise.
Tune, Hold fast thy Crown and Scepter, Charles
1. Prince.
O Poland Monster of our Isle,
Corruption of our Age;
Which on my Infant Hours did smile,
'Till thou inflam'dst the Rage
Of my Ambitious Soul, to sore
Above its defiled Sphere;
And, Icarus-like, I now must lower,
Transformed into Despair.
2.
Now all my Trophies of Success,
Are in Oblivion drowned;
And none for Me dare now Address,
Where I hop^d to be Crowned*
I by thy false blind Plots am shamed,
Fooled from a Glorious sway,
Snatched from a Father's Arms, and Damned,
Like all that Disobey
3.
Thou call'dst my nearest Friends at Court,
Soft, easy, abusurd Tools,
That Kings were but for Sates-Men's Sport,
The Council Knaves and Fools.
But I, poor I, find now too late,
Your Polish Grace can lie;
None proved more weak at the Foyls of State,
Than poor silly Tom, and I.
4.
Now, that Imperial Crown* which thou
For me so fit had made,
Is fallen and broke, I know not how,
And all our Wiles betray^d;
Our full Cabals, and Wapping-Treats,
Retrenched to secret Holes:
Treason the strength Our Greatness waits
In these rough reared Walls.
5 Poland.
Thou mighty Prince, by me Elect,
In The Land of Promise Sways*
Thy timorous Soul is the defect
Of our declining Days.
What brighter Prospect can propose,
To Magnify thy Name,
Than H^arts, and Arms, and Power of Those,
That Rule both Law and Fame.
6.
The Rustic Swains want not the Word,
No Magazines, nor Horse;
'Zwounds Sixty Thousand by the Sword,
Defy both Fate and Curse.
They Will lay three Kingdoms at our Feet,
In Blood and mangled Brains*
Then the Train-Bands, Cinque Ports, and Fleet,
At our Command remains.
7.
Though Rowley, and his Brother Joins,
And ^heel's around the Park;
Like two Yoak't Oxen, Tugs and Twines,
Against our Designs in the Dark,
And wisely weighs; Their Wits have wrought
Our Potent Parties Fall;
That Conquest must be dearer bought,
Else Tony Hangs for all.
7.
We have reserved Machines in store,
To raise more daring Flames,
Then Morrals 'ere Conspired before;
Or Damned Furies Frames.
If ever a Parliament be called,
Our Representatives there
Shall Scorn to be out-box'd, or bawled,
In Country, Town, or Shire.
9.
Then every Member of the Cause,
Amidst the Rabble Rude,
Who shall decide the Poll with blows,
And quash the Tory Crowd.
Then stick to Time, whilst Heads are hot,
Our Force together brings:
If this best PLOT, at last fail not,
By Christ, we'^l Both be Kings!
The Hunting of the Fox.
Tune, Now the Tories that Glories, etc.
HAy Jouler, Ringwood, and Towzer,
Ho Smoaker, Drunkard, and Fly;
Sweet-lips, Light-foot, and Bowzer;
Brave Bowman, Lofty, and Cry;
And four and twenty brave Couple,
To make a Pack for the Downs,
Sure footed, and your Limbs supple;
The Scent's hot yet on the Grounds.
The Old White Fox is got loose again;
We think he is gone to ketch Goose again:
His Cub^ they sculk and desert amain.
Come let^s beleaguer their Holes:
For they are past Evil; to the Devil
We'll send 'em with threadbare Souls.
2.
They have left the City, it is pity,
And their damned Party in the Lurch:
If to be Hanged, 'twould be pretty,
For Treason against King and Church.
For Cinque Ports, Venus and Juno;
For Champion, Thunder and Spark;
Let Swift beat for Caralino,
And Noser wind 'em in the dark.
Like Wasps and Flies, they would bite us;
As Wolves do Sheep, they would treat us;
Like Crockadiles, they would eat us;
They thirst for Innocent Blood:
Then never scruple, but graple
For King and Country's Good.
3.
Round the Dimension o the Nation,
Beat all the Banks on the Shore;
And some leap over the main Ocean,
If they are gone before.
O surround 'em, confound 'em,
From Seaport to City-Walls;
If there they venture to shelter,
'Zounds tear them out of their Holes:
For making Church into Stables,
And vamping Kings up of Baubles,
And forgoing Plots out of Fables,
And seizing Kings in a trice;
That the crooked Piper might vapor
Like Rat amongst Fifteen Mice.
4.
Scour the Globe to the Axels,
From Pole to Pole; then retire,
And center at Mother Creswels,
The Fox used to Harbor there:
There, there both Wives, Whores and Virgins,
He had them all at his Call,
T'oblige his Captains and Surgeons,
'Till better Occasions fall.
At Oxford late all his Cubs and He,
To the Exclusion did all agree;
Could not budge further, 'till signed and free.
Yet Rowley rouzed the Rump,
And sent 'em all to Peg Trantams;
And Tapsky's worn to the Stump.
5.
Oh, Swift's returned, and Noser,
Their Hoofs are battered with Greet:
The Game shows by the Opposer,
He Is lodged in Aldersgate Street.
Come ring a Peal with a Courage,
The Grains of the Tap makes a Train;
He lurks in Hole to make Forage
Of all that uses his Name.
We'll fetch him out with Mandamus,
And hang him with Ignoramus;
There Is none but Rebels can blame us:
More Pardons let him not hope;
For all his Squinting and Blinking,
He must to th'Hatchet or Rope.
Dagon's Fall.
Tune, Philander, etc.
1.
AH Cruel Bloody Fate!
What can thou now do more?
Alas! it is now too late
Poor Toney to restore:
Why should the flattering Fates persuade,
That Toney still should live,
In England here,
Or in Holland there,
Yet all our hopes deceive?
2.
A Noble Peer He was,
And of Notorious Fame;
But now He Is gone (alas!)
A Pilgrim over the Main:
The Prop and Pillar of our hope
The Patron of our cause,
The Scorn and Hate
Of Church and State,
The Urchin of the Laws.
3.
Of matchless Policy
Was this Renowned Peer,
The bane of Monarchy,
The Peoples Hope and Fear,
The Joy of all True Protestants,
The Tories Scorn and Dread;
But now He Is gone
Who cursed the Throne,
Alas! poor Toney's dead.
4.
For Commonwealth he stood,
Pretending Liberty;
And for the Public Good
Would pull down Monarchy:
The Church and State he would divorce,
The Holy Cause to wed:
And in time did hope
To confound the Pope,
To be himself the Head.
5.
A Tap in's side he bore,
To broach all sorts of Ill,
For which Seditious Store
The Crowd adored him still:
He spit his Venom through the Town,
With which the Saints possessed,
Would preach and prate
Against Church and State,
While He performed the rest.
6.
When any change of State
Or Mischief was at hand,
He had a working Pate,
And Devil at command:
He forg^d a Plot, for which the Heads
Of Faction gave their Votes;
But now the Plot
Is gone to pot,
What will become of Oats?
7.
Under the fair pretense
Of Right, Religion, Law,
Excluding the True Prince,
The Church would overthrow:
With such Religious Shams he brought
The Rabble on his side;
And, for his sport,
The Town and Court
In Parties would divide.
8.
Now what is become of all
His squinting Policy,
Which wrought your Dagon^s Fall,
From Justice forc^d to fly?
Old and Decrepid, full of pains*
As he of Guilt was full:
He fell to Fate,
And now (too late)
He leaves us to condole.
9.
Now, learn ye Whigs in time,
By his deserved fall,
To expiate his Crime,
E're Fate revenge you all;
For Rights, Religion, Liberty,
Are but the Sham-pretence
To Anarchy;
But Loyalty
Obeys the Lawful Prince:
Hue-and-Song after Patience Ward.
Tune, Hail to the Myrtle Shades.
1.
HAil to London fair Town,
All hail to the Mayor and the Shrieves;
Hail to the Scarlet Gown,
Whose Sentence our Patience grieves:
Justice and Law has prevailed,
With Patience a Verdict to find,
Against Patience, whose Conscience failed;
Oh Patience! why art so blind?
2.
Patience, the joy of the Town,
The comfort and hope of the Crowd;
Patience, who got renown,
By Perjury, Lies and Fraud:
Patience who never had the Heart
His Sovereign's Rights to maintain;
But Patience he had the Art
To Swear and Forswear again.
3.
Patience for Church and for State,
And Patience for Meetings by stealth;
Patience, who would translate
The State to a Commonwealth:
Whose Zeal has his Patience betrayed,
To lie for the Saints in distress;
Nay, though he^s Forsworn, ('it is said,)
He Swore he could do no less.
4.
Patience, whose Zeal did contrive
The Monument Figures and Spire,
That while there is a Papist alive
We may not forget the Fire:
The Pillory now is his Lot,
He has rais^d such a flame with his Crew,
That London is now too hot;
Oh Patience! where art thou now?
5.
Patience for Zeal to the Cause,
Did preach to the Captives in Goal*
Patience, with great applause,
Gave large to an Hospital:
To Use now his Money may lend,
For Pomfret he will never more stand,
Nor Warrants for Thompson send,
T'please Titus of the Perjured Band.
6.
Patience with Collar of Brass,
To woeful Disasters did fall;
Patience with Copper Face,
And a Conscience worse than all;
To Holland, to Holland he goes;
For plainly now it appears,
That (in spite of all Whiggish Laws,)
Ignoramus cannot save his Ears.
7.
Some say that the Saints may not Swear,
But Lie even as much as they can;
Yet Patience in spite on's Ears,
Will Swear and Forswear again:
That Patience should be so far lost,
Alas! who with Patience can hear?
That a Saint should be Knight of the Post,
And an Elder without an Ear.
8.
Let every good Subject with Me,
Who Patience a Virtue does praise,
Lest he fall into Perjury,
With Patience pray for Grace.
But now I with Patience have done,
Lest with Patience I keep such a Rout,
That astray more with Patience run,
And weary your Patience out.
A new SONG on the Arrival of Prince George, and his Intermarriage with the
Lady Anne.
Tune, Old Jemmy.
1.
PRince George at last is come,
Fill every man his Bumper;
For the Valiant Dane make room,
Confusion to each Rumper,
And every prodigal starched Fool
Aspires unto a Crown,
By hopes of Plotting Knaves to Rule,
Who next would pull Him down.
2.
Preserve Great Charles our King,
And His Illustrious Brother
Whilst Whigs in Halters swing,
And hang up one another:
The joyful Bridegroom and the Bride,
Prince George of Royal Race,
Of all the Swains the Joy and Pride,
The subject of their ^ays.
3.
Brave George He is a Lad
With all Perfections shining;
With every Virtue clad,
And every Grace refining:
But oh! of such a warlike Race,
So Conquering are his Charms,
No Mars in Field, but must give place
To His Victorious Arms.
4.
Brave George, Great Denmark's Son,
(A stout and warlike Nation)
By Birth to England's Crown
A near and dear Relation;
But now the Knot is doubly tied,
Which makes him still more near,
The Knot which Knaves would have destroyed,
By cutting off the Heir.
5.
But now the Tribe's dispersed,
Their Projects are defeated,
Which Walcot and the rest
Did hope to have completed:
And now they will pay for all their scores,
Who for that Interest stood,
And let 'em hang for Sons of Whores,
Who thirst for Royal Blood.
6
Poor Perkin! where is the hope
Of all thy high promoting?
Now, Bully Tom, a Rope
Must crown thy Cheats and Plotting:
Let Ferguson with Gray escape,
They safe are ev'ry-where,
If Murder, Treason, Lust and Rape
Can pass unpunished here.
7.
Let M -- for a Crown,
That hopeful Prince so Loyal,
Away with Rebels run,
To raise an Army-Royal:
Brave George for England scorns to fly,
Old Jemmy stout as He,
Their Plots and Malice we defy,
And all their Treachery.
8.
May Heaven, which him did raise
Of The Protestant Profession,
In His Immortal Race
Maintain the just Succession,
That no pretending Bastard bold
In time to come may dare
His lawless Title to uphold,
Against the lawful Heir.
A new Song made by a Person of Quality, and sung before His Majesty at
Winchester
Tune, Cook Laurel.
1.
A Tory came late through Westminster Hall,
And as he past by heard a Citizen bawl;
The Judges are Perjured, and we are undone,
Our Liberty's lost, and our Charter is gone.
2.
This comes of our Prating since College is dead;
This comes of our Plotting without ^ony's Head:
For he had more wit in his Treason by half,
As he hook^d himself on, he crook'd himself off.
3.
He scarce had said this when a Baron approac'd
That ruined two Sisters, the younger debauched:
The Reasons he cried, I Am loath to describe,
He would have a Maidenhead out of the Tribe.
4.
The next came a Peer, and a Knight of great Fame,
One Famous for Stabbing, the other was Lame;
O Heavens! in what a strange Age do we dwell,
When Bully's Reform, and Cripples Rebel.
5.
With them the sweet Speaker, Wi. W -- s I saw,
His Head full of Projects, but empty of Law;
For he it is observed has been dull as a Dog
Since Pe -- n batoon'd him for calling him R^
6.
Peart Wa -- op and Win -- on, Mutinies breed,
Yet still in the Cause, for no purpose are Fee'd*
For Cradeck will offer himself for a Drudge;
If either of them will be fit for a Judge.
7.
Old Ma -- rd, all ages in Faction was chief;
Now Mumbles by rote, never looks in his Brief:
But rotten Rebellion will never last long,
He spit out his Teeth, and will cough out his Tongue.
8.
Now by the Re -- er new Cards must be played,
That Body of Law with a Sarazens-Head,
That (Span^el-like) fawns on the King to his face
And yet makes the Whigs just amends for his place.
9.
For Magistrate Patience, I plainly confess,
I Have little to say, because he is in Distress;
But he that sat once in the Cities great Chair,
Would a Pillory grace; so I wish he were there.
10.
Dubois and Papillion, the Cities sham Shrieves,
Whose Truth and whose Loyalty no man believes;
That Arrested the Mayor and no danger forsaw,
To keep from self-hanging I leave to the Law.
11.
For Law they complained, of the Lawyers they boast,
They Are pleas^d, till by Law they their Ch* had lost:
Law, Law, was the cry of the Mutinous Crew,
The Devil's in it if they ha'nt Law enough now.
12.
Scribe Cl -- n's Wife decked with the spoils of the poor,
Embroider^d in Scarlet like Babylon's Whore;
But let me advise him to strip off her Red,
And make her a Peticoat of her Green-Bed.
13.
Old Pl -- yer grown rampant, late picked up a Whore
And swore he would recant, and be Whiggish no more;
By Tories made Drunk in the Company's view.
The Saint kissed her C -- t, and drank healths in her Shoe.
14
Now listen ye Whigs, and hear what I speak,
A Monarch (like Heaven can give and can take;
But you for Rebellion no Reason can bring,
So hang your selves all; and God save the King.
The New Market SONG
Tune, Old Simon the King.
1.
THe Golden Age is come,
The Winter-storms are gone,
The Flowers spread, and Bloom,
And smile to see the Sun;
Who daily gilds each Grove,
And calms the Air and Seas,
Dame Nature seems in Love,
And all the World's at ease:
You Rogue so saddle Ball,
I^ll to New market scour*
You never mind when I call,
I should have been there this hour;
For there is all Sporting and Game,
Without any ^lotting of State;
From Whigs, and another such Sham,
Deliver us, deliver us, O Fate!
Let Us be to each other a ^rey,
To be chea^ed be every ones Lot;
Or choused any sort of a way,
But by another Damned Plot.
Let Cullies that lose at the Race
Go venture at Hazard, and win;
And he that is bubbl'd at Dice,
Recover't at Cocking again:
Let Jades that are foundered be bought,
Let Jockeys play Crimp to make sport;
For 'faith it was strange, methought,
to see Vintner beat the Court.
2.
Each corner of the Town
Rings with perpetual noise,
The Oyster bawling Clown
Joins with hot Pudding-pies;
And both in Consort keep,
To vend their stinking Ware,
The drowzy God of Sleep
Has no Dominion there.
Hey boys! the Jockeys roar.
If the Mare and the Gelding run,
I Will hold you Five Guineys to Four
He beats her, and gives half a stone.
God d -- me, quoth Bully, it is done,
Or else I Am a Son of a Whore;
And fain would I meet with the man
Would offer it, would offer it once more.
See, see the damned Fa^e of the Town!
A Fop that was starving of late,
And scarcely could borrow a Crown,
Puts in to run for the Plate,
Another makes chousing a Trade,
And dreams of his Projects to come,
And many a Crimp match has made,
By bribing another man's Groom.
The Townsmen are Whiggish, God rot 'em,
Their hearts are but Loyal by fits;
For, should you search to the bottom,
They Are as nasty as their Streets.
3.
But now all hearts beware;
See, see on yonder Downs?
Beauty now tryumphs there,
And at this distance wounds:
In the Amazonian Wars
Thus all the Virgins shone,
And, like the glittering Stars,
Paid homage to the Moon.
Love proves a Tyrant now,
And there does proudly dwell;
For each stubborn heart must bow,
He has found a new way to kill:
For never was invented before
Such Charms of additional Grace
Nor has Divine Beauty such Power
In every, in every fair Face.
Ods bud, cries my Countryman John,
Was ever the like before seen?
By Hats and by Feathers they ve on,
Ise took 'em e^n all for men:
Embroidered and fine as the Sun,
Their Horses and Trappings of Gold;
Such a sight I shall never see again,
If I live to a hundred years old.
This, this is the Countries discourse
All wondering at this rare sight:
Then Roger go saddle my Hor^e,
For I will be there to night.
A New Song on the Fan. Plot,
Tune Hey Boys up go We
NOw, now the Plot is all come out,
That caused our Doubts and Fears,
And all the Tribe that made the Rout,
Both Commoners and Peers;
The mighty Patrns of the Cause,
Against Pagan Popery,
Who raised a Gibbet for our Foes,
And hey Boys up go we.
2.
With Sanctified Religious Zeal
The Brethren did agree
To raise our Ancient Commonweal
On Christian Liberty:
To undermine the Church and State,
And blow up Monarchy;
But now, alas! it is our own Fate,
And hey Boys up go We.
3.
A Holy Covenant we took,
To Sacrifice the King,
And next to him the Royal Duke,
A Bloody Offering;
For which, according to the Vote,
The Papists all should die;
But now the Saints have changed their note,
And hey Boys up go we.
Our Zealous Covenanting Saints,
Associating Peers,
Each Heart for fear with Patience pants,
To lose more than his Fars;
Toney's dead, and M -- s fled,
The Helm is turned a Lee
The Plot (the Nail) is knocked of the head,
And hey then up go we.
No longer may the Papists boast
Their Bloody black Designs;
Old Rome thy Ancient Glory's lost,
For all thy Learned Divines:
For Royal Murders, Treasons base,
And marchless Trachery,
The Jesuits must now give place,
And hey Boys up go we.
6.
How well did we contrive the Plot,
And laid it at their Door,
For which old Stafford went to pot,
And many guiltless more;
But now the Tide is come about,
The Truth of all we see;
And when the Murder all is out,
Then hey Boys up go We.
7.
Rumsey's Gold, and Rumbold bold,
Conspire to kill the King,
And Pickering in fatal hold,
Must answer for the thing;
^elthor^, West, and all the rest,
With Perkin may agree,
To be of the Tower not Throne possessed;
Then hey Boys up go we.
8.
Our City Ryots and Country Routs,
That to Rebellion tend,
Our Races, and our Hunting-bouts,
In Insurrections end;
The Rebel now is caught in the Snare
^e laid for Monarchy;
At last the Gallows claims its share,
Then hey Goys up go we.
The Conspiracy; or, the discovery of the Fanatic Plot.
Tune, Let Oliver now be forgotten, etc.
1.
LEt Pickering now be forgotten,
Old Rumbold has wiped off his scores;
Since Presbyter Jack went a Plotting,
The Jesuits turned out of Doors:
For Brewing, swilling of Treason,
King-killing without reason,
Of all the Pack,
Noble or Peasant,
None can exceed old Presbyter Jack.
2.
First, the hot Sectaries Voted,
'Twas Treason to Murder the King*
And next the bold Regicides Plotted
To compass the very same Thing:
Their Votes and Arbitrary Power,
That sent the Lords to the Tower,
We now see plain,
Every hour,
They Would the old Game play over again.
3.
Rumsey and Rumbold indented
At Hodsdon their Ambush to bring;
But Heaven and the Fire prevented,
And Providence guarded the King:
The Whigs the Treason propounded;
But when the Trumpet sounded
For Cambridgeshire,
All were confounded,
Taken or fled both Peasant and Peer.
4
M^nmo^th for Wit, who was able
To make to a Crown a pretense,
The Head and the Hope of the Rabble,
A ^oyal and Politic Prince:
But now He Is gone into Holland,
To be a King of no-Land,
Or else must be
Monarch of Poland,
Was ever Son so Loyal as He?
5.
Lord Gray, and Armstrong the Bully,
That Prudent and Politic Knight,
Who made of His Grace such a Cully,
Together have taken their flight:
Is this your Races, Horse-matches,
His Grace's swift Dispatches
From Shire to Shire?
Under the Hatches,
Now above-Deck you dare not appear.
6.
Brave Russel and Sidney the Bully,
That stood for the holy Old Cause;
And Trenchard drawn in for a Cully,
In spite of Allegiance and Laws;
And Wildman too, with his Cannon,
With Walcot, Smith and Aaron,
With Mead and Bourn,
Every Man, on
To Tyburn goes the next in his Turn.
7.
Next Valiant and Noble Lord H -- d
That formerly dealt in Lambs-wool,
And knows what it is to be Tower^d,
By Impeaching may fill the Jayl^ full:
And next to him Cully Brandon
The Wit; and famous Hambden
Must take his place,
Who did abandon
All Loyalty, Religion and Grace.
8.
Hone* and Rowse, the King and His Brother
That they were to kill 'em confessed,
And now they hang up one another,
Holms, Blaney, Lee, Walcot and West:
May all such Traitors discarded,
To Tyburn be well guarded,
And every thing
Be so rewarded,
That would oppose so Gracious a King.
RVSSEL's Farewell Tune, Oh, the merry Christ-Church Bells, etc.
OH, the mighty Innocence
Of Russel, Bedford's Son!
That died for the Plot,
Whether Guilty, or not,
By his last (Equivocating) Speech!
By the words of a dying man,
I here protest I know no Plot
Against the Life of the King, or Government,
Either by Action, or Intent.
Fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, my Lord,
What are you about to do?
To sink to Hell
By the sound of your Knell,
Both Soul and Body too.
Oh, the shallow memory
Of this blood-thirsty Lord!
T'deny and confess,
And all to express
His guilty Insolence the more:
I at Mr. Shepherd's house
Did hear some little slight discourse,
How easy 'twas the Guards to seize;
Yet I am guiltless, if you please;
No, no, no, no, no, no, my Lord,
Your Guilt's too plainly seen,
And M -- th too,
With Shaftsbury's Crew,
To destroy both King and Queen
3
Next your Lordship does protest,
No man had ever yet
That Impudence
Against his Prince,
To your face to propose any foul Design:
Then you confess immediately,
At the House of Politic Shaftsbury
You heard such words
Were sharp as Swords,
The worst can be thought or English affords;
Which raised your Righteous Spirit to
Exclaim against their sense;
Yet this you concealed,
And never revealed,
Till in your blind Defense.
4.
Po^ery (your Lordship says)
Is Bloody and unjust;
What then) you designed
With those you combined,
Was farce, to jest our Lives away;
For when the Duke of Monmouth came
T'acquaint your Honor of his Fear
Of being undone by the heat of some,
Too violent for the bloody Cause,
Away you go to Shepherd^s strait,
Where pernicious words were said,
In Passion all,
With Judgment small,
But consequence of Dread.
5.
From the time of choosing Sheriffs,
I did conclude the heat
Would this produce;
That Is no excuse,
But just Confession of the Fact.
Presently your Lordship says,
For farther Confirmation still,
You are not surpriz^d to find it fall
On your Honor you deserved it all:
Immediately you would proclaim
Aloud your Innocence
Why your Lordship's mad,
In a Cause so bad,
To put that Sham-pretence.
6.
O ye True blew Protestants,
Whose times are yet to come,
You see your Fate;
Early or late
Follow you must, it is all your Doom.
M^th, Armstrong, Ferguson,
Gray, Goodenough the Under-Shrieve,
With all your Ignoramus Crew,
That Justice hate, and Treason brew;
Scaffold, Tyburn, Halter, Ax,
Those Instruments of Death,
As it is your due,
May't you pursue,
Till you resign your Breath.

Monarchy Tryumphant; or, the fatal fall of Rebels.
Tune, The King enjoys His own again.
WHigs are now such precious things,
We see there is not one to be found;
All roar, God bless and save the King,
And the Health goes briskly all day round:
To the Soldier Cap in hand
The sneaking Rascals stand,
And would put in for honest men;
But the King He well knows
His Friends from His Foes,
And now He enjoys His own again.
2.
From this Plots first taking air,
Like Lightning all the Whigs have run;
Nay, they have left their topping Square,
To march off with our eldest Son*
They Have left their States and Wives,
To save their precious Lives,
But who can blame their flying? when
'Twas plain to 'em all,
The great and the small,
That the King would have His own again.
3.
Since the King was thereabouts,
They all well knew their Heads were His;
So by help of such like scouts
The Great Ones have yet escaped His Phys.
His stern and Kingly look
There Is few of them can brook,
Since fairly tried, they know that then
The Hemp or sharp Steel
They must all expect to feel,
Since the King enjoys His own again.
4.
This may chance a warning be,
(If e're the Saints will warning take)
To leave off hatching Villainy,
Since they have seen their Brethren at the stake,
And more must mounted be,
(Which God grant we may see)
Since Juries now are honest men;
And the King lets 'em swing
With a hey ding, ding, ding, ding,
Great Charles enjoys His own again.
5.
Once they voted, That His Guards
A Nuisance was, which now They find;
Since they stand betwixt the King
And the Treason that such Dogs designed:
It Is They will you maul,
Though it cost 'em a fall,
In spite of your most mighty Men;
For now they are alarmed,
And all Loyallists well armed*
Since the King enjoys His own again.
6.
To the King some Bumpers round,
Let Us drink* my Lads, whilst Life does last;
He that at the Core's not found,
Shall be kicked out without a taste:
Since we are case-harden'd honest men,
Which makes their Crew mad,
But us Loyal hearts full glad,
That the King enjoys His own again.
The Plot and Plotters confounded; or, the downfall of Whiggism.
Tune, Ah Jenny! it is your Eyn do kill.
1.
THe Plot (God wot)
Is now broke out,
Confound those brought it in;
Let them be Damned,
(Besides being shamed,)
Of their King-killing sin;
Down, down with their General
Council and Colonel,
Joyner and Cobbler of State,
Their Members of Parliament
Of the new Rump,
Let all Repent too late.
2.
Oh now you Whigs
Led up this Jig,
What is it you will lead up next?
Why says I hear
To Tyburn you gang,
For being beside your Text*
To Tyburn the Highborn,
As well as the Cobbler,
Concerned in Plot so dire,
Must Hickle-te Pickle-te
Swing on a Row;
Pray God I am no Liar.
3.
Did ever Fools
Set up such Tools
That durst not stand the sho^k
Of being made,
Or being marred?
A pox on such Bully-Rocks!
Fie, fie, fie, fie,
Fie, fie for shame,
Such Heroes run the pit,
It shows, God knows,
Their fear of blow^,
And eke their want of wit.
4.
The King God bless,
The Queen no less,
The Duke and Duchess too;
The Lady Anne,
with Her good Man,
And all the Royal Crew:
Let those that love
The King be blessed,
And those that hate Him cursed;
Let Tories swim
In Claret, and
The Whigs be choakt with thirst.

And take the self same Oath,

'Cause stay they dare not here,

But You Will have Justice done,
To evr'y mothers Son,
And be Hanged one by one.

7.
Now how like Fools we look,
O hone, O hone.
Had we not better took

And have kept in our Hives,
Which might have saved our Lives,
O hone, O hone.
8.
The King He says, that all
O hone, O hone.
That are found Guilty, shall

Die by the Ax or Rope,
As they died for the Pope;
Brethren there is no Hope.
O hone, O hone.
9.
The Sisters left behind,
O hone, O hone.
Must with Vile Tories Grind,
O hone, O hone.
And still be at their Call,
To play at Up-tails-all;
Nay, to be Poxt and all.
O hone, O hone.
10.
The Tories now will Drink,
O hone, O hone.
The Kings Health with our Chink,
O hone, O hone.
Queen, Duke and Duchess too,
And all the Loyal Crew.
Jerney Morblew, Morblew.
O hone, O hone.
The Whigs Droun'd in an Honest Tory Health.
To a pleusant Tune.
1.
WEalth breeds Care; Love, Hope and Fear;
What does Love or Business here,
While Bacchus's Navy does appear?
Fight on, and fear not sinking:
Fill it briskly to the Brim,
Till the flying Topsails swim,
We owe the first Discovery to Him
Of this great World of Drinking
2.
Grave Cabals, who States Refine,
Mingle their Debates with Wine;
Caeres and the God of the Vine
Make every great Commander:
Let sober Sots small Beer subdue,
The Wise and Valiant Wine do woe;
The Staggarite had the Honor too
To be Drunk with Alexander.
3.
Stand to your Arms! and now advance*
A health to the English King of France,
And to the next of Boon Esprance
By Bacchus and Apollo:
Thus in State I lead the Van;
Fall in your place by the Right-hand-man!
Beat Drum! march on! dub a dub, ran dan!
He Is a Whig that will not follow.
4.
Face about to the Right again,
Britains Admiral of the Main,
York, and His Illustrious Train
Crown the days Conclusion:
But a Halter stop his Throat
Who brought in the foremost Vote,
And of all that did promote
The Mystery of Exclusion.
5.
Next to Denmark's Warlike Prince*
Let the following Health commence;
To the Nymph whose Influence
Brought the Hero hither:
May their Race the Tribe annoy,
Who the Grandsire would destroy,
And get every year a Boy
Whilst they are together.
6.
To the Royal Family
Let us close in Bumpers three;
May the Ax and ^alter be
The Pledge of every Roundhead:
To all Loyal Hearts pursue,
Who to the Monarch dare prove true;
But for Him they call ^rue blew,
Let him be confounded.
An excellent new Song on the late Victories over the Turks.
To a very Pleasant New Tune.
1.
HArk! the thundering Canons roar,
ecchoing from the German shore,
And the joyful News comes o'^*
The Turks are all confounded;
Lorrain comes, they run, they run;
Charge your Horse through the grand half moon
We Will quarter give to none,
Since Staremberg is wounded.
2.
Close your Ranks, and each brave Soul
Take a lusty flowing Bowl,
A grand Carouse to the Royal ^^le,
The Empires brave Defender;
No man leave his Post by stealth,
Plunder the Grand Visiens Wealth,
But drink a Helmet full to the Health*
Of the second Alexander.
3.
Mahomet was a sober Dog,
A small Beer drouzy senseless rogue,
The Juice of the Grape so much in vogue
To forbid to those Adore him;
Had he but allowed the Vine,
Given'em leave to carouze in Wine
The Turk had safely past the Rhine,
And conquered all before him.
4.
With dull Tea they sought in vain,
Hopeless Victory to obtain,
Where sprighty Wine fills every Vein;
Success must needs attend him;
Our Brains, (like our Canons) warm
With often Firing, feels no harm,
While the sober sot flies the Alarm,
No Laurel can befriend him.
5.
Christians thus with Conquests Crowned,
Conquest with the Glass goes round,
Weak Coffee cannot keep its ground,
Against the force of Claret:
Whilst we give them thus the Foyl,
And the Pagan Troops Recoyl,
The Valiant Poles divide the Spoil,
And in brisk Nectar share it.
6.
Infidels are now overcome,
But the most Christian Turks at home
Watching the Fate of Christendom,
But all his hopes are shallow;
Since the Poles have led the Dance,
Let English Caesar now advance,
And if he sends a Fleet to France,
He Is a Whig that will not follow.
Tangiers Lamentation on the Demolishing and Blowing up of the Town, Castle and
Citadel*
Tune, Tangier March.
1.
LEt the Moors repine,
Their hopes resign,
Now the Pagan Troops are cheated*
Let Foot and Horse
Disband their Force,
Since Tangier is defeated:
Alas Tangier! what sudden Doom
Has wrought this alteration,
That thus thy March should now become
Thy fatal Lamentation?
2.
Now, alas Tangier!
That cost so dear
In Money, Lives, and Fortunes,
See how the States,
The kinder Fates,
For thy own Fate importunes:
Had this been plotted by the Moors,
Alas! it were no matter;
But blown up thus by thy own Store,
Thou^dst better swem in Water.
3.
The old Port, Tangier,
Where for good Cheer
We never paid Extortion;
Which, whilst it stood,
War once thought good
To be a Monarchs Portion.
Whilst English Hearts Thy Walls possessed,
They scorned ever to surrender,
Now to the Foe is left a Nest
For Serpents to engender.
4.
Alas! what now
Must the Seamen do,
When they come ashore to Lord it,
For a little Fresh Store,
And a little Fresh Whore?
Which Tangier still afforded*
No Ambuscade of Treacherous Moor,
Nor shall Ben Otter's Highness
Court any more the British Shore,
To try the Ladies kindness.
5.
It would grieve your heart,
Should I impart
The Gold and precious Matter
That lies oppressed
In every Chest
Drowned underneath the Water;
But now the Mold that forced the Main,
The Mold so gay and bonny,
Is with the Chests blown up again*
But never a Cross of Money.
6.
Of how many Souls,
And large Punch-bowls,
Has this been the undoing?
How many Tun
Of precious Coin
Lie buried in the Ruin?
Had this been done some years ago,
Of Horsemen and Postillions,
'T had saved some thou and Lives the blow,
And saved besides some Millions.
7.
When the Pile took fire
Above the Spire,
I wish (for the good of the Nation)
The Walls well crammed,
With Rebels ramm'd
Of the ^ssociation:
All Bethells of a Commonwealth,
Each sullen Whig and Trimmer,
That boggle at a Loyal Health,
Yet will not bawk a Brimmer.
8.
Now Heaven preserve
(While Rebels starve)
The King and's Royal Brother,
While Traitors fly,
And others die,
Impeaching one another:
That Gracious Prince that values more
His Subjects Lives and Pleasure,
Than all the Wealth of Africks shore,
And Tangiers buried Treasure.
The History of Whiggism, From their Rise, to their late horrid and
unparalled Conspiracy.
Tune, When the Stormy Winds do Blow.
1.
YOu Calvinists of England,
Who surfeit with your Ease,
And strive to make us Whigland,
To breed a foul Disease:
Hearken you painted Saints,
For we will let you know,
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
The first of your pretensions
When that you did begin,
Were gloss'd with good Intentions,
But false at Heart within:
No Faith in you was ever found,
That Truth we plainly know,
Oh the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow.
Queen Elizabeth she did descry,
And soon found what you were;
She made fit Laws against you
By Parliament appear;
Which late you would have Repealed,
But just Charles too well did know,
All the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
Such Locusts in the Nation
King James could never love;
Wherefore he thought discretion
T'advise his Son t'disprove
Of all your false pretended Zeal;
For wisely he did know,
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
When best of Kings and Princes
Did give your hearts desire,
Yet you were not contented,
To the Crown you did aspire;
You said, you would make him Great,
Indeed you did do so;
But oh, the Cares and the Fears
Attends such Winds that blow!
On the Mitre you did trample
To make your selves more high,
With greater force to give the stroke
Against His Majesty:
Ah! false and traiterous Tekelites,
Such ways to let us know
The great Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
The Whig he then stood rampant,
To us he gave his Laws;
Yet such he dare not vaunt on it,
So sharp we felt his Claws:
YOu then laid open what you were,
And smartly made us know
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
The Blessed Martyrs Royal Son,
Whom Heaven guarded sure,
And made us happy by's Return,
Him you could not endure:
Against His Life you did conspire,
And Mighty James also;
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
Peace, Plenty, and all that is good,
Through His Conduct we have:
Ungrateful Souls! to seek his Blood*
Who seeks us for to save;
And by your late Rebellious ways
Again to make us know,
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
With furious Zeal you do inflame,
And cause our Countries burn:
You work Confusion, but the blame
On Innocents you turn*
Your holy Masque is dropping off,
God grant it may do so,
And stop the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow.
May College, Rouse, and Hone, their Fate
On Traitors all attend:
What though i^ seems a little late?
Yet still we know your end.
^ust Vengeance does not sleep,
Though you do think it so;
You Will have your shares of the Cares
That by you Whigs do grow.
Long live great Charles our pious King
Who cares when we do sleep,
To keep still safe under his Wing
From Ravenous Wolves his Sheep:
He us preserves from Bears Clutch*
The Lions Jaw also,
And from all Cares and all Fears
That by you Whigs do grow
The Whigs* hard Heart the cause of the hard Frost.
Tune, Oh London! Thou Had better have built new Bordello's, etc.
1.
YE Whigs and Dissenters, I charge you attend,
Here is a sad story, as ever was told:
The River of Thames, that once was your Friend,
Is frozen quite over with Ice very cold;
And Fish which abounded,
Though they cannot be drownded,
For lack of their Liquor, I fear are confounded
Then leave your Rebellious and damned Presbytering,
Or you may be glad of Poor-Jack and Red-herring.
2.
Now, had it been frozen with Brimstone and Fire,
The wonder had been much deeper at bottom;
Though some do believe your Sins do require
A Punishment great as ever fell upon Sodom:
But then the poor Fish
Had been dressed to your Dish,
And, stead of a Plague, you had then had your wish;
Pikes, Flounders, together with Gudgeons and Roaches,
Had served for the Luxury of these Debauche^s.
3.
But, alas! to instruct ye this Frost now is sent,
As if it would show ye your Consciences hardened;
And if each Mothers-child make not have to repent,
How the Devil do you think ye shall ever be pardoned
It Is a very sad Case,
As ever yet was,
That the River should suffer for every Ass!
Poor Thames! thou may curse the foul Lake of Geneva,
For whose faults Thou do penance, sans hope of Reprieve-a.
4.
This Thames, (O ye Whigs!) brought ye Plenty and Pride,
So ye hardened your hearts with your Silver and Gold
But if ever ye hope to redeem Time or Tide,
^ot must your Repentance, your Zeal must be cold;
Your damned hungry Zeal
For rank Commonweal
Will hurry ye headlong all down to the Deel;
Then melt your hard hearts, and your tears spread abroad.
As ever ye hope that your Thames shall be Thawed.
5.
Make have, and be soon reconciled to the Truth,
Or you may lament it, both old men and young;
For, suppose every Shop should be turned to a Booth
Oh, were it not sad to be told with a tongue!
Should Cheapside advance
Up to Pety-France,
And Londons Guild Hall up to Westminster dance;
O, what would become of your wealthy brave Chamber,
If it were forced so far Westward to clamber?
6.
C^ck shops with roast Victuals, and Taverns with Wine,
Already are seen on the River with plenty,
which are filled every morning before ye can dine,
By Two's and by Three's, I may truly say Twenty;
Jack, Tom, Will, and Hary.
Nan, Sue, Doll, and Mary,
Come there to devour Plum-Cakes and Canary:
And if with their Dancing and Wine they be tired,
For a Tester a piece there is a Coach to be hired.
7.
There Is Ginger-bread, Small-Cole, and hot Pudding-pies,
With Bread and Cheese, Brandy and good Ale and Beer:
Besides the Plum-Cakes too, there is large Cakes of Ice,
Enough to invite him that will come here;
All which does betide
To punish your Pride;
You Are plagued now with Ice, 'cause you love to back- slide:
Methinks if should warn you to alter your station.
For you have hitherto built on a slippery Foundation.
8.
Ye Merchants to Greenland, now leave off your sailing,
And for your Tr^in-Oyl you^selves never solicit;
For there is no fear of your Merchandise failing,
Since the Whales, I^m afraid, mean to give us a visit:
The great Leviathan
May sail to England,
To see a worse Monster the Presbyterian.
Was ever a Vengeance so wonderful shown,
That a River so great should be turned to a Town?
The Swearers Chorus to the Presbyterian Plot.
Tune, The merry Beggars, etc.
1.
THere was a Monstrous Doctor;
This Doctor had no Peer,
A Rogue from his Cradle
And bred to Lie and Swear;
And a Swearing we will go, will go, will go,
And a Swearing we will go.
2.
A Bag for my Pilgrims*
Another for Black Bills,
Ten thousand blank Commissions
To move as many Hills:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
3.
A Bag for my Sallery,
From every Fool suborns,
Three brawny Bums to follow me,
And bugger them by turns:
And a Bugg ring we will go, etc.
4.
A Bag for my Plunder,
Sir William's on the scent;
The Pole did n^er so thunder
In the Grand Vizier's Tent:
And a Pundring we will go, etc.
5.
A Bag for my Necklace,
Another for my Plate;
And all shall be Fish
That comes in Waller's Net;
And a Plund'ring we will go, etc.
6.
A Bag for my Pistols*
And Consecrated Knives,
And one for Tormentillio's,
T'fright Fools out of their Lives:
And a Plotting we will go, etc.
7.
A Bag for the Parson,
Another for Don John;
Though I swore like a Whoreson,
Yet still I did swear on:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
8.
Through four and twenty Key-holes
I sallied like a Witch,
And through as many Brick-walls
I Will swear I went through-stitch:
And a Swearing I did go, etc.
9.
To Lambeth we will go,
Where we first made the Plot;
While Prance and I can swear and lie,
They all shall go to pot:
And a Plotting we will go, etc.
10.
Then we will to Godfrey go,
And find Him killed of the spot,
And swear the Papists did it,
To make a Popish-Plot:
And a Murdering we will go, etc.
11.
A Gown I have for show
Amongst the Clergy grave,
And, when I please, a Cloak
To hide the double Knave:
And a Plotting we will go, etc.
12.
I had a pretty knack,
To Wheedle, Swear and Lie,
By the Rebellious Rabble
How much admired was I!
And a Swearing we will go etc.
13.
In fair London Town
I live, and pay no Rent;
The Brethren they provide for me,
And I am well content:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
14.
Of all Occupations
The Swearer is most blessed;
For when he swears most falsely,
He Is always paid the best:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
15.
I fear no Plot against me,
Although the Whigs rebel;
Then who would be honest,
Since such Rogues fare so well?
And a Plotting we will go, will go, will go;
And a Plotting we will go.
A New SONG.
Tune, I Will tell thee, Dick, etc.
CHil tell thee, Tom, the strangest story,
Because thou art an honest Tory;
It Is News beyond expressions:
Zich zights are no where to be zeen
In any Land, ( God zave the Queen)
But at our Quarter Sessions.
Vor Rogues I zaw in zich a place,
As would the Gibbet quite disgrace,
It Is pity it should want 'em:
But how the Devil they came there,
List, Tom, and chil in brief declare
And how they did recant 'em,
When I was late at London Town,
To zee zome zights e^r I went down,
To White Hall I did venture;
And having on my best Array,
As vine as on a Holy Day,
Zoors I made bold to enter.
Up stairs I went, which were as brooad,
And Dirty too as any Rooad,
Or as the streets of the Zity.
Had thou been there, thou would have said
His Majesty had kept no Maid,
Gods zooks, and that is a pity.
When I was up, I did discern
A Chamber bigger than a Barn,
Where I did see Voke stand,
That I was well near vrighted quite,
It was so strange and grim a zight,
With long things in their hand.
Their Clothing cannot well be told,
on which were things of beaten Gold
Upon their Back and Breast;
I doft my Hat when I came in,
Quoth I, Pray which of you's the King?
Which made a woundy Jest.
At last came by a Gentlemon,
Who made me zoon to understond
I need not be avear'd;
Quoth he, Come on, and vollow me,
Chil show thee straight His Majesty;
Vor thease are but His Guard.
But, Tom, not any Wake or Vair
Can show zich numbers as are there,
Still cringing low, and bowing,
That I may zwear, and tell no lie,
They wearier are, than Thou or I
With Thrashing or with Plowing.
No Ants do vaster lead or drive,
Or Bees buz to or fro' the Hive,
I ma^l they were not dizzy;
And zure the Nations great Avairs
Lay heavily upon their Cares,
They looked zo wise and busy.
At last came in His Majesty,
Not taller much than Thou or I;
Yet, whatzoe'r I ailed,
With only gazing on his Vace,
I trembled like a Love-zick Lass
Just on the point to yield.
He looked, methought, above the rest,
Tho not by half zo vinely dressed,
Which made me vall a zwearing,
A Pox upon the Parliament,
That will not let us pay him Rent,
Gold's only for his wearing
A Ribbon vine came cross avore,
Zich as our Landlords bridemen wore
At end of which was hung
A curious thing, that shone as bright
As Maudlin's eyes, or morning light,
When gilded by the Zun,
But now the news, chil tell thee Truth,
Hard by hi^ zide there stood a Youth,
That look^d as trim and gay,
As if de had not guilty bin
Of wishing ever to be a King,
Unless a King of May.
It was the zame our Vicar zed
Vor Treason should have last his Head,
Vor which ^ive hundred Pound
By Proclamation offered was
To any that should take his Grace
In any Kerson ground.
Won Zunday morn, thou may remember,
I think the twantieth of Zeptember,
Our Parson read a thing,
How this zame Spark, (a vengeance on him!)
With vorty moor, did take upon him
To kill our Gracious King.
But scant the vrighted harmless Zwain,
That meets a Wolf upon the Plain,
Was so aghast with vear:
Wounds! if His Majesty (quoth I)
Does keep no better Company,
Chil stay no longer here.
With that, the Mon that brought me in
By the Jacket pulled me back again;
Quoth he, Pray hear ye reason;
He was a What-d'ye-cal't, it is true,
But^s Pardon makes him vree as you
Vrom Knavery or Treason.
Whaw, whaw! quoth I, a pretty Nick,
To make Rogues honest by a trick
Zo often tried in vain:
As if my Bull should gore me once*
I Would trust the zenseless Beast with Horns
To gore me o'r again.
Chil even to Devonshire again,
Where honest men are honest men,
And Rogues are hanged v^r Rogues.
Ods wounds! were I His Majesty,
Ever zich a Zon should counten^nc^d be,
Chi'd prize him as my Dogs.
Unfortunate Jockey; or, Jenneys Lamentation for the loss of Jockey.
A pleasant Tune, sung in the Play called, The Royalist.
1.
Two bony Lads were Sawny and Jockey,
Sawny was lewd, and Jockey unluckey,
Sawney was tall, well favored, and witty,
But I'se in my heart thought Jockey more pretty
For when he su'd me, wooed me, and viewed me,
Never was lad so like to undo me,
Fie I cried, and almost died,
Lest Jockey should gang and come no more to me.
2.
Jockey would love, but he would not marry,
And I'se had a dread that I'se should miscary
His cunning Tongue with wit was so gilded,
That I'se was afraid my heart would have yielded
For daily he pressed me, kissed me, and blessed me,
Lost was the hour methought when he mist me,
Crying, denying, and sighing, I wooed him,
And muckle ado I had to get fro him.
3.
But cruel Fate robbed me of my Jewel,
For Sawny would make him fight in Duel,
And down in a Dale with Cypress surrounded,
Ha! there to his death poor Jockey was wounded
But when he thrilled him, felled him, killed him,
Who could express my grief that beheld him?
Raging, I tore my Hair for to bind him,
And vowed and swore never to stay behind him.
4.
I sighed and sob'd until I was weary,
To think my poor Jockey should so miscarry,
And never was any in such a sad taking
As hapless Jenny, whose heart is still a king,
To think how I crossed him, tossed him and lost him;
Too late it was to coin words to accost him,
Alone then I sat lamenting and crying,
Still wishing each minute that I were a dying.
5
Ah! Jockey since thou behind thee have left me,
And death of all joys and all comforts bereft me,
Thy destiny I will lament very mickle
And down my pale cheeks salt Tears they shall trickle;
To ease me of trouble each bubble shall double,
To think of my Jockey so Loyal and Noble,
I'se grieve for to think that those eyes are benighted
Wherein mournful Jenny so much once delighted
6.
That blow oh Sawny was base and unlucky,
That robbed poor Jenny of her dearest Jockey,
A bony boon Youth 'twas known he was ever
To please his poor Jenny was still his endeavor;
But 'twas fortune uncertain, our parting,
Procured and caused this breaking and smarting,
But whilst I do live it is resolved by Jenny,
For Jockeys dear sake never to lig with any.
7.
This Jenny for Jockey lay sighing and weeping,
Often wringing her hands while others was sleeping
But Sawney to see her thus strangely distressed,
For the loss of her Love, his heart was oppressed,
Though this deluder, viewed her, and sued her,
'Twas all but in vain, for she called him Intruder
And said, if you die for my Love I will mock ye,
For you were the cause of the death of my Jockey.
8.
That bony brave Scot has left nene behind him,
That like to himself was worthy of minding,
^is Fathers delight, and the joy of his Mother;
And Scotland before never bred sike another,
When I think on his beauty, let duty confute ye.
Death never before had sike a great booty,
For all that do know him, do sigh and bewail him,
But Oceans of Tears now can little avail him.
9.
Ah! Jockey there is nene that are left to inherit
The tithe of thy Virtues, thou wonderful merit,
But whilst I do live thou shall not be forgotten,
He sing out thy praise when thy carcass is rotten
For thou were the fairest, rarest, and dearest,
And now thou art dead like a Saint thou appearest,
I Will have on thy Tombstone these Verses inserted,
Here lies hopeless Jockey, who was so true hearted.
10.
And when this thy Motto shall fairly be written,
There Is none shall read but with grief shall be smitten
And say it was pity that one so true hearted
Should by cruel death from his Jenny be parted.
And thus I with weeping, creeping, and peeping
Look into thy Grave where thou do lie sleeping
Till sighing my self I have brought to my end,
To show that poor Jenny was Jockeys true Friend.
The Winchester Wedding; or, Ralph of Redding, and Black Bess of the Green.
To a new Country Dance: or, the King's Jigg^
1.
AT Winchester was a Wedding,
the like was never seen
Twixt lusty Ralph of Redding,
and bony black Bess of the Green*
The Fiddlers were Crowding before,
each Lass was as fine as a Queen,
There was a Hundred and more,
for all the Country came in:
Brisk Robin led Rose so fair,
she looked like a Lilly o'th'Vale,
And Ruddy-fac'd Harry led Mary,
And Roger led bouncing Nell.
2
With Tommy came smiling Katy,
he helped her over the Style,
And swore there was none so pretty,
in forty and forty long mile:
Kit gave a Green Gown to Betty,
and lent her his hand to rise.
But Jenny was jeered by Watty,
for looking blew under the eyes:
Thus merrily chatting all,
they passed to the Bride-house along
With Jonny and pretty faced Nanny,
the fairest of all the Throng.
3.
The Bridegroom came out to meet 'em,
afraid the Dinner was spoiled,
And ushered 'em in to Treat 'em,
with Baked, and Roasted, and Boyl^d;
The Lads were so frolic and jolly,
for each had his Love by his side,
But Willy was Melancholy,
for he had a mind to the Bride:
Then Philip begins her Health,
and turns a Beer-Glass on his Thumb,
But Jenkin was reckoned for Drinking,
the best in Christendom.
4.
And now they had Dined, advancing
into the midst of the Hall,
The Fiddlers struck up for Dancing,
and Jeremy led up the Brawl;
But Margery kept a quarter,
a Lass that was proud of her pelf,
'Cause Arthur had stolen her Garter,
and swore he would tie it himself:
She strugl'd and blushed, and frowned,
and ready with anger to Cry,
'Cause Arthur with tying her Garter,
had slipped his hand too high.
5.
And now for throwing the Stocking,
the Bride away was led,
The Bridegroom got drunk was knocking
for Candles to light 'em to Bed:
But Robbin that found him silly,
most friendly took him aside,
The while that his Wife with Willy,
was playing at Hoopers-hide;
And now the vvarm Game begins,
the Critical minute was come,
And Chatting, and Billing, and Kissing,
went merrily round the Room.
6.
Pert Stephen was kind to Betty,
and blithe as a Bird in the Spring,
And ^ommy was so to Katy,
and Wedded her with a Rush Ring:
Sukey that Danced at the Cushion,
an hour from the Room had been gone,
And Barnaby knevv by her blushing,
that some other Dance had been done;
And thus of Fifty fair Maids,
that came to the Wedding with Men,
Scarce five of the Fifty was left ye,
that so did return again.
A Narrative of the Old Plot, being a New SONG.
Tune, Some say the ^apists had a Plot, etc.
1.
WHen Traitors did at Pop^ry rail,
Because it taught Confession:
When Bankrupts bawled for Property,
And Bastards for Succession.
2.
When Tony durst espouse the Cause,
Spite of his Pox and Gout:
When Speaking Williams purged the House
By spewing Members out.
3.
When Hunt a twy-fac't Pamphlet wrote,
the Emblem of his Soul:
When Oats swore whom he pleased in's Plot*
And reigned without Control.
4.
When L -- ce too lampoon'd the Court,
And libelled Cats and Dogs:
When Witnesses, like Mushroms, sprung
Out of the Irish Boggs.
5.
Then Perkin thought 'twas time to prove
His Claim to Kingship fair;
And 'faith it is sit the Peeples Son
Should be the Peoples Heir.
6.
So filled with Zeal He and his Knight
Caress and Court the Rout;
And my Lord Duke goes up and down
To show his Grace about.
7.
Though F -- d Lord G -- y would not engage
Upon that idle score;
For He would have a Commonwealth,
As well as Common whore.
8.
He envy^d his old Friend a Crown
But why I cannot devise;
For's Grace had graced his Lordships head
With Horns of noble Size.
9.
Then Johnson wrote his Patrons Creed,
A Doctrine fetched from Hell:
'Twas Christian-like to disobey,
And Gospel to Rebel.
10.
Julian his Pattern and his Text;
A meaner Theme He scorns:
First represents Him at the Desk,
And then Apostate turns.
11.
Like his, his Patrons Zeal grew high,
The Exclusion to advance;
And the right Heir must be debarred,
For fear of Rome and France.
12.
The Zealous Commons then resolved,
(And they knew what they did)
By whomsoe're the King should fall,
The Papists throats should bleed*
13.
So murdering Ponyards off are slipped
Into a guiltless hand:
And Innocence is sacrificed,
Whilst Malefactors stand.
14.
By Hell's Assistance then they framed
Their Damned Association:
And Worthy Men, and Men Worthy,
Divided all the Nation
15.
Fools often and Madmen leave the less,
And choose the greater evil:
Thus They for fear of Popery,
Run headlong to the Devil.
16.
At last the Loyal Souls propose
To ease their Sovereign's Cares;
If He Will sit down, and first remove
Their Jealousies and Fears.
17.
Just the old Trick and Sham Device
Of Beelzebub their Sire:
He but fall down and worship Them,
They Will grant his hearts desire.
18.
Nay Lives and Fortunes then shall be
Entirely all his own;
If He will fairly once disclaim
A Brother and a Crown.
The Praise of the Dairy-Maid, with a Lick at the Cream-pot, or Fading Rose.
Tune, Packington's Pound.
1.
LEt Wine turn a Spark, and Ale huff like a Hector.
Let Pluto drink Coffee, and Jove his rich Nector.
Neither Cider nor Sherry,
Metheglin nor Perry,
Shall more make me Drunk, which the vulgar call Merry:
These Drinks over my Fancy no more shall prevail
But I Will take a full soop at the merry Milk-Pail.
2.
In praise of a Dairy I purpose to sing;
But all things in order; first God save the King,
And the Queen I may say,
That every May Day,
Has many fair Dairy-Maids all fine and gay.
Assist me, fair Dam'sels to finish this Theme,
And inspire my fancy with Strawberries and Cream
3.
The first of fair Dairy-Maids, if you will believe,
Was Adam's own Wife, your Great-grand-mother Eve;
She milk'd many a Cow,
As well she knew how,
Though Butter was then not so cheap as it is now;
She hoarded no Butter nor Cheese on a Shelf,
For the Butter and Cheese in those days made it self.
4.
In that Age or Time there was no damned Money,
Yet the Children of Israel fed on Milk and Honey;
No Queen you could see
Of the highest Degree,
But would milk the brown Cow with the meanest she
Their Lambs gave them Clothing, their Cows gave them Meat.
In a plentiful Peace all their Joys were complete.
5.
But now of the making of Cheese we shall treat,
That Nurser of Subjects, bold Britains chief Meat.
When they first begin it,
To see how the Rennet
Begets the first Curd, you would wonder what is in it.
Then from the blue Whey, when they put the Curds by.
They look just like Amber, or Clouds in the Sky.
6.
Your Turkey Sherbet, and Arabian Tea,
Is Dish-water-stuff to a Dish of new Whey;
For it cools Head and Brains,
Ill Vapors it drains,
And though your Guts rumble, 'twill ^e'r hurt your Brains.
Court-Ladies in the morning will drink a whole Pottle,
And send out their Pages with Tankard and Bottle.
7.
Thou Daughter of Milk, and Mother of Butter,
Sweet Cream, thy due praises how shall I utter!
For when at the best,
A thing's well expressed,
We are apt to reply, That Is the Cream of the Jest:
Had I been a Mouse, I believe in my Soul
I had long since been drowned in a Cream-Bowl.
8
The Elixir of Milk, the Dutch-mens delight,
By motion and tumbling thou bring to light;
But Oh, the soft Stream
That remains of the Cream!
Old Morpheus never tasted so sweet in a Dream;
It removes all Obstructions, depresses the Spleen,
And makes an old Bawd like a Wench of Fifteen.
9.
Amongst the rare Virtues that Milk does produce
A thousand more Dainties are daily in use;
For a Pudding I Will tell ye,
Ever it goes in the Belly,
Must have good Milk, both the Cream and the Jelly;
For a dainty fine Pudding without Cream or Milk
Is like a Citizen's Wife without Satin or Silk.
10.
In the Virtues of Milk there is more to be mustered
The charming delights of Cheese-Cake and Custard;
For at Totenam-Court
You can have no Sport,
Unless you give Custards and Cheese-Cakes for it:
And what is Jack Pudding that makes us to laugh,
Unless he has got a great Custard to quaff.
11.
Both Pan-Cakes and Fritters of Milk have good store
But a Devonshire Whit-pot requires much more.
No state you can ^hink,
Though you study and wink,
From the lusty Sack-posset to poor Posset Drink;
But Milk's the Ingredient, though Sack's never the worse;
For it is Sack makes the Man, though Milk makes the Nurse,
12.
But now I shall treat of a Dish that is cool,
A rich clouted Cream, or a Goose-berry-Fool;
A Lady I heard tell,
Not far off did dwell,
Made her Husband a Fool, and yet pleased him full well:
Give thanks to the Dairy then every Lad,
That from good-natured Women such Fools may be had.
13.
When the Dam'sel has got the Cows Teat in her hand
How she merrily sings, while smiling I stand
Then with pleasure I rub,
Yet impatient I crub,
When I think of the Blessings of a Syllabub:
Oh Dairy-maids, Milk-maids, such Bliss never oppose.
If ever you will be happy; I speak under the Rose.
14.
This Rose was a Maiden once of your Profession,
Till the Rake and the Spade had taken possession;
At length it was said,
That one Mr. Edmond
did both dig and sow in her Parsley bed;
But the Fool for his labor deserves not a Rush,
For grafting a Thistle upon a Rose-bush.
15.
Now Milk Maids, take warning by this Maidens fall.
Keep what is your own, and then you keep all;
Mind well your Milk-pan,
And never touch a man,
And you will still be a Maid, let him do what he can.
I am your Well-wisher, then list to my word,
And give no more Milk than the Cow can afford
A new SONG Sung before the Loyal Livery-Men in Wistminster-hall July the 19
th. 16^.
1.
HArk! how Noll and B^adshaw's Heads above us
Cry, come, come, ye Whigs that love us:
Come, ye faithful Sons, fall down, and adore ye
Your Fathers, whose Glory
Was to kill Kings before ye;
From Treason and Plots let your grave Heads adjourn,
And our glorious Pinnacle adorn.
What though the Scaffolds all are down here,
To entertain the Friends of the Crown here?
We, whose Lives and whose Fortunes Great Charles will maintain,
For Monarchy-haters,
Damned Associators,
Whigs, Bastards and Traitors,
We'll build 'em, we'll build 'em again,
Let the infamous Cut threats of Princes be shamm'd all.
Their black Souls be damned all,
Their Blunderbuss ramm'd all
With Brimstone and Fire infernal;
The Gods that look o'r Him
Did by Wonders restore Him,
Their Angels sat round Him
That hour they Crowned Him,
And were listed His Guards Eternal.
2.
How, like Jove, the Monarch of Great Britain
Drives the Gyant-Sons of Titan!
Down ye Rebel-Crew; ye Slaves, lie under:
See! Charles with His Thunder
Has dashed 'em all asunder;
Down from His bright Heaven the Aspirers are hurled,
Lost in the common Rubbish of the World:
See, how the God returns Victorious!
And to make His Triumph still more Glorious,
See, the whole Hosts of Heaven the proud Conqueror meet.
The Stars burn all brighter,
The Sun mounts uprighter,
Whilst his Steeds gallop lighter,
To see, see their Jove made so Great:
With the brands and the stings of a Conscience disloyal
From the fiery Trial,
Let the Coward Slaves fly all,
Leave Vengeance and Gibbets behind 'em;
Whilst the great Desperadoes
All turned Renegadoes,
With their old Friends took napping,
In some Cole-hole at Wapping
Shall Charles and His Justice find 'em.
3.
Let the malice of Fanatic Roundhead
(Hatched in Hell) be still confounded;
The Royal Brothers no Storm e're sever,
But new Wonders deliver,
And their Heirs Reign for ever,
On Englands bright Throne sit till Times last Sand runs,
And stop their Glories Chariot with the Suns.
Then for Charles's second Restoration,
Snatched from the Jaws of the Imps of Damnation,
We with Feastings and Revels will cheer up our Souls
For the safety of Caesar,
In Joy, and in Pleasure,
Till our Hearts shall o're-flow like our Bowls.
For a Health to Great Charles, let the Goblets be crowned there,
The Huzza go round there,
To the Skies let it sound there,
Up to the Throne of Great Charles's Protector,
Till the pleased Gods that see, Boys,
Grow as Merry as we, Boys,
Join their Spheres in the Chorus,
Make their whole Heavens out-roar us,
And pledge us in Bumpers of Nectar.

The Contents of the First Part.
How Sir Godfrey is killed, his Body they hide,
Which brought out in Chair, a Horseback does ride;
How Jesuits disguised our Houses to fire;
How subtly they Plot, and the King's death conspire;
Of diverse great Lords drawn in, to their Bane,
An Irish Army, and Pilgrims from Spain.
1.
GOod People, I pray you, give ear unto me.
A Story so strange you have never been told
How the Jesuit, Devil and Pope did agree
Our State to destroy, and Religion so old:
To murder our King,
A most horrible thing!
But first of Sir Godfrey his death I must sing;
For howe'r they disguiss't, we plainly can see,
Who murdr'd that Knight, no good Christian could be.
The truth of my Story if any man doubt,
We have Witnesses ready to swear it all out.
2.
At Somerset house, there is plain to be seen
A Gate which will lead you into the back-Court;
This place for the Murder most sitting did seem,
For thither much People do freely resort:
His Body they tossed
From Pillar to ^ost,
And shifted so often, t'had like to have been lost;
To which with dark-Lanthorn the Jesuits did go,
But no ways distrusted our honest Bedlow.
The truth of my Story, etc
3.
Lest such close Contrivements at length might take air,
When as his dead Body corrupted did grow,
They quickly did find an invisible Chair,
And set him on Horseback to ride at Sohoe:
His own Sword to the Hilt.
To add to their Guilt,
They thrust through his Body, but no blood was spilt;
To Have it thought he was killed by a Thief they did mean,
So they left all is Money, and made his Shoes clean.
The truth of my Story etc.
4.
To show now the excess of Jesuitical Rage,
They this Loyal City to ruin would bring,
'Cause you Citizens are so religious and sage,
And ever much noted as true to your King:
T'your Houses they go
With Fire and with Tow,
Then pilfer your Goods, and it is well you 'scape so;
You Have seen how they once set the Town all in flame;
Yet it is their best Refuge, if we believe Fame.
The Truth of my Story, etc.
5.
By Bedlow's Narration is shown you most clear,
How Jesuits disguss^d into Houses will creep;
In a Porter's or Carman's Frock they appear,
Nay, will not disdain to cry Chimney sweep;
Or sell you Small Cole,
Then drop in some hole
A Fire-Ball, or thrust it up by a long Pole.
But I now must relate a more tragical thing,
How these Villains conspired to Murder our King.
The Truth of my Story, etc.
6.
At the White-horse in April was their main Consul^*
Where a Writing these Plotters wickedly frame;
The Death of our Sovereign was the result,
To which at least Forty all signed their name:
They would not do that,
In the place where they sat,
Trusty Oats must convey't from this man to that;
To make sure work, by Poison the Deed must be done
And by a long Dagger, and shot from a Gun.
The truth of my Story. etc.
7.
For fear at St. Omers their Oats might be missed,
They agreed with the Devil t'appear in his place,
In a Body of Air, (believe't if you list)
Which looked just like Oats* and moved with the same grace.
'T could Plot, it could Cant,
Turn eyes like a Saint,
And of our great Doctor no feature did want:
Thus hundreds might swear they saw Oats every day
But true Oats was here, and the Devil say they.
The truth of my Story, etc.
8.
From Father Oliva Commissions did come,
To raise a great Army much Treasure is spent;
The old Man did once think to take Post from Rome
For to ride at the head of them was his intent;
Lord Bellas was sit
(Who can deny it?
To command in his place, when his Gout would permit;
Lord Stafford was proper'st to trust with their pay
Old Ratcliffe to range them in Battle-Array.
The truth of my Story, etc.
9.
The High-Treasurers place the L. Powis did please,
(Men of desperate Fortunes often venture too far;)
Lord Peter's would hazard Estate, and his Ease,
And Life for the Pope too, in this holy War;
Lord Ar'ndel, of old
So warlike and bold,
Made choice of a Chancellors Gown we are told;
All these did conspire with the Lord Castlemain,
Who now his good Duchess will never catch again
The Truth of my Story, etc.
10.
Great store of wild Irish, both civil and wise,
Designed to join with the Pilgrims of Spain;
Many thousands being ready all in good guise,
Had vowed a long Pilgrimage over the Main;
To arm well this Host
When it came on our Coast,
Black Bills forty thousand are sent by the Post,
This Army lay privately on the Sea shore,
And no man ever heard of 'em since or before.
The Truth of my Story, etc.
The Second PART. The Contents of the second Part.
Of Arms underground for Horse and for Foot,
The King almost killed, but Gun will not shoot,
For which Pickring is whipped. All of them swear
To be true to the Plot; yet Oats, not for Fear,
But Revenge, being turned away, and well hang^d,
Discovers them all; the Jesuits are hanged.
1.
The Plot being thus subtly contrived, as you hear,
To God knows how many this Secret the impart;
Some famous for Cheats, yet their Faith they don't fear
To tie a Knave fast they had found a new Art.
They swore on a Book,
And Sacrament took;
But you will find, if into their grave Authors you look,
To forswear^s no sin (as the Recorder well notes)
Nor Treason, Rebellion, nor cutting of Throats.
The Truth of my Story, etc.
2.
Still blinded by Zeal, and inveigl'd by Hope,
Store of Arms they provide for Fight and Defense;
The Lords must command as Viceroys of the Pope,
And all over England they raise Peter Pence:
Their Letters they send
By Bedlow their Friend,
Or else by the Post, to show what they intend;
Some hundreds Oats saw, which the Jesuits ^id write
It Is a wonder not one of them ever came to light.
The truth of my Story, etc.
3.
Pounds two hundred thousand they to Ireland sent,
Fifteen thousand to Wakeman for Potions and Pills,
Forty thousand in Fireworks we guess that they spent,
And at least ten thousand for the 'foresaid Black-Bills
Fifteen hundred more
Grove should have, they swore,
Four Gentleman-Russians deserved Fourscore;
Pious Pickering they knew was of Masses more fond;
And for thirty thousand they gave him a Bond.
They truth of my Story, etc.
4
These two, to kill the King by promises won,
Had now watch^d for some years in St. James's Park,
And Pickering (who never yet shot off a Gun)
Was about to take aim, for he had a fair mark;
Just going to begin't,
He missed his Flint,
And looking in Pan, there was no Powder in it;
For which he their Pardon does humbly beseech,
Yet had thirty good lashes upon his bare Breech.
The truth of my Story, etc.
5
But a sadder mischance to the Plot did befall,
For Oats their main Engine failed, when it came to it
No marvel indeed if he cozened them all,
Who turned him a begging and beat him to boot.
He wheeling about,
The whole Party did rout
And from lurking holes did ferret them out,
Till running himself blind; he none of them knew,
And fainting at Council, he could not swear true.
The truth of my Story, etc.
6.
To strengthen our Doctor, brave Bedlow's brought in,
A more credible Witness was not above-ground;
He vows and protests, what ever he had been,
He would not swear false now for five hundred pound
And why should we swear,
They falsely would swear,
To damn their own Souls, and to lose by it here;
For Oats, who before had no penny in Purse
Discov'ring the Plot, was seven hundred pound worse.
The truth of my Story, etc.
7*
Two Witnesses more were let loose from the Jayl,
Though one, it is confessed, did run back from his word;
(In danger of life a good man may be frail)
And the other they slander for cheating his Lord*
T'each one of these men
The Jesuits brought Ten,
To disprove em in time and in place; but what then?
One Circumstance lately was sworn most clear,
By a Man who in hopes has four hundred a year.
The truth of my Story, etc.
8.
Besides 'twas often urged, we must always suppose,
To murder the King a great Plot there has been;
And who to contrive it so likely as those
Who Murder and Treasons do hold for no sin;
Things being thus plain,
To plead was in vain,
The Jury instructed again and again,
Did find them all Guilty, and to show 'twas well done
The People gave a Shout for Victory won.
9.
It Is strange how these Jesuits, so subtle and wise,
Should all the Pope be so basely trepanned,
To hang with much comfort when he shall advise,
And go to the Devil too at his command.
He may give them leave
To lie and deceive;
But what when the Rope does of Life them bereave
Can his Holiness, think you, dispense with that pain
Or by his Indulgences raise them again?
The truth of my Story, etc.
1O.
Yet, like Mad men, of Life and Contempt they express
And of their own happiness careless appear;
For Life and for Money not one would confess,
They Would rather be Damned than be Rich and live here.
But surely they raved,
When God they out-brav'd,
And thought to renounce him the way to be saved,
And with Lies in their mouths go to Heaven in a string
So prosper all Traitors, and God save the King.
The truth of my Story, etc.
Concordat cum Kecordo Cl. Par.
A general Sale of Rebellious Household Stuff.
Tune, Old Simon the King.
1.
REbellion has broken up House,
And has left me old Lumber to sell;
Come hither and take your choice;
I Will promise to use you well.
Will you buy the old Speaker's Chair,
Which was warm, and easy to sit-in,
And oftentimes has been made clean,

With threadbare Clothes, and his mamsy Nose,
Sing hey ding, ding, a ding ding.
2.
Will you buy any Bacon-flitches?
They Are the fattest that ever were spent;
They Are the sides of the Old Committees,
Fed up with the Long Parliament.
Here Is a pair of Bellows and Tongs,
And for a small matter I Will sell 'em;
They Are made of the Presbyters Lungs,
To blow up the Coals of Rebellion,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
3.
I had thought to have given them once
To some Blacksmith for his Forge;
But, now I have considered on it,
They Are Consecrated to the Church;
For I Will give them to some Choir,
To make the Organs to rore,
And the little Pipes squeak higher
Than ever they did before,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
4.
Here Is a couple of Stools for sale,
The one square, and the other is round;
Betwixt them both, the Tail
Of the RVMP fell unto the ground.
Will you buy the States Council Table,
Which was made of the good Wain- Scot;
The frame was a tottering Babel,
To uphold the Independent-Plot?
Says old Simon the King, etc.
5.
Here Is the Beesom of Reformation,
Which should have made clean the Floor;
But it swept the Wealth out of the Nation,
And left us Dirt good store.
Will you buy the States Spinning-wheel,
Which spun for the Ropers Trade?
But better it had stood still,
For now it has spun a fair Thread,
Says old Simon the King, etc.

Which was made of a Butchers stump;
And oft-times it has been used
To cure the Colds of the RVMP.
Here Is a lump of Pilgrims-Salve,
Which once was a Justice of Peace,
Who Nol and the Devil did serve;
But now it is come to This,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
7.
Here Is a Roll of States Tobacco,
If any Good Fellow will take it:
It Is neither Virginia nor Spanish,
But I Will tell you how they do make it;
It Is Covenant mixed with Engagement,
With an Abjuration-Oath;
And many of them that did take it
Complain it is foul in the mouth,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
8.
Yet the Ashes may happily serve
To Cure the Scab of the Nation,
When they have an Itch to serve
A Rebellion by Innovation.
A Lanthorn here is be bought,
The like was scarce ever begotten;
For many a Plot 't has found out,
Before they ever were thought on,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
9.
Will you buy the Rump^s great Saddle
Which once did carry the Nation?
And here is the Bitt and the Bridle,
And Curb of Dissimulation
Here Is the Breeches of the Rump,

With an Independent Smock,
Says old Simon the King, etc.

Here Is Oliver's Brewing-Vessels.
And here is his Dray and his Slings,
Here Is Hewson's Aul and his Bristles,
With diverse other odd things.
And what does the Price belong
To all these matters before-ye?
I Will sell them all for an Old Song,
And so I do end my story,
Says old Simon the King,
Says old Simon the King,
With his thread bare Clothes, and his mainsey Nose,
Sing hey ding, ding, a ding ding.
Advice to the City: or, the Whigs Loyalty.
To a Theorbo.
1.
REmember ye Whigs what was formerly done,
Remember your Mischiefs in Forty and One,
When Friend opposed Friend, and Father the Son,
Then, then the Old Cause went rarely on;
The Cap sat aloft, and low was the Crown,
The Rabble got up, and the Nobles went down;
Lay Elders in Tubs,
Ruled Bishops in Robes,
Who mourned the sad Fate
And dreadful Disaster,
Of their Royal Master,
By Rebels betrayed.
Then London be wise, and baffle their Power.
And let them play the old Game no more;
Hang, hang up the Sheri^^^
The Ba^ (...) in Power,
Those (...),
Thos^ Rats of the ^ower,
Whose Canting Tales the Rabble believes,
In a hurry*
And never sorry*
Merrily they still go on,
Fie for shame,
We Are too tame, since they claim the combat;
Tan, ta, ra, ra, ra,
Tan, ta, ra, ra, ra;
Dub, a dub, and let the Drum beat,
The strong Militia guard the Throne.
2.
When Faction possesses the popular Voice,
The Cause is supplied still with Nonsense and noise;
And Toney their Speaker, the Rabble leads on,
He knows if we prosper, that he must run.
Carolina must be his next Station of ease,
And London be rid of her worst Disease.
From Plots and from Spies,
From Treason and Lies,
We shall ever be free,
And the Law shall be able,
To punish a Rebel
As cunning as he.
Then London be wise, etc.
3.
Rebellion never wanted a Loyal pretense;
These Villains swear all is for the good of their Prince:
Oppose our Elections, to show what they dare,
And losing their Charter, Arrest the Lord Mayor.
Fool Jenks was the first of the Cuckoldly Crew,
With Ellis, and Jeykel, and Hubland the Jew.
Famed Sparks of the Town,
For Wealth and Renown,
Give the Devil his due,
And such as we fear,
Had their Sovereign been there,
They Had Arrested Him too.
Then London be wise, etc.
Blanket Fair, or the History of Temple-street. Being a Relation of the merry
Pranks played on the River of Thames during the great Frost.
Tune, Packington's Pound
1.
COme listen a while (though the Weather be cold)
In your Pockets and Plackets your Hands you may hold.
I^ll tell you a Story as true as it is rare,
Of a River turned into a Bartholomew Fair.
Since old Christmas lust
There has been such a Frost,
That the Thames has by half the whole Nation been crossed.
O Scullers I pity your fate of Extremes,
Each Land-man is now become free of the Thames.
2.
It Is some ^a^land Acquaintance of Conjurer Oats,
That has tied up your Hands and imprisoned your Boats
You know he was ever a friend to the Crew
Of all that to Admiral James has bin true.
Where Sculls once did Row
Men walk to and fro,
But e're four months are ended 'will hardly be so.
Should your hopes of a Tha^ by this weather be crossed,
Your Fortunes would soon be as hard as the Frost.
3.
In Roast Beef and Brand* much money is spent
In Booths made of Blankets that pay no Ground-rent
With old fashioned Chimneys the Rooms are secured
And the Houses from danger of Fire ensur'd.
The chief place you meet
Is called Temple-street,
If you do not believe me, then you may go see it.
From the Temple the Students do thither resort,
Who were always great Patrons of Revels and sport.
4.
The citizen comes with his Daughter or Wife,
And swears he never saw such a sight in his life:
The Prentices starved at home for want of O^als,
To catch them a heat do flock thither in shoals,
While the Country Squire
Does stand and admire
At the wondrous conjunction of Water and Fire.
Strait comes an arch Wag, a young Son of a Whore,
And lays the Squires head where his heels ^ere before.
5.
The Rotterdam Dutchman with fleet cutting Scates,
To pleasure the crowd shows his tricks and his feats,
Who like a Rope-dancer (for all his sharp Steels)
His Brains and activity lie in his Heels.
Here are all things like fate
Are in slippery state,
From the sole of the Foot to the crown of the Pate.
While the Rabble in Sledges run giddily round,
And naught but a circle of folly is found.
6.
Here Damsels are handed like Nymphs in the Bath,
By Gentlemen-ushers with Legs like a Lath;
They slide to a Tune, and cry give me your Hand,
When the tottering Fops are scarce able to stand.
Then with fear and with care
They arrive at the Fair,
Where Wenches sell Glasses and cracked Earthen ware;
To show that the World, and the pleasures it brings,
Are made up of brittle and slippery things.
7.
A Spark of the Bar with his Cane and his Muff,
One day went to treat his new rigged Kitchinstuff,
Let slip from her Gallant, the gay Damsel tried
(As often she had done in the Country) to slide,
In the way lay a stump,
That with a damned Thump,
She broke both her Shooe-strings and cripl'd her Rump.
The heat of her Buttocks made such a great thaw.
She had like to have drowned the man of the Law.
8.
All you that are warm both in Body and Purse,
I give you this warning for better or worse,
Be not there in the Moonshine pray take my advice
For slippery things have been done on the Ice.
Maids there have been said
To lose Maidenhead,
And Sparks from full Pockets gone empty to Bed.
If their Brains and their Bodies had not been too warm,
It Is forty to one they had come to less harm.
Freezland-Fair, or the Icey Bear-Garden.
Tune, Packington's Pound.
1.
I Will tell ye a Tale though before 'twas in Print)
If you make nothing on it, than the Devil is in it
It Is no tale of a Tub, nor the Plotting of Treason,
But of very strange things have been done this strange Season.
Ye know there is a Brook,
No, no, I mistook,
For I could not find it, though long I did look;
Yet I do not question, for all these odd freaks,
We shall find it again when-e're the Frost breaks.
2.
If ye do believe what was told us by Oats,
Ye never again will have use of your Boats;
Without ye do now employ the Wheelers to do it,
Ye never never will be able to bring all about.
He talked of a Plot,
Believe it, or not,
To blow up the Thames, and to do it on the Spot;
Then either the Doctor must now be believed,
Or else the Doctor and we are deceived
3.
No Water I see which does fairly incline,
To make me believe that he has Sprung his Mine;
Though that did not do what the Doctor intended,
Yet he may for one thing be said to be commended:
He said that the Pope,
Pray mind, it is a Trope,
Would send us his Bulls, by the way of the Hope;
And though for the sight we have all along bin waiting
I the other day saw on the Ice a Bull-baiting.
4.
I hope you will believe me, 'twas a fine Sight,
As ever I saw on a Queen Besses Night;
Though I must confess I saw no such Dogs there,
As used to attend on the Infallible Chair.
Yet there were some Men.
Whom I knew again,
Who bawled as they did, when they chose Aldermen.
And Faith it had bin a most excellent Show.
Had there bin but some Crackers and Serpents to throw.
5.
Another thing pleased me, as I hope for Life,
I saw of a Man that had gotten a Wife
To see the rare W^imsies, the Woman was sick,
So never suspected a slippery Trick:
But when she came there,
The Ice would not bear,
But whether 'twas his fault or hers, I cannot swear;
Yet thus far is true, had he lost his Wife,
He then might have prayed for a Frost all his life
6.
There Is very fine Tricks, and new subject for Laughter,
For there you may take a Coach and go by Water,
So get a Tarpauling too, as you are Jogging,
Though a Nymph the other day for it got a good Flogging.
There was an old Toast,
Of Beef had a Roast,
Which fell into the Sellar, and fairly was lost.
O see in old Proverbs sometimes there is truth,
A man is not sure of his Meat till in's Mouth.
7.
But I had forgot my chief bus^ness I swear,
To give an Account of new Temple street Fair;
Where most of the Students do daily resort,
To show the great love they had always for sport.
Who often give a Token,
I hope't may be spoken,
To Whore in a Mask, who squeaks like a Pig a Poke in
To see such cracked Vessels sail is a new matter,
Who have bin so shattered between Wind and Water.
8.
Like Babel this Fair's not built with Brick or stone
Though here I believe is as great Confusion;
Now Blanckets are forced double Duty to pay,
On Beds all the night, and for Houses all day;
But there is something more,
Some people deplore,
Their carelessly leaving open Sellar door,
Which puts me in mind of Jack Presbyter's trick,
Who from Pulpit descends the like way to old Nick,
9.
Come all ye young Damsels both swarthy and fair,
This is the best place to put off your Cracked Ware;
Here Is Chapmen good store who to it stiffly will stand,
And scorn to put Coin that is false in your Hand:
While you're there abiding,
And on the Ice Gliding,
Let 'em say what they will, it is but a backsliding:
But if ye should Prove, then say I am a Prophet,
Though it is a slippery trick there shall come no more of it
10.
There Is many more Tricks, but too long to be told,
Which are not all new, though there is none of 'em old
There Is the Fellow that Printeth the Old Bailey Trial
Who to all the dull Printers does give a Denial;
He Will Print for a S^ce,
(For that is his price
Your Name (that you brag may 'twas done) on the Ice.
And Faith I do think it a very fine thing,
So my Tale's at an end, but first, God save the King,
Toney's Soliloquies.
Tune, The Lamentation of a bad Market.
1.
WHen the Plot I first invented,
I was ravished in conceit,
To see its Frame so well cemented,
Varnished over with Deceit.
It was an Infant of my Spirit,
Nay, the Darling of my Soul,
If its contrivance be a Merit,
By Jove the Cooper did well Boul.
2.
For to give this Engine Motion,
To arrive where it did tend,
I filled the Vulgar ears with 'Notions,
And Gospel of my Oaten Friend;
I antedated all Transactions,
Distinguished Styles of New and Old,
In the State I made such Fractions;
Some I Bought, and some I Sold.
3.
The Mobile I so distempered,
With the Magic of my Care,
None but would his Soul have ventured
Where brave Toney bore a Share;
Have I not in Abomination
Held the Miter and Lawn Sleeves,
And Itcht at a second Sequestration,
To pull down such Ghostly Thieves.
4.
Have I not Taught the Sanhedrim*
To Imperate and not Obey?
The had Genuflections done to them,
Which men to Crowned Heads do pay.
Then would I Barter for Repeal
O'th Five and Thirtieth of Q. Bess,
To make a way for Commonweal,
(The Center of our Happiness.)
5.
How many hot and high Debates,
In favor of the Exclusive Bill,
I bandy'd 'twixt the two Estates,
The effects of my depraved will!
By Subornation, to the Block
I brought, a Loyal Noble Peer;
And trusted others to that Lock,
Which cost my Buck and me so dear.
6.
In fine, poor profligated Wretch,
For to indulge my Minion Spite,
My Seared Conscience I did stretch,
And did Old Rowley's Guards Indict
I did espouse all Wickedness,
And only loved what is purely Evil;
In that alone was my excess;
Then take thy own Associate, Devil.
Rejoice in Triumph, Or a Plaudite on the Ottamens defeat at Vienna.
Tune, Hark how the thundering Connons roar.
1.
I AM glad to hear the Cannons roar
Resounding from the German shore,
Better News than heretofore,
That Babels Beast is wounded;
The Christians brave, both all and some
Charge with the Horse and Kettle-Drum,
The Enemy of Christendom,
Till ^urks are quite confounded.
2.
The King of Poland (in a Phraise)
The great Grand-Seigneur did amaze,
And the noise his Siege did raise,
Courageous Solymannus!
(If you resolve to come again)
You must recruit both might and main,
Or else it will be all in vain,
To think that thy'l trepan us.
3.
His Christian Majesty of France
Does Booty play, the Germans dance,
And he does laugh at our mischance,
Himself he dare not venture;
But Pimp the Beast, and Babels Whore,
And he ^o-peep stands at the door,
While the wanton Cannon roar,
Then Hector-like he will enter.
4.
But spite on Turk, and Great Mogul,
And Pox upon the Scarlet Trull,
And we Poppie too dare pull,
If Charles be our Commander;
For though He Neutral seem to be,
He can command both Land and Sea,
And overthrow the big-look'd Three,
And trace brave Alexander.
5.
Then let no rancor joined with hate
Make Ruptures in the Church or State,
But all submit to Divine Fate,
And keep within our Border;
Let none old England then forsake,
(Since Crowns and Kingdoms lie at Stake)
If Foreign War to undertake,
Till Charles get further Order.
6.
The Germans tall that heretofore,
They Captive took one Bull and Boar,
The Minotaurus of a Whore,
Did roar like any Thunder;
Then P. P. how could this be
The Great Gibralter of the Sea?
Whose Army was to Fight with thee
And force the World to wonder.
7.
But Ottomon pray get you gone,
We Christians do but draw you on;
We Will greater Booty have, or none,
And if you will not prevent it;
If ever you turn your Face this way
We Will make the Cannon music play,
And you shall Dance the English Hay,
Till all your bones lament it.
8.
Our Royal James will make you know
The sharpness of a Yorkshire Ho,
And prove by Land, and Sea your Foe
If Charles command to do it;
Both England, Scotland, Dutch and Dane,
And all his Islands of the M^^h
Will not be able to refrain;
If he once say do it.
9
Then fill the Piss-pot to the Swine,
Heap me a rousing Glass of Wine,
The dancing Thames shall pledge the Rhine
And Tyber shall be Praeses;
Then here is to Charles that rules the Main,
To Poland, Holland, Scot and Dane,
To Germany, and brave Lorrain;
But pray you po^us ne sis.

Tune, Which no body can deny.
ALas what is is like to become of the Plot
Now To^ey^s dead, and Titus is go^
In so fair a prospect of going to Pot?
Which no body can deny.
They say he has lately revived an old trick,
Which he used as a Medicine when he was Love sick,
Page, Bailiff or Bum to take in the Nick,
Which no body can deny.
Now Titus for one of his Saints Tutelars,
Had got a young Fellow as Brawny as Mars,
With a thousand invincible Charms in his A --
Which no body can deny.
A large pair of Buttocks as ever was seen,
With a delicate Nut-brown hole between,
And rascally Cupid lay lurking Within.
Which no body can deny.
Whence Centinel-like with his Gun in his hand,
He spied out the Doctor and charged him to stand,
Not doubting but He would obey his command
Which no body can deny.
But he disobeyed; which when Cupid espied,
He quickly presented: Have-at-you he cried,
And lodged him a Bullet in his left side,
Which no body can deny, etc.
It Is true he was armed (as Poets have told)
With only a Bow and a Quiver of old,
And Arrows for Love, which were headed with Gold,
Which no etc.
Which still he does use, as h'has formerly done,
When the old way of Loving he means to drive on
But for this new way he makes use of a Gun,
Which no, etc.
The Gun went off bounce, yet the Dr. never started
Which was some effect of his being stout-hearted,
For he only thought that the Fellow had farted,
Which no body can deny.
But quickly he found he had cause to repent it,
For Cupid had poisoned the shot^e^r he sent it,
With something so strong, you might easily scent it.
Which no body can deny.
This poison so basely debases Loves Fires,
That the foulest of object* ^he Lover admires,
And so it inclined the good Doctor's Desires,
Which no body can deny.
For he fell in love ('it is a kind of a Riddle)
Immediately with this great Fellows Bumfiddle;
But chiefly he s^irkt at the Slit in the middle,
Which no body can deny.
Quoth he in a rage, What a plague have you done?
Your Barrel is foul, I Will lay Twenty to One;
But I have a Rammer will scour your Gun,
Which no body can deny.
Nay, never refuse, but leave off your winking;
There Is no body near, and it is just to my thinking,
That I should chastize you thus for your stinking
Which no body can deny.
So down went the Breeches, and he fell to work;
About him he laid, as he had been a Turk:
And so this great business was done with a Jerk,
Which no body can deny.
And truly the business was great in its kind;
For the Fellow was very well scoured behind,
And the Dr. was eased both in Body and Mind,
Which no body can deny.
No Protestent-Plot; or, the Whigs Loyalty With the Doctor's New Discovery,
1.
HElls restless Factious Agents still Plot on,
And Eighty Three smells rank of Forty One;
The Royal Martyrs Foes pursue his Son,
Who seek their Lives with Blunderbuss and Guns;
The Infernal Regicides so inflamed with Zeal,
Are for killing King and Duke, t'Erect a Commonweal
This is the daily Trade and practice of our Modern Whiggs,
Though they are always baffled in their damned Intrigues.
2.
What! Ho! cries Titus, rise ye sleepy Heads,
Unless you will all be Murdered in your Beds;
Fierce Hannibal of France is at your Gate,
Come Rascals, Mutiny ever it is too late:
The Spanish Pilgrims once hired to cut your Throats
Are Landed now at Milford Haven, believe your Savior Oats;
And the Horrid Popish Army, that were hid under Ground,
Are, I Will take my Oath, within a Trumpets Sound.
3.
See there, a Fighting Army in the Air!
But now it vanishes, and disappears;
A Spectre told strange Things to Honest Bess,
Which much amazed the Hatfield Prophetess;
I told 'em true at first, what Black Designs would be
Carry^d on against the King, and Royal Alban^,
By the discontended Whiggs; but Rebel Tony since,
Made me contradict my former evidence.
4.
I Have lost my Swearing Trade, now by this Hand,
Must I be forced to starve, or leave the Land^
My injured Prince has long since on me frowned,
For Perjuries against his Life and Crown:
I Will follow Rumbold, Wade, Nelthrop, Walcot, Hone,
With that Cruel Blood-Hound Barton, who have all fled the Town;
For if I carry here any longer, I harbor dreadful Fears,
That I shall be Hanged, or forfeit both my Ears.
5.
Unparalled Assassines, that could dare
To attempt the Life of Jove's Vicegerent here:
Of whom the Gods do take such special care,
None ought to mutter Treason to the Air;
But Cutthroat Protestants may do any thing,
And Inform the Roman Catholics how to Murder Kings;
They take it in great Dudgeon to be equaliz'd
Yet their Hellish Crimes must pass for Loyalty.
6.
But thanks to Heaven, who did curb their Power,
And has preserved us from that Fatal Hour:
When Villains were to Massacre us all,
And Noll's Successors to possess White Hall;
Rumsey has taken up White hall for his Bower,
And the Lord Russel is gone to fortify the Tower:
Whilst we that stand for Church and State, with great security can Sing.
And Pray Jove to preserve the Life of Charles our King.
The Loyal Conquest, or Destruction of Treason.
Tune, Lay by your Pleading, the Law ly's a Bleeding.
1.
NOw Loyal Tories
May Triumph in Glories,
The Fatal Plot is now betrayed,
The rest were Shams and Stories.
Now against Treason,
We have Law and Reason;
And every Bloody Whig must go,
To Pot in Time and Season.
No Shamming, nor Flamming,
No Ramming, nor Damming,
No Ignoramus Jury's now,
For Whigs, but only Hanging,
2.
Look a little farther,
Place things in order,
Those that seek to Kill their King,
Godfrey might Murder,
Now they are Detected,
By Heaven Neglected;
In black despair cut their Throats,
Thus Pluto's Work's effected.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
3.
Catch grows in Passion,
And fears this New Fashion;
Lest every Traitor hang himself,
And spoil his best Profession.
Though four in a Morning
Tyburn Adorning;
He Cries out for a Score a time,
To get his Men their Learning.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
4.
Now we have founded
The bottom which confounded,
Our Plotting Parliament of late
Who had our King surrounded.
Hamden and others,
And Trenchard were Brothers;
Who were to kill the King and Duke
And hang us for their Murders.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
5.
Surprising the Tower
And Court in an Hour,
And enter in at the Traitors Gate,
But was not in their Power.
Our Guards now are Doubled,
E're long they will be Trebled,
The Harmony of Gun and Drum,
Makes Guilty Conscience Troubled.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
6.
If Gray is Retaken,
The Root of the Plot is shaken,
Russel lately lost his Head,
The Bleeding Cause to Waken.
M -- h in Town still,
With Armstrong his Council*
The Lady G -- y may find him out,
Under some Smock or Gown still.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, etc.
7.
Give 'em no Quarter,
They Aim at Crown, and Garter,
They Are of that Bloody Regiment,
That made their King a Martyr.
Leave none to breed on,
They Would make us to bleed on;
They are the bloody'st Caniballs
That ever men did Read on.
No Shamming, nor Flamming,
No Ramming nor Damming,
No Ignoramus Jury's now,
For Whiggs, b^t onl^ Hanging.
State and Ambition, A New SONG at the Dukes Theater.
STate and Ambition alas will deceive ye,
there is no solid joy but the Blessing of Love,
Scorn does of pleasure fair Silvia bereave ye,
your fame is not perfect till that you remove:
Monarch's that sway the vast Globe in their glory
now Love is their brightest jewel of Power,
Poor Strephon's heart was ordained to adore ye,
ah! then disdain his Passion no more.
2.
Jove in his Throne was the Victim of Beauty,
his thunder laid by he from Heaven came down
Shaped like a Swan, to fair Leda paid duty,
and prized her far more, than his Heavenly Crown
She too was pleased with her Beautiful Lover,
she strok'd his fair Plumes and feasted her Eye,
And he too in loving knew well how to move her,
by Billing begins the business of Joy.
3.
Since Divine Powers examples have given,
If we do not follow their precepts we sin,
Sure 'twill appear an affront to their Heaven,
If when the Gates open we enter not in;
Beauty my dearest was from the beginning,
ordained to cool Man's amorous rage,
And she that against that decree will be sinning
in Spring, she will find the Winter of Age.
4.
Think on the pleasure while Love's in its glory,
let not your scorn Loves great Altar disgrace,
The time may come when no Swain will adore ye
or smooth the least wrinkle age lays on your face;
Then have to enjoyment whilst love is fresh blooming,
and in thy height and vigor of day.
Each minute we lose, our pleasure's consuming,
and seven years to come, will not one past repay.
5.
Think my dear Silvia, the Heavenly blessing,
of loving in Youth, is the Crown of our days,
Short are the hours where Love is possessing;
but tedious the minuits when crossed with delays
Love's the soft Anvil where Nature's agreeing,
all mankind are formed, and by it they move,
It Is thence my dear Silvia and I have our being,
the Caesar and Swain spring from Almighty Love.
6.
I see my dear Silvia at last has consented,
that blush in your Cheek does plainly appear,
And naught but delay shall be ever repented,
so faithful I Will prove, and so true to my Dear
Then Hymen prepare, and light all thy Torches,
perfume thy head Altar, and strew all the way,
By little degrees Love makes his approaches,
but Revels at night for the loss of the day.
Pluto, the Prince of Darkness, his Entertainment of Colonel Algernoon Sidney,
upon his Arrival at the Infernal Palace
Tune, Hail to Myrtle Shade,
Pluto. Room for great Algernoon,
You Furies that stand in his ^ay;
Let an Officer to me come,
who served me every day,
Promoting Sedition and Evil,
To alter the Church and State,
He deserves an Employment in Hell,
He has done great service of late.

Pluto. He Is one of the Damned old Crew,
Who Voted the Death of the King;
At Oxford again he did sue
To be at the self-same thing.
All Mischiefs on Earth he devised,
All hazards he also did run,
To render my Name solemnized
With the Rabble of London Town.

Pluto. To Monarchy he was a Foe,
Religion he always disdained,
Against Government and Laws too,
Damned Anarchy he maintained:
I Will give Thee Preferment here,
Since England has banished thee thence,
Brave Sidney thou need'st not fear,
Thou shall have great recompense.

Shaftsbury. Now Monarchy has prevailed,
Our Fanatic Plots to defeat,
On whom is the Cause entailed?
Who Will stand it in spite of Fate?
We that maintained it so long
From Justice were forced to fly;
If you then had come along,
You needed not there to die.

Essex. The Factious are quite undone,
For loss of the Fanatic Peers:
Now Shaftsbury and I are gone,
Poor Oats has lost his Ears?
For M -- h our Shams and Intrigues
To The World has plainly declared,
And H -- d our solemn Leagues,
In the Plot a long time prepared.

Russel. I Am glad you are safe arrived,
Though I doubt you met Jack by the way
Now M -- h is reconciled,
What a plague is become of Gray?
Rebellion could never disallow
Conspiring against the Prince,
Though I by a Sham-dying Vow
Did plead great Innocence.

The Kings Health, set to Farrinel's Grounds. In six PARTS,
First Strain.
JOy to Great Caesar,
Long Life, Love and Pleasure;
It Is a Health that Divine is,
Fill the Bowl high as mine is;
Let none fear a Fever,
But take it off thus Boys;
Let the King leave for ever,
It Is no matter for us Boys.
Second Strain.
TRy all the Loyal,
Defy all,
Give denial;
Sure none thinks his Glass too big here,
Nor any Prig here,
Or Sneaking Whig here,
Of Cripple Tony's Crew,
That now looks blew,
His Heart Aches too,
The Tap will not do,
His Zeal so true,
And Projects new,
Ill Fate does now pursue.
Third Strain.
LEt Tories Guard the King,
Let Whigs in Halters swing;
Let Pilk and Shute be shamed,
Let Bugg'ring Oats be damn^d;
Let Cheating Player be nicked,
The Turn-coat Scribe be kicked;
Let Rebel City Don's
Never beget their Sons;
Let every Whiggish Peer
That Rapes a Lady fair,
And leaves his only Dear
The Sheets to gnaw and tear,
Be punished out of Hand,
And forced to pawn his Land
T'attone the grand Affair.
Fourth Strain
GReat Charles, like Jehovah, spares those would un-King him,
And warms with His Graces the Vipers that sting Him;
'Till Crowned with just Anger the Rebels he seizes:
Thus Heaven can Thunder when ever it pleases.
Jigg.
THen to the Duke fill, fill up the Glass,
The Son of our Martyr, beloved of the King*
Envied and Loved,
Yet Blessed from above,
Secured by an Angel safe under his Wing.
Sixth Strain.
FAction and Folly,
And State Melancholy,
With ^ony in Whigland for ever shall dwell;
Let Wit, Wine, and Beauty,
Then teach us our Duty,
For none e're can Love, or be Wise and Rebel.
A New SONG on the Instalment of Sir John Moor Lord Mayor of London.
Tune, St. George for England.
YOu London Lads rejoice,
And cast away your Care,
Since with one Heart and Voice
Sir John is chosen Mayor;
The Famous Sir John Moore,
Lord Mayor of London Town,
To your eternal Praise,
Shall stand a Subject of Renown,
Amongst your Famous Worthies
Who have been most esteemed;
For Sir John, Sir John,
Your Honor has redeemed.
Sir John He Is for the Kings Right,
Which Rebels would destroy.
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
When with a Hide-bound Mayor
The Town was in Distraction,
Sir John leapt in the Chair,
And cured the Hall of Faction:
He to the People showed
Their Duty and Allegiance;
How to the Sacred King and Laws
They pay their due Obedience.
Sir George unto the People
A Loyal Speech did give;
But Sir John, Sir John,
Your Honor did retrieve.
Sir John is for Allegiance,
Which Rebels wou^d destroy.
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
When thou wast lost, O London,
In Faction and Sedition;
By Whigs and Zealots undone,
While they were in Commission;
When Treason, like old Nol's Brigade,
Did gallop through the Town,
And Loyalty, (a tired Jade,)
^ad cast her Rider down;
The Famous Sir George Jeffereys
Your Charter did maintain;
But Sir John, Sir John,
Restored your Fame again.
Sir John is for the Monarchy,
Which Rebels would destroy.
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
When the Mayor, with Sheriffs mounted,
Sad Jalousies contrived,
And all the Town run after,
As if the Devil driv'd,
Then Famous Sir John Moore
Thy Loyalty restored,
And Noble Sir George Jefferys,
Who did thy Acts record:
Sir George of all the Heroes
Deserves the foremost place;
But Sir John, Sir John,
Has got the Sword and Mace.
Sir John he is for Justice,
Which Rebels would destroy.
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
Sir Patience would have the Court
Submit unto the City;
Whitehall stoop to the Change,
And is not that a pity?
Sh. Bethel (save Allegiance)
Thinks nothing a Transgression:
Sir Tom rails at the Lawful Prince,
Sir Bob at the ^uccession:
While still the brave Sir George
Does their Fury interpose:
But Sir John, Sir John
Maintains the Royal Cause.
Sir John is for his Highness,
Whom Rebels would destroy.
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
Sir Patience for a Parliament,
Sh Bethel a Petition
Instead of an Address,
crammed brimful of Sedition.
Sir Tom he he is for Liberty,
Against Prerogative:
Sir Bob is for the Subjects Right,
But will no Justice give:
And brave Sir George does
All their Famous Deeds Record;
But Sir John, Sir John
Your Loyalty restored.
Sir John He Is for the Interest,
Which Rebels would destroy,
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
Sir Patience he calls for Justice,
And then the Wretch will sham us.
She Bethel he packs a Jury
Well versed in Ignoramus:
Sir Tom would hang the Tory,
And let the Whig go free:
Sir Bob would have a^ Commonwealth,
And cry down Monarchy.
While still the brave Sir George
Does all their Deeds Record;
But Sir John, Sir John
Your Loyalty restored.
Sir John He is for Justice,
Which Rebels would destroy.
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
And may such Loyal Mayors
As honest Sheriffs find;
Such Sheriffs find a Jury
Will to the King be kind;
And may the King live long,
To rule such People here;
And may he such a Lord Mayor find,
And Sheriffs every year;
That Traitors may receive
The Justice of the Laws,
While Sir John, Sir John
Maintains the Royal Cause.
Sir John is for the King still,
Whom Rebels would destroy.
Vive, Vive, Vive le Roy.
The Whig-Intelligencer: or, Sir Samuel in the Pound, for publishing Scandalous
and Seditious Letters, for which he was Flu'd 10000 l.
Tune, Hark! the thundering Cannons roar.
1.
HArk! the fatal day is come,
Fatal as the day of Doom,
For Sir Samuel there make room,
So famed for Ignoramus:
He whose Conscience could allow
Such large favors you know how,
If we do him Justice now,
The Brethren will not blame us.
2.
Stand to the Bar, and now advance,
Morden, Kendrick, Otes and Prance;
But let the Foreman lead the Dance,
The rest in course will follow;
Tilden, Kendrick, next shall come,
And with him receive their Doom,
Ten thousand Pound, at which round Sum
The Hall set up a Halloo.
Brave Sir Barnard -- on now,
Who no Main would ever allow
To lose ten thousand at a throw,
Was pleased to all men's thinking:
Ten thousand pounds! a dismal note,
Who before had giv^n his Vote,
Not to give King a Groat,
To save the Throne from sinking
4.
But yet there is a Remedy,
Before the King shall get by me,
I Will quit my darling Liberty;
Nor will I give Bail for it:
For e're the Crown shall get a Groat
In opposition to my Vote,
I^ll give 'em leave to cut my Throat
Although I lie in Goal for it.
5.
Were It for Mon -- h, I Would not grieve,
O^ Brave Russel to retrieve,
Or that Sidney yet might live,
Twice told, I Would not complain, Sir:
Nay, what is more, my whole Estate,
With my Bodkins, Spoons, and Plate,
So I might reduce the State
To a Commonwealth again, Sir.
6.
Or that Mon. were in Grace,
Or Sir Sam. in Jeffery's place,
To spit his Justice in the Face,
For acting Law and Reason,
Or that the Torys went to pot,
Or we could prove it a Sham Plot,
Or Essex did not cut his Throat;
Or Plotting were not Treason.
7.
Thus I Would freely quit my Coin;
But with Torys to combine,
Or keep the Heir in the right Line,
That Popery be in fashion,
To see the Holy Cause run down,
While Mighty York is next the Crown
And Perkin's forced to fly the Town:
Oh vile Abomination!
8.
Sooner than ^bedience owe
To their Arbitrary Law,
Or my Bail in danger draw,
For Breach of good Behavior;
I with Bethel, and the rest
Of The Birds, in Cage will make my Nest,
And keep my Fine to Plot and Feast,
Till Mon -- be in Favor.
Oats Thrash'd in the Compter, and Sack'd-up in Newgate.
Tune, Hail to the Myrtle Shades; etc.
1.
HAil to the Prince of the Plot,
All hail to the Knight of the Post;
Poor Titus! it is now thy Lot
To pay for all the Roast:
From Wine and six Dishes a day
Is sure a deplorable Fate,
To fall to the Basket, and pray
For an Alms through an Iron-grate.
2.
Titus who once was a Prince,
Now Titus a Captive in Gaol;
Titus who loved a Wench,
Or any thing wore a Tail;
Titus who made a full pass
At a following Bum in the Room,
Is clapped up himself by the Ar --,
And cannot reverse his Doom.
3.
Did Titus swear true for the King,
And is the good Doctor forsworn?
Did Titus our Freedom bring,
And Otes in Newgate mourn?
Was Titus the Light of the Town,
The Savior and Guardian proclaimed,
And now the poor Doctor thrown
To a Dungeon, in Darkness damned?
4.
But now, to declare the cause,
I Will tell you as brief as I can,
The Doctor cannot in the close
Prove Titus an honest Man:
Can Titus be just to the King,
From Treason and Treachery free,
When the Doctor hangs in a String,
For Plotting and Perjury?
5.
For Damage the Doctor has done,
Poor Titus is got in the Pound,
'Till the Doctor produce the Sum,
Full Thirty thousand pound:
If you knew on what damnable score
Such perilous words he brought forth,
You Would say his false Tongue cost more
Than ever his Head was worth.
6.
The Doctor an Evidence
Against our Great Duke did come in;
Nay, such was his Insolence,
To impeach our Gracious Queen:
For Which such Indictments are brought,
Such Actions of Scandal crowd in,
That Titus could wish, it is thought,
He were out of the Doctor's Skin.
7.
Nay, further, while Titus swore
For the Safety and Life of the King,
The Doctor began to roar,
And belched out his poisoned Sting:
The Doctor for Titus may stretch,
H'has so brought his business about,
Without the kind help of Ketch
It Is feared he will scarce get out:
8.
Through sixteen close Key-holes, it is plain,
Invisible Titus did pass,
And the Doctor got back again,
To catch a great Don at Mass:
But now they are both in the Trap,
It Is a Wager but Jack in the Fields,
(Though Titus may chance to 'scape,)
Has the Doctor fast by the heels.
A new way to Play an old Game.
Tune, Would you be a man of fashion,
1.
HAve you heard of Forty-One Sir,
When the Cause did thrive amain;
Tony's Tap did freely run Sir,
Tap did freely run Sir,
And confronted Charles his Wain?
When the Commons thought it Reason,
And a meritorious thing,
To use Villainy and Treason,
And made Charles a Glorious King.
Have you heard of Eighty-Three Sir,
When a deeper Plot was lay'n,
When the Rascals did agree Sir,
Rascals did agree Sir?
To play over the same again?
When to act their Reformation,
Naught their Fury would suffice;
But they needs must Purge the Nation,
By a Royal Sacrifice.
3.
Have you seen those Motly-Martys,
That did suffer for the Cause,
Swinging in their Tyburn Garters,
In their Tyburn-Garters,
To Atone their Sacred Laws?
If the Blunderbuss* should miss Sir,
And should fail to kill the King,
There are other means should hit Sir,
And perform the Glorious Thing.
4.
To his Name a Statue's due Sir.
Higher than the Monument,
Who this mighty Deed shall do Sir,
Mighty Deed shall do Sir,
So Great, so Good, so Excellent:
Future Ages shall him Crown Sir,
And shall bless the happy hour,
And Religion shall fall down Sir,
And adore her Savior.
5.
Thus the Boasting Bigots Canted,
(Big with hopes of Commonweal)
Thus the Priestly Villain Ranted,
Priestly Villain Ranted,
In a Drunken sit of Zeal:
But their Plots were all in vain Sir,
And their Haughty rash Career,
Signs and Wonders make it plain Sir,
Kings are Heavens peculiar Care.
The Loyal Irish-mam.
Tune, Irish Trot, or Fingaul Jigg.
1.
MY bony dear Shony,
My Crony, my Honey
Why do thou grumble
And keep in thy words so;
Sighing, and Crying,
And Groaning, and Frowning,
Ah why do thou still
Lay thy hand on thy Sword so?
What if the Traitors
Will talk of State-matters,
And rail at the King,
Without Cause or Reason:
We'll Love on, and let Business alone,
For Billing and Kissing
Will never be found Treason,
2.
Plotting, and Sotting,
And Railing, and Fooling;
Gods Nowns, with the Rabble
Is now all the Fashion:
Swearing and Tearing,
Caballing and Brawling;
By Chriest and St. Patrick
Will ruin the Nation:
He Is but a Widgeon
That talks of Religion
Since Rebels are now
The Reformers and Teachers,
Sodom's Disciple Debauches the People,
Good Heaven defend us
From more of such Preachers.
3.
Visions, Seditions,
And Railing Petitions,
The Rabble receive,
And are wondrous merry:
All can remember
The Fifth of November,
But no man the Thirtieth of January:
Talking of Treason
Without any Reason,
Will lose the poor City
Its Bountiful Charter:
The Commons haranging.
Will bring them to Hanging,
Though each Puppy hopes
To be Knight of the Garter.
4.
C -- on and P -- on
Papillion that Villain,
With Cornish and Ward
Are the Monarchy Hunters;
Rascals too low are,
To lodge in the Tower,
And scarcely are fitting
To fill up the Compter;
Bethel is ^led too,
And Toney is dead too,
Our Fate to befriend us,
Made bold to strike sirs:
Routed the Bigot,
And pulled out the Spigot,
His Fame and his Body
Now stink alike Sir.

SONGS never before in Print.
A new SONG made on the Parliaments removing from London to Oxford.
Tune, You Yorkshire Lads be merry, etc.
1.
YE London Lads be merry,
Year Parliament Friands are gene;
That made us an so sorry,
And would not let us alene:
But pecht us every Ene,
Both Papist and Protestant too;
But to Oxford they are gene,
And the Deel gang with them I trow.
2.
Our good King Charles Heven bless Him,
Protecting of Albanies Right;
Received from the House sike a Lesson,
'Twas like to have set us at Strife*
But Charles he swore by his Life,
Heed have ne mete sike a dow;
And he packt them off by this Light,
And the Deel's gang'd with them I trow.
3.
There Is Essex and Jemmy the Cully,
Were mickle too blame I dreed:
With Shaftsbury that States^Bully,
And aw the Factious Breed:
And wittal G -- good deed,
Who Pimps when his Wife does Mow,
And holds the door for a need,
But the Deel will reward him I trow
4.
Fool Thin and half-witted M -- t,
With Lo -- ce, and Slabbering K -- t;
With Gogling Flee-catching B -- don
That nere knew yet what he meant;
And St -- rd follows the scent
With Politic Armstrong and How,
And they all a Petitioning went,
And the Deel^s gang'd with them I trow.
5.
Then Heven protect Great Albany,
Guide him from Pistol and Gun,
And all the Plots of Anthony,
That Malicious Baboon:
Tho^ shamed on the Pope of Rome*
As Dugdale and Oats do avow;
But in time they will hang the Fause Loons,
And the Deel hang with them I trow.
A new SONG,
to the Tune, Ye London Lads be Merry, etc.
1.
YOu Loyal Lads be merry,
For Perkin that State Buffoon,
Despised by Whig and by Tory,
For being so Fause a Loon:
To sham the Court and the Town,
And muckle did swear and vow:
But like Prance he has changed his tone
And the D^el gang with him I trow:
2.
His Party had taught him his Lesson,
And low he did sue for Grace;
He whin'd out a doleful Confession,
How great a Traitor he was;
And begged his Pardon might pass,
For he was a Penitent now;
But he bid the Court Kiss his Arse,
And the Deel's gang'd with him I trow
3.
And once more he is got above Hatches,
And means to set up for a King;
The Politics of his Scotch Duchess,
This matter about did bring:
Ods wunds she longs to be Queen,
If Perkin and she knew how;
And yet in a Hempen-string,
They may gang to the Deel I trow.
4.
And this last mark of his Treason,
Is muckle exceeding the rest,
To aw Lads of Sense and of Reason;
T'has gained him many a Curse:
He might have been then at the worst
Drawn in for a Cully of show,
But now it is past all distrust,
That the Deels gang'd with him I true.
5
Now Heaven bless Charles the Second,
And grant him of Brutus^s mind;
And then his nene Son will be reckoned
Among the Traiterous kind,
And equal Justice will find,
By God and St. Andrew I trow;
Were he of my Daddy's nene kind,
He should gang to the Deel I true.
The Discoverers Discovered.
A new Tune,
1.
DOwn Discoverers, who so long have Plotted
With Holy shams to gull the Nation,
Both Peer and Prelacy they useless Voted,
By the Old Babes of Reformation:
Property's all their cry, Rights and Freedom,
Laws and Religion they pull down;
With old Intestine Lance to bleed them,
From Lawn-Sleev'd Prelate to Purple Throne.
2
Confound the Hypocrites, Brumighams Royal,
Who think Allegiance a Trangression;
Since to oppose the King is counted Loyal,
And to rail high at the Succession:
Monarchy's Tyrany, Justice is Cruel,
Loyalists, Tories, and Rory Knaves;
And Dagons Liberty's a Jewel,
That we again may be Brewers Slaves.
3.
Drink, drink my Boys since Plotting is in Season,
And none Loyal called but busy Brats of Faction
Rome, Rome no more thy Holy Treason,
We have those at home of more divine extraction*
We have Peers and Parsons, Smiths and Coopers too,
Carpenters and Joyners of the Reformation;
All your Brood of Cloistered Jesuits outdo
To reduce to Duty a divided Nation.
4.
Let Whigs and Zealots dable deep in Treason,
And suck from the Spiggot Heavenly Revelation*
We in the Glass will find more solid Reason,
And our hearts enflamed with nobler Inquisition,
Let them boast of honest Brumighams and true,
And with those Compose the Kirk of Separation:
We have honest Tories* Tom* Dick and Hugh,
We'll Drink on and do more Service for the Nation.
Fanatic Zeal, or a Looking-glass for the Whiggs.
Tune, A Swearing we will go, etc.
1.
WHo would not be a Tory,
When the Loyal are called so,
And a Whig is known,
To be the Nations mortal Foe;
So a Tory I will be, will be, will be,
And a Tory I will be.
2.
With little Band, Precise
Hair Presbyterian Cut;
Whigg turns up Hands and Eyes
Though Smoking hot from Slut,
So a Tory I will be, etc.
3.
Black Cap turned up with White,
With Woolfish-Neck and Face;
And Mouth with None-sense stuffed,
Speaks Whigg a man of Grace;
And a Tory I will be, etc.
4.
The Sisters go to Meetings
To meet their Gallants there;
And often mistake for my Lord,
And s^ivle out my Dear;
And a Tory I will be, etc.
5.
Example we do own,
Then Precept better is;
For Creswel she was safe,
When she lived a Private Miss.
And a Tory I will be, etc.
6.
The Whigs though never so Proud,
Sometimes have been as low;
For there are some of Note,
Have hung a Raree-Show.
And a Tory I will be, etc.
7.
These Mushrooms to have got for
Their Champion turn coat Hick,
But if the Naked Truth were known,
They Are assisted by Old N^ck
And a Tory I will be, etc.
8.
To be, and to be not
At once, is in their Power;
For when they are in they are Guilty,
But clear when out of the Tower;
9.
To carry on their Designs,
Though It contradicts their Sense;
They Will clear a Whiggish Traitor,
Against plain Evidence,
And a Tory I will be, ^c.
10.
The old Proverb does tell us,
Each Dog will have his day;
And Pill has had his too,
For which he will soundly pay;
So a Tory I will be, etc.
11.
For Bodkins and for Thimbles,
Now let your Tubsters Cant;
For your confounded tired Cause,
^ad never yet more want;
So a Tory I will be, etc
12.
For Ignoramus Toney,
Has left you in the Lurch;
And you have spent your Money,
So faite e'en^come to Church;
So a Tory I will be, etc.
13:
They are of no Religion,
Be it spoken to their Glories,
For St Peter and St. Paul,
With them both are Tories;
And a Tory I will be, etc.
14
They Are excellent Contrivers,
I wonder what they are not;
For something they can make
Of nothing, and a Plot;
15.
But now your Holy Cheat
Is known throughout the Nation;
And a Whigg is known to be
A thing quite out of Fashion;
And a Tory I will be, will be, will be,
And a Tory I will be.
A new SONG on the Old Plot.
Tune, Tangier March.
1.
LEt the Whigs Repine and all Combine,
In a damn^d Association:
Let Tony Fret, and Perkin Sweat,
That their Plot's grown out of Fashion,
Since our Royal Jemmey's come again
To spoil their Usurpation;
Rising like the splendid Sun,
To cheer the drooping Nation.
2.
You dull sham Prince, whose Impudence
To a Throne would be aspiring,
See the Rabble Crowd that made you proud,
Have ceased their loud admiring:
Curse in time those Rogues of State,
That taught you Rebel Notions;
And at the true Successors Feet
Pay all your Just Devotions.
3.
Let Bully Tom receive his Doom,
So long since due in Reason;
For Murders then, and now again
For Mutiny and Treason:
To Kidnap Cully, still has been
His business of Importance;
And now poor Perkin has drawn in,
And Rook'd out of his Fortunes.
4
In old Laws we find, the Cockold's kind
To those that do Cornute him;
Or why should Gray the Traitor play,
And to Perkin be supporting?
But the Co^comb fain would be
A Wittal to a King too;
That his Bastards may again,
Rebel for some such thing too.
5.
But of all Fools, a Pox on Tools,
That against all Law and Reason;
The Cause maintain, without the Gain
Or the Profit of the Treason:
What from Wit, or Courage, Hopes,
That Gaping Cully Brandon;
That does to Mungrel Perkin stoop,
And the Royal side Abandon.
6.
Fat Turnspit Franck with Wit so rank,
Has some excuse for starting;
Whom we despise, in time may rise,
To be Jester to King Perkin:
But for Essex, S -- d, Gray and K -- t,
Those Fools of Land and Money;
Why what the Deel was their intent
To set up Rebel Tony.
7.
The Polish Prince has some pretense,
To be Whigland Rabbles Hector;
And with Reas^n too may head the Crew,
And in time become Protector:
Since Ambition and Revenge
Are motives very moving;
But a Plague on Fools that him do bring,
To Rogues must Rule above him.
8.
Oh! ye Tapland Crew that Treason brew,
And of Tony make an Idol;
And Perkin sham with King in Name,
The King of the Golden Medall.
Curse and Damn the Black-Cabal,
That Inspired your Rebel knowledge;
E're Billa vera find you all
The Fate of Pious College.
The Whigs Downfall.
Tune, Hey Boys up go we.
NOw, now the Antichristian Crew
Shall all go down, because
Our Magistrates do well pursue,
And Execute the Laws:
Those Rascals who do always rail
Against all Law with Spite;
Would make a Law against the Law,
Great York should loose his Right.
To perfect which, they made their choice
Of Parliaments of late,
Of Members that had naught but Voice,
And Megrims in their Pate:
Wi. Williams he the Speaker was,
And is it not wondrous strange;
The Reasons plain, he told it was,
Because they would not change.
He told you Truth, nor think it strange;
He knew well their intent,
They never meant themselves to change,
But change the Government:
For now cry they the King's so poor,
He dares not with us part;
And therefore we most Loyally
Will break his Royal Heart.
The Habeas Corpus Act is past,
And so far we are safe;
He cannot Imprison us so fast,
But strait we have Relief:
He cannot deny us ought we ask,
In so much need he stands;
And before that we do Money give,
We'll tie up both his Hands.
The Presidents of Forty One,
Which were till Forty Eight;
Now our Presidents are grown,
For why they had their weight:
So weighty were they, they cut off
Our Royal Monarch's Head;
The self same Reason bids us now,
To act the self same deed.
And when we have a Martyr made
Of another Gracious King,
Then all the ^aiterous Plots we have laid,
We to perfection bring:
And to protect our Wicked Deeds,
Religion shall go down;
We^ll ^out out all the Royal Seed,
Pretenders to the ^ro^n.
Thus having Monarchy destroyed,
We'll govern by Free Will;
The Light of the Spirit shall be our guide,
Then what man can do ill:
Religion is the surest cloak
To hide our Treachery;
The Rabble we'll confine to the yoke
Pretending to set Free.
Therefore my Country men, trust not
Where Religion's the pretense;
For if you do, you will find a Plot
To destroy your Innocence:
For those who lead you to Rebel,
You Will find in the close to be,
Pure Instruments were sent from Hell
To foment Treachery.
The Downfall of the Good Old Cause.
Tune, Hey Boys up go We.
NOw the bad Old Cause is Tapt,
And the Vessel stands stooped;
The Cooper may starve for want of work,
For the Cask shall never be hoop^d:
We will burn the Association,
The Covenant, and Vow;
The public Cheat of the Nation,
Anthony, now, now, now.
No Fanatic shall bear the sway,
In Court, City, or Town;
Three good Kingdoms to Betray,
And cry the Right Line down:
Let them cry, They love the King;
Yet if they hate his Brother,
Remember Charles they Murdered,
And so they would the other.
Weavers and such like Fellows
In Pulpit daily Pret;
Like the Covenanters,
Against the Church and State:
Yet they cry, They love the King;
But their Business will discover,
Charles the first they Murdered,
And so they would the the other.
Where these Fellows go to Drink,
In City or in Town;
They Villify the Bishops,
And they cry the Stewarts down;
Still they cry, They love the King,
But their Business I Will discover;
Charles the first they Murdered,
And so they would the the other.
When the King wanted Money,
Poor Yangier to Relieve;
They cried down his Revenue,
Not a Penny they would give:
Still they cried, They love the King*
But their Business I Will discover;
Charles the first they Murdered,
And so they would the the other.
The Noble Marquess of Worcester,
And many such Brave Lord;
By the King-killing Crew,
They daily are Abhorred:
And called Evil Councello^s,
When the Truth they did discover;
And Charles the first they Murdered,
And so they would the the other.
The Papists they would kill the King*
But the Fanatics did;
Their Perjuries and Treacheries
Are not to be paralleled:
Let them cry, They love the King,
Their Faults I will discover;
Charles the first they Murdered,
And so they would the the other.
Charles the 2 d. stands on his Guard,
Like a good Politic King;
The Fanatics ought to be abhorred,
For all their Flattering:
Let them cry, They love the King,
Their Tricks I will discover;
Charles the first they Murdered,
And so they will the the other.
Now let all good Subjects be
That bear a Loyal heart;
Stand fast for the King,
And each man Act his part:
And to support his Sovereign,
Religion and the Laws,
That formerly were established,
And down with the Cursed Cause.
Jack Ke^ch's new SONG; or, a Warning to Conspirators.
Tune,
1.
I Hang, and Behead,
Until you be Dead,
O Dire!
Raw Head, Bloody Bones,
Fling Members and Stones
In the Fire.
2.
Is It not better be merry
With Claret and Sherry;
It Is Reason,
Then to have your Soul
Let out at your Poll,
For Treason*
3.
Your Brains for to puzle,
Like Walcot and Russel
Conspiring;
It Is better be Swilling,
Then Plund'ring, and Killing,
And Firing
4.
It Is better to save
One's Neck, and be brave,
Or be Sotting;
Then have a Chop with a Hatchet,
Or a Halter to stretch it
For Plotting.
5.
The Drunk, and the Brave,
Nor Traitor, nor Knave,
Can be ever
Their Deaths he defyes,
But at Tilting, he dies
Or a Feavor.
6.
To be Traitor proclaimed,
Described, and be Named,
And Money --
This it is, to be Cullies,
To the Vilest of Bullies
Old Tony.
7
To be frighted each Hour,
With Newgate, or Tower,
And Trying.
Conviction, and Sentence,
At Tyburn Repentance
And Dying.
8
Then leave Plotting, and Treason,
To the void of all Reason
And Sense;
Your Pardon, Jack cries,
It Is the Whigs I advise,
No Offense.
A SONG of the Light of the Nation turned into Darkness.
Tune, called Cavalilly-man.
COme all you Caballers and Parliament Votes,
That stickl'd for hanging and cutting of throats
Lament the misfortune of perjured Otes.
Who first must be Pillor'd, and after be Hanged.
What Devil suspected this, 5 years agon,
When I was in hopes to hang up half the Town,
I Swore against Miler, and Cursed the Crown,
But now must be Pillor'd, and after be Hang^d.
I cursed the Bishops and hanged up the Priests,
I swore my self Doctor, yet never could Preach,
But a Cant full of Blaspemy's all I could reach,
I first must be Pillor'd, and after be Hanged.
Now Otes is in the Cupboard and Manger with Colt,
The Caldron may boil me for fear I should molt,
Here I Have never a Bum for a Wheel-barrow jolt,
Yet now must be Pillor'd, and after be Hanged.
My thousand Commissions and Spanish Black-Blls,
Invisible Armies lodged upon Hills,
Such old perjured Nonsense my Narrative fills,
That I now must be Pillor^d, and after be Hanged.
My twelve Pounds a Week, I want to support*
For stinking i'ch' City and fouling the Court,
Like the Devil in Dungeon, I Am now hampered fort.
A first must be Pillor^d, and after be Hanged.
They Hang us in order the Devil knows how,
'Zounds all that e^e put ^ne paw to the Plow,
I never feared the Devil would fail me till now,
That I first must be Pillor'd, and after be Hanged.
For calling the Duke a Papist and Traitor,
I often have called the King little better,
I Am fast by the heels like a Beast in a Fetter,
I first must be Pillor'd, and after be Hanged.
I swore that the Queen would Poison the King*
That Wakeman had Moneys the Poison to bring*
When I knew in my heart there was no such thing.
I now must be Pillor'd, and after be Hanged.
I Am Resolved to be Hanged dead drunk like Hugh Peter,
If I can but have my Skin stuffed with good Liquor,
Then I shall limp to old Tapskie much quicker.
But I first must be Pillor^d, and after be hanged.
A new SGNG.
To the Tune of Young Jemmy.
1.
'TWas a foolish fancy Jemmy,
To put your Trust in Tony;
He dipped ye all in Treason,
Then humbly Died in Season;
When his Spiggot dropped out,
The Plot came about*
Far beyond your Graces Reason.
2.
'Twere fit you would mind these matters,
And help your Brother Traitors;
You left your Friends together,
To shift for one another;
Who you well all know,
Were in Portingal-Row
With a Lady and her Mother.
3.
When you went from Jerman-street Sir,
Your Friends you went to meet Sir;
Poor Betty was much grieved Sir,
You could not be believed Sir;
Had she been in the way,
You had carried the day;
But alas you were deceive'd Sir.
4.
Franck N -- t's wondrous hearty.
And Argues for the Party;
His parts are most inviting,
And lately shined in Writing;
And he has in his Face,
As much Wir as you have Grace;
Which to say the Truth is Biting.
5.
Thus Sir while you're attended,
Your troubles will be ended;
Keep Franck still for your Writer,
And P -- y for your Fighter
And to add to your sway,
Turn ^ -- r away,
^d make poor Ha -- t fright her.
6.
(...) For -- s have a place too,
about your mighty Grace too;
^h -- ton has great reason
(...) look out sharp in Season,
(...) Gibbons his place
(...) a Nobler Race;
(...) ^ake Sir R -- d M-n.
7.
(...) he has more wit than any
^o turn and wind the Penny;
H^l lie beyond all measure,
(...) Pimping is his Pleasure;
A^ he is for his part,
^ore a Rogue in his Heart,
T^ Gray or Armstrong either.
8.
May Friends like these protect ye,
And only these respect ye;
May Halters, Chains and Fetters,
Crown all Rebellious Traitors;
Then in a short space
I Will wait on your Grace,
With a List of all your Creatures.
Oates's Bug -- Bug -- Boarding-School, at Camberwell.
Tune, Lord Russel's Farewell.
ROwse, Rowse my lazy Mirmidons,
And muster up our Tribe;
See how the Factious Fancies stand,
To trim or cross the Tide:
Invite 'em to my Vaulting School,
The Saints for freedom tell;
How they may live without Control,
With me at Camberwell.
There all Provision shall be made
To entertain the best,
Old Mother Creswel of our Trade,
For to rub down our Guests;
Three hundred of the briskest Dames,
In Park or Field e're fell:
Whose Am^rous Eyes shall charm the flames
Of The Saints at Camberwell.
For my own spending I will keep
Of Boys three hundred more,
They are to my Appetite, more sweet
Then Bawd or Bucksom Whore:
The Turks Seraglio we'll revive,
He sinks so fast for Hell:
Our English Turks may Plot and thrive,
With me at Camberwell.
That Sacred place shall tempt his Grace,
Once more from Friends to fall:
He Will leave these new-fond Sweets to trace
Both Moor-Park and Whitehall;
For Gray and Tom ^t shall be their home,
To Kiss Secure and Dwell;
Where every Lass shall hug his Grace,
^n my sweet Camberwell.
^ence shall from the Cock-loft creep,
and here have free-Access:
(...) ^ear and Drink to Whore and Sleep,
^h Virtues we profess;
(...) his Pots of Venison,
(...) ^ook for Priests, may sell:
^ber-Necklaces make known
(...) Saints at Camberwell.
(...) may meet his Mistress here,
^times Sir Robert's Wife;
^ree from care in joys may share,
^ay prolong ones Life:
^daring Gibbet before my Gate,
(...) tear him down to Rights;
(...) ^se no Emblems of ill Fate,
^ll fright our Amorous Nights.
Ar^ and Lob, and Ferguson,
^d all Absconding Saints;
Man ^afely to their Savior come,
^d taste our sweet Content:
Ou^ ^rgest Rooms to frisk and sport,
^s round, and Curtains drawn;
The Life and Scene of Venus Court,
Excelling Englands Throne.
All naked round the Room we'll Dance,
Fine Limbs and Shapes to show:
In pairs by Candlelight advance,
In dazeling postures go:
Here every Man obtains his Choice,
Sister, Madam, or Nell:
We'll have Papillion and Duboys,
To my sweet Camberwell.
The Royal Admiral, an excellent new SONG on His Illustrious Highness the Duke
of York His ^ing confirmed High-Admiral of England.
1.
FAction and Folly (alas!) will deceiv^ you,
The Loyal man still the best Subject d^ ^ve;
Treason of Reason (poor Whig) will berea^ (...);
You cannot be blessed, till this Curse yo^ (...).
Charles our great Monarch, when Heaven di^ ^tore
With His Royal Brother, safe on our S^ Him.
Ordained us, that we next our King shou^ ^re
Then Johnson play the Apostate no mo^ ^im,
2.
Clayton may fret, and bring Vows of Obedience
To Ferguson, Baxter, to Curtis and Care;
Patience approach with pretended Allegiance
To his Sovereign Lord, yet oppose the right Heir
Can he pretend to be Honest or Loyal,
Nay though he late at Westminster swore,
And yet the next day will (like Perkin) deny all,
Whate^r he said, or swore to before?
3.
Let Trenchard and Hambden stir up a Commotion,
Their Plotting and Voting will prosper no more;
Now Gallant Jemmy commands on the Ocean,
And mighty Charles keeps them in awe on the Shore.
Let Lobb and Ferguson preach up Sedition
At Coffee house, Conventicle, Cabal,
Now Jefferys is Justice, and York in Commission,
Their Scandal and Plots shall pay for 'em all.
4.
Jemmy the Valiant, the Champion Royal,
His own and the Monarchs Rivals withstood;
The bane and the terror of all the Disloyal,
Who spilt the late Martyr's, and sought for His Blood
Jemmy who quelled the proud Foe on the Ocean,
And reigned the sole Conqueror over the Main
To this brave Hero let us all pay Devotion,
Since He is Englands Admiral again.
5.
York our great Adm'ral, the Oceans Defender,
The Joy of his Friends, and the Dread of His Foes,
The lawful Successor, what Bastard-Pretender
(Whom Heaven the true Heir has ordained) dare ^ppose?
(...) who taught the Scotch Rebels Allegiance,
And made the High Dutch his Standard to lower,
In time will reduce the proud Cit to Obedience,
And make the false Whig fall down and adore.
6.
Let Bethel and Hambden lie shopt for their Treason,
And for the new Factions express their old Zeal;
Let false Sir Samuel rail on without reason,
And every night dream of a new Commonweal;
Plotters be brought with their Plots to confusion,
While Charles sways the Shore, and York the vast Main.
Till all are confounded who sought the Exclusion,
Then England will be old England again.
7.
Then to our Monarch let us quaff off a Bumper,
And next to our Sovereign, the Prince of the Flood;
The Ax and the Gibbet crown every Rumper,
Who York in the lawful Succession withstood.
May Rumbold, Gray, Armstrong, with Sidney be Sainted
And Titus^s long Tongue, so often forsworn.
May his short Neck stretch for it when Oats is attainted.
And wish with the World he had never been born.
Loyalty respected, and Faction confounded.
To a Pleasant New Tune.
1.
LEt Cannons roar from Sea to Shore,
and Trumpets sound Triumphantly;
We'll fair in Wealth while we drink a Health
To the High Born Prince of Albany.
Of Albany, of Albany,
To the High Born Prince of Albany:
We'll fair in Wealth, while we drink a Health
To the High Born Prince of Albany.
2.
He Is the Son of Scotlands womb,
Though his Nativity be Thames;
He Is of the Glorious Martyr Sprung,
And bears the Name of good King James.
Of Albany, etc.
3.
Our Princes and our Nobles all
Do not our Loyalty Disgrace:
Nor no enormity at all
Nor Bastardize the Royal Race,
Of Albany, etc.
4.
Let Hagar and her Birth be gone,
Her Bottle on her Shoulder be;
For Sarah said unto her Son,
He shall not be an Heir with thee.
An Heir with thee, an Heir with thee,
He shall no be an Heir with thee;
For Sarah said unto her Son,
He shall be an Heir with thee.
5.
Put all these Fancies quite away,
And press down that Egyptian pride;
Before he wants a Seigniory,
We'll place him King on Yarrow side,
On Yarrow side, on Yarrow side,
We'll place him King on Yarrow side,
Before he wants a Seigniory,
We'll place him King on Yarrow side
6.
I know not why he should be King,
Unless for Mustering of the Whiggs:
No wonder, though they act the thing,
He spared them well at Bothwell-Brigs.
On Yarrow side, etc.
6.
So Nobly he did act his part,
By sparing these Rebellious Clowns;
That he came down and let a Fart,
And so marched back with his Dragoons,
With his Dragoons, with his Dragoons,
And so marched back with his Dragoons,
That he came down and let a Fart,
And so marched back with his Dragoons.
The Whiggs Disappointment upon their intended Feast.
Tune, Cook Laurel.
1.
HAve you heard of a Festival Convent of late,
Composed of a pack of Notorious Dissenters,
Appointed by Tickets in Whigland to meet,
To Sign and to Seal Covenanted Indentures.
2.
The day was appoited, and all things prepared
In order thereto, by the Sages of the Nation,
And a Reverend Sermon was there to be heard,
T'exhort 'em to the Oath of Association.
3.
All sorts of Tradesmen were bid to be there,
The Lords, Abhorrers, and Commoners too,
But the Cooper before all was to take the Chair,
To set forth the matter as well he knew how.
4
The Godly Gown-man all Chained and Fur'd,
Two Shrieves, and the Deel knows what of the Rabble;
Invited on purpose, and set on, and Spurred,
To make a Confusion worse than old Babel.
5.
The chief of the Feast was a Fop and a Mouth,
Buy'd up by the City Cooper and Player;
Whose Name they would extended from North to South
By the trick of a Black-Box to make him an Heir.
6.
For down into Durham an Envoy was sent,
Amongst the Chief, the Northern Clergies,
To find out a Writing to that very intent:
Who had thirty good Guineys to bear his Charges.
7.
The Reverend Titus was Chaplain to the Feast,
Brim-full of Plots with Oaths to maintain them;
The Deel could afford them no such Guest,
Amongst all his damned Crew to entertain them.
8.
Next in came Janway, Curtis, Vile and Care,
With his Packets of Lies thrust under his A^m,
Then Don Danger^eldo more subtle by far,
Then poor Mother Cellier, that acted no harm,
9.
All sorts of Informers were bid to be there,
And the damned Ignoramus ^urors too,
To participate of this Festival Cheer,
By way of Thanksgiving for what they did do.
10.
Some hundreds more were to be at the Feast;
And all things thereunto were fitted,
But in steps an Order which forestalled the Guests,
Disbanding the Cooks e're the meat was half spitted
11.
Tag, Rag, and Long-tail were all to come in,
To sit at this King of Polands Table,
The Feast I conceive else was not worth a Pin,
Without the consent of an Insolent Rabble.
12.
What Pining and Fretting, and Fuming was there,
When all the good Creatures were laid aside,
'T would make a Saint both to stamp and stare,
To see such a Zealous Assembly decry^d.
13.
Here now the Nation was thus settled,
And all things be brought to a better Cue,
Here a new Government was to be settled,
And the Deel knows what besides they would do
14.
Some think it was like to the Oxford stroke,
Which was well, being given in Season*
And some think they are under a burthens^m yoke,
'Cause they may not Assemble for sedition (...) treason
15.
Some hold it not prudently Acted at all,
To check an Assembly of so great an Intention,
Who studied and aimed at the Tory's downfall,
In raising the Whigs by a new Invention.
16.
Some say they were nettled, and galled within,
To see our great York embraced by the City,
If that be the Cause on it we care not a Pin,
Let them hang up each other, and so ends my Dity.
The West-Country-man's SONG at a Wedding.
1.
UDs hearty Wounds, I'se not to Plowing, not I Sir,
Because I hear there is such brave doings hard by Sir,
Thomas the Minstrel, he is gone twinkling before Sir
And they talk there will be two or three more Sir
Who the Rat can mind either Byard or Ball Sir,
Or any thing at all Sir,
For thinking of Drinking in the Hall Sir,
E'gad not I, let Master fret it and storm it,
I am resolved, I Am sure there can be no harm in it
Who would lose the zight of the Lasses and Pages,
And pretty little Sue, so true when she ever engages
E'gad not I, I Would rather lose all my Wages.
2.
There Is my Lord has got the curiourest Daughter,
Look but on her, and she will make the Chops on the water,
This is the day the Ladies are all about her,
Zome to Veed her, zome to Dress her, and clout her,
Ods bud, she is grown the veatest, the neatest, the sweetest,
The pretty'st little Rogue, and all men do say the discreetest,
There Is never a Girl that wears a Head in the Nation
But must give place, since Mrs. Betty's Creation,
She Is zo good, zo witty, zo pretty to please ye;
Zo charitably kind, zo courteous and loving and easy,
That I'se be bound to make a Maid of my Mother,
If London Town can e're send down such another
3.
Next my Lady in all her Gallant Apparel,
I'ze not forget the thundering thumping Barrel,
There Is such drink, the strongest head cannot bear it
'Twill make a Vool of Zack or Whit-wine or Claret
And zuch plenty that 20 or 30 good Vellows,
May tipple off their Cups until they lie down on their Pillows;
Then hit off thy Vrock and don't stand scratching thy Head so,
For thither I Will go, Ods Wunds because I Have zed so
The Diet of Cowley.
NOw by my Love; the greatest Oath that is;
None loves you half so well as I,
I do not ask your Love for this,
Bu^ for Heaven's believe me, or I die;
No servant e're but did deserve,
His Master should believe that he does serve;
And I Will ask no more Wages though I starve.
2.
It Is no Luxuri^u Diet this, and sure,
I cannot by it too lusty prove.
Yet shall it willingly endure;
I^ ^ can but keep together Life and Love,
Being your Prisoner and your Slave;
I do not Feasts or Banquets love to have,
A little Bread and Water's all I crave.
3.
On a sigh of pity, I a year can live,
One Tear will keep me 20 at least,
Fifty, a gentle look will give;
An 100 one, one kind word I Will Feast:
A 1000, more added be
If you an Inclination have for me,
And all beyond is vast Eternity.
A Prophetical Catch.
To the Tune, Of the merry Christ-Church-Bells.
1.
OH! the Plot Discoverers,
Oats, Bedloe, Dugdale, Prance!
They are such Crafty Dogs,
That none but Scroggs
Can feage them Cuningly, cunningly.
2.
Oh! the cursed damned sham Plot,
Which some believe, but more do not,
Because the Laws
Have found such Flaws,
In them of all our Ills, the Cause.
3.
Bedlow, they say, the other day at a Play,
For his Impudence was banged;
But the Plot will not
E're be forgot,
Till Oats and all are hanged.
The Courageous Loyallists; Or, A Health to the Royal Family
Tune, Burton-hall.
1.
DRown Melanchally
in a Glass of Wine;
We will be jolly,
let the Miser pine:
Boys drink about,
we'll make the Tavern roar,
When the Bumper's out,
we'll call again for more:
It makes good Blood
to run within our Veins,
It puts good reason also
in our Brains:
He that will deny it,
hanged let him be,
Here Is to all
the Royal Progeny.
2.
Boys we'll be merry,
whatsoever ensue,
Drink Sack and Sherry.
till the Sky looks blew;
Let the Whiggs lament,
and whiningly complain,
We with one consent,
drink to the Royal Train;
Heavens bless Great Charles,
and the Duke of York,
All the Lords and Earls,
and every Royal Spark;
Down with every Factious,
shamming, whining Crew,
Give them Rope and Hanging,
since it is their due.
3.
Drawer bring us Wine,
fill the other Bowl,
Let us lose no time,
for he is an honest Soul
That does love his Prince,
and the ancient Laws,
He is a man of Sense,
he shall have our Applause;
As for mighty Charles,
his Renowned Name,
Let it be Recorded
in the Books of Fame:
But he that will deny
Allegiance to the King,
Hang him* let him die,
and in a Halter swing:
4.
Brave Noble Sions,
be you stout and true,
Stand in Defiance
of the Rabble Crew;
They that designed
our Laws to undermine,
We will make them fly,
like Chaff before the Wind:
Those that did consent,
yielding to allow,
Those that did invent
the Association Vow,
To conceal their Treason,
hang 'um let them swing,
Here Is a Health to Charles,
the most Renowned King.
5
Now sure the Whigs,
they will no more Rebel,
Old Cromwell's Piggs
that sucked up the swill;
Their hopes are drowned,
as we plainly see,
Some were counfounded
in their Villainy;
Tommy he is fled,
Tony he is Dead.
Some of them were Hanged,
others lost their Had*
Ketch in conclusion
paid them their Arrears,
Since this Confusion
how they hang their Ears!
6.
Then learn to bow,
and in Obedience stand,
To Caesar now
the Glory of the Land,
None can convince,
for what I speak is true,
He is a Prince
of love and pity too:
Those that are Loyal,
they are perfect free,
There Is no denial
of their Liberty;
Then true hearts be merry,
make the Tavern ring,
Fling up your Caps,
and cry, God Save the KING.
A new SONG,
to an Old Tune, Tom of Bedlam.
MAke room for an Honest Red-Coat,
(And that you will says a wonder:)
The Gun, and the Blade,
Are his Tools, -- and his Trade,
Is for Pay, to Kill, and Plunder.
Then away with the Laws,
And the Good old Cause,
Never talk of the Rump, or the Charter,
It Is the Cash does the Feat,
All the rest's but a Cheat,
Without that there is no Faith, nor Quarter.
It Is the mark of our Coin, GOD WITH US,
And the Grace of our Lord goes along with it,
When the Georges are flown,
Then the Cause goes down,
For the Lord is departed from it.
Then away, etc.
For Rome, or for Geneva,
For the Table, or the Altar,
This spawn of a Vote,
He cares not a Groat --
For the Pence, he is your Dog in a Halter.
Then away, etc.
Though the Name of King, or Bishop,
To Nostrils pure may be Loathsome,
Yet many there are,
That agree with the Mayor,
That their Lands are wondrous toothsom.
Then away, etc.
When our Masters are Poor, we leave 'em,
It Is the Golden Calf we bow to:
We Kill, and we slay,
No^ for Conscience, but Pay;
Give us That, we'll fight for you too.
Then away, etc.
'Twas that first turned the King out;
The Lords next; then the Commons:
'Twas that kept up Noll,
Till the Devil fetched his Soul;
And then it set the Bum on's.
Then away, etc.
Drunken Dick was a Lame Protector,
And Fleetwood a Backslider:
These we served as the rest,
But the City's the Beast
That will never cast her Rider.
Then away, etc.
When the Mayor holds the Stirrup,
And the Shrieves cry, God save your Honors:
Then it is but a Jump,
And up goes the Rump,
That will spur to the Devil upon us.
Then away, etc.
And now for a fling at your Thimbles,
Your Bodkins, Kings, and Whistles,
In truck for your Toys
We'll sit you with Boys:
It Is the Doctrine of Hugh Peter's, To the Butchers Wife

Then away, etc.
When your Plate is gone, and your Jewels,
You must be next entreated,
To part with your Bags,
And strip you to Rags,
And yet not think you are cheated.
Then away etc.
The truth is, the Town deserves it;
It Is a Brainless, Heartless Monsier:
As a Club they may Bawl,
Or Declare at their Hall,
And yet a^ push not one stir.
Then away, etc.
Sir Arthur vowed h^'ll treat 'em,
Far worse than the men of Chester:
He^s Bold; now they are Cowed,
But he was nothing so Loud
When he lay in the ditch at Lester.
Then away, etc.
The Lord ha^h left John Lambert,
And the Spirit, Feak's Anointed,
But why oh Lord,
Have thou sheat^ed thy Sword?
Lo, thy Saints are disappointed*
Then away, etc.
Though Sir Henry be departed:
Sir John makes good the place now,
And to help out the work
Of the Glorious Kirk,
Our Brethren march apace too,
Then away, etc.
While Divines, and States men wrangle,
Let the Rump-ridden Nation bite on it,
There are none but we
That are sure to go free,
For the Souldies's still in the right on it.
Then away, etc.
If our Masters w'ont supply us
With Money, Food and Clothing:
Let the State look to it,
We'll find one that will do it,
Let him Live, -- we'll not damn for nothing,
Then away with the Laws,
And the Good old Cause,
Never talk of the Rump, or the Charter,
It Is the Cash does the feat,
All the rest's but a Cheat,
Without That there is no Faith nor Quarter.
Oats well Thrash'd, being a Dialogue between a Country Farmer, and his man
Jack.
Tune, Which no body can deny. Repeat the burden twice.
Jack. OUr Oats, last week not worth a Groat,
Have, Sir, (which all do wonder at)
Abomination thrived of late;
Which no Body can deny, Sir,

Master. Be all the Tribe of Oats Accursed,
And the Old Dotard too, that first
The Brat within his Hedges nursed,
And sowed such Wicked seed, Boy.

Jack. Good Master, pray your Fury stop;
For, as the Saying is, I hope,
You Will shortly shortly see a Doctor-Crop,
And many more besides, Sir.

Master. A Curse on every thing, that is called Oats;
Both Old and Young, both Black and White Oats,
Both Long and Short, both Light and Tite Oats:
I hate the Vip'rous Seed, Boy.

Jack. Your Oats, now Ripe, Sir, do appear;
For they begin to hang the Ear;
The Time of Cu^ting them draws near,
If my Skill fails me not, Sir.

Master. Then down with 'em, and all their Train;
Let not a Blade of them remain,
Our poor Land to infect again;
It Is pity one should escape, Boy.

Jack. Where shall I reek them, (the Sithe^s Edge
They Have felt) in Barn, or under Hedge?
For they are fit for Cart, or Sledge,
And a Roping only want, Sir.

Master. Even if thou will, lodge them in thy Barn;
For they shall never come amongst my Corn;
Or Cart them, if thou will, to Tyburn;
And there too Truss them up, B^y.

Jack. The are housed, Sir; But the Trash all Sense
Exceeds, that is in 'em: By what Means,
This Filthy Oats shall we e're cleanse?
From all that Roguish Stuff, Sir?

Master. --

Jack. Go, get a pack of Sturdy Louts,
And let them lustily Thresh their Coats;
Too well you cannot Thresh Damned Oats;
Which no body can deny, Boy.

Jack They Are thresh'd, and wimb'd and made as clean,
As hands can do it; but all in vain:
For still Base Oats behind remain:
What shall we do with 'em, Sir?

Master. Let 'em divided be like Martyrs
Of Royal Justice) into Quarters;
Then ground in Mill, or brayed in Mortars:
So Oats ought to be served, Boy.

Jack. How shall I use the Straw? It Is good
Only to cast out into the Road,
And under Foot to Dung be tr^d;
And there to lie and r^t, Sir,

Master. Burned, like an Here^ick, in Flame;
And Expiate so our Guilt and Shame,
For giving Long-Tail'd Oats such Fame,
Abhorred by all but us, Boy.
Beyond Sea the are kick't out of Door;
But held with us Here in such Store,
That Oats we even do Adore:
But Cursed be Oats, say I, Boy

Jack. What shall we now at last, Sir, do
With this Same Paultry Oats, by You
So hated, and admired by few;
And those both Knaves and Fools, Sir.

Master. Let Oats be cast to Ravenous Hogs,
Or ground for Meat for Hungry Dogs;
And no where Sown, but in deep Bogs,
Or Bottom of a Jakes, Boy.
Or to the Fowls of the Air be thrown,
By Vermin to be preyed upon;
Or out of the World by Whirlwinds blown,
To the Devil's Arse of Peak, Boy.
Let every Tongue, and Tail in the Isle
Of Man, of Bird, of Beast, defile
Oats so Detestable, Oats so Vile;
And 'twill be so, thou wilt see, Boy.
Or if to Popery thou incline,
Thou shall have Oats incag'd in Shrine,
And show about that Trash Divine*
And this will get thee Pence, Boy.

Jack Let it, good Master, pray be so,
And I Will amongst the Papists go,
with my O raree Shite, and my O brave Show,
Till I a Pension get, Sir.
And then I Will Coach it up and down,
From Country, and from Town to Town,
Till over the World I^ve made Oats known,
For a very Rogue in Grain, Sir.

The Tories Triumph; or, the Point well weathered.
To a New Theater Tune,
SOme say, the Papists had a Plot,
Against the Church and Crown;
But be it so, or be it not,
The King must please the Town.
The Papists take Tyburn by turns,
To please the City Gulls;
It Is strange, that they who all wear Horns,
Should fear the Popish Bulls
2.
The House of Commons blow the Coals,
The Nation to dissettle;
And like two Tinkers, make two Holes
To mend one in a Kettle:
Or else* What needs that precious Vote,
That if the King should Fall
By Pagan, or Phanatick Plot,
The Pope must pay for all?
3.
Our Royal James of Princely Race,
And High-Illustrious Fame,
Was not thought fit by Commons base,
To follow Charles's Waine:
But let that House of Office know,
When they have Sowed their Leaven,
He shall Succeed though they say no,
By all the Laws of Heaven.
4.
Old Cavaliers for Loyalty
They straight Clapped up for Treason,
In hopes to bring in Anarchy,
Against Justice, Sense and Reason.
Brave Hallifax and Feversham,
Brave Worster, Just and Wise,
They did Vote down, as dangerous Men,
That they themselves might Rise.
5.
But Oh! That Lord in Leistershire,
Turned Catchpole, though too late:
It Is b^tter ^riests in Prison were,
Then Burns should lose their Trade.
For Priest poor Waller never sought,
But where Was Golden Crosses;
His Mirmidons went ^nacks, it is That
In all the Owners Losses.
6.
The Doctor he has bid Farewell
To Jesus, and the Court;
And Tony's Tap runs fla^ and dull,
Makes Catch in hopes of Sport.
Blew Protestants can make no work,
Unless like Hungary,
They for Religion Join the Turk,
For Christian Liberty
Five Years Sham Plots Discovered in one True one.
To the Tune of, -- I told young Jenny, etc.
NOw Innocent Blood's almost forgot,
We have found the Original Ground of the
Now every Moon-blind Rebel may know, Plot
That Providence sees our Actions below.
NoW Oats for Pegs, may pack up his Awls,
And there inform his Master;
To furnish Rooms, make fire in the Halls
For Company that comes after.
These are not like our Plots of Old,
When Evidence swore for Silver and Gold.
There are no Armies under Ground,
No Sha^ Magazines that never were found,
No Spanish Pilgrims, and Black-Bills,
But open professed Traitors;
Where Perjury spares, the Sword it kills,
These are our Saint-like Satyrs.
These are the Blades, detected by Laws,
In Contempt of Justice decide it with blows
These are the Bloodhounds of our Age,
That brought our late Monarch upon the Stage,
Yet these more Barbarous Bruits of ours,
Would mu^ther both King and's Brother,
And ^ay the Guilt at innocent doors,
And still continue the Murder.
From thence the Sacrifice begins,
To Massacre others for their own sins:
And this has been the Plots support,
First made in the City, then forced on the Court.
But now the Mysteries brought to light,
True Innocence is Protection,
Surprising Rebels dare not fight,
Their Souls are Imperfections.
If they had Butchered the Royal Line,
To Murder its Friends they were to Join,
The like was never on Record
In the wide Wilderness of the World;
To Rob the Kingdom of all that is Good,
And none but Rebels Surviving,
To Lord it over three Nations in Blood;
Each to be an Oliver striving.
The Saddle is now on the Right ^orse,
The Whiggs must mount for Tyburn in Course.
For these can be no false Alarms,
We have their Confession the Men and their Arms,
Makes Catch perceive his Harvest is near
He swears if his Horse do not fail him,
He Will not take a thousand Pound this year,
For what his Trade may avail him.
On the Throat-cutter of Jack-a-napes-lane.
Tune, Hang sorrow, cast away care.
1.
THere is an old story
That Is much to the glory
Of one who was called Sophyrus,
Whose Fears may be read,
Though the man be dead,
By any that are desirous.
2.
This man had a Nose
(As you may suppose)
In the middle of his face;
But he cut it off clear,
Like a brave Cavalier,
To get the King's good grace.
3.
The manner is known,
So we'll let that alone:
Yet by the way you must note,
Though he slashed his face
In every place,
He had a great care of his Throat.
4.
Nor will any man dare
This Wight to compare
With an Hero that I can name;
Who, by cutting his Throat,
Grew a man of great note,
And purchased eternal Fame.
5.
Sophyrus did well;
But He does excel,
If he be but right understood:
For it is a plain case
As the Nose on ones Face,
It was done for the Peoples good.
6.
The design was brave,
The People to save
By letting his own Throat bleed;
But the Fiend that repines
At all good Designs,
Did hinder it to succeed.
7.
For his hand being up
To spil the last Drop
Of the Peoples saving Blood,
He made him flinch
At the other Inch,
And so prevented the Good.
8.
So he uses his Throat
For the People to Vote;
Yet some are so wicked, to hope
This obliging Knife
(Though it then spared his Life)
Has marked a fair place for the Rope.
9.
Now, whoever bears spleen
To the King or the Queen,
Or to James the Duke of York,
He shall have my Vote
For cutting his Throat,
Provided he will perfect the Work.
The Plotting-Cards revived; or, The new Game at Forty-One.
Tune, I Will tell thee, Dick, etc.
1.
COme, cut again; the Game's not done,
Though strangely yet the Cards have run,
As if they packed had been:
Most likely are to lose, and say
They know not what is next best to play,
Such shuffling never was seen.
2.
Look well (my Masters) to your hits,
And have about you all your wits,
For high the Play does run;
Three Kingdoms now at stake do lie,
And Rooks all hocus-tricks do try,
That ye may be undone.
3.
On Clubs and Spades some wholly bett*
For they the most are like to get.
Whilst Hearts in vain contest;
And Diamonds too, (unto their cost
That have them) sure are to be lost,
The blackest Cards are best.
4.
God bless all Kings and Queens, though now
The best Coat-Cards, (the Lord knows how)
At this prepostrous Game,
Are like all to commanded be,
And trumpt with all their Royalty,
By every Knavish Pam --
5.
So Hewson blind (though he be dead)
Alive was by blind Fortune led,
And still did winning go;
And ever since we find, that He
Sweeps all with his Effigy,
The great Pamphilio.
6.
Nay, Trays and Duces, which were deemed
The basest Cards, are now esteemed
Prime ones, to win the day:
So that, (you see) to gain the Prize,
Poor Kings and Queens you must despise,
And Honors throw away.
7.
Thus the best Cards are now the worst,
And what was last is become first,
No wonder nowadays:
The Nation topsy turvey lies,
And (as 'twere pleased with Contraries)
At losing Load'em plays.
The Second Part.
1.
THis is like some Utopian Game,
Where Servant-Maids control their Dame,
And Kings are Subjects made;
Felons their Judges do indict,
And He a Traitor is downright
Who falsely is betrayed!
2.
A Dunce who never took Degrees,
But such as lead to Villainies,
A DOCTOR is most sound;
He who, to furnish his own wants,
Can seize Gold-Cross, or Silver-Saints,
A JUSTICE is renowned.
3.
Who Horse to Battle never led,
But has with many Horses fled
Out of his Neighbors Field,
A CAPTAIN is; and with his Word
Kills more than with his duller Sword
He ever made to yield.
4.
A Villain who can cheat his Lord,
Gets Chains of Gold instead of Cord,
And is from Prison freed:
For Him who says he Murdered has,
A Pardon both for That does pass,
And all that ever he did.
5.
Who for foul Crimes and Forgeries
Has worn the Yoke of Pillories,
And has been whipped about;
If he but add new Perjury,
He wipes off past Iniquity,
And speaks Truth without doubt.
6.
He that had rather choose to die,
Than to redeem his Life with Lie,
Is the only perjured R^gue:
And They who damn themselves to live,
Sure signs of their Probation give,
For they are the Saints in vogue.
7.
Then play away, (good Countryman)
What hand's the best is now most-plain,
And boldly thou may stake:
A Pack of KNAVES together get,
And never doubt to win the Set,
For They the Voll will make.
A Song upon Information.
Tune, Conventicles are grown so rief.
1.
INforming of late's a notable Trade;
For he that his Neighbor intends to invade,
May pack him to Tyburn, (no more's to be said)
Such Power has Information.
Be Good, and be Just, and fight for your King,
Or stand for your Countries Honor,
You're sure by precise Information to swing,
Such Spells she has got upon her.
2.
To Six hundred and sixty, from Forty-one,
She left not a Bishop or Clergyman,
But compelled both Church and State to run,
By the strength of the Nonconformist.
The Dean and Chapter, Scepter and Crown,
(The Lords and Commons snarling)
By blessed Information came tumbling down,
Fair Fruits of an overlong parling.
3.
'Twas This that summoned the Bodk^ns all,
The Th^mbles and Spoons to the City-hall,
When Saint Hugh to the Babes of Grace did call,
To prop up the Cause that was sinking:
This made the Cobbler take the Sword,
The Pedlar and the Weaver;
By the power of the Spirit, and not by the Word,
Made the Tinker wear Cloak and Beaver.
4.
It Is Information from Valadolid
Makes Jesuits, Friars and Monks to bleed,
Occapitates Lords; and what not (indeed)
Does such damnable Information?
It Cities burns, and sticks not to boast,
Without any mincing or scruple,
Of Forty Thousand Black-Bills by the Post,
Brought in with the Devil's Pupil.
5.
This Imp with her Jealousies and Fears
Puts all men together by the ears,
Strikes at Religion, and Kingdoms tears,
By Voting against the BROTHER.
This makes Abhorrers, makes Lords Protest,
They know not why, nor wherefore:
This strikes at Succession, but aims at the rest;
Pray look about you therefore
6.
This raises Armies in the Air,
Imagining more than you need have to fear;
Keeps Horse underground, and Arms to tear
The Cities and Towns in sunder.
It Is this made the Knight to Newark run,
With his Fidus Acates behind him;
Who brought for the Father one more like the Son,
The Devil and Zeal did so blind him.
7.
It whips, it strips, it hangs, and draws;
It Pillories also without any cause,
By falsely Informing the Judges and Laws,
With a trick from Salamanca;
This hurly-burlies all the Town,
Makes Smith and Harris prattle;
Who spare neither Cassock, Cloak, nor Gown,
In their paltry Tittle-tatile.
8.
It Is Information affrights us all;
By Information we rise and fall:
Without Information there is no PLOT at all;
And all is but Information.
That Pickering stood in the Park with a Gun,
And Godfrey by Berry was strangled;
'Twas by Information such stories begun,
Which the Nation so much have entangl'd.
A Song on the Popish Plot, by a Lady of Quality.
Tune, Packington's Pound
1.
SInce counterfeit ^lots have affected this Age,
Being acted by Fools, and contrived by the Sage;
In City, nor Suburbs, no man can be found,
But frighted with Fireballs, their heads turned round.
From Pulpit to Pot
They talked of a Plot,
Till their Brains were enslaved, and each man turned Sot;
But let us to Reason and Justice repair,
And this Popish B^gbear will fly into Air.
2
A Politic Statesman, of Body unsound,
Who once in a Tree, with the Rabble set round,
Run Monarchy down with Fanatic Rage,
And preached up Rebellion in that credulous Age;
He now is at work
With the Devil and Turk,
Pretending a Plot, under which he does lurk,
To humble the Mitre, wh^le he squints at the Crown,
Till fairly and squarely he pulls them down.
3.
He had found out an Instrument fit for the Devil,
Whose mind had been trained up to all that was evil*
His Fortune sunk low, and detested by many,
Kicked out at St. Omers, not pitied by any:
Some whisperers fixed him
Upon this Design,
And with promised Reward did him countermine*
Though his Tale was ill told, it served to give fire;
Despised by the Wise, whilst Fools did admire.
4.
The next that appeared, was a foolhardy Knave,
Who'd plied the Highways, and to Vice was a Slave;
Being fed out of Basket, in Prison forlorn,
No wonder that Money should make him forsworn:
He boldly dares swear
What men tremble to hear,
And learns a false Lesson without any Fear;
For when he is out, there is one that is in's place
Relieves his invention, and quickens his pace.
5.
In a Country Prison another was found,
Who had cheated his Lord of One thousand Pound;
He was freed from his Fetters, to swear and inform,
Which very courageously he did perform:
To avoid future strife,
He takes away Life,
To save poor Protestants from Popish Knife:
Which only has edge to cut a Rogue's ears,
For abusing the People with needless Fears.
6.
Another starts up, and tells a false Tale,
Which strait he revoked, his courage frail:
But, to fortify one that needs his Aid,
(Being tempted by Money, which much does persuade)
He swore he knew all
That contrived the fall
Of one, who that day was seen near to White Hall;
Where he by an Officer's powerful breath
More l^kely by far received his death.
7.
A Gown-man most grave, with Fanatical Form,
With his scribbling wit does blow up this storm;
For moth-eaten Records he worships the Devil,
Being now lodged at Court, he must become civil.
He hunts all about,
And makes a great Rout,
To find some o^d Prophecy to help him out;
But his Friend that was housed with him at Foxhall,
Being joined with his Master, still strengthens 'em all*
1.
Then comes a cracked Merchant, with his shallow Brain,
Who first did lead up this stigmatized Train:
He since is grown useless, his Skill being small;
Yet at a dead lift he is still at their call:
He has pestered the Press,
In ridiculous dress,
In this scribbling Age he could do no less:
But to so little purpose as plainly appears,
With Pen he had as good sat picking his ears.
9.
To end with a Prayer, as now it is my lot,
Confounded be Plotters, with their Popish Plot:
God bless and preserve our Gracious Good KING,
That he may never feel the Presbyters sting;
As they brought his Father
With rage to the Block,
So would they extirpate all the whole Stock:
But with their false Plots I hope they will end
At Tyburn, where the Rabble will surely attend.
The Whigs lamentable Condition; Or, the Loyallists Resolution.
To a pleasant new Tune.
1.
THe Deel assists the Plotting Whigs
To carry on their damned Intrigues,
And does provide them new supplies,
Gin any faus and Raskal dies;
Up starts some Bankrupt perjured Loon,
Instructed by the Polish Prince,
How to amuse th'unthinking Toon,
And make the Bigots leese their sense.
2.
This squinting and Curmudgeon sits
Consulting with his Whiggish Chits,
Who treacherously with him combine
To root out a^ the Royal Line:
But Heaven, which has disclosed their Plots,
Confound their vain Inventions,
Disperse the wretched hai^-brain'd Sots,
And cross their cursed Intentions.
3.
Whither do you hurry Phaeton?
Is It not enough that he is undone
By your persideous Treachery,
The source of au his Infamy?
But, to promote your wretched ends,
Ye make the Lorden a stop-gap;
Like Croc^diles, ye fawning Friends
Pretendedly mourn his mis-hap.
4.
The Bearn may see how he is feul'd,
Tea late may find that he is gulled:
Wha^ then shall pity his Estate,
That toiled to be unfortunate?
He Is now a hardy Rebel grown,
And glories in base actions;
The silly Lad gangs up and down,
To make Feuds and Distractions.
5.
Wa^ to'l the Nations Scabs and Boils,
Ye that delight in Civil Broils,
Wha'd set us by the ears again,
Ye Worriers of Loyal men:
^'se mean the pert blew-apron Fops,
Wha meddle with the State affair,
Leuk to'l your Wives, and mind your Shops,
Whig Gold nor Cornish shall not be May'r.
6.
All Aegypts Plagues seize Doctor T.O.
Who did design the overthrow
Of Church and State: Have we forgot
'Twas He contrived the Popish Plot?
Can we forget our Martyred Prince,
Whose Blood does loud for vengeance ca^l?
Shall we not stand in's Son's defense,
Against Whigs, wha^ wish for his doonfal?
7.
Take courage, pull a^ Rebels down,
Obey the KING, and guard His Throne;
Commit the rest to the prudent care
Of our Tribunes and geud L^ird May'r:
As for our Foes the Rebel-Rout,
He timely curbed the stubborn Elves;
Their Villainy he has found out,
And now they are fit to hang themselves.
The Present State of ENGLAND.
Tune, It was in the prime of Cucumber time.
JAck Presbyter's up, and hopes at one swoop
To swallow King, Bishops, and all^a:
The Mitre and Crown must both tumble down,
Or the Kingdom, he tells you, will fall^a.
Sure it is a hard Fate, that to prop up the State,
We must pull down the State-Religion:
But the Saints have a new one, more holy and true one,
Composed of Fox and Wigeon.
An Engine they have got, called a damned Popish Plot,
Which will bring in a Through-Reformation;
Which, though it be half Fable, it mads the poor Rabble,
And puts out of wits half the Nation.
Thus their work's quickly done for each Mothers Son
That to Church or to King is Loyal,
Shall strait be indicted, or else be sore frighted
To be brought to their f^ry Trial.
It Is no more but pretend he is to Pop'ry a Friend
The Brethren cry loud, he is a Traitor;
And their Evidences bring against him pretenses,
And all of a Treas'^able nature.
The Impeachers are such, so Hon'rable and Rich,
That no Bribe can to Falsehood invite 'em;
Though they contradict themselves and every body else,
A good lusty Vo^e can right 'em.
No matter for blood, their Oaths shall stand good*
^n despite of all circumstances:
The City-Cabals say they cannot swear false,
And each Pamphlet their Honor enhances.
Who dares to deny but One single Lie
Of the Many they swear on their credit,
Must down on his knees, is rebuked, and pays Fees,
And must cry Peccavi he did it.
If any's so bold their tricks to unfold,
or offers to prove them Liars,
Strait up steps another, and swears for Rogue-brother,
And flings the poor Wretch in the Briars.
Thus Villains bout Ten, the worst scum of men,
(While the Godly Party maintain 'em
All England do govern, and each such a Sovereign,
The King must not speak again 'em.
Old Noll and Dad Nick have taught 'em the trick
To Make Plots, and then to Reveal 'em:
Thus runs round the Jig of Politic Whig,
Sure Pardon, if they do not conceal 'em.
Then inspired they bring in for sad men of sin
Any one that is Honest and Loyal:
But if Pardon's denied, all flock on Fitz-side,
To hector the Mercy Royal.
Thus most men for fears dare not for their ears
But Whig and his Rout to second;
Which if they refuse, they are far worse than Jews,
And Papists or Traitors are reckoned.
And every poor Ape who for Changes does gape,
And to be preferred by the Party,
To help Good Old Cause wide stretches his ^aws,
With loud Lies to show himself hearty.
And those Worthies Three, Care, Vile and Langley,
Do publish as fast as they make them:
The being in Print, signifies something in it,
And the Rabble for Gospel mistake them.
Mean while Pendent laughs, and at Byter scoffs,
And at's hotheaded Zeal does flout-a;
The Coxcomb to see thus shaking the Tree,
While he is ready to gather the Fruit-a.
Let Papists be hanged, and Presbyters damned,
And may goggle-ey'd Traitors perish,
But let true hearts sing, Long live Charles our King,
The Church and the State to cherish.
Raree Show; Or, The True-Protestant-Procession.
Tune, The Northumberland-man.
1.
THis is the Cabal of some Prot. Lords,
A forging the turn that not long since they had;
Here W -- ton sits, and searches Records,
To find flaws in good Statutes, and varnish the bad.
2.
This is the Lord Toney that slily sits here,
Who to sham and contrive has never denied;
And rather than the Cause should fall through his fear,
He Will let out Rebellion by broaching his side.
3.
This is popular Perkin that smirks and looks gay,
The women extol the Spark up to the Sky*
None danceth with so great a grace, as they say,
Yet somebody thinks that he capers too high.
4.
Here flourishing E --, the Tongue of the Gang,
With Rhetorical Artifice fancies fine things;
First vainly composeth a taking Harangue,
Then fosters a Villain in Libelling Kings.
5.
Here Is Doctor Informant, that never would stick out
To traffic in Oaths, or tell a State-lie;
Observe how he firks all the Jesuits about,
First blaws on a Beuk, and so Papists God b'we ye.
6.
Here Is Wilmore, that is troubled with scruples and stings,
His Citizens Conscience is nice and demure,
A Traytor's indicted for Treas'nable things;
But he tells you it is false, he is a Protestant sure.
7.
These are some sage Citizens that you see there,
Who (out of their Zeal all our Rights to maintain,
And to keep out all Slavery) have taken a care
To put up in the Streets two Posts and a Chain.
8.
These are some Apprentices still do retain
Some Tenets their Masters approve and allow;
They come to direct a wise Monarch to Reign,
'Stead of sweeping their Shop, and cleaning of Shoes.
9.
This is the Committee where Grievance ^s scanned,
Which remonstrates dangers that threat^n the State:
Good service is here by suspicion trepanned,
And Allegiance is reckoned Malignancy strait.
10.
Here Is the Synod of Saints, that will sometimes refresh
The failings of Nature with means of their own;
They Will preach you the mortification of Flesh
With Eyes up to Heaven, and Breeches let down.
11.
These are the Cabal of the Covenantiers,
That think they maintain the Religion the best
By pulling down Churches and their Overseers,
And routing the Defender of Faith with the rest.
12.
These are the Remains of the Levelling Rump,
That stink in the House, and fresh Commons annoy;
And lest the right James should be turned up Trump,
They cry out, A Court Card will their gaming destroy
13.
That Lumber of Trumpery buzzing about*
Are silly Subscribers that come at first dash,
To make up a large Petitioning Rout
Of Link-boys, and all such True-Protestant trash.
14.
These there are the Hucksters that Treason retail,
They Will sell you a sheet with a penymorth in it.
That Is Courantier Care, that never will fail
To scrible, while Langley dares publish and print.
15.
That Is the Club of a pack of ingenious Friends,
That made Charles a Scotch-Pedlar ^th Raree Show,
And I hope that our Monarch, to make 'em amends,
Will give them a Yard of St. Johnstons or two.
The Pot-Companions; Or, Drinking and Smoking preferred before Caballing and
Plotting.
Tune, Thus all the day long we are frolic and gay.
1.
COme make a good Toast,
and stir up the Fire,
And fill the great Tankard
of what we admire:
Then bring in a Paper
of excellent Fogoe,
That we may perfume
the whole house with the (...)
And here let us sit
Like honest brave Fellows,
That neither are Tories
Nor Whigs in an Alehouse.
And here let us sit, etc.
2.
We'll raise no disputes
Of the Church nor the State,
To waken the PLOT,
which has slept out its date;
Nor came we to treat
of the Cities great Charter,
But only to drink
to the Sons of the Martyr:
For better it is
to be honestly Sotting,
Than live to be hanged
For Caballing and Plotting.
For better it is, etc.
3.
Since Freedom or Death
is not in our power,
What have we to do
with the Lords in the Tower?
We'll leave them to Justice,
let that take its course,
And set every Saddle
upon the right Horse;
Though the Witnesses fade,
and the Plot's almost rotten,
Yet Presbyter-Jack
will never be forgotten.
Though the Witnesses fade, etc.
4.
We have nothing to do
with the Feuds of the Nation,
With old Magna Charta,
nor the Association*
Let Shaftsbury fancy
himself to be crowning,
Or beg his Quietus,
and venture a Drowning;
Let Black-coat swear on,
and raise up his story:
That Is nothing to us,
let the Saints have their glory.
Let Black-coat swear on, etc.
5.
Though the Spaniards were landed,
which Bedlow recounted,
And all the Commissions
which Coat gave were mounted;
And little Don John
did lead these brave Fellows,
The Devil a foot
would we stir from the Ale house:
When they have raised Armies
by praying and winking,
It Is we that maintain them
with Smoking and Drinking*
When they have raised Armies, etc.
6.
Then away to the King,
let the Tankard go round;
May the Plots and the Plotters
each other confound:
To His Highness the Duke,
and the Royal Successors,
And every Member
of Loyal Addressers;
To the honest Lord Mayor,
and all other old Christians;
But guard us, good Lord,
from these whining Philistims.
To the honest Lord Mayor, etc.
The Bully Whig; Or, The poor Whores Lamentation for the Apprehending Sir
Thomas Armstrong.
Tune, Ah! Cruel bloody Fate! etc.
1.
AH! Cruel bloody Tom!
What could thou hope for more,
Than to receive the Doom
Of all thy Crimes before?
For all thy bold Conspiracies
Thy Head must pay the score;
Thy Cheats and Lies,
Thy Box and Dice,
Will serve thy turn no more.
2.
^ngrateful thankless Wretch!
How could thou hope in vain
^out the reach of Ketch)
Thy Treasons to maintain?
For Murders long since done and past,
Thou Pardons have had store,
And yet would still
Stab on, and kill,
As if thou hop'dst for more.
3.
Yet Tom, ever he would starve,
More Blood resolved to'^e spilt;
Thy flight did only serve
To justify thy Guilt:
While They whose harmless Innocence
Submit to Chains at home,
Are each day freed,
While Traitors bleed,
And suffer in their room.
4.
When Whigs a PLOT did Vote,
What Peer from Justice fled?
In the FANATIC PLOT
Tom durst not show his Head.
Now Sacred Justice rules above,
The Guiltless are set free,
And the Napper's napt,
And Clapper clapped,
In his CONSPIRACY.
5.
Like Cain, thou had a Mark
Of Murder on thy Brow;
Remote, and in the dark,
Black Guilt did still pursue;
Nor England, Holland France, or Spain;
The Traitor can defend;
He will be found
In Fetters bound,
To pay for it in the end.
6.
Tom might about the Town
Have bully'd, huff'd and roared,
By every Venus known,
Been for a Ma^s adored:
By friendly Pimping, and false Dice,
Thou might have longer lived,
Hectored and shamm'd,
And swore and gam'd,
Had thou no Plots contrived.
7
Tom once was Cock-a-hoop
Of all the Huffs in Town;
But now his Pride must stoop,
His Courage is pulled down:
So long his Spurs are grown, poor Tom
Can neither fly nor fight;
Ah Cruel Fate!
That at this rate
The ' Squire should foil the Knight!
8*
But now no remedy,
It being his just Reward;
In his own Trap, you see,
The ^ygre is ensnared:
So may all Traitors fare, till all
Who for their Guilt did fly,
With Bully Tom
By timely Doom,
Like Him, unpitied die.
The Jealous Ladies Complaint.
To an Excellent New Tune.
1.
TEll me no more,
There must be something in it;
Think what you swore
When first you did begin't,
That n^n^ but I
Could e^r your heart suffice;
And my Eyes and my Thighs,
How your mind it did surprise:
But now, You Bitch, you look so leam,
You damned confounded stinking Queen,
Are all the words that I can gain
For my great pain.
2.
Can you forget
The ^oys you did delight in,
And those great Pleasures
You us^d to spend the night in?
When with sweet Raptures
So close you did embrace*
And your Love used to move
In another pretty place;
But now you turn away your head,
And there you lie as though you're dead,
And all the joys I had in Bed
Are gone and fled.

WHen Adam proper Names on Beasts conferred,
The Salamanca-Doctor was in the Herd;
The Midwife, she foresaw 'twou'd prove a Dunce,
So gave him Name and Character at once:
Which but unfold, and join again with Art,
Both Sot and Drunkard lurk in every part;
Nor in his Temper thus alone betrayed,
It Is on his Face in Ruby Signs displayed.
Well may we doubt the Gospel of that PLOT,
Whose chiefest Evidence is JUST A SOT.
