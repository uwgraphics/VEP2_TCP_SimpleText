The TORY BALLAD ON Their Royal Highnesses Return from Scotland.
To the Tune of, The Prince of Orange 's Delight. 1. June. 1682
^

[1]
ROom, room for Cavaliers, bring us more Wine,
His Highness is Landed, about with the Glass;
The Brimigham-piece is but Counterfeit Covn,
Yet fain for good Sterling amongst us would pass.
Hey Bowman, more Wine,
Fill up to the Brim;
While Zealots repine
We'll frolic and sing;
For Oats is confounded,
That Turn-coated Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
[2]
A little Old Conjurer threw so much Brass,
And Pewter and Copper amongst the True Coin,
That hardly a Penny of Money can pass,
But what is Clipped, Plated, or washed very fine;
But thine Boy, and mine,
Bears the stamp of the KING;
Then let us have more Wine,
While good Money we bring;
John Thum is confounded,
That Brazen-faced Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
[3]
With such a Bold, Impudent and Brazen-face
They Would pass for true Mct le, although but washed o'r;
The KING's Stamp and Image they only disgrace,
As they did their Lord and Creator's before;
But thine Boy, and mine,
Bears the stamp of the KING,
Then let us have more Wine,
While good Money we bring;
For Care is Confounded,
That Schismatic Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
[4]
Yet (what is most noted) these Brimigham Elves,
To bear the True stamp are so brazen'd with Art,
That they would have nothing to pass but themselves,
Although they are but Copper and Gaul at the heart.
But thine Boy, and mine,
Bears the stamp of the KING,
Then let us have more Wine,
While good Sterling we bring;
For Dick is confounded,
That Libelling Roundhead,
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
[5]
They call themselves Loyal, nay more, love the King,
Yet Royallists Tory and Papist mis-call;
And rail at all those who stand up for the Thing,
With L' Estrange, Heraclitus and Thompson, and all:
Against these the Slaves
Their Libels they Fl^ng;
Yet they are the Knaves,
Tha do Libei the KING;
But Langley's confounded,
That Pamphletting Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
[6]
Thus Brimigham still the Stamp Royal rebuk^s,
With Brazen-faced Impudence uilded so fine,
Who hates the KING's Ficture as well as the Duke's,
And loves it in nothing, unless in his Coin;
But let him ^^ill pass
For a counterfeit Thing,
About with the Gla^s,
And merrily sing;
For Ben's confounded,
That Pillory'd Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
[7]
To the KING and the QUEEN, fill it it up to the Top,
The D and the Duchess, whom Heaven has restored,
And next, Hans in Kelder, the Royal Blow-Cap,
To all the TRUE Issue, and each LOYAL LORD:
Crown every Glass,
Fill 'em up to the Brim:
About let 'em pass,
While we merrily sing;
For Baldwin's confounded,
That impudent Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
[8]
To brave ALBEMARL the next we will pursue,
With Worster and Clarendon, Sermour, and Hall
To all to their KING, and their Country are True,
Who Loyalty love, and confound the Caball,
If Monarchy shine,
And BOWMAN but bring
Good store of brisk Wine,
We'll make the Dog ring;
For TONY's confounded,
That Spiggoted Roundhead;
Then let us be Loyal, and True to our KING.
