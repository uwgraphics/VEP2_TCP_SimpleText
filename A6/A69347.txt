De^nder of the Faith, etc. To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops,
Archdeacons, Deanes, and their Officials: Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all
spiritual persons: And also to al Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs,
Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens, and Headboroughes: And to all Officers of
Cities, Boroughes, and Towns corporate: And to all other our Officers,

WHEREAS we are credibly certified by a Certificate under the hands of our
trus^y and well-beloved Subjects Sir Fulke Grevill Knight, Chancellor of our
Exchequer, Sir Thomas Leigh, sir Edward Deuereux, and sir Thomas Holt Knights
and Baronets, sir Edward Greuill, sir Clement Fisher, sir Clement Throgmorton,

sir Thomas Bea^^on, and sir Henry Rainsford Knights, Thomas Spencer, Edward
Boughton, Bartholomew Hales, John Repington, William Comb, and William Barnes
Esquiors, Justices of the Peace within our Counties of Warwick and Gloucester:
That upon Saturday the Nynth day of July in the year of our Lord God, One
Thousand Six Hundred and Fourteen, there happened a sudden and te^^ible Fire
within our Town of Stratford upon Avon within our County of Warwick, which
within the space of less then two hours consumed and burnt Fifty and Four
dwelling houses, many of them being very fair houses, besides Barnes, Stables,
and other howses of Office, together also with great store of Corn, Hay,
Straw, Wood, and Timber therein, Amounting in all to the value of Eight Thousand
Pounds and upwards The force of which Fire was so great (the wind sitting full
upon the Town) that it dispersed into so many places thereof, whereby the
whole Town was in very great danger to have been utterly consumed and burnt;
by reason whereof, and of two several Fires happening in the said Town within
these Twenty years, to the loss of Twenty Thousand Pounds more, not only our
said poor Subjects who have now sustained this great loss, are utterly
undone and like to perish, but also the rest of the Town is in great hazard
to be overthrown and undone, the Inhabitants there being no ways able to
relieve their distressed neighbors in this their great want and misery. AND
whereas the said Town has been a great Market Town whereunto great recourse
of people was made, by reason of the w^kely Market, Faires, and other frequent
meetings, which were there holden and appointed, and now being thus ruinated
and decayed, it is in great hazard to be utterly overthrown, if either the
resort thither be neglected, or course of travelers diuerted, which for want
of speedy reparation may be occasioned. And forasmuch as our said distressed
Subjects the Inhabitants of the said Town are very ready and willing to the
uttermost of their powers to reedifie and new build the say Town again, Yet
finding the performance thereof far beyond their abilty, they have made their
humble suite unto us, that we would be pleased to provide some convenient
means that the said Town may be again reedified and repaired as well for the
relief of the distressed people within the same, as also for the restoring and
continuing of the said Market, and have humbly besought Us to commend the same
good and laudable deed and the charitable furtherance thereof, to the
benevolence of all our loving Subjects, not doubting but that all good and
wel-disposed Christians will for common charity and love to their Country, and
the rather for our Commendation heerof, be ready with all willingness to extend
their charitable relief toward the comfort of so many distressed people and
the speedy performing of so good and charitable a work.

KNOW ye therefore, that we (tendering the lamentable estate and lesses of
our said distressed Inhabitants, together with the humble suit of all our
foresaid Justices made unto Us on their behalfes) Of our especial Grace and
Princely compassion, have given and granted, and by these our ^etters Patents
do give and grant unto our foresaid trusty and well-beloved Subjects, Sir
Richard Verney, sir Henry Rainsford Knights, Bartholomew Hales Esquior, and the
Bayliffe and Burgesses of the said Town of Stratford upon Avon, and to their
Deputy and Deputies, the bearer or bearers hereof, full power, license and
authority, to ask, gather receive, and take the Alms and charitable
benevolence of all our loving Subjects whatsoever Inhabiting within our

for and toward the new building, reedifying and erecting of the said Town of
Stratford upon Avon, and the relief of al such our poor distressed subjects,
their Wives and Children, as have sustained loss and decay by the misfortune
of the said Fire.
