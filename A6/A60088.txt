Question.
WHat is God?

A. God is a pure and an incomprehensible spirit, Joh. 4.24. having his being
of himself, Exodus 3.14.

Q. How many Gods are there?

A. No more but one, 1 Cor. 8.6.

Q. How many Persons are there in that one Godhead?

A. Three: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, 1 John 5.7.

Q. How are we to conceive of God?

A. Not as of any bodily substance, but only as he has revealed himself in
his works and word; namely, to he a spirit of infinite power, wisdom,
holiness, etc. and our merciful Father in Jesus Christ, Deuteronomy. 4.16. John 17.3.

Q. In what estate was man created by God?

A. In a good estate, holy, righteous, and happy, Genesis 12.7.

Q. In what estate is every man borne?

A. In a most miserable estate, Ps. 51.5.

Q. What is the cause of that misery?

A. Original sin which came by Adams fall, Romans 5.12.

Q. What are the parts of original sin?

A. These two: first, the imputation of Adams actual transgression unto us:
and secondly, the universal depravation and corruption of our natures issuing
from that sin imputed, Romans 5.19.

Q. How could Adams sin redound and be imputed unto us?

A. Because we were in his loins as in the loins of our common parent who
having received in his creation holiness and happiness for himself and his
posterity by the righteous decree of God through his fall lost them, for both
implunging both himself and them into sin and misery, To. 19.

Q. Can a man by nature do nothing of himself that is pleasing unto God?

A. No: for original sin has wholly corrupted the whole man, with the seeds
of all manner of sin, Genesis 6.5.

Q. Are men that live unto years guilty of no other sins besides original?

A. Yes: they are guilty also of actual sins.

Q. What is sin?

A. The transgression of the Law, 1 John 3.4.

Q. What is the punishment of sin?

A. Besides other inferior punishments, the maine punishment thereof is
eternal death, consisting in the separation of soul and body from God and the
joys of Heaven, and the undergoing of everlasting torments in hell with the
devil and his Angels for ever, Romans 8.23.

Q. Shall none escape this punishment?

A. Yea, all the elect, Romans 6.30.

Q. Who is appointed to redeem the Elect from this punishment?

A. Christ Jesus, God and man, Ephesians. 1.7.

Q. What has he done to redeem them?

A. He having perfectly fulfilled the whole Law, has suffered a violent death
of the body, and grievous torments upon his soul for them. Mat. 27.46.

Q. Why was Christ man?

A. First, that he might suffer. Secondly, that the merit of his suffering
might be accepted for man's sin, for by the order of Gods Law and justice that
nature that had sinned, must needs satisfy for sin, Heb. 2.14, 16, 17.

Q. But how could it stand with the equity and justice of God, to punish his
Son Jesus Christ for the sins of the elect?

A. Very well, because he became their surety, being both willing and able to
endure the punishment to be inflicted, and to deliver himself out of it, Heb.
7.22.

Q. Why was he God?

A. a First, that he might sustain his humane nature in suffering, and so wind
himself out of the torment. b Secondly, that his suffering might be of an
infinite merit to satisfy Gods infinite wrath provoked by man's sin, a Act.
2.24. b Heb. 9.14.

Q. How could the Death of Christ receive such efficacy from the divine nature,
seeing the divine nature did not suffer?

A. First, because the humane nature which did suffer, was conjoined with the
divine in one and the selfsame person, and therefore that which was done in
the humane nature is attributed to the whole person consisting of both natures.
Secondly, because the divine did uphold the humane nature in suffering, and
deliver if out of the suffering, and so the complete work of man's redemption
depends upon both natures, Acts 20.28.

Q But how can the merits and sufferings of Christ being but one, be extended
so far as to take away the sins of the Elect.

A. Because he was a public person, sustaining all their natures, and
suffering in their names, Romans 5.15.

Q. By what means are the Elect made partakers of Christ and his benefits?

A. By faith, Acts 13.39.

Q. What is faith?

A. A true persuasion wrought in the heart of an humbled sinner by the spirit
of God, and grounded upon the Gospel, whereby he applies Christ and all his
merits to himself, Gal. 2.20.

Q. Does faith save us for the worthiness of it self?

A. No: but only for the worthiness of the object whom it lays hold upon;
namely Christ and all his merits, Acts 4.12.

Q. What means does the spirit of God use to prepare a man for faith?

A. The preaching of the Law, whereby he works in him a sight and sense of
his own sin and misery, Romans 3.20.

Q. What means does the spirit of God use for the working of faith?

A. The preaching of the gospel. To. 10.14

Q. What means are appointed for the increasing of faith?

A. Diverse, principally these; first, the word preached; secondly, Prayer;
thirdly, the Sacrament.

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. An outward seal of the Covenant of grace in Christ's blood, and of the
righteousness thereof, Romans 4.11.

Q. How many Sacraments are there?

A. Two only, Baptism and the Lords Supper.

Q To what use serve the Sacraments?

A. To strengthen the weak faith and feeling of Gods Elect in the benefits
that come by Christ.

Q. What benefits do the Elect receive by Christ?

A. All benefits that are promised in the Covenant of grace, both temporal,
spiritual and eternal, more specially these four, as principal,
Justification, Mortification, Sanctification and Salvation, 2 Cor. 1.20. 1 Cor.
1.30.

Q. By what action in Baptism is our Justification and Mortification signified
unto us?

A. By the washing of the body in the water, and by the continuance of the body
under the water for some short space; for thereby is signified the drowning and
burying of our sin; in Christ's blood, both in regard of the g^ilt of them
which is our justification, as also in regard of the power of them, which is
our mortification, Romans 6.3, 4.

Q. By what action in Baptism is our sanctification and salvation confirmed?

A. By the raising of the body alive out of the water, for thereby is signified
both our rising again unto newness of life in this world, and unto eternal
in the world to come, Romans 6.4, 5. Col. 2.12.

Q. What conditions is the party baptized bound unto?

A. He is bound to believe and to repent, Mark 16.16. Luke. 3.3.

Q. Why then are Infants baptized who cannot perform these conditions?

A. These conditions are for the present performed, or at the least professed
by their Parents, or other in their stead, who promise so to bring up their
Children in the nurture of the Lord, as that in time by the Lords mercy they
themselves may perform them; and thus were the children of the godly in the
old Testament circumcised. Genesis 17.12.

Q. By what action are the aforesaid benefits which we receive by Christ
confirmed unto us in the Lords Supper?

A. By the eating and drinking of bread and wine according to Christ's
institution for the nourishing of our bodies: for thereby is signified our
spiritual eating and drinking of Christ Jesus his body and blood, and so of
all the benefits of his death, burial and resurrection for the nourishment of
our souls, 1 Cor. 10.16, 17.

Q. What does the Ministers consecrating of the bread and wine signify?

A. The Lords consecrating of his Son to be our high Priest and Redeemer*
Joh. 6.26. Psalm. 110.4.

Q. What does the breaking of the bread, and the pouring forth of the wine
signify?

A. The crucifying of Christ's body and the shedding of his blood, 1 Cor. 11.24,
25. Mat. 26.28.

Q. What does the Ministers offering of the bread and wine to every one, and
his commanding him to take it signify?

A. The Lords offering of his Son to every one of his elect particularly, and
his commanding of him to believe on his Name, Luke 22.19.

Q. What must he do who would receive this Sacrament worthily?

A. He must examine himself before he do receive it, 1 Cor. 11.28.

Q. Wherein?

A. In these 5. things chiefly. 1. Whether he understand and know the
Principles of Religion. 2. Whether he believe. 3. Whither he repent. 4. Whether
he be in love and charity with his brethren. 5. Whether he come with a reverent
respect to this Sacrament, as Gods holy Ordinance,

Q. What must he do after he has received it?

A. 1. He must be thankful, 2. He must examine what benefit he has got by
recording of it, waiting for a blessing, 1 Cor. 11.25.

Q. How many ways do the Sacraments confirm our faith; and assure us of the
benefits mentioned before, to wit, of our Justification, Mortification,
Sanctification, etc?

A. 4. ways. 1. as Signs 2. as Seals 3. as Pledges 4. as Instruments of
conveyance
thereof*

Q. What difference is there between these two Sacraments?

A. Baptism cofirmeth unto us our first ingrafting into Christ, and our first
participation of these benefits: The Lords Supper confirms the continuance
and increase of these benefits in and unto us.

Q. What other grace is bred with faith and does most specially manifest it
self together with says?

A. The grace of true repentance, Zach. 12.10.

Q. How is repentance occasioned?

A* By the sight and sense of the multitude and greatness of a man's sins, and
so of the stain and desert of them, Jer. 39.19.

Q. How may a man come to know the multitude of his sins?

A. By the holy law of God rightly understood, Romans 3.20. Jam. 1.25.

Q. How may we understand the law aright?

A. For the understanding of it we must observe these four rules.

Q What is the first?

A. 1. In every Commandment where any evil is forbidden, there the contrary
good is commanded; and back again, where any duty is commanded, there the
contrary sin is forbidden.

Q. What is the second?

A. 2. Under one good or evil action all of the same kind are comprehended,
yea all occasions and means leading thereunto.

Q. What is the third?

A. 3. The Law is spiritual, and binds even the heart and the thoughts thereof.

Q. What is the fourth?

A. 4. The Law requires not only our observation, but even our preservation
also, that is, that we do not only keep it our selves, but cause others also
as much as in us lies to keep it.

Q. How may a man know the greatness of his sins?

A. By considering the circumstances of committing them, as namely, that they
have been committed against knowledge and conscience; against the means of
restraint, and the means of grace, that we have long lien in them, without
repentance, that by them we have pierced Christ, grieved his spirit,
dishonored his Gospel* offended our brethren, etc.

Q. What are the parts of repentance?

A. Two* humiliation and conversion.

Q. How does humiliation show it self*

A. 1. By making a man humbly and heartily confess all, and especially his
known and greatest sins and corruptions. 2. By making him judge and condemn
himself for them, Ezekiel. 36.31.


Q. What be the parts of conversion?

A. These two turning from all sin* and turning to all manner of good, and
from these two spring a godly life.

Q. What is a godly life?

A. A sincere earnest and constant endeavoring to forsake all sin, in
thought word and deed* and to practice all Gods Commandments, Luke 1.74 75.
