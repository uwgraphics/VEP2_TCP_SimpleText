A General Epistle TO Friends of Truth and Righteousness in England and
Holland, or elsewhere; WITH A Testimony against that Spirit that speaks much of
Holiness and Peace, but leads back into the World and its Pollutions, where the
Cross of Christ is denied.
By Humphry Wollrich.
Written in the 11th. Month, Anno 1665. FRIENDS,
The pure Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ all wait to feel, live and move in
your mortal bodies, that so you may by and in it witness acceptance with the
Lord, the Father and fountain from whom every good and pure gift does proceed
and spring. Oh witness him alive in you that was dead, that so ye from him may
receive life, as he does from the Father, that there may be none amongst you
all that can be content to sit down in the form without the power, or in having
a name to live, but as ye feel that innocent Lamb of God live through
Righteousness, that has been wounded and slain through transgression, out of
which my souls desire and prayer to the Lord, is, ye all may be preserved in
the holy, pure, and undefiled life of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.

THe Eternal God, Lord of Heaven and of Earth, put it in my heart to write to
all Friends of truth and Righteousness in general, that ye all watch and pray
continually both in the day and in the night, with all your loins girded up
with the Girdle of Righteousness stand, stand in faith out of all fainting or
weariness, thoughts and unbelief, keeping the ward of the house of the Lord. O
dear Friends! ye that have known the Virgins state, unto whom nothing in this
World has been so dear and lovely as the savor of his good Ointment to feel,
who have rejoiced in nothing so much as to hear the beloved Bridegrooms voice:
Oh, all watch and pray, in that the eternal Spirit is the Father of, that
nothing may enter in to defile the Temple of the living God; for he delights to
dwell and walk therein: Oh that pure spring of goodness all wait to feel living
in your own hearts, that by the same ye may be made willing as the holy Apostle
was, to die daily unto all visible and fading things, so that ye may be but
found in him, and be eye Witnesses of the life and power of his rising, by
which we have the answer of a good Conscience in his sight, and whereby the
Kingdom and the Glory, and the greatness thereof is revealed and brought to
light that was with the Father before the World began, which fallen man (from
Gods Image) has lost by trangression, which the Lord by his holy Spirit is
finishing and putting an end unto, and in the place thereof bringing in his
Everlasting Righteousness, and where sin and iniquity has abounded, grace and
mercy by Christ does much more abound, to the glory and renown of his holy Name
for evermore.

Oh dear Friends! hide not the Righteousness of the Lord within your hearts,
but love and follow him, that your Lights may shine out in the daily Cross to
self, until you come to witness the Baptism into his death, a death to all
that can work without the Lord, or hunt before him, as Nimrod did, the
beginning of whose Kingdom was Babel; or live (and feed) without the Eternal
spring of goodness, in the World in the broad and wide way that leads to
destruction; Oh let your Light shine out, and have always oil in your selves
to keep your Lamps burning, this is to the pure praise of him that has called
us to glory and virtue; and all dearly beloved Friends every where, keep out of
the Worlds spirit and cumbrances in the spirit of truth, and then by the living
spring in all ye do, will ye be guided, and those things that to you have
seemed hard and impossible by the feeling and guidance of the holy spirit will
be made easy and pleasant, as it is written, the Lord makes my way perfect,
but the way of transgressors is hard; therefore out of thy self live in the
Lord, and take hold of his strength, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
strength, in whom all the seed of Israel are justified, and do glory, to whom
eternal glory and praises be given, for he is good, and his mercies endure for
ever.

Oh the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, let none go from that, after fables,
and hats, and outward things, as some have done, who have been convinced of the
way of Righteousness, but are turned into the World from the holy Commandment,
and are become dry, having (little or) nothing left but swelling words of
vanity, whose root I am moved of the Lord to judge; for this was not their work
whom God raised at first amongst us, but to turn peoples minds to the eternal
light of the Word that shone in their own hearts, that by it their souls might
be saved in the day of the Lord, who has showed me these men are not of Paul's
spirit, but of that which did him much mischief in withstanding his words; for
he said he would not do those things while the world stood, whereby the weak
should be offended; but these men have said to me some of them, what need we
care who is offended, seeing we have freedom to do the thing, these things I do
but touch upon, for my Righteousness and my peace which makes me glad is of the
Lord, and the other things not worth the mentioning in comparison thereof, but
as one seeing the mischief it has done in City and Country to many simple
hearted people, beguiled with a show held forth for the substance; I could not
well be silent any longer. And further more this is my Testimony in this thing,
as keeping on the Hat in Prayer before the Lord in the Congregation of his
people is not lovely, it makes not for peace, neither is it of good report
before all, but sprang from that gainsaying root, that Corah, Dathan, and
Abiram joined unto, who with a greater outcry of holiness then Moses and
Aaron, had rose up against the Lord and his anointed and hidden ones, as these
men have done, whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert peoples minds from the
simplicity of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction if they repent not.

And all dear Children of the Light and of the day whom God has blessed, and
unto which all the promises are made, stand in the strength of the Lord, and
feed there out of self and out of all unbelief in the feeling of the holy pure
Spirit of the Lord in the goodness which will constrain thee to deny thy self,
so in him thou may be but found, say not in thy heart it is unpossible to be
holy and perfect in this life, that is the Infidel and the spirit which the
worlds life is in; David sometime said, I shall one day fall by the hand of
Saul; and does his promise fail for evermore, has the Lord forgotten to be
gracious, and will he be favorable no more? but the cause of this he came to
see was mistrust; therefore cries he, why art thou disquieted O my soul, and why
art thou cast down within me; hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for
the health of his Countenance; and I had fainted unless I had believed to see
the goodness of the Lord in the land of the Living, I say let not these things
enter you, but keep down out of them all to the holy root, with whom all things
are possible, as says the holy Apostle: when I am weak then am I strong; and
in the weakness is the power manifested; and we can do nothing as of our
selves, but our sufficiency is of the Lord, and I can do all things through
Christ that strengthens me; therefore good is it to live out of self in the
true poverty before him, where self is humbled, crucified, and made of no
reputation, quiet and still, but as the Lord moves and makes the way plain and
perfect, so does the rest remain and the inner gate of the Lords house open,
and the pure spring ishueth out, and the stream thereof makes glad the City of
God, and then is the tree of life known and seen, (as John witnessed) whose
Leaves are for the healing of the Nations: O blessed Nation, O happy people
whose feet stand within thy Gate, O Jerusalem! thou City of the Living God, the
Tabernacle which thou have pitched to dwell in, with the Children of the
eternal day. O my Soul bless thou the Lord for ever, in thy Church world
without end, who has caused thy glory to shine out of Sion clear as the Sun,
fair as the Morning, and terrible as an Army with banners. Oh thy beautiful
Garment, art thou clothing thy Children withal, and with the fruit of this
tree of life art thou feeding them withal, so that her Inhabitants may not say,
I am sick, the people that dwell therein are forgiven their iniquities, so the
eternal day of the Lord our God that has enlightened the Earth from his holy
Habitation be amongst you all, (in) and over you all, Amen, Lord Jesus Christ.

Let this be sent amongst Friends of Truth every where to be read amongst them,
as truth in the inner parts shall move.
Another Epistle to Friends.
Dear Friends,
WHom the Lord have called, from amongst an evil and sinful Generation, of Men
and Women whose words, ways and actions pleases not the Lord, but they are a
grief unto his good spirit, that he has given them a measure of, to instruct
them, which they have often and yet do rebel against, for the which cause the
Lord the righteous God of Heaven and Earth is revealing and making manifest his
righteous judgments in the Earth, that them that shall be left may hear and
fear the living and true God that made Heaven and Earth, and cease from the
fear of Men whose breath is in their nostrils, for strong is the Lord which is
now risen to judge the Whore; and to lay wast Zions Oppressors, for this is the
message which I have received from the Lord, to declare and publish and
proclaim in thy ears oh thou true Israel, that have waited for the Lord the
Bridegroom of thy Soul even as for the Morning, and desires nothing so much as
to be joined, weded and married unto Christ the Souls rest, and that thou
uprightly walk, and patiently waitest upon God for power to do his will, oh
you dear Children that labors to exercise a good conscience toward God and
Men, and have no end to self, nor any carnal interest whatsoever, nor envy unto
your Persecutors, nor nothing in your hearts but love and good will unto all
Men upon the Earth, that desire nothing that is theirs, but are made willing to
offer up freely unto the Lord all that you possess in this World, that so you
may glorify God with your Souls and Bodies, so that you feel such a right
spirit in you that you dare not offer a sacrifice unto to the Lord at another
Man's cost, but all that you desire of the Men of this World is, but liberty to
worship the Lord your God, according as you are persuaded by him, and as he
has and does reveal and manifest and make known himself by Christ the Light
unto you, which is the way to God, I say unto you that thus feels the
effectual work of the Lords precious truth in your inward parts, in the name
and power of the Lord God be patient in continuing in well doing, and the Lord
will give you the desire of your hearts, for the Lord is risen to comfort his
afflicted people, and to consider Zion whom no Man regards, and to deliver his
true Israel from under all their Egiptian Taskmasters which oppresses them
with their hard Taskes, and refuses to let you worship the Lord your God, in
that spirit that you have received of him, which the Lord has in these latter
days, according unto his promise poured forth upon you his sons and daughters,
that thus feels and knows your hearts and minds brought back unto God, and
redeemed by his power unto him out of sin and iniquity, that once separated you
from the Lord; so that the day and hour you now know and witness is come, that
Christ spoke of to the Woman of Samaria should come, that the true Worshippers
should worship the Father in spirit and truth; which truth you that thus are
obedient unto it, you witness Christ's words fulfilled that he declared; that he
declared if the truth shall make you free, then are you free indeed, which
freedom through mercy, blessed be the Lord, many have obtained in this the day
of his power, which you now witness is come that God promised by his Prophets
should come; in the which day you are made willing to do the will of God,
although it be a cross unto your own wills, and to the wills of them that are
enemies unto the appearance of God in you his people in this the day of his
power, and labors with all their strength and might, wisdom and policy, to
suppress, Banish and exile this way of worshipping of God in spirit, out of the
Earth, or from amongst men; that so they might set up their own traditions and
carnal Ordinances, and beggarly outside performances, which have not profited
them that have been exercised therein. But oh you dear Children of the Lord
that are redeemed unto God by his power, and are come beyond carnal Ordinances,
and have shook off them ragged robes of your own Righteousness and outside
performances, and are come to feel the power of the endless life, and the
virtue of the tree of Life you now feel to nourish your souls up to Eternal
life: I say unto you dear Brethren and Sisters, prise this unspeakable love and
mercy of the Lord God unto your Souls, and walk humbly before the Lord, and
feel his holy dread and pure fear in your hearts, that so you may be preserved,
and never more to depart from the Lord; then shall you never more be terrified
with the fear of man, whose breath is in his Nostrils, and is but as dust
before the God of your lives; so in the Light dwell: and all Friends that make
mention of the Lords precious Truth, and that names the Name of Christ keep out
of iniquity, and all bow unto the appearance of Christ, in your inward parts,
that so you may know him to take his Government in your hearts, that so you may
witness your change wrought, and may walk in the Light, and know your passage
from death to life; for Friends, this is the one thing most needful for all
people upon the face of the Earth: But more especially you that have received
the Lords precious Truth, that you all wait upon the Lord with a true purpose
of heart, for an entrance more abundantly into the Eternal Inheritance; that
so you may come to know that life to be raised that shall never die, that by it
your souls may live when this body shall be no more; and all Friends I warn and
charge you all in the presence of Almighty God to take heed of negligence and
carelessness, and of being indifferent in those things that does concern your
Everlasting peace and Salvation of your Souls, and all strive to lay hold on
Eternal Life, and none to take up a rest below or short of the enjoyment of the
peace of God which passes the understanding of all them that are out of it,
which the Lord God is revealing and making known unto the simple hearted, that
more desires the knowledge of his ways then any thing this world can afford:
And all Friends labor to keep your minds within, unto Gods precious truth,
that so you may feel your bodies prepared, and your hearts enlarged to run the
ways of Gods Commandments, and know the will that sanctifies in soul, body,
and spirit, then shall your hearts rejoice in God your Savior, who is now
saving his people, and delivering them from the fears of death, and the bondage
of Corruption; So dear Friends mind your way to pass, which is Christ Jesus the
Light, and look not out, nor wander, nor gaze abroad, for they that do, will
stumble and be taken in the Enemy's snares; and none be discouraged at what
has or may befall the Lords own people in this day, in which the Lord is
revealing his Righteous Judgments in the Earth, by the which he is rebukeing
the wicked for their rebellion against the Truth, the light of Christ in their
Consciences, and for their despiteful using and persecuting his people, which
the Lord has sent in his Name and Power to forewarn them of the evil that is
now come upon them, but they have been like the deaf Adder which have
altogether refused to hear the voice of the Charmer, charm he never so wisely,
but the Lords love is unto his seed, and bodily exercise profits little, but
Godliness is the only gain, so that it is certainly so, that when the wrath of
the Lord is kindled, yea but a little, blessed are all they that puts their
trust in him, for they that put their trust in the Lord, they are saved by his
power; so that unto us to live is Christ, and to die is gain; so that the
Righteous and the Godly receives gain by their death, but it is not so with
them that forgets God and persecutes his People, for their reward will be
according unto their work, and therefore for the wicked it shall go ill with
them. But I say unto you dear people of the most high God, that are come unto
the Righteous Principle of God in your own hearts, it shall go well with you
that feel that life raised, that Paul blessed and praised the Lord for in his
day, when he said, Oh Death where is thy sting? O Grave where is thy victory*
the sting of Death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law. But thanks be to
God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ in the enjoyment
of the same life, my soul even praises and magnifies the Lord with all the
redeemed whom the Lord has saved and delivered from the fears of death, and
brought to know that love that is stronger then death. In the which powerful
love and life I dearly salute you all that in truth desires peace with the
Lord, unto whose power I commit you with my self.

Given forth in obedience unto the motion of the Lords Spirit in the universal
love of God that I feel in my heart unto all that have received the Lords
precious Truth, through which God is reconciling Man unto himself.
