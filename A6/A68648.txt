Most Necessary for all.

That the true Value of the vncurrant Coin may be known.

LONDON. Printed by B. A. and T. F. for Ben. Fisher, and are to be sold at his
Shop at the sign of the Talbot without Aldersgate.

To the Reader.
THere having been much doubt made (occasioning much difficulty, delay, and
differences in payments of Money) whether the uneven pieces of Gold, viz.
XXII. Shillings pieces, etc. were Current with such Allowances of Grains, as
heretofore, before the last Proclamation. To clear such scruples; and declare
the several worths of all vncurrant Coin exceeding the Remedies. To the end.
All may know, what such lightened Pieces will truly make: whereby they may be
much eased.

I have Calculated the prises of the same, and what it will make at his
Majesty's Exchanges; for the ease and direction of All men, that have occasion
to deliver or receive the same.

THE ADVICE.
WHEREAS, By his late Majesty's Proclamation made for suppressing of light
Gold, amongst other things and reasons thereof (therein more largely expressed)
it is Contained in these words. viz.
AND therefore, We do hereby straightly Charge and forbid, upon pain of
Contempt and incurring our High displeasure; That no person or persons, from
and after Midsomer next coming, in any County of our Realm, do presume to
take, receive, or deliver in payment, any Piece of our Gold Coin (and formerly
by us advanced) at the rates aforesaid, being clipped, washed, or any other
way unlawfully diminished, or lacking of his just weight thereof, otherwise,
then according to the Rates hereafter severally expressed. And with the
Allowance formerly set down in our former Proclamation. That is to say: 1. In
every Piece Current for Thirtie-three-shillings, the Remedy shall not exceed,
Four Grains and a half. 2. Twentie-two-shilling Pieces, shall not exceed,
Three Grains. 3. Sixteene-shillings Sixpence Pieces, shall not exceed, Two
Grains and a half. 4. Eleuen-shillings Pieces, shall not exceed, Two Grains
and a half. 5. Fiue-shilling Sixpence Pieces, shall not exceed, T^^ Grains.
6. Two shillings Nine-pence Pieces, shall not exceed, Half a Grain.


All which Remedies shall be allowed in every Piece accordingly, and no
deduction or abatement to be made for the same, but to pass as if it were of
full weight and just value. But if any such piece of Coin lacking of his
weight above the said Remedies, shall from and after Midsommer next coming,
be offered in payment by any person or persons within this our Realm; Our
will and pleasure then is, That for so many Grains more or less as the Piece
shall be lighter then the Remedies so as aforesaid allowed. Every person or
persons, that so offers the same in payment, shall also, at the same time pay
and allow; after the rate of Twopence the Grain to him that receives it, for
every Grain wanting above the Remedies respectively: AND every Person or
persons, unto whom the same is offered to be paid, with these allowances,
shall accept the same in payment, as if the same were full and just weight, any
thing Contained in our former Proclamation to the contrary notwithstanding.

PROVIDED always, That if any such Piece of Gold so offered in payment, after
the time aforesaid, shall want above the number of so many more Grains then
are allowed for the Remedies respectively* (As if the Piece of Twenty and two
shillings, shall want more then three Grains above the Remedy allowed, or the
piece of Eleuen-shillings, more then two Grains above the Remedy. And so of
all the rest respectively.) Then our will and pleasure is, that in all payments
betwixt party and party, the same shall not only be refused without all
redemption, but that every person or persons, to whom such tender of payments
be made, shall brand the same, by striking a hole in every of the said Pieces
so offered in payment as likewise of any other Piece as shall be found
Sowdered or unlawfully Imbased: Rendering those Pieces so stricken thorough then
presently after to the owners, according as was ordered by a Proclamation made
by our dear Sister and late Queen ELIZABETH, in the Nine and twentieth year
of her Reign upon like occasion. Given, etc.

By this Proclamation it is clear; That every Piece not wanting in weight
above the Remedies declared in the said Proclamation, viz. Every Piece of --
Shil. Pence. Grains. XXXIII. s. Not wanting above- 9. Grai. XXII. s. 6 Grai.
XVI. s. vj. d. 5. Grai. XI. s. 4. Grai. V. s. vj. d. 4. Grai. II. s. ix. d. 1.
Grai.

Is Current, and then was and ought to be accepted in payment with abatement
of Twopence a Grain, for every grain exceeding the Remedy allowed.

Now there is no alteration made concerning these Pieces, by the last
Proclamation, but they do and remain in the same state and degree, ( Money
payable upon the same allowance or deduction of Grains,) as they were before
the same. The words of which last Proclamation for so much as concerns the
Currancie of Coin being, as follows:

ITEM, to the end to avoid and put to our Coin all Gold money current within
this our Realm, being clipped, washed, or by any other means unlawfully
diminished, or lacking of the just weight thereof, otherwise then according to
the rates hereafter severally expressed, And with the allowance of the Remedies
set down in diverse former Proclamations of Queen ELIZABETH, and of our late
Father of blessed memory. That is to say:

1. In every Piece Current for Thirty Shillings, the Remedy and abatement,
shall not exceed, Four Grains and a half.

2. The Twenty shilling Pieces, shall not exceed, Three Grains.

3. The Fifteene-shillings Piece, shall not exceed, Two grains and a half.

4. The Tenne-shillings Piece, shall not exceed, Two Grains.

5. The Fiue-shillings piece, shall not exceed, One Grain.

6. The Two-shillings Sixpence piece, the Remedy and abatement shall not
exceed, Half a Grain.

All which Remedies shall be allowed in every Piece accordingly, the same
wanting no more, being to pass as if it were of full weight and just value.
But if any such piece of Coin shall lack of the true weight thereof, above
the Remedies before expressed. Then we do straightly Charge and Command, That
no person or persons whatsoever, shall acept or offer them in payment, upon any
allowance or defatuation for want of weight whatsoever, but that the same be
and stand denied down, and vncurrant. And that it shall be lawful for any
person or persons whatsoever, when offer of payment of any the said pieces
lightened as aforesaid shall be made to brand the same by striking a hole in
every of them said pieces so offered in payment, rendering the pieces so
branded, then presently after to the owners thereof again. Which said Lightened
or Branded Pieces, Our pleasure is, shall be brought or Carried to our
Exchanges or Mint, there again to be molten and converted into Coin.

This last Proclamation, expressly and by plain terms, Extends unto, and
Comprehends only such Pieces, which at the time of the said Proclamation were
Current, for, and at the rates expressed in the same, viz. At XXX. shillings,
XX. shillings, XV. shillings, X. shillings, V* shillings, and II. shillings,
vj. pence. And therefore, for as much as all uneven Pieces of Iacobus, half
Quarters, and Eights, were at the time of the said last Proclamation Current
for other values, viz. For XXXIII. shillings, XXII. shillings. XVI. shillings
vj. pence, XI. shillings, V. shillings vj. pence, and II. shillings ix. pence.
It is most clear, That the same Pieces are not at all comprehended, or altered
by the said last Proclamation; but do and are now current and payable upon the
same allowances and deductions for want of weight, as they were before the
publishing of the same. And the rather, For that there were then pieces Current
for the values mentioned in the last Proclamation whereof the same did dispose,
leaving the others to be in such degree and state as they were: As also for
that, The principal intention might be to preserve upright his Majesty's,
even Coins (whereof great Quantities have bin Coined) being yet in good state;
without much regard being had to the other, forasmuch as no more of the said
uneven Coins are purposed to be Coined.

AND therefore, the Tender of such Pieces, upon allowance and deduction for
want of weight agreeable to the former Proclamation, is good and not confronted
by the latter? But ought to be accepted of upon all payments of bonds, bills
of Exchange, and contracts, and duties, whatsoever and wheresoever; The party
refusing such payments not only endamaging himself by the delay: but
incurring the pain of the former Proclamation, by refusal of such monyes, as
his Majesty makes Current by his Proclamation. And this agrees with the
general Opinion of Lawyers, And the most usual practice of all men.
