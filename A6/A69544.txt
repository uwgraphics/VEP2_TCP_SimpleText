THE LAMBS GOVERNMENT: TO BE EXALTED over all in Israel; who is the Captain of
their Salvation, whose Right alone it is, (in whose mouth is found no guile,)
and not any other Birth, Spirit, Man, or Image, whatsoever. OR, THE GLORY of
the LORD

Risen like devouring Fire, to search out every false Birth, and false Spirit,
and to consume Antichrist with the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy him by the
brightness of his Coming. And this is a certain Sound (in season) to awaken the
mixt-Multitude throughout the whole Host; and that all may come to the Trial,
and search and see, what Spirit and Birth they are of, and in what Spirit and
Dominion you Rule and Govern, (who are Masters, Parents, and Governors of
Families, throughout all the Tribes of Israel, etc.

With an Exhortation (from God) that none within the Camp seek to Physicians
(or things of that kind outward) for any distemper, weakness, sickness, or
disease whatsoever, without his leadings and counsel, who leads into all
truth, etc.

Also, That no Babe among them should strive, or study for the comprehending,
or attaining the knowledge of the Laws of men, or Nations, to make their
defense, etc.

With a Dear and Tender Salutation, to the blessed Seed and Children of the
everlasting, holy, Covenant of Promise, throughout the whole Creation.

Given forth in the movings (at the commandment) of the Captain of Israel. By
one that follows him. WILLIAM BAILY.

Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive, power, and riches, and wisdom,
and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing, Rev. 5.12.

For by him were all things created, that are in Heaven, and in earth, visible
and invisible, whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities, or
Powers; all things were created by him, and for him, and he is before all
things, and by him all things consist; and he is the Head of the Body the
Church, who is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in all things
he might have the pre-eminence, Col. 1.16.

THE LAMBS GOVERNMENT TO BE Exalted over all in Israel.
JEsus Christ the only begotten Son of God, the holy Seed, the Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world (that lies in wickedness) in whose mouth guile is
not found, whose name is called the Word of God, whom all are to hear, whose
Kingdom is not of this world, whom God the Father has raised from the dead,
and appointed heir of all things, and Head over all to his Church, and given
him a name above every name, that at his name every knee should bow, of things
in Heaven, and things in the Earth; and every tongue confess him to be Lord,
to the glory of God the Father; whom he has given for a Leader and Commander
of the people, in whom alone is Redemption, and Salvation, and not in any
other. This is the Captain of thy Host, O Israel; this is thy King, and
Lawgiver; thy Judge, and Savior; and every spirit, seed, motion, or thought,
which is contrary, opposes, or rises against the life of this pure,
righteous, precious seed, (wheresoever, or in whomsoever it is, or appears)
is of Antichrist; which the Lord God will consume, by the spirit of his mouth,
and destroy by the brightness of his coming, (without respect of persons): And
this has been the Testimony of the Servants of the Lord in Ages past; and this
has been, and is our Testimony (who are his Servants) unto the world, in this
Age; which work he is now cutting short in righteousness, for his Elect Seeds
sake, in whom alone he is well pleased, which has long been pierced, wounded,
grieved and oppressed, by the contrary seed of evil doers; which have always
opposed, and exalted it self above all that is called God, and would not that
he should reign (who is the Truth, the Resurrection and the Life), whose right
alone it is, and for whose sake the Lord God Allmighty will overturn, overturn,
overturn, till he possess it unto the ends of the earth.

And well said the Scripture, that There are many Antichrists in the world, and
many false Prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many; and many shall come
and say, I am Christ, whereby many may be deceived, etc. Now this I do not
only read without in the world, but in the world which is set in man's heart,
which has been deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who has
searched it out to the full? or who knows it perfectly? or who has sought out
all its secret Chambers of Imagery? -- Truly, I find but one right seed, right
Spirit, Image or birth, which rightly sees, and rightly judges all things,
and searches out the most deep and hidden things, ways, forms, shapes,
turnings or spirits? It is a noble plant, a noble birth, and there is not a
deeper speech then it can understand, nor a form, that it cannot see, to the
foundation or through the vail, to the root thereof. It is the Elect which
cannot be deceived, neither will it deceive any who join to it, believe and
trust in it; but its not of this world, neither is its kingdom and glory of
this world, but from above, (over it) in the Majesty on high, (from whence it
is born) far above the Principalities, and Powers, of the Rulers of the
darkness of this world, (the Dominions and glory of which, are but its
temptations, to draw from the more noble, into the visible fading glory);
Heaven is its Throne, and the Earth its Footstool.

Therefore his Followers must be redeemed from the earth, from the world, the
glory, the spirit and nature of it within, in which lies the ground of
temptations, and the deceiveablenesse of unrighteousness, and the lying
wonders, and the many Antichrists, which does arise in the secret Chambers,
against the appearance of this noble Seed, to stand in the room of it, to
satisfy the mind, saying, I am Christ, to wit, I Will give thee satisfaction,
I Will be thy food, thy guide, or leader, etc. feeding the mind with false-hood
and vanity, till at last it proves a false Prophet, which has deceived, and
cast down many strong men wounded.

Therefore, Hearken O Israel, to the voice of the Captain of thy salvation, and
give not heed to (nor believe) any lying vanity within or without. Neither be
thou satisfied with a false Conception, or false birth, a false rest or peace,
short of the Election, short of the noble plant of renown, the wholly right
seed, whose Kingdom is not of this world; this is the Heir, against which many
false Prophets and Spirits (Antichrists) have risen up, to dispossess him of
the Inheritance. But all that go, or climb up before him, are Thieves and
Robbers: therefore be watchful and diligent, (for your Adversary goes about
seeking whom to devour) and fear always before the Lord thy God O Israel; and
believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God, for
there are many false spirits and false births, which are not of God, but of the
world; and the day of trial is now come, in which things that have been hid
shall be manifest.

There is a spirit that can satisfy it self, with the profession, likeness, or
image of the Truth; but its cross and burden, is the very Truth it self, which
does discover it, judge it, and cast it out: Therefore take heed, and beware of
that spirit, believe it not, but judge it in every appearance, it is the leaven
of the Pharisees, which can never enter (but shuts up) the Kingdom of God,
with all its Righteousness Comprehension and Profession. This spirit is without
the vail, and cannot see the end of those things which God will abolish, being
shut out of the Holiest of All, in which the secrets, and wonderful works of
God, are manifest to them that fear him; so this spirit judges according to
the outward appearance, and not with righteous judgment. This is that Bastard
(or Son of the Bond woman) which shall not inherit with the Heir, the Son of
the Freewoman. This is a knower of men after the flesh (the flesh is the vail)
and a respecter of persons, and loves the praise of men, and esteems the
rich in this world, more than the poor, whom God has chosen rich in faith, and
heirs of his everlasting Kingdom. Therefore beware of it, let it have no place
in thy Bosom, or within thy Borders, O Israel; for it is abomination unto the
Lord thy God, and a great Oppressor and Griever of his seed, and a contemner,
and secret despiser of his mean appearances in his babes, and little ones, in,
and by whom, he will confound the wisdom and glory of all flesh.

Again, There is a spirit that thinks or conceits better of it self, than of
others, because of outward things, which it seems to possess, or because of
the knowledge, experiences, or trials, which it has had in days past, through
the dealings of God in his love to the Seed; and with these things decks it
self, and through which the heart is lifted up, out of Gods fear, feeding it
self with the Manna which corrupts; this is a disobedient spirit, an
imprisoner of the Seed and Life of God in the particular, and an oppressor and
wounder of it in the general; and it is a lover of this world secretly in its
heart; though it seems to have a beautiful outside, or covering, the sower of
discord lodges (as a couched Beast) in its bosom: and the back-biter lies
within its breast, which as Arrows, it will send forth against the upright and
simple hearted, which does discover, see and fathom the ground and foundation
thereof; therefore beware of it, judge it, and cast it off for ever, for it is
of the old leaven of malice and wickedness. It has a life in giving heed to
reports, (yea false reports) against others, entertaining them, and reporting
them, thereby to cover it self as with a garment, that so it might be esteemed
and have the pre-eminence, and that others (whom it pleases) may be
dis-esteemed, slighted or undervalued. This spirit the Lord God will cast down,
and abase unto the nethermost Pit; it is a Robber of God, and a despiser of his
neighbor, it is very near unto the chains of darkness, in them to be reserved,
unto the day of great Judgment.

Therefore O Israel, follow thou the Lord thy God alone, who discovers the
very secrets of all hearts, and is the searcher, tryer, and finder out of every
false spirit, before whose presence, and in whose sight, all things that have
been hidden, shall be sought out, evidently seen, and made manifest unto the
ends of the Earth. For the day is come, in which no shadow of death, or dark
covering, shall hide the worker of iniquity and wickedness, though never so
secret. Therefore remember with whom thou have to do, (for all things are
naked, open and bare, before his pure eyes:) And see thou walk in the Light
of the Lord, which is the Light of his true Israel, and remains their standing
dewlling place, which shall be for a flame, and an everlasting fire in the
hearts of all them who wilfully and contemptuously transgress against him, and
comes not to be humbled because thereof, before him. This is thy God and Lord
which brought thee up (at first) out of Egypt (the dark Land) and has led thee
by a way thou knew not; who gave thee water in the desert, and Manna in the
wilderness, who was as a Gloud by day, and as a Pillar of fire by night, and
who by little and little, did drive out the many strange Nations, that thou
might inherit the promised Land, which remains (for ever) a Rest for the
People and Seed of God.

Now he called thee not out of Egypt, in the day of thine afflictions, and
grievous burdens, sighs, groans and tears, when thou cryedst to go forth to
sacrifice unto him, that thou should return, or make thee a Captain, to go
back again to the house of bondage; but that thou should be a redeemed, holy,
peculiar people unto himself, zealous for truth, righteousness, and every good
work. And thou may remember, that thou were charged (in that day of thy
entrance into the good Land) that thou should not worship, nor bow down, to
any of the Gods of the strange Nations, whom he drove out before thee, neither
give your sons to their daughters, nor your daughters to their sons in
Marriage, least it become a snare unto thee, and steal away thine heart, from
wholly following the Lord thy God, which brought thee up from the land of
darkness, or out of the North Country, where thou were driven and scattered
upon the cold, cloudy and barren Mountains, as sheep without a shepherd. Was
not this thy state, O Israel, in which thy God sought thee, and found thee? and
was not this the acceptable year, and the appointed time, or day of salvation?
Did not thou rejoice (as a poor captive bound in chains) to be delivered?
what would thou have promised, or what could thou have done, or left
undone, in those days, for his sake who then appeared for thy deliverance?
Did thou not say in thine heart, that this God should be thy God, if he would
but give thee bread to eat, and raiment to put on, when he called thee as a
woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, when thou could have put thy mouth in
the dust, if there might have been but hope? When thou fattest trembling upon
the ground, and lookedst every way without for a comforter, and when thou were
as at thy wits end in thy wearisom toyls, troubles, and anguish of spirit; then
did not the Lord hear thy cries, and remember his Covenant, which was made to
Abraham, and to his Seed for ever, and see thine afflictions, and come down to
deliver? And did not thou rejoice like them in Harvest, at the appearance or
breaking forth of this Morning? were not thou ready to call in thy neighbors
to rejoice with thee, when the Lords money (on which his Image is) was found,
in thine own house. And the sheep that was Lost brought home upon shoulders of
the good Shepherd, who laid down his life for their sakes; And when the Lord
withdrew his presence, for a little moment, was not thine heart troubled? and
could thou be satisfied, till thou had found him again, whom thy soul
loved? And when thou had found him, did thou not say (in thine heart) This
is my beloved, this is my friend, I will hold him fast, and not let him go,
until he has brought me into the house of her that bare him, (or into the
Land of rest, in which is peace, joy, comfort, and satisfaction for evermore)?
Did not thou rejoice, when Moses came to Pharaoh, (King of Egypt, the Land of
Bondage and Darkness,) and Charged him to let thee go, though it were but three
days Journey into the Wilderness, because of the heavy Burdens and sore
Afflictions, which thou enduredst, under the oppressing Taskmasters of the
uncircumcised? But did thou think what would befall thee in the Wilderness,
the many holes, and pits, and turnings among the wild beasts, in drought,
hunger, and sore travel? Yet how did the Lord allure thee, and then many times
spoke comfortably unto thee; And led thee by a right way, though it seemed hard
and strange unto the murmurer, and to that spirit which would have made a
Captain, to return back into Egypt, (that Land of Darkness and Bondage,) on
which the plagues were poured forth, because of the oppression of his seed.

Therefore hear O Israel, and consider; who is a God like unto thy God? or what
man was able to do these things which the Lord has done for thee by his own
Arm, which he stretched forth and revealed in the midst of thee; who gave thee
Precepts, Commandments, Statutes, and Judgments, to direct, guide, counsel,
instruct and strengthen thee in the way thou should walk, which is none
other, then that which first appeared for thy deliverance; though its Name, was
then known no greater, then I AM, or the Light of Israel; which did after
become a flame, and the holy One, as a fire, to consume and destroy, his and
thine enemies round about; This is he who said, I am God, I change not,
therefore the sons of Jacob are not consumed. This is thy God, who commanded
thee, saying, Thou shall have no other Gods but me, nor make, form, or grave,
any likeness, or Image, to bow down unto; For I the Lord thy God, am a Jealous
God, and will visit the iniquity and sins of all them that transgress against
my Commandments. Therefore take heed, that thou bow not, or give thine heart,
mind, and affections unto any thing, visible or invisible, but to the Lord thy
God alone, whose Name is but one, and changes not, even the Light, which makes
manifest all things, and divides the Darkness from it, and has no fellowship
with the unfruitful works, and workers therein; but does reprove them, though
never so secret, and will not hold him guiltless, who takes his name in
vain: And all they who depart not from iniquity, and whose tongues are not
bridled, ruled, or subjected by the power of the Lord, and who are not thereby
guided, in wisdom, meekness, and fear; such, take the Name of the Lord in
vain, such are guilty, and shall so appear, before God, Angels, and men. For
(as I said) the day hastens, in which no shadow of death, or secret dark place
(though as deep as hell, or as high as the stars of heaven) shall be able to
hide the worker of wickedness, under the fairest Covering; The mouth of the
Lord has spoken it.

Therefore again hear, O Israel, and repair with speed every man to his Tent,
and none look out, but all feel and see the glory of the Lord God, which is
like devouring fire at thy Tent door, (burning up all that which is contrary to
him) that thou may be preserved, in this day of the Lords Passover; who is
not only passing over, but also through the very hearts, reins, and
Consciences of the Children of men, with his grounded Staff; yea, even
searching and trying to the ground, and bottom, of all foundations, and
buildings; And he will fight with the contrary (the dark mountains, the false
foundations, and deceitful Coverings) with Battles of shakings, of totterings,
of stripings, and rentings; yea, the veil shall be rent from the top to the
bottom, though it be in the very Temple it self, that they that have lain in
their graves, may arise, and come forth, and that he might appear before the
eyes of all, to be the Son of God, in whom is no guile, who humbled himself to
the death of the Cross; and through it, came to Triumph over principalities,
and powers, and spiritual wickedness, in high places. This is thy Captain, O
Israel, therefore think not of another, nor make another, nor form any
likeness of him, or of any thing, in heaven, or in earth; for there is not
another whom thou art to worship, follow, or subject unto, but him alone, at
whose presence the vails rent, and the dead arise, and at whose Birth, and
coming, the heavenly host sing for Joy, but the Tribes of the earth mourn,
(he that has an ear to hear, let him hear) who is now come with power and
great glory, in the Clouds of heaven, (not of the earth) to reward every man,
equally, according to his works, and words, without respect of persons; For he
is a righteous and just God; he is not as a man that he should change, alter,
or vary from what he was in the beginning, who by his power is able to raise up
Children unto Abraham, (at this day) of them that have lain among the pots;
Therefore let your eyes look toward his holy place, whence he arises, to
silence all flesh before him; and cease from man, whose breath is in his
nostrills, and is as a worm and dust before him.

And know this, that thy God, who raised thee to be a people above all the
Families of the Earth, and has given thee great dominion; that, if thou shall
exalt thy self, and say, This thou have done, and the other thou have done, and
secretly take the honor and glory to thy self, and listest thine hear up, out
of the uprightness and integrity before him; and shall slight his mercies, and
not walk humbly in his sight, but forget his wonderful works, and to ascribe
the glory (...) unto his Name; That he then is able to rent the Kingdom from
thee, and give thee a beasts heart, and drive thee out to seed with Oxen, even
among the beasts of the field; And this God will manifest (on such,) as he has
diverse times, amongst the sons of men, That all flesh may fear and tremble
before him, and bow at his Name (which must and shall be exalted above every
Name,) and ascribe acknowledgments of mercy, righteousness, power, and glory,
unto him for evermore.

For this is the same God, that set a Print upon Jobs heels, and marked all his
steps, (whose Candle had shined upon his Tabernacle, and unto whom the Rock had
poured forth Rivers of Oil,) whom, when he came to see, how great and how
powerful, how excellent, marvailous and wonderful, the Lord was in his
unsearchable ways, he ascribed all the righteousness to his Maker, and
abhorred self in dust and ashes, though he knew his Redeemer lived, and that he
should stand upon the earth at the latter day: Therefore take heed that thou
never depart from him, (from his leadings, counsels, commandments, wisdom and
fear) who has set a Print upon thine heels, and who marketh all thy steps,
though never so many, or in the most secret hidden places; whether thou
steppest in Butter, or upon a Rock, the Lord sees all thy goings, and unto him
thou must give an account for all thy ways, by whom actions are weighed.
Therefore, O Israel, Look not unto man, look not unto man, but alone unto him
who is thy salvation, and the salvation of all his people to the ends of the
earth. For if thou do but a little stand still, and consider thy self, in what
state the Lord found thee, and how helpless thou were of thy self, or of any
man, but by the power of God; And then again, how the Lord alone heard thy
cries, and remembered thee in the dust, and with his own Arm brought salvation
unto thy desolated soul; I say, when thou Considerest these things, in the
depths of Gods Counsel, with what eye can thou look unto man, then with an
eye that God has opened to see all flesh to be grass, and the glory of it as
the flower of the grass; when the Spirit of the Lord blows upon it, it soon
fades away. So unto him, who commanded Light to shine out of darkness, and
gave light into thy dwellings, let every soul within thy Camp, O Israel, be
subject; and ascribe all Glory; for he is the first, and he is the last, and
besides him there is no God, that is able to deliver thy soul from death, and
thy feet from falling. Amen.

Concerning Government in Families, etc,
AND now hear, O ye Tribes of Israel, even all you, who are Masters, Parents
and Governors of Familyes, or Teachers of children, and young people. This is
the word of the Lord unto you all; take heed to your own spirit, and see in and
with what spirit you rule and govern; for all who are not in the Spirit of the
Lord, cannot serve him, nor be serviceable to him in their several places, and
amongst their several Familyes, Tribes, and Congregations; unto whom every
particular must give account of his Stewardship: Therefore see that ye walk and
live, and rule in the Spirit, power and Wisdom of God, in the still, quiet, and
cool spirit; in which every thought is weighed, and judged; and in it watch for
the Seed, and its appearance when it arises in them all, amongst whom ye are
placed, and reprove, exhort and correct in the Dominion of God, and in the
Wisdom, and Patience of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in due time and season,
even in the feeling of the Leadings of the Seed of God in your selves. And for
the Seeds sake, and the Lords sake, (who searches your hearts) and wait for
the raising of it up, in all your Familyes, that it may be Head and Ruler, in
and among you all; that the blessings of the Lord God may be upon you, and his
presence may bless your Familyes, that ye may be a blessing and refreshment one
to another, and be refreshed one in another, even in the Love and Life of God,
which is but one in all. And rule not with rigor, for that savours of the Land
of darkness: Nor in a wrong Dominion, in conceitedness, self-willedness, or in
an impatient brittle spirit, but in the Wisdom of God, which is first pure,
then gentle and peaceable; in his fear and dread, and in love and meekness, and
in uprightness of heart and mind, as in Gods sight, doing all things as unto
him, (who sees in secret, and will reward openly); For the Seed is soon
oppressed, and the evil is soon strengthened, by a wrong Government, out of the
true Wisdom, in the wrong Authority; and it will cry to God in Servants and
Children, when it is grieved and oppressed, and God will hear it; and it will
witness against such Parents, Masters, Rulers, or Governors, as do not answer
it in the Wisdom and Love of God, in their Ruling, and Governing, Reproving, or
Correcting; for it is the even Balance that will let them see and feel, (as
well as you) when the weight is short, or when it exceeds in all your words,
actions, and carriages; and then the evil being present, it will take advantage
thereby, and an hardness and stubbornness will increase, in and among them, and
a liberty and strength in all manner of evil, when the witness of God is not
answered, and the seed raised, which would scatter all such things.

Therefore great is your Charge (who are Masters, Parents, and Governors of
Familyes) and great should be your care and diligence, for the suppressing and
keeping under the rebellious and wild nature, and the cherishing and
strengthening the good part, in all your Familyes, from the least to the
greatest: For that is Gods, who will call you to account, how you have answered
it, and been careful, that you have not hurt the least appearance of it: And
whether you have been as tender of it, as the Apple of your eye, for so is it
unto the Lord, who will plead its cause with all its Oppressors and Grievours,
(within and without) without respect of persons.

And when you exhort, admonish, or correct them, or find a cause so to do, then
wait you upon God, to feel his presence and Seed to lead, govern and go before
you; that Christ Jesus may be your Head, and have the pre-eminence, and the
Government upon his Shoulders (whose Right it is) in all things. And let your
words be few, seasoned in the savor of the Power, and pure, gentle, wisdom of
God, cool, quiet, and low, and not loud and clamorous, heady, or wilful, for
that savours of the foolish woman, whose feet are without, which builds not
her house, but pulls it down with her hands, but the wise, builds it up, to
the praise and glory of God. So let Christ (whom you profess) be known, and
exalted Head, in, and among, and over you all, even the power and wisdom of
God. Then will the Lord be honored, and the Seed answered, and the evil be
kept under, by him whose right it is only to Reign and Govern, among the
children of men. And take heed that for want of watchfulness, circumspection
and wisdom, ye do not discourage the tender appearance of truth and sobriety in
your Children, or Servants, or any under your Government; by reproving before
others, or out of due time, for that may, and will, hurt and grieve the Seed,
and beget evil thoughts, stubbornness, and an answering again, which will arise
in the corrupt part, which cannot straightway be justly reproved, because there
was want of the right Authority, Wisdom, and discretion, in the Reprover;
though something was reproveable, yet the want of a due and right management
thereof, will strengthen the bad (with a witness) against the error in the
Reprover. And so here the work is not rightly done for God, in your places,
neither can it, without Christ's leadings and guidance therein, who is the
wisdom and power of God, out of which there is nothing done, right
serviceable, or acceptable unto the Lord; but in it, the heart is made wise, to
discern both time and judgment.

And take heed, ye do not secretly seek to bear rule over others by your means,
or because you have more of this worlds goods, (which is all of the earth, and
returns to the earth from whence it came,) for that is the leaven of the false
Prophets, and false spirit, against which the woes are pronounced, because it
is an oppressor and secret persecuter of the Seed. And God will abase that
spirit (where ever it is) even in the sight of men, and bring it into shame and
contempt. For it secretly accepts persons, (despising the poor, and admiring,
or extolling the rich in this world. And thou who do so, (whosoever thou art)
shall come into poverty, and want, and be contemned and dis-esteemed, and cast
out from amongst the children of him, who had not whereon to lay his head,
(except thou repentest and be humbled before his Throne) For what have thou? or
what art thou more than another? either inward or outward, which thou have not
received, or have by permission (to try thee) from the Righteous God? to whom
thou must give account, who will change times, seasons, and the state of
things, People or Nations, as he pleases. Therefore be low, and fear before
him: For he will smite all the proud, covetous, and hypocrites, with an
irresistible stroke, whose ways are an abomination unto him.

Neither be thou self-conceited, or lifted up in thy thoughts, because thou
have known more, or been convinced longer than others, or have done more, or
endured, or suffered more than others have, least the evil eye (spoken of) thou
come to see with, and thy light be turned into darkness: For God can and will do
what he please with his own; And many that are first, shall be last, and the
last shall be first (as it is written). Therefore blessed is the man or woman
that dwells in the sense of Gods mercies, and their own nothingness, inability
and weakness; For this shuts out the Pharisee, that would shut up the Kingdom,
which will not enter it self, nor suffer that which would. So my Friends,
Remember, he enjoyed the Kingdom who was little in his own eyes; but when
disobedience prevailed, the Dominion was lost, and condemnation and trouble
came over that which had disobeyed. And this is just and right with God, who
does and will render unto every one according to their words and works.
Therefore dwell low, dwell little in your own eyes, as the little Child, (for
of such is the Kingdom of God, and such only have the Right, Authority,
Dominion, and Throne, given them of God, for so it pleases him;) And in this
ye will answer, and reach to the seed of the Kingdom in all your Familyes, and
in all People. Here ye will not hurt the tender, nor break the bruised Reed,
neither strengthen, nor countenance the wild, stubborn, and froward in their
ways; but your very life will reprove them, though not a word be spoken. Here
you Rule (in the true Dominion of the Lamb) over the Beasts of the Field, the
Fowls of the Air, and the Fishes of the Sea, as it was in the beginning, in
the Image of God, in the blessed state; in which dwelling and being good
examples, ye will teach more in one hour, than a thousand words every day in a
whole year without it, and the witness of God will arise in them, to justify
you in the one, and to judge and condemn you in the other.

Therefore take heed with what spirit you Rule in your Familyes; for if Christ
be not Head, then is that which is contrary, which he will consume, and destroy
by the spirit of his mouth, and by the brightness of his coming: And if he be
not your Head, Lord and King (who rides meekly upon the wild Ass Colt) in the
particular, who are Governors or Masters of Familyes; how then are your
Familyes his Familyes? and how are you of his household, if Christ Jesus be not
the Householder or Governor in and among you? And how are you then of his
Church, if he be not the Head, and Ruler, Instructor and Leader of you in all
things, (who is the Leader of his People Israel?) Consider these things (my
Friends) for of the Lord am I constrained to write them, for his holy Seed and
Name sake, and for his Truth and the souls of People sake, which are greatly
oppressed, grieved and vexed, by a wrong Government among Children, Servants,
People and Nations. And let none be secure or careless, without the feeling of
the pure presence of God, leading and guiding them in wisdom, love, and peace,
which keeps the Heart and Affections alive, unto the Lord God of Truth (whose
Throne is Heaven) and dead to the Earth, dead to the world, and the things of
it; for who comes to be careless, and at ease in the flesh, little regarding
those things before mentioned (even Gods name and Seed in themselves, and
others) are bad examples to such, who are young, simple, and tender, and
stumbling blocks to such as are to be gathered, in this day of Gods mighty
power, in which he will plead with all flesh, without respect of persons; who
will remove the Candlestick of them that have forsaken their first love, except
they speedily repent and do their first works; and will spue the lukewarm out
of his mouth, (as loathsome and burdensome unto him). And this is the Word of
the Lord unto such, whose zeal will perform it; and the day is at hand, in
which he will come quickly, and fight against them with the sword of his mouth.

Therefore let all be awakened, and see where ye are, and what spirit ye are
of, and how the work of God goes on in the particular, and amongst you; and
whether your affections be on things above, and not on things of the earth; and
whether your life is in Christ, the Seed, the Truth of the Most High God, and
whether you follow the Lamb, in whom is found no guile, whithersoever he
leads; If you do, then are ye the wise Virgins with the oil in your Lamps,
seeing with the single eye, as God sees, who is no respecter of persons, who
has chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, (mark, rich in that which
purifieth the heart, and gives victory over the world, which justifies in Gods
sight) and heirs of his everlasting Kingdom: Then you love in the love of
God, which is unfeigned; Then you judge all things as God judges, in his
infallible righteous judgment, and not before or without him, who is Lord and
Head over all, to his Church. Friends, I preach the Cross unto the world, and
to the nature, spirit, and ways of it (without respect of persons) in the
sense of what God is doing, and will shortly bring to pass, that no flesh may
glory in his presence. And this I say to you all (within the Camp of Israel)
who are of the mixed multitude, that came out of Egypt, and yet love the
Garlic; and the fleshpots thereof, that love the earth, and sticks in the
earth, and saves self alive, and hides from sufferings, (for fear of losing
the earth, or your reputation among men,) you follow not the Lamb of God, in
whom is no guile, who humbled himself to the death of the Cross, for the Joy
that was set before him, who made himself of no reputation, and had not whereon
to lay his head, who set his face like a flint, because of truth and
righteousness, against all unrighteousness, hypocrisy and wickedness
whatsoever, without respect to the persons of any, possessions, or places of
any; For which end he was born, and for which end his followers are born, (who
feel him born within them) even to witness for the truth, and to stand up upon
the Earth, and plead for it; and suffer patiently for the Testimony which they
hold, till the Spirit of life from God arise in the Consciences of ungodly and
wicked men, to plead his own Cause with them. You, I say, who are of that
spirit, of self-saving, you have, and shall have your reward, as the Pharisees
had, as the mixed multitude had, and as the murmuring Israelites had; God gave
them their hearts lusts, (seeing they desired it) but sent leanness into their
souls. This is your state, therefore take heed and be awakened, and retire back
to the foundation of God, out of the earth; for the Lord will cross you, and
vex you, by rolling the earth out of its place, and will abase your reputation,
and bring you into shame and contempt, til you know that the Most high rules
amongst men, and governs in the Kingdoms and Authorities amongst men and
people, who is higher then they, whose the Earth is, and the fullness of it, and
not yours; you must give an account to him, how you have ordered it, and used
and improved it, to the praise and exaltation of his Name, and the help of the
true woman: For the earth and heavens are hers, and the Child's which she brings
forth to govern the Nations, and you are but as worms and Grasshoppers in Gods
sight, who can crush you, and tread down the high places of the earth in a
moment, and rebuke and break in pieces the strong Nations in a moment; and this
is the Lord God of heaven a doing, that all people may fear and obey him; And
these things are coming to pass, and will be accomplished by him that
respects not the persons of men, but will reward every one according to his
ways.

And my friends, Judgment has begun at the house of God, but greater things
then many have yet seen, are approaching, for a short work will the Lord make
on the earth, for his oppressed Seeds sake, and for his great Name sake,
amongst you, and in the world; therefore expect you not great and final
destruction, to come upon the wicked without, until the Temple is nearer
built; For I tell you nay, you must first be faithful followers of the Lamb,
if you would see your Conquest over the Beast, Dragon, Whore, and false
Prophet, (the Antichrists) without, you must first see it, and your victory
over the world, and the spirit of it (through faith and patience) within; for
this way it comes to pass, that no flesh should glory, but be abased, even to
the dust, from whence it came; And this have I seen, in Gods secret Counsel,
even how he will accomplish his great work among his people, and how he will
destroy his and their enemies with a final destruction, even like a
whirlewinde when once it arises.

Therefore my friends, Gird up the loins of your minds, watch and be sober,
and wait always upon God, and feel your hope to the end, and be not hasty,
but remember the days of Noah, how the Lord was long-suffering, till the Ark
was finished, then came the Flood upon the world of the ungodly. And thus is
the son of man come, and his long-suffering to usward (who obey his voice) is
salvation. Let him that reads understand; For as it was in the days of Noah,
even so is it now at the coming of the son of man; blessed is the eye that
sees, and the heart that understands, and keeps out of that eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, building and planting there spoken
of; For much that is joined together, must be separated, and scattered, and
much that is builded and planted, must be thrown down, and plucked up by the
roots, and the earth must be burnt up, and the Elements melt with fervent heat;
For hot will be the day, in which all the ungodly shall become as ashes under
the soles of the feet of the Saints of the Most high, and in which the sons of
Levi shall be purged and purified as fine Gold; which day is but as it were
begun amongst many, but it draws near, and hasteneth greatly; Therefore
blessed is that wise servant that is always ready waiting for his Lord, and
who is giving his fellow servants mean in due season, and do not ear and
drink with the drunken, nor smite his fellow servants; for on such the day will
come unawares, and in an hour they think not of. And this has the Lord God
Almighty proclaimed, which shall sound a certain sound throughout all the
Tribes of Israel, and to the ends of the Earth, Amen.

So this I have written in obedience to the Lord, that I might be clear of
their blood whom it chiefly concerns: and concerning whom it came into my
heart from God, to lay these things before you; For I have desired of the Lord,
to direct me aright in all things according to his will, and I labor to keep
my Conscience void of offense toward him and all men; and I travel and pray to
God, that I may finish my Course with Joy, and give up my account daily, and at
the last with joy, and not with grief; And this (God knows) is the hearty
desire of my breathing soul unto his Throne for you all, that with one mind
and heart, we may all press forward, in the same way, which is the steps and
path of the just one, that leads more and more unto perfection, out of the
imperfection, out of the earth, out of the darkness, and the old leavens, into
Paradise, where man was made a living soul, in the image and likeness of his
Maker, (where the Dominion is known, and the Blessings enjoyed, which makes
rich, and the pleasures at his right Hand, which last for ever) unto whom my
soul ascribes all glory, praise, honor and thanks, who is worthy of all, to
whom be it for ever given, by all that feel Breath in the land of the living.

And now, all ye dear and tender breathing Babes and Children of the most high
God, whose hearts and understandings the Lord has opened, who have cast down
all your Crowns at the feet of the Lamb, who have forsaken, and can forsake
all, for his sake in whom is no guile, who have obeyed his voice, and
faithfully follow him in the Regeneration, who love not your lives unto death,
for his sake that was slain from the foundation of the world, because of the
sweet savor of his precious ointment, which you daily feel poured forth into
your vessels; Ye only are the wise Virgins, ye are the Redeemed from the
Earth, and are not defiled with women, (the weak and beggarly things.) And this
is the word of the Lord God Almighty, that lives for ever unto you all; The day
of your Redemption, the day of your sitting upon Thrones, the day of shouting
and of singing Halelujahs for joy, is at hand, in the triumphant Dominion of
the Lord God Omnipotent, over all flesh and unclean spirits, over the raging
waves of the Sea, in the midst of the greatest storms, yea, over Death and
Hell, and the Gates of it, which shall never prevail against you, as you abide
on the Rock, as you inhabit the Rock; you shall sing praises, yea high praises
unto him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever, who is
worthy to receive power, wisdom, riches, honor, glory and blessings for ever
and ever over all in the Highest, Amen, Halelujah; who gives you the victory;
Therefore faint not, for unto you this is the word of the Lord God, who lives
and reigns for evermore. Amen.

Israel is commanded not to meddle with Physic, or Physicians, etc. for any
disease or distemper, without the Leadings and Counsel of the Lord their God,
etc.
Dear Friends;
I Am commanded of the Lord, and it lies upon me, (in the fear of his Name, and
in the bowels of his love) to warn and charge you whom it concerns, (that I may
be clear in his sight) of these particulars following, viz. 1. All you who (in
this great day of judgments and trials within and without) feels any
distemper, weakness, sickness, pains, or any disease whatsoever; -- Seek not to
Physicians, without Gods eternal motion, or in the clear freedom of his life,
nor let out your minds in an eager seeking a remedy to any man, people or
things outward, but as the living God alone guides you, who is a present help
in time of trouble, to all his children that wait upon him: And know ye this
for a surety, that the Lord our God has made known the Tree of Life again
(unto his babes that fear him) which is in the midst of the Paradise of God,
whose virtue heals within and without, blessed and praised be his holy name for
evermore: Therefore all ye who profess the knowledge of God, and faith in
Jesus Christ, now try your selves and your faith, concerning these things, for
if you truly know God, and Christ (whom he has sent, to be a Prince and a
Savior,) and your faith stands in the power of God (and not in a sound only)
then you know the Tree of Life, and him that gives us life and breath, and all
things: Mark, and if he gives us all things, then he gives wisdom,
understanding, and counsel to his people, in all things needful, how to walk,
act, or speak in all occasions, and at all times and places, (who guides the
meek in his way, and teaches the humble in judgment.) Therefore I say, wait
you upon God alone, in the pure fear of his name, for counsel and instruction,
in this particular, if you love the peace of your own souls, and seek not any
thing for a remedy, but in his leading, counsel and wisdom, and in the faith
of Gods Elect; for if you do, it will add to your trouble, and sorrow, and
distemper; its the Word of the Lord unto you, which you will know fulfilled in
the end.

Therefore my dear Friends, Dwell in the Light, which makes all things, states,
and conditions manifest; and wait upon the Lord in the still, cool, and quiet
spirit, for the right understanding of your own particular state, and the
ground and cause of all distempers, diseases, or judgments, in your own
particulars; else how are you as the spiritual man, that judges all things, if
you know not the things of God, and what is in man, and the ground of all
distempers, diseases, and judgments? where is your dwelling with him that is
greater than Solomon, if you know not that wisdom, which gives the
understanding of all things, from the Hysop on the wall, to the Cedar in
Lebanon? how can you be wiser than Serpents? or how will you know the suries of
wild Beasts, and that which bounds and limits them, if you know not the ground
of all things in your own particulars?

Therefore I say again, Wait upon the Lord of life, and think not your time
misspent in so doing; neither give your selves rest till you in very deed know
Jesus Christ, who is the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden of God. For I
must say in the word of the Lord, many may be deceived with the apprehension,
or a name to live, and may profess and talk of him, and yet be dead and
ignorant of the true and right knowledge of him, and his ways; to whom he will
profess, he never knew them. Oh! that this fearful day and sentence may never
surprise any of you, who have tasted that the Lord is gracious. For many people
have been destroyed for lack of knowledge, and of a right understanding in
these things before mentioned, not knowing the intent of the motions of Gods
Spirit within them, neither discerning the Lords body; for since transgression,
disobedience, and ignorance of God (the cloud of error and darkness) has
overspread the world, the ground of these things have been hid to the children
of men; so that when the displeasure of God has been kindled against them,
they have not perceived it in the ground, in the particular; but were apt to
talk of it in a general way, that sin is the cause, (when great plagues and
judgments comes upon a people,) or the like; but scarce one man in a Nation,
did turn in his mind, and wait upon God, to see his will and counsel in such
things, in the particular; but such as did, (and obeyed the Lord) were
Prophets, who cried against such things in the general, as they had suffered
the indignation of the Lord for, (who had subdued them) in the particular. And
so the Lord God has often sent his visitations amongst the children of men,
and his Servants to warn them, that they might be awakened, and repent, and be
humbled before him, that so he might show them his way, and guide them in it,
(which is a way of holiness, mercy and truth;) and that they might always fear
and dread his great Name, and terrible Majesty, (who is able to do whatsoever
he will in the Heavens and in the Earth) and that they might (through his
judgments) come to be redeemed, and reconciled unto him in Christ, the
everlasting Covenant of life and peace.

Therefore my dear Friends, Wait you upon God, and let him be your fear and
your dread, then will you not dread man, or (rather) the furies of wild
Beasts, or Serpents, which is manifest in the sons of men; neither let in the
fear of death or any trial whatsoever, which tends to the vailing, or weakening
your tender life, which you have felt and enjoyed in God; but let the presence
of the Mighty God of worm Jacob, fill your hearts, (who is able to destroy both
body and soul in hell, and also to save to the uttermost all them that fear and
obey him,) that you may feelingly and perfectly know and understand (in the
light of the Lord) all things that comes to pass in your particulars; then
shall you be of a right and sound judgment, concerning all men, spirits, and
things in the general; for none can truly know the Cause, Ground, or Root of a
matter, originally, but who dwells in God, the Root that bears him (and all
men), the original of life; and he that does not know aright, may easily or
soon judge wrong. Therefore its the Saints only, (amongst all the children of
men) that are able, and can, and must judge the world: Mark, (who are
sanctified by Christ Jesus,) yea, such shall judge Angels who dwell in him, to
whom they all bow; for he is judge of quick and dead, and from him is no secret
hid, that shall not be manifest, For he is come near to judgment, (and is a
swift witness against all unrighteousness) and also his tender mercies and
blessings, are near the upright-hearted, which is to them as the former and
latter rain; but the rebellious dwell in a dry Land.

So be you all very still in your minds, and not will, or run, but diligently
heed the will and counsel of the motions of Gods good Spirit in you, (which is
the only Teacher of his people,) for he has said, My Spirit shall not always
strive with man; and he is the true Physician, Shepherd, and Overseer of the
soul; and will he not over-see and take care for the body (the lesser) by
giving wisdom and discretion how to order all his creatures to his praise? yea,
and this is witnessed among his babes, blessed and praised for ever be his
name, which is their strong Tower and Safety, Rock and Defense; and they need
not another, who are come to dwell in the Holy City, New Jerusalem that came
down from God, the quiet habitation, whose walls are peace, and gates praise
and salvation; here is no need of Candle, Sun, or Moon to give light, but the
Glory of God does lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And hither is
the Lord God of endless wisdom and compassions, bringing his little ones, that
believe and trust alone in him, who is becoming all in all, in his faithful
children; this is the sum (my Friends) this is that we have waited for, to
which end the Lord has long waited to be more and more manifesting his grace
and wisdom unto us, that we might come up hither by descending lower in our
selves, into him who is the root, and offspring; what shall I say of him? if
it can be born, I could say much in the infallible counsel of God, that he is
becoming the Father and Mother, Feeder and Cloather, Healer, Guider and
Governor, yea, all, (as I have said) unto his dear Lambs, who have long
breathed, and panted after him, and cannot be fully satisfied till this is
accomplished: No borrowed light, no Moon or Candle, will suffice the Noble
birth, but the very glory of God, and the marriage of the Lamb, to whom it
ascribes all, having received all out of the bosom of the eternal treasury of
the wisdom and compassions of the Allmighty. And so here is a cry heard, with a
loud voice from the Throne of God, and the Lamb, Cease from man, cease from man
(in all things) and come up hither ye traveling children, and you shall be
refreshed and satisfied; its I have heard your cries; and if men at any time
have had compassion on you, it was through my bowels, which I put upon him to
that end; therefore look unto me, and come, I am the fountain of all goodness,
mercy, and truth, says the Lord God, and not any man; for they are but as
Cisterns which may break, and then where will thou be for thy daily nourishment
and refreshment? These were the two great evils committed in the days past,
viz: They have forsaken me the Fountain of living waters, and hewed them out
cisterns, broken Cisterns, that could hold no water; for which the Heavens were
astonished and very desolate, and afraid. Is Israel a home-born slave? (read
Jer. 2.11, 12, 13, 14. and consider it perfectly, for the latter days of
considerations are come) as much as if God had said, Is Israel (who once
wrestled like a Prince, and prevailed, and had power with God, and with man,
etc.) become so ignoble, as to forsake me the Fountain, and be satisfied now
with Cisterns, that will hold no water? Oh! this was a horrible thing, these
were great evils; the very Heavens were astonished at this.

Therefore my dear Friends, (let this saying sink deep into your hearts,) See
that you always, in all things mind the Motions and Leadings of the Spirit of
Truth; for it is the true and perfect Guide, sent of the Father to guide us
into all Truth, and to show us things to come; and he that follows any man by
word, or example, and goes from this in himself, has committed a great evil,
even Idolatry, and is gone from the harkening and obeying; this is the
Witchcraft spoken of 1 Samuel 15.22, 23. and Gal. 3.1. This is not to be suffered
to live, or not to be lived in, in all Israel, Exodus 22.18. the Lord has
spoken it; for worm Jacob (who is now arising in the strength and pure wisdom
of his God,) is no more a home-born slave, to feed at Cisterns, or live upon
Husks, or to be deceived with any likeness whatsoever, but is filling himself
at the living Fountain of the Riches and Nobility at the right hand of the
Majesty on high; and so in vain is the snares laid in the sight of him that
has wings, that sees them, and is able to escape them; for there is a Remnant
that stands upon Mount Sion with the Lamb, in the innocent life, who are (and
can freely) come to God the Judge of all, and be ripped open, and stand naked in
the particular; and such is the Lord God clothing with white robes of his
everlasting Righteousness, which shall never wax old; glory unto him in the
highest, who has wrought all our works, in us, and for us. Amen.

So remember, the Spirit of truth is thy proper Leader, O Israel, in all things
concerning soul and body, at all times, places and occasions, and not any
other; Nay, though an Angel, (see thou do it not) for they are but ministering
spirits, sent forth for them that are heirs of salvation, and are
fellow servants with them who are led by the Spirit of truth, and are not to be
worshipped, or followed any further then is agreeable to the leadings of Gods
Spirit in thy own heart; for unto him thou must give an account, and not unto
Angels or men.

Now I do not hereby limit the Lord, nor his people, from exercising their pure
faith, in any thing concerning their state, either inward or outward; And as
for the things before mentioned concerning the health or weakness of the
outward man, I do know that there are natural and accidental causes of
weakness, sickness, or distempers, which are incident even to Gods dear
Children, (while in these earthen Tabernacles,) for which natural things may
be applied in the leadings of the life and wisdom of God, by which they were
created; I say, my intent is not, (neither am I joined to such a spirit,) as to
impose, or limit the motion of Gods Spirit in any thing whatsoever, but only
to limit the contrary, even the hasty mind and spirit, and that all may come
to be guided by the Counsel of God, out of ignorance and doubtfulness, into
clearness, and a perfect knowledge of their own state (as it is in Gods sight,)
and of the vertuousness of the power of the resurrection, of the holy Seed in
themselves; and not be led in blindness, and unsensibleness, in which state is
the error and mistakes, and wherein people are destroyed for lack of true and
sound knowledge; and here they have many things applied (and are apt so to do,)
even natural and visible things, for spiritual and invisible causes, I do not
mean an invisible distemper merely of the outward man, which may proceed from a
visible or natural cause: But when God by his Spirit, strives with man, in
him, and smites on his Conscience, by reason of sin, or some disobedience or
other, through which, the Lord beholds guilt, and cannot but punish, which
causes even the countenance to change, and brings judgment upon the very
creature, because thereof; I say, this shall never be removed (in the ground)
by any outward or visible thing; the Lord has spoken it: For it is striving
against the Creator, and the good end of his gentle chastisements with the
creatures, which he has created for his praise, and to be used in his counsel
and wisdom, by which they were all created, and have their being; so this
ignorant, wilful, impatient spirit, which cannot trust God, this is to be
limited, and bound down, by the dread and power of the Lord; that the innocent
Seed, (which can trust in him,) which has long suffered under oppression may
arise; in whose resurrection and life, is the healing and blessing of the
Nations that are saved, which are for ever to walk in the light of the Lamb.

So let all be subject to him, that gives life and breath, and all things, and
be not hasty (when any trouble or distemper comes) to be delivered, or to get
ease from under it, till thou (in patience) have seen the mind of God therein,
and be delivered by him that comes out of Sion, to turn away ungodliness from
Jacob; blessed is the eye that sees, and the heart that understands, and
contrives not any thing in the will, but as led and guided by the Shepherd of
Israel, who will not suffer his Lambs to lack any good thing for their body nor
soul, which in his wisdom he sees meet for them. And that which is not
subject, is the carnal mind, in which the enmity lodges, the death, trouble,
and condemnation; here the Lions lack and suffer hunger, but the meek shall
increase their joy in the Lord, and they that wait upon him, shall run and not
be weary, and walk and not faint.

And know this for infallible truth, that whosoever uses, or applies the
creatures of God, (even natural things, which are good in themselves and
places,) to a condition not suitable, even when God smites upon the Conscience,
for any disobedience or wickedness, by which (as I have said) the outward man
comes also to suffer, being partaker with the spirit that transgressed, that
this state is parallel to that mentioned Isaiah 22.12, 13, 14. When God called
for fasting, weeping and mourning, behold slaying of oxen and killing of sheep,
etc. which was iniquity that should not be purged till they dye.

Therefore dear friends, think on these things, (which are but as a touch of
what might be spoken, (but a word to the wise is sufficient) and wait upon the
Lord alone to be guided in all things, and do nothing hastily out of his fear
and counsel, which only is known, understood, and stood in, in the still and
quiet waiting, in the retiredness of mind and spirit, staid upon him, (out of
all your own willings and contrivings or runnings,) in the sinking down, and
subjectedness to his holy will alone; that he might be all, in you all, and you
as nothing before him, but vessels of his honor, praise, and glory; to whom be
it given over all. Amen.

No Babe in Israel to study for the attaining the Laws of men, to make their
defense, etc.
AND my dear friends, who have no knowledge in the Laws of men or Nations
(which are in the fall) and are in such things ignorant as children, this is my
advise unto you, from my God, and your God; do not now study or strive to
attain the knowledge thereof, in any case, to make your defense, when you are
brought before Rulers and Governors (or their Judgement-seats) for the Name
sake of Christ Jesus; for if you do, it will prove like Saul's Armor, (which
David (the Seed) cannot go out to war with) unless you have the knowledge of
such things already, (as a servant,) to use in the dominion and pure wisdom of
God; for this I have found, (who am also ignorant of such things as a babe)
That the Innocent Seed of Jacob need none to plead its cause, but God alone,
who gives strength and wisdom in the same hour.

Therefore my dear and tender Friends, Look not out from your own measures
received of the grace of God, which is sufficient; neither consult with flesh
and blood, by reasonings, disputings, or premeditations; but stand single and
innocent, eying the Honor and Glory of God, in his pure fear and true
humility; for in this alone is the Victory, Wisdom and Blessings obtained, and
God will not give it to another; for the Battle is the Lords, and we are to
stand still (in the Seed) to see his salvation; and then keeping low, this will
glorify its Father alone, as the Father has glorified it with Dominion and
Peace. And consider what Law or Learning David had, when he came from feeding
the Sheep, (being but a youth); and what weapon had he when he slew the
uncircumcised Philistine, more than the smooth stone in the Shepherds Bag, (he
that can read, let him) without Staff or Spear, in the Name of the Lord.

And they marvailed to see the boldness of Peter and John, who were ignorant
and unlearned men, in their Laws and Letters; and the Pharisees said, The
Disciples of Jesus know not the Law; and also of him, Whence has this man
learning, seeing he knows not Letters? Thus did God confound the wisdom of
the wise and prudent in Ages past, (as in this Age) who has always chosen the
foolish things of this world, that no flesh, or fleshly part should glory in
his presence.

Therefore Dear Friends, Let no Babe or simple one among you, be discouraged,
who are ignorant in the outward Laws and Letters; but keep to the Royal Law in
the heart, written by the Finger of the living God, in which you will feel the
springings up of the Royal Seed and Birth, which fulfils the righteous Law and
Letters (and was before the Letters and Laws of men was) whose heart trusts
only in the living God, and makes not flesh his Arm. This is the true Seed,
the Heir: But that which makes flesh his Arm, is the Seed of evil doers,
which shall never be renowned.

And so my dear Friends, in all things mind the leadings and counsel of God,
for he leads his people, and guides their feet in the way of peace; and he
alone is the saving health of all Nations, and without him they can do nothing
that is good and acceptable in his sight; and let your eyes be toward him who
is invisible, dwelling in the light; and neither act or speak out of his fear
and counsel; then will you be preserved, to his praise, and to your eternal
comfort and peace; and whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, let all
be done in the Faith, to the glory of God, (for what is not of faith, is sin,)
so shall you be kept steadfast on the unmovable Rock, through and over all
things which may come to pass, as your trials; and be upheld in the meek and
quiet spirit, which in Gods sight is of great price: And in this is the
Kingdom and patience of Jesus, and the victory of the Lamb, known, who must
Rule and Reign, till all his enemies are put under his Feet. Amen.

To the Blessed Seed, and Children of the Everlasting Holy Covenant, in the
Life of the Lamb of God, in whose mouth is found no guile, throughout the whole
Creation. A most dear and tender Salutation.
O Thou Blessed Seed of the promise, who have long lain as in the Clefts of the
Rocks, and have been as a stranger throughout the whole world, and yet lies as
a Lamb slain in the streets of Sodom and Egypt, spiritually; my soul breaths,
cries, and groans unto the living God for thy sake, and I am in sorrow, and
pain, as a woman in travel, because of thy great oppressions; who knows thy
sorrows, thy griefs, and thy secret complaints? who knows thy sighs, thy
groans, and thy tears, amongst the children of men (who art as a worm in the
lowest parts of the earth, bearing the weights and heavy pressures of the
iniquity thereof?) To whom can thou turn (to the right hand or left) to
unbosome thy self (in the depth of thy inward travels) but only to the living
fountain from whence thou sprang? O O thou Lamb of God, which takes away the
sin, and removes the foundations of the Earth; when will thou yet arise more in
thy beauty and glory among the sons of men? to bear the Government on thy
shoulders, whose right it is, That thou may lead them forth in the green
pastures, by the fountain of still waters; that thy innocence, tenderness, and
love unfeigned, might be known as the waters cover the Sea. For thou art
without guile, the alone pure, and undefiled one; thou art harmless as a Dove,
thou art the chiefest of ten thousands, thou art altogether lovely, the world
knows thee not; thou art as a Lilly among Thorns, and as an Apple Tree
amongst the Trees of the Forest; thy smell is as Lebanon, and thy taste
exceeds the Pomgranates: O thou fairest among the Sons, and thou beautifullest
among the Daughters! What shall I say of thee (O thou Beloved of my soul?) I am
even sick of love, my soul is even melted in the breathings of thy precious
life, and I am even ravished with love in thy presence, for thy Countenance is
exceeding the Angels of God; thou art terrible as an Army with Banners to the
ungodly; but thou delightest in the upright, humble, and contrite ones; thou
art my Savior in whom my soul rejoices, and my spirit does magnify thee, O
thou everlasting Son of Righteousness.

Arise, arise, shine forth in thy strength and glory, and drive back all the
Clouds of darkness which have covered the Earth, and the gross darkness
which has covered the People; that the glory of thy Light may enlighten the
world, and thy brightness may shame and confound the glory of all flesh, that
thy dominion might be known throughout the whole Earth, which is an everlasting
dominion, and thy Kingdom of Righteousness which has no end; that the Nations
may come to the glory of thy Light, and Kings to the brightness thereof, to
Rule in thine Eternal Counsel, Wisdom, Dominion, and Victory over all; that
songs of praises, deliverance, and triumph, for ever and ever, may be founded
unto thee, who wast dead, and art alive, and live for evermore, casting down
all their Crowns at thy feet, for thou alone art worthy to Rule and Reign, and
to have all Honor, Glory, Strength, Wisdom, Riches and Blessing: For thou
were slain because of our sins, and art now arising to redeem thy People out of
Kindreds, Tongues and Nations, by thy blood, and art becoming King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords, in us thy Babes and Children; thou art the Tree of life in
the midst of the Garden of God, by thy virtue must the Nations be healed; thou
art the Pearl of great price, thy worth is not to be valued with fine Cold;
thou art far above Rubies; thou have been a Treasure hid in the field, dwelling
in the lower parts of the Earth, and yet above the highest Heavens; both which
thou have upheld to this day, by thy power; thou art the Salt of the Earth, and
the Light of the world, though they have not known thee, but trampled thee
under foot, as a despicable thing; thy face has been marred more than any
man's, and thy form, more than the sons of men; thou art that Just One, and holy
Child, which has long been as a Servant, though by right, art Lord of all; on
thy back has the Ploughers ploughed long furrows; oh how have the Smiters
smitten, at the appearance of the lifting up of thy tender countenance? (When
this I have considered, my soul has mourned in secret, and mine eyes have
trickled down tears, in the sense of thy deep sufferings;) and yet, had it not
been for thy sake, the whole world had been as Sodom, and been consumed like
unto Gomorrah; Oh who will not now come down and suffer with thee, that they
may also reign with thee as Kings and Priests on the Earth? For now thou art
arising in the greatness of thy strength, to be avenged on all thine
oppressors. Thou have trodden the Wine Press alone, and of the People there
was none with thee: -- Therefore will thou trample them in thy fury, and stain
all thy Raiment; for the day of vengeance is in thine heart, and the year of
thy redemptions is come. Thou art the King of Sion, thou have the key of David,
(and the keys of Death and of Hell,) who ridest meekly upon the wild Ass
Colt, as in the days of old. Come forth now O ye Daughters of Jerusalem, and
behold your King, even the Lamb of God, which has been slain, in whose mouth
guile is not found, that takes away your sins, and follow him for ever, ye
Daughters of Abraham, and Sons of Jacob; for it is of the Lords mercy you are
not consumed, because his compassions fail not toward his Seed, but remains
sure in his Covenant for evermore, Amen.

Therefore now, all ye followers of the Lamb, be ye very still, low, and
watchful, dwelling in the pure dread and humility of him that sits upon the
Throne, and of the Lamb for evermore; and let none be careless or wilful,
least ye be found in the degeneration, from the spirit of the subjection of the
Lamb of God, who is come to Rule; but in his life stand you upon Mount Sion
with him, with the Harps of his high praises in your hands; for they only are
the chosen and blessed, who are faithful followers of him in the Regeneration:
So let your eye be single, and your minds retired, dwelling in the good
Shepherds Tent of Israel, hid in him, whom the world knows not, where you will
feel quietness to your immortal souls, and peace and patience to undergo all
trials; for this is a day of great and manifold temptations, and trials, in
which the enmity works, every way in its full strength, among the children of
men: but its violent force, is chiefly bent, as a mighty flood, or full
current, to sink and destroy the Ark of the Testimony of God; feel me in your
life, (within and without) ye dear children, ye simple-hearted, breathing
babes; who know the winnowings on every hand, and how the Tempter works, to
draw out the mind and affections one way or other, that he might get advantage,
to spoil your resting place, (which you have in the staidness on God, and
simplicity of Christ) and to keep the soul and understanding clouded in
darkness and unsensiblenesse, hardness and blindness, to be lukewarm,
careless or secure, without the feeling and present enjoyment of the pure
refreshing presence of Gods Countenance; then he has his purpose, (who seeks
to devour) for in the darkness is the root of disobedience, and every evil
word, and work; then the root of bitterness will spring up, through which many
may be defiled; then the self-will, which is crooked and perverse, arises
again; then the pure savor and discerning is decreased, and love waxen cold;
then the tender innocent Seed suffers; the Lamb is pierced and wounded, which
should have the pre-eminence; then strife in the high mind, out of Gods awe and
dread, gets up; then the Strong Man begins to keep the house again, who was
once bound, and his goods spoiled; then the meek, that should ride upon the
wild Ass Colt, is thrown down, and trampled upon by the wild; then Ishmael
and Esau (the ruff man) reign over worm Jacob.

God Allmighty keep all his Babes (who have tasted of his Heavenly gift, and of
the precious virtue of the endless life) out of this state. My soul is even
bowed down, and the travel of a burden is upon me, because of the deep
sufferings of the Holy Seed, and the oppressions of the poor, by him that is
too strong for him; O Lord arise, arise, and plead its innocent cause with all
flesh. O all ye breathing Babes of God, abide for ever in the pure subjection
to his good and perfect will, in his fear, and in tenderness of heart; then
how can you but partake of the afflictions of your Brethren, the seed of
Abraham?

It came into Moses heart (and that from God) to visit his poor afflicted
brethren, which cried and groaned under the cruel and heavy oppressions, and
God rewarded him according to his works; And now, can the Seed and children
thereof mourn and languish, or be sorrowful, and I not feel it? can they be
tempted and tried in the Wilderness, and I not sensible thereof? how can this
be, if I be in Christ Jesus, who is afflicted in all their afflictions. My
friends, it is a day of mourning, of weeping and fasting, (let the wise
understand) though in God I rejoice, that my Name is written in heaven, and
this is more to know, and feel, then if all the Devils without, were subject.

Therefore ye followers of the Lamb dwell in the sense and feeling of the life,
of the precious, tender, suffering Seed, that you may know the marriage of the
Lamb come, and rejoice greatly because of the Bridegroomes Voice, for this
makes glad the upright, and the weak to be as David; And here you will eat your
own bread from your Fathers hand, which he gives freely to the hungry soul, and
be kept out of all strife and debate, disputings and murmurings, in the gentle
contented Spirit of the Lamb, who is the saving health of all his people: Here
you will know the place of broad Rivers, where goes no Gally with Oars, no
toil, or labor, or striving, but to stand still: Here is the beginning known,
and the Glory that was before the World was, or the Hills, or the Foundation
of the earth were laid, (blessed is he that reads in the life of these
things): Here is the place of defense, as the Munition of Rocks, where the
bread is sure, and the water never fails, but issues forth from the Fountain
of the Paradise of God, for evermore: Here is the lying down under the Vine,
where none can make afraid: Blessings and thanks to him that lives for ever:
Here is the returning naked, as we came into the World, (even so we go out,)
carrying nothing, and yet possesses all things: Here Is the little child, that
enters the Kingdom, even that Kingdom (of Heaven) where the least is the
greatest, the lowest is the Highest, the poorest is the richest, the weakest is
the strongest, the simplest is the wisest.

Where is the disputer now? where is the gloryer in the strength, wisdom,
Arts, and parts (in the spirit of this world) now? Where are the wise, and the
Scribes, and the counter of Towers now? where is the high Professor, and great
talker in the strong Towers of comprehension and Imaginations now? where are
the climbers up above the Door now? Behold a little child is Governor, The
poor man (which was disregarded) delivered the City by (his) wisdom: He that
can read, let him; for God has made foolish the wisdom of this world, and the
seers are blind; The sounding brass is empty; the strong are become weak, and
the weak says, I am strong; they that were dead, are alive, and them that were
lively, are now as dead men on the Seashore; God is turning the world upside
down, the Lamb shall Rule, and all the Beasts of the Forest shall fear, and
bow before him; The Lilly shall grow higher then the Cedar, the beggar shall
sit upon the Throne, and the Counselor as in the beginning shall be known, and
Judges as at the first; Blessed is he that reads, understands, and enjoys
these things; Gods salvation and Covenant of eternal life and peace, is then
witnessed, who is the good Shepherd, and true Physician of his people. And this
is thy Captain, O Israel, who is made perfect, through sufferings; therefore
obey thou him in all things; follow him in his footsteps, who leads in the way
of Righteousness, that so thou may be partaker of the power of his
Resurrection, and possess thy soul in his patience, and lie down in his
eternal will, in the rest prepared, that so the second death, over thee, may
have no power.

So my dear friends, the Lord God of Life, preserve you all faithful, bearing
your single and pure Testimony for his holy Name, in this your day and
generation, that you may be the chaste Virgins, and entire followers of the
Lamb, in whose mouth guile is not found, that so you may give up your account
with cheerfulness, unto him who alone is worthy of all obedience, praises,
honor, and glory, over all, heaven and earth, world without end. Amen.

I remain a Traveller (in spirit) for the restoration of the oppressed seed of
Jacob, and am your brother, who (in your measures) are in the same tribulations
and patience of the Lamb. And unto you, this is the dear salutation of my
breathing life, in the Bowels of Gods love and mercies. And if in this, my
Testimony is finished, I am content, and made willing (for the joy and rest
that is set before me) to lay down the earthen vessel, which is called
