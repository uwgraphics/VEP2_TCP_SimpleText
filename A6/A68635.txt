The Chronicles of England and of diverse other realms: breuely compyled with
the pyctures and arms of all the kings of England sith the conquest.

Prologus.
WH^ so will read in auncyon chronicles and historyes / shall find yt after the
distructyon of Troy Eneas with his son Ascanius begotten of his wife (...)
daughter to (...) king of Troy / came into Italye and there married Lauina
daughter to king (...) of Latinus was there king and reyned.iii. year. After
whom succeeded (...) son (...) of Alba in Italye / and reyned there.xxviii.
year / and after Ascani^^ reyned (...) borne in ye woddes / and for y^ cause he
was called Siluius / which Siluius was (...) y^ reyned after in Alba. He was
also by some writers called (...) was (...) death of his father. Of this Siluius
there be diverse opinyons / for some say (...) to A^canius / ^ some hold yt he
was son ^o ^neas by his wife Lauina / and also some writers hold yt Lauina ha^
by Eneas a son called Ascaniu^* But whether yt Ascanius son to Eneas and Lauina
/ or Ascanius son to Eneas / and Crusa was the king of Latyns. There be diverse
opinyons but all writers agree that Ascanius was king of Latin next after Eneas
/ and that Siluius reyned next Ascanius / and was the.iii. king of Latyns after
king Latinus / of whom Romuius descended yt first bylded the city of Rome /
and of him took the name of Rome first / as after shall appear in the process
of this work.

And also of the beginning of ye inhabytacion of this realm of England
sometime called Britteyn / and before yt called Albion / there be diverse
opinyons we read in the english cronycle / y^ one Diocles^an king of Siriens
had.xxxii. daughters / which were married upon one day to.xxxii. kings / which
women all waxed stoberne and disobedyent / yt their husbands co^playned to
their father thereof / which father called them all to gether and therefore foul
rebuked the^ / but all they being incorrygyble waxed more froward and by one
assent ye same night after for anger slew all their husbands / and cut their
throtes / wherefore the said Dioclesyan was so sore moved / yt he intended to
put them all to death / but yet by the advise of his counsel refrayned that
and put them all in a ship in ye see and no another person with ther^ / which
women after by adventure a ryued here in this realm / which than was all
wyldernes and desolate of people / and called the land Albion after ye name of
ye eldyst sister called Albion / and after yt the devil taking bodies of ye
air and man's nature i^ other co^treys shed by polusyo^ / came and lay by those
women here and begat of the^ horrible Gyantes / which there co^tynued till ye
coming of Brute. But this story seems more meruaylous than true / and though
it has co^tynued here in england and taken for treuth among us englysshemen
/ yet other people do therefore laugh us to scorn / and so me seems they may
right well / and I marvel i^ my mind yt men having any good natural reason
will to such a thing give crede^ce / for no man can tell who is ye Auctour of
this story / nor of whom it should come / nor of any writer of name in this
land that ever wrote thereof. Nor also we read in no historyes of any other
country of any such king in Siria nor of any (...) story / which story if it
were true would have been put i^ writing by some historyer in ye same (...)
some other country / co^syderyng that in every country they write of many other
things of (...) wonder. And also a man having reason may well judge yt the
things not only unlike to be true / but almost impossyble yt a great king
should have.xxxii. daughters all to be married at one day / and also as unlikely
yt there should be.xxxii. kings married at one day. And also very unlike yt all
those women should be of so yuell disposicyo^ / and at one time so cruelly
minded to do such an abominable deed / but yt among all the^ there should be
one of those systers at ye lest somewhat disposed to goodness and to refrain
from ye doing of such a cruel deed (In the which I trow that women at this
day will take my part) and also very vnlykly yt such a ship coming from so
far a country should never touch land till it came hither / co^sideryng yt
the course is so long / above.iii. or.iiii.M. miles by see / and diverse other
lands and Ila^des between / and also ye passage so strayte and dangerous / yt
they must needs come through many stray^es and shawlles / and lykly to touch
land i^ many other places or they could come into this Occian see as they that
be seen in Cosmografye may well perceive by ye sight of the quart or Mappa
mundi. And also it stands another with good faith nor reason yt the devil should
by such manner engender with women which if the devil had such power than /
why should he not now have like power at this day / whereof now a days we se no
such generacyon / and also if ye devil had such power I se not why those
chylderne so gendred should be Gyauntes and excede all other in greatness /
co^sideryng that ye sede and the place where it was sown / was no another but
such whereof chylderne be engendered at this day / wherefore I suppose no another
but that it is but a feigned fable that this land should be called Albion for
that cause. But yet other writers of historyes there be / which say that this
land was first called Albion / by reason of ye white Cleues and rocks at
Dover which be seen far in a bright day / and was so called Albion of the
Latyns / as it were the white land / for Albus is latin for white. But
ferthermore how this land after that took the name of Britteyn there by
diverse opinyons / how be it y^ comen opinyons is that Brute son to Siluius son
to Ascanius son to Eneas which came from Troy / was ye first yt inhabyted
this land wha^ there was no people here but only Gyauntes / which saying we
have only of one Ga^tridus monumetensis / which wrote yt storye in the time of
king Henry the.ii. about ye year of christ.M.C.lxx. and as it appears by his
prologe / he directed his book to Robert earl of Gloucester / which was uncle to
the said king Henry / affyrmynge in the same prologe y^ one water Archedeacon
of Oxforde brought him a^ old book written in ye britteyn speech which he
translatyd in to late^ co^prehendi^^ y^ s^yd story of Brute al beit he writ^th
not ye name of ye book nor who was ye auctor thereof / but ye oldest writing yt
we read of a^ny auctor is ye book of ye co^me^taryes of Julius Caesar which
indytyd y^ work hi^ self at ye time when he co^queryd this land and made it
subject to the romans which was.xlviii. year before the birth of christ In the
which he took great dylyge^ce to dyscrybe the realm in so much yt he shewyth
plainly ^ truly furst ye form and facio^ of this la^d and ye quantyte thereof
how ma^ny mile it co^teyneth every wey how ye great ryuers re^^ and also he
dyscrybyth ye manner of ye use of the people how be it he spekyth nothing of
Brute nor for all the ^^rch that he made he cowd never come to the knowledge how
this la^d was furst inhabytyd Also Gyldas that wrote de gestis brittonu^ about
the year after the birth of christ.vi.C. and also holy Beda that wrote historia
ecclesiastica ge^tis angloru^ about the year ^^rist.vii.C.xxx speak nothing
that this Brute should be the furst inhabytor of this la^d sometime called great
brytteyn yet Beda writyth presysely in his said book that the furst ^n habytors
of this la^d that cawsyd it to be called brytteyn were the brytteyns that came
from little brytteyn tha^ called Armonica^ / and also that the Pictis that came
from cythia were the furst that inhabydid the la^d of skotla^d / Also we can
not find in the Chronicles of the Italyons nor of the romans that ever there
was any king called Siluius that had a^ny sych son called Brutus which should
sle his fader as Galfridus wrytith which thing men thynk if it had be true they
would have put that i^ their Chronicles as well as they did other thyngis of
less meruell co^syderyng that they touch and speak both of ascanius and of
Siluius and of all their chyldern and what became of them and how they endyd
that succedid the^ as kyngis / Also it is not only affirmid by ye said
Galfridus but also by diverse other yt the country of Gallia was gretely
inhabytid with people at ye sege of troy and long and many yeris before ye time
supposid yt Brute should enter this land of brytteyn wherefore diverse great
lernid men think it is not lykely but in manner inpossible that this land of
britteyn should be so long after that desolate with out people till the time
supposid of the coming of Brute co^sideryng that the rokkis and mounteyns about
dover be so great and daily opynly seen of them of Gallya and so small dystauns
a sonder and the sea so narrow that it may welbe sailed i^ less than.iii.
howris and this country of bryttayn so fair so plesaunt and so fertell that it
is most likely that the people of Gallia should come over other to fyssh or for
desire of knolege of the land and to make some habytacio^ therein and not to
suffer it to be all desolate and vnknowyn till the coming of Brute Therefore
some men at this day therbe which what for these resons and diverse other take
that story of galfridus but for a feyned fable supposyng that because this
galfridus was a welchman born that he should fayn that story hi^ self for the
only preys of his co^treme^ because we read of no writer of storis before his
dais yat ever wrote yerof or spekith of yis Brutus nor makith yerof no me^cio^ /
But yat not with sto^di^g I will not deny that story of galfridus nor I will
not precisely affirm it for all though that many men suppose it to be but a
feined story yet I will not let here in this littell work to rehearse hit some
what after galfridus seeing not only for this cawse that I would have every man
precisely to belefe it but because yt i^ the same story reding a man may se
many notable examples of diverse noble princes yt wisely and vertuesly gouernid
their people which may be an example to pri^cis now living to use the same and
also a man reding in the same shall see how yt the stroke of god fell ever
upon the people other by battle darth or death for their vice and misleuing
and also how diverse princis and great me^ exaltid in pride and ambicion using
tyranny and cruelte or else being neclyge^t in gouernyng of their people or
giffing them self to vicious liffing were ever by the stroke of god ponished
for the same yer fore according to my promise I shall breuely rehearse ye seid
story as here after i^ yis process does apere.

Also as to wchyng the beginning of the Frenchmen the common opinion among them
is it yt they were furst callid Sica^bri and yt they should descend of Ector of
Troy that is to sey of Francus or Fra^cion son of Ector which after the
distruccio^ of Troy ca^ in to gallia and married the daughter of Rhemus king of
gallia but as to that opinion I can another affyrm it nor deny but yet
according as the commyn opinion is most among them I shall reher^e it as here
after shall appear.

Also for the more plain explanacion of this present work they that list to
read herin must note yt before the birth of christ the namis of the kings of
Albaynis of whom the romans descendyd and also the romans stand ever in the
hyghyst part off this book and the namis off the brytteyns in the myddis and
the namis of the fre^chme^ stand beneth / And after ye birth of crist the namis
of the popis stand in the hyghyst part of this book above the romans and the^
the e^perours of rome / And next the brytteyns or Engleshme^ And next beneth
the^ he fre^chme^ / and next beneth them the dukis of Braban and Erlys off
flanders and afterward the Normayns stand lowyst of all as more pleynly shall
appear by their lynis and letters which well markyd shall dyrect you Justly
from one to a another

/ Capis siluius / Capetus siluius / Tiberinus / Agrippa siluius /
Capis siluius so^ of siluius Athis was next king of Latins and Albayns it is
said he byldyd Capia the great cite in Champyane but other writers hold that
it was furst called v^iternus / and when the samnytes took it / it was called
Capia after the name of their duke called Capia.

Capetus siluius son of Capis was next king of Latyns and Albayns.

Tiberinus siluius so^ to Capetus was next king of Latyns and Albayns he was
drownyd in ye water of Tybere whereof as some afferme that water took his name.

Agrippa siluius son to Tyberinus was next king of Latyns and Albayns.

Aremulus siluius so^ to Agrippa was next king of Latyns and Albayns he was
slain in a tempeste by lightenyng and thonder.

Aue^tinus siluius son to Aremulus was next king of Latyns and Albayns he was
slain and byryed in the mount auyntyn where of some say that hill took his name
but some sey it took his name of a flight of certain byrdys coming over it
which they said in laten de aduentu auium.

Procas siluius son to Auentinus was next king of Latyns and Albayns.

Amulyus siluius the younger son of Procas was next king of Albayns he expulsyd
his elder brother Numiter and slew Lansus his son and cawsyd Rehea his
daughter to be a nonne of sych an order that if she brake her vyrgynyte she
should dye but that not with stondyng she was gotten with child by one vnknowyn
and had.ii chyldern at a birth which after were called one Romulus another
Remus wherefore Amulius caused Rehea to be burned quik and the ^ii cheldern to
be cast in the water of Tiber but yet by peruycyo^ deuyne they were p^seruyd
and by the water side found alive by one Faustulus which norryshed them till
they came to age which chyldern than slew the said Amulius.

Ebrank / Brute greenshyld / Leyle / Ludebras / Bladud / Leyre /


Brute grenshelde called viride stutun reynyd after his fader Ebrank.xxx. year.

Leyle son to Brute reynyd next after he made the town of karlell in his time
Salamon made ye temple of Jerusalem this Leyle reynyd.xxii. year.

Ludibras son to Leyle reynyd after him he made the ceties of Canterbury and
wynchester and shaftisbury he reynyd.xxx. year.

Bladud son to Ludibras reynyd next he made the cite of Bath and as the story
seyth he was a great nigromancyer and by yt craft made there ye hot bathys but
other clerkis hold opinion that they come naturally of ye ground be cause there
be manny sych in other placis as in darbyshyer at boxtone and many other in
Italye and diverse other landis some phylozophers hold that ye cause thereof is
thus that wha^ there is a hot fume which perpetual comyth and fumyth out of
the yerth whereof ye may se manny of them by experyence in Italy which be ever
perpetually hot and fumyng and smokyng out of the yerth like wise as
welspryngis come out of the yerth perpetually / and when anny welspryng brekyth
out at any place of the yerth where sych a hot fume is nygh Ioyni^g tha^ if ye
hot fume be bygger of power the^ it will naturally make the water hot and
because ye hot fume and welspryng be both of their naturis perpetual / that
hot bath of water must be perpetually hot but whether men will believe the
history or the phylozophers every man is at his lyberte / This bladud
reynyd.xxi. year.

Leyre so^ to Bladud reynyd next he made ye town of Leycet after his name he
had.iii. daughters and because the eldest daughter Genoril said she louyd him
better than her life and the.ii. called Rogane said she loved him passing all
creaturs and the.iii. daughters called Cordell said that she louyd him as she
ought to love her father he therefore married his eldest daughter to the king of
skotland and the.ii. to the yerle of Cornwall nothing regardyng his yongist
daughter and gafe his hole realm and land in his life to his two eldest
daughters but ye king of france called Agamp herd speak of the bewty and
goodness of Cordell and took her to wife though ye father had nothing to gyfe
her / after this Leyr soiornyd with his eldest daughter a while with.xl.
knyghtis and squyeris waytyng on him so long till yt she was weary of him
wherefore he departed the^s and went to his other daughter in to Cornwall and
there soiornyd so long tell yt she was also weary of him wherefore he departed
preuely in to france to his yongyst daughter which there reseuyd him louyngly
and when king Agampe knew how unkindly his.ii daughters served him he sent
him over again with his daughter and agrete people with him which i^ strong
bateyl had ye victory and so Leyr had his la^d again and lyffyd after y^.iii.
year and i^ all reynyd.xl. year..

(...) Ancus marcius. Tarquimus pris^us. Sermus tullius. Tarquimus superbus


Numa pompilius a Sabyne born was next king of Rome / because there was often
dyscord between the Romans and Sabynis it was agreed that both countries should
be as one and the king to be chosyn by eleccyon and agreement of both people /
which Numa so chosyn gouernyd ye people by sych manner that he was without any
war during his life / wherefore the Romans incresyd meruelously both in
strenght and riches.

Tullius hostilius a romayn was next chosyn king / he made war against ye
Albayns and subduyd the king called Caius Ciuilius and b^e^t and dy^lroyed the

proud son to Tarquinius priscus was next king of Rome he was the furst that
vsurpid and took upon hi^ to be king without Eleccion of the people or of the
peeris. This Tarquinius superbus had a so^ callid Sextus tarquinius which
raueshid one Lucres wife to Tarquinius Colantinus wherefore this Lucres thinkyng
her self unworthy ever after to lie by her husband and in purging her self
because it was against her will in the p^lens of her husband and of diverse
other stykkyd her self with a knyfe to the heart for a perpetual memory thereof
to be had / for which cruel deed of Rauyshment done by ye said Sextus
tarquinius the romans did put down the se^d Tarquinius superbus from his
dignyte of kingdom and banyshyd him and all his children for ever / and after
they had ^ name of a king in as great hatred as the name of a thief / wherefore
instede of a king they made.ii. Cousulles to govern the peopu^l whose
Auctorytis should last but for one year.

Dictatours / Largius. Quintus Cincinatus. Co^sulles. Lucius iunius brutus. and
Tarquinius colatinus. Publius valerius publicola


Publius Valerius Publicola thus being consul made war agayns Tarquinius
superbus and slew of his people above ^xviM. for the which victory he was the
furst of the consu^lis that ever rod in a chariot Triumphant in the cite of
Rome he was a man of great Justice and equite and after that he had be.iiii
tymis consul he made war against the sabyns and dyscomfytyd them and the
prays and prycis that he took there brought to Rome / wherefore when he was
ded the people of Rome did spend the.iiii. part of there goodis at his beryeng
and cost at his funerallis / Also after that there was a new order and dygnyte
made among the romans which was called a Dictator a ^reter dygnyte above the
consullis which had auctorite to make ordynances and lawis and was as master of
ye people but this Dictator was chaungeable every half year / and sometime
after at every thryd year as some writers affirm / and some time at every.v^
year and when his yerys was past and he dyschargyd of his auctocyte he should be
than answerable to all byllis and complayntis that any of the people coud
alegge again him and ponyshed for every thing that he had done contrary to
Justice / therefore there was ever so good and i^dyffere^t Justice vsyd and had
among the romans that all the world spoke of the^ honor the executyng of which
good and indefferent Justice cawsyd them to grow in riches and to be of power
and strenght above a^ny people in the world / therefore would good it were so
vsyd at this day in the rea^me of England that every Judge and other officers
having auctoryte to execu^e ye lawis or to govern or to rule in a^ny office
should be remouable at.iiii. or.v. year or less and the^ to answer to all
co^playntis that should be allegid agayns him and to be ponished for every
offense that he had committid / in his rome and then there would not be so mich
extorcione and oppressione of the pore people nor so manny injuries as is now
adays / The furst that ever was Dictator in Rome was / was callid Largius and
with him was another chosyn to be master of ye chyualry of who^ ye furst was
called Spurius cassius Also after this there was one chosyn Dictator which was
called Quintus Cincinatus which was an husband man / which as he was dryfyng
his cart was required by the senate to take upon him ye dygnyte of Dictator /
which he refusyd but at the last they constraynyd him thereto / this Quintus
Cincinatus and one Lucius Tarquinius which was elect captayn of cheualry had
great victory of their enmyes / but this Quintus Cincinatus cawsyd all the
praise and pryses to be dystrybutyd to ye men of war nothing reseruyd to him
self thereof.

his fryndys in rome enteryd with his army with triumph and great pomp / and
anon took upon him to be called Dictator perpetuus and so made himself
emperor and Caesar and made great wart agayns his enmys of the Senators and

li / This Iue by the excityng of his wife Etheldreda which was an holy woman
and abbess of Berkyng gave up his kingdom to Ethellerdus his nevew and took a

where by the means of king wyllyam diverse bysshoppes / abbottes / and priours
/ english men were put down / and Normans put in their rowmes / to the
intent that ye king might stand in more suertye of the land. Also about
the.iii. year of his rain / Harrolde and Cauntus sons to Suanus king of
Denmark enteryd into the North country / and with the help of some of the
people of the country and of some of the cytezyns of york enteryd the city /
and slew mo than.iii.M. Normans. Sege at york.
But sone after king wyllyam chasyd them out / and drove them to their ships
and took such displeasure with the inhabytans of that prouynce / yt he distroyed
the land from york to Durham / that.ix. year after it lay vnlaboryd and
untilled / and the people there were kept so hard by the war of the king /
and in such famyne that they ete rattes / cattes / dogs / and other vermyne.
Also in the.iiii. year of wyllyam his reygne / Malcolyn king of Scotts entryd
into Northu^berlande and distroyed the country / and took many prisoners and
kept them like bondemen / but within.ii. years after king wyllyam made such

Also sone after Robert Courteyse duke of Normandye laid his dukedom to
plegge to his brother king wyllyam Rufus / for.x.M. li. and took his voyage
into ye holy land. Also in this time Malcolyn king of Scotts enteryd
Northu^berla^de / and there did great distruccyon: but yet after many
co^flyctes between ye king and him / Malcolyn was sworn to be obedient to king
willyam. The.iiii. year of his rain a great wind was in London / ye (...)
down.v.C. howses and ye rofe of Bow church / and did great hurt in
wynthester and in diverse other places. In this time also the welchemen rebellyd
/ but they were subdued and their duke or king called Rise was slain which
was accounted the last king of wales. After that Malcolyn king of Scotts
rebellyd and came into England with his retenewe / whom one Robert earl of
Northu^berlande inconteryd / and there the king Malcolyn was slain / and by
the aid of king wyllyam Edgare his son was made king of Scotland. the king
of Scotts slain
About this time the order of Cysteaux was first brought into England / by one
water Espeke that founded the first Abbey of that religyon at Ryuall. This
king wyllyam was a very covetous man / a proud and a wylfull / and pylled
both^ (...) sperytualte and temperalte / with selling of Bysshoprykes / Abbeys
/ and benefyces / and leuyenge unreasonable taxes and trybutes on the temperalte
/ specially by the only counsel of one Ranulphe his procuratour. which
riches the king did spend upon the Tower of London / and some say upon the
making of westmyster halle: but if ye saying be true of westmyster halle /
it must be some old halle there / and not the new halle that is now. For the
arms that appear in the halle yt now is as well in ye stone work as in the
timber work / be ye arms which king Richard the second gave / which
be.iii. Lions with ye flour delyce quarterly / and the white heart for his
badge. For there was never king of England yt bare the arms of France /
which be the flour delyce / before king Edward the third / for in his time
the arms of France was first joined to ye arms of England. wherefore it
should seem euydently that westmyster halle yt i^ now / was not bylde in the
time of king wyllyam Rufus / except it were only the foundacyon thereof / or
else it was ye halle in westmyster above the steyres / which is now called ye
white halle. By the report of the co^myn people / in this kings time diverse
great wonders were seen / as ye devil apperyng in man's likeness / great
wyndes / tempest / and swellynge and rysynge of waters. And therefore the king
was told by diverse of his famylyers / yt god was not content with his living /
but he was so wylfull and proud of mind / yt he regardyd little their
saying. This king wyllyam as is said and written of him / had great pleasure
in hu^tynge / in so much yt he pulled down and distroyed diverse houses of
religyon to enlarge the new forest of wyndesore for wild dear: but a knight
of his named water Tyrell by ye glaunsyng of his arowe upon a branch when he
shot at an heart in the said forest / smote the king and wounded him to death
whereof shortly he dyed. The first day of August the year of Christ.M.C.
without any issue of his body. And he rayned.xii. year.xi. months and.xii.
days / and is buried at westmyster.

enemies having word of the death of his brother wyllyam Rufus / and that his
brother henry had takyn upon him to be king of England / made preparacyon in

between this Robert and his lords in Normandye that they sent unto king henry

the country. And also by the intyssement of ill tale tellers / a great
varyaunce fell between king henry and his brother Robert / that the king with

after dyed without issue of his body / and was buried at Gloucester. And when

In the.xiii. year of this king / there were seen diverse strange things in

in the west / and a great earth quake at Notyngham during from morn to
evening / and the river of Trent dry in the somer / that men went over a foot

About the.xv. year of this king great war began between Lewys king of
France and king henry / and Lewys with a great host enteryd into Normandy
and wanne many towns and castles / and drove king henry from place to place.
But after that fortune turned ye many noble captains of the French kings
dyed / and some were slain at the seges / and some forsook the French king.
But at the last these.ii. princes met with.ii. great hoostes in a plain

About the.xxi. year there was a great counsel called in London / for ye
correccyon of the vicyous living of priests to be done by the kings

to her father king henry / which caused Dauyd the king of Scotland and the
more part of the lords of England to do oath and fealte to the Empress /
and to keep the land to her if the king dyed without issue male.

Also about the.xxviii. year / one Geffrey Plantagenet earl of Angeo married the
said Maude and after by her had issue Henry / which henry after king Steuyn

About the.vi. year of his raygne / Maude the Empress came into England by
the comfort of the earl of Gloucester / bastard son to king Henry her father

a night when the ground was covered with Snow / she by that means escaped
and fled to walyngforde / and sone after that with a small company departed
into Normandye to her husband Geffrey Plantagenet / but yet after this Robert
earl of Gloucester and the earl of Chester were so strong of people / that the
king was not abyll to venquysshe them / and diverse and many conflyctes was

Also for dyuersacies that the king procured to be made again the lybertes of

There fell a great debate between him and Thomas then Archebysshop of
Caunterbury / that the bishop fled unto Rome. But after when Thomas came
again to Caunterbury.iiii. of ye kings knights because the king being in
Norma^dye / they hard ye king say these words / if he had any men about him /
he had been a venged upon yt traitor long or that time. Therefore these
knights came fro the king being in Normandye / and slew this Thomas in the
cathederall church in Caunterbury at saint Benettes auter: which Thomas is
now by the church canonysed for a holy saint / and diverse miracles auctorysed
by the church that god has showed for him. This king henry let crown henry
his eldyst son king of England / and went him self into Normandye / but
his son henry dyed before his father / and therefore he is not accounted in the
no^bre of kings of England. This Henry his son and his.ii. brethren John^ /
and Richard / made war against their father. Some say the cause of the war
was because the king imprisoned Elynor his wife / which was kept in prison
till the king dyed / and he kept the wenche Rosamonde. Also about the.xi. year
of his reyne / wyllyam the king of Scotts by the assent of all the lords of
Scotla^de did homage to king henry at york / where ye king willyam granted
by his letters patentes / that he and his heirs and successors / for ever
should do homage unto the kings of England.

This king henry in the later end of his days was neclygent to do his duetye
to god and holy church / and also declygent in executynge of his laws / and
was warned often times to amend these things / but he forced no such monicyon
/ nor regarded no counsel. And therefore in his later days all things went
against him. For first about the.xxx. year of his reyne / he sent his son John^
into Irelande / which there did prevail but little. And in the next year
the king went thither him self / but fortune was to him contrary yt he lost
his travail. And about the.xxxii. year of his reyne / he lost Aluerne against
the king of France. And the next year after he lost Butyrecan / and the next
after he lost Cenomenea / Turyne / with many holds to them belonging. And in
the next year after / in the.vi. day of July / the year Christ.M.C.lxxxix. he
dyed and is buried at Founteuerarde.

Upon the which day of his coronacyon because the Jews presumed further than
they ought / the people fell upon them and drove them to their houses / and
robbed and spoiled them without pity / and brent some of their houses / that
the king sent strayte commandment to cesse the riot / but because the nombre
of the trespassours were so many / they escaped unpunished. The jews spoiled.
In the beginning of his reyne / wyllyam king of Scotts came to Caunterbury
/ and did homage to king Richard. This Richard took upon him to war
against Christ's enemies / and made great preparacyon of money and therefore he
gave over Berwyke and Rokysborowe to the king of Scotts for.x.M.li. and sold
to the bishop of Durham his own prouynce / and made many bysshoppes and
rich priests to pay great sommes of money. voyage into the holy land
Also he had license of the pope to dispense with them that had takyn upon them
the cross whereby he raised much money / and than committed the rule of
England to his chauncelour the bishop of Ely / and than went into Normandye
and met with Philyppe king of France at Turon / which had promised the
same voyage. In which metynge they devised assurance for the contynuance of
their journey into ye holy land: that is to say / that king Richard should
pass by the sea / and king Philyppe by the land / and to mete again at
Cycyll / where they met according to their apoyntement / where sone after a
grudge began between the.ii. king for correctyon of their soudyours. wherefore
king Philyppe departed / but king Richard entryd the land of Cypres / and
made so sharp war / that he took the king of Cypres prisoner / and laid
him in bonds of silver / because he had promised he should not be put in
bonds of iron. the king of cypres takyn.
After yt he sailed to Acon or Acres / where king Philyppe with his host lay
and beseged the city which than ioyously received king Richard / which
both princes set upon the city of Acres / and wanne it. The city of Acres
won.
But sone after that / a greater grudge began between those two princes. Some
say the cause thereof was for the partynge of the pryes gotten at the said city
of Acres / and some say it was for that that king Richard denied to king
Philyppe / half that which was gotten at ye city of Cypres / which king
Philyppe claymed by comenant made between them at Turon. varya^ce.
And some say it was because that the earl of Champeyne departed from king
Philyppe and forsook to do him pleasure / which earl king Richard received.
And some say the cause of the varyaunce was for ye that king Richard being
in Cycell / married the sister of the eynge of Nauerne / where he before had
promised to mary the sister of ye said king Philyppe. But what so ever was the
cause of the grudge / truth it is that king Philyppe departed from Acres /
and continued his journey till he came into France. Sone after this it was
showed king Richard / that the town of Iapheth which was than in christen
men's hands / was beseged by one Salandyne / and lykely to be won. wherefore
king Richard sailed thither by water / and a another host of Frenchemen and
other which remained there after the departing of king Philyppe he sent them
to Iaphethe by land / and there by strength rescued the town and wanne diverse
other holds there nyghe /

Flaunders / was next earl of Flaunders

li. which duke of Ostryche was afwarde therefore accursed of the pope for ye
wrong done to king Richard. king richard takyn prisoner.


Also for the payment of this said Ransom / afterward the woll of all the
white monks and chanons in England was sold / and rings / jewels of
prelates and vessels and chalyces of all the churches through the land / and
diverse and many shrynes scraped and spoiled of their gold and silver. Diverse
causes there were as writers reher^e / that the Emperor should owe grudge to
king Richard / one was because king Richard had promised to the Emperor an
aid for the winning of the kingdom of Cicyle / which the Emperor claymed
as his inheritance / which promise king Richard as he said brake. Another
cause was for that ye king Richard took from a knight of the duke of Ostryche
the dukes banner and trod it under his fete in dispyte of the duke and of the
Emperor his lord / and therefore the duke and the Emperor were glad to do
king Richard displeasure.

It is said that a Lion was put to king Richard being in prison to have
devoured him / and when the Lion was gapynge / he put his Arm in his mouth
and pulled the lion by the heart so hard / that he slew the lion. And
therefore some say he is called Richard Cure de lion / but some say he is
called Cure delyon because of his boldness and hardy stomach. Also John^ the
kings brother by excytynge of the French king / herynge that the king his
brother was in prison in Almayne / began to make war within England / and
took diverse castles of the kings / as wyndesore / Notyngham / and diverse
other. And the french king made war in Norma^dye / but the barons of
England resysted so this John^ the kings brother / that he was feign to
deperte to the king of France. After when king Richard came home into
England / he called a parlyment and set the realm in order / and exy^ed all
the Jews out of England / save only a few which remained in Norwyche: but
after that the Jews were suffered to inhabyte again in diverse places in
England. And than after he sailed into Normandye where his brother John^ than
was / and made sharp war against the French king / but after a truce and
peace was taken between them for a certain time. And his brother John^ was
then reconsyled to the king / which both to gyther returned into England.
But after when the day of truce was expyred / king Richard sailed again into
Normandye / and made new war again upon the French king. In the which
war they sped dyuersly / for the French king took diverse of his holds in
Normandye / and king Richard took diverse of his holds in France / and many
great conflyctes was between them. But at the last king Richard went to
besege a castle / called castyll Gayllarde / and as he rode about the castle
to advise it / one marked him with a quarrel / and smote him in the head /
whereof anon after he dyed without issue of his body / the.vi. day of Apryll /

he appeared not nor none for him / king Philyppe enteryd into Normandye / and
took there diverse holds / and gave the countye of Angeo to the foresaid Artur.
And when king John^ hard thereof / he came from England to Normandye and
there made war / and took the said Artur prisoner and diverse other / and
returned shortly into England / but yet he wanne not ye country as it was
said. In the same year following / was great storms of wind / and rain / and
hayle as bygge as hens eggs / and sperytes seen in the air like fowls
berynge fire in their bylles / which set diverse houses a fire. This king John^
than asked an eyde of the clergy of England / for the optaynynge of Normandye
which was lost: which they denied to give. And also the pryour and covent of
Caunterbury / had chosyn one Steuyn Langton bishop / against the kings will /
whom the pope confyrmed / wherefore king Johan was not content / and drove the
pryour and diverse of the covent out of the realm / and commanded that no
letter nor commandment of the pope should be received in England / nor would
not at the popes request receive that bishop so chosyn. Varyance.
wherefore such varyaunce fell between the pope and the king / that the pope
interdyted the land: which stood so interdyted.vii. years / till that king
Johan was reconsyled. england interdyted.
But as it is said / this interdytynge was not so strayte / but that chylderne
were chrystened in every place / and deuyne service said in many houses of
religyon and other places by license purchased than and before / and people
houselyd / and anayled / except such persons as were except by name in the
bull. About this time in Sussex was taken a fysshe like a man: which was kept
a live.vi. months after upon land with raw flesh / but by cause they could
have no speech of it / they cast it into the sea again.

About the.vii. year of king Iohans reyne / the said French king Philyppe
wanne all the hole country of Normandye. Some auctours say that the french
king made all this war against king John^ / by excytynge of the pope for his
contumacye against the church. Norma^dye lost.
About this time the Irysshemen rebellyd / and than king Johan with a pusant
army went into Irelande and shortly subdued them / and set the country in a
rule and there bylde many great towns and castles / and ordained his laws
there to be kept / and returned again into England. Voyage into Irelande.
Sone after this king Johan prepared a great host and sailed into Rochyll /
and when the French king hard thereof / he prepared another strong host /
so that both the hoostes were within little dystannce to have met / but by
mediacyon of fryndes the two kings there took a peace for.ii. years following.
Also about the.x. year of king Iohans reyne / the pope sent.ii. legates /
Pandulfe and Durrant / to king Johan that he should receive Steuyn to his
Archebysshopryke / and sent a new commyssion whereby the curse of interdytynge
(if the king would not agree thereto) was newely denounced.

Also in the.x. year of king John^ / London bridge was begone to be edefyed of
stone / which before was of tymbre / and the monastery of saint Mary oueres
was begone for to be builded. Also about the.xi. year of king Iohans reyne /
the king was in great fear lest he should lose his realm / and to be utterly
undone him self / wherefore in his mind he was sore anoyed / and sent to the
pope and said he would be reconsyled / wherefore the pope sent Pandulfe again
into England with these artycles / that he should receive Steuyn to his
archebysshopryke / and restore to him and to all other / all profytes and
fruits belonging to them that he had wrongfully taken / and that he should
yield unto the popes hands / the title of his crown / and to hold it of the
pope. King John^ reconsyled to ye pope
To the which things the king granted / and resygned his crown to Pandulfe
/ and took it again of him to hold it of the pope / and to pay yearly to the
church of Rome.M. marks of silver: Peter pens.
and after that received Steuyn / and suffered him to enjoy his Archebysshopryke
/ and restored all such profytes as he had from him / and all other wrongfully
taken. Some writers affirm that for this foresaid payment / the Peter pens be
paid at this day.

Also about the.xiiii. year of his reyne / king John^ fell at a great
discencyon with his lords / one cause of that varyance wos for that yt the
king would not hold ye laws of saint Edward / but would hold no law / but
do all thing at his own will / and did disinheryte many men without assent of
his lords / or of any other counsel. And also would have disinheryte the earl
of Chester / because he rebuked him of his wickedness / for that that he hylde
his own brothers wife / and lay by many other great lords dobghters / and
spared no woman that him lyked. wherefore his lords took the city of London
and bylde them there a certain while. But by means of the Archebysshoppe of
Caunterbury and other prelates / the king and his lords met beside Stanys /
at a place called Rumney mede / and there agreement was made / and a charter
made thereupon / called Magna carta / which charter anon after the king
brake / that new varyance began between him and his lords again / yt diverse
of the lords sent unto the king of France / that he should send his son
Lewys hither / and they would render unto him the land / which Lewys thereupon
came into England / and took diverse castles of the kings by force / and after
came to London where the barons received him and yielded to him the Tower of
London. Magna carta first made.

Lewys son to ye French king enteryd i^to England


King John^ being thus over set with this Lewys by the eyde of diverse of his
lords sent unto the pope / showing their rebellynge. which sent unto him a
Legate called Swallo / which in the popes name commanded Lewys to return
into France and labored to have a peace between them / but his labor was in
vain. wherefore the king forfere fled toward Lyncolne: but sone after at
Neuwarke he dyed of the flyx / the.xix. day of October / the year of
Christ.M.CC.xvi. But some say that a monk poisoned him at Swynestede / and he
is buried at worcester.

And the earl of Chester and diverse other lords of the kings part went to

forced this Lewys to take a peace / which peace was thus concluded yt Lewys
should go again into France / and to have a.M. marks for his travail /
which he had and so deperted. Also in the third year of this king / began ye

And this king also granted many lybertes to the city of London. Sone after
this king Henry with a great host sailed into Normandye / by the excytynge of
a French man named the earl of March: where between the French king Lewys
and him was fought a great battle / but in the end the Frenchemen had the
victory / and took.xxii. knights and noble men prisoners / and.v.C. mean
people / yt king Henry for fear fled and turned back to Burdeux / but after
a peace was made / and king henry returned into England. About this time was
a great yerthe quake in England / and also in the.xxxi. year of this king /
the king seasyd the franches of London into his hands for a judgment given by
one Piers Alyn the Mayre and Aldermen / against a wedowe called Margarete Vyell
/ which judgment as it was said was after found good / wherefore the Citezyns
inioyed again their lybertes. The Emperor deposed.
About the.xxxv. year of this king / the order of the freres Augustynes began
in England in a place in wales called wodhouse. And about this time the king
married Margarete his daughter / to Alexander the king of Scotts / which
Alexander did homage to ye king at york. This king Henry often times for
diverse co^playntes made against ye Mayres officers of London / seasyd the
lybertes of the city into his own hands / and set other officers to rule the
city / but ever they were restored again. Libertes of london seasyd.
Also about this time Richard the kings brother earl of Cornwall was elect
king of Almayne and king of Romans / which took shyppynge and went thither /
and there was crowned in ye city of Aquisgranu^. About the.xli. year of king
Henryes rain / a grievous byll of complaynt of the co^mynalte of London was put
against the Mayre and Aldermen and governors of the city / for wrongs and
extorcyons done by them to the co^mynalte / by setting of taxes / and
altering of tolles and customs to their own singular ^ucr^ / which byll was
cast in the kings wardrobe / which after came to the kings hands / that the
king sent down his Justice and other of his counsel / which discharged the
Mayre / Sheryffes / and Chamberlayne / and made inquisicyon of the truth / but
the offenders by their learned counsel long time defended them self / and
delayde the trial. And yet diverse places of sitting were appointed / as well
in the Guylhalle and at the Folkemo^e at Poules cross / and in the Escheker ye
kings grace there being present / where in the end the Mayre and Aldermen
were arrested and compelled to put in great suertyes / and at the last they put
them in the kings mercy / and made their end / and lastly restored again to
their roumes / but not without great fynes payenge. Also about this time there
was a great derth / that whete was worth.xxiiii. s. a quarter.

The barons rose against the king
Then the barons came forward with banners displayde and much people resorted
to them / and they put in prison and punysshed all them that took the contrary
part / and at the last came into London / for the city took ye barons part.
But sone after agreement was made between the king and his lords / which
continued not long / for ye hyng caused sir Edward his eldyst son to take the
castle of wyndesore by a train / and the king secretly departed from
westmyster / and rode into the said castle / and many of the lords that took
his part came to him. And the barons and the other that took their part drew
to London / but yet by some well disposed persons a concord was taking thus /
that both parts should abide the judgment of Lewys the French king /
concerning the keeping of the said ordynances. wherefore the king and sir
Edward his eldyst son went over to the said Lewys / and for the barons part
there went sir Peter de Mountforde and other / before which king Lewys the
matter was argued / but in conclusion king Lewys gave sentence that the said
statutes and ordynances should be clearly void and the king set at lyberte.
After which sentence given / ye king and all the other returned into Lpndon /
but the barons not content with this sentence (reputing parcialyte in king
Lewys) departed and went into the Marches of wales and gathered a great nombre
of people and came into London / and than because some varyaunce was between
some of the rulers of the city and the commons. The commons made them two
captains / calling them Constables of the city / at whose commandment all
the co^myns by tollynge of the great bell of Polles / should be ready in harnes
to wait upon them. which Constables with the commons (by the exortynge of
Hughe Spencer Constable of ye Tower) went to Thystelworth beyond westmyster /
and there spoiled the manner of the king of Romans / which deed was the great
cause of the war / for the king took it grievously and gathered great power /
and at the last came to the town of Lewys in Sussex / but the wardens of the
five parts kept the sea with ships / ye no strangers should enter to aid
the king. And than the barons with a great multitude of ye city of London /
and with a great host of other people came against the king / between whom
the.xxiii. day of May was fought a marvelous cruel battle at Lewys / and the
Lo^doners that gave the first assent / by reason of the sharp shot of Arowes
and strokes given by them of the kings parts began to draw back. The batell

But the barons incurraged their men in such wise yt they not only set upon
them with fresshe cheu^en / but incurraged so them that gave back / yt they
turned again and fought so fersly that the kings perte gave back / and the
king lost the fylde. where the king him self and the king of Romans and
Edward the kings son were takyn prisoners and many other mo / and.xx.M. men
slain for this battle co^tynued ye more part of the day. After which battle

But king Edward than herynge of their pride and scornful ryme / was moved
greatly and so incurraged his men / that first they wanne the dyches / and
after the Bulwarks / and in the end wanne the town by force / and slew of
the Scotts to the nombre of.xxv.M. and after sent a part of his host to lay
sege at Dunbarre / to whom a great host of Scotts came to remove the sege /
and fought with the Englysshemen a fyers battle / but the Englysshemen had the
victory / and slew of the Scotts.xx:M. and the englysshemen in reproach of
the Scotts made this ryme. battle in scotla^de.
The skaterande Scotts hold we for sottes of wrenches unware
Erly in a morning in a evil tymynge came they to Dumbare
and than Baylolle king of Scotts and many other lords did put them in the
kings grace / which than brought them to London / and yet after that
delivered them again taking their oaths* upon the sacrament / never to bear
arms against king Edward / and than they were delivered / and so after that
Baylolle went over into France and never came again / while ye king was thus
occupied in Scotland / the englysshemen sustained many hurtes in Gascoyn and
Guyan for the earl of Artoys skyrmysshed often times with the englysshemen / and
at the last took sir John^ / saint John^ / sir willyam Mortymer / and diverse
other prisoners which were conveyed to France to diverse prisons.

Also about this time the cy^ezens of London were restored to their lybertes /
which in some part had been kept from them by the space of.xii. years / so
that instead of Mayres there were custodyes or gardayns / which was because
they mysordered the Justice of the city. But for this restorynge / they
paid.iii.M. marks.

In the.xxvi. year king Edward went over into Flaunders to aid Guy earl of
Flaunders against the French king / and the french king drew toward the
king / but by mediacyon of fryndes at ye last a peace was made between them
all. But in this while the Scotts herynge of the war in Flaunders / because
their king was fled into France made them a new king called walys / and
rose again and entered into Northumberla^de / but the king sent his letters to
the lords of England / which by his commandment gathered a great power and
went into Scotland / where between them was skyrmysshes and many englysshemen
slain / for the Scotts kept their holds and would not come to no plain
fylde. walys of scotla^de.
But the next year after king Edward gathered a great power and went him
self into Scotla^de / where the Scotts with a great host met him at a place
called Fankyrke / where between them was fought a cruel battle / but in the
end the Englysshemen had the victory / and slew of the Scotts to ye nombre
of.xxxii.M. and but few of the Englysshemen. battle at Fa^kyrke
But yet the next year after the king laid sege to the castle of Estreuelyn
/ where at the last the Scotts that were therein yielded the castle and swear
them selfs to the kings ^legeaunce / and walys herynge thereof fled into the
mareyses for his suerte / for fear of the kings host / and kept him so long
time / that all the commons of Scotland presented them self to the king by
great companyes / and put them into the kings grace / and the rulers and
officers of cities / towns / boroughes / were sworn to king Edward.

king recovered innumerable treasour against such offenders and filled his

England / for those offenders were well chastyced and were much more meker
and better / and the pore commons lived in much more rest and peace. the king
imprisoned Edward his eldist son.


Also about this time sir Edward the kings eldest son / by the wanton
counsel of Piers Ganeston brake the bishop of Chesters park / and
ryottuously distroyed his game / wherefore the king imprisoned his son and
other that were with him / and after banysshed the said Piers out of England.

Also about the.xxxiii. year of king Edward / walys the Scotte was taken and
brought to London / and drawn / hanged / and quartred / and anon after that
the bishop of saint Andrews / Robert le Bruise / sir Simon Frysell earl of
Dumber / / sir John^ Cambres earl of Atlas / and sir John^ Common / with many
other came to westmyster by their voluntarye wylles / and were sworn to be
true to king Edward / and to keep Scotland to his use. But sone after that
/ Robert le Bruise contrary to his oath / gate a dispensacyon for his oath of
pope Clement the.v. and took upon him to be king of Scotland / and slew sir
John^ Common / and his brother that counseled him to the contrary. And sone
after king Edward came into Scotland again with a strong power / and
Robert le Bruise met him with a great nombre / at a plain nyghe saint Iohans
town / where there was fought a cruel battle / but the Scotts were
discomfyt / and.vii. thousand Scotts there slain / and there were diverse
bysshoppes and abbottes taken / and diverse other temporal lords. batell in

And Robert le Bruise fled unto the king of Norwey / and king Edward sent the
bysshoppes and Abbottes that were taken in the fylde to the pope / and sent the
temperall lords and other of the Scotts that were takyn unto London / where
they were put to death.

Also in the.xxxv. year of king Edward as he returned toward England / he
fell sick / wherefore he swear his lords to be true to Edward his eldyst
son. And also charded his said son upon his blessing / that he should never

that contrary to the kings mind / this Piers was banysshed into Irelande /
but the king secretly comforted him with great gifts / and made him chief
ruler of the country / but after that for the avoiding of grudge between ye
king and the lords / the said Piers was suffered to come into England again
and had the rule of all the kings jewels / and spend and wasted much of the
kings treasure / that shortly after by ye labor of the lords / he was
exyled again into Flaunders to the kings displeasure. The rodes won from the
Turks.


About this time the knights of saint Iohans wanne the city of the Rodes from
ye Turks. Also the Templers lands for that they used things contrary to the
faith of Christ / were given to them of saint Iohans / and the Templers were
distroyed through out all Chrystendome / and about this time the order of the
Crossyd freres came first into England. The temples dysstroyed.
This Piers of Ganeston was suffered to come again into England / which than
demeaned him self much wors than ever he did before / and waxed proud / and
reuyled so the iordes that they were sore moved against him / that suddenly
they rose and beseged him in the Castle of Scarbrugh / and at the last wanne
it and took it and brought him to a place beside warwyke / and there stroke of
his head / wherewith the king was greatly displeased. Piers of Ganasto^ beheded.


About the.vi. year of this king / Robert le Bruise herynge of the dyuisyon
between the king and his lords / came again into Scotland / and there was
admytted as king: wherefore king Edward prepared a great army and went into
Scotla^de / against whom came Robert le Bruise with a great power of Scotts /
and they met at a place nyghe a river called Bannokisborne / where was fought a
great batell / but the Englysshemen lost the fylde / and many of the lords and
great men of England were slain and taken / and the king with a few of his
host fled and escaped with great danger into Berwyke / wherefore the Scotts
were so inflamed with such pride / that they made this eyme. batell at

the people were feign

Also about the.xi. year of his reyne / he assembled a great host of the
Southe and Eest parts of England / and came and beseged Berwyke: wherefore the
Scotts gathered a great company and came into England another way / into the
marches of york shyre / and there slew much people. wherefore the
Archebysshop of york and other Abbottes / pryours / clerks / with
husbandemen / assembled a great company / and gave them battle at a place
called Mytton / where the Englysshemen were discomfyte / and many of them
slain / but the Archebysshop and the Abbot of Selby / and diverse other there
escaped. battle of Mytton
But because there were so many spiritual men there slain / it was called
therefore the white battle. And when king Edward hard thereof because it was
nyghe winter / he brake up his sege and returned into york. Also about this
time there was nothing done but by the advise of Hughe Spencer the father /
and Hughe Spencer the son / and the commons had them in as great hateryd / as
they had Piers of Ganeston before.

Also in the.xii. year of this king / two Legates which came from Rome / made
great labor to conclude a peace between the king of England and the Scotts
/ but that auayled not: wherefore king Edward gatte a curse of pope John^ / to
accurse Robert le Bruise / and all other that took his part that had hurt the
reame of England / and that to stand in strength till they had reco^pensed
for all harms done to England / but it auayled nothing / but put England to
great cost for the optaynynge thereof. Also when the barons of England saw
this mysterye / that ye Spencers mysgouerned all the realm / they assembled
them to gether / and made a re^uest to the king / that he should remove the
Spencers from his person. wherefore there was a parlyment called at London / and
the barons came thither with a great company in iakettes of yelowe and grene /
and a band of white cast ouerthwarte / and therefore it was called the
parlyment of white bands. spence^^ banysshed.
At which parlyment both the Spencers were banysshed the land for term of
their lives / and they took shyppynge at Dover and ^o voyded the land. But it
was not long after / but the king contrary to that ordynance made in the
parlyment / sent for these Spencers again / and set them in high auctorite /
and ruled all thing after their sensual appetytes / nothing regarding
Justice nor the common welthe: wherefore the barons intendyng again to reform
these myschefe assembled their powers / but the king made so hasty speed and
gathered his people so sone and was stronger than they / and pursued them so in
diverse places / that the barons ever fled / that in the end Thomas earl of
La^caster was taken by one Andrewe of Harkeley (whom the king sent with a great
power) at ye battle of Borough brygge / where many other of the barons were
s^ayne and taken. battle at borough bryg.
And after that the said earl of Lancaster and diverse other of the barons and
knights were put to death / and after that the kings power and the Spencers
powers greatly increasyd / and the barons powers decade by the space of.v.
year contenuynge. In which time one Robert Baldocke / which was a man of
evil fame / was Chaunceler of England / by whose means the king gathered
many forfettes and fynes of his people / contrary to good order of Justice.

In the.xv. year of this king / one Edward le Bruise brother to the king of
Scotts / with a great power entered into Irelande / intending to have won
that land / but the people of Irelande quytte them so well / that they
venquysshed the Scotts and slew Edward le Bruise / and many of the nobles of
Scotland and many other / and drove the resydewe out of the country. battle

Also the.xvi. year / the king prepared a meruaylous great army as some
writers report / to the nombre of.C.M. and invaded Scotland. But the Scotts
for fere of the great multitude drew them to mountains and other places / yt
the English host prevailed little against them / wherefore the king
returned again into England / because many of his people there perysshed for

And because king Edward had denied to do homage to the king of France for
the Duchye of Guyan / the said king Philyppe there made Edward the king of
England his eldyst son duke of Guyan / wherewith king Edward was not content
/ and did exyle both the queen and his said son out of England / by the
counsel of the Spencers / and of sir Robert Baldocke his Chau^cellour:
wherefore the king made opyn Proclamacyons / that if the Queen and her son came
not into England by a certain day / that they should be take as enemies to
the king / before the which day they came not / wherefore the king seized all
the queen's lands / and his sons lands / and took the hole profit thereof. And
after the king sent such word and thretenynges to the king of France /
that he was compelled to avoid the queen out of France: wherefore she and her
son went to the earl of Heynaude / where Edward her son was shortly after
contracte to Philyppe ye said earls daughter. And when this was known / diverse
men of name of England came over to the queen / and sone after the earl of

And than the queen sent a letter to the Mayre and co^mynalte of London /

set up in diverse other places. wherefore this bishop of Excester sent to the
Mayre to have the keys of the city / and spoke to him so sharp words / that
they fell at such a varyance / that the commons of the city in a rage took
the said bishop and brought him to the standarde in Chepe / and smote of his
head / and two of his servants hedes / and a cyteners head called Marshall /
that was sir Hughe Spencers spy. Than the king went to Brystowe / and

Edward the third
Peace with the scotts.
And the old queen and he took upon them the rule of the hole realm / whereby
many things grew out of order.

About the third year of this king / the earl of Kent the old kings brother
/ supposing his brother had been a live / devised certain letters secretly to
be sent to his brother for his delyuerance / wherefore he was accused and by
auctoryte of parlyament condemned / and therefore was beheded. This Roger
Mortymer was so cruel / covetous / and so proud / that the lords and the
people disdayned him / and by secret means brought him out of the kings
favor / whereupon by the kings mind / this sir Roger Mortymer was by a train
taken in the castle of Notyngham / where the king / the queen / and the old
queen that time lay. Sir roger mortymer taken.
And yet sir Roger kept the keys him self / and after at a parlyament at
London / he was condemned as a traitor / and after drawn and hanged for
diverse artycles that were laid unto him / one was that by his means and
treason / the Scotts escaped at Stanhope. And another was that he caused the
forsayde indenture of Ragman / to be delivered to the Scotts / whereby they
were relessed of their homage / and caused Dauyd king of Scotts son to Robert
le Bruise / to mary Ione sister to king Edward. Another was that he had gotten
the kings treasure in his own hands and wasted it. Another was that he had
broken the ordynance made at the coronacyon / that.xii. lords should have had
the rule of the king / and that without them there should no thing be done /
and that not withstanding he with the old queen ruled all him self / to the
great hurt of the realm. Another that he had caused Edward the kings father
/ to be conveyed from Kyllyngworth to the castle of Barkeley / and after by a
letter devised by him self in the kings name and sent to the keeper / caused
him to be murdered. As touching the death of this Edward of Carnaruan late
before king / it is said yt after that sir Roger Mortymer had sent the said
letter to the kepers / they caused a great table to be laid upon his bellye
being a sleep in his bed / and pressed it down with great weyghtes. the
death of king edward the.ii.
And afterward they took an horn and put it into his foundament / and took a
spytte hot brennynge and put it through the horn into his body / and so
cruelly murdered him.

About the.iiii. year / one Edward Baylolle son to sir Johan Baylolle /
sometime king of Scotts / with the eyde of.ii.M. englysshemen by king
Edwardes consent / entered into Scotland and claymed the crown / against whom
a great host of Scotts came and gave him a fyers battle / but Edward

to Edward Baylolle king of Scotts. Than Dauyd son of Robert le Bruise /
being before king of Scotts / fled with his wife into France to Philyppe de
Valoys there being king / which received them.

About the.vii. year of king Edward / Philyppe king of France sent a crewe
of Frenchemen to aid the kings enemies in Scotland / but king Edward of
England went thither and subdued them.

About the.xii. year of king Edward / because he intended to make title to
the crown of France by the title of Isabell his mother / he went into
Flaunders and into Almayne / and there joined him self in Amyte with diverse of
the lords / and with many other towns in Flaunders wherefore Philyppe the
king of France / supposing that king Edward would have invaded France /
that year gathered a great strength of people and lay at Amyas / but king
Edward entered not that year. This Philyppe also the same time had a great
Nauey upon the sea / and xiii. sail of them met with.v. english ships /
between whom there was a great fight / but the Frenchemen had the victory /
and took two great ships of England with great riches / and carried them with
them into the French stremys / and cast the men over the board. battle in the sea.
In the.xiiii. year of king Edward he returned into england and called his
parlyament at westmyster / and there by the advise of the hole realm / took
upon him the title to be king of France / and joined the arms of england to
the arms of France and bare them quarterly / and asked an aid toward his
charge / that is to say the.v. part of every man's goods / and the custom
of wolles for.ii. year to be paid before hand / the.ix. shefe of every man's
corn / which things were there granted: but or it was gathered the people
grudged sore / and therefore the king borrowed before hand of diverse rich men
great sommes of money / to be repayde of the money of the forsayde grant /
whereof the city of London paid.xx.M. marks. In the.xv. year of his reyne /
as the king sailed toward Flaunders with a Nauey of.CCC. sail. battle in the sea at Sluse.
The French kings Nauey met them in the sea / nyghe a place called Sleuse
with.iiii.C. sail / between which there was a cruel fight / that the like
was never seen upon the sea. But in the end king Edward had the victory /
and in that fight there were slain as writers testefye. xxx.M. frenchemen /
but the french cronycle says there were.xxx.M. slain upon both pertes. Sone
after this king Edward sent an army / which entered into the borders of
France / and laid sege to the town of Torney / and lay him self with a
another great host nygh to the same. And Philyppe the king of France came
with a another great host and lodged him self within iii. miles of king
Edward / but sone after by the treatise of the Countes of Henaude / mother to
the queen of england / and sister to the French king / a mean was made

About the.xix. year of this king / he made a solemn feast at wyndesore /
and a great Iustes and turnament where he devised and perfyted substancyally
the order of the knights of the garter / how be it some afferme that this
order began first by king Richard Cure de lion / at the sege of ye city of
Acres / wherein his great necessyte there were / but.xxvi. knights that fyrmely
and surely abode by the king / wherefore he caused all them to were thonges of
blewe leyther about their legs. And afterward they were called knights of
the blewe thonge. In the.xxi. year king Edward with.xi.C. sails great and
smal^e / sailed into Normandye / and there wanne diverse towns and holds / and
costed toward Roan. But Philyppe king of France had entered into Roan before
and brake up the brydges / so that king Edward was feign to leave that way
and costed toward Paris / till he came to a place of the French kings called
sayn Germayns / and the French king came as fast on the other side toward
Paris / but ever the water of Seyne was between them / and so nygh they were
often times / that the one host might see the other. But because the French
king had broken up the brydges / the hoostes could never mete / wherefore the
englysshemen said that the French king brake up the brydges because he durst
not fight with the english host. And the Frenchemen said that he brake up
the brydges to the intent that the englysshemen should not escape his danger /
and when king Edward saw that he might not well come to Paris for brekynge
of the brydges / he returned again to a town called Poysy / which town
before he had brent / and there than repaired the bridge that king Philyppe
had broken / but in the repayrynge thereof / there came.ii.M. Frenchemen to let
the said work / but the Archers kept them so of / that many of them were
slain / and ye work was fynysshed. Than king Edward entered the country of
Pychardy / and at the last came to the water of So^me and passed the water /
and came to a forest called Cressye / wherefore king Philyppe with a great
host came thither / and there fought with king Edward a great sharp and a
mortal battle / where king Edward had the victory / and king Philyppe
sore hurt fled and escaped with great danger / and many of the lords of the
french part were slain That is to say the king of Beam son to Henry the
Emperor / the duke of Loreyn / the earl of Alau^son / the earl of Bloys / the
earls of Flaunders Saucer and Harcourt and of Fyennys / and viii. bysshappes /
and.xvii. other lords of name / and of banerettes / knights / and
squyers.xvi.C. that in that battle was slain the flower of all France / and
of commons.viii.M. and above. This battle was upon the saturday / and on the
monday next there appeared to them a new host of Frenchemen / and gave them
battle / in which battle also king Edward had the victory and slew moo
of the Frenchemen that day / than was slain ye saturday before. After this
victory king Edward gave thanks to god / and within.iiii. days after went
to Caleys / and laid sege to that town / which continued from the first day
of Septembre / to the.iii. day of August than next following / and kept the sea so surely that no vytell could come unto them. Caleys won.
Than in the later end of July / king Philyppe came toward Caleys with a
strong power / to remove the sege. And some writers say that he came to late /
for the town was yelden before he came. And some say yt when king Edward
prepared to give him battle and a day appointed between them to fight / yt
king Philyppe cowardely in ye night before deperted and returned again into
France / and than they of Caleys perceuynge that / yielded up the town to
king Edward.

And in the same season the duke of Normandye king Iohn^s son / which was
leder of a another host / assailed them upon a another part / but these.iii.
battles did little hurt to the Englysshemen / for they slew so many by shot
of Arowes / that these.iii. hoostes were discomfyt. Than king John^ seeing
this / comforted his people / and he him self with a fresshe company set upon

Also in the.xxxiiii. year / king Edward with the prince his son / and the
duke of Lancaster sailed over unto Caleys / and so went to the country of
Champayne / to whom diverse lords of the duchye of Burgoyne came and gave the
king.xxx.M.^i. that he should do no hurt in that country. wherefore he departed
thens and went toward Paris / the king of france raunsomed.
and his host lodged nyghe to Paris / ready to give battle / but ye bishop
of Beaux chancellor of Norma^dye with other / took a day of truse to conclude
a peace / at which day at a place within a mile of Charters / the duke of
Lan^aster / the earl of warwyke and Northampton appeared for king Edward / and
for Charles than eldyst son to king John^ / which before was made Regent of
France / there appeared the said bishop of Beaux / and diverse other lords /

whom the French king sent.iii. earls to subdewe them with a great power with
them / but the Frenchemen were discomfyt / and one of the earls was slain /
and.ii. of them taken prisoners / and these company co^tynued.iiii. years / to

rebelled against prince Edward. wherefore prince Edward perceiving all this /

Also in the.xix. year / this king Richard married Isabell daughter to the
French king at Caleys / and after brought her into London with a great
tryumphe. And also in the same year the town of Breast was delivered unto the

/ that it had been more honor to the king to put his body to pain to win a
strong town and hold / than to give up yt which was gotten by his
progenytours by great diffyculte / whereupon discencyon fell between the king
and him. And after that the duke perceiving how the king was myslad by

at which assemble there met the said duke the earl of Arondell / the earl of

And also for because that the duke of Gloucester was secretly murdered without
process of the law. And also for that he would chose Sheryffes and other
officers at his own will and pleasure / without advise of any discrete
counsel. Also another cause was that he would rebuke the Judges if they gave
any judgment contra^ye to his mind / wherefore they gave many iugementes
contrary to the order of the law. And also that before his parlyament he would
send his letters to Sheryffes / cities / and borowes / commaundynge them to
chose such knights of the shyre and such citezyns and burgeses / as he him
self would apoynt and name. And also for that he commanded the Sheriffs of
his shyres and other officers / to cause the people to make certain general
oaths / and to write and to seal certain bonds and wrytynges for the
performance of the same oaths. And also for yt he caused and compelled many men
of great substance to seal certain blanke charters / and after put i^ the
so^mes / and wrote in them certain clauses to the utter undoing of them that
sealed them. And also an other rumor ran upon the king / yt he had set
England to ferme to.iii. persons / that was sir John^ Busshe / sir John^ Bagot
/ and sir Henry Grene.

Also sone after the foresaid parlyament / a great discord fell between the
duke of Northfolke which before was earl of Notyngham / and Henry Bolingbrake

Also in the.xxii. year of this king / the king with a great army sailed
into Irelande / and there conquered the land and prospered marvelously / and
set the country in good order. the king sailed in to Irela^de.
But than anon tythynges there came to the king / that Henry Bolyngbroke duke
of Herforde was landed in England / at a place called Rauyns Sporre in the
North country / and proclaimed him self duke of Lancaster / and with that
much people resorted unto him / wherefore the king in all have came over into
England with a small company / and l^fte much of his ordynance behind him
and came to the castle of Flynt / and there rested him to the intent to gather
more strength. henry boli^gbroke landed.
But in the mean while the duke was co^myn unto Brystowe with a great company
and there took sir willyam Scrope earl of wylshyre / sir Johan Busshy / and sir
John^ Grene / which.iii. anon had their hedes smytten of / and sir John^
Bagot was taken there the same time / but he escaped again and ^led into
Irelande / but after that he was taken again and brought unto London and put
into Newgate. the king came again in to England.
when the king hard of the strength of the duke / the king and all that ever
were about him feared sore / wherefore one Thomas Percye earl of worcester
steward of the kings house contrary to his alegeaunce / brake his white rod
openly in the kings hall / and bad every man shyfte for himself / whereby the
kings servants went away and there the king was lafte comfortles. So that he
was shortly after taken and brought to ye duke / which in contynently brought
him to London / and when he was nyghe the city he sent king Richard
secretly to the Tower. And diverse wild persons of the city herynge thereof /
assembled a great nombre / to the intent to have taken king Richard / and to
have slain him or that he had co^myn to the Tower / for ye great cruelte that
he before time had used to the city / But the Mayre and other discrete
co^myners herynge of their purpose / gathered another company and by good
polecye / but not without great difficulte / put those wild fellows from their
purpose. the king taken prisoner.
Than anon after there was a parlyament called at westmyster / where many of
the artycles before rehearsed were laid to the kings charge / that he had
mysgouerned the realm / and that he was not worthy therefore to be the prince
or governor of a realm / which things he confessed him self by his mouth
/ and renounced and resygned up all his kyngly majesty / and all the title and
right that he had to the crown / and further released to all lords spiritual
and temporal / and to all other of every degree / all homage and fealte that
ever they made or auowed to him. And than the king by the hole consent of all
the lords and the commons in the said parlyament was deposed of his kyngly
dignyte / and all they by one assent / chase the said Henry duke of Harforde
for the great manhood and wisdom that they saw in him above all other to be
king of England. And thus this king Richard was deposed / the year of
Christ.M.CCC.xCix. the last day of Septe^bre. And he was first buried at
Langley / but he lies now at westmyster.

whereupon many came thither / and so the town was stuffed with englysshemen.
Than the Dolphyn and other lords that had the governance of France because
the french king was ye time sick and dyseased. And as some writers affirm
of a Frensye / brake up all the brydges that the king could not pass over the

great multitude / he comforted his people which were not of good fyghtyngmen
passing the nombre of.vii.M. but the french chronicles seythe there were

retrete back in the beginning when the frenchemen should with their speres
run upon them / and according as they were commanded they did. And in the
