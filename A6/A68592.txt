A brief Declaration of the Table of Predestination.
CHAP. I.
The question of Gods eternal Predestination is not curious, or unprofitable,
but of great importance, and very necessary in the Church of God.

SAint Augustine in his book of The profit of De bono perseuerantiae.
Perseverance, chap. 14. says, that they which were against him as Adversaries
in this question, did allege that Object.
this doctrine of Predestinaon, did hinder the preaching of Gods word, and
coused that it could not profit. As if Answer.
(says he) this doctrine had hindered the Apostle Saint Paul to do his duty:
who so oftentimes does commend unto us and teach Predestination, and yet
never cease to preach the word of God.

Also says moreover. As he that has received the gift, can better exhort and
preach: so he that has received this gift, does hear the Preacher more
obediently, and with greater reverence etc. We do therefore exhort and
preach; but they only which have ears to hear, do hear us quietly, and to
their comfort: and in those that have them not, this sentence is fulfilled,
that hearing with their ears, they do not hear, for they hear with the
outward sense, but not with the inward consent. Now, why some men have these
ears, and others not, it is, because it is given to some to come, and to
others not. Who knew Gods counsel? must that be denied which is plain and
evident, because that cannot be known which is hid and secret? Again in the
15. chap. I pray you (says he) if some under the shadow of Predestination
give themselves to slothful negligence, and as they are bent to flatter their
flesh, so follow their own lusts, must wether foreiudge, that this which is
written of the foreknowledge of God is false? Now surely this is very
handsome, and to the purpose, that we shall not speak that which by the
Scripture is lawful to speak. Oh we (...) (say you) least he should be
offended, which is not able to understand and take it. And shall we not fear
(say I) lest whiles we hold our tongue, he that is able to take the truth, be
taken and snared with falsehood and error? Also in the 20 chapter of the same
book, he writes in this sort. If the Apostles, and Doctors of the Church
which came after them, did the one and the other, both teaching the eternal
election of God purely and truly, and also retaining the faithful in godly
life and manners: what moves these our Adversaries (seeing they are overcome
with the manifest and invincible truth) to think they speak well, saying,
Although this doctrine of Predestination be true: yet it ought not to be
preached to the people. Nay, so much the rather it is good to be thoroughly
preached, that he that has ears to hear, may hear. And who has them, but
he that has received them of God, who promises to give them?

And as for him that does not receive it, let him refuse it if he will; so that
he that does receive it, may take it, drink it, be suffised, and have life.
For as we must preach the fear of God, to the end that God may be truly
served: so must we preach predestination, that he which has ears to hear may
hear, and rejoice in God, not in him self, for the grace of GOD toward him.

This is the mind of that excellent Doctor, as touching this point. Which
notwithstanding binds us to two conditions: the one is, that we speak no
further herein, then Gods word does limit us: the other, that we set forth the
same thing which the Scripture teaches, accordingly, and to edification.
Wherefore we will briefly speak of both these parts: first of the doctrine
it self, and next of the use and applying of the same.

CHAP. II.
Of the eternal counsel of God hid in himself, the which afterward, is
known by the effects thereof.

GOd, whose judgments no man can comprehend, The counsel, purpose and will of
God, is the fountain and original of all causes.
whose ways cannot be found out, and whose will I ought to stop all men's
mouths 2, according to the determinate and unchangeable purpose of his will, by
the virtue whereof all things are made 3, yea eue^ those things which are
evil and execrable (not in that they be wrought by his divine counsel, but
forasmuch as they proceed of the Prince of the a^re, and that spirit, which
works in the children 4 of disobedience) has determined 5 from before all
beginning with himself, to create all things, in their time, for his glory,
and 6 namely men: who^ he has made after two sorts, clean contrary one to the
other. Whereof he makes the one sort (which it pleased him to choose by his
secret will and purpose) partakers of his glory through his mercy 7, and these
we call according to the word of God, the vessels of honor, Vessels of
honor.
the elect, the children of promise, and predestinat to salvation 8: and the
others, whom likewise it pleased him to ordain to damnation (that he might
show forth his wrath and power, to be glorified also in them) we do call the
vessels of dishonor Vessels of dishonor.
and wrath, the reprobat, and cast off from all good works 9.

This election or predestination Our election is hid in the secret purpose of
God.
to everlasting life, being considered in the will of God (that is to say, this
self same determination, or purpose to elect) is the first fountain and
chief original of the salvation of Gods children: neither is it thereon
grounded, as some say, because God did foresee their faith, or good works: but
only of his own good will 10, from whence afterward the election the faith
and the good works spring forth. Therefore when the Scripture will confirm
the children of God in fu^l and perfect hope it does not stay in alleging the
testimones of the second causes, that is to say, in the fruits of faith, nor
in the second causes themselves, as faith, and calling by the Gospel, neither
yet sometimes in Christ himself, in whom notwithstanding we are, as in our
head, elected and adopted, but ascends higher, even unto Reprobation is hid
in the secret purpose of God.
that eternal purpose which GOD has determined only in himself. 11.

Likewise when mention is made of the damnation of the reprobate, although the
whole fault thereof be in themselves yet notwithstanding, sometimes when need
requires, the scripture to make more manifest by this comparison the great
power of God, his patience, and the riches of his glory toward the vessels of
mercy 13, leads us unto this high secret, which by order is the first cause
of their damnation: of the which secret, no other cause is known to me^, The
secret purpose to elect or reprove, only appertains to God, but the causes
of election and reprobation are manifest in the Scriptures.
but only his just will, which we must with all reverence obey, as coming
from him who is only just, and cannot by any means, nor of any man, in any
sort be comprehended 14. For we must put difference betwixt the purpose or
ordinance of reprobation, and reprobation it self. Because God would that the
secret of this his purpose, should be kept close from us: and again we have the
causes of reprobation, and damnation which depends thereof, expressed in Gods
word, that is to say, corruption, lack of faith, and iniquity, which as they
be necessary, so are they also voluntary in the vessels made to dishonor 15:
like as on the other part, when we describe orderly the causes of the
salvation of the elect, we put difference betwixt the purpose of electing,
which God has determined in himself, and the election which is appointed in
Christ, in such sort, that this his purpose or ordinance, does not only go
before election in the degree of causes, but also before all other things that
follow the same 16.

CHAP. III.
How God puts in execution his eternal counsel, as well toward the elect,
as the reprobate.

THe Lord God, that he might put in execution Why man was created good, but
yet so, that he might willingly become evil.
this eternal counsel to his glory, prepared away according to his infinite
wisdom, indifferent both to those that he would choose, and those also which
he would refuse. For when he determined to show his infinite mercy in the
salvation of the elect, and also his just judgment in the condemnation of the
reprobate; it was necessary that he should shut up both under disobedience and
sin, to show his mercy to all 1 those that believe 2. that is to say, to the
elect: because faith is a gift of god which properly belongs unto the^ 3: and
contrariwise to have just cause to condemn them, to whom it is not given to
believe 4. nor to know Gods mysteries 5. Therefore GOD did this in such sort,
and with such wisdom, that the whole fault of the reprobates damnation lies
in themselves: and on the other side, all the glory and praise of the elects
salvation belongs wholly to his only mercy.

For he did not create man a sinner (for then he should The creation of man.
have been, with reverent fear be it spoken, the author of sin, which
afterward he could not justly have punished) but rather he made him after
his own image 6: to wit, in innoce^cie, purity, and holiness: who
notwithstanding without constraint of any, neither yet forced by any necessity
of concupiscence as touching his will (which as yet was not made servant unto
sin 8) Corruption.
willingly, and of his own accord rebelled against God: binding (by this
means) the whole nature of man to sin, and so consequently to the death of
body and soul 9.

Yet we must confess that this fall came not by chance The fall of Adam
chanced not with out the will and ordinance of God.
or fortune, seeing his providence does stretch forth it self even to the
smallest things 10: neither can we say, that any thing does happen, that God
knows not, or cares not for, except we would fall into the opinion of the
Epicures, from the which God preserve us, neither yet by any bare or idle
permission or sufferance, which is separate from his will and sure
determination. For seeing he has appointed the end, it is necessary also
that he should appoint the causes which lead us to the same end: unless we
affirm with the wicked Manichees, that this end happens at all adventures,
or by means of causes ordained by some other God.

Further more, we cannot think that any thing happens contrary to Gods
will, except we deny blasphemously that he is omnipotent and Almighty: As
Saint Augustine notes plainly, in his book De correptione and gratia, chap
104. We conclude F^c^ir. ad Laurent. Chap. 99.
therefore, that this full of Adam did so proceed of the motion of his will,
that notwithstanding it happened not without the will of God: whom it pleases
by a maruailous and incomprehensible mean that the thing which he does not
allow (for as much as it is sin) should not happen without his will. And this is
done, as we said before, that he might show the riches of his glory toward
the vessels of mercy: and his wrath and power upon those vessels, which he
has made to set forth his glory by their shame and confusion 12. For the
final end of Gods counsel is neither the salvation of the elect, nor the
damnation of the reprobate: but the setting forth of his own glory, in saving
the one by his mercy, and condemning the other by his just judgment.

Then to avoid al these blasphemies, unto the which the infirmity of our wits
does draw us, let us confess that the corruption of the principal work that
GOD has made (which is man) is not happened by chance, nor without the will
of him, who according to his incomprehensible wisdom, does make and govern
all things to his glory. Albeit we must confess (in despite of man's
judgment, which was limited in the beginning within a certain compass, and
after was miserably corrupted) that the whole fault of his damnation lies in
man: forasmuch as betwixt the secret and incomprehensible will of God and that
corruption of man's nature, which is the very first occasion of the reprobates
damnation, the The whole fault of ma^s perdition, is in himself, and not in
God.
will of the first man is a mean, which being created good, has willingly
corrupted it self, and thereby opened the door to the just judgment of God,
to condemn al those, to whom it does not please him to show mercy. And if they
would yet object, and cavil, saying, that they cannot resist the will of GOD
13, let us suffer them to their own destruction to plead against him, who will
be able enough to defend his justice, against their quarrelling. Let us rather
reverence that which passes the reach and compass of our wits and turn our
minds wholly to praise his mercy, who by his only grace has saved us, when
we deserved the like punishment and damnation, and were no less sinners and
wicked then they.

CHAP. IIII.
By what order God proceeds to declare and after a sort to execute his
election.

WHen God had determined with himself The foundation of that election which is
manifest to us.
the things before mentioned, he, by a more manifest order of causes, which
notwithstanding was eternal (as all things are present to him) disposed
orderly all the degrees, whereby he would bring his elect unto his king dome.
Forasmuch therefore as he is merciful, and yet could not forget his justice,
before all other things it was necessary, that a Mediator should A Mediator was
necessary.
be appointed: by who^ man might be perfectly restored, and that this should
be done ^y that free mercy and grace which does appear in the ^aluation of
his elect. But ^an, besides that he is so ^eake, that it is not possible ^^r
him to sustain the weight ^f Gods wrath, does also so ^uch fl^tter himself in
that ^is most miserable blindness, (...) he cannot perceive it 1: because he is
wholly in bon^age to sin 2: so that the law of GOD is to him as death 3, so
far is he unable of himself to recover his liberty, or to satisfy the law
of God in the very least ^ote.

God therefore the most merciful father of the elect, moderating in such sort
his justice, with his infinite mercy, appointed his only son, who was the
very same substance, Jesus Christ our Mediator.
and God eternal with him, that at the time determined, he should by the power
of the holy 4 ghost be made very man 5, to the end that both the natures
being joined in Jesus Christ alone Justification and sanctification in Christ.
6, first, all the corruption of man should be fully healed in one man 7, who
should also accomplish all justice 8, and moreover should be able enough to
sustain the judgment of God, and be a priest sufficient and worthy of himself
to appease the wrath of God his father, in dying as a just and innocent, for
them that were unjust and sinners, covering our disobedience, and purging all
our sins which were laid upon him 9. And finally with one only offering and
sacrifice of himself, should sanctify all the elect: mortifying and burying
sin in them, by the partaking of his death and burial: and quickening them
into newnes of life by his resurrection 10: so that they should find more in
him, then they had lost in Adam 11. And to the intent this remedy should not
be found and ordained in vain, the lord God determined to give this his son,
with all things appertaining to salvation 12, to them whom he had determined
in himself to choose, and on the other side, to give them unto his Son: that
they being in him, and he in them 13, might be consummate, and made perfect
in one, by these degrees that follow after: according as it pleased him to
bring forth every one of his elect into this world.

For first, when it pleases him to disclose that secret which he had purposed
from before all beginning 14, at such time as men least look External
vocation.
for it 15 (as men are blinded and yet think they see most clear 16, when as
in very deed death and damnation hangs over their head 17) he comes
suddenly, and sets before their eyes the great danger wherein they are; and
that they might be touched more sharply and lively, he adds to the witness of
their own conscience, being as it were asleep, and dead, the preaching of
his law 18, and The Law.
the examples of his indgements, to strike the^ with the horror of their sins:
not that they should remain in that fear, but rather, that be holding the
great danger thereof, should fly to that only Mediator Jesus Christ 19: in
who^ after the sharp preaching of the law, he sets forth the sweet grace
of the Gospel, but yet with this condition, The Gospel.
that they believe in him 20, who only can deliver them from condemnation
21, and give them right and title to the heavenly inheritance 22: Yet all these
things were but vain if he should only set before men's eyes these secrets,
by the external preaching of his word written, and published in the Church of
God, which notwithstanding is the ordinary means whereby Jesus Christ is
communicated unto us 23: therefore, as touching his elect 24, unto the external
preaching of his word, he joins the inward working of his holy Spirit, The
inward calling.
the which does not restore (as the Papists imagine) the remnants or residue of

is, after the fall of Adam.
serves to no other use, but willingly to sin 25, to flee from God 26, to
hate him 27, and so not to hear him 28, nor to believe in him 29, neither yet
to acknowledge his gifts 30, no not so much as to think a good thought 31: and
finally to be children of wrath and malediction) but contrariwise changes
their hard hearts of stone, into soft hearts of flesh 32, draws them 33,
teaches them 34, lighteneth their eyes 35, and opens their sense 36, their
heart, their ears, and understanding: first to make them to know (as we have
said before) their own misery: and next, to plant in them the gift of faith,
whereby they may perform that condition, which is joined to the preaching of
the Gospel. And that stands in two points: the one, whereby we know Christ
in general, Faith has two parts.
in believing the story of Christ, and the Prophecies which are writ of him
37: the which part of faith, as we shall declare in due place, is sometimes
given to the reprobate. The other, which is proper, and only belongs Faith
which does aporehend justification by Christ, and sanctification.
to the elect, consists in applying Christ (who is universally and
indifferently preached to all men) to our selves, as ours: and that every man
make himself sure of his election, which has been hid before all time in Gods
secret 38, and afterward revealed unto us, partly by the inward testimony of
our conscience through the holy Ghost, joined to the external preaching of
Gods word 39: and partly also by the virtue and power of the same spirit, who
delivering the elect from the servitude of sin 40, persuades and conducteth
them to will and work the things which please God.

These then be the degrees, whereby it pleases God to create and form by his
especial grace, that precious and peculiar gift of faith in his elect, to the
intent that they may embrace their salvation in Jesus Christ. But because this
faith in us is yet weak and only begun, to the end that we may not only
persevere in it, but also profit (which thing is most necessary for all men to
do) first, according to the time that our adoption is revealed unto us, this
faith is sealed in our hearts by the sacrament of Baptism: Baptism.
and after, every day more and more is confirmed and sealed in us by the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper: of the The Lords Supper.
which two Sacraments, the principal end is, that they be sure, and effectual
signs, and pledges, of the communion of the faithful with Christ 41, who is
their wisdom, justice, sanctification, and redemption 42.

For this occasion, it is so oftentimes mentioned with Saint Paul, that we
being justified by faith, have peace with God 43: for whosoever has obtained
the gift of true faith, has also by the same grace and liberality of God,
obtained the gift of perseverance 44. So that in all manner of temptations and
afflictions, he doubts not to call upon God, with sure confidence to
obtain his request A sure confidence.
(as far as it is expedient for him) knowing that he is of the number of
Gods children, who cannot fail him 45.

Moreover, he never swarueth so from the right way, but at length, by the
benefit of Gods grace, he returns again: for, although faith sometime seem
in the elect (as it were for a time) hid and buried, so that a man would think
it were utterly quenched 46 (which God suffers, that men might know their
own weakness) yet it does never so far leave the^, that the love of God and
their neighbor is a together plucked out of their hearts. For no man is
justified in Christ, who also is not sanctified in him 47, and framed to good
works, which God prepared that we should walk therein 48. This is the^ the way
whereby God by his mercy, does prepare (to the full execution of his eternal
counsel) them amongst his elect, who^ it pleases him to reserve, till they
come to ripe age and discretion.

As touching the other, who^ he calls into his kingdom, so soon as they are
borne, or in their tender years, he uses a more short way. For seeing he does
comprehend in that his free covenant, whereof Jesus Christ is the Mediator 49,
not only the faithful, but also their posterity 50, into a thousand
generations 51, calling the same by express words holy 52: there is no doubt
but the Gods adoption or free choice of Infants.
children of the Saints, which appertain to election (whom he only knows)
he has given to his Son, who will not cast them out 53.

CHAP. V.
After what sort almighty God does execute, and effectually declare his
counsel, touching reprobation.

BY these things whereof we have now spoken, it The old Adam is the foundation
of that reprobation which man's judgment can attain unto.
may easily appear, how God makes them to go to their own place 1, whom he
created to that end that he might be glorified in their just condemnation.
For as Christ the second heavenly Adam, is the foundation, and very substance,
and effect, of the elects salvation: so also the first earthly Adam, because
he fell, is the first author of the hate, and so consequently of the damnation
of the reprobate 2. For when God, moved with those causes which he only
knows, had determined to create them to this end, to show forth in them his
just wrath, and power 3, likewise he did orderly dispose the causes, and
means, whereby it might come to pass, that the whole cause of their
damnation, might be of themselves, as has been declared before in the third
Chap. When man then was fallen willingly into that miserable estate whereof we
have spoken in the chap. before: God who hates justly the reprobate, because
they are corrupt: in The judgment of God toward infants that are reprobate.
part of the^ he does execute his just wrath so soon as they are borne 4: and
toward the rest that be of age, whom he reserueth to a more sharp How

judgment, he observes two ways clean contrary one to the other. For as
concerning some he shows them not so much favor, as once to hear of Jesus
Christ, in whom only is salvation 5, but suffers them to walk in their own
ways 6, and run head long to their perdition.

And as for the testimonies that God has left to them of his divinity 7,
serve them to no other use, but to make them without all excuse 8, and yet
through their own default, seeing their ignorance, and sack of capacity, is
the just punishment of that corruption, wherein they are borne.

And surely, as touching that, that they can attain unto in knowing GOD, by
their light, or rather natural darkness (albeit they never failed in the way,
but so continued 9) yet were it not in no wise sufficient for their salvation.
For it is necessary for us that shall be saved, that we know God, not only
as GOD, but as our Father in Christ 10: the which mystery, flesh and blood
does not reveal 11, but the Son himself, to them whom his Father has given
him 12. As concerning others, their fall is more terrible 13. For he An
unprofitable calling or of none effect.
causes them to hear by preaching the outward word of the Gospel 14; but
because they are not of the number of the elect, being called, they hear not
15, and forasmuch as they are not able to receive the spirit of truth 16,
therefore they cannot believe, because it is not given unto them 17,
wherefore, when they are called to the feast, they refuse to come. So that the
word of life is folly unto them, and an offense 18, and finally the savor of
death to their destruction.

There are yet others, whose hearts almighty God opens to receive and believe
the things that they hear: but this is with that general faith, whereby the
devils believe and tremble 20.

To conclude, they which are most miserable of all, those climb a degree
higher, that their fall might be more grievous: for they are raised so high by
some gift of grace, that they are a little moved with some taste of the
heavenly gift 21: so that for the time they seem to have received the seed,
and to be planted in the Church of God 22, and also show the way of salvation
to others 23. But this is plain, that the spirit of adoption, which we have
said to be only proper unto them which are never cast forth 24, but are
written in the secret of Gods people 25 is never communicated to the^ for were
they of the elect they should remain still with the elect 26 All these
therefore (because of necessity, and yet willingly, as they which are under
the slavery of sin 27, return to their vomit 28, and fall away from faith 29)
are plucked up by the roots, to be cast into the fire 30. I mean, they are
forsaken of God 31, who according to his will (the which no man can resist 32,
and yet for all that because of their corruption and wickedness 33) hardens
the^ 34, makes their hearts fat, stops their ears, and blinds them 35:
and to bring this to pass, he uses partly their own vile co^cupiscences, to
the which he has given them up to be ruled, and led by 36: and partly the
spirit of lies, who keeps them wrapped in his snares 37, by reason of their
corruption, from the which as out of a fountain, issues a continual flowing
river of infidelity, ignorance, and iniquity: whereby it follows, that
having as it were made a shippe-wrack of their faith, can by no means escape
the day which is appointed for their destruction, that God may be glorified in
their just condemnation.

CHAP. VI.
Of the last and full execution and accomplishment of Gods eternal counsel,
as well toward the elect as the reprobate.

FOrasmuch as God is justice it self, it is necessary that he should save the
just, The full execution of Gods counsel.
and condemn the unjust. Now they amongst men are only just, who being by
faith joined to Christ 1, grafted 2. rooted in him 3, and made one body with
him 4, are justified and sanctified in him, and by him: whereof it follows,
that the glory to the which they are destinate 5, to the glory of God 6.
appertains to them as by a certain right or title. On the other part, they
which remain in Adams pollution, and death, are justly hated of GOD: and so
condemned by him, not excepting so much as them which die before they sin,
as Adam did 7. But both these manners of executing Gods judgments, as well in
these, as in the other which are elected, are in three sorts: In the elect.
whereof we have already declared the first. For the elect in that same moment
that they have received the gift of faith have after a certain sort passed from
death to life 8, whereof they have a sure pledge 9. But this their life is hid
in Christ, till this corporal death make them to step a degree further, and
that the soul being loosed out of the bands of the body, enter into the joy
of the Lord. Finally, in the day appointed to judge the quick and the dead 11,
when that which is corruptible and mortal, shall be clad with
incorruptiblenesse and immortality and GOD shall be all, in all things, then
they shall see his majesty face to face, and shall surely enjoy that
unspeakable comfort and joy, which before all beginning was prepared for the^;
which is also the reward that is due to the righteousness and holiness of
Christ: who was given for their sins, and raised again from death for their
justification: by whose virtue and spirit, they have proceeded and gone forward
from faith to faith, as shall manifestly appear by the whole course of their
life, and good works 12. Whereas altogether contrary, the reprobate, conceived,
borne, In the reprobate.
and brought up in sin, death, and wrath of God 13, when they depart out of
this world they fall into another gulf of destruction, and their souls are
plu^ged in that endless pa^tie 14, until the day come that their bodies and
souls being joined again, they shall enter into everlasting fire, which is
prepared for the devil and his Angels 15.

Then by these two ways (which are clean contrary one to another) the last
issue and end of Gods judgments shall set forth manifestly his glory to all
men, forasmuch The glory of God.
as in his elect he shall declare him self most just, and most merciful. Most
just I say, for Perfectly just, and perfectly merciful.
that he has punished with extreme rigor and severity the sins of his
elect in the person of his Son, neither did receive them into the fellowship
of his glory, before he had fully and perfectly justified and sanctified them
in his son: And most merciful, forasmuch as he freely appointed with
himself to elect them, and according as he had purposed, chose them freely in
his Son, by calling, justifying, and glorifying them, by means of that same
faith, which he had given them through the same grace and mercy.

On the other side, touching God is perfectly just.
the reprobate, their corruption and infidelity, with such fruits as come
thereof, and testimony of their own conscience, shall so reprove and accuse
the^, that although they resist and kick against the prick: yet the most perfect
justice of God shall be manifest and shine by all men's confession, in their just
condemnation.

CHAP. VII.
After what sort this doctrine may be preached with most profit.

Since we have now declared the effect of this doctrine: it remains also that
we show what order we think best to be observed, in preaching and applying the
same to every particular man.

Whereas many find this matter so sharp and strange, that they fly from it,
as from a dangerous rock: it is partly to be attributed to the malice and
arrogancy of men: and partly to the rashness, and lack of discretion of them
that teach it: and thirdly it is to be imputed to their ignorance which cannot
orderly apply the same to themselves, which faithfully and truly has been
taught of others. Concerning them which sin of malice, it only appertains to
God to amend them: which surely he has done always in his season, and like
wise will do from time to time, to whom he has appointed to show mercy. But
for others which remain obstinate in their sin and wickedness, there is no
cause why we should be moved either for their number, or authority, to
dissemble Gods truth. And as touching the second sort, I have thought these
things principally to be observed in preaching this mystery. What discretion
the matter it self requires.


First, as in all other things 1, so chiefly in this matter of predestination,
they ought to take diligent heed, that in stead of Gods pure and simple truth,
they bring not forth vain and curious speculations or dreams 2. which thing
they cannot choose but do, which go about to compass and accord these secret
judgments of GOD with man's wisdom; and so do not only put difference
betwixt predestination, and the purpose of God, which thing they must needs do,
but separate the one from the other: for they either imagine a certain naked
and idle permission, or else make a double purpose and counsel in God. From
the which errors, they must needs fall into many and great absurdities. For
sometimes they are constrained to divide those things, which of themselves are
joined most straightly: and sometimes, they are compelled to invent a great
sort of foolish and dark distinctions, wherein the far her they occupy
themselves and search, the vvider they stray from the purpose^ and so entangle
their miserable brains, that they can find no way out. This then ought to be
avoided, with all careful diligence chiefly in this matter, which above all
other, ought purely and sincerely to be taught in the Church of God.

Moreover, as much as is possible, let them take heed What manner of words and
speech must be used
though sometimes for a more clear understanding of things, a man may be
bold godly and reverently to do) that no strange manner of speech, or not
approoueable by Gods word be used: and also that such phrases and words, which
the Scriptures approve, be expounded fitly, Consideration of the persons.
lest otherwise any man should take occasion of offense, which as yet is rude
and ignorant.

Furthermore, we must have good respect unto the hearers 3: wherein also we
must make distinction betwixt the malicious, and the rude: and again betwixt
the^ which are wilful ignorant, and those which are not capable through a
simple and common ignorance. For to that further sort, our Lord is accustomed
to set forth plainly the judgment of God 4: but the other must be led by little
and little to the knowledge of the truth 5. Likewise we must take heed, that we
have not so much respect to the weak, that they in the mean season which are
apt to understand, be neglected, and not sufficiently taught: whereof we have
notable examples in S. Paul, which declare to us the wisdom and
circumspection, which he observed in this matter chiefly, in the 9. 10. 11.
14. and 15. chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.

Also, except some great cause let, that they begin at the lowest and most
manifest causes, and so ascend up to the highest (as Paul in his epistle to
the Romans, which is the right order and way to proceed in matters of
divinity, from the law goes to remission of sins, and thence by steps he
mounteth, til he come to the highest degree) or else, let them insist in that
point which is most agreeable to the text or matter: which they have in hand,
rather then contrariwise, to begin at the very top of this mystery and so come
down to the foot. For the brightness of Gods majesty, suddenly presented to
the eyes, does so (...) and dazzle the sight, that afterward, if they be not
through long continuance accustomed to the same, they wexe blind when they
should see other things.

What then remains? that, whether they begin How they may prosecute this
matter.
beneath and ascend upwards, or contrariwise above, and come downward to the
lowest degree, they take always heed, lest omitting that which ought to be in
the midst they leap from one extreamitie to another; as from the eternal
purpose, to salvation, and much more from salvation, to the eternal purpose:
Likewise, from Gods eternal counsel to damnation, or backward from damnation,
to his purpose: leaving the near and evident causes of Gods judgment. Except
perchance they have to do with open blasphemers and contemners of God, who
have need of nothing else, but the sharp pricks of Gods judgment: or else
with men so trained and exercised in Gods word, that there be no suspicion of
any offense.

Finally, that they never so propound this doctrine, as How this doctrine must
be applied.
if it should be applied to any one man particularly 9 (although men must be
used after diverse sorts, some by gentleness, and some by sharpness) unless
some Prophet 7 of God be admonished by some special reuclation: which thing,
because it is out of course, and not usual, ought not lightly to be believed.
When the Ministers also visit the sick, or use familiar and private
admonitions, it is their duty to lift up and comfort the afflicted
consciences, with the testimonial of their election; and again, to wound and
pearce the wicked and stubborn, with the fearful judgment of God: so that
they keep a mean, refrayning ever from that last sentence, which admits no
exception nor condition. For this right and jurisdiction only appertains to
God 8.

CHAP. VIII.
How every man may with profit apply this uniuersal doctrine to himself.

IT is most evident, that they, which teach that man's salvation either in part
or wholly, depends and is grounded in works, destroy the foundation of the
Gospel of GOD 1. And contrariwise, Justification by faith is unprofitable, if
it be seperat from election.
they that teach justification freely by faith, ground on a sure foundation;
but so, that they build upon that eternal counsel of God, whereupon Christ
himself 2, and the Apostle Paul following Christ's steps, groundeth his
doctrine 3. For seeing perseverance in faith is requisite to salvation 4, to
what purpose shall says serve me, except I be sure of the gift of
perseverance? nor we need not fear, least this doctrine make us negligent, or
dissolute: for this peace of conscience whereof we speak 5, ought to be
distinct and separat from foolish security: and he that is the son of God,
seeing he is moved and governed by the spirit of God 9, will never through
the consideration of Gods benefit take occasion of negligence and Peace of
conscience depends on predestination.
dissolution. Then if by this doctrine we had but this one commodity, that we
might learn to assure and cofirme our faith against all brunts that might
happen, it is manifest that they which speak against and resist this article of
religion, either through their wickedness, or else through their ignorance, or
some foolish blind zeal (which happens, when men will me^sure God according to
the capacity of their own wits) subvert and destroy the principal ground and
foundation of our salvation. And in very deed, though some (as I must confess)
do it not purposely: yet do they open notwithstanding, the door to al
superstition and impiety. As for the^* which nowadaies maliciously oppugn the
truth, I beseech the lord, even from my heart, either to turn their minds (if
so be they appertain to the elect) or else to send them a most speedy
destruction, that by their own example they may confirm and establish that
doctrine, which so maliciously they resist. These other I will desire most
instantly, and require them in the name of God, that they would better advise
themselves what they do.

Now, to touch briefly how this doctrine may be applied, let us mark that all
the works of God, even the least of all, are such, that man cannot judge of
them, but in two sorts: that is, either when they are done; or else, by
foreseeing them to come to pass by the disposition of the second and manifest
causes, whose effects have been diligently, and by long use observed, as men
accustom in natural things to do: wherein, notwithstanding men are wonderfully
blind. In this matter then, which is most obscure of all others, it is no
marvel if man's wit be driven into this straight, that it can not otherwise
understand, but by this means, what is determined as touching him self in
this secret counsel of God. But because these are most high mysteries, and
therefore 1. Cor. 2. d.
stand in the observation of those causes which pass all natural things, we
must needs seek farther, and come to Gods word: which forasmuch as without all
comparison, it is more certain, then man's comectures: so it can best directvs
herein and assure us.

The Scripturne then witnesses 7, that all those that God has, according to
his counsel, predestinate, to be adopted his children through Jesus Christ, are
also called in their time appointed, yea and so effectually, that they hear the
voice of him that calls, and believe it 8: so that being justified and
sanctified in Jesus Christ, they are also glorified. Will thou then, How a man
may have assurance of his election.
whatsoever thou art, be assured of predestination, and so in order of thy
salvation, which thou look for, against all the assaults of Satan? assured I
say, not by doubtful conjectures, or our own fantasy, but by arguments, and
conclusions, no less true and certain 9. then if thou were ascended, into

thou begin not at that most high degree: for so thou should not be able to
sustain the most shining light of Gods majesty. Begin therefore beneath at
the lowest order, and when thou shall hear the voice of God 10, sound in thine
ears, and in thy heart, which calls thee to Christ the only Mediator,
consider by little and little, and try diligently 11; if thou be justified and
sanctified in Christ through faith: for these two be the effects or fruits,
whereby the faith is known, which is their cause. As for this thou shall partly

know by the spirit of adoption, which cries within thee Abba Father 12: and
partly by the virtue and effect of the same spirit, which is wrought in thee.
As if thou fall, and so declare indeed, that although sin dwell in thee, yet
it does no more reign in thee 13. For is not the holy Ghost he, that causes
us not to let slip the bridle, and give liberty willingly to our naughty and
vile concupiscences 14, as they are accustomed, whose eyes the prince of this
world blinds 15? or else who moves us to pray, when we are The effects of
the holy Ghost in the elect.
cold, and slothful? who stirs up in us those unspeakable gronings 16? Who
is he that when we have sinned (yea and sometimes willingly and wittingly)
ingendreth in us an hate of the sin committed: and not for the fear of
punishment, which we have therefore deserved, but because we have offended
our most merciful father 17?

Who is he, I say, that testifies unto us that our sighings are heard, and
also moves us to call daily God, our God, and our father, even at that time
when we have trespassed against him 18? Is it not that spirit, which is freely
given unto us as a gift, for a sure and certain pledge of our adoption 19?
Wherefore, The assurance of the vocation is known by faith, and so by the
vocation the election.
if we can gather by these effects, that we have faith, it follows that we
are called and drawn effectually. And again, by this vocation, which we have
declared properly to belong to the children of God, that is evidently proved,
which we took in hand to show, that is, for as much as we were predestinat by
the eternal counsel and decree of God (the which he had determined in
himself) to be adopted in his Son, therefore we were given to him: whereof
the conclusion follows, that since by the most constant will of God 20, which
only is grounded on it self, and depends on none other thing, we are The
confidence to persevere and to be saved, is sure and certain.
predestniate, and no man can take us out of the hands of the Son: also
seeing that to continue and persevere in the faith is necessary, it follows I
say, that the hope of our perseverance is certain, and so consequently our
salvation: so that to doubt any more of it, is evil and wicked 21. So far
then it is against reason to say that this doctrine makes men negligent or
dissolute, that contrariwise, this alone does open us the way, to search out
and understand, by the power of the holy ghost* Gods deep secrets, as the
Apostle plainly teaches 22, to the end that when we know the^ (albeit we know
the^ here in this world but after a sort 23, so that we must daily fight with
the spiritual armor against distrust 24,) we may learn to behave our selves
not idlelie, but rather to persevere valiantly 25, to serve and honor God, to
love him, to fear him, to call upon him, that daily more and more as says S.
Peter, as much as in us lies, we may make our vocation and election certain
26.

Moreover, how shall he stand sure and constant against so many grievous
tentations, both within and without, and against so many assaults of fortune
(as the world does term it) that is not well resolved in this point, which is
most true? that is, that god according to his good will, does all things
whatsoever they be, and what instruments and means soever he uses in working
of the same, for the commoditio of his elect 27. Of the which number he is,
that finds himself in The election only does comfort us in all afflictions.
this danger and trouble 28. As touching the other point, which concerns
reprobation, because no man can call to mind the determinat purpose of election,
but at the same instant the contrary will come to remembrance (besides that in
the holy scripture these two are oftentimes joined together) it must The
doctrine of reprobation ought not to be suppressed.

not to be talked of, do great injury to the spirit of God. Therefore this part

modesty, that the height of Gods judgments may at all times bridle our
curious fanfies: in such sort, that we do It may not be applied particularly.
not apply it particularly to any man, nor to any certain company. For in this
sort also it differs from election, because election (as has been said) is
revealed to us by the spirit of God with in our selves, not in others, whose
hearts we cannot know. And reprobation is ever hid from men, except it be
disclosed by God, contrary to the common course of things. For who can tell,
if God have determined to show mercy at the last house of death to him which
has spent all his life past lowdly and wickedly 29? But this trust ought not
to encourage any man to maintain, and continue in his sin and ungodliness.
For I speak of those things which we ought to consider in others: for the
examples of such mercy of GOD, are very rare, neither any man that is wise,
will promise to himself through a vain security and trust, that thing which
is not in his own power 30.

It is therefore sufficient if we can understand generally that there be
vessels prepared to perdition 31: the which seeing God does not reveal unto us
who they are, we ought both in example of life and prayer diligently endeavor
to win and recover to We must labor to win all men.
their salvation, yea even very such of whom by seeing their horrible vices we
almost despair 32. And if we observe this order, we shall receive great
fruit of this doctrine. For first, by the knowledge The doctrine of reprobation
makes men humble.
heerof, we shall learn humbly to submit our selves to the majesty of God, so
that the more we shall fear and reverence him, the more we ought to labor to
confirm in our It makes the grace of God to be better known of the elect.
selves the testimony of our election in Christ 33.

Furthermore, when we shall diligently consider the difference, which through
the mercy of God is betwixt men, which are all alike subject to the self same
curse and malediction, it cannot be, but we must acknowledge and embrace more
earnestly, the singular goodness of God, then if we did make this grace
common to all men indifferently, or else referred the cause of the inequality
of this grace to men 34.

Besides this, when we know that faith is a special gift of God, shall we not
receive it more willingly when it is offered, and be more careful to have the
same to increase, then if we should imagine It brings a godly care
(as some do) that it is in every man's power to turn and repent when he
will; because (they say) the Lord would that all men should be saved, and
will not the death of a sinner.

Finally, when we see the doctrine of the Gospel not only despised of all
the world, but also cruelly persecuted: and when we see so great falsehood
and rebellion amongst men, what thing then can better confirm It does confirm
us against all offenses.
and fortify us, then to be assured that nothing chances by fortune: that
GOD knows his 35, and that they which commit these things (except the Lord
GOD turn their hearts) are those which are destinate, not by chance, but by
the sure and eternal counsel of GOD, to be as it were a glass, wherein the
anger and power of God does appear? Truth it is, that these things can never
be so commodiously and perfectly treated of, that man's reason and wit cannot
find out some thing to reply always to the contrary; yea and so kindles with
desire of contradiction, that it is ready to bring an action against God, and
to accuse and blame him, as chief author of all things. But let the Devil
roar and discontent him self, and the wicked kick and winse: yet their own
conscience shall The reprobate resist against God in vain.

the grace and mercy of our God, shall deliver and freevs 37, in the day of
Christ. To whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost, praise, glory, and honor
be given for ever.

SO BE IT.

THE PLACES AND testimonies of the Scriptures, which are alleged in this
treatise, and marked by numbers, it seemed good to place apart; partly that
being separate they might be better weighed and understood: and partly because
they could not for the multitude thereof be contained in the margent of the
book. And here we have compassed every number within these two lines () to
the intent they might be more easily found out.

did any evil (for in so saying, he should not seem to exclude any thing, but
actual sin, and incredulity) but says expressly, before he was borne,
whereby he excludes the original sin, and all that, which might be
considered in the person of Esau by his birth, from the cause of the hate.

Therefore anon after, when he shows how the reprobate murmur, and reply,
he does not say, that they speak in this sort; Why does not GOD hate others
alike, seeing they are also borne in the same corruption that we be? the
Apostle speaks no such words, but he says their reason is in this sort; Who
can resist his will? for hereof man's reason ^^thereth, that they are unjustly
condemned. And yet S. Paul does not answer, that God would so, because he saw
that they would be corrupt, and so consequently, that the cause of his decree
should be grounded on their corruption (the which answer had bin clear and
resolute, if it had been true) but forasmuch as he says plainly, it so
pleased GOD, and it was not in their power to change this his good pleasure,
he brideseth man's wisdom, that it might reverence and wonder at Gods
mysteries, as it is most just to do. And also incourageth the elect, to honor
