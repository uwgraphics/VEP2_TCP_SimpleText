THE WARMING STONE.

Excellent Helps really sound out, tried, and had, by a Warming Stone in his
Case, which not costing much, will save much cost in fire, and withal avoid
the danger of fire: And likewise is very useful and comfortable for the colds
of aged and sick people, and for Women with child, and in Childbed:

As also for Fluxes, Rheumes, Colicks, Ruptures, or any cold disease: And for
those that in Beds, Studies, Shops, Ships, Churches, or elsewhere, have need of
heat, yet cannot conveniently make use of Fire:

And likewise for the Poor, when having no fire of their own, they may borrow
the heating of this stone at a Neighbors fire, if his Charity be not
altogether cold.

These Stones with their Cases are to be sold at where more particular
satisfaction may be had of the Contents of the Book.

The Warming Stone.
THe decay of natural heat in aged persons and in many others, by sickness,
ill accidents, and their continual sitting, makes them to need the helps of
Artificial warmth; and my self through the blessing of God have thereby often
received ease of my griefs, and I verily believe the preservation of my life
in many grievous extremities. Once (I remember) when I was dangerously
oppressed with often and very strong vomiting, and did rise out of my bed and
go into the cold so many times, and so speedily one after another, that I could
neither give heat to my bed, nor receive any from it: Another time also when
by a hurt in my foot my grief was so exceedingly increased, that both my foot
and leg were grown full of black spots, and white between, from the sole of
the foot to the knee, and most which saw it took it to be a Gangrene, which
they thought to be uncurable without cutting off my leg, which also was so
mortified with cold that I could give it no heat from my body; I then by the
blessing of God (as I have many other times done) maintained heat in it by the
help of a kind of stone, which I find to be apt to receive heat much sooner,
and likewise to retain it much longer than any other thing which I could find
upon any reason or trial. For I found clothes heated by the fire would quickly
lose their warmth, and likewise boords could not retain their heat long, and
that brick and freestone required much time to heat them, and held it but a
little while; and that other stones were not able to endure strong heating, but
would suddenly fly in pieces; whereas this stone being well seasoned at the
first with a moderat heat, will both receive it quickly, and keep it very long,
and impart it very kindly and agreeable unto nature. When my feet have bin
cold, warming the same stone by the sire, and putting the soles of my feet
thereon, it has in one quarter of an hour recovered me more heat unto them,
then scorching them by a violent fire, could have done in an whole hour; When
I have been likewise grievously pained and tortured with the Colicke, and
wind in my Guts, the strength of the heat of this stone has (by applying it
unto my belly) suddenly eased and cured me. My Wife being delivered of our
eldest child, I came to visit her, to know how she did after that great
danger; she told me that she was laid on a Trundle-bed to make her sweat,
after her weakening with pain and travel in childbirth; but the bed being
somewhat too short for her (she being tall of person) and her feet reaching
beyond the frame of the bed, she could get no sufficient heat unto them to
procure sweat; which as soon as I heard, I promised I would make her a
medicine for it quickly, and did so, by warming a stone, which did bring her to
so kindly a sweat, as that she recovered the danger of that Childbirth, and
by the Blessing of God brought me many more Children afterward This Warming
Stone also has helped a Woman great with Child, who had a great ache in her
thigh, and thought she could not be cured, till she were freed of her burden
by Childbirth, yet by the help of the warmth of this Stone, found perfect
remedy above two months before the time of her delivery came: And as it is a
thing certainly known, that the least cold in Childbed, (which cannot be
recovered by the sole strength of their then weakened natural heat) brings
certain death; so I know no other remedy so likely to recover heat, sweat and
strength in any such accident, as by the help of these warming Stones, in
their cases, either one or more of them (as need shall require) being applied
unto any part of the Body that wants it. This has been tried by a woman whose
strength failing her to free the after burden; those which were about her not
knowing what other help to give her, they applied this warming Stone, and by
the help of the heat thereof, and the Blessing of God, nature wrought so
well, that within one hour, she escaped that danger and recovered her health
and strength again. Another also who was grown so pale and cold after long
travel, that the midwife who was sent for to help her, finding and feeling
her feet and her face to be cold, supposed she had been dead, and said unto
those who had sent for her, she marvelld why they had sent for her, to come to
a dead body: they answered her she was not dead, though very weak: whereupon
rubbing her face, and finding some warmth therein, she caused them presently
to send to her house with all speed for a Couple of these warming Stones, by
the help of the heat whereof applied to her feet and her Belly, God blessed her
endeavors so well, that both the woman and the child were preserved.

One of my Neighbors also, who had been long weak and sickly, and newly had
her old grief and weakness much increased by the loss of her eldest son,
when with all the help that she could get by Physic, in a long night she
could take little rest; by the warmth of these Stones (the one being applied to
her feet, and the other to the bottom of her belly) she found more ease and
sounder sleep, then she could do at any time in a quarter of a year before:
And she told me that when her maid had forgotten (after an eight or ten days
using thereof) to provide this help for her, she slept as ill, as she was wont
to do before; but now (God be praised) is very well amended both in health and
strength: The same party also being so extremely weakened, with such a grievous
pain in her back as she was neither able to go nor stand, and told her
husband, that if it should continue with her but three days, she thought
verily it would cost her life, by applying these warming stones to the place
grieved, within 3 hours was able to walk about her chamber; at which her
husband told me he wondered exceedingly, how so great an alteration could be
wrought in so short a time.

The help hereof also has recovered those who were so endangered by taking
cold in their ruptures, that both themselves and their friends dispaired of
their lives, because the fat of their guts being fallen down into their cods,
and there grown hard and stiff by the cold, could not possibly be replaced,
till strong heat had resolved it into softness again: and so there was means
found to return them into their due place; by which (God be praised) some who
desired to be prayed for publicly in the church, being out of hope of life,
have recovered health and strength again, though one of them was near three
score and ten when by this means he was helped. It has likewise done exceeding
much good to many that have had very violent fluxes (whereof some of them have
bin bloody) who by the help of these stones applied to their belly and their
hinder parts both at one time, and the help of heating their drink by the fire
as hot as they could take it, have recovered. The same remedy likewise helps
much to abate the violent cold fits of agues, and being applied to the stomach,
strengthens the weakness thereof very much, against the cough or any disease
which comes of a cold cause: for it exceedingly helps the weakness of the
stomach, because all good digestion being made by heat, as extreme outward
colds weaken it by abating that heat, so this outward heat strengthens it
much by adding more warmth unto it: as we find, that boiled, baked, or roasted
meat being eaten hot, that heat helps us much to concoct the same meat. And
whereas we seek help by artificial liquors that have an extraordinary heat, to
help the cold weakness of nature by their strength, if too little be taken it
does little good, if too much, much harm; whereas the heat of these stones may
be duly tempered to our use, being continued, increased, abated, or removed
suddenly, as the diseased party shall think fit. The same stones also put into
the bed, do not only supply the need of a warming pan, but being put into a
case lined two fingers thick every where, with wool between, frise on the
outside, and canvas on the inside, will retain a comfortable heat in the bed
for ten hours together, and a sencible heat for fourteen, if it be thoroughly
warmed; which must be done as hot as may be, without burning the case, which is
tried by spitting on the stone, or sprinkling water on it, for if it hiss not
it is never too hot. I make the case of canvas on the inside, because it is not
so apt to burn as woollen cloth; and have wool between, because it sorts
better with any part of the body than cloth does, and by reason of the
thickness thereof brings not an over-violent heat in the beginning, yet
continues it much longer than cloth or linen could do: and the frise on the
outside is softer and warmer than other stuff. And a stone in a case thus
made, may be applied to the head, feet, belly, or any other part of the body
that has need of it, and may be as soon put away if the heat be too great.

It is also exceeding useful for all scholars to heat their hands and feet,
when they must attend their studies in cold weather. And for all persons which
by their trades in such seasons must keep their shops, or for the service of
God continue in the Church. And such as travel by sea, who may have these
stones warmed by the fire, though they cannot warm themselves in that place
where the fire is. The small cost which belongs to it is mostly in providing
the stone and case at first; for the stone will be heated by the same fire
which is made for any other purpose, either to bake, boil, brew, or roast, or
by any other fire, either laid upon it, or set against it, by convenient
turnings, that all parts of the stone may heat alike: Which may be done without
any hinderance of any of the aforesaid uses. And by trial I find, that two
about nine or ten inches long, and six or seven inches broad, will do more
service, and are more easy to be found than a single one of double the length
and breadth, because they will be less subject to breaking with falling, and
are the more easily put to the fire and taken from it, and moved to and fro in
the bed with more speed and ease than a great single one can be, yet may,
being put together, fill a greater room than the single one could do, by
adding warmth, on each side, to any part of the body that shall lie between
them, and likewise at one time be applied to several places. And such poor
people as have no fire of their own, they may heat it at their neighbors
fire, which will damnifie them no more, then lighting one candle by another;
and whereas no fire can be maintained without consuming the fuel which makes
it, and that cannot be provided without continual charge, according to the
wasting thereof, this stone being so heated will keep his heat without cost for
diverse hours, in other places, but in the bed for a whole night, and that
without renewing the heat, or troubling the rest of the party, who needs the
warmth of it. These uses and experiments will be verified, by the witness of
many persons who have very often, and do daily make use thereof, some of which
have not bin more averse, from being persuaded to try it in the beginning, then
afterward they have been loath to leave the benefits they have found thereby;
and I am very confident that by due observation of the quality of these (...)
many other uses of them will be found out, besides these here mentioned.

This same stone being laid under the head of a child that was much stopped in
his breath by a cold, did in one night clear and free the passage of his
breath: and likewise being laid under the head of an old man that was very
deaf, did in such sort help him, that his neighbors wondered to see the
change that was wrought in him.

An ancient Doctor of Physic of London testifies it gave a Patient of his more
ease in the cure of the Sciatica, then any outvvard Medicine that he could
apply.
