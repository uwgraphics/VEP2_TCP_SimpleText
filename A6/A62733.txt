To the Honorable the COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED.
The humble Petition of the Reduced Officers and Soldiers entrusted on the
behalf of the subscribers of a late Petition presented to this Honorable
House.
Shows,
THat their deep sense of those uncessant and endless clamours that did attend
your Honors, the extreme Pennury and thraldom of their fellow Officers and
Soldiers, and your Honors willingness to remove the same (expressed by your
several Notes and Orders) encouraged them to contrive such a way for their
present subsistence, and future satisfaction, as they humbly conceived might be
most effectual to those ends, and least prejudicial or obstructive to the
grand affairs of this Kingdom, which being referred to a select Committee,
was after several debates approved on, then the particular heads twice read in
this Honorable House, first Committed and at last past, and ordered that an
Ordinance should be brought in, in pursuance thereof, which respective
considerations has invited your Petitioners, to an Elaborate and expensive
attendance, wherein, if they shall be longer delayed they must inevitably be
ruined and the rest perish, And left their silence might argue a guilt, they
have thought fit to take notice of some un-merited prejudices, that are thrown
upon them by converting the prosecution of their honest intention, into a
dishonest and destructive design, wherein they presume the said Committee will
give sufficient Testimony of their Candid affections, and constant Honor to
this House, expressed by their Civilityes in all their Addresses to them.

The premises your Petitioners humbly submit to your Honors consideration and
therefore pray That you would no longer prerogue the passing of the Ordinance,
now before you, so as by virtue thereof, there may be an evident assurance to
gain the present advance of the hundred thousand pounds already voted to make
up the three Months full pay, those indurance released and all protected, for
prevention of those cruel and un-heard-of miseries that will otherwise of
necessity acrue to the said Petitioner, whose enforced cries and unpittyed
sufferings. (for want of their so dearly-deserved sallary) cannot but attract
some heavy judgments from the God of Justice on this whole Nation which we
dread to think on, it being in no humane power, but yours to divert and whereby
you will perpetuate your former engagements on them which is the hearty Prayers
of

James Mydhope, Richard Sandys, Edward Aldrich, Walter Bosvill, Edward Freeman,
