TO THE No less Virtuous than Ingenious Mris MARY MORE; Upon Her Sending Sir
Thomas More's PICTURE (OF HER OWN DRAWING) TO THE LONG GALLERY AT THE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS In OXON.
MADAM,
YOur Benefaction has bin such,
That few can think it is a Woman's Touch:
So to the Life was Issa drawn Mart. Epigr. 110. Lib. I.
(the Bitch)
That the Beholder doubted which was which.
Seldom so Rare an Artist has there bin;
Yet every Lady Knows to Draw Man In.
Since then Your Pencil far exceeds our Pen,
Let it be said I was the First of Men
Could stop in Scribbling -- Know we study Thrift,
And fancy This a Richer New-Years-Gift.
When One in Shadows, The Other deals in Rhyme,
Painters and Poets should knock off in Time.
Janus will knit both Brows too, if I trouble You
Longer, or interrupt Him,
Yours, R. W
Xbris 26. 1674.
