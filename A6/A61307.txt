ENGLANDS Delight In this Parliament: Expressed in a Reasonable
Acrostick-Petition to the KING'S most Excellent Majesty.
With Reflections upon the happy Reign of Queen Elisabeth, that absolute and
Prime Opposer of Popery.
Cleave to thy People with a full Consent:
Hear what the People speak in Parliament:
Armed with their Love, you need no Pol^tick Arts:
Riches will flow, now, you are King of Hearts!
Lend all your Strength your Peoples Love to gain.
ELISABETH the Pattern of your Reign,
She lived beloved, 'twas her Ineritance:
Succor to that brave HENRY King of France:
The Irish in their own Bogs She did Smother;
Unto the BELGIC Provinces a MOTHER:
All Nations feared or felt her dreadful hand:
ROME'S proud Conspirators did trembling stand.
Trust Providence, 'twill bring Thee safe to Land.
ENGLAND's thy Wife, the Marriage Bed maintain,
Thy Name's no longer Charles but Charlemaign,
Her Love's a FORT stronger than strongest Towers:
Her Hand, her Heart, her Treasure, All is Yours:
The Turk whose Proud Ambition all things scorns:
His Pale Face Moon will then pull-in its Horns:
Sweet gentle Winds from every Coast will blow,
The Triple Crown shall humbly kiss your Toe.
London, Printed for the Author, William Sambach, 1680.
