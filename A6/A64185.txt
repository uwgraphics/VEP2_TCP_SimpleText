Cudgelled, and Clapper-claude.

By Interpretation.

Hang up a Knave Mercurius, Quarter a Traitor Britannicus.

BRittanicus, have at thee, look to thy self, for good faith I am JOHN TAILOR,
and let it not make thee proud, that I am pleased to descend so low as to write
either to thee or of thee. Your Prophetic writings, (with Bookers conjunction)
and delicate foysted Declarations, and Relations (being all Nothings) of their
worthy Orders, Acts, and Votes, with their Don Quixotticall, Amadis de
Galldicall Battles and Ayery Victories, which being with judgment and
discretion weighed and considered are Nothing, nor ever will be any thing to
any purpose.

And if the round Iobbernoll of Brittanicus were but capable of the capacity of
Owley-glasse, he might see that all the great Somethings which he so dignifies,
falsifies and magnifies, are nothing, have done Nothing (but Mischief) which
is worse then Nothing.

You are merrily pleased to call Aulicus the Scripe, or Register to the Junto,
whereby I perceive that you can break Jests better then make them, and that
you have a Foolish Rogueish desire to jeere your betters, but that your
plentiful want of Wit is your great impediment.

Then you fall a Scoffing the Nobility here (which is no news as you promised
a Relation of news in your lying title) but sure it is no new thing (though
worth nothing) It is your weekly custom to promise the People news, and pay
them with Nonsense, your infamous works have titles of Relations, and the
froathy substance within is nothing, but your own inventions, fopperies, and
fictions, for what knowledge of the Affairs of great Britain can the people
pick out of your Ignorant and Ridiculous Railing and Revileing His Majesty, His
Royal Queen, Honorable Counselors, and all our Nobility, Gentry or others,
with the Reverend Clergy, calling them Papists, Jesuits, Priests; are these
things new intelligences, no, all the World knows those damnable designs to
be no news from you. But it were news worth the hearing, to hear any truth
at all from you, and it is supposed that you writ purposely to make your self
merry, and for some other Trencher Respects, to delight as wise men as your
self in reading and laughing at your fooleries.

What knowledge of intelligence, or what profit have the people for their money
and time spent, in buying and reading your scoffing scandalls and calumnies,
you are pleased to bestow fine Epithites upon them, as fantastical Heads and
Hydes, and the grave and Reverend Judges your wickedness is pleased to trench
upon Rastalls Abridgements, and to call them Rascals, neither can the Sergeant
at Laws Quoyfe, or Judges Nightcap escape the flowt of your fools cap, the
Quoyfes (you say) are Quoifes of injustice, and the Night-caps of false
Judgment; Then you boast of your (and none but yours) Parliaments late
success, and your Scottish brethrens advance, It is well known, that your
Parliament has the Art to Create, make, form, fashion and frame Success into
what shape they please, and be it either good, bad, or indifferent, they can
metamorphose it into fears, jealousies, Public thanksgivings, and these
ingredients being melted with zeal in the secret Chrusible of the
Publique-Faith, and so with hey pass and Repasse Legerdemaine it is
Transformed into money, and that money into Rebellion. For your brethren (the
Scots) advance, I will give you leave to brag of their success.

Then you seem to be displeased at Aulicus, for speaking truth when he called
you Rebels, I do heartily wish that you might truly give him the Lie, but if
you be not Rebels, I shall suppose Faux, and Ravilltack to be Honest men, and
that Wat Tyler, Jack Cade, Hackett, Penrye, John a Leiden, and Knipperdolling
dyed true Martyrs.

Britanicus says, the Ensign is yet unhanged, that said he would kill the
King, it is very likely, for I am sure you have hanged, Imprisoned, Murdered,
Plundered or Beggered as many as you could lay hold on, of such as were either
Ecclesiastical or Temporal Protestants, as would spend their livelihoods and
dearest blood in defense of their true Religion, and service of their
Sovereign. But your evasion is, that your Traiterous Ensign did not mean
King Charles, But General King is the man he meant to kill, in this you are a
Iesuited Equivocater in General, and a lying Knave in particular; you brag
what a brave Cornelius Burgess you have, he is a very wholesome Purified and
Repurified man, for the Records of the Spiritual Court does keep an account,
that he has been twice purged in that court, for two female servants of his,
who by his joining of Jyblets were both great with child in his own house. But
these spiritual Court purgings, was to weak Physic to work upon him, so that
he (relapsing) fell to the old trade again, for which he was to be let blood,
purged, dieted, and disciplined in the High Commission; But that he and his
friends so labored the dissolution of that Court, that it was Abollished, and
Cornelius (by that means) was left uncur'd, and I doubt uncurable, and I have
heard of Cornelius his Tub, which is the fittest Pulpit for him and his
Rebellious doctrine, he is no Cornelius Tacitus, (as you say) but it were
better for the peace of the Church and State, if he were Tacitus, with all the
Rabble of his Tribe of Sectaries; Tacitus was a Roman Historian, and wrote the
lives of some wicked Heathen Emperors, but your Loquatious Burges (whose
discretion had more appeared had he bin Tacitus) has with the Vollubillity of
his seditious verbosity, omitted Suetonius and destroyed Tranquillius; In a
word, he has talked so much strife and mischief, that thereby our former
blessed Peace and Tranquillity is as rare to be found as Truth and Loyalty is
either in him, or in his Imposture Scribe Mercurius Britanicus.

Next; he pursues the Bishops (in the old Beaten way of Railing) which is as
common as the barking of dogs, and therefore I hold him not worthy of an
Answer. His Ridiculous scoffs of the Earl of Bristol, the Lord Cottiugton, and
Sir Francis Windebank, calling them Spanish Figgs and Reisins, is such poor
silly Rogish stuff, that the folly of Will Summers, or John Dorye were
profound wisdom in respect of it.

Then Sir, (to show your love to Learning (like the rest of your sweet Masters
Magnificoes, Clarissimoes Committee and Common Council men) you jeere at the
Schools, which is a place renowned for a famous Library through more Kingdoms
Provinces and Nations, then are in the Christian World, and the ever renowned
founder (Sir Tho. Bodley, will for ever stand in the Records of fame, when the
memory of the Calumniators of that Magnificent fabric shall Rot, Stink, and be
justly held odious to God and Man.

The Archbishop of Armaugh falls next into the Roleing stream or Railing
strain of your Aspersions, and indeed your commendations and approbation
either of him, or any other man, is one of the greatest disparagements to blur
and blemish a good Reputation, on the other side, the Ridiculous and Mallicious
Scandalls which you are pleased to bluster against. Virtue, does illustrate the
brightness of it, and make it shine more Gloriously perspicuous, (for mine own
part I had Rather Brittanicus, and all his friends were hanged then that either
he or they should be at the charges to bestow a good Report on me, for every
honest man would take me to be a Brownist or Anuabaptist, a Rascal, a Rebel
and a Traitor.

The profound learning, the sincerity of the Protestant Religion, the Loyalty
to his Sovereign, the extraordinary pains of his Studdying, the manner,
Method, and Elegancy of his frequent Preaching, his Charity, Affability and
carriage of his Exemplary life and conversation; all these virtues, being the
unquestionable practice of this most Reverend Bishop, cannot escape the
snapping and snarling of Brittanicus, whereby the danger of a Knaves good
Report is most plainly manifested.

Brittanicus, you do Amplify, and seem to stellify the Rebellious Lord
Denbigh, and some others, with the Attainted and Outlawed Say and Seal, and if
there were no other proofs of their Delinquency, your justification were
sufficient Testimony. Deare-ring (you brag is come to you, I pray you make
much of him, he is an excellent jewel to hang in the Ear of a Gallows, at
which time a Turned shirt of Holland may serve him for a Winding sheet (if the
Crows be not couzned.) You say you look for Hopton next, (you may look for
him, but I think you dare neither look or see him where he is, if you look for
him in Imitation of Deereing, you may look your Eyes out, and if you and your
Masters and Members had the grace to be good Subjects till Hopton turn
Rebel, the miseries of this Kingdom would quickly have a happy period; in the
mean space look to Hopton, for Hopton looks for you.

You extol the Lord Gray of Warke and your Speaker (nine yards London measure
above Ursa minor,) Prophesying that they with the Common-Counsell-men shall
fill Chronicles; in this you are believed, for there are many men Cronicled for
disloyalty to their Princes, and setting of Kingdoms in combustious contention,
and why not they. And then you (victoriously) do jeere our victories, you say
we took certain prisoners, one was a Trooper with five shllings 3d in his
pocket, three men in scarlet breeches, and one dragoon in an old plush doublet,
in this you keep your promise with your chapmen, in letting them have some
News for their money, and no doubt but some of them have so much wit as to
believe you.

But you prize your Generals blood at an inestimable value, that every drop af
it is a Ruby or an Emerauld, It is wonder that his exceeding Excellency does
not beat thee for thy gross flattery, for he knows himself to be scarcely
worth a Peble, and his Loyalty to his King were overvalued at the rate of a
Saint Martins Pearl.

You tax us that all our letters are falsities, and we know that though they
be written with all grounds of real truths, yet you have the art to falsify
them, either by new transcribing, misinterpreted and prejudicate constructions,
or forged counterfeit Letters of your own devising and writing, which Letters
have been often interpreted by your selves, sometimes at Sea, out of a Catch or
an Oysterboate, by your victorious and unmatchable, Admirable Admiral, and
others have been secretly conveyed to your Generals and Commanders, who have
easily taken the poor papers, and sent them to London, by speedy order they
have been Printed, (as full of your own Lies, as your malice and the Devil
could thrust into so small Rooms) then they have been dispersed as dangerous
plots and conspiracies, plotted by Papists, Royalists, and Cavaliers; and
public thanksgivings commanded to be given in all Churches for Great and
extraordinary deliverances from fabulous dangers of your own devising.

Prinne you are pleased to entitle, your Protomartyr, in the Worst times, and a
Champion in the Best, Prinne has heard of me lately in a larger tract, in my
Answer to his Traitorous Pamphlet of the Power of Parliaments; and Vindication
of the new Counterfeit Great-Seale, Pennrye and Prinne are somewhat near in an
Annagram, they are nearer in their Treasons, and no doubt they will be nearest,
when Prinne suffers as Pennry did at Tyburne (for less Treason) in Queen
Elizabeth's time.

The truth is, you do make bold with the names of some, who have been so bold
to beat you squarely, and made you run away Roundly, for which causes I will
tolerate you to be angry, and revenge your Masters cause and your own with
railing and playing the fool, that is another full point.

It is your profitable and safest way to keep your distance in staying at
London or Westminister, and abuse his Majesty, and as many as do Love Serve
and Honor Him at Oxford, But your Lies are not limited only hither, for their
universality flees all over Great Britain, by the false name of news: and
because the Gentleman is so exquisite and exact in taxing names in stead of
news, the name of Mercurius Britanicus, (as I am Certified) is James Hudson,
which in an Annagram is the Sphinx, which the Oedipus of my Pericranion makes a
true signification, of, for it opens the Riddle of the Matter, the Marrow, and
the very intrincicall secrets of your name and Pamphlets. As thus, JAMES
HVDSON, annagram, O, HIS MAD NVES,

Thus your very name includes the nature of your weekly Relations, the mad nues
of James Hudson, has made abundance of fools, and knaves as mad as himself,
he is mad in writing, and they are out of their Wits, with countenancing,
buying, Reading, and believing his madness, which does blow the Coals that
Inflames this Mad Rebellion. But himself and his damnable Lies and Labors,
are more Really described in another Annagram, of Mercurius Brittanicus, with
his own name mixed with it; As thus. MERCVRIVS BRITTANICVS, JAMES HVDSONNE,
Annagramma, BVRN MI NONSENSE, WHI, IT IS ACVRST DREAMS. You see Sir, that your
own name, with your accursed Pamphlets Title, does most plainly demonstrate the
lewdness, badnesse, and madness of your pestiferous News, and the reason is,
you acknowledge it worthy to be Burnt, as being your Nonsense, the Question Why
it should be Burnt is, because it is Acurst Dreams.

Thus you see that Tailor the Waterman (whose name you abused and Scoft amongst
his betters) has fidled a little with your name for this once.

I could play with some of your Masters Memberships such as have gotten too
good estates in being bad servants to His Majesty, As, Henry Vane Senior,
annagram, Ruins any Honer,

Henry Vane Junior, annagram, I Honer vain Ruyn,

Or, William Fines, annagram, I am Sinful Evil.



I could fool with the quondam Grooms name, and tell him, there was a time when
he was Rich and very poor at once, till by his Majesty's Grace, he was Rich in
Honor and estate, and now by his Ingratitude, he is turned poor again, scarce
worth a Clout or Ragge of Holland.

Then you tell us that Denmark and France are puzzled by the Sweadish design;
indeed it behooves all the Kings of the Earth, to take it into serious
consideration how dangerous it is for Monarchy, to be Assaulted by a
Rebellious Anarchie. And (Arrogantly) you spend your Judgment, that nothing
can help but Spain, and the pawn of Ireland, yes Sir, there is one that you
know not, (or scarcely ever think on) that both can and will help, without the
help of man or foreign Nations, or pawn of a Kingdom. If you would but take
God in your mind, you would quickly guess who it is that will help, but your
cause is so bad, that you are feign to buy and beg help of your Brethren,
(some Rebellious Scots) for the payment of whom, you have pawned more then
Kingdoms, for you have morgaged your souls to the Devil, by your execrable
perjury, Oaths, Vows, Protestations and Covenants.

You hear that Holland is about to set forth some Declaration at this time, if
it be of his own writing, I shall do him the Honor to Laugh at it. You call
Warwick, your unmatchable Admiral, a brave man by Sea and Land, It is true
that he is unmatchable in this Rebellion, and his marks of a Brave man, is his
wicked constancy in an accursed cause. Sir Tho. Fairfax, and Sir William
Brereton are to high (you say) for any title that you can give them, they are
not so high as they deserve, by ten steps at least.

Then you tell us, that you had forgot one piece of News, you may do well, to
let us have some small piece for our money, for you have told us of no news
yet, But what is your piece of News, some good stuff no doubt, like the rest
before; But stand a side and be uncovered, this news is an humble wish, that
(for the Edification of the Ignorant people) their two thin Howses of Lower
uppermost, and Upper lowermost (which he calls the Estates) would be pleased,
beneath and above, to annex to their commands, for the Reading them in all
Churches, for the City knows enough already, and the Country to little, And
is it not fit that seeing all Order, Decency, and Doctrine of Christianity is
(irreligiously) and Blasphemously thrust out of the Churches with you, that in
the Room thereof, the Railings and Revilings of this Weekly Rabshekah may be
brought in, which may in future ages make Mercurius Brittanicus, as famous for
his Madnewes and Accursed Nonsense Dreams, as Mahomet is for his Alcaron.

Then you say, that the Parliament were in the worst condition, if it could not
command all other Courts in punishing Delinquents, but if your Thing at
Westminster, were a Parliament, they would have punished you for Traitorous
Libells, against the sacred Majesty's of the King and Queen, the Royal
posterity, the Reverend Clergy, the faithful Nobility and Gentry, the true
hearted Commonalty, and finally, against the Peace of all His Majesty's
Kingdoms, these are such delinquencies, that they deserve less then to be
dreamed a Parliament, that gives them encouragement and Rewards, these are no
Acts, or Symptoms of a Parliament.

Lastly your words are, That you do not take Arms against the King, but
against those about Him, Cod is about Him, and I hope ever will be, and environ
him with his all saving protection, the blessed success he has had in being
still preserved from dangers, might make you believe that God is about him, if
you mean his trusty servants that are about him, that is no news, it is their
Honor to be hated for their Masters sake. And if he will needs involve
himself into their Ruin (then belike you mean utterly to ruin them and the
King together) you can but only pray and sigh for the misfortune of the King,
with a public Thansgiving, Doing still our duty to the King. We thank you for
your manners, I know none you have.

Thus Mounster Mercurius Brittanicus, I have traced, track'd and truly answered
all your madness for one week, which is as much as if I had confuted all that
you have done, can, or will do, but if you meddle with me again. I shall make
so bold, to bung up your Chaps with a Gravesend Toast.

FINIS.
