UPON THE LATE STORM, AND OF THE DEATH OF HIS HIGHNESS Ensuing the same,
By Mr. Waller.
WE must resign; Heaven His great Soul does claim
In storms as loud, as His Immortal Fame;
His dying groans, his last Breath shakes our Isle,
And Trees uncut fall for His Funeral Pile,
About his Palace their broad roots are tossed
Into the air; So Romulus was lost:
New Rome in such a Tempest mis't her King,
And from Obeying fell to Worshipping.
On Oeta's top thus Hercules lay dead
With ruined Oaks, and Pines about him spread;
Those his last fury from the Mountain rent,
Our dying Hero from the Continent
Ravished whole Towns; and Forts from Spaniards reft
As his last Legacy, to Britain left,
The Ocean which so long our hopes confined
Could give no limits to His vaster mind;
Our Bounds inlargment was his latest toil;
Nor has he left us Prisoners to our Isle;
Under the Tropic is our language spoke,
And part of Flanders has received our yoke.
From Civil Broils he did us disingage,
Found nobler objects for our Martial rage,
And with wise Conduct to his Country showed
Their ancient way of conquering abroad:
Ungrateful then, if we no Tears allow
To Him that gave us Peace, and Empire too*
Princes that feared him, grieve, concerned, to see
No pitch of glory from the Grave is free.
Nature her self took notice of His death,
And sighing swelled the Sea, with such a breath
That to remotest shores her Billows rould,
Th'approching Fate of their great Ruler told.
London Printed for H. H.
