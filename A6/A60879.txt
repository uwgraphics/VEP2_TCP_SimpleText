A Brief HISTORY OF THE SUCCESSION, Collected out of the RECORDS, and the most
Authentic HISTORIANS.
Written for the Satisfaction of the EARL of H.
MEn generally, at present, busy themselves in discoursing about the
Succession, and therefore cannot but be pleased to have a short History of it
set before them: For by seeing how the Crown has descended, and in what manner,
Caes. de Bell. Gall. lib. 5. Tacitus in vitae Jul. Agricolae Strab. lib. 4.
and upon what grounds the natural Course of the Descent has been changed,
they will be enabled to judge what has been the Opinion of all Ages, in this so
controverted a Point, and thereby may safely direct their Own.

Nothing certain has come dow to us of the Nature of the Government of this
Island before the Romans came hither; only this we learn from Caesar, and
Strabo, and Tacitus, That the Britans were subject to many Princes and States,
not confederate, nor consulting in common, but always suspecting, and
frequently warring with one another.

During the Heptarchy, whilst every Kingdom was governed by different Laws, we
cannot think they agreed in one Rule of Succession: But, if that does not, I am
sure, the reading the many Changes and Confusions of those Times must convince
any man, that their Rule was uncertain, or else that they had no Rule at all.

Those seven Kingdoms were at last united under Egbert: But yet our Historians
who lived nearest those Times, expressed themselves so odly in this Matter, and
do so constantly mention the Election of almost every King before they tell us
of his Coronation, that some learned men have doubted, whether before the
Conquest the Government of this Island was ever grown up into a settled
Hereditary Monarchy. Surely if it were so, yet all must agree, that Pol. Virg.

36.
then the Succession was not guided by the same Rules, as some men believe or
pretend it ought now to be. Egbert himself, the first English Monarch, came to
the Crown, not by Succession but Election, being no way related to Brissicu,
the last of the West Saxon Kings; and when he died, he gave the Kingdons of
Kent and Essex to his second Son. Hen. Hunt. l. 5 fol. 348. Will. Malmes. lib.
2. c. 3. f. 41.
Ethelwolf divided the whole Island between his two Sons Ethelbald and
Ethelbert. Will. Malmes. l. 2. c. 6. f. 48.

Edred, the younger Brother of King Edmond, was advanced to the Throne, though
the deceased Prince had two Sons, Edwin and Edgar, who did both of them reign
afterward successively. Edgar left a Son at his Death; but yet there happened a
mighty Contest about his Successor, De Rege Eligendo magna inter Regni Primores
oborta est dissentio Simeon Dunelm. an. 975. f. 160 Edwardum Elegerunt Electum
consecraverunt, and lin Rogem unxerunt Sim. Dunelm ubi supra.
some of the great (...) contending for the Election of Egelred his Brother.
But at last the Interest of Edward the Son prevailed, and he was in a full
Assembly elected, consecrated, and anointed King. That which Ailredus, Abbot of
Rievallis, in his Life of Edward the Confessor, gives an account of, seems very
remarkable to our purpose. King Ethelred Gloriosus Rex Ethelridus Ailred
Rievalis fo. 372.
(who was no tame and easy Prince) desirous to establish his Successor in his
Lifetime, Fit magnus coram Rege Episcoporum Conventus Reival. ubi supra.
summoned a great Council expressly for that purpose, and proposes the thing to
them. The Council were divided, some of them appearing for Edmond his eldest
Son, and some for Alfred his second Son by Queen Emma. But at last, upon some
superstitious Fancy, they agreed to pass by both of them, and elected the
Infant that was in the Queens Womb. To which Election the King gave his Praebet
Electioni Rex consensum Ailr. Ab. Reival. ubi supra.
Royal Assent, and the whole Assembly swore Fealty to the Child whilst yet
unborn. Undoubtedly this Story makes it plain, that it was not enough at that
time to entitle one to the Crown, that he was the Kings Eldest Son, for the
Ethelred would never have suffered a Debate about the Election of a Successor,
nor summoned a Parliament expressly for that purpose, which you see he though
necessary to be done. And notwithstanding all his care it seems upon the Death
of Ethelred, Canutus had so great an Interest, that by an unanimous consent in
a full Episcopi Abbates Duces Quique nobiliores Angliae in unum congregati pari
consensu Canutum in Dominium and Regem Eligere omnem progeniem Regis Ethelredi

Counsel he was elected King, and all the Issue of the last Prince rejected.
It Is true, the Londoners stood firm to Edmond Ironside, (the approbation of
that renowned City had then no little Influence on the Succession) and there
were diverse Battles fought between them; but at last they came to an Agreement,
and Edmond dying, the Dane ruled the whole Island peaceably whilst he lived.

Immediately upon the Death of Canutus, there was assembled at Oxford Placitum
magnum de Regni Successione apud Oxonium factum est Brompt. 932. Canuto mortuo
facta est apud Oxonium magna alteratio de Regni Successione Hen. Knyht. de
event Angl. Hen. Hunt l. 6. f. 364.
a great Council to determine who ought to succeed; where notwithstanding all
the Interest which Godwin Earl of Kent, and the West Saxon great men, could
make on the behalf of Hardiknute, the legitimate Son of the dead King, they
were over-voted, and Harald Harefoot (his Bastard, begotten on Ailena or
Elgiva) was elected. Harald died in the 5th. year of his Reign, and Post mortem
Heraldi Hardeknute Electus Rex, Hen. Hunt l. 6. f. 365.
then the People were content to accept of Hardiknute for their King, and to
that end sent for him out of Flanders; but he dying Issueless, it was ordained
in a Omnes Anglorum magnates ad invicem tractantes de communi Concilio and
Juramento statuerunt, quod nunquam temporibus futuris aliquis Dacus super cos
in Anglia regnaret. Brompt. 934.
General Council, that never any Dane should for the future be admitted to
Reign in England. After which they proceeded to elect Alfred, the Son of
Ethelred, and he being murdered by the Treachery of Earl Godwin, they chose his
Brother Edward, commonly called Edward the Confessor. Nor were these Elections
of theirs made with any respect to nearness of Blood, more than those whereof
we have heard before; for Edmond Ironside, their Elder Brother, had a Son then
alive, Brompt. 945.
whose Name was Edward, and who was Father to Edgar Atheling, living also at
the same time. And though this Edward had an undoubted Title to the Crown, if
proximity of Blood could have given it, yet the Confessor was so far from
suspecting any danger from such a Title, as that he invited his Nephew into
England, and welcomed him when he came with the greatest expressions of Joy,
and entertained him with the greatest Confidence. Nor had the People any regard
to this Royal Blood upon the Death of the Confessor, but elected Harald, the
Son of Earl Godwin, who had no pretense of Kindred to the Saxon Line.

These few, among many other Instances which may be given, will show plainly
enough, how men entitled themselves to the Crown in those days, and that then
it was no strange thing to hear of a Parliaments meddling with the Successon.
Therefore I suppose the men who seem astonished at the boldness of a
Parliament, in presuming to speak of it at this time, will say, that they ought
not to be troubled with Presidents before the Norman Conquest; and that though
the Saxons might be guilty of preferring a brave and deserving Bastard, before
a cruel or a silly legitimate Prince, and of many other Irregularities, yet no
such things are to be found in our Histories since the time of William the
first, whose Reign is the great Epoche, from whence we do compute our Kings.
Let us therefore go on more particularly to observe what has been done since
that time, and we hall see whether they who wonder so much, have any reason to
do so.

William the Conqueror was himself illegitimate, and yet succeeded his Father
in the Duchy of Normandy, and therefore had no reason to set any great value
upon that fort of Title, which is derived from a Right of Blood. And it seems
he did not much regard it; for passing by Robert his eldell, he gave the Crown
A patre ultima valetudine decumbente in Successorem adoptatus. Guil. Malmab.
lib. 4. fol. 120. Sim. Dunel. anno 1087. fol. 213. Brompt. f. 980.
by his last Will, to William Rufus his younger Son, disposing only with regard
to his own Inclinations, the Crown which himself had gained.

But his Son was too wise to rely upon this Disposition as a sufficient Title,
and therefore had recourse to a more suit one: Convocatis terrae magnatibus.

Mat. Paris in vit Gull 2. fol. 14. anno 1088.
For calling together the Nobles and wise Men of the Kingdom, he acquainted
them in a full Council, with his Fathers Will, and desired their Consent to it;
who after a long Consultation, did at last unanimously agree to make him their
King, and thereupon he was Crowned by Langfranck, Archbishop of Canterbury. I
cannot but observe one thing farther, that though some men make use of the
absolute Victory which the Conqueror had made, and affirm, that thereby the
English were wholly broken, and all the old Laws and Customs of the Realm were
destroyed, yet it is plain that at this time the English Interest was so great,
that it kept the Crown upon William Rufus's Head, in spite of all that the
Normans could do in behalf of Robert, though they universally joined with him.
Rex fecit convocare Anglos. Sim. Dunelm an. 1088. fol. 214.

promising them a complete Resticution of their ancient Laws, they stood firm
to him, and soon put an end to all the Attempts of his Brother, and his Norman
Accomplices.

Upon the Death of William Rufus, Robert had a fair pretense to renew his Claim
to the Crown, Hic Robertus semper contraraus and adeo innaturalis extiterat
Baronibus Regni Angliae, quod plenario consersie and consilio totius
Communitatis Regn^, ipsum refutaverunt and pro Rege omnino reousaverunt, and

but that Prince had discovered too much of the Cruelty of his Disposition, of
his aversion to the English Nation, and of his proneness to Revenge; so that by
the full Consent and Counsel of the whole Body of the Realm, assembled at
Winchester, he was finally rejected, and they did concur to elect the
Conqueror's third Son Henry for their King, (as Mar. Westminster expresses it)
Nor did they do this but upon Terms; for both the Clergy and Laity said, that
if he would restore them their ancient Liberties, and confirm them by his
Charter, and abrogate some severe Laws which his Father had made, they would
consent to make him King. And this prudent and learned King was not ashamed or
unwilling to own this Title; for he does at large recite it in his Charter
whereby he confirms their Liberties, Rich. Hagulstad 310. Brompt. 10.21. Mat.
Paris 240.
Sciatis me misericordia Dei, and communi consilio Baronum Regni Angliae,
ejusdem Regni Regem Coronatum esse, etc.

Henry the first you see had reason to believe and own the Power of the
Kingdom, in setting the Crown upon what head they pleased, and therefore he
desired to secure it that way to his Posterity. To that end, in the 13th. year
of his Reign, Coacio Concilio fecit omnes Principes and Potentes Anglicani
Regni adjurare terram and Regnum Willielmo filio suo, etc. Gervas Cron. 1138.
he summoned a Council, and procured all the great and powerful men of the
Kingdom to swear that his Son William should succeed him: But afterward this
Son of his was unfortunately drowned, and the King died, leaving no other Issue
but Maud his Daughter, who had been married to the Emperor, and afterward to
Geoffery Plantaginet, Earl of Anjou. No dispute can be made, but that she had
all the Right which proximity of Blood could give; yet Stephen, Earl of
Boloign, who was the Son of Adela, one of the Conquerors Daughters, and whose
elder Brother Theobald, Earl of Blois, was then living, stepped in before her,
and by representing to them the Inconvenience of a Feminine Government, and
promising them to consent to such good and gentle Laws as they should devise,
prevailed A primoribus Regni cum fuvere Cleri and populi Electus est a Will.

with the Estates of the Realm to elect him King. And in this Charter, which he
made soon after, he owns this Title, beginning it thus, Ego Stephanus Dei
gratia, assensu Cleri and Populi in Regem Angliae electus, etc. And the Pope,
in his Charter of Confirmation, sent to him in the first year of his Reign,
tells him, That he was Communi voto and unanimi assensu tam Procerum quam etiam
Populi in Regem electus. And then he adds, That since so universal an Assent
could not be directed but by the Divine Grace, he therefore allows his Title,
and confirms him in the Kingdom.

It Is true that afterward Mawd the Empress, together with her Son Henry,
having, after some years, gained many to their side, gave him great
disturbance; till at last Stephen having lost his Eldest Son Eustace (in whom
he placed his hopes Hen. Hunt. l. 8. f. 395. R. Hag. de gestii. Steph. 314.
and used all means, whilst he lived, to have got him declared his Successor,
but without Success) came to an Agreement with the Empress and her Son, and
Facto Wintoniae conventu publica, Rex Stephanus ipsum Ducem cunctis videntibus
adoptavit in Filium, utque, interposito omnium Juramento, concessit and
confirmarit ei totius Angliae principatum, Dux autem suscepit eum in loeum
genitoris, contendens ei omnibus diebus vitae fuae nomen and rem Regij culminis
obtinere, Gervas. f. 1375. In conventu Episcoporum and aliorum de Regno optum

Jo. Hagalstad 282. an. 1154.
the Parliament, (who alone could give a Sanction to such Agreement,) was
assembled at Winchester to confirm it; and then Stephen publicly Adopts Henry
for his Son, and with their full consent declares him his Heir; and with the
same consent Henry gives Stephen the name of Father, and agrees that he should
continue to be King, during his Life, and they all Swore, That if Henry
survived, he should without opposition obtain the Crown, and Stephen by his
Charter, which is set down at large in Brompton publishes this Agreement,
Brompt. 1037.

In all this Transaction certainly there was no consideration had of any other
Right, but that which universal consent conferred; For if Stephen's Heir had
any pretense, he had a Son then living, whose Name was William, and who by the
same Agreement was to have all the Possessions which his Father enjoyed before
he was made King. If the Heir of Henry the first had any Title, that was vested
in Mawd the Empress, who was then also living; so that neither of the parties
had any other color of Right to the Crown, than what the consent of the People
gave them.

According to this Parliamentary Agreement and Limitation, Stephen enjoyed the
Crown peaceably during his Life, and after his Death Henry the Second came to
it as peaceably; but he remembered by what Title, and therefore was desirous to
secure it to his Son in the same manner, that he took a very dangerous and
unusual way to do it. Convenerunt interim die statuto ex mandato Regis
Londoniam totius Angliae Episcopi Abbates Comites Barons vicecomites prepositi
Aldermanit cum sidejussoribus, Gervas H 2. f 1412.
For Summoning a Parliament to meet at London, he procures his Son Henry to be
declared King together with himself, by their consent, and thereupon he was
Crowned by the Archbishop of York, and Fealty Sworn to him by all. This was the
occasion of Civil Wars between them, for the Father meant hereby only to have
secured the Succession to him, and the Son was impatient of having only the
bare Title of a King, all along pretending to an Equal Authority, as does
sufficiently appear by what he writes to the Prior and Convent of Canterbury,
where he takes notice, That his Father did attempt some Invasions upon them,
which he ought not to have done without his assent. Gervas H. 2. f 1425.
Qui, ratione Regiae unctionis, Regnum, and totius Regni curam suscepiemus, and
therefore he appealed to the Pope in that behalf. Nay, the Father himself paid
that Respect to his Sons Dignity, That when he at last subdued him and his
Rebellious Brothers, Brompt. f. 1100.
he would not suffer him to do him Hommage with his other Sons, (though he
offered it.) But Henry the Son dying in the Life of his Father, Richard was
then his Eldest Son surviving, and consequently had all the Right which a next
Heir could claim. But the wise and wary King had not confidence enough to rely
upon this (now so much talked of) sacred Right; but though he had already
suffered so much from disobedient Sons, was glad to get the Succession
confirmed to him in his Lifetime. And, the Truth is, there was reason enough
that he should do so; for he had all his Children by Eleanor the Daughter of
William Duke of Guyen, M. Paris 84
who was before the Wife of Lewis the 7th King of France, who was still living,
and she only Divorced causa Adulterii, which being not a Divorce a vinculo
Matrimonii, she could not, either by the Canon Law universally received, or the
Laws of England, lawfully Marry with any other Husband.

After his Father's Death, Richard came to London, to which place all the
Clergy and Laity were summoned; and Post tamcleri quam populi solennem and
debitam Electionem R. de daeto f 647. R. H. par. 2. f. 6. 56.
after he had been solemnly and duly Elected by the whole Clergy and Laity,
(they are the very words of the Historian) and taken the usual Oaths, he was
Crowned. And when he undertook the holy War, he Flo. Hist. An. 1190.
declared Arthur Son of his next Brother Geoffery the Duke of Britain, the next
Heir to the Crown.

Richard dying without Issue, this Arthur ought to have succeeded, and his
Sister Elianor also had a Title before her Uncle: But John the younger Brother,
without regarding this divine Right of his Nephew, applies himself to the
People for a more sure, though but a humane Title, Praelatorum Comitum and
aliorum Nobilium multitudo insinita, Brompt. 1281.
who being summoned together, elected him King. And Mat. Paris, 197. An. 1199.

Hubert the then Archbishop of Canterbury, did at his Coronation, preach a
Doctrine, which would have sounded very strangely to the Convocation in 1640.
(viz.) No one could make any title to the Crown, nisi ab universitate Regni
unanimiter Electus. And that he who was most worthy ought to be preferred. But
(as he goes on) if any one of the Race of the deceased King, was more deserving
than others, as John the Brother of the deceased King was, the People ought
more readily to elect him, than a Stranger to the Royal Blood. This was all the
Title King John pretended, and this was then sufficient to put by his Nephew.
And in his Charta Moderationis feodi Magni figilli, an. 1 Jo. ex vet. Reg. in
Archivis Arch. Cant. he says he came to the Crown, Jure Hereditarin and
mediante tam Cleri quam Populi unanimi Consensu and Favore.

and favor of his Subjects.

But when King John gave over to dissemble his Nature, and went about to change
his Religion N^enon and Legem Christianum, Quam, vanam cersuit retinquens, Legi
Mahometis fideliter adhaereret, Mat. Par. 243.
(for he made offers of that sort to the King of Morocco) when he discovered
himself not to be that worthy man which the People supposed him to have been;
they remembered whence he derived his Title, and proceeded, upon the same reason
that they had chosen him, to make a new Election, Mat. Par. 279. Flo. Hist. an.
1216.
choosing Lewis Son of Philip King of France, who was next Heir to the Crown in
the right of Blanch his Wife, Niece to King John, and Daughter to his Sister
Elianor, both the Children of Geoffery Duke of Britain, being dead before that
time.

When King Philip heard of their choice, he consented to send his Son, being
the rather induced thereto by this reason, Velens fratrem suum Regem Ricardum a
Regno Angliae injuste privare and inde de proditiane accusatus and coram eo
convictus, Damnatus fuit per judicium in Curia ipsius Regis, Mat. Westminster. 275.
Mat. Par. 281.
That John's Blood being corrupted by an Attainder of Treason in the Lifetime
of his Brother Richard, he was incapable of taking the Crown by Descent, and
unworthy to take it any other way.

Lewis coming to London, was there Elected and Constituted King, swearing to
preserve the Peoples Laws, and they swearing Allgiance to him: But he soon
forgot his Coronation Oath, and attempted several ways to introduce an
Arbitrary Government, before he was well Established in his Throne, which the
English as soon resented: And King John happening to die very opportunely, The
Earl-Marshal, calling together the Great men of the Kingdom, and placing Henry
the third, then an Infant, in the midst of them, persuaded them to make him
King, who was altogether innocent of his Fathers faults: Mat. West. 275. Hen.
de Knight f. 2426 c. 15. l. 2.
The Earl of Gloucester said this was contrary to their Oath to Lewis: To which
the Marshal replied, that Lewis by breaking his Oath had absolved them from
theirs; and that he despised the English to set up the French; and that he
would be the destruction of the Realm. With whose Reasons the whole Assembly
being convinced, cried out unanimously, Fiat Rex; and accordingly they Crowned
King Henry the third, and soon after compelled Lewis to rerenounce all
pretenses to the Crown.

Henry the Third dying, Hen. de Knight f. 2472. c. 16. l. 2.
after a long and troublesome Reign, his Son Edward the First, a Prince of
great hopes, and whose Life answered the highest expectations, succeeded; but
whether he was the eldest Son of his Father, remains a doubt in History. The
House of Lancaster, who derived themselves from his Brother Edmond, pretending
always that Edmond was the Elder, and Edward the Younger Brother, and that
Edmond was put by the Crown, by common Consent, for his Deformity.

After the Death of Edward the First, Tho. Walsingh. in Vit. Ed. 2. f. 126.
his Son Edward the Second succeeded, but he degenerating from so great a
Father, the People grew weary of his Irregular and Arbitrary Government. And a
Parliament being by him summoned at Westminster, Pol. Virg. l. 18. f. 352.
as all our Writers say, or as Polydor Virgil words it, Principes Convocato
Concilio pervenerunt Londini (which I observe, only that we may know what
Polydor means, when he makes use of the expression of Principes in Concilio
Congregati;) They presently entered into a consideration of the miserable state
of the Nation; Froissart 1. vol c. 14. Fructus Temporum. Part 7. f. 107. Hen.
de Knight l. 3. c. 15. f. 2549.
and a Paper being publicly read, containing many Instances of the King's
Misgovernment, all which he had confessed, they concluded he was unworthy to
Reign any longer, and that he ought to be deposed; and sent to him to let him
know their Resolution, and to require him to renounce his Crown and Royal
Dignity, otherwise they would proceed as they thought good. And they appointed
Commissioners to go to him in their Names: The Bishop of Ely for the Bishops;
The Earl of Warren for the Earls; Sir Henry Piercy for the Barons; and Sir
William Frussel for the Commons, to resign their Homage up to him: which
Frussel pronounced in all their Names, and formally deprived him of all Royal
Power; the form of which is particularly set down by Knighton. The King read
this sad Sentence with extraordinary grief, and many complaints of those evil
Counselors who had seduced him; but in the midst of his Sorrow Quod Filium
suum Edwardum post se Regnaturum Eligissemt, Knight 2550.
he gave them thanks that they Elected his Son to reign after him. Thus was
that glorious Prince Edward the Third elected King in his Fathers Lifetime, Et
huic Electioni universus populus consensit. Walter Archbishop of Canterbury,
who preached the Coronation-Sermon, took this for his Text; Vox Populi vox Dei.
By this we may see that all his Predecessors were not of Archbishop Lawd's
mind, but thought there was a Divine Right somewhere else than where he placed
it. Upon the death of Edward the black Prince, there was some Dispute whether
John of Gaunt, the eldest surviving Son of Edward the Third, should Succeed
Jure propinquitatis, or Richard the Son of the Black Prince; whereupon Edward
the Third procured the Parliament to confirm the Succession to Richard the
Second. And afterward, when Edward the Third dyed, Pol. Virg. 20. f. 295.

In the 21 year of Richard's Reign, a Parliament being assembled at
Westminster, they drew up, by their common Consent, a Form whereby he did
resign the Crown, and the name and power of King, discharging all his Subjects
from all Oaths which they had taken of Allegiance to him, confessing himself
thereby insufficient for the Government; and swearing never to make any
pretenses to the same for the future. All which he Pronounced and Subscribed,
wishing, (if it were in his power,) to have Henry Duke of Lancaster for his
Successor; but since it was not, he desired the Commissioners to signify his
Desires to the States of the Realm. The next day all the States of the Realm
accepted his Resignation, and when that was done, they proceeded to read
publicly his Coronation Oath, and all the Breaches of it, that so it might
appear how justly he had deserved to be deposed. All which are contained in
Thirty three Articles, entered at large in the Rolls of Parliament, (and well
deserve to be read) whereupon the States adjudged that he shall be Deposed, and
appoint Commissioners ad Deponendum eundem Richardum Regem ab omne Dignitate,
Majestate and honor Regiis, vice nomine and authoritate omnium statuum
praedictorum, prout in Consimilibus casibus de antiqua consuetudine dicti Regni
fuit observatum: which the Bishop of St. Asaph did, in full Parliament, in
their names, and by their directions. The same Commissioners were also to
resign up to him their Homage and Fealty, and intimate the Sentence of
Deposition; which they did accordingly, by the Mouth of Sir William Thirning,
whose words are at large entered upon Record. Then did the Parliament proceed to
choose Henry the Fourth King; And upon this Title only did he rely, though he
mentioned some other trifling ones, as that he challenged it, being then void,
by Force, as Descended to him from King Henry the Third.

But this could give him no Title, for it is plain that whilst any of the Issue
of Lionel Duke of Clarence, the Third Son of Henry the Third, were in being, no
right of Blood could Descend to him, who derived his Pedigree only from John
of Gaunt, who was but his Fourth Son. And he plainly showed what a good Opinion
he had of a Parliamentary Title to the Crown, when in the 7th year of his
Reign, 7 H. 4. cap. 2.
he procured an Act of Parliament to pass, whereby the Inheritance of the Crown
and Realms of England and France were settled upon himself for Life, and the
Remainder entailed upon his four Sons by name, and the Issue of their Bodies
begotten. He was contented that it should be limited no farther, but that after
failure of his own Issue, it should go according to the general direction of
the Law. And he made a Charter soon after, whereby he settled the Crown pursuant
to this Act of Parliament: Bucks Hist. R. 3. l. 2. f. 50.
Post ipsum successive haeredibus suis de ipsius Corpore legitime procreandis;
which Charter was again confirmed in Parliament, the 22 December, 8 H. 4. and
the Original Charter is still to be seen in the Cotton Library.

Immediately upon the Death of Henry the Fourth, a Parliament met at
Westminster, and there, according to the custom of the Realm, it was debated
who should be King: But all Men had entertained so good thoughts of Prince
Henry, that without staying till the whole Assembly had declared him King,
diverse of them began to swear Allegiance to him. A thing strange, and without
President, as only occasioned by the extraordinary Opinion which was generally
conceived of him before.

And the certain Title vested in him by an Act of Parliament.

Princeps Henricus, facto Patris sui funere, Concilium Principum apud
Westmonasterium Convocandum Curat, in quo de Rege Creando, more Majorum,
agitabatur. Continuo aliquot Principe ultro in ejus Verba jurare coeperunt,
quod Benevolentiae Officium Nulli, priusquam Rex renunciatus esset, praestitum
constat. Adeo Henricus ab ineunto aetate spem omnibus optimae Indolis fecit,
Pol. Virg. l. 22. Hist. Angl. in Vit. H. 5.

Henry the Fifth dying, and leaving but one Son, who was an Infant of Eight
Months old, Titus Livius says there was some doubt whether he should be
accepted as King; Titus Live. Ms. in Bibl. Bod. Cott. Record. f. 666.
but as soon as his Fathers Funerals were Solemnized, the Estates of the Realm
of England, Assembling and Consulting together, they declared Henry the Sixth
to be their Sovereign.

In the Thirty fifth year of Henry the Sixth, a new Limitation of the Crown was
made by Parliament, for though the King had a Son then living, yet it was
Enacted, Hubington's Hist. E. 4. f. 10.
That during his own Life only, Henry the Sixth should hold and enjoy the
Crown, and that during his Life, Richard Duke of York should be reputed and
styled Heir Apparent to the Crown, and that it should be Treason to compass his
Death; Cott. Rec. 670. Fructus Temp. part 7. f. 162.
and after the Death, Resignation, etc. of Henry, the Crown was limited in
Remainder to Richard and his Heirs, with a Proviso, that if Henry, or any in
his behalf, should endeavor to disanul or frustrate this Act, that then
Richard should have the present possession of the Crown. And by force of this
Act of Parliament, the same Duke of York, taking advantage of Henry's Violation
of it, did lay claim to, Hubingt. E. 4. f. 73.
and attempt the recovery of the Kingdom, as also did his Son Edward after him
with better success; and Edward did openly insist upon this Title in the Speech
which he made at his Coronation.

It was also Declared by Edward's first Parliament, in the first year of his
Reign, that Henry the Sixth having broken the aforesaid Concord in many
particulars, the Crown was duly devolved to Edward the Fourth by virtue
thereof.

Afterward Edward the Fourth being driven out of the Kingdom, in the Tenth
year of his Reign, the Parliament did again entail the Crown on Henry the
Sixth, and the Heirs Male of his Body, with the Remainder to George Duke of
Clarence, Brother to Edward the Fourth, who was thereby also declared Heir to
Richard Duke of York.

It Is worthy observation, that both the Families of York and Lancaster claimed
a Title by Act of Parliament; and as long as that Title continued, the Issue of
Henry the Fourth had never any Disturbance from the Pretenses of the House of
York, who had undoubtedly the Right of Blood on their side: Buck's Hist. Rich.
3. lib. 1. fol. 20.
But as soon as Richard Duke of York had a Title vested in him, by the Statute
made in the Thirty ninth year of Henry the Sixth, then he thought it was worth
contending for; nor did he and his Son desist till they had driven out Henry
the Sixth.

Edward the Fourth did recover the Kingdom again as suddenly as he lost it, and
prevailed with his Parliament to repeal that Law which was made during his
Expulsion, and so left the Crown to that young unfortunate Prince Edward the
Fifth, who held it not long enough to have it put on him with the usual
Solemnity; for though he was Proclaimed, he was never Crowned King: For his
Uncle Richard Duke of Gloucester having secured him and his Brother in the
Tower, did cunningly insinuate the Bastardy of his Nephew, and that Edward the
Fourth had another Wife living at the time of his Marriage to their Mother, and
also at the time of their Birth.

The Report found Credit universally, in so much that the Duke of Buckingham
coming to him at Baynards-Castle, with most of the great Lords and wise men of
the Kingdom, and the Mayor and Aldermen of London, the Duke did in their Names
acquaint him, that they had unanimously thought fit to elect him King, as being
Heir to the Royal Blood of Richard Duke of York, upon whom the Crown was
entailed by the High Authority of Parliament.

It Is very remarkable, that in the midst of their highest Flatteries and
Courtship to him, they tell him only of this great and sure Title by Act of
Parliament; although if he had been indeed (what was pretended) the Heir of the
House of York, his Right by Descent from Edward the Third was unquestionable.

Richard (after some feigned Excuses) did at last accept of their Offer and
Election; and the Parliament being soon after Assembled, Cott. Rec. fol. 709.
they presented a Bill to this effect: Please it your Grace to understand the
Consideration, Election and Petition underwritten, of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and of the Commons, etc. And thereby they Declare the Children of
Edward the Fourth illegitimate, Bucks Rich. 3. lib. 1. fol. 22.
and that his Brother George Duke of Clarence was attainted of High Treason by
Parliament, in the 17th year of Edward the Fourth's Reign, by reason whereof
all the Issue of the said George were and are disabled and barred of all Right
and Claim, that in any case they might have or challenge by Inheritance to the
Crown and Dignity Royal of this Realm, by the ancient Laws and Customs of the
same. After which, considering that none of the uncorrupted lineal Blood of
Richard Duke of York could be found but in his Person, (say they) We have
chosen and do choose you our King and Sovereign Lord. Then the Bill proceeds,
in reciting that all the Learned in the Laws do approve his Title, and
declaring him King as well by Right of Consanguinity and Inheritance, as by
lawful Election, and entails the Crown on him and the Heirs of his Body, and
declares his Son Heir Apparent. To which the King gave his Royal Assent in
these words: (...) idem Dominus Rex, de Assensu dictorum trium Statuum Regni,
and Authoritate praedicta, omnia and singula praemissa, in Billa praedicta
contenta concedit, and ea pro vero and indubio pronunciat, decernit, and
declarat.

But the barbarous Murder of his Nephews did soon beget such an universal
Detestation of Richard in the minds of the People, that they resolved he should
no longer Reign over them; and so, taking hold of a Pretense which Henry Duke
of Richmond set up, they joined with him against Richard. Though Henry's Title
was indeed no more than a mere Pretense; for not only the Right of the House of
York, (as far as Blood could give Right) was before that of the House of
Lancaster, but also he had no manner of Interest in that Title which the
Lancastrian Line had, since his Claim was under a Bastard, begotten in
Adultery; and besides, his Mother, Margaret Countess of Richmond, as Heir to
whom he pretended he claimed, was then living. Therefore Comines, the most
judicious Writer of that Age, and who knew well what was the sense of Europe
concerning his Title, says plainly, (though he wrote in the time of Henry the
Seventh) Qu'il (...) Croix, ne Pile, ne null Droit, (comme Jeo Croy) (...).

Nevertheless, Henry having slain Richard in Bosworth-field, the Crown was
there put on his Head by the Lord Stanley, with the general Acclamation of the
People. But he was wise enough to think his Title to it was not very good, till
it was made so by an Act of Parliament, and therefore in the first year of his
Reign he procured one to pass in these words:

For the Wealth, Bucks Rich. 3. lib. 5. fol. 145.
Prosperity, and Surety of this Realm of England, and for avoiding of all
Ambiguities and Questions, (The wisest of our Princes you see had no little
Opinion of the Authority of a Parliament in this point,) Be it Ordained, etc.
That the Inheritance of the Crown of the Realms of England and France, with all
the Preheminences and Dignities Royal to the same appertaining, and the
Ligeances to the King belonging, beyond the Seas, etc. shall be, rest, remain
and abide in the most Royal Person of our Sovereign Lord Henry the Seventh, and
in the Heirs of his Body lawfully coming perpetually, with the Grace of God,
and so to endure, and no other.

Thus did the wisest of our Kings establish himself, Lord Bacon H. 7. f. 11, 12.
and the best of our Historians mentions it as one of the greatest Instances of
his Wisdom, That he did not press to have this as a Declaration or Recognition
of Ancient Right, but only as an Establishment of the possession which he then
had; nor to have the Remainder limited to any person after the determination of
his Estate, but was content with the Settlement upon himself, and the Issue of
his own Body, leaving it to the Law, to decide what was to follow upon the
failure of such Heirs.

Nor can any thing be more clear, than that Henry the Seventh depended entirely
on this Parliamentary Title, without extending any pretenses of his, or his
Wives, (who was Heir of the House of York,) beyond this Establishment, in as
much as the Oaths of Allegiance and other public Tests and Securities, which
were required at that time of the Subjects, were not in general Terms, to the
King, his Heirs, and Successors, but only to the King, Burnet's. Hist. of the
Reformation, Collect. ad lib. 2. fol. 3, 4.
and the Heirs Male of his Body lawfully begotten. An Instance of this,
(without going any further) may be seen amongst the Records Printed at the end
of the late History of the Reformation, where Cardinal Adrian, when he was
promoted by Henry the Seventh to the Bishopric of Bath and Wells, renounces
all Clauses in the Popes Bulls, which may be prejudicial Domini meo supremo,
and Haeredibus suis corpore suo legitime procreatis, Angliae Regibus; and he
does afterward swear Allegiance to him in the very same Words, without taking
any notice of Remoter Heirs.

Henry the Eighth, the Heir to this Entail, Succeeded his Father; and though he
attempted as much for Arbitrary Power, and used Parliaments with as little
respect as any of his Predecessors; Yet even he never doubted of their Power in
settling the Succession, but valued it much, and resorted to it frequently.

In the 25th year of his Reign an Act passed, St. 25 H. 8. cap. 22.
wherein the Parliament say, they were bounden to provide for the perfect
surety of the Succession; (they did not certainly reckon themselves bound to do
a thing that was not in their Power.) And then they take notice of the great
Mischiefs and Effusions of Blood which had happened by reason of the
doubtfulness of the true Title; and for the avoiding of all future Questions,
do Enact, That the Imperial Crown of this Realm shall be to King Henry 8th, and
the Heirs of his Body Lawfully begotten on Queen Anne, and the Heirs of the
Bodies of such several Sons respectively, according to the course of
Inheritance; and for default of such Issue, then to the Sons of his Body in
like manner; and upon failure of such Issue then to the Lady Elizabeth, and
after her to any other Issue, in Tail, and then the Remainder is limited to the
right Heirs of Henry the 8th. By the same Statute every Subject at his full Age
is obliged to take an Oath to defend the Contents of it, and the refusal is
made Misprision of Treason. And the next Parliament, 26 H. 8. c. 2.
which was held in the year following, does particularly Enact an Oath for that
purpose.

Some few years after these Acts were Repealed, 28 H. 8. Rast. Crown 4.
and the Parliament Entailed the Crown upon the King, and the Heirs of his Body
by Queen Jane; And Power is given the King for want of Issue of his Body to
dispose of the Succession by his Letters Patents, or his last Will.

It is also made Treason, if any Usurp upon those to whom it is so appointed.
Here the Parliament do not only use their power of changing the Succession, but
they Delegate it to another.

And in the thirty fifth Year of this King's Reign, 35 H. 3. cap. 1.
the Parliament by another Act take notice of the great and high Trust which
the Subjects had in him, in putting into his hands wholly the Order and
Declaration of the Succession; Yet the King being then ready to go into France,
they do Enact, that after his Death, and the Death of Prince Edward, without
Issue, the Crown should be to the Lady Mary, and the Heirs of her Body; but
both subject to such Conditions as the King should limit by his Letters
Patents, or by his last Will, signed with his Hand: And if the Lady Mary
performed not those Conditions, that then the Crown should go to the Lady
Elizabeth, as if the Lady Mary had been dead without Issue; and if the Lady
Elizabeth neglected to perform such Conditions, then it should go to such other
Person as the King should appoint, in the same manner as before, as if the Lady
Elizabeth had been dead without Issue. And Authority is given to him, by his
Letters Patents, or his last Will, signed with his own Hand, to appoint the
Crown to remain to such Person or Persons, and for such Estate, and under such
Conditions as he should please.

An Oath also for observing this Statute is appointed, and it is made Treason
to refuse it, or to disturb or interrupt any Person to whom it is limited by
this Act, or should be by the King, pursuant to the Power given him thereby.

This is abundantly sufficient to prove, That it was the universal Opinion of
that Age, That the Succession was wholly under the Control of Parliament, who
not only limited it as they pleased themselves, but subjected it to Conditions,
and to the Appointments of others. But the thing was in its own Nature so
evident, that they who had the greatest Reason, and were most concerned to do
it, did never presume to question the Power of a Parliament in this Point.

Lethington, Burn. Hist Reform. Collect. 268.
Secretary of Scotland, in a Letter of his, written to Sir William Cecill, then
Secretary of State here, wherein he argues in behalf of the Title of his
Mistress, Mary Queen of Scots, to succeed Queen Elizabeth, against a pretended
Disposition made by the last Will of Henry the Eighth, to his Niece, the Lady
Frances, Daughter to the French Queen, if his own Issue failed, says of these
Statutes that gave the King Power to dispose of the Crown, That they were
against Equity to disinherit a Race of Foreign Princes, and that they were
made in an abrupt Time, (as he terms it;) but yet he confesses, that since the
thing was done, it was now valid and unavoidable, unless some Circumstances did
annihilate the Limitation and Disposition made by King Henry's Will.

And so he proceeds to prove that the power which was given to the King by
these Statutes, was not pursued, (which it ought to have been most strictly,
and in a precise Form,) for that the King never signed the Will, but that his
name, set to it, was forged: Nay, I will venture to say that in all the Books
which were written to support the Claim of the Scottish Queen against King
Henry's Will, (though the whole power and wealth of the Guises were employed to
set every wit at work on that Design) there was never any stress laid upon it,
Treatise of the Title of Queen Mary to the Succession, page 38, 39. etc. lib.
2. Dodd. Engl. Lawyer. page 8.
or so much as a pretense that these Acts of Parliament were void or
ineffectual in themselves. In that Discourse which was published by Philips,
and composed by Sir Anthony Brown one of the Justices of the Common Pleas, who
was (in judge Dodderidges opinion) a person of an incomparable sharpness of
Wit, There was all the help that learning either in Divinity, Civil or Common
Laws could give; yet there the Authority of the Parliament in the case, and the
validity of these Statutes is all along admitted. Indeed they endeavor to put
some other construction upon the Statutes, but their great Argument is, That
King Henry, as King, had no power to dispose of the Crown, and therefore these
Laws only gave him an Authority, and made him only as it were a Commissioner,
and therefore, as all other Authorities, (especially being in Derogation of the
course of the Common Line,) was to be strictly followed. They allow that he had
sufficient power to Devise, and that he might Honorably have used that Power;
but that he ever did exercise that Authority, is the thing denied. But it is
time for us to go on.

Edward the Sixth succeeded his Father, and took upon him a power, which surely
no King ever had, to dispose of his Crown by the Will. But that disposition
serving to no other purpose but to the Ruin of the Lady Jane Gray, His Sister
Queen Mary first, and after Queen Elizabeth enjoyed the Crown according to the
Limitation of the Statute 35 H. 8. c. 1. and that one of them had no other
Title, must be agreed by all: For Queen Catherine was alive at the time when
Elizabeth was born: so that if the first Marriage was unlawful, Queen Mary, and
if the second was unlawful, Queen Elizabeth must necessarily have been
Illegitimate.

I cannot but observe one passage to our present purpose, which I meet with in
the time of Queen Mary. Sir Edward Montague first Lord Chief Justice of the
Common Pleas, Mores Reports 827. and 828.
and afterward of the Kings Bench (one who had the reputation of the ablest
and wisest Lawyer of his Age,) being accused to have drawn the Will of Edward
the Sixth, whereby that Queen was to have been disinherited, and being in great
danger upon that account; drew up a State of his own case, and therein sets
forth that the great reason which prevailed with him to obey the King in that
particular, and upon which he did still rely for his indemnity, was, that if
Queen Mary came to the Crown, Eullers Church History lib. 8. fol. 5.
she took it by force of the Act of Parliament which did limit it to her in
Remainder, so that she came in as a purchaser and not in privity of estate to
her Brother, and consequently could not punish Treasons or offenses committed
in his time.

I must needs also observe, that in the Articles made upon the Marriage of Q.
Mary with Ph. of Spain, which were confirmed by Act of Parliament, 1 Mar. Parl.
2. cap. 2.
the several Crowns and Territories of Philip are distributed part to Charles
the Infant of Spain, part to the Issue of the intended Marriage. Whereby it
does appear not only what opinion all Europe had of the power of an English
Parliament, but also that by the consent of the Estates of other Realms, Crowns
might be limited and disposed out of the ordinary course of Descent.

In the first year of Queen Elizabeth, The Parliament recognize her Title to
the Crown, 1 Eliz. c. 3.
with express Relation to the Statute 35 H. 8. which invests it in her and the
heirs of her Body, and do enact that the Limitation made by that Statute shall
stand and remain as Law for ever, and all Sentences, 1 Eliz. c. 5.
Judgments and Decrees to the contrary are declared to be void, and appointed
to be cancelled. And the several offenses which are made Treason by another
Statute in the same year, are all restrained to the Queen and the Heirs of her
Body only. The Parliament intending to extend that new security no further than
her Estate in the Crown (which she took by that Parliamentary limitation) did
extend.

In her Thirteenth year it was Enacted, 13 Eliz. c. 1. Rast. Treason. 27.
That if any person claim Title to the Crown for himself or any other, during
her Life, or shall not upon Demand acknowledge her Right, He shall be disabled
during his Life to have the Crown in Succession, as if he were naturally Dead.
And to affirm Right of Succession in such claimer or usurper, (after
Proclamation made of such claim or usurpation,) is made Treason. Nor does the
Statute stop there, but makes it Treason, during the life of the Queen, and
forfeiture of all Goods and Chattels after her decease, to affirm that the
Queen, with and by the Authority of Parliament, is not able to make Laws and
Statutes of sufficient force and validity to limit and bind the Crown of this
Realm, and the Descent, Limitation, Inheritance and Government thereof, or that
this or any other Statute made by Parliament, with the Queens assent, is not or
ought not to be for ever of sufficient force to bind and Govern all persons,
their Rights and Titles that may claim any Interest or Possibility in or to the
Crown in Possession, Remainder, Inheritance, Succession or otherwise. It were
well if some rash men, who presume in their discourses to restrain the power of
the Parliament, (that is, the King, Lords and Commons,) in the great business
of the Succession, would be so wise as to remember this Act, (which is still in
force) and the penalty to which they subject themselves by such sawey Talk.
That incomparable Statesman the Lord Burleigh had another kind of opinion of
the Security which an Act of Parliament could give his Royal Mistress, Complete
Ambassad. fol. 219.
by making the Scottish Queen (the Popish Successor of that time) unable and
unworthy of the Succession; as appears in a Letter which he wrote about this
time to Sir Francis Walsingham, then Ambassador in France.

In the Twenty Seventh year of Queen Elizabeth, 27 Eliz. cap. 1.
it was enacted that if any Invasion was made, or Rebellion or other thing
tending to the hurt of Her person by or for, or with the privity of any one who
should or might pretend Title to the Crown, and the same should be adjudged in
such manner as that Law appoints, then every person against whom such Judgment
should be given, should be excluded and disabled for ever to have or claim the
Crown; And that the Subjects of this Realm lawfully might by all forcible and
possible means, pursue all such offenders: And their Issues assenting or privy
thereto, are in like manner disabled and to be pursued. And this Act was made
in pursuance of an Association entered into by the People in the vacancy of
Parliament out of their great zeal for the preservation of the life of that
excellent Princess.

By virtue of his Statute Mary Queen of Scotland was afterward executed,
Strangways Hist. of Mary Queen of Scotland, fol. 179.
as appears by the Commission for her Trial.

King James her Son who was a wiser Prince, and not wholly governed by Priests
as his Mother was, though he had the same pretenses that she had, yet never
disputed his Right, or set on foot any Title during the life of the ever
Renowned Queen; though she would never suffer him to be declared her successor.
He was too wise to incur the like disability as his Mother had done, and to
contest a Title Established by Parliament.

After Queen Elizabeth's Death, The Act of Recognition made upon King James his
coming to the Crown, does particularly insist upon that Title, which was raised
by Act of Parliament to Henry the Seventh, and the Heirs of his body, and that
immediately upon the Queens decease the Crown descended and came to King James;
so that you see the Title of Queen Elizabeth is again acknowledged by
Parliament; And the entail made by the Statute of 35 H. 8. being spent upon her
death without Issue, King James comes in as next Heir to the old entail made
the first year of Henry the Seventh.

Thus have I set down before you the whole course of the English Succession as
plainly, as truly, and as briefly as is possible. I shall leave every man to
make his own observations on this Historical Deduction: But this one
observation I believe all men must make from it, That it has been the constant
opinion of all ages that the Parliament of England had an unquestionable power
to Limit, Restrain and Qualify the Succession as they pleased, and that in all
Ages they have put their power in practice; and that the Historian had reason
for saying that seldom or never the third Heir in a right Descent enjoyed the
Crown of England. Daniel, fol. 5. in vita H. 1.


It were as easy to show that in all other Kingdoms the next of Blood has
been frequently excluded from the Succession, but the History of our own
Country is our business; yet I cannot forbear reciting the Speech which
Ambassadors sent from the States of France, made to Charles of Lorrain, when
they had solemnly rejected him (though he was Brother to Louys d' Outremes and
next Heir to the Crown) and had elected Hugh Capet for their King. They told
him that every one knew that the Succession of the Crown of France belonged to
him, and not Hugh Capet. Gerr. du Hail. lib. 6. an. 988.
But yet (say they) the very same Laws which give you this Right of Succession,
do judge you also unworthy of the same; for that you have not hitherto
endeavored to frame your manners according to the Prescript of those Laws, nor
according to the usages and customs of your Country, but rather have allied
your self with the German Nation our old Enemies, and have loved their vile and
base manners. Wherefore seeing you have forsaken the ancient virtue and
sweetness of your Country, we have also forsaken and abandoned you; and have
chosen Hugh Capet for our King, and put you back, and this without any scruple
of Conscience at all, esteeming it better and more just to live under him,
enjoying our Ancient Laws, Customs, Privileges and Liberties, than under you
the Heir by Blood in oppression, strange Customs and Cruelty. For as those who
are to make a Voyage at Sea do not much consider whether the Pilot be owner of
the Ship, but whether he be skilful and wary; so our care is to have a Prince
to Govern us gently and happily, (which is the end for which Princes were
appointed) and for these ends we judge this man fitter to be our King.

Certainly it were a most dangerous thing to have an opinion prevail, that the
King in concurrence with his Parliament should not have power to change the
direct order of Succession, though the preservation both of him and his people
did depend upon it. For it does directly tend to Anarchy, and makes the
Government to want power to defend it self, by making such Alterations as the
variety of Accidents in several ages may make absolutely necessary. There must
be a supreme uncontrollable power lodged somewhere. And the men who talk at
this rate, can hardly find where it is lodged in England, if not in the King,
Lords and Commons in Parliament.

But when a man begins to ask a Reason of this Doctrine of theirs, that
proximity of Blood does give a Title unchangeable by any Humane Laws; The
teachers of it differ exceedingly; some of them tell us of a Divine Patriarchal
Right, which Kings as Natural Fathers of their People have derived down to them
from Adam. And this Notion though it be no older than the present Age, has been
very frequent in men's Mouths and Books, and has much pleased of late (as new
things use to do). But they consider not that if this be true, there never can
be but one Rightful Monarch in the Universe, That is He only who is the direct
and Lineal Heir of Adam then living. And thus these great Patrons of Absolute
Power, instead of supporting, do shake the Thrones of all the Princes in the
world, since none of them at this day can make out any such Title.

There are others who being desirous to bestow upon the Crown a Complement of
the like nature, which they were at the same time obtaining from it, have
declared in general, That Monarchy is of Divine Right, That Princes succeed by
the Laws of God, That their Title is not subject to any earthly cognizance, nor
owing to any consent of the People. But the consequences of this opinion are
not once considered by these men, that thereby the property of all Subjects,
and the Laws of all Countries, are destroyed together. For no Humane Laws or
Contracts can bind or restrain a Power divinely Instituted. Card. Pullav. Hist.
conc. Trid. l. 18. cap. 15.
(Or if you like it better in the words of a great Cardinal) A Jurisdiction
which is of Divine Right, is not alterable by the will or power of man.

Besides all communities which live under another Form of Government, must be
guilty of violating this Divine Institution. And perhaps there are few others
besides the Great Turks Dominions, which are governed as they ought to be.

In what a damnable condition are the Venetians and the Netherlands, who admit
no Monarch at all? Poland and the Empire, who Elect their Princes, and will not
hear talk of this Divine Right of Succession?

Aragon, where they do not only elect their King, but tell him plainly at his
Coronation, that they will Depose him if he observes not the conditions which
they require from him, and have a settled Officer called El' Justitia for that
purpose? Nay, even France it self, which it is notoriously known, does exclude
Women from this Divine Right?

That Government is of Nature, and derived from God, is manifest. Nothing is
more natural in Man than the Desire of Society, and without Government Society
would be intolerable. But can it be proved from hence that the Government
cannot be molded into several Forms agreeable to the Interest and Dispositions
of several Nations, and may not be varied from time to time as occasion
requires, by the mutual consent of the Governors, and of those who are
Governed?

And after all pretenses of this kind, let any place of Scripture be produced
wherein God obliges a people to this or that Form, till they have first obliged
themselves to it by some Act of their own?

I do agree that if God by any extraordinary Revelation has ordained any sort
of Government, or by any immediate Denomination has conferred a Kingdom on any
Family, and has directed in what order the Crown shall descend, that all men
are bound to submit to it and acquiesce in the Divine Will, as soon as it is
clearly and evidently made out to them, but they must not be angry if men
expect such an Evidence.

There is a third sort of men, who tell us this Realm being entirely subdued by
the Conqueror, and by him left to descend to his Heirs, none of these Heirs
who derive a Title under him, can deprive those who are to succeed of any Right
which they ought to have, but must leave the Crown as free to them as they
themselves received it from their Ancestors.

I will not here insist upon the danger that any Prince runs into who founds
his Title in force, because it will be hard to prove that such a one does not
leave as good a Title open for every man who can make himself strong enough.
Nor need I trouble my self to show, that all Conquest does not put the
Conqueror into an Absolute Right. Though it be most evident in the case of
William the First, who did by his Sword prosecute a claim of another nature,
and meant only to acquire that Right, and after conquest rested in it. He
pretended to the Crown as the Gift of King Edward, and to vindicate that Title
he entered with Arms. And though his Relation to the Crown was more remote than
that of Edgar Atheling, (then a child) yet his Title was better than Harolds
the present Usurper, who could pretend no kindred at all, and who had himself
Sworn to support the Grant to William. Nor did he claim a Power by conquest,
(though the name of Conqueror was given him by after times, says Daniel) but
submitted to the orders of the Kingdom, desirous rather to have his
Testamentary Title, than his Sword to make good his succession. But I will
admit that he made an absolute conquest, and then these men will grant that he
might himself dispose of this conquered Kingdom. Therefore if he did not leave
it to descend in such a manner as they would have it go, nor did institute any
such sort of Succession, surely this Argument of theirs will fall to the
ground. Now it is plain that he never designed that the Crown should descend,
but gave it to his second Son, and thereby gave an early example of excluding
and pretermitting the unworthy.

Lastly, Others object that the Fundamental Laws of the Land against which no
Act of Parliament can be of force, have so established the Succession that the
course of it cannot be altered. This is surely a new discovery unknown to our
Forefathers, as the foregoing History does abundantly prove. But let these
objectors be asked by what Authority these imaginary Laws were made? For if an
Authority equal to that which made them be still in being, That Authority may
certainly repeal them when ever it pleases to exert it self. If the King alone
made them, no doubt but that he may change them too. If they will say they were
made by the diffusive body of the people, they run before they are aware into
the guilt of worshipping that Idol The Multitude, and make a great step toward
placing the foundation of the Government upon contract and consent. But then
let them produce those Laws or some Authentic memorial of them, before it be
exacted from us to believe there were ever any such.

Yes, they will say, there is such an ancient Law acknowledged by all the
Judges, and known to every man, that the Descent of the Crown purges all
Defects whatsoever. This Maxim as it is usually repeated is in these words, and
this might be admitted, and yet could not be pertinently applied to a case
where the Descent it self is prevented by a Law. But I will not take advantage
of their words, but will consider the Objection, as it stands in that Book
where the first mention of it was made, 1 H. 7. f. (...) b. Que le Roy fuist
person able and discharge d'auscun attainder eo facto qu' il prist sur lui le
Reign and estre Roy.
and that is in the Year Book of Henry the Seventh, it being said there by the
Judges, That the King was a person Able and Discharged of any Attainder eo
facto, that he took upon him the Government, and to be King.

First, This was not only an extra-judical opinion, but was not pertinent to
the Question referred to their consideration, Whether those who were chosen
into the House of Commons, and were at that time attainted of Treason might sit
in Parliament, till their Attainders were Reversed; and they all agree that
their Attainders should first be annulled. But then they proceed to say that
there was no necessity that the Kings Attainder should be Reversed, for that he
might enable himself, and needed not any Act of Reversal. But surely they said
very wisely in what they said, for he who had won a Crown in the field, had
gone a great way toward enabling himself to wear it. Most sure it is that if
an Act of Reversal were necessary before he could sit, that then it was
impossible he ever should sit there, because no such Act could be made without
the Royal Assent. Henry the Seventh was then King de facto, and in possession
of the Throne, and it was somewhat of the latest to consider whether he was
qualified or not. Certainly it had been strange self-denial in the Judges, and
a neglect of themselves, (which is not usual with them) to have alleged an
Incurable Disability in the King, from whom they had their Patents and
Authority.

In the next place let us consider what precedent the Judges cite to justify
this opinion of theirs, and how apposite it is. Henry the Sixth being driven
out of the Kingdom by Edward the Fourth, The Conqueror called a Parliament,
and got an Act to pass, whereby Henry was disabled to hold the Crown. About ten
years after, Henry regains the Kingdom, and upon this re-accession to the Crown
(as it is usually called) This Act is never repealed. But does not every Child
see the Reasons of it? For if Henry was Lawful King, (and before he was not to
doubt that) The Act it self was void in as much as it wanted the Royal Assent.
So that for him to have procured an Act of Repeal had been to affirm a Title to
the Crown in Edward. But without doubt this opinion of the Judges as it is
applied by the Objectors, was new and unheard of before. We see the King of
France was otherwise informed by the learned men in the time of King John, for
they thought his Blood corrupted, Mat. Westni. 275. v. supra.
and him incapable of taking the Crown by Descent, because he was Attainted of
Treason, which prevailed with that King to send over his Son Lewis, to put in
his claim in right of his wife, who was the next Heir. It also ought to be
observed that the true Reason why the generality of the Nation did so long
approve the Title of the House of Lancaster, was because all the Princes of the
House of York were Attainted of Treason, and their Blood corrupted. But as soon
as ever this corruption was purged, and Richard Duke of York was declared Heir
Apparent by Parliament, the people soon forsook the Lancastrians, and set the
House of York in the Throne.

Nay, the very learned men of the same Age with these Judges, though quite
otherwise, as will appear beyond contradiction in this samous case which
follows. Richard the Third had two Elder Brothers, Edward and George Duke of
Clarence. Richard designing to secure the Crown to himself, had procured the
Children of Edward to be declared Illegitimate, yet still the Duke of Clarence
had Issue living which might pretend. But observe what the Parliament say (as
to this) in the first year of Richard the Third: V. Sup. and Cott. Rec. 709.
That in the seventeenth year of Edward the Fourth, George Duke of Clarence was
Attainted of Treason, by reason whereof all the Issue of the said George was,
and is Disabled and Barred of all Right and Claim, that in any case he or his
Issue might have or challenge by Inheritance to the Crown and Dignity Royal of
these Realms. After that we consider that you be the undoubted Heir, etc. And
so they proceed affirming that all Learned men in the Laws do approve his
Title. You see within less than three years before this opinion of the Judges,
The whole Parliament do not only give their opinion, but assure you that all
Learned men of that time held clearly that an Attainder did hinder the descent
of the Crown, and incapacitate the person to take it. Nay, what goes yet
further in this matter, Richard himself, though he was as jealous to secure his
Title as ever Tyrant was, and had as good advice to discern the most distant
danger: though he was always restless in endeavoring to get the Earl of
Richmond into his Hands, who was a very remote pretender, and only descended
from a Bastard of the House of Lancaster, yet he feared nothing on this side.
He knew how he had wronged the Children of his Brother Edward, and could not be
at ease till he had sent them out of the World, but he let the Children of his
Brother Clarence live, without apprehending any danger from them because their
blood was corrupted, and all possibility of Descent taken from them by the
Attainder of their Father. It was this only preserved them alive, and not any
remorse of Conscience or any niceness in sending another Nephew out of the
World after those whom he had dispatched before. This notable case attended with
these circumstances, will convince every man either that the Judges intended no
such thing by their opinion as some men fancy, or else at least that
extra-judicial opinions were then as Apocryphal as they have been since.

Consider Lastly, the unreasonableness of this Doctrine which tends directly to
subvert Government, and to put the life of the King Regnant into the hands of
his Successor. The next Heir may commit Rapes and Murders and Treasons, Burn
Cities or Betray Fleets, may conspire against the life of his Prince, and yet
after all, if by Flight or Force he can save himself, till some of his
accomplices can get the King dispatched, in spite of all Laws and Justice he
must come to the Crown, and be Innocent.

But when I reflect what sort of men I am arguing with, and how willingly they
use to submit to Authority, I think I shall convince them best by citing the
opinions of two great men, the one a Cardinal, the other a Lord Chancellor,
both of them Martyrs for the Papal Supremacy, I mean Fisher and Sir Thomas
Moor. And if their Judgments approve the power of Parliaments in the business
of the Succession, it cannot but weigh very much on such occasions as this.
It Is well known how resolution even to death they refused the Oath of
Succession which the Parliament had framed, Burn. Hist. Ref. lib. 2. fol. 156.
because therein the Kings Supremacy was avowed, and therefore they cannot be
suspected to dissemble, when at the very same time they declared, that if that
of Supremacy was left out, they would willingly Swear an Oath to maintain the
Succession of the Crown to the Issue of the Kings present Marriage, as it was
then established by Parliament, and gave this reason for it, that this was in
the power of a Parliament to determine; but not who was supreme head of the
Church. Sir Thomas Moor went further, and owned a very strange opinion of their
power in this point. But he says expressly at the same time, that the Parliament
had unquestionable Authority in the ordering of the Succession, and that the
people were bound to obey them therein.

After the Testimonies of these two great Papists, it will be little to add the
Testimony of a Protestant. But yet I will mention what Sir Walter Rawleigh (who
was no inconsiderable man, though a Protestant) says in his Incomparable
Preface to the History of the World: Without doubt (says he) Humane Reason
would have judged no otherwise but that Henry the Fourth had rendered the
Succession as unquestionable by the Act of Parliament which he had procured to
entail it on his Issues, as by his own Act he had left his enemies powerless.

But sinking men catch hold of every thing, and when they cannot object to the
validity, they will tell us, That such an Act of Parliament to disinherit the
next Heir is unjust and without a sufficient ground.

I will not at present enter into the dispute how far the difference of
Religion, which will also necessarily draw on a change in the Government, does
justify men in seeking to present the two dearest things on earth in an
orderly and lawful way. I will not (though I safely might) challenge these men
to tell me, where ever any settled Nation which had Laws of their own, and were
not under the immediate force of Conqueror, did ever admit of a King of
another Religion than their own. I will not insist on it that the Crown is not
a Bare Inheritance, but an Inheritance accompanying an Office of Trust, and
that if a man's defects render him incapable of the Trust, he has also forfeited
the Inheritance. I need not say how far a Nation is to be excused for executing
Justice summarily, and without the tedious formalities of Law, when the
necessity of things requires haste, and the party flies from Justice, and his
confederates are numerous and daring, and the Princes life in danger.

But this I will say, that if the Parliament have power in this thing, which I
need not prove, by showing that the ordinary course of Law allows Heirs to be
disinherited of Fines and Recoveries, and that the Parliament in all ages has
frequently done it by making Acts to alter the strongest Settlements, where
Equity has Dictated it, though the Heirs were never in any wise criminal. There
according to Sir Thomas Moors opinion the people are bound in conscience to
obey their Laws, and must not pretend to enquire whether they were made upon
just grounds. For by the some Rerson they may pretend that all other Laws were
made without just cause, and refuse obedience to any of them. And surely those
that should do so, would be an Excellent Loyal Party. God defend this Nation
from such Loyalty, as opposes it self to the King and the Laws, and God defend
the King from the pretended Duty and Submission of those men, who whilst they
talk of his power so much Renounce it openly, and oppose what would be the
greatest security of his person, and in effect set up his Successor above him,
even in his life time.

FINIS.
