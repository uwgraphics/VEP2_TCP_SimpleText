POEMS, BY THOMAS STANLEY ESQUIRE.

Quae n^ea culpa tamen, nisi si lusisse vocari
Culpa potest: nisi culpa potest and amasse, vocari?
Printed in the Year, 1651.

The Dedication
To LOVE.
THou, whose sole Name all Passions does comprize,
Youngest and Eldest of the Deities,
Born without Parents, whose unbounded Reign
Moves the firm Eearth, fixes the floating Main,
Inverts the Course of Heaven; and from the Deep
Awakes those Souls that in dark Lethe sleep,
By thy mysterious Chains seeking t'unite
Once more, the long-since torn Hermaphrodite.
He who thy willing Prisoner long was vowed
And uncompell'd beneath thy Scepter bowed,
Returns at last in thy soft Fetters bound,
With Victory, though not with Freedom crowned:
And, of his Dangers past a grateful Sign,
Suspends this Tablet at thy numerous Shrine.
POEMS.
The Gloworme.
STav fairest Chariessa, stay and mark
This animated Gem, whose fainter spark
Of fading light, its birth had from the dark.
A Star thought by the erring Passenger,
Which falling from its native Orb dropped here,
And makes the Earth (its Center,) now its Sphere.
Should many of these sparks together be,
He that the unknown light far off should see
Would think it a terrestrial Galaxie.
Take It up fair Saint; see how it mocks thy fright,
The paler flame does not yield heat, though light,
which thus deceives thy Reason, through thy sight.
But see how quickly it (taken up) does fade,
To shine in darkness only being made,
By th'brightness of thy light turned to a shade;
And burnt to ashes by thy flaming eyes
On the chaste Altar of thy hand it dies,
As to thy greater light a sacrifice.
The Breath.
FAvonius the milder breath of the Spring,
When proudly bearing on his softer wing
Rich odours, which from the Panchean groves
He steals, as by the Phoenix pyre he moves,
Profusely does his sweeter theft dispense
To the next Roses blushing innocence,
But from the grateful Flower, a richer scent
He back receives then he unto it lent.
Then laden with his odours richest store,
He to thy Breath hasts! to which these are poor;
Which whilst the amorous wind to steal essaies,
He like a wanton Lover 'bout thee plays,
And sometimes cooling thy soft cheek does lie,
And sometimes burning at thy flaming eye:
Drawn in at last by that breath we implore,
He now returns far sweeter then before,
And rich by being robbed, in Thee he finds
The burning sweets of Pyres, the cool of Winds.
Desiring her to burn his Verses.
THese Papers Chariessa, let thy breath
Condemn, thy hand unto the flames bequeath;
It Is fit who gave them life, should give them death.
And whilst in curled flames to Heaven they rise,
Each trembling sheet shall as it upwards flies,
Present it self to thee a sacrifice.
Then when about its native orb it came,
And reached the lesser lights of the sky, this flame
Contracted to a Star should wear thy name.
Or falling down on earth from its bright sphere,
Shall in a Diamonds shape its luster bear,
And trouble (as it did before) thine ear.
But thou will cruel even in mercy be,
Unequal in thy justice, who do free
Things without sense from flames, and yet not Me.
The Night. A Dialogue.
CHARIESSA. What if Night
Should betray us, and reveal
To the light
All the pleasures that we steal?

Philocharis. Fairest, we
Safely may this fear despise;
How can She
See our actions who wants eyes?

Chariessa. Each dimne star
And the clearer lights we know
Nights eyes are;
They were blind that thought her so:

Philocharis. Those pale fires
Only burn to yield a light
To Our desires,
And though blind, to give us sight.

Chariessa. By this shade
That surrounds us might our flame
Be betrayed,
And the day disclose its name.

Philocharis. Dearest Fair,
These dark witnesses we find
Silent are,
Night is dumb as well as blind.

Chorus. Then whilst these black shades conceal us,
We will scorn
Th'envious Morn,
And the Sun that would reveal us.
Our flames, shall thus their mutual light betray,
And night, with these joys crowned outshine the day.

Excuse for wishing Her less Fair.
WHy thy passion should it move
That I wished thy Beauty less?
Fools desire what is above
Power of nature to express;
And to wish it had been more,
Had been to outwish her store.
If the flames within thine eye
Did not too great heat inspire,
Men might languish yet not die,
At thy less ungentle fire,
And might on thy weaker light
Gaze, and yet not lose their sight.
Nor would thou less fair appear,
For detraction adds to thee;
If some parts less beauteous were
Others would much fairer be:
Nor can any part we know
Best be styled, when all are so.
Thus this great excess of light,
Which now dazles our weak eyes,
Would, eclipsed, appear more bright:
And the only way to rise,
Or to be more fair, for thee
Celia, is less fair to be.
Changed, yet Constant.
WRong me no more
In thy complaint,
Blamed for Inconstancy;
I vowed to adore
The fairest Saint,
Nor changed whilst thou were she:
But if another Thee outshine,
Th'Inconstancy is only Thine.
To be by such
Blind Fools admired
Gives thee but small esteem,
By whom as much
Thou Would be desired
Did thou less beauteous seem;
Sure why they love they know not well,
Who why they should not cannot tell.
Women are by
Themselves betrayed,
And to their short joys cruel,
Who foolishly
Themselves persuade
Flames can outlast their fuel;
None (though Platonic their pretense)
With Reason love unless by Sense.
And He, by whose
Command to Thee
I did my heart resign,
Now bids me choose
A Deity
Diviner far then thine;
No power can Love from Beauty sever;
I Am still Loves subject, thine was never.
The fairest She
Whom none surpass
To love has only right,
And such to me
Thy Beauty was
Till one I found more bright;
But'twere as impious to adore
Thee now, as not to have don't before.
Nor is it just
By rules of Love
Thou should deny to quit
A heart that must
Another prove
Even in thy right to it;
Must not thy Subjects Captives be
To her who triumphs over Thee?
Cease then in vain
To blot my name
With forged Apostasy,
Thine is that stain
Who dare to claim
What others ask of Thee?
Of Lovers they are only true
Who pay their Hearts where they are due.
The Self-Deceaver.
MONTALVAN.
DEccav'd and undeceav'd to be
At once I seek with equal care,
Wretched in the discovery,
Happy if cozened still I were:
Yet certain ill of ill has less
Then the mistrust of happiness.
But if when I have reached my Ainn.
(That which I seek less worthy prove.)
Yet still my Love remains the same,
The subject not deserving Love;
I can no longer be excused
Now more in fault as less abused.
Then let me flatter my Desires,
And doubt what I might know too sure,
He that to cheat himself conspires,
From falsehood does his Faith secure
In Love uncertain to believe
I am deceived, does undeceive.
For if my Life on Doubt depend,
And in distrust inconstant steer,
If I essay the strife to end
(When Ignorance were Wisdom here;)
All thy attempts how can I blame
To work my (...) seek the same.
The Cure.
Nymph. What busy Cares too timely born
(Young Swain!) disturb thy sleep?
Thy early sighs awake the Morn.
Thy tears teach her to weep.

Shepherd. Sorrows fair Nymph are full alone
Nor counsel can endure.

Nymph. Yet thine disclose, for until known
Sickness admits no Cure.

Shepherd. My Griefs are such as but to hear
Would poison all thy Joys,
The Pity which thou seem to bear
My Health, thine own destroys.

Nymph. How can diseased Minds infect?
Say what thy Grief does move!

Shepherd. Call up thy virtue to protect
Thy Heart, and know 'twas Love.

Nymph. Fond Swain!

Shepherd. By which I have been long
Destined to meet with Hate.

Nymph. Fie Shepherd fie: thou do Love wrong,
To call thy Crime thy Fate.

Shepherd. Alas what Cunning could decline,
What Force can Love repel?

Nymph. Yet, there is a Way to unconfine
Thy Heart.

Shepherd. For pity tell.

Nymph. Choose one whose Love may be allured
By thine: who ever knew
Inveterate Diseases cured
But by receiving now?

Shepherd. All will like her my Soul perplex.

Nymph. Yet try.

Shepherd. Oh could there be,
But any softness in that Sex,
I Would wish it were in Thee.

Nymph. Thy Prayer is heard: learn now t'esteem
The kindness She has shown
Who thy lost freedom to redeem
Has forseited her own.

CELIA Singing.
ROses in breathing forth their scent,
Or Stars their borrowed ornament;
Nymphs in the Watery Sphere that move,
Or Angels in their orbs above;
The winged Chariot of the Light;
Or the slow silent wheels of Night;
The shade, which from the swifter Sun,
Does in a circular motion run;
Or souls that their eternal Rest do keep,
Make far less noise then Caelia's Breath in sleep.
But if the Angel which inspires
This subtle Flame with active fires
Should mould this Breath to words, and those
Into a Harmony dispose;
The Music of this heavenly sphere,
Would steal each soul out at the Ear,
And into Plants and Stones infuse
A life that Cherubins would choose;
And with new Powers invert the Laws of Fate,
Kill those that live, and dead things animate.
A la mesme.
BElle voix, don't mes charms desrobent mon ame,
Et aulieu d'un esprit m'animent d'une flamme,
Don't Iesens la subtle, and la douce chaleur,
Enter par non oreille and glisser dans mon coeur;
Me faisant esprever par cette aimable vie,
Nos ames ne consistent que d'une harmony;
Que la vie m'est douce, la mort m'est sans peine,
Puisq' on les trouve toutes deux dans ton haleine:
Ne m'espargne donc pas satisfais tes rigueurs:
Car si tu me souffres de vivre, Ie me meurs.
The Return.
BEauty whose soft Magnetic chains
Nor time nor absence can unite,
^hy power the narrow bounds disdains
Of nature or Philosophy,
That can by unconfined laws
A motion, though at distance, cause.
Drawn by the sacred influence
Of thy bright eyes, I back return;
And since I no where can dispense
With flames that do in absence burn,
I rather choose 'midst them t'expire
Then languish by a hidden fire.
But if thou insulting pride
Of vulgar beauties do despise,
Who by vain triumphs Deifide,
Their votaries do sacrifice,
Then let those flames, whose magic charm
At distance scorched, approch'd but warm.
Song.
When I lie burning in thine eye,
Or freezing in thy breast,
What Martyrs, in wished flames that die,
Are half so pleased or blessed?
When thy soft accents, through mine ear
Into my soul do fly,
What Angel would not quit his sphere,
To hear such harmony?
Or when the kiss thou gav'st me last
My soul stole in its breath,
What life would sooner be embraced
Then so desired a death?
Then think no freedom I desire,
Or would my fetters leave,
Since Phenix-like I from this fire
Both life and youth receave.
The sick Lover.
GUARINI.
MY sickly breath
Wastes in a double flame;
Whilst Love and Death
To my poor life lay claim;
The feavour in whose heat I melt
By her that causes it not felt.
Thou who alone
Can, yet wilt grant no ease,
Why slight'st thou one
To feed a new disease?
Unequal fair! the heart is thine;
Ah, why then should the pain be mine?
Song.
CElinda, by what potent art
Or unresisted charm,
Do thou thine ear and frozen hear
Against my passion arm.
Or by what hidden influence
Of powers in one combined
Do thou rob love of either sense,
Made deaf as well as blind.
Sure thou as friends united have
Two distant Deities,
And scorn within thy heart have placed,
And love within thine eyes.
Or those soft fetters of thy hair,
A bondage that disdains
All liberty, do guard thine ear
Free from all other chains.
Then my complaint how can thou hear,
Or I this passion fly,
Since thou imprisoned have thine ear
And not confined thine eye?
Song.
FOol take up thy shaft again;
If thy store
Thou profusely spend in vain,
Who can furnish thee with more?
Throw not then away thy darts,
On impenetrable hearts.
Think not thy pale flame can warm
Into tears,
Or dissolve the snowy charm
Which her frozen bosom wears,
That exposed unmelted lies
To the bright suns of her eyes.
But since thou thy power have lost,
Nor can fire
Kindle in that breast, whose frost
Does these flames in mine inspire,
Not to thee but Her I Will sue,
That disdains both me and you.
Delay.
DElay? Alas there cannot be
To Love a greater Tyranny:
Those cruel Beauties that have slain
Their Votaries by their disdain,
Or studied torments, sharp and witty,
Will be recorded for their pity,
And after-ages be misled
To think them kind, when this is spread.
Of deaths the speediest is despair,
Delays the slowest tortures are;
Thy cruelty at once destroys,
But Expectation starves my Joys,
Time and Delay, may bring me past
The power of Love to cure, at last;
And should thou wish to ease my pain,
Thy pity might be lent in vain;
Or if thou have decreed, that I
Must fall beneath thy cruelty,
O kill me soon! Thou will express
More Mercy, even in showing less.
Commanded by his Mistress to woe for her.
MARINO.
STrange kind of Love! that know no President,
A Faith so firm as passes faiths Extent,
By a Tyrannick Beauty long subdued,
I now must sue for her to whom I su'd,
Unhappy Orator! who though I move
For Pity, Pity cannot hope to prove.
Employing thus against my self my Breath,
And in another Life begging my Death.
But if such moving Powers my Accents have,
Why first my own Redress do I not crave?
What hopes that I to pity should incline
Another Breast, who can move none in thine?
Or how can the grieved Patient look for ease
When the Physician suffers the dsease?
If thy sharp Wounds from me expect their Cure,
It Is fit those first be heald that I endure.
Ungentle fair one! why do thou dspence
Unequally thy sacred Influence?
Why pining me, offer'st the precious Food
To one by whom nor prized, nor understood;
So some clear Brook to the full Main, to pay
Her needless Christ al Tribute hastes away,
Profusely foolish; whilst her niggard Tide
Starves the poor Flowers that grow along her side.
Thou who my Glories art designed to own
Come then, and reap the Joys that I have sown:
Yet in thy pride acknowledge, though thou bear
The happy Prize away, the Palm I wear.
Nor the obedience of my Flame accuse,
That what I sought, my self conspired to loose:
The hapless state where I am six'd is such,
To love I seem not, cause I Love too much.
The Repulse.
NOt that by this disdain
I am released,
And freed from thy tyrannick chain,
Do I my self think blessed;
Nor that thy Flame shall burn
No more; for know
That I shall into ashes turn,
Before this fire does so.
Nor yet that unconfined
I now may rove,
And with new beauties please my mind;
But that thou never did love:
For since thou have no part
Felft of this flame,
I only from thy tyrant heart
Repulsed, not banished am.
To loose what once was mine
Would grieve me more
Then those inconstant sweets of thine
Had pleased my soul before.
Now I have not lost the bliss
I never possessed;
And spite of fate am blessed in this,
That I was never blessed.
The Tomb.
WHen, cruel Fair one, I am slain
By thy disdain,
And, as a Trophy of thy scorn,
To some old tomb am born,
Thy fetters must their power bequeath
To those of death;
Nor can thy flame immortal burn,
Like monumental fires within an urn;
Thus freed from thy proud Empire, I shall prove
There is more liberty in Death then Love.
And when forsaken Lovers come
To see my tomb,
Take heed thou mix not with the crowd,
And (as a Victor) proud
To view the spoils thy beauty made
Press near my shade,
Lest thy too cruel breath or name
Should fan my ashes back into a flame,
And thou, devoured by this revengeful fire,
His sacrifice, who died as thine, expire.
But if cold Earth, or Marble must
Conceal my dust,
Whilst hid in some dark ruins, I
Dumb and forgotten lie,
The pride of all thy victory
Will sleep with me:
And they who should attest thy Glory,
Will, or forget, or not believe this story:
Then to increase thy Triumph, let me rest,
Since by thine Eye slain, buried in thy Breast.
The Enjoyment.
St. AMANT.
FAr from the Courts ambitious noise
Retired, to those more harmless Ioys
Which the sweet Country, pleasant fields,
And my own Court, a Cottage, yields;
I lived from all disturbance free,
Though Prisoner (Sylvia) unto Thee;
Secured from fears, which others prove,
Of the inconstancy of Love;
A life, in my esteem, more blessed,
Then e're yet stoopt to deaths Arrest.
My senses and desires agreed
With joint delight each other feed:
A blist, I reached, as far above
Words, as her Beauty, or my Love;
Such as compared with which, the Joys
Of the most happy seem but Toys:
Affection I receive and pay,
My pleasures knew not griefs allay:
The more I tasted I desired,
The more I quenched my Thirst was fired.
Now in some place where Nature shows
Her naked Beauty we repose,
Where she allures the wandering eye
With colors, which fains Art out-vye;
Pearls scattered by the weeping Morn,
Each where the glittering Flowers adorn;
The Mistress of the youthful year
(To whom kind Zephyrus does bear
His amorous Vows and frequent Prayer)
Decks with these Gems her Neck and Hair.
Hither, to quicken Time with sport,
The little sprightly Loves resort,
And dancing over th'enamel'd Mead,
Their Mistresses the Graces lead;
Then to refresh themselves, repair
To the soft Bosom of my fair;
Where from the Kisses they bestow
Upon each other, such sweets flow
As carry in their mixed Breath
A mutual Power of Life and Death.
Next in an Elms dilated shade
We see a rugged Satyr laid,
Teaching his Reed in a soft strain
Of his sweet Anguish to complain;
Then to a lonely Grove retreat,
Where day can no admittance get,
To visit peaceful solitude;
Whom seeing by Repose pursued,
All busy Cares, for fear to spoil
Their calmer Courtship we exile.
There underneath a Myrtle, thought
By Fairies sacred; where was wrought
By Venus hand Loves Mysteries;
And all the Trophies of her eyes,
Our Solemn Prayers to Heaven we send,
That our firm Love might know no End;
Nor time its Vigor er'e impair:
Then to the winged God we swear,
And engraved the Oath in its smooth Rind,
Which in our Hearts we deeper find.
Then to my Dear (as if afraid,
To try her doubted faith) I said,
Would in thy Soul my Form as clear
As in thy Eyes I see it, were.
She kindly angry says, Thou art
Drawn more at large within my Heart,
These Figures in my Eye appear
But small, because they are not near,
Thou through these Glasses s^est thy Face,
As Pictures through their Crystal Case.
Now with delight transported, I
My wreathed Arms about her tie;
The flattering lvie never holds
Her Husband Elm in stricter Folds,
To cool my fervent Thirst, I sip
Delicious Nectar from her lip.
She pledges, and so often past
This amorous health, till Love at last,
Our Souls did with these pleasures sat,
And equally in briate.
A while, our senses stolen away,
Lost in this Ecstasy we lay,
Till both together raised to Life.
We reing age in this kind strife,
Cythaera with her Syrian Boy,
Could never reach our meanest Joy.
The Childish God of Love never tried,
So much of Love with his cold Bride,
As we in one embrace include,
Contesting each to be subdued.
To Celia pleading want of Merit.
DEar urge no more that killing cause
Of our divorce;
Love is not fettered by such laws,
Nor bows to any force:
Though thou deniest I should be thine,
Yet say not thou deserve not to be mine.
Oh rather frown away my breath
With thy disdain,
Or flatter me with smiles to death;
By joy or sorrow slain,
It Is less crime to be killed by thee,
Then I thus cause of mine own death should be.
Thy self of beauty to divest
And me of love,
Or from the worth of thine own breast
Thus to detract, would prove
In us a blindness, and in thee
At best a sacrilegious modesty.
But (Celia) if thou will despise
What all admire,
Nor rate thy self at the just price
Of beauty or desire,
Yet meet my flames and thou shall see
That equal love knows no disparity.
Loves Innocence.
SE how this Ivy strives to twine
Her wanton arms about the Vine,
And her coy lover thus restrains,
Entangled in her amorous chains;
See how these neighboring Palms do bend
Their heads, and mutual murmurs send,
As whispering with a jealous fear
Their loves, into each others ear.
Then blush not such a flame to own
As like thy self no crime has known,
Led by these harmless guides, we may
Embrace and kiss as well as they.
And like those blessed souls above,
Whose life is harmony and love,
Let us our mutual thoughts betray
And in our wills our minds display;
This silent speech is swifter far,
Then the ears lazy species are;
And the expression it afford*
(As our desires) 'bove reach of words*
Thus we (my Dear) of these may learn
A Passion others not discern;
Nor can it shame or blushes move,
Like Plants to live, like Angels love:
Since All excuse with equal Innocence
What above Reason is, or beneath Sense.
The Bracelet.
TRISTAN.
NOw Love be praised! that cruel Fair,
Who my poor Heart restrains
Under so many Chains,
Has weaved a new one for it of her Hair.
These threads of Amber used to play
With every courtly wind,
And never were confined,
But in a thousand Curls allowed to stray
Cruel each part of her is grown,
Nor less unkind then She
These fetters are to Me,
Which to restrain my Freedom, loose their own.
The Kiss.
When on thy lip my soul I breath,
Which there meets thine,
Freed from their fetters by this death
Our subtle Forms combine;
Thus without bonds of sense they move,
And like two Cherubins converse by love.
Spirits to chains of earth confined
Discourse by sense;
But ours that are by flames refined
With those weak ties dispense;
Let such in words their minds display,
We in a kiss our mutual thoughts convey,
But since my soul from me does fly,
To thee retired,
Thou can not both retain; for I
Must be with one inspired;
Then, Dearest, either justly mine
Restore, or in exchange let me have thine:
Yet if thou do return mine own,
Oh take it again!
For it is this pleasing death alone
Gives ease unto my pain:
Kill me once more, or I shall find
Thy pity then thy cruelty, less kind.
Apollo and Daphne.
GARCILASSO MARINO.
When Phoebus saw a rugged Bark beguile
His Love, and his Embraces intercept,
The Leaves instructed by his Grief to smile,
Taking fresh Growth and verdure as he wept:
How can, says he, my woes expect Release,
When Tears, the Subject of my Tears, increase!
His changed yet scorn-retaining Fair he kissed,
From the loved Trunk plucking a little Bough*
And though the Conquest which he sought he mist,
With that Triumphant spoil adorns his Brow.
Thus this disdainful Maid his aim deceives,
Where he expected Fruit he gathers Leaves.
Speaking and Kissing.
THe air which thy smooth voice does break
Into my soul like lightning flies,
My life retires whilst thou do speak,
And thy soft breath its room supplies.
Lost in this pleasing Ecstasy
I join my trembling lips to thine,
And back receive that life from thee,
Which I so gladly did resign.
Forbear, Platonic fools, t'enquire
What numbers do the soul compose;
No harmony can life inspire
But that which from these accents flows.
The Snow-ball.
DOris, I that could repel
All those darts about thee dwell,
And had wisely learned to fear,
Cause I saw a Foe so near;
I that my deaf ear did arm,
Against thy voices powerful charm,
And the lightning of thine eye
Durst (by closing mine) defy,
Cannot this cold snow withstand
From the whiter of thy hand;
Thy deceit has thus done more
Then thy open force before:
For who could suspect or fear
Treason in a face so clear,
Or the hidden fires descry
Wrapped in this cold outside lie;
Flames might thus involved in ice
The deceived world sacrifice;
Nature, ignorant of this
Strange Antiperistasis,
Would her falling frame admire,
That by snow were set on fire.
The Deposition.
THough when I loved thee thou were fair,
Thou art no longer so,
Those glories all the pride they wear
Unto Opinion ow;
Beauties, like stars, in borrowed luster shine,
And 'twas my Love that gave thee thine.
The flames that dwelt within thine eye,
Do now, with mine, expire;
Thy brightest Graces fade, and die
At once with my desire:
Loves fires thus mutual influence return,
Thine cease to shine, when mine to burn.
Then (proud Celinda) hope no more
To be implored or wooed;
Since by thy scorn thou do restore
The wealth my love bestowed;
And thy despised Disdain too late shall find
That none are fair but who are kind.
To his Mistress in Absence.
TASSO.
FAr from thy dearest self, (the Scope
Of all my Aims)
I waste in secret Flames;
And only live because I hope.
O when will Fate restore
The Joys, in whose bright fire
My Expectation shall expire,
That I may live because I hope no more!
Loves Heretic.
HE whose active thoughts disdain
To be Captive to one foe,
And would break his single chain,
Or else more would undergo;
Let him learn the art of me,
By new bondage to be free.
What tyrannick Mistress dare
To one beauty love confine?
Who unbounded as the air
All may court but none decline:
Why should we the Heart deny
As many objects as the Eye?
Wheresoever I turn or move
A new passion does detain me:
Those kind beauties that do love,
Or those pr^ud ones that disdain me;
This frown melts, and that smile burns me;
This to tears, that ashes turns me.
Soft fresh Virgins not full blown,
With their youthful sweetness take me;
Sober Matrons that have known
Long since what these prove, awake me;
Here staid coldness I admire,
There the lively active fire.
She that does by skill dispense
Every favor she bestows,
Or the harmless innocence
Which nor Court nor City knows,
Both alike my soul inflame,
That wild beauty, and this tame.
She that wisely can adorn
Nature with the wealth of art,
Or whose rural sweets do scorn
Borrowed helps to take a heart,
The vain care of that is my pleasure,
Poverty of this my treasure.
Both the wanton and the coy
Me with equal pleasures move;
She whom I by force enjoy,
Or who forces me to love;
This because she will not confess,
That not hide, her happiness,
She whose loosely flowing hair,
Scattered like the beams of the Morn,
Playing with the sportive Air,
Hides the sweets it does adorn,
Captive in that net restrains me,
In those golden fetters chains me.
Nor does she with power less bright
My divided heart invade,
Whose soft tresses spread like Night,
Over her shoulders a black shade;
For the starlight of her eyes
Brighter shines through those dark Skies.
Black, or fair, or tall, or low,
I alike with all can sport;
The bold sprightly Thais woo,
Or the frozen Vestal court;
Every beauty takes my mind,
Tied to all, to none confined.
La belle Confidente.
YOu earthly Souls that court a wanton flame,
Whose pale weak influence
Can rise no higher then the humble name
And narrow laws of Sense,
Learn by our friendship to create
An immaterial fire,
Whose brightness Angels may admire,
But cannot emulate.
Sickness may fright the roses from her cheek,
Or make the Lilies fade,
But all the subtle ways that death does seek
Cannot my love invade:
Flames that are kindled by the eye,
Through time and age expire;
But ours that boast a reach far higher
Can nor decay, nor die.
For when we must resign our vital breath,
Our Loves by Fate benighted,
We by this friendship shall survive in death,
Even in divorce united.
Weak Love through fortune or distrust
In time forgets to burn,
But this pursues us to the Urn,
And marries either's Dust.
La belle Ennemie.
I Yield, dear Enemy, nor know
How to resist so fair a Foe;
Who would not thy soft yoke sustain,
And bow beneath thy easy chain,
That with a bondage blessed might be
Which far transcends all liberty.
But since I freely have resigned
At first assault my willing mind,
Insult not over my captived heart
With too much tyranny and art,
Lest by thy scorn thou lose the prize,
Gaind by the power of thy bright eyes,
And thou this conquest thus shall prove,
Though got by Beauty, kept by Love.
The Dream.
Lope de vega.
TO set my jealous Soul at strife
All things maliciously agree,
Though sleep of Death the Image be,
Dreams are the Portraiture of Life.
I saw, when last I closed my Eyes,
Celinda stoop to another Will;
If specious Apprehension kill,
What would the truth without disguise?
The joys which I should call mine own
Me thought this Rival did possess:
Like Dreams is all my happiness;
Yet Dreams themselves allow me none.
To the Lady D.
Madam,
THe Blushes I betray,
When at your Feet I humbly lay
These Papers, beg you would excuse
The obedience of a bashful Muse,
Who (bowing to your strict command)
Trusts her own Errors to your hand,
Hasty Abortives, which (laid by)
She meant, ere they were born should die:
But since the soft power of your Breath
Has called them back again from Death,
To your sharp Judgment now made known,
She dares for Hers no longer own;
The worst she must not, these resigned
She has to the fire, and where you find
Those your kind Charity admired,
She writ but what your Eyes inspired.
Love Deposed.
YOu that unto your Mistress eyes
Your hearts do sacrifice,
And offer sighs or tears at Loves rich shrine,
Renounce with me
The Idolatry,
Nor this Infernal Power esteem divine*
The Brand, the Quiver, and the Bow,
Which we did first bestow,
And he as tribute wears from every Lover,
I back again
From him have taken,
And the Impostor now unvailed discover.
I can the feeble Child disarm,
Unty his mystic charm,
Divest him of his Wings and break his Arrow,
We will obey
No more his sway,
Nor live confined to laws or bounds so narrow.
And you bright Beauties that inspire
The Boys pale torch with fire,
We safely now your subtle power despise,
And (unscorch'd) may
Like Atoms play
And wanton in the sunshine of your eyes.
Nor think hereafter by new arts
You can betwitch our hearts,
Or raise this Devil by your pleasing charm;
We will no more
His power implore,
Unless like Indians, that he do no harm.
The Divorce.
DEar, back my wounded heart restore,
And turn away thy powerful eyes;
Flatter my willing soul no more,
Love must not hope what Fate denies.
Take, take away thy smiles and kisses,
Thy Love wounds deeper then Disdain,
For he that sees the Heaven he misses,
Sustains two Hels, of loss and pain.
Should thou some others suit prefer,
I might return thy scorn to thee,
And learn Apostasy of her
Who taught me first Idolatry.
Or in thy unrelenting breast
Should I disdain or coyness move,
He by thy hate might be releas't,
Who now is prisoner to thy love.
Since then unkind Fate will divorce
Those whom Affection long united,
Be thou as cruel as this force,
And I in death shall be delighted.
Thus whilst so many suppliants woe
And beg they may thy pity prove,
I only for thy scorn do sue,
It Is charity here not to love.
Time Recovered.
CASONE.
COme (my dear) whilst youth conspires
With the warmth of our desires;
Envious Time about thee watches,
And some Grace each minute snatches:
Now a spirit, now a Ray
From thy Eye he steals away,
Now he blasts some blooming Rose
Which upon thy fresh Cheek grows;
Gold n^w plunders in a Hair;
Now the Rubies does impair
Of thy lips; and with sure have
All thy wealth will take at last;
Only that of which Thou make
Use in time, from time Thou take.
The Bracelet.
REbellious fools that scorn to bow
Beneath Loves easy sway,
Wose stubborn wills no laws allow,
Disdaining to obey,
Mark but this wreath of hair and you shall see
None that might wear such fetters would be free.
I once could boast a soul like you
As unconfined as air;
But mine, which force could not subdue,
Was caught within this snare;
And (by my self betrayed) I for this gold,
A heart that many storms withstood, have sold,
No longer now wise Art enquire
(With this vain search delighted)
How souls that humane breasts inspire
Are to their frames united;
Material chains such spirits well may bind,
When this soft brayd can tie both Arm and Mind.
Now (Beauties) I defy your charm,
Ruled by more powerful Art,
This mystic wreath which crowns my Arm*
Defends my vanquished Heart;
And I, subdued by one more fair, shall be
Secured from Conquest by Captivity.
The Farewell.
SInce Fate commands me hence, and I
Must leave my soul with thee, and die,
Dear, spare one sigh, or else let fall
A tear to crown my Funeral,
That I may tell my grieved heart
Thou art unwilling we should part,
And Martyrs that embrace the fire
Shall with less joy then I expire.
With this last kiss I will bequeath
My soul transfused into thy breath,
Whose active heat shall gently slide
Into thy breast, and there reside,
And be in spite of Fate thus blessed
By this sad death of Heaven possessed;
Then prove but kind, and thou shall see
Love has more power then Destiny.
Claim to Love.
GUARINI.
Alas! alas! thou turnst in vain
Thy beauteous Face away,
Which (like young Sorcerers) raised a Pain
Above its Power to lay.
Love moves not as thou turnst thy Look,
But here does firmly rest;
He long ago thy Eyes forsook
To revel in my Breast.
Thy Power on him why hop'st thou more
Then his on me should be,
The Claim thou lay'st to him is poor
To that he owns from Me.
His Substance in my Heart excells,
His shadow in thy Sight;
Fire where it burns more truly dwells,
Then where it scatters Light.
To his Mistress who dreamed He was wounded.
GUARINI.
THine Eyes (bright Saint) disclose
And thou shall find,
Dreams have not with illusive shows
Deceived thy Mind,
What Sleep presented to thy view,
Awake, and thou shall find is true.
Those mortal Wounds I bear
From thee begin,
Which though they outward not appear
Yet bleed within,
Loves Flame like active Lightning flies,
Wounding the Heart, but not the Eyes.
But now I yield to die
Thy sacrifice,
Nor more in vain will hope to fly
From thy bright Eyes;
Their killing Power cannot be shunned
Open or closed alike they wound.
The Echange.
Dialogue.
Phil. THat kiss which last thou gav'st me, stole
My fainting Life away,
Yet (though to thy Breast fled) my Soul
Still in mine own does stay;

Char. And with the same warm Breath did mine
Into thy Bosom slide,
There dwell contracted unto thine,
Yet still with me reside;

Chor. Both Souls thus in desire are one,
And each is two in Skill,
Doubled in Intellect alone
United in the Will*
Weal Nature no such Power does know,
Love only can these Wonders show.

Vnaltred by Sickness.
Sickness, in vain thou do invade
A Beauty that can never fade.
Could all thy Malice but impair
One of the sweets which crown this fair,
Or steal the spirits from her Eye,
Or kiss into a paler dye.
The blushing Roses of her Cheek,
Our drooping hopes might justly seek,
Redress from thee, and thou might save
Thousands of Lovers from the Grave:
But such assaults are vain, for she
Is too divine to stoop to thee;
Blessed with a Form as much too high
For any Change, as Destiny;
Which no attempt can violate;
For what is her Beauty, is our Fate.
On His Mistresse's Death.
PETRARCH.
Love the Ripe Harvest of my toils
Began to cherish with his Smiles
Preparing me to be endued
With all the Joys I long pursued,
When my fresh Hopes fair and full blown
Death blasts ere I could call my own.
Malicious Death why with rude Force
Do thou my fair from me divorce?
False Life why in this loathed Chain
Me from my fair do thou detain?
In whom assistance shall I find?
Alike are Life and Death unkind.
Pardon me Love thy power outshines,
And laughs at their infirm designs.
She is not wedded to a Tomb,
Nor I to sorrow in her room.
They what thou joyn'st can nere divide:
She lives in me in her I died.
The Exequies.
DRaw near
You Lovers that complain
Of Fortune or Disdain,
And to my Ashes lend a tear;
Melt the hard marble with your groans,
And soften the relentlesse Stones.
Whose cold embraces the sad Subject hide
Of all Loves cruelties, and Beauties Pride.
No Verse
No Epicedium bring,
Nor peaceful Requiem sing,
To charm the terr^^rs of my Hearse;
No profane Numbers must flow near
The sacred silence that dwells here;
Vast Griefs are dumb, softly, oh softly mourn
Lest you disturb the Peace attends my Urn.
Yet strew
Upon my dismal Grave,
Such offerings as you have,
Forsaken Cypress and sad Ewe;
For kinder Flowers can take no Birth
Or growth from such unhappy Earth.
Weep only over my Dust, and say, Here lies
To Love and Fate an equal Sacrifice.
The Silkworm.
THis Silkworm (to long Sleep retired)
The early Year has re-inspir'd,
Who now to pay to thee prepares
The Tribute of her pleasing cares;
And hastens with industrious toil
To make thy Ornament her Spoil:
See with what pain she spins for thee
The thread of her own Destiny,
Then growing proud in Death, to know
That all her curious Labors thou Will, as in Triumph, deign to wear,
Retires to her soft Sepulcher.
Such, Dearest, is that hapless State,
To which I am designed by Fate,
Who by thee (willingly) overcome,
Work mine own Fetters and my Tomb,
A Lady weeping.
MONTALVAN.
AS when some Brook flies from it self away,
The murmuring Crystal loosely runs astray.
And as about the verdant Plain it winds,
The Meadows with a silver ribband binds,
Printing a kiss on every Flower she meets,
Loosing her self to fill them with new sweets,
To scatter frost upon the Lilies Head,
And Scarlet on the Gilliflower to spread;
So melting sorrow, in the fair disguise
Of humid Stars, flowed from bright Cloris Eyes,
Which watring every Flower her Cheek discloses,
Melt into Iesmines here there into Roses.
Ambition.
I Must no longer now admire
The coldness which possessed
Thy snowy Breast,
That can by other Flames be set on Fire;
Poor Love to harsh Disdain betrayed
Is by Ambition thus out-weigh'd.
Had thou but known the vast extent
Of Constant Faith, how far
'Bove all that are
Born slaves to Wealth, or Honors vain ascent;
No richer Treasure could thou find
Than hearts with mutual Chains combined.
But Love is too despised a name,
And must not hope to rise
Above these ties.
Honor and Wealth outshine his paler Flame;
These unite Souls, whilst true desire
Unpitied dies in its own Fire.
Yet, cruel Fair one, I did aim
With no less Justice too,
Than those that sue
For other hopes, and thy proud Fortunes claim,
Wealth honors, honors wealth approve,
But Beauty's only meant for Love.
Song.
When (Dearest Beauty) thou shall pay
Thy faith and my vain hope away
To some dull soul that cannot know
The worth of that thou do bestow;
Lest with my sighs and tears I might
Disturb thy unconfined delight,
To some dark shade I will retire,
And there forgot by all expire.
Thus whilst the difference thou shall prove,
Betwixt a feigned and real Love,
Whilst he, more happy, but less true,
Shall reap those joys I did pursue,
And with those pleasures crowned be
By Fate, which Love designed for me,
Then thou perhaps thy self wilt find
Cruel too long, or too soon kind.
The Revenge.
RONSARD.
FAir Rebel to thy self, and Time,
Who laughst at all my tears,
When thou have lost thy youthful prime
And age his Trophie rears,
Weighing thy inconsiderate pride
Thou shall in vain accuse it,
Why Beauty am I now denied
Or knew not then to use it?
Then shall I wish ungentle Fair
Thou in like flames may burn;
Venus, if just will hear my prayer
And I shall laugh my turn.
Song.
I Will not trust thy tempting graces,
Or thy deceitful charms,
Nor prisoner be to thy embraces,
Or fettered in thy arms;
No, Celia, no, not all thy art
Can wound or captivate my heart.
I will not gaze upon thy Eyes,
Or wanton with thy Hair,
Lest those should burn me by surprise,
Or these my soul ensnare:
Nor with those smiling dangers play,
Or fool my Liberty away.
Since then my wary heart is free,
And unconfined as thine,
If thou would mine should captived be,
Thou must thine own resign,
And gratitude may thus move more
Then Love or Beauty could before,
Song.
NO, I will sooner trust the Wind,
When falsely kind
It courts the pregnant Sails into a storm,
And when the smiling Waves persuade
Be willingly betrayed,
Then thy deceitful Vows or Form.
Go and beguile some easy heart
With thy vain art;
Thy smiles and kisses on those fools bestow,
Who only see the Calms that sleep
On this smooth flattering Deep,
But not the hidden dangers know.
They that like me thy Falsehood prove,
Will scorn thy Love.
Some may deceived at first adore thy Shrine
But He that as thy sacrifice
Does willingly fall twice,
Dies his own Martyr, and not thine.
To a blind Man in Love.
MARINO.
LOver than Love more blind, whose bold thoughts dare
Fix on a Woman is both young and fair:
If Argus with a hundred Eyes not one
Could guard, hop'st thou to keep thine, who have none?
Answer.
I Am blind, it is true, but in Loves rules, defect
Of sense, is aided by the Intellect.
And senses by each other are supplied,
The touch enjoyes what is to the sight denied.
Song.
I Prithee let my heart alone
Since now it is raised above thee
Not all the Beauty thou do own
Again can make me love thee:
He that was shipwrack'd once before
By such a Sirens call,
And yet neglects to shun that shore,
Deserves his second fall.
Each flattering kiss, each tempting smile
Thou do in vain bestow,
Some other Lovers might beguile
Who not thy falsehood know.
But I am proof against all art,
No vows shall e're persuade me
Twice to present a wounded Heart
To her that has betrayed me*
Could I again be brought to love
Thy form though more divine,
I might thy scorn as justly move,
As now thou suffer mine*
The Loss.
YEt ere I go,
Disdainsul Beauty thou shall be
So wretched, as to know
What Joys thou fling'st away with me?
A Faith so bright,
As Time or Fortune could not rust;
So firm, that Lovers might
Have read thy story in my dust*
And crowned thy Name
With Laurel verdant as thy Youth,
Whilst the shrill voice of Fame
Spread wide thy Beauty and my Truth.
This thou have lost;
For all true Lovers when they find
That my just aims were crossed,
Will speak thee lighter then the wind.
And none will lay
Any oblation on thy shrine,
But such as would betray
Thy faith, to faiths as false as thine.
Yet if thou choose
On such thy freedom to bestow,
Affection may excuse,
For love from Sympathy does flow.
The Self-cruel.
CAst off for shame ungentle maid
That misbecoming Joy thou wear'st,
For in my Death (though long delayed)
Unwisely cruel thou appearst.
Insult over Captives with disdain,
Thou can not triumph over the slain.
No, I am now no longer thine,
Nor can thou take delight to see
Him whom thy Love did once confine
Set, though by Death, at Liberty
For if my fall a smile beget,
Thou gloriest in thy own Defeat.
Behold how thy unthrifty pride
Has murdered him that did maintain it;
And wary Souls who never tried
Thy Tyrant Beauty, will disdain it:
But I am softer, and that me
Thou would not pity, pity thee.
Song.
By M. W. M.
Were thou yet fairer then thou art,
Which lies not in the power of Art,
Or had thou in thine Eyes more Darts
Then ever Cupid shot at Hearts;
Yet if they were not thrown at me
I would not cast a Thought on Thee.
I Would rather marry a Disease,
Than court the thing I cannot please:
She that will cherish my Desires
Must meet my Flames with equal Fires.
What pleasure is there in a Kiss
To him that doubts the Hearts not his?
I love thee not because the art fair
Softer then down smoother then Air;
Nor for the Cupids that do lie
In either Corner of thine Eye:
Would thou then know what it might be?
It Is I love you, 'cause you love me.
Answer.
Were thou by all Affections sought,
And fairer then thou would be thought:
Or had thine Eyes as many Darts
As thou believ'st they shoot at Hearts,
Yet if thy Love were paid to me,
I would not offer mine to thee.
I Would sooner court a Fevers heat,
Then her that owns a Flame as great,
She that my Love will entertain,
Must meet it with no less disdain.
For mutual Fires themselves destroy,
And willing Kisses yield no Joy.
I love thee not because alone
Thou can all Beauty call thine own,
Nor does my passion fuel seek,
In thy bright Eye or softer Cheek:
Then fairest if thou would know why
I love thee cause thou can deny.
The Relapse.
OH turn away those cruel Eyes,
The stars of my undoing.
Or death in such a bright disguise,
May tempt a second wooing.
Punish their blindly impious Pride,
Who dare contemn thy glory;
It was my fall that deifi'd
Thy name, and sealed thy Story.
Yet no new sufferings can prepare
A higher praise to crown thee;
Though my first death proclaim thee fair,
My second will unthrone thee.
Lovers will doubt thou can entice
No other for thy fuel,
And if thou burn one Victime twice,
Both think thee poor and cruel.
To the Countess of S. with the holy Court.
Madam,
SInce every place you bless, the name
This Book assumes may justlier claim,
(What more a Court then where you shine?
And where your soul, what more divine?)
You may perhaps doubt at first sight,
That it usurps upon your right;
And praising virtues that belong
To you in others, does yours wrong;
No, it is your self you read, in all
Perfections earlier Ages call
Their own; all Glories they e're knew
Were but faint Prophecies of you.
You then have here sole Interest whom it is meant
As well to entertain, as represent.
Song.
DE VOITURE.
I Languish in a silent Flame;
For she to whom my vows incline
Does own perfections so divine,
That but to speak were to disclose her Name.
If I should say that she the Store
Of Natures Graces does comprize,
The Love and wonder of all Eyes,
Who will not guess the Beauty I adore?
Or though I warily conceal
The Charms her looks and Soul possess;
Should I her cruelty express,
And say she smiles at all the Pains we feel,
Among such suppliants as implore
Pity, distributing her Hate,
Inexorable as their Fate:
Who will not guess the Beauty I adore?
Drawn for Valentine by the L. D. S.
THough against me Love and Destiny conspire,
Though I must waste in an unpitied fire,
By the same Deity, severe, as fair,
Commanded adoration and despair:
Though I am marked for Sacrifice to tell
The growing age what dangerous Glories dwell
In this bright dawn, who when she spreads her rays
Will challenge every heart, and every praise;
Yet she who to all hope forbids my claim
By Fortune's taught indulgence to my Flame.
Great Queen of chance! unjustly we exclude
Thy Power an interest in Beatitude:
Who, with mysterious judgment do dispense
The Bounties of unerring Providence;
Whilst we, to whom the causes are unknown,
Would style that blindness thine, which is our own,
As kind in Justice to thy self as me,
Thou have redeemed thy Name and Votarie:
Nor will I prize this less for being thine,
Nor longer at my Destiny repine.
Counsel^ and choice are things below thy State,
Fortune relieves the cruelties of Fate.
The modest Wish.
BARCLAY.
REach Incense Boy! Thou pious Flamen pray
To genial Deities these Rites we pay.
Fly far from hence such as are only taught
To fear the Gods by guilt of Crime or Thought.
This is my Suit, grant it Celestial Powers,
If what my will Affects oppose not yours.
First, pure before your Altars may I stand,
And practice studiously what you command.
My Parents Faith devoutly let me prize,
Nor what my Ancestors esteemed despise.
Let me not vexed enquire, (when thriving Ill
Depresseth good) why thunder is so still?
No such ambitious knowledge trouble Me;
Those curious Thoughts advance not Piety:
Peaceful my House, in Wife and Children blessed,
Nor these beyond my Fortunes be increast.
None cousen me with Friendships specious Gloss.
None dearly buy my Friendship with their Loss.
To Suits nor wars my quiet be betrayed;
My quiet, to the Muses justly paid:
Want never force me court the rich with Lies,
And intermix my suit with Flatteries:
Let my sure friends deceive the tedious Light,
And my sound sleeps, with Debts not broke, the Night.
Cheerful my Board, my Smiles shared by my Wife,
O Gods! yet mindful still of humane Life,
To die nor let me wish nor fear; among
My Joys mix Griefs, Griefs that not last too long.
My Age be happy, and when Fate shall claim
My thread of Life, let me survive in Fame.
Enough: the Gods are pleased; the Flames aspire,
And crackling Laurel triumphs in the Fire.
E Catalectis vet. Poet.
A Small well-gotten Stock and Country seat
I have, yet my content makes both seem great.
My quiet Soul to fears is not inured,
And from the sins of Idleness secured:
Others may seek the Camp, others the Town,
And fool themselves with pleasure or renown;
Let me unminded in the common crowd
Live Master of the time that I Am allowed.
On the Edition of M. Fletchers Works.
FLetcher, (whose Fame no Age can ever wast;
Envy of ours, and glory of the last)
Is now alive again; and with his Name
His sacred ashes waked into a Flame;
Such as before did by a secret Charm
The wildest Heart subdue, the coldest warm,
And lend the Ladies Eyes a power more bright,
Dispensing thus to either, Heat and Light.
He to a sympathy those Souls betrayed
Whom Love or Beauty never could persuade;
And in each moved Spectator could beget
A real passion by a Counterfeit:
When first Bellario bled, what Lady there
Did not for every drop let fall a tear?
And when Aspasia wept, not any Eye
But seemed to wear the same sad Livery
By him inspired the feigned Lucina drew
More streams of melting sorrow then the true;
But then the Scornful Lady did beguile
Their easy griefs* and teach them all to smile.
Thus he Affections could, or raise or lay;
Love, Grief, and Mirth thus did his Charms obey:
He Nature taught her passions to outdo,
How to refine the old, and create new;
Which such a happy likeness seemed to bear,
As if that Nature Art, Art Nature were.
Yet all had nothing been, obscurely kept
In the same Urn wherein his Dust has slept,
Nor had he ris' the Delphick Wreath to claim,
Had not the dying Scene expired his Name.
O, the indulgent Justice of this Age,
To grant the Press, what it denies the Stage!
Despair our Joy has doubled; He is come
Twice welcome by this Postliminium;
His loss preserved him; They that silenced Wit
Are now the Authors to eternize it:
Thus Poets are in spite of Fate revived,
And Plays by intermission longer lived.
To Mr. W. Hammond.
THou best of friendship, knowledge and of Art!
The charm of whose loved name, preserves my heart
From female vanities (thy name, which there
Till time dissolves the Fabric, I must wear)
Forgive a Crime which long my soul oppressed,
And crept by chance in my unwary Breast,
So great, as for thy pardon were unfit,
And to forgive were worse then to commit,
But that the fault and pain were so much one,
The very act did expiate what was done.
I (who so often sported with the flame,
Played with the Boy, and laughed at both as tame)
Betrayed by Idleness and Beauty, fell
At last in love, love both the sin and Hell:
No punishment great as my fault esteemed,
But to be that which I so long had seemed.
Behold me such, a Face, a Voice, a Lute,
The sentence in a Minute execute.
I yield, recant, the Faith which I before
Denied, profess; the Power I scorned, implore.
Alas in vain! no prayers, no vows can bow
Her stubborn heart, who neither will allow:
But see how strangely what was meant no less
Then torment, proved my greatest happiness;
Delay, that should have sharpened, starved desire,
And cruelty not fanned, but quenched my fire.
Love bound me, now by kind disdain set free,
I can despise that Love as well as she.
That sin to friendship I away have thrown,
My heart thou may without a rival own,
While such as willingly themselves beguile,
And sell away their freedoms for a smile,
Blush to confess our joys as far above
Their hopes, as friendship's longer lived then Love.
On M. Shirley's Poems.
WHen dearest Friend, thy verse does re-inspire
Loves pale decaying Torch with brighter fire,
Whilst every where thou do dilate thy flame,
And to the World spread thy Odelias Name,
The Justice of all Ages must remit
To Her the Prize of Beauty, Thee of Wit.
Then like some skilful Artist, that to wonder
Framing a piece, displeased, takes it asunder,
Thou Beauty do depose, her Charms deny,
And all the mystic chains of Love untie;
Thus thy diviner Muse a power 'bove Fate
May boast, that can both make and uncreate.
Next thou call'st back to life that Lovesick Boy,
To the kinde-hearted Nymphs less fair then coy,
Who, by reflex Beams burnt with vain desire,
Did Phoenix-like, in his own flames expire:
But should he view his shadow drawn by thee,
He with himself once more in love would be.
Echo (who though she words pursue, her have
Can only overtake and stop the last)
Shall her first Speech and human veil obtain
To sing thy softer numbers over again.
Thus into dying Poetry, thy Muse
Does full perfection and new life infuse.
Each line deserves a Laurel, and thy praise
Asks not a Garland, but a Grove of Bays:
Nor can ours raise thy lasting Trophies higher,
Who only reach at merit to admire.
But I must chide thee Friend, how can thou be
A Patron, yet a Foe to Poetry?
For while thou do this Age to Verse restore,
Thou do deprive the next of owning more;
And have so far even future Aims surpast,
That none dare write; Thus being first and last,
All, their abortive Muses will suppress,
And Poetry by this increase grow less.
On M. Sherburn's Translation of Seneca's Medea, and vindication of the Author.
THat wise Philosopher, who had designed
To life the various passions of the Mind,
Did wronged Medea's Jealousy prefer
To entertain the Roman Theater;
Both to instruct the Soul, and please the Sight,
At once begetting Horror and delight.
This cruelty thou do once more express
Though in a strange, no less becoming dress;
And her revenge have robbed of half its pride,
To see it self thus by it self outvi'd,
That boldest Ages past may say, our times
Can speak, as well as act their highest Crimes.
Nor was it enough to do his Scene this right,
But what thou gav'st to us, with equal light
Thou would bestow on him, nor were more just
Unto the Authors work, then to his Dust;
Thou do make good his title, aid his Claim,
Both vindicate his Poem and his Name,
So shar'st a double wreath; for all that we
Unto the Poet owe, he owes to thee.
Though change of tongues stolen praise to some afford,
Thy Version has not borrowed but restored.
On M. Halls Essays.
WIts that matur'd by time have courted praise,
Shall see their works outdone in these Essays;
And blush to know, thy earlier years display
A dawning, clearer then their brightest day.
Yet I Will not praise thee, for thou have outgrown
The reach of all men's praises, but thine own.
Encomiums to their objects are exact;
To praise and not at full is to detract.
And with most justice are the best forgot,
For praise is bounded when the Theme is not:
Since mine is thus confined, and far below
Thy merit, I forbear it, nor will show
How poor the Autumnal Pride of some appears,
To the ripe fruit thy vernal season bears.
Yet though I mean no praise, I come to invite
Thy forward Aims still to advance their flight;
Rise higher yet, what though thy spreading wreath
Lessen to their dull sight who stay beneath?
To thy full Learning how can all allow
Just praise, unless that all were learned as thou?
Go on in spite of such low souls, and may
Thy growing worth know Age, though not decay:
Till thou pay back thy theft; and live to climb
As many years as thou have snatched from Time.
On Sir J. S. his Picture and Poems.
SUCKLING, whose numbers could invite
Alike to wonder, and delight,
And with new spirit did inspire,
The Thespian Scene, and Delphick Lyre.
Is thus expressed in either part,
Above the humble reach of Art.
Drawn by the Pencil, here you find
His Form, by his own Pen his Mind.
The Union.
(...).
By Mr. William Fairfax.
AS in the Crystal Center of the sight
Two subtle beams make but one Cone of light,
Or when one flame twined with another is,
They both ascend in one bright Pyramid;
Our spirits thus into each other flow,
One in our being, one in what we know,
In what we will, desire, dislike, approve,
In what we love, and one is that pure love.
As in a burning glass the aerial Flame,
With the producing Ray is still the same:
We to Loves purest quintessence refined,
Do both become one undefided mind.
This sacred fire into it self converts
Our yielding spirits, and our melting hearts,
Till both our souls into one spirit run,
So several lines are in their center one.
And when thy fair Idea is impressed,
In the soft tablet of my easier breast,
The sweet reflection brings such sympathy,
That I my better self behold in thee;
And all perfections that in thee combine,
By this resultance are entirely mine;
Thy Rays disperse my shades who only live
Bright in the Luster thou art pleased to give.
Answer.
IF we are one dear friend! why should thou be
At once unequal to thy self and me?
By thy release thou swell'st my debt the more,
And do but rob thy self to make me poor.
What part can I have in thy luminous Cone?
What Flame (since my loves thine) can call my own?
The palest star is less the son of night,
Who but thy borrowed know no native light:
Was It not enough thou freely did bestow
The Muse, but thou would give the Laurel too?
And twice my aims by thy assistanc raise,
Conferring first the merit, then the praise?
But I should do thee greater injury,
Did I believe this praise were meant to me,
Or thought, though thou have worth enough to spare
To Enrich another soul, that mine should share,
Thy Muse seeming to lend calls home her fame,
And her due wreath does in renouncing claim.
Pythagoras his moral Rules.
FIrst to immortal God thy duty pay,
Observe thy Vow, honor the Saints: obey
Thy Prince and Rulers, nor their Laws despise
Thy Parents reverence, and near allies:
Him that is first in Virtue make thy Friend,
And with observance his kind speech attend:
Nor (to thy power) for light faults cast him by,
Thy power is neighbor to necessity.
These know, and with intentive care pursue;
But Anger Sloth, and Luxury subdue.
In sight of others or thy self forbear
What Is Ill; but of thy self stand most in fear.
Let Justice all thy words and actions sway,
Nor from the even course of reason stray;
For know that all men are to die ordained,
And riches are as quickly lost as gained.
Crosses that happen by divine decree
(If such thy Lot) bear not impatiently.
Yet seek to remedy with all thy Care
And think the just have not the greatest share.
Amongst men discourses good and bad are spread,
Despise not those, nor be by these misled.
If any some notorious falsehood say,
Thou the report with equal judgment weigh*
Let not men's smoother promises invite,
Nor rougher threats from just resolves thee fright.
If ought thou would attempt, first ponder it,
Fools only inconsiderate acts Commit.
Nor do what afterward thou may repent,
First learn to know the thing on which the art bent.
Thus thou a life shall lead with joy repleat.
Nor must thou care of outward health forget:
Such Temperance use in exercise and diet
As may preserve thee in a settled quiet.
Meats unprohibited, not curious, choose,
Decline what any other may accuse:
The rash expense of vanity detest,
And sordidnesse: a Mean in all is best.
Hurt not thy self; act naught thou do not weigh;
And every business of the following day
As soon as by the Morn awaked dispose,
Nor suffer sleep at night thy Eyes to close
Till thrice that Diary thou have orerun,
How slipped? what Deeds? what duty left undone?
Thus thy account summed up from first to last
Grieve for the Ill, joy for what good has past.
These if thou study, practice, and affect,
To sacred Virtue will thy steps direct.
Natures eternal Fountain I attest,
Who did the soul with fourfold power invest.
Ere thou begin pray well thy work may end,
Then shall thy knowledge to all things extend
Divine and humane; where enlarged, restrained,
How nature is by general likeness chained.
Vain hope nor ignorance shall dim thy sight,
Then shall thou see that hapless men invite
Their Ills, to good (though present) Deaf and Blind,
And few the cure of their Misfortunes find;
This only is the fate that harms and rowls
Through miseries successive, humane souls.
Within is a continual hidden fight,
Which we to shan must study, not excite;
Good God! how little trouble should we know
If thou to all men would their Genius show.
But fear not thou; Men come of heavenly Race,
Taught by diviner Nature what to embrace,
Which if pursued, Thou all I named shall gain,
And keep thy soul clear from thy Bodies stain;
In time of Prayer and cleansing meats denied
At stain from; Thy minds rains let reason guide:
Then raised to Heaven, thou from thy Body free
A deathlesse Saint, no more shall mortal be.
The common received Opinion that Pythagoras is not the Author of these verses,
seems to be defended by Chrysippus in Agellius, Plutarch, Laertius, and
Iamblichus, who affirm, that the rules and Sense only were his, digested into
Verse by some of his Scholars. But it is not improbable, that they did no more
than collect the verses, and so gave occasion to the mistake; for Laertius
confesses that Pythagoras used to deliver his precepts to his Disciples in
verse, one of which was (...);
How slipped? what deeds? what duty left undone?
Of this Opinion I believe Clemens Alexandrinus, who cites one of these lines
under his Name, and Proclus when he calls him (...), The Father of the golden
verses.

[thy duty pay]

(...); Though Hierocles in another Sense read (...).

[thy Vow]

(...). Hierocles, (...), observance of religious Rules.

[Honour the Saints]

(...). Laertius on these words explains Souls whereof the Air is full.
Hierocles, Angels, the sons of God, etc.

[Thy Prince and Rulers]

(...). Hierocles (...); Capable of Government.

[Nor their Laws despise]

(...). Hierocles (...); to obey their Commands.

[With observance]

(...), that is, (...): Yet Hierocles otherwise.

[Thy power is neighbor to necessity] Whatsoever necessity can force thee to
bear, it is in thy power to bear voluntarily. If thy friend have wronged thee,
how can thou say, thou art not able to endure his Company, when Imprisonment
might constrain thee to it? See Hierocles.

['Mongst men discourses good and bad are spread,
Despise not these, nor be by those misled.]
So Hierocles, Marcilius reads (...) (that is (...)) for (...), which best
agrees with this sense.

[what any other may accuse]

(...) Hierocles interprets (...), Invidia; so taken sometimes by Cicero,
Ma^cil:

[And every business of the following day
As soon as by the Morn awaked dispose]
These two lines I have inserted upon the Authority of Porphyrius, (...).
(...), etc.
(...).
(...)
(...).
He advised every one before he slept to repeat these verses to himself, Nor
suffer Sleep at Night, etc.
And before he rose these,
And every business, etc.
How much this confirms Pythagoras the Author, and his Scholars but disposers
of the Verses (who as it appears forgot these two) is evident enough; The main
argument they insist upon who labor to prove the contrary is derived from
these words,

[Natures eternal fountain I attest
Who did the soul with fourfold power invest]
Where Marcilius expounds (...) illum a quo Scientiam (...) acceperant, is
autem doctor eorum Pythagoras, as if it were

Him who the Tetrad to our souls expressed
(Natures eternal fountain) I attest;
And then takes pains to show that his Scholars used to swear by Him. But (...)
for (...) is not without a little violence to (...) (which makes Iamblicus read
(...)) Marcilius in this being the less excusable for confessing immediately,
Animae* vero nostrae dixerunt Pythagorei quoniam quaternarius animae numerus
est, an explanation inconsistent with the other, but (as I conceive) truer;
Macrobius expressly agrees with it; Iuro tibi per eum qui dat animae nostrae
quaternarium numerum, or as others Per qui nostrae animae numerum dedit ipse
quaternum, By him who gave us Life, God. In which sense (...) much more easily
will follow (...) than (...), The four powers of the soul are, Men's, Scientia,
Opinio, Sensus, which Aristotle calls the four instruments of judgment,
Hierocles (...). The Mind is compared to an unite in that of many singulars it
makes one. Science to the number two, (which amongst the Pythagoreans is
numerus infinitatis) because it proceeds from things certain and granted to
uncertain and infinite. Opinion to three, a number of indefinite variety. Sense
to four, as furnishing the other three. In this exposition I am the more easily
persuaded to dissent from Plutarch, Hierocles, Iamblichus and other
Interpreters, since they differ no less amongst themselves.

[Within is a continual hidden fight]

Betwixt Reason and Appetite.

[How little trouble]

As Marcilius reads, (...), etc.

[Their Genius]

(...) Hierocles expounds (...). Genius includes both.

[what t'embrace]

Hierocles, (...), all that they ought to do.

[from the bodies stain]

Hierocl. from the Infection of the Body.

[In times of Prayer

(...), Meditation. See Plato in Phaedone.

[and cleansing]

Which extended (says Hierocles) (...), to meat and drink, etc.

[Meats denied]

what they were is expressed by Laertius, Suidas, Hierocles, Agellius, etc.
Hierocles affirms that in these words (...), he cites his sacred Apothegms:
(...). Concerning meat is particularly delivered in his holy Apothegms that
which it was not lawful to make known to every one. Which is a great testimony
that Pythagoras and not any of his Disciples writ these verses; for if the
Author had cited him before in the third person (as they argue from (...)) he
would have cited him now in the first.

FINIS.
