TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, RIGHT Worshipful, and other my beloved
Parishioners, Inhabitants of the Precinct of Blackfriars LONDON, such
sufficiency of Grace as may bring them to fullness of Glory.
IF noble Birth, high Honor, great Estate, true Piety, bountiful Charity,
good Esteem of Gods word and Ministers, and in particular, entire love of the
Author, be inducements to choose a Patron for his work, I, for my part, need
not go far for a Patron. In mine own parish are all these. To you therefore
(right Honorable, right Worshipful, and other my beloved Parishioners, most
worthy of all due respect) do I dedicate these my poor pains about
Domestical Duties. To testify the equal duty which I owe, and the
impartial respect which I bear to you all, I make you all as one Patron. You
were the first over whom I ever had any ministerial charge. To this charge by
your free choice was I called. Among you have I spent Since Midsommer. 1608.
almost two full prentiships. You have always so accepted my pains, and
respected my person, as I never had any cause to repent my acceptance of this
place, and calling: but rather to thank God for the same. My desire is (if so
it may seem good to the divine providence) to spend all my days among you:
and, while I am among you, to help forward your spiritual edification. This
is the maine end of my calling, and the mark, which, as in the ordinary course
of my Ministry, so in the publishing of these Eight Treatises of Domestical
Duties, and dedicating them to you, I have aimed at. As in testimony of Love
and Duty I have preached in your hearing, and published in your name these
Duties, so do you manifest your kind acceptance of my former, and latter
pains, by a conscionable observing of them, so far forth as they are
agreeable to Gods word: that all who know you, may know by that evident
demonstration, how well you have relished and approved them. Thus shall you
gain much profit, and my self much comfort by my pains. Oh if the head and
several members of a family would be persuaded every of them to be
conscionable in performing their own particular duties, what a sweet society,
and happy harmony would there be in houses? What excellent seminaries would
families be to Church and Commonwealth? (...). Arist. Eth. lib. 8. cap. 12.
Necessary it is that good order be first set in families: for as they were
before other polities, so they are somewhat the more necessary: and good
members of a family are like to make good members of Church and commonwealth.
The subject matter therefore of these Treatises is worth the handling, if I
were able according to the worth thereof to handle it. I have endeavored to do
what I could therein, though I have not attained to what I would. Be you like
unto God, who, if there be first a willing mind, accepts according to that a
man has, and not according to that he has not. Though for such a matter as is
handled in these Treatises, the work may seem at first sight to be too
copious, yet I hope the obseruant Reader will not find it too tedious. It is
the variety of many, M (...). Ammon. Multum loqui est rem superfluis agere
verbis. Aug. Epist. 121. ad Prob.
not the prolixity of few points which has made this book to swell to that
bigness which it has. The first Treatise (which is a fourth part of the
book) contains a Commentary on that part of Scripture out of which
Domestical Duties are raised: wherein the Apostle setting forth Christ and the
Church as patterns to husbands and wives, lively declares the great love of
Christ to his Church, and the near union betwixt them, together with other
deep mysteries, the unfolding whereof has a little the longer detained me.
But as I have a while insisted on maine matters of much moment, so have I very
briefly passed over other points. The other Treatises, wherein the Duties
themselves are handled, are every of them much shorter then the first. In them
I have barely propounded and briefly proved the truth and equity of the
several duties, except some choice points which are of especial use, or at
least through disuse much questioned: and them I have more largely handled. And
because contraries laid together (...). Arist. Rhet. lib. 3. cap. 2.
do much set forth each other in their lively colors, I have to every duty
annexed the contrary fault, and aberration from it. For many that hear the
duties think all well enough, till they hear also the contrary vices, whereby
in their consciences they are most convinced. Concerning the many faults and
vices of bad Husbands, Wives, Parents, Children, Masters and Servants, taxed in
these Treatises, let me entreat you, not to apply them too generally to all
Husbands, Wives, Parents, Children, Masters and Servants. Has not wise Solomon
much taxed the lightness, shrewishness, pride, flattery, and other vices of
women? And shall sober, meek, humble, honest women think themselves taxed
thereby? By like reason might unchaste strumpets, untrusty gossips, unquiet
shrewes, and proud dames think themselves commended by those excellent
commendations which be gives of good women. Let every one, as their conscience
(an impartial Judge) shall bear them witness, make a right application of
every thing to themselves. Thus shall we Ministers be freed from many evil
surmizes. I remember that when these Domestical Duties were first uttered out
of the pulpit, much exception was taken against the application of a wives
subjection to the restraining of her from disposing the common goods of the
family without, or against her husbands consent. But surely they that made
those exceptions did not well think of the Cautions and Lamitations which were
then delivered, and are now again expressly noted: which are, that the foresaid
restraint be not extended to the Paraphernalia. Treat. 3.. 21.
proper goods of a wife, no nor ouerstrictly to such Ibid.
goods as are set apart for the use of the family, nor to Treat. 3.. 22.
extraordinary cases, nor always to an Treat. 3.. 19.
express consent, nor to the Treat. 3.. 18.
consent of such husbands as are impotent, or far and long absent. If any
other warrantable caution shall be showed me, I will be as willing to admit it,
as any of these. Now that my meaning may not still be perverted, I pray you, in
reading the restraint of wives power in disposing the goods of the family, ever
bear in mind those Cautions. Other exceptions were made against some other
particular duties of wives. For many that can patiently enough hear their
duties declared in general terms, cannot endure to hear those generals
exemplified in their particular branches. This comes too near to the quick,
and pierces too deep. But (to interpret all, according to the rule of love,
in the better part) I take the maine reason of the many exceptions which were
taken, to be this, that wives duties (according to the Apostles method) being
in the first place handled, there was taught (as must have been taught, except
the truth should have been betrayed) what a wife, in the uttermost extent of
that subjection under which God has put her, is bound unto, in case her
husband will stand upon the uttermost of his authority: which was so taken, as
if I had taught that an husband might, and ought to exact the uttermost, and
that a wife was bound in that uttermost extent to do all that was delivered as
duty, whether her husband exact it or no. But when I came to deliver husbands
duties, Treat. 4.. 18.
I showed, that he ought not to exact whatsoever his wife was bound unto (in
case it were exacted by him) but that he ought to make her a joint Governor of
the family with himself, and refer the ordering of many things to her
discretion, and with all honorable and kind respect to carry himself
toward her. In a word, I so set down an husbands duties, as if he be wise and
conscionable in observing them, his wife can have no just cause to complain of
her subjection. That which makes a wives yoke heavy and hard, is an husbands
abuse of his authority: and more pressing his wives duty, then performing his
own: which is directly contrary to the Ephesians. 5. 33. See Treat. 1.. 95.
Apostles rule. This just Apology I have been forced to make, that I might
not ever be judged (as some have censured me) (...). Athen.
an hater of women. Now that in all those places where a wives yoke may seem
most to pinch, I might give some ease, I have to every head of wives duties
made a reference, in the margin over against it, to the duties of husbands
answerable thereunto, and noted the reference with this mark *, that it might
the more readily be turned unto. Yea I have further paralleled, and laid even
one against another in one view, the heads of husbands and wives duties, as
they answer each other: and in like manner the contrary aberrations: with a
reference made unto the particular sections where they are handled: that so on
the one side it may appear, that if both of them be conscionable and careful
to perform their own duty, the matrimonial yoke will so equally lie on both
their necks, as the wife will be no more pinched therewith then the husband,
but that it will be like Christ's spiritual yoke, light and easy: and that on
the Mat. 11. 30.
other side it may be manifest that there is commonly as much failing by
husbands in their duties, as by wives in theirs. This parallel and euen-setting
out of each of their duties, and of the contrary aberrations, I have annexed
next to this epistle. And further I have added thereto a table of the several
heads of those points that are handled in the eight following Treatises, that
by this help you may the more readily find out such particular points as you
desire most especially to read. To show that the duties prescribed to Husbands,
Wives, Parents, Children, Masters, and Servants, are such as in conscience they
are bound unto, I have endeavored to show how they are grounded on the word of
God, and gathered from thence. To avoid prolixity, I have referred most of the
quotations to the margin. If your leisure will serve you, you may do well to
search them out. Two things have been especial helps to me for finding out
the many duties noted in these Treatises, and vices contrary thereunto:
Observation and Disposition. Observation both of such duties as the Scripture
commends and contrary vices as it condemns: and also of such commendable
virtues as I well liked in those Husbands, Wives, Parents, Children, Masters,
and Servants, that I came among, and such unseemly vices as I disliked in
them: and Disposition of one point after another in the best order that I
could. My method and manner of proceeding brought many things to my mind,
which otherwise might have slipped by. For by method sundry and several points
appertaining to one matter are drawn forth, as in a chain one link draws
up another. There is no better way to find out many observations in a text,
then by a methodicall resolution thereof. As method is an help to Invention,
so also to retention. It is as the thread or wier whereon pearls are put,
which keeps them from scattering. And if a man by abundance of matter be cast
into a labyrinth, by the help of method he may easily and readily find out
the way again. In which respects method is fitly styled the
Methodusintelligentiae parens est, and magistra memoriae.
Mother of the Mind, and Mistress of Memory. If you well mark the order and
dependence of points one upon another, you will find as great an help in
conceiving and remembering Ordo memoriae maxim, lumen affert. Cic. 2. de Orat.
them, as I did in inuenting and disposing them.

Because there is not one word to comprise under it both masters and
mistresses, as fathers and mothers are comprised under Parents, and sons and
daughters under Children, I have according to the Scripture phrase comprised
Mistresses under Masters: so as the duties enjoined to them belong to these, so
far as may stand with their sex. To conclude, in recompense of all my pains
I heartily pray you all to pray heartily for him who daily prays for you,
even Church-court in Blackfriars London. 2. Febr. 1621.

The first Treatise. AN EXPOSITION OF THAT PART OF SCRIPTVRE out of which
Domestical Duties are raised.
EPHESIANS. 5. 21. Submit your selves one to another in the fear of God.
. 1. Of the Apostles transition from general duties to particulars.
AS there are two vocations whereunto it has pleased God to call every one;
one General, by virtue whereof certain common duties which are to be
performed of all men, are required, (as knowledge, faith, obedience,
repentance, love, mercy, justice, truth, etc.) the other Particular, by virtue
whereof certain peculiar duties are required of several persons, according to
those distinct places wherein the Divine Providence has set them in
Commonwealth, Church, or family; so ought Gods Ministers to be careful in
instructing Gods people in both kinds of duties; both those which concern
their general, and those also which concern their particular calling.
Accordingly S. Paul (who, as Number. 12. 7.
Moses, was faithful in all the house of God) after he had sufficiently
instructed Gods Church in such general duties, as belong to all Christians, of
what sex, state, degree, or condition soever they be, proceeds to lay down
certain particular duties, which appertain to particular callings and
conditions: among which, he makes choice of those which God has established
in a family. With excellent Art does he pass from those generals, to these
particulars: laying down a transition betwixt them, in these words, Submitting
your selves one to another in the fear of God; which words have reference both
to that which goes before, and also to that which follows after. The form
and manner of setting down this verse, with a participle thus, submitting,
shows that it depends on that which went before, and so has reference
thereunto. Again, the word it self being the very same which is used (...),
submitting. (...), submit.
in the next verse following, shows, that this verse contains the sum of
that which follows, and so has reference thereunto, as a general unto
particulars. This manner of passing from one point to another, by a perfect
transition which looks both ways, both to that which is past, and to that
which comes on, as it is very elegant, so is it frequent with this our
Apostle. Whereby he teaches us, Note.
so to give heed to that which follows, as we forget not that which is past:
as we must give diligent attention to that which remains, so we must well
retain that which we have heard, and not let it slip: otherwise, if (as one
nail drives out another) one precept makes another to be forgotten, it will
be altogether in vain to add line unto line, or precept unto precept.

. 2. Of joining service to men with our praising of God.
As this verse has reference to that which was delivered before, concerning
our duty to God, it teaches us this lesson:

It is the duty of Christians as to set forth the praise of God, so to be
serviceable one to another. For this purpose in the Doct.
Decalogue to the first table, which prescribes that duty which we owe to God,
is added the second table, which declares the service that we owe one to
another: and he that said, Matt. 22. 38, 39.
The first and great Commandment is this, Thou shall love the Lord, etc. said
also, The second is like to this, Thou shall love thy neighbor, etc. whereupon
the Heb. 13. 15, 16.
Apostle declaring what those sacrifices be wherewith God is well pleased,
joins these two together, to give thanks to God, and to do good to man. The
service which in the fear of God we perform one to another, is an evident and
real demonstration of the respect we bear unto God. Psalm. 16. 2.
To God our goodness extends not. Job 22. 3. and 35. 7.
He is so high above us, so perfect and complete in himself, that neither can
we give to him, nor he receive of us. But in his own stead he has placed our
brother like to our selves; to whom, Job 35. 8.
as we may do hurt, so by our faithful service we may do much Psalm. 16. 3.
good: in doing whereof God is much honored.

This discovers their hypocrisy, who make great pretense 1. Use. A note of
hypocrisy.
of praising God, and yet are scornful, and disdainful to their brethren, and
slothful to do any service to man: These men's religion is vain. By this note
did the Prophets Iam. 1. 26. Isa. 58. 3 etc. Mic. 6. 6. etc. Matt. 23. 14. 1
Ioh. 4. 20.
in their time, and Christ and his Apostles in their time also, discover the
hypocrisy of those among whom they lived: and so may we also in our times. For
many there be, who frequently in their houses, and in the midst of the
Congregation sing praise unto God, and perform other parts of Gods outward
worship, but toward one another, are proud, stout, envious, unmerciful,
unjust, slanderous, and very backward to do any good service. Surely, that
outward service which they pretend to perform to God, does not so much wipe
out the spot of profaneness, as their neglect of duty unto man brandeth their
foreheads with the stamp of hypocrisy. 2. Use. Put not off one duty with
another. Matt. 23. 23.


For our parts, let us not upon pretext of one duty, though it may seem to be
the waightier, think to shift off another; lest that fearful woe which
Christ denounced against the Scribes and Pharisees fall upon our pates. As God
is careful to instruct us how to carry our selves both to his own Majesty,
and also one to another, so let us in both approve our selves to him:
remembering what Christ said to the Pharisees, These ought ye to have done, and
not to leave the other undone. The same Lord that requires praise to his own
Majesty, inioyneth mutual service one to another; the neglect of this, as
well as of that, shows too light respect of his will and pleasure: What
therefore God Matthew. 19. 6.
has joined together, let not man put asunder.

. 3. Of every ones submitting himself to another.
Again, as this verse has reference to that which follows, it declares the
general sum of all, which is mutually to submit our selves one to another in
the fear of God. The parts hereof are two: 1. An Exhortation. 2. A Direction.


In the exhortation is noted, both the duty it self in this word submit, and
also the parties to whom it is to be performed, one to another.

Both branches of the exhortation, viz. the duty, and the parties joined
together, afford this doctrine, that

It is a general mutual duty appertaining to all Christians, 2. Doct.
to submit themselves one to another: For this precept is as general as any of
the former, belonging to all sorts and degrees whatsoever: and so much does
this word one another (...).
imply: in which extent the Apostle in another place exhorts to serve one
another: and again, every man to seek Gal. 5. 13. 1 Cor. 10. 24.
another wealth.

Concerning inferiors, it is without question clear, that Quest.
they ought to submit themselves to their superiors: yea, concerning equals no
great question can be made, but they in giving honor must go one before
another, and so submit Romans 12. 10. How superiors ought to subject themselves.
themselves: but concerning superiors, just question may be made, whether it
be a duty required of them to submit themselves to their inferiors.

To resolve this doubt, we must first distinguish betwixt Answ.
subjection of reverence, and subjection of service.

Subjection of reverence is that whereby one testifies an eminency and
superiority in them whom he reuerenceth, and that in speech, by giving them
titles of honor; or in gesture, by some kind of obeisance; or in action, by a
ready obeying of their commandment. This is proper to inferiors.

Subjection of service is that whereby one in his place is Difference betwixt
subjection of Reverence and Service.
ready to do what good he can to another. This is common to all Christians: a
duty which even superiors owe to inferiors, according to the forenamed
extent of this word one another: in which respect even the highest governor on
earth is called a minister, for the good of such as (...). Romans 13. 4.
are under him.

Secondly, we must put difference betwixt the work it Difference betwixt the
work and manner of doing it.
self, and the manner of doing it. That work which in it self is a work of
superiority and authority, in the manner of doing it may be a work of
submission, viz. if it be done in humility and meekness of mind. The
Magistrate by ruling with meekness and humility, submits himself to his
subject. In this respect the Apostle exhorts that nothing (no not the highest
and greatest works that Phil. 2. 3.
can be) be done in vainglory, but in meekness.

Thirdly, we must distinguish betwixt the several places wherein men are: for
even they who are superiors to some, Every one under some authority. Matthew.
8. 9.
are inferiors to others: as he that said, I have under me, and am under
authority. The master that has servants under him, may be under the
authority of a Magistrate. Yea, God has so disposed every ones several
place, as there is not any one, but in some respect is under another. The wife,
though a mother of children, is under her husband. The husband, though head of
a family, is under public Magistrates. Public Magistrates one under another,
and all under the King. The King himself under God and his word delivered by
his Ambassadors, whereunto the highest are to submit themselves. And Ministers
of the word, as subjects, are under their Kings and Governors. He that says,
Let every soul be subject to the higher powers, Romans 13. 1.
excepteth not Ministers of the word: and he that says, obey them that have
the oversight of you, and submit your selves, Heb. 13. 17. Difference betwixt
Magistrates and Ministers authority.
excepteth not kings: only the difference is in this, that the authority of
the king is in himself, and in his own name he may command obedience to be
performed to himself: but the authority of a Minister is in Christ, and in
Christ's name only may he require obedience to be performed to Christ.

The reason why all are bound to submit themselves one Reason. Every ones
Office for the good of another.
to another is, because every one is set in his place by God, not so much for
himself, as for the good of others: whereupon the Apostle exhorts, that none
seek his own, but every man another wealth. Even Governors are advanced 1
Cor. 10. 24.
to places of dignity and authority, rather for the good of their subjects
then for their own honor. Their callings are in truth offices of service, yea
burdens under which they must willingly put their shoulders, being called of
God, and of which they are to give an account concerning the good which they
have done to others: for the effecting whereof, it is needful that they submit
themselves.

Let every one therefore high and low, rich and poor, 1. Use. Exhortation unto
all to do service.
superior and inferior, Magistrate and subject, Minister and people, husband
and wife, parent and child, master and servant, neighbors and fellows, all
of all sorts in their several places take notice of their duty in this point
of submission, and make conscience to put it in practice: Magistrates, by
procuring the wealth and peace of their people, as Mordecai: Ministers, by
making themselves servants Est. 10. 3.
unto their people, not seeking their own profit, but the 1 Cor. 9. 19. and
10. 33.
profit of many, that they may be saved, as Paul: Fathers, by well educating
their children, and taking heed that they provoke them not to wrath, as David:
Husbands, Prou. 4. 3, 4.
by dwelling with their wives according to knowledge; giving honor to the wife
as to the weaker vessel, as Abraham: Genesis 16. 6.
Masters, by doing that which is just and equal to their servants, as the
Centurion: Every one, by being of like Luke 7. 2.
affection one toward another, and by serving one another in love, according
to the Apostles rule. Let this duty of Romans 12. 16. Gal. 5. 13.
submission be first well learned, and then all other duties will better be
performed.

Be not high minded, nor swell one against another. 2. Use. Dehortation from
swelling one against another.
Though in outward estate some may be higher than other, yet in Christ all are
one whether bond or free: all members of one and the same body. Now consider
the mutual affection (as I may so speak) of the members of a natural body
one toward another: not any one of them will puff it self up, Gal. 3. 28.
and rise against the other: the head which is the highest 1 Cor. 12. 27.
and of greatest honor will submit it self to the feet in performing the
duty of an head, as well as the feet to the head in performing their duty; so
all other parts. Neither is it hereby implied that they which are in place of
dignity and authority should forget or relinquish their place, dignity, or
authority, and become as inferiors under authority, no more than the head
does: for the head in submitting it self does not go upon the ground and
bear the body, as the feet; but it submits it self by directing and
governing the other parts, and that with all the humility, meekness, and
gentleness that it can. So must all superiors: much more must equals and
inferiors learn with humility, and meekness, without scorn or disdain, to
perform their duty: this is that which was before by the Apostle Ephesians. 4. 2.
expressly mentioned, and is here again intimated; none are exempted and
priuileged from it. We know that it is unnatural, and unbeseeming the head to
scorn the feet, and to swell against them, but more than monstrous for one
hand to scorn another: what shall we then say if the feet swel against the
head? Surely such scorn and disdain among the members, would cause not only
great disturbance, but also utter ruin to the body. And can it be otherwise in
a politic body? But on the contrary, when all of all sorts shall (as has
been before showed) willingly submit themselves one to another, the whole
body, and every member thereof will reap good thereby: yea, by this mutual
submission, as we do good, so we shall receive good.

. 4. Of the fear of God.
Hitherto of the exhortation. The direction follows. In the fear of the
Lord. This clause is added, to declare partly the means, how men may be
brought to submit themselves readily one to another: and partly the manner, how
they ought to submit themselves. The fear of the Lord is both the efficient
cause that moves a true Christian willingly to perform all duty to man, and
also the end whereunto he refers every thing that he does. For the better
conceiving whereof, I will briefly declare 1. What this fear of the Lord is.
2. How the Lord is the proper object of it. 3. What is the extent thereof. 4.
Why it is so much urged.


First, fear of God is an awful respect of the divine Majesty. 1. What the
fear of God is. The causes of it.
Sometimes it arises from faith in the mercy and goodness of God: for when
the heart of man has once felt a sweet taste of Gods goodness, and found that
in his favor only all happiness consists, it is stricken with such an
inward awe and reverence, as it would not for any thing displease Two effects
of a filial fear of God.
his Majesty, but rather do whatsoever it may know to be pleasing and
acceptable unto him. For these are two effects which arise from this kind of
fear of God:

1. A careful endeavor to please God, in which respect Deum timere est nulla
mala facere, and nulla bona quae faci enda sunt praete rire. Bernar. de modo
been viuen. ser. 4.
good king Iehosaphat having exhorted his Judges to execute the judgment of
the Lord aright, adds this clause as a motive thereunto, Let the fear of the
Lord be upon you: implying thereby that Gods fear would make them endeavor to
approve themselves to God.

2. A careful avoiding of such things as offend the Majesty of God, and grieve
his spirit: in which respect the Wiseman 2 Chro. 19. 6, 7.
says, The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: and of Job it is Prou. 8. 13.
said that he fearing God departed from evil. Job. 1. 1.


Sometimes again, awe and dread of the divine Majesty arises from
diffidence: For when a man's heart doubts of Gods mercy, and expects nothing
but vengeance, the very thought of God strikes an awe or rather dread into
him, and so makes him fear God.

From this double cause of fear, whereof one is contrary Difference betwixt
filial and servile fear.
to another, has arisen that usual distinction of a filial or sonne-like
fear, and a servile or slavish fear: which distinction is grounded on these
words of the Apostle, ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to
fear (this is Bernard. loc. citat.
a servile fear) but ye have received the spirit of adoption Romans 8. 15.
whereby we cry, Abba, father: this causes a filial fear. The filial fear
is such a fear as dutiful children bear to their fathers. But the servile
fear is such an one as bondslaues bear to their masters. A son fears
simply to offend or displease his father: so as Est timor ne amittatur gratia
beneficij. Hic timor cast us est, non eum charitas eijcit, sed asciscit.
August. epist. 120.
it is accompanied with love. A bondslaue fears nothing but the punishment of
his offense; so as it is joined with hatred: and such an one fears not to
sin, but to burn in hell for sin. Faithful Abraham like a gracious child
feared God (as Gods Angel bears witness, Genesis 22. 12.) when he was ready
rather to sacrifice his only son, then offend God by refusing to Qui gehennas
metuit, non peccare metuit sed ardere. Aug. epist. 144.
obey his commandment. But faithless Adam like a servile bondslaue feared God
(as he himself testifies against himself Genesis 3 10.) when after he had
broken Gods commandment, he hid himself from the presence of God. This
slavish fear is a plain diabolical fear (for the devils Jam. 2. 19.
so fear as they tremble:) It makes men wish there were no hell, no day of
Judgment, no Judge, yea no God. This is that fear without which we must serve
the Lord. In this Luke 1. 74.
fear to submit ones self is nothing acceptable to God: It is therefore the
filial fear which is here meant.

Secondly, of this fear God is the proper object, as by 2. How God is the
proper object of fear.
this and many more testimonies of Scripture is evident, where the fear of God
and of the Lord is mentioned. This fear has so proper a relation unto God, as
the Scripture styles God by a kind of propriety, with this title Fear: for
where Iaakob mentions the fear of Isaak, he means Genesis 31. 42, 53.
the Lord whom Isaak feared.

It is then unlawful to fear any but God? Quest.


No: Men also may be feared, as Princes, Parents, Masters, Ans. How men are to
be feared.
and other superiors; For the Apostle exhorting to give every one their due,
gives this instance, fear, Romans 13. 7.
to whom fear is due. But yet may God notwithstanding be said to be the proper
object of fear, because all the fear that any way is due to any creature, is
due to him in and for the Lord whose image he carries: so as in truth it is
not so much the person of a man, as the image of God placed in him, by virtue
of some authority or dignity appertaining to him, which is to be feared. If
there should fall out any such opposition betwixt God and man, as in fearing
man our fear would be withdrawn from God, then the rule of Christ is to take
place, which is this, fear not them which Matthew. 10. 28.
kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which
is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

Thirdly, the extent of this true filial fear of God is 3. Every duty to be
seasoned with a fear of God.
very large. No one point throughout the whole Scripture is more urged than
this fear of the Lord. It is often added to other duties, as that whereby they
are seasoned, and without which they cannot well be performed: wherefore we are
commanded to serve the Lord in fear, to perfect holiness Psalm. 2. 11.
in the fear of God, to work out our salvation with fear: and 2 Cor. 7. 1.
the Churches are commended for walking in the fear of the Phil. 2. 12.
Acts 9. 31.
Lord: so likewise particular men as a Genesis 22. 12.
Abram, b and 42. 18.
Joseph, c Job 1. 1.
Job, and many other: yea the whole worship of God is often comprised under this
branch of fear: whereupon our Savior Christ alleging this text, thou shall
fear the Lord thy God, Deuteronomy. 6. 13.
thus expresses it, thou shall worship the Lord thy God. And Matthew. 4. 10.
again where the Lord by his Prophet Isay says, Their fear Isa. 29. 13.
toward me is taught by the precept of men, Christ thus quoteth that text, In
vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines Matthew. 15. 9.
the commandments of men: out of which places compared together, it is
evident, that under the fear of God, is comprised the worship of God. Yea, all
that duty which we owe to God and man is comprised under this title, the fear
of God: for David when he would in one word declare the sum and substance of
all that which a Minister ought to teach his people, says, I will teach you
the fear of Psalm. 34. 11.
the Lord. 4. Why a fear of God is so much urged.


Fourthly, The reason why the Holy Ghost so much urges the fear of God, and
that in so large an extent as has been showed, I take to be this; to show a
difference betwixt that integrity and perfection of Gods image which was at
man's creation first planted in him, and the renouation thereof while here he
lives in this world. So complete and perfect was then Gods image in man, as he
needed no other motive to provoke him to any duty but love. Wherefore when the
Holy Ghost would set forth that perfection of Gods image first planted in man,
he adds this title Love unto other duties, whether they concern God or man.
Concerning God, Moses exhorts Israel to love the Deuteronomy. 11. 13.
Lord and serve him: and again, to love the Lord, to walk in Deuteronomy. 30. 16.
his ways, to keep his commandments, etc. Concerning man, the Apostle
exhorts to serve one another by love: and to do Gal. 5. 13.
all things in love. Yea, sometimes the Holy Ghost is pleased 1 Cor. 16. 14.
to comprise all duties under love: In which respect Christ calls this
commandment (Thou shall love the Lord) the Matthew. 22. 38.
great commandment, which compriseth all the commandments of the first table
under it: and for the second table, S. Paul says, that love is the fulfilling
of the law. But by Adams Romans 13. 10.
fall, and the corruption which thereby infected man's nature, the love of God
has waxed cold in man, and though the Saints be created again according to
that image of God, yet while in this world they live, that image is not so
perfect as it was, the flesh remains in the best: in which respect God has
fast fixed this affection of fear in man's heart, and thereby both restrains
him from sin, and also provoke him unto every good duty.

. 5. Of the fear of God moving us to do service to men.
Having briefly declared the nature, object, extent, and use of fear, I
return to the point in hand, viz. to show 1. how it is here laid down as a
motive to stir up men to perform the duty here required: for by this
clause, in the fear of the Lord, the Apostle implies that

It is the fear of God which moves men conscionably to submit Doct.
themselves one to another. This made 2. Sam. 23. 3.
David so well to rule the people of God: and Genesis 42. 18.
Joseph to deal so well with his brethren: yea, Isa. 11. 2, 3.
this is noted to be the cause of the righteous regiment of Christ himself.
Well did that good King Iehosaphat know this, and therefore when he appointed
Judges over his people, as a motive to stir them up to execute the judgments
of the Lord aright, he says unto them, Let the fear of the Lord be upon you.
So also S. Peter, 2 Chronicles. 19. 7.
to move subjects to honor their King, prefixeth this exhortation, Fear God.
1 Pet. 2. 17.


By fear of man, may one be brought to submit himself Object.
to another: as a magistrate may be moved to deal justly and mildly with his
people through fear of insurrections and rebellions: subjects may by severe
laws and tyranny be brought to submit themselves: and so other inferiors
also by threats, by hard usage, and other by-respects.

1. Though fear of man be a motive, yet it follows Answ.
not, that therefore fear of God should be no motive: it may be another
motive, and a better motive.

2. The submission which is performed through fear of Difference betwixt doing
a thing for fear of God and fear of man.
man is a forced and a slavish submission, nothing acceptable to God: but that
which is performed through a true filial fear of God, is a free, willing,
ready, cheerful, conscionable submission: such a submission as will stir us
up to do the best good we can thereby unto them, to whom we submit our selves,
and so is more acceptable to God, by reason of the cause thereof, and more
profitable unto man, by reason of the effect and fruit thereof.

For a true fear of God makes us more respect what Reason. The power of a
fear of God.
God requires and commands, than what our corrupt heart desires and
suggesteth: It subdueth our unruly passions, and brings them within compass
of duty: It makes us deny our selves and our own desires: and though through
the corruption of our nature and inborne pride we be loath to submit, yet will
Gods fear bring down that proud mind, and make us humble and gentle. It will
keep those who are in authority from tyranny, cruelty, and overmuch
severity: and it will keep those who are under subjection from dissimulation,
deceit, and privy conspiracies.

Behold how necessary it is, that a true fear of the Lord Use. The necessity
of a fear of God.
be planted in men's hearts, in the hearts of Kings and all Governors, in the
hearts of subjects and all people, whether superiors or inferiors. Where no
fear of God is, there will be no good submission unto man. Abraham Genesis 20. 11.
thought that the men of Gerar would have no respect to him or his wife, nor
make conscience of common honesty, nor abstain from innocent blood, because
he saw no fear of God in that place: and the Apostle having reckoned up Romans
3. 11, etc.
many notorious effects of man's natural corruption, concludes all with this,
as the cause of all, There is no fear of God before their eyes. Wherefore let
Magistrates, Parents, Masters, and all in authority, have especial care that
their subjects, children, servants, and all under them may be taught and
brought to fear the Lord. I dare avouch it, that such inferiors which are
taught to fear God, will do better seruiee to their superiors, than such as
fear their superiors only as men, and fear not God. Let Ministers especially
urge and press upon the consciences of men a fear of God. Let all inferiors
pray that the fear of the Lord may be planted in the hearts of their
superiors, that so they may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness
and honesty under them. Happy is that kingdom where Magistrates and subjects
fear the Lord. Happy is that Church where Ministers and people fear the
Lord. Happy is that family where husband and wife, parents and children,
master and servants fear the Lord. In such a Kingdom, Church, and family,
will every one, to the mutual good one of another, submit themselves one to
another. But if such as fear not God submit themselves, whether they be
superiors or inferiors, it is for their own ends and advantages, and not for
their good to whom they submit themselves.

. 6. Of limiting all duty to man, within the compass of the fear of God.
Again, as this clause (In the fear of the Lord) declares the manner of
submission, it shows, that

No submission is to be performed unto man, but that which Doct.
may stand with the fear of God. Whereby we show that we have respect to God,
and labor above all to approve our selves to him. Thus David is commanded to
rule in the 2 Samuel 23. 3.
fear of God: and other Magistrates to perform their duty 2 Chro. 19 9.
in the fear of the Lord: which Nehemiah that good Governor Neh. 5. 15.
was careful to do. So also subjects are to obey in the fear of the Lord,
which the Apostle implies by prefixing 1 Pet. 2. 17.
this precept, Fear God, before that, Honor the King; as if he had said, so
honor the King, as in and thereby you may manifest your fear of God: let not
this latter cross the former. Servants likewise are commanded to be obedient
unto their Masters with this prouiso, fearing the Lord. Such Coloss. 3. 22.
phrases as these, For the Lords sake, As unto the Lord, In the 1 Pet. 2. 13.
Lord, As servants of Christ, with the like, being annexed to Ephesians. 5. 22. and
6. 1, 6.
the duties of inferiors, do imply as much.

Great reason there is that all service should be limited 1. Reason. God the
highest Lord.
with the fear of God: for God is the highest Lord to whom all service
primarily and principally is due: whatsoever service is due to any man, high or
low, is due in and for the Lord. The Lord has set superiors in the places of
eminency, wherein they bear the image of God. The Lord also has set
inferiors in their places, and commended them as his charge to the government
of those who are over them. He that obeys not those who are over him in the
fear of God, shows no respect of Gods image: and he who governs not those
who are under him in the fear of God, shows no respect of Gods charge.

Besides, God is that great Judge to whom all of all sorts, 2. Reason. God the
Judge of all.
superiors and inferiors are to give an account of their service. Though by
our service we have never so well approved our selves to men, yet if we have
not therein had respect unto God, and approved our selves to him, with what
face may we appear before his dreadful judgment seat? 1. Use. The folly of
all those who fear man more than God.
Can the favor of those whom we have pleased in this world, protect and
shelter us from the fury of Gods displeasure?

Behold the folly of such Governors as wholly apply themselves to the fancy
of their people, yea though it be against the Lord and his word. This was Adams
folly, who Genesis 3. 6.
at his wives motion did eat of the forbidden fruit. This was Aarons folly, who
to please the people, erected an Exodus 32. 1.
Idol. And this was Saul's folly, who against Gods express 1 Samuel 15. 21.
prohibition suffered his people to take some of the spoil of the Amalekites.
The like may be said of Ioash, who 2 Chro. 24 7.
hearkened to his Princes to set up Idols: and of Pilate, who Mark 15. 15.
to please the people, against his conscience, delivered Christ to be
crucified. The fearful issue of this their submission, not seasoned with a
fear of God, but contrary thereunto, may be a warning to all superiors, to
take heed how they seek to please them that are under them, more than God who
is above them. The issue of Adams, Aarons, Saul's, and Ioash his base
submission, is noted by the Holy Ghost in their several histories. Of Pilate
it is recorded, that being Euscb. hist. Eccl. lib 2. cap. 7.
brought into extreme necessity, he laid violent hands upon himself.

Neither is it to be accounted folly only in superiors to submit themselves to
their inferiors against the Lord, but also in inferiors to their superiors:
for thereby they show that they fear man more than God, which Christ expressly
Luke 12. 4, 5.
forbids his friends to do. The captains which went 2 King. 1. 9, etc.
to fetch Eliah, obeyed their king therein; but what got they thereby? was the
king able to save them from the fire which God sent down from heaven upon
them? The women Ier. 44. 19.
reproved for offering incense to the Queen of heaven, did it not without
their husbands, yet were they not excused thereby. The children and others in
the family Numb. 16. 32.
submitted themselves to Dathan and Abiram in standing in the door of their
tents at defiance against Moses; but because it was not in the Lord, but
against him, they were not exempted from the judgment. Wherefore let all of
all sorts set the fear of God as a mark before them to aim at in all their
actions. Let superiors Numb. 11. 29.
neither do any thing to give content to their inferiors: 1 Samuel 24. 8. and
26. 9.
nor suffer any thing to be done for their sakes by their inferiors, which
cannot stand with the fear of God. And let inferiors Genesis 39. 10.
nor do, 1 Samuel 22. 17.
Act. 4. 19.
nor forbear to do at the will of their superiors any thing sweruing from
the fear of God: but every one submit themselves one to another in the fear
of God.

. 7. Of performing the duties of particular callings.
EPHESIANS. 5. 22. Wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as unto the
Lord.


FRom that general direction concerning mutual submission, the Apostle
comes to certain particulars, by which he exemplifieth the same: and
teaches us, that

It is not sufficient to perform general duties of Christianity, Doct.
unless also we be conscionable in performing the particular duties of our
several callings. A conscionable performance of those particular duties is one
part of our Ephesians. 4. 1.
walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called: and therefore the
Apostle, for illustration and exemplification thereof, does reckon up sundry
particulars, both in this and Col. 3. 18, etc. 1 Cor. 7. 1 Timothy 3.
other Epistles: and so do 1 Pet. 2. and 3.
other Apostles. And Tit. 2.
Titus is charged to teach them. God himself has given a pattern hereof in
his Law: for the maine scope of the fifth Commandment See more of this point
in The whole armor of God, Treat. 2. part 1.. 4.
tends to instruct us in the particular duties of our several callings.

Hereby much credit is brought to our profession, and the Tit. 2. 10. 1 Pet. 3.
1, 2.
doctrine of God our Savior is adorned. And much good is hereby both mutually
communicated one to another, and received one from another: for our particular
places and callings are those bonds whereby persons are firmly and fitly knit
together, as the members of a natural body by nerves, arteries, sinews,
veins, and the like, by which life, sense and motion is communicated from one
to another.

Let therefore notice be taken of the particular callings Use.
wherein God has set us, and of the several duties of those callings, and
conscience be used in the practice of them. He is no good Christian that is
careless herein. A bad husband, wife, parent, child, master, servant,
magistrate or minister, is no good Christian.

. 8. Of the lawfulness of private functions in a family.
Among other particular callings the Apostle makes choice of those which God
has settled in private families, and is accurat in reciting the several and
distinct orders thereof, (for a family consists of these three orders,
Husbands, Parents, Masters, all which he Wives, Children, Servants, reckons
up) yea he is also copious, and earnest in urging the duties which appertain
to them. Whence we may well infer, that

The private vocations of a family, and functions appertaining 2 Doctr. Private
duties of the family well beseem any Christian. (...). Arist. Polit. lib. 1
thereto, are such as Christians are called unto by God, and in the exercising
whereof, they may and must employ some part of their time. For can we think
that the Holy Ghost (who, as the Philosophers speak of nature, does nothing in
vain) would so distinctly set down these private duties, and so forcibly urge
them, if they did not well become, and nearly concern Christians? All the
places in Scripture which require family duties, are proofs of the truth of
this doctrine.

The reasons of this doctrine are clear; for the family is Reason. The family
a seminary.
a seminary of the Church and commonwealth. It is as a Bee-hive, in which is
the stock, and out of which are sent many swarms of Bees: for in families are
all sorts of people bred and brought up: and out of families are they sent into
the Church and commonwealth. The first beginning of mankind, and of his
increase, was out of a family. For first did God join in marriage Adam and Eve,
made them husband and wife, and then gave them children: so as husband and
wife, parent and child, (which are parts of a family) were before magistrate
and subject, minister and people, which are the parts of a Commonwealth, and a
Church. When by the general deluge all public societies were destroyed, a
family, even the family of Noah, was preserved, and out of it kingdoms and
nations again raised. That great people of the Jews which could not be
numbered for multitude, was raised out of the family of Abram. Yea even to this
day have all sorts of people come from families, and so shall to the end of the
world. Whence it follows, that a conscionable performance of domestical and
household duties, tend to the good ordering of Church and commonwealth, as
being means to fit and prepare men thereunto.

Besides, a family is a little Church, and a little commonwealth, 2 Reason. A
family is a representation of Church and commonwealth.
at least a lively representation thereof, whereby trial may be made of such
as are fit for any place of authority, or of subjection in Church or
commonwealth. Or rather it is as a school wherein the first principles and
grounds of government and subjection are learned: whereby men are fitted to
greater matters in Church or commonwealth. Whereupon the 1. Tim. 3. 5.
Apostle declares, that a Bishop that cannot rule his own house, is not fit to
govern the Church. So we may say of inferiors that cannot be subject in a
family; they will hardly be brought to yield such subjection as they ought in
Church or commonwealth: instance Absalom, and Adoniah, David's sons.

This is to be noted for satisfaction of certain weak 1 Use. Private callings
in a family sufficient callings.
consciences, who think that if they have no public calling, they have no
calling at all; and thereupon gather that all their time is spent without a
calling. Which consequence if it were good and sound, what comfort in spending
their time should most women have, who are not admitted to any public function
in Church or commonwealth? or servants, children, and others who are wholly
employed in private affairs of the family? But the forenamed doctrine shows
the unsoundness of that consequence. Besides, who knows not that the
preservation of families tends to the good of Church and commonwealth? so as
a conscionable performance of household duties, in regard of the end and fruit
thereof, may be accounted a public work. Yea, if domestical duties be well
and thoroughly performed, they will be even enough to take up a man's whole time.
If a master of a family be also an husband of a wife, and a father of children,
he shall find work enough: as by those particular duties, which we shall
afterward show to belong unto masters, husbands, and parents, may easily be
proved. So a wife likewise, if she also be a mother and a mistress, and
faithfully endeavor to do what by virtue of those callings she is bound to
do, shall find enough to do. As for children under the government of their
parents, and servants in a family, their whole calling is to be obedient to
their parents and masters, and to do what they command them in the Lord.
Wherefore if they who have no public calling, be so much the more diligent in
the functions of their private callings, they shall be as well accepted of the
Lord, as if they had public offices.

Yet many therebe, who having no public employment, think they may spend
their time as they list, either in idleness, 2 Use. Reproof of such as having
no public office, think themselves freed from all duty.
or in following their vain pleasures and delights day after day, and so cast
themselves out of all calling. Such are many masters of families who commit all
the care of their house either to their wives, or to some servant, and mispend
their whole time in idleness, riotousnesse, and voluptuousness. Such are many
mistresses, who spend their time in lying a bed, attiring themselves, and
goshipping. Such are many young gentlemen living in their fathers houses, who
partly through the too-much-indulgencie and negligence of their parents, and
partly through their own headstrong affections, and rebellious will, run
without restraint whither their corrupt lusts lead them. These, and such other
like to these, though by Gods providence they be placed in callings, in
warrantable callings, and in such callings as minister unto them matter enough
of employment, yet make themselves to be of no calling. Now what blessing can
they look for from the Lord? The Lord uses Gods blessing on men diligent in
their calling.
to give his blessing to men, while they are busied in their callings. Genesis 31.
42.
Iaacobs faithful service to his uncle Laban moved God to bless him. Genesis 39.
2.
Joseph's faithfulness to his master Potiphar was had in remembrance with God,
who advanced him to be ruler in Egypt. Exo. 3. 1, 2.
Moses was keeping his father in laws sheep when God appeared to him in the
bush, and appointed him a Prince over his people. 1 Samuel 16. 11
David was sent for from the field, where he was keeping his fathers sheep,
when he was anointed to be king over Israel. 1 King. 19. 19.
Elisha was plowing when he was anointed to be a Prophet. Luke 2. 8.
The shepherds were watching their sheep, when that gladsome tidings was
brought to them, that the Savior of the world was borne. Not to insist on any
more particulars, the promise of Gods protection is restrained to our callings:
for Psalm. 91. 11.
the charge which God has given to the Angels concerning man is, to keep him
in all his ways.

As for those who have public offices in Church or 3. Use. Public callings
may not hinder private duties.
commonwealth, they may not thereupon think themselves exempted from all
family duties. These private duties are necessary duties. Though a man be a
magistrate or a minister, yet if he be an husband, or a father, or a master, he
may not neglect his wife, children, and servants. Indeed they who are freed
from public functions, are bound to attend so much the more upon the private
duties of their families, because they have more leisure thereunto. But none
ought wholly to neglect them. Ios. 24. 15.
Iosuah, who was a Captain and Prince of his people, and very much employed in
public affairs, yet neglected not his family: for he professes that he and
his house would serve the Lord. It seems that 1 Samuel 2. 29. and 3. 13.
Eli was negligent in performing the duty of a father, and 1 King. 1. 6.
David also. But what followed thereupon? Two of Elies sons proved
sacrilegious, and lewd Priests. Two of David's sons proved very ill
commonwealths-men, even plain traitors.

. 9. Of the Apostles order in laying down the duties of husbands and wives in
the first place.
There being three especial degrees, or orders in a family, Why duties of man
and wife first delivered.
(as we heard before) the Apostle places husband and wife in the first rank,
and first declares their duties, and that not without good reason: for

First, The husband and wife were the first couple that 1. Man and wife were
the first couple.
ever were in the world. Adam and Eve were joined in marriage, and made man and
wife before they had children, or servants. So falls it out for the most part
even to this day in erecting, or bringing together a family: the first couple
is ordinarily an husband and a wife.

Secondly, most usually the husband and his wife are the 2. Man and wife are
commonly the chiefest in a family.
chiefest in a family, all under them single persons: they governors of all
the rest in the house. Therefore most meet it is, that they should first know
their duty, and learn to practice it, that so they may be an example to all
the rest. If they fail in their duty one to another, they give occasion to
all the rest under them to be careless, and negligent in theirs. Let an
husband be churlish to his wife, and despise her, he ministers an occasion to
children and servants to contemn her likewise, and to be disobedient unto her:
yea, to be churlish and froward one to another, especially to their underlings.
Let a wife be untrusty and unfaithful to her husband, let her filch and
purloine from him, children and servants will soon take courage, or rather
boldness from her example privily to steal what they can from their father,
and master. Thus is their breach of Bis peccat qui exemplo peccat.
duty a double fault: one in respect of the party whom they wrong, and to whom
they deny duty: the other in respect of those to whom they give occasion of
sinning.

Know therefore, O husbands and wives, that ye, above Use.
all other in the family, are most bound unto a conscionable performance of
your duty. Greater will your condemnation be, if you fail therein. Look to
it above the rest: and by your example draw on your children and servants (if
you have any) to perform their duties: which surely they will more readily do,
when they shall behold you as guides going before them, and making conscience
of your joint and several duties.

. 10. Of the Apostles order in setting down inferiors duties in the first
place. Wives particular duties first laid down, because they are inferiors.

In handling the duties of the first forenamed couple, the Apostle begins
with wives, and lays down their particular duties in the first place. The
reason of this order I take to be the inferiority of the wife to her husband. I
do the rather take it so to be, because I observe this to be his usual method
and order, first to declare the duties of inferiors, and then of superiors:
For in handling the duties of Ephesians. 6. 1.
children and parents, and of Ephesians. 6. 5.
servants and masters, he begins with the inferiors, both in this, and Col.
3. 18, 20, 22.
in other Epistles; which order also 1 Pet. 3. 1.
S. Peter observes: yea, Exodus 20. 12.
the law it self does in the first place, and that expressly, mention the
inferiors duty, only implying the superiors to follow as a just consequence,
which is this, If the inferior must give honor, and by virtue thereof
perform such duties as appertain thereto, then must the superior carry
himself worthy of honor, and by virtue thereof perform answerable duties.

Quest. Why should inferiors duties be more fully Inferiors duties first
taught, because they are most backward and loath to perform them.
expressed, and placed in the first rank?
Answ. Surely because for the most part inferiors are most unwilling to
undergo the duties of their place. Who is not more ready to rule, than to be
subject?

I deny not but that it is a far more difficult and hard matter to govern
well than to obey well. For to rule and Greater difficulty in ruling well,
than in obeying.
govern requires more knowledge, experience, wisdom, care, watchfulness,
diligence, and other like virtues, than to obey and be subject. He that obeys
has his rule laid before him, which is the will and command of his Ducem velim
qui a front pariter, and tergo sit oculatus. Timoth. apud Plutarch.
superior in things lawful, and not against Gods will. But the superior who
commands, is to consider not only what is lawful, but also what is most fit,
meet, convenient, and every way the best: yea also he must forecast for the
time to come, and so far as he can observe whether that which is now for the
present meet enough, may not be dangerous for the time to come, and in that
respect unmeet to be urged. Whence it follows, that the superior in
authority may sin in commanding that which the inferior in subjection may
upon his command do without sin. Who can justly charge Ioab with sin in
numbering the 2 Samuel 24. 2, etc.
people, when David urged him by virtue of his authority See Treat. 7.. 37.
so to do? Yet did David sin in commanding it. Without all question Saul did
sin in charging the people by an oath, to eat no food the day that they pursued
their enemies (a time when they had most need to be refreshed with food, as
Ionathans words implie) and yet did not the people 1 Samuel 14. 24. etc.
sin in forbearing: witness the event that followed on Ionathans eating,
though he knew not his fathers charge. Who sees not hereby, that it is a
matter of much more difficulty to rule well, than to obey? which is yet
further evident by Gods wise disposing providence in ordering who should
govern, who obey. Commonly the younger Seniores and inter eos optimos, and
prudentes and potentes oportet imperare. Iuniores vero parere. Plat. de rep.
lib 3.
for age, the weaker for sex, the meaner for estate, the more ignorant for
understanding, with the like, are in places of subjection: but the elder,
stronger, wealthier, wiser, and such like persons, are for the most part, or at
least should be in place of authority. Woe to thee o land ( Eccl. 10. 16.
says Solomon) when thy king is a child. And Isa. 3. 4.
Isaiah denounces it as a curse to Israel, that children shall be their
Princes, and babes shall rule over them, and complains Isa. 3. 12.
that women had rule over the people.

Now to return to the point, though it be so that governors have the heauiest
burden laid on their shoulders, yet inferiors that are under subjection think
their burden the heauiest, and are lothest to bear it, and most willing to
cast it away. For naturally there is in every one much Ambition is it which
makes inferiors loath to be subject.
pride and ambition, which as dust cast on the eyes of their understanding,
puts out the sight thereof, and so makes them affect superiority, and
authority over others, and to be stubborn under the yoke of subjection: which
is the cause that in all ages, both by divine, and also by humane laws,
penalties and punishments of diverse kinds have been ordained, to keep
inferiors in compass of their duty: and yet (such is the pride of man's
heart) all will not serve. What age, what place ever was there, which has 2.
Inferiors duties first delivered, to teach them how to win their governors
favor.
not just cause to complain of subjects rebellion, servants stubbornness,
childrens disobedience, wives presumption? Not without cause therefore does the
Apostle first declare the duties of inferiors.

Besides, the Apostle would hereby teach those who are under authority, how to
move them that are in authority over them, to deal equally and kindly, not
hardly and cruelly with them, namely, by endeavoring to perform their own
duty first. For what is it that provoke wrath, rage, and fury in governors?
What makes them that have authority, to deal roughly, and rigorously? is it
not for the most part disobedience, and stoutnesse in those that are under
government? though some in authority be so proud, so savage, and inhumane, as
no honor done to them, no performance of duty can satisfy and content them,
but they will (as Psalm. 38. 20.
David's enemies) reward evil for goodness, yet the best general direction
that can be prescribed to inferiors, to provoke their governors to deal well
with them, is, that inferiors themselves be careful and conscionable in doing
their duty first. If their governors on earth be nothing moved therewith, yet
will the highest Lord in heaven graciously accept it.

Lastly, men must first learn to obey well, before they 3. By obeying, men
learn to rule well. Parendo disces imperare. Arist. Polit. lib. 3. c. 3. Use.
can rule well: for they who scorn to be subject to their governors while
they are under authority, are like to prove intolerably insolent when they are
in authority.

Learn all that are under authority, how to win your governors favor: how to
make your yoke easy, and your burden light: how to prevent many mischiefs
which by reason of the power of your superiors over you may otherwise fall
upon you: First do ye your duty.

There are many weighty reasons to move governors Reasons why governors ought
first to perform their duties.
first to begin to do their duty. For,

First, by virtue of their authority they bear Gods image, therefore in doing
their duty they honor that image.

Secondly, by reason of their place they ought to go before such as are under
them.

Thirdly, a faithful performance of their duty, is an especial means to keep
their inferiors in compass of theirs.

Fourthly, their failing in duty is exemplary: it causes others under them to
fail in theirs, and so it is a double sin.

Fifthly, their reckoning shall be the greater: for of them who have received
more, more shall be required.

It were therefore to be wished that superiors and inferiors would strive who
should begin first, and who should Vterque suum praeoccupet officium. Chrysostom.
hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
perform their own part best, and in this kind strive to excel, as runners
in a race strive in running to outstrip one another.

But if question be made who shall begin, I advise inferiors not to stand
out in this strife, but to think the Apostle Reasons why inferiors ought
first to perform their duties.
first inciteth them: and that it is the safest for them to begin: for in this
contention inferiors are like to fare the worst, by reason of the power which
superiors have over them. And though it be more against our corrupt, proud,
and stout nature, to be subject and obey, yet let us so much the more endeavor
to yield duty in this kind. For it is an especial part of spiritual
prudence, to observe what our corrupt nature is most prone unto, and wherein it
most swells up, that therein we may most strive to beat it down: nature is
contrary to grace, and the Romans 8. 7.
wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God.

. 11. Of the reasons why wives duties are first taught.
Quest. Why among other inferiors are wives first brought into the school of
Christ to learn their duty?
Answ. Many good reasons may be given of the Apostles order even in this point.

First, of all other inferiors in a family, wives are far the most
excellent, and therefore to be placed in the first rank.

Secondly, wives were the first to whom subjection was enjoined: before there
was child or servant in the world, it was said to her, thy desire shall be
subject to thine husband. Genesis 3. 16.


Thirdly, wives are the fountain from whence all other degrees spring: and
therefore ought first to be cleansed.

Fourthly, this subjection is a good pattern unto children and servants: and a
great means to move them to be subject.

Fifthly, I may further add as a truth, which is too manifest by experience in
all places, that among all other parties of whom the Holy Ghost requires
subjection, wives for the most part are See Treat. 3.. 4.
most back ward in yielding subjection to their husbands. But ye wives that
fear God, be careful of your duty: and though it may seem somewhat contrary
to Exodus 23. 2.
the common course and practice of wives, yet follow not a multitude to do
evil. Though it be harsh to corrupt nature, Si propter Deum viro parueris,
noli proponere quae ab eo fieri deceant, sed ea quibus te legislator secit
obnoxiam diligenter exequere. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11.
yet beat down that corruption: yea though your husbands be backward in their
duties, yet be ye forward, and strive to go before them in yours: remembering
what the Lord says (Mat. 5. 46, 47.) If you love them which love you, what
singular thing do ye? Yea remembering also what the Apostle says, (1 Timothy 2.
14.) The woman was first in the transgression, Genesis 3. 16.
and first had her duty given unto her, and 1 Cor. 11. 9.
was made for the man, and not man for the woman.

Thus shall ye deserve that commendation of good wives, Prou. 31. 29.
Many have done virtuously, but ye excel them all.

Having hitherto handled the forenamed general instructions, I will proceed to
a more distinct opening of the words; and collect such observations as thence
arise, and then particularly declare the several duties which the three orders
in a family owe each to other.

. 12. Of wives subjection.
EPHESIANS. 5. 22. Wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as unto the
Lord.
THe (...).
word by which the Apostle has noted out the duties of wives, is of the middle
voice, and may be translated passiuely as Subditae sint. Hieron. Vet. Trans.
Erasm.
many have done, or Subijcite vos. Beza.
actiuely as our English does (submit your selves) and that most fitly: for
there is a double subjection.

1. A necessary subjection: which is the subjection of order.

2. A Voluntary subjection: which is the subjection of duty. The necessary
subjection is that degree of inferioritie, wherein God has placed all
inferiors, and whereby he has subjected them to their superiors, that is,
set them in a lower rank. By virtue thereof, though inferiors seek to exalt
themselves above their superiors, yet are they subject unto them, their
ambition does not take away that order which God has established. A wife is in
an inferior degree, though she domineere never so much over her husband.

The Uoluntary subjection, is that dutiful respect which inferiors carry
toward those whom God has set over them: whereby they manifest a willingness
to yield to that order which God has established. Because God has placed them
under their superiors, they will in all duty manifest that subjection which
their place requires.

Because it is a duty which is here required, the Voluntary subjection must
needs be here meant: and to express so much, it is thus set down, submit your
selves.

Though the same word be here used that was in the former verse, yet it is
restrained to a narrower compass, namely to See. 3.
subjection of reverence.

Here learn that to necessary subjection, must voluntary subjection 1. Obser.
be added: that is, duty must be performed according to that order and degree
wherein God has set us. This is to make a virtue of necessity.

Under this phrase (submit your selves) all the duties which a wife owes to
her husband are comprised, as I shall Treat. 3.. 2.
afterward more distinctly show.

. 13. Of the persons to whom wives must be subject.
In setting down the parties to whom wives owe subjection, the Apostle notes
a particle of restraint ( (...).
own) and that to show that a wife ought to have but one husband, which is
more plainly expressed in another place by the same phrase, let every woman
have her own husband: that 1 Cor. 7. 2. (...). See. 82, 83.
is, only one proper to her self: so as

It is unlawful for a wife to have more than one husband at once.

A wife must submit her self only to that one, proper 2. Obser.
husband, and to no other man (as she is a wife and yields the duty of a
wife) so as the subjection of adulteresses is here excluded: and the duty
required is, that

A wife must yield a chaste, faithful, matrimonial subjection 3. Obser.
to her husband.

Here by the way note the foolish Adamiani ex Adam dicti, cuius imitantur in
paradiso nuditatem. Nuptias auersantur. Nudi itaque mares foeminaeque
conueniunt, etc. August. de Haeres. distinct. 31. Promiscue inter se viri and
foeminae, Veneri operam dabant. Philast.
collection of Adamites, Familists, and such like licentious libertines, who
from the general words which the Apostle uses (men (...).
and women) infer that all women are as wives to all men, and that there
needs not any such near conjunction of one man with one woman. Which beastly
opinion as it is contrary to the current of Scripture, and to the ancient law
of marriage (two shall be one flesh) so also to this clause (their own
husbands.) The Apostle, in using those general words, followed the Greek
phrase, which puts those two words (men women) for husbands and wives: so
also do other tongues, yea and our English. The particular relation, which is
betwixt the persons who are meant by those two words, does plainly show how
they are to be taken, and when they are to be restrained to man and wife. To
take away that ambiguity, our English has well translated them, husband and
wife.

To direct and provoke wives unto their duty, the Apostle adds this clause
(as unto the Lord) which is both a Rule and a Reason of wives subjection. It
directs wives by noting the restraint of their obedience, and the manner
thereof.

The restraint in that wives ought so to obey their husbands 4. Obser. See
Treat. 3.. 51.
as withal they obey the Lord; but no further: they may not be subject in any
thing to their husbands, that cannot stand with their subjection to the Lord.

The manner in that wives ought to yield such a kind of subjection 5. Obser.
See Treat. 3.. 54.
to their husbands, as may be approved of the Lord.

Thus the Apostle himself expounds this phrase, chap. 5. verse. 5, 6.

It provoke wives to submit themselves to their husbands, by noting the place
of an husband, which is, to be in the Lords stead, bearing his image, and in
that respect having a fellowship and partnership with the Lord, so as

Wives in subiecting themselves aright to their husbands are subject to the
Lord. And on the contrary side, 6. Obser.


Wives in refusing to be subject to their husbands, refuse to be subject to the
Lord. 7. Obser. See Treat. 3.. 70.


. 14. How an husband is his wives head.
EPHESIANS. 5. 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the Church: and he is the Savior of the body.
THe place of an husband intimated in the last clause of the former verse, is
more plainly expressed, and fully explained in this verse. His place is
expressed under the metaphor of an head: and amplified by his resemblance
therein unto Christ.

The particle of connection (FOR) shows that this verse is added as a reason:
which may fitly be referred both to the duty it self: and to the manner of
performing it.

The metaphor of an head enforces the duty.

The amplification thereof by the resemblance that is made to Christ, enforces
the manner of performing the duty.

A wife must submit her self to an husband, because he is her head: and she
must do it as to the Lord, because her husband is to her, as Christ is to the
Church.

The metaphor of an head declares two points:

1. The dignity of an husband. 2. The duty

1. As an head is more eminent and excellent than the body, and placed above
it, so is an husband to his wife.

2. As an head, by the understanding which is in it, governs, protecteth,
preserves, provides for the body, so does the husband his wife: at least he
ought so to do: for this is his office and duty: this is here noted to show
the benefit which a wife receives by her husband: so as two motives are
included under this metaphor.

The first is taken from the husbands prerogative, whence note that

Subjection must be yielded to such as are over us. For this is a maine end of
the difference between party and party. Obser.
To what end is the head set above the body, if the body be not subject to it?

The second is taken from the benefit which a wife reapeth by her husbands
superiority: and it shows that

They who will not submit themselves to their superiors are Obser. See Treat.
3.. 73.
injurious to themselves: as the body were injurious to it self, if it would
not be subject to the head.

. 15. Of the resemblance of an husband to Christ.
The more to enforce the forenamed reason, the Apostle adds the resemblance
that is betwixt an husband and Christ, as this note of comparison ( (...).
even as) shows: whence it follows that

It is as meet for a wife to submit her self to her husband, as Obser.
for the Church to submit it self to Christ. This amplification is especially
added for Christians. Heathens may be moved to subject themselves to their
governors, by the resemblance taken from a natural body. How much more ought
Christians to be moved by the resemblance taken from the mystical body of
Christ?

These words (and he is the Savior of the body) as they do declare the office
of Christ, and the benefit which the Church reapeth, so they note the end why
an husband is appointed to be the head of his wife, namely that by his
provident care he may be as a savior to her. It is here noted rather to show
the benefit which a wife reapeth by her husband, then the duty which he owes:
for that the Apostle declares afterward, verse. 25, etc. The meaning then is,
That as Christ was given to be an head of the Church which is his body, that he
might protect it, and provide all needful things for it, and so be a Savior
to it, even so How an husband is a Savior to his wife See Treat. 3.. 73.
for that very end are husbands appointed to be the head of their wives.

Upon this ground the Apostle infers the conclusion in the next verse.

. 16. Of the resemblance betwixt The Church to Christ. A wife to her husband.

EPHESIANS. 5. 24 Therefore as the Church is subject to Christ, so let wives be to
their own husbands in every thing.
THis conclusion sets forth not only the duty it self, but also another
Reason, and another Rule to provoke and direct wives to perform their duty:
and that under the pattern of the Church.

The reason may be thus framed, That which the Church does to Christ, a wife
must do to her husband. But the Church is subject to Christ. Therefore a wife
must be subject to her husband.

The proposition is grounded on that resemblance which is betwixt the Church in
relation to Christ, and a wife in relation to her husband: for an husband is
that to his wife, which Christ is to the Church; therefore a wife must be so to
her husband, as the Church is to Christ.

The rule notes both the Manner ( (...).
as) and also the Extent of a wives subjection ( (...).
in every thing.) See more of the manner and extent of a wives obedience,
Treat. 3.. 51. and 63.


Quest. Is mortal and sinful man to be obeyed as the Lord Christ the eternal
Son of God?
Answ. This extent is to be restrained to the generality of the things in
question. As in other places, where the Apostle says, all things are lawful
for me, he means all 1 Cor. 10. 23.
indifferent things, for of them his speech was in that place. And where again
he says, Whatsoever is set before you, eat, Verse. 27.
he means, whatsoever good and wholesome meat: for of that he spoke.

Thus much of the maine drift of the Apostle in setting before wives the
example of Christ, to whom husbands are like in dignity, and the example of
the Church, to whom wives ought to be like in duty.

I will further consider these examples of Christ and the Church more
distinctly by themselves, without any relation to man and wife: and out of them
note such general instructions as concern all Christians.

. 17. Of the relation betwixt Christ and the Church.
EPHESIANS. 5. 23, 24. 23. Christ is the head of the Church: and he is the Savior
of the body. 24. The Church is subject unto Christ in every thing.
BEhold here the mutual relation betwixt Christ, the Church.

Wherein note concerning Christ, 1. His pre-eminence over the Church, (he is
her head.) 2. His goodness to her, (he is her Savior.)


Note also concerning the Church, 1. Her prerogative, (she is the body of
Christ.) 2. Her duty. In laying down whereof there is noted,
1. Wherein it consists (The Church is subject to Christ) 2. How far it
extends, (in every thing.)


The title Head, is given to Christ in two respects.

1. In regard of his Col. 1. 18.
dignity and dominion over the Church.

2. In regard of the Ephesians. 4. 15, 16.
near union betwixt him and the Church.

This union is more fully expressed afterward, verse. 30.

The dignity of Christ is here principally intended: so as Christ is the
highest in authority over the Church: the titles Doctr.
1 Cor. 8. 6.
Lord, Mat. 23. 7, 8, 9.
Father, Master, Doctor, Deuteronomy. 18. 15.
Prophet, Col. 1. 18.
Firstborn, with the like, being by a kind of excellency and propriety
attributed to him, prove as much.

The causes hereof are

1. The good pleasure of God his Father. 2. The dignity of his person being
God-Man. 3. The merit of his sacrifice whereby he has redeemed and purchased
his Church unto himself. 4. The omnipotency of his power whereby he is able
to protect it. 5. The all-sufficiencie of spirit, whereby he is able to give to
every member all needful grace.
Till the Pope of Rome can show so good reason for this 1 Use.
title (Supreme head of the whole Church) we will account him a blasphemous
usurper thereof.

Object. He is not accounted an Imperial head as Christ is, The distinction
betwixt imperial and ministerial head discussed.
but only a Ministerial head.

Answ.

1. This distinction is without all ground or warrant of Scripture.

2. It implies plain contradiction. For to be a ministerial head, is to be
an head and a minister, which is all one as an head and a member in relation to
the same thing.

3. Though in these two words (Imperial, Ministerial) they may seem to
advance Christ above the Pope, yet in their own interpretation of these words
they make the Pope equal Staplet. lib. 6. cap. 16. de princip. doct.
to Christ, if not advance him above Christ. For they say that Christ is an
imperial head to quicken the Church inwardly: and the Pope a ministerial head
to govern it outwardly. First let it be noted, how little congruitie this
exposition has with the words expounded. Does this word (imperial) intimate a
quickening virtue? Does this word (ministerial) implie a governing power? Nay,
is there not great incongruitie in this, that Christ should be the Imperial
head, and yet the Pope an head to govern? Besides, does not this rend asunder
two of Christ's offices, and leaving one to Christ, give another to the Pope,
and so make him equal with Christ? If the particular branches of this
government which is given by papists unto the Pope by virtue of his headship be
observed, we shall find that to be verified in him, which the Apostle has
foretold concerning Antichrist, that as God he sits in the temple of 2 Thessalonians. 2. 4.
God, showing himself that he is God. For they give to him the keys of heaven
and hell, to shut or open the one or other as In Decretal.
pleases him: they give him power to dispense with Gods laws, to coin
articles of faith, to make laws to bind men's consciences directly and
immediately, to give pardon for sin, to free subjects from allegiance to their
Sovereigns, to canonize Saints, and what not? But to let these impious
blaspliemies pass, beside that this prerogative of Christ (to be head of Ephesians.
1. 21, 22, 23
the Church) is incommunicable (for thereby the Apostle proves Christ to be
advanced far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and
every name, etc.) Christ needs not for the execution of his office therein
any Vicar, or Deputy: for as head he fills all in all things: and by his
eternal spirit is he in heaven, earth, and every place where any of his
members are, according to his Mat. 18. 20. and 28. 20.
promises made unto his Church.

Much comfort and great confidence must this needs minister Use.
to all such as have assurance that they are of this body: for having so
mighty, so wise, so merciful an head, an head so sufficient every way, who
can instruct, direct, guide, govern, protect, and help them in all their
needs whatsoever, what need they fear? When we are assaulted by Satan, or any
way set upon by any of his instruments, or are in any distress or need, let us
lift up the eyes of our faith higher then we can the eyes of our body, and in
heaven behold this our head, who is invisible, and we cannot but receive from
thence much comfort, and encouragement.

. 18. Of the benefit of Christ's headship.
The Goodness of Christ is set down in these words (and he is the Savior of
the body) Every word almost has his emphasis.

1. The copulative particle (AND) shows that

The goodness which Christ does for his Church, he does because (...) 1. Obser.
he is the head thereof.

O how happy a thing is it for the Church that it has such an head! an head
that does not tyrannize over it, nor trample it under foot: an head that does
not pole, or peele the Church: but procures peace and safety to it. When
Naomi sought to make a match betwixt Boaz and Ruth, that he might be her Ruth
3. 1.
head, what says she? Shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with
thee? It is therefore the office of an head to be a Savior, to procure rest
and prosperity to the body whose head it is.

Happy were it for Kingdoms, Commonwealths, Cities, Churches, Families,
wives, and all that have heads, if they were such heads: that, because they are
heads, they would endeavor to be Saviors.

. 19. Of Christ a sufficient Savior.
In laying forth the goodness of Christ three things are noted.

1. The Kind of goodness, which is Salvation (the Savior) 2. The person that
performs it (he himself.) 3. The parties for whom he performs it (the
body.)
1. The Greek word translated (...). Sotera instrip tum vidi Syracusis. hoc
quantum est? Ita magnum, vt Latino vno verbo exprimi non possit. Is est nimirum
soter, qui salutem dedit. Cicer. in Ver. act 4.
Savior is so emphaticall that other tongues can hardly find a fit word to
express the emphasis thereof: it being attributed to Christ, implies that

Christ is a most absolute and perfect Savior, he is every way a sufficient
Savior: Heb. 7. 25. (...). Mat. 1. 21.
able perfectly to save even to the very uttermost. He saves Soul and Body:
he saves from all manner of misery: which is intimated by that particular
from Doct.
which he saves, namely sin: he shall save his people from their sins.
Sin is the greatest, and most grievous evil; yea, the cause of all misery:
they who are saved from it, are saved from all evil: for there is nothing
hurtful to man, but that which is caused by sin, or poisoned by it.

Before sin seized on man he was most happy, free from all misery: and so
shall he be after the contagion, guilt, punishment, dominion, and remainder of
sin is removed. But he that remains in the bondage of sin is in a most
woeful plight. In that Christ saves from sin, he saves from the wrath of
God, the curse of the law, the venom of all outward crosses, the tyranie of
Satan, the sting of Death, the power of the grave, the torments of hell, and
what not?

The purity of Christ's nature, and excellency of his person Reason.
is it that makes him so sufficient a Savior: which reason the Apostle
himself notes: for where he says that Christ is able to save to the
uttermost, he adds, for proof thereof, that he Heb. 7. 25, 26.
is Holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher then the
heavens.

Great matter of rejoicing, and of confidence does this minister Uses.
Consolation. Luke 2. 10, 11. Luk 1. 47.
unto us. When the Angel first brought this news, To you is borne a Savior,
he says, Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy. This made the Virgin
Mary say, My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, and for this did Zacharias
bless God that redeemed his people, and raised up an horn of salvation. Verse.
68, 69.
When the eyes of old Simeon had seen this Salvation, he desired no longer to
live, but said, Lord now let thou thy servant Luke 2. 29, 30.
depart in peace.

They who believe in this Savior will be of like mind: and as they rejoice in
him, so they will trust unto him, and say with the Apostle, we are more then
conquerors through him Romans 8. 37.
that loved us, etc.

This being so, to what end serves the supposed treasure of Refut.
the Church, wherein are said to be stored up indulgences, pardons, merits,
works of supererogation, and I know not what trash, to add to the
satisfaction of this Savior? either Christ is not a sufficient Savior, or
these are (to speak the least) vain. But vain they are: and an empty,
filthy, detestable treasure that is, which God will destroy with all that
trust therein.

. 20. Of Christ the only Savior.
This relative particle ( (...).
HE) has also his emphasis; for as it points out Christ the head of the
Church, so it restrains this great work to him: it may thus be translated,
he himself: that is, he in his own person, he by himself, he and none but
he. So as to speak properly,

Christ is the only Savior of men: in which respect he is Doct.
called Luke 1. 69.
the horn of salvation, yea and 2. 30.
Salvation it self: which titles are given to him by an excellency and
propriety: and in the same respect the name Mat. 1. 21.
Jesus was given unto him.

Here by the way note the blasphemous arrogancy of those great sectaries among
the Papists, who style themselves Jesuits: assuming that name which is proper
to this great office of Jesus Christ.

Object. Why is this name more blasphemous, then the title Christians?
Answ. One of their own religion does thus resolve that Objection: We are
called Christians of Christ, not Jesuits of Jesus, because we partake of the
thing signified by the name Christ, that is anointing: for (as the Apostle
says) we all receive of his fullness. But he has not communicated to us the
thing signified by the name Jesus; for it belongs to him alone to save, as
says the scripture, he shall save his people: as if he should say, he alone,
and no other. A Christo dicimur Jesuit a blasphemous title.
Christiani, non autem a Jesus Iesuani, seu Iesuitae: quia rem signatam nomine
Christus, scil. vnctionem nobis communicauit. Nam, ut ait Apostolus, omnes nos
de plenitudine eius accepimus: sed rem significatam nomine Jesus Why we may be
called Christians and not Jesuits.
non communicauit: nam saluare ipsi soli conuenit: ipse enim (vt dicitur in
scriptura) saluum faciet Christus commune dignitatis est nomen. Jesus proprium
vocabulum saluatoris. Hier. in Mat. 16.
populum suum: ac si diceret, ipse solus, and non alius. Guil. Lindwood in
Prouinc. sieve Constitut. Angl. lib. de Consuetud.

But to return to our matter, Saint Peter does most plainly and fully prove
the forenamed doctrine in these words spoken of Jesus Christ, Act. 4. 12.
There is not salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven
given among men whereby we must be saved. None is able, Reu. 5. 4, 5.
none is worthy to work so great 1. Use.
a work: he must do it, or it can not be done. But Isa. 63. 3.
he is so See The whole Armor of God, Treat. 1. part 1. 5.
able, and so worthy as he can do it of himself, and needs none to assist
him.

What a dotage is it to trust to other Saviors? Legions of Virum multi
salutares dici possint non facile audendum est. Solus enim ipse saluator
corporis est. Aug. in Ios. lib. 6. quaest. 23.
Saviors have Papists to whom they fly in their need. All the Angels in
heaven, and all, whom at any time their Popes have canonized for Saints (which
are many millions) are made Saviors by them. Ier. 2. 12, 13.
Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this: for they have committed two evils: they
have forsaken Christ the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out
cisternes, broken cisterns that can hold no water.

Let us for our parts fly unto this Savior only, and wholly 2. Use.
rely upon him, as we desire to be saved. Thus shall we honor him by
preferring him before all: yea by rejecting all but him: and thus shall we be
sure to bring help, ease and comfort to our own souls.

. 21. Of the Church the body of Christ.
The persons who receive any benefit by this Savior, are all comprised under
this metaphor the body: whereby the samething is meant that was meant before
by the Church.

Church according to the notation of the Greek word signifies (...). Ecclesia
ex vocatione appellata est. Aug. in Epist. ad Romans
an assembly called together. It is in Scripture by a propriety attributed to
them who are called to God.

This calling is twofold:

1. Outward, which is common to all that make profession Mat. 20. 16.
of the Gospel: in this respect it is said, many are called and few chosen.

2. Inward, which is proper to the elect, none but they, and all they in their
time shall both outwardly be called by the word to a profession of Christ, and
also inwardly and effectually by the spirit to believe in Christ, and obey his
Gospel. This is styled Heb. 3. 1.
an heavenly calling, which is 1 Cor. 1. 2.
proper to the Saints. These make that Church, whereof Christ is properly the
head: and therefore in relation to that metaphor of an head, they are called
the Body: and that in these respects;

1. They are under Christ, as a body under the head. 2. They receive spiritual
life and grace from Christ, as a body natural receives sense, and vigor from
the head. 3. Christ governs them, as an head the body. 4. They are subject to
Christ, as a body to the head.
. 22. Of the extent of Christ's goodness to all his body.
This metaphor, by which the persons that reap the benefit of Christ's office
are set forth, notes two points.

1. All that are once incorporated into Christ shall be saved. The body
compriseth all the parts and members under it: not only arms, shoulders,
breast, back, and such like: but also hands, fingers, feet, toes, and all.
Christ their head being their Savior, who can doubt of their salvation?

2. None but those that are incorporated into Christ shall be saved. For this
privilege is appropriated to the body.

The former point is clearly set forth by a resemblance, which the Apostle
makes betwixt Adam and Christ, thus: As by the offense of one, judgment came
on all men to condemnation, Romans 5. 18.
even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came on all men unto
justification of life. Here are noted two roots, one is Adam, the other is
Christ: both of them have their number of branches, to all which they convey
that which is in them, as the root conueyeth the sap that is in it, into all
the branches that sprout from it. The first root, which is Adam, conueyeth
sin and death to all that come from him: and the other root, which is Christ,
conueyeth grace and life to every one that is given to him: for says he, All
that the Father Ioh. 6. 37.
gives me, shall come to me: and him that comes to me, I will in no wise
cast out: and a little after, he renders this reason, This is the Fathers
will, that of all which he has given me Verse. 39.
I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.

Object. Christ himself makes exception of one, where he says, none is lost
but the son of perdition. Ioh. 17. 12.

Answ. That phrase son of perdition, shows that Judas was never of this
body: for can we imagine that Christ is a Savior of a son of perdition?

Object. Why is he then excepted?
Answ. By reason of his office and calling he seemed to be of this body, and
till he was made known, none could otherwise judge of him, in which respect
Saint Peter says, he was Act. 1. 17.
numbered with us.

2. Answ. Christ there speaks in particular of the twelve Apostles, and to be
an Apostle of Christ was in it self but an outward calling.

This is a point of admirable comfort to such as have assurance Use.
of their incorporation into Christ, they may rest upon the benefit of this
office of Christ, that he is a Savior. We need not think of climing up to
heaven, and searching Gods records to see if our names be written in the book
of Life. Let us only make trial whether we be of this body or no. How we may
know whethe we be of Christ's body or no.
For our help herein, know we that this metaphor of a body implies two
things. 1. A mystical union with Christ. 2. A spiritual communion with the
Saints.


1. By virtue of that union they who are of Christ's body, 1. Ephesians. 4. 15, 16.
Receive grace, and life from him. 2. Ioh. 17. 6.
Are guided and governed according to his will. 3. Joh. 17. 10
Seek to honor him in all things they do. 4. Gal. 3. 1. Psalm. 116. 136.
Are offended and grieved when he is dishonored by others.
2. By reason of their communion with the Saints being fellow members, 1. 1
Ioh. 4. 11.
They love the brethren. 2. Mat. 25. 40.
They are ready to succor such as are in distress. 3. Ephesians. 4. 16.
They will edify one another. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 26.
They retain a mutual sympathy: rejoicing, and mourning one with another.

. 23. Of the restraint of the benefit of Christ's headship to them only that are
of his body.
That none but those who are of Christ's body, shall partake of the benefit of
his office, is clear by other like titles of restraint, as Mat. 1. 21.
his people, and Ioh. 10. 15.
his sheep: but especially by denying to the world the benefit of his
intercession. Ioh. 17. 9.
I pray not for the world, says he. In this respect this position (out of the
Church no salvation) is without exception true: for the body is the true,
Catholic, invisible Church: he that is not a member of this Church, but is out
of it, has not Christ to be his head Ecclesia corpus Christi est: vnde
manifestum est, eum qui non est in membris Christi Christianam salutem habere
non posse. Aug. de Unit. Ec l. c. 2.
and Savior, whence then can he have salvation?

The former point is not more comfortable to those that have assurance that
they are members of this body, then this is terrible to those that give too
great evidence they are no members thereof; as all they do that have not the
spirit of Christ ruling in them, but rather rebel against him: and bear no
love to the Saints, but rather hate them, and do them all the spite they can.

. 24. Of the Churches subjection to Christ.
EPHESIANS. 5. 24. The Church is subject unto Christ in every thing.
THe duty which the Church in way of thankfulness performs to Christ her
head for this great benefit, that he is her Savior, is Subjection: Under which
word is comprised all that obedience and duty, which in any kind Christ
requires of the Church, in and by the word.

Quest. Is it possible for that part of the Church which is here on earth, to
yield such obedience?
Answ. It will faithfully endeavor to do what it can: and that honest and
utmost endeavor Christ graciously accepts for a perfect performance of all.

In that it is here taken for grant, that the Church is subject to Christ; I
may, as from a general to particular, infer that

Whosoever is of the true Catholic Church is subject to Christ, and yields
obedience to his word. We will run after thee, Doctr.
says the Church to Christ. My sheep hear my voice and follow Cant. 1. 3.
me, says Christ of that flock, which is his Church. John 10. 27.


For Christ conueyeth his own spirit into his mystical body the Church, and
into every member thereof: which spirit is Reason.
much more operative, and lively then the soul of man. If therefore man's soul
quickening every part of the natural body, make them subject to the head, much
more will the spirit of Christ bring the members of his mystical body in
subjection to himself. If the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead
dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, Romans 8. 11.
shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by the spirit that dwells in you.

Hereby let trial be made of particular visible Churches and of particular
persons, whether they are in deed of this true Catholic Use. Trial of true
Churches.
Church or no. Those visible Churches which refuse to be governed by Christ's
word, and are wholly governed by humane traditions, which rise against Christ
and play the adulteresses by committing Idolatry, are not of this Catholic
Church which is subject to Christ. No more are Infidels that defy Christ,
Heretics that deny him, ignorant persons that know not his will, profane
persons that despise him, wordlings that lightly esteem him, nor any that
persecute or scorn him in his members. By this we may see that many have a
name that they are of the Church, who in deed are not.

Object. Many such persons may belong to Gods election, and so be of that body
whereof Christ is a Savior.

Answ. Election in deed gives them a title to Christ, but they cannot reap
any benefit by that title till they have a possession of Christ by virtue of
their spiritual union with him. Neither can they have any assurance of their
election, till they find by the quickening virtue of the spirit, that they are
united unto Christ. Wherefore so long as men remain destitute of the Spirit of
Christ, and are possessed with a contrary spirit, they may well be judged for
the present to be none of this body, nor to have any part in Christ, their
future estate being referred to him who only knows what it shall be.

. 25. Of the extent of the Churches subjection.
The extent of the Churches subjection to Christ is without any restraint at
all, in every thing. For there is nothing which Christ requires of her, but
she may with a good conscience, and must in obedience yield unto. Just, and
pure, and perfect are all his commandments, there is no error in any of them:
no mischief or inconvenience can follow upon the keeping of them. This extent
being here taken for grant, I may further infer that

They who are of the true Catholic Church will yield universal Doctr.
obedience to Christ: they will obey him in all and every of his commandments.
David turned not aside from any thing that 1 Kings 15. 5.
the Lord commanded him. Josiah turned to the Lord with all his 2 Kings 23. 25.
Luke 1. 6.
heart according to all the law: and Zacharias, and Elizabeth, walked in all
the commandments of God. All these were of this Church: and of their mind are
all others that are of this Church.

For the spirit of Christ which is in them works a through Reason.
reformation: even as the flesh leads a natural man on to every sin, so
the spirit of Christ stirs him up to every good duty. In which respect it is
said, that whosoever is borne of God 1 John 3. 9.
does not commit sin.

Object. The best Saints in all ages have transgressed in many Iam. 3. 2.
things.
Answ. Their sins though grievous, have not wilfully in open rebellion
against Christ been committed, but they have slipped from them partly through
their own weakness, and partly through the violence of some temptation. So as
that which the Apostle says of himself, may be applied to all that are of the
body of Christ, That which I do I allow not: Now then Romans 7. 15. 17.
is it no more I that do it, but the sin that dwells in me.

This extent is a good proof of the truth of subjection, for Use. Trial of
integrity.
herein lies a maine difference betwixt the upright, and the hypocrite; yea
betwixt restraining and renewing grace. That restraining grace which is in many
hypocrites stirs them to do many things which Christ commands, if at
least they cross not their honor, profit, ease, and the like. Herod that
notorious hypocrite did many things. None that bears the Mark. 6. 20.
name of the Church, but will be subject in somethings. But none but the
upright, who are indeed renewed by the sanctifying spirit of Christ, will in
all things make Christ's will their rule, and in every thing hold close to it,
preferring it before their pleasure, profit, preferment, or any other outward
allurement. They who so do, give good evidence that they are of the body of
Christ, and may rest upon it, that Christ is their Savior.

. 26. Of the sum of Husbands duties.
EPHESIANS. 5. 25. 25. Husbands love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the
Church, and gave himself for it.
FRom Wives duties the Apostle proceeds to press Husbands duties. And as he
propounded to Wives for a pattern, the example of the Church, so to Husbands
he propounds the example of Christ: and Uers. 28, 29.
adds thereunto the pattern of a man's self, in regard of that natural
affection which he bears to his body. Thus he adds pattern to pattern,
Husbands duties most pressed.
and does the more largely and earnestly press them, because husbands having a
more honorable place, their failing in duty is the more heinous, scandalous,
and dangerous.

The Apostle restrains the duties of Husbands to their (...).
own Wives, as he did the duties of Wives to their (...).
own Husbands. For though the same word be not here used which was before, yet
a word of like emphasis is used: and as good reason there is that our English
translators should have put in this particle (own) in this verse, as in the
22. verse, for proof whereof read 1 Cor. 7. 2. Where (...). See. 82.
these two words are used, and both of them translated own.

This I have the rather noted, because many who hold that a Wife must have but
one Husband, conceit that a Husband may have more Wives then one: which conceit
this particle (own) wipeth away. All the duties of an Husband are comprised
under this one word See the reasons hereof Treat. 4.. 2.
Love. Wherein that an Husband might be the better directed, and whereto that
he might be the rather provoked, the forenamed example of Christ, and of his
love to the Church, is very lively set forth: first generally in these words,
even as Christ loved the Church: and then more particularly in the words
following.

. 27. Of the example of Christ's love.
The note of comparison ( (...).
Even as) requires no equality, as if it were possible for an Husband in that
measure to love his wife, as Christ loved his Church; (for as Christ in
excellency and greatness exceeds man, so in love and tenderness) But it
notes an equity, and like quality.

An equity, because there is as great reason that Husbands by virtue of their
place should love their Wives, as that Christ by virtue of his place should
love the Church.

A like quality, because the love which Christ bears to the Church is every
way without exception: and a love which turns to the good and benefit of the
Church. Hence note two points.

1. Husbands must come as near as they can to Christ in loving their wives. In
which respect, because they can never love so much as Christ did, they must
never think they have loved enough.

2. Though their love in measure cannot equal Christ's love, yet in the manner
thereof it must be like Christ's, a preventing, true, free, pure, exceeding,
constant love.

The measure and manner of Christ's love is distinctly noted, Treat. 4.. 61.
etc. and the love which an husband owes his wife paralleld and applied thereto,
which application may be also made of that Christian mutual love which we owe
one to another.

The love of Christ to the Church is amplified, 1. By an Effect thereof, in
these words, He gave himself for it. 2. By the End of that effect, largely set
down, verse 26, 27.


The effect is noted partly as a Confirmation of the truth of Christ's love.
Declaration of the measure

The Act (he gave) shows that his love was in deed and truth: not only in
show and pretense.

The Object (himself) shows that he loved his Church more then his own
life. A greater evidence of love could not be given: for greater love has no
man then this, that a man John 15. 13.
lay down his life for his friend.

The end of Christ's love (set forth verse. 26, 27.) is noted to show that he so
loved his Church for her good and happiness, rather then for any advantage to
himself.

As this example of Christ's love to his Church is set before husbands: so it
may and ought also to be applied to all Christians: and that in a double
respect.

1. As a motive to stir them up to love both Christ himself, and also their
brethren.

2. As a pattern to teach them how to love.

A motive it is to love Christ, because love deserves love: especially such a
love, of such a person as the love of Christ is. Yea, our love of Christ is an
evidence that we are loved of Christ, as smoke is a sign of fire. Wherefore
both in thankfulness to Christ, for his love to us, and for assurance to our
own souls of Christ's love to us, we ought in all things that we can to
testify our love to Christ.

A motive it is also to love our brethren, because Christ being in heaven, our
Psalm. 16. 2.
goodness extends not to him: but our brethren on earth stand in his stead,
and the love we show to them, we show to him; and he accepts it as done to
him: Matthew. 25. 35, 40.
Ye fed me, ye visited me, says Christ to them that fed and visited his
brethren. This love also, even the 1 John 4. 20.
love of our brethren, is an evidence that we are loved of God. Wherefore and
verse. 11.
if Christ so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

How the love of Christ is a pattern, I will Treat 4. 61. etc.
afterward show.

. 28. Of Christ's giving himself.
EPHESIANS. 5. 25. And gave himself for it.
THis fruit and effect of Christ's love extends it self to all Christ
himself, and all that he did and suffered, are ours.
the things that Christ did or suffered for our redemption: as, that he
descended from heaven, took upon him our nature, and became a man; that he
subjected himself to the law, and perfectly fulfilled it; that he made
himself subject to many temptations of the devil and his instruments; that he
took upon him our infirmities; that he became a King to govern us, a Prophet
to instruct us, a Priest to make an atonement for us: that he subjected
himself to death, the cursed death of the cross, and so made himself an
oblation and sacrifice for our sins; that he was buried; that he rose again;
that he ascended into heaven, and there sits at Gods right hand to make
intercession for us. For after that Christ had taken upon him to be our head
and Savior, he wholly set himself apart for our use, and our benefit: so as
his person, his offices, his actions, his sufferings, his humiliation, his
exaltation, the dignity, the purity, the efficacy of all is the Churches,
and to her good do they all tend. This in general is the extent of this fruit
of Christ's love, he gave himself for it.

More particularly, we may note these three points: 1. The action, what he did,
(he gave.) 2. The object, what he gave, (himself.) 3. The end, why he gave
himself, (for it) for the Churches good.


The action having relation to the object, most especially points at the
death of Christ. The (...).
Greek word is a compound word, and signifies to give up. It implies two
things,

1. That Christ willingly died: the simple word (gave) intimates so much.

2. That his death was an oblation: that is, a price of redemption, or a
satisfaction: the compound word (gave up) intimates so much.

. 29. Of the willingness of Christ to die.
That Christ willingly died is evident by the circumstances noted about his
death: when Peter counseled him to spare himself, and not to go to Jerusalem
(where he was to be put to death) Mat. 16. 32, 23
he called him Satan, and said, he was an offense to him: when Judas went out
to betray him, John 13. 27.
he said unto him, That thou do, do quickly: and 18. 2. etc. Audiui,
Domine, auditum tuu^ et expani, dum quaeris a quaerentibus quid quaerant, cum
noueris quod te quaerant: and dixisti te esse lesum Nazarenu^. Cypr. de Pass.
Christi.
When Judas was gone out to get company to apprehend him, he went to the place
where he was wont, so as Judas might readily find him; yea, he met them in the
midway that came to take him; and he asked them whom they sought, though he
knew whom they sought: and when they said, Jesus of Nazaret, he answered, I am
he: When they came to him, he drove them all backward with a word of his mouth,
and yet would not escape from them: Matthew. 26. 53.
He could have prayed to the Father to have had more then twelve legions of
Angels for his safeguard against those that apprehended him, but would not: and
27. 42.
when by his adversaries he was provoked to have come down from the Cross,
and could have done so, he would not. Mark. 15. 39.
At the instant of giving up the ghost, he cried with a loud voice: which
shows that his life was not then spent, he might have retained it longer if
he would: and thereupon the Centurion gathered that he was the Son of God.
John 2. 19. Matthew. 28. 6.
When he was actually dead, and laid in a grave, he rose again. These and
other like circumstances verify that which Christ said of himself, John 10.
18. Indicia dedit nullase necessita e, sed obedientia vrgeri ad mortem. Cypr.
de coen. Dom. Reason.
No man takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my self. It was
therefore no necessity that compelled him to die, but his voluntary obedience.

Christ is Acts 3. 15. (...).
the Lord, Prince and Author of life, and has an absolute power as over the
life of others, so over his own life.

Thus then we see that his sacrifice was a voluntary and free gift: the cause
thereof was his own will and good pleasure.

Exceedingly does this commend the love of Christ: and assures us that it is
the more acceptable to God, who loves a cheerful giver. 1. Use.


Let us in imitation of our head, do the things whereunto 2 Cor. 9. 7.
we are called willingly and cheerfully, though they seem never 2. Use.
so disgraceful to the world, or grievous to our weak flesh.

. 30. Of the kind of Christ's death, an oblation.
That Christ's death was an oblation, and a price of redemption, is evident by
the death of those beasts which were offered up for a sacrifice, and therein
were a type of Christ's death. But expressly is this noted by this Apostle, where
he says, Ephesians. 5. 2.
Christ has given himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a
sweet smelling savor: and again, 1 Timothy 2. 6.
Christ gave himself a ransom. The phrases of 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19
redeeming, Acts 20. 28.
purchaesing, 2 Pet. 2. 1.
buying, with the like, attributed to Christ and his blood, do further
confirm the same.

Learn hereby to consider Christ's death, not as the death of Use.
a private man, but of a public person, of a suertie, of a pledge, that in our
room and stead 2 Cor. 5. 21.
was made sin, and Gal. 3. 13.
was made a curse to redeem us from our sins, and from the curse which by
sin was fallen upon us. The comfort and benefit of Christ's death is lost, if
this be not known and believed. In this consists a maine difference betwixt
the death of Christ, and all other men, not the most righteous Martyrs
excepted. Their death was but a duty, and debt: no satisfactory oblation, no
price, no ransom, as Christ's was.

. 31. Of the infinite value of the prince of our redemption.
The Object, or thing which Christ gave for a ransom was himself, not his
body alone, nor his body and soul only, but his person consisting of his two
natures, humane, and divine.

Quest. How could his divine nature be given up? could it How the person of
Christ being Godman, was given for us.
suffer? could it die?
Answ. 1. The Deity simply considered in and by it self, could not die: but
that person which was God, both could and did die. For the Son of God
assuming an humane nature into the unity of his divine nature, and uniting them
together (...). Symbol. Calced.
without confusion, alteration, distraction, separation, in one person, that
which is done by one nature is done by the person, and in that respect the
Scripture often attributes it to the other nature: as where it is said, 1 Cor.
2. 8.
They crucified the Lord of glory: and Act. 20. 28.
God purchased the Churchwith his own blood.

2. Though the divine nature of Christ suffered not, yet did it support the
humane nature, and add dignity, worth and efficacy to the sufferings of that
nature.

3. Christ's divine nature had proper and peculiar works in the work of
redemption, as to sanctify his humane nature, to take away our sins, to
reconcile us to God, and the like.

Thus then in three respects the whole person of Christ was given unto us.

1. In regard of the inseparable union of both natures.

2. In regard of the assistance of the Deity in those things which the humane
nature of Christ did.

3. In regard of some proper actions appertaining to the Deity. Doctr.


In that the person of Christ God-Man was given up, I gather that 1 Pet. 1. 19.
Uses.


The price of our Redemption is of infinite value. Nor Christ, Quanta se
fiducia spes credentium consolatur considerans quantus quanta pro nondum
credentibus passus sit? Aug. de Doctr. Chr. l. 1. c. 15.
nor God himself could give a greater. Heaven and earth and all things in them
are not of like worth. Well therefore might Saint Peter call it precious blood:
and prefer it before silver, gold, and all other things of price.

1. What place can be left for despair in those that know and believe the
worth of this ransom?

2. What can be held too dear for him, that notwithstanding the infinite
excellency of his person gave himself for us? can goods, can friends, can
children, can liberty, can life, can any thing else?

3. What just cause have we to give up our selves a living sacrifice, Romans 12.
1.
holy and acceptable to him that gave himself for us?

4. How ungrateful, how unworthy of Christ are they, that for his sake will
not forsake their unstable honors, fading wealth, vain pleasures, garish
attire, and such like trash?

. 32. Of Christ's seeking the good of the Church.
The End why Christ gave himself was, for the Church: so Doctr.
as Christ in his death aimed at our good. 2 Cor. 5. 21.
He was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
him: Gal. 3. 13.
he was made a curse for us, and has redeemed us from the curse of the Law:
Gal. 1. 4.
he gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us: Ioh. 10. 15.
he laid down his life for the sheep.

This proves Christ's giving of himself to be a fruit of his love: for 1. Cor.
13. 5. 1. Use.
Love seeks not her own.

Learn we hereby to apply all that Christ did to our selves. If for us he gave
himself, he, and See. 28. 2. Use.
all appertaining to him is ours.

Learn we also hereby how to manifest love: namely by seeking, and procuring
the good of others. Let no man seek his 1 Cor. 10. 24.
own, but every man another wealth. If this were practiced, would there be
such oppressing, such undermining, such deceiving, such wronging of one another
as there is? Too truly is the Apostles complaint verified in our days, All
seek their Phil. 2. 21.
own. But let that mind be in us which was in Christ Jesus, and thus manifest
our love, as we desire to partake of this fruit of Christ's love.

From hence by just consequence it follows that Christ merited Christ merited
not for himself.
not for himself. Was there any need that Christ should come down from heaven
on earth, to purchase any thing for himself? When he was going out of the
world, thus he prayed, Now, O Father, glorify thou me with the glory which I
had Ioh. 17. 5.
with thee before the world was. Did Christ by any thing which he did on earth
merit that glory which he had before the world was? All the exaltation
whereunto he was advanced even in his human nature, was due to the dignity of
his person.

1. Object. He endured the cross, for the joy which was set Heb. 12. 2.
before him.
Answ. He used that joy which of right was due to him as an help to support
him in the weakness of his humane nature, not as a recompense which he should
deserve.

2. Object. He became obedient to the death of the Cross, Phil. 2. 9. (...).
WHEREFORE God also has highly exalted him.
Answ. That particle (wherefore) does not declare the cause, but the order of
his exaltation: nothing a consequence that followed after his death. After he
had humbled himself so low, he was most highly advanced.

3. Object. Christ being man was bound to the Law: and therefore for himself
he ought to fulfill it.
Answ. If he had been mere man, that were true. But he uniting his humane
nature unto his divine, and making of both one person, which person was God as
well as man, he was bound to nothing further then it pleased him voluntarily to
subject himself unto for our sakes.

2. If Christ were bound to the Law, of duty he must have fulfilled it: and if
of duty he was to fulfill it, how could he thereby merit so high a degree of
honor as he is advanced unto?

This conceit of Christ's meriting for himself, does much extenuate the glory
of Christ's grace and goodness in giving himself.

. 33. Of the particular ends, why Christ gave himself, and of the condition of
the Church before Christ took her.
EPHESIANS. 5. 26. That he might sanctify it, and cleanse it with the washing of
water by the word.
THe general End of Christ's giving himself being before intimated in this
phrase (for us) is in this and the next verse particularly exemplified: and
that in two branches.

One respects the estate of the Church in this world, v. 26.

The other respects her estate in the world to come, v. 27.

The latter of these two is the most principal.

The former is subordinate to the latter, an end for the accomplishing of the
other end, for the Church is here made pure, that hereafter it may be made
glorious.

In laying down the former he notes 1. The end whereat Christ aimed. 2. The
means, whereby he effected that which he aimed at.


That end is set forth in these words, that he might sanctify it, (...). See.
39.
having cleansed it (thus may they word for word be translated) so as that
which for order of words is in the latter place, for order of matter is in the
first place.

The word (cleansing) points out our instification.

The word (sanctifying) expresses our sanctification.

The means of effecting these, are two. 1. Baptism comprised under this
phrase, washing of water. 2. The word.


The two branches of the former end, namely Cleansing and Sanctifying do in
general imply two things. 1. The Condition of the Church in it self. 2. The
Alteration thereof by Christ.


The condition is presupposed, which is, that she was impure, polluted, in the
common estate of corrupt man. Things in themselves pure, are not cleansed, but
things foul and impure: persons of themselves freed, and exempted from a
common misery, need not another help to free and exempt them. Seeing then
that the Church stood in need to be cleansed, and sanctified, surely

The Church in herself was, as the world, polluted. Very lively is Doctr.
this set forth by the Prophet Ezekiel under the similitude of a The Church in
her self polluted.
wretched infant borne of a cursed parentage, whose navel was not cut, who was
not washed, salted, nor swadled, but cast out in the open field, polluted with
blood. Often does the Apostle, setting forth Ezekiel. 16. 3. etc.
the wretched estate of the world, note of the true members Ephesians. 2. 3.
of the Church, that Tit. 3. 3.
we our selves also were such. 1 Cor. 6. 11.


The Church consists of none other then of such as came out of Adams loins.
Now as all the brood which comes from vipers, adders, toads, spiders, and
other like venomous dams, are infected with poison, so all the sons of Adam
are polluted with sin. That which is borne of the flesh (as is every mothers
child, not the members of the Church excepted: for they have fathers and
mothers of their flesh) is flesh; that is, polluted and corrupt. Therefore when
we are taken into the Church, we are borne again. Ioh. 3. 3, 5.


This our former estate by nature is often and seriously Our natural condition
often to be thought of.
to be thought of, and that in respect of Christ. Our selves. Others.

1. In regard of Christ, the more to magnify his love. Our former estate,
before he cast the wings of his mercy upon us, shows our unworthiness, our
vileness, and wretchedness, and in that respect it opens our heart and
mouth to think and say, Psalm. 8. 1, 4.
O Lord our Lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of
man that thou visitest him! Ioh. 14. 22.
Lord, how is it that thou will manifest thy self unto us, and not unto the
world! The right knowledge of our former estate, and a due consideration
thereof, makes us ascribe all the glory of our present dignity, and
happiness, to Christ that altered our estate, as Saint Paul, 1 Timothy 1. 12. etc.
I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, who was before a
blasphemer, etc. yea it makes us the more to prize and esteem the present
estate, as 2 Samuel 7. 18, etc.
David.

2. In regard of our selves this is to be thought of, to humble us, and to
keep us from insolent boasting in those privileges whereof through Christ we
are made partakers. To this purpose does the Apostle thus press this point,
Who makes 1 Cor. 4. 7.
thee to differ from another? and what have thou that thou did not receive?
Now if thou did receive it, why do thou glory as if thou had not
received it? When a man is exalted from a mean, to a great place, and
thereupon waxes proud and insolent, we say, he has forgotten from whence he
came. So as remembrance of our former condition is a means to preserve
humility, and to suppress insolency.

3. In regard of others it is to be thought of, to move us the more to
commiserate their woeful estate, who yet remain as we once were; to conceive
hope that their estate may be altered as well as ours was; to pray and use what
means we can that it may be altered. To provoke Christians to show all
meekness to them which were without, the Apostle renders this reason, for we
our selves also in times past were foolish, Tit. 3 3, etc.
etc.. read how forcibly this is urged, Romans 11. 18, 19, etc.

. 34. Of Christ's preventing Grace.
In setting down the alteration of the forenamed condition note 1. The manner
of laying it forth. 2. The matter or substance thereof.


The manner is implied in this conjunction (...).
THAT (That he might sanctify it) Christ loved the Church, and gave himself
for it, not because it was sanctified, but that he might sanctify it: so as

The Grace which Christ shows to the Church, is a preventing Doct.
Grace. Sanctification is no cause, but an effect of Christ's Ipse nos gratis
saluos fecit, ipse nos non eum quaerentes quaesiuit, inuenit, etc. Aug. in
Psalm. 78.
love: and follows in order after his love. His love arose only and wholly
from himself: in the parties loved, there was nothing but matter of hatred
before they were loved. Moses thus says of the love of God to Israel, The Lord
did not set his love upon you because ye were more in number, but because the
Lord loved you. This at first sight may seem to be (as Non est inuenire Domino
sed praeuenire. Bern. sermon. 78. in Cant.
we say) Idem per idem.
a woman's reason, that the Lord should set his love on them because he loved
them, but it being duly observed, we shall find excellently set forth the
ground of Gods love to rest altogether in himself, and in his own good
pleasure. Deuteronomy. 7. 7, 8.
Yea this being noted as the end of Christ's love, that he might sanctify it,
it further shows that it was not any foresight of holiness in the Church
that moved him to love it: first he loved it, and then sought how to make it
amiable, and worthy to be loved.

Herein differs Christ's love from the love of all men toward Difference
betwixt Christ's love and Man's. Est. 2 12, etc.
their spouses: for they must see something in them, to move them to love. When
Ahash-verosh was to choose a wife, the maidens out of whom he was to take one,
were first purified, and then he took her in whom he most delighted: But
Christ first loves his spouse, and then sanctifies it. Before he loved it, he
saw nothing in it why he should prefer it before the world.

Seeing of him, and through him, and to him is all the beauty Use.
and dignity of the Church, the glory be to him for ever, Romans 11. 36.
Amen.

. 35. Of Christ's seeking to make his Church pure.
The Matter or substance of that subordinate end which Christ aimed at in
giving himself for the Church, is in these words (that he might sanctify it
having cleansed it) which in general show that

Christ seeks the purity of his Church. For this end has he Doctr.
shed his own most pure and precious blood (for 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
his blood cleanses us from all sin) and conveyed his holy Spirit into his
body the Church, which is called the Romans 1. 4.
Spirit of Sanctification, because it renews and sanctifies those in whom it
is.

This Christ aims at, that he might make his spouse like to Reason.
himself, pure, as he is pure.

That end which Christ aimed at, we that profess our selves 1 Use.
Exhortation. 1 Ioh. 3. 3.
to be of this Church, must endeavor after: for every man that has this hope
in him purges himself as he is pure. Let us therefore use all good means to
cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh, and spirit.

This being the end which Christ aims at for the good 2 Use. Trial.
of his Church to cleanse it, they who find themselves cleansed have a good
evidence that they are of this Church: they who are not cleansed can have no
assurance thereof.

How unworthy are they of this benefit, that live as the 3 Use. Reproof.
world, and like swine upon every occasion wallow in the mire, being drawn by
every temptation into sin? Do they not, as much as in them lies, make the
death of Christ to be in vain, and pervert that maine end, which Christ aimed
at in giving himself?

But what may be thought of such as Ismael-like mock and scoff at those that
labor to be cleansed?

. 36. Of the Churches Justification.
The two particular parts of the forenamed end, which are Cleansing, and
sanctifying, do more distinctly set forth the purity of the Church even in
this world. Cleansing has relation to the blood of Christ, and so points out
our Justification.

Sanctifying has relation to the Spirit of Christ, which works our
Sanctification.

From this cleansing of the Church here meant, I gather, that No sin lies
upon the Church: for the blood of Christ purges Doctr.
from all sin. This is to be taken of the guilt of sin, which 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
by Christ's death is clean taken away: so as that sin which is in us, is as
not in us, because it is not imputed unto us.

Behold here the blessed estate of the Church, for, Blessed is Use.
he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed Psalm. 32.
1, 2.
is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not sin.

. 37. Of the Churches Sanctification.
From the sanctifying of the Church here mentioned, I further gather, that

The Church is made holy and righteous: This is here meant of Doctr.
that inherent righteousness which the Spirit of Christ works in all the
members of his body. In which respect they are called Saints: so as not only
the guilt of sin is taken away, 1 Cor. 1. 2.
but also the very body of sin is so destroyed in them, as it can Romans 6. 6.
no more reign in them, nor they obey it in the lusts thereof: but in stead of
the dominion of sin the spirit of Christ reigns in them, and leads them
unto all righteousness.

Behold here the free estate of the Church: whereas the Use.
world lies under the slavery of sin, and tyranny of Satan, the Church is
made free from sin, and a servant of righteousness: Romans 6. 18, 11.
dead to sin, and alive to God in Jesus Christ.

. 38. Of the Churches purity before God and Man.
From the Connection of these two benefits of Christ's death, Justification and
Sanctification together, we see that The Church is both spotless before God
and blameless before men. The blood of Christ so cleanfeth her as in Gods
sight she has no spot of sin: and the spirit of Christ so sanctifies her,
as her righteousness shines before men: for the Grace of God Tit. 2. 11, 12.
teaches her to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world. In this respect the Church is
said to be all glorious within, and her Psalm. 45. 13.
clothing also to be of wrought gold. And Zacharias and Elizabet, Luke 1. 6.
members of this Church, are said to be righteous before God, and blameless,
namely before men. There is no such purity in any, as in the Church. For true

is only in the body of Christ, which is the Church, whereof it is said, Thou
art all fair, and there is no spot in thee, Cant. 4. 7.

1. Quest. Is it possible that neither God nor man should epsy any fault in
those that are of the true Church, while here they live in this world?

Answ. Seeing the flesh remains in the best while they remain Sin is in
the best.
in the world, it is not possible but that both God and man must needs epsy
many blemishes in the best. All things are Heb. 4. 13.
naked and opened to the eyes of God: if therefore any remnant of sin be in
the Saints (as there are exceeding many in every one; so as if we say that we
have no sin we deceive our selves, 1 Job. 1. 8.
and the truth is not in us) it is without question manifest in his sight. Yea
such is the imperfection and weakness of the best Saints, as the flesh
continually lusting in them against the Spirit, often times prevails, and so
shows it self in some evil fruit or other, as the eye of man espieth it:
instance the examples of the best that ever lived in any age.

2. Quest. How then are they spotless before God, and How the Saints are
spotless before God.
blameless before men?

Answ. 1. God so fully discharges and acquitteth the Church of all her sins,
as she is in his account as if she had no specke of sin at all. David in this
respect uses the metaphor of covering sin, and explaineth his meaning by
these two Psalm 32. 1, 2.
phrases, forgiving, not imputing sin.

2. The course of a man's life, not this or that particular How the Saints are
blameless before men. Vna hirundo non facit ver.
action, is it which makes a man blame-worthie, or blameless: as the flock
of swallows, and not one here, or another there, is it which shows the
Spring. Now because the constant carriage of those who are of the Church is
before men blameless, they may justly be so accounted, notwithstanding some
particular things blame-worthie do sometimes pass from them. Behold here how
the true Saints may boldly lift up their faces before God and man. The
soundness of their faith causes confidence before God. The testimony of
their conscience causes courage before men. Let all that desire this
boldness, join a sound faith and a good conscience together, and labor for
assurance both of their cleansing by the blood of Christ, and sanctifying by
the Spirit of Christ.

. 39. Of the order and dependence of justification and sanctification one upon
another.
The order and manner of knitting these two benefits together is worthy to be
noted.

The letter sets sanctification in the first place: but the sense
presupposes justification: for thus he says, that he might sanctify it,
(...).
having cleansed it. Because the cleansing here spoken of is an inward
invisible work, and the evidence thereof is sanctification, which is an
outward and sensible work, therefore this is first expressed, and then that
inferred, as a matter necessarily to be presupposed.

Hence arise these Doctrines. Our English with this particle (having) does
fitly and properly expound the Greek active participles of the Praeterperfect
or finite tenses, which because the Latins want, they are feign to use the
passive, or a Periphrasis: as, vt illam sanctificaret mundatam, Erasm. Postquam
eam purgasset, Beza.

1. Justification in order goes before 1. Doct. Iustificatio non accedit
factoribus sed factores legis praecedit. Aug. de Spir. and lit. cap. 26.
sanctification: I say in order, because at that very moment that Christ by
his blood cleanses his Church, he begins to sanctify her: but when he
begins to sanctify her, he has cleansed her, she is justified.

The grace then of justification is a most free grace: it is not wrought upon
any righteousness of ours: for it is before it.

2. Christ sanctifies those whom he has cleansed. This the 2. Doct.
Apostle copiously proves in the sixth chapter to the Romans. Let none
therefore boast of their cleansing by Christ's blood, till they find themselves
renewed and sanctified by the Spirit of Christ. For note the Apostles
description of those who are justified by Christ, which for more perspicuitie
may thus be set down by question and answer. To whom is there no condemnation?
Romans 8. 1.
To them that are in Christ Jesus. Who are they? They who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit.

3. Sanctification presupposes justification: they who are sanctified 3. Doct.
may rest upon it, that they are cleansed and justified.

For sanctification is a fruit of justification, in which respect S. James
says, that we are justified by works, that is, declared so Iam. 2. 24.
to be.

Admirable is the comfort which the Saints in this world Use.
reap hereby. For their sanctification being imperfect, and the flesh abiding
in them, and lusting against the Spirit: yea sin being present with them when
they would do good, they are often forced to complain and cry, O wretched m^n
that we are: Romans 7. 24.
who shall deliver us from this body of death! If they had no other ground to
fasten the anchor of their hope upon but their sanctification, it could not
hold them fast enough against the tempests of Satan's temptations. But in that
their sanctification is a fruit and evidence of their justification, they take
heart to themselves, and thank God that with the mind they themselves serve
the Law of God, though with the flesh the law of sin. And thus vpheld and
comforted, they continue to strive against sin, till it be clean rooted out
of them, as well as remitted.

. 40. Of Sacramental washing of water.
One of the means which Christ uses for the cleansing and sanctifying of his
Church, is expressed under this phrase, with the washing of water. Water is the
outward element used in Baptism: Washing is the principal Sacramental rite
therein. Water sets forth Christ's blood: Washing notes out the application
and efficacy thereof, which is the purging and cleansing of our souls. As
water without washing makes nothing clean: so the blood of Christ, without a
right application thereof, cleanses no man's soul.

This washing of water here mentioned, being applied to an inward spiritual
cleansing, what can it else set forth but the Sacrament of Baptism, wherein
both water and washing is used?

Object.
There is but little washing used in the Sacrament of Baptism, nothing but
sprinkling a little water on the face of the party that is baptized.

Answ. That sprinkling is sufficient to show the use of water. Why water in
baptism is but sprinkled.
The party to be baptized is not brought to the Font to have his face, or any
other part of his body made clean, but to have assurance of the inward
cleansing of his soul. Now that our minds may not too much dote on the
outward thing done, but be wholly raised up to the mystery, the outward
element is no further used, then may serve to put us in mind of the inward
thing signified thereby: answerably in the Lords Supper there is not so much
bread and wine given and received, as would satisfy ones appetite, or slake
his hunger and quench his thirst, but only a little bit of bread, and taste of
wine, to declare the use of bread and wine, and so to draw the minds of the
Communicants to a consideration of their spiritual nourishment by the body
and blood of Jesus Christ.

. 41. How Baptism is a means of cleansing and sanctifying.
The manner of inferring this Sacramental washing upon the sanctifying and
cleansing of the Church thus, with the washing of water, shows, that

Baptism is a means of sanctifying and cleansing the Church. All Doctr.
those places of Scripture that attribute Ioh. 3. 5. Tit. 3. 5.
Regeneration, Gal. 3. 27.
Justification, Romans 6. 3.
Sanctification, or 1 Pet. 3. 21.
Salvation thereunto, prove as much. But that the truth thereof may more fully
and distinctly be conceived, I will briefly show, 1. In what respect Baptism
is a means of our sanctifying and cleansing. 2. What kind of means it is. 3.
How necessary it is.


In four especial respects it may be said to be a means as aforesaid.

1. In that it does most lively represent and set forth even to the outward
senses the inward cleansing of our souls by the blood of Christ, and
sanctifying of us by the Spirit of Christ. Apply the use of water (by the
washing whereof foul things are made very clean) to the virtue of Christ's
blood and efficacy of his Spirit, and the truth hereof will evidently appear.
For the better help in this application, read Romans 6. 4. etc.

2. In that it does truly propound and make tender, or offer of the grace of
justification and sanctification to the party baptized. In this respect it is
thus described, Baptism of repentance Luke 3. 3.
for remission of sins: and S. Peter to like purpose says, Acts 2. 38.
Repent, and be baptized every one of you for the remission of sins.

3. In that it does really exhibit and seal up to the conscience of him that
is baptized the forenamed graces, whereby he is assured that he is made
partaker thereof. Thus Abraham received the sign of circumcision as a seal of
the righteousness of Rom 4. 11.
faith. Hence is it that the Eunuch and others when they were Acts 8. 39. and
16. 34.
baptized, went away rejoicing.

4. In that it is a particular and peculiar pledge to the party baptized, that
even he himself is made partaker of the said graces: therefore every one in
particular is baptized for himself: yea, though many be at once brought to the
Font, yet every one by name is baptized. To this purpose faith the Apostle,
Whosoever are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ; Gal. 3. 27.
whosoever, whether Peter, John, Thomas, or any other particular person.
Ananias said to Paul in the singular number, Be Acts 22. 16.
thou baptized, and wash away thy sins.

. 42. Objections against the efficacy of baptism answered.
1. Object. Many that are baptized receive no such grace at all, they are
neither cleansed nor sanctified.

Answ. They are only outwardly washed with water, they are not baptized with
the Holy Ghost. The fault is not in that no grace accompanies that Sacrament,
but in that they receive not, but reject the grace which appertains thereto:
what if some believe not? shall their unbelief make the faith of Romans 3. 3.
God without effect? God forbid.

2. Object. Many receive the forenamed graces before they are baptized, as
Abraham before he was circumcized, and such Romans 411.
as were baptized after they believed. How then is baptism a means thereof?

Answ. Their spiritual cleansing is more lively and fully manifested thereby,
and they the more assured thereof.

3. Object. Many who long after their baptism, have lived like swine in sin,
and so have not been cleansed or sanctified, yet diverse years after have
been effectually called: what means has baptism been hereof?

Answ. The use and efficacy of baptism is not as the act thereof, transient,
but permanent and perpetual so long as the party baptized lives. Whenever
a sinner unfeignedly repents, and faithfully lays hold on the promises of
God, baptism, which is the seal thereof is as powerful and effectual as it
could have been when it was first administered. For the efficacy of baptism
consists in the free offer of grace. So long therefore as God continues to
offer grace, so long may a man's baptism be effectual. On this ground we are
but once for all baptized: and as the Ier. 44.
Prophets put the people in mind of their circumcision, so the Apostles of
their baptism long after it was administered. Yea, they speak of it (though
the act were long before past) as if it were in doing, in the time present,
Baptism saves. 1 Pet. 3. 21.


. 43. What kind of means of grace Baptism is.
II. Baptism is no physical or natural means of working Aqua exhibet
forinsecus Sacramentum gratiae, and Spiritus operatur intrinsecus beneficium
gratiae. Aug. Epist. 23.
grace, as if the grace which is sealed up thereby were inherent in the water,
or in the Ministers act of sprinkling it (as in medicines, salues, herbs,
meats, and the like, there is inherent that virtue which proceeds from the
use of them: and being applied, they have their operation, whether a man
believe it, or no) but it is only a voluntary instrument which Christ uses,
as it pleases him, to work what grace, or measure of In Baptismo praecipua
pars est Spiritus, per quem and aqua sit efficax. Chrysostom. in Act. Hom. 1.
grace seems best to him: so as grace is only assistant to it, not included
in it: yet in the right use thereof, Christ by his Spirit works that grace
which is received by it, in which respect the Minister is said to baptize with
water, but Christ with the Holy Ghost and with fire, Matthew. 3. 11.

. 44. Of the necessity of Baptism.
III. A means of working a thing may be said to be necessary Things
necessary two ways.
two ways.

1. Absolutely, so as the thing cannot possibly be without it. Ex Hypothesi.
Thus are the proper causes of a thing absolutely necessary, as in this case,
Gods covenant, Christ's blood, and the operation of the Spirit, are absolutely
necessary for attaining any grace.

2. By consequence, so as according to that course and order which God has set
down, things cannot be without them.

Baptism is not absolutely necessary as a cause: for then should it be equal
to Gods covenant, Christ's blood, and the work of the Spirit. Yea then should
all that are baptized without any exception be cleansed.

But it is by consequence necessary: and that in a double Exhypothesi.
respect. 1. In regard of Gods ordinance. 2. In regard of our need thereof.


1. God having ordained this a Sacrament to be used, it is necessary it should
be used, if for no other end, yet for manifestation of our obedience. He that
carelessly neglects; or wilfully contemns any Sacrament which God shall
enjoin him to use, his soul shall be cut off. Genesis 17. 14.


2. Great is the need that we have thereof, in regard of our dullness in
conceiving things spiritual, and of our weakness in believing things
invisible. We are carnal, and earthly: and by things sensible and earthly, do
the better conceive things spiritual and heavenly: therefore has God ordained
visible elements to be Sacraments of invisible graces. Again we are slow to
believe such things as are promised in the word, therefore the more to help
and strengthen our faith, God has added to his covenant in the word, his seal
in and by the Sacrament: that by two immutable things, (Gods covenant and Gods
seal) in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong
consolation. Besides, though in general we do believe the truth of Gods word,
yet we are doubtful to apply it to our selves: wherefore for better applying
Gods covenant to our own soul, God has added his Sacrament to his word.

. 45. Of the contrary extremes of Papists and Anabaptists about the necessity
and efficacy of Baptism.
There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed points about baptism.

One in the excess, which is of Papists that attribute too much thereunto, and
make it a plain Idol.

Another in the defect, of Anabaptists and Libertines, which Papists attribute
too much to Baptism. Bellarm. de Bapt lib. 1. cap. 4.
derogate too much from it, and make it an idle ceremony.

In two things do Papists exceed, 1. In the necessity Of Baptism. 2. In the
efficacy

They make it so absolutely necessary, as if any die unbaptized he cannot be
saved: which doom they pass against infants, though they be deprived thereof
without any fault of their own, yea or of their parents, being still borne. A
merciless sentence without any warrant of Gods word: yea against his word and
against the order which he has prescribed. He has established Genesis 17. 7.
his covenant, and promised to be the God of the faithful and of their seed:
on which ground S. Peter says, The promise is unto Acts 2. 39.
you and unto your children: and S. Paul says, your children are holy. 1 Cor.
7. 14.
Shall all these privileges be made void by an inevitable want Genesis 17. 12.
Jos. 5. 5.
of baptism? if so, would God have enjoined circumcision (which to the Jews
was as baptism is to Christians) to be put off to the eighth day, before which
day many infants died? or would Moses have suffered it to be forborne all the
time that the Israelites were in the wilderness? If it be said that baptism
is more necessary then circumcision, I answer, the Scripture lays no more
necessity upon it. If it were so necessary as they make it, then the virtue
of Christ's death were less effectual since he was actually exhibited then
before. For before it was effectual for infants without a Sacrament, but
belike not now. Had the ancient Churches conceived so of the absolute
necessity of baptism, they would not have had set times for the administering
thereof: nor suffered it to be put off so long as they did. In Thessalia mos
fuit vt paschalibus tantum d^ebus baptismus perageretur, Niceph. hist. lib. 12.
cap. 34. Socrat. hist. lib. 5. cap. 22.
Some Churches appointed it to be administered only at Easter. Ne quenquam
Sacerdotes baptizent praeterquam in Pasc^ a and Pentecosle. L L. Pipi^. Carol.
M. etc.
Some at Easter and Whitsuntide. And though many who gave evidence of their
true faith died before they were baptized, yet Iustus quacunque morte
praeuentus fuerit anima eius in refrigerio erit, dixit Ambr. Orat. de obit.
Valent. Qui diem obij^ antequam baptisaretur.
they did not thereupon judge them to be damned. This practice and judgment of
the ancients has made Rhem. annot. on Ioh. 3. 5.
many Papists somewhat to mitigate that absolute necessity, and to say that,
In this case, God which has not bound his grace, in respect of his own
freedom, to any Sacrament, may and does accept them as baptized, which either
are martyred before they could be baptized, on else depart this life with vow
and desire to have that Sacrament, but by some remediless necessity could not
obtain it. If remediless necessity can help the matter, what necessity so
remediless, as for a child to be still borne.

Again, they add such efficacy to baptism, as it gives grace Ex opere
operato, B^ em. loc. citat.
of the work it self: wherein they equal it to the very blood of Christ;
and take away the peculiar work of the Spirit; and the use of faith,
repentance, and such like graces. What can there be more in the water of
baptism, then was in the blood of such beasts as were offered up for
sacrifices? But it is not possible that the blood of Bulls and Goats should take
away sin. Heb. 10. 4.
They themselves attribute no such efficacy to the word preached, and yet they
cannot show where the holy Ghost has given more virtue to baptism, then to
the word. This text joins them both together (that he might cleanse it with 1
Cor. 1. 21. Romans 1. 16.
the washing of water through the word) What can be more said of a means then
that which is said of the word? It pleased God by preaching to save them that
believe. The Gospel is the power of God to salvation, etc.

On the other side, Anabaptists, and such like Libertines, too Anabaptists
extenuate baptism too much.
lightly esteem this holy and necessary ordinance of God, in that they make it
only a badge of our profession, a note of difference betwixt the true and false
Church, a sign of mutual fellowship, a bare sign of spiritual grace, a
resemblance of mortification, regeneration, inscition into Christ, with the
like, but no more: These indeed are some of the ends and uses of Baptism: But
in that they restrain all the efficacy thereof hereunto, they take away the
greatest comfort, and truest benefit which the Church reapeth thereby, as may
be gathered out of the points noted. 41.
before.

. 46. Of the inward washing by Baptism. Ecce quia Christus sanctificat; ecce
quia Christus ipso lauacro aquae in verbo vbi Minister videtur corporaliter
operari ipse abluit, ipse mundat. Aug. contr. lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 49.

In that with this washing of water, Christ cleanses his Church, I observe that

Whosoever are fully baptized are cleansed from sin.

Fully, that is, powerfully and effectually, as well inwardly by the Spirit, as
outwardly by the Minister.

Cleansed, both from the guilt of sin by Christ's blood, and from the power of
sin by the work of his Spirit.

To this purpose tend the many emphaticall phrases attributed by the Apostles
to Baptism, as that we are baptized into Jesus Christ, baptized into his
death, buried with him by baptism; that Baptism does save us; that Baptism
is the washing of regeneration, Romans 6. 3, 4. 1 Pet. 3. 21. Tit. 3 5.
with the like.

Vain is the rejoicing of many, who boast of their baptism, Use.
and think themselves by virtue thereof to be as good Christians as the best,
and yet live and lie in their sin, being more besmeered and defiled therewith
then they were, when they were first borne. John says, Christ baptiscth with
the holy Ghost Matthew. 3. 11.
and with fire: the Apostle says, Christ cleanses with the washing of water.
If that fire of the holy Ghost burn not up the dross of sin in thee, and
this water wash not away the filth of sin, thou were never: fully baptized.
It may be the hand of some Minister has sprinkled a little water on thy face,
but Christ's blood has not as yet been sprinkled on the soul: all the benefit
which thou reapest by thy baptism is, that another day thou shall dearly
answer for the abuse of so honorable an ordinance.

. 47. Of joining the word with Baptism.
The other means of sanctifying and cleansing the Church here expressed, is
the word. This being applied unto Baptism, and joined with it, must needs be
meant of the promise of Grace sealed up in Baptism, which is Gods promise of
justifying us freely and sanctifying us effectually, plainly made known and
truly believed: This means being thus added to this Sacrament, we may well
infer that

It is necessary that the word and Baptism go together: that Doct.
where this Sacrament is administered, the doctrine thereof be truly, plainly,
intelligibly taught, so as the nature, efficacy, end, and use thereof may be
made known; and the covenant of God sealed up thereby, believed. So says
Christ, Mat. 28. 19.
Go teach all nations baptising them. So did the Luke 3. 3.
Baptist, and the Act. 2. 38. and 8. 12, 37. and 10. 47. and 16. 15, 33.
Apostles, they preached the Gospel to them whom they baptized.

1. A Sacrament without the word is but an idle ceremony: Reasons. Detrahe
verbum and quid est aqua nisi aqua? accedat verbum ad clementum and fit
sacramentum. Aug. in Ioh. 15. tract. 80.
no more then a seal without a covenant: for it is the word that makes known
the covenant of God.

2. It is the word which makes the greatest difference betwixt the
sacramental washing of water, and ordinary common washing.

3. By the word the ordinary creatures which we use are sanctified, much more
the holy ordinances of God, whereof Baptism is one of the principal.

Quest. Is it not then lawful to administer Baptism without 1 Timothy 4. 5.
a Sermon?
Answ. Though it be a very commendable, and honorable manner of administering
that Sacrament, then to administer it when the word is preached, yet I think
not a Sermon at that time to be so necessary, as it should be unlawful without
one, to administer Baptism. For the joining of the word and Sacrament here
spoken of is, that they who are baptized, or who present children to be
baptized, and answer for them, or are present at the administering of Baptism,
or live in the places where it uses to be administered, should be instructed in
the Gospel, and taught the covenant which Baptism seals up. Besides, the
liturgy and public form prescribed for the administering of Baptism both in
our Church and other reformed Churches, lays down the nature, efficacy, end,
use, and other like points appertaining to that Sacrament, and plainly
declares the covenant of God sealed up thereby: so as in our and other like
Churches where such forms are prescribed to be always used, the word is never
separated from Baptism, though at the administering of Baptism there be no
Sermon.

The Church of Rome does directly transgress against the Papists join not the
word and seal.
forenamed rule of joining the word and Baptism together. For though they have
a public form prescribed, yet it being in an unknown tongue, not understood
of the people, nor expounded to them, it is all one as if there were no form
at all, no word at all: for that which is not understood is all one 1 Cor. 14.
9. etc.
as if it were not uttered.

Much more heinous is their transgression who live under the Gospel, where it
is preached plainly to the understanding and capacity of the meanest, and yet
are careless in coming to it, or in attending unto it, and so remain as
ignorant as if they lived in places where the word is not preached at all, or
in an unknown tongue. Such ignorant persons if they were not baptized are not
worthy while they remain so ignorant to be baptized, nor yet to present their
children to be baptized, or to be present at the baptism of others. As
Ministers that baptize ought to preach the word, so ought they who are baptized
to be instructed in the word.

. 48. Of the Inference of Glorification upon Justification and Sanctification.
EPHESIANS. 5. 27. That he might present it to himself a glorious Church, etc.
THe most principal end, in regard of the Churches good, which Christ aimed at
when he gave himself for her, is her glorious estate in heaven: this is the
end of the forenamed end. For why did Christ give himself for the Church? That
he might sanctify it, having cleansed it: why did he cleanse, and sanctify
it? That he might present it to himseife a glorious Church. Hence note these
three points. 1. Justification and sanctification must go before
glorification. 2. The end why the Saints are cleansed and sanctified in this
world, is that they may be presented glorious to Christ in the world to come.
3. The only means to make us glorious before Christ our spouse is
righteousness.


1. All those places of Scripture which set our righteousness in this world
before our glory in the world to come (as Tit. 2. 12, 13. 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8.
very many places do) do prove the first point, that Justification and
Sanctification must go before Glorification. Among Men must be justified and
sanctified before they can be glorified. Romans 8. 30.
other proofs note especially the order of the several linkes of that golden
chain that reaches from Gods eternal counsel before the world, unto our
everlasting glory after this world, Whom he did predestinate them he also
called; and whom he called them he also justified; and whom he justified them
he also glorified.

1. Heaven, the place of our glorification, is an holy City, Reasons. Reu. 21.
10, 27.
whereinto no unclean thing shall enter.

2. In that place the Church is to be married unto Christ, and to be ever with
him: she must therefore be pure as he is 1 Ioh. 3. 2, 3.
pure: for he will not endure the society of a foul filthy spouse.

As we desire assurance of our glorification in heaven, so Use.
let us get, and give evidence of our justification and sanctification on
earth. The evidence of our justification is a sound and true faith. The
evidence of our sanctification is a good and clear conscience.

The forenamed proofs and reasons do also confirm the We are here cleansed
that we might be hereafter glorified.
second point, that The end why the Saints are cleansed and sanctified in this
world is, that they may be presented glorious to Christ in the world to come.

It is therefore needful and behouefull, not only in regard of Ex co quod hic
accipit Ecclesia ad illam gloriam quae hic non est, perfectionemque perducitur.
Aug. Retract. l. 1. c 7.
Christ's honor, but also of our own glory and happiness, that here while we
live on earth we be sanctified and cleansed. If Christ for our sakes had an eye
at our future and everlasting glory, and for that end prepared means to bring
us thereunto, ought not we ourselves much rather have an eye thereat, and both
avoid all things which may hinder it, and use all means whereby we may be
assured of it? Moses had respect unto the recompense of the reward. Yea Christ
for the joy which Heb. 11. 26. and 12. 2.
was set before him endured the cross, and despised the shame.

3. That Righteousness is the only means to make us glorious Righteousness the
only means to make us glorious.
before Christ our spouse, is evident by this, that Christ gave himself to
work and effect this means for this end. Christ himself by his death, has
consecrated this, and no other means. If there be any other means then that
which Christ by offering up himself has procured, what need Christ to have
been offered up? To show that this is the means to make the Church glorious
before Christ, the holy Ghost resembles the righteousness of the Saints to
fine linen, clean, and white, Reu. 19. 7, 8.
wherewith the wife of the Lamb is made ready against the day of marriage.

Christ himself loves righteousness and hates wickedness: Reason. Psalm.
45. 7.
they therefore, and none but they that are araied with righteousness, are
glorious in his eyes.

This I have the rather noted against the conceit of our adversaries, Use.
who place all the glory of the Church in outward Papists place the glory of
the Church in outward pomp.
pomp. Wherefore their Pope whom they make head of the Church, and after a
peculiar manner the spouse of Christ, must have his triple crown, his scarlet
robes, his throne advanced above kings: Men must be his horses to bear him:
and Kings and Nobles must be his men to wait on him. Their Priests also must be
araied with glorious copes of the best wrought gold. Their temples must be
decked with curious, carved, gilded images. Their host carried about in manner
of a triumph. Their people all besprinkled with water. Their superstitious
houses must be the fairest buildings in a kingdom, and have the greatest
revenues of a kingdom belonging to them: with the like. Dionysius Ioui Olympio
aureum amiculum detraxit, laneum substituens, non sine dicterio, laneum viz. ad
vtram que anni tempestatem esse aptius.


Is this glory fit for Christ's spouse? belike then Christ has carnal eyes and
ears: and is delighted with those things wherewith the world is delighted. The
wiser among the heathen did scoff at such base conceits which their people had
of their gods. Shall Christians think more basely of Christ, then the heathen
of their gods? Too much do most people dote on outward worldly glory: even so
much as they neglect true righteousness.

For our parts as we desire to appear before Christ so as he Use.
may think us glorious, let us be araied with righteousness and holiness,
without which no man shall see the Lord, Heb. 12. 14.

EPHESIANS. 5. 27. That he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not
having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy, and
without blemish.
Having noted the inference of this verse upon the former: I will now handle it
distinctly by it self. In it is contained a description of the glorious estate
of the Church in heaven. Of that estate must this description be here meant,
Ubicunque commemoraui ecclesiam non habentem maculam aut rugam, non sic
accipiendum, quasi iam sit, sed quae praeparatur vt sit, quando apparebit
gloriosa. Aug. Retract. l. 3. c. 18.
for on earth it is not simply without spot or wrinkle: though it be prepared
so to be.

This estate is 1. Generally propounded. 2. Particularly exemplified.

In the general proposition is noted, 1. Her condition (she is presented to
Christ.) 2. Her quality (glorious.)

The particular exemplification thereof is

1. Privative, by removing all deformity: noted in two words, Spot, Wrinkle.

2. Positive, by adorning her with beauty: noted also in two words, Holy,
Blameless.

The word (present) is taken from the custom of solemnizing (...).
a marriage: first the spouse was wooed, and then set before her husband that he
might take her to wife, to be with him. Thus Genesis 2. 22.
Eve was presented by God to Adam that he might take her for his wife: and Est.
2. 13.
Esther among other virgins was presented to Ahash-verosh. This shows that
Doct.


The Church in heaven shall enjoy the presence of Christ: Ioh. 14. 2, 3.
Christ himself says expressly to his disciples, I go to prepare a place for
you, that where I am, there ye may be also. On this ground did the Apostle
desire to depart, namely Phil. 1. 23.
to be with Christ, and 2 Cor. 5. 8. Reason.
to be present with the Lord.

In heaven is the marriage betwixt Christ and the Church solemnized, which here
on earth has been in preparing. God the Father has given his Ioh. 3. 16.
son unto the Church, and the and 17. 6.
Church unto his son: yea Act. 20. 28.
Christ himself has purchased the Church unto himself by his blood, and Ose.
2. 19, 20.
promised marriage unto her, and the more to assure the Church of his love he
has Ephesians. 4. 8.
bestowed many gifts upon her: he has further sent Paranymphi.
his Ministers in his name to Ioh. 3. 29.
woo and 2 Cor. 5. 20.
beseech the Church to give her consent, and to and 11. 2.
prepare her as a pure virgin for himself: Hereupon the Church has given her
consent, for Ephesians. 5. 24.
as a spouse she is subject unto Christ as unto an head. These things being so,
how can it be thought that Christ will forsake her, and not receive her to be
with him for ever?

Can the thought of death be terrible to such as know and Use.
believe the truth hereof? Will not rather the consideration Incoragement
against death.
thereof make them with the Apostle to sigh, and desire to depart, that they
may be with the Lord? The highest degree of the Churches happiness consists
in this fruition of the Totum tibi sit Deus: quia horum quae diligis, totum
tibi est. Aug. in Ioh. 3. tract. 13. Reu. 21. 22, 23. Ioh 17. 20, 21.
presence of her spouse: for so he becomes all in all unto her: not by
means, as in this world, but immediately by himself: so as there shall need no
Minister, no Sacrament, no ordinance to set forth Christ unto us: no Governor
in family, Church, or commonwealth, to represent his person, or to keep us in
subjection: no light to direct us, no food to sustain us; we shall be so
assisted with Christ as we shall need nothing. If those servants were happy
that stood continually before Solomon, what are they that always stand not as
servants 1 King. 10. 8.
but as a wife in his presence that is infinitely greater then Solomon? If it
were a great grace and favor, that Moses saw the backparts Exo. 33. 23.
of God, what a grace and favor is it, to behold Christ 1 Cor. 13. 12.
face to face? For when he does appear, we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3 2.
Though now we be absent from the Lord, yet let us uphold our selves with the
expectation and assurance of this, that we shall be presented before Christ.

. 50. Of the Glory of the Church in heaven.
The quality of the Church in heaven is as excellent as may be, Doctr.
and therefore here said to be glorious: all beauty, all comeliness, (...).
all grace, whatsoever may make the Church amiable, lovely, or any way to be
desired, or admired, is comprised under this word glorious. In this respect the
Saints are said to shine, and that as Reu. 21. 11.
precious stones, yea as the Dan. 12. 3.
firmament, as the stars, and as the Mat. 13. 43.
sun: and to be 1 Ioh. 3, 2.
like Christ himself: and to Col. 3 4.
appear with him in glory.

This glory of the Saints extends both to soul and body, and whole person.

In regard of their souls they shall be all Psalm. 45. 13.
glorious within: for they are Heb. 12. 23.
Spirits of just men, made perfect: 1 Cor. 13. 12.
perfect knowledge, wisdom, and all manner of purity shall be in them.

In regard of their bodies, they shall be Phil. 3. 21.
fashioned like to Christ's glorious body: and that in incorruption,
immortality, Ecclesia in fine seculi expectat quo l in Christi corpore
praemonstratum est, etc. Aug. Epist. 119.
beauty, brightness, grace, favor, agility, strength, and the like. It is
therefore truly said, that the Church in the end of the world expects that
which is before demonstrated in Christ's body.

In regard of their person, as a wife is advanced to the honor and dignity of
her husband, so shall they to the honor and dignity of Christ, so far as
they are capable of it: for they shall be Luke 22. 30.
next unto Christ, yea Ioh. 17. 21
one with him, and so Heb. 1. 14.
above the most glorious Angels.

Much more might be spoken of the glory of the Church: but never can enough be
spoken thereof, no not by the tongue of men or Angels: for 1 Cor. 2. 9.
eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man
the things which God has prepared for them which love him. When Paul was rapt
up into the third heaven, and saw but a glimps of this glory, 2 Cer. 12 4.
(...).
he heard unspeakable words, which are not possible for man to utter. Wherefore
2 Cer. 4. 17.
when he speaks of it, he uses such a transcendent kind of phrase, as
cannot in any tongue be fully expressed: we thus as well as we can by one
degree of comparison upon another translate it, (...).
a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

Is not this sufficient to uphold us against all the reproach and disgrace
which the world lays upon us, because we are Use.
of the Church of Christ? The world has Isa. 62. 4.
of old counted her, to whom Christ says, Hephzibah (that is, my delight in
her) and Beulah (that is, married) forsaken and desolate, yea 1 Cor. 4. 13.
(...).
as the filth of the world, and the off-scowring of all things. Among Heathen,
none so vildly esteemed of as Christians; and amongst Papists, none so as
Protestants; and amongst carnal Gospellers, none so as they who endeavor 1
Ioh. 3. 3.
to purify themselves as Christ is pure, and to avoid the common sins of the
world. When for Christ's sake we are basely accounted of, let us think of this.

. 51. Of the Churches freedom from all deformity in heaven. Not having spot,
or wrinkle, or any such thing.
The first point noted by the Apostle in his exemplification of the forenamed
glory, is a removing of all deformity. The word translated (...).
spot, is taken for a stain on a garment, and a foul specke on a man's face,
or other part of the body: or a scarre, or other blemish in his flesh by a
sore, wound, blow, or the like. The other word ( (...).
wrinkl-) is taken for a creast in the face through old age, for it signifies
a gathering together of the skin by old age: by it is meant any manner of
breaking (as we speak) by age, sickness, trouble, pain, or the like. Because
there may be also deformities other ways, the Apostle adds this clause (or
any such thing.) These things applied to (...).
the Church, show that

No manner of deformity shall cleave to the Church in heaven. Doctr.
Thereshall be in her no stain or contagion of sin received from others, no
scarre of any evil humor arising from it self, no wrinkle, no defect of
spiritual moisture, no sign of the old man, nor any thing that may any way
make it seem deformed, or uncomely in the sight of Christ. Not only great,
heinous, capital sins, (which are as botches and boiles, and as open, wide
sores, gashes and wounds) but all spots and specks, all wrinkles and defects,
all manner of blemishes whatsoever within, or without, shall be clean taken
away. Sin shall not only be subdued in us, but utterly rooted out of us: no
relic, no sign thereof shall be left remaining. In this respect it is said,
that God shall wipe away all tears, that is, shall take away all Reu. 7. 17.
and 21. 4.
matter of mourning, sorrow, and grief. Now there is nothing that ministers
matter of more sorrow to the Saints then sin. That remnant of sin which was
in the Apostle even after his regeneration, made him thus cry out, O wretched
man that I am. Romans 7. 24.


Though this be but a privative good, yet it adds much to the heavenly
happiness of the Saints. If it were possible that we should enjoy the rest and
glory prepared for the Saints in heaven, and withal there should remain on
us the spots and wrinkles of sin, these spots and wrinkles would be as the
handwriting which appeared to Belshazzer in the midst of Dan 5. 5.
his iollitie: they would be as gall mixed with wine: they would turn all our
joy into heaviness, and take away the sweet relish of all our happiness. The
consideration therefore of this privative benefit cannot but breed in the
hearts of all such as are members of this Church a longing desire after this
perfect purging of them from all deformity.

. 52. Of the perfect purity of the Church in heaven.
But that it should be holy and without blemish. The last branch whereby the
celestial glory of the Church is set forth, is the perfect purity thereof:
the aduersatiue particle (BUT) shows that the holiness here spoken of is no
imperfect (...).
holiness, such as the sanctification of the Saints is in this world, but an
absolute perfect holiness in all the parts and degrees thereof: such as is
without spot or wrinkle: without relic, or sign of sin: and therefore by
way of explanation is added, (...).
without blemish, or blameless: such as man, Angel, nor God himself can
find fault withal. Heb. 9. 14.
This attribute is often applied to the person and blood of Jesus Christ, and
therefore 1 Pet. 1. 19.
it must needs set forth perfect purity. Whence we may observe that

The Sanctification of the Saints shall be perfect in heaven. They shall not
only be justified by having their sins covered to them, nor only have their
sanctification truly begun in them, but also in every part, point, and degree
thereof absolutely perfected: in which respect they are said to be just men
made Heb. 12. 23.
perfect. Adam in his innocence was not more pure then the Saints shall be in
heaven: yea they shall far surpass Adam as in the measure, so in the
stabilite and perpetuity thereof.

In our endeavor after holiness let us have an eye to this Use.
perfection: and not faint, if we attain not to that measure which we desire.
Perfection is reserved for the world to come. Yet know we, that the more holy
and blameless we are, the nearer we come to that heavenly estate: the more
spots and blemishes of sin we have, the more unlike we are unto it, and the
less hope we have of enjoying that heavenly happiness.

All the forenamed several points of the glorious estate of General uses of
the glorious estate of the Church in heaven.
the Church in heaven should ravish our spirits, and even break our hearts
with an holy admiration of Christ's good-nesse, and fill our mouths with praises
for the same, and make us sigh, and long after the same, and with all good
conscience and diligence use all the means we can to attain thereunto: no
labor will be lost herein. Surely, this is either not known, or not believed,
or not remembered, or not duly and seriously considered by such as make light
account thereof. Let that which has been but briefly touched be further
meditated upon, and let us pray that the eyes of our understanding may be
enlightened, Ephesians. 1. 18.
that we may know what is the riches of the glorious inheritance of the Saints.
Were it not for this hope, the Saints were 1 Eor. 15. 19.
of all the most miserable; whereas now they are the most happy.

. 53. Of the application of the things which Christ has done for the Church,
unto husbands.
EPHESIANS. 5. 28. So ought men to love their wives, etc.
THE first clause of this verse serves both for an application of the former
argument, and also for a transition to another argument.

The particle of relation (So) shows that that which has before been
delivered of Christ's love to his Church, ought to be referred and applied to
husbands. For as Christ loved his Church, So ought husbands to love their wives.

Quest. Why are these transcendent evidences of Christ's surpassing love to his
Church set before husbands? can any such things be expected from husbands to
their wives?

Answ. No, See. 27.
not for measure, but for likeness. For in this large declaration of Christ's
love, there are two general points to be noted.

1. That the Church in her self was no way worthy of love.

2. That Christ so carried himself toward her that he made her worthy of
much love.

This ought to be the mind of husbands to their wives.

1. Though they be no way worthy of love, yet they must love them.

2. They must endeavor with all the wit and wisdom they have, to make them
worthy of love. I say endeavor because it is not simply in the husbands power
to do the deed. Yet his faithful endeavor shall on his part be accepted for
the deed.

Of these points I shall hereafter more fully speak.

. 54. Of the application of the love which a man bears to himself, unto an
husband.
EPHESIANS. 5. 28. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.


THe forenamed particle (So) has also relation to another pattern, namely, of
a man's self to his body: and so it is a transition from one argument to
another.

There is some more Emphasis here used in setting down an husbands duty, then
was before, verse. 25.

There it was laid down by way of exhortation, Husbands love your wives.

Here it is laid down with a straiter charge: Husbands ought to love their
wives. So as this duty is not a matter arbitrarie, left to the husbands will
to do it, or leave it undone: there is a necessity laid upon him: he must
love his wife. Woe therefore unto him if he do it not.

In setting down this argument taken from a man's self, the Apostle resembles
a man's wife unto his body: wherein he has relation to verse. 23. where he
said, the husband is the head of the wife. Whereby he shows, that as an
husbands place is a motive to his wife, for her to perform her duty: so to
himself, See Treat. 4.. 74 76. Why the pattern of a man's self is added to
the pattern of Christ.
for him to perform his duty.

He is her head, therefore she must be subject to him.

She is his body, therefore he must love her.

This example of a man's self is both a reason, the more to move husbands to
love their wives, and also a rule to teach them how to love them.

The reason is implied under that near union that is betwixt Sicut corpus
nunquam a se dissidet, neque anima aduersus seipsum, ita virum and mulierem non
conuenit dissidere. Chrysostom. in Genesis hom. 45.
a man and his wife: she is as near to him as his own body: therefore she
ought to be as dear to him. The body never dissenteth from it self, nor the
soul against it self. So neither should man and wife.

The rule is noted under the manner of a man's loving his own body: as
entirely as he loves his body, so entirely he ought to love his wife.

Of the manner of a man's loving himself, see Treat. 4.. 74. 76.

The more to enforce this comparison, the Apostle adds, He that loves his
wife, loves himself. Ephesians. 5. 28.


By this clause two things are implied.

1. That a wife is not only as a man's body, namely, his outward flesh, but as
his person, his body and soul. She is as his body, because she was taken out
of his body: and because Genesis 2. 23.
she is set under him, as his body under his head. She is as himself, by
reason of the bond of marriage, which makes one of two. In which respect a wife
is commonly called a man's Matthew. 19. 5, 6.
second self.

2. That an husband in loving his wife loves himself: so as the benefit of
loving his wife will redound to himself, as well as to his wife.

. 55. Of the amplification of a man's love of himself.
EPHESIANS. 5. 29. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh: but nourishes and
cherishes it, even as the Lord the Church.
THe former pattern of a man's self is here further amplified. For first the
Apostle proves, that a man loves himself: and then he shows how he loves
himself.

Two arguments are used to prove the point.

One is taken from the contrary: No man ever yet hated his own flesh.
Therefore he loves it.

The other is taken from the effects of love: To nourish and cherish ones flesh
is a fruit of love: But every man nourishes and cherishes his flesh.
Therefore he loves it.

This latter argument shows the manner of a man's loving himself: and therein
a man's love of himself is a rule to teach him how to love his wife.

This indefinite particle (no man) is to be restrained to such as have the
understanding and affection of a man in them: as if he had said, no man in his
right wits: for furious, frantic, mad, desperate persons will cut their
arms, legs, and other parts, mangle their flesh, hang, drown, smother,
choke, and stab themselves. Even so they are as men out of their wits, who
Quia se diligat, and prodesse sibi velit, dubitare dementis est. Aug. de doct.
Christ. lib. 1. cap. 25.
hate, or any way hurt their wives: yea, it is the part of a mad man to doubt
of loving, and doing good to himself.

These two words (to nourish and cherish) comprize under them a careful
providing of all things needful for a man's body.

To nourish, is properly to feed. (...).


To cherish, is to keep warm. (...).


The former is done by food: the latter by apparel. Under Proprie dicitur de
galina fouente oua, quum illis incubat.
food, and apparel the Apostle comprizeth all things needful for this life,
where he says, Having food andraiment, let us therewith be content. 1 Timothy 6. 8.


This applied to an husband, shows that he ought to have a provident care for
the good of his wife in all things needful for her.

That he may yet further press this point, he returns again to the example
of Christ (even as the Lord the Church) The Apostle thought that this nail of
love had need be fast beaten into the heads and hearts of husbands, and
therefore adds blow to blow to knock it up deep, even to the head: before
he confirmed Christ's example with the example of our selves: here he confirms
the example of our selves with the example of Christ again. This he does for
two especial reasons.

1. The more forcibly to urge the point: for two examples add weight one to
another: especially this latter which is so far more excellent as we heard
out of verse. 25, 26, 27.

2. To give husbands a better direction for their providence toward their
wives, whom they must nourish and cherish, not only as their bodies, but as
Christ nourishes and cherishes his Church, not only with things temporal,
but also with things spiritual and eternal.

. 56. Of man's natural affection to himself.
EPHESIANS. 5. 28, 29. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: he
that loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh:
but nourishes, and cherishes it, even as the Lord the Church.
Having briefly showed the general scope of the 28 and 29 verses, I will
proceed to a more distinct handling of them.

They setforth The natural affection of a man to himself. Summ^ 28. and 2^


Two points are here to be noted.

1. The general proposition, that a man is well affected to himself.

2. The particular amplification, and manifestation of that affection.

This is manifested two ways.

1. Negatiuely, No man hates his own flesh. 2. Affirmatively, and that in two
branches 1. Nourishes it. 2. Cherishes

Both these are justified by the like affection of Christ to the Church which
is his body (Even as the Lord the Church) In that the Apostle propounds the
natural affection of a man's self to his body as a motive and pattern to
Christians, to love their wives, and also justifies the same by a like
affection of Christ to his Church, I observe that

Natural affection is a thing lawful and commendable: it is Doctr.
an affection which may stand with a good conscience: which Gods word is so
far from taking away, as it does establish it. For such as are (...).
without natural affection are directly condemned: and we are Romans 12. 10
commanded to be so kindly affectioned Romans 1. 30.
one to another as (...)
we are to our selves. Yea the law in 2 Timothy 3. 3.
the strict rigor thereof lays down that natural affection which is in a
man to himself as a rule for the love of his neighbor ( Mat. 22. 39.
thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self.) Hence is it that the Leu. 19. 18.
Isa. 58. 7.
Prophets, 1 Cor. 12. 26. Jam. 2. 8.
Apostles, and Christ himself do often call upon us to have an eye to that
affection which we bear to our selves. Of this pattern Christ says, Mat. 7.
12.
This is the Law, and the Prophets, this is the brief sum of them, this is
it which they do much urge and press.

1. Natural affection was at first created of God, by him Reasons.
planted in man, so that as soul, body, the powers, and parts of them, are in
their substance good things, this affection also in it self is good.

2. There are the same reasons to love our selves, as our brethren. For we our
selves are made after Gods image, redeemed by Christ's blood, members of the
same mystical body, keepers of our selves, to give an account of the good or
hurt we do to our selves, with the like. In the Law, under this word
neighbor, our selves are comprised: and every commandment of the second table
is to be applied to our selves.

. 57. Of natural self-love.
Object. Lovers of themselves are condemned in Gods word, as 2 Timothy 3. 2. Phil.
2. 21. 1 Cor. 10. 24. Romans 15. 1.
Answ. There is a double loving of a man's self. The several kinds of
self-love.


One good and commendable:

The other evil, and damnable.

Good and commendable loving of a man's self is 1. Natural. 2. Spiritual.

That which is natural is in all by the very instinct of nature: and it was at
first created, and still is by Gods providence preserved in our nature, and
that for the preservation of nature. Were there not such a natural love of
himself in every one, man would be as careless of himself, as of others, and
as loath to take pains for himself, as for others. Wherefore that every one
might have care at least of one, even of himself, and so the world be better
preserved, God has reserved in man this natural affection, notwithstanding
his corruption by sin. Yea further because every one is not able to look to
himself, at least when he is young, sick, old, or any other way impotent, God
by his wise providence has extended this natural affection toward otheralso
as they are nearly linked unto us by the bonds of nature. The next to a man's
self are (by blood and bond of nature) children. Admirably much is that which
parents do for their children, which they would never do, if there were not a
natural affection in them to their children. From children again this
affection arises toward their parents, that when parents grow old, impotent,
or any way unable to help themselves, they might have succor from their
children. And because parents and children are not always together, or not
able to help one another, or unnatural, God has yet further extended this
natural affection to brethren, cousins, and other kindred. And for a further
extent thereof has instituted marriage betwixt such as are not of the same
blood, and by virtue of that bond raised a natural affection not only in
husband and wife one to another, but also in all the alliance that is made
thereby. Moreover this affection is wrought in neighbors, friends, fellows,
and other by like bonds knit together, that the bow of Gods providence might
have many strings, and if one break, another might hold. In all these kinds,
the nearer a man comes to himself, the more does this affection show it
self, according to the proverb, Near is my coat, but nearer is my skin. God
having wrought this natural affection in the several kinds thereof, and
there being good ends and uses thereof, it is not to be condemned.

. 58. Of spiritual self-love.
Spiritual self-love is that which is supernaturally wrought in man by Gods
Spirit: whereby he is both enlightened to discern what is most excellent, and
best for him, and also moved to choose the same: so as this serves to rectify
the former. Hence it comes to pass that their chiefest care is for their
souls, and for the eternal salvation thereof: for the furthering whereof they
can be content as need requires, to 1 Cor. 9. 27.
beat down their body, to 2 Cor. 11. 27.
deny them sometimes their ordinary refreshing by food, rest, and other like
means, yea and to Heb. 11. 36, 37.
suffer them to be imprisoned, racked, and otherways tortured, and life it
self to be taken from them. This men do, Non propterea quisquam dicendus est
non diligere salutem, atque incolumitatem corporis sui, quia amplius aliquid
diligit: nam a^arus etc. Aug. de doct. Chr. lib. 1. cap. 25.
and suffer, not for want of natural affection, but by reason of spiritual
affection which persuades them that it is good for them it should be so, A man
is not therefore to be said not to love the health and safety of his body
because he loves something more. For a covetous man though he love his money,
yet he can be content to part with it for bread to nourish his body: so a
spiritual man though he love his life, yet he can be content to lose it for
his souls salvation. For he loves himself sufficiently, who does his best to
enjoy the chiefest and truest good. This spiritual affection extends it
self as Ille so satis diligit qui sedulo agit vt summo and vero perfruatur
bono. Aug. de mor. eccl. l. 1. c. 26.
far as, natural affection, namely to wives, husbands, children, parents,
brethren, cosins, friends, etc. Much is this urged and pressed in the
Scriptures, as Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 6. 19, 20, 33. Ioh. 6. 27. 1 Timothy 6. 11,
19.

. 59. Of evil self-love.
The self-love which is evil swerueth in the Object. Measure.

1. In the Object, when it is cast upon our corruptions, our lusts, our evil
humors: when we affect and love them, and for them pursue whatsoever may
satisfy them: as the ambitious, lustful, riotous, gluttonous, and other like
persons. This is expressly forbidden, Make not provision for the flesh to
fulfill Romans 13. 14.
the lusts thereof.

2. In the Measure, when our love is wholly and only cast upon our selves, so
seeking our own good, as we regard no man's good but our own: nor care what
damage another receives, so we may get advantage thereby. This is also
forbidden: Phil. 2. 21. 1 Cor. 13. 5. and 10. 24.
for it is contrary to the property of true love, which seeks not her own,
namely to the prejudice of another. This has the title of (...).
Self-love appropriated to it. It sprang from the corruption of nature, and is
daily increased by the instigation of Satan for the destruction of mankind. It
manifests it self by the many tricks of deceit which most men use in their
dealings with others: by making advantage of others necessities as in the case
of usury, of raising corn, and other commodities in time of scarcity, with
the like: by men's backwardness to help such as stand in need of their
succor: by want of compassion in other men's miseries: and by many other like
unkindness: all which verify the proverb, Every man for himself.

But by distinguishing the forenamed points we may see that notwithstanding
evil self-loue be a most detestable vice, yet it is both lawful and
commendable to love ones self aright.

. 60. Of the error of Stoics in condemning all passion.
The doatage of Stoics who would have all natural affection 1. Use.
rooted out of man, is contrary to this pattern, and unworthy to find any
entertainment among Christians: for what do they aim at, but to root that out
of man, which God has planted in him, and to take away the means which God
has used for the better preservation of man? That wise man whom they frame to
themselves is worse then a brute beast: he is a very stock and block. Not
only the best and wisestmen that ever were in the world, but also Christ
himself had those passions and affections in him, which they account
unbeseeming a wise man. Their doatage has long since been hissed out of the
schools of Philosophers, should it then find place in Christ's Church?

. 61. Of well using natural affection.
Let us labor to cherish this natural affection in us, and to 2. Use.
turn it to the best things, even to such as are not only apparently, but
indeed good: and among good things to such as are most excellent, and the most
necessary: such as concern our souls, and eternal life. For this end we must
pray to have our understandings enlightened (that we may discern Phil. 1. 10.
things that differ, and approve that which is excellent) and to have our wills
and affections sanctified, that we embrace, pursue, and delight in that which
we know to be the best. Thus shall our natural affection be turned into a
spiritual affection.

Here we see how we may make nature a schoolmaster unto us: for as Christ
sends us to the fowls of the air, and lillies Mat. 6. 26, 28.
of the field to learn of them, so the Apostle here sends us to our own
natural instinct. We cannot complain that we have no schoolmaster near us
(as many in the country whose children for want of one are rudely brought up)
our selves are schoolemasters to our selves. Wherefore as the Apostle hereby
teaches husbands to love their wives, so let us all more generally learn to
love one another: for 1 Cor. 12. 12.
we are all mutual members of one and the same body: and our brother or
neighbor is Isa. 58. 7.

. 62. Of Man's forbearing to wrong himself.
EPHESIANS. 5. 29. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh: but nourishes and
cherishes it.
THe first particle (for) shows that in this verse an evidence and
manifestation of a man's love of himself is given. The first part thereof,
which is set down negatiuely, shows that

It is against the common instinct of nature for a man to hate Doctr.
himself. It is noted as an evidence that devils were in the Gadarene, in that
he cut himself with stones: had not the devils Mar. 5. 5.
forced him, he would never have done it.

Hatred is contrary to love: it being therefore before proved Reason.
that every man by nature loves himself, by necessary consequence it
follows, that no man hates his flesh: for two contrary effects proceed not
from the same cause: no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh. Iam. 3.
12.


Object. Many do macerate their bodies with fastings, watchings, labors,
travels, and the like: others tear and gash their flesh with whips, knives,
swords, yea and with their teeth also: others lay such violent hands upon
themselves, as they take away their own lives.

Answ. 1. None of these things are done by the instinct of nature which God
has set in man, but through the corruption of nature which the devil has
caused. Now nature and corruption of nature are two contrary causes: no
marvel then that contrary effects come from them.

2. They think they do these things in love to themselves; as superstitious
persons to merit salvation, by macerating their body: others to free
themselves from ignominy, penury, slavery, torment, or such like evils: so
as there is an apparent good that makes them so to do, and not simply hatred
of themselves. They that so do, are either possessed with a Devil, or blinded
in their mind, or bereaved of their wits, or overwhelmed with some passion, so
as they know not what they do: they do it not therefore in hatred.

2. Object. Holy and wise men deliberately, and on good advice, have beaten
down their bodies, and yielded their lives 1 Cor. 9. 27. Heb. 11. 35. etc.
to be taken away, not accepting deliverance.

Answ. That was far from hatred, and in great love to themselves, as was

before.

. 63. Of unnatural practices against ones self.
The forenamed doctrine discovers many practices used 1 Use.
by sundry men to be against nature, and in that respect most horrible and
detestable.

1. The practice of the idolatrous Baalites, who to move their I doll to hear
them, cut themselves with knives and lancers, till 1 King. 18. 28. Cassian.

Anchorites, Monks flagellants, Grandimontenses, sundry sorts of Franciscans,
and other Friars, whereof D. Willet Synops. Papism. Contr. 6. quaest. 6.
some wear shirts of haire-cloth, some shirts of maile next their body, some
go barefoot, some daily whip themselves till blood follow, and some waste
their bodies with lying hard, watching, fasting, going on pilgrimage, etc.

2. The practice of Gluttons, Drunkards, unchaste and voluptuous persons, who
to satisfy their corrupt humors, impair their health, pull diseases upon
them, and shorten their days.

3. The practice of Swaggerers, who by quarrels cause their flesh to be
wounded, and their lives taken away. Among these may be reckoned such as bring
themselves to great straits, distresses, and dangers for lucre sake: and they
who by felony, treason, and the like evil deeds, cast themselves upon the
sword of the Magistrate.

4. The practice of them that give the reins to grief, fear, wrath, and
other like violent passions, so as thereby they weaken their bodies, and
shorten their days.

5. The practice of selfe-murtherers: who herein break the rule of love (as
thy self) and end their days in a most horrible Matthew. 22. 39.
sin, depriving themselves of the time, place, and means of repentance: so
as, whatsoever fond pretense they make for their sin, little better can be
thought of them, then that they thrust their souls headlong into hell, unless
the Lord betwixt the act done, and the expiration of their breath,
extraordinarily touch their hearts. Religion, nature, sense, and all abhor
this fearful fact: so as not only those who have been enlightened -- Quam
vellent aethere in alto, Nunc and pauperiem, and duros perferre labores. Uirg.
Aen. 6.
by Gods word, but also the Heathen, who had no other then the light of nature,
have adjudged it to be a most desperate sin.

. 64. Of haters of others.
2. By that affection which nature moves men to bear to their flesh, we may
see how nature more preuailes with men, then conscience and obedience to Gods
word, yea then the 2. Use.
Spirit: for where nature keeps all men from hating their own flesh, nothing
can keep many husbands from hating their wives, and wives their husbands; nor
brothers, cosens, and neighbors (yet these are our own flesh) no nor many of
those Isa. 58. 7.
who profess themselves to be of the mystical body of Christ, from hating
one another. What shall we say of these? Is nature of greater power, and more
mighty in operation then the Spirit? Surely, such either deceive themselves
and others, in pretending to be members of the body of Christ: or else the
Spirit is very weak in them, and the flesh bears a great sway. Let haters
of their brethren think of this and be ashamed.

. 65. Of man's care in providing and using things needful for his body.
The second evidence of that love which a man bears to himself, is noted in
two such branches (nourishes and cherishes) as comprize See. 55.
all needful things under them, so as the Apostle implies thereby, that

Nature teaches all men to provide such things as are needful for Doctr.
them: needful for life, as food: and needful for health, as apparel. Nature
is here propounded as a Schoolmaster to Christians: this therefore which
nature teaches is a bounden duty. It is much insisted upon by Solomon, who in
this respect Eccl. 2. 24. and 3. 13. and 5. 18. and 8. 15.
says, It is good and comely for one to eat and drink, and enjoy the good of
all his labor.

If he be worse then an Infidel that provides not for his 1 Timothy 5. 8.

est. Aug. de Doct. Chr. li. 1. ca. 26.
own, what is he that provides not for himself? even worse then a beast: for
nature has taught the bruit beasts to nourish and cherish themselves. If any
think that it more befitteth beasts, or natural men then Saints, let them
tell me which of the Saints at any time guided by Gods Spirit, has wholly
neglected himself. To omit all others, it is expressly noted of Christ, that as
there was occasion, he Mat. 8. 24.
slept, he Luke 14. 1.
eat, he John 4. 6.
rested, and otherwise refreshed himself.

Object. Though he were Ioh. 4. 31. etc.

Answ. 1. Forbearing one meal, is no great hinderance of Lawful fasts no

cherishing the body.

2. Extraordinary and weighty occasions may lawfully make a man a little
neglect himself: that so he may show he prefers Gods glory, and his
brothers salvation, before the outward nourishing of his body: to which purpose
Christ says, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me: that is, I John
4. 34.
prefer it before my meat. And Saint Paul says, I will very 2 Cor. 12. 15.
gladly be spent for your souls. We must here therefore take heed of the
extremes on both hands.

1. Of undue, and overmuch neglecting our bodies, so as the strength of them be
wasted, and the health impaired.

2. Of too much caring for it, so as upon no occasion we will lose a meals
meat, or a nights rest. Fasting and watching as occasion requires, are bounden
duties.

But to return to the point of nourishing and cherishing our flesh.

1. For this end has God provided food, apparel, and all 1. Reason.
things needful for our weak bodies, that they should be nourished and
cherished thereby: not to use them therefore, is to refuse Gods providence.

2. By well nourishing and cherishing our bodies, they are the better enabled
to do that work and service which God appoints to be done: but by
neglecting them, they are disabled thereto. As this is a motive, so ought it to
be an end whereat we aim in nourishing and cherishing our bodies.

. 66. Of them that neglect to cherish their bodies.
Against this good instinct of nature do many offend. Use.


1. Covetous misers, who so dote upon their wealth, and so 1. Covetous misers.
delight in abundance of goods treasured up, as they afford not themselves
things needful to nourish and cherish their bodies. Solomon does much tax
such: of them he says, that riches are Eccl. 2. 23. and 5. 11, 12, 13, 14.
kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. Daily experience gives evidence to
the truth thereof: for, beside that such men make their riches 1 Timothy 6. 9.
to be snares, and Mark. 10. 23, etc.
hindrances, to keep them from eternal life; they make this present life to
be very irksome, Eccl. 2. 23.
filling their heads full of much carking care, and keeping them from quiet
rest. Many in this case are so besotted, Semper eget liquidis, semper abundat
aquis. Ovid. in Jbin.
as, though they have abundance, yet they will not in health afford themselves
a good meals meat, nor seemly apparel: nor in sickness, needful physic,
no nor fire, and such like common things. Their case is worse then theirs who
want: for others will pity and succor such as want, but who will pity and
succor such?

2. Such as are too intentive upon their businesses, even the affairs 2. They

of their lawful callings (for in good things there may be excess) herein
many Students, Preachers, Lawyers, Tradesmen, Farmers, Laborers, and others
offend, when they afford not seasonable times of refreshing and resting to
their bodies, but fast, watch, and toil too much in their calling. They who by
such means disable themselves, do make themselves guilty of the neglect of
so much good as they might have done, if they had nourished and cherished their
bodies. Some are so eager on their business, that they think all the time
misspent, which is spent in nourishing and cherishing their bodies; and
thereupon wish, that their bodies needed no food, sleep, or other like means
of refreshing. These thoughts and Unlawful to desire that our bodies needed no
refreshing.
desires are foolish and sinful in many respects, as

1. In manifesting a secret discontent and grudging against Gods providence,
who has thus disposed our estate for the clearer manifestation of man's
weakness, and Gods care over him.

2. In taking away occasions of calling upon God, and giving praise unto him.
For if we stood not in such need of Gods providence, should we so often pray unto
him for his blessing: if by the good means which he affords unto us we felt
not the sweetness and comfort of his providence, should we be so thankful to
him?

3. In taking away the means of mutual love: for if by reason of our
weakness we stood not in need of succor and help one from another, what
trial would there be of our love?

3. Such as sever these two duties of nature (nourishing and 3. They who make
excess in one needful thing, an hinderance to another.
cherishing) and make them an hinderance one to another: some so nourish their
bodies, as they cannot cherish them; that is, they spend so much in eating and
drinking, as they have nothing to cloth themselves withal. Others so cherish
them, as they cannot nourish them; that is, they so prancke up themselves with
brave apparel above their ability, as they have not competent food for
themselves. These fall into two contrary extremes: into the excess in one
thing: and into the defect in another.

. 67. Of contentment in that which is sufficient.
As the Apostle by naming these two (nourish, cherish) shows that both of
them are needful, so by naming them only, and no more but them, he shows
that they two are sufficient: whence we learn, that

Having food and raiment, we must be therewith content. Doct.


The Apostle in these very words lays down this doctrine in 1 Timothy 6. 8.
another place. The Prou. 30. 8.
prayer of Agur, and the tenor of the Matthew. 6. 11.
fourth Petition prove as much.

Quest. Is a man then strictly bound to care for no more then food to nourish,
and apparel to cherish him?

Answ. So this nourishing and cherishing be extended to that estate wherein God
has set us, to the charge which God has given us, and to the calling which he
has appointed unto us, we ought to care for no more.

Let us therefore take heed of that excess which arises from the corruption
of nature, and content our selves with that competency which nature requires.

. 68. Of Christ's forbearing to hate the Church.
EPHESIANS. 6. 29. Even as the Lord the Church.
THis confirmation of the pattern of a man's self by a like pattern of the
Lord, has relation to both the parts of the manifestation of a man's love to
himself: both to the negative, and so it shows, that

The Lord hates not his Church. And to the affirmative, and so it shows, that

The Lord nourishes and cherishes his Church. That difference which is made
betwixt Esau a type of the world (Esau have I hated) and Iaakob a type of the
Church Mal. 1. 2, 3.
(Iaakob have I loved) shows that the Lord is far from hating his Church.
The world, not the Church, is the object of Gods hatred.

Object.
The Deuteronomy. 1. 27.
Church her self, and the and 9. 28.
enemies thereof often conceive by Christ's dealing with her, that he hates her.

Answ. It is the flesh abiding in them that are of the Church which makes them
so to conceive, not the spirit: and in the enemies of the Church the flesh
altogether reigns. But the things of God, and his mind and affection, nor
can, nor may be judged by carnal eyes, eyes of flesh. The Heb. 12. 6.
Spirit of God accounts such things evidences of Gods Jove, which flesh
judges to be tokens of hatred; namely, corrections.

It is not, because there is no matter of hatred in the Church, Reason.
that Christ hates it not: for by nature all are of one and the same cursed
stock, Ephesians. 2. 3.
children of wrath: and after our sanctification is begun, the flesh abiding in
us, we daily give much occasion of hatred if Christ should take that advantage
against us which he might: but it is that near union which Christ has made
betwixt himself and the Church that keeps him from hating her: he has made
her his Spouse, and he will not hate his Spouse: all the occasion of hatred
that she gives, he will either wipe away or cover.

Admirable is the comfort which every true member of the 1. Use. Comfort.
Catholic Church may reap from hence: for so long as the wrath and hatred of
the Lord is turned from us, nothing can make us miserable: we may in this
respect rejoice not only in prosperity, but also in all manner of affliction.
No calamity can move Christ to hate his Church, but rather the more to pity
it, as we do our bodies. Nay, though by sin he be provoked, and see it
needful to correct his Church, yet in love, not in hatred, in mercy, not in
wrath will he correct it.

What now if all the world have us? Seeing Christ hates 2. Use. In couragement.
us not, we need not fear nor care. The subject which is sure of his Kings
favor, little regards the hatred of others. This therefore is to be thought
of, both to comfort us under the cross, and to encourage us against the hatred
of the world. That none may pervert this comfortable doctrine, let me add two
caueats.

1. That men deceive not themselves with a naked name, thinking themselves to
be of the Church, when they are only in it, Ier. 12. 8.
such may Christ hate.

2. That being of the Church they wax not insolent, and too much provoke
Christ to anger: for though he hate not such, yet in wisdom he may so severely
correct them as if he hated them: and make them repent their folly and
insolency again and again.

. 69. Of Christ's nourishing and cherishing his Church.
2. That The Lord nourishes and cherishes his Church, is evident by his
continual providence over her in all ages. When first he created man, he Genesis
1. 28, 29.
provided before hand all things needful to nourish and cherish him. When he
was moved to destroy the earth and all living things thereon, he had care of
his Church, and provided an Arc to keep her out of Genesis 6. 14. 21.
the waters, and stored up in the Arc all things needful for her. When he
purposed to bring a famine on the world, he sent a man before hand to lay up
provision for his Church. When Genesis 45. 7. Exo. 16. 15. and 17. 6.
his Church was in a barren and dry wilderness, he gave them bread from
heaven, water out of the rock, and kept their raiment from waxing old, and
their feet from swelling. After this Deuteronomy. 8. 4.
he brought his Church into a land flowing with milk and honey: and so long as
it remained faithful he preserved it in that pleasant and plentiful land.
Thus he dealt with the Church in her nonage: and thus also has he dealt with
her in her riper age under the Gospel, as experience of all ages may witness.
Neither has he only nourished and cherished her with temporal blessings, but
also with all needful spiritual blessings: his word and Sacraments, his
Spirit and the graces thereof has he in all ages given her for that purpose:
yea with his own flesh and blood has he fed her, and with Ioh. 6. 55.
his own righteousness has he clothed her. Isa. 61. 10.


Learn we of whom we receive all needful things, both 1. Use.
spiritual and temporal, for soul and body, that accordingly Ascribe all to

we may give him the praise of all. And let us not be like the ungrateful
Israelites who Ezekiel. 20. 11, 12.
regarded not the means of spiritual Ose. 8. 12.
nourishment, and Ier. 44. 17. Ose. 2. 5, 8.
ascribed the means of their temporal nourishing and cherishing to their
Idols. In this respect the Prophet makes them Isa. 1. 3.
worse then the ox, and the ass, two of the most brutish beasts that be. Oh
take we heed that the like be not vpbraided to us. The Lord has not sparingly,
but most liberally and bountifully nourished and cherished us in this land, and
that both with temporal and spiritual blessings, so as he may justly say,
what could have been done Isa. 5. 4.
more in my vineyard, that I have not done in it?

Learn we also to depend on Christ for all things that we 2 Use.
want: we need not fear penury: though we have not that Depend on Christ for
all things.
plenty which we could wish, yet we shall have sufficiency. Christ will not
suffer his Church to famish for want of food, nor starve for want of clothing,
whether temporal for body, or spiritual for soul. He that can and will
perform it has said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. Lazarus was
not Heb. 13. 5.
forsaken; witness the Angels that carried his soul into Abraham's Luke 16. 22.
bosom. If any of Christ's Church do perish for want of outward means, it is
because Christ by that means will advance them to that place where they shall
stand in need of nothing: so as he does not forsake them.

. 70. Of the union betwixt Christ and the Saints.
EPHESIANS. 5. 30. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
THe reason of the forenamed love of Christ, and fruits Inference.
thereof to his Church, is here laid down, as both the causall particle (FOR)
and the inference of this verse upon the former do show. This reason is that
near union which is betwixt Christ and his Church, set forth by a metaphor of
the members of our body. Whereby he implies, that though there were no other
reason to move an husband to love his wife then the near union which is
betwixt them (they being Verse. 23.
one body, Verse. 31.
one flesh, Verse. 28.
one self) that were enough, for thereby only is Christ moved to love his
Church.

The mystery of our spiritual union with Christ is here laid down, and that
as fully, and distinctly (though very succinctly) Sum,
as in any place of Scripture. I will endeavor to open it as plainly as I can.

We are] The Apostle here changes both person and number: (...). Paul ranketh
himself among the members of Christ.
for before he spoke of the Church as of another in the third person, and of
one in the singular number: but here he speaks of the same in the first
person including himself, and in the plural number, including all others like
himself (elect of God, and Saints by calling) whereby he gives us to
understand what he means by the Church, namely the company of Saints, to
which, though he were a Preacher of the Gospel, an extraordinary Preacher, an
Apostle, he associateth and joins himself: noting thereby that he was made
partaker of the same grace, and saved by the same means that others were. Well
might he in this privilege not think much to rank himself, because it is
the highest degree of honor that can be Obser.
to be a member of the body of Christ: much more then to be a Preacher, a
Prophet, an Apostle, or of any other eminent calling.

The metaphor here used (members of his body) sets Metaphors which set forth
our union with Christ.
forth the near union which is betwixt Christ and the Saints. Many other
metaphors are used in Scripture for the same purpose, as 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6.
foundation and edifice, Ioh. 15. 5.
vine and branches, 2 Cor. 11. 2.
husband and wife, with the like, which are all of them very fit, but none more
proper and pertinent to the point then this of a body, the Head and members
thereof. What nearer union can there be then betwixt the head and members of
the same body?

If the Apostle had here staid, we might have thought that he had here meant no
other thing then he meant Ephesians. 1. 23. and 4. 16. and 5. 23.
before, where he styled Christ an head, and the Church a body: but in that he
adds (Of his flesh and of his bones) he declares yet a further mystery.

In the general there is a difference betwixt this phrase ( (...).
OF his body) and these (OF (...).
his flesh; and OF his bones) the former is a note of the Corporis.
genetiue case, the two latter are a Ex.
praeposition: for distinction sake the two latter might have been translated,
out of his flesh, out of his bones, or from his flesh, from his bones (for so a
like phrase is translated Ephesians. 4. 16. (...).
before, From whom) but seeing these particles out of, or from are ambiguous,
the former translation may stand as the best, so as a difference be made in the
sense though there be none in the words.

The former (members of his body) declares the union it self.

The latter (of his flesh and of his bones) declares the means How we are of
Christ's flesh.
of making that union. This latter has relation to that which Adam said of
Eve, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, (Genesis 2. 23.) which
is manifest by the next verse which the Apostle takes out of the same place.
It implies then, that as Eve was made a woman out of Adams flesh and bones, so
the Church is made a Church out of Christ's flesh and bones.

1. Quest. Was the very substance of the Saints, their flesh and bones taken
out of Christ, as the substance of Eve was taken out of Adam?

Answ. Not so, if the words be literally taken. For so may Christ rather be
said to be of our flesh, and of our bones, because he took our nature, and
that from a daughter of Adam: in which respect he is said to be 2 Timothy 2. 8.
(...).
of the seed of David, and Romans 9. 5. (...).
of the Jews, as concerning the flesh. Besides, the Apostle expressly says
(verse. 32.) that This is a great mystery. The mystery therefore must be
searched out. For this end Christ must be considered as another Adam (and so
the holy Ghost styles him 1 Cor. 15. 45, 47.
The last Adam, The second man) that is, a stock, a root that gives a being
to branches sprouting out of him.

2. Quest. What being is that which we receive from Christ? What being we
receive from Christ.

Answ. Not our natural being (that we have of the parents of our flesh) but a
supernatural, and spiritual being, which the Scripture terms Tit. 3. 5.
a new birth, Ephesians. 4. 24.
a new man, 2 Cor. 5. 17.
a new creature. This spiritual being is not in regard of the substance of our
soul, or body, or of any of the powers or parts, faculties or members of them
(for all these we have by lineall descent from Adam, and all these have all
sorts of men, as well they who are not of the Church, as they who are of it)
but in regard of the integrity, goodness, and divine qualities which are in
them 2 Pet. 1. 4. Ephesians. 4. 24.
even that holiness and righteousness wherewith the Church is endued and
adorned. As we are natural men we are of Adam, as we are spiritual men we are
of Christ.

3. Quest. Why is mention made of flesh and bones in this Why we are said to be
of Christ's flesh. Genesis 2. 23.
spiritual being?
Answ. 1. In allusion to the creation of Eve, that by comparing this with that,
this might be the better conceived.

2. In regard of the Lords Supper, where the flesh of Christ is mystically set
before us to be spiritual food unto us. That as before (verse. 26.) he showed
the mystery of one Sacrament, Baptism; here he might show the mystery of the
other Sacrament, The Lords Supper.

3. In relation to Christ's humane nature, by virtue whereof we come to be
united unto Christ. For the divine nature of Christ is infinite,
incomprehensible, incommunicable, and Diuinitas vnigeniti facta est particeps
mortalitatis nostrae, vt and nos participes eius immortalitatis essemus. Aug.
Epist. 57.
there is no manner of proportion betwixt it and us, so as we could not be
united to it immediately. But Christ by taking his humane nature into the
unity of his divine nature, made himself one with us, and us one with him: so
as by his partaking of our mortality, we are made partakers of his
immortality.

4. Quest. Are we then united only to his humane nature?
Answ. No: we are united to his person, God-Man. For as We are united to
Christ's person.
the divine nature, in and by it self, is incommunicable; so the humane nature
singly considered, in and by it self, is unprofitable. The Deity is the
fountain of all life and grace: the flesh quickneth not: but that spiritual
life which originally and primarily flows from the Deity, as from a
fountain, is by the humanity of Christ, as by a conduit-pipe, conveyed into
us.

5. Quest. How can we who are on earth, be united to his How Saints on earth
are united to Christ in heaven.
humane nature, which is contained in the highest heaven?
Answ. This union being supernatural and spiritual, there needs no local
presence for the making of it. That eternal Spirit which is in Christ is
conveyed into every of the Saints (as the soul of a man is into every member
and part of his body) by virtue whereof they are all made one with Christ, and
with one another: by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, 1 Cor. 12.
12, 13.
which body is Christ.

This is to be noted against these two errors. The first is I. Error.
this, We are united first to the divine nature of Christ which is every
where, and by virtue thereof to his humane nature.

Answ. 1. The Deity (as we showed) is immediately incommunicable: so as this
cannot be.

2. Our union with Christ is spiritual, not physical or natural, so as this
local presence needs not.

The second error is this,

The humane nature of Christ has all the divine properties in it, II. Error.
so as it is every where present, and by reason thereof we are united unto
Christ.

Answ. This also is impossible and needless. The properties of a true body
cannot possibly admit the incommunicable properties of the Deity: that
implies direct contradiction, which is, that finite should be infinite.
Needless also this is, because the union we speak of, is (as we said)
spiritual.

6. Quest. What kind of union is this spiritual union? Our union with Christ
a true and real union.

Answ. A true, real union of our persons (bodies and souls) with the person
of Christ (God and man.) For as the holy Ghost did unite in the virgins womb
the divine and humane natures of Christ, and made them one person, by reason
whereof Christ is of our flesh and of our bones: so the spirit unites that
person of Christ with our persons, by reason whereof we are of his flesh, and
of his bones. A great difference there is betwixt the kinds of these unions:
for the union of Christ's two natures is hypostaticall and essential, they make
one person: but the union of Christ's person, and ours, is spiritual and
mystical: they make one mystical body: yet is there no difference in the
reality and truth of these unions: our union with Christ is never a whit the
less real and true because it is mystical and spiritual: they who have the
same spirit ar^ as truly one, as those parts which have the same soul. The
effects which proceed from this union do show the truth thereof: for that
spirit which sanctified Christ in his mothers womb sanctifies us also, that
which quickened him quickneth Romans 8. 11. Ephesians. 2. 6.
us, that which raised him from death, raises us, that which exalted him
exalts us. The many resemblances which the Scripture uses to set forth this
union, do show the truth thereof: but most lively is it set forth by that
resemblance which Christ makes betwixt it and his union with his Father. I
pray (says he of all his Saints) That they may all Ioh. 17. 21, 22.
be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in
us: that they may be one, as we are one. This note of comparison (as) is not to
be taken of the kind, but of the truth of these unions, our union with Christ
is as true as Christ's union with his Father.

So true is this union, as not only Jesus himself, but all the Unusquisque
Christianus non incongrue sustinet personam Christi. Aug. de Genesis l. 2. c. 24.
vide eundem quaest. 69.
Saints which are members of this body together with Jesus the head thereof are
called CHRIST, 1 Cor. 12. 12. Gal. 3. 16.

This is to be noted against their conceit, who imagine this union to be only
in imagination and conceit: or else only in consent of spirit, heart, and will:
or at the most, in participation of spiritual graces.

7. Quest. What is the bond whereby this union is made: With what bonds we are
united to Christ. 1 John 4. 13.
namely whereby Christ and the Saints are made one?
Answ. There is a double bond, one on Christ's part, even the spirit of Christ
(for hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given
us of his spirit) another on the Saints part, even faith (for Christ dwells
in our hearts by faith) Ephesians. 3. 17.
The spirit is conveyed into us when we are dead in sins, wholly flesh, but
being in us, it breeds this blessed instrument of faith whereby we lay hold
on Christ, and grow into him as the science into the stock. Thus Christ laying
hold on us by his spirit, and we on him by faith, we come to be incorporated
into him, and made one body, as the science and stock one tree.

8. Quest. To what end has Christ thus truly and nearly Why Christ made the
Saints one with himself.
united us unto himself?
Answ. Not for any benefit unto himself: but merely for the honor and good
of the Church. By this union the honor of Christ is communicated to the
Church, as the honor of an husband to his wife, and of an head to the body.
Great also is the benefit which the Church reapeth thereby: for by this means
is Christ made more fit to do good to the Church, as an head to the body, and
the Church is made more capable of receiving good from Christ, as a body from
the head, being knit to it by the soul, and by veins, sinews, nerves,
arteries, and other like ligaments.

Thus having as plainly as I can by questions and answers laid open this great
mystery, I will further note out some of those excellent privileges which by
virtue thereof appertain to the Saints, and also some of the principal duties
which in regard thereof the Saints are bound unto.

. 71. Of the privileges appertaining to the Saints even in this life by reason
of their union with Christ.
The privileges of the Saints which arise from their union with Christ respect
this life, the time of death, and the life to come.

In this life these,

1. A most glorious condition, which is to be a part of Christ, a 1. Saints are
members of a glorious body.
member of his body. All the glory of Adam in Paradise, or of the Angels in
heaven is not comparable to this. In this respect the Saints are said to be
crowned with glory and honor, and to have all things put under their feet.
Compare Psalm. 8. 4, 5. etc. with Heb. 2. 6, 7. etc. and ye shall find the
Apostle apply that to Christ, which the Prophet spoke indefinitly of man. Now
those two places cannot be better reconciled, then by Coelo, and Angelis, and
omni creatura honorabilior est ecclesia. Chrysostom. de Pentecost. sermon. 26.
this union of Christ and Saints: for seeing both make one body, which is
Christ, that which is spoken of the body may be applied to the head, and that
which is spoken of the head may be applied to the body: for the same honor
appertains to both. In which respect the Church is more honorable then
Heaven, Angels, and every other creature.

2. The attendance of good Angels, who are sent forth to minister 2. Saints
attended by Angels.
for them who shall be heirs of salvation, because those heirs are of the
body of Christ, who is their Lord. These are those horses, and charets of fire
which were round about Elisha: Heb. 1. 14. 2 King. 6. 17.
which are also round about every of Gods Saints in all their distresses,
though we see them no more then the servant of the man of God saw them, till
the Lord opened his eyes. That charge which is given to the Angels over the
Son of God to keep him in all his ways, and to bear him in their hands
lest Psalm. 91. 11, 12.
he dash his foot against a stone, has relation to this body which is Christ.

3. An honor to make Christ himself perfect: for as the several 3. Saints
make Christ perfect.
members make a natural body perfect, so the several Saints, this body which
is Christ. In this respect the Church is said to be the fullness of him that
fills all in all. Ephesians. 1. 23.
Christ fills all things, and yet the Church makes him full: which is to be
understood of that voluntary condition whereunto Christ subjected himself, to
be the head of a body: so as without the parts of the body he is imperfect, as
a natural body is maimed and imperfect if it want but the least member
thereof. How can we now think but that he will preserve and keep safe all his
Saints? Will he restore to us all the parts of our natural body at the
general resurrection, and will he lose any of the parts of his own mystical
body?

4. A kind of possession of heaven while we are on earth: for 4. Saints
assured of salvation: and how.
that which the head has a possession of, the body and several members have
also a possession of. In this respect it is said, he has raised us up
together, and made us sit together in Ephesians. 2. 6.
heavenly places. And, he that believes on him has everlasting Ioh. 5. 24.
life: is passed from death unto life. And, he that has the Son, 1 Ioh. 5.
12.
has life. This is somewhat more then hope: and serves exceedingly to
strengthen our hope, and give us assurance of that heavenly inheritance.

They know not the power of God, nor the virtue of this union, who deny that
the Saints have assurance of salvation. For (to follow this metaphor a little)
suppose a man were cast into a river, and his head able to lift and keep it
self above water, would we not say, that man is safe enough, he is above
water. This is the case of this mystical body: it being cast into the sea of
this world, Christ the head thereof has lift, and keeps himself aloft even
in heaven. Is there now any fear, any possibility of the drowning of this
body, or of any member thereof? If any should be drowned, then either Christ
must be drowned, or else that member pulled from Christ; both which are
impossible. Thus then by virtue of this union we see how on Christ's safety,
ours depends: if he be safe, so are we: if we perish, so must he.

In this respect ye may be secure O flesh and blood: ye have Securi estote
caro and sanguis: vsurpastis coelum in Christo: negent and in coelo Christum
qui vobis coelum negant. Tertul. de Resur.
got heaven in Christ: they who deny heaven to you, may also deny Christ to
be in heaven.

Learn here how to conceive of the resurrection, ascension and safety of
Christ, even as of the resurrection, ascension and safety of an head, in and
with whom his body and all his members are raised, exalted, and preserved.

5. A most happy kind of regiment under which the Saints are: even such an one
as the members of an head are under. An head rules the body not as a cruel
lord and tyrant, rigorously, 5. Difference betwixt
in humanely, basely, and slauishly, but meekely, gently, Christ governing the
Saints and the world.
with great compassion, and fellow-feeling. Even so does Christ, his Church,
binding up that which is broken, healing that which is maimed, directing that
which wandreth, and quickening that which is dull; which privilege is so much
the greater because it is proper to the Church. Though he have a golden scepter
of grace and favor to hold out to his Church (as Ahash-verosh held out his to
Esther) yet he has also Est. 5. 2.
a rod of iron to break the men of this world, and to dash them Psalm. 2. 9.
in pieces like a potters vessel. Though he be gone to prepare a place for his
Saints, that where he is they may be also, yet will Ioh. 14 3.
he make his enemies his footstool. Psalm. 110. 1.


6. An assurance of sufficient supply of all needful things which 6. Assurance
of all needful supply.
the Saints want, and of safe protection from all things hurtful. For by
reason of this union, Christ our head has a sense of our want and of our
smart. On this ground he said to them which fed and visited his members, Ye fed
me, ye visited me: and again, Mat. 25. 35. Act. 9. 4.
to Saul that persecuted his members, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

Object. How is it then, that the Saints want many things, Why Christ suffers
the Saints to want, and suffer.
and often suffer much smart, and hurt?

Answ. Christ in his wisdom sees it behouefull that they should want, and
feel smart (and that we are to be persuaded of) or else he would not suffer
them to want or feel that which they do. Wherefore in all need, in every
distress and danger, let us lift up our head to this our head.

7. A right to all that Adam lost. For Christ is the heir of all, (the 7.
Saints have a right to what Adam lost.
earth is the Lords, and the fullness thereof) yea as mediator and head of the
Church is he heir of all: his body therefore has a right to all. On this
ground the Apostle says, All things are Heb. 1. 2.
yours. So as the Saints and only the Saints can with good conscience Psalm. 24
1.
use the things of this world. They who are not of this 1 Cor. 3. 21.
body (what right and title soever they have before men) are but usurpers of
the things they enjoy and use. They are like to bankrupts, who being not worth
one penny, deceitfully borrow of others, and therewith keep a great table,
deck and furnish their houses very sumptuously, put themselves, wives and
children, into brave apparel, are frolic and riotous: what is like to be the
end of such?

8. A right to more then Adam ever had: namely, to Christ 8. Saints have a
right to Christ. See. 28
himself, and to all that appertains unto him: as to the purity of his
nature, to the perfection of his obedience, the merit of his blood, the power
of his death, the virtue of his resurrection, the efficacy of his ascension,
all is ours: even as the understanding, wit, judgment, sight, hearing, and all
that is in the head, is the bodies: if the Church it self were of it self as
pure in nature, as perfect in righteousness, as powerful over death, and
devil, and grave, and hell, as able to rise from death, and to ascend into
heaven, as Christ, it could receive no greater benefit thereby, then it does by
them in the person of Christ: so truly and properly is Christ himself, and all
things appertaining to him, the Churches. What can more be said? what can more
be desired? O blessed union! blessed are they that have a part therein!

Quest. How is it then that the Church is so basely and miserably Why the
Church basely accounted of. 1 Ioh. 3. 1.
respected in the world?
Answ. The world knows us not, because it knows not Christ. It knows not
Christ the head of this body: it knows not the body which is Christ. Let not
us who know both head and body, the near union which is betwixt them, and the
privileges which follow thereupon, be danted, neither with the scoffs or
scorns of the world, nor with our own outward weaknesses, wants, and
calamities. What would he that has Christ, have more?

. 72. Of the privilege of our union with Christ in the time of death.
The privilege which the Saints receive by their union with Christ in the time
of death (even all that time that passes from the departure of the Saints out
of this world unto the general Resurrection) is admirable: for when body and
soul are severed one from another, neither soul nor body are separated from
Christ, but both remain united to him: even as, when Christ's body and soul
were by death severed one from another, neither his soul, nor his body were
separated from the Deity, but both remained united thereunto. This inviolable
bond that holds the Saints, (yea, even their very bodies as well as their
souls) united to Christ in death, is the benefit of a spiritual union. If our
union with Christ were corporeal, it could not be so.

Ob. Is it possible that the body which is dead should remain Corruption of
the body no hinderance to our union with Christ.
united to Christ, when as it receives no virtue from him?

Answ. 1. If a member of a natural body may do so, why not a member of the
mystical body? That a member of a natural body may do so, is evident by
those who have an hand, arm, foot, leg, or any other member taken, with a dead
palsy: they are sometimes so taken, as those parts receive no manner of sense,
or any vigor, or life from head or heart at all: and yet remain true members
of that body.

2. The very dead bodies consumed with worms or otherwise, do receive a great
present benefit from their union with Christ: for by virtue thereof there is a
substance preserved, and they are kept from destruction: there is nothing
destroyed in the Saints by death, but that which if it were not destroyed,
would make them most miserable, namely sin: that is utterly, totally, finally
destroyed in them, and all the concomitances thereof, which are all manner of
infirmities: but the rotting of the body, is but as the rotting of corn in the
earth, 1 Cor. 15. 36.
that it may arise a more glorious body. The metaphor of sleep, 1 These 4. 13.
attributed to the Saints when they die, shows that their bodies are not
utterly destroyed.

Object. The bodies of all men, even of those that are not Difference betwixt
the preservation of the Saints bodies and others in the grave.
of this union, are preserved from utter destruction. This therefore is no
benefit of our union with Christ.

Answ. Though in the general thing it self, which is a preservation of the
substance of the body, the same thing befalls the Saints and the wicked: yet
the means whereby both are preserved, and the end why they are preserved is
far different.

1. The Saints are preserved by a secret influence proceeding 1 These. 4. 14, 16.
from Christ, as an head: in which respect they are said to sleep in Jesus,
and to be dead in Christ. But the wicked are reserved by an Almighty power of
Christ, as a terrible Lord and severe Judge.

2. The bodies of the Saints are preserved to enjoy eternal glory together
with their souls: but the bodies of the wicked are reserved to be tormented in
hell.

In regard of these differences, the grave is as a bed to the Saints, Isa. 57.
2.
for them quietly to sleep therein free from all disturbance till the day of
resurrection: but it is a prison to the wicked to hold them fast against the
great Day of Assise, that at Doomes day they may be brought to appear at the
bar of Gods judgment seat, and there receive the sentence of condemnation.

. 73. Of the privilege of our union with Christ after death.
The privilege which the Saints by virtue of their union with Christ receive
after death, far surpasses all before. It may be drawn to two heads. 1.
Their Resurrection. 2. Their glory in heaven.


That which was before said of the difference betwixt the preservation of the
bodies of the Saints and wicked in death, may be applied to the difference of
their Resurrection.

Resurrection simply in it self is not the privilege of the Saints, but
Resurrection of life: to the wicked appertains the Ioh. 5. 29.
Resurrection of condemnation. The benefit of Resurrection arises from the
glory which follows thereupon in heaven. That glory has the Apostle
excellently set forth. 49, 50. etc.
before verse. 27.

. 74. Of the duties which are required of the Saints by virtue of their union
with Christ.
The mystery of our union with Christ, as it is a matter of great comfort, and
encouragement (which arises from the forenamed privileges) so also is it a
matter of direction and instigation unto us for the performing of sundry
duties, whereof they who desire assurance of the forenamed privileges, and
comfort by them, must be careful and conscionable. Some of the most principal
of those duties are these.

1. Confidence in Christ. Christ being our head, so mighty, Heb. 3. 6.
so wise, so tender, every way so sufficient an head as he is, we should highly
dishonor him, if we should not wholly and only repose our selves upon him for
every good thing, and against every evil.

2. Subjection answerable to his manner of governing us. Mat. 6. 10. Christus
habet sanctos voluntate, peccatores vero necessitate sibi subiectos.
The world is subject to Christ perforce, as he is an absolute and Almighty
Lord: but he governing us as an head, we must be subject unto him as members,
willingly, and readily. What member will rise up, and rebel against the head?
yea, what member is not as ready to obey, as the head to command? Hier. in Ephesians.
1.


3. A cleansing of our selves from all filthiness of flesh and 2 Cor. 7. 1.
spirit. Shall we defile the members of Christ? The sins of the 1 Cor. 6. 15.
Saints are in this respect the more heinous because that body, even Christ,
whereof they are members, is defiled thereby. Wherefore in regard of Christ the
head, of other Saints their fellow members, and of themselves, must all that
profess themselves to be of this body be watchful over themselves, and
cleanse themselves from all filthiness. Otherwise they give just occasion to
think that they are no members of this body. If a Lions foot, or Bears paw
were held out, and said to be the member of a man, would any believe it? Can we
then think that worldlings, drunkards, profane, riotous, unclean persons, and
such like limbs of the Devil, are members of Christ?

4. A conformity unto the image of Christ in true holiness Ephesians. 4. 24.
and righteousness. It is not therefore sufficient for the members of Christ
to abstain from polluting themselves, for they are created in Christ Jesus
unto good works. He that abides in Ephesians. 210.
me (says Christ) and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit. Ioh. 15. 5.


5. Heavenly affections. If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which
are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of Col. 3. 1, 2.
God. Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth.
Where our head is, there also ought our heart to be. Earthly affections come
not from that head which is in heaven: nor from that Spirit which proceeds
from him. They Romans 8. 5.
who are after the spirit mind the things of the spirit.

6. Courage against death: seeing that in death we are Christ's, what cause have
we to fear death? Be not afraid of Luke 12. 4.
them that kill the body, and after that, have no more that they can do. The
ancient worthies would not accept deliverance, that Heb. 11. 35.
they might obtain a better resurrection.

Hitherto of the union it self. The means of effecting it, remain to be
handled.

75. Of their regeneration who are members of Christ.
EPHESIANS. 5. 30. -- Of his flesh, and of his bones.
This clause declares the means whereby we come to be members of Christ,
namely by receiving a new being from Christ, which is to be, not of the flesh,
and of the bones of Adam, but of the flesh and of the bones of Christ, which
being spiritually taken, as has been expounded. 70.
before, shows that

They who are true members of Christ body, are truly regenerate. Doct.
If any be in Christ he is a new creature: these words are so 2 Cor. 5. 17.
(...).
laid down by the Apostle, as they serve both for a demonstration, and an
exhortation (he is, or let him be a new creature) neither is expressed, but
either, or both may be understood. As many of you as have been baptized into
Christ (that is, made Gal. 3. 27.
members of this body) have put on Christ, (that is, have been borne again)
the first branch notes out our incorporation into Christ, the latter our
regeneration.

spirit: he diffuseth life and grace into all his members: if his 1 Cor. 15.
45. Romans 8. 11.
spirit be in us, it will quicken our mortal bodies. If the head of our
natural bodies conueigh sense into all our members: if the root of a tree
diffuse sap into all the branches: shall not Christ much more give life to all
his members?

This then is a matter of trial, whereby we may prove whether Use.
indeed we are of this body or no, and so have a true right Trial whether we
be members of Christ.
to the forenamed privileges. Many boast of this honor that they are members
of Christ's body, and yet are not of his flesh and of his bones: they have no
other being, then what they received from their parents. These vain professors
are like wooden legs, or arms on a man, which may be covered over with hose
and sleeves for a time, but shall not be raised at the resurrection with the
other parts of the man's body: so neither shall those professors be raised to
glory with Christ, though they may be covered over with the hose and sleeves of
profession, and thereby seem to be members.

. 76. Of the author of our regeneration Christ.
This relative particle (HIS) twice repeated (of HIS flesh, (...).
and of HIS bones) shows that

Regeneration is of Christ. Ioh. 5. 21.
The Son quickneth whom he will. Doctr.


Object. This work is attributed in Scripture to the 1 Pet. 1. 3.
Father, to the Ioh. 3. 5.
Spirit, to the Iam. 1. 18.
word, and to the 1 Cor. 4. 15.
Ministers of the word.

Answ. Christ may very well stand with all these. The three persons in Trinity
are all one: One in nature and essence: Philem. verse. 10. The work of the
three persons in our regeneration.
One in will and consent: One in virtue and power: what the one does the other
does also. Yet because there is a difference in their manner of working, this
work (as other works) is distinctly attributed to each of them.

The Father is (as I may so speak) the beginner of this work. His will it was
that his Son should be the head of a body, and that there should members be
made fit for that head, and have a new being (of his own will begat he us) for
Iam. 1. 18.
this end he sent his Son into the world to be made flesh. The Son put in
execution the will of his Father: he took flesh upon him, that we might be of
his flesh. Thus says Christ of himself, I came down from heaven to do the
will of him that Joh. 6. 38, 39.
sent me; And this is the Fathers will which has sent me, that of all which he
has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last
day. The Spirit applies unto us the virtue and efficacy of the flesh of
Christ, and so finisherh this blessed work. It is the Spirit that quickneth:
the flesh profits nothing, Ioh. 6. 63.
namely, of it self without the Spirit.

Thus we see that the applying of this work of regeneration unto Christ,
excludes not the work of the Father, or of the Holy Ghost therein, but
excludes the work of man: so as it is not of our selves, nor of our parents,
nor of any other man: for we are borne not of blood, nor of the will of the
flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God: in which respect our new birth Ioh.
1. 13.
is said to be (...).
from above.

Object. How is it then attributed to the word, and to the Ioh. 3. 3.
ministry of man? How regeneration is attributed to the word, and to
Ministers thereof.


Answ. As unto instruments which the Lord is pleased to use: Of the word it is
said, God has begotten us with the word: of himself a Minister thus says the
Apostle, In Christ Jesus I have begotten you: so as God and Christ are joined
Iam. 1. 18.
with these instruments, or else they are no whit powerful and 1 Cor. 4. 15.
effectual for so great a work: for neither is he that planteth any 1 Cor. 3.
7.
thing, nor he that watreth: but God that gives the increase.

The work of regeneration is a new creation, a divine Reason.
work, above humane strain. It must therefore be wrought by the Lord, or it
cannot be wrought at all.

This is to be noted both of those that have not yet assurance Use.
of this blessed work wrought in them: and also of those who have assurance
thereof.

The former may here learn whither to have recourse for it: namely, to him who
came down from heaven for that purpose, and who says, Him that comes unto
me I will in no wise Ioh. 6. 37.
cast out. In all the means that we use, let us look up unto him, and seek a
blessing of him.

The latter must with the tenth leper return back unto Luke 17. 16.
Christ, and glorify God. Whatsoever the means were, or whosoever the
Minister was, the praise and glory of all must be given to him.

. 77. Of the matter of our regeneration, Christ.
The preposition (OF) twice set down (OF his flesh, and (...).
OF his bones) being a proper note of the material cause, shows that

Christ is not only the author, but the matter also of our new birth. The new
spiritual being which the Saints have, comes out of him. Col. 2. 19. (...).
From him all the body having nourishment increases with the increase of God.
In this respect we are said to be Ephesians. 1. 3.
blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ. The metaphor of a Joh 15. 5.
vine, which Christ takes unto himself, proves also as much: so do these
phrases, Ioh. 6. 55.
My flesh is meat indeed, my blood is drink indeed.

This Christ comes to be by his incarnation. God in himself is as a
bottomless and a closed fountain: from him Reason.
immediately we can receive nothing. But Christ made flesh is Zach. 13. 1.
a fountain opened: Col. 1. 19.
In him all fullness dwells. Ioh. 1. 16.
And of him have all we received, even grace for grace.

Behold here the benefit of Christ's incarnation: by his taking 1 Use:
part of our mortal flesh, are we made partakers of his spiritual flesh,
namely, of that spiritual life and grace which comes from him, who was made
flesh, to convey the same into us. To strengthen our faith the more firmly
herein, the Lord has instituted the holy Communion of his body and blood.
With what conscience, reverence, and confidence, ought this blessed Sacrament
to be celebrated?

By this Doctrine we may further learn how to seek every 2. Use.
thing at Gods hands which we desire to obtain, and how to offer that
sacrifice of praise unto God, which we would have Ioh. 16. 23.
to be accepted; namely in and through Jesus Christ, by whom Heb. 13. 15.
only we have all that communion which we have with God. Col. 3. 17.
Well therefore does the Church conclude all her forms of Prayers and Praises
with this, or such a like clause, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

. 78. Of the excellency of Regeneration.
The particular matter of our regeneration (the flesh and bones of Christ) here
expressed, shows that

Regeneration is a most excellent work. The excellency hereof Doctr.
will the better appear, if we compare it with the great and glorious work of
our creation, and show how far it surpasses it: wherein I will hold close to
this metaphor, and touch Difference betwixt regeneration and creation.
no other differences then it does point out unto us.

1. In our creation Christ was only a worker: but he is the very matter of our
Regeneration, we are of his flesh.

2. The relation that then was betwixt Christ and man,

was Creator, but here Head, We are members of his body. Creature, Body,

The bond is now much nearer.

3. The being which then we had, was from Adam: But the being which now we have
is from Christ, of HIS flesh.

4. That being was but natural. This is spiritual: for that Ioh. 3. 6.
which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.

5. Then our being was different from Christ's: but now it is the very same
with Christ's, Of his flesh.

6. Then might man clean fall from that estate wherein he was created (as he
did) and yet Christ remain as he was. Now it cannot be so. For if any of the
Saints now fall away, either Christ must fall with them, or they must be pulled
from Christ, and so Christ remain a maimed body.

Behold the riches of Gods mercy. One might think it The riches of Gods
mercy.
sufficient, and more then man could ever have been thankful enough for, that
God at first created man after his own image in a most happy estate. From
which when we wittingly and wilfully fell, God might justly have left us, as he
did the evil Angels. But he has not only restored us again to that former
estate, but advanced us to a far more excellent and glorious estate: wherein
his goodness appears to be as his greatness, infinite, incomprehensible.
Who can sufficiently set it forth? For as the heaven is high above the earth,
so great Psalm. 103. 11.
is his mercy toward them that fear him.

. 79. Of the ancient Law of marriage.
EPHESIANS. 5. 31. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
shall be joined unto his wife: and they two shall be one flesh.
THe same points which were before laid down, concerning the near union of
man and wife, and of Christ and the Church, are here further confirmed by the
ancient law of marriage: which the Apostle does the rather mention, because it
follows upon that text, whereunto he alluded in the former verse. For when
Moses had alleged these words of Adam concerning Eve, This is bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh, he Genesis 2. 23, 24.
adds this law, Therefore shall a man leave his father, etc. In this place
these words have both a literal and a mystical sense. A literal of man and
wife. A mystical of Christ and the Church. The maine thing which the Apostle
aims at, is to Inference.
show how nearly man and wife are linked together: that thereby they may the
rathet be moved to perform those mutual and several duties which they owe
each to other. But because he propounded to husbands and wives the examples of
Christ and the Church, as patterns and motives to them, to do their duty, he
applies that which was first spoken of man and wife, unto Christ and his
Church, to show that there being so fit a resemblance betwixt these two
couples, the pattern propounded is the more pertinent to the purpose, and the
reason enforced from thence the more forcible.

Because the opening of the literal sense will give great light to the
mystery, I will first handle this text according to the meaning of the letter.

The first clause (for this cause) implies a necessary connection (...).
with that which went before. The near union of man and wife, as well as of
Christ and his Church, was before noted. A wife was said to be as the Verse. 28.
Genesis 2. 23.
body of a man, yea as Verse. 28. Genesis 2. 23.
himself. Adam called her his flesh and bones. Hereupon both Moses and Paul
infer, Therefore, or, For this cause shall a man leave father. Because man
and wife are so near by Gods institution, they must also be most dear each to
other in their mutual affection.

The Man (meaning an husband) is here in particular mentioned, Meaning of the
words.
because at the first making of this Law the woman was brought to him to see
how he would like her: and having cast his affection on her, he was to be bound
hereby to continue that good liking toward her: as also because of the
preheminencie which man has above his wife. Yet is not the man only tied
hereby, but the wife also: the nature and rule of relation requires as much:
if a man must inseparably cleave to his wife, the wife must answerably cleave
to her husband.

These words (shall leave father and mother) are neither generally to be taken
of all duties, as if no duty were to be performed to parents by children after
they are married: nor simply, as if indeed parents were utterly to be forsaken:
but they are meant,

1. Of that daily service which children under their parents government
perform unto them, seeking to please them in all things. When children are
married, then their daily attendance must be upon their wives, or husbands,
taking care how 1 Cor. 7. 33, 34.
to please them.

2. Of erecting a new family: for which end their parents house must be left,
and the husband and wife must dwell each with other.

3. Of the difference to be put betwixt parents, and wife or husband. So as if
by any inevitable occasion it should so fall out, that a man must leave his
parent, or his wife (as in case parent and wife were both giving up the Ghost,
and in places so far remote, as the husband could not possibly be with both,
yet both instantly desired his company) by this Law he must leave his parent,
and cleave to his wife.

Hereby then the bond of marriage is declared to be the most inviolable bond
that can be. For all men know, that the bond betwixt parent and child is a
firm and inviolable bond: but the bond betwixt husband and wife is more firm
and inviolable.

To set forth the firmness of the marriage bond he adds this Emphacicall
phrase, shall be joined, (or as the word properly, cording to the natural
notation thereof signifies, shall be glued) (...). Glue.
to his wife. Things well glued together are as fast, firm, and close as if
they were one entire piece. Yea we observe by experience that a table will often
times cleave in the whole wood, before it will part asunder where it is glued:
so as an husband ought to be as firm to his wife as to himself: and she to
him.

Fitly does this agree with that which follows (they two shall be one flesh)
Our English cannot well express the Greek (...).
in good sense word for word (which is thus, they two shall beinto, or in one
flesh) the meaning is, They which were two before marriage, by the bond of
marriage are brought into one flesh, to be even as one flesh: as nearly united,
as the parts of the same body, and the same flesh. This unity is not in regard
of carnal copulation (for if they be married they are one flesh, Matrimonium
non facit coitus, sed voluntas. Chrysostom. in Mat. hom. 32.
though they never know one another) nor in regard of procreation, because one
child comes from them both (for though they never have child, yet are they
one flesh) but in regard of Gods institution, who has set it down for a law,
and as another nature, that man and wife should be so near one to another.
Their consent in marriage (by virtue of Gods institution) makes them to be one
flesh.

Well does our English note the emphasis of the original in this particle THEY
(they two) which shows that the bond (...).
of marriage knitteth only two together: one man, and one woman, and no more.

This Law sets forth the Union betwixt man and wife. Sum.


Therein three things are noted concerning the state of marriage.

1. The praeeminencie of it (a man shall leave father and mother.)

2. The firmness of it (and be joined to his wife.)

3. The neerenesse of it (they two shall be one flesh.)

. 80. Of preferring husband or wife before parents.
The first point shows, that

A wife, or an husband must be preferred before parents. The Doct.
examples of Genesis 31. 14.
Leah and Rachel, yea and of 1 Samuel 19. 11
Micol, are commendable in this respect.

1. The bond of marriage is more ancient, more firm, more Reason.
near. There was husband and wife before there was parent and child: and there
is a time when parents and children may depart one from another, and that while
both live: but no time, wherein man and wife may part asunder till death part
them. And children though they come from the flesh of their parents, yet are
made two (so as of one are two) but husbands and wives though they were two
before, yet are made one (so as of two is one.)

What wrong then do such parents unto their children, as Use.
keep them, even after they are married, so strait under subjection, Parents
may not keep their children being married too straight.
as they cannot freely perform such duty as they ought to their husband, or
their wife? This is more then a parents authority reaches unto. Yet many
think that their children owe as much service to them after they are married as
before: which is directly against this law.

Greater is the wrong, and more sinful is the practice of Nor keep them from
husband or wife.
such as keep their children from their husbands, or from their wives. The
match (say they) falls out much worse then we looked for. But this should
have been looked to more carefully before hand. After marriage it is too late
to seek such a redress.

On the other side, there be many children who so respect Children may not
prefer their parents before husband or wife. Apud Romanos sponsa obtecta
flammeo capite quum extulisset pedem e paternis aedibus, vertebatur in gyrum,
itaque duceb^tur in domumsponsi, nes^iret redeundi viam ad aedes parentum.
Erasm.
their parents, as they neglect their husband or their wife. Some husbands will
bestow what they can on their parents, and keep their wives very bare,
suffering them to want necessaries; not caring how they vex and grieve them so
they please their parents. Some wives also will privily purloine from their
husbands to bestow on their parents.

Others can never tarry out of their parents houses, but as often as they can,
go thither. The ancient Romans, to show how unmeet this was, had a custom to
cover the brides face with a yellow veil, and so soon as she was out of her
fathers house to turn her about and about, and so to carry her to the house
of her husband, that she might not know the way to her fathers house again.
All those pretenses of love to parents are more preposterous then pious: and
natural affection bears more sway in such, then true religion. Their
pretense of piety to parents is no rust excuse for that injury they do to
husband and wife.

. 81. Of the firmness of the matrimonial bond.
The second point concerning the firmness of the marriage knot in these words
(shall be joined to his wife) affor death two doctrines.

1. Man and wife must associate themselves together by continual See Treat. 2.
part. 2.. 14.
cohabitation: for this end they leave their parents family, and erect a new
family.

2. Man and wife are joined together by an inviolable bond. It See Treat. 2.
part. 2. 2.
must never be cut asunder till death cut it. Body and soul must be severed
one from another before husband and wife.

Be careful therefore to preserve this indissoluble knot: and so live
together, as with comfort you may live together, because you may not part.

. 82. Of two only to be joined together in marriage.
The third point concerning the neerenesse of man and wife, in these words
(they two shall be one flesh) affords two other doctrines.

1. Marriage can be but betwixt two, one man, and one woman: for it is
impossible that more then two should so nearly, and firmly be joined
together, as man and wife are. Every word almost in this law proves this
doctrine. For it says a man, not men: to a wife, not to wives: to his wife,
not to another wife: two, not more then two: they two, not any two: one flesh,
not many fleshes.

Object. This particle (two) is not in the law as Moses records Genesis 2. 24.
it.
Answ. It is there necessarily implied, for at that time there were but two in
the world: God then speaking of them, means but two. The same spirit that
guided Moses, guided also the Mat. 19. 5.
Evangelists, and the 1 Cor. 6. 16.
Apostles: so as by their inserting of this particle (two) it is certain that
it was intended by Moses: as the particle (only) which Christ puts into this
text, Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Mat. 4. 10.
him only shall thou serve.

Quest. Why did God at first make but one man, and one woman?
Answ. The Mal. 2. 15.
Prophet answers, that he might seek a godly seed.

If therefore there be more then two, it is an adulterous seed which proceeds
from thence.

. 83. Of Polygamy and Bigamy.
Can Polygamy (the having of many wives) or Bigamy (the having of two wives at
once) have any good warrant against such an express law? Are not both of them
against the first institution of marriage, so as we may say, Mat. 19. 8.
from the beginning it was not so? Yea also and against Deuteronomy. 17. 17. Leu. 18.
18.
other particular laws? Genesis 4. 19. Magis pertinere ad nuptiarum bonum, non
vnum and multas, sed vnum and vnam, satis indicat ipsa prima diuinitus facta
coniugum copula, etc. Aug. de Nupt. and concup. l. 1. c. 9. Genesis 2. 18. Genesis
16. 5. and 21. 11.
Lamech one of Cains cursed stock was the first that we read of to have
presumed against that ancient law.

Object. Afterward many Patriarchs, and other Saints took that liberty unto
themselves.
Answ. It was their sin, and a great blemish in them. The common error of the
time, and their insatiable desire of increase made them fall into it. Many
inconveniences followed thereupon: neither can it be thought but that much
mischief must needs follow upon having more wives then one: for whereas God
at first made a wife to be as an help unto man, two, or more wives cannot but
be a great grief and vexation unto him by reason of that emulation that is
betwixt them. Through Hagars means was Sarah stirred against Abraham, and
Abraham grieved at Sarahs words. Though Leah and Rachel were sisters, yet great
were their emulations: the like whereof is noted of Peninnah and many others.

Considering the heinousness of this sin, our laws Stat. 1. Jacob. 11.
have justly made it felony for a man to have more wives then one, or a woman
more husbands.

. 84. Of the near conjunction of man and wife together.
2. The nearest of all other are husband and wife one to another. Doctr.
Every clause in the forenamed law proves as much.

1. Parents must be left for wife: who nearer then parent and child? if man
and wife be nearer then the nearest, then they are the nearest of all.

2. A man is glued to his wife. This metaphor sets forth the neernesse of a
thing as well as the firmness of it: for things glued together are as one
entire thing.

3. Man and wife are one flesh: many of one are made two, but no two so nearly
and truly made one as man and wife.

As God has limited a propinquity, and unity of things, so Reason.
are they to be accounted: but God has thus nearly knit man and wife
together, and made them one flesh. Those whom Mat. 19. 6.
GOD has joined together, says Christ of man and wife: in which respect
matrimonial conjunction is called the covenant Pro. 2. 17.
of God: so as this covenant cannot be released by any, no not by the mutual
consent of man and wife (Those whom GOD has joined together, let no man put
asunder) yet may many other covenants made betwixt party and party, be
released and disanulled by mutual consent of both parties.

friend, fellow, brother, child, parent or any other. Who would not cry fie
upon that child that hates his parent, or fie upon that parent that hates his
child? The heathen and savages would not think them worthy of humane society.
What then may be thought of the man that hates his wife, or the wife that
hates her husband? Apply this to all other transgressions: and well note how
the Lord is a witness thereof. Mal. 2. 14.

instruments they are therein, and a diabolical spirit is in them. For Satan
most labors to unloose those knots which the Lord knitteth most firmly.
Children of several venters, and several friends of each party, are much
faulty herein. Cursed be they all before the Lord.

This near conjunction betwixt man and wife is a great 3. All duties betwixt

God requires of either of them. For thereby they do duty, and show kindness
to their own flesh. No man may hide himself from his own flesh at large:
that is, no man may neglect any duty of mercy, or justice to his neighbor
who is of the same stock that he is: shall then an husband or wife hide
themselves from one another who in the nearest respect that possibly can be are
one flesh? not because they come from one flesh, but because they come (...).
into one flesh.

Hitherto of the literal sense of this verse.

The mystical follows.

. 85. Of the matrimonial conjunction of Christ and the Church.
The forenamed ancient marriage law is here applied mystically Quod per
historiam impletum est in Adam, per prophetiam significat Christum qui reliquit
patrem, etc. Aug. de Genesis lib. 2. c. 24.
to Christ and the Church, as is evident by the next verse, where the Apostle
having reference to this verse says, This is a great mystery. There is then a
mystery contained in it. But of what, or of whom is that mystery? The Apostle
himself makes answer, in these words: I speak concerning Christ and the
Church.

The mystery in general is this,

Christ and the Church are to one another as husband and wife.

The particulars of this mystery are these.

The matrimonial conjunction betwixt Christ and the Church is a most
Preheminent conjunction. Firm Near

First of the general.

The many espousall, and matrimonial titles, which in Scripture are given to
Christ and the Church in mutual relation of one to another, evidently show
that they are joined together by the honorable, inseparable and inviolable
bond of marriage: He is styled a Ioh. 3. 29.
Bridegroom, she a Bride: he Cant. 1. 13, 15.
Well-beloved, she Love: he an 2 Cor. 11. 2.
Husband, she a Wife: he an Ephesians. 5. 23.
Head, she the Body: both and verse. 31.
one flesh.

2. All things requisite to join man and wife together, do fitly concur
betwixt Christ and the Church.

1. They are persons fit to be joined. Though Christ be the things which make
Christ and the Church fit to be husband and wife.
God, yet for Ioh. 17. 19.
this end he became man: and though the Church were impure, yet for this end is
she cleansed and sanctified.

2. They have their parents consent: for God is the Ioh. 20. 17.
common father of both. And God has given Romans 8. 32.
Christ to the Church, and the Ioh. 6. 39.
Church to Christ.

3. They have given their Cant. 2. 16.
mutual consent each to other.

4. He Ephesians. 5. 23, 24.
bears an husband like affection to her, and she is willing to yield a
wife-like subjection to him.

5. He has Ephesians. 4 8.
given her many favors and gifts as pledges of his love: and she in testimony
of her faithfulness was under the Law circumcised, and is under the Gospel
baptized: and does bind her self with all the sacred bonds and covenants
which God to that purpose has sanctified.

6. He has prepared Ioh. 14. 3.
places of habitation for them both together, and Reu. 22. 17, 20.
she earnestly desires to be with him.

Behold another evidence of Christ's admirable love to the 1. Use.

former was that she was his body. This, that she is his wife: well might the
Church say as Abigaile did, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the
feet of the servants of my 1 Samuel 25. 41.
Lord: and as the prodigal child, Make me as one of thine hired Luke 15. 19.
servants: or as the Baptist, I am not worthy to stoop down to Mar. 1. 7.
unloose thy shoe-latchets. What a favor then is it to be made his spouse, his
wife, his Queen. Great was the favor which Ahash-verosh showed to Esther,
when he made her his wife: he was a great Monarch, reigning from India to
Ethiopia over 127 provinces: but Esther was a poor orphane and captive: yet
was not this favor comparable to Christ's: for there was no such disparity and
inequality betwixt Ahash-verosh and Esther, as betwixt Christ and the Church:
neither is Esthers advancement to be compared with the Churches: and yet there
was some cause in Esther to move Ahash-verosh to do what he did, for she was
very beautiful, and lovely, and worthy to be loved: but. 33, 34.
in the Church when Christ first cast his love on her, there was no such thing.
No pattern of love can be given any way comparable to this.

Let the Church therefore, and all that profess themselves 2. Use.
to be of the Church, take such notice hereof, as they may endeavor Direction.
How Christ's spouse must carry her self.
to carry themselves worthy of this honor and advancement: not to wax proud
and insolent thereupon, but to despise all vain and worldly toies: to answer
love with love, as the Church is set forth in Salomons song; to be subject to
her husband, to reverence and obey him, and to perform all duties appertaining
to such a wife: seeking by all good means to maintain the honor of her
place. The Church is made a pattern of duty to all wives: if she should
fail, greater inconvenience would follow from thence, then from Vashties Est.

This is the rather to be regarded because it is not only a 3. Use.

what indeed they will do. Wherefore no profane person that lightly esteems
the Lord Jesus, no Idolater that casts his love on other husbands, no swearer
or blasphemer that dishonoreth the great Name of Jesus, none that any way are
rebellious against him, none that hate, scorn, scoff, or hurt any of his
members, can have any comfort in this advancement of the Church, because they
have no part therein, nor right thereunto.

But great is that comfort which the true Saints may receive 4. Use.
therein. For by virtue of this matrimonial bond, Consolation. The privileges
of Christ's spouse.


1. Christ is made a yoakefellow with his Church, and her companion. Under all
the burdens which are laid upon her, he puts his shoulder to make it the
more easy: yea, the great burdens of Gods wrath, the curse of the law, and
sin the cause thereof, has he so taken on him, as he has clean freed his
Church from them, because they would else have crushed her down to hell.

2. Christ is as her champion to answer all challenges sent unto her, as her
advocate to plead and answer all the complaints that shall be made against her,
as her surety to discharge all her debts: the Church being couert-baron under
Christ, he is as her self, all in all for her, and to her.

3. All his honors, goods, privileges are hers: she has Ecclesia omnem
sponsi potestatem tenet. Aug. contr. Don. l. 4. c. 1.
a right to them, and her part in them, she is a coheire with him (Romans 8. 17.)
a Queen because he a King (Psalm. 45. 9.) and all glorious, as was noted, verse.
27.

4. He will assuredly perform all the offices of an husband, as to love her,
bear with her, provide for her, with the like. Able he is to do all, for he
is omnipotent: willing also he must needs be, because willingly he has taken
upon him this place: he has made himself a pattern to other husbands: will
he not then do that himself which herequireth of others?

If ever any wife might receive comfort in a match, the Church may receive
comfort in this match.

The benefit of this match will yet more lively appear by a particular
consideration of the three forenamed properties of this matrimonial bond, the
preheminencie, firmness, and neerenesse thereof.

. 86. Of Christ's leaving his Father and mother for his spouse.
I. The preheminencie of the matrimonial bond betwixt Christ and the Church
herein appears, that

Christ left his Father and his mother for his spouse the Church. As Christ is
God, God is his Father; as man, the Virgin Marie was his mother. Now the
leaving of his Father must be taken only by way of resemblance, in that he came
from the place of his Fathers habitation, to the place where his Spouse was.
The Scripture says, that he was in the bosom of his Father: Ioh. 1. 18.
by him, as one brought up with him, his daily delight, rejoicing always Prou.
8. 30.
before him: yet descended he into the lowest parts of the earth Ephesians. 4. 9.
where his spouse was. He came out from the Father, and came into Ioh. 16. 28.
the world.

But truly and properly did he prefer his Spouse before his mother. For when
he was instructing his Spouse, and his mother came to interrupt him, he said to
his mother, who is my Mark. 3. 33, 34.
mother? and to his Spouse, behold my mother.

Of the Use.

house. Seeing Christ has gone before us, and given us so good an example,
what an high point of ingratitude would it be for us, to prefer father,
mother, or any other before Christ our husband? Note what he says in this
case, He that loves Matthew. 10. 37.
father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me. And again, If any come
unto me, and hate not his father and mother, he cannot Luke 14. 26. expounded.
How parents to be hated for Christ.
be mine. To hate here, is to be so far from preferring father and mother
before Christ, as rather then not to love Christ, to hate father and mother.
Or, so entirely to love Christ above all, as our love of parents in comparison
thereof to be an hatted. Thus Leui said unto his father and mother, I have not
seen him: Deuteronomy. 33. 9.
for they observed the word, and kept the covenant of Christ.

This then is our duty, that we suffer not any natural affection and dotage
on our parents to swallow up that love we owe to Christ, as Pharaohs
ill-fauoured and leane-fleshed kine eat Genesis 41. 4.
up the seven well-fauoured and fat kine. How much less should any love of
this world, of the profits, promotions, or pleasures of this world, draw away
our hearts from Christ; should we not rather say and do as the Apostles did,
Behold, we have for saken Matthew. 19. 27.
all and followed Christ?

. 87. Of the indissoluble union betwixt Christ and the Church.
II. The firmness of that bond whereby Christ and the Church are said to be
glued together, is greater and more inviolable then that whereby man and wife
are joined together: Death parts man and wife: but death cannot make a
diremption betwixt Christ and the Church: so as we may well from this metaphor
infer, that Christ and the Church are inseparably Hosea 2. 19.
knit together. I will betroth thee unto me for ever, says Christ unto the
Church. The covenant which Christ makes with his Church, is an everlasting
covenant. The mountains shall depart, Isa. 61. 8. and 54. 10.
and the hills be removed, before his kindness shall depart from the Church.

The steadfastness and unchangeableness of his will, is the Reason.
only cause thereof. Whom he loves, he loves unto the end. Ioh. 13. 1.
His gifts and calling are without repentance. He is not like the Romans 11. 29.
hard hearted Jews, who upon every slight occasion would put away their
wives. The Lord hates putting away. Though Mal. 2. 16.
therefore the Church, through her weakness, do depart from him, and play the
harlot, yet return again to me, says the Ier. 3. 1.
Lord.

Learn we by this pattern to cleave close unto the Lord, Use. Cleave to
Christ.
which is a duty most due to Christ who cleaves so close to us, and therefore
often Deuteronomy. 10. 20. and 13. 4. Acts 11. 23.
expressed in the Scripture.

Three virtues there are which are of special use to this purpose, Faith,
Hope, Love.

Faith is the hand whereby we lay fast hold on Christ, and as it were knit him
to our selves, as he by his Spirit knitteth us to himself. This makes us rest
and repose our selves on him for all needful things: and not to leave him for
any thing.

Hope is the anchor, which holds us fast against all the storms of Satan, so
as they can never drive us out of our harbor, which is the Lord Jesus Christ.

Love is the glue and soader which makes us one with Christ: for it is the
property of love to unite those that love one another in one. Ionathans soul
was knit with the soul of 1 Samuel 18. 1.
David. For why? Jonathan loved him as his own soul. He that loves is well
pleased with him whom he loves, and seeks also to please him, that they may
mutually delight one in another. Were these three virtues well rooted in us, we
would say, who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
Romans 8. 35. etc.
or distress, etc.

. 88. Of the equal privilege of all the Saints.
III. Concerning the phrase, whereby the neerenesse of All the Saints made one
Spouse.
man and wife is set forth (they two shall be one flesh) it may be demanded how
this can be applied to Christ and the Saints, who are more then two?

Answ. Christ by one Spirit knitteth us all into one body, 1 Cor. 12. 13.
and so makes all jointly considered together one Spouse. The multitude of
Saints does no more imply many wives, then the multitude of members which the
natural body of a wife has. This point then teaches us, that

In the mystical marriage betwixt Christ and the Church, all and every of the
Saints have an equal privilege. Some are not See. 22.
Concubines, some wives, nor some more loved, or preferred to another, but all
one wife. All are one in Christ Jesus. Gal. 3. 28.


Neither the Father that gave them all, nor the Son who Reason.
took them all, saw any thing in one more then in another; their mere grace
moved them to do what they did. Well may every one apply all the forenamed
privileges unto themselves: and not one emulate another.

This affords instruction to the more eminent in the Use.
Church, that like proud dames they insult not over others, as if they were
their handmaids: and consolation to the meaner sort, that they may uphold
themselves, and possess their souls with patience, and not envy, or grieve
at the outward prosperity and privileges of others. In the greatest
privilege they are equal to the greatest.

This of the parties coupled to Christ. For these words (they two) show that
all the Saints are but one: Christ is the other of the two. The next words (are
one flesh) show how near those Saints are to Christ.

. 89. Of the near union betwixt Christ and the Church.
The maine point here to be noted is, that

Christ and the Church are most nearly linked together. What Christus nihil
aliud deputat corpus suum (i.) Ecclesiam, quam seipsum, quia de Christo and
ecclesia verius intelligitur, Erunt duo in carne una. Aug. de pec. mer. lib. 1.
cap. 31.
can be nearer, then that two should come into one flesh?

This is somewhat more then to be of Christ's flesh. That shows we are as it
were cut out of Christ: this shows that we are again knit to him. That was a
preparation unto this: this is as the consummation and perfection of all. See.
70.
Many metaphors are used to set forth the near union betwixt Christ and his
Church, but this surpasses them all. As here we and Christ are said to be one
flesh, so in another place, one spirit. Well therefore might the name and title
Christ be given to this Spouse of Christ.

. 84.
It was noted on a like ground to this, that of all other persons 1 Cor. 6. 17.
and 12. 12.
the transgression of a wife against an husband is most heinous. What then are
the transgressions of the Church against Christ? As we are much more bound unto
Christ for the privileges we receive from him as an Head and Husband, and so
our Savior having made with us an everlasting covenant of marriage, then for
those we received from him as our Creator, Lord and Master: so are the
rebellions now committed against him more monstrous. To Adam that broke the
first covenant whereby like a rebellious child and servant he sinned against
his Father and Master, mercy and pardon was given: but to such as now break
the bond of this everlasting covenant, and make a total and final desertion,
utterly renouncing this Husband, or by their adultery cause him to give them a
bill of divorce, there remains no more sacrifice Heb. 10. 27.
for sins; but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery
indignation which shall devour the adversaries. This is to be noted, to make
us the more circumspect over our ways, resisting sin in the beginning, and
looking diligently lest any Heb. 12. 15.
man fall from the grace of God; and giving no place at all unto Ephesians. 4. 27.
the Devil. Satan will most endeavor to dissolve the nearest bonds that God
makes. This then being the nearest of all, we ought to be the most careful in
preserving it.

. 90. Of the mystery of the union of Christ and the Church.
EPHESIANS. 5. 32. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
Church.
THis verse is a conclusion of that excellent digression which the Apostle has
made concerning the near union of Christ and the Church.

In it two points are to be noted.

1. A patheticall exclamation (This is a great mystery.)

2. A particular application of the forenamed law (but I speak concerning
Christ and the Church.

Here first note that

The union betwixt Christ and the Church is a great mystery.

The Apostle could not have said more of it then to call it a mystery, a great
mystery.

A mystery is a divine secret. Of a mystery see more in the whole armor of
God, Treat. 3.. 168. on Ephesians. 6. 19.


A Secret it is in two respects.

1. Because it is not known.

2. Because it is unsearchable: the depth of it cannot be fathomed.

It is a Divine secret, for two other respects.

1. Because it could not have been opened but by divine revelation.

2. Because when it is opened it cannot be conceived but by the illumination of
the Spirit. That Spirit which opens and reuealeth the mystery, must also
open the eyes of our understanding to discern aright of it.

It is further said to be a great mystery.

1. Simply in it self, because the matter thereof is deep, 1. Use. The
mystery of our union with Christ not to be measured with the last of our
reason.
difficult, weighty, and of great moment.

2. Comparatively in relation to other mysteries: no mystery revealed in Gods
word comparable to it.

Let us not presume to measure it with the line of our own reason. It being a
great mystery, it is above our capacity: yet because it is revealed we must
believe it, as we do the mysteries of the Trinity, of Christ's eternal
generation, of the personal union of his two natures, of the proceeding of the
holy Ghost, with the like; because the word has revealed them, though we
cannot fully see the reason of them. Herein lies a maine difference betwixt
our estate in this world and in the world to come: here we must believe what we
know but in part: there we shall perfectly know whatsoever is to be believed.
Preachers can but in part make known this mystery, and hearers can but in
part conceive it, let us therefore wait for perfect understanding of it, till
all things be perfected in Christ: but in the mean time believe without
doubting or wavering, that which is revealed of it.

In our meditation of this mystery, let us conceive no carnal, 2. Use. No
carnal thing in our union with Christ. Ecclesia Christo in occulto vxor est.
Occulte quippe atque intus in abscondito secreto spiritali anima humana
inhaeret verbo Dei, vt sint duo in carne vna. Aug. contr. Faust. Man. lib. 22.
cap. 38.
no earthly thing of it, because it is a mystery: it is altogether spiritual
and heavenly. From the natural union of our head and body, and from the
matrimonial union of man and wife, we may and ought to take occasion by way of
resemblance, to help our understanding in the union of Christ and his Church:
for this end are these resemblances used, and by this means may our
understanding be much helped, as by the outward elements and rites which are
used in the Sacraments: but if because of these comparisons we draw this which
is only and wholly spiritual, to any carnal matter, we shall make that to be
a thick mist, and dark cloud, which is given for a light.

The dotage of our adversaries is here plainly discovered. They make our union
with Christ merely carnal. For they conceit it to consist in a corporeal
commixtion of Christ's flesh with ours, by our eating his flesh with the teeth
of our bodies, and drinking his blood down our throats, and digesting both 3.
Use. Papists make our union with Christ a carnal matter. Joh 6. 52. Ioh. 3. 4.
in our stomachs as our bodily food, that so it may turn into our substance.
Thus they show themselves like the dull-headed Capernaitans, and like ignorant
Nicodemus. There is a great deal of gross absurdity, but no great mystery
in that conceit.

. 91. Of the Popes usurping to be Spouse of the Church.
The Apostles application of this mystery to Christ and the Church,
discovers two gross errors of the Papists.

One, that they make the Pope a Spouse of the Church. With what face can any
apply that to the Pope and the Church, which the Apostle so expressly says is
meant of Christ and the Multos adulteros video qui sponsam tanto pretio emptam
possidere volunt, and id agunt vt pro sponso amentur. Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 12.
Uide Bern. ep. 237. ad Eugen.
Church? yea, what arrogant presumption is it, to attribute that to mortal
sinful man, which is proper to the eternal and holy Son of God? Is not this
to confer Christ's prerogatives upon himself, and so make himself plain
Antichrist? Who gave the Church to the Pope, or the Pope to the Church? When
did she give her consent? (I speak of the true Catholic Church of Christ.)
What has he done for her? or rather what has he not done against her? The Sea. 17.
distinction of Imperial and Ministerial Spouse, cannot here serve the turn.
As the metaphor of an head, so much less the metaphor of a Spouse will admit a
ministerial Spouse. As he is an adulterer that takes upon him to be a
ministerial husband, so is she an adulteress that yields her self to such
an one. The Apostle says, I have espoused you to ONE husband. 2 Cor. 11 2.


. 92. Of the false Sacrament of Marriage.
The other error is, that Marriage is a Sacrament: the maine ground whereof they
have taken from this text, which ground by the Apostles application of this
mystery to Christ and the Church, is as plainly removed, as if the Apostle had
purposely ordered his style, to prevent this erroneous collection: as if he had
said, That none may mistake this mystery, and apply it to a matrimonial
conjunction of man and woman together, know that I mean no such thing: the
mystery which I speak of, is concerning Christ and the Church. I marvel how
they dare misapply that which is so plainly expressed. Though the Apostle had
not so clearly showed his mind and meaning, yet the very thing it self
would lead us so to judge of it. For, that which in Christ Quod est in Christo
and in Ecclesia magnum, hoc in singulis quibusque viris and vxoribus minimum.
Aug. de nupt. and concup. lib. 1. cap. 21.
and the Church is a great mystery, in man and wife is but a small matter. The
vulgar Latin translation first led them into this error, for it translateth
the word mystery, a Sacrament. But a translation is no sufficient ground to
prove a doctrine. Besides the word Sacrament used by that Translator, has as
large an extent as a mystery: if they should make every thing which he
translateth Sacrament, a proper Sacrament of the Church, there would be many
more Sacraments then the Papists themselves do make.

1. As for this supposed Sacrament, no Papist could ever show when or where God
ordained it to be a Sacrament. Nay, they agree not among themselves about the
time, how long it has been a Sacrament. Alphons. a Castro contr. haer. lib. 3.
Some of them hold, that ever since the first institution of marriage in
Paradise, it has been a Sacrament. But the greater number of Papists hold it
to be a Sacrament Petrus a Soto de Matr. lect. 2. Council. Trident. Sess. 24.
Can. 1.
of the new Testament under the Gospel, because their Tridentine Council has
so decreed it. Where we may note how the greater number of them, when two
absurdities are questioned, are ready to fall into the worst. Under the Law
the nonage of the Church needed, and had more Sacraments then under the
Gospel: yet that which was in use as much under the Law as under the Gospel,
and had then as much to make it a Sacrament as now, was then none, yet now is
one.

2. As they cannot show where it was ordained for a Sacrament, so neither can
they show what is the Sacramental sign thereof. Some make carnal copulation
to be it. But there may be a true marriage, though the parties married never know
each other.

Others make the Parents giving to be the sign. But they hold that that is a
true marriage, which is done without parents consent.

Others the Priests blessing. Yet they hold the marriage of Infidels and
Heretics who have no Priests, to be a true marriage.

Others, the consent of the parties themselves. Thus shall a party administer
a Sacrament to himself.

Others, other things. Thus they wanting the light of Gods word, one strayeth
in one by-path, another in another, and none of them hit upon the right.

3. A like difference there is about the form of this Sacrament.

4. If other positions delivered by them concerning matrimony be noted, a man
would think that they should be far from making it a Sacrament. They
prefer virginity before it. Yea, they account it a kind of pollution. They
hold it unlawful for Priests, Monks, Nuns, and such like holy orders (as they
esteem them) to marie: so as there is a Sacrament, whereof their holy ones may
not partake. The order of Priesthood is a Sacrament (in their account) yet that
order keeps from marriage, so as one Sacrament fights against another. Yea,
Infidels may be partakers of a Sacrament, and so their holy and precious things
shall be denied to their holy ones, and cast unto swine. Thus we see a rotten
building erected upon a sandy foundation: a false Sacrament established upon a
false application of this text. Can it then stand?

. 93. Of the Sum of husbands and wives duties.
EPHESIANS. 5. 33. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his
wife, even as himself: and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
THe Apostle having made a large digression about the mutual relation betwixt
Christ and the Church, whom he propounded as patterns to husbands and wives,
he now returns to the maine point intended, namely to the duties of husbands
and wives: and so much does the first particle imply (Nevertheless) as if he
had thus said, Though I have a little digressed (...).
into the mystery of the union of Christ and the Church, yet nevertheless do
ye, o husbands and wives, call to mind that which I principally aimed at, even
your duties.

This verse then contains a conclusion of the Apostles discourse, concerning
the duties of husbands and wives.

Two points are especially noted therein. 1. A declaration of their several
and distinct duties. 2. A direction to apply their own proper duties each of
them to themselves.


Their distinct duties are noted in two words, Love. Fear.

These two, as they are distinct duties in themselves, so are they also common
conditions which must be annexed to all other duties. Love as sugar to sweeten
the duties of authority, which appertain to an husband. Fear as salt to
season all the duties of subjection which appertain to a wife. The Apostle
therefore has set them down as two marks for husbands and wives to aim at in
every thing wherein they have to deal one with the other.

Of these I will more distinctly speak in the treatises of the particular
duties of husbands and wives.

. 94. Of applying the word to our selves.
The direction for a particular application of their own proper duties to
either of them is here especially to be noted. In this direction two things are
to be observed.

1. That every particular person apply to himself that which by a Minister is
indefinitly delivered to all. Every one (...).
of you in particular, says the Apostle: which is as much as if he had thus
more largely expressed his mind, I have laid down such general duties as all
husbands and wives without exception of any of what rank or degree soever they
be are bound unto; which though by name I have not severally delivered to
every one, one by one, but generally to you all, yet do every one of you
apply those things to your selves in particular.

2. That every one apply his own peculiar duty unto himself. Love being
peculiar to an husband, to him he says, Let him love his wife: and reverence
being peculiar to a wife, to her he says, let the wife see that she reverence
her husband.

The direction in every of those several Epistles which were sent to the seven
Churches of Asia, (in these words, He that Reu. 2. 7.
has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches) does teach
every member in any of those Churches to apply to himself that which was
delivered to the whole Church: so does a like Luke 8. 8.
exhortation which Christ with an exclamation made to the people whom he taught
in parables: and this declaration of the extent of Christ's counsel, what I say
to Mar. 13. 37.
you, I say to all. To this purpose many precepts given to whole Churches, and
to all sorts of people are set down in the singular number as given to one,
as, Awake THOU that Ephesians. 5. 14.
sleep. THOU stand by faith: be not thou high minded etc. Romans 11. 20.


The life and power of Gods word consists in this particular Reason. The life
of Gods word in application.
application thereof unto our selves. This is to mix faith with hearing:
faith, I say, whereby we do not only believe the truth of Gods word in
general, but also believe it to be a truth concerning our selves in
particular: and thus will every precept thereof be a good instruction and
direction on to us to guide us in the way of righteousness: every promise
therein will be a great encouragement, and consolation to us to uphold us, and
to make us hold on: and every judgment threatened therein will be a curb, and
bridle to hold us in, and to keep us from those sins against which the
judgments are threatened. But otherwise, if we bring not the word home to our
own souls, it will be as a word spoken into the air, 1 Cor. 14 9.
vanishing away without any profit to us. Nothing makes the word less
profitable, then the putting of it off from our selves to others, thinking that
it concerns others more then our selves.

That we may make the better use of this doctrine, let us observe both what are
general duties belonging to all Christians, and apply them as particular to
our selves: and also what duties appertain to such persons as are of our
place, calling, and condition, and more especially apply them to our selves:
let all manner of husbands, and all manner of wives of what rank or degree
soever they be that shall read the duties hereafter following, know that they
are spoken to them in particular. Let Kings and Queens, Lords and Ladies,
Ministers and their wives, Rich men and their wives, Poor men and their wives,
Old men and their wives, Young men and their wives, all of all sorts take them
as spoken to them in particular. It is not honor, wealth, learning, or any
other excellency, nor means of place, poverty, want of learning, or any other
like thing that can exempt an husband from loving his wife, or a wife from
reuerencing her husband. He that says every one, excepteth not any one.
Therefore every one in particular do ye so. The like application may be made
to all Parents and children, Masters and servants, concerning their duties.

. 95. Of every ones looking to his own duty especially.
In the forenamed application an eye must be had rather to the duty which we
owe, and ought to be performed by us to others, then to that which is due to
us, and others ought to perform to us: for the Apostle says not to the
husband, see that thy wife reverence thee, but see that thou love her: so to
the wife.

For this purpose the holy Ghost presses particular duties upon those
particular persons who ought to perform them: as Subjection on wives: love on
husbands: and so in others. This therefore is especially to be considered of
thee, how thou Vnum duntaxat tibi considerandum est, quo pacto te praestes
innoxium. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
may show thy self blameless. I deny not but that one ought to provoke
another, and one to help another in what they can to perform their duty,
especially superiors who have charge over others, but the most principal care
of every one ought to be for himself, and greatest conscience to be made of
performing his own duty.

1. It is more acceptable before God, and more commendable Reasons.
before men to do duty, then to exact duty. As in matters of free charity, so
also of bounden duty, It is more blessed to Act. 20. 35.
give, then to receive. In particular it is better for an husband to be a good
husband, then to have a good wife: so for a wife. To have others fail in duty
to us may be an heavy cross, for us to fail in our duty to others is a
fearful curse.

2. Every one is to give an account of his own particular Romans 14. 12.
duty. That which the Prophet speaks of father and son, may be applied to
husband and wife, and to all other sorts of people, If a father do that which
is lawful and right, he is just, he Ezec. 18. 5. etc.
shall surely live: if he beget a son that does not so, he shall surely die,
his blood shall be upon him. Again, if a father do that which is not good, he
shall die in his iniquity: but if his son do that which is lawful and right
he shall surely live. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon
himself: and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. That this
shall be so betwixt husband and wife, may be gathered out of these words, Two
shall Luke 17. 34.
be in one bed, the one shall be taken, the other left.

Let this be noted against the common vain apologies which are made for
neglect of duty, which is this, Duty is not performed to me, why shall I do
duty? when my husband does his duty, I will do mine, says the wife. And I
mine, says the husband, when my wife does hers. What if he never do his
duty, and so be damned, will thou never do thine? This looking for of duty
at others hands, makes us the more careless of our own.

Do you therefore O husbands look especially to your Use.
own duties, do you love your wives: and you o wives look Non quae alijs
data sunt praecepta quaerimus quando alicuius criminis ac. cusamur. Chrysostom. loc.
citat.
you to yours especially, do you reverence your husbands. For this end, let
husbands read those duties most diligently which concern husbands, and wives
those, which concern wives. Let not the husband say of the wives duties, there
are goodlessons for my wife, and neglect his own: nor the wife say the like of
husbands duties, and not regard her own. This is it that makes the subjection
of many wives very harsh and irksome to them, because their husbands that urge
and press them thereto show little, or no love to them at all: and this is it
that makes many husbands very backwards in showing love, because their wives
which expect much love, show little or no reverence to their husbands.
Wherefore Let every one of you in particular so love his wife, even as
himself: and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

. 96. Of the meaning of the first verse of the sixth Chapter.
FRom those particular duties which concern husbands and wives the Apostle
proceeds to lay down such as concern children and parents. As before he laid
down wives duties before husbands, so here he begins with childrens (who
are inferior to their parents) and that for the same reasons which were
rendered. 10.
before.

Besides children are the fruits of matrimonial conjunction, therefore fitly
placed next unto Man and Wife.

That which concerns children is laid down in the sixth Chapter of Ephesians. verse.
1, 2, 3. The meaning whereof we will distinctly open.

EPHESIANS. 6. 1. Children obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

The first word (children) is in the original as proper a word (...).
at could be used, for according to the notation of it, it signifies such as
are begotten and borne. Answerable is the other word (parents) which signifies
such as beget and bring forth (...). Who are to be accounted children, who
parents.
children. Yet are they not so strictly to be taken as if none but such as
begat and brought forth, or such as are begotten and brought forth of them were
meant: for under the title parents, he includes all such as are in the place
of natural parents, as Grandfathers and Grandmothers, Fathers in law, and
Mothers in law, Foster-fathers and Foster-mothers, Guardians, Tutors, and such
like governors: and under the title children he compriseth Grandchildren,
Sons and daughters in law, Wards, Pupils, and such like. For there is an
honor and a subjection due by all who are in place of children, to all such as
are in place of parents, though in a different kind, as we shall Treat. 5..
56, 57, etc. (...).
after show. This word children which in the original is of the neuter gender,
does further include both sexes, males and females, sons and daughters: so as
either of them are as carefully to apply the duties here set forth to
themselves as if in particular both kinds had been expressed.

He expresses parents in the plural number, to show that he (...).
means here also both sexes father and mother, as the law expresses both:
and adds this relative particle your, as by way (...).
of restraint, to show that every child is not bound to every parent, so by way
of extent to show that whatsoever the estate of parents be honorable or mean,
rich or poor, learned or unlearned, etc. their own children must not be
ashamed of them, but yield all bounden duty to them: if they be parents to
children, they must be honored by children.

The word (Obey) under which all duties of children are (...).
comprised, according to the Greek notation, signifies with an humble
submission to hearken, that is, to attend and give heed to the commandments,
reproves, directions, and exhortations which are given to them, and that with
such a reverend respect of the parties who deliver them, as they make
themselves conformable thereto.

A duty proper to inferiors, and implies both reverence and obedience: the
(...).
verb notes out Obedience; the (...).
preposition, Reverence.

Under this word (Obey) the Apostle comprehends all All duties of children
comprised under obedience.
those duties which thorowout the Scripture are required of children: as is
manifest by his own exemplification thereof in the second verse by the word
honor which the law uses: so as this word (obey) is to be taken in as large
an extent as that word (honor.)

Quest. Why is obedience put for all the rest?
Answ. 1. Because it is the hardest of all the rest, and that which children
are loathest to perform they who willingly yield to this, will stick at no
duty.

2. Because it is the surest evidence of that honor which a child owes to
his parent: and so of performing the fifth commandment.

3. Because children are bound to their parents: the duties which they perform
are not of courtesy, but necessity. Their parents have power to command, and
exact them.

The clause added (in the Lord) is in effect the same which (...).
was used Chap. 5. verse. 22.
before (as unto the Lord) and it notes forth a limitation, direction, and
instigation: a limitation showing that childrens obedience to their parents is
to be restrained to the obedience which they owe to Christ, and may not go
beyond the limits thereof: a direction showing that in obeying their parents,
they must have an eye to Christ, and so obey them as Christ may approve
thereof: an instigation showing that parents bear the image of Christ, and in
that respect children must the rather obey their parents.

The last clause of this verse (for this is right) is an express (...).
reason to enforce the forenamed point of obedience: and it is drawn from
equity: and shows that it is a point agreeable to all law: yea that in way of
recompense it is due: and if children be not obedient to parents they do that
which is most unjust, they defraud their parents of their right.

The former phrase (in the Lord) implying one reason, this plainly notes out
another, as the first particle (for) declares.

. 97. Of the meaning of the second verse.
EPHESIANS. 6. 2. Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment
with promise.)
THe very words of the fifth commandment are here alleged Why the moral law
is alleged.
by the Apostle as a confirmation of the forenamed reason, that, it is just and
right to obey parents, because God in the moral law enioyneth as much. The law
is more general then the Apostles precept: for the law compriseth under it all
those duties which all kind of inferiors owe to their superiors, whether
they be in family, church, or common wealth: but the Apostles precept is given
only to one kind of inferiors in the family: yet the argument is very sound
and good from a general to a particular, thus, All inferiors must A genere ad
speciem.
honor their superiors, therefore children their parents.

By adding the express words of the law the Apostle shows that the
subjection which he required of children is no yoke which he of his own head
put on their necks: but that which the moral law has put on them: so as this
may be noted as a third reason, namely Gods express charge in his moral law.

If I should handle this law according to the full extent thereof, I should
wander too far from the Apostles scope. I will therefore open it no further
then it may concern the point in hand, viz. the duty of children.

Honor compriseth here all those duties which children in Honor compriseth
all childrens duties.
any respect owe to their parents. It implies both an inward reverend
estimation, and also an outward dutiful submission. Yea it implies also
recompense, and maintenance.

Honor in relation to parents, is used for two reasons especially.

1. To show that parents bear Gods image: for honor is properly due to God
alone: to the creature it is due, only as it stands in Gods room, and
carries his image.

2. To show, that it is an honor to parents to have dutiful children: even as
it is a dishonor to them to have disobedient children.

Both father and mother are expressly mentioned, to take away Why both father
and mother expressed.
all pretense from children of neglecting either of them: for through the
corruption of nature we are prone to seek after many shifts to exempt us from
our bounden duty; and if not in whole, yet in as great a part as we can. Some
might think if they honor their father, who is their mothers head, they have
done what the law requires: others may think they have done as much, if they
honor their mother who is the weaker vessel: but the law expressing father
and mother, condemns him that neglects either of them. Yet to show that if
opposition should arise betwixt them, and by reason thereof both could not be
obeyed together, the father commanding what the mother forbids, the father
is to be preferred, (especially if it be not against the Lord) the father is
set in the first place.

These words following (which is the first commandment How the fifth
commandment is the first with promise.
with promise) are fitly included in a parenthesis, because they are not the
words of the law, but inserted by the Apostle as a reason to enforce the law,
and so make a fourth reason.

Quest. In what respect is this commandment called the first with promise?
Answ. 1. The * word here used by the Apostle properly (...).
signifies an affirmative precept, as our English word (commandment) does.
Now then of the affirmative precepts it is the first with promise.

2. The Scripture often appropriateth the law to the second table, as where he
says he that loves another has fulfilled the Romans 13 8.
law, and so in other places.

Now this is the first commandment of the second table.

3. It is generally true of all the commandments: for among the ten it is the
first with promise.

Object. The second commandment has a promise annexed Difference betwixt the
promise in the second, and fist commandment.
to it.
Answ. 1. That which is annexed to the second Commandment, is not expressly a
promise, but rather a declaration of Gods Justice, in taking vengeance of
transgressors, and of his mercy in rewarding obseruers of the Law: yet I deny
not but that a promise by consequence is implied: but here it is expressed.

2. The promise there implied is only a general promise made to obseruers of
the whole Law, and therefore he uses the plural number, Commandments: but
here is a particular promise made to them that keep this Commandment in
particular.

2. Quest. Why is it then said the first, when no other Commandments with
promise follow? First simply taken.

Answ. This particle (first) has not always reference to some other
following, but is often simply taken, to show that none was before it: so is the
word firstborn used in the Law: Exodus 13. 2. Matthew. 1. 25.
and so Christ is called the firstborn Son of Marie.

The word promise shows, that this fourth reason includes some benefit
redounding to those children themselves that honor their parents: the benefit
is expressly mentioned in the next verse, which we will afterward distinctly
consider.

. 98. Of aiming at our own, in seeking the good of others.
Here in general we may note, that

It is not unlawful to aim at our own good and benefit in doing the duties
which God requires at our hands to others: for that which God himself
propounds and sets before us, we may seek and aim at. Many like promises
there be in Scripture, and many approved prayers grounded on those promises
whereby the truth of the doctrine is confirmed unto us. Hezekiah Isa. 38. 2, 3.
makes the good service he had done to God and his Church, a ground to obtain
longer life: so others.

For God lays no duty on any man, but therein he aims at the good of him
who performs the duty as well as of him to whom the duty is performed.
Whereby he would show that his Commandments are no strait yokes and heavy
burdens, but means of procuring their good who fulfill them.

How highly does this commend the good respect that 1. Use.
God bears to all the sons of men: seeking their good in every place
wherein he sets them, either of authority, or subjection?

How ought this to stir us up willingly and cheerfully to 2. Use.
observe the Laws which God commands us, and perform the services he
requires of us, seeing thereby we procure our own good?

How fully may this satisfy, and even stop the mouths of 3. Use.
all such as are discontent with their places, and mutter against that
subjection which God enioyneth to them?

What a good direction and resolution may this be to many, 4. Use.
who being moved in conscience to seek the good of others, doubt whether
therein they may aim at their own good or no? To make this case clear by an
instance, which may serve in stead of many. A Minister faithful in his place,
and very painful, and in that respect of a good conscience, but withal of a
tender and weak conscience, doubts whether thereby he may seek maintenance
to himself, fearing that so he seeks himself, and not simply the
edification of Gods Church. But by the forenamed doctrine we see that both may
be aimed at: for God commands the one, and promises the other. As we have
one eye on Gods Commandment for direction, so we may have another on his
promise for encouragement.

Yet because through the corruption of our nature, we are too Cautions in
seeking our own good.
prone to seek our selves, some cautions are in this point carefully to be
observed.

1. That we seek not our own good by any transgression, for it is promised
unto obedience.

2. That we do not so wholly seek our selves and our own good, as we neglect
others: for God having joined both together, no man may put them asunder.

3. That we aim at our own good, as a reward following upon the duty which
God commands, and so be as willing to do the duty, as desirous of the
reward.

4. That our own benefit be not the only, no nor the chiefest thing we aim at
in doing our duty, but rather come as a motive to add an edge, and to sharpen
other motives of greater moment. And thus much the order which the Apostle
observes in setting down his reasons, notes unto us: for the three former
have respect to God, and to that good conscience which children ought to carry
toward him: the first points at Gods image which parents carry (in the
Lord:) the second sets forth that right which God has prescribed to
children: the third declares Gods charge: this fourth only, which is the last,
has respect to the profit and benefit of children themselves.

. 99. Of preferring honesty before commodity.
From the forenamed order we may further gather, that Equity and good
conscience ought more to move us to do our duty then our own profit, and the
benefit that thereby redoundeth to us. If there should come such an opposition
betwixt these that they could not both stand togethet, but that for doing that
which is right, and which God has commanded, our prosperity must be hindered
and life shortened, we should so stand to that which is right and commanded of
God, as prosperity, life and all be let go. To this purpose tend all the
exhortations in Scripture, to forsake goods, lands, life, and every thing else
for righteousness sake. So clear is this point, Cic. lib. 2. de Offic. and
Paradox. 1.
that the Heathen discerned it by the glimpse of that light of nature which
they had: for they could say, that that which is honest and right, is to be
preferred before that which is commodious and profitable.

There is no comparison betwixt honesty and commodity, right and profit. The
one is absolutely necessary for attaining to eternal salvation, the other
gives but a little quiet and contentment in this world: nay, if profit be
without right, it can give no true contentment or quiet at all.

Unworthy therefore they are of the name of Christians, who Use.
so wholly and only aim at their outward profit and prosperity, as they
regard not what is right, and what God has commanded. If by obeying God, and
doing that which is right they may reap some benefit to themselves they can be
content Nihil bonum Scriptura nisi quod honestum asserit. Ambr. Offic. lib. 2.
cap. 3.
to yield thereunto: but if not, farewell all right, farewell all Gods
commandments. Though they think every thing that is profitable, be it right
or wrong, to be good, yet Gods word accounts nothing good but that which is
honest: such therefore can look for no blessing from the Lord.

. 100. Of the meaning of the third verse.
EPHESIANS. 6. 3. That it may be well with thee, and thou may live long on the
earth.


THe promise mentioned before in general, is here particularly set down. The
first words (that it may be well with thee) are not in the Hebrew text Exodus
20. 12.
there where the Law is first recorded, and thereupon not set in that usual
form of the ten Commandments, which is in use among us: but yet in Deuteronomy. 5.
16.
another place where the Law is repeated, they are set down: and the Greek
translation, commonly called the Septuagint (which (as is probable) the Church
in the Apostles time used) has expressly noted it in both places. Now this part
of the promise (that it may be well with thee) is prefixed as an amplification
of the other part concerning long life, which is the most principal thing
intended, as appears in that it only is mentioned where the Law is first
recorded. It shows that the long life Longlife and prosperity joined
together.
which God promises, shall not be a life of woe and misery, (for then were it
no blessing, but the longer life lasted, the worse it would be) but a life full
of comfort and happiness: therefore Moses fetteth this former clause in the
latter place after long life thus (that thy days may be prolonged, and that it
Deuteronomy. 5. 16.
may go well with thee) to show that the well being here spoken of, is an
amplification of the benefit of long life.

Whereas the Apostle sets down the place where the benefit of this promise
is to be enjoyed in a most large phrase, thus (on earth) the Law brings it to
a more narrow compass thus (in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee)
meaning the land of Canaan which was given of God as a peculiar inheritance to
the Jews: so that the promise (as the Law sets it down in peculiar to the
Jews) implies long life, and prosperity in their own inheritance: for long
life to the Jews was counted no life out of their own Country. But the
Apostle writing to all nations, leaves out that description of Canaan, and
retains only the general substance in this word (on earth) which he sets
down to show that even outward prosperity, and a long life in this world is
here promised.

. 101. Of prosperity: how far forth it may be a blessing.
For further clearing of this text, and for better application thereof, I will
resolve sundry questions arising out of it, and gather such profitable
instructions as it affords.

The promise consists of two branches.

The first branch (that it may be well with thee) is very ample (...).
and large: all good things, all manner of blessings whatsoever, spiritual and
temporal, belonging to soul and body, concerning this life, and the life to
come, make to a man's wellbeing. Whence may first be demanded;

1. Qust. What may be the extent of this phrase in this place? Temporal
prosperity promised. 1 Timothy 4. 8.

Answ. It may generally be extended to all manner of good things. For
Godliness has promise of the life that now is and of that that is to come.
But (as I take it) temporal prosperity is here principally intended: and that
for these reasons.

1. It is joined with long life, which is a temporal blessing.

2. The last word (on earth) may be referred to this branch of well-being, as
well as to the other of long life.

3. In the Law (from whence this clause is taken) it is expressly set down,
thus, that it may go well with thee in the Deuteronomy. 5. 16.
land, etc.

2. Quest. Is then outward temporal prosperity (as honor, Prosperity a good
thing.
health, peace, liberty, goods, etc.) a token of Gods love and favor?
Answ. Yea: in it self it is a blessing, and fruit of Gods love: as appears
by these reasons.

1. As at first it was made and ordained of God, it is a good thing.

2. It tends to man's good, if it be rightly used.

3. It was bestowed on man before he had offended.

4. It is promised of God as a reward to them that fear him Leuit. 26. 4. etc.
Deuteronomy. 28. 1. etc.
and keep his Commandments.

5. The Saints have prayed for it, and have been thankful Genesis 28. 20. and
32. 10, 11.
for it.

6. The contrary was first inflicted as a punishment of sin, Leuit. 26. 15.
etc.
and is often threatened as a token of Gods wrath, and so has also been
inflicted on transgressors. Deuteronomy. 28. 16. etc.


. 102. Of prosperity bestowed on the wicked, how it proves a curse.
3. Quest. Why then is it bestowed upon the wicked, even such as are (...).
haters of God, and are hated of him? And why are Gods friends, such as are
(...).
loved of him, and love him again, deprived thereof? This sore scruple made
David stumble, Psalm. 73. 13. Ier. 12. 1. Hab. 1. 3.
and moved other Prophets to complain. But the answer is ready.

Answ. Outward prosperity is of that nature, as it may turn to the good or
hurt of him that enjoys it. And herein is Gods admirable and unsearchable
wisdom seen, in that he is able to turn blessings into curses, and curses
into blessings. How prosperity proves a curse to the wicked.
He can work by contraries.

4. Quest. How is prosperity a curse to the wicked?
Answ. By mere consequence, through their abuse of it. God gives it to them to
show the riches of his mercy: and that all may taste thereof, he does good to
the evil and the good. Besides, Matthew. 5. 45. Romans 2. 4.
he thus tries if by any means they may be brought to repentance: which gift
because they have not, their prosperity proves to be a means to make them
the more inexcusable, and the more to increase their just condemnation. For the
more Gods blessings abound toward them, the more they abuse them, adding to
all their other sins, that most odious sin of ingratitude, which makes up
the heap of all. And in these respects I may say of the prosperity of the
wicked, as the Prophet of their King, God gives it in his anger, and takes it
away in Ose. 13. 11.
his wrath. For by their abuse thereof, it proves Satan's bait to allure them,
his snare to catch them, and his hook to drown 1 Timothy 6. 9.
them in perdition and destruction. In a word therefore, the wicked are fed in
a fair pasture like oxen appointed to the slaughter: they are exalted on high,
as on a ladder or scaffold, like thieves and traitors, to be brought down with
shame and destruction, as Pharaohs Baker was lift up. Genesis 40. 19.


. 103. How both having, and wanting prosperity is a blessing to the Saints.
5. Quest. How is the inioying, or wanting of prosperity a blessing to the
righteous?
Answ. God in wisdom knowing what is best for them accordingly deals with
them, he bestows prosperity on them so far as he sees it will turn unto
their good: and denies it to them so far as he sees it will turn to their
hurt. Whenever therefore God bestows any temporal blessing on his Saints,
it is a token of his favor: and whenever he denies any, the very denial is
also a fruit of his favor. Herein is it verified that All things work
together for good to them Romans 8. 28.
that love God, so as, if they abound, it shall go well with them: if they
want, it shall go well with them: if they be in high place, it shall go well
with them: if in mean place, it shall got well with them: if they be at
liberty, if in prison: if they be in health, if sick: in what estate soever,
it shall go well with them.

6. Quest. How is it then that Saints are often brought to such extermities that
they are forced to complain that it is very Complaints of Saints impeach not
their well being.
ill with them?

Answ. There is flesh and blood in them, by reason of the weakness whereof
they are forced to complain: but the present apprehension of weak flesh, is
not sufficient to impeach the truth of Gods promise: they consider not in their
present extremity what is Gods mind, what his manner of dealing with them,
how needful it is that so they should be dealt withal, what end and issue the
Lord will give: in truth it is better with them then they wot of. Some weighty
reasons there be which move God to bring them to that extremity wherein they
are, and those respecting his Job. 9. 3. 2 Cor. 12. 9.
own glory, or the Epb. 3. 1.
edification of others, or their own good, as Psalm. 119. 67
curing some dangerous disease, Job 1. 12.
manifesting the grace of God bestowed upon them, Ose 5. 15.
drawing them nearer to God, 2 Cor. 5. 2.
making them long the more for heaven, with the like.

. 104. Of long-life: how far forth it is a blessing.
Concerning the second branch of Gods promise (long-life) other questions are
to be resolved.

1. Quest. Is long-life a blessing? Long life a blessing.

Answ. Yea, else would not God here and in other places have promised it as a
reward, nor have bestowed it on his Saints.

The reasons to prove it to be a blessing may be drawn to three heads. 1. Gods
glory. 2. the good of the Church where they live. 3. their own good.

1. Gods glory is much advanced by the long life of the Saints: for the longer
they live the more they do themselves observe Gods wonderful works, and the
more they do make them known and declare them to others. But in the grave all
Psalm. 6. 5. Isa. 38. 18.
is forgotten.

2. Gods Church is greatly edified thereby: in which respect the Apostle says,
to abide in the flesh is more needful for Phil. 1. 24.
you: In the Saints that is true which Elihu says should be, namely that days
speak, and multitude of years teach wisdom. Job. 32. 7.
The longer the Saints live, the more good they do: but after death they do
none: when the night comes no man can work: Job. 9. 4.
Gal. 6. 10.
upon which ground the Apostle exhorts to do good while we have time.

3. The Saints by long living purchase to themselves great honor, and dignity
among Gods people, and a strong steadfast confidence in God. Men regard a good
old servant: much more will God. Two strong props have old Saints to establish
them, and make them bold: one is a remembrance of Gods former favors, whereby
their hope of eternal life is made more sure unto them: another is a kind of
present expectation of the accomplishment of Gods promises which they have long
waited for.

By this it appears that this particular promise is no light matter, of small
moment: but a strong motive to stir up children to obedience.

. 105. Of long life proving a curse to the wicked.
2. Quest.
Why then is long life given to many wicked ones? and why are many Saints cut
off?

Answ. Long life is of the same kind that prosperity is: it may be turned to
a curse, as well as prove a blessing.

The wicked by living long on earth make their sins grow to the full (as is
implied of the Amorite) they make their Genesis 15. 16.
name to stink the more on earth, as a carrion the longer it remains above
ground the more it stinketh: and they cause the greater torment in hell to be
inflicted upon them: for as Romans 2. 5.
sin is increased, so shall that torment be increased.

The righteous have their days shortened for their good, when they are
shortened, and that in these, and such like respects 1. That they may be 1 King.
14. 13.
taken from the evil to come. 2. That they might be made an 1 King. 13. 14.
example to others. 3. Isa. 17. 1.
That 1 Cor. 11. 32.
by a temporal death eternal condemnation might be avoided. 4. That their
Genesis 5. 24. Heb. 11. 5.
chiefest and greatest reward might be hastened.


. 106. Of limiting the promises of temporal blessings.
Thus we see there may be just cause to alter, as the former branch of this
promise, prosperity, so the latter branch of it, long-life, and yet no wrong
thereby redound to the righteous, nor benefit to the wicked.

3. Quest.
Is not the truth of the promise impeached thereby?

Answ. No whit at all. For first all promises of temporal blessings are
limited with such a condition as this, if the performance of it may stand with
Gods honor, and the good of the party to whom it is made. 2. God does never
simply deprive his Saints of that which is promised, but only in stead of it
gives a better: as in taking away wealth, he gives the more store of grace:
in restraining liberty of body, he gives freedom of conscience: with
affliction he gives patience: by taking away this temporal life, he gives
eternal life. God herein deals, as if one who having promised so much iron,
should in stead thereof give as much silver: or for silver give gold: and so
for one pound give the worth of hundreds or thousands.

. 107. Of appropriating prosperity and long-life to the obedience which
children yield to their parents.
4. Quest. Why is long-life and prosperity appropriated to this kind of
righteousness?
Answ. It is not so appropriated to this, as if it appertained to no other: for
it is elsewhere in general promised to the Deuteronomy. 6. 2.
obseruers of the whole law, and to other particular branches thereof beside
this: yet in these and such like particular respects Psalm. 34. 12, 13, 14.
is it applied to the obedience of children.

1. Because obedience to parents is one of the surest evidences of our
conformity to the whole law: in that thereby we show our respect of Gods image,
and lay a good foundation for the performing of all duty to man.

2. Because a childs performing of his duty to his parents is under God an
especial means that they do well, and live long (for as rebellious children
make their parents with grief to come the sooner to their graves, so dutiful
children make them to continue the longer in prosperity) the Lord in recompense
promises to such a child prosperity and long life.

3. Because parents are an especial means to procure the welfare and long
life of their children, partly by their provident care, as Noami said to Ruth,
shall I not seek rest for thee, Rut. 3. 1.
that it may be well with thee? and partly by their instant prayer: for the
faithful prayer of parents is of great force with God for dutiful children:
whence has risen the custom of childrens asking their parents blessing, and
of parents blessing their children. In this respect the law thus sets forth
the blessing of the fifth commandment, they shall prolong thy days. (...)


4. Because disobedience to parents brings much mischief on childrens heads,
and often shorteneth their days, and that many ways.

1. In that parents are often provoked by their childrens disobedience How
disobedient children hinder their welfare and shorten their days.
to disinherit them, at least to allow them the less portion, so as hereby it
goes not so well with them: yea some are provoked to bring their rebellious
children to the Magistrate, who by Gods law was to cut them off, so as Deuteronomy.
21. 21.
thereby their life is shortened.

2. In that parents are provoked to complain unto God of their childrens
disobedience, and God thereby moved both to lay heavy judgments upon such
children in their life time, and also to shorten their days: for parents
complaint does make a loud cry in Gods ears. It is said that God by cutting
off Abimelech with an untimely death rendered the Judge. 9. 5 6.
wickedness which he did to his father.

3. In that, when parents are too indulgent over their children, God does
punish the sin both of parent and child, by shortning the childs days.
Instance the examples of 1 Samuel 2. 34.
Hophni and Phinehas, 2 Samuel 18. 14.
Absalom, and 1 King. 2. 25.
Adonijah.

4. In that disobedience to parents, is a sin that seldom goes alone: for
an undutiful child is commonly a very lewd person many other ways.
Considering the prouenesse of our nature to all sin, it cannot be avoided but
that they who in the beginning shake off the yoke of government, should run
headlong into all riot, looseness, and licentiousness: thus then sin being
added unto sin, it must needs bring mischief upon mischief, till at length
life be cut off.

Wherefore in that these mischiefs are avoided by performing due obedience to
parents, it may well be said that it shall be well with obedient children, and
they shall live long.

. 108. Of Gods ordering his favors so as they may appear to be true blessings.
The particular branches of Gods promise having been How fitly prosperity and
long life are joined together.
distinctly opened, we will consider them jointly together, for they do
exceedingly amplify one another: prosperity sweetens long life and makes it
acceptable: otherwise to live long, namely in misery and wretchedness, is very
irksome and grievous. Again, long life added to prosperity makes it so much
the greater blessing. For a good thing the longer it continues the better it
is. If prosperity were but as a flower, soon gone, the very thought of the
vanity thereof would much diminish the joy and comfort of it. But both of them
joined together, do show that this is no small blessing which is promised.

From the connection of them both together, I observe that

God so orders his favors as they appear to be true blessings, God makes
his savors true blessings. Genesis 17. 19.
tending indeed to the good of those upon whom he bestows them. Thus when God
gave Abraham a son, he established his covenant with him, that this gift
might be a true blessing.

The like I might instance in all the children of promise, as Sampson, Solomon,
John Baptist, etc. So in other favors. When God added fifteen years to
Hezekiahs life, he also promised Isa. 38. 5, 6. and 39. 8.
him deliverance from his enemies, and peace, and truth all his days: And when
God gave David a kingdom, he gave him 2 Samuel 7. 9. etc.
great victories and long life, and established his kingdom to his posterity:
so also dealt he with Solomon. But not to insist on any more particulars,
excellently is this doctrine confirmed in the 28 Psalm.

Thus God will show that in love he bestows even the temporal blessings
which he gives to his Saints, that accordingly they may esteem them, and that
their hearts may be the more enlarged both to admire his goodness, and to be
thankful for the same.

This use we must make of those things which the Lord is 1. Use.
pleased to bestow upon us, as of long life, good health, honor, peace,
plenty, liberty, and all prosperity: we must receive and use them as God
bestows them, namely as tokens of his favor: and thereby be the more stirred
up to perform the duties he requires of us, and not abuse them to his
dishonor and our own hurt: but rather so as he may have honor, and we profit
thereby.

. 109. Of Gods high account of dutiful children.
More particularly by this promise we may learn what high 2. Use.
esteem, and great account God makes of dutiful children, and of that
obedience which they perform to their parents: which ought so much the more to
provoke children to all obedience, if at least they have any care of Gods
favor, and of the tokens of his love. Oh consider this all ye that have
parents to honor: consider how careful, how earnest God is every way by all
means to draw you to obedience: he contents not himself to urge the equity of
the point, the place of your parent, the charge that himself has given, but
most presses your own profit: and that not only in hope for the time to come,
but even in present fruition for this life: and that because we through our
childishness are most affected with things sensible and present: dealing with
us as a tender father who provides not only a good calling, and a fair in
heritance for his child, but gives him also plums, pears, and such things as
for the present he is delighted withal, the more to allure him.

. 110. Of childrens doing good to themselves by honoring their parents.
Children may further learn out of this promise, that in 3. Use.
performing their duty they do good not only to their parents, but also to
themselves: they procure their own welfare and long-life. What egregious
fools then are disobedient children: they regard neither God, their parents,
nor themselves, but deprive themselves of their eternal happiness, hinder
their welfare, and shorten their days. Fitly hereupon I may apply to
undutiful children these words of the Psalmist, Mark the obedient child, for
the end of him is peace: Psalm. 37 37, 38.
but the rebellious shall be destroyed: he shall be cut off: and these of the
wiseman, I know that it shall be well with the dutiful Eccl. 8. 12, 13.
child, but it shall not be well with the disobedient, he shall not prolong
his days: and these of the Prophet, Say ye to the obedient child, it shall be
well with him, he shall eat the fruit of his doings, Isa. 3. 10, 11.
but woe to the transgressor, it shall be ill with him.

. 111. Of parents doing good to their children by keeping them under obedience.
Out of this promise parents may learn how to do good 4. Use.
for their children, how to provide for their welfare, and long to preserve
their life on earth (a thing whereunto most parents are naturally given, and
whereof they are much desirous) namely by teaching children their duty, by
keeping them under obedience: thus have they Gods promise to assure them, that
it shall go well with their children, and that they shall live long. When
parents are upon their deathbeds they may rest more securely upon this promise
then upon great store of treasure laid up for them, and great revenues reserved
for them. Many parents neglect themselves: they moile and toil, they carke and
care, they pinch and spare, to leave their children store of wealth, thinking
thereby to do good to their children, when as withal they too much cocker
their children, give the reins unto them, and care not how little duty they
perform. Gods curse will lie upon all the store that is laid up for such
children, as a fire to consume it all. Does not daily experience verify the
truth hereof? The judgments which are laid on some such children, do
evidently manifest Gods just indignation against all. Let not rich men
therefore think they have left their children well enough if they leave them a
large portion, but rather if they have observed them to be obedient children:
and if poor men's children be such, let them not fear but that it shall go
well with them.

It is said, that a good trade is better then house and land, but by virtue of
this promise we may say that obedience in a child is better then trade and
all: this is the trade of a childs Prou. 22. 6.
way which parents should teach children. Wherefore as parents are desirous of
their childrens good, so they ought to be wise in procuring it, which is by
teaching them this trade of obedience: and so they shall bring much comfort to
themselves while they live, and good to their children after them.

. 112. Of the perpetuity of the substance of such things as in their
circumstances respecting the Jews are vanished.
In laying down this particular promise, the Apostle in stead of the
limitation thereof unto the Jews in these words (in the land which the Lord
thy God shall give thee) puts a general word, which extends it to all
nations, namely this (in the earth) whence I gather that

The substance of these things which in some circumstances were Doctr.
Substance of promises made to the Jews still remains.
after a peculiar manner restrained to the Jews, remains in force to all
Christians. The substance of this promise was, that it should go well with
obedient children, while here on earth they lived, and in this welfare they
should long live. The circumstance was, that in Canaan they should enjoy that
blessing. Though Christians live not in Canaan, which is the circumstance, yet
well it shall go with them, and long they shall live, which is the substance.
Thus though the circumstance of Gods covenant with Abraham (which was
circumcision) be abolished, yet the substance (which is, to be our God, and the
God of our seed) remains. This might further be exemplified in many hundred
instances: for the substance of all the Jewish sacrifices, and Sacraments, both
ordinary, and extraordinary, of their Sabbaths, of their fasts, of their
feasts, and the like, remain, though the circumstances, as shadows, be
vanished away. Hence is it, that many promises made to them, are applied by the
Apostles to Christians, as this, I will not fail thee, Heb. 13. 5. Act. 2. 39.
nor forsake thee: and in general it is said, The promise to you and to your
children, and to all that are afarra off.

Hereby we may learn what use to make of the old Testament, Use.
even of those promises and privileges which in some particular respects were
appropriated to the Jews: namely, by observing the substance, and
distinguishing it from the circumstance; thus shall we find that to be true
which the Apostle speaks of all the things which were written before time,
namely, that they were written for our learning. In this respect Romans 15. 4.
the same Apostle says of the things recorded of Abraham, they were not
written for his sake alone: and again of the Rom 4. 23.
things recorded of the Israelites, they are written for our admonition. 1 Cor.
10. 11.
By this we may learn how to apply the preface to the ten Commandments,
which mentions the deliverance of Israel out of the bondage of Egypt.

Pray therefore for the spirit of illumination to discern betwixt substance
and circumstance, in reading the old Testament especially.

. 113. Of the determined period of man's life.
Having declared such orthodoxall points as this text affords, I will further
note out two heretical positions, which our adversaries thence raise. One is
of those, that to the dishonor of him whom God raised up to be a worthy
instrument in dispelling the mist of Popery, which had much darkened the light
of the Gospel, call themselves Lutherans: the other of Papists.

The former is this, God has not determined the set period of Hinc patescit
humanae vitae terminum, non esse decreto simplici and absoluto constitutum,
etc. Zach. Muthel. in hunc loc. and N. Heming. alijque.
man's days, but it is in man's power to lengthen or shorten them: for if it
were otherwise, say they, this and such like promises of long life were to no
purpose, nor yet the contrary threatenings of shortning man's days.

For full answer hereunto, I will first show, that the position it self is
directly contrary to the current of Scripture, and then discover the
unsoundness of their consequence.

Touching the determined period of man's days, thus speaks the Scripture: Is
there not an appointed time to man on Man's time set. Job 7. 1.
earth? are not his days also as the days of an hireling? Note with what
emphasis the point is set forth; even so, as if it were a point so clear, as
none could doubt of it. Note also two metaphors here used, which do much
clear the point: one taken from soldiers, the other from hired servants. That
of soldiers is implied in the meaning of the original word translated
appointed time, but properly signifies him that has (...)
his time appointed for warfare, or the time it self so appointed: the other
expressed. Now we know that these times are appointed to an hour: so is the
time of man's life. In this respect Job says again, all the days of my
appointed time will I Job 14. 14.
wait, etc. where he uses the same word that before in the same sense. To this
purpose are these, and such like phrases frequently used in Scripture,
determined days, number of days, Job 14. 5. Eccles. 2. 3. Job. 7. 30.
hour, etc. Did not the Prophet expressly declare to Hezekiah that he should
live just 15 years after his sickness? He could Isa. 38. 5.
not have told it, if the Lord had not before set that period. Christ says,
our hairs are numbered, are not much more our Mat. 10. 30. and 6 27.
days? Again he says, who can add one cubit to his stature? Stat sua cuique
dies, etc. Virg. Aenied. 10.
Can then any add to his days? So evident is this point, that the heathen
noted it.

Touching their consequence (if a man's time be determined all the promises of
long life are to no purpose) I answer, that God who has set down the just
time and period of man's life, has also set down the means of attaining to
that period. Now the time he has kept secret to himself, the means he has
revealed to us. In regard of us therefore who know not the time appointed of
the Lord, it may be said that by using such and such means we prolong our
days, or by doing such and such things we shorten them. Now because these
means only show them to be long, or short, Gods decree remains firm and
stable, and is not altered thereby: yet this work of lengthening or shortning
is attributed to us, because we do what lies in us thereto, and that freely
without any compulsion. For Gods decree though it cause a necessity in the
event, yet it imposes no constraint on the will of man, but leaves it as free
(in regard of the manner of working) as if there were no decree at all. And
herein Gods admirable wisdom is manifested, that notwithstanding his
determined purpose of matters, man has no ground of excuse to say he was
forced to this or that.

The knowledge of this determined period of man's life is of great use: for it
teaches us,

1. Wholly to submit our selves to God: and to be prepared Uses to be made of
the determined time of man's life.
either soon to depart out of this world, or long to live in it, as God shall
dispose of our time: nor desiring longer to live then God has appointed: nor
grieuing to live so long as he has appointed.

2. Not to fear the threats of any man, thereby to be drawn Dan. 3. 17, 18.
from God.

3. To do Gods work while we have time, etc. Job. 9. 4.


. 114. Of reward promised to obedience, that it implies no merit.
The other heresy which Papists gather from this text, is Against merit.
this, Man's obedience is meritorious.

Answ. The reward here promised is no matter of wages and due desert, but of
mere grace and favor.

Of this error I have Whole armor of God, Treat. 2. Part. 4.. 7. on Ephesians. 6.
14.
elsewhere more largely spoken.

. 115. Of the connection of Parents duty with Childrens.
EPHESIANS. 6. 4. And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
THe Apostle having urged children to perform their duties to their parents,
he turns his speech to parents, saying, AND ye fathers, etc. That copulative
particle AND, joining an exhortation to parents, for performing their duties to
the forenamed exhortation made to children, gives us to understand, that

Parents are as well bound to duty as children. Their duties 1. Obseru.
Parents bound to duties.
indeed be different, yet (notwithstanding their superiority and authority
over their children) they are bound to duty. All the directions and
exhortations throughout the Scripture given unto parents, concerning their
duty, and all the threatenings denounced, and judgments executed on parents
for neglect of their duty, are pregnant proofs of this point.

Though parents be over their children, and by them cannot be commanded, yet
they are under God: and he it is who has enjoined them their duty: so as they
are bound thereunto, as they will answer it to their Father in heaven.

The authority which parents have, is not so much for their own advancement,
as for the better governing of their children, which being so, their very
government is a duty.

Object. In the moral Law the duty of children only is expressed. How parents
duties are implied in the 5. Commandment.

Answ. Parents duty (as many others duties) is by just and necessary
consequence implied, which is equivalent, and as much binds, as if it were
expressed. It is thus implied. They who have honor, must carry themselves
worthy of honor. Now the way to carry themselves worthy of honor, is to be
careful in doing duty to them that honor them. This is so equal, as it
needed not to be expressed.

Wherefore let Ministers follow this pattern of the Apostle, 1. Use. Ministers
must provoke parents to their duty.
and carry an even hand toward all of all sorts: let them not be partial in
laying all the burden of duty on childrens necks, and none on parents: holding
in children very straightly, but leaving parents to their own will. Parents are
flesh and blood as well as children, and as prone to transgress in their
place, as children in theirs. Yea, Ministers ought of the two to be more
earnest in urging parents to perform their duty, because they are under no
such power and authority as children are. Fear of parents authority keeps
children much in awe. There is no such thing to keep parents in awe. They will
be more ready therefore to take the greater liberty, if by fear of God, and
by a good conscience, they be not kept in compass.

Now ye (o parents) as you look for honor, carry yourselues 2. Use.
worthy of honor: as ye look for duty from your children, perform duty to
them. Know that another day, even you shall be called to an account before the
highest Judge: your authority will then be no pretense to excuse, but an
evidence to aggrauate your fault. For you being elder in years, and more
eminent in place, of more experience, and having a charge over your children,
ought to be a light to show them the way, an example to allure them, that they
seeing you careful and conscionable in performing your duty, may be the more
provoked to perform theirs, or at least made ashamed of their neglect of
duty. But if you be careless of your duty, how can ye expect duty at their
hands? nay if by your ill example they have been made negligent, their blood
shall be required at your hands.

. 116. Of the extent of these words, Fathers, Children.
Though the word (Fathers) be here used, which properly (...).
sets forth natural parents, and of natural parents the male kind, yet
(as in many other places) it is to be taken in a larger extent: even in as
large as this word (children) was before, that so there may be a just and
equal relation betwixt children Verse. 1.
and parents: wherefore both sexes of natural parents are comprised under it,
even mother as well as father, and they also who are in place of parents,
whether by marriage as all sorts of fathers and mothers in Law, or by
appointment, as all they who of right have the custody and charge of children,
as Guardians, Tutors, and other like Governors: and so it is every way
answerable to the word (parents) used in the first verse: and the word
(children) is also here to be taken in the same extent, as it was there.

. 117. Of parents provoking children.
The next phrase (provoke to wrath) is the exposition of one (...).
Greek word, which being a compound word, cannot by one English word be fully
expressed: the best and nearest that I can think of is (exasperate.) The word
signifies an extremity in the use of authority: even too much austeritie and
severity, whereby children are provoked to wrath: which because it is a fault,
it is here expressly forbidden (provoke not, etc.) In this word there is a
trope: the effect is put for the cause: The Apostles meaning is, that parents
should take such heed of their carriage toward their children, as they give them
no occasion to be stirred up to wrath. Under this word then are forbidden
Occasions of provoking children to wrath.
all such things, as may kindle wrath in children, as too much austeritie in
carriage, sowrenesse in countenance, threatening and reuiling in words, too hard
handling, too severe correction, too much restraint of liberty, too small
allowance of things needful, with the like. Parents being flesh and blood are
subject in this kind to abuse their authority: yea, even they who fall into
the other extreme of too much indulgencie and cockering of their children, are
very prone to fall also into this extreme: as many who for the most part too
much suffer their children without due restraint and correction to run into
all riot, will sometimes on a sudden, like Lions, fly upon them, and after
their own pleasure correct them, and so exceedingly provoke Heb. 12. 10.
their children. Such as are most cockering, are most prone to provoke to
wrath: for, 1. Such least know how to keep a mean: one will sooner leap out
of one extreme into another, then go from an extreme to the mean. 2. The
children of such are soonest provoked.

Quest. Is it a thing lawful and justifiable in children to be provoked to
wrath by their parents?
Answ. See Treat. 5.. 31, 41.
No. This prohibition intends no such thing: the Apostle has here to do
with parents: and instructs them how to prevent such mischiefs as their
children through their weakness may fall into. So as here only he shows what
is unlawful for parents, not what is lawful for children. Hence then by the
way I observe that

Parents must be so watchful over their carriage, as thereby they 2. Obser.
make not their children to sin.

If they do, they make their own sin the more heinous, and also they pull
down upon their own pates a far more heavy vengeance, even the vengeance
of their own sin, and the vengeance of their childs sin. For every parent
is made a watchman over his child. If a watchman do not Ezec. 3. 18.
what he can to hinder the sin of such as are under his charge, he pulls
their blood on his own neck. What do they then that being watchmen, minister
occasion of sin to them that are under their charge?

. 118. Of parents seeking the good of their children.
That parents by avoiding the rock of provoking, fall not into the gulf of
cockering, the Apostle adds a BUT, which is (...).
as a stop unto them, and teaches them that

It is not sufficient for parents to prevent such mischiefs a^ 3. Obser.
children may fall into, but they must also seek their good. All the precepts
in Scripture charging parents to seek their childrens good, prove the point.
Herein lies a maine difference betwixt the affection which parents and
strangers ought to bear toward children, and the duty which one and the other
owe to them. Mere strangers ought not to provoke them: but parents ought
moreover every way to seek their good.

The maine good which parents ought especially to seek after in the behalf of
their children, is noted out in these words: Bring them up in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord.

The word translated (bring up) properly signifies to feed (...).
or nourish with all needful things; it is the same that is used before in the
5. chapter and 29. verse, and there translated nourishes. Not unfitly might
the proper signification of the (...). Enutrite, Beza.
word be here kept, as the best Latin translations, the French, and others
have kept.

This word joined with the others that follow, may seem Nourrissez. Fr.
at first sight to be here placed only to make up the sense, as if he had thus
said, nurture your child in the ways of God. But if the scope of the Apostle,
and signification of the word be well weighed, we shall find that it further
implies a general duty, which nature it self teaches parents, even this,
that

Parents ought to provide all needful things for their children: 4. Obseru.
Parents to provide all needful things for children. (...).
even such things as tend to the nourishing of their bodies, and preserving of
their health and life: for this phrase (to translate it word for word) nourish
them in discipline, or in instruction, is a concise speech, implying as much as
if he had said, nourish and nurture them, or feed and instruct them. But the
Apostle has thus nearly and concisely joined them together, to show that
Nurture and instruction is as needful and profitable, as food and apparel.

. 119. Of parents nurturing their children. 5. Obseru. (...).

The word translated nurture, signifies as well correction as instruction: as
Heb. 12. 7. If ye endure chastening: and 2 Timothy 3. 16. The Scripture is
profitable for instruction in righteousness. Both senses will here stand, and
our English word (as well as the Greek) will bear both: for to nurture
children, is as well to correct them, as to instruct them. Very fitly is this
advice in this large acceptance inferred upon the former prohibition: for lest
parents should thereupon take occasion to lay the reins upon their childrens
necks, and let them run whither they list, the Apostle hereby teaches, that

Parents, as they may not be too austere, so neither too remiss. 6. Obseru.
(...).
They must not provoke their children to wrath, yet they must keep them under
discipline. The word translated nurture, according to the (...), Instituere vt
puerili aetati conuenit.
Greek notation thereof does further set forth the mean betwixt the two
forenamed extremes: for it notes out such a discipline as befitteth a lad, or
a young child: so as the thing it self, discipline, by instruction and
correction keeps from one extreme of remissness: the kind or manner of
discipline being such as befitteth a child, keeps from the other extreme of
rigor and cruelty. Extremes on either side are dangerous and pernicious, and
that to parent and child. For remissness will make children careless of all
duty to God and parent: rigor will make them desperate. But virtue and
safety consists in the mean betwixt both.

. 120. Of parents fixing precepts in their childrens minds.
This word (admonition) according to the (...), menti indere.
notation thereof, has a particular relation to the mind, and points out an
informing and instructing of it. It is taken either for the action of
admonishing, (as Tit. 3. 10. reject an heretic (...).
after the first and second admonition) or for the In monitis.
thing admonished, in which latter sense most do here take it: yet would I not
have the former clean excluded, for according to the full meaning of the word,
I take thus much to be intended.

As parents deliver good precepts and principles to their children, 7. Obseru.
(...).
so they must be careful, by forcible and frequent admonitions, to fix and
settle them in the mind of their children. Deuteronomy. 6. 7.
The Law expresses as much by another metaphor which it uses, in a direction
which it gives to parents, saying, thou shall whet or sharpen Gods Laws upon
thy children, that is, Doctus inter Hebr. vocem (...) continuo loqui exponit,
(i.) inculcare, vel identidem repetere. Innuit studium and diligentiam qua
pueris praecepta Dei inculcari debent. Uatabl. in Deuteronomy. 6. 7. vide Tr. 6.. 42.
thou shall teach them diligently unto them.

The more pains is taken in this kind, the less labor will be lost. That
which at first is little heeded, by much urging and pressing will for ever be
held, as a nail that at one blow scarce enters, with many blows is knocked up
to the head.

121. Of adding information to discipline.
The addition of this word admonition unto nurture, is not (as some take it) a
mere explication of the same point, but also a declaration of a further duty,
which is this:

As parents by discipline keep their children under, so by information 8.
Obser.
they must direct them in the right way. Solomon does both deliver the point,
and also add a good reason to enforce it: for says he, Train up a child in
the way that he should go; there is the duty: and when he is old, he will not
depart from it; there Pro. 22. 6.
is the reason. Keeping a child under by good discipline, may make him
dutiful while the father is over him: but well informing his understanding and
judgment, is a means to uphold him in the right way so long as he lives.

. 122. Of parents teaching their children the fear of God.
The last word (of the Lord) intimates the best duty that (...).
a parent can do for his child. Admonition of the Lord, declares such
principles as a parent has received from the Lord, and learned out of Gods
word: such as may teach a child to fear the Lord, such as tend to true piety
and religion: whence further I observe, that

Parents must especially teach their children their duty to 9. Obser.
God. Come children (says the Psalmist) hearken unto me, I will teach you the
fear of the Lord. Of this particular more largely Treat. 6.. 34.
hereafter.

. 123. Of the subjection which believing servants owe.
Because there is yet another order in the family besides those which have been
noted before, namely the order of Masters and servants, the Apostle prescribes
also unto them their duty.

As he began with wives and children, in the two former orders, so here he
begins with servants who are the inferiors, for the same reasons. 10. Why
the Apostle is so copious in urging servants to their duty.
before rendered.

The Apostle is somewhat copious in laying forth the duties of servants, and in
urging them to perform their duty; and that for two especial reasons: One in
respect of those, whose masters were infidels: another in respect of those,
whose masters were Saints.

1. Many servants there were in those days wherein the Seruus beneuolentia
prosequatur dominum, quamuis impiu^. Qui fidelem habet dominum, saluo eius
dominio, diligat vt patrem. Conslit. Apost. li. 4. ca. 12. Gal. 4. 28.
Gospel was first preached to the Gentiles, that by the preaching thereof were
converted, whose masters embraced not the Gospel: whereupon those servants
began to conceit that they being Christians, ought not to be subject to their
masters that were infidels.

2. Other servants there were whose Masters believed the Gospel as well as
they: now because the Gospel taught, that there is neither bond nor free, but
all are one in Christ Jesus: they thought that they ought not to be subject to
their master who was their brother in Christ.

These two preposterous and presumptuous conceits does the Apostle intimate,
and expressly meet with in 1 Timothy 6. 1, 2.
another place. And because they had taken too deep rooting in the minds of
many servants, the Apostle here in this place labors the more earnestly to
root them out, and that by a through pressing upon their conscience that
subjection wherein they are bound to their masters, as masters, whatsoever
their disposition were. Hereof more Treat. 7.. 2, 3.
afterward.

Here by the way, note three points. 1. The Gospel does not free inferiors
from that subjection 1. Obser.
to men whereunto by the moral law they are bound. 2. Men are ready to turn
the grace of God into liberty. 2. Obser.
3. As errors begin to sprout up in the Church, Ministers 3. Obser.
must be careful to root them out.


. 124. Of the meaning of the fifth verse.
EPHESIANS. 6. 5. Servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart, as unto
Christ.
THis title (Servants) is a general title, which may be applied (...).
to all such as by any outward civil bond, or right, Origo vocabuli seruoru^
in Lat. lingua inde creditur ducta, quod hi qui iure belli possint occidi a
victoribus cum seruabaxtur serui fiebant: a seruando appellati. Aug. de Ciu.
Dei lib. 19. cap. 15. Uide ^ud Viu. ibid.
owe their service to another: of what sex soever the persons themselves be: or
of what kind soever their servitude is: whether more servile or liberal.

Servile, as being borne servants, or sold for servants, or taken in war, or
ransomed; For of old they were called servants, who being taken in war, were
saved from death.

Liberal, as being by voluntary contract made servants, whether at will, as
some seruing-men, journey men, and laborers; or for a certain term of
years, as prentises, clearkes, and such like. Wherefore whatsoever the birth,
parentage, estate, or former condition of any have been; being

Servants they must be subject, and do the duty of servants: the 4. Obser.
Apostles indefinite title (servants) admits no exception of any.

The other title (Masters) has as large an extent comprising (...). What
masters are meant.
under it both sexes, Masters and Mistresses: and of these all sorts, great and
mean, rich and poor, strong and weak, faithful and infidels, true
professors and profane; superstitious, idolatrous, heretical persons, or the
like: so as

No condition or disposition of the master exempteth a servant 5. Obseru.
from performing duty to him.

Among other degrees and differences, most especially let it be noted that both
sexes, mistresses as well as masters, are here meant, that so the duties which
are enjoined to be performed to masters may answerably be performed to
mistresses (so far as they are common to both) and that both by maidseruants,
and also by men-seruants that are under mistresses. In families mistresses are
as ordinary as masters, and therefore I thought good to give an especial item
of this.

Under this word (obey) are comprised all those duties which (...).
servants owe to their masters: it is the same word that was before used in the
first verse: and it has as large an extent here being applied to servants, as
it had there being applied to children: It shows that

The rule of servants (as servants) is the will of their Master. 6. Obseru.
(...).


This clause (according to the flesh) is by some referred to the action of
obedience, as if it were added by the Apostle to show what kind of obedience
servants owe to their masters, namely a civil, corporal obedience in
temporal things, opposed to that spiritual obedience which is due to God
alone.

Ans. Though distinction may be made betwixt that service which is due to God,
and that which is due to man, yet this application of this phrase in this place
may give occasion to servants to think that if they perform outward service
to their masters all is well, they owe no inward fear, or honor, which is an
error that the Apostle does here mainly oppose against.

But because this clause (according to the flesh) is immediately Why masters are
said to be after the flesh. Dominis carnalibus. vet. transl.
joined to Masters, I refer it to the persons to whom obedience is to be
given, and so take it as a description of them, as if he had said, to fleshly
or bodily Masters.

The Apostle thus describes masters for these reasons.

1. For distinction: to show he means such masters as are of the same mould
that servants are: so distinguishing them from God who is a spirit: thus does
the Apostle distinguish betwixt fathers of our flesh, and father of spirits.
Heb. 12. 9.


2. For prevention: left servants might say, our masters are flesh and blood as
we are, why then should we be subject to them? To meet with that conceit, the
Apostle expressly says that obedience is due to masters after the flesh.

3. For mitigation of their servitude: for their masters being flesh, they have
no power but over the bodies of their servants: their spirits are free from
them: in which respect the Apostle calls Christian servants the Lords
freemen. 1 Cor. 7. 22.


4. For consolation against their present condition, which is but for a time,
because their masters are flesh: whatsoever is according to the flesh is of no
long continuance, but has his date.

5. For direction: to show in what things especially that obedience which
properly belongs to a master consists: namely in civil, outward things:
for every one must be served according to his nature. As God being spirit, must
in spirit be served: so man being flesh must in flesh be served. Now this
service in the flesh is not opposed to sincere and upright service, but to
spiritual. Thus by consequence that may be intended, which some would have
principally to be meant.

Object. Masters may command spiritual things, namely to worship God, and
after such and such a manner.
Answ. Of his own head he cannot command such things: there must be an higher
warrant for the doing of them then the commandment of a man.

A maine point here intended is this, that

Masters are not to be lightly respected because they be after the 7. Obseru.
flesh: that is, weak, frail, of short continuance, of the same nature that
servants are.

Lest upon the forenamed description of masters, servants Servants fear of
their masters. (...).
should take to themselves too much heart, the Apostle annexeth this clause
(with fear and trembling, etc.) which has relation to the manner of their
obedience. No slavish fear is here meant, as if servants should live in
continual dread, or tremble at the sight of their masters: a servant by the
tyranny of some master may be brought so to do: but to do so is no Christian
duty: that which the Apostle here requires is a duty belonging to all
Christian servants toward all sorts of masters, even the mildest that be. It
is therefore an awful respect of the authority of a master, and a dutiful
reverence to his person which is here required: and it is opposed to
sauciness, malepartnesse, boldness, stoutnesse, answering again, murmuring
and muttering against their masters, and other like vices. To show how foul
those faults be, and what great respect servants ought to bear to their
masters, these two words (fear, and trembling) are joined together: which in
Difference betwixt fear and trembling.
effect declare one and the same thing: but yet for explication sake they may
be distinguished. For (...). Verse. 33.
Fear signifies a reverend respect of one: it is that which in the former
Chapter was required of wives: though the thing in general which is required
of wives and servants is the same, yet the particular manner and measure of a
servants fear is far different.

(...).
Trembling is more proper to servants: it is a dread of punishment: and it is
required of servants, not as if they should do all things simply for fear of
punishment, but because God has put a staff into a masters hands, servants
must tremble at that power their masters have, and fear to provoke them to
strike. To this purpose says the Apostle to subjects in regard of the power
which a Magistrate has, be afraid, for Romans 13. 3, 4.
he bears not the sword in vain.

Hence learn that

The authority of a Master ought to strike a servants heart with 8. Obser.
dread.

The dread which servants ought to have of their masters power and authority
makes many to care for no more then to avoid their masters displeasure:
wherefore the Apostle adds a further degree of a servants subjection, namely
that (...).
it be in singleness of heart, that is, honest, entire, upright: for this is
opposed to hypocrisy, dissimulation, and fraud: yea of YOUR heart, not
another: another in the simplicity of his heart may think you do a thing
better then you do, by a charitable construction of every thing, but if in
singleness of your own heart you do it, it will in truth be as it appears
to be. So as

All the services which servants perform to their masters must 9. Obser.
be done in truth and uprightness.

The Apostle gives this direction to Christians who have to do not only with
masters according to the flesh (who only see the outward appearance) but also
with the master of spirits 1 Samuel 16. 7. (...).
who looks on the heart: and therefore also he added this clause, as unto
Christ: teaching servants thereby that

Servants in their obedience to their masters, must approve 10. Obseru.
themselves to Jesus Christ as well as to their masters after the flesh.

This phrase (as unto Christ) implies as much as that (in the Lord) whereof we
spoke. 96.
before.

. 125. Of the meaning of the sixth verse.
EPHESIANS. 6. 6. Not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
THis and the verse following are added as a further explication of the last
clause of the former verse. It should seem that servants, howsoever they might
in some measure perform the maine duty of obedience, yet failed exceedingly
in the manner of performing it. Because masters were but men, masters according
to the flesh, who neither had power over the heart, nor could discern the
disposition thereof, servants thought they had well done their duty, if they
had outwardly performed what their master required: now to root out this bitter
weed, and to reform this corrupt conceit, the Apostle is more large in
clearing the point of sincere and upright service: therefore, the more fully to
express his mind and meaning, first he lays down the vice contrary to the
foresaid sincerity (for contraries laid together do much set forth one
Opposita iuxta se posita magis elucescunt.
another) and then returns more distinctly to declare the virtue. Whence note

Those points are most to be urged upon people, wherein they 11. Obser.
most fail.

The vice here noted to be contrary to sincere service is termed (...).
eie-seruice. Our English word does properly and fitly answer the original,
both in the notation, and in the true sense and meaning of it. It implies a
mere outward service only What eie-seruice is.
to satisfy the eye of man:

And that is twofold, Hypocritical, Parasiticall.

Hypocritical service is that which is merely in show: when that is pretended
to be done which indeed is not done; as if a servant should come from his
masters work all in a sweat, as if he had taken extraordinary pains therein,
whereas he has done nothing at all, but otherwise made himself to sweat, or
only made a show of sweat.

Parasiticall service is that which is indeed done, but in presence of the
master: such servants are they who will be very diligent and faithful in doing
such things as their masters see, or shall come to their notice: but otherwise
behind their masters back, and in things which they hope shall never come to
his knowledge, they will be as negligent, and unfaithful as if they were no
servants. Yet to satisfy their masters, and to sooth them, they will do any
thing though never so unlawful.

From this vice thus discovered note, that

God requires more then that which may satisfy man's eye. 11. Obser.
Gods eye is a piercing eye, and can see much foulness, where to man's eye all
things seem very fair: so as they much deceive themselves who think all is
well because no man can say to them, black is thine eye.

Those that content themselves with doing eie-seruice the Men pleasers. (...)
Apostle here terms men-pleasers: which title he gives unto them for two
especial reasons.

1. To show the ground of eie-seruice: which is because all their care is to
please their master, who is a man: for well they know that man can see but the
outward show, or that which is done before his face.

2. To show the heinousness of that sin: for it is tainted with Atheism, in
that the man guilty thereof has no respect to God: but prefers his master
before God: he cares not to please God so he please his master: for this is
the emphasis of that word (men-pleasers) It is spoken in opposition to God, as
the Apostle implies in another place, saying, If I yet pleased Gal. 1. 10.
men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

Object. How can it be so heinous a sin to be men-pleasers, Tit. 2. 9.
when the Apostle advises servants to please their masters in all things?

1. Answ. The advice there given is not simply to please, but to (...).
please well, as the original word properly signifies, and the Kings
translators have fitly turned it.

2. Answ. That general particle (all things) must be restrained How masters
are to be pleased in all things.
to the duties of a servant, and to all the parts of obedience, which he there
mentions in the words immediately going before. Servants therefore must please
their masters in all things that their masters have power to require at their
hands, and they are bound to do. Men-pleasing, here spoken of, is opposed to
pleasing of God. Pleasing of men there mentioned is subordinate to our pleasing
of God: here to please men is to sooth them up in every thing good or evil:
there to please them is conscionably to obey them in every lawful thing. Here
is condemned a seeking to please men in the first place, and that only, and
wholly in every thing, whereas we ought first to seek Gods approbation, then
the testimony of a good conscience, and after these a pleasing of men, but in,
for, and under God. Hence then observe that

A servant must not wholly give himself to sooth and please 12. Obseru.
his master: for so may he in many things highly displease Almighty God.

To avoid the two forenamed sins, eie-seruice, and men-pleasing, the Apostle
gives an excellent direction in these words, as the servants of Christ doing
the will of God from the heart, where we may observe Servants of Christ to be
opposed to men-pleasers, and doing Gods will from the heart to eie-seruice.

Servants of Christ, are they who know that their masters are in (...).
Christ's place, bear his image, have their authority from him, and are under
him: so as in serving their masters they serve Who are servants of Christ.
Christ: and so far as they may serve both together, they will: but if they
prove contrary masters, and thereupon one of necessity must be left, then they
will cleave unto the highest master, which is Christ: and in this respect they
are called the Lords freemen, 1. Cor. 7. 22. Thus we see how a servant may Quo
pacto servus non est servus? Cum prop ter Deum omnia facit. Chrysostom. in 1 Cor. 7.
hom. 19.
be no servant, if he do all things for the Lord.

From this opposition betwixt men-pleasers and servants of Christ, note that

They who in all things give themselves to please men are no servants of
Christ.

That we may the better know who are servants of Christ, 13. Obseru.
the Apostle adds a description of them in these words (doing the will of God
from the heart.) Christ's will is Gods will: for as Christ is God, the fathers
will and his is all one: as he is man he wholly orders his will by his
fathers, he seeks not Ioh. 5. 30.
his own will, but the will of the father that sent him.

This description of a servant of Christ the Apostle adds partly as a
direction to servants to teach them how in serving their masters, they may be
servants of Christ, (namely, in having an eye to Gods word, whereby his will is
revealed both for the matter and manner of all things which they do) and
partly as a motive to persuade them to be content with their place, and
cheerfully to do their duty, because so is the will of God.

Gods will is that which must direct and settle every one in the 14. Obseru.
things which they do: for Gods will is the rule of that which is right. Every
thing is very right which he wills: and nothing is right that swerueth from
his will.

To put a difference betwixt Christ and other masters, and to show that he
looks not (as man does) upon the outward appearance, but beholds the heart,
the Apostle annexeth this clause (from the heart.) And it declares that

A good thing must be well done. To do that which is Gods 15. Obseru.
will, commended by his word, is for substance a good thing: to do it from the
heart, is the right manner of doing it: That which being good is done after a
right manner, is well done.

. 126. Of the meaning of the seventh verse.
EPHESIANS. 6. 7. With good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men.

IN this verse the Apostle does yet again inculcate the forenamed point
concerning servants manner of obeying their masters, and their care therein to
approve themselves to their highest master: whence observe that

Matters needful and weighty are again and again to be pressed. 16. Obseru.
This is a needful point, because servants exceedingly fail therein: and a
weighty point it is, because all the comfort and benefit of service consists
in Gods approbation. But the former point is not here merely and barely
repeated, but so set down as other good directions are afforded to servants
What it is to serve with good will.
for their manner of obedience.

1. To serve with good will, is somewhat more then with singleness of heart.
For it further implies

1. A readiness and cheerfulness in doing a thing; a doing it with a good
mind, as the notation of the Greek word (...).
shows.

2. A desire and endeavor that their masters may reap profit and benefit by
their service: whereby they show that they bear a good will, and good mind to
their masters.

In setting down servants duties, the Apostle uses another word then before
in the fifth verse, namely this (doing service) (...).
whereby he shows that a servants place and duty is of a more abject and
inferior kind then the place and duty of a child or a wife: the former word
( (...).
obey) was common to all: this word ( (...).
doing service) is proper to servants: and the very title of a (...).
servant, is derived from thence. Hence note that

Though wives and children be inferiors as well as servants, yet 17. Obseru.
may not servants look for such privileges as they have. Another manner of
subjection must be performed by servants.

The clause annexed (as to the Lord) is in effect the same (...).
with that in the 5. verse (as to Christ) for by the Lord he here means The
Lord Christ. But it is added to meet with a secret Objection. For if servants
should say, You require us to serve Object.
our masters with good will, but what if they be hard-hearted and regard not
our good will, but pervert our good mind? The Apostle Answ.
gives them this answer, Look not so much to men and their reward, as to God
and his reward: serve men in and for the Lord, even as if you served God: so
shall not your service be in vain. The inference of the eighth verse upon
this, shows that this is it which the Apostle here intends. Learn
therefore that

An eye is to be cast upon God even in those duties which we perform 18.
Obseru.
to men: and that both for approbation and reward from God.

The negative clause which follows in these words (and not to men) is not
simply to be taken (for then would it thwart the maine scope of the Apostle in
this place) but comparatively in relation to God, and that in two respects.

1. That service be not done only to men.

2. That service be not done to men in and for themselves. Service must be done
to God as well as men: yea In that service 19. Obseru.
which we do to men, we must serve God. Men must be served for the Lords sake,
because the Lord has commanded it, because they bear the Lords image, and
stand in his stead: in the Lord, and under the Lord.

From this large declaration of the manner of doing service Difference betwixt
servants of men, and of Christ.
to masters note the difference betwixt such servants as are servants of men,
and such as are servants of Christ. 1. They do all to the eye. These all from
the heart. 2. They seek to please men. These do the will of God. 3. They do
their service discontentedly. These cheerfully. 4. They do all upon
self-love. These with good will.


. 127. Of the meaning of the eight verse.
EPHESIANS. 6. 8. Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall
he receive of the Lord whether he be bond or free.
GReat is the ingratitude of many masters: they will exact Why servants are put
in mind of Gods reward.
all the service that a poor servant possibly can do, but slenderly
recompense his pains: yea, it may be, very euilly reward the same, not
affording competent food, clothing, lodging, but frowns, checkes, and blows.
Now to uphold servants in such straits, and to encourage them to do their
duty whether their masters regard it or no, the Apostle in this verse
labors to raise up their minds to God: and to show unto them that he
regards them, and will sufficiently reward them, so as

Servants labor shall not be in vain in the Lord. To press 20. Obser.
this encouragement the more upon them, he sets it down as a thing granted
by all, so clear as none of them can be ignorant thereof (Knowing) as if he
had said, ye all well enough (...).
know that what I now say is most true: hence note that

Gods respect of faithful servants is so well known, as none that 21. Obser.
have any understanding can be ignorant thereof.

The Apostles argument is drawn from the general to a particular, A genere ad
speciem.
and the generality is noted in the thing done (whatsoever) and in the person
that does it (any man.) But because the generality of the thing might be too
far stretched, he adds this limitation (good) and because the generality
of the person might be too much restrained, he adds this explication (whether
bond or free.) This distinction is used because in those days many servants
were bondmen and bondwomen. Now the Apostles argument may thus be framed:
Every one of what estate and degree soever he be, shall be rewarded of God for
every good thing he does, be it great or small. Therefore every servant shall
be rewarded of God for every good service.

The recompense promised is set forth under a concise speech (the same shall he
receive) meaning that he shall receive (...).
a reward for the same: that phrase has relation to the crop which an
husbandman receives of the corn he sowed, which is of the same kind he
sowed: 1 Cor. 15. 38.
the seed being wheat, the crop is of wheat: the 2 Cor. 9. 6.
seed being plentifully sowed, the crop will be plentiful: to the same purpose
says this Apostle in another place, whatsoever a man sows (...).
that shall he also Gal. 6. 7.
reap. Now to apply this, servants that by their faithful service bring
honor and glory to God, shall again receive honor and glory. If they ask
of whom they shall receive it, the Apostle expressly answers, Of the Lord: for
it is the Lord that (...).
said, 1 Samuel 2. 30.
Them that honor me will I honor. God will not forget them, though their
masters may.

From this verse thus opened, I gather these particular observations,
concerning servants.

1. Servants may and ought to apply unto themselves general 22. Obser.
promises made to Christians. Otherwise this general argument of the Apostle
is to little purpose in this place.

2. A Christian may be a bond-slaue: for the Apostle directs this
encouragement to Christians, among whom he presupposes 23. Obser.
some to be slaves, opposing them to freemen, who also were servants.

3. Faithful service performed to men is a good thing: for the 24. Obser.
good things which servants especially do is in their service.

4. As God accepts not men because they are free, so neither 25. Obser.
rejects he them because they are bond. It is not the person, but the work
that he regards.

5. The faithful service of servants is as good seed sown: it 26. Obser.
will bring forth a good crop. The metaphor here intimated implies as much.

6. God is honored by the faithful service of servants: this is 27. Obser.
intimated by the application of Gods reward to them, for God honors none
but them which honor him.

. 128. Of the connection of masters duties with servants.
EPHESIANS. 6. 9. And ye masters do the same things unto them, forbearing
threatening: knowing that your master also is in heaven: neither is there
respect of persons with him.
TO the duties of servants the Apostle adioyneth the duties of masters, saying,
AND ye masters: whence learn that

Masters are as well bound to duty as servants. A like doctrine was noted from
the connection of parents duties with childrens: there you may see this general
further amplified, 1. Obser.
. 115.

1. Gods law requires as much: for it expressly inioyneth many duties to
masters (as in the eighth treatise following we shall see.)

2. So does also the law of nature which has tied master and servant together
by a mutual and reciprocal bond, of doing good, as well as of receiving good.

3. The law of nations requires also as much: For in all nations where ever
there was any good government, and where wise, and good laws were made,
particular laws of the duties of masters have been made.

4. The law of equity does so also. One good deserves another good: therefore
the Apostle says to masters, give unto your servants that which is just and
equal. Col. 4. 1.


Now let masters take notice hereof: and know that God the great Lord of all
has made this relation betwixt master and servant, and has set each of them
in their several and distinct places for the mutual good of one another, so
as servants are no more for the good of masters, then masters are for the good
of servants. Wherefore, as they look for duty, let them perform duty: if
servants fail in their duty, let masters see if they themselves be not the
cause thereof, by failing in theirs. Their authority will be no excuse before
Christ, but a means to aggrauate their fault, and increase their condemnation:
for the greater the talent is, the more diligence is expected, and the straiter
account shall be exacted.

. 129. Of the meaning of this phrase, Do the same things.
These two titles (Masters, Servants) are so taken here as they were. 124.
before in the fifth verse.

All the duties of masters are comprised under this phrase, do the same
things: which at first sight may seem to be somewhat (...).
strange: for may some say, The things which servants must do are these, to
fear, to obey, to do service, with the like, and are masters to do the same
things?

Answ. 1. These words are not to be referred to those particular duties which
are proper to servants, but to those general rules of equity which are common
to masters as well as servants; namely, that in their several places, with
singleness of heart, as unto Christ, not with eye service as men pleasers, but
as the servants of Christ they do the will of God from the heart.

2. Those words may be referred to the eight verse, the verse going immediately
before, which lays down a general rule for all men in their several places
to do the good things of their places. Now then as servants must have an eye
to their places to do the good things thereof, so masters must do the same
things: that is, they must have an eye to their places, to do the good things
thereof.

3. Those words may be taken without reference to any former words, and
expounded of a mutual, reciprocal, and proportionable duty that ought to
pass betwixt master and servant: not in the particulars, as if the same duties
were to be performed by each of them, for that were to overthrow the order and
degrees which God has set betwixt master and servant, to cross Gods
ordinance, and infer contradiction: but in general, that duties are to be
performed of each to other: in which respect the Apostle said. 3.
before of all sorts, superiors, and inferiors, Submit your selves one to
another. And thus by this phrase the doctrine before mentioned is confirmed,
that Masters are as well bound to duty as servants.

None of these answers thwart another, but all of them may well be admitted,
and all of them well stand together. They all imply a common equity betwixt
masters and servants, but no equality: mutual duties, but diverse and distinct
duties, appertaining to their several places. Compare with this text, that
which the Apostle himself has more plainly and fully noted (Col. 4. 1.) and
we shall observe him to expound his own meaning, for that which here he
implies under this phrase (the same things) that he expresses there under
these two words, just, equal: whereof we shall Treat. 8.. 20, 44.
hereafter more distinctly speak.

Purposely does the Apostle infold masters duties under this general phrase
(the same things) to prevent a secret objection raised from the eminency and
superiority of masters above servants, which makes them think, that servants
are only for the use of masters, and that masters are no way tied to their
servants. But if in the general masters must do the same things, then they
are for their servants good, as well as servants for theirs.

. 130. Of masters forbearing threatening.
The Apostle in these words (forbearing threatening) does (...).
not simply forbid all manner of threatening, but only prescribe a moderation
thereof: and Or, moderating.
so much have the Kings translators well expressed in the margin against this
Text. Threatening is a duty which, as occasion serves, masters ought to use,
and that to prevent blows. But men in authority are naturally prone to insult
over their inferiors, and to think that they cannot show their authority but
by austerit ie: for which reason the Apostle dehorteth husbands from Col. 3. 19.
bitterness, and parents from Ephesians. 6. 4.
provoking their children to wrath. Besides, the Sea Treat. 8.. 14.
Gentiles and Heathen thought that they had an absolute power over servants,
and that of life and death: whereupon the Roman Emperors made laws to
restrain that rigor: for they would use their servants like beasts. Now that
Christian masters should not be of the same mind, the Apostle exhorts them
to forbear threatening. Hence note that

Authority must be moderated and kept in compass: else will 2. Obser.
Authority to be kept in compass.
it be like a swelling river without banks and walls.

Threatening is here put for all manner of rigor, whether in heart, look,
words, or actions: for it is usual in Scripture to put one instance for all of
the same kind.

Forbearing, implies a restraint of all manner of excess, as

1. In time and continuance: when there is nothing but continual threatening
upon every small and light occasion.

2. In measure; when threatening is too fierce, and violent, so as it makes the
heart to swell again, and as it were fire to come out of the eyes, and thunder
out of the mouth, and the body to shake in every part thereof.

3. In execution; when every vengeance once threatened shall surely be put in
execution, though the party that caused the threatening be never so sorry for
his fault, and humble himself, and promise amendment, and give good hope
thereof. Woe were it with us the servants of the high God, if he should so
deal with us.

Here note that men may exceed in doing a bounden duty: and 3. Obser. Excess
in duty not good.
so turn a needful virtue into an hurtful vice: great respect therefore must
be had to the manner of doing good and lawful things.

Yet further for the extent of this prohibition, we are to know that under the
vice forbidden the contrary virtues are commanded, as mildness, gentleness,
patience, long suffering, with the like.

. 131. Of masters subjection to a greater master.
The latter part of this verse contains a reason to enforce the directions in
the former part. The reason in sum lays down that subjection wherein
masters are under God. A point whereof none of them could be ignorant, and
therefore he thus sets it down, knowing: for, (...).


All men know that there is an higher then the highest on earth. 4. Obseru.
The light of nature reuealeth as much, no Pagan, much less Christian, can be
ignorant thereof. In that speaking to masters he tells them that they have a
master, thereby he gives them to understand, that

They which are in authority, are also under authority: masters 5. Obseru. 1 Timothy 6. 15. Genesis 50. 19.
have a master. For God is Lord of Lords, Master of masters. In this respect
says Joseph a great Governor, am not I under God?

These two little particles (even your, or your also) add some (...).
emphasis: having reference to servants, as if he had said, as well your
master, as your servants master. Some Greek copies, for more perspicuitie,
thus read it (both your and their master) (...).
the sense is all one which way soever we read it: It shows that in relation
to God,

Masters and servants are in the same subjection, and under a 6. Obseru. Matthew.
23. 8. and 18. 28.
like command. There is one master, even Christ: and all men whosoever are
brethren, fellow-seruants.

. 132. Of Gods being in heaven.
That great Master, under whom all masters on earth are, is here said to be in
heaven, the more to commend and set forth his dignity and authority: and to
make masters to stand in the more awe of him: To like purpose David having set
forth God Psalm. 2. 4, 10, 11.
sitting in the heavens, infers this exhortation unto the great Commanders
on earth, Be wise now therefore, oye Kings, be instructed, ye Judges of the
earth: Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

Object. This placing of God in heaven, makes such as fear not God the more
insolent and secure: for they will be ready to think and say, How does God
know? can he judge through the Job 22. 13, 14.
dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering to him that he sees not, and he
walks in the circuit of he auen?

Answ. 1. The Apostle wrote to Christian masters, who thought better of God
then such Atheists did.

2. The placing of God in heaven does not bound him within the compass
thereof: for 1 King. 8. 27.
the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him. Ier. 23. 23.
He fills heaven and earth. Matthew. 5. 34, 35.
Though heaven be his throne, yet the earth also is his footstool. But because
the Lord does most manifest his glory in heaven, and from heaven, therefore
(...).
by an excellency is he said to be in heaven: and that in three especial
respects.

1. To show that there is no proportion betwixt him and earthly masters, be
they never so great. For as the heaven is higher then the earth, so is God more
excellent, yea infinitely more excellent then any man. Who is like unto the
Lord our God Psalm. 113. 5.
who dwells on high? There is no such difference betwixt masters and servants
on earth.

2. To show that he has his eyes continually on all his servants: he sees
every thing that they do, as one placed above others sees all that are under
him. Psalm. 102. 19.
From heaven does the Lord behold the earth. and 33. 13.
The Lord looks from heaven, he beholds all the sons of men. Prou. 15. 3.
The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. So
as this phrase notes the clean contrary to that which was before objected by
wicked Atheists.

3. To show that he is Almighty: able both to recompense his faithful
servants (whereupon David says, Unto thee lift I Psalm. 123. 1.
up mine eyes, o thou that dwell in the heavens) and also to execute
vengeance on those that are unfaithful to God, and cruel to their servants
(whereupon says Solomon, if thou see oppression Eccles. 5. 8.
etc. marvel not: for he that is higher then the highest regards.)

From this place of God (in heaven) we learn these lessons.

1. The eye of faith is needful to behold God withal, for heaven 7. Obseru.
Heb. 11. 27.
is too high for any bodily eye to pierce into. But by Faith did Moses see him
who is invisible.

2. Though masters had none on earth above them, yet is there 8. Obseru.
one higher then they. There is a master in heaven.

3. They who cannot be heard on earth, have yet one to appeal 9. Obser.
unto. There is a master in heaven.

4. The command under which earthly masters are, is far 10. Obseru.
greater then that which they have: for their commander is in heaven.

. 133. Of Gods having no respect of persons.
The Apostle further adds of God the great master of all, that with him there
is no respect of persons. The Hebrew word used to set forth this point
signifies (...)
a face: so does also the Greek word here translated (...).
person: it signifies both face and person. Now we know that the face of a man
is outward, and that which of all other parts makes him most amiable in
another eye. It is opposed to that which is inward, even the heart: in which
respect it is said that the Lord sees not as 1 Samuel 16. 7.
man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on
the heart. Here by a Synecdoche, face or person is put for every outward
quality, state, or condition which makes one to be preferred before another in
man's approbation, as beauty, comeliness, stature, wealth, honor, authority,
and the like. Now in that God receineth not, or respects not persons, it
shows that God prefers not any one before another for any the forenamed
outward respects, or any other like to them. Elihu plainly expounds this
phrase in these words, he accepts not the person of princes, nor regards
the Job. 34. 19.
rich more then the poor. The phrase is taken from them that sit in thrones of
judgment, where their eyes should be blinded, that they may not see the face
or person of those that are brought before them: but only hear the cause.

This properly is here noted of God, to meet with a vain conceit of many
masters, who though they know that God is their master as well as their
servants master, yet think that God will not call them so straightly to account,
but will suffer and tolerate them, because they are of a higher rank, and in a
better condition then servants: But by this phrase the Apostle shows that

To God all are alike: he puts no difference betwixt any. 11. Obser.
He will show favor to the meanest, as well as to the greatest: he will take
vengeance of the greatest as well as of the meanest.

Many good lessons may be learned from hence: as among other, these,

1. The poorest and meanest that be may have as free access to God as the
wealthiest and greatest: and their sure shall be as soon received.

2. The great ones on earth, have as great cause to fear the revenging hand of
God for any sin, as mean ones.

3. It becomes magistrates and all in authority to carry themselves
impartially toward all that are under them: for they are in Gods room.
Respect of persons is the cause of all that injustice and wrong which
magistrates do.

4. It becomes ministers to be faithful in all Gods house, and with an even
hand to sow the seed of Gods word, and to keep themselves pure from the blood
of all men: for they are Gods stewards and ambassadors; and therefore they must
have no respect of persons.

The second Treatise. PART I. Of Husband and Wife, who are so to be accounted.
. 1. Of those who may seek to be married.
Having in the former treatise laid down the foundation of all domestical
duties, by expounding the words of the Apostle, I purpose now distinctly to lay
them forth in order: beginning with the first and chiefest couple in the
family, Man and Wife.

Here we are first to speak of the persons who are to be accounted true and
lawful husband and wife: and then of the duties which they owe each to other.

So as this Treatise consists of two parts. 1. The first declares, who are
man and wife. 2. The second notes out those common mutual duties which they
owe one to another. First of the first.


Husband and wife are they who are rightly joined together Who are husband and
wife.
by the bond of marriage. See Treat. 1.. 82. and 84.
Whereby two are made one flesh.

For the better clearing of this point, we will consider both the parties that
may be so nearely joined together, and also the manner how they are rightly
joined in so firm an unity.

About the parties we are to search, 1. Who may seek a mate for marriage. 2.
What kind of mate is to be taken.


1. All they who are able without inevitable danger to their Who may marie.
yoke fellow to perform the essential duties of marriage, may be married.

Out of this proposition arise three questions to be discussed. 1. Who are to
be accounted able? 2. What danger is inevitable? 3. Whether marriage be free for
all but such?


. 2. Of ripeness of years in them that are to be married.
1. They are to be accounted able who have Ephebi. Vt iustas nuptias
contrahant, sint masculi puberes, foeminae viripotentes. Justin. Instit. l. 1.
tit. 10.
past the flower of their age, and are not by defect of nature, or any other
occasion made impotent.

1. Ripeness of years is absolutely necessary for consummating a just and
lawful marriage: wherefore as God at first, made Adam of full age, so when he
sought out a wife for him, he made her of full age too: he made her a woman,
not a child. Genesis 2. 22. 1 Cor. 7. 36.
Where the Apostle advises parents to take care for the marriage of their
children, he puts in this prouiso, if they pass the flower of their age.
Childhood is counted the flower of age. While the flower of the plant
sprouteth, the seed is green, unfit to be sown.

Quest. How long lasts the flower of age?

Answ. Justin. Instit. l. 1. tit. 22. Second part of Reports of Cases. 35. Hen.
6. fol. 41. b.
The civil law, and common law also, set down twelve years for the flower of
a females age, and fourteen, of a males; which is the least: for before those
years they can have no need of marriage, nor yet are well fit for marriage, so
as if they forbear some years longer, it will be much better for the parties
themselves that marie, Est invenum coniugium incommodum liberorum procreationi.
Cum enim in omnibus animantibus imperfecti sunt iuniorum partus, ac multo etiam
magis foeminarum, id etiam fiat in hominibus necesse est. Arist. Pol. lib. 7.
for the children which they bring forth, for the family whereof they are the
head, and for the common wealth whereof they are members. Note the ages of the
Kings of Israel and Judah when they were first married, and we shall find few
of them to be under twenty, and those few, not above one or two years under:
and yet of all sorts of people the Kings did use to marie the soonest, that so
they might have heirs betimes.

Object. 1 Chr. 22. 5. and 29. 1.
Solomon was but a child when he came to the crown, and yet 2 Chro. 12. 13.
he had then a child of a year old at least.

Answ. He was said to be a child not simply, but comparatively, 1 King. 2. 22.

old: which could not be if he had been in years a child when he began to
reign: for he reigned but forty years.

2. Object. Ahaz was but twenty year old when he began to reign, and reigned
but sixteen years, and yet when he died Hezekiah his son was five and
twenty year old, 2 Chro. 28. 1. and 29. 1.
by which computation Ahaz had a child when he was but eleven, or twelve year
old at most.

1. Answ. Some say that this was extraordinary, and render this reason, Ahaz so
young a father as Elizabet an old mother, Broughton in his Concent of Script.
should have hoped in Emmanuel of a virgin.

2. Answ. The beginning of that reign when Ahaz was but twenty year old, is
to be referred to Iotham his father; for Ahaz was twenty year old when he
(namely Iotham) began to reign: as 2 Chro. 36. 9.
Iehoiachin was eight year old, when he (namely his father Iehoiachim) began
to reign: for Iehoiachin was 2 King. 24. 8.
eighteen, when he himself began to reign.

Object. Iotham was but 2 Chro. 27. 1.
twenty and five year old when he began to reign, how then could Ahaz his
son at that time be twenty?

Answ. Iotham was five and twenty year old when his father Vzziah was struck
with leprosy, from which time he 2 Chro. 26. 21.
reigned as King even in his fathers life time. But after his father was dead,
the kingdom was established to him alone Parents sin in marying children
under age.
after a more solemn manner; in which respect it is said that then he began to
reign: and then was his son Ahaz twenty year old, Iotham himself being
about forty.

Contrary to the forenamed fitness of age is the practice of Puella dum ei
aetas matura non est, nulli dari vel promitti debet. Aug. epist. 233.
Matrimonium contractum verum non est si impubes fuerit qui contraxit.
Azpilcuet. Consil. and resp. l. 4. de spons. Cons. 8.
such parents, or other friends of children, as make matches for them in their
childhood, and move them to consent, and so cause them to be married: such
marriages are mock-mariages, and mere nullities. For children cannot know what
appertains to marriage, much less can they perform that which is required of
married persons: their consent therefore is justly accounted no consent, unless
they do ratify it after they come to years.

. 3. Of impotent persons that ought not to seek after marriage.
2. They are to be accounted impotent, and in that respect unable to perform
the essential duties of marriage, who (to use the Scripture phrase) were borne
Eunuchs from their mothers Mat. 19. 12.
womb: or by any accidental occasion are so made: as they who are defective,
or closed in their secret parts: or taken with an incurable palsy: or
possessed with frigidity, or any other such like impediment.

These ought not to seek after marriage: for by those signs of impotencie God
shows that he calls them to live single.

Contrary to this manifestation of Gods will do they sin, A sin to
conceal any impotencie.
who conceal their impotencie and join themselves in marriage, whereby they
frustrate one maine end of marriage, which is procreation of children; and do
that wrong to the party whom they marie, as sufficient satisfaction can never
be made.

. 4. Of barrenness, that it hinders not marriage.
Quest. Are such as are barren to be ranked among those impotent persons?
Answ. No, there is great difference betwixt impotencie and barrenness.

1. Impotencie may by outward sensible signs be known Sterilem coniugem fas
non est relinquere. Aug. de Nup. lib. 1. cap. 10.
and discerned, barrenness cannot: it is not discerned but by want of
childbearing.

2. Impotent persons cannot yield due benevolence: but such as are barren may.

3. Impotencie is incurable: but barrenness is not simply so. Many after they
have been a long while barren have become fruitful: and that not only by an
extraordinary work of God above the course of nature (as Genesis 18. 11.
Sarah and Luke 1. 7.
Elizabeth, with whom by reason of age it ceased to be after the manner of
women) but also by such a blessing as might stand with the course of nature,
being obtained by prayer (as Genesis 25. 21.
Rebeckah and 1 Samuel 1. 5, 20.
Annah) whereof daily experience gives good evidence: for many after 10, 15,
20, and more years barrenness have brought forth children.

On these grounds many Saints, who have been barren, have married, and their
practice therein not disallowed, nor their marriage dissolved. Tantum valet
sociale vinculu^ coniugum, vt cum causa procreandi colligitur, nec ipsa causa
procreandi soluetur. Aug. de bon. Coniug. cap. 7.
For though procreation of children be one end of marriage, yet is it not the
only end: and so inviolable is the marriage bond, that though it be made for
childrens sake, yet for want of children it may not be broken.

. 5. Of that inevitable danger which hinders marriage.
3. They who are infected with such contagious diseases, as diffuse themselves
into those who have society with them, and infect them also, ought not to
seek after marriage: for that cannot but turn to the danger of the party with
whom they marie. It was for mutual good one of another Genesis 2. 18.
that God ordained the law of marriage; to use it to the hurt and danger of one
another, is against the maine end of the first institution.

The law of shutting up a leper from all society with men proves as much; for
if lepers might not have mutual society 2 Chro. 26. 21.
with any man, much less might they have matrimonial society with a wife or
an husband.

By contagious diseases not only both the parties which company together will
be infected, but also their issue: whereby their disease which otherwise might
die with themselves, is propagated to their posterity. A like restraint may be
applied to such foul and loathsome diseases, as make the company and society
of that person, who is infected therewith, irkcsome, and odious to their
companion.

Contrary to the end and use of marriage do they sin, A sin to conceal a
contagious disease.
who conceal such diseases, and so join themselves in marriage, to the
unanswerable prejudice of the party whom they marry.

. 6. Of the lawfulness of marriage to all sorts of persons.
Where there is no such just impediment as has been before mentioned, it is
lawful for all sorts of people of what (...).
calling or condition soever to marry. For Marriage is honorable Heb. 13. 4.
in all, or among all, namely in, or among all sorts of people: whereupon it is
accounted a Doctrine of devils to forbid 1 Timothy 4. 1, 3.
to marry. For it is a Doctrine contrary to Gods word, and a Doctrine that
causes much inward burning, and outward pollution, and so makes their bodies,
which should be temples of the holy Ghost, to be sties of the devils.

The disease, for the redressing whereof marriage is sanctified, is a common
disease which has infected all sorts of people: why then shall not the remedy
be as common?

In this case the Apostle says indefinitly of all, without exception of any,
to avoid fornication let every man have his own 1 Cor. 7. 2, 9.
wife, and let every woman have her own husband. And again, If they cannot
contain let them marie: for it is better to marie then to burn.

Object. Mat. 19. 12.
There be Eunuchs which have made themselves Eunuchs (that is, have abstained
from marriage and lived in a single A deuillish doctrine to forbid marriage.
life continently) for the kingdom of heavens sake.

Answ. That is spoken of some particular persons to whom the gift of continency
was given: not of any distinct conditions, and callings, as if all and every
one of this or that calling had so done or were able so to do: whereupon
Christ adds this clause, He that is able to receive it, let him receive it,
and the Apostle to the same purpose says, 1 Cor. 7. 7.
every one has his proper gift of God.

Contrary to this necessary and warrantable liberty, is the impure and
tyrannical restraint of the Church of Rome, whereby all that enter into any of
their holy orders, are kept from marriage.

Do they not herein Act. 15. 10.
tempt God by putting a yoke upon men's necks, which neither our fathers nor we
are able to bear? Uide Chrysostom. hom. 4. in Isay 6.
No such restraint was ever enjoined by Gods word to any of those holy
functions which he ordained: for under the Law it was lawful for high Priests,
ordinary Priests, all sorts of Levites, and extraordinary Prophets, to marie:
and under the Gospel, for Omnes Apostoli exceptis Iohanne and Paulo vxores
habuerunt. Ambr. in 2 Cor. 11.
Apostles, Bishops, Deacons, and all Ministers of the word. Toll de Ecclesia
honorabile connubium, nonne reples eam concubinarijs incesluosis, seminifluis
mollibus, masculorum concubitoribus, and omni denique genere immundorum?
Bernard. in Cant. Sermon. 66. vide Bernard. de Conuers. ad ^ler. cap. 29.
Fearful have been the effects of this Diabolical doctrine: as fornication,
adultery, incest, Sodomie, buggerie, and what not? Many wives put from their
husbands, because their husbands were Ministers, and many Ministers put from
their calling because they had wives: many children by this means basely
borne, and among them many in their infancy cruelly murdered. Huldricus, seu
vt alij, Volusianus in Epist. ad Nichol. Pap.
Six thousand heads of infants were found in the ponds of a religious house.
How many more thousands have been from time to time cast into other ponds, or
buried in gardens, or other places, or other ways conveyed out of sight?
Deuillish must that doctrine needs be, which has such deuillish effects.
Vtinam qui continere non valent perfectionem temerarie profiteri, aut
coelebatui dare nomina vererentur. Sumptuosa siquidem turris est, and verbum
grande, quod non omnes capere possunt. Bernard. de Conuers. ad Cler. sermon. 29.
Well did he wish, that wished that all they who cannot contain, would take
heed how they do rashly profess perfection, and vow virginity.

. 7. Of the things which are absolutely necessary to make a person fit for
marriage.
They who have power to marie must be careful in choosing an help meet for
them: for Genesis 2. 18. Necessary for the essence of marriage.
this was Gods care when first he instituted marriage. To make an help meet for
marriage, some things are absolutely necessary for the very essence or being of
marriage; others, necessary for the comfort and happiness of marriage.

In regard of the former sort, there must be chosen,

1. One of the same kind or nature: for among all the creatures which were
made, Genesis 2. 20. Buggerie.
there was not found an help meet for man: therefore God out of his bone and
flesh made a woman of his 1. Persons of the same kind.
own nature and kind.

Contrary to this is the detestable sin of buggerie with beasts, expressly
forbidden by the Leu. 18. 23.
law. A sin more then beastly: for the bruit beasts content themselves with
their own kind: Monstrous it is in the kind thereof: and a cause of
abominable monsters. Vide Aug. de Ciuit. Dei lib. 15. cap. 23. and Lud. Uivem
in eundem de Incubis, and Succubis.
Contrary also is that copulation which witches have with devils: then which
none more unnatural, none more prodigious and odious.

2. One of the contrary sex: the male must choose a female: the female a male.
Thus God having made Adam a male, 2. Persons of diverse sexes. Maritalis copula
requirit sexuum aptitudinem. Bern. in Cant. sermon. 66. Unnatural commixtions.
Romans 1. 25, 26.
made Eve a female, and joined them in marriage. A conjunction of these
different sexes is only fit for increase of mankind, and other marriage duties.

Contrary are those unnatural commixtions of parties of the same sex: which
the Apostlereckoneth up as judgments inflicted on the heathen, because they
changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped, and served the creature
more then the Creator.

3. One beyond those degrees of consanguinitie and affinity which Persons
without the degrees of consanguinity.
are forbidden by the law of God: these degrees are expressed by Moses Leuit.
18. 6, 7, etc. and explained in a table of the degrees of consanguinitie and
affinity within which none may mary, appointed to be hung up in every Church.

Contrary is incest, a sin not only forbidden by Gods Incest. O mulieris
scelus incredibile, and praeter hanc vnam in omni vita inauditu^. O libidinem
effrenatam and indomitam! O audaciam, singularem! Non timuisse vim deorum,
hominumque famam? Vicit pudorem libido, timorem audacia, rationem amentia. Cic.
pro. A. Cluent.
word, but so horrible even to the heathen as (to use the Apostles words, 1
Cor. 5. 1.) it is not so much as named among the Gentiles. Excellently is that
censure verified by the heathen Orators patheticall exclamation against one
Sassia who married her son in law, in these words: O incredible wickedness of
a woman, not heard of in any age but this! O unbridled and untamed lust! O
singular boldness! Not to fear the power of God, and fame of men! etc. Lust,
impudency, madness, overcame shame, fear, and reason.

What may we now think of the dispensations which the Pope gives for
incestuous marriages, allowed unto great Princes even by the. 24. cap. 5.
Tridentine council? does he not herein show himself to be that man of sin,
who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God?

4. One that is free: nor married, nor betrothed to another: the law of marriage
notes thus much in this clause, Mat. 19. 5.
They two shall be one flesh. And in that Deuteronomy. 22. 22, 23, 24.
the law inflicteth the same punishment 2 These. 2. 3, 4. 4. Persons that are
free.
upon the person which being betrothed commits uncleanness, that it does
upon a married person, it is evident that it is unlawful to marie one betrothed
to another, as well as one married to another. So firm is a contract, as the
law calls a betrothed maid, a wife: and a betrothed maid might not be put
away without a bill of divorce.

Contrary is Bigamy, and Polygamy, whereof Treat. 1.. 83.
before: unto which head may be referred marriages with such as have been
espoused to others before. These are utterly unlawful.

. 8. Of the lawfulness of other marriages after one of the married couple is
dead.
1. Quest. Are they who have buried their husband or wife so free, as they may
marie again?
Answ. Yea, as free as they who were never before married. The law does not only
permit a widow to marie again: but Deuteronomy. 25. 5, 9.
if her husband died before he had any children, it commanded the next kinsman
that was living and free to marie her, that he might raise up seed to his
brother deceased: which if he refused to do, a penalty of ignominy was
inflicted on him: the widow rejected was to loose his shoe from his foot, Non
concederet hoc Paulus nisi liceret. At parum dico concedit: vult quoque. Volo,
inquit, adolescentiores nubere: nec dubium quin viduas dicat. Bern. sermon. 66.
in Cant.
and to spit in his face in the presence of the Elders. The Apostle expressly
says that a woman, when her husband is dead, is at liberty to be married (1.
Cor. 7. 39.) yea speaking of young widows he further says, I will that they
marie (1. Tim. 5. 14.) This liberty which the Prophet of God, and Apostle of
Christ grant to a wife, can by no show of reason be denied to an husband: for
the bond of marriage gives them a like power over one another body, (1 Cor. 7.
4.) and knitteth one as inuiolably as the other, (Mat. 19. 6.) Husbands
therefore as well as wives have used this liberty, as Abraham (Genesis 25. 1.)
Romans 7. 2.
The Apostle that gives this liberty, renders a reason thereof, taken from
the limitation of that time wherein married persons have power one over another,
and that is the time of this life only: For the woman which has an husband is
bound by the law to her husband, so long as he lives: but if the husband be
dead she is loosed, etc. On this ground all the. 24. Quid largam benedictionem
nuptiarum restringis? Bern. loc. ^itat. Dominus tot maritorum mulierem nulla
suae sententiae significatione damnauit. Aug. de bon. Vid. c. 12.
reasons which warrant or move such as never were married, to mary, may be
applied to them that by death have their yoake-fellow taken from them.

2. Quest. May this liberty be extended any further then to a second marriage?
Answ. We find no restraint from a third, or fourth, or more marriages, if by
the divine providence so many wives, or husbands one after another be taken
away while there is need for the suruiuing party to use the benefit of
marriage. The woman of Samaria that had five husbands one after another, is not
blamed for being married to so many, but for living with one (after the other
were dead) that was not her husband, (Ioh. 4. 18 Neither did the Lord condemn
that woman which was said to have seven husbands one after another, (Mat. 22.
25, etc.)

Contrary is the opinion of Secundas nuptias pro fornicationibus habent. Aug.
de haer.. 26.
Montanists, and Cataphryges, ancient heretics that accounted those marriages
which the suruiuor made after the death of a yoke fellow, to be adulterous:
with which heresy Tertullianus factus est haereticus quia transiens ad
Cataphryges cepit secundas ruptias ^^nquam ^upra damnare. Ibid.. 86.
Tertullian an ancient and learned father was so far infected, as he wrote a
treatise in defense thereof. It seems by their arguments that one maine
ground of their error was a misinterpretation of those Scriptures which forbid
men to have two wives at once, and women to have two husbands at once, as, Two
shall be one flesh, Genesis 2. 24. A Bishop and a Deacon must be the husband of
one wife, 1 Timothy 2. 2, 10. Let a widow be taken that has been the wife of one
husband, 1 Timothy 5. 9. These are indeed express texts against such Digamists,
and Polygamists as have been described Treat. 1. 83
before: but they make no more against second or other after-mariages one mate
being dead, then against first marriages. Into the roll of these heretics may
they be put, who deny such after marriages to any kind of Ministers. So do
our adversaries: they Ministerijs minorum ordinum exercendis suffici possunt
coniugati, dummodo non bigami. Council. Trid.. 23. c. 17. Vide Bellarm. de Cler.
l. 1. c. 23.
exclude such as are married again after one wife is dead from such functions
of inferior orders, as they admit those who are but once married unto. They
allege many of those Scriptures which Montanists do (as 1 Timothy 2. 2, 10. and
5. 9) which shows that they are infected with the same heresy, though they
pretend to renounce it.

. 9. Of equality in years betwixt husband and wife.
That matrimonial society may prove comfortable, it is requisite Acquale^
ducito Pittaci dictum. Sivis nubere, nube pari. Ovid. 1. Equality in age.
that there should be some equality betwixt the parties that are married in
Age, Estate, Condition, Piety.

1. For Age, as the party that seeks a mate must be of ripe years, fit to
give consent, and able to perform marriage duties, so the mate which is taken
must be somewhat answerable (...). Arist. Eth. l. 8. c. 12. Luke 1. 7.
in age: if one young, both young: if one of middle age, both so: if one grown
to years, the other also. It is noted of Zachary and Elizabeth, that both
were well stricken in years. If both were old together, then both also were
young together. Equality in years makes married persons more fit for
procreation of children, for a mutual performance of marriage duties each to
other, and for making their company and society every way more happy.

This equality is not over strictly to be taken, as if the married couple were
to be just of the same age, but only for some answerablenesse in years: which
may be though there be a disparitie Most meet that husbands be elder then wives.
of five or ten, or somewhat more years: especially if the excess of years
be on the husbands part: for besides that according to the ordinary course of
nature a man's strength and vigor lasts longer then a woman's, it is very meet
that the husband should be some what elder then his wife, because he is an
head, a governor, a protector of his wife. The Scripture notes many husbands
to be elder then their wives (as Abraham was ten years elder then Sarah; and
if we Genesis 17. 17.
narrowly mark the circumstances of the histories of Isaac and Jacob, and
their wives, we shall find that the husbands were elder then their wives) To
my remembrance an approved example of an husband younger then his wife cannot
be given out of Scripture.

Contrary to this equality in years, is the practice of many Unmeet for aged
persons to mary young ones.
men and women, who being aged, to satisfy their lust, or for some other
by-respect, mary such as are but in the flower of their age, wherein they do
many times much fail of their expectation: for those young ones finding the
society of aged folks to be burdensome, and irksome unto them, soon begin to
loath the same, and thereby cause more grief and vexation, then ever they did
give comfort and contentment.

On the other side, others there be who in the prime and Unmeet for young
persons to mary aged.
strength of their age, for wealth, honor, or such like respects, mary those
that with age begin to be decrepit, and unfit to be married, hoping that they
will not long live, but that with a little trouble they shall purchase much
dignity or riches, and after a while be free again. But God often meets with
such in their kind, by prolonging the life of those aged persons, and so
making the burden to be much more grievous and tedious then was imagined, and
by taking away those young ones sooner then they looked for, whereby it comes
to pass that all their hopes perish. Ne discrepent aetates sic vt vir
suscipere liberos possit; mulier non possit; aut haec possit, ille non possit.
Ex his enim seditiones, discordiaeque, etc. Arist. Pol. lib. 7.
The heathen observed inequality in years to be occasions of many mischiefs,
and thereupon prescribed rules against it.

. 10. Of equality in estat^ and condition betwixt those that are to be married
together.
2. Some equality in outward estate and wealth is also befitting Equality in
estate. Premitur magno coniuge nupta minor. Ovid. epist. 9.
the parties that are to be married together, lest the disparitie therein
(especially if it be ouer-great) make the one ^nsult over the other more then
is meet: for if a man of great wealth be married to a poor woman, he will
think to make her as his maid-seruant, and expect that she should carry her
self toward him so as beseems not a yoake-fellow, and a bedfellow: so as
such an one may rather be said to be brought unto bondage, then marriage. And if
a rich woman mary a poor man, she will look to be the master, and to rule
him: so as the order which God has established will be clean perverted: and
the honor of marriage laid in the dust. For where no order is, there can be no
honor.

3. The like may be said of outward condition, that therein 3. Equality in
condition. Eas vxores quas inferioris gradus homines ducant, hi qui altioris
dignitatis sunt ducere legibus propter dignitatem prohibentur.
also there be some equality: that Princes, Nobles, and Gentlemen, mary such
as are of their own rank: and the meaner sort such as are of their degree.
Note what sort of wives Abraham, Isaac, and Iaacob married, and it will appear
that they had respect to this paritie. Disparitie in condition as well as in
estate, is a means to make men and women swell and insult above that which is
meet: yea and to twit one another in the teeth with their former estate and
condition.

Contrary on the one side are the practices of such as affect Digest. lib. 23.
cap. 2.. 49. A fault to affect to mary a person much above ones rank. Qui
long praestantiores se ducunt, non coniugum viri, sed serui fiunt dotiu^.
Plut. de Instit. liber. Pro. 14. 1. and 12. 4.
to mary above their own estate and degree: thinking by such marriages to
advance themselves. This is the only thing which many seek after in seeking
wives and husbands; whereby it comes to pass that they often meet with the
worst matches, and make their marriage a kind of bondage unto them. Great
portions make many women proud, dainty, lavish, idle, and careless; a man
were much better, even for help of his outward estate, to mary a prudent,
sober, thriftie, careful, diligent wife, though with a small portion, then
such an one. A proud back, a dainty tooth, and a lavish hand will soon
consume a great portion; but a wise woman builds her house: and a virtuous
woman is a crown to her husband. Many wives also that are married to very rich
husbands, are more stinted and pinched in their allowance, then such as are
married to men of meaner estate. It is not the means which a man has, but his
mind and disposition that makes him free and bountiful to his wife.

Contrary are the marriages which men of great authority A fault to mary a
person much under ones rank.
and ability make with mean women, yea their own maids many times, and those
of the lowest rank, their kitchinmaids. (...) parties part that is to be
married: and then if that party be under the government of parents, the matter
must be moved to them, before there be any further proceeding therein, as
Sampson who seeing and liking a daughter of the Philistims, Judge. 14. 2.
told his father and his mother thereof. Yea though the party be not under the
government of any, yet it is very meet that counsel be taken of wise and
understanding friends: that in a matter so weighty as marriage is, there may be
the advice of more heads then one, for the preventing of such mischiefs as
through rashness might fall out. After a liking is thus taken by one party of
a meet mate, that liking must be moved to the other party so liked, to know
whether there be a reciprocal affection of one toward another. Thus Sampson
went and Judge. 14. 7.
talked with that woman whom he liked to be his wife. If at first there be a
good liking mutually and thoroughly settled in both their hearts of one another,
love is like to continue in them for ever, as things which are well glued, and
settled before they be shaken up and down, will never be severed asunder: but
if they be joined together without glue, or shaken while the glue is moist,
they cannot remain firm.

Mutual love and good liking of each other is as glue.

Let the parties to be married be herein well settled before they come to meet
with trials through cohabitation, and that love will not easily be loosened by
any trials.

Contrary is the adulterous and brutish practice of such as Too eager and
hasty pursuing after marriage, a brutish thing.
so soon as they cast their eye on any whom they like, never advise or consult
about a right and due proceeding unto marriage, but instantly with all the
eagerness and speed they can, like brute beasts, seek to have their desire
and lust satisfied. Though to keep themselves free from the penalty of the
laws under which they live, they procure means to be married, yet they declare
a lustful and adulterous mind. And their practice is too like to the practice
of the Beniamits, who caught wives from among the daughters of Shiloh as they
were dancing: or else to the practice of the old world, which so grieved the
Spirit of God, that it repented him that he had Judge. 21. 23.
made man, and thereupon he was moved to bring a general deluge on the whole
world. Their practice was this, that they took them wives of all that they
chose: that is, they rashly and Genesis 6. 2.
suddenly married whomsoever they liked, without any consideration of their
condition.

. 14. Of a contract what it is?
II. When both parties have manifested a mutual liking Ubi non est consensus
vtriusque, non potest esse matrimonium. Instit. iur. can. lib. 2. de nupt. tit.
11.
each to other, and upon mature deliberation and good advice do conceive one
to be a fit match for another, it is requisite that a joint consent and
absolute promise of marying one another before sufficient witnesses be made.
This rightly made is a contract, which is the beginning of a marriage.

The right making of a firm contract consists in two things:

1. In an actual taking of each other for espoused man and wife.

2. In a direct promise of marying each other within a convenient time. So as a
form of contract may be made to this purpose; First the man taking the woman
by the hand to say, I A. take thee B. to my espoused wife, and do faithfully
promise to marie thee in time meet and convenient. And then the woman again
taking the man by the hand to say, I B. take thee A. to my espoused husband,
and do faithfully promise to yield to be married to thee in time meet and
convenient. This mutual and actual taking of one another for espoused man and
wife in the time present, and a direct promise of marying one another
afterward, setleth such a right and property of the one in the other as cannot
be alienated without license had from the great Judge of heaven, who has by
his divine ordinance settled that right.

. 15. Of the grounds of a contract.
Quest. Is a contract absolutely necessary?
Answ. Though it have been an ancient custom continued Mos ille vete ribus
erat ante multum tempus sponsalia facere. Chrysostom. in Genesis Hom. 43.
in all ages, yet I dare not pronounce it to be so absolutely necessary, as the
want thereof should nullify a marriage, and make it to be no lawful marriage.
But surely it is so meet and requisite, as I would advise all Christians that
desire a blessing and good success on their marriage to be contracted before
they are married.

If there were no other ground for it but this, that God has sanctified it,
and commended it unto us by his word, it were enough to persuade such as fear
God to use it.

For I demand, why does God commend unto his Church any thing by his word, but
that his Church should make conscience of using it? Now that by Gods word it is
commended, is without contradiction most evident. For, not to insist on that
argument which, not without good probability, is alleged for the antiquity of
a contract, and thus collected from Gods ordering of that first ancient marriage
betwixt Adam and Genesis 2. 22.
Euah, God brought Euah to Adam on the first day that they were created to see
how he would like her, and upon the sight of her, and notice which withal he
had of her, by that wisdom which God gave him, he then took her to himself:
which taking is supposed to be but a contract, because Genesis 4. 1.
he did not know her till after his fall. If it be objected that Adam and Euah
are called Genesis 2. 25.
man and wife in the time of their innocence. It may be answered that those
titles Deuteronomy. 22. 24. Genesis 19. 14. Consuetudine Scripturarum sponsi viri, and
sponsae vocantur vxores. Hier. in Mat. 1.
are in Scripture given to such as are only contracted, to show the near and
firm conjunction betwixt parties espoused.

But not to insist on that which is but probable, it is more then probable that
Lots daughters were contracted: for it is said that Genesis 19. 14, 8. Quia iam
desponsatio facta erat, ideo vocat eos generos. Chrysostom. in hunc loc.
Lot had sons in law which married (or rather should marie) his daughters: and
withal it is said that they had not known man: now then it must needs follow
that they were called Lots sons in law because his daughters were espoused to
them. But most evident for this purpose is that difference which the Deuteronomy. 22.
22, etc.
law puts betwixt a pure virgin, an espoused maid, and a married wife. So as
contracted persons are in a middle degree betwixt single persons, and married
persons: they are neither simply single, nor actually married. To show that this
custom of a contract before marriage continued in Gods Church among the Saints,
it is expressly noted that Marie the mother of the Lord Luke 1. 27.
Jesus who lived many hundred years after that law, was contracted.

. 16. Of the reasons which show how requisite a contract is.
Many good and weighty reasons may be alleged to show how requisite it is
that a contract should go before marriage. For

1. It adds much to the honor of marriage, that it should be deliberatly and
advisedly step after step, by one degree after another consummated and made up.

2. It puts a difference betwixt such as intend marriage in the fear of the
Lord, for such holy ends as are warranted in the word, and such as intend it
only to satisfy their lust, or for other like carnal ends. For these can
admit no delay, as was noted In the end of. 13.
before. But they that use this solemn preparation by a contract before
marriage, show that they desire to have all things fit for so sacred a matter
duly performed; and therefore they are content to make some stay for the better
effecting thereof.

3. It is a means of knitting the hearts of the two parties to be married more
firmly and inuiolably together before they come to dwell together. For a
contract being the beginning of a marriage, it is an evident demonstration of
Gods counsel concerning the parties contracted, that God has prepared them
each for other to be man and wife: so as after the contract is made, they may
simply and absolutely pray each for other, that God would bless them one to
another, to live comfortably and happily together. Before a contract is made,
they can but upon supposition (if God have appointed them to be man and wife)
pray one for another. For often it falls out that after many great hopes and
likelihoods of proceeding in such or such a match, by some occasion or other it
is clean broken off: but a lawful contract knitteth so firm a knot as cannot
be broken: so as a man may conclude that being contracted to a woman she shall
be his wife: and so may a woman conclude of a man. The consideration hereof
will further move them more narrowly to observe what good qualities, or what
other things, which may make them more lovely one to another, are in each other.

4. It is a means to make them before hand prepare themselves to perfome such
marriage duties as Gods word requires of man and wife. For a contract gives
them assurance of marriage if they live unto it: so as then they cannot but know
that it is high time for them to think how they are to carry themselves, when
they come to live in house together: and withal to consider, what crosses
ordinarily do accompany the married estate, that they may be before hand
prepared wisely to pass them over, or patiently to undergo them.

5. It may be a means of discovering many hidden and close inconveniences,
which otherwise would never come to light. For many friends fearing lest the
discovering of some evils which are carried closely, should make a breach
betwixt themselves and their friends, will not make them known till they see
some urgent necessity to move them so to do. Though the evil be such, as
being known would hinder marriage, yet till they see some sure evidence, that
they shall indeed be married (if no just exception be put in) they will hope
that some other occasion may fall out to hinder the marriage, and in that
respect conceal their exception. But because a contract is the beginning of
marriage, after they have notice thereof, they will not forbear to disclose what
they know. For this end is it, that the contract is three several times openly
published in the Church, that if any do know any just cause why such persons
as are contracted may not lawfully proceed to marriage, they make known the
same. A commendable custom: and great pity, that it is so much neglected as
it is.

6. It may prevent many plots and practices of inueigling, or stealing away
maids and widows. For it often falls out, that when parents or other friends
have provided a good match for their daughter, or for some other under their
government, and all things on all parts well concluded, the wedding day
appointed, and all things fitted and prepared for the solemnizing of the
wedding, some desirous to forestall that marriage, by secret and cunning devices
get the bride away a few days before, if not on the very morning of the
intended wedding day, and mary her out of hand to another. That which makes
men so bold is, that they know a clandestine marriage being consummate shall
stand firm in law. But a legal contract preuenteth such mischiefs, because
it makes such a furtiue marriage utterly void. None therefore knowing that a
contract is lawfully made before hand, will be so bold, or rather so mad, as to
offer to frustrate a marriage after any such manner.

7. It is a means to stir up the parties which are to be married, more
carefully and diligently to provide all things fit for their dwelling together,
and well ordering their household before hand; that they be not to seek for
necessaries when they should use them. For being contracted, they know that it
cannot be long ere they must come to dwell together.

. 17. Of abusing, or neglecting a contract.
There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed doctrine of a contract. One
of attributing too much to it: another of derogating too much from it. Many
make it a very marriage, and thereupon have a greater solemnity at their
contract, then Nonnullis sponsis tam impotens est ardor libidinis, vt
corpusculo puellari vim adferant. Eras. in Inst. Matr.
at their marriage: yea many take liberty after a contract to know their
spouse, as if they were married: an unwarrantable and dishonest practice. Lots
daughters were See. 15.
contracted to husbands, and yet they are said to have known no man. The law
styles her that is contracted Deuteronomy. 22. 24.
a maid, to show that she ought to keep her self a virgin till the marriage be
consummate. Therefore Mary is thus described, Luke 1. 27.
a virgin espoused. But it is the common course of most to make light account
of this warrantable and honorable proceeding to marriage by a contract. Few
there be in comparison of the multitudes that are married, who make any
conscience thereof. They think it needless, and utterly neglect it. No
marvel that they meet with many mischiefs and inconveniences, when the means
of preventing the same are not used. Let such duly weight the reasons rendered
in the former section.

. 18. Of the distance of time betwixt the contract and marriage.
Quest. What distance of time must pass betwixt the making of a contract, and
consummating of marriage?
Answ. This must be left to the wise consideration of the parties contracted,
and of their friends, for the same time cannot precisely be prescribed to all.
Occasions may fall out either of hastening, or putting off the marriage. Only
extremes on both sides must be avoided. Neither ought the marriage be too
suddenly solemnized upon the contract: (then the ends and reasons of a
contract, before mentioned, are made void) nor yet too long put off (then may
Satan take occasion to tempt them for their incontinencie.) The laudable
custom of our and other Churches shows, that at least three weeks must
pass betwixt contract and marriage. For the contract is Rubr. before the form
of solemnizing of matrimony.
to be three times published, and that but once a week before the wedding be
celebrated. And we read that the virgin Mary was at least three months
contracted before Joseph took her to wife. For when the Angel first came to
her she was Luke 1. 27. 56.
espoused: after that she went to her cosen Elizabeth, with whom she abode
three months: and then being returned home Joseph was warned by an Angel to
take her to wife. I Mat. 1. 20.
note not this as a rule for every one precisely to follow. For the virgin Mary
had a just occasion to tarry three months with her old cosen Elizabeth: and
so may others have occasions to put off their marriages: which may be lawful,
so the marriage be not put off too long, and that there be a mutual and joint
consent of both parties. For after the contract is made, neither the man nor
the woman have the power of their own body.

Contrary is that unwarrantable course which many take, to Unlawful for
parties contracted long to absent themselves each from other. Deuteronomy. 24. 5.
be affianced and made sure to a wife, and then to travel beyond sea, or to
any other place, and be absent from their spouse a year, or two, or three, or
it may be more years. If a man might not go to war, nor be charged with any
business that should draw him from his wife the first year of his marriage,
much less may he absent himself for any long time after he is contracted but
not married. This may be a means to alienate the heart of his spouse from him
for ever.

. 19. Of a religious consecrating of marriage.
III. The last degree of consummating a marriage, is the open and public
solemnization thereof: which consists

1. In a religious consecration thereof. 2. In a civil celebration

A religious consecration of marriage is performed by the blessing of a public
Minister of the word in the open face of the Church in the day time. This of
old has been used of Christians, and still is continued among us. Though we
have neither express precept, nor particular pattern in Gods word for this
manner of solemnizing a marriage (for there is no particular form thereof set
down in the Scripture) yet it being agreeable to the general rules thereof,
we ought in conscience to subject our selves thereto.

The general rules are these, Let all things be done decently, 1 Cor. 14. 40.
and in order. The Churches of God have such a custom. Submit 1 Cor. 11. 16.
your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, with 1 Pet. 2. 13.
the like. But the foresaid manner of consecrating marriage, is very decent and
in good order, a laudable custom of the Churches, and an ordinance of those
governors under whom we live. Therefore warrantable, and to be observed.
Neither is this order, custom, and ordinance appointed without just and
weighty reasons. For

1. Marriage is a kind of public action: the well or ill ordering thereof much
tends to the good or hurt of family, Church, and commonwealth. For by
marriage families are erected, and Church and commonwealth increased and
continued.

2. Heb. 13 4.
Marriage is honorable. Treat. 1.. 80, 81, 82, etc.
The most sacred and inviolable bond that knitteth any two persons together.

3. Marriage is Prou. 2. 17.
Gods covenant, wherein he himself has a maine and principal stroke. For God
is the chiefest agent in joining man and woman in marriage.

On these grounds it has been thought very requisite that marriage should be
solemnized in the day time (as a work of light that need not be covertly and
closely done) and that in a public place, whether any, that will, may have
free access, either to except against it, and hinder it (if there be just
cause) or to be a witness thereof, and to add his blessing thereto. And among
public places the Church is thought the fittest, because it is the house of
prayer, where persons and actions are most solemnly blessed. And of all persons
a public Minister is thought to be the meetest to celebrate marriage, and to
join Coniugium benedictione sacer dotali sanctificari oportet. Ambr. epist. 70.
the parties to be married, together, because he stands in Gods room, and in
and by his ministry God joins them together, and blesses them: so as after
the minister has rightly joined man and wife together in matrimony, it may be
well said, Those whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder. The
form of consecrating marriage, which is prescribed in our liturgy or
common-prayer-booke, does so distinctly, perspicuously, and fully set down
whatsoever is to be observed and done by the parties to be married, their
parents, or other governors, and the Minister that joins them together, that
I can add nothing thereunto. There are declared the grounds, ends, and uses of
marriage. There open proclamation is made whether any can except against the
intended marriage. There each party is solemnly charged, that if either of them
do know any impediment, why they may not lawfully be married, to disclose it.
There also each party is openly demanded if freely and willingly they will
take one another for man and wife. There the duties of married persons are
declared, and they severally asked whether they will subject themselves thereto
or no. All which being openly professed, the parent or some in his stead is
called forth to give the Bride to the Bridegroom. Then they two actually
taking each other to be man and wife, and testifying the same by express
words, and by mutual pledges, the Minister in Gods name joins them together,
pronounces them to be lawful husband and wife, and by prayer craves Gods
blessing upon the action, and upon their persons. Thus is the marriage
consecrated, and they two made one flesh, that is, lawfully joined together by
the inviolable bond of marriage.

. 20. Of clandestine marriages.
Contrary are clandestine marriages, such as are made in private houses, or
other secret places, or in Churches without a sufficient number of witnesses,
or in the night time, or without a lawful Minister of the word, with the like.
As such seeking of secrecy takes much from the honor and dignity of
marriage, so it implies some evil cleaving thereto: For every Ioh. 3. 20.
man that evil does hates the light. There is little hope that such marriages
should have any good success. For where such means as are sanctified for
obtaining a blessing on marriage are neglected, what blessing can thereupon be
expected?

. 21. Of a civil celebrating of marriage.
Though upon the forenamed consecrating of marriage it be in regard of the
substance thereof fully consummate, yet for the greater solemnity of so
honorable a thing, it is very requisite that further there be added a civil
celebration of it: under Magnifico conuiuio nuptiae celebrantur: laeta omnia,
munera sponsalia, etc. Greg. Naz. ad Vital. vide plura ibid. de coniugij
solennitate. Marriage a time of rejoicing.
which I comprise all those lawful customs that are used for the setting
forth of the outward solemnity thereof, as meeting of friends, accompanying
the Bridegroom and Bride both to and from the Church, putting on best
apparel, feasting, with other tokens of rejoicing: for which we have express
warrant out of Gods word.

For the general, that the marriage time is a time of rejoicing, some gather
from the notation of the word, as if it were styled marriage of merry age. But
to let that pass, The Scripture uses to set forth a time of rejoicing by the
Isa. 62. 5.
joy of the Bridegroom over his Bride, and styles Ier. 33. 11.
the voice of a Bridegroom and a Bride, the voice of joy and gladness. And on
the contrary counts it a judgment, when Ier. 7. 34. Joel 2. 16.
joy is taken away from the Bridegroom and the Bride.

For meeting of friends at the time of marriage, it is noted that Genesis 29. 22.
Laban gathered together all the men of the place, when his daughter was
married. And when Sampson was married, Judge. 14. 11.
they brought thirty companions to him. And when a friend of the virgin Marie
was married, Ioh. 2. 2.
Jesus and his Disciples, besides many other, were invited thereto. And in the
parable of the marriage of the Kings son, it is noted that Mat. 22. 3.
many guests were bidden to the wedding. In all which histories it is further
noted, that feasts were made at the solemnizing of those marriages. And the
phrases which the Prophet uses of Isa. 61. 10. Ier. 2. 32.
a Bridegroomes decking himself with ornaments, and a Brides adorning her
self with Jewels, give warrant for putting on the best apparel at that time.

Here by the way let good heed be taken, that the things which may lawfully be
used, be not unlawfully abused, as commonly mariage-festiuities, and that
especially in feastings, are.

. 22. Of ill or well ordering marriage feasts.
Marriage feasts are abused, Abuse of marriage feasts.


1. When they are made at an unseasonable time: as on the Jsa. 22. 12, 13.
Lords day, or in a time of mourning.

2. When they exceed the ability of him that makes the Luke 15. 13.
feasts.

3. When the abundance prepared, is immoderatly taken, Luke 21 34.
even to gluttony and drunkenness. The lewd practice of drinking healths to
the Bridegroom and Bride, often causes much excess in drunkenness.

4. When too much time is spent therein. Isa. 5. 11.


5. When God is clean forgotten therein, and the company poisoned Isa. 5. 12.
with corrupt communication, unchaste songs, and the like.

6. When the needy and distressed are not remembered Am. 6. 6.
therein.

For preventing of these abuses, a seasonable time for celebrating Direction
for marriage feasts
marriage must be chosen out: and moderation used both by him that makes the
feast, and also by them that partake thereof: moderation I say in the measure
of eating and drinking, and in the time spent therein: which time must be
sanctified with such communication as is good to the use of edifying, that it
may minister grace unto the hearers. And for the more cheerfulness therein,
witty questions and doubtful riddles may be propounded (as Sampson did) to
exercise the wit Judge. 14. 12. Ephesians. 5. 19.
and judgment of the guests: there may be also singing Psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, making melody in their hearts to the Lord. Yea further, that
the marriage meeting, mirth, and feasting may be the better sanctified, good
choice is to be made of the guests that are invited thereto. Hereof we have a
worthy pattern in those who were married in Cana of Galile, Ioh. 2. 1, 2.
and invited to their feast Jesus, his mother, and his Disciples. Such as
Jesus, will minister occasion of sauourie and sanctified communication, whereby
all the guests may be much edified. ^uch as the virgin Mary will be a good
example of modesty, ^brietie, and other like Christian graces. Such as the
Disciples, will be far from scorning and deriding wholesome and ^ood
instructions, but rather give all diligent heed thereunto, ^^d lay them up in
their hearts.

Above all, that the mirth and joy of marriage be not dampt, as Belshazzars was,
let them that are married, and all that come Dan. 5. 5.
to rejoice with them, be sure that they have true assurance of their
spiritual marriage with Christ, and of a good right in him to the creatures
which they use. Otherwise their sins will be as that handwriting which
appeared to Belshazzar on the wall.

Finally, in regard of that liberty which God gives with plenty and
abundance to eat of the fat, and drink of the Nehe. 8. 10.
sweet, let the poor that scarce have sufficiency be remembered.

Thus by a right celebrating of marriage, is it much honored: and man and wife
with much honor are brought together.

. 23. Of the honor of marriage in regard of the first institution thereof.
Great reason there is why marriage should with such honor be solemnized. For
it is a most honorable thing. Honorable in the institution, ends,
privileges, and mystery thereof. No ordinance was more honorable in the
first institution thereof, as is evident by the Author thereof, the Place where
it was instituted, the Time when it was instituted, the Persons who were first
married, and the Manner of joining them together.

1. The Author and first Institutor of marriage was the Lord Genesis 2. 18, 21, 22
God. Could there have been a greater, or any way a more excellent Author?

2. The Place was Paradise; the most fair, glorious, pleasant, honorable,
commodious, and every way most excellent place that ever was in this world,
Place, though it be but a circumstance, adds much to the honor of a thing.
Solemat ordinances are made in honorable places. Thus with us marriages are
solemnized in Churches, not in private houses.

3. The Time was the most pure and perfect time that ever was in the world,
when no sin or pollution of man had stained it, even the time of man's
innocence. Purity adds much to the honor of a thing.

4. The Persons were the most honorable that ever were even the first father
and mother of all mankind, they who had an absolute power and dominion over
all creatures, and to whom all were subject. None but they ever had a true
monarchy over the whole world.

5. The Manner was with as great deliberation as ever was used in instituting
any ordinance. For first the three glorious Genesis 2. 18. Cui hoc dicitur? non
creatae alicui potentiae, sed ei qui exse natus est, Consiliario admirabili,
etc. Chrysostom. in Genesis hom. 14.
persons in the Trinity do meet to advise about it. For The Lord God said, and
to whom should he speak? not to any created power, but to him that was
begotten of himself, that Wonderful, Counselor, etc. In this consultation
this ordinance is found to be very needful: (It is not good for man to be
alone) thereupon a determination is set down, to make an help meet for man.
For the better effecting hereof the Lord proceeds thereto very deliberatly,
by sundry steps, and degrees.

1. All the creatures that lived on the earth, or breathed in the air, are
brought before man, to see if an help meet for him might be found among them.

2. Every of them being thoroughly viewed, and found unfit, another creature is
made and that out of man's substance and side, and after his image.

3. This excellent creature thus made is by the maker thereof presented to man,
to see how he would like it.

4. Man manifesting a good liking to her, she is given to him to be his wife.

5. The inviolable law of the near and firm union of man and wife together is
enacted.

Let all the forenamed branches concerning the first institution of marriage
expressly recorded by the holy Ghost be well weighed, and we shall easily see
that there is no ordinance now in force among the sons of men so honorable
in the institution thereof, as this.

. 24. Of the Ends of Marriage.
2. The Ends for which marriage was ordained add much to the honor thereof.
They are especially three. Prima societas in ipso coniugio est etc. Id aute^
est principium vrbis, and quasi seminarium reip. Cic. Offic. lib. 1.


1. That the world might be increased: and not simply increased, but with a
legitimate brood, and distinct families, which are the seminaries of cities and
commonwealths. Yea also that in the world the Church by an holy seed might be
preserved, and propagated, Mal. 2. 15.

2. That men might avoid fornication (1 Cor. 7. 2.) and possess their vessels
in holiness and honor. In regard of that Qui tentationum procell as cum
difficultate salutis tolerant, coniugij portum petant. Greg. in Post. part. 3.
admon. 28.
pronenesse which is in man's corrupt nature to lust, this end adds much to
the honor of marriage. It shows that marriage is as an haven to such as are in
ieopardy of their salvation through the gusts of temptations to lust. No sin
is more hereditary; none whereof more children of Adam do partake, then this.
Well might Christ say (Mat. 19. 11) all men receive not this saying.

Of all the children of Adam that ever were, not one to a million of those that
have come to ripeness of years have been true Eunuchs all their life time.
Against this hereditary disease no remedy is so sovereign as this. Yea for
those that have not the gift of continency this is the only warranted, and
sanctified remedy.

3. That man and wife might be a mutual help one to Ad adiumentum mulier data
est viro. Ambr. Offic. l. 1. c. 28.
another, (Genesis 2. 18.) An help as for bringing forth, so for bringing up
children; and as for erecting, so for well governing their family. An help
also for well ordering prosperity, and well bearing adversity. An help in
health and sickness. Ut non solum honest, sed and commode viuat. Chrysostom. in
Genesis 2. hom. 14.
An help while both live together, and when one is by death taken from the
other. In this respect it is said (Pro. 18. 22.) who so finds a wife, finds
a good thing, which by the rule of relation is true also, of an husband. Licet
adiuvent hominem laboribus suis multa irrationabilla, nullum tamen par est
rationali mulieri. Chrysostom. ibid.


No such help can man have from any other creature as from a wife; or a woman
as from an husband.

. 25. Of the Privileges of marriage.
III. If ( Romans 3. 1.
as once of circumcision) it be demanded what is the privilege, advantage, and
profit of marriage, I answer, Much every way.

1. By it men and women are made Husbands and Wives.

2. It is the only lawful means to make them Fathers and Mothers.

3. It is the ordinary means to make them Masters and Mistresses. All these
are great dignities, wherein the image and glory of God consists.

4. It is the most effectual means of continuing a man's Unusquisque in
liberis suis quodammodo renascitur etc. Plato de Leg. lib. 4.
name and memory in this world, that can be. Children are living monuments, and
lively representations of their parents.

5. Many privileges have of old been granted to such as were married. Appian.
lib. 2. debel. ciu.
In pleading causes, or giving sentence, they had the first place; and in
choice of offices they were preferred. Sucton. in Aug.
In meetings they had the upper hand. Arist. Polit. li. 2. cap. 7. and Codic
lib. 10. tit. 63.
And if they had many children they were exempted from watchings, and other
like burdensome functions. Among us, if the younger sister be married before
the elder, the preheminency and precedence ^s given to the younger.

The privileges and honors which are given to married persons, were
questionless the ground of that custom which Laban mentions of his country;
that the younger was not to Genesis 29. 26.
be married before the elder.

. 26. Of the mystery of Marriage.
IIII. Great is that mystery which is set forth by marriage, namely the sacred,
spiritual, real, and inviolable union betwixt Christ and his Church: which is
excellently deciphe^ed in Salomons Song, and in Psalm. 45. and expressly noted,
Ephesians. 5. 32.

Hereby man and wife who entirely, as they ought, love one another, have an
evident demonstration of Christ's love to them. For as parents by that affection
which they bear to their children, may better discern the mind, and meaning
of God toward them, then such as never had child, so may married persons
better know the disposition of Jesus Christ, who is the spouse of every
faithful soul, then single persons.

. 27. Of Marriage and single life compared together.
Let now the admirers and praisers of a single estate bring forth all their
reasons, and put them in the other scole against marriage. If these two be duly
poised, and rightly weyed, we shall find single life too light to be compared
with honest marriage. All that can be said for the single estate, is grounded
upon accidental occasions. Saint Paul, who of all the penmen of holy
Scripture has spoken most for it, draws all his commendations to the head of
Expediency, and restrains all unto 1 Cor. 7. 26. (...).
present necessity.

Object. He uses these words ( Verse. 1.
good, and Verse. 38.
better.)

Answ. Those words have relation not to virtue, but to expediencie: neither are
they spoken in opposition to vice and sin, for then would it follow, that to
marie (which is Gods ordinance, and honorable in all) were evil and sinful:
which is to revive Saturniliani de quibus Epiph. haer. 23.
that ancient heresy, that marriage is of the devil. Si quis coinquinationem
vocet legitima^ commixtionem, habet inhabitatorem draconem Apostatam. Ignat.
Epist. ad Philad.
Of old they who have called lawful marriage a defilement, have been said to
have the Apostate dragon dwelling in them. But the Apostle styles that good,
which is commodious, and that better which is more expedient: and yet not
simply more expedient, but to some persons at some times. For if any have not
the gift of continency, it is not only commodious or more expedient that they
marie, but also absolutely necessary. They are commanded so to do (1 Cor. 7.
9.) Yet on the other side, if any have the gift of continency, they are not
simply bound from marriage; there be other occasions, beside avoiding
fornication, to move them to marie. It is therefore truly said that Virginity
is not commanded, but advised unto. Uirginitas non est iussa sed admonita.
Bernard. de modo been viu. sermon. 21.
We have no precept for it, but leave it to the power of them that have that
power. So far forth as men and women see just occasion of abstaining from
marriage (being at least able so to do) they are by the Apostle persuaded to
use their liberty and keep themselves free. But all the occasions which De
virginitate praeceptum non habemus: volentium potestati id relinquimus.
Constit. Apost. li. 4. cap. 14.
move them to remain single arise from the weakness and wickedness of men.
Their wickedness who raise troubles against others, their weakness who suffer
themselves to be disquieted and too much distracted with affairs of the
family, care for wife, children, and the like. Were it not for the wickedness
of some, and weakness of others, to please an husband 1 Cor. 7. 32, 33, 34.
or a wife, would be no hiderance to pleasing of the Lord. If therefore man had
stood in his entire and innocent estate, no such wickedness or weakness had
seized upon him: and then in no respect could the single estate have been
preferred S. Ecclesia and virginitatem glorificat, and nuptias pudicas honorat.
Epiph. haer. 48.
before the married. But since the fall, Virginity (where it is given) may be of
good use: and therefore the Church does give due honor both to virginity and
marriage.

. 28. Of celebrating marriage with sorrow.
Contrary to the forenamed joyful celebrating of marriage are all those
indirect courses which bring much grief, trouble and vexation thereunto: as
forced, stolen, unequal, or any other way unlawful marriages: marriages without
parents, or other governors and friends consent: or hudled up to avoid the
danger of law for former uncleanness committed, with the like. Many by their
preposterous and undue performing of so weighty a matter, do not only cause
great trouble and disquietnesse on the marriage day, but also much sorrow all
the days of their life. If such find no joy, comfort or help in marriage, but
rather the contrary, let them not blame Gods ordinance, but their own folly
and perverseness.

The second Treatise. PART. II. Of common-mutuall duties betwixt Man and Wife.
. 1. Of the heads of those common-mutuall duties.
IN the first part of this Treatise concerning Man and Wife, has been
declared, who are so to be accounted: in this second part their common-mutuall
duties are to be laid forth. These are either De necessitate ad esse.
absolutely necessary for the being and abiding of marriage: or De honestate ad
been esse.
needful and requisite for the well being and well abiding of it, that is, for
the good estate of marriage, and for a commendable, and comfortable living
together.

There are two kinds of the former, 1. Matrimonial Unity. 2. Matrimonial
Chastity.

The latter also may be drawn to two heads: for they are either such as the
married couple are mutually to perform each to other: or such as both of them
are jointly to perform to others.

Those mutual duties are 1. A loving affection of one to another. 2. A
provident care of one for another.

Under that provident care I comprise both the Means whereby it may be the
better effected (which is Cohabitation) and the Matter wherein it consists:

And this respects, 1. The Soul, 3. The Good-name of each other. 2. The
Body, 4. The Goods

The joint duties which are to be performed to others,

respect 1. Those who are in the house. 2. Those who are out of the house.

They who are in the house are 1. Members of the family. 2. Guests which come
to the family.

Many more particulars are comprised under these general heads, which I
purpose distinctly to deliver, as I come to them in their several proper
places.

. 2. Of Matrimonial unity.
The first, highest, chiefest, and most absolutely necessary common-mutuall
duty betwixt Man and Wife, is Matrimonial Unity, whereby husband and wife
do account one another to be one flesh, and accordingly preserve the
inviolable union whereby they are knit together. This is that duty which the
Apostle inioyneth to husbands and wives, in these words, Let 1 Cor. 7. 10, 11.
not the wife depart from her husband: Let not the husband put away his wife.
He there speaks of renouncing each other, and making the matrimonial bond
frustrate, and of no effect: which bond he would have to be kept firm and
inviolable, and they two who are thereby made one, constantly to remain one,
and not to make themselves two again. This matrimonial unity is so
necessary, as it may not be dis-united or dissolved though one be a Christian,
the other a Pagan. If any brother 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13.
(says the Apostle) has a wife that believes not, let him not put her away.
And the woman which has an husband that believes not, let her not leave him.

The reasons of this inviolable union are especially two: One taken from the
Author of marriage: the other from the Nature thereof.

1. The Author of marriage is God. It is his ordinance: and Genesis 2. 18, 22, 24
he it is that by his ordinance has made of two, one flesh. Now mark the
consequence which Christ as a ruled case, and undeniable principle infers
thereon, What God has joined together Mat 19. 6.
let no man put asunder: If no man, then nor wife, nor husband himself.

2. Such is the Nature of the matrimonial bond as it makes of two one, and
See Treat. 1. 79, 80.
more firmly binds them two together, then any other bond can bind any
other two together, how then should they be two again?

. 3. Of Desertion.
The vice contrary to matrimonial unity is Desertion, when one of the married
couple through indignation of the true religion, and utter detestation thereof,
or some other like cause, shall apparently renounce all matrimonial unity,
and withdraw him or her self from all society with the other, and live among
Infidels, Idolaters, heretics, or other such persecutors, as a faithful
Christian with safety of life, or a good conscience, cannot abide among; and
though all good means that can be thought of be used to reclaim the party so
departed, yet nothing will prevail, but obstinatly persisteth in renouncing
all matrimonial fellowship.

This Desertion is in the case of marriage so capital, as it Infidelis
discedens in matrimonium peccare dignoscitur: itaque non est ei fides seruanda
coniugij. Ambr. in 1 Cor. 7.
freeth the innocent party from any further seeking after the other. In which
respect the Apostle says, If the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother
or a sister is not under bondage in such cases, 1 Cor. 7. 15. By bondage he
means matrimonial subjection (by reason whereof neither of the married
persons have power of their own body, but one of the others.) Now they that
are not under this bondage, are not bound to seek after it. That Desertion
therefore on the delinquents (...). Phot. in 1 Cor. 7. Luth. de matrim. Calu.
epist. 227. Beza in lib. de Diuort.
part is such dissolution of marriage, as freeth the innocent party from the
bondage thereof. In many reformed Churches beyond the seas Desertion is
accounted so far to dissolve the very bond of marriage, as liberty is given
to the party forsaken to marie another: and it is also applied to other cases
then that which is above mentioned: as when an P. Martyr in 1 Cor. 7. 13.
Melanct. in loc. de Coniug.
Infidel, Idolater, or Heretic shall depart from one of the true religion
for other causes then hatred of religion: or when both man and wife having
lived as Idolaters among Idolaters, Zanchius de Oper. Dei lib. 4. cap. 1.
one of them being converted to the true faith, leaves his abode among
Idolaters, and goes to the professors of the true faith, but can by no means
get the other party to remove: or when one of the true religion shall depart
from another of the same profession, and will by no means be brought to live
with the party so left, but openly manifests peremptory obstinacy; the
matter being heard and adjudged by the Magistrate, the marriage bond may be
broken, and liberty given to the party forsaken to mary another. But because
our Church has no such custom, nor our law determined such cases, I leave
them to the custom of other Churches.

. 4. Of matrimonial Chastity.
The second necessary common-mutuall mariage-dutie is Matrimonial chastity.
Chastity in a large extent is taken for all manner of purity in soul or
body: in which respect the Apostle calls the Church of God a chaste virgin.
But in the 1 Cor. 11. 2.
sense wherein we here use it, it especially appertains to the body: which is
that virtue whereby we possess our vessels (to 1 Thessalonians. 4. 4.
use the Apostles phrase) in holiness and honor: or more plainly to our
purpose, whereby we keep our bodies undefiled.

Chastity thus restrained to the body is of Single life. Wedlock.

That of single life is opposed to fornication: and it is either of such as
never were married. Such an one was S. Paul, in which respect he wishes that
all were as he, 1 Cor. 7. 7. Or of such as are lawfully freed from the bond of
marriage. Such an one the Apostle calls (...). 1 Timothy 5. 5. Paphnutius
congressum cum legitima vxore castitatem esse dicebat. Socr. hist. Eccl. l. 1.
cap. 11.
a widow indeed. Chastity of wedlock is that virtue whereby parties married,
observing the lawful and honest use of marriage, keep their bodies from being
defiled with strange flesh: thus the Apostle commands wives to be chaste,
Tit. 2. 5. So as Qui leges coniugij seruat homini continenti par sit. Greg.
Naz. Cygn. Carm.
they that keep the laws of wedlock are as chaste as they that contain.

Here by the way note the dotage of our adversaries, who think there is no
chastity, but of single persons: whereupon in their speeches and writings
Clerici castitatem professi matrimonium contrahere non possunt. Council. Trid.
24. Can 9.
they oppose chastity and matrimony one to another, as two contraries.

Some of their holy Fathers and Popes, and those not the least learned, nor of
worst note among them, have inferred by their arguments against Priests
marriage, that Marriage is a living in the flesh, a sowing to the flesh, a
pollution of the flesh. To that Siricius and Innocentius 3. Gratian. Decr.
distinct. 31. 82. 1 Cor. 7. 5.
purpose S. Paul's advice to man and wife to abstain, that they may give
themselves to fasting and prayer, is urged: but directly contrary to the
intent of the Apostle. For,

1. He speaks there of extraordinary humiliation. 2. He interposeth this
limitation, for a time. 3. He says not simply, that ye may pray, but that ye
may give your selves. (or have (...). Non dixit simpliciter vt oretis, sed vt
vacetis orationi: ac sirem impediat, non coinquinet. Chrysostom in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19.
leisure) to prayer: as if it did only hinder, but not pollute prayer.

But how can the forenamed spots and blots of marriage stand with that beauty
and glory wherewith the Apostle sets it forth in these words, Marriage is
honorable in all, H^b. 13. 4. If marriage were as Papists set it forth to be,
the mariagebed were very unfitly called a bed undefiled.

Behold how contrary the spirits of S. Paul and of their Popes were. I wot
well far more contrary then chastity and matrimony.

But to return to our matter, clear it is, that married persons may be chaste,
and accordingly they ought to be chaste. To which purpose the Apostle
counselling men and women, for avoiding fornication, to have wives and
husbands, inserteth this particle OWN (Let every man have his OWN wife, 1
Cor. 7. 2. (...).
and every woman have her OWN husband) whereby he implies, that they should
not have to do with any other. That which Prou. 5. 19. See more of this text
in Treat. 4.. 11.
Solomon expresses of an husband, by the rule of relation must be applied to a
wife. As the man must be satisfied at all times in his wife, and even ravished
with her love; so must the woman be satisfied at all times in her husband, and
even ravished with his love. By the like rule the precept given to wives, to be
chaste, must husbands take as directed to themselves Tit. 2. 5.
also, and be chaste. This duty did Isaak and Rebekah faithfully and mutually
perform each to other.

1. It was one maine end, why marriage (especially since the Reasons for
mariage-chastitie.
fall of man) was ordained, to live chastely. This the Apostle implies, where
he says, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let
every woman have her own husband. 1. Chastity one end of marriage. 1 Cor. 7.
2. Ibid. verse. 9.
And again, If they cannot contain let them marry.

2. By chastity is a godly seed preserved on earth. By this reason does the
Prophet Malachie enforce this duty. For after he had said, that the Lord made
one, meaning of two one flesh 2. By chastity a godly seed preserved. Mal. 2.
16.
by marriage, he infers this exhortation, Therefore take heed to your spirit,
and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth.

3. An especial part of the honor of marriage consists in 3. Chastity the
honor of marriage. Heb. 13. 4.
chastity: whereupon the Apostle having given this high commendation of
marriage, that it is honorable in all, adds this clause (and the bed
undefiled) to show the reason of that honor. As if he had said, Because the
mariage-bed is in it self a bed undefiled, marriage is therefore in it self
honorable, and does so far remain honorable, as the bed remains
undefiled.

. 5. Of Adultery.
The vice contrary to matrimonial chastity is Adultery, one of the most
capital vices in that estate: a vice whereby way is made for Divorce: as is
clear and evident by the determination of Christ himself, concerning that
point, first Matthew. 5. 32.
propounded in his sermon on the mount, and again Matthew. 19. 9. Christus ab
adultera vero separari permittit. Greg. Naz. Orat. 36. Vir post fornicationem
non est vir, Chrysostom. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7.
repeated in his conference with the Pharisees, where condemning unjust
divorces, he excepteth the divorce made for adultery.

And great reason there is thereof. For 1 Cor. 6. 16.
the adulterer makes himself one flesh with his harlot. Why then should he
remain to be one flesh with his wife? Two (says the Law) shall be one flesh:
not three. The like may be said of a wife committing adultery.

. 6. Of pardoning adultery upon repentance.
Quest. Seeing by adultery just cause of divorce is given, may this fault upon
the repentance of the delinquent person be so forgiven, as no divorce be sought
by the innocent person, but both continue to live together in wedlock as
before?

Answ. Though it be not meet in this case, to impose it as an inviolable law
upon the innocent party, to retain the delinquent, because of repentance (for
we have direct and strict warrant for it) yet I doubt not but they may so do,
if they will, and that without just exception to the contrary, they ought so
to do. For the law of divorce did not necessarily enjoin any to sue out the
bill, but only afforded them liberty to use that punishment if they saw cause.
I doubt not but for warrant of this liberty, we may take Gods pattern, in
retaining Churches and people after they have committed spiritual adultery:
and Christ's forgiving the woman that had committed adultery. For, Postquam
Christus ait adulterae, nec ego te damnabo: vade, deinceps noli peccare, quis
non intelligat, debere maritum ignoscere quod videt ignouisse Dominum ambor um:
nec iam se debere adulteram dicere cuius poenitentis crimen diuina credit
miseratione deletam? Aug. de adult. Coniug. lib. 2. cap. 6.
Seeing Christ said to an adult eresse, I condemn thee not, go and sin no
more, who cannot conceive that an husband ought to forgive that which he sees
the Lord both of husband and wife has forgiven: and that he ought not to
account her an adulteress, whose fault he believes to be blotted out, by the
mercy of God, upon her repentance?

. 7. Of the difference of adultery in a man, and in a wife.
Quest. Is the bond of marriage as much violated on the Adultery as great a
sin in a man as in his wife. Lex Jul. de Adult. l. 1. Orif. Codic. in l.
Illust. Greg. Sayr. Clau. reg. l. 9. c. 16.
man's part when he commits adultery as on the woman's when she does so?

Answ. Though the ancient Romans and Canonists have aggrauated the woman's fault
in this kind far above the man's, and given the man more privileges then the
woman, yet I see not how that difference in the sin can stand with the tenor
of Gods word. I deny not but that more inconveniences may follow upon the
woman's default then upon the man's: as, greater infamy before men, worse
disturbance More inconveniences of a woman's adultery, then a man's.
of the family, more mistaking of legitimate, or illegitimate children, with
the like. The man cannot so well know which be his own children, as the woman;
he may take base children to be his own, and so cast the inheritance upon
them; and suspect his own to be basely borne, and so deprive them of their
patrimony. But the woman is freed from all such mistakings. Yet in regard of
the breach of wedlock, and transgression against God, the sin of either
party is alike. Gods word makes no disparity betwixt them. At the beginning
God said of them both, Mat. 19. 5.
they two shall be one flesh: not the woman only with the man, but the man also
with the woman is made one flesh. 1 Cor. 7. 3, 4.
Their power also over one another in this respect is alike. If on just
occasion they abstain, Verse. 5.
it must be with mutual consent. If the husband leave his wife, Verse. 15.
she is as free, as he should be, if she left him. Accordingly the punishment
Tanto grauius viros puniri oportet, quanto magis ad eos pertinet and virtute
vincere, and exemplo regere soeminas. Aug. de adult. Coning. l. 2. c. 8.
which by Gods law was to be inflicted on Adulterers is the same, whether the
man or the woman be the delinquent, (Deuteronomy. 22. 22.) If difference be made, it
is meet that adulterous husbands be so much the more severely punished, by how
much the more it appertains to them to excel in virtue, and to govern their
wives by example.

. 8. Of the heinousness of Adultery.
But to return to the discovery of the heinousness of Adultery, I find no
sin thorowout the whole Scripture so notoriously in the several colors
thereof set forth, as it is. For besides that it is 7. Commandment.
by name forbidden in the Decalogue, it is further expressly branded to be
committed,

1. Against each person in the holy Trinity: the Father (whose Prou. 2. 17.
covenant is broken) the Son (whose 1 Cor. 6. 16.
members are made the members of an harlot) and the Holy Ghost (whose 1 Cor. 6.
19.
Temple is polluted.)

2. Against ones neighbor, as Genesis 34. 31.
the party with whom the sin is committed (for this sin cannot be
committed singly by one alone) the husband and wife of each party Prou. 6. 35.
who cannot rest contented with any satisfaction) the Genesis 21. 10. Judge. 11. 2.
Deuteronomy. 23. 2.
children borne in adultery (whom they brand with an indelible character of
infamy, and deprive of many privileges that otherwise they might enjoy) the
Leuit. 21. 9. Genesis 34. 7. 2 Samuel 13. 22.
alliance and friends of each party (to whom the grief and disgrace of this
foul sin reaches) the whole family appertaining to either of them (for Job
31. 12. 2 Samuel 12. 10.
this is as a fire in an house) the town, city, and nation where such
unclean birds roost (for Genesis 34. 27. Judge. 20. 10. Hos. 4. 3.
all they lie open to the vengeance of God for this sin) and the very Church
of God (the Mal. 2. 15.
holy seed whereof is by this sin hindered)

3. Against the parties themselves that commit this sin, and that against
their Prou. 6. 32.
souls, 1 Cor. 6. 18.
bodies, Prou. 6. 33.
name, Prou. 6. 26.
goods, and all that appertains to them.

As this sin is in it self a sinful sin, so by the bitter and The bitter
fruits of Adultery.
cursed fruits which proceed from it, it is made out of measure sinful. For

1. By it husbands and wives affection (which of all other ought to be the most
inviolable) is so alienated, as seldom it is reconciled again.

2. By it the goods of the family are much wasted: the adulterous husband
spending that wherewith he should provide for his family, on his harlot: and
the adulterous wife purloining what she can from her husband.

3. By it husbands and wives are stirred up to wish, and long after one
another death: and not only inwardly in heart to wish it, but outwardly also
in deed to practice it.

4. If from this sin there arise not a gauling and terrifying conscience (as
often there does) then (which is worse) a seared conscience, an hard heart, a
reprobate sense, and an impudent face.

Wherefore God accordingly deals with such sinners. In Gods judgments against
adultery.
his soul Prou. 22. 14.
he hates them: by his word he has denounced many fearful judgments
against them, both in Hos. 4. 2, 3.
this world, and in Reu. 21. 8.
the world to come (against no sin more.) This sin is reckoned to be one of
the most principal causes of the greatest judgments that ever were inflicted
in the world: as of the Genesis 6. 2, etc.
general deluge: of that Ezekiel. 16. 50.
fire and brimstone which destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah: of Leuit. 18. 28.
Canaans spuing out her Inhabitants: of that Number. 25. 9.
plague which destroyed in one day 24000: and of the Ier. 5. 7, 8, 9.
Israelites captivity, with the like: By all which we see that fearful doom
verified, Heb. 13. 4.
Whoremongers, and adulterers God will judge. Now consider what Heb. 10. 31.
a fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God.

. 9. Of remedies against Adultery, and in particular of due benevolence, and
of defect or excess therein.
For preventing this heinous sin (to omit many other remedies which Gods word
has prescribed, as Pro. 6. 25.
a diligent keeping of the heart (that lustful thoughts proceed not from
thence) of the Job 31. 1.
eyes (that they wander not on the beauty or propernesse of any ones person,
or on lascivious pictures, or any other like allurements) of the Pro. 7. 21.
ears (that they hearken not to any inticements of others) of the Ephesians. 5. 4.
tongue (that it utter no unchaste and corrupt communication) of the Pro. 7. 13.
lips (that they delight not in wanton kisses) of the Pro. 6. 29.
hands (that they use no wanton daliance) of the Pro. 7. 25.
feet (that they carry thee not too near to the place where adultery may be
committed) of thy Ephesians. 5. 7.
company (that thou be not defiled with others wantonness and uncleanness) of
thy Genesis 19. 33.
diet (that it be not immoderate) of thine Ezekiel. 23. 6, 15, 40.
apparel (that it be not garish and lascivious) of thy Genesis 39. 9. Pro. 2. 16.
time (that it be not vainly and idly spent) to omit, I say, these and other
like remedies.) One of the best remedies that can be prescribed to married
persons (next to an Genesis 39. 9. Pro. 2. 16.
awful fear of God, and a continual setting of him before them, wheresoever
they are) is, that husband and wife mutually delight each in other, and
maintain a pure and fervent love betwixt themselves, yielding that 1 Cor. 7.
2, 3, 5, 9.
due benevolence one to another which is warranted and sanctified by Gods word,
and ordained of God for this particular end. This due benevolence (as the
Apostle styles it) is one of the most proper and essential acts of marriage:
and necessary for the maine and principal ends thereof: as for preservation of
chastity in such as have not the gift of continency, for increasing the world
with a legitimate brood, and for linking the affections of the married couple
more firmly together. These ends of marriage, at least the two former, are made
void without this duty be performed.

As it is called (...).
benevolence because it must be performed with good will and delight,
willingly, readily and cheerfully; so it is said to be (...).
due because it is a debt which the wife owes to her husband, and he to her. 1
Cor. 7. 4.
For the wife has not the power of her own body, but the husband; and
likewise also the husband has not the power of his own body, but the wife.

I have my warrant from the Apostle to prescribe this duty as a remedy
against adultery. For 1 Cor. 7. 2, 3.
to avoid fornication, he advises man and wife to render due benevolence one
to another. If then this question be moved (How will marriage keep men and women
from adultery?) this answer out of the Apostles words may be given (by
rendering due benevolence:) which he further inculcateth by declaring the
mischief that may follow upon the neglect of this duty, namely Verse. 5.
a casting of themselves into the snares of Satan. Well might he press this
duty to that end, because no other means is of like force: nor fasting, nor
watching, nor hard lodging, nor long travel, nor much labor, nor cold, nor
solitariness, nor any thing else. Dum solitudinis me deserta vallarent,
ardorem naturae far non poteram: quem cum crebris ieiunijs frangerem, men's
cogitationibus aestuabat. Hier. ad Rust. Mon. Lege eundem ad Eustoc. de custod.
virgin.
Some that have by these means endeavored much to beat down their bodies, and
subdue lust (but neglected the forenamed remedy) have notwithstanding felt
lust boiling in them.

There are two extremes contrary to this duty. One in the defect: another in
the excess.

Defect therein is, when in case of need it is not required, or being required
by the one, it is not yielded by the other. Modesty is pretended by some for
not requiring it: but in a duty so warrantable and needful, pretense of
modesty is (to speak the least) a sign of great infirmity, and a cause of
much iniquity. To deny this duty being justly required, is to deny a due
debt, and to give Satan great advantage. The punishment inflicted on Onan,
(Genesis 38. 9, 10.) shows how great a wrong this is. From that punishment
Hebraei inquiunt perinde vt homicidam reum esse qui temere semen profundit.
Merc. in Genesis 38. 9.
the Hebrews gather that this sin is a kind of murder. It is so much the
more heinous when hatred, stoutnesse, niceness, fear of having too many
children, or any other like respects, are the cause thereof.

Excess is either in the measure, or in the time. In the measure, when husband
or wife is insatiable; provoking, rather then asswaging lust, and weakening
their natural vigor more then suppressing their unnatural humor. Many
husbands and wives are much oppressed by their bedfellowes insatiableness in
this kind.

In the time, when it is against Piety, Mercy, or Modesty.

1. Against Piety, when no day, nor duty of Religion, no not extraordinary
days, and duties of humiliation, will make them forbear. Io^l 2. 6.
The Prophets bidding the bridegroom and ^ride go out of their chamber in the
day of a Fast, and 1 Cor. 7. 5.
the Apostles excepting of Prayer and fasting, where he enioineth this duty of
due benevolence, show that in the time of a Fast it must ^e forborne.

2. Against Mercy, when one of the married couple being weak by sickness,
pain, labor, travel, or any other like ^eanes, and through that weakness
not well able to perform his duty, the other notwithstanding will have it
performed. ^ will have mercy, and not sacrifice, says the Lord. Shall Gods
sacrifice give place to mercy, and shall not man's or woman's (...)? for so I may
well term this unseasonable desire.

Quest. What if an husband or wife continue so long sick, ^^ otherwise weak,
as the other cannot contain?
Answ. In such cases of necessity the body must be beaten ^wne, and earnest
prayer made for the gift of continency: for ^redly the Lord who has brought
thee to that necessity, all give thee grace sufficient.

3. Against Modesty, Quo tempore si vir coierit cu^ muliere, dicuntur concepti
foetus vitium seminis tral ere: ita vt leprosi and elephantiaci ex hac
conceptione nascantur. Hier. in Lam. 1.
when husbands require this duty in that me, which under the Law was called the
time of a wives separation for her disease (Leu. 15. 19. etc.) For what can be
expected ^m such polluted copulation, but a leprous and loathsome generation?
This kind of intemperancie is expressly forbidden (Leuit. 18. 19.) and a
capital punishment inflicted on such as offended therein (Leuit. 20. 18.)
Abstinence in this time is set in the catalogue of those notes which declare a
man to be righteous (Eccles. 20. 7.) and the contrary intemperancy is put in
the roll of such abominations as provoked God to spue out the Canaanits (Leuit.
18. 28.) and to forsake his own inheritance (Ezekiel. 22. 10.)

To this kind of intemperancie Aug. de bon. coniug. ca. 6. Amb. in 1 Cor. 7.
some refer a man's knowing of his wife after she has conceived with child.
But I find no such matter condemned in Gods word: neither dare I make that a
sin which is not there condemned. Nemo Essenorum cu^ praegnante concumbit.
Joseph. de bell. Iud. li. 2. c. 7.
Certain Sectaries among the Jews are branded for this error.

1. Object. No other creature will so do: so as it may seem to be against
nature.
Answ. 1. I deny the argument: though some forbear, yet all do not.

2. I deny the consequence: for other creatures are not so tied one male to
one female, as an husband to his own wife. Quod in bestijs ipso naturae iure
praescriptu^ est, vt praegnantes ad partum vsque non coeant, hoc in hominibus
sciant arbitrio relictum. Hier. in Ephesians. 5. Sanchez de Matr. lib. 9. disp. 21,
22. agit de petendo and reddendo debito quando menstruum est: and tempore
praegnationis, and du^ infans lactatur.
Besides, that which beasts by nature are tied unto, must be left to man's
discretion.

2. Object. After a woman has once conceived, no more conceptions can be
expected, till she be delivered.
Answ. Conception is not the only end of this duty: for it is to be rendered to
such as are barren.

Quest. What if the wife give suck to her child, ought not her husband then
to forbear?
Answ. Because giving suck is a mother duty, man ought to do what he can to
contain.

. 10. Of mutual love betwixt man and wife.
Hitherto of those common mutual duties which tend to the preservation of the
very being of marriage, and are in that respect absolutely necessary. The other
common mutual duties (though they be not of so absolute necessity as the
former) are in their kind necessary for the good estate of marriage, and for
the better preserving of that knot: so as, if they be not performed, the end
and right use of marriage will be perverted, and that estate made uncomfortable,
and very burdensome. The first of these is Love. A loving mutual affection
must pass betwixt husband and wife, or else no duty will be well performed:
this is the ground of all the rest. In some respects Love is proper and
peculiar to an husband, as Treat. 4.. 2.
I purpose to show when I come to speak of an husbands particular duties. But
Love is also required of wives, and they are commanded to be lovers of their
husbands, as well as husbands to love their wives: (...). Tit. 2. 4. Col. 3. 19.
so as it is a common mutual duty belonging to husband and wife too: and that
is true wedlock, when man and wife are linked together by the bond of love.
Under love all other duties Hoc verum est coniugium, quando vinculo charitatis
sunt concatenati. Chrysostom. hom. 45. in Genesis
are comprised: for without it no duty can be well performed. Romans 13. 10.
Love is the fulfilling of the Law, that is, the very life of all those duties
which the law requires. It is the Col. 3. 14.
bond of perfection, which binds together all those duties that pass betwixt
party and party. Where love abounds, there all duties will readily and
cheerfully be performed. Where love is wanting, there every duty will either
be altogether neglected, or so carelessly performed, that as good not be
performed at all: in which respect the Apostle wills, that all things be done
1 Cor. 16. 14.
in love. Love as it provoke the party in whom it rules to do all the good
it can; so it stirs up the party loved to repay good for good. It is like
fire, which is not only hot in it self, but also conueigheth heat into that
which is near it: whence arises a reflection of heat from one to another.
Note how admirably this is set forth betwixt Christ and his Spouse in the Song
of Solomon: and it is further manifested in the examples of all good husbands
and wives noted in the Scripture: they did mutually bear a very loving
affection one to another.

Though love be a general duty which every one owes to another, Matthew. 5. 44.
even to his enemy, yet the nearer that God has linked any together, the more
are they bound to this duty, and the more must they abound therein. But of all
others are Treat. 1.. 79, 80.
man and wife most nearly and firmly linked together. Of all others therefore
are they most bound hereunto, and that in the highest degree that may be, even
like to Ionathans love, who loved David 1 Samuel 18. 1. Prou. 18. 22.
as his own soul. Solomon says, He that finds a wife finds a good thing,
and obtains favor of the Lord: which by the rule of relation is also true of
an husband, She that finds an husband finds a good thing, and obtains
favor of the Lord. Man and wife therefore are each to other an especial
pledge of Gods favor, and in this respect above all others under God to be
loved. If this be the ground (as it ought to be) of their mutual That which in
Treat. 4.. 2. 9. 11. is spoken of an husbands love and entire affection, may
also be applied in some respects to a wife: and so serve to amplify this
common mutual duty of love.
love, their love will be fervent and constant. Neither will the want, or
withering of any outward allurements, as beauty, personage, parentage,
friends, riches, honors, or the like, withold or withdraw, extinguish or
extenuate their love: neither will any excellencies of nature or grace in other
husbands and wives draw their hearts from their own to those other: nor yet
will the love of a former yoake-fellow dead and gone, any whit lessen the love
of the living mate.

This instance I have the rather mentioned, because in many, Love of after
venters to be as entire as of former.
who are far from setting their affection on strange flesh, their love of a
former husband or wife departed is so fast fixed in their heart, as they can
never again so entirely love any other. They who are so minded are not fit to
be joined with another yoke fellow after they are loosed from one. If they mary
again, and manifest such a mind, they plainly show that they respect this or
that person more then Gods ordinance. By Gods ordinance man and wife are no
longer bound one to another then they live together. Death is an absolute
diremption, and makes an utter dissolution of the marriage bond. If the man
Romans 7. 2, 3.
be dead, the wife is delivered from the law of the man, so as she may take
another man. Which liberty is also given to the man. Being now free, if they
mary another (that other being now a true husband or wife) their love must be
as entire to that other as it was to the former: yea, and more entire, if there
were any defect in the former. For as children married out of their parents
house must not retain such a love of their parents as shall swallow up their
love of the party to whom they are married, but must according to the law,
leave father and mother, and cleave to their yoke fellow: so neither must the
love of a former husband or wife be predominant when they are married to
another. This other must be as close cleaued unto, as if they had never been
joined to a former. The living husband or wife is the present pledge of Gods
favor. He is now thine own husband: and she is now thine own wife: and not
the party that is dead. I deny not but the memory of a virtuous husband or
wife ought to be precious to the suruiuing party: for the memorial of the
just is blessed. Prou. 10. 7.
But as the virtue of a person deceased may not be buried with the dead corpse:
so neither may the person be kept above ground with the memory of his or her
virtue: which after a sort is done, when love of the party deceased either
takes away, or extenuateth the love of the living. This is to give dominion to
the dead over the living: which is more then the law enioyneth.

. 11. Of husbands and wives mutual hatred contrary to love.
There is a generation of so crabbed and crooked a disposition * See Treat. 3.
8. and Treat. 4.. 10.
as they cannot love, but rather hate one another because they are man and
wife: for many husbands having wives, and wives husbands every way worthy to be
loved, will notwithstanding say to the astonishment of the hearers, I have
indeed a good husband, or I have a good wife: but I cannot love him, or I
cannot love her: and being demanded a reason, stick not openly and impudently
to reply, I think I could love him if he were not mine husband, or I think I
could love her if she were not my wife. O more then monstrous impudency! Is
not this directly to oppose against Gods ordinance, and against that order
which he has set betwixt man and woman? Is it not to trample under foot Gods
favor? Though there were nothing else to move love but this, that such an one
is thine husband, or such an one is thy wife, yet this should be motive enough.
And shall this be the ground of thine hatred? Assuredly such a spirit is a
plain diabolical spirit, contrary to that spirit which is from above; and if
it be not cast out, it will cast those whom it possesses into the fire of hell.

. 12. Of mutual peace betwixt Man and Wife.
Among other means of maintaining an inward loving affection betwixt man and
wife, outward mutual peace, concord, and agreement is one of the principal.
Whereupon the Apostle exhorts to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond
of Ephesians. 4. 3.
peace: for peace is a bond that tieth one to another, and makes them to be as
one, even one in spirit: as on the contrary side outward discord disunites men's
spirits. We are enioined to follow peace with all men: how much more of all
persons ought Heb. 12. 14.
husbands to have peace with their wives, and wives with their husbands? they
are nearer then brothers and sisters. Behold then how good and pleasant a thing
it is for them to dwell together in unity.. 14. Prou. 21. 9.
Dwell together they must: but without peace there is no dwelling together: It
is better to dwell in a corner of the house top then with a contentious woman
in a wide house. Persons at variance were far better be out of sight and
place, then present together. Out of sight and place man and wife must not be,
at peace therefore Portus est mulier, and maximu^ securitatis remedium. Si
ventis and fluctibus portum liberaueris ex foro reuersus tranquille viues.
Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
they must be. Mutual peace betwixt them is a great refreshing to their
minds, being beaten with the discords of others. It is said that a wife is in
this respect as an haven to man (how much more man to his wife?) If the haven
be calm, and free from storms and tempests, what a refreshing will it be to
the Mariner that has been tossed in the sea with winds and waves?

For maintaining peace,

1. All offenses so much as possibly may be must be avoided. Directions for
maintaining peace betwixt Man and Wife.
The husband must be watchful over himself that he give no offense to his
wife: and so the wife on the other side. Offenses cause contentions.

2. When an offense is given by the one party, it must 1. Avoid offense.

greater speed therefore must they both labor to put it out. Wrath must not lie

bed-fellowes: neither may they part beds for wrath sake. That this fire may be
the sooner quenched, they must both strive first to offer reconciliation.
Theirs is the glory who do first begin, for they are most properly the blessed
peacemakers. Not Mat. 5. 9.
to accept peace when it is offered is more then heathenish: but when wrath is
incensed, to seek atonement is the duty of a Christian, and a grace that
comes from above.

4. Children, servants, nor any other in the family must be 4. Take no part

bolstred up by the one against the other. The man's partaking with any of the
house against his wife, or the wives against her husband, is an usual cause of
contention betwixt man and wife.

5. They must forbear to twit one another in the teeth 5. Make not comparisons.
with the husbands or wives of other persons: or with their own former
husbands or wives (in case they have had any before.) Comparisons in this kind
are very odious. They stir up much passion, and cause great contentions.

6. Above all they must take heed of rash and unjust jealousy, 6. Be not
jealous.
which is the bane of marriage, and greatest cause of discontent that can be
given betwixt man and wife. Jealous persons are ready to pick quarrels, and to
seek occasions of discord: they will take every word, look, action, and
motion, in the worse part, and so take offense where none is given. When
jealousy is once kindled, it is as a flaming fire that can hardly be put out.
It makes the party whom it possesses implacable. Pro. 6. 34, 35.


7. In all things that may stand with a good conscience they must endeavor to
please one another: and either of 7. Please one another.
them suffer their own will to be crossed, rather then discontent to be given
to the other. Saint Paul notes this as a common 1 Cor. 7. 33, 34.
mutual duty belonging to them both, and expresses their care thereof under
a word that signifies more then ordinary (...).
care, and implies a dividing of the mind into diverse thoughts, casting this
way, and that way, and every way how to give best content.

. 13. Of contentions betwixt man and wife.
Contrary to mutual peace are contentions betwixt man and wife: which are too
frequent in most families, and by which Cum vir and vxor domi dissentiunt,
nihilo melius naui iactata domus illa disponitur, cum gubernator aduersus
prorae directo. rem dissentiat. Chrysostom. loc. citat. Genesis 13. 8.
the common good is much hindered. Discord betwixt man and wife in an house is
as contention betwixt the master and pilot in a ship: may not great danger, and
much mischief be thence justly feared? We heard before that man to his wife,
and she to him, is as an haven. Now by experience we find that if the haven be
tempestuous it is much more troublesome, and dangerous to the Mariner then the
wide sea. Wherefore let man and wife be of the same mind one to another as
Abraham was to Lot, and when occasions of discord are offered, say, Let there
be no strife betwixt thee and me, for we are man and wife: no more two, but one
flesh.

. 14. Of husbands and wives dwelling together.
From a mutual affection of love proceeds a mutual provident care in
husband and wife one for another. In handling whereof we will first note the
means whereby their mutual providence may be the better effected and
manifested, and then the matter whereabout it must be conversant. The means in
one word is cohabitation. For a duty it is that man and wife dwell together.
The phrase used in setting out the woman's creation (he built a woman, whereby
the erecting of (...) Vide Musc. in Genesis 2. 22. See Treat. 1.. 79.
a family is intimated) implies as much: so does the law of marriage whereby
man is enjoined to leave father and mother, and to cleave unto his wife, that
is, to go out of his fathers house, and to dwell with his wife: and so does
this phrase (forget Psalm. 45. 10.
thy fathers house) taken from the duty of a wife, and mystically applied to
the Church. Saint Peter expressly charge husbands 1 Pet. 3 7.
to dwell with their wives: and Saint Paul lays it to 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13.
the charge both of husbands and wives not to leave one another, but to dwell
together, yea though the one be an infidel. Surely it was conscience of this
duty which made the Judge. 19. 3.
Leuite to go after his wife, that went away from him, to bring her home
again: and which made Genesis 31. 14.
Iaakobs wives to leave their fathers house, and go with their husband. (...)
coniux. (...) vxor.
The word under which Saint Peter compriseth this duty is a title appropriated
to an husband: and an answerable title is appropriated to a wife: from which
the notation of our two usual English words (husband, housewife) does not much
differ.

The power which the one has of the others body, and Reasons for cohabitation.
the advantage which by living asunder, they give unto Satan, (both of which
are expressly noted, 1 Cor. 7. 4, 5.) do show the necessity of this duty: and
the many benefits arising from thence do further press the equity of it. By
husbands and Benefits of cohabitation.
wives dwelling together all marriage duties are better performed: mutual love
is better bred, preserved, and increased: the good gifts of either of them are
better observed by the other: better help and succor is mutually by each
afforded to the other: and in fine they are made more capable of doing good one
to another, and of receiving good one from another. Why then should they have
any mind of living asunder, unless they be forced by extraordinary occasions,
as captivity, close imprisonment, contagious sickness, and such like, which
are no faults of theirs, but crosses to be borne with grief; and instant
prayer, together with all other good means, to be used to bring them together
again? Yea if the imprisonment, banishment, or other like kind of absence, D.
Fulke against Rhem. on 1 Cor. 7.. 6.
be such as one may if they will come at the other, the party that is free
ought to come to the other, if at least that other require it.

. 15. Of the respects for which man and wife may for a time live asunder.
Quest. May there be any just causes for man and wife willingly to live asunder?
Answ. There can nor ought to be any cause of utter relinquishing one another,
which is a kind of. 3.
desertion: but for living asunder for a time there may be just causes, as

1. Weighty and urgent affairs which concern the good of the Church, or
commonwealth: as when a man is sent forth to war, or on an embassage (in
which case though he may take his wife with him, yet is he not necessarily
bound there to, especially if the place whither he is sent be far off, the
passage thereto difficult and dangerous, and his abode there not long.) When
Numb. 32. 26, 27.
Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manassch passed over Jorden to help their
brethren in their battles against the Canaanites, they left their wives behind
them in their families: 2 Samuel 11. 3, 6.
when Vriah went to war, he left his wife at home: and Exo. 18. 2.
when Moses was to bring Israel out of Egypt, his wife remained at her fathers
house.

2. Maine duties of their particular calling: as of Mariners, who are often to be
on the sea: Merchants who trade in other countries: Lawyers who attend public
places of justice: Courtiers, who in their months, or quarters, attend their
Prince: Keepers of women in childbed, and sick persons: and other nurses.

Provided always that in these, and other like cases, there be Absence, 1. not
without consent. 1 Cor. 7. 5.
a joint and mutual consent of both parties: for if man and wife may not
defraud one another for a time to give themselves to fasting and prayer without
consent: much less may they for lighter occasions live any time asunder
without 2. Not with delight. Si vir ad peregrina contenderit, nulla longin.
quitas, nulla absentia complacitam minuat charitatem. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7.
consent. Provided also that they take no delight to live asunder, but rather
be grieved that they are forced so to do: and in testimony thereof to take all
occasions that they can to manifest their longing desire one after another by
letters, messages, tokens, and other like kindnesses: and to return with all
the speed they can. No distance, or absence ought any whit to diminish their
mutual love.

. 16. Of the error of Papists about man and wifes separation. Si quis dixerit
Ecclesiam errore cum ob multas causas separationem inter coniuges quoad thorum,
sen cohabitationem, ad certum, incertumue tempus fieri posse decernit, Anathema
sit. Council. Trid.. 24. can. 8.

Contrary to the duty of cohabitation is the doctrine of Papists, whereby
they teach, that

Separation may be made betwixt man and wife for many causes from bed, or
cohabitation, for a certain or uncertain time. The Council of Trent is bold
to denounce Anathema against such as say, the Church erreth therein. If the
many causes which they allege, besides adultery, be well weighed, we shall
find them without all warrant of Gods word. Bellarm. de Matrim. l. 1. c. 14.
They draw them to two heads, 1. Mutual consent. 2. Demerit.

By consent (say they) of both parties married to attain a greater and
perfecter estate, marriage consummate may be loosed from bed and cohabitation.

Answ. 1. In marriage there is a covenant of God (Prou. 2. 17.) as well as of
the two parties: the consent therefore of parties is not sufficient to break
it.

2. No estate in this world can be greater or perfecter then is meet for married
persons. Adam and Eve in their best estate were married: and now is marriage
honorable in all. Heb. 13. 4.


3. The estates which they count more perfect, are either such as are not in
man's power (as perpetual continency) or such as may be as well performed by
married persons as by single persons (as Ecclesiastical functions) if at least
they be such as are warranted by Gods word. High Priests, and other Priests,
all sorts of Levites, extraordinary Prophets and Apostles were married. What
greater functions then these?

The causes which for demerit, they say, make a separation, ^re 1. Adultery.
2. Departing from the Catholic faith. 3. Soli^iting or impelling unto sin.

Concerning See. 5.
Adultery, we deny not, but that it gives ^ust cause of divorce: but withal
we say (as Matthew. 5. 32.
we have good warrant from Christ's words) that it is the only cause of just
di^orce. For to make a separation for departing from the Catholic faith, Fidei
gratia vxorem ne eijcias. Chrysostom. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7.
is directly contrary to S. Paul's and S. Peter's doctrine, 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13,
14. 1 Pet. 3. 1.

As for soliciting and impelling unto sin, though it may be cause to move an
husband or a wife to walk more warily and Si ferus moribus fit coniux,
perferat illum vxor, nec vllam ob causam societatem, vinculumque dissoluere
patiatur. Basil. Hexaem. bom. 7. Matthew. 5. 29.
wisely, and in extremity to avoid society for a time, or to com^laine to the
Magistrate for relief, who may see it meet to lay ^he delinquent person in
prison, or else otherwise keep them sunder till that delinquent be reclaimed
and brought to a better mind: yet is it no sufficient cause finally to
dissolve ma^age in regard of bed and cohabitation.

They urge that if the right eye cause to offend, it must be pluc^d out.

Ans. 1. That is but a metaphor, and may sundry other ways (...) applied.

2. The words are not simply, but by way of comparison to ^e taken, rather
pluck it out, then to be made to stumble thereby.

3. Plucking out, applied to the point in hand, may be by ^any other ways,
then by dissoluing marriage.

4. That general inhibition (whosoever shall put away his wife, Matthew. 5. 32.
causes her to commit adultery) restrained only with the exception of
fornication, admits neither this, nor any other such cause of dissoluing
marriage.

. 17. Of husbands and wives unlawful absenting themselves one from another.
Contrary also to the forenamed duty of cohabitation, is the practice of many
men, who living themselves in one place (suppose at London) send their wives
unto some country house, and there even mew them up, as Hawks, never caring
to come at them, but are then most merry, when their wives are farthest off.
If their wives live at home they will be abroad, mealing and lodging where
their wives shall not know: their own house is as a prison to them: they are
not well, but when they are out of it. Of the like lewd conceit and practife
are many wives, who on no other occasion then mere lightness, being eager in
pursuing their pleasures, and satisfying their lusts, gad out of their own
houses in the day, lie out of them in the night, and remain in other company
days and nights: or at least are glad when their husbands have occasion to be
from home; not unlike to the light huswife which Solomon describes, Prou. 7.
10. etc. I speak of matters too famous, or rather infamous. I would there were
no just cause to tax this lightness. But let such as desire to approve
themselves to God or man, take heed of these heinous and more then heathenish
vices. Though Israel play the harlot, yet let not Judah Hos. 4. 15.
offend.

Too near to the forenamed kind of unlawful separation Man and wifes fault
in parting rooms and beds in the same house.
do they come, who though they live both in one house, yet make that house by
their estranging themselves one from another as two houses: the man abiding in
one end thereof, his wife in another: and so have their several rooms,
several tables, several servants, all several: Or if the straitness of
their house will not suffer them so to part other rooms, yet they will have
several bed-chambers, or at least several beds: so as they that shall call
them bed-fellowes, shall but nicke-name them. Thus they rob each other of that
due benevolence which they mutually owe one to another, they expose themselves
to the devils snares, they more and more estrange their hearts one from
another, and deprive themselves of such mutual comforts and helps, as by
matrimonial society they might afford to, and receive from one another.

. 18. Of husbands and wives mutual prayers.
The matter whereabout husbands and wives mutual providence ought to be
conversant, is in general the good of one another; that each of them do that
for the other, which Solomon in particular applies to a wife, viz. good and
not evil all Prou. 31. 12.
the days of their life. Now the good of man extends to his soul, body,
good name, and goods.

A general duty tending to the good of all these is prayer. Prayer a mutual
duty. 1 Pet 3. 7.
S. Peter requires such a carriage of man and wife one toward another, as
their prayers be not hindered: whereby he takes it for grant, that prayer is a
mutual duty which one owes to the other: which duty Isaak performed for his
wife. Herein may Genesis 25. 21.
man and wife be helpful each to other in all things needful to either of
them: for it is the means which God in wisdom Matthew. 7. 7. I am. 5. 16.
has sanctified for the obtaining of every needful blessing for ourselves or
others. By many it is counted but a slight duty and of small use; but the
truth is, that to perform it aright, in truth and faith, is both difficult in
the deed, and powerful in the effect. It is the best duty that one can
perform for another, and the least to be neglected. We heard before, that
Isaak prayed for his wife: and to show the good he did to her thereby, it is
noted, that the Lord was entreated of him: so as she, being Genesis 25. 21.
barren before, by that means conceived. All the physic in the world could
not have done her so much good. (...). Luke 18. 1.
Always therefore, (...). 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17.
without ceasing is this duty to be performed. Whenever man and wife make
any prayer, therein they must be mindful of one another: yea and often must they
of purpose take occasion to make prayers in special one for another: and that
both in absence, and also in presence of one another.

This latter does especially concern the husband, who is as a Priest unto his
wife, and ought to be her mouth to God when they two are together: yet I doubt
not, but that the wife may pray in the husbands presence when they two are
alone, ^ither for trial (that he may have knowledge of her ability and gift
in that kind) or for help (if the wife be much better able to perform that
duty then the man is, as many wives are.) Not without cause therefore have I
reckoned this among common mutual duties.

. 19. Of the things for which husbands and wives are to pray alone.
There are sundry needful blessings which husbands and wives are to pray for
that appertain only to themselves, and are most meet to be mentioned in
private prayer betwixt themselves, as

1. That as they two are one flesh, so they may be also one spirit: that their
hearts may be as one, knit together by a true, spiritual, matrimonial love:
always delighting one in another, ever helpful one to another, and ready
with all willingness and cheerfulness to perform all those duties which
they owe one to another.

2. That their marriage bed may be sanctified: and as it is by Gods ordinance,
so it may remain to them by their well using it, a bed undefiled. There is no
other thing, for which mutual prayer in private betwixt man and wife is more
needful: and that so much the rather, because of the natural heat of lust
which is in most: which if it be not by prayer (the best means for that
purpose) assuaged, it may prove a defilement Intemperans in coniugio quid aliud
nisi quidam adulter vxoris est? Aug. ex Ambr. contr. Julian. lib. 2.
of the undefiled bed: and man and wife become adulterers one to another. As
other things, so this also is sanctified by the word and prayer. The word
gives a warrant and direction for the use of it: prayer both seasoneth it, and
procures a blessing upon it.

3. That they may have children, and those such as may be heirs of salvation,
and live in this world to their own and others good: that they may be comely
and well proportioned children: nor idiots in understanding, nor monsters in
bodily shape, nor yet lewd and infamous in their lives: which could not but be
a grief to their parents, and might also open the mouths of the wicked
against them.

4. That God would give them competencie of this worlds goods, and other good
means well to nourish, nurture, and place forth their children: and a
sufficiency for the maintenance of their family, and of that estate wherein
God sets them.

5. That such needful gifts and graces as are wanting in either of them may be
wrought: and such vices and infirmities as they are subject unto may be
redressed.

These and many other like things give occasion to man and wife in special
manner to pray one for another, and one with another.

. 20. Of husbands and wives hateful imprecations and wishes one against
another.
Contrary to that holy and heavenly duty of prayer are those direful and
hellish imprecations and execrations, which ordinarily do pass out of the
mouths of many husbands and wives against one another (and that many times for
very light occasions) cursing the day that ever they knew one another, and
wishing that one of them had been under the ground before they came together.
Most odious are these and such like execrations in any man's mouth, but more
then most odious in the mouth of man and wife against one another.

Many who for outward shame for bear to belch forth such ^rotten stinking
speech, make small conscience of wishing the like in their hearts. If an
husband be any whit harsh, and a wife shrewish: or if through sickness, or any
other like occasion they seem burdensome each to other: or if any dislike of
one arise in the heart of the other: or if their hearts be set upon others: or
if the suruiuor be to carry away the goods and ^ands, their hearts will be
filled with a thousand wishes of one another death. Yea, many times such as
have very good husbands or wives, without any show of reason (only through an
inward corrupton of their heart, and malicious instigation of Satan, not taking
notice of their own good) are ready to wish they were in heaven: making
thereby a pretense of their eternal bliss to whom they so wish, whereas
indeed their only desire is to be loosed and freed from them. God often meets
with such wicked wishers (whereby he shows how hateful such wishes are to
him) for sometimes according to their wish he takes away good husbands and
wives from those that are evil: and when they are gone he makes their loss
to be so sensibly felt, as those ungodly wishers do, (as we speak) in every
vein of their heart repent them of their rash wishes. Yea, to aggrauate their
wretchedness the more, he gives them such crabbed and perverse husbands and
wives in the room and stead of those good ones (for seldom comes a better) as
they are forced with many deep sighs and groans to wish (but all in vain)
their former wives and husbands Quam chara sint carendo intelligunt. Cic. in
Orator.
alive again, and so to verify the proverb, A good thing is not so well
discerned by enjoying, as by wanting it. Sometimes again God in anger crosses
their wishes, and first takes away the wishers of others death: or else
prolongeth the life of both to Amicitiae quid haberent voluptatis carendo magis

their greater vexation.

. 21. Of husbands and wives neglect of mutual prayer.
The very neglect of mutual prayer in husbands and wives for each other is
also a sin contrary to the forenamed duty of prayer: whereof if all that are
guilty were as well known to man as to God, how many unkind husbands and
wives careless of one another good would be noted, more then are? Rare are
those husbands and wives, that have their seasons to pray alone together one
with another, if ever they pray one for another. Though in outward complements
they may seem very kind, and in the outward things of this world, very
provident, yet if they pray not one for another, they are neither kind, nor
provident. Hearty, fervent, frequent prayer is the greatest token of
kindness, and best part of providence that can be.

. 22. Of husbands and wives mutual care for one another salvation.
From the general duty of prayer which is profitable to all things, I come to
the particular branches of man and wives Admonendi sunt coniuges vt exhortantes
inuicem saluent. Greg. in Past. part. 3. Adm. 28.
mutual provident care: and will first begin with that which is first to be
sought, the good of one another soul: which the Apostle intimates to be a
thing to be sought after, where he says, 1 Cor. 7. 16.
What know thou, o wife, whether thou shall SAVE thine husband, or what
know thou, o man, whether thou shall SAVE thy wife? 1 Pet. 3. 1.
S. Peter enioyneth wives to do their endeavor to win their husbands: and Epb.
5. 25.
S. Paul sets before husbands the pattern of Christ's love, which had
especial respect Of the particular duty of husbands in this respect, See
Treat. 4.. 47.
to the soul and the salvation thereof: so as this is a mutual duty
appertaining to them both, which S. Peter further implies where he styles
them coheires of the grace of life.

It is the greatest good that one can possibly do for another, to be a means
of helping forward his salvation. And there is 1 Pet. 3. 7. (...).
nothing that can more soundly and firmly knit the heart of one to another,
then to be a means thereof.

. 23. Of husbands and wives care to win one the other, when one of them is not
called.
That the salvation of the soul may be the better effected, respect must be
had to the present and particular estate of husband or wife. If one be a
believer the other not, the believer must use all the means that may be, to
draw on the other also to believe. If both be believers, their mutual care
must be to ^edifie one another in their most holy faith.

For the first, it is the maine drift of S. Peter's exhortation to 1 Pet. 3. 1.
believing wives, about their conversation, to draw on their unbelieving
husbands to the true faith. His phrase (that they (...).
may be won or gained) as in general it has respect to their souls
salvation, so in particular to their first conversion. Now if this duty
appertain to a wife, much more to an husband, who is appointed an head to his
wife, and a Saniour. To this end does S. Paul advise believing husbands and
wives that Ephesians. 5. 23. 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13
are married to unbelievers, to dwell with them.

For what a woeful thing is it, that two which in this world A woeful thing
that one flesh should be in heaven and hell. Luke 17. 34.
are so nearly linked together as to make one flesh, should in the world to
come be so far separated one from another, as heaven is from hell. This
indeed shall so fall out in many: for Christ has expressly foretold it, that of
two that were in one ^ed together (who are more fitly set forth under this
phrase then man and wife, who most usually are styled bedfellowes?) ^ne shall
be taken (to mercy and glory) the other shall be for saken or left to endless
and easelesse torture and torment.) But though it be foretold that thus it
shall fall out with many a ^ouple, yet our care must be, and that with our
uttermost power, Means of conversion the best cause of love.
to prevent it, as in our selves, so in our bedfellow.

If it please the Lord to give such a blessing to the endeavor of an husband or
wife, as to be a means of the conversion of their bedfellow, then will the
party converted both entirely love the other, and also heartily bless God (as
there is just cause) that ever they were so nearly linked together.

This duty of winning one another, is to be applied to such as are married not
only to plain infidels, but also to Papists or other like Idolaters, to
Atheists, or any other profane persons, to heretics, separatists,
schismatiques, or any that believe not aright.

. 24. Of husbands and wives edifying one another.
The second duty tending to the souls salvation is, that two believers being
married together, they endeavor mutually to build up one another more and more.
1 Thessalonians. 5. 11
One Christian owes this duty to another: much more man and wife. Heb. 12. 15.
Take heed (says the Apostle) that no man fall away from the grace of God. If
no man, then nor wife nor husband.

A spiritual edifying of one another is the best use which Spiritual
edification a main end of matrimonial conjunction.
we can make (and ought to make) of those Col. 2. 19.
joints and bonds whereby we are knit one to another. By virtue of them Ephesians. 4.
16.
the body (namely the mystical body of Christ) receives increase to the
edifying of it self, and Col. 2. 19.
increases with the increase of God. Now the bond of marriage being of all
other the firmest, and that whereby we are nearest knit together, by virtue of
what bond should we edify one another, if not by virtue of the marriage bond?

. 25. Of husbands and wives hindering sin one in another.
Two things are requisite unto spiritual edification.

One respects the hindrances of growth in grace.

The other the helps thereof.

The hindrances of grace are all manner of sins. Sin to grace is as water
to fire: it slaketh the heat of it, and if without hoe it be powered on it, it
will clean put it out. In regard hereof there ought to be a mutual care in
husbands and wives, both to prevent sin before it be committed, and also to
make what redress they can after it is committed.

That it is a mutual duty for husbands and wives so much Man and wife to
prevent sin in one another.
as they can, to prevent sin one in another is evident, by that reason which
the Apostle uses, to keep them from defrauding one another, in these words,
that Satan tempt you not. 1 Cor. 7. 5.
For out of the scope and matter of those words, this general doctrine may be
gathered, Husbands and wives ought to be careful to keep one another from the
temptations of Satan, that is, from sin, whereunto all his temptations tend.
Genesis 27. 6, etc.
Rebekah performed the duty of a good wife in keeping Isaak from blessing
Esau: which if he had done, he had sinned against Genesis 25. 23.
Gods express word. Though she failed in the manner of doing it, yet her end
was good.

As that love they owe one to another, so that care which they By preventing
sin in each other, they keep judgments from themselves.
ought to have of themselves requires as much, for sin provoke Gods wrath,
his wrath sends down vengeance, that vengeance which falls on the husband
can hardly miss the wife, or that the husband, which falls on the wife; and
that by reason of their near union: though it fall not on both their pates,
yet it cannot but much affect, and even afflict the party that escapes. The
wives of those rebels who were Number. 16. 27, 32
swallowed up quick in the wilderness, perished in like manner with their
husbands. For they who are so near as husbands and wives, and do not what
they can to prevent one another sins, make themselves accessory thereto.

For the better effecting of this duty, husbands and wives Direction for
preventing sin.
must be watchful over one another, and observe what sins either of them are
given unto, or what occasions are offered to draw either of them into sin. If
either of them be choleric or prone to be angry on a sudden, the other must
endeavor to take away all occasions of offense: and if both should be testie
and hasty to wrath, when the one sees the other first moved, the party whose
passion is not yet stirred, ought the rather to be settled and composed to all
meekness and patience, lest, if both together be provoked, the whole household
be set on fire. If either of them be given to drunkenness, covetousness, or
any other sin, the other ought by wise and gentle persuasions to keep them
(as much as they can) from those sins. Yea they may also get others, that are
discreet and able, to dissuade them: or use what other good means they can to
that purpose.

. 26. Of husbands and wives redressing sin in one another.
When either husband or wife is fallen into any sin, a mutual duty it is
for the other, to use what redress may be of that sin: as if one of them
were wounded, the other must take care for the healing of that wound. Abigail
performed 1 Samuel 25.
her duty in this kind, when, after she had heard what churlish entertainment
her husband gave to David's servants, she hastened to carry store of provision
to David, and humbled her self before him, and so moved David to assuage his
wrath: yea she took a seasonable time also to tell her husband his fault, and
the danger whereinto he brought himself thereby.

More directly, and with better success did Iaakob redress the superstition,
or rather Idolatry of his wife Rachel, as may

be gathered by comparing Genesis 31. 19, 34 Genesis 35. 2, 4.

A brother at large must not suffer sin to lie on his brother: Leu. 19. 17.
much less may husband or wife the one upon the other.

Thou shall not hate thy brother (says the law) and suffer It is a branch of
hatred to suffer sin to lie on any.
sin to lie on him. To do this then is a token and fruit of hatred. If an
husband should see his wife, or a wife her husband lying in the fire, or water,
ready to be burnt or drowned, and not afford their best help to pull them out,
might they not justly be thought to hate them? But sin is as fire and water,
which will burn and drown men in perdition.

This duty may be performed by meek instructions, pithy persuasions, gentle
reproves: yea, and by the help of some Mat. 18. 16.
good Minister, or other discreet and faithful friend.

. 27. Of husbands and wives helping forward the growth of grace in each other.
Hitherto of preventing, and redressing hindrances of grace. Hereunto must be
added an helping forward of the growth thereof: which man and wife must
mutually endeavor to effect one in another. The care which Elkanah had to carry
his 1 Samuel 1. 4. etc.
wives along with himself unto the Tabernacle of the Lord year by year,
shows that his desire was to uphold them in the fear of God: yea the gifts
and portions, which at that time he used to bestow on them, implie the care
that he had to encourage them to hold on in serving the Lord. It was without
question the maine end which the Shunamite aimed at in 2 King. 4. 10.
providing lodging for the Prophet, that both she and her husband might be
built up in Grace.

This duty may be the better effected by these means following. How growth in
grace may be helped forward.


1. By taking notice of the beginning, and least measure of Grace: and
approving the same.

2. By frequent conference about such things as concern the same: mutually
propounding questions one to another thereabouts, and answering the same.

3. By their mutual practice and example: making themselves each to other a
pattern of piety.

4. By performing exercises of religion, as praying, singing psalms, reading
the word, and the like together.

5. By maintaining holy and religious exercises in the family. Nemo magister
ita persuadere poterit quemadmodum vxor. Chrysostom. hom. 19. 1 Cor. 7.
Though this duty especially appertain to the husband, yet the wife must put
her husband in mind thereof, if he forget it; and stir him up, if he be
backward: Thus did the good Shunamite, 2 King. 4. 9, 10. No man's persuasion in
this kind, can so much prevail with a man as his wives.

6. By stirring up one another to go to the house of God, Maritum co adducito
vt sanctorum dierum rationem habeat. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp.
to hear the word, partake of the Sacrament, and conscionably perform all the
parts of Gods public worship.

Great need there is, that husbands and wives should endeavor to help forward
the growth of grace in each other, because we are all so prone to fall away and
wax cold, even as 1. Great need thereof.
water if the fire go out, and more fuel be not put under. 2. Husbands and
wives may be very helpful one to another therein.
And of all other, husbands and wives may be most helpful herein, because they
can soonest epsy the beginning of decay by reason of their near, and
continual familiarity together.

. 28. Of the sins of husbands and wives contrary to a mutual care of one
another salvation.
The vices contrary to that general mutual duty of husbands and wives in
procuring the Salvation of one another, and to the particular branches
comprised under it, are many: As

1. A careless neglect thereof: when as husbands and wives 1. Care only for
temporal things.
so mind earthly things, as they think it enough if they be provident one for
another in the things of this life. Hereof most that live in this earth are
guilty: and among others, even many of them who have the name of very good and
kind husbands and wives. But whatsoever the opinion of others be of them, the
truth is, that if they fail in this point, they go no further then the very
heathen have done, and their kindness may be as the apes kindness, which
causes death.

2. The unworthy walking, and unchristian carriage of a believer 2. Unworthy
walking.
that is married to one that believes not: hereby the unbeliever is kept off
from embracing the Gospel, and made the more to dislike and detest it. If a
popish or profane husband be married to a wife that makes profession of the
truth of the Gospel, and she be stout, proud, wanton, waspish, wastefull, or
given to any other like vices, will he not be ready thereupon to inueigh
against the religion she professes, and utterly protest against it? So also a
popish or profane wife, if she be married to such an husband.

3. Negligence in observing one another disposition or conversation: 3.
Negligence in preventing sin.
whereby it comes to pass that they keep not back, nor restrain one
another from running into any sin: but prove such husbands and wives one to
another as Eli proved a father to his sons: whence it fell out, that Gods
severe vengeance fell upon the neck of the one, and of the other. Pilats wife
though an heathenish woman, shall rise up in judgment against many such wives,
for she did what she could to keep Mat. 27. 19.
her husband from shedding innocent blood.

4. Acomplement all soothing of one another humor, and seeking 4.
Man-pleasing.
mutually to please one another in all things, without respect of good or
evil. Such as these the Scripture terms Ephesians. 6. 6. (...)
men-pleasers. Hence it comes to pass that husbands and wives are so far
from drawing one another from sin, that the better rather yields unto the
worse, and both run into Diabolus saepe sollicitus est subuertere viros per
os coniugum. Orig. in Job. lib. 2.
evil, as Adam was persuaded by his wife to transgress against Gods express
charge: and wise Solomon was drawn by his wives unto Idolatry, 1 King. 11. 4.
and Sapphira consented to the sacrilege of Ananias her husband, Act. 5. 2.

5. An undue fear of offending one another by Christian instruction, 5. Undue
fear of offense.
admonition, reproof, and the like. Many who are often moved in conscience to
make known to their husbands and wives the sins wherein they live, and the
danger wherein they lie by reason thereof, do notwithstanding through
careless and causeless fear, refrain and forbear to do so.

6. An impious, and envious disposition, whereby many husbands 6. Scoffing at
the signs of grace.
and wives are moved to mock, and scoff at that holy zeal, and forwardness
which they observe in their bedfellowes: as Michal who resembled David to a
fool, or 2 Samuel 6. 20.
vaine-fellow, because he manifested his zeal by dancing before the Arc. Thus
do many nip the work of the spirit in the very bud, and cause grace soon to
wither. But cursed be that husband, or wife, that thus peruerteth the maine end
of their near conjunction.

. 29. Of husbands and wives mutual care over one another body.
After the good of the soul follows the good of the body, wherein husband
and wife must show their provident care each over other: and do what lies in
them to procure the welfare of one another person, and to nourish and
cherish one another body. This duty the Apostle lays down under the
comparison of a body which he calls flesh, saying, Ephesians. 5. 29.
No man hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it: now man and
wife are Ephesians. 5. 31.
one flesh. This duty the Apostle in particular applies to husbands. At the
first institution of marriage it was in particular applied to the wife, whom God
made to be Genesis 2. 18.
an help meet for man: so as it is a mutual duty appertaining to both. It
seems that Genesis 27. 14.
Rebecha was so careful of Isaak in this respect, that she could readily make
sauory meat for him, such as he loved.

This duty extends it self to all estates both of prosperity and adversity,
of health and sickness: for so much do they mutually covenant and promise
when they are first joined together in marriage, I take thee (says each to
other) for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health
to love and to cherish. Wherefore they ought mutually both to rejoice in the
welfare of one another, and also in all distress to succor and comfort each
other, putting their shoulders under one another burden, and helping to ease
one another as much as they can. That which Solomon said of a friend and a
brother, may fitly be applied in this case to husband and wife, a friend loves
at all times, and a brother is borne for adversity, Pro. 17. 17.
that is, a trusty and faithful friend is constant in his goodwill, and ready
to perform all duties, of kindness at any time, whether it be prosperity or
adversity: the change of outward estate makes no alteration in his loving
affection and friendly carriage: yea he seems to be as it were borne and
brought forth against the time of trouble and affliction, because then is his
provident care and tender affection most manifested. Of all friends none ought
to be more careful, none more faithful one to another then man and wife. How
then ought they to love at all times, and if any trial come to either of them,
the other so to carry himself, as it may be truly said they were joined
together for adversity?

Thus shall they verify the truth of that whereby God was moved to creare of
mankind male, and female, namely that it was not good for man to be alone, but
that it was rather good, Genesis 2. 18.
that is, needful, profitable, and comfortable for man and woman to be
together. In which respect the wiseman says, he that finds a wife finds a
good thing; and by the rule of Pro. 18. 22.
relation we may infer, she that finds an husband finds a good thing.

. 30. Of husbands and wives backwandnesse to help one another in time of need.
Contrary to this duty is a certain unnatural affection in sundry husbands
and wives, who much grudge to provide the things that are needful for one
another. The man commonly thinks the charge too great, the woman thinks the
pains too much: they are affected one to another as if they were mere
strangers: nay many strangers will be more ready to perform, and more
cheerful in performing needful duties (as occasion is offered) then such
unnatural husbands and wives. If a little sickness, or other like cross fall
on one of them, the other thinks, never any had such a burden; and by their
discontent make the burden much more heavy then otherwise it would be: even as
when two oxen are in one yoke, and the one holds back, the draught is made
much harder to the other. Thus do they pervert one of the principal ends of
marriage, which is to be a continual comfort and Genesis 2. 18.
help each to other, and to ease the burdens of one another: in which respect
they are made yoke-fellowes. Jobs wife by her unnatural carriage toward him in
his affliction Job 2. 9.
did much aggrauate his misery: when he stood in most need of her help, she
afforded least unto him: it appears by Jobs complaint of her, in these words,
my breath is strange to Job 19. 17.
my wife, that she altogether neglected him in his misery. The common speech of
many after their husband or wife having long lien sick is departed, bewrays
their unnatural affection: their speech is this, if my husband (or wife) had
died so much sooner I had saved so much money. What does this intimate but that
they could have been contented their husband (or wife) should have died sooner
that they might have spared the more.

. 31. Of Husbands and Wives mutual respect of one another good name.
The provident care of husbands and wives ought further to extend it self to
the credit and good name of one another. As dear ought the good name of the
wife be unto the husband, and of the husband to the wife, as their own. Mat.
1. 19.
The great regard that Joseph had of the credit of Marie his espoused wife,
made him think of putting her away privily when ^e observed her to be with
child and knew not of whom: ^or he was not willing (...).
to make her a public example. The ^ame respect moved 2 Samuel 11. 5.
Bethsheba to send secretly to David, and ^ell him that she was with child.
The commendation which he good husband ( Pro. 31. 28. 1. A good name is
precious.
noted by Solomon) gives of his wife being approved by the holy Ghost, shows
how man and wife ^^aght in that respect to honor each other: and that on good
^ounds. For

1. A good name is a most precious thing: Eccl. 7. 3.
better then pre^ious ointment, which gives a sweet savor, and Pro. 22. 1.
to be chosen ^oue great riches. 2. The good name of the one is the honor of
the other.


2. So nearly are husbands and wives joined together, the good name of the one
cannot but tend to the honor and credit of the other; so that herein they
seek their own honor also.

. 32. Of husbands and wives preventing each others discredit.
For direction herein, consider we how this duty may be Directions concerning
a good name.
performed, and how it may be manifested.

For the better performing of it, care must be had both to prevent and redress
an ill name, and also to procure and preserve a goodname.

To prevent an ill name respect must be had of these three things following, 1.
Prevent an ill name, and that
1. What one relates of another, and how. 2. What ear they give to things
related by others. 3. What censure they give of one another.


For the first, husbands and wives may in no case delight to 1. By concealing
things of ill report.
discover unto others, and spread abroad the infirmities, and imperfections of
one another, or any thing that may tend to the discredit of either of them: but
rather cover and conceal them as much as they may with a good conscience. It
is expressed that Mat. 1. 19.
Joseph being a just man labored to conceal that blemish which he imagined to
be in his wife, so as this may stand with justice: yea also it is a part of
Jove, for 1 Pet. 4. 8.
love covers a multitude of sins.

For the second, husbands and wives must not have their 2. By closing ears
against ill reports.
ears wide opened to hear every tale and report that shall be brought to one
against the other, but rather show themselves displeased and offended with them
that are ready to relate things of evil report. If an husband or wife manifest
a willingness to hearken after tales and reports of one another, the devil
will stir up instruments enough to fill their heads with tales, and those for
the most part both frivolous and forged: not only strangers, but children,
servants, and they which are of the same family will ever be telling some tale
or other, to currie favor, as we speak. But an utter dislike of such
flattering tale-bearers, will take away occasion from them of telling untrue,
or slight reports.

For the third, the judgment and censure which husbands 3. By forbearing to
censure rashly.
and wives give one of another must either be very charitable, or very
sparing. If one hear reported any notorious crime of the other, they may not
be ouer-headie or hasty to judge and condemn, no though they think they see
some evidence thereof, but rather suspend their judgment. This seems to be
the mind of Joseph: though he observed Marie to be with Mat. 1. 19.
child, yet would he not presently judge her to be a notorious adulteress, or
condemn her for an hypocrite, unworthy to live, and therefore would not make
her a public example.

In brief, that husbands and wives may be the more sparing in censuring one
another, they must not rashly believe any evil report of one another, but
rather suppress all light suspicions as much as they can.

That the judgment which they give one of another, may be charitable, in
judging they must well observe the properties of love, which are 1. To
interpret doubtful things in the better part. 2. To mitigate, so far as
truth and justice will suffer, the faults which are evident. Michal offended
against 2 Samuel 6. 20.
the first in an high degree, and was cursed. Abigail observed 1 Samuel 25. 25.
the latter, and was blessed.

. 33. Of the wisdom of husbands and wives, in redressing one another ill name.
To redress an ill name, husbands and wives must first give one another notice
of the report that goes of them, and endeavor 2. Redress an ill name.
to work in them both a sight, and also a sense of those evils which are in
the mouths of others: after notice given, they must labor to bring them to
repentance of those sins, for which they are ill reported of, and to a
manifestation of repentance, by doing things meet for repentance, which is by a
zealous and conscionable practice of such vettues as are clean contrary to
the vices for which they were evil spoken of. It may with good probability be
gathered out of the history of the Leuite, whose wife played the whore, that
thus he Judge. 19. 1, 2, etc.
dealt with her. And thus Abigail endeavored to deal with her husband. 1 Samuel
25. 37.


. 34. Of husbands and wives care in procuring one another good name.
To procure a good report, husbands and wives must 3. Procure a good report.
First, take notice of the good qualities which are in one another, and as one
has occasion to speak of the other, to make those good qualities the subject
of their speech: as we l Pro. 31. 28, 29.
heard it before commended in the husband of that wife which is described by
Solomon.

Secondly, they must lend a willing and joyful ear to such as shall (so far
as they can conceive) truly and unfeignedly, without flattery or hypocrisy,
speak any thing in commendation of the one or of the other: not thinking
themselves dispraised (which is the conceit of many) when their bedfellow is
praised: but rather having their hearts the more enlarged to praise God, for
bestowing on them such an excellent token and pledge of his favor.

Thirdly, they must imitate those good things which they behold, or hear to be
in one another, and so imitate them as they which have before time known both
husband and wife, may say, this she learned of him, or this he learned of her.

. 35. Of husbands and wives wisdom, in preserving each others good name.
To preserve a good name, it will be meet for an husband or 4. Preserve a good
name.
wife, wisely and seasonably to give one another notice of that good fame which
is raised of them, thereby to provoke them both to give glory to God for the
same ( Col. 1. 3, 4.
as the Apostle thanketh God for that report which was spread abroad of the
faith and love of the Colossians) and also to walk worthy of that good report
(as the Apostle who had given a great testimony of the bounty of the
Corinthians, earnestly exhorts them to finish their benevolence, lest (says
he) I should be ashamed in 2 Cor. 9. 4.
this my constant boasting.) For if they of whom there is once a good report
raised, decay, wax cold, grow backward, or fall into notorious and scandalous
sins, they will clean extinguish and put out their good name among men, and
turn it into an evil report, according to that which Solomon says, Dead
flies cause the ointment of the Apothecarie to sendforth a Eccles. 10. 1.
stinking savor: so does a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom
and honor. 5. Manifest a care of one another good name.


. 36. Of husbands and wives like affection toward one another credit.
In the last place, to manifest a mutual provident care of one another good
name, husbands and wives must be so affected with the report that goes of
either of them, as if the report were of their own selves. If the report be
good, to be glad thereof, and to rejoice thereat; if it be evil, to be
grieved, and after an holy manner vexed at it: thus shall they show a true
sympathy and fellow feeling of one another credit, according to that general
rule of the Apostle, Romans 12. 15.
Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

. 37. Of the vices contrary to that mutuallcare, which man and wife should
have of one another credit.
Vices contrary to these duties concerning the good name of Contrary vices.
an husband and wife, are in general two.

One is a readiness to disgrace and discredit one another, 1. To discredit
each other, and that
like Michal the wife of David, of whom we heard before. A hateful and
detestable vice this is, which cannot stand with 2 Samuel 6. 20.
true matrimonial love, but rather argues an utter dislike, and a plain
hatred of one another.

Husbands and wives discredit one another, either by procuring an ill name, or
hindering a good name.

An ill name in procured by these means following.

1. By blazing abroad one another infirmities: as when 1. By blazing one
another infirmities abroad.
tatling Gossips meet, their usual pra^e is about their husbands, complaining
of some vice or other in them: My husband, says one, is covetous: I cannot get
of him any thing almost: he makes me go as no body goes. And my husband,
replieth another, is so furious as none can tell how to speak to him: so one
after another goes on in this tracke, some discovering such infirmities as
should be concealed; others (which is worse) plainly belying their husbands. In
like manner also husbands when they meet with their boon companions, make
their wives the common subject of all their talk: one accusing his wife of one
vice; another his, of another. There are two respects for which this vice (most

they know more then any other of one another infirmities: so as if they be so
euilly minded, they may much more discredit one another, then any other can. 2.
Because in regard of their near union they are most bound to conceal and
cover each others imperfections. Genesis 9. 22, 25.
Came was cursed for revealing his fathers nakedness. but a more horrible curse
do husbands and wives deserve, that so do.

which are raised of them, and are in every man's mouth: of all other,
bedfellowes are most fit to disclose such things one to another: and most bound
to do it. Most fit, because of their mutual familiarity: most bound, because
of their near union.

Many husbands and wives do hinder one another good 5. By envying and

name by envying one at the good report that is made of the other, and
gainsaying the same: as if the credit of the one must needs turn to the
discredit of the other. Thus as water quenches hot iron, so this envious
disposition is a means to extinguish the heat of fame, and to put out the
glorious light of a good name. Whereby as they impair the credit and honor of
one another, so they monstrously discredit and dishonor themselves.

The other general vice in this kind, is a careless regard, 2. Neglect of
each others fame.
or plain neglect of one another fame: when the husband is no way affected
with any report that goes of his wife, nor the wife with any of the husband:
but as if they were mere strangers one to another, they pass by all reports
made of one another. What mutual love can there be in such? howsoever their
hands have been joined together, surely their hearts were never united, so as
it had been better they had never known one another, unless the Lord do
afterward knit their hearts, and unite their affections more nearly and
firmly together.

. 38. Of husbands and wives mutual providence about the goods of the family.
Yet there remains one thing more, whereabout husbands Treatise 3.. 29.
and wives ought to manifest a mutual provident care each over other: and that
is about the goods of this world. Howsoever the husband, while he lives with
his wife, has the truest property in them, and the greatest title unto them,
yet I refer this to those mutual duties which man and wife owe each to
other, in three respects.

First, because in conscience they appertain to the use of the wife, as well
as of the husband.

Secondly, because the wife is by Gods providence appointed a joint governor
with the husband of the family, and in that respect ought to be an help in
providing such a sufficiency of the goods of this world, as are needful for
that estate wherein God has set them, and for that charge which God has
committed to them.

Thirdly, because the wife, if she survive the husband, ought to have such a
portion of those goods, as are meet for her place and charge.

In these respects we see it requisite, yea a bounden duty, that husband and
wife, even in a mutual regard one of another, be as provident as they can be
with a good conscience in getting, keeping, and disposing competent goods and
riches for the mutual good one of another. Concerning the husbands duty in
this respect no question is made: the practice of all good husbands mentioned
in Scripture, the care of providing for their 1 Timothy 5. 8. See Treat. 4.. 46.
own enjoined to them, their place and office to be their wives head, with
many other like arguments, whereof we shall more distinctly speak, when we
come to declare the particular duties of husbands, do prove as much. The
greatest question is concerning the wife, whether she be bound to take any care
about the goods. But if the Scripture be tho^owly searched, we shall find
proof enough to show that even ^he also is bound hereunto. For first, the
general end which God aimed at in making the woman (namely to be Genesis 2. 18.
an help ^o man) implies as much: for herein may she be a very great help,
as we shall see by and by in sundry particulars. 2. That general property
attributed to a wife to be Prou. 18. 22.
a good thing, confirms as much: for that which is profitable is called good:
and it is one respect wherein a wife is termed a good thing, that she may by
her providence and diligence bring much profit to her husband: and therefore in
this, among other respects, the good wife which Solomon describes, is said
Prou. 31. 12.
to do good to her husband all the days of her life: for by her industry and
providence she did so preserve and increase his goods, that Verse. 11.
the heart of her husband trusted in her, and he had no need of spoil. If the
particular actions whereby that good wife is described be well noted, we may
easily observe that she was an especial help unto her husband, even in his
outward estate. From all which, we may infer these two points. First, that
this provident care about outward temporal goods is lawful, not unbeseeming a
Christian man or woman. Secondly, that it is a mutual duty appertaining both
to husband and wife.

For the first, how needful the goods of this world are for preservation of
life and health, estate of the family, good of Church and Commonwealth,
relief of the poor, with the like uses, no man can be ignorant. God has
given them as blessings to his children, and that often times in great
abundance; and his children have accordingly been thankful for them: so as a
provident care about them is not unlawful, but very expedient and needful.

For the second, If there should not be a joint care herein, the care and
pains of the one might be altogether in vain. For suppose an husband be
industrious, as Genesis 31. 40.
Iaakob was, and get much abroad, if the wife either by her unthriftiness,
idleness, negligence, or the like vices, suffer that which is brought home to
be embeaseled and wasted; or by her prodigality, bravery, or love of vain
company, consume it her self, where will be the profit of the husbands
pains? Or on the other side, if a wife should be as painful and prosperous in
getting, as Prou. 31. 10. etc.
the good houswife before mentioned was, and the husband by carding, dicing,
drinking, reuelling, or other like means should waste all away, what fruit
would remain of the wives providence? In this mutual provident care of
husband and wife, each of them must have an eye to their own place: affairs
abroad do most appertain to the man, and are especially Externa negotia viro
permit. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp.
to be ordered by him: that which the wife is especially to care for, is the
business of the house: for the Apostle lays it down as a rule for wives (as
we shall hereafter more particularly declare) that they Tit. 2. 5.
keep at home, and 1 Timothy 5. 14.
govern the house. By this means may they be very profitable each to other.

. 39. Of the vices contrary to the good providence of husband and wife, about
the goods of the family.
Contrary to that duty, are these vices following.

1. Covetousness, and overmuch care for themselves: as Contrary vices.
when an husband so raketh, and scrapeth, and hoordeth up for himself, as he
neither affords unto his wife so much as is 1. Covetousness.
meet for her place while he lives with her, nor thinks of providing
sufficient maintenance for her, if she ouer-liue him, but rather thinks how
to defraud her of that which the law casts upon her. Or when a wife secretly
hoordeth up whatsoever she can get, either by her own industry, or else by
purloining from her husband: sometimes selling corn, wares, household stuff,
or other like commodities, so privily as the husband shall never know it:
sometimes taking money out of his counter, box, bag, chest, or the like, so
as either it shall not be missed, or if it be, it shall not be known who had
it. Many there be who in mistrust of their husbands providence, or in dislike
of them, or on some other by-respects, commit whatsoever they can get to the
trust and custody of others, whereby it often comes to pass, that they
themselves, meeting with deceitful friends, are utterly defeated, even because
they dare not make their fraud known. As Covetousness is in it self an
odious sin; so it is made much more heinous by defrauding husband or wife,
who ought to be as dear each to other as themselves.

2. Prodigality, and too lavish spending upon themselves, 2. Prodigality.
and those things which are most agreeable to their own corrupt humor: as when
husbands without any mean or mea^ure, spend their goods abroad in hunting,
hauking, carding, ^icing, eating, drinking, or the like, and suffer their wives
to want at home, and yet took their wives to maintain them, and therefore had
their portion. Or when wives bring their husbands into debt, and weaken, if not
clean overthrow their estate, by gorgeous decking and adorning their houses,
by brave and costly apparel, by dainty fare, by gossipping abroad, with the
like. Many wives are so violent herein, that if their desire and humor be not
satisfied, their husbands shall have no rest (forsooth they brought a portion,
and maintained they must and will be; it skilleth not whether their husbands
estate can bear it or no) in so much as many are forced wittingly, for
quietness sake, to suffer their estate to sink. O foolish and wretched wives!
how little do they consider that they were married to do their husbands good,
and not evil all the days of their life? is this to be an help to man? or
rather is it not clean to thwart Gods counsel, and pervert his purpose? can
we think that God will forbear, and not be avenged of them? yet much more
will God be avenged of the forenamed husbands, because of that image of
himself which he has placed in them, and because of that place and authority
wherein he has set them. The Apostle expressly says of them, that they are
worse then Infidels, which being so, they must look for 1 Timothy 5. 8.
the greater judgment.

3. Idleness, and a careless neglect of their estate. Many 3. Idleness.
men spend day after day, like a bird that flies up and down, as it falls
out, from tree to tree, from twigge to twigge: they go from place to place,
but know not for what end: as they meet with any company, so they abide as long
as the company tarrieth, and then seek after other company, and are ready to
go with any to Alehouse, Tavern, Playhouse, Bowlingalley, or other like
places. Many women also spend all the forenoone in lying a bed and tyring
themselves, and the afternoon as occasion is offered in sitting idly at home,
or walking forth to little purpose, but only to wear out time, little
regarding their husbands estate, whether it increase, or diminish. Thus by the
idleness and carelessness of husband and wife, come fair estates many times
to ruin, and both of then brought to penury and beggary.

. 40. Of husbands and wives joint care in governing the family.
Hitherto I have delivered such common duties as mutually respect the husband
and wife, and are to be performed of each to other. There are other common
duties which they are both jointly bound to perform to other persons: and
those either members of the family, or strangers coming to the family.

Concerning the members of the family, though there be some peculiar duties
belonging to the master, and some to the mistress, some to the father, and
some to the mother, of which we shall speak in their due place; yet in
general the government of the family, and the several members thereof
belongs to the husband and wife both (if at least they have a family) and a
joint common duty it is to be helpful one to another therein.

Object. Seeing it is not necessarily required, that a husband and wife should
have a family to govern, for two may be married and have neither children nor
servants (as many are) and yet be true husband and wife; why is this care of a
family ranked among the duties of husband and wife?

Answ. 1. Because ordinarily when two are married they gather a family, and are
the governors thereof: so as though it fail in some particulars, yet for the
most part it holds.

2. Because the joint government whereof I speak in this place is by virtue of
the mariage-bond: for if a man and a woman should live together in an house,
and by mutual consent have a joint authority and government, this would be
very offensive to all that should know it, or hear of it: neither were they by
any ordinance of God bound to be so helpful one to another as husband and
wife: nor the members of a family so bound to subject themselves to both.

3. The duty whereof I speak, though it be about the government of a family,
yet has it respect to an husband as he is an husband, and to a wife as she is
a wife; namely, that by virtue of their mariage-bond, and near union, they be
helpful one to another in well-ordering the things of the family.

Whether the man ought to look to the good government of his house is a
question without all question. He is the highest in the family, and has both
authority over all, and the charge of all is committed to his charge: he is as
a king in his own house: as a king is to see that land well governed where he
is king, so he that is the chief ruler in an house. The duty which the
Apostle applies in particular to Bishops and Deacons, in general appertains
to all husbands, 1 Timothy 3. 4.
that they rule their own house honestly: and again, Verse. 12.
that they be such as can rule their children well, and their own households.
The care of many husbands is in this respect commended in Scripture, as of Genesis
18. 19.
Abram, of and 35. 2, etc.
Iaakob, of J^s^ 4. 15.
Iosuah, of Psalm. 101. 2. etc.
David, the Ioh. 4 53.
Ruler at Galile, and of many other. That the wife also ought to be an help to
him therein, is very evident: for the Apostle lays it expressly to their
charge, 1 Timothy 5. 14.
that they govern the house: would the Wise man have so highly commended a
wife Prou. 31. 11, etc.
for well governing her husbands house if it had not appertained to her? It is
very likely that wise Abigail had a great hand in governing Nabals house,
because the servants made complaint to her of Nabals churlishness, and because
she had the servants at command, readily to do what she would have them; yea
also, because she could so readily prepare such store of provision for David
and his men, as she did. Hence is it that the wife is called Mater-familias.
mistress of the house, as well as the husband Pater-familias.
master of the house.

Object. 1 Timothy 2. 12.
A woman is not to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man.

Answ. 1. That branch of teaching has respect to public assemblies, and
Churches, in which she may not teach: but not to private families, in which she
may, and ought to teach: for Pro. 31. 4.
Barthshebah taught Solomon. When Acts 18. 26.
Apollos was brought to the house of Aquila, Priscilla the wife of Aquila did
help to expound to Apollos the way of God more perfectly.

2. The other branch concerning authority, has not reference to the inferior
members in the family, over which the wife of an household governor has
authority, but only to the husband, over whom if she take any authority, she
usurps it. Therefore neither this place of Scripture, nor any other does
exclude the wife, being jointly considered with the husband, to rule and
govern those in the family which are under them both.

2. Object. This joint government of the wife does much impair the dignity and
authority of the husband.

Answ. Nothing less: for she is subordinate to her husband, and must so rule
others as she be subject to her husband, and not command any thing against his
command, (provided that his command be not against the Lord, and his word.) We
see that in all estates the king or highest governor has other Magistrates
under him, who have a command over the subjects, and yet thereby the kings
supreme authority is no whit impaired, but rather the better established, and
he the more honored. So is it in a family. 1. Reason. Husbands and wives by
their mutual assistance bring great help one to another. Plus vident oculi
quam oculus. Arist. Polit. li. 3. c. 7.


Let therefore husbands and wives herein assist one another, for so they may be
very helpful one to another, and bring, by their mutual help in governing,
much good to the family. The husband by his help aiding his wife, adds much
authority unto her, and so causes that she is not despised, nor lightly
esteemed. The wife by her help causes many things to be espied, and so
redressed, which otherwise might never have been found out: for two eyes see
more then one, especially when one of those is more at hand, and in presence,
as the 2. Reason. Many things in a family more fit for the one to meddle with,
then for the other.
wife is in the house.

Besides there are many things in well governing a family more fit for one to
meddle withal then for the other: as for the husband to meddle with the great
and weighty affairs of the family (as performing Gods worship, appointing and
settling good orders, providing convenient house-roome, and other necessaries
for the family: keeping children when they grow In familia dispertita sunt
officia: suntque alia viri, alia vxoris propria. Pro* sunt ergo vterque alteri
sua in commune confe rentes: ob eamque causam suauitas in hac tali amicitia
inest, vtilitasque maxima. Arist. Eth. li. 8. ca. 12.
great, or wax stubborn, in awe: ruling men servants, with the like) And for
the wife to meddle with some less, but very needful matters, as nourishing
and instructing children when they are young, adorning the house, ordering the
provision brought into the house, ruling maid servants, with the like. Yea
further, as the man especially is to perform the very actions of prayer,
reading the word, catechizing, and other like duties in the family, so the wife
may be a great help in putting her husband in mind both of the duty it
self, and of the time of performing it, and encouraging him to do it, in
gathering the family together, and exhorting them to be forward, in making her
self an example to the rest by her diligent and reverend attention, in often
urging and pressing to her children and servants such points of instruction as
her husband has taught; yea, in praying, reading, teaching, and performing
like exercises her self, so far as she is able, when her husband is absent,
or negligent and careless, and will not himself do them; or it may be, is
not able to do them: or if she perform them not her self, in getting some
other to perform them.

. 41. Of the vices contrary to a joint care of governing the family.
The mind and practice of many, both husbands and wives, Vices contrary.
is contrary to this duty.

Many a husband because the wives office is especially to 1. When husbands put
off all government to their wives.
abide at home, will put off all government to the wife: leaving it to her not
only to order the things in the house, but also to bring in all needful things,
to order and govern the children both young and old, yea even to provide for
them also, to take in, to put out, to use all sorts of servants as pleases
her: yea, if servants shall be stubborn and stout against her, he will take no
notice of it, nor endure to be told of it, much less afford her his
assistance, but suffer her to be disgraced and despised. As for religious
duties, he will no way meddle with them. Oh base minded men, unworthy to be
husbands and heads of wives! shall your wives who were made to be an help to
you, have no help from you, ^o not in those things which especially belong to
your charge? shall the weaker vessels bear all the burden? Assuredly as the
man carries away the greatest reputation and honor when a family is well
governed (though it be by the joint care and wisdom of his wife) so lies he
most open to the judgment of God if the government thereof be neglected, and
through the neglect thereof, children and servants grow impious: instance 1 Samuel 3. 12, 13.
Elie, and 2 Samuel 15.
David. For as in a commonwealth, the greatest honor of good government,
victorious battles, happy peace, and prosperity, and the greatest dishonor and
damage of the contrary, redoundeth to the king, so to the man who is chief
governor in a family: for it is presupposed, that all which do any good are
instruments of the highest governor: if any evil or mischief fall out, that
it is through his negligence.

On the other side, because the husband is the most principal, 2. When wives
refuse to add their aid.
many wives think that the government of the family nothing at all appertains
to them, and thereupon are careless of the good thereof, and will not stir
their least finger to order any thing aright: but, if any thing be amiss, lay
all the blame on their husbands. Do not such pervert that maine end for which
God made them, even to be an help? Do they not carry themselves most
unworthy of the place wherein God has set them, namely to be ioynt-gouernours
with their husbands, and partakers of their dignities? As by their negligence
they make themselves accessory to all the evil which falls out in the
family, so assuredly shall they have their part in those judgments which are
executed on the head thereof.

Most contrary to the forenamed duty is the practice of 3. When husbands or
wives are hindrances each to other.
such as are hindrances one to another in governing the family: as when wives
are not only negligent themselves in coming to religious exercises, but keep
back children and servants, and so are a great grief unto their religious
husbands: or when they use any of the children or servants to be instruments of
iniquity; or are themselves disquiet and troublesome in the house, like to her
of whom Solomon speaks in this proverb, It is better to dwell in the corner
of the house Pro. 21. 9.
top, then with a contentious woman in a wide house.

Husbands also are often an hinderance to that good government which their wives
would help forward, when they scoff and scorn at that good counsel which
their wives give them for that purpose, or when they will not suffer their
wives to meddle with any thing at all, nor endure that they should find any
fault, much less take in hand to redress any thing that is amiss. These and
such like perverse dispositions are in husbands and wives, whereby it comes
to pass that they who were joined together to be a mutual help each to
other, prove heavy, yea intolerable burdens.

. 42. Of husbands and wives mutual help in hospitality.
The next common duty of husband and wife respects such as come to their
house, but are no particular members thereof, whether they be kindred,
alliance, acquaintance, or strangers, especially if they be Saints, to whom
Heb. 13. 2. Romans 12. 13.
hospitality, that is, a kind and courteous entertainment, is due. Herein
therefore must husbands and wives be helpful one to another: for as it is
required of 1 Timothy 3. 2.
husbands, so also of and 5. 10.
wives to be harborous, namely while they are married, together with their
husbands, and when they are widows, of themselves. Genesis 18 6. etc.
Abraham and Sarah were herein an help one to another, when the three Angels
in shapes of men came to their house: so were 2 King. 4. 8.
the Shunemite and her husband when Elisha the Prophet came to their house.

For hospitality, that it is a commendable duty belonging Reasons. 1.
Hospitality a commendable duty.
to such as are housekeepers and able to give entertainment, is evident by the
precepts and examples before specified, as also by the blessing which God
thereupon has brought to the houses of them that were given thereunto, which
the Apostle intimates in these words, Heb. 13. 2.
thereby some have entertained Angels unawares. Now therefore husbands and wives
being (as we have heard) joint governors, as in other things, so in this they
ought to lend an helping hand each to other, and that for these reasons.

1. Because in giving entertainment there are sundry 2. The entertainment will

things to be done, whereof some are proper to the husbands place, and some to
the wives. To take order for the provision of things without doors is more fit
for the husband, Genesis 18. 7.
Abraham did it: to order the smaller things within doors is more fit for the
wife; that was left to Verse. 6.
Sarah.

2. Because it is meet that guests should know they are welcome 3. Guests will

be an especial means, as to manifest their mutual affection, so to hold the
hearts of man and wife firm and close together, and make them the better like
and love one the other: especially if the husband shall show himself as ready
and willing to entertain his wives friends and kindred as his own, and so the
wife her husbands (as they ought.) For as they themselves are made one flesh,
so ought each of them to esteem of the others friends as of their own.

4. Because thus they show a mutual desire of bringing 5. A desire of one
another good manifested.
Gods blessing on each other, and upon their whole family.

. 43. Of vices contrary to mutual help in hospitality.
Contrary to this duty is for the most part covetousness in the husband, and
lasinesse in the wife. The man, because the charge of the family lies on him,
distrustfully fears lest he should want for his own.

I deny not but that a provident care for our own, and namely for them of the
family, is needful and commendable, 1 Timothy 5. 8.
he that provides not for them is worse then an infidel: so as a man may be
ouerlauish in giving entertainment, if he go beyond his means, impouerish his
estate, and disable himself to provide for his own, as many do: yet when a
man has sufficient, yea and abundance, when there is no just cause, but
merely upon an undue fear too carkingly, and distrustfully to pinch, and
grudge to give entertaiment to any, is unbeseeming a Christian, yea also to be
worse then an infidel; not worthy to have an house, or any thing fit for
entertainment; no nor worthy of common society.

The woman on the other side grudgeth at the pains she must take, and trouble
she must undergo about entertaining guests, and thereupon is loath that any at
any time should come to their house.

Concerning a wife, I deny not but that an husband may be in this kind
ouerburdensome to her, by being too ioueall, as they speak, and bringing
guests too often into the house, especially if they be guests of no good name;
and by that means make her even weary of her life: but yet for a wife to
refuse all pains in that kind, and to be discontented when her husband
inuites any friends, or when any come (as the three Angels did to Abraham)
unawares, argues not a loving affection, nor a wiuelike subjection unto her
husband, to be in her.

These faults are so much the greater when the husband, or wife, are free and
forward in entertaining their own kindred and friends: but are backward, and
grudge at the entertainment of each others friends and kindred. Hence commonly
arises much heart-burning of one against the other: yea much jar and
contention betwixt them: and from dislike of the practice of one another in
this kind often follows a dislike of one another person: so that as the fault
is bad in it self, it proves to be much worse in the mischiefs that follow
upon it.

. 44. Of husbands and wives mutual help in releeuing the poor.
The last common and joint duty wherein husband and wife ought to be helpful
each to other, respects those that are without the house, namely the poor,
and such as stand in need of their help, who are to be relieved and succored.
Because man and wife usually meal together, and are joint partakers of Gods
good creatures, they must put one another in mind of that precept of charity
which was given to the Jews when they were at their meals, Neh. 8. 10.
send part unto them for whom none is provided. The good wife which is set
forth by the holy Ghost for a pattern and example unto others to follow,
together with her husband, are noted to be helpful one to another in this
duty: for she is said Pro. 31. 20.
to stretch out her hand to the poor, and to the needy: and he is said Verse.
28.
to praise her, thereby encouraging her to hold on in doing those good things
which she did. What liberty the wife has, or howfar forth she may be
restrained in case her husband utterly refuse to give consent, we shall Treat.
3.. 23. 33.
hereafter declare in the particular duties of wives: the point here noted is,
that both the husband himself must according to his ability be bountiful to
the poor, and suffer his wife, yea provoke her so to be, and withal allow her
wherewithal to be bountiful: and that the wife also must stir up her
husband to liberality in this respect, and her self open her hand to the
poor in the things which lawfully she may give.

There is nothing whereby a man or wife can bring more profit to the house, then
by giving to the poor: that which is given to the poor is Prou. 19. 17.
lent to the Lord, and he will repay it with great increase: it is as 2 Cor. 9.
6.
seed, which being liberally sown, will bring forth a plentiful harvest: yea,
it is a means to make us Luke 16. 9.
friends, to speak a good word for us at the bar of Christ's judgment seat:
and it brings not only the Job 29. 13. and 31. 20.
blessing of men, but Matthew. 5. 7.
of God also, even the greatest blessing of all, the Mat. 25. 34.
blessing of eternal life: for it is Heb. 13. 16.
a sacrifice with which God is well pleased. The Apostle notes this to be one
of Christ's oracles, which by word of mouth he left unto his Disciples, Acts 20.
35.
It is more blessed to give then to receive.

Besides, husbands and wives in distributing alms, may receive 2. Husband and
wife in place to give good direction one to another.
good direction one from another: the husband by telling the wife who are fit
to be relieved (for commonly husbands better know those which are abroad out of
the family) the wife by telling the husband what things are fittest to be given
away: for wives commonly know of what things there is greatest store, and what
may in the house be best spared.

. 45. Of husbands and wives unmercifulness to the poor.
Contrary is the unmercifulness of many husbands, who Vices contrary.
are not only hard-hearted themselves (never giving any thing unless by the
law of the land they be forced, and then they part 1. Unmercifulness of the

their sin in an high degree.

On the other side, the unmercifulness of many wives is also contrary to the
forenamed duty: for there are many, who though they have liberty to give of
the common goods, and also allowance of their own out of which they may give,
yet couetously hoord up all they can get, give not a pennies worth, out rather
suffer victuals and other things to perish in the house, and when they are
naught to fling them away, then that any thing whilst it is good should be
given out of the house. Shall not the creatures which are spoiled in an house,
and the poor that have wanted, make a loud cry in the ears Read Iam. 5. 1,
2. etc.
of the Lord against them? Yea further, many wives are grieved at their
husbands bounty, and still moving him to shut his hand, and give no more. Are
they not plain devils herein, opposing against that which is good?

IN the particular declaration of wives duties, the Apostle notes two points,
1. The duty required. 2. The reason to enforce it.


In setting forth the duty, he declares 1. The matter wherein it consists.
2. The manner how it is to be performed.


In the matter we may note, 1. The thing required, (...).

To declare the quality of wives subjection to their husbands, two rules are
set down.

1. That it be such a subjection, as As unto the Lord.
should be performed to Christ.

2. That it be such a subjection as the As the Church is subject to Christ.
Church performs unto Christ.

The extent of wives subjection does stretch it self very far, even to
(...), In every thing.
all things.

The reason to enforce all these points is taken from that place of eminency
and authority, wherein the husband is set above his wife: which is,

1. Propounded under the metaphor of an head (for the husband is the head of
the wife.)

2. Amplified by that resemblance which therein he has unto Christ.

In which resemblance two points are noted.

1. That the husband, by virtue of his place, carries the very image of
Christ (even as Christ is the head of the Church.)

2. That the husband by virtue of his office is a protector of his wife (and he
is the savior of the body.)

. 2. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 2.
subjection in general.
The first point to be handled in the treatise of wives particular duties is
the general matter of all (Subjection) under which all other particulars are
comprised, for it has as large Maritum habere Dominum meruit mulieris culpa,
quod tamen nisi seruetur, deprauabitur amplius natura, and augebitur culpa.
Aug. de Genesis ad lit. lib. 11. c. 37. Ante peccatum non aliter factam fuisse
decet credere mulierem nisi vt vir ei dominaretur. Ibid.
an extent as that Honor which is required in the first commandment, being
applied to wives. When first the Lord declared unto woman her duty, he set it
down under this phrase, Thy desire shall be subject to thine husband, Genesis 3.
16.

Object. That was a punishment inflicted on her for her transgression?
Answ. And a law too, for trial of her obedience, which if it be not observed,
her nature will be more depraved, and her fault more increased. Besides, we
cannot but think that the woman was made before the fall, that the man might
rule over her. Upon this ground the Prophets and Apostles have often urged the
same. Sarah is commended for this, that she was subject to her husband (1. Pet.
3. 6.) Hereby the holy Ghost would teach wives, that Subjection ought to be as
salt to season every duty which they perform to their husband. Their very
opinion, affection, speech, action, and all that concerns the husband, must
savor of subjection. Contrary is the disposition of many wives, whom ambition
has tainted and corrupted within and without: they cannot endure to hear of
subjection: they imagine that they are made slaves thereby. But I hope partly
by that which has been before delivered concerning those common duties which
man and wife do mutually owe each to other, and partly by the particulars
which under this general are comprised, but most especially Quem vocavit ad
culpam mulier, iustum est vt eum gubernatorem assuma^, ne iterum foeminea
facilitate labatur. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7.
by the duties which the husband in particular owes to his wife, it will
evidently appear, that this subjection is no servitude. But were it more then
it is, seeing God requires subjection of a wife to her husband, the wife is
bound to yield it. And good reason it is that she who first drew man into sin,
should be now subject to him, lest by the like womanish weakness she fall
again.

. 3. Of an husbands Treat. 4.. 6, 7.
superiority over a wife, to be acknowledged by a wife.
The subjection which is required of a wife to her husband implies two things.
1. That she acknowledge her husband to be her superior. 2. That she respect
him as her superior.


That acknowledgement of the husbands superiority is twofold, 1. General of
any husband. 2. Particular of her own husband.

The general is the ground of the particular: for till a wife be informed that
an husband, by virtue of his place, is his wives superior, she will not be
persuaded that her own husband is above her, or has any authority over her.

First therefore concerning the general, I will lay down Proofs that the
husband is above the wife
some evident and undeniable proofs, to show that an husband is his wives
superior, and has authority over her. The proofs are these following.

1. God of whom, Romans 13. 1.
the powers that be ordained, are, has power to place his Image in whom he
will, and to whom God gives superiority and authority, the same ought to be
acknowledged to be due unto them. But God said of the man to the woman, he
shall rule over thee, (Genesis 3. 16.)

2. Nature has placed an eminency in the male over the Mari and foeminae ae
natura tribuium est, vt hi, praesit, illa obediat, cum mas praestantior sit.
Arist. Pol. lib. 1.
female: so as where they are linked together in one yoke, it is given by
nature that he should govern, she obey. This did the heathen by light of
nature observe.

3. The titles and names, whereby an husband is set forth, do implie a
superiority and authority in him, as (...).
Lord, (1 Pet. 3. 6.) (...)
Master, (Est. 1. 17.) (...)
Guide, (Prou. 2. 17.) (...).
Head, (1 Cor. 11. 3.) (...).
Image and glory of God, (1 Cor. 11. 7.)

4. The persons whom the husband by virtue of his place, and whom the wife by
virtue of her place, represent, most evidently prove as much: for an husband
represents Christ, and a wife, the Church, (Ephesians. 5. 23.)

5. The circumstances noted by the holy Ghost at the woman's creation implie no
less, as that she was created after man, for man's good, and out of man's side,
(Genesis 2. 18, etc.)

6. The very Sicapilli pro velamine dati sunt, qua gratia aliud addendu^ est
velamen? Vt non tantum natura, sed etiam voluntate subiectam se esse
confiteatur. Chrysostom. in 1 Cor. hom. 26.
attire which nature and custom of all times and places have taught women to
put on, confirms the same: as long hair, vailes, and other couerings over
the head: this and the former argument does the Apostle himself use to this
very purpose, 1 Cor. 11. 7, etc.

The point then being so clear, wives ought in conscience to acknowledge as
much: namely that an husband has superiority 1. Wives must acknowledge a
superiority in husbands.
and authority over a wife. The acknowledgement hereof is a maine and
principal duty, and a ground of all other duties. Till a wife be fully
instructed therein and truly persuaded thereof, no duty can be performed by
her as it ought: for subjection has relation to superiority and authority.
The very notation of the word implies as much. How then can subjection be
yielded, if husbands be not acknowledged superiors? It may be forced, as one
King conquered in battle by another, may be compelled to yield homage to the
conqueror, but yet because he still thinks with himself, that he is no whit
inferior, he will hardly be brought willingly to yield a subjects duty to
him, but rather expect a time when he may free himself and take revenge of the
conqueror.

. 4. Of a fond conceit, that husband and wife are equal.
Contrary to the forenamed subjection is the opinion of many wives, who think
themselves every way as good as their husbands, and no way inferior to them.

The reason whereof seems to be that small inequality Of all that are
inferiors, the wife comes nearest to a paritic.
which is betwixt the husband and the wife: for of all degrees wherein there is
any difference betwixt person and person, there is the least disparitie betwixt
man and wife. Though the man be as the head, yet is the woman as the heart,
which is the most excellent part of the body next the head, far more
excellent then any other member under the head, and almost equal to the head
in many respects, and as necessary as the head. As an evidence, that a wife is
to man as the heart to the head, she was at her Genesis 2. 21.
first creation taken out of the side of man where his heart lies; and though
the woman was at first 1 Cor. 11. 12.
of the man created out of his side, yet is the man also by the woman. Ever
since the first creation man has been borne and brought forth out of the
woman's womb: so as neither the man is without the woman, nor the woman without
the man: yea, as 1 Cor. 7. 4. Cum de pudicitia sermonem habet, magna paritas.
Chrysostom. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7.
the wife has not power of her own body, but the husband, so the husband has
not power of his own body, but the wife. They are also 1 Pet. 3. 7. (...).
heirs together of the grace of life. Besides, wives are mothers of the same
children, whereof their husbands are fathers (for God said to both, Genesis 1. 28.
multiply and increase) and mistresses of the same servants whereof they are
masters (for Sarah is called and 16. 4. Object. Answ.
mistress) and in many other respects there is a common equity betwixt
husbands and wives; whence many wives gather that in all things there ought to
be a mutual equality.

But from some particulars to infer a general is a very weak argument.

1. Does it follow, that because in many things there is a common equity
betwixt Judges of Assise, Justices of peace, and Constables of towns, that
therefore there is in all things an equality betwixt them?

2. In many things there is not a common equity: for the husband may command
his wife, but not she him.

3. Even in those things wherein there is a common equity, there is not an
equality: for the husband has ever even in all things a superiority: as if
there be any difference even in the forenamed instances, the husband must have
the stroke: as in giving the name of Rachels youngest child, where the wife
would have one name, the husband another, that name which the husband gave,
stood, (Genesis 35. 18.)

Though there seem to be never so little disparitie, yet God having so
expressly appointed subjection, it ought to be acknowledged: and Possunt
coniuges per charitatem seruire inuicem, sed mulierem non permittit Apostolus
dominari in virum. Aug. de Genesis ad lit. l. 11. c. 37.
though husband and wife may mutually serve one another through love: yet the
Apostle suffers not a woman to rule over the man.

. 5. Of a wives acknowledgement of her Treat. 4. 9.

The truth and life of that general acknowledgement of husbands honor,
consists in the particular application thereof unto their own proper husbands.

The next duty therefore is, that wives acknowledge their All wives must

marriage, to be worthy of an husbands honor, and to be their superior: thus

own) which he uses very often: so likewise does 1 Pet. 3. 1, 5.
S. Peter, exhorting wives to be in subjection 1 Cor. 7. 2.
to their own husbands: and hereunto restraining the commendation of the
ancient good wives, that they were in subjection to their own husbands.

Object. What if a man of mean place be married to a woman of eminent place, or
a servant be married to his mistress, or an aged woman to a youth, must such a
wife acknowledge such an husband her superior?

Answ. Yea verily: for in giving her self to be his wife, and Wives inferior
to those over whom they were before marriage.
taking him to be her husband, she aduanceth him above herself, and subiecteth
her self unto him. It booteth nothing what either of them were before marriage:
by virtue of the matrimonial bond the husband is made the head of his wife,
though the husband were before marriage a very beggar, and of mean parentage,
and the wife very wealthy and of a noble stock; or though he were her
prentise, or bondslaue; which also holds in the case betwixt an aged woman
and a youth: for the Scripture has made no exception in any of those cases.

2. Object. But what if a man of lewd and beastly conditions, as a drunkard, a
glutton, a profane swaggerer, an impious swearer, and blasphemer, be married to
a wife, sober, religious Matron, must she account him her superior, and worthy
of an husbands honor?

Answ. Surely she must. For the evil quality and disposition Subjection due
to husbands of evil qualities.
of his heart and life, does not deprive a man of that civil honor which God
has given unto him. Though an husband in regard of evil qualities may carry
the Image of the devil, yet in regard of his place and office he bears the
^mage of God: so do Magistrates in the commonwealth, Ministers in the Church,
parents and masters in the family. Note for our present purpose, the
exhortation of S. Peter to Christian wives which had infidel husbands, 1 Pet
3. 1, 2.
Be in subjection to them: let your conversation be in fear. If Infidels
carry ^ot the devils Image, and are not, so long as they are Infidels, ^assals
of Satan, who are? yet wives must be subject to them, and fear them.

. 6. Of wives denying honor to their own husbands.
Contrary thereunto is a very perverse disposition in some A perverse opinion
to think other husbands worthy of honor, and not their own.
wives, who think they could better subject themselves to any husband, then
their own. Though in general they acknowledge that an husband is his wives
superior, yet when the application comes to themselves they fail, and
cannot be brought to yield, that they are their husbands inferiors. This is a
vice worse then the former. For to acknowledge no husband to be superior over
his wife, but to think man and wife in all things equal, may proceed from
ignorance of hind, and error of judgment. But for a wife who knows and
acknowledges the general, that an husband is above his wife, to imagine that
she her self is not inferior to her husband, arises from monstrous
self-conceit, and intolerable ^rrogancy, as if she her self were above her
own sex, and ^ore then a woman.

Contrary also is the practice of such See Treat. 2. part. 1.. 9.
women, as purposely ^ary men of far lower rank then themselves, for this
very end, that they may rule over their own husbands: and of others who being

unseemly, and cleaneth warting Gods ordinance. But let them think of ruling

what they list, the truth is, that they make themselves subjects both by Gods
law and man's: of which subjection such wives do often feel the heauiest burden.
Solomon notes this to be one of the things for which the earth is disquieted,
when Prou. 30. 21, 22.
a servant reigns. Now when can a servant more dominere, then when he has
married his mistress? As for aged women who are married to youths, I may say (as
in another case it was said) woe to thee o wife whose husband is a child.
Unmeet it is Eccle. 10. 16.
that an aged man should be married to a young maid, but much more unmeet for an
aged woman to be married to a youth.

. 7. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 11
inward fear of her husband.
Hitherto of a wives acknowledgement of her husbands superiority. It follows
to speak of that answerable respect which she ought to bear toward him.

A wiue-like respect of her husband consists in two points: 1. Reverence. 2.
Obedience.

The reverence which she owes to him is Wiue-like fear.
1. Inward. 2. Outward.

Inward reverence is an awful respect which a wife in her heart has of her
husband, esteeming him worthy of all honor for his place, and office sake,
because he is her husband. Doubtless Sarah had in her heart a reverend respect
and honorable esteem of her husband, when Genesis 18. 12.
being alone, and thinking of him in her very thought she gave him this title
Lord. This inward reverence the Scripture compriseth under this word Fear: as
where our Apostle says, Ephesians. 5. 33. (...).
Let the wife see that she fear her husband: and where 1 Pet. 3. 2. (...).
S. Peter exhorts wives to have their conversation in Fear. It is no slavish
fear of her husband which ought to possess the heart of a wife, dreading
blows, frowns, spightfull words, or the like; but such an awful respect of
him as makes her (to use the Apostles word) 1 Cor. 7. 34.
care how she may please him. This wiue-like Fear is manifested by two
effects: one is Joy, when she gives contentment to her husband, and observes
him to be pleased with that which she does: the other is grief, when he is
justly offended and grieved, especially with any thing that she her self has
done.

Unless this inward reverence and due respect of an husband True fear a
ground of other duties.
be first placed in the heart of a wife, either no outward reverence and
obedience will be performed at all, or if it be performed, it will be very
unsound, only in show, hypocritical and deceitful: so that as good never a
whit as never the better. For according to ones inward affection and
disposition will the outward action and conversation be framed. 2 Samuel 6. 16.
Michal first despised David in her heart, and thence it followed that she

vtteredmost irreverent and vile speeches of him, even to his face. Wherefore
after the judgment of a wife is rightly informed of an husbands superiority,
and her will persuaded to account her own husband her head and guide, it is
very needful that her heart and affection be accordingly seasoned with the
salt of good respect, and high esteem, which breeds fear: and that thus her
heart may be seasoned, she ought often and seriously to meditate of his place and
office, and of that honor which the Lord by virtue thereof has planted in
him. And if he have gifts worthy his place, as knowledge, wisdom, piety,
temperance, love, and the like, she ought to take notice thereof, and to think
him worthy of double honor.

. 8. Of a wives base esteem of her husband.
Contrary to this inward reverence of the heart is a base and wile esteem
which many have of their husbands, thinking no better of them then of other
men; nay worse then of others; despising their husbands in their heart, like
Michal, of whom we heard before. This, as it is in it self a vile vice, so is
^t a cause of many other vices, as of presumption, rebellion, A base esteem
which wives have of their husbands, arises
yea and of adultery it self many times: and it is also a maine hinderance of
all duty.

It commonly rises either from self-conceit (whereby wives ouerweene their
own gifts, thinking them so excellent 1. From selfeconceit.
is they need no guide or head, but are rather fit to guide and rule both their
husband and all the household: of which proud and presumptuous spirit Iezabel
seems to be, who with an audacious and impudent face said to Ahab her
husband, 1 King. 21. 7.
Do thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? Up, I will give thee the
vineyard of Naboth. So also all those wives which are noted to draw away their
husbands hearts from the Lord, as the wives of 1 King. 11. 4.
Solomon, 2 King. 8. 18.
Iehoram, and others: which they learned of their great grandmother Genesis 3. 6.
Euah:) or else from some infirmities of mind or body, or of life, which they
behold in their 2. From their husbands infirmities.
husbands (whence it comes to pass, that many husbands who are highly
honored and greatly accounted of by others, are much despised by their wives,
because their wives always conuersing with them are privy to such infirmities
as are concealed from others:) or, which is worst of all, from unjust surmizes

and suspicions, suspecting many evil things of their husbands whereof they
are no way guilty, and misinterpreting, and perverting things well done, as 2 Samuel 6. 20.
Michal perverted David's holy zeal.

For redress of this enormous vice, wives ought first in regard How wives may
redress a light esteem of their husbands.
of themselves to purge out of their hearts pride, and self-conceit, thinking
humbly and lowly of themselves, and that even in regard of their sex and the
weakness thereof: and if the Lord have endued them with any gift above the
ordinary sort of women, to note well their own infirmities, and to lay them by
their eminent gifts: thus by looking on their black feet, their
proud-peacock-feathers may be cast down. Yea also when they behold any
infirmities in their husbands, they ought to reflect their eyes on their own
infirmities, which it may be are even as many and as grievous, if not more in
number, and more heinous in their nature and kind: at least let them consider
that they are subject to the same, if God leave them to the sway of their own
corruption.

Secondly, wives ought in regard of their husbands to surmize no evil whereof
they have not sure proof and evidence: but rather interpret every thing in
better part: and follow the rule of love, 1 Cor. 13. 7.
which bears all things, believes all things, hops all things, endures
all things. If they note any defects of nature, and deformity of body, or any
enormous and notorious vices in their husband, then ought they to turn their
eyes and thoughts from his person to his place, and from his vicious qualities
to his honorable office (which is to be an husband) and this will abate that
vile esteem which otherwise might be occasioned from the forenamed means.

. 9. Of Treat. 4.. 4.
wiue-like sobriety.
A wives outward reverence toward her husband is a manifestation of her inward
due respect of him. Now then seeing A wives outward reverence.
the intent of the heart, and inward disposition cannot be discerned by man
simply in it self, that the husband may know his wives good affection toward
him, it is behouefull that she manifest the same by her outward reverence.

A wives outward reverence consists in her reverend Gesture. Speech.

For the first, that a reverend gesture and carriage of her self to A wives
reverence in her gesture.
her husband, and in her husbands presence, beseems a wife, was of old
implied by the veil which the woman used to put on, when she was brought unto
her husband, as is noted in the Genesis 24. 65.
example of Rebekah: whereunto the Apostle alludeth in these words, 1 Cor. 11.
10.
the woman ought to have power on her head. That cover on the woman's head, as
in general it implied subjection, so in particular this kind of subjection,
viz. a reverend carriage and gesture. But most expressly is this duty set down
by 1 Pet. 3. 1. (...).
Saint Peter who exhorts wives to order their conversation before their
husbands, so as it be pure, with reverence.

This reverend conversation consists in a wiue-like sobriety, mildness,
courtesy, and modesty.

By sobriety I mean such a comely, grave, and gracious carriage, as gives
evidence to the husband that his wife respects his place and the authority
which God has given him. Sobriety in general is required of all women by
reason of their sex; and surely it does well become them all: but much more
does it become wives: most of all, in their husbands presence. 1 Timothy 3. 11.
The Apostle in particular enioyneth it to Deacons wives, yet not so as proper
unto them, but in a further respect appertaining to them not only as wives, but
as the wives of Deacons.

Contrary to this sobriety is lightness and wantonness: which vices in a
wife, especially before her husband, argues little respect, if not a plain
contempt of him.

Object. Thus shall all delightful familiarity betwixt husband and wife be
taken away.

Answ. Though the forenamed sobriety be opposed to lightness Difference
betwixt wantonness and familiarity.
and wantonness, yet not to matrimonial familiarity: which is so far
permitted to man and wife, as if any other man and woman should so behave
themselves one toward another as an husband and wife lawfully may, it might
justly be counted lightness and sin: instance the example of Isaak and
Rebekah, who so sported together, as Abimelech, Genesis 26. 8, 9.
knowing them to be such as feared God, gathered by that sporting that they
were man and wife: for he thought that otherwise they would not have been so
familiar together.

See Treat. 4.. 42.
This familiarity argues both liking and love: and shows that the man and
wife delight in one another person. But the lightness here condemned in a
wife, is not so much a mutual familiarity with her husband by his good liking,
as a wanton dallying with others to his grief and disgrace.

. 10. Of Treat. 4.. 13, 22.
wiue-like mildness.
Mildness in a wife has respect also to the ordering of her countenance,
gesture, and whole carriage before her husband, whereby she manifests a
pleasingnesse to him, and a contentedness and willingness to be under him and
ruled by him. Excellently is this set forth in the spouse of Christ whose eyes
are said to be as doves eyes, her lips to drop as honey combs, and Cant. 4. and
6. and 7.
she her self every way pleasant: whereupon it is noted that she appeared to
her husband as the bright morning, and that his heart was wounded with her.
Assuredly the clear sky is not more pleasant in time of harvest, then a mild
and amiable countenance and carriage of a wife in her husbands presence. Is cui
leonum cura commissa est, blanda manu, mollique verborum sono permulsos domat.
Greg. Naz. ad Olymp.
And though her husband should be of an harsh and cruel disposition, yet by
this means might he be made meek and gentle. For the keepers of Lions are said
to bring them to some tamenesse by handling them gently and speaking to them
fairly.

Contrary to this mildness is a frowning brow, a lowering eye, a sullen look,
a powting lip, a swelling face, a deriding mouth, a scornful cast of the
arms and hands, a disdainful turning of this side and that side of the body,
and a fretfull flinging out of her husbands presence: all which and other like
contemptuous gestures are as thick clouds ouerspreading the heavens in a
Summers day, which make it very uncomfortable. They often stir up much passion
in the man, and bring much mischief upon the wife her self.

. 11. Of Treat. 4.. 15.
wiue-like courtesy and obeisance.
Courtesy is that virtue whereby a wife takes occasion to testify her
acknowledgement of her husbands superiority by some outward obeisance to him.
Rebekah, so soon as she saw Isaak, whom she had taken for her husband, lighted
from her Camel and came to him on foot, which was a kind of obeisance. This
is not so to be taken as if no difference were to be made betwixt the carriage
of a servant, or child, and a wife: or as if a wife should bow at every word
that she speaks to her husband. Though in the kind and extent of many duties
the same things are required of wives which are required of children and
servants, because God has made them all inferiors, and exacted subjection of
all: yet in the manner and measure of many duties there is great difference: as
in this, the obeisance of children and servants ought to be more submissiue,
and more frequent. Yet because God has placed authority in the husband over
his wife, she is every way to testify her reverend respect of her husband, and
therefore at some times, on some occasions (as when he is going on a journey
for a time from her, or when he returns home again, or when she has a
solemn and great suit to make unto him, or when he offers an especial and
extraordinary favor unto her, or (as I have observed such wives as know what
beseems their place, and are not ashamed to manifest as much) when she
sits 1. A wiuelike courtesy works a good respect in her husband to her.
down or rises up from table) to declare her reverence by some obeisance.
This cannot but much work on the heart of a good and kind husband, and make
him the more to respect his wife, when he beholds this evidence of her
respect to him. Yea it cannot but be a good pattern to children 2. It makes
her husband be honored of others.
and servants, and a motive to stir them up to yield all submissiue obeisance
both to her husband and to her self. For it may make them thus to reason with
themselves, shall 3. It brings honor to her self.
we scorn or think much to yield that to our father or master which our
mother or mistress thinks not much to yield to her husband? shall-she bow to
him, and shall not we much more bow to her? Thus a wives honoring of her
husband by yielding obeisance to him, makes both him and her self to be more
honored of others.

Contrarily minded are they, who not only altogether omit Contrary scorn in
wives.
this duty, but also gibe and scoff at the very hearing thereof, saying, thus
wives shall be made no better then children or servants. But though scornful
dames deride these outward evidences of their subjection, yet such wives as
fear the Lord ought not to be hindered thereby from doing their duty: for by
such evil examples they might be discouraged from every good duty. It is
sufficient that such holy women as trusted in God so behaved themselves. But
for this particular, we know that equals scorn not upon occasions to perform
this kind of courtesy in making obeisance one to another: how much less
ought wives, who are their husbands inferiors?

wife-like modesty in apparel.
Modesty appertaining to a wife is much manifested in her apparel. S. Paul
requires this modesty in general of all sorts of women: but S. Peter
presses it in particular upon wives. For as it well beseems all women, so
wives after a peculiar manner, namely, in attiring themselves, to respect
rather their husbands place and state, then their own birth and parentage, but
much rather then their own mind and humor. A wives modesty therefore
requires that her apparel be neither for costlinesse above her husbands
ability, nor for curiousness un beseeming his calling. As a poor man's wife
must not affect costly apparel, so neither Ministers, grave Counselors, sage
Magistrates, no nor conscionable Professors wives, hunt after new fashions, or
in light and garish apparel attire themselves. It is a token of great
reverence in a wife toward her husband, to have an eye to his place and state
in her apparel.

On the contrary, such proud daines as must have their own will in their
attire, and think it nothing appertains Contrary wives attire not fitting
their husbands state or place.
to their husbands to order them therein, who care not what their husbands
ability, or what his place and calling be, they show little respect and
reverence to their husbands. Such are they, who are no whit moved with their
husbands example: but though the man's apparel be plain and grave, yet the
wives shall be costly and garish. Yea many there be that stand in some more awe
of their husbands sight, but show little more respect unto him, who have their
silken gowns, Beauer hats, and other like attire not agreeable to their place
and state, lie in the country, if they be of the city; or in the city, if
they be of the country, in a friends house where their husbands shall Quae se
pingit comitque secus quam viro gratum esse nouit, satis declarat sese pluribus
velle placcre quam oportet mulierem pudicam, cuius praecipua laus est vni
placuisse cui desponsata est. Erasm. Instit. Matr.
not know it, and when their husbands are not with them, wear them, and paint
their faces, lay out their hair, and in every thing follow the fashion. What
can they which behold this think, but that such a wives care is more to please
other light vain persons, then her grave, discreet husband: or that her
husband can nothing at all prevail with her: which as it staineth her own
credit, so it leaves a blot of dishonor even upon him. If the care of a wife
were to give evidence of the reverence which she bears to her husband, his
desire and example would in this respect more prevail with her, then the
humor of her own heart.

. 13. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 24.
reverend speech to her husband.
As by gesture, so by speech also, must a wives reverence be manifested: this
must be answerable to that. For by words as well as by deeds, the affection of
the heart is manifested, Matt. 12. 34.
Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A wives reverence is
manifested by her speech, both in her husbands presence, and also in his
absence. For this end in his presence her words must be few, reverend and
meek. First few: For the A wives words in her husbands presence must be few.
Apostle enioyneth 1 Timothy 2. 12.
silence to wives in their husbands presence, and inforceth that duty with a
strong reason in these words: I permit not the woman to usurp authority over
the man, but to be in silence: the inference of the latter clause upon the
former shows that he speaks not only of a woman's silence in the Church, but
also of a wives silence before her husband: which is further cleared by another
like place, where the same Apostle enioyneth wives to 1 Cor. 14. 35.
learn of their husbands at home. The reason before mentioned for silence, on
the one side implies a reverend subjection, as on the other side too much
speech implies an usurpation of authority.

Object. Then belike a wife must be always mute before her husband.

Answ. No such matter: for silence in that place is not opposed to speech, as
if she should not speak at all, but to loquacitie, to talkatiuenesse, to
overmuch tatling: her husbands presence must some what restrain her tongue,
and so will her very silence testify a reverend respect. Otherwise silence,
as it is opposed to speech, would imply stoutnesse of stomach, and
stubbornness of heart, which is an extreme contrary to loquacitie. But the
mean betwixt both, is for a wife to be sparing in speech, to expect a fit time
and just occasion of speech, to be willing to hearken to the word of knowledge
coming out of her husbands mouth. This argues reverence. Job 32. 6.
Elihu manifested thereuerend respect, which as a younger he bare to his
elders, by for bearing to speak while they had any thing to say. How much more
ought wives in regard both of their sex and of their place?

Contrary is their practice, who must and will have all the Contrary too much
prate.
prate. If their husbands have begun to speak, their slipperie tongues cannot
expect and tarry till he have done: if (as very hastile and forward they are
to speak) they prevent not their husbands, they will surely take the tale out
of his mouth before he have done: Thus-they disgrace themselves, and dishonor
their husbands.

. 14. Of the Treat. 4.. 24.
titles which wives give their husbands.
As their words must be few, so those few words must be reverend and meek:
both which are also implied under the forenamed word 1 Timothy 2. 12. (...).
silence: which in the original signifies also 1 Timothy 2. 12. (...).
quietness.

Reverence has respect to the titles whereby a wife names her husband.
Meekness to the manner of framing her speech to him. Reverend titles to be
given to husbands.


For the titles which a wife in speaking to her husband, or naming him, gives
unto him, they must be such as signify superiority, and so savor of
reverence. Such are the titles wherewith husbands are named in the Scripture;
See. 3.
they are titles of honor. Such also are the titles which the Church (who by
our Apostle is made a pattern for wives in all subjection) gives to her
Spouse Christ Jesus, as may be gathered out of the Song of songs. It is likely
that Sarah did usually give this title Lord to her husband. For having occasion
to think of him, presently this title Genesis 18. 12.
Lord was in her heart: which would not so suddenly have risen up, if she had
not ordinarily used it. According to the usual titles which we give to any,
do we in our hearts name them, when we have occasion to think of them. Among
all other titles the name husband, as it is the most usual, so it is the
fittest and meetest title. It intimates reverence, and sauoureth not of
niceness and singularity, as these titles, Head, Guide, Master, Man, and the
like do: which though they be lawful titles, because the Scripture
attributes them to husbands, and they signify superiority, yet because they
are unusual and savor of singularity, they are not so meet. Common use and
practice has made the addition of the husbands surname to this title Master,
more meet.

1 Pet. 3. 6.
Saint Peter by this argument proves that Sarah obeyed Abraham, because she
called him Lord.

Contrary are those compellations which argue equality or inferioritie rather
then superiority, as Brother, Cosen, Friend, Man, etc. if a stranger be in
presence, how can he tell by this manner of compellation, that he whom thou
speak unto is thy husband? If he epsy any matrimonial familiarity betwixt
you, what can he judge of it otherwise to be, lightness and wantonness?
Remember the fearful issue that had like to have fallen out by reason of such
compellations given by Genesis 12. 19. and 20. 2.
Sarah and and 26. 9.
Rebekah to their husbands. Not unlike to those are such as these, Sweet,
Sweeting, Heart, Sweetheart, Love, Joy, Dear, etc. and such as these, Ducke,
Chicke, Pigsnie, etc. and husbands Christian names, as John, Thomas, William,
Henry, etc. which if they be contracted (as many use to contract them thus,
Iack^, Tom, Will, Hall) they are much more unseemly: servants are usually so
called.

But what may we say of those titles given to an husband by his wife, not
seldom in passion, but usually in ordinary speech, which are not fit to be
given to the basest men that be, as Grub, Rogue, and the like, which I am even
ashamed to name, but that the sins of women are to be cast as dirt on their
faces, that they may be the more ashamed?

Object. Many of the forenamed titles are titles of amity and familiarity.
Answ. Subjection is that mark which wives are directed to aim at in their
thoughts, words, deeds, and whole conversation toward their husband. Such
tokens of familiarity as are not withal tokens of subjection and reverence,
are unbeseeming a wife, because they swerue from that mark.

. 15. Of wives Treat. 4.. 24. etc.
meekness in their speeches.
Meekness in a wives manner of framing her speech to her husband, does also
commend her reverend respect of him. This is an especial effect of that meek
and quiet spirit which S. Peter requires of wives; which duty he does
strongly enforce by this weighty argument, 1 Pet. 3. 4.
which is before God a thing much set by. Is a wives meekness much set by
before God, and shall not wives hold it both a bounden duty, and comely
ornament, and grace unto them? As the form of words which a wife uses in
asking or answering questions, or any other kind of discourse which she
holds with her husband, so her moderation in persisting, arguing and pressing
matters, yea and the mild composition of her countenance in speaking, declare
her meekness. If she be desirous to obtain any thing of him, fairly she must
entreat it, as the 2 King. 4. 10. 22.
Shunemite: If she would move him to perform a bounden duty, mildly she must
persuade him. If she would restrain and keep him from doing that which is
evil, even that also she must do with some meekness, as Matt. 27. 19.
Pilats wife: If she have occasion to tell him of a fault, therein she ought to
manifest humility and reverence, by observing a fit season, and doing it after
a gentle manner as 2 Samuel 25. 31, 37.
Abigail: who as she wisely behaved her self in this respect with her husband
in observing a fit season, so also with David by intimating his fault unto him,
rather then plainly reproving him, when she said, It shall be no grief nor
offense unto my Lord, that he has not shed blood causeless. This meekness
requires also silence and patience, even when she is reproved.

Contrary is the waspish and shrewish disposition of many Contrary wives
shrewish speeches to their husbands.
wives to their husbands, who care not how hastily and unadvisedly they speak
to them, like Genesis 30. 1.
Rahel; nor how angerly and chidingly, like 1 King. 21. 7.
Iezabel; nor how disdainfully, and spightfully, like Exo. 4. 25, 26.
Zipporah; nor how scoffingly, and frumpingly, like 2 Samuel 6. 20.
Michal; nor how reproachfully and disgracefully, like Job 2. 9.
Jobs wife. If they be reproved by their husbands, their husbands shall be
reproached by them: and they are ready to answer again, not only word for word,
but ten for one. Many wives by their shrewish speeches, show no more respect to
their husbands, then to their servants, if so much. The least occasion moves
them not only inwardly to be angry and fret against them, but also outwardly to
manifest the same by chiding and brawling. The very object whereupon many wives
usually spit out their venomous words, is their husband; when their stomachs
are full, they must needs ease them on their husbands: wherein their fault is
doubled.

Let wives therefore learn first to moderate their passion, and then to keep
in their tongues with bit and bridle, but most of all to take heed that their
husbands taste not of the bitterness thereof, no not though they should by
some oversight of their husbands be provoked. It is to be noted how Solomon
calls the iarres which are between man and wife, the contentions of a wife,
whereby he intimates that she commonly Prou. 19. 13.
is the cause thereof, either by provoking her husband, or not bearing with him.

. 16. Of a wives speech of her husband Treat. 2. Part. 2.. 36.
in his absence.
The reverence which a wife bears to her husband, must further be manifested
by her speeches of him in his absence. So did Sarah manifest her reverence, and
so must all such as desire Genesis 18. 12.
to be accounted the daughters of Sarah. The Church speaking of her Spouse,
does it with as great reverence, as if she Cant 5. 10. etc.
had spoken to him. It was for honor and reverence sake, that the Virgin Mary
called Joseph the Father of Jesus, when she Luke 2. 48.
spoke of him.

This shows that a wives reverend speeches in presence of her husband and to
his face, are not in flattery to please him and fawn upon him, but in
sincerity to please God and perform her duty.

Contrary therefore to their duty deal they, who in presence Contrary wives

can afford the fairest and meek est speeches that may be to their husbands
face, but See more hereof Treat 2. part 2.. 36.
behind their backs speak most reproachfully of them.

. 17. Of a wives obedience in general.
Hitherto of a wives reverence, it follows to speak of her obedience: The
first law that ever was given to woman since her fall, laid upon her this duty
of Obedience to her husband, in these words, Genesis 3. 16.
Thy desire shall be to thine husband, and he shall rule over thee. How can an
husband rule over a wife, if she obey not him? The principal part of that
submission which in this Ephesians. 5. 22.
text, and in many other places is required of a wife, consists in obedience:
and therefore it is expressly commended unto wives in the example of Sarah who 1
Pet. 3. 6. (...).
obeyed Abraham. Thus by Obedience does the Church manifest her subjection to
Christ.

The place wherein God has set an husband; namely, to be an Ephesians. 5. 23.
head; the authority which he has given unto him, to be a 1 Pet. 3. 6.
Lord and Ester 1. 17.
Master; the duty which he requires of him Genesis 3. 16.
to rule, do all require obedience of a wife. Is not obedience to be yielded
to an Head, Lord, and Master? Take away all authority from an husband, if ye
exempt a wife from obedience.

Contrary is the stoutnesse of such wives as must have their Contrary to

own will, and do what they list, or else all shall be out of quiet. Their
will must be done, they must rule and overrule all, they must command not only
children and servants, but husbands also, if at least the husband will be at
peace. Look into families, observe the estate and condition of many of them,
and then tell me if these things be not so. If an husband be a man of courage,
and seek to stand upon his right, and maintain his authority by requiring
obedience of his wife, strange it is to behold what an hurly burly she will
make in the house: but if he be a milke-sop, and basely yield unto his wife,
and suffer her to rule, then, it may be, there shall be some outward quiet. The
ground hereof is an ambitious and proud humor in women, who must needs rule,
or else they think themselves slaves. But let them think as they list:
assuredly herein they thwart Gods ordinance, pervert the order of nature,
deface the image of Christ, overthrow the ground of all duty, hinder the good
of the family, become an ill pattern to children and servants, lay themselves
open to Satan, and incur many other mischiefs which cannot but follow upon
the violating of this maine duty of Obedience, which if it be not performed,
how can other duties be expected?

. 18. Of the cases wherein a wife has power to order things of the house
without her husbands consent.
A wives obedience requires Submission. Contentment.

Submission in yielding to her husbands mind and will.

See. 49.
Contentment in resting satisfied and content with his estate and ability.

That Submission consists in two things.

First, in abstaining from doing things against her husbands mind.

Secondly, in doing what her husband requires. The former of these requires
that a wife have her husbands consent for the things which she does. For the
better clearing whereof we are to consider,

1. What kind of husbands they must be whose consent is required.

2. How many ways his consent may be given.

3. What are the things whereabout his consent is to be expected.

For the first, as on the one side it often falls out that a wife, In two cases
a wife has power to order things of her self, without her husbands consent.
provident, and religious man is married to a foolish woman, a very idiot, that
has no understanding, of whom there can be no question, but that such a wife
is to do nothing of her self, and of her own head, but altogether to be
ordered by her husband: So on the other side, it often falls out that a wise,
virtuous, and gracious woman, is married to an husband destitute 1 In case of
her husbands impotency.
of understanding, to a very natural (as we say) or a ^renzy man, or to one
made very blockish, and stupid, unfit to manage his affairs through some
distemper, wound, or sicknesle. In such a case the whole government lies upon
the wife, so as her husbands consent is not to be expected.

Quest. What if the husband be a wicked and profane man, and so blinded and
stupefied in his soul, does not this spiritual blindness and blockishnese
give a religious wife as great liberty as natural stupiditie?

Answ. No verily: For S. Peter exhorts faithful wives 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2.
that were married to Infidel husbands to be subject to them, and that in fear.

The reason is clear: For spiritual blindness disableth not from civil
government: indeed nothing that such a man does is acceptable to God, or
auailable to his own salvation; but yet it may be profitable to man: a wicked
man may be provident enough for wife, children, and whole family in outward
temporal things.

Again, it often falls out, that an husband is a long time In case of
impossibility for her husband to do it.
far off absent from the house: sometimes by reason of his calling, as an
Ambassador, Soldier, or Mariner; sometimes also carelessly or wilfully
neglecting house, goods, wife, children and all: and in his absence has left
no order for the ordering of things at home: in this case also there is no
question, but that the wife has power to dispose matters without her husbands
consent: provided that she observe those rules of Gods word concerning justice,
equity, truth and mercy, which an husband in his disposing of them ought to
observe.

The first of these cases declares an impotencie in the husband: the other an
impossibility for him to order matters: wherefore the wife being next to the
husband, the power of ordering things is diuolued on her: she is not bound to
have his consent.

. 19. Of diverse kinds of consent.
II. A consent may be general or particular. A general 1. A general consent.
consent is given, when without distinct respect to this or that particular,
liberty is granted to a wife by her husband to do all things as seems good
in her own eyes. Prou. 31. 10, etc.
That excellent good wife, and notable good house-wife that is set forth by the
Wiseman, had such a consent. For first, it is said, Verse. 11.
The heart of her husband trusts in her; and then it is inferred, that she
orders all the things of the house, whereof many particulars are there
specified. Whence I gather, that her husband observing her to be a godly, wise,
faithful, and industrious woman, gave her power and liberty to do in the
household affairs, what she thought good, (he being a public magistrate, for
Verse. 23.
he was known in the gates, sitting among the Elders of the land) and
accordingly she used her liberty.

A particular consent is that which is given to one or more particular 2. A
particular consent.
things, as that consent Genesis 16. 6.
which Abraham gave to Sarah about Hagar; and 1 Samuel 1. 23.
that which Elkanah gave to Hanna about tarrying at home till her child was
weined.

This particular consent may be expressed or implied. An expressed consent is
when the husband manifests his good liking by word, writing, message, or
sign, and that whether his consent be asked (as was noted in the example of
Elkanah) or freely offered.

An implicit consent, when by any probable conjecture it may be gathered that
the husbands will is not against such a thing, 4. An implicit consent,
though he have not manifested his mind concerning that very particular. This
implicit consent may be gathered either by his silence when he is present to
see a thing done, or otherwise has knowledge thereof: or else when he is
absent, by his former carriage or disposition in other like cases. The Scripture
accounts an husbands silence, when he knows a thing and may, but does not
forbid it, to be a consent: as Number 30. 8.
in the case of a wives vow. For any thing we read to the contrary 2 King. 4.
10, 23.
the Shunemite had no other consent to prepare a chamber for the Prophet, and
to go unto him, then her husbands silence, and not forbidding it when he knew
it.

As for the other kind of implicit consent, it may be set forth in this
following instance: suppose a good wife has an husband whom she knows by his
former carriage and disposition to be a pitiful and charitable man, taking all
occasions to show mercy, and in his absence there falls out a fit and
needful occasion of showing mercy; if she take that occasion to show mercy,
she has an implicit consent, for she may well think that if her husband knew
it he would approve what she does. It is to be supposed that 1 Samuel 1. 11.
Annah upon some such ground vowed her child to God. For it is not likely that
she who would not tarry at home to weine her child without her husbands
consent, would much less vow him to the Lord (which was a far greater
matter) without some persuasion of her husbands good liking thereof. Now that a
wife may show she deals uprightly in this case upon a true persuasion of her
heart concerning her husbands mind, she ought (when conveniently she can) to
make known to her husband what she has done: as without all question Annah
did; and so much may be gathered out of these words which Elkanah uttered to
Annah, 1 Samuel 1. 23.
the Lord establish his word.

. 20. Of the things whereabout a wife must have her husbands consent.
The things whereabout an husbands consent is to be expected, are such as he by
virtue of his place and authority has power to order: as for example,
ordering and disposing the goods, cattle, servants, and children of the
family, entertaining strangers; yea, also ordering even his wives going abroad,
and making of vows, with the like: now then distinctly to lay down a wives
duty in this first branch of obedience, it is this:

A wife must do nothing which appertains to her husband authority simply
without, or directly against his consent. Do not these words of that old law
(thy desire shall be to thy husband) Genesis 3. 16.
imply as much? I deny not but that there may be sundry things proper and
peculiar to a wife, wherein I will not restrain her liberty: and therefore I
use this phrase (which appertains to her husbands authority.) And I grant
the forenamed general and implicit consent, to be a true consent, so as there
needs not an express particular consent for every thing, and therefore I
have added these clauses (simply without, or directly against consent.)

That is done simply without consent which is done without all warrant from the
husband, and that so covertly as she is afraid it should come to his notice,
imagining he would by no means like it: As Rahels taking her fathers idols
without all Genesis 31. 32.
consent of Iaakob.

That is done directly against consent which is expressly forbidden and
disclaimed by the husband.

But to descend to the particulars before mentioned: First concerning the goods
of the family: It is a question controuerted whether the wife have power to
dispose them without or against the husbands consent.

Before I determine the question, I think it needful to declare, 1. What
goods, 2. What occasion of giving the question is about.

. 21. Of the things which a wife may dispose without her husbands consent.
1. For the goods, some are proper and peculiar to the wife: Quaedam bona sunt
propria vxoris, vt sunt bona paraphernalia. Greg. Sayr. Clau. reg. l. 9. c. 16.
others are common. Goods proper to the wife are such as before marriage she her
self, or her friends except from the husband to her sole and proper use and
disposing, whereunto he also yields: or such as after marriage he gives unto
her to dispose as she please: suppose it be some rent, annuity, fees, ^ailes,
or the like.

These kinds of goods are exempted out of the question (...) bona apud
iurisconsultos, dicuntur (...) (i.) quae sponsa praeter dotem a parentibus
pactam secum fert: vel (vt Sayrus loc. citat.) habet legata ei, seu donata.
in hand; the wife has liberty to dispose them as she please without any
further consent then she had by virtue of her hausbands former grant.

To these I may refer other goods, but of another nature, namely such as some
friend of hers, suppose father, mother, brother, or any other, observing her
husband to be a very ^ard man, not allowing sufficient for her self, much
less to distribute on charitable uses, shall give unto her to dispose as ^e
please, charging her not to let her husband know thereof. How because it is in
the power of a free doner to order his ^ift as he please, and because he so
orders this gift as he will not have her husband know of it, I doubt not but
she may of her self according to the doners mind without her husbands
consent, dispose such goods. She is herein but as a ^offee in trust.

Again of common goods some are set forth by the husband to be spent about the
family, other he reserueth for a ^ocke, or to lay forth as he himself shall
see occasion.

Concerning those which are set forth to be spent, I doubt ^ot but the wife
has power to dispose them; neither is she ^ound to ask any further consent of
her husband. For it is the wives place and duty to guide or govern the house,
1 Timothy 5. 14. (...).
by virtue whereof, providing sufficiently for the family, she may, as she
sees good occasion, of such goods as are set apart to be spent, distribute to
poor, or otherwise.

This I have noted for such tender consciences as think they cannot give a bit
of bread, or scarp of meat to a poor body, or make a mess of broth or caudle
for a sick body, except they first ask their husbands consent.

Provided that if her husband expressly forbid this liberty, she take it not
except necessity require it.

But our question is concerning such goods as the husband has not set apart,
but reserved to his own disposing.

. 22. Of a wives liberty in extraordinary matters.
II. For the occasion of disposing goods it may be ordinary or extraordinary.
Extraordinary for the good of the husband himself, and others in the family,
or such as are out of the family. If there fall out an extraordinary occasion
whereby the wife by disposing the goods without or against the consent of her
husband may bring a great good to the family, or prevent and keep a great
mischief from it, she is not to stay for his consent; instance the example of
1 Samuel 25. 18. etc.
Abigail. Thus a faithful provident wife observing her husband to riot, and to
spend all he can get in carding, dicing, and drinking, may without his consent
lay up what goods she can for her husbands, her own, her childrens, and whole
households good. This is no part of disobedience, but a point wherein she may
show her self a great good help unto her husband; Genesis 2. 18.
for which end a wife was first made.

Concerning such as are out of the family, if they be in great need, and
require present relief, though the wife know her husband to be so
hard-hearted, as he will not suffer her to relieve such an one, yet without his
consent she may relieve him. The ground of this and other like cases is that
rule laid down by the Prophets, and by Christ himself, viz. Ose. 6. 6. Mat 9.
13. and 12. 7.
I will have mercy and not sacrifice. If God in case of mercy dispenses with
a duty due to himself, will he not much more dispense with a duty due to an
husband?

. 23. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 54.
restraint in disposing goods without consent of her husband: and of the ground
of that restraint.
Out of all these things thus premised I gather the true state Non potest vxor
ex bonis communibus occulte accipere ad donandum vel ad erogandum in alios vsus
sine expressa, aut praesumpta saltem viri licentia. Gre^. Sayr. loc. citat.
of the question in controversy concerning the power of wives in disposing the
goods of the family to be this,

Whether a wife may privily and simply without, or openly and directly against
her husbands consent distribute such common goods of the family as her husband
reserueth to his own disposing, there being no extraordinary necessity?

The most ancient and common answer unto this question has been negative,
namely, that a wife has not power so to do: whereunto I for my part subscribe.

The ground of this answer is taken from that primary law of the wives
subjection, Genesis 3. 16.
Thy desire shall be unto thine husband. How is her desire subject to her
husband, if in the case propounded she stand not upon his consent? It is
further confirmed both by the. 17.
forenamed, and also by all other proofs that might be produced out of the
Scripture concerning the subjection of wives unto their husbands. If in
ordering the goods of the family she yield not subjection, wherein shall she
yield it?

Against this groundwork some object that Genesis 4. 7.
the same law of subjection is imposed upon a younger brother in the very same
words, and yet a younger brother was not thereby bound How the law of subjection
is applied to younger brothers.
to have his elder brothers consent in disposing his goods.

Answ. The law of the regality (as I may so speak) and preheminency of the
first borne was under those words ordained: and therefore a younger brother was
made a subject to his elder, while he remained in the family, as a son to the
father. The elder brother was as a lord over his other brothers: whereupon when
Isaak conferred the right of the first borne upon Iaakob (thinking he had been
his eldest son Esau) he used these words, Be lord over thy brethren, and let
thy Genesis 27. 29.
mothers sons bow down to thee. Which being so, questionless the younger
brother might not simply without or directly against the elder brothers consent
dispose the goods of the family: so as this objection more strongly
establishes the forenamed argument.

Again it is objected that that old law is to be expounded of weighty matters.

Answ. The Apostle who was guided by the spirit of the Ephesians. 5. 24.
lawmakers, extends that law to every thing: But is not this matter of
disposing goods a weighty matter? The consequences which I shall by and by note
to follow hereupon will show it to be a matter of moment.

As another reason may be alleged the Shunemites pattern who asked her
husbands consent before she prepared the things that were thought meet for the
Prophets entertainment: and before she used the things which were meet for her
journey.

Object. It is indeed commendable for wives to seek their husbands consent as
she did, but where such consent cannot be had, it is not necessary.
Answ. This example being grounded upon a law (as we showed. 23.
before) it does not only declare what may be done, but also what ought to be
done. And if a wife be bound to have her husbands consent for doing of a thing,
by consequence it follows that she is bound from doing it, without her
husbands consent.

2. Answ. They that except against this reason taken from example, use
themselves the like reason in other points, as the examples of Abigail, Ioanna,
and Susanna for the contrary.

2. Object. In the Shunemites example there was more then a merciful relief
of the Prophet, namely bringing him into the house to diet and to lodge,
wherein the husband must have a chief stroke.

Answ. The word of God makes not that difference betwixt releeuing and
entertaining: it extends a wives subjection to every thing: wherefore the
husband has a chief stroke as well in the one, as in the other.

. 25. Of the law of a wives vow.
A third reason is taken from the law of a wives vow: whereby Number. 30. 7. etc.
in general is implied, that a wife might not make a vow without her husbands
consent: whence it follows as an argument taken from the greater to the
less, that she may not dispose the goods without his consent. Yea, Verse. 13.
the Law further expressly says, that though she has vowed, yet her husband
has power to disanull her vow. Note here, how the Lord will rather depart from
his own right (as I may so speak) then have that order which he has
appointed betwixt man and woman broken. The Lords right, was to have what was
vowed to him performed: the order which he appointed, was to have the wife
subject to her husband: rather then the wife should do that which the husband
would not have done, the Lord remitted a wives vow in case her husband would
not consent to have it performed. Now then I demand, is the disposing of goods
a greater matter then the performing of a vow? or has a wife in these days
more liberty then in former? if she have, by what law? was there ever under
the Law a straiter charge laid upon wives then this, Let wives be subject to
their husbands in every thing.

Object. That point of a woman's subjection in performing her vow, is a
particular ruled case: but not this of disposing goods.
Answ. The Scripture by particular Laws and examples teaches directions for
other cases like to them: and arguments drawn by just and necessary
consequence, are counted as sound as express testimonies. Whereas it is said,
that this particular in question is not expressly decided, I take the reason
thereof to be this, that in former times they so well marked the extent of the
general law of a wives subjection, as they made no question of doing this or
other like things without their husbands consent. Neither did good wives take
that liberty, neither had they any patrons of such liberty.

2. Object. The case of a wives disposing goods is unlike to that of vows,
because vows are voluntary, but disposing goods, as a work of mercy, is
necessary.

Answ. Though it were a voluntary thing to make, or not to make a vow: yet a
vow being made, it was not in the power of the party that made it, not to
perform it: it was a Number. 30. 3. Deuteronomy. 23. 21. Eccles. 5. 4.
necessary duty to perform a vow, even expressly commanded. As for the
pretended work of mercy, I will. 34.
hereafter show, that a wife is not necessarily tied thereunto.

. 26. Of humane laws which restrain wives from disposing goods, without or
against their husbands consent.
A fourth is taken from the laws of men whereunto we are subject, and which we
must obey even for conscience sake, so far as they thwart not Gods Law, which
in this case they do not, as the reasons before gathered out of Gods word do
show.

Now our Law says, that 45. E. 3. Fitz. Couen. 18.
every gift, grant, or disposition of goods, lands, or other thing whatsoever
made by a woman 1. H. 5. 12. b. Perk. cap. de Grant. Not. Breu. fol. 120. G.
covert, and all and every obligation and feoffment made by her, and recovery
suffered, if they be done without her husbands consent, are void. Yea, Not.
Breu. fol. 188. H.
if she do wrong to another, she has not any thing to make satisfaction
during couerture: either her husband must do it, or by imprisonment of her
person must it be done. And Perk. fol. 2. a.
though she have inheritance of her own, yet can she not grant any annuitie
out of it during her couerture, without her husband: if any deed be made to
that purpose without his consent, or in her name alone, it is void in law. Yea,
Perk. fol. 2. b.
if there be debate between the husband and his wife, whereby certain lands
of the husbands be assigned to the wife with his consent, if out of such lands
she grant an annuitie to a stranger, the grant is void. And 27. H. 8. 27. p. 12.
if he covenant to give her yearly such and such apparel, she cannot dispose
it as she list without his consent, but only use and wear it her self. Perk.
fol. 3. a.
Neither can she lease her own land for years, for life, etc. if she do, it
is void, and the Lessee entering by force thereof, is a Disseisor to the
husband, and Trespassor. And 21. H. 7. 18. p. 29. Not. Breu. fol. 120 G.
if she sell any thing, the sale is void, except she be a merchant, where by
the custom she is enabled to merchandise. Finally, Ognels case, Coke Rep. 4. 3
^ 3. Deu. 12.
she cannot make executors without the consent of her husband, nor a devise, or
will. Plowd. Com 344. a. Bret and Rigdons case.
If she make a will, and thereby devise her own inheritance, and her husband
die, and she after die without any new publication of it, it is of no force,
because it was void at first. These and many other like cases which might be
alleged evidently show that by law a wife has not power of her self, without
her husband, to dispose the common goods of the family.

. 27. Of the inconveniences which may follow upon a wives disposing goods
without or against her husbands consent.
A fit reason may be taken from the mischiefs which would 1. A man's estate may
be wasted before he can tell how to redress it.
fall out if this liberty were given unto women: which are these that follow:

1. The estate of the family might be wasted before any redress could be
thought of: for if the wife may dispose the goods without her husbands consent,
it must also be granted without his knowledge: for it is to be supposed that if
he knew of the disposing of that which he likes not, he would hinder it: if
without his knowledge, then may that which he thinks to be remaining as a
stock for the family, be laid out by the wife, and nothing left: whereas if he
knew of the spending of that stock, it might be he would be more thrifty and
sparing in other expenses.

Object. This liberty is not granted to wives beyond their husbands ability.
Answ. Wives cannot always know their husbands ability: for their husbands may
be much indebted, and yet to maintain his credit, whereby he hops to raise
his estate, may allow liberal maintenance for his house, if thereupon his wife
shall gather that he is very rich, and accordingly be very bountiful in her
gifts, she may soon go beyond his ability, and so increase his debt, as he
shall never be able to recover himself.

2. Persons of contrary religions and dispositions being 2. Professors of
contrary religions may be sustained by the goods of the same family.
out of the family, might be maintained by the goods of the same family: for if
the husband were of one religion, and the wife of another, he without her
knowledge might maintain those of his religion, and she without his knowledge
might maintain them of her religion.

Object. This liberty of disposing goods given to the wife is limited within
the bounds of the household of faith.
Answ. If Divines grant them this liberty, they will themselves judge and
determine who be of the household of faith: Popish wives will say (say we what
we can to the contrary) that Jesuits, Priests, and Friars, are of the household
of faith, principal members thereof.

3. Many iarres and contentions would thence arise betwixt 3. Iars would arise
betwixt man and wife.
husband and wife: for if a wife shall persist to do that which her husband
will not consent unto, assuredly one of a thousand will not well brook it, but
will rather seek all the ways he can to cross her; thinking himself
despised, if she, whether he will or no, have her mind.

Object. Wives must use this liberty with all due respect unto their husbands
authority.
Answ. If the husband peremptorily stand upon his authority, and by all the
fair means that can be used, will not yield this liberty, I know not what
better respect she can show to this authority, then to forbear and abstain
from doing that which otherwise she would most gladly do: But if when it
comes to the uttermost point, and she shall say it is her right, and if she
cannot have his consent, she will do it without his consent, she therein
shows no great respect.

Many other inconveniences might be reckoned up, but I will not longer insist
on them, only from these let it be well considered, whether it were not better
for a family, that the husband should be bard from disposing the goods without
consent of his wife (so as there might be according to the proverb, but Though
she had a propriety, yet has she not thereupon liberty to dispose the goods.
one hand in the purse) then both husband and wife to have liberty to dispose
them without each others consent.

. 28. Of property in goods, whether it give liberty to dispose them as a wife
will.
To justify a wives liberty in disposing the common goods Licet vxor
proprietatem habeat, administrationem tamen, and vsum. fructu^ bonorum viuente
marito non habet. Greg. Sayr. clau. reg. lib. 9. cap. 16.
of the family without her husbands consent, it is said, that she has a true
right and property in those goods.

1. Answ. Though it were granted that a wife has a true property in the goods,
yet this conclusion would not follow thereupon, that she has power of her
self to dispose the goods without her husbands consent: for the authority
which God has given an husband, and subjection which he has laid on a wife,
restrain her power and liberty in that which is her own: as for example,
suppose See Doctr. and stud. fol. 13.
that a woman at the time of her marriage have a lease for years, or the
wardship of the body and lands of an infant, or have it by gift or Perk. plito.
560. 26. H. 8. 7. p. 1. Plowd. comment. 418. b.
purchase after marriage, she cannot give it away whatsoever the extremity be:
but her husband may any time during couerture, dispose of it: and such his
disposition shall cut off the wives interest. Or suppose that the only child
of her father be an inheretrix of land, and have in her self (her father being
dead) the full possession thereof: or that a widow have the right unto, and
possession of her husbands estate, and thus possessed be married to an husband,
has she being a wife liberty to dispose that estate which she brought with her
without or against her husbands consent? I think none will say it. Sure I am
that what she gives, lends, sells, or otherwise disposes without his
consent, he if he will, may for his lifetime recover again: and yet no man
will deny but that she has the truest interest and property in the forenamed
lands and inheritance.

Object. May she not as well dispose of her own inheritance, as of those
goods, or revenues which her husband gives her?

Answ. No, for the gift of the husband is a general consent of his for her to
dispose that which is given her as she sees meet.

. 29. Of the reasons against a wives property in the common goods of the
family.
2. Answ. It may safely be denied that a wife has a property in the common
goods of the family whereof she is no heir, for property in goods is a civil
matter, and to be limited according to the law of man under which we live.
Where the law, or custom of the place, make all the children coheires, all
have an equal right to their several parts: where the eldest only is made
heir, he has a right to all: where the youngest only is made heir, he has a
right to all: but neither the law of nations, nor of the land where we live
give the wife a property. 12. H. 7. 22. Coke rep. 5. fo. 36. 28. H. 6. Dier
fol. 6. plito. 5 Doct. and stud. fo. 13. Plowd. Comment. Bracebriges Case.
By the common law marriage is a gift of all the goods and chattels personal of
the wife to her husband, so that no kind of property in the same remains in
her. 4. H. 6. 31.
And all personal goods and chattels during marriage given to the wife are
presently ipso facto transferred (as to the property of them) to the husband.
So that by our law she is so far from gaining any property by her marriage in
her husbands goods, as she loses all the property she formerly had in her own
goods. Yea 18. E. 4. 11. p. 4
her necessary apparel is not hers in property. While she remains a wife she
is (to use the law-phrase) under covert baron. See. 26.
She can neither let, sell, alien, give, nor otherwise of right make any thing
away, no nor yet make a will so to dispose any goods while her husband lives
without his consent: which yet an husband may while his wife lives, and that
without or against her consent.

Object. The law states a wife in a great part of the husbands goods, providing
for her iointer or thirds which the husband cannot make away without her
consent.

Answ. This provision is only for the time of her widowhood in case she
ouerliue him: but for the time that she remains his wife he may make away
all, and she can recover none, till he be dead.

Object. This restraint of wives is only in the court of men.
Answ. Seeing it is not against the law of God, it must also hold good in the
court of Conscience. Nay it is agreeable to the law of God and grounded
thereupon.

For (to omit the proofs before alleged) what might be the reason that the
daughters of Zelophehad, who were heirs to their father, were forbidden to
mary out of their fathers tribe, and that a law was made that no daughters that
possessed any inheritance should mary out of their fathers tribe, but because
all that a woman had before marriage, passed upon the husband and became his by
virtue of marriage? This also for that purpose is by some not unfitly, nor
without probability noted, that it is the common phrase of Scripture to term
husbands Si quis abduxerit vxorem cum bonis familiae dicitur abducere vxorem
cum bonis viri. Fitzherb. Not. breutum fol. 89.
(but not wives) rich, implying thereby that riches by a property appertain to
husbands: yea usually in Scripture goods and lands are said to be the husbands.

Object. The wives of Iaakob do term the goods which their husbands had
theirs, saying, the riches which God has taken from our Father is OURS, Genesis
31. 16.

Answ. They use the word Ours in opposition to their fathers house, and in
relation not to their persons, but to their Ut vinum temperatum licet maiori ex
part aquae constat, vinum appellamus: sic census quamuis plus contribuerit
vxor, nuncupandus viri est. Plut. in praec. connub.
husbands family, and therefore they add and our childrens: So as by that
place no greater right can be proved for wives, then for children. When the
holy Ghost speaks of the same goods, he says not in relation to husband and
wives both, their flocks, their substance, but only in relation to the
husband, his flocks, his substance. For as in mixture of wine and water,
though the greater quantity be water, yet we call the whole, wine: so in the
common goods of the family, though the wife should bring the greater part, we
call all the husbands.

. 30. Of answers to the reasons for a wives property.
To prove a wives property in the common goods of the family the reasons
following are alleged.

1. Object. Marriage giving a wife right of her husbands body, Cor. 7. 4.
does much more of his goods.
Answ. I deny the consequence. For the use of the body is a proper act of the
matrimonial bond, wherein the difference betwixt superiority and subjection
appears not: the wife has as great a power over the husbands body as the
husband over the wives: which is not so in the goods: no one thing can be
named, wherein the power and authority of the husband more consists, then in
the goods.

2. Object. In the form of marriage the man says to his wife, with all my
worldly goods I thee indow.
Answ. 1. Those words are to be taken of the use of his goods, and not of a
property in them.

2. If an husband shall intend a property by them, that property which she has
thereby, she has not by virtue of the general law of marriage, but of his
particualar free donation.

3. In all countries those words are not used in the form of marriage. If those
words give the wife her property, then such wives as are married without those
words used, have no property: so as this cannot be a general ground of liberty
for all wives.

3. Object. A wife has as good an estate in her husbands goods as the Church
in Christ's blood: but there the Church has a property.

Answ. Neither of those points can be proved. But if a wives right in her
husbands goods be as the Churches in Christ's blood, what is gotten thereby? The
Church has not power without or against Christ's consent to dispose his blood:
The Church of Rome is counted a proud usurping strumpet for taking upon her so
to do.

. 31. Of the privileges of wives above Children and servants in and about the
goods of the family.
Quest. Where then is the preferment of the wife above servants and children,
if she have not a property?
I answer, Much every manner of way.

1. Treat. 4.. 52. 54.
There is due to her a more free and plentiful use of all the goods, then unto
them.

2. By her place she has the ordering and disposing of the goods allotted for
the common use of the family: as was. 21.
before granted.

3. Her husband ought to give her a portion to dispose as she shall see good,
Treat. 4.. 54.
as we shall after show, when we come to the husbands duties.

4. She is a joint governor with her husband over the children and servants,
as was showed. 4.
before.

Again I answer, that this argument might as well be alleged against that
fear, subjection, and obedience which the Scripture expressly requires of
wives, and it might be demanded, if wives must fear and obey their husbands
and be subject unto them, where is their preferment above their children and
servants. But. 11.
it has been showed that though the same things for matter be required of
wives which are required of children and servants, yet there is a great
difference in the manner of performing them.

. 32. Of examples and other reasons alleged for liberty of wives to dispose
goods.
2. Abigails example is alleged for a wives liberty: and 2. Reason.
Examples. 1 Samuel 25. 18. etc. Pro. 31. 11, etc.
the example of the good house wife described by Solomon.

Answ. 1. Abigails example was extraordinary; besides, who can tell whether the
heart of her husband so trusted not in her as he referred the whole government
of the house to her, and so she had a general consent for what she did.

2. It is clear that the other good-wife had her husbands consent for what she
did: for besides that it is said the heart of her husband trusted in her, it is
also said, that he praised her. Therefore he was neither ignorant of that which
she did, nor unwilling she should do it: it was neither without nor against
his consent.

3. It is alleged that wives have as great a care in getting 3. Reason. Wives
have a like care in getting goods.
goods, or in preserving them for the good of the family: therefore it is just
and equal, that they should have a like power in disposing them.

Answ. Though question may be made of the former part, at least for the greater
sort and number of wives, yet for answer to this reason I need not question it;
for the consequence does not follow, though that be granted. The right of
disposing goods does not simply rise from the care and pains of getting and
preserving them: but from that order that the Lord has been pleased to set
down. A wise and industrious child may be a means to raise and increase his
fathers estate, when his father takes little care and pains about it: yea a
faithful and wise steward or other servant (as Iaakob and Joseph were) may do
much more by his pains and care in getting and preserving the goods of the
family, then his master: yet will it not thereupon follow, that such a child,
or such a servant has as great a right and power to dispose such goods as his
father or his master.

4. The near conjunction betwixt man and wife is alleged: 4. Reason. Wives
are yoak-fellowes with their husbands.
they are said to be yoake-fellowes, and thence is inferred that they have a
like power in disposing goods.

Answ. They are yoak-fellowes in mutual familiarity, not in equal
authority; and in relation to others as children and servants, not in
opposition each to other. In this respect she is subject, not equal. If
therefore he will one thing, and she another, she may not think to have an
equal right and power, she must give place and yield.

. 33. Of the Treat. 4.. 54.
subjection of wives in distributing goods to charitable uses.
Some that grant that a wife is so subjected to her husband in a civil manner,
as she may not dispose any part of his goods at her pleasure to any civil use,
deny this subjection to extend to giving of alms, and such like charitable
uses.

Before I come to determine this question, let it be remembered, that it was
before granted, that 22.
ordinary duty must give place to extraordinary need, so that relief in
present necessity is not controuerted. Let it be also remembered that. 21.
a wife may have goods proper to her self, yea Treat. 4.. 54.
it shall be showed that an husband ought according to his ability to commit
something to her discretion and disposition: of these and such like goods she
is as much bound as her husband to expend something to charitable uses: and (as
God offers occasion) Pro. 31. 20.
to reach forth her hand to the poor and needy.

Yea further let this be premised, that in case a wife be forbidden or
restrained by her husband, she ought to use all the good means she can by her
self and her friends to move her husband to grant her some liberty, that she
may have some trial of her merciful and charitable disposition: if herein she
cannot prevail, then she ought to make known unto her husband such persons
cases as she thinks meet to be relieved, and use all the motives she can to
persuade him to afford them some relief.

But put the case a wise, religious, merciful wife, be married State of
question.
to a covetous worldling, who though he have wit, and understanding enough to
manage civil affairs, and to provide for the outward temporal estate of the
house, yet has no heart to relieve the poor, and is not only unwilling
himself to do good in that kind, but will not suffer his wife to do it,
whether may a wife privily take of such goods as he has reserved to his own
disposing, and simply without any kind of consent distribute them to
charitable uses, or though he expressly forbid her, yet directly against his
consent dispose them?

With reverend respect to better judgments, I think she may Non excus^bit
bona intentio vxoris, etiamsi ea acciperet ad eleemosynam faciendam. Greg.
Sayr. clav. reg. lib. 9. cap. 16.
not (except before excepted.) For it being before proved in general, that she
had no such liberty in disposing goods, I cannot see how this particular end of
giving alms can dispense with her general subjection in every thing, except
there were some particular warrant for it in Gods word.

. 34. Of general exhortations to works of mercy. How far they bind wives.
Object. The many general exhortations unto works of mercy, which without
limitation to any particular persons, are indefinitely directed to all, do
give sufficient warrant to wives: such as these, Luke 11. 41.
Give alms. Gal. 6. 10.
Let us do good. Heb. 13. 16.
To distribute forget not, etc.

Answ. All these are strong motives to provoke wives to be merciful and
charitable in such things as they may, by any means with their husbands
consent, or in such things as by their husbands are given to them. Yea also
they are strong motives to provoke husbands to allow them liberty to give
alms. But in the case propounded they give no liberty to wives: for it is a
ruled case laid down by Christ himself, that works of charity must be done,
and alms must be given of such things Luke 11. 41. (...).
as we have, or which are in our power to give. Now if the husband will not
give her that power, she has not power to give, and so is excused. Date quae
habetis eleemosynam Tertul. contr. Marcion. l. 4. 2 Cor. 8. 12.
In this case her true will, and her faithful and earnest desire shall be
accepted for the deed, according to that which the Apostle says, if there be
first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not
according to that he has not. Many cases may be given wherein inferiors are
restrained from works of mercy; as suppose a son or servant be desirous to
visit one sick ^r in prison, but his Parent or Master (though leave be asked)
will not suffer him, but charge him not to stir out of doors, or ^o go with
him another way, shall this son or servant notwithstanding that charge, do
that work of mercy?

. 35. Of obedience to an husband in such things as he sinfully forbids.
Object. 2. This restraint is not in the Lord, but rather against him and his
word, therefore a wife is not bound thereunto.

Answ. Though the husband sin in restraining his wife, yet she in that
restraint may obey, and that in the Lord: because the Lord who has commanded
her to be subject in every thing, has no where warranted her not to be subject
in this particular. It is expressly said in the law concerning a wives vows,
that if her husband break them after he has heard them, he shall bear her
iniquity. Numb. 30. 16.
Did not he then sin in restraining her, and was not she guiltless though
she yielded to his restraint? The condition betwixt husbands and wives in this
case, is not unlike the case betwixt other superiors in authority, and their
inferiors in subjection. But other inferiors may lawfully abstain from such
things as their governors do sinfully charge them to abstain from. For
suppose a son grown to be a man, live in his fathers house at his fathers
finding, and have no set portion of his own, and his father will not give him
leave to bestow any thing on charitable uses, is he now bound to give alms?
shall the curse be executed on him if he give not? A cross indeed I
acknowledge it to be, both to such a son, and also to a wife to be so
restrained: but not a curse or sin; the sin and curse lies on their head,
who restrain them by virtue of their authority, wherein they abuse their
authority: as other governors may do and often do, and yet neither liberty
granted thereby to subjects, nor authority taken from governors. In this
resemblance betwixt a son and a wife I desire not to be mistaken; for I
allege it not to make the state of a wife and a son all one: but to show
that those general precepts of giving alms, may have their exceptions, as
they which in particular handle that point, give other examples. There must
therefore be a further ground then the general commandment of almes-giuing to
prove the forenamed liberty of wives.

. 36. Of Zipporahs case in circumcising her son.
Object. 3. A wife was made to be an help to her husband: in those things
therefore wherein he fails, she must make supply, as Zipporah who performed a
duty which belonged to her Exodus 4. 25.
husband, and not unto her.

Answ. She may be an help in many other things, though this be out of her
power: yea and in this also by counsel, persuasion, and other like means she
may be a great help. The case of Zipporah was extraordinary, and of an urgent
present necessity, even to save the life of her husband. Besides, Moses was of
himself unable to do it, but willing that she should do it. Now what is this
to ordinary cases, and such cases as husbands are able enough themselves to
do, but altogether unwilling that it should be done by their wives? Factum
Zephorae singular est, and extraordinarium, neque constat illud simpliciter a
Deo approbatum fuisse. Simler. in Exodus 4. Luke 8. 3.


But what if Zipporahs example herein be not warrantable? for it does not
appear that it was simply approved of God: God does often remove temporary
judgments for the very works sake that is done, though in the manner it be
sinfully done. Instance the repentance of Ahab, 1. King. 21. 29.

. 37. Of the wife of Chuzas case in ministering to Christ.
4. Object. Ioanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, ministered unto Christ of
her substance without her husbands consent.

Answ. If this could be proved it were somewhat to the purpose; but this clause
without her husbands consent (wherein the maine state of the question
consists) is not in the text, nor by any good probability can be gathered
out of it. All the show of probability that can be showed for it is, that
Ioanna is there said to be the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward. But to show that
that is nothing, let it be noted,

1. That phrase does not imply that Chuza was then living. It is said that
David begat Solomon of the wife of Vriah, but Matthew. 1. 6. (...).
Vriah was not then living: therefore the translators for perspicuitie sake do
insert these words (her that had been) the wife of Vriah. So likewise Onan is
commanded to go in to his Genesis 38. 8.
brothers wife, yet does not this imply that his brother was then living.

Object. Why should mention be made of Chuza, Herod's steward, if he were not
then living?

Answ. To show that Ioanna was a woman of great place, whereby this fruit of
her faith in following Christ was the more commended. Thus in another kind
Matthew is entitled Matthew. 10. 3. (...).
the Publican, after he had clean relinquisht that office, the more to commend
his faith.

I do not here directly affirm that Chuza was then dead, but for ought that
this phrase does imply, he might be dead.

2. Some gather that this steward was that Ruler whose Chemnit. Harm. Euang.

son Christ healed, who thereupon believed with all his house. Which if he
were, then it cannot be doubted, but that his wife followed Christ with his
good liking and consent.

3. Chuza being Herod's steward, and so a man of great place, and public
imploiment, might, if he were then living, depute the managing of all affairs
at home to his wife, as the Prou. 31. 11.
husband of the good wife commended by Solomon, and so she might have at least
a general consent.

I do not certainly determine any of these expressly to be so, I do but note
them as probabilities, yet such as do sufficiently overthrow the surmised
liberty of a wife in giving alms without any consent of her husband: for this
of all other probabilities seems to be most improbable. Into my heart it can
never enter to imagine that Christ would give such an occasion of slander unto
his enemies, as to say he carried about with him other men's wives, without or
against the consent of their husbands, and suffered them to spend the goods of
their husbands upon him. I had much rather think that either such women as
followed him had no husbands living, or if they had, that they did that which
they did with the consent of their husbands.

. 38. Of the Treat. 4.. 18. 52.
restraint of wives about allowance for themselves or families without their
husbands consent.
That which has hitherto been delivered concerning a wives subjection in
disposing goods, may also be applied to other things concerning her self,
children, servants, etc. whereof I will give some examples.

A wife has not power to appoint what she list her self without or against
her husbands consent, either for her own allowance, or for her family; she
must rather rest satisfied with that which he appoints: for he being the
head, must have the ouer-ruling stroke therein. Besides he better knows what
may be afforded.

Quest. What if an husband make himself poorer then he is: and the allowance
which he appoints be meaner then his means, and unbeseeming his place and
state?

Answ. She ought, if possiby she can by her own instant persuasion, or any
other fair means, move him to that which tends to his honor and
reputation: but if she can no way prevail, her subjection requires
contentment and patience.

. 39. Of a wives Treat 4.. 18.
subjection to her husband about children.
A wife may not simply without, or directly against her husbands consent, order
and dispose of the children in giving them names, apparelling their bodies,
appointing their callings, places of bringing up, marriages, or portions.

1. For giving names to children, besides that it is throughout 1. Names.
the Scripture for the most part enjoined to the husband, as to Genesis 17. 19.
Abraham, to Luke 1. 13.
Zacharias, and to others, and that accordingly husbands have ordinarily done,
as Genesis 5. 3.
Adam, 29.
Lamech, and 21. 3.
Abraham, and others. It is to be noted that when there was a difference
betwixt the man and his wife in giving a childs name, he giving one name, she
another, the name which he gave, stood; though Genesis 35. 18.
Rachel named her youngest son Benoni, yet Benjamin (which name Iaakob gave)
was the childs name. So also when Luke 1. 62.
Elizabeth told her friends that her childs name must be John, they would not
rest therein, till Zacharias had ratified that name. Yea though Joseph were but
the supposed father of Jesus, yet because he was the husband of Mary the mother
of Jesus, Mat. 1. 21.
he had this honor given him, to give the name unto her child.

Whereas in Scripture it is sometimes said that the mothers named their
children, as Genesis 29. 32.
Leah, and 30. 24.
Rahel, and others, it is upon the forenamed ground to be supposed that they
had their husbands consent.

2. For appointing place and marriage it is noted that Genesis 27. 43, etc.
Rebekah 2. Place and marriage.
asked the consent of her husband: though she told her son Iaakob that he
should go to Haran to his uncle Laban to be there kept in safety from the fury
of Esau, yet she would not send him till Genesis 28. 1, 2.
Isaak had given his consent for his abode there, and taking a wife from thence.

3. For deputing unto a calling, it is noted of 1 Samuel 1. 11.
Annah, that 3. Calling.
though before her child was borne she had by solemn vow dedicated him to the
Lord, yet when the child was borne Verse 22.
she asked her husbands consent about it. 4. Apparel.


4. That which is noted of 1 Samuel 2. 19.
Annahs carrying a little coat to her son year by year when she went up
with her husband, shows that she did it not without her husbands consent.
Women are for the most part prone to pranke up their children above their
husbands place and calling, and therefore good reason that therein they should
be governed by their husbands.

Object.
What if husbands be more forward to have their children attired vainly and
unseemly, then wives?

Answ. A wife must do what she can to hinder it: if she can no way prevail
with him, she by reason of her subjection is much more excused, then he could
be, if he would suffer his wife therein to have her will.

5. The law that lays the charge upon husbands to give 5. Portions. Deuteronomy. 21.
15, etc.
such and such portions to his children, and the answerable practice of
husbands from time to time, show that the wife of her self has not power to
order them.

. 40. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 18.
subjection to her husband about ordering servants and beasts.
If wives must have their husbands consent in ordering and disposing of their
children which come out of her womb, much more of their servants.

They may not take in, or thrust out servants against their husbands mind. In
this point, as in many other, Sarah manifested her wiue-like obedience; in that
Genesis 16. 5.
she would not deal roughly with her maid though she were provoked: much less
and 21. 10.
put her out of doors till she had made the matter known to her husband.
Though she failed in the manner, yet in the thing it self she is a good
example. It is further noted and approved in the 2 King. 4. 22.
Shunemite that she asked her husbands consent about sending a servant with her.

My meaning is not that such wives as have servants allowed them to attend upon
them should ask their husbands consent whenever they have occasion to use
them; for their husbands by allowing them men for their attendance manifest
their will and consent that they may use them as they see occasion: but that
they should not use and employ their servants in such things as they know their
husbands would dislike, except they can gain their husbands consent.

Against those particulars of children and servants it may be objected, that
wives are parents of their children as well as husbands, and mistresses of
servants as well as they masters, and therefore have altogether as great power
over them as their husbands.

Answ. Indeed if the authority of the husband come not between, that may be
granted in relation betwixt her and them: but her power being subordinate to
her husbands in relation to him she has not so great a power: the power of a
wife that now we speak of is directly in relation to her husband.

The like may be said of their beasts and cattle, a particular point noted
also in the example of the Shunemite, who having occasion to use a beast went
to her husband, and said, send I pray thee with me one of the asses. 2 King. 4.
22.


. 41. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 18.
subjection in entertaining strangers iournying abroad, and making vows.
If wives may not at their pleasure use the things appertaining to the house,
much less may they bring strangers into the house and entertain them without
or against their husbands consent. The good Shunemite so often named as a
president 2 King. 4. 10.
for good wives, first asked her husbands consent, before she lodged a Prophet
of the Lord.

The same pattern is also commended unto wives to move them not to journey
abroad without their husbands consent. For though that good wife had a very
weighty and just occasion 2 King. 4. 22.
to go unto the Prophet, yet she would not before she knew her husbands mind.

As for a wives power to make vows, in that the law gives an husband power to
disanull her vow when he knows it, it implies that she ought to have his
consent in making it, if Number. 30. 9.
at least she desire to have it established, which she ought to desire, or else
she mocketh God.

I have thought good to mention these particular points for illustration of a
wives subjection, because they are all of them grounded on Gods word: many
other might be added to them, but these are sufficient.

. 42. Of aberrations contrary to a wives subjection in doing things without or
against their husbands consent.
Now consider we the usual vices and aberrations contrary to those duties: the
general sum of all is, for a wife to take on her to do what she list,
whether her husband will or no, either not willing that he should know what she
does, or not caring though it be against his mind and will. Of this sort are

1. Such as privily take money out of their husbands closets, 1. Privy
purloyning husbands goods.
counters, or other like places where he lays it, never telling him of it,
nor willing that he should know it: likewise such as after the like manner take
ware out of the shop, corn out of the garner, sheep out of the flock, or any
other goods to sell and make money of: or to give away, or otherwise to use so
as their husbands shall never know, if they can hinder it. Such wives herein
sin hainously, and that in many respects.

First they disobey the ordinance of God in a maine branch of their particular
calling, which is subjection.

2. They ill repay the care and pains which their husbands take for their
good. Many such wives recompense evil for good, which is a deuillish quality.

3. They are often a means to impair and impouerish their husbands estate.

4. They show themselves no better then Si vxor ex bonis communibus si^e viri
licentia saltem praesumpta accipiat, vere furtum commi^^it. Greg. Sayr. clau.
reg. l. 9. c. 16.
pilfring thieves thereby. All that can be justly and truly said for their
right in the common goods, cannot defend them from the guilt of theft: they are
the more dangerous by how much the more they are trusted, and less suspected:
and their fact is so much the more heinous by how much the more dear their
husbands ought to be unto them.

5. They are a very ill example to other inferiors in the house, for seldom
has a man a deceitful wife, but some of the children or servants, are made
accessarie thereunto, being made her instruments to take the goods, and bestow
them as she orders, and so are made unfaithful.

6. They make themselves slaves to their own children and servants, whom they
dare not displease, lest they should tell what was done.

7. They teach their children and servants to be thieves: for besides that such
as are used by their mistresses to purloine for them, are thereby made
accessarie to their sin, they will also purloine for themselves, when their
mistresses shall not know. So as what with the wives purloining one way, and
the childrens or servants another way, a man's estate may be wasted as dew
before the Sun, and he not know which way.

2. Such as will have what allowance they think best for 2. Taking what

themselves and family, and scornfully say, They will not be at their husbands
finding: they know best what allowance is fittest for the family, and that it
shall have. Many will make their husbands ear tingle again, yea and make the
whole house (if not the street also) ring of it, if they think their allowance
be not answerable to the uttermost extent of their husbands estate. This
impatiencie and insolency, as it crosses Gods ordinance, so it makes both
their lives uncomfortable.

3. Such as cocker, attire, or any way bring up their children 3. Ordering
children against their husbands mind.
otherwise then their husbands would, even to the grief and dishonor of their
husbands: keeping them at home when their husbands, for their better education,
would have them abroad: as these sin in hindering the good of their children,
so also in not yielding to their husbands. 4. Ordering servants against their
husbands mind.


4. Such as will have their own will about servants, taking in, and putting

house-wife, being idle (says he) they go about from house to house: therefore

further, and makes this to be another note of a strumpet, that Prou. 7. 11.

to hear any of their Sermons: and such most of all as enter into some Popish
Nunnery, and vow never to return to their husbands again.

Object. 1 Samuel 1. 15.
Annah vowed her child to God without her husbands consent, why may not they
much more vow themselves to God?

Answ. Assuredly she was persuaded that her husband would not be against it,
and so had an implicit consent: which may well be gathered, because afterward
she made it known to him, as both the (...) componitur ex diuersis vocibu^
(...) Petiui eum a Deo, I have asked him of God.

that speech of Annah, I will bring him that he may appear before the Lord,
and there abide for ever, and the answer of her husband, Uers. 23.
The Lord establish his word, and 1 Samuel 2. 19.
his going up with her when he was dedicated to the Lord, do all show.

Thus far of the first branch of a wives submission in abstaining from doing
things without her husbands consent. The second follows, in doing the things
which herequireth.

. 43. Of a wives active Obedience.
It is a good proof and trial of a wives obedience, to abstain from doing
such things as otherwise she would do, if her husbands contrary will did not
restrain her: but yet that is not sufficient, there must be an active, as well
as a passive obedience yielded. That old Law before mentioned (thy desire shall
be subject to thine husband, and he shall rule over thee) implies so much
also. If she refuse to do what he would have her to do, her desire is not
subject to him, but to her self, neither does he rule over her.

This active part of her obedience has respect

1. To his commandments, readily to do what he lawfully A wives active
obedience respects first her husbands commandment.
commands.

2. To his reproves, carefully to redress what he justly blames.

For the first, so far ought a wife to be from thinking scorn to be
commanded by her husband, that the very knowledge which by any means she has
of her husbands mind and will, ^ought to have the force of a straight
commandment with her. This readiness to obey is commended in the wives of
Iaakob, to whom when Iaakob had declared what motives he had to depart from
their fathers house, intimating thereby that he meant to depart, and would have
them to go with him, yet before he particularly expressed his will, they
readily answered, Whatsoever God Genesis 31. 16.
has said unto thee, do: whereby they gave him to understand that they were
ready to yield unto whatsoever he would have done.

. 44. Of a wives willingness to Treat. 4.. 18.
dwell where her husband will.
To make this part of a wives obedience somewhat more clear, I will exemplify
it by two or three particular instances, recorded and approved in Gods word.

The first is, that a wife ought to be willing to dwell where her husband will
have her dwell.

The wives of Abraham, Isaak, and Iaakob, herein manifested their wiue-like
obedience: though their husbands brought them from their own country, and
from their fathers house, yet they refused not to go with them, but dwelt in a
strange country, and that in tents.

Note in particular what Iaakobs wives say to their husband in this case, Is
there any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers Genesis 31. 14.
house? implying thereby, that seeing it was their husbands pleasure to be
gone, they would not any longer tarry in their fathers house, to look for any
more portion or inheritance there.

These examples do further show that if an husband have just occasion to
remove from one country to another, and in those countries from place to place,
his wife ought to yield to go with him, if he require it at her hands. Note
what the Apostle says, have we not power to lead about a wife? That
interrogation 1 Cor. 9. 5.
implies a strong asseueration. The husband then having power to lead about a
wife from place to place, she ought to submit her self to that power. This
clause (as well as other Apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas)
shows, that this was not only a power which might be used, but which was used
by husbands, and yielded unto by wives.

Object. The forenamed examples are extraordinary, and that upon extraordinary
occasions.
Answ. Yet they may be patterns for ordinary occasions which are lawful and
warrantable. Was it not an extraordinary fact of Eliah to pray first that there
might be no rain, and Iam. 5. 17.
then again that there might be rain? yet is this propounded as a general
pattern to move us to pray for things lawful.

Now in laying down this duty I added the clause and caveat of just occasion,
to meet both with such as upon discontent, or superstition, leave the land
where the true Gospel is maintained, and preached, and go into idolatrous
places: and also with such wandering giddy heads as only to satisfy their own
humor, and to see fashions, as we speak, can never rest in a place, but are
continually removing from country to country, and from place to place: I
think (to use the words of the Apostle) a wife is not under bondage in such
cases. 1 Cor. 7. 15.


But if a man be sent of an embassage by his Prince, or country: or if a
Preacher or Professor be called into another country, as Bucer and Peter
Martyr were into England in King Edwards days (which to this day is usual in
other countries) or if a man be adjudged unto long imprisonment, and upon these
and other like occasions shall require his wife to be with him, she ought in
duty to yield unto his demand.

Contrary is the mind and practice of many wives, who Contrary, when a wife
makes her husband dwell where she will.
being affected and addicted to one place more then another, as to the place
where they were bred and brought up, where their greatest, best, and most
friends dwell, and where they have good acquaintance, refuse to go and dwell
where their husbands calling lies, though he require, and desire them never so
much. Thus many husbands are forced to their great damage for peace sake to
yield unto their wives, and so either to relinquish their calling, or to have
two houses; whence it follows, that sometimes they must neglect their
servants and calling, and sometimes be absent from their wives, if not from
their children also. Some wives pretend that they cannot endure the smoke of
the city, other that they cannot endure the air of the country: whereas
indeed their own humor and conceit stuffes them more then either city smoke
or country air. I cannot call such the daughters of Sarah herein: 1 Pet. 3.
5, 6.
they are not like those forenamed holy women that trusted in God, and were
subject to their husbands, but rather like to that light housewife of the
Leuite, who would not dwell in her husbands Judge. 19. 2.
house at mount Ephraim, but at her fathers house in Beth-lehem Judah. Such
wives as I speak of, in matrimonial chastity may be more honest, but in
wiuelike subjection are little more dutiful. Let this be taken for a fault,
and it will be the sooner amended.

. 45. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 29.
readiness to come to her husband when he requires it.
Another particular instance of a wives readiness to yield unto her husbands
commandment is, to come to her husband when her husband requires it, either
by calling her, or sending for her. The forenamed Genesis 31. 4.
wives of Iaakob being sent for to their husband in the field where he was,
made no excuse, but came presently. So far ought wives herein to subject
their wills to their husbands, that though it may seem to them some
disparagement to come, yet if their husbands will have it so they must yield,
otherwise they seem even to Esth. 1. 17.
despise their husbands.

Contrary is Vashtie-like stoutnesse, when wives think and Contrary,
stoutnesse in refusing to come.
say, it is a servants part to come when they are called or sent for, and they
will never yield to be their husbands servants, to come at his command. By the
same reason may all duties of subjection be rejected. But for this particular,
let such stout Es^h. 1. 16, etc.
dames note the issue of Vashties stubbornness. As many excuses might be
alleged for her as I think for any: for First, she was Hebraei docent Vast^am
natam fuisse ex Baltbasare rege Chaldaeorum. Feuard. in Esth. 1. Alij, ex Cyro.
Merl. in Esth.
royally descended, being the daughter of a King. Secondly, she was then among
the honorable women of the kingdom. Thirdly, the King was in drink when he
sent for her. Fourthly, he sent for her to show her beauty before multitudes
of men, which was not seemly. But all these were not sufficient to excuse her
fault, and free her from blame. First, though she were of royal parentage, yet
she was a wife, and her husband sent for her. Secondly, being among the noble
women of the kingdom, she should the rather have showed her self a pattern
of subjection in this kind. Thirdly, though he were in drink, yet remained he
an husband: and the thing which he commanded was not such but that she might
have done it without sin. Fourthly, if she thought the thing unseemly, she
should first have used all the fair means she could to have been spared; but
if by all she could not have prevailed, then (the thing being not simply
unlawful and a sin) she should have yielded.

Object. Her fault was not in that as a wife she came not to her husband, but
in that as a subject she came not to her Sovereign.
Answ. Her fault was in both: and in the judgment passed against her, that
former was most urged, namely that by her Esth. 1. 17.
example all women might learn to despise their husbands.

2. Object. Her fact is so censured but by heathen men, that had no
understanding of Gods word.
Answ. 1. The holy Scripture by the several circumstances so distinctly noted
intimates that her rebellious fact was a notorious fault: and accordingly both
Pelican. Lauater. Gualt. Strigel. Cuper. Merlin. Feuard. Bellator. Rupert.
Isiodor. Hisp. Raban. alijque Comment. in Esth.
judicious commenters, and also Preachers do tax her of sinful disobedience
to her husband.

2. Though they were heathen, yet they showed what subjection is required of
wives to their husbands by the very light of nature, whereby this sin is
aggrauated.

3. Abimelech was but a heathen man, yet his sentence concerning a woman's
subjection in these words, he is to thee a Genesis 20. 16.
covering of the eyes, is taken to be judicious, and being approved by the holy
Ghost, to be a good proof. As for that particular of Uashtie, why is it so
largely recorded in the Scripture but for instruction, and admonition unto
wives?

. 46. Of a wives readiness to Treat.. 29.
do what her husband requires.
A third particular instance of a wives readiness to yield unto her husbands
commandment, is, to perform what business he requires of her. When of a
sudden there came three men to Abram, and he was desirous to entertain them,
he bid his wife make ready quickly three measures of meal, etc. and she Genesis
18. 6.
did it accordingly. Jeroboam having a weighty occasion to send to Ahijah the
Prophet, thought it meet to send by his 1 King. 14. 2, etc.
wife, she accordingly (though a Queen) went: she did as her husband would
have her.

Contrary is the humor of many wives who will not do Contrary, stubbornness
in refusing to do a thing upon command.
any thing upon command. If such a wives husband being desirous to entertain a
friend on the sudden, shall use Abrams phrase, make ready quickly, etc. she
will say, let him come and do it himself, if he will have it so quickly done,
I will not be his drudge: or if, having a matter of moment and secrecy, he
will his wife her self to do it, she will reply, I am none of your servants;
cannot you put it to one of them, or do it your self? Yet will such wives be
ready to command their husbands to do every toy, and if he do it not, they
can reply, is this such a matter? and may not a wife speak to her husband?
Were the point of obedience well learned, it would cast such wives into another
mould.

These few particulars may serve for direction in many hundreds. I proceed to
the other part of a wives active obedience, which respects the reproves of
her husband.

. 47. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 34, 35.
meek taking a reproof.
The husband having authority over his wife, by virtue thereof he has power,
yea it is his duty as there is needful cause to rebuke her: By just
consequence therefore it follows, A wives active obedience to her husbands
reproof. The best trial of obedience.
that it is her duty to yield obedience thereunto. Which ought the rather to
be done because the chiefest trial of sound obedience lies herein. For
nothing goes so much against ones stomach as reproof: she that yields when
she is rebuked, will much more when she is entreated. This point of obedience
is manifested two ways.

1. By meekness in taking a reproof.

2. By endeavor to redress what is justly reproved. The very point of
obedience especially consists in this latter: the former is as a good
preparatiue thereunto, without which it will hardly be done, at least not well
done.

Meekness in this case is one of the most principal fruits of 1. She must
meekly take reproof. 1 Pet. 3. 4. Genesis 30. 1.
that meek and quiet spirit which S. Peter commends unto wives. Howsoever
Rachel justly deserved blame for coming in a fuming chafe, and with an
imperious command to her husband, yet in that she meekly took his sharp
reproof (for she replied not against it, but meekly gave a direction for the
better accomplishment of her desire) her example is commendable: commendable I
say, not in the matter of her direction, but in her patient bearing of reproof.

Much wisdom may be learned hereby: for when any Wisdom learned.
meekly take a reproof, thereby they suppress their passion, and keep it
from rising as a cloud before their understanding and darkning it, and so may
they better judge of the matter reproved whether it be just or no: and whether
it need redress or no: whereof they who are impatient of reproof, and fret
and fume against it, cannot so well judge. The virgin Mary made good use of
Christ's reproving her, and thereby Joh. 2. 4, 5.
learned and taught a good point of wisdom, namely so to refer our affairs
to Christ as we expect his pleasure; and not prescribe time, means, manner, or
any other like circumstances unto him.

Quest. What if the husbands reproof be bitter? Suadeo mulieribus vt viros
etiam asperiores perserant. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11.

Answ. He therein forgets his place, yet thereupon she must not forget her
duty. If Iaakobs reproof be well noted, we shall find it very tart, for it is
expressly said that his anger was kindle^ against her, (Genesis 30. 2.) so as he
spoke in anger: the manner and form of his words being with an interrogation,
and the Excandescenti marito cede, and molli oratione iuva. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp.
matter also, am I in Gods stead, etc. declare tartness: yet (as was declared
before) she showed meeknese.

Quest. What if his reproof be unjust?
2. Answ. Yet may not meekness be forgotten. In such a case a wife may make a
just apology to clear her own innocence, and manifest her husbands error:
but if he refuse to hear her, or will not believe her, then (as S. Peter
speaks in another 1 Pet. 2. 19, 20.
case) she must endure grief for conscience toward God.

The two reasons which there he renders in that other case may not unfitly be
applied to this.

1. In general this is thank-worthy, it is a grace, a glory to (...).
her: a matter that deserves praise and commendation.

2. In particular it is acceptable to God: howsoever their husbands (...).
may deal roughly and untowardly with them, yet God will graciously respect
them, if they shall patiently in obedience to his ordinance bear their
husbands unjust reproves.

3. I may add this reason also, that thus they shall show themselves good
Christians indeed, in that they are not overcome Romans 12. 21.
of evil.

Contrary is their mind who by no means will brook a rebuke at their
husbands hands: it skills not whether it be just or unjust: if their husbands
reprove them, they shall be sure to have the reproof rebounded back again
upon their faces, and that with greater violence then ever it came from them.
There be some that seem to be very good wives till they be tried by the
touchstone of reproof: but then though the reproof be for matter most just,
for manner most mild, and that in private betwixt their husbands and
themselves, yet they grow so impatient, or rather mad, as they forbear not to
give their husbands the most scornful speeches that they can invent, using
withal bitter imprecations and execrations, and threaten to drown or hang
themselves if they be crossed of their wills. Yea further, if wise husbands
shall forbear them in their passion, and after it is allaied tell them how
unbeseeming their places they carried themselves, they will seek to justify
themselves, and lay all the blame on their husbands for crossing them in their
will: or if they cannot but see their fault, yet they will only say, it is my
infirmity: but yet ever continue in that infirmity: and though they make show
of fearing God, yet labor not to purge this corrupt humor out of their
hearts. Hence is it for the most part that contentions arise betwixt man and
wife. If wives would learn in this point to be subject, many iarres, which
from time to time arise betwixt them, would be allaied, if not prevented.

the wife of David, and Jobs wife (though they gave just occasion to be most
sharply reproved, yet) shall rise up in judgment against these wives, because
they were silent after they were reproved, and replied not. Solomon often titles

readiness to redress what her husband justly reproves in her.
A further degree of obedience in bearing reproof is, that 2 She must redress
what is justly reproved.
a wife readily redress what is justly reproved by her husband: I say justly,
because where no fault is, there needs no amendment: patience may be needful
(as was before showed) but no repentance of that which is not amiss. But where
any thing is amiss, there must be a redress. Rachel did amiss in Genesis 31. 19.
bringing Idols into her husbands house: her husband in and 35. 2, 4.
bidding her among others to put away their strange gods, reproved them all.
Whereupon she with all the rest gave to him all their strange gods. This was a
good redress.

A reproof may be justly given either for a good duty omitted; or for an
evil thing committed: and accordingly must the redress or amendment be. A
duty formerly omitted must after the reproof be more carefully observed and
performed, if it be a continual duty, and may be again performed: otherwise
the redress is a testification of true sorrow for that fault. When an evil is
committed, if any means can be used to make up the hurt, and redress the
mischief that followed thereupon, it must be done: if not, sorrow as before,
must be testified, and care taken that the same, or the like be not committed
again.

As a good conscience requires as much of all Christians by whomsoever they be
reproved, so the respect which a wife owes to an husband does after an
especial manner require it. Otherwise her fault is doubled, 1. by continuance
in her sin;

2. by disobedience to her husband.

Contrary is their spirit who for reproof wax the worse: Contrary, to be
worse for reproving. Prou. 9. 8.
being like those scorners (of whom Solomon speaks) that hate those that
reprove them. It is the speech of some wives, that if their husbands would let
them alone they would do the better: but upon rebuke they will never amend:
the more their husbands find fault, the more will they go on, in doing what
they do. What other judgment can be given of such, then that which the wise
man gives, there is more hope Prou. 26. 12.
of a fool then of them.

. 49. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 50
contentment with her husbands present estate. Of submission hitherto.
Contentment is also a part of obedience: it has respect to a man's outward
estate and ability, in and with which a wife must rest satisfied and
contented, whether it be high or low, great or mean, wealthy or needy, above,
equal, or under that estate wherein she was before marriage: yea though a man
have been sometimes great in estate, yet, if he decay therein, and be brought
to a mean estate, she ought to rest content. Thus much Job implies in his
reply to his wife, saying, shall we receive Job 2. 10. expounded.
good at the hand of God, and not receive evil? The evil he speaks of was
the loss of his goods, servants, and children, together with other miseries
that Satan through Gods permission inflicted upon him: the receiving of evil
which he speaks of was a resting content with it, and a patient bearing of
it. Evil may be laid on any, and so they forced to bear it: but they only
receive it, who are content with it. Now in that he uses the plural number
(WE) and speaking to his wife says (shall not we receive evil) he shows
that his wife ought as well as he to have rest contented in that poor and
miserable estate: For

1. Man and wife being one flesh, by virtue of their matrimonial union, both
his advancement, and also his abasement is hers: as she rises with him, so she
falls with him. Wherefore as she is willing to be advanced with him, so she
must be content to be abased with him.

2. If at the time of marriage her husband was of meaner estate then she, she
voluntarily put her self into that mean estate: for a wife takes her husband
(as he her) for better for worse, for richer for poorer. And shall she not be
content with her own act? If after marriage his estate decay, and wax meaner
then it was, she is to be persuaded that by God it was so ordered, and that God
aimed at her humiliation as well as his: and thereupon she ought in her
dutiful submission to Gods ouer-ruling providence to be patient and content:
this Job implies under this phrase, shall we not receive evil at the hand of
God? and under this, The Lord takes away.

3. A wives contentment is a great ease to her husband lying under a cross:
and it makes the burden seem much lighter then otherwise it would, if at
least he be a kind husband, and affected with his wives passion, as he ought
to be. For a loving husband in every distress is more perplexed for his wife,
then for himself.

thought this; and withal they manifest their own rashness and
unadvisedness, in that they gave their hands and plighted their troth to those
whom they knew not. If they say, they were deceived by their friends whom they
put in trust, I answer that marriage is too weighty a matter to be wholly
referred over to the trust of friends: every one that yields to be married,
ought well to know the party unto whom in this case they yield: and above all
they ought to seek direction, help, and blessing from God. If notwithstanding
all the means which possibly they could use, they be deceived, they are to
look unto God, and to behold his providence therein: and duly to weigh whether
the Lord have crossed their desire for their humiliation, or for trial of
their patience, wisdom and other like graces, or else to weine them from some
vain and worldly delights, whereunto they were too much addicted.

they can get it, will not abate any thing of their brave apparel, dainty
cheer, rich furniture, and other like things, which are causes of great
expense to their husbands: hereby also it comes often to pass that husbands
are thought to be wealthier then indeed they are, and so greater taxations and
charges then they can bear are laid upon them for King, Country, Church,
Poor, and the like.

laziness in wives.

. 51. Of Treat. 4.. 26.
cases wherein a wife ought not to forbear what her husband forbids.
So much of the distinct branches of a wives subjection. The limitation and
manner of performing it next follows.

To know the limitation of a wives obedience, and the manner how she ought to
yield subjection unto her husband, two things must be considered: 1. The place
of an husband. 2. The place of a wife.


The husbands place is noted in this phrase, as to the Lord: Ephesians. 5. 22.
whereby is showed that the husband even by virtue of his place is to his wife
in Christ's stead: which is further more plainly laid down in these words
following, the husband is Verse. 23.
the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church.

The wives place is intimated in these words, as the Church Verse. 24.
is subject unto Christ, so let wives be to their own husbands: whereby it is
clear that the obedience which a wife performs to her husband must be such
an obedience as the Church performs to Christ.

From the place of an husband, I gather this general ground concerning a wives
subjection, that

Subjection must be yielded to the husband as to Christ, whence will follow two
conclusions, one negative, which is this,

The wife must yield no other subjection to her husband then what may stand
with her subjection to Christ.

The other affirmative, which is this,

The wife must subject her self to her husband in that manner that she would
or should subject her self to Christ.

The former is a necessary condition required of all inferiors in their
subjection, and obedience (as I showed Treat. 1.. 6.
before) much more in a wives subjection to her husband, because there is of
all unequals See. 4. of this Treat.
the least disparity betwixt husbands and wives.

Hence for our present purpose, I gather these two other more particular
conclusions, The first whereof is this,

1. If God expressly command the wife any duty, and her husband will not by any
means give consent that she shall do it, but forbid her, she may and ought to
do it without, or against his consent.

Two cautions are warily to be observed about this conclusion: 2. Cautions for
limiting a wives persisting to do that which her husband forbids.


1. That the wife be sure that God has commanded her that which she does
without or against her husbands consent. If she doubt, then she must stay, and
for bear till she gain his consent. When two opposite cases meet together,
and the one be doubtful, the other plain and express: the doubtful case
must give place to the more evident. Now the law of subjection is indefinite,
thy desire shall be subject to thine husband; Gen 3 16.
the extent of it is general, in every thing; the only reservation and
exception is in the Lord; wherefore if the wife be not sure that that which her
husband forbids her is against the Lord, she must forbear to do it.

The second caution is that she use all good means she can to gain her
husbands consent, before she do, even that which is commanded, against his
consent. Thus shall she testify her subjection both to God and her husband. To
God, in that nothing can keep her from doing his express commandment: she
will rather offend her husband then God, when one of them must needs be
offended. To her husband, in that she puts it to the uttermost push, and
uses all the means she can to avoid his offense, in so much as he himself
might see (if the god of this world blinded not his eyes) that the offense is
no way given on her part, but merely taken on his.

For proof of this, it is without all contradiction true, that the wife is not
bound to greater subjection unto her husband then the subject is unto the
magistrate: but a subject ought not to forbear a bounden duty commanded of
God, because his governor forbids him. Instance the example of Daniel, Dan. 6.
7, etc.
who daily made his prayers to God, though the King had made a solemn decree
that none should ask any petition of God or man within thirty days but of the
king. Instance also the Apostles, Act. 4. 18, etc.
who preached the Gospel, though they were expressly forbidden.

Though the Scripture be plentiful in affording examples of wives subjection,
yet it is very sparing in recording examples of those who in such warrantable
cases refused to be subject, lest wives from thence should take too great
liberty.

Some are recorded, but such as are either extraordinary, or not every way
instifiable. Abigails example was extraordinary, 1 Samuel 25. 18.
and therefore not imitable but in such like extraordinary cases.

The example of Rebekah, which may seem somewhat more Genesis 27. 6.
pertinent, is not every way to be justified. For though the thing which she
intended were for the substance of it very good, and ought to have been done,
namely the blessing of Iaakob, (for God foreshewed that the blessing
appertained to Iaakob, in that he said, The elder shall serve the younger) yet
Genesis 25. 23.
because she put not her husband in mind of Gods word, nor labored to
persuade him to fulfill the same, but went about the matter deceitfully, she
cannot therein be justified. But in the general this example shows that Gods
word must be yielded unto rather then an husbands will.

For better application of this point I will lay down some particular
instances agreeable to Gods word. Suppose a wife well instructed in the true
religion be married to an idolatrous or profane husband, and he without any just
cause forbid her to go to the Church, especially on the Lords days, to pray
in English, to read the word, to teach her children the principles of religion,
to restore that which she has unjustly and fraudulently gotten, with the like,
she may, and must do them notwithstanding.

Object. Why may not giving of alms be reckoned among these?
Answ. 1. Because the husband has a greater power over the goods, then over
these things.

2. Because almes-giuing is not simply commanded to all, but to such as have
wherewithal to give: but these things are simply commanded to all.

. 52. Of cases wherein a wife ought to forbear what her husband requires.
The other particular conclusion is this, that

If an husband require his wife to do that which God has forbidden she ought
not to do it.

Two cautions like the former are likewise to be observed 2. Cautions for
limiting a wives refusing to do that which her husband commands.
about this point.

First, that she be sure (being truly informed by Gods word) that that which
she refuses to do at her husbands command, is forbidden by God.

Secondly, that she first labor with all meekness and by all good means
that she can to dissuade her husband from urging and pressing that upon her,
which with a good conscience she cannot do.

A like proof may be brought for this as was for the former: for we know that
a wife is not bound unto greater subjection to her husband then a son is unto
a father: but a son may in the case propounded forbear to do that which his
father requires and commands him to do: instance the approved example of
Jonathan, who refused to bring David 1 Samuel 20. 31.
unto Saul to be slain, though his father commanded him so to do. I might
also instance the same in Saul's subjects and 1 Samuel 22. 17.
servants, who refused to slay the Priests of the Lord at his command. Though
an husband be not reckoned in particular among those to whom we are forbidden
to hearken if they Deuteronomy. 13. 6.
entice us to idolatry, yet by the rule of relation he is implied, and by just
consequence gathered from this clause, thy friend which is as thine own soul;
for who so dear as an husband?

To exemplify this in some particulars as I did the former, If an husband
shall command his wife to go to Mass, to a stage play, to play at dice, to
prostitute her body to uncleanness, to go garishly and whorishly attired, to
sell by scant weights, short measures, or the like, she ought not to do so.

. 53. Of wives faults in showing more respect to their husbands then to God.
Contrary to this limitation is on the one side a fawning flattering
disposition of such wives as seek to please their husbands, so as they care
not to displease God, (Iezabel was such an one; to please her husband most
lewdly she did 1 Ki. 21. 7. etc.
practice Naboths death) and on the other side a fainting timorous heart which
makes them fear their husbands more then they fear God. Good Sarah, that
worthy president of Genesis 12. 13. etc.
good wives in other things, somewhat failed herein. Did wives duly consider,
and always remember that they have an husband (namely Christ) in heaven, as
well as on earth, and that there is greater difference betwixt that and this
husband, then betwixt heaven and earth, and that both in giving reward, and
taking revenge, there is no comparison betwixt them, their care of pleasing, or
their fear of offending their husband in heaven would be much more then of
pleasing, or offending their husband on earth: if any thing were commanded or
forbidden them by their husbands on earth against Christ, they would say, If I
do this, or forbear that, I should work falsehood against mine own soul;
for nothing can be hid from mine husband in heaven: yea I should herein obey
Satan, rather then God.

. 54. Of the manner of a wives subjection to her husband.
The second general conclusion concerning the manner of a wives subjection,
which was gathered from the place of an husband, was this, that

The wife must subject her self to her husband in that manner, that she would
or should subject her self to Christ. The particle As in this clause (as unto
the Lord) imports so much.

This very conclusion is also inferred out of the place of a wife: In the same
place that the Church is to Christ, a wife is to an husband: therefore such
subjection as the Church yields to Christ, must a wife yield to her husband;
which the very words of the Apostle do expressly affirm. Now we Ephesians. 5. 24.
know that every Christian wife in her particular ought to yield that
obedience to Christ which the Church in general does: therefore also she must
yield such subjection to her husband as she should to Christ.

Quest. See. 5. of this Treatise.
What if an husband be an enemy of Christ? must such subjection be yielded to
an enemy of Christ as to Christ himself?

Answ. Yea: because in his office he is in Christ's stead, though in his heart
an enemy. In this case will the wisdom, patience, and obedience of a wife be
best tried. It is noted of the Church, that she is a Lilly among thorns. She
remains Cant. 2. 2.
Lilly-like, white, soft, pleasant, amiable, though she be joined with thorns,
which are scraggie, prickly, sharp: so a wife must be mild, meek, gentle,
obedient, though she be matched with a crooked, perverse, profane, wicked
husband: thus shall her virtue and grace shine forth the more clearly, even as
the stars shine forth most brightly in the darkest night. Among wives Abigail
deserves great praise, that forgot not her duty, though she were married to a
churlish, covetous, drunken sot, a very Nabal in name and deed. As for those
who take occasion from the wickedness of their husbands to neglect their
duty, they add to their cross a curse: for a cross it is to have a bad
husband, but to be a bad wife is a sin, which pulls down a curse. Let
wives therefore remove their eyes from the disposition of their husbands
person, to the condition of his place: and by virtue thereof, seeing he bears
Christ's image, be subject to him as unto Christ.

This general conclusion might be applied to the matter of subjection as well
as to the manner, for the Church acknowledges Christ her superior, fears
him inwardly, reuerenceth him outwardly, obeys him also both by forbearing to
do what he forbids, and also by doing what he commands, which points
having been before distinctly and largely handled and applied to wives, I will
not repeat them again. Wherefore now to insist in the manner only, there are
four Four graces needful to season a wives subjection.
virtues which are especially needful hereunto, whereby the Church seasoneth
her subjection to Christ, and wives also may and must season their subjection
to their husbands.

These are the four,

1. Humility, 2. Sincerity, 3. Cheerfulness, 4. Constancy.

. 55. Of wives Treat 4.. 15.
humility in every duty.
Humility is that grace that keeps one from thinking highly of himself above
that which is meet: and in regard of that mean conceit which he has of
himself makes him think reuerendly, and highly of others: so as if humility
be placed in a wives heart, it will make her think better of her husband then
of her self, and so make her the more willing to yield all subjection unto
him. The Apostle requires it of all Phil. 2. 3. Ephesians. 4. 2.
Christians as a general sauce to season all other duties: but after a
peculiar manner is it needful for inferiors: most of all for wives, because
there are See before. 4.
many prerogatives appertaining to their place, which may soon make them
think they ought not to be subject, unless they be humbly minded. That the
Church does herewith season her subjection, is clear by the book of
Canticles, where often she acknowledges her own meannesse, and the excellency
of her spouse.

Therefore as the Church is humbly subject to Christ, so let wives be to their
husbands.

. 56. Of wives pride.
Contrary is pride, which puffs up wives, and makes them think there is no
reason they should be subject to husbands, they can rule themselves well
enough, yea and rule their husbands too, as well as their husbands rule them.
No more pestilent vice for an inferior, then this: it is the cause of all
rebellion, disobedience, and disloyalty: only by pride, comes contention.
Pro. 13. 10.


. 57. Of Wives Treat. 4.. 63.
sincerity in every duty.
II. Sincerity is that grace that makes one to be within even in truth, what
without he appears to be in show. This is that Ephesians. 6. 5.
Singleness of heart which is expressly required of servants, and may be
applied to wives, for indeed it appertains to all sorts. Because it is only
discerned by the Lord, who is the Acts 1. 24.
searcher of all hearts, it will move a wife to have an eye to him in all she
does, and to endeavor to approve her self to him above all: therefore
uprightness and walking before God are often joined together: he that is upright
will assuredly walk before God, that is, endeavor to approve himself to God,
as Genesis 6. 9.
Noah did, and as and 17. 1.
God commanded Abraham to do.

Though there were no other motive in the world to move her to subjection, yet
for conscience sake to Christ she should yield it. 1 Pet. 3. 5.
S. Peter testifies of holy women, that they trusted in God and were subject
to their husbands: implying thereby, that their conscience to God made them be
subject to their husbands. Was not Sarahs subjection seasoned with sincerity,
when Genesis 18. 12.
within her self, in her heart she called her husband Lord?

Great reason there is that wives should in sincerity subject Reasons for
sincerity.
themselves: for

1. In their subjection even to their husbands they have to 1 Because wives
have to do with Christ.
do with Christ, in whose room their husbands stand: so as, though their
husbands who are but men, see only the face and outward behavior, yet Christ
sees their heart and inward disposition: though their husbands see only the
things which they do before their faces, and can hear only of such things as
are done before others: yet Christ sees and knows the things that are done
in the most secret places that can be, when no creature beside themselves is
privy thereunto: Now let it be granted that in their outward carriage they
give very good contentment unto their husbands, and please them every way, yet
if sincerity have been wanting, with what face can they appear before
Christ? he will take another manner account of them: before Christ all their
outward complement will stand them in no stead at all.

2. Herein lies a maine difference betwixt true, Christian, 2. This makes a
difference betwixt holy women and others,
religious wives, and mere natural women: these may be subject on
by-respects, as namely, that their husbands may the more love them, or live the
more quietly and peaceably with them, or that they may the more readily obtain
what they desire at their husbands hands, or for fear of their husbands
displeasure and wrath, knowing him to be an angry, furious man, so as otherwise
it might be worse with them, they might want many needful things, or carry
away many sore blows if they were not subject. But the other have respect to
Christ's ordinance, whereby their husbands are made their head, and to his word
and will, whereby they are commanded subjection. Thus 1 Pet. 3. 5.
holy women subjected themselves; they cannot be holy that do not thus subject
themselves: for this is a sweet perfume that sends forth a good savor into
Christ's nostrils, and makes the things we do pleasant and acceptable to him.

3. The benefit of this virtue being planted in a wives heart 3. Great is the
benefit hereof.
is very great, and that both to her husband, and also to her self.

To her husband, in that it will make her manifest her respect of him before
others, behind his back, as well as before himself in his presence: and also
will make her faithful to him, and careful to do his will wheresoever he be,
with her, or from her.

To her self, in that it will minister inward sweet comfort unto her, though
her husband should take no notice of her subjection, or mif-interpret it, or
ill requite it; for she might say as Hezekiah did, Isa. 38. 3.
Remember o Lord how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect
heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.

That the Church does season all her subjection with sincerity is clear, in
that she is said to be Psalm. 45. 13.
all glorious within: (there is no glory within, without sincerity) and in
that she is often said Cant. 3. 1, 2.
to seek him whom her soul loved: if her soul loved him, in sincerity of
heart she was subject to him: Therefore as the Church is sincerely subject to
Christ, so let wives be to their husbands.

. 58. Of wives complementall subjection.
Contrary to sincerity is dissimulation, and mere outward, complementall
subjection: when a wife does even despise her husband in her heart, as Michal
did David and yet carry a fair 2 Samuel 6. 16. Pro. 30. 20.
face before him, as that adulterous woman, who eats, and wipeth her mouth,
and says I have not committed iniquity. Solomon makes it a note of a lewd
wife to flatter with her words. Pro. 2. 16.
Though such a wife should perform all the duties named before, yet would
those all be nothing to God, if they were done with a double heart, and not in
singleness of heart. For as many outward imperfections are pardoned by God,
where sincerity is, so no outward actions are accepted of him though they
seem never so fair, where there is no sincerity.

. 59. Of wives Treat. 4.. 65, 74.
cheerfulness in every duty.
III. Cheerfulness is more apparent then sincerity, and makes subjection
the more pleasing not only to God, but also to man, who by the effects thereof
may easily discern it.

For God, as he does himself all things willingly and cheerfully, so he
expects that his children should therein follow him, and thereby show
themselves his children. God loves a 2 Cor. 9. 7.
cheerful giver: not only a cheerful giver of alms, but of all duty to
God and man.

For men, it makes them also much better accept any duty when they observe it
to be done cheerfully: this did even ravish David with joy, to see his people
offer their gifts willingly 1 Chro. 29. 9.
unto the Lord: when an husband sees his wife willingly and cheerfully
perform her duty, it cannot but raise up love in him. This cheerfulness is
manifested by a ready, quick, and speedy performance of her duty. Sarahs
readiness to obey, Genesis 18.
shows that what she did, she did willingly.

That thus the Church subiecteth her self to Christ is evident by that which
David says, They shall be willing in the day Psalm. 110. 3.
of thy power. Therefore as the Church is cheerfully subject unto Christ, so
let wives be to their husbands.

. 60. Of wives sullen and forced obedience.
Contrary to this cheerfulness is the sullen disposition of some wives, who
will indeed be subject to their husbands, and obey, but with such a lowering and
sour countenance, with such powting and muttering, as they grieve their
husbands more in the manner, then they can be pleased with the thing it self
that they do: herein they show themselves like to a cursed cow, which having
given a fair soape of milk, casts all down with her heel, and so verify
the proverb, A good never a whit as never the better. Such subjection is in
truth no subjection, it can neither be acceptable to God, nor profitable to
their husbands, nor comfortable to their own souls.

. 61. Of wives Treat. 4.. 72.
constancy in doing their duty.
IIII. Constancy is a virtue which makes all the rest perfect, and sets the
crown upon them; without which they are all nothing. This is in those who
after they have begun well, continue to do well unto the end, and thereby
reap the fruit of all. It has respect both to continuance without
intermission, and also to perseverance without reuolting, and giving clean
over. So as it is not enough to be subject by starts and fits: one while
yielding all good obedience, another while stout and rebellious: neither is it
sufficient in former times to have been a good wife, and after prove bad: but
there must be daily proceeding and holding on from time to time, so long as
husband and wife live together. This grace was in her of whom it is said, She
will do him good, and not evil all the days of her life. Such were all the
holy wives commended in Scripture: among other particulars, mention is made of
the wife of Phinehas, who on her deathbed showed the reverend 1 Samuel 4. 21.
good respect she bare to her husband, though he were a wicked and lewd man.
This grace does the Church add to all her other virtues, she in all parts of
her subjection remains constant, and faithful unto the death, whereby it
comes to pass, that at length she receives the reward of her holy
obedience, which is full and perfect communion and fellowship with her spouse
Christ Jesus in heaven. In regard of her immovable constancy it is said, that
the gates of hell shall never prevail against Matthew. 16. 18.
her. Therefore as the Church is constantly subject unto Christ, so let wives
be to their husbands.

. 62. Of wives repenting their former goodness. Contrary, 1. Intermission.

Contrary to this Constancy is first intermission of duty, a returning to it,
and a leaving it off by turns: like one that is sick of an ague, sometimes
well, sometimes ill, one while hot, another while cold. That sometimes ceasing
takes away all the virtue, grace and glory, from sometimes doing. Besides, it
is twenty to one that through the corruption of nature, that diversity and
intercourse of fits at length will cease, and end in the worse. It is very
likely that Michal was such an one: for one while she showed her self so full
of respect to David, as 1 Samuel 19. 11, etc.
for his sake she incurred the King her fathers displeasure: another while in
her heart she despised him, and with her tongue 2 Samuel 6. 16, 20.
taunted him.

Contrary also to the forenamed Constancy is Apostasy, 2. Apostasy.
that is, a clean relinquishing of the former good course, as if a wife
repented her of her former good beginning. Such an one is she that is said to
for sake the guide of her youth, and forget the Pro. 2. 17.
covenant of her God. For ought we read to the contrary, Jobs wife was such an
one. And such are many who in their younger years, while their religious
parents lived (as Ioash while 2 Chronicles. 24. 2.
old good Iehoiada lived) have behaved themselves very well like good dutiful
wives, but being grown to elder years, have grown also so stout and
rebellious, as if they clean repented themselves of their former good
beginning. This revolt arises sometimes from the evil counsel of wicked
Gossips, and sometimes from their own proud humor. I may say of these wives
subjection, as the Prophet says of the righteousness of reuolters, Ezekiel. 18.
24.
their subjection shall not be remembered, but in their rebellion they shall
die. Therefore as the Church is subject to Christ, let wives be to their
husbands.

. 63. Of the Treat. 4.. 26.
extent of a wives obedience.
The extent of a wives subjection (which remains now to be handled) is set
down under these general terms (in every thing) which are not so generally
to be taken as if they admitted no restraint or limitation, for then would they
contradict such cautions as these, in the fear of the Lord, as to the Lord, in
Ephesians. 5. 21. and 22. Col. 3. 18.
the Lord. For man is so corrupt by nature, and of so perverse a disposition,
that often he wills and commands that which is contrary to Gods will and
commandment: which when he does, that Christian principle laid down as a
ruled case by the Apostle must take place, we ought rather to obey God then
men. Acts 5. 29.


Quest. Why then is this extent laid down in such general terms?
Answ. 1. To teach wives that it is not sufficient for them to obey their
husbands in some things, as they themselves think meet, but in all things
whatsoever they be wherein the husband by virtue of his superiority and
authority has power to command his wife. Thus this general extent excludes
not Gods will, but the wives will. She may do nothing against Gods will; but
many things must she do against her own will if her husband require her.

2. To show that the husbands authority and power is very large: it has no
restraint but Gods contrary command, whereof if a wife be not assured, she must
yield to her husbands will.

. 64. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 28, 29.
laboring to bring her judgment to the bent of her husbands.
From that extent I gather these two conclusions:

1. A wife must labor to bring her judgment and will to her husbands.

2. Though in her judgment she cannot think that most meet which her husband
requires, yet she must yield to it in practice.

In the former of these, I say not simply that a wife is bound to bring her
judgment to the bent of her husbands; for he may be deceived in his judgment,
and she may see his error, and then unless her understanding should be
blinded, she cannot conceive that to be true which he judges so: but I speak
of endeavor (when she has not sure and undeniable grounds to the contrary) to
suspect her judgment when its contrary to her husbands, and to think she may
be in an error, and thereupon not be too peremptory and resolute in
contradicting her husbands opinion. This submission even of her judgment
respects not only things necessary, for which her husband has an express
determinate warrant out of the Scripture, but also things doubtful and
indifferent: for even so far does this clause (in every thing) extend: and
the subjection of a wife respects not her practice only, but her judgment
and opinion also: which if she can bring to the lawfulness and meetnesse of
that which her husband requires, she will much more cheerfully perform it.
To this purpose (as I take it) may be applied that exhortation of the Apostle
unto women, that they learn in silence with all subjection: 1 Timothy 2. 11.
which though it be principally meant of learning in the Church, yet it
excludes not her learning at home of her husband: for in the next words he
adds, I suffer not a woman to usurp authority over the man, but to be in
silence.

. 65. Of wives ouerweening conceit of their own wisdom.
Contrary is the presumption of such wives as think themselves wifer then
their husbands, and able better to judge matters then they can. I deny not but
that a wife may have more understanding then her husband: for some men are very
ignorant and blockish; and on the other side, some women well instructed, who
thereby have attained to a great measure of knowledge, and discretion; but many
though they have husbands of sufficient and good understanding, wife and
discreet men, yet think that that which they have once conceived to be a
truth, must needs be so: and such is their peremptorinesse, that they will not
be brought to think that they may err: but say they will never be brought to
think otherwise then they do, though all the husbands in the world should be
of another opinion: not much unlike to the Wisemans fool, who thinks
himself wiser then seven men Pro. 26. 16.
that can render a reason.

. 66. Of a wives Treat. 4.. 27.
yielding to her husband in such things as she thinks not to be the meet est.
The latter conclusion concerning a wives yielding in practice to that which
her husband requires, though she cannot bring her judgment to think as he
does about the mee^nesse of it, Si res aliqua occurrat, quae consilio opus
habeat, quin ipsa quoque quid censeas di^ as minime prohibe^: sed viri tui
sententiam vim maiorem semper obtinere volo. Gre^. Naz. ad Olymp.
has respect to indifferent things, namely, to such as are neither in their
particulars commanded, nor forbidden by God: as the outward affairs of the
house, ordering it, disposing goods, entertaining guests, etc.

Quest. May she not reason with her husband about such matters as she thinks
unmeet, and labor to persuade her husband not to persist in the pressing
thereof, yea endeavor to bring her husband to see the vnmeetnesse (as she
thinks) of that which she sees?

Answ. With modesty, humility, and reverence, she may so do: and he ought to
hearken unto her, as the husband of the Shunemite did, 2. King. 4. 23, 24. but
yet, if notwithstanding all that she can say, he persist in his resolution, and
will have it done, she must yield.

First, her subjection is most manifested in such cases: herein she apparently
shows, that what she does, she does in respect of her husbands place, and
power: were it not for that, she would not do it. Other things are not so
evident proofs of her subjection to her husband: for if he command her to do
that which God has expressly commanded, and so she ought to do it, whether her
husband commanded it or no, it may be thought she does it on Gods command, and
not on her husbands. If her husband command her to do that which God has
expressly forbidden, then ought she by no means to yield unto it: if she do,
it may rather be termed a joint conspiracy of husband and wife together
against Gods will (as S. Peter said to Sapphira the wife of Ananias, How is it
that ye have agreed together to tempt the Acts 5. 9.
spirit of the Lord?) then subjection to the image of God in her husband.

Secondly, her yielding in indifferent things tends much to the peace of the
family, as subjects yielding to their Magistrates in such cases makes much to
the peace of the Common wealth. For in differencies and dissentions one side
must yield, or else great mischief is like to follow: now of the two, who
should yield but the inferior?

. 67. Of wives making their own will their law.
Contrary is the custom of many wives, who never will do any more then they
themselves think meet, though their husbands require it never so much: surely
they come far short of this Apostolical extent (in every thing) though in
their own eyes they may seem to be very much subject. But when wives will no
further be subject, then their own judgments, wills and affections concur
with their husbands, what can be thought but that they are subject rather to
their own wills, then to the will of their husbands? Many such wives, from the
least difference in judgment and opinion, even in the smallest matters, take
occasion to refuse subjection, and think they have warrant enough so to do:
whence oftentimes there arises much contention, the fault whereof lies
especially on the wives neck, though the occasion may arise from the husband:
and I think that wives themselves would so judge of the like cases betwixt
them and their children.

. 68. Of care in choosing such husbands as wives may without See Treat. 2.
Part. 1.. 11.
grief be subject unto.
Object. If the case be such betwixt man and wife, it is not good to marry.
Answ. This is no good inference; for all the seeming hardness of a wives case
is in the lewdness of an husband, who abuses his place and power: and not in
that subjection which is required by God. For if an husband carry himself to
his wife as Tutu^ obsequium est, quoties qui dux est, ipse Dei Spiritu ducitur.
God requires, she will find her yoke to be easy, and her subjection a great
benefit even unto her self. Wherefore I would exhort parties that are
unmarried, whether maidens or widows, to be very careful in their choice of
husbands: and in their choice to respect above all, their good qualities and
conditions, therein bearing the image of Christ, as well as in their office,
and authority: so as their wives may with joy and comfort, not with grief and
anguish, be subject unto them: then will subjection prove a vexation, when the
husband is an ignorant, profane, idolatrous, worldly, wicked man: wives of such
husbands are often brought into many straits. Ye widows and maidens who are
free, be not too free and forward in giving your consent to whom you know not:
among other motives, often think of this point of subjection, to which all wives
are bound: this I say, both of the several branches, and also of the extent
thereof. After you are married it is in vain to think of freedom from
subjection. By taking husbands, and giving your selves to be wives, you bind
your selves to the law of the man, as long as he lives. Then as you desire to
be accepted of God, and to find mercy and comfort from him, you must bear
this yoke, how heavy and grievous soever it seem to be.

. 69. Of the reasons to move wives to do their duties.
Hitherto of wives duties: The reasons noted by the Apostle to enforce those
duties now follow. They are laid down in these words.

EPHESIANS. 5. 22. -- As unto the Lord.

Verse. 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head
of the Church: and he is the Savior of the body.

Verse. 24. Wherefore as the Church is subject, etc.

THe maine ground of all the reasons which the Apostle here intimates, is
taken from the place wherein God has set an husband, which is first by
consequence implied in these words, as to the Lord: and then more plainly and
directly expressed in these, the husband is the head of the wife. The particle
prefixed before these words (for) being a causall conjunction, does show, that
they are here set down as a reason, which is first propounded under a metaphor
(head) and then amplified by that resemblance which an husband has therein
unto Christ (even as Christ, etc.) which resemblance is further commended by
the virtue and benefit that proceeds from the head-ship of Christ properly,
and of an husband also by consequence, in these words (and is the Savior of
the body.) Upon an husbands resemblance unto Christ, he infers that a wife
should have a resemblance unto the Church, and so concludes, Therefore as the
Church is in subjection to Christ, so let wives be to their husbands.

Out of the forenamed ground of a wives subjection, and the several
amplifications thereof, and the inference thereupon made, five several and
distinct reasons may be gathered to enforce a wines subjection to her husband.

The first is taken from an husbands place: he is in the Lords stead to his
wife (as to the Lord.)

The second from his office: he is an head to his wife.

The chird from the image he bears, or from the resemblance betwixt him and
Christ (even as Christ etc.)

The fourth from the benefit that his wife receives from him (he is the
Savior etc.)

The fifth from the example and pattern of the Church (as the Church is in
subjection, etc.)

70. Of an husbands place.
The place wherein God has set an husband as it serves 1. Reason.
to direct a wife in the manner of her subjection, whereof I have spoken. 51.
before, so also it serves to move a wife to yield such subjection as is
required: which will evidently appear by these two conclusions following from
thence.

1. A wife by subiecting her self to her husband, therein is subject unto
Christ.

2. A wife by refusing to be subject unto her husband, therein refuses to be
subject unto Christ.

That these two conclusions are rightly and justly gathered from the forenamed
ground I prove by like conclusions which the holy Ghost infers upon the like
ground. It is evident that Christ Jesus, even incarnat and made flesh, was in
the room and stead of his father, whereupon Christ said to Philip that desired
to see the father, he that has seen me has seen the father: Now mark what
Christ thence infers both on Ioh. 14. 9. Mat. 10. 40. Ioh. 5. 23.
the one side (he that receives me receives him that sent me) and on the
other (he that honors not the son, honors not the father that sent
him.) It is also evident that Ministers of the Gospel stand in the room and
stead of Christ: for thus says the Apostle of himself and other Ministers, we
are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in
Christ's stead, etc. Now mark again the conclusions inferred thereupon by
Christ, on the one side, he that hears Luke 10. 16.
you, hears me, and on the other, he that despises you, despises me. On
this ground it was that God said to Samuel concerning the people that rejected
his government, they have not cast thee away, but they have cast me away. 1 Samuel 8. 7.


To apply this reason, I hope such wives as live under the Gospel have so much
religion and piety in them as to acknowledge, it becomes them well to be
subject unto the Lord Christ Jesus: here then learn one especial and
principal part of subjection unto Christ, which is to be subject unto your
husbands: thus shall you show your selves to be the wives of the Lord Christ,
as the Apostle says of obedient servants, they are the servants of God. 1 Pet.
2. 16.


Again I hope none are so void of all religion and piety as to refuse to be
subject unto Christ: here then take notice, that if wilfully ye refuse to be
subject to your husbands, ye wilfully refuse to be subject to Christ: fitly on
this ground may I apply that to wives, which the Apostle speaks of subjects,
whosoever resists the power and authority of an husband, Romans 13. 2.
resists the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to
themselves judgment.

A strong motive is this first motive. If it were duly considered of wives,
they would more readily, and cheerfully be subject, then many are; they would
not so lightly think of their husbands place, nor so reproachfully speak
against Gods Ministers who plainly declare their duty unto them, as many do.

. 71. Of an husbands office.
The second reason is like unto this taken from an husbands 2. Reason. 1 Cor.
11. 3.
office, he is the wives head: which is also urged to this very purpose in
other places.

This metaphor shows that to his wife he is as the head of a natural body,
both more eminent in place, and also more excellent in dignity: by virtue of
both which, he is a ruler and governor of his wife. Nature teaches us that
this is true of the head of a natural body: and the Apostle by intituling an
husband, an head, teaches us that it is as true of an husband: whence it
follows, that it stands with common equity, and with the light of nature,
that the wife should be subject to her husband. This argument does the Apostle
in plain terms urge in another place, saying, does not nature teach you, etc.
1 Cor. 11. 14.


Go therefore, o wives, unto the school of nature, look upon the outward
parts and members of your bodies. Do they desire to be above the head? are
they loath to be subject unto the head? Let your soul then learn of your body.
Were it not monstrous for the side to be advanced above the head? If the body
should not be subject to the head, would not destruction follow upon head,
body, and all the parts thereof? As monstrous, and much more monstrous is it
for a wife to be above her husband: and as great, yea and greater disturbance
and ruin would fall on that family. The order which God has set therein would
be clean overthrown thereby: and they that overthrow it would show themselves
oppugners of Gods wisdom in establishing order. This reason drawn from nature
is of force to move very Pagans, and Savages to yield subjection, how much more
Christian wives, it being also agreeable to Gods word, and ratified thereby?

. 72. Of the resemblance betwixt Christ and an husband.
The third reason taken from an husbands resemblance unto 3. Reason.
Christ herein, adds an edge unto that former reason: in being an head, he is
like Christ. So as there is a kind of fellowship and copartnership betwixt
Christ, and an husband: they are brethren in office, as two kings of several
places.

Object. There is no equality betwixt Christ the Lord from heaven, and an
earthly husband: the disparity betwixt them is infinite.

Answ. Yet there may be similitude, resemblance, and fellowship: inequality is
no hinderance to these. Two kings may be more different in estate then a
subject and a king; yet those two kings brethren and fellows in office. There
may be a resemblance where there is no parity, and a likeness where there is
no equality. The glorious and bright Sun in the firmament, and a dim candle
in an house, have a kind of fellowship, and the same office, which is to give
light: yet there is no equality betwixt them. So then an husband resembles not
only the head of a natural body, but also the glorious image of Christ, and is
that to his wife which Christ is to his Church.

To apply this point, mark how from it two positions (worthy to be noted) do
arise.

1. Subjection is due to an husband as well as to Christ. Subjection due to an
husband as well as to Christ.


I say not as great, because of the difference in glory: but as well, because
of the likeness in office. A Constable (though a poor mean man) must be
obeyed as well as an high sheriff: A beggars child must obey his father, as
well as a kings child. Such wives therefore who are not subject, wrong their
husbands, as well as they wrong Christ who are not subject to him.

2. They who by their subjection maintain the honor of their husbands place,
maintain thereby the honor of Christ's place: and again by the rule of
contraries, They who by refusing to be subject impeach the honor of their
husbands place, impeach thereby the honor of Christ's place.

The obedience of a poor man's child or servant justifies that obedience
which kings children and servants owe their father and sovereign: and so on
the contrary, disobedience in mean ones, dishonors the place of great ones.

The argument of Memucan drawn from the greater to the Est. 1. 16.
less (in these words, Vashty the Queen has not done wrong to the king only,
but also to all the princes, and all the people) may be applied from the less
to the greater. Disobedient wives do wrong not only to their own particular
husbands, but also to all heads, even to Christ the head of the Church.

If a natural body, and the Church were flexible, and could be seduced, and
drawn to presume, and rebel against their heads, the ill example of wives
were enough to move them thereunto, for, as much as in them lies, they by
example seduce them.

From the last forenamed positions (viz. that the obedience of a good wife
maintains the honor of Christ's place, and on the contrary side that the
disobedience of an ill wife impaireth the honor thereof) I may justly infer
two other conclusions.

1. That Christ will assuredly reward the good subjection of Christ will reward
the good subjection, and revenge the rebellion of wives.
good wives: for he has said (and what he has said he can and will perform)
them that honor me will I honor.

2. That he will sorely revenge the rebellion of evil wives: for again he
has said, they that despise me, shall be despised.

We know that fellows in office are ready to stand for the 1 Samuel 2. 30.
credit of one another place, and to maintain the honor thereof: and that
not without good reason: for thereby they maintain their own honor and
credit.

Wherefore as good wives may well expect a reward at Christ's hands, howsoever
their husbands respect their obedience, whether well or ill: (a great
encouragement for wives to perform their duties, though their husbands be
never so ill) so evil wives have just cause to fear revenge at Christ's hand,
how soever their husbands bear with them.

They who duly weigh this reason taken from that resemblance which is betwixt
Christ and the Church, cannot but hold it to be a motive of great moment.

. 73. Of the benefit which a wife has by an husband.
The fourth reason taken from the benefit which a wife receives 4. Reason.
from her husband, does yet further press the point in hand. Though Christ be
properly the Savior of the body, yet even herein an husband carries a
resemblance of Christ, and is after a manner a Saniour: for by virtue of his
place and office he is on the one side her protector, to defend her from hurt,
and preserve her from danger; and on the other side, a pronider of all needful
and necessary things for her: in which respect she is taken from her parents
and friends, and wholly committed Genesis 31. 14.
to him: (as Iaakobs wives said, Have we any more portion or inheritance in our
fathers house?) yea she her self, and all she has is given to him: and he
again communicates what soever he has to her good, and for her use. David
compares a wife to Psalm. 128. 3.
a Vine, in relation to her husband: intimating thereby, that by him she is
raised to that height of honor she has, as a vine by the tree, or frame near
unto which it is planted. By his honor is she dignified, by his wealth is she
enriched. He is, under God, all in all to her; in the family he is a King to
govern and aid her, a Priest to pray with her and for her, a Prophet to teach
and instruct her. As the head is placed in the highest place over the body,
and understanding placed in it, to govern, direct, protect, and every way
seek the good of the body, and as Christ is united to the Church as a spouse,
and made her head, that she might be saved, maintained, and provided for by
him; so for this end was an husband placed in his place of superiority; and
his authority was committed to him, to be a Saniour of his wife. Wherefore if
none of the former motives prevail with wives, and move them to be subject to
their husbands, yet ought this.

For from this reason flow these two conclusions. 1. The subjection required of
a wife is for her own good. 2. In refusing to obey she shows her self both
ungrateful to her husband, and also injurious to her self.


That her subjection is for her own good, is evident by this A wives
subjection tends to her own good.
end for which an husband is made an head, to be a Saniour: not to puff him
up, to make him insult and tyrannize over his wife. So as if she be subject
unto him, she may reap much good from him. As the Church is wisely governed,
and safely protected by subiecting her self to her head Christ Jesus; and as
the body partaketh of much good, and is preserved from much evil by subiecting
it self to the head, so if a wife be subject to her husband, she will fare
much the better thereby, all the ease, profit, and benefit thereof will be
hers. If therefore she tender her own good, this is a way and means ordained
of God for this end; let her herein seek it.

If notwithstanding this she refuse to be subject unto her husband, does she
not (as we say) stand in her own light? She being by her sex the weaker, and
the more unable to help her self, ^f she shall reject this good help which
God has provided for her, is she not most injurious to her own self? And
considering Gratitude requires a wife to be subject.
the care and pains her husband undergoes for her sake, is it not most
unnatural and monstrous ingratitude, inwardly to de^pise, or outwardly to
scorn such an head? No better testimony ^f a grateful heart can be given by a
wife to her husband, then ^heerefull and ready subjection: and no greater
ingratitude can ^e showed, then rebellion, and disdain. Now among vices
in^ratitude is one of the most odious to God and man: so as both ^o avoid the
black spot of ingratitude, and to carry away the ^ame of gratefulness, ought
wives to be subject.

. 74. Of the example of the Church set before wines.
The last reason taken from the example of the Church is also 5. Reason.
^f good force to persuade wives unto subjection. Example more ^reuailes with
many then precept. If any example may be of ^orce, then this most of all: for
it is not the example of one only, ^ut of many; not of many ignorant, and
wicked persons, but of understanding, wise, holy and righteous persons, even
all the ^aints that ever were, are, or shall be: for the Church compriseth ^^l
under it, even that whole society of Saints, which are chosen of God in his
eternal counsel, redeemed of Christ by his precious blood, and effectually
called by the Gospel of faluation, Gods spirit working inwardly and powerfully
upon them, those very souls of just and perfect men now triumphing in heaven,
not excepted: note how this Church is described in the 26, and 27. verses. Let
this example therefore be often thought of: it will never repent any to follow
it: for it treads the only right path to eternal glory, whereunto they shall
assuredly come that follow it.

But to show the force of this reason a little more distinctly, note these two
conclusions following from it.

1. Wives are as much bound to be subject to their husbands, as the Church to
Christ. Else why should this example be thus set before them, and pressed upon
them? why are husbands set in Christ's stead, and resembled to him?

2. A wives subjection to her husband, answerable to the Churches subjection
unto Christ, is an evidence that she is of the Church, guided by the same
Spirit that the Church is. For it cannot be performed by the power of nature,
it is a supernatural work, and so an evidence of the Spirit.

Wherefore, o Christian wives, as your husbands by their place resemble Christ,
so do you by your practice resemble the Church. Of the two this is the more
commendable: for that is a dignity, this a virtue: but true virtue is much
more glorious then any dignity can be.

These reasons being well poised, and the force of them all joined together,
they cannot but work on the stoutest stomach that is: wherefore if this point
of subjection seem to be too bitter a pill to be well digested, let it be
sweetened with the syrup of these reasons, and it will much better be
swallowed, and have the more kindly work.

The fourth Treatise. Husbands Particular Duties.
. 1. Of the General Heads of this Treatise.
EPHESIANS. 5. 25, etc. Husbands love your own wives, even as Christ also loved
the Church, etc.
AS the wife is to know her duty, so the husband Husbands bound to duty.
Propterea debent mulieribus suis ad virtutis exemplum se praebere, quia viri
sunt. Aug. de adult. Coniug. l. 2. c. 8.
much more his, because he is to be a guide, and good example to his wife, he
is to dwell with her according to knowledge, (1 Pet. 3. 7.) the more eminent
his place is, the more knowledge he ought to have how to walk worthy thereof.
Neglect of duty in him is more dishonorable unto God, because by virtue of
his place he is 1 Cor. 11. 7.
the Imag eand glory of God, and more pernicious not to his wife only, but also
to the whole family, because of that power and authority he has, which he may
abuse to the maintenance of his wickedness, having in the house no superior
power to restrain his fury: whereas the wife, though never so wicked, may by
the power of her husband be kept under, and restrained from outrage.

Wherefore to go on in order, in laying down the husbands Husbands particular
duties.
duties (as we have the wives) we are to consider, 1. The Duties themselves. 2.
The reasons to enforce them.


In setting down the duties we must note 1. The matter wherein they consist.
2. The manner how they are to be performed.


The Apostle compriseth the whole matter of them all under Love, which is the
sum and head of all.

This we will first handle: and then proceed to other particulars.

. 2. Of that Treat. 3.. 2. 1. Husbands must love their wives.
love which husbands owe their wives.
This head of all the rest, Love, is expressly set down, and alone mentioned in
this, and in many other places of Scripture, whereby it is evident, that all
other duties are comprised under it.

To omit other places, where this duty is urged in Ephesians. 5. 25, 28, 33.
this place, Love is four times by name expressed, beside that it is intimated
under many other terms and phrases.

Whosoever therefore takes a wife, must, in this respect that she is his wife,
love her: as it is noted of Isaak (the best pattern of husbands noted in the
Scripture) Genesis 24. 67.
he took Rebekah, she was his wife ana he loved her.

Many good reasons hereof may be rendered. No duty well performed without love.


1. Because no duty on the husbands part can be rightly performed except it be
seasoned with love. The Apostle exhorts all Christians to do all their
things in love: much more 1 Cor. 16. 14.
ought husbands: though in place they be above their wives, yet love may not be
forgotten.

2. Because of all persons on earth a wife is the most proper 2. A wife the
most proper object of love. Deuteronomy. 13. 6.
object of love: nor friend, nor child, nor parent ought so to be loved as a
wife: she is termed, the wife of his bosom, to show that she ought to be as
his heart in his bosom.

3. Because his place of eminency, and power of authority 3. Love keeps a man
from abusing his authority.
may soon puff him up, and make him insult over his wife, and trample her
under his feet, if a entire love of her be not planted in his heart. To keep
him from abusing his authority is love so much pressed upon him.

4. Because wives through the weakness of their sex (for 4. Love makes him
bear with her infirmities. 5. His love draws love from her.
they are the weaker vessels) are much prone to provoke their husbands. So as
if there be not love predominant in the husband, there is like to be but little
peace betwixt man and wife. Love covers a multitude of imperfections.

5. Because as Christ by his love first manifested provoke the Church to love
him, so an husband by loving his wife should provoke her to love him again:
showing himself like the Sun which is the fountain of light, and from which
the Moon receives what light she has: so he should be the fountain of love
to his wife.

Object. Love was before laid down as a common duty appertaining both to man
and wife: how is it then here required as a particular and peculiar duty of an
husband?

Answ. In regard of the general extent of love it is indeed a common duty
belonging to the one as well as to the other, yea How love is an husbands
particular duty. 1 Cor. 13. 5.
belonging to all Christians, to all men: for it is the very nature of love,
and an especial property thereof, to seek not her own things, but the good
of others, which all are bound to do by virtue of the bond of nature; more
then others, Christians by virtue of the bond of the spirit: among Christians,
especially wives and husbands by virtue of the matrimonial bond: of married
couples, most of all husbands by virtue of their place and charge. Their place
is a place of authority, which without love will soon turn into tyranny.
Their charge is especially and above all, to seek the good of their wives: as
wives are the chiefest, and greatest charge of husbands, so their chiefest and
greatest care must be for them: the parents and friends of wives as they give
over all their authority to their husbands, so they cast all care upon them:
wherefore that husbands may take the more care of their wives, and the better
seek their good, they ought after a peculiar manner to love them. Husbands are
most of all bound to love: and bound to love their wives most of all.

Thus this affection of love is a distinct duty in it self, peculiarly Love a
common condition to be annexed to every duty.
appertaining to an husband: and also a common condition which must be annexed
to every other duty of an husband, to season and sweeten the same. His look,
his speech, his carriage, and all his actions, wherein he has to do with his
wife, must be seasoned with love: love must show it self in his commandments,
in his reproves, in his instructions, in his admonitions, in his authority,
in his familiarity, when they are alone together, when they are in company
before others, in civil affairs, in religious matters, at all times, in all
things: as salt must be first and last upon the table, and eaten with every bit
of meat, so must love be first in an husbands heart, and last out of it, and
mixed with every thing wherein he has to do with his wife.

. 3. Of an husbands hatred and want of love.
Contrary hereunto is hatred of heart: which vice as it is Contrary, 1. Hatred.
very odious and detestable in it self, so much more when the wife is made the
object thereof. As love provoke an husband to do his wife what good he can,
so hatred, to do her what mischief he can. Moses notes a man's hatred of his
Deuteronomy. 22. 13, etc.
wife to be a cause of much mischief: for the nearer, and dearer any persons
be, the more violent will that hatred be which is fastened on them.

Hence was it that a divorce was suffered to be made betwixt Deuteronomy. 24. 3.
a man and his wife, in case he hated her: which law questionless was made for
relief of the wife, lest the hatred which her husband conceived against her
should work her some mischief, if he were forced to keep her as his wife:
which Christ seems to imply in these words, Moses, because of the Mat. 19. 8.
hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wines. This therefore
being so pestilent a poison, let husbands take heed how they suffer it to soake
into them.

Neither is it sufficient for an husband not to hate his wife, 2. Want of love.
for even the want of love, though it be only a privation, yet is it a great
vice, and contrary also to the forenamed duty of love. Where this want of love
is, there can be no duty well performed, even as when the great wheel of a
clock, the first mouer of all the rest, is out of frame, never a wheel can be
in good order. They that think lightly hereof, plainly discover that there is
little or no love of God in them at all: for if the Apostles inference be good,
taken from a man's neighbor or brother whom 1 Ioh. 4. 20.
he has seen, it will much more be good having relation to a wife: for how
can he who loves not his wife, (whom God has given to him as a token of his
favor, and as an help meet for him, to be in his bosom, and ever in his
sight, yea to be no more two, but one flesh) love God whom he has not seen?
If any man says, he loves God, and hate his wife, he is a lier. Let husbands
therefore by loving their wives give evidence that they love God.

. 4. Of an husbands Treat. 3.. 9. Branches of love.
wise maintaining his authority.
All the branches which grow out of this root of love, as they have respect to
husbands duties, may be drawn to two heads: 1. A wise maintaining of his
authority. 2. A right managing of the same.


That these two are branches of an husbands love, is evident by the place
wherein God has set him, which is a place of authority; for the best good
that any can do, and so the best fruits of love which he can show forth to
any, are such as are done in his own proper place, and by virtue thereof. If
then an husband relinquish his authority, he disableth himself from doing
that good, and showing those fruits of love which otherwise he might. If he
abuse his authority, he turns the edge and point of his sword amiss: in
stead of holding it over his wife for her protection, he turns it into her
bowels to her destruction, and so manifests thereby more hatred then love.

Now then to handle these two severally, and distinctly:

I. That an husband ought wisely to maintain his authority, II. Husbands must
maintain their authority.
is implied under this Apostolical precept, Husbands dwell with your wives
according to knowledge, that is, as such as are well able to maintain the
honor of that place wherein God 1 Pet. 3. 7. (...).
has set you: not as sots and fools without understanding. The same is also
implied under the titles of pre-eminence which the Scripture attributes to
husbands, as Lord, Master, See Treat. 3.. 3. Reasons.
head, guide, image and glory of God, etc.

The honor and authority of God, and of his Son Christ 1. Gods authority
maintained by the husbands.
Jesus, is maintained in and by the honor and authority of an husband, as the
Kings authority is maintained by the authority of his Privy Council and
other Magistrates under him; yea, as an husbands authority is in the family
maintained by the authority of his wife: (for as the man is the glory of God,
so 1 Cor. 11. 7.
the woman is the glory of the man.)

The good of the wife her self is thus also much promoted, 2. The wives good
promoted thereby.
even as the good of the body is helped forward by the heads abiding in his
place; should the head be put under any of the parts of the body, the body and
all the parts thereof could not but receive much damage thereby: even so the
wife and whole family would feel the damage of the husbands loss of his
authority.

1. Quest. Is it in the power of the husband to maintain his own authority?
Answ. Yea, in his more then in any others: for note the It is in the man's
power to maintain his authority. 1 Timothy 4. 12.
counsel of the Apostle to Timothy, (though in another case, yet very
pertinent to this purpose) Let no man despise thy youth. It was therefore in
Timothies power to maintain his honor, and not to suffer it to be despised;
and so is it in an husbands power.

2. Quest. How may an husband best maintain his authority?
Answ. That direction which the Apostle gives to Timothy How a man's authority
may be well maintained. Ad viros pertinet virtute vincere, and exemplo regere
foemina^. Aug. de Adult. Coniug. lib. 2. cap. 8.
to maintain his authority, may fitly be applied for this purpose unto an
husband; Be an ensample in conversation, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in
pureness: as if he had said, If thou walk before them worthy of thy place and
calling, and worthy of that honor and respect which is due thereunto, showing
forth the fruits of love, faith, and other like graces, assuredly they will
reverence thy youth; but if otherwise thou carry thy self basely, and not
beseeming a minister, thou give them just occasion to despise thee. Even thus
may husbands best maintain their authority by being an ensample in love,
gravity, piety, honesty, etc. The fruits of these and other like graces
showed forth by husbands before their wives and family, cannot but work a
reverend and dutiful respect in their wives and whole house toward them: for
by this means they shall more clearly discern the image of God shine forth in
their faces.

Object. Very goodness and grace it self is hated of wicked and ungodly
wives: it was an act of piety that made Michal despise David.

Answ. 1. Grant it to be so: yet this may be a good direction for such husbands
as have not such wicked wives.

2. This does not always so fall our, no, nor yet for the most part in those
that are wicked; true virtue and integrity does often cause admiration in such
as love it not.

3. Though some be of so crooked and perverse a disposition as to take occasion
of contempt, where none is given, yet shall that husband justify himself
before God and man, that carries himself worthy of his place.

. 5. Of husbands losing their authority.
Contrary is their practice who by their profaneness, riotousnesse, Contrary,
1. base carriage
drunkenness, lewdness, lightness, unthriftiness, and other like base
carriage, make themselves contemptible, and so lose their authority: though a
wife ought not to take these occasions to despise her husband, yet is it a just
judgment on him to be despised, seeing he makes himself contemptible.

Contrary also to the forenamed directions is the stern, 2. Cruel dealing.
rough, and cruel carriage of husbands, who by violence and tyranny go about
to maintain their authority. Force may indeed cause fear, but a slavish
feate, such a fear as breeds more hatred then love, more inward contempt,
then outward respect.

And contrary is their servile disposition, who against their 3. Yielding in
unlawful things.
own judgment yield to the bent of their wives mind in such things as are
unlawful: they will lose their authority rather then give discontent to their
wives: which is a fault expressly forbidden by the Dent. 13. 6, 7.
law: and yet a fault whereinto not only wicked 1 King. 21. 7, 9.
Ahab, but also wise Solomon fell: how heinous a fault, and how grievous a fall
this was in Solomon, the fearful issue thereof shows. Like to him not in
wisdom, but in this point of egregious folly, are such as upon their wives 1
King. 11. 4.
instigation, suffer Priests and Jesuits, to lurk and celebrate Masses in
their houses, and yield to be present thereat themselves. Like to Ahab are such
Magistrates as suffer their wives to ouersway them in course of Justice: hence
it comes to pass that more petitions and suites are made to the wives of
Magistrates in the cases of Justice then to the Magistrates themselves: and the
favor of their wives is more esteemed then their own: so as the power of
governing, and the maine stroke in determining matters, is from their wives;
they are but the mouths and instrument of their wives, in so much as among the
common people the title of their places and offices is given to their wives.
Some husbands suffer this by reason of their fearful, and foolish
disposition, wanting courage and wisdom to maintain the honor of their
places against the insolency of their wives: others upon a subtle, covetous,
wicked mind, that by the means of their wives there may be more freedom for
receiving bribes. Among these I may reckon those who against their own mind,
to satisfy their wives mind, suffer both wives and children to follow the
fashion, to attire themselves unbeseeming their places, to frequent light
company, with the like; and also those who upon their wives importunity are
moved (as Sampson was) to reveal such secrets Maxim obseruate vos atque
attendite anim bus vestris o viri ab vxoris concitationibus atque malis
instigationibus, per hanc enim in vltimo supplantare Job visus est diabolus,
etc. per istas etiam nunc plurimos subuertit. Orig. in Ioh. lib. 2.
as are not meet to be known. Husbands may hearken to their wives moving good
things, but they may not obey them in evil things: if they do, their fault is
double: 1. in doing evil: 2. in losing their authority.

Let husbands therefore be very watchful against their wives evil
instigations. Satan labored to supplant Job by his wife: and by this does he
subvert many in these days.

. 6. Of husbands Treat 3.. 3. How a man's authority may be well managed.
high account of wives.
As authority must be well maintained, so must it be well managed: for which
purpose two things are needful: 1. That an husband tenderly respect his wife.
2. That prouidently he care for her.


An husbands tender respect of his wife is Inward. Outward.

Inward in regard of his Opinion of her. Affection to her.

Outward in regard of his carriage toward her.

For an husbands opinion of his wife, two things are to be weighed, Her place,
Her person.

1. Her place is indeed a place of inferiority, and subjection, yet the nearest
to equality that may be: a place of common Husbands must account their wives
yoke-fellowes. 1 Pet. 3. 7.
equity in many respects, wherein man and wife are after a sort even fellows,
and partners: Hence then it follows that

The husband must account his wife a yoke fellow and companion. This is one
point of giving honor to the wife: and it is implied under that phrase whereby
the end of making a wife is noted, Genesis 2. 18. (...)
which in our English is translated, meet for him, word for word as before him
that is, like himself, one in whom he might Ephesians. 5. 28. (...).
see himself, or even (to use our Apostles word) himself. These phrases imply
a kind of fellowship: as also the many prerogatives that are common to both,
which have been noted Treat. 3.. 4.
before.

As a wives acknowledgement of her husbands superiority is the groundwork of
all her duties, so an husbands acknowledgement of that fellowship which is
betwixt him and his wife, will make him carry himself much more amiably,
familiarly, lovingly, and every way as beseems a good husband toward her.

. 7. Of that fellowship which is betwixt man and wife, notwithstanding a wives
inferiority.
Object. Fellowship betwixt man and wife cannot stand with a wives inferiority
and subjection.
Answ. They are of very mean capacity that cannot see how these may stand
together. Is there not a fellowship betwixt superior and inferior magistrates
in relation to their subjects? yea the Scripture mentions a fellowship
betwixt Christ the head and other Saints in relation to the glory Romans 8. 17.
(...).
whereof all are made partakers (for it terms us joint heirs with Christ:)
and in relation to Gods people a fellowship betwixt God and his ministers (for
it terms them laborers together 1 Cor. 3. 9. (...).
with God) yet none can deny the Saints, and ministers to be inferior and in
subjection to Christ, and God. But distinctly to answer the objection.

1. There may not only be a fellowship, but also an equality in some things
betwixt those that in other things are one of them inferior and subject: as
betwixt man and wife in the power of one another bodies: for the wife (as well
as the husband) Vxor and serua and domina est viri, Chrysostom. in 1 Cor. 7. hom.
19.
is therein both a servant, and a mistress, a servant to yield her body, a
mistress to have the power of his.

2. There may be fellowship in the very same things wherein is inferiority: for
fellowship has respect to the thing it self, inferiority to the measure, and
manner: as in giving light the Sun and Moon have a fellowship, but in the
measure and manner the Moon is inferior: the Moon has not so much light as
the Sun, and that which it has it has from the Sun: and as in governing,
the king and other magistrates have a fellowship, but in the measure, and
manner of government they are inferior to him: Even so is it betwixt man and
wife, in many things wherein there is a fellowship, the wife is notwithstanding
inferior: so as inferiority may stand with fellowship.

3. There are no unequals betwixt which there is so near a parity as betwixt
man and wife: if therefore there may be a fellowship betwixt any that are
superior, and inferior one to another, then much more betwixt man and wife.

Debet in vxorem vir dominari, vt animus in corpus, co^sentiens ei, and
conspirans beneuolentia. Plut. praec. connub.
As the soul therefore rules over the body, by a mutual and loving consent
and agreement, so must a man over his wife.

. 8. Of husbands too mean account of wives.
Contrary is the conceit of many who think there is no Non es dominus sed
maritus: non ancillam sortitus es, sed vxorem: gubernatorem ^e Deus voluit esse
sexus inferioris, non praepotentem. Ambr. Hexaem. lib. 5. cap. 7.
difference betwixt a wife and servant but in familiarity: and that wives were
made to be servants to their husbands, because subjection, fear and obedience
are required of them: whence it comes to pass that wives are often used little
better then servants. A conceit and practice sauouring too much of heathenish,
and sottish arrogance. Did God at first take the wife out of man's side, that
man should tread her under his feet? or rather that he should set her at his
side next to him above all children, servants, or any other in the family, how
near, or dear unto him soever? for none can be nearer then a wife, and none
ought to be dearer.

. 9. Of husbands good esteem of their Treat 3.. 5. IIII. Husbands must account
their own wives best for them.
own wives.
2. For the person of a wife, An husband ought to esteem that particular
person to whom by Gods providence he is joined in marriage, to be the fittest,
and best for him. This is implied under that particle of restraint (OWN) noted
by the Apostle where he says Ephesians. 5. 25.
husbands love your OWN wives, and again presses it under a comparison of
the body (as Ves. 28.
your OWN bodies) Every one thinks his own body best and fittest for him. A
man might happily wish some defects or enormities in his own body to be
amended, and desire that his were like an others, more strait, strong, and
comely then his own, yet would he not have his head to be upon that other man's
body: the same opinion ought a man (that would love his wife) to have of her.

Good reason there is for him so to do: for true is the proverb, Reason.
Every ones wife is provided by God.
if it be rightly taken, marriages are first made in heaven, that is, God has
an ouer-ruling hand in ordering them: which Pro. 19. 14.
Solomon implies by that opposition which he makes betwixt wealth and a wife:
that is from our fathers, this from the Lord: in which respect he says, and
18. 22.
he which finds a wife receives favor of the Lord. If therefore thou art
loved of God, and love him, he will make thy wife prove a good thing to thee.

Object. A wife may be a very lewd and wicked woman: how then can she be
accounted the best wife?
Answ. 1. It may be she was good enough when first she was brought to thee, but
thou by thine evil example, or negligent government, or hard usage, have made
her so bad as she is. Which if it be so, then is she to be considered not as
thou have marred her, but as thou did marie her.

2. Though she be not in relation to other wives the best in condition, yet in
relation to thee she may be the best in event: if not for thine ease and quiet,
yet for trial of thy wisdom and patience: and so as Socrates interrogatus qua
gratia vxoris mores toleraret, respondit, vt gymnasium and palaestram
philosophiae domi habeam. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
a school of virtue she may be unto thee. As Ars tua Tiphy iacet si non sit in
aequore fluctus Ovid. de Trist. l. 4. eleg. 3.
a skillful pilots sufficiency is tried and known by tempestuous seas, so a
man's wisdom by a troublesome wife. Yea she may be given thee as a punishment
of some former sins, as seeking after a beautiful, honorable, rich, proper
wife, rather then a religious and honest one: or seeking her without any
direction or help first sought of God, or otherwise then thou have warrant
from God, as by stealth, and without parents consent; or some other sins in
another kind, to bring thee to repentance: or as a means to restrain and
weane thee from some future sins whereunto thou are subject, and so prove a
blessed cross to keep thee from a fearful curse.

. 10. Of husbands preposterous opinion of their own wives.
Contrary is a corrupt and perverse opinion which many have of their own
wives, thinking them of all other the worst and unfittest; yea though they be
such as every way both in gifts and qualities of mind, and also in grace and
comeliness of body deserve all good respect and esteem. Whereas others (which
look with a single eye) commend their good parts, they Misinterpret and
misiudge all: if their wives be religious, they think them hypocrites: if
grave, sober and modest, melancholicke: if cheerful, wanton: if they keep at
home, idle drones: if they take occasion (though never so just) of going
abroad, gadders, and lightfooted. This bad opinion of their wives is a cause
that their hearts are clean removed from their own, and set upon strange
flesh: whereby the devil gains what he desires, that is, to put asunder
such as God has joined together, and to join those whom God has put asunder.

. 11. Of husbands Treat. 3.. 7. V. Husbands must entirely delight in their
wives.
entire affection to their wives.
An husbands affection to his wife must be answerable to his opinion of her: he
ought therefore to delight in his wife entirely, that is, so to delight in her
as wholly and only delighting in her: In this respect the Prophets wife is
called the Ezec. 24. 16. (...)
desire, or delight, or pleasure of his eyes: that wherein he most of all
delighted, and therefore by a propriety so called.

Such delight did Isaak take in his wife as it drove out a contrary strong
passion, namely the grief which he took for the departure of his mother: for
it is noted that he Genesis 24. 67.
loved her, and was comforted after his mothers death.

This kind of affection the wiseman does elegantly set forth in these words,
Rejoice with the wife of thy youth: Let her Pro. 5. 18, 19. expounded.
be as the loving Hind, and pleasant Roe, and be thou ravished always with her
love. Here note both the metaphors, and also the hyperbole which are used to
set forth an husbands delight in his wife. In the metaphors again note both
the creatures whereunto a wife is resembled, and also the attributes given to
them. The creatures are two, an Hind and a Roe, which are the females of an
Heart and a Roe-Bucke: now it is noted of the Heart and Roe-Bucke, that of all
other beasts they are most inamored (as I may so speak) with their mates, and
even mad again in their heat and desire after them.

These metaphors has Solomon used to set forth that unfeigned and earnest,
entire and ardent affection which an husband ought to bear unto his wife:
which being taken in a good sense, and rightly applied, so as they exceed not
the bonds of christian modesty and decency, are very fit, and pertinent to the
purpose: if we stretch them beyond modesty, we wrong the penman of them, or
rather the Holy Ghost that directed him, and propound a pernicious pattern
unto husbands.

The attributes given to the forenamed creatures much amplify the point: the
former is termed a loving Hind, the latter (...) Col. 1. 13. (...).
a pleasant Roe, word for word an Hind of Loves, a Roe of favor, that is,
exceedingly loved and favored: (for to set forth the extent of Gods love unto
his Son, Christ is called the son of his love:)

These comparisons applied to a wife, do lively set forth that delight which
an husband ought to take in her, and yet is it much further amplified by the
hyperbole used in this phrase, be thou ravished with her love, word for word
err thou in her love, (...)
by which no sinful error, or dotage is meant, but a lawful earnest
affection: implying two things especially: First so far to exceed, as to make a
man ouersee some such blemishes in his wife, as others would soon epsy and
mislike: or else to count them no blemishes, delighting in her never a whit the
less for them. For example, if a man have a wife, not very beautiful, or
proper, but having some deformity in her body, some imperfection in her speech,
sight, gesture, or any part of her body, yet so to affect her, and delight in
her, as if she were the fairest, and every way most complete woman in the
world. Secondly, so highly to esteem, so ardently to affect, so tenderly to
respect her, as others may think him even to dote on her. An husbands
affection to his wife cannot be too great if it kept within the bonds of
honesty, sobriety and comeliness. The wives affection ought to be as great to
her husband, yet because of the husbands place of authority, he must especially
take all occasions to manifest this his inward affection. Read the Song of
Songs, and in it you shall observe such affection manifested by Christ to his
Spouse, as would make one think he did (with reverence in an holy manner to
use the phrase) even err in his love and dote on her. A good pattern and
president for husbands. For nothing is more lovely them a Nihil viro vxore bona
amabilius. Hier. in Ezec. 24.
good wife.

. 12. Of the Stoicall disposition of husbands to their wives.
Contrary is the disposition of such husbands as have no heat, or heart of
affection in them: but Stoick-like delight no more in their own wives then in
any other women, nor account them any dearer then others. A disposition no way
warranted by the word. The faithful Saints of God before mentioned, as also
many other like to them, were no Stoics, without all affection: nor did they
think it a matter unbeseeming them after a peculiar manner to delight in their
wives (witness Isaacks sporting with his wife) for this is a privilege which
appertains Genesis 26. 8.
to the estate of marriage. But that I be not mistaken herein, let it be noted
that the affection whereof I speak is not a carnal, sensual, beastly
affection, but such an one as may stand with Christian gravity and so briety:
having relation to the soul of a man's wife as well as to her body, grounded
both on the near conjunction of marriage, and also on the inward qualities of
his wife.

Thus far of an husbands inward respect of his wife. It follows to speak
of his outward carriage toward her.

. 13. Of an husbands Treat. 3.. 10.
kind acceptance of such things as his wife does.
S. Peter gives a general rule for an husbands outward carriage to his wife,
which is, that he dwell with her according to knowledge, that is, as a man able
to order his carriage wisely to his own honor and his wives good, that so she
may have just cause to bless God that ever she was joined to such an husband.

Out of this general these two branches sprout forth. 1. That an husband give
no just offense to his wife. 2. That wisely he order that offense which is
given by her.


To avoid giving of offense he must have respect, 1. To that which she does as
duty to him. 2. To that which he does as duty to her.


In regard of the former two things are requisite: 1. That he kindly accept
what she is willing and able to do. 2. That he wisely commend and reward what
she does well.


Thus having for orders sake laid down these heads, I will distinctly handle
the several points.

The first particular wherein an husband shows himself VI. Husbands must
kindly accept every good duty of his wife. Genesis 21. 8.
to be a man of knowledge in walking before his wife, is by a kind and
respective acceptance of every good duty which his wife performs. Abraham in
testimony of his good acceptance of Sarahs pains in nursing her child, made a
great feast when the child was weined: and Elkanah on a like respect gave
liberty 1 Samuel 1. 23.
to his wife to do what seemed her best.

A great encouragement must this needs be unto wives to be subject unto their
husbands in all things, when they observe no part of their subjection to be
carelessly neglected, but rather graciously accepted: it quickens the spirit of
a wife to think that her care and pains in pleasing her husband shall not be
in vain.

. 14. Of husbands sleighting and rejecting their wives goodness.
Contrary is their practice who thinking all which a wife Contrary, 1. To take
no notice of their wives goodness.
does to be but her duty, take little or no notice thereof; or if they cannot
but take notice of it, yet lightly regard it, and slightly pass it over. This
oftentimes makes a wife even repent the good she has done, as David repented
the service 2. Slightly to pass it over. 1 Samuel 25. 21.
which he had done for Nabal. The truth is that wives ought rather to look
unto God for his acceptance then unto their husbands: and though their
husbands will take no notice, or not regard what good thing they do, yet for
conscience sake, and for the Lords sake to do their duty: But yet
notwithstanding considering our weakness and backwardness unto every duty, it
can not be denied but that an husbands slight regarding of his wives goodness
is an occasion to make her weary thereof: and that he does as much as in him
lies to make her repent thereof.

But what may we say of such as scornfully reject their wives 3. Scornfully to
reject it.
duty, yea like them the worse for making conscience thereof, and so (clean
contrary to the rule of christianity) overcome goodness with evil? Surely
they show a very diabolical spirit Romans 12. 21.
to be in them: and cannot but minister much grief, and offense to their
wives, and make that which they do to be very irksome and tedious. Fathers
ought not to provoke their Ephesians. 6. 4.

For the better conceiving of this so needful a point I will How a man's good
acceptance of his wives duty is manifested.
somewhat more particularly and distinctly apply the same to the several
duties of a wife: which were drawn to two heads

Reverence. Obedience.

For the first, if a wife manifest her dutiful respect of her 1. By answering
reverence with courtesy. Depone asperitatem morum cum tibi sedula vxor
occurrit, etc. Ambr. Hexaem. lib. 5. cap. 7.
husband by any reverend behavior, gesture, or speech, he ought to meet her
(as we say) in the midst of the way, and manifest his gracious acceptance
thereof by some like courteous behavior, gesture, and speech, being seemly,
not foolish.

Object. Thus shall an husband abase himself, and disgrace his place.
Answ. The courtesy which I speak of as it comes from a superior, being a
mere voluntary matter and a token Courtesy may stand with superiority.
of kindness and favor, is no abasement of himself, but an advancement of
his inferior: a great grace to her, no disgrace to him. Abram was counted of
the Hittits a Prince of Genesis 23. 6, 7.
God, yet in communing with them he bowed unto them. It is noted as a
commendable thing in Esau, that though at that time he was his brothers
superior (at least he took himself so to be) yet observing how Iaakob
reverenced him, bowing seven times to the ground, he ran to meet him, and
embraced Genesis 33. 3, 4.
him, and fell on his neck. Most pertinent to the point is the example of King
Ahashverosh, who beholding Esthers reverend Esth. 5. 2.
standing before him, held out his Scepter unto her, which in a King is great
courtesy.

But to put the matter out of all question, let the example of Christ noted in
Salomons song be observed, and we shall find his courtesy every way answering
the reverence of his Spouse.

. 15. Of husbands too great loftiness.
Contrary is a lofty carriage of husbands to their wives, who ouerlooke all
reverence showed by wives, no more respecting their wives in this case, then
children or servants: or then Kings do respect the reverence of their subjects.

Often have I noted that there is a great difference betwixt a wife and all other
inferiors, in which respect all evidences of reverence should much better be
respected; yet we know that Kings and Queens will put out their hands to be
kissed by their subjects when they kneel before them, which is a token of
courtesy: how much more ought husbands to show courtesy? Unworthy they are to
be reverenced of their wives, who too Lord-like ouerlooke them.

ready yielding to their wives humble suits.
Again, it being a token of reverence in a wife humbly to 2. By granting her
humble request.
make known her desire to her husband, he ought to show so much courtesy as
readily to grant her desire: this courtesy the forenamed Est. 5. 3.
Ahashuerosh afforded to Esther: 1 King. 1. 28. etc.
David to Bathsheba: Genesis 28. 1.
Isaak to Rebekah: and 16. 6.
Abraham to Sarah, and many other husbands to their wives. and 21. 10. 11.
Abraham showed herein such respect to his wife, that though the thing which
she desired were grievous to him, yet he yielded to his wife.

Object. God first commanded him so to do.
Answ. This adds the more force unto the argument, showing that it is Gods
express will, that an husband should show this kind of courtesy to his wife.
Much more ought a man to do at his wives request then at any others, whether
friend, child, or parent: yea much more free, forward and cheerful ought he
to show himself in granting his wives request then any others: provided
notwithstanding that her desire be of that which may lawfully be granted: to
yield in things unlawful is to lose his authority, as was showed. 5.
before.

. 17. Of husbands harshnesse to their wives.
Contrary is the harshnesse of their disposition who yield to their wives
request as an hard-milch-cow lets down her milk, not without much ado:
whereby the grace of all their yielding is taken away. There can be no
courtesy in yielding, when it is against their mind and will forced from
them: their wives must ask, and entreat again and again, yea be forced to
use the mediation of others to persuade their husbands to yield to their
request before they will yield, if at all they yield. What is this but to
proclaim to all the world that there is no affection in them to their wives?
If a wives breath be strange to her husband, assuredly his heart is first
strange to her: which is the ready way to make him set his heart on strange
women.

. 18. Of husbands Treat. 3. 38, 39, etc. and. 43 44, etc.
forbearing to exact all that they may.
As a wives reverence so also her obedience must be answered with her husbands
courtesy. In testimony whereof, An husband 3. By accepting what she is willing
to do.
must be ready to accept that wherein his wife shows her self willing to
obey him. He ought to be sparing in exacting too much of her: in this case he
ought so to frame his carriage toward her, as that obedience which she
performs, may rather come from her own voluntary disposition, from a free
conscience to God-wards, even because God has placed her in a place of
subjection, and from a wiue-like love, then from any exaction on her husbands
part, and as it were by force.

Husbands ought not to exact of their wives, whatsoever 4. By forbearing to
exact too much.
wives ought to yield unto if it be exacted. They must observe what is lawful,
needful, convenient, expedient, fit for their wives to do, yea and what they
are most willing to do before they be too peremptory in exacting it. For
example.

1. Though the wife ought to go with her husband, and 5. By suffering her to

dwell where he thinks meet, yet ought not he (unless by virtue of some
urgent calling he be forced thereto) remove her from place to place, and carry
her from that place where she is well settled without her good liking. Genesis 31.

Iaakob consulted with his wives, and made try all of their willingness,
before he carried them from their fathers house.

2. Though she ought cheerfully to entertain what guests 6. By forbearing to

therein unto her: the greatest care and pains for entertaining guests lies on
the wife: she ought therefore to be tendered therein.

If he observe her conscionable and wise, well able to manage 7. By suffering

and order matters about house, yet loath to do any thing without his consent,
he ought to be ready and free in yielding his consent, and satisfying her
desire, as 1 Samuel 1. 23.
, Elkanah: and if she be bashful and backward in asking consent, he ought
voluntarily of himself to offer it: yea and to give her a general consent to
order and dispose matters as in her wisdom she sees meet, as the said Elkanah
did: (Do (says he to his wife) what seems thee good:) and Pro. 31. 11.

2. That he have a general oversight in all, and so interpose his authority as

lies principally upon him. 2. He shall give an account unto God for all things
that are amiss in his house.


3. The blame of all will also before men lie upon him.

But those two cautions provided, he ought together with his general consent
Pro. 31. 11.
put trust in his wife, (as Genesis 39. 6. Difference betwixt the trust put in a
wife, and in others.
Potiphar did in Joseph) making herein a difference betwixt a wife, and all
others whether children of years, friends, or servants whom he imployeth in
his affairs. Them in every particular he may direct for matter and manner, and
take a strait account of them for expenses laid out, or other things done:
because what they do is wholly and only for another. To his wife (who is a
joint parent of his children, and governor of his house, to whose good the
husbands wealth redoundeth, and in that respect does for her self that which
she does for her husband) greater liberty, and license must be given.

. 19. Of husbands too much strictness toward their wives.
Contrary is the rigor and austeritie of many husbands, who stand upon the
uttermost step of their authority, and yield no more to a wife then to any
other inferior. Such are they

1. Who are never contented or satisfied with any duty the In what things an
husband manifests too much strictness.
wife performs, but ever are exacting more and more.

2. Who care not how grievous and burdensome they are to their wives: grievous
by bringing such guests into the house as they know cannot be welcome to them:
burdensome by tu frequent, and unseasonable inuiting of guests, or imposing
other like extraordinary businesses, over and above the ordinary affairs of
the house. Too frequent imposing of such things, cannot but breed much
wearisomnesse. Unseasonable (as when the wife is weak by sickness,
childe-bearing, giving suck or other like means, and so not able to give that
contentment which otherwise she would) cannot but much disquiet her, and give
her great offense.

3. Who hold their wives under as if they were children or servants,
restraining them from doing any thing without their knowledge and particular
express consent.

4. Who are over busy in prying into every business of the house, and will
have their hand in all. Besides that such husbands afford no opportunity to
their wives of giving proof of that understanding, wit, wisdom, care, and
other gifts which God has endowed them withal, they take away that maine end
for which a wife was given a man, namely, to be a^ help. Such husbands cannot
but neglect other more weighty Genesis 2. 18.
matters, which more properly belong unto them. For observe it and you shall
find, that such husbands as are most busy about the private affairs of the
house appertaining to their wives, are most negligent of such affairs as
appertain unto themselves: they think they walk in integrity, but yet are
they not just nor wise therein: for the just man walks in HIS integrity, Pro.
20. 7. and 14. 8.
and the wisdom of the prudent is to understand HIS way: (i.) that integrity
which appertains to his own peculiar place; and his own way: but every
fool will be meddling, namely, with things not belonging to his place. and 20.
3.


5. Who are over suspicious of their wives, and thereupon over strickt in
taking account of them. S. Paul calls surmizes 1 Timothy 6. 4.
evil, and that not without just cause: for evil they are in their nature,
and evil in their effects, being occasions of many mischiefs: but in none so
evil as in husbands over their wives. If a wives fidelity (to whose good the
welfare of the family, and increase of the stock redoundeth as well as to the
husbands) be without just cause suspected, who shall be trusted? It is the
overthrow of many families, that servants are trusted, and not wives.

Thus far of an husbands kind acceptance of that which his wife is willing
and able to do.

. 20. Of Husbands encouraging their wives in good things.
The love which an husband owes to his wife, further re^uireth Husbands must
commend and reward good things in their wives.
that he wisely commend and reward what she has well ^one. That which the
Apostle faith of the Magistrates authority, may fitly be applied to an husbands
in relation to his wife, Do that which is good, and thou shall have praise of
the same. It is expressly noted in the description of a good husband, a Romans 13.
3.
that he praises his wife: and in that he says, Verse. 31.
Give her of the b Prou. 31. 28, 29.
^uit of her hands, it is implied also that he rewards her.

This is an undoubted evidence of his good acceptance of ^er duty, and a
further encouragement to stir her up to go on and continue in well doing. Yea
this is also an evidence of his by and delight both in her person, and also in
her well doing. (...) there be no delight in ones person, well doing will
rather stir up envy then joy: and they that envy a man's well doing, will never
commend, or reward him for it.

In an husbands commending of his wife this caveat must be put: that he so
order his commendation as it savor not of flattery, or dotage: nor yet Lege
apud T. Live. Dec. 1. l. 1. quid inde evenit, quod regij iuuenes suam quisque
vxorem miris modis laudare.
stir up lust or envy in others.

. 21. Of husbands ungrateful discouraging their wives.
Contrary is an ungrateful, if not envious disposition of such Quisque suam
laudot, studijs certamina crescunt. Ovid. Fast. lib. 2.
husbands, as passing by many good things ordinarily and usually every day done
by their wives without any approbation, commendation or remuneration, are ready
to dispraise the least slip, or neglect in them; and that in such general
terms as if they never did any thing well, so as their wives may well
complain and say as it is in the proverb,

Often did I well, and that hear I never:

Once did I ill, and that hear I ever.

Yet such will be ready to praise other men's wives, and up braid their own
wives with the examples of those other, when their own do far excel them
in all kind of goodness. What does this show but that either they take no
notice of their own wives goodness, or else by reason of the commonnesse
thereof little regard it? If their wives have not the more grace in them, this
disposition is enough not only to discourage them from doing any good duty, but
also to breed jealousy in them, and to alienate their hearts from them.

. 22. Of an husbands Treat. 3.. 10.
mildness.
Hitherto of that respect which an husband is to have of that duty which his
wife performs to him.

For avoiding just offense, an husband must further have good respect to that
which as duty he does to his wife. As kindly he must accept duty at his wives
hands, so mildly he must perform that Oportet virum praecsse vxori oblectando,
and indulgendo. Plut. praec. Connub.
duty which he owes to her.

This mildness is an especial fruit, and evidence of love, and a notable
means to take away all offense that otherwise might be taken from many things
which he does. Sugar and Honey are not more pleasant to the tongue, then
mildness to the heart; it causes such things as otherwise are irksome and
grievous to the soul, to be well taken and applied, even as bitter pills dipped
in sweet syrrop, or rolled up in the soft pap of an apple, are soon swallowed
down and well digested. If an husband desire to be accounted a servant of the
Lord he must learn this lesson: For the servant of the Lord must be gentle to
all men. If any other servant of the Lord, much more husbands: 2 Timothy 2. 24.
if to all men, most of all to their wives: and that in many respects. 1.
Because of the near union betwixt man and wife. 2. Because of the joint
authority she has with him over others: that herein he may be a president and
example to her. 3. Because of her weakness: glasses are tenderly handled: a
small knock soon breaks them.


. 23. Of husbands bitterness.
Contrary is bitterness, a vice expressly forbidden, and that in particular to
husbands. A vice that cannot stand with an husband-like love: whereupon the
Apostle commanding the one forbids the other, Love (says he) and be not
bitter. Nothing Col. 3 19.
more turns the edge of his authority, peruerteth the use of his government,
provoke the stomach of his wife, makes his words and deeds less regarded,
then bitterness. It is as gall and wormwood mixed with sweet and wholesome
meats, which causes that they cannot be well digested, but with violence are
spit out again so soon as ever they be tasted. Men in authority are much
prone hereunto: and therefore O husbands be so much the more watchful against
it, love your wives and be not bitter unto them.

. 24. Of the Treat. 3.. 13. 14. Wherein a husbands mildness is manifested.
Titles which an husband gives to his wife.
The forenamed mildness of an husband must be manifested in his Speech,
Carriage.

For so far as reverence extends it self in the duties of wives, must
mildness be extended in the duties of husbands.

Whether an husbands speech be to his wife before her face, or of her Of his
speech about her behind her back, See Treat. 2. Part. 2.. 36. The speech of
husbands to their wives sweetened with mildness.
behind her back, it must be sweetened with mildness.

1. For his speech to her, 1. The titles wherewith he calls her. 2. The
instructions which he gives her. 3. The commandments which he lays upon
her. 4. The reproves wherewith he checketh her, must all be mixed with
mildness.

Among other titles, the most ordinary and usual title (wife) 1. Mild and
kind titles.
is a mild and kind title, and least offensive of all other: if an husband
give any other title to his wife, it must be such an one as manifests
kindness, familiarity, love, and delight. Such are all the titles which
Christ gives to the Church, as Spouse, Love, Dove, with the like. I do not
deny but that in the Song of Solomon, and in other places of Scripture many
titles are given and speeches used by Christ to the Church which are not meet
to be used by husbands to their wives, because they are metaphorical, and
hyperbolicall: but yet in them all we may observe tokens of amiablenesse,
kindness, and mildness, which is the end for which I have alleged his
example.

But contrary are such titles as on the one side set the wife Contrary,
unseemly titles.
in too high a place over her husband, as Lady, Mistress, Dame, Mother, etc.
And on the other side set her in too mean a rank, as woman, wench, etc. And
their Christian names contracted, as Sal, Mal, Besse, Nan. etc. and names of
kindred, as Sister, and Cosen: and, opprobrious names, as stut, drab, queant;
and names more befitting beasts then wives, as Cole, Brown, Muggle, etc.

Object. These are titles of mildness, kindness, and much familiarity: for
husbands call their wives by these names, not when they are angry with them and
displeased, but ordinarily, and usually, even when they are best pleased.

Answ. The mildness and familiarity which is required of an husband must be
such as may stand with his authority and place of eminency (as some of those
names do not,) and with that near conjunction which is betwixt man and wife
about all others (as other do not,) and with Christian gravity and discretion
(as other do not.) Christians therefore must take heed that by their practice
they justify not corrupt customs.

. 25. Of an husbands manner of instructing his wife.
2. To instruction the Apostle expressly annexeth meekness, Instruction to be
given with meekness.
Instruct (says he) with meekness, those that oppose themselves. If
ministers must use meekness when they instruct their people, much more
husbands when they instruct their wives: if 2 Timothy 2. 25. (...).
in case of opposition meekness must not be laid aside, then in no case, at
no time.

In this case to manifest meekness, let these rules be observed. Directions
to instruct with meekness.


1. Note the understanding and capacity of thy wife, and accordingly fit thine
instructions: if she be of mean capacity, give precept upon precept, line upon
line, here a little and there a little: a little at once often given (namely
every day something) will arise in time to a great measure, and so arise, as,
together with knowledge of the thing taught, love of the person that teaches
will increase.

2. Instruct her in private betwixt thy self and her, that so her ignorance
may not be blazed forth: private actions passing betwixt man and wife are
tokens of much kindness and familiarity.

3. In the family so instruct children and servants when she is present, as she
may learn knowledge thereby: there can be no more meek and gentle manner of
instructing, then by one to instruct another.

4. Together with thy precepts mix sweet and pithy persuasions, Contrary,
harshnesse.
which are testimonies of great love.

Contrary is an harsh and rough manner of instructing, when husbands go about
to thrust into their wives heads, as it were by violence, deep mysteries which
they are not able to conceive, and yet if they conceive not, they will be angry
with them, and in anger give them evil language, and proclaim their ignorance
before children, servants, and strangers. This harshnesse is ordinarily so
fruitless, and withal so exasperateth a woman's spirit, as I think he were
better clean omit the duty then do it after such a manner.

. 26. Of an husbands manner of Treat. 3.. 43, 51, 52. 63, 64. etc.
Commandments to be ordered with mildness.
commanding his wife any thing.
3. The commandments which an husband gives to his wife, whether they be
affirmative (bidding her to do something) or negative (forbidding her to do
this or that) must all be seasoned with mildness. For which end respect must
be had to the matter and manner of his commandments.

In regard of the matter the things which he commands What things he may
command his wife.
his wife to do, must be 1. Such as are indeed lawful and honest. 2. Such as
she is persuaded to be so. 3. Such as beseem her place. 4. Such as are of
weight and moment.


And on the contrary, the things which he forbids must be 1. Such as are
indeed unlawful to be done. What things he may forbid his wife.
2. Such as he can evidently prove unto her to be unlawful. 3. Such as are
unbeseeming her place. 4. Such as will have some evil and mischievous effect
if they be done.


1. To command a thing unlawful, or forbid a thing which ought to be done, is
to bring his own authority into opposition with Gods: in which case he
brings his wife into this strait, either to reject Gods commandment or his.
How then can she think that her husband loves her, when he brings her into
such snares and straits, that she must needs fall into the gulf of Gods
displeasure, or knock against the rock of her husbands offense? Mildness is
far from such commandments.

2. The like may be said of such things as to a wives conscience Such things as
a wife makes doubt of, not to be pressed upon her.
seem to be sinful, if they be enjoined to her; or her bounden duty, if
they be forbidden: especially if she have any ground for her conscience out of
Gods word. The conscience is subject to God alone: if it be forced it will be a
fearful horror, and a very hell in that party whose conscience is forced: She
that doubts is condemned if she do that whereof Romans 14. 23.
she makes doubt.

1. Object. In doubtful matters the commanding power Of what doubtful things
the commanding power of a governor may be a warrant.
of a governor is sufficient warrant and ground to resolve the conscience of
them that are under authority.

Answ. 1. In things merely doubtful concerning which the party in subjection
has not warrant out of Gods word one way or other, it may be so. But when the
conscience does not doubt and hang in suspense, but is out of some ground taken
from Gods word persuaded that that which is commanded is unlawful, or that
which is forbidden is a bounden duty, then to do this, or to leave that
undone, is to the party so persuaded a sin: and this is the doubting (whereof
the Apostle speaks) that condemns a man. In this case to urge a wife to do
this, or not to do that, is to urge her to sin: which a mild spirit and
loving heart will not do.

2. Though the husbands command be sufficient warrant to the wife, and if he
peremptorily press her to this or that, she ought to yield, yet the love and
mildness required of an husband should make him so to tender her as to remit
something of his power, and when he sees her conscience troubled about his
command, to relieve her conscience by for bearing to press that which seems
so burdensome to her. A husband may sin in pressing that too much upon his
wife, which she upon his pressing may without sin yield unto.

. 27. Of an husbands Treat. 4.. 66.
wise carriage when his wife is erroneeusly scrupulous.
2. Object. What if an husband upon his knowledge observe his wife to be
erroneously scrupulous, and to misinterpret and misapply the word of God which
she makes the ground of her scruple?

Answ. He must first labor to resolve her conscience by a plain discovery of
her error; which is a true and a great token of love: if notwithstanding all
that he can do in that kind she cannot be brought to yield to that which he
would have, then he must carefully observe these two things. 1. Whether her
refusing to yield, be an obstinacy, or weakness. 2. Whether it be about a
slight or weighty matter.


By the reasons which she renders, and her manner of pressing How a wives
refusing to yield may be discerned to be on obstinacy or weakness.
them, he may discern whether weakness or obstinacy make her stand out
against him: if the reason which she rests on taken from Gods word be
doubtful, and to one that has not a good sound judgment, and a sharp
discerning wit, it may appear to make something for her, it is to be
presupposed that there is more weakness then stoutnesse in her. But if she
can render no good reason, but only take every show that any way seems to
incline to her words, and peremptorily holds the conclusion, and stiffly
stands on her own resolution, though the vanity of her pretenses be
evidently discovered to her, so as she has not any thing further to object; or
if she render no reason at all but her own thought, conceit and will, and yet
refuses to yield, surely obstinacy possesses her heart. In case of obstinacy
it is very expedient that an husband stand upon his power to maintain his
authority, and by the best wisdom he can (using only such means as are
lawful) bring her to yield from her stoutnesse to that which he requires:
especially if the matter be weighty: as in case a religious man have been
married to a Popish wife, and she by no reason will be moved to forbear going
to Mass, or yield to go to the preaching of the Gospel. But if through
weakness she cannot be persuaded of the lawfulness of that her husband
requires, and the matter required be of no great consequence, nor the
weakness of her conscience cause any great error, an husband ought so far
to manifest his mildness as to forbear to press her conscience.

. 28. Of an husbands Treat. 3.. 43, 44. etc.
forbearing to press things unbeseeming a wives place.
3. Things unbeseeming the place of a wife are dishonorable unto her: for an
husband to urge his wife by strict charge to do them, implies more
rigorousnesse then mildness. Had the spirit of that stout Monarch Ahashuerosh
been more mild toward his wife, he would not have so far pressed his wife
unto so unseemly a thing as he did, namely, to come before all his Princes and
people to make show of her beauty. It is true indeed (as we showed Treat. 3..
28.
before) that she offended in refusing to yield thereunto, he peremptorily
requiring it; but that offense on her part does not justify his fact, and free
him from all blame: it is noted, that he was merry with wine, when he gave that
commandment, Est. 1. 10.
whereby is intimated, that his practice was more beseeming a drunken, then a
sober man: such is their practice who exact of their wives to do such
businesses as beseem maid-seruants rather then wives, or strumpets rather then
honest women; as to go to tauernes, alehouses, play houses, and such places
where light companions be.

. 29. Of an husbands pressing his authority in weighty matters.
4. To use a man's authority about weighty matters, matters of moment, makes
it to have such weight in it, as it will much better be regarded: for thus a
wife will either be brought to yield unto that which is commanded, or to
condemn her self for not yielding: yea thus a wife may see, that it is not
his own will so much which makes him to use his authority in commanding, as
the necessity of the thing it self, which redoundeth especially to her good
that does it: for the performance of a duty is for the most part most
aduantageable to the party that performs it, so as hereby an husband shows
love to his wife in pressing that which he presses.

This token of love that it may the better appear, it is behouefull Reasons of
pressing a commandment to be rendered.
that an husband add to his commandment just and weighty reasons, that
thereby his wife may the better discern the meetnesse, lawfulness,
expediencie, and necessity of the things commanded. We know that all the
things which God commands are weighty and necessary: yea his will (being
the very rule, and ground of all goodness) makes things absolutely
necessary, yet unto his commandments he uses to add weighty reasons;
showing on the one side the benefit and blessedness that will come to such as
obey his commandments; and on the other side, the mischief and misery that
will fall on their pates who refuse to obey; whereby he shows the great good
respect which he bears to us, and the earnest desire he has of our good.
Thus may an husband even in his commandments show much love and kindness.

. 30. Of husbands too great pride in commanding.
Contrary is the peremptory pride of husbands, when they will have their own
will done: it booteth not whether the thing commanded be lawful or unlawful,
whether their wives consciences can yield unto it or no, whether it stand with
the honor of their places or no, and whether it be weighty or light; their
will it is it should be done, and done it shall be, there is all the reason
they will give. Some think it a glory to command what they list; and think
that there is no proof of their authority, and of their wives subjection, but
in such things as upon their own will, without any further ground or reason,
they command. If such husbands meet with confronts; if though they command
much, they find not answerable performance; they may thank themselves, who
run the ready course to have their authority contemned and even trodden under
foot.

. 31. Of husbands rare and mild using their commanding power.
Respect must be had by husbands to the manner of using their authority in
commanding as well as to the matter.

In regard of the manner his commandments must be 1. Rare, not too frequent.
2. By way of entreating, not too peremptory.


Authority is like a sword, which with over much using will 1. Commanding must
be rare.
be blunted, and so fail to do that service which otherwise it might when
there is most need. A wise, grave, peaceable man, may always have his sword in
readiness, and that also very bright, keen, and sharp: but he will not be
very ready to pluck it out of his scabberd; he rather keeps it for a time of
need, when it should stand him in most steed. Such husbands therefore as are
too frequent in their commands, show themselves nor grave, nor wise, nor lovers
of peace.

As the use of an husbands authority in commanding must be 2. Commanding must
be by way of entreating. Philem. 9.
rare, so when there is occasion to use it, it must be with such mildness and
moderation tempered, so as (according to Saint Paul's example) though he have
power to command that which is convenient, yet for loves sake he rather entreat
it. Note how mildly Abram frames his speech to his wife, Say I pray thee Genesis
12. 13.
(says he) thou art my sister. Though the thing he required favored of too
much weakness, yet his manner of requiring it was well beseeming a kind
husband.

. 32. Of husbands insolency and peremptorinesse.
Contrary is the insolency of many, who cannot speak to their wives, but in
commanding-wise. Their authority is like a swaggerers sword, which cannot long
rest in the sheath, but upon every small occasion is drawn forth. This
frequent use of commanding, makes their commandments naught regarded. The
like may be said of them who are too peremptory in commanding: there must be
no saying of nay, to that which they say: upon command they will have their
mind done, and no other way: no persuasion, no entreaty shall be used: they
will rather not at all have their will done, then not upon absolute command:
nay they will not suffer others, in case of any refusal, to entreat, or
persuade, but will try what absolutely they can do by authority. Thus as by
trying to bend steel how far it will go, it often breaks; so by putting
their authority to the uttermost trial, they often lose all their authority:
in which case the mends (as we speak) is in their own hands.

. 33. Of an husbands Treat. 3.. 47. Husbands ought to reprove.
reproving his wife.
4. The authority and charge which God has given to an husband over his wife,
do require that as good and just occasion is offered, he should reprove her:
for this is an especial means to draw her from those sins, wherein
otherwise she might live and lie, yea and die also; and so live, lie, and die
under Gods wrath: out of which misery and wretchedness to free a wife, is as
great a token of love, as to pull her out of the water when she is in danger of
drowning, or out of the fire when she is in danger of burning. Solomon thus
styles reproves, Pro. 15. 31.
reproves of life, and expressly notes and 6. 23.
reproves to be the way of life, a means to breed and preserve spiritual
life, and to bring one unto eternal life, and so to escape death and
damnation. In these respects rebukes are called a precious balm, or excellent
oil, which may heal a wound, but make none: it Psalm. 141. 5. See the fruits
of reproof, Treat. 3.. 47.
breaks not the head, as the Psalmist speaks. Upon this ground, no doubt,
it is noted of many good husbands, who were without all question, loving,
kind, meek, and mild husbands, that they reproved their wives: as Genesis 30. 2.
Iaakob, Job 2. 10.
Job, 2 Samuel 6. 21, 22.
David, and others.

. 34. Of neglecting reproof.
Contrary is a servile and timorous mind of many husbands, who are loath to
offend, and (as they think) to provoke their wives; and thereupon choose rather
to let them continue in sin, then tell them of it. Wherein they both
dishonor their place, and the image of God, which by virtue of their place
they carry, and also in effect and in truth hate their wives; which the Law
implies, where it says, Thou shall not hate thy brother in thine heart,
Leuit. 19. 17.
but shall plainly rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him.

. 35. Of Treat. 3.. 47 An husbands reproof must be sweetened with mildnes.
well ordering reproof in the matter thereof.
That an husband may evidently demonstrate that his reproving of his wife is
indeed a fruit of his love, he must have an especial care to sweeten it,
especially with mildness: for it is the bitterest pill that by an husband can
be given to a wife. It is a verbal correction, and in that respect a middle
means (as I may so speak) betwixt admonition and correction; partaking
somewhat of both: it goes no further then words, and so is an admonition: the
words of a reproof are sharp, and so it is a correction: though it be but a
mild correction, yet it is a sharp admonition; and all the correction which
by himself an husband can give his wife: for we shall. 44.
after show that he may not proceed to blows, and strokes.

To sweeten reproof with mildness respect must be had (as before was noted of
commanding) both to the matter, and also to the manner thereof.

The matter of reproof must be Matter of reproof. 1. Just.
1. Just. 2. Weighty.

Justice requires that it be a truth, and a known truth, even a thing whereof
he is assured, for which he reproves his wife. Christ in giving direction for
reproving aright, lays down this as a ground, If thy brother shall
trespass, etc. a trespass Matthew. 18. 15.
therefore must go before reproof: where no trespass is, there reproof is
unjust.

Again, the Apostle advises that an accusation should not 1 Timothy 5. 19.
be received but under two, or three witnesses; whereby he implies that a
light report must not be received, but where blame is laid, there must be two
or three witnesses to confirm it, so as he that censureth may have good and
sure ground for that which he does: indeed that advise was in particular given
about an elder, but from the less to the greater it will follow to be a good
advise concerning wives: for no kind of person must be more wary in laying
blame upon another and reproouing for the same, then an husband on his wife.

Equity further requires that the matter for which an husband 2. Weigh. y.
reproves his wife be weighty; namely for some fault that is dangerous to her
soul, hurtful to their estate, contagious by reason of ill example to
children, and others in the family, but most of all for sin against God which
provoke his wrath, and pulls down his heavy curse upon him, her, and the
whole family.

When that for which a wife is reproved is a truth, a known truth, and a
weighty truth, the husband in performing this duty justifies his deed,
shows that there was need thereof, and so gives evidence of his love, makes
his reproof to pierce the more deeply, and so makes her the more ashamed of
her fault; whence it will follow, that either she will amend her fault or at
least will have her mouth stopped, so as she shall have nothing to except
against it. The reproof of the three Saints before mentioned, Genesis 30. 2.
Iaakob, Job 2. 10.
Job, and 2 Samuel 6. 21, 22.
David, were answerable to these points of Justice and wisdom: and the effects
thereof answerable to those which we have noted in this reason, as the silence
of the three wives implies: for none of them replied again.

. 36. Of undue reproof.
Contrary to the forenamed Justice and equity are ouerlight Contrary, 1.
Credulity.
credulity and undue suspicion. Credulity is when credence is given to every
light report, and thereupon blame laid upon the wife before any just proof be
made of that for which she is blamed: whereby it often comes to pass, that she
is wrongfully and unjustly blamed: which if she be, what good fruit can proceed
from such reproves? yea what evil fruits are not like to proceed from thence,
as secret discontent (if not malice and hatred) and open contentions and
brawlings?

The like may be said of light and causeless suspicion, which 2. Suspicion.
is the mother of jealousy, and the very bane of marriage, from whence the
devil takes great advantage against them both, seeking thereby to unloose
that knot which God has so firmly knit betwixt them. Suspicion to the mind is
as a colored glass to the eye, which represents things to the sight not as
indeed they are in their own true color, but as the color of the glass is.
Suspicion will make a man pervert every thing that his wife does, and blame her
many times for such things as are praiseworthy: in which case what can be
thought, but that an husband seeks advantage against his wife, rather then
any good unto her?

If to those two forenamed vices (credulity and suspicion) he 3. Rashness.
^dde rashness and hastiness in reproving, and make every ^mall and light
matter which any way he disliketh, matter of reproof, does he not proclaim to
all that shall know it, that he loves chiding more then he loves his wife? Yea
is not this the ready way to make all his reproof (if not scorned) lightly
regarded? What then will be the profit of them?

. 37. Whether an husband may reprove his wife for such things as he is guilty
of.
To the matter of reproof some add, that an husband ought not to reprove his
wife for that fault whereof he himself is guilty: but I make doubt of this
direction. I deny not but that he ought to have an especial care that he be
not guilty of that crime for which he blames his wife; otherwise, 1. he
blunteth the edge of his reproof, so as readily it cannot pierce into her
heart. 2. He causes it to rebound back again upon himself with these
reproaches, Physician healethy Luk 4. 23. Mat. 7. 5. Romans 2. 21. Romans 2. 1.
self: Hypocrite first cast the beam out of thine own eye. Thou that
teach another teach thou not thy self? 3. He is an heavy witness
against himself; for in that he judges another he condemns himself. But
thereupon to infer, that because he is guilty of such vices as are in his
wife, he ought not to reprove her though she be worthy to be reproved, is
scarce sound and good divinity: for thus he makes himself guilty of a double
fault, one of committing the sin himself, the other of suffering his wife to
lie therein: whereas if he reproved his wife, he might thereby reclaim both
her and himself: for I doubt not but his reproving of his wife would strike
deeper into his own conscience then if a third should reprove them both. How
were Judah and David stricken to Genesis 38. 26. 2 Samuel 12. 13.
the heart after they had given sentence against such crimes as they themselves
were guilty of? It is a good advice that no man be guilty of that which he
reproves in his wife, but it is no good rule to say, no man ought to reprove
his wife of that whereof he is guilty.

. 38. Of well ordering reproof in the manner thereof,
Like directions to those which were given for the manner Manner of reproving.
of commanding must be observed in the manner of reproving.

Reproves therefore must be Rare. Meek.

When reproves are seldom used, not but upon urgent and 1. Seldom.
necessary occasion, 1. It shows that an husband takes no delight in
rebuking his wife, but is even forced thereto. 2. It makes his wife much more
regard it. 3. It is like to work a more perfect cure, for seldom and rare
reproves do commonly pierce most deeply.

Contrary is continual chiding, and finding fault with a Contrary, continual
chiding.
wife for every thing amiss: if not only the wife her self, but a child, or
servant, or any else in the house do amiss, the wife shall be blamed for it.
This is too common a fault in husbands: whereby they much provoke their wives;
yea and many times make them no more regard a reproof then any other word. For
as birds which always abide in Belfries where much ringing is, are not a whit
afrighted with their loud sound; so wives who have their ears from time to
time filled with their husbands rebuke, by use are brought, nothing at all to
be moved therewith.

2. That a reproof must be given in meekness is clear by 2. Reprove mildly.
Gal 6. 1.
the Apostles general precept of restoring one in the spirit of meekness: for
a right manner of reproving is thereby particularly intended. Now of all with
whom we have to do, no fitter object for meekness then a wife, who in a more
peculiar manner then any other is thine own flesh.

Meekness has respect both to secrecy of place, and to softness of words.

When an husband is alone with his wife, then is the fittest 3. Reprove in
secret. Mat. 18. 15.
season for reproof: thus will reproof be answerable to Christ's direction:
tell him his fault between thee and him alone (says Christ of a brother:) but
no brother must be tendered more then a wife. Thus will it also soake better
into her soul, when no conceit of dishonor and discredit shall arise up to
hinder the work of it: which conceits will be ready to arise when a reproof
is given in public before others. Thus likewise will occasion be taken away
from children and servants of despising her: which otherwise they would quickly
take, ^f before them she should be rebuked; gathering from thence, that she is
kept under as much as they: now because she is with him a joint governor of
them, he ought by all means to maintain her reputation before them.

1. Quest. What if she regard not a rebuke in secret? Direction for reproving
such a wife as regards not a secret reproof. Mat. 18. 15.

Answ. He may follow Christ's direction, Take one or two more, namely wise,
grave, faithful friends, if it may be, of her kindred, as her parents (if she
have any living) or such as are in course of nature next to parents (if they be
not partial on her side) and before them rebuke her: but by no means before
any of the house under her government.

2. Quest. What if her fault be public, such an one as Direction for
reproving a wife whose offense is public.
may be an ill example to them of the house, it being committed in their sight,
or brought some other way to their knowledge?

Answ. Wisely he must so manifest his dislike of her fault, as he no way
impair her honor: he may therefore declare that such a thing was not well
done, and fore-warne his household of committing the like; yea roundly threaten
them that if any of them do the like they shall dearly repent it; and if such
as are under correction offend therein, the more surely and severely correct
them, even because they have taken example. Thus shall he testify a great good
respect of his wife, and also a through dislike and hatred of her sin.

2. A soft tongue (as Solomon notes) breaks the bones, 4. Reprove gently.
Pro. 25. 15.
that is, softneth an hard heart, and beats down a stout stomach. How will
it then work upon a soft heart, and gentle disposition? If therefore an
husband look to do good by reproving his wife, his reproof must be so
ordered, as it may seem to be rather a gentle admonition, then a sharp
rebuke. He may and ought plainly to declare her fault unto her, but in mild
and meek terms, without reuiling, opprobrious and ignominious words.

Quest. What if her fault be an heinous notorious sin?
Answ. In an extraordinary case some sharpness may be A reproof may be sharp
not bitter. Genesis 30. 2. Job 2. 10.
used: as the reproves of Iaakob, Job, and David do show, for they were every
one of them sharp: but yet this sharpness must not be made bitter by any
evil language. A woman's wickedness may not move an husband to be froward, and
2 Samuel 6. 21, 22. Rebuke never to be given by a man in passion.
outrageous; but rather to be the more watchful over himself, that he
contain himself within the bounds of discretion and moderation. For which end
it is meet that husbands lay it down for a rule, never to rebuke their wives
when they are in passion. Passion raises a dark mist before the eyes of
reason; which, while it remains, keeps reason from giving any good
direction. Yea passion is as a fire, and it so incenseth a man, and
distempereth him, that in his disorder he can keep no mean or measure.
Howsoever a man be not able to rule himself when passion is stirred up, yet,
if before hand while his eye is single, and his whole body light, while he is
in tune (as we Mat. 6. 22.
speak) and well tempered, he resoluedly determine with himself not to do
such or such a thing in his passion; that foregoing resolution will be an
especial means to make him forbear doing that in passion, which if he should
do, he could not in passion well order and moderate. For if once he begin to
do a thing in passion, the least provocation that can be, will be as bellows
to blow up that fire into a flame.

In regard of the violence of passion (wherein women by Rebuke to be put off
while a wife is in passion.
reason of the weakness of their judgment are for the most part most violent)
it is also the part of a wise man to forbear this duty of reproving his wife
even when she is in passion. For as it is needful that he should be in case
well to give a reproof, so as needful it is that she should be in case well
to take a rebuke. Passion both fills and festereth ones heart. The heart then
being full of passion, what room is left for good advice? will a man power
wine into a vessel full of water, or stay, till all the water be dreaned out?

The heart also being so festered as it sauoureth of nothing but passion, what
good can then good advice do?

It is therefore an especial point of wisdom, and shows a good respect that
a man bears to his wife, yea it sauoureth of much meekness and moderation
for an husband, well to weigh both his own and his wives temper when he
reproves her, and to forbear doing it while either he or she be in passion.

. 39. Of indiscreet reproouing a wife.
Contrary is the indiscretion of husbands who regard nor place, nor persons,
nor time, nor temper of themselves or their wives, nor any other circumstance
in reproving, but like Saul (who at a table where a great feast was, in
presence of his Nobles and Captains, when he was enraged with anger, with most
virulent and bitter speeches not rebuked only but reproached also his son,
and that with such words as he spared not his own wife; for in his passion he
called his son, son 1 Samuel 20. 30.
of the perverse rebellious woman:) like this foolish and furious Saul, I say,
they take the most open place of the family before children, servants, and
whole house, to reprove their wives; and that with such bitter and disgraceful
terms, as either they provoke their wives to answer again for maintaining (as
they think) their own credit and reputation, (thus Jonathan 1 Samuel 20. 32.
was provoked to answer his father again:) or else give them of the house that
behold her thus trampled under foot, occasion to set their feet also upon her.

Most husbands are forward enough to reprove, but few do it in meekness, and
moderation. They cannot do it but in company, nor without bitter words. Many
in rebuking their wives, stick not to use all the evil terms that they can
think of, even such as tend not only to their wives dishonor, but also to
their own and their childrens infamy. The reason whereof is, because they
never rebuke but when they are in passion, and so scarce know what they do:
whereby also they stir up passion in their wives, and yet for all that
refrain not any whit the more, but rather grow more violent: as when the heat
of two fires meet together, the flame must needs be the greater. This being the
preposterous practice of many husbands, is it any marvel that ordinarily so
little good, and so much hurt is done by reproving? Nay, would it not be a
wonder, if any good, and no hurt should be done thereby? This therefore though
it be a duty, yet a duty rarely and with great moderation to be used.

Thus far of an husbands mildness in his speeches to his wife.

wife, must be composed to an amiable pleasantness. His authority over her,
and eminency above her, may not make him forget the near conjunction and
union betwixt them.

Under the face and countenance I comprise head, brow, eyes, lips and such
other parts which are, according as they are framed, signs of amiablenesse, or
discontentednesse. Now among, and above other parts of the body, the outward
composition of the countenance does soonest and best declare the inward
disposition of the heart. By Esaus pleasant countenance Iaakob perceived that
he was pacified in his heart toward him, and thereupon said, I have seen thy
face as though I had Genesis 33. 10.
seen the face of God, that is, an amiable, gracious countenance. On this
ground David desired God, to lift up the light of his Psalm. 4. 6.
countenance upon him, that thereby he might know the favor and love of God
toward him. On the other side by a frowning and lowering face, by hanging down
the head, putting out the lips, with the like, anger, malice, grief, with
other like affections of heart, are manifested: by Caines casting down Genesis 4.
6.
of his countenance God discerned anger and envy to be in his heart: by Labans
countenance Iaakob observed that his affection Genesis 31. 2.
was turned from him. A wife then beholding mildness and amiablenesse in her
husbands face, beholds it as the face of God, and therein as in a looking
glass beholds the kindness and love of his heart, and so has her heart
thereby the more firmly knit unto him, and is moved the more to respect him.

. 41. Of husbands too great austeritie.
Contrary is 1. A lofty proud countenance, as of an imperious Contrary. 1. A

2. A grim stern countenance, as of a judge over poor prisoners. 2. A grim

^reditor over a desperate debtor.

4. A fierce fiery countenance, as of an angry King over a 4. A fiery eye.

These and such like countenances as they manifest a proud, stout, furious
discontented disposition of heart, so they cannot but give great discontent to
a wife, yea and much affright her being but a weak vessel, and alienate her
heart and affection from him.

. 42. Of an husbands familiar gesture with his wife.
II. An husbands gesture ought to be so familiar, and amiable 2. Mild geslure.
toward his wife, as others may discern him to be her husband, and his wife
may be provoked to be familiar with him. They which this way are ready to show
themselves kind and mild husbands, are prone to exceed and so to fall into an
extreme on the right hand: for some are never well but when they have their
wives in their laps, ever colling, kissing, and dallying with them, they care
not in what company; thus they show more lightness, fondness, and dotage,
then true kindness and love, which forgets not an husband-like gravity,
sobriety, modesty and decency.

Some stick not to allege Isaacks sporting with Rebeckah, to Object.
countenance their lasciviousness. Genesis 26. 8.


But they forget that what Isaak did, was when he and his Answ.
wife were alone: he was seen through a window. Much greater liberty is
granted to man and wife when they are alone, then in company. Besides there are
many other ways to show kindness and familiarity, then by lightness and
wantonness.

. 43. Of an husbands strangeness to his wife.
Contrary to the familiarity I speak of, is (as we speak) strangeness, when
an husband so carries himself toward his wife as if she were a stranger to
him: if he come in company where his wife is, of all other women he will not
turn to her, nor take notice of her. This fault is so much the greater if such
a man be of a free pleasant carriage, and use to be merry and familiar with
other women. Though his mirth and familiarity be such as is not unbeseeming a
Christian, yet his carriage being of another temper toward his wife, it may be
a means to breed jealousy in her. Many think outward kind gesture toward
wife to be fondness, but if they knew what a means it is to stir up,
increase, and preserve love in a wives heart to her husband, they would be
otherwise minded.

. 43. Of an husbands giving favors to his wife.
III. Actions are of all other the most real demonstrations of true kindness,
wherein an husband must not fail, as he would have his kind speech,
countenance, and gesture to be taken in the better part. Kindness and
mildness in action consists in giving favors (as we speak) unto his wife.
This is expressly noted in Elkanah, who every year gave favors to 1 Samuel 1. 4,
5.
his wives. Thus an husband as he testifies his love to his wife, so he will
much provoke her to do all duty to him. A small gift, as an action of
kindness freely given, not upon any debt, but in testimony of love, does more
work on the heart of her to whom it is given, then much more given upon
contract, or for a work done, whereby it may seem to be deserved.

In giving favors to a wife, an husband ought to be more bountiful and
liberal, then to others, that so she may see thereby he loves her above all;
as it is noted that Elkanah gave Annah a worthy portion, because he loved her.
And in giving 1 Samuel 1. 4.
favors it is best to bestow them with his own hands, unless he be absent
from her.

. 44. Of husbands beating their wives.
Contrary are the furious, and spightfull actions of many unkind husbands
(heads too heady) whose favors are buffets, Vipera virus ob venerationem
nuptiarum euomit. Et tu duritiem animi, tuferitatem, tu crudelitatem ob vnionis
reuerentiam non deponis? Basil. Hexaem. hom. 7. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7. vrget
hanc ipsam similitudinem.
blows, strokes, and stripes: wherein they are worse then the venomous viper.
For the viper for his mates sake casts out his poison: and wilt not thou, o
husband, in respect of that near union which is betwixt thee and thy wife, lay
aside thy fierceness and cruelty? Many wives by reason of their husbands
fury, are in worse case then servants: for

1. Such as will not give a blow to a servant, care not what load they lay upon
their wives.

2. Where servants have but a time and term to be under the tyranny of such
furious men, poor wives are tied to them all their life long.

3. Wives can not have so good remedy by the help of law against cruel
husbands, as servants may have against cruel masters.

4. Masters have not such opportunity to exercise their cruelty over servants
as husbands over wives, who are to be continually at board and bed with their
husbands.

5. The nearer wives are, and the dearer they ought to be to their husbands,
the more grievous must strokes needs be when they are given by an husbands
hand, then by a masters. Huiusmodi virum (siquidem vir appellandus est potius
quam fera) and patricidae, and matricidae similem dixeris. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1
Cor. 11.


6. The less power and authority that an husband has to strike his wife, then
a master to strike a servant, the more heavy do his strokes seem to be, and
the worse does the case of a wife seem to be in that respect, then of a
servant. Not unfitly therefore is such a man (if he may be thought a man rather
then a beast) said to be like a father-queller and mother-queller.

Quest. May not then an husband beat his wife? An husband may not beat his wife.

Answ. With submission to better judgments, I think he may not: my reasons
are these.

1. There is no warrant thorowout the whole Scripture Reasons. 1. No warrant in
the word.
by precept, or example for it: which argument though it be negative, yet for
the point in hand is a forceable argument in two respects. 1. Because the
Scripture has so plentifully and particularly declared the several duties of
husbands and wives: and yet has delivered nothing concerning an husbands
striking and beating his wife. 2. Because it has also plentifully and
particularly spoaken of all such as are to correct, and of their manner of
correcting, and of their bearing correction who are to be corrected, and of the
use they are to make thereof; and yet not any thing at all concerning an
husbands punishing, or a wives bearing in this kind. The Scripture being so
silent in this point, we may well infer that God has not ranked wives among
those in the family who are to be corrected.

2. That small disparity which (as I have. 4.
before showed) is 2. Small disparity.
betwixt man and wife, permits not so high a power in an husband, and so low
a servitude in a wife, as for him to beat her. Can it be thought reasonable
that she who is the man's perpetual bedfellow, who has power over his body,
who Summa iniuria est vitae sociam, and in rebus necessarijs tibi coniunctam,
taquam mancipium ignominia affioere. Chrysostom. ibid.
is a joint parent of the children, a joint governor of the family, should be
beaten by his hands? What if children or servants should know of it? (as they
must needs: for how can such a thing be done in the house and they of the house
know it not?) can they respect her as a mother, or a mistress who is under
correction as well as they?

3. The near conjunction, and very union that is betwixt 3. Near conjunction.
man and wife suffers not such dealing to pass betwixt them. The wife is as
a man's self, Ephesians. 5. 31.
They two are one flesh. No man but a frantike, furious, desperate wretch will
beat himself. Two sorts of men are in Scripture noted to cut and lanch their
own flesh, idolaters, as the 1 King. 18. 28.
Baalites, and Daemoniacks, as Mar. 5. 5.
he that was possessed with a legion of devils. Such are they who beat their
wives, either blinded in their understanding, or possessed with a devil.

Object. He that is best in his wits will suffer his body to be pinched,
pricked, lanched, and otherwise pained, if it be needful and behoofull.

Answ. 1. A man's heart will not suffer him to do any of these himself: their
are Chirurgions whose office it is to do such things: if the Surgeon
himself have need of any such remedy for his own body, he will use the help
of another Surgeon. If the case so stand as a wife must needs be beaten, it
is fitter for an husband to refer the matter to a public Magistrate (who is
as an approved and licensed Surgeon) and not to do it with his own hands.

2. Though some parts of the body may be so dealt withal, yet every part may
not, as the heart, which the wife is to the man.

3. The comparison holds not. For the forenamed pinching, lanching, etc. is
no punishment for any fault, as the beating of a wife in question is, there is
no question but a man that has skill may if need be open a vein, lanch a
boil, splinter a broken bone, or disioynted joint in his wives body, which may
be more painful then correction: and herein the comparison holds, but not in
the other.

2. Object. There is as near a conjunction betwixt Christ and his Church, as
betwixt man and wife: yet Christ for bears not to correct and punish his
Church.

Answ. There is a double relation betwixt Christ and the Church: he is an
husband unto it, having made it of his flesh, and of his bones: and a supreme
Lord over it, having all power Ephesians. 5. 30. Mat. 28. 18.
in heaven and earth committed unto him. In this latter respect he punishes,
not in the former. An husband is not such a supreme Lord over his wife:
therefore Christ's example, is no warrant to him.

4. There is no hope of any good to proceed from an husbands 4. No profit: much
mischief.
beating of his wife: for where the party corrected is persuaded that the party
which corrects has no authority or right so to do, it will not be brought
patiently to take it: but will resist, and strive if it be possible to get the
mastery. Let a stranger strike such a child of years or a servant as will
patiently bear many strokes at a parents or masters hand, they will turn
again at that stranger, and endeavor to give him as good as he brings: now a
wife having no ground to be persuaded that her husband has authority to
Adhibitis verberibus morbus non tollitur, sed augetur, and exasperatur. Melch.
Iun. quaest. Polit. par. 2.
beat her, what hope is there that she will patiently bear it, and be bettered
by it? Or rather is it not likely that she will, if she can, rise against him,
ouer-master him (as many do) and never do any duty aright? A fault in a wife
is not taken away but increased by blows.

Object. Smart and pain may make her dread her husband, stand in awe of him,
and do her duty the better.
Answ. Such dread and awe beseemes neither the place of an husband to exact it,
nor the place of a wife to yield it. Though perforce she may be brought to
yield some outward subjection, yet inward hatred of her husbands person may be
joined therewith, which is as bad, if not worse then outward disobedience.

Object. She may be of so outrageous a disposition, as, but by Nullum sit tam
magnum peccatum, quod ad verberandum vxorem compellat. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1
Cor. 11.
force, she will not be kept in any compass.
1. Answ. It has been of old time answered, that no fault should be so great,
as to compel an husband to beat his wife.

2. Answ. Other forceable means may be used besides beating by her husbands
hands: she may be restrained of liberty, denied such things as she most
affects, be kept up, as it were, in hold; and, if no other means will serve
the turn, be put over to the Magistrates hands, that if she be of so servile a
disposition, as by no other means she will be kept under then by fear and
force, by smart and pain, she may fear the Magistrate, and feel his hand,
rather then her husbands.

Object. If a wife wax so mannish, or rather mad, as to offer to strike and
beat her husband, may he not in that case beat her to make her cease her
outrage?

Answ. I doubt not but that that good provision which is made in law to
preserve a man's life, may be applied to this purpose. The law simply condemns
all murder; yet if a man be so assaulted, as there is no way to preserve his
own life, but by taking away his life that assaults him, it condemns not him
as a murderer, because he did it in defense of himself. So if an husband
Sedefendendo.
be set upon by his wife, it is lawful and expedient that he defend himself,
and if he can do it no other ways but by striking her, that is not to be
reckoned an unlawful beating her.

. 45. Of an husbands bearing with his wines infirmities.
Hither to of the husbands avoiding of offense, a word concerning his bearing
with offense. A general duty it is, common to all of all sorts, to bear one
Gal. 6. 2.
another burden: in which extent even a wife is to bear her husbands burden,
because he, as every one else, is subject to slip and fall, and so has need to
be supported. Yet after a more special and peculiar manner does this duty
belong to an husband, and that in two respects.

1. Of the two, he is more bound then his wife, because in relation to his wife
he is the stronger: for she is the weaker vessel, Considera mulierem debile
vas esse: tu autem vir propterea princeps factus es, vt subditae feras
imbecillitatem. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11.
1. Pet. 3. 7. But the strong are most bound to bear with the infirmities of
the weak, Romans 15. 1.

2. He is bound to bear with his wife more then with any other, because of
that near conjunction which is betwixt them: he that cannot bear with his
wife, his flesh, can bear with no body. The reason alleged by the Apostle to
move a man to dwell with his wife according to knowledge, and to give honor to
her, intimated in this phrase, as to the weaker vessel, shows that this is a
peculiar duty belonging to an husband, wherein, and whereby he 1. Pet. 3. 7.
may both manifest his knowledge and wisdom, and also do honor to his wife.
For why is he put in mind of her weakness, but to show he should bear with
her?

As that phrase intimates the duty, so also it intimates a good reason to
enforce it. For precious things, whereof we make high account, the weaker they
be, the more tenderly, and charily are they handled, as Cheney dishes, and
crystal glasses: and of all parts of the body, the eye is most tenderly
handled. Now what things, what persons are more dear and precious then a wife?
yet withal she is a weak vessel: therefore she is much to be borne withal.

For an husbands better direction herein, difference must be Directions to
husbands for bearing with their wives infirmities.
made betwixt infirmities: for some are natural imperfections, other are
actual transgressions. Natural imperfections are inward, (as slownesse in
conceit, dullness in apprehension, shortness of memory, hastiness in
passion, etc.) or outward, (as lamenesse, blindness, deafness, or any other
defect, and deformity of body.) These infirmities should breed pity,
compassion, commiseration, yea and greater tenderness and respect, but no
offense. Note Abraham's example in this case: his wife was barren, yet he
despised Neque Saram tanquam sterilem contempsit Abraham: n^que quicquam tale
exprobauit. Si vxor pauper sit, noli exprobare: and si stulta, noli ei
insultare, Ibid. Uxor iracunda etc. admonenda and adiuvanda consilio, and omni
conatu anniten. dum, vt illis liberetur affectibus, Ibid.
her not for it, nor vpbraided her with any such thing.

Actual transgressions are breaches of Gods law: whereof such are here meant,
as are most directly tending to his own disquiet, and disadvantage, as
shrewishness, waiwardnesse, niceness, stubbornness, etc. In the bearing of
these must an husband especially show his wisdom, and that sundry ways.

1. By using the best and mildest means he can to redress them, as meek
admonition, seasonable advice, gentle entreaty, and compassionate affection.
Elkanah supposing that his wife offended in her passion, thus dealt with her
and supported her.

2. By removing the stone whereat she stumbleth, by taking away the occasion
(so far as conveniently he can) which makes her offend. Thus Abram, and that
by Gods advice, put Hagar and her son out of the house, because they were an
offense to Sarah.

3. By turning his eyes away (if the matter be not great, but 1 Samuel 1. 8. Genesis
21. 14.
such as may be tolerated) and taking no notice of the offense, but rather
passing by it, as if he perceived it not. Solomon says, that it is a man's
glory to pass over a transgression: and he exhorts a Prou. 19. 11. Eccl 7.
23.
man not to give his heart to all the words that men speak.

4. By forgiving and forgetting it (if notice be taken thereof.) Iaakob took
notice of Rachels rash, and froward demand, for he Genesis 30. 1. 2, etc.
rebuked her for it: yet in that he readily yielded to that which afterward
she moved him unto, it appears that he forgave the offense, if not forgot it.

The best trial of a man's affection to his wife, and of his wisdom Reason.
Best trial of a man's wisdom and love.
in ordering the same, is in this point of bearing with offenses. Not to be
offended with a wife that gives no offense is not praiseworthy: heathen men
may go so far. Note what Christ says of this case, If ye love them which
love you, and do good to Matthew. 5. 46. Luke 6. 32, 33.
them that do good to you, what thanks and reward have ye? for publicans, and
sinners do the same: but gently to forbear, and wisely to pass over offenses
when they are given, not to be provoked when there is cause of provocation
ministered, is a true Christian virtue, a virtue beseeming husbands better then
any other kind of men.

. 46. Of husbands testiness.
Contrary is testiness, and peevishness, when husbands are moved with the
least provocation, like tinder catching fire at the least spark that falls
upon it: yea many are like gunpowder, which not only takes fire, but also
breaks out into a violent flame, upon the least touch of fire: as gunpowder
is dangerous to be kept in an house, so such husbands to be joined so nearly
to wives as marriage joins them. If it be said, that as gunpowder does no
hurt, if fire come not at it; so they are good and kind, if they be not
provoked and displeased. I answer, that we have a proverb that says, The
devil is good while he is pleased, yet it is not safe to have the devil too
near. It is as impossible (considering man's weakness) that he should live and
converse with any, and not give offense, as for flint stones long to beat and
dash against one another, and no spark of fire to come from them. How then may
it be thought possible for a wife, who is so continually conversant with her
husband, and the weaker vessel, to live without giving him offense? It is no
very kind speech, which husbands use, especially if they be told of their
unkindness, Let my wife deserve favor, and she shall have it. How little
favor would such husbands have of Christ their husband, if he should be of
that mind toward them?

Thus far has been handled the first part of an husbands well managing his
authority, by a tender respect of his wife.

The second is a provident care for her.

. 46. Of an husbands provident care for his wife.
An husband that tenderly respects his wife, but prouidently cares not for
her, shows more affection then discretion: he may have a kind heart, but he
wants a wise head. How then can he be a good head unto his wife? Some present
contentment she may have by him: but small profit and benefit can she reap
from him. Those duties therefore which have been delivered must be done, but
these that follow must by no means be left undone.

An husbands provident care is noted in that office of Christ, wherein an
husband resembles him, namely, to be a Savior of Ephesians. 5. 23.
the body, as has been Treat. 1.. 15. and Treat. 3.. 73.
before declared. It consists 1. In providing things needful for his wife.
2. In protecting her from things hurtful.


1. A careful providing of things needful, is a principal part of 1.

that honor, which husbands are to give unto their wives. For where the
Apostle says, that Elders are worthy of double honor, 1 Pet. 3. 7. 1 Timothy 5.
17.
he means maintenance as well as reverence. The Apostle counts him worse
then an Infidel, that provides not for his own, and specially for those of
his own house. Who are of an husbands house, 1 Timothy 5. 8.
if not his wife? in his house, who more properly his own, then his wife? If
then an husband provide not for his wife, what is he Recordare quod pater
vxoris ta^quam depositum quoddam filiam tibi tradidit, and omnibus relictis,
matre, domo, and seipso, omnem eius cura^ tuae dexterae commisit. Chrysostom. ho^.
26. in 1. Cor. 11.
to be accounted?

Great reason he should provide for her, because he has taken her from her
parents and friends, and has received that portion which they allotted her,
and has authority committed unto him over her, and she is put in subjection
under him: her friends having given away her portion, and their power over her,
and committed all to him, will take no further care for her: she being in
subjection under him cannot without him provide for her self. Who then shall
provide for her if he do not, whose wholly and only she is?

Contrary is their mind, who take a wife only for their own Contrary, to take
a wife only for himself.
content, or delight, or gain, and never think of that charge which together
with a wife they take upon them. According to their mind is their practice:
for when they have a wife they neglect her in every thing but what may stand
with their own ends. Much have they to answer for: and so much the more,
because a wife is an especial pledge of Gods favor. Pro. 18. 22.


. 47. Of an husbands providing means of spiritual edisication for his wife.
In this provident care which an husband ought to have of his wife, we will
consider the Extent thereof. Continuance

It ought to extend both to her self, and to others.

In regard of her self, to her Soul. Body.

For her Soul, means of spiritual edification must be provided, and those
both private and public. Private means, are Private means of edification.
holy and religious exercises in the house, as reading the word, prayer,
catechizing, and such like; which being the spiritual food of the soul are to
be every day, as our bodily food, provided and used. An husband as a master of
a family must provide these for the good of his whole house; but as an husband,
in special for the good of his wife: for to his wife, as well as to the whole
house he is a King, a Priest, and a Prophet.

By himself therefore, for his wives good, ought he to perform these things,
or to provide that they may be done by some other. C^raelius himself performed
those exercises. Act. 10. 2, 30. Judge. 17. 10.
Micah hired a Leuite (though his Idolatry were evil, yet his care to have a
Leuite in his house was commendable.) The 2 King. 4. 11.
Shunemites husband provided a chamber for the Prophet, and that especially for
his wives sake, for it was at her request.

Public means are the holy ordinances of God publikly Public means of
edification.
performed by Gods Minister. The care of an husband for his wife in this
respect is, so to order his habitation, and provide other needful things, as
his wife may be made partaker thereof. It is expressly noted of Elkanah that he
so provided for his 1 Samuel 1. 7. and 2. 19. Luke 2. 41.
wives, that they went with him every year to the house of God: the like is
intimated of Joseph the husband of the virgin Mary. In those days there was a
public place and house of God, whither all Gods people (how far soever they
dwelt from it) were to resort every year: the places where Elkanah and Joseph
dwelt, were far remote from the house of God, yet they so provided, as not
only themselves, but their wives also went to the public worship of God. Now
there are many houses of God, places for the public worship of God, but yet
through the corruption of our times, the ministry of the word (the most
principal means of spiritual edification) is not every where to be enjoyed:
therefore such ought an husbands care for his wife in this respect to be, as to
dwell where she may have the benefit of preaching the word, or else so to
provide for her, as she may weekly go where it may be had.

If men of wisdom and ability make a purchase, or build an house for their
habitation, they will be sure it shall be where sweet rivers and waters are,
and good pasture ground, and where all needful provision may be had. Gods word
preached is a spring of water of life; the place where it is preached a
pleasant, profitable pasture; all needful provision for the soul may there be
had. Let this therefore be most of all inquired after: and no habitation settled
but where this may be had.

. 48. Of neglecting their wives edification.
Contrary is their practice, who having their calling in places where the word
is plentiful, yet upon outward respects of pleasure, delight, ease, and
profit, remove their families into remote places where preaching is scarce, if
at all; and there leave their wives to govern the family, not regarding their
want of the word, for as much as they themselves often coming to London or other
like places by reason of their calling, enjoy the word themselves. Many
Citizens, Lawyers, and others are guilty of great neglect of their wives in
this respect.

So also are they, who abandon all religious exercises out of their houses,
making their houses rather stews of the devil, then Churches of God. If for
want of means, either public or private, a wife live and die in ignorance,
profaneness, infidelity, and impenitencie, which cause eternal damnation,
assuredly her blood shall be required at his hands: for an husband Ezekiel. 3. 18.
etc.
is Gods watchman to his wife.

. 49. Of an husbands providing things needful for his wives boay.
To the body also must an husbands provident care of his wife extend: and that
both in health and sickness. In health by providing such things as are
needful to preserve health, as competent food, raiment, and the like
necessaries. Where the Jsa. 4. 1.
Prophet to aggrauate the misery of the people says, Seven women shall take
hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own
apparel, only let us be called by thy name, intimates, that it was an
husbands duty to provide bread and apparel, that is, all necessaries for his
wife. Which the Exo. 21. 10.
law also implies, where it inioyneth him that takes one wife upon another,
not to diminish the food and raiment of the former. In sickness such things
are to be provided as are needful either to recover her health, or to comfort,
cherish and refresh her in her sickness.

This was Treat. 2. Part. 2.. 29.
before noted among common mutual duties; for by virtue of the matrimonial
bond it belongs both to man and wife: but to the man it appertains by
virtue of that power and charge which he has over his wife: and therefore it
was needful here to be touched.

. 50. Of an husbands Treat. 3.. 49.
provident care for his wife about her childbearing.
Most proper to this place is that provident care which husbands ought to have
of their wives both before and in the time of their travel and childbed: and
that in two things especially.

1. In procuring for their wives to the uttermost of their power and ability,
such things as may save their longing, in case they do long (as in all ages
women in the time of breeding and bearing child, have been subject
thereunto.) For it is well known, that it is very dangerous both for mother
and child to want her longing: the death sometimes of the one, sometimes of
the other, sometimes of both has followed thereupon.

2. In providing such things as are needful for their travel and lying in
childbed. This time is especially to be provided for, in many respects.

1. Because it is a time of weakness, wherein the woman cannot well provide
for her self.

2. Because her weakness is joined with much pain: the The pains of women's
travel.
pain of a women in travel is the greatest pain that ordinarily is endured
by any for the time: none know it so well as they that feel it: and many
husbands because they are not subject thereto, think but lightly of it: but if
we duly weigh Psalm. 48 6. Isa. 13. 8. and 21. 3 Ier. 4. 31. and 30. 6. Mic. 49.
that the holy Ghost when he would set forth the extremity of any pains and
pangs, resembles them to the pains of a woman in travel, we may well gather,
that of all they are the greatest: which is further manifested by the screekes
and outcries which not only weak, and faint-hearted women utter in the time of
their travel, but also are forced from the strongest, and stoutest women that
be, and that though before hand they resolve to the contrary. Neither may we
wonder thereat; for their body is as it were set on a rack (if at least the
travel be sharp) and all their parts so stretched, as a wonder it is they
should ever recover their health and strength again: or that they should hold
out the brunt, and not die with their travel, as Rachel, and the wife of
Phinchas, and many in all ages have Genesis 35. 16, etc. 1 Samuel 4. 19. 20.
done. Surely among ordinary deliverances I know none so near a miracle, none
wherein the Almighty does so evidently manifest his great power and good
providence, as in the safe delivery of women. Besides the great pang of
travel, women are also after their delivery subject to many after-throws
which are very painful. From all these pains and great weakness which
befalls women in childbed, especially if they nurse their children, men by
reason of their sex are freed: Now then to apply this point, seeing women are
brought to such pains and weakness in bringing forth those children which are
the man's as well as hers, and he freed from all; is it not very just and meet
that he should provide all things needful for her welfare, ease, and recovery
of strength?

3. Because the want of things needful is at that time very dangerous:
dangerous to the health and life of the woman and child also.

. 51. Of neglecting wives in their weakness.
Contrary to an husbands provident care in general are those vices which were
taxed in the treatise of common duties, * See Treat 2. Part. 2. 30. 39.
as grudging at the charges bestowed on a wife: Covetousness, Prodigality, and
Idleness.

But contrary in particular to an husbands care for his wife in childbed, is
the inhumane and more then barbarous unkindness of many husbands, who no whit
consider the weakness of their wives in this case, to help, ease, and comfort
them, but rather make their burden much more heavy. For,

1. Some through covetousness refuse before hand to afford means to their
wife to provide such things as are needful for her self and child: and when
the time comes, if their wife be desirous of a Midwife that requires somewhat
more charges then she that is next, she shall have none if she will not have
the next. And as for a nurse to tend her, they think their Maid will serve the
turn well enough: they need not be at the charges to bring a Nurse into the
house. In regard of convenient lodging some will not stick to say, Cannot my
wife be brought to bed in a room without a chimney as well as the Virgin Mary?
Why should my wife need more things then she did? Yea further there be many
that when the time that their wife should be delivered approaches near, carry
her from al her friends into a place where she is not known, lest her friends
should by importunity draw him to expend and lay out more upon his wife then he
is willing. In the time while their wife is weak in childbed, many are loath
to allow them any other diet then is for themselves and children provided in
the house, not considering that her stomach cannot be like theirs.

Many other such bitter fruits of unkind husbands arising from covetousness
might be reckoned up, whereby husbands plainly show that they love their
wealth better then their wives: they had rather lose them, then part with that.

2. Others through jealous suspicion forbear not even in Si quid vxor
peccauerit consolare and noli moerorem augere. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
the time of their wives pain and weakness, to vpbraid them with lightness,
and to say that the child is none of theirs. To lay this to a wives charge
unjustly, is at any time a most shameful and odious reproach: but in the time
of childebirth whether just or unjust, a thing too too spightfull and
reuengefull. Some wives are so far overcome thereby, (especially in the time
of their weakness) as they are not able to bear it, but even faint and die
under the reproach: others more stout vow never to know their husbands again.
Many like mischiefs follow on such unkindness.

. 52. Of an husbands Treat. 3.. 38.
providing for his wife according to his estate and ability.
In an husbands providing for the body of his wife respect must be had to the
measure, and to the manner.

The measure must extend to his ability: for an husband ought to maintain his
wife in as good an estate and fashion as himself; by marriage she is advanced
to as high an estate, and dignity in relation to others as he is: and for her
own use she is made a partner of all his goods, and accordingly ought to
partake thereof.

For the manner, he must suffer her (if at least he observe her to have any
competent discretion) to order such things as are needful for her self
according to her best liking: as Elkanah in another case said to his wife, Do
what seems thee best. 1 Samuel 1. 23.


Both in the measure and in the manner of providing, there must be a difference
put betwixt a wife, and servants or children. These may have their portions of
meat, apparel, and like necessaries, proportioned out and stinted unto them,
which is unmeet to be done to a wife. Neither is it needful that so plentiful
a provision be made for them as for her.

. 53. Of an husbands nigardlynesse to his wife.
Contrary is an husbands nigardly dealing with his wife: when the allowance she
has is both far under his estate, and also so given her by little and
little, as if she were a child. Many husbands make their wives drudge at home,
fare hardly, and go meanly; who are themselves brave in apparel, frolic in
their feasting abroad, and so exceed their wives as they are ashamed to be
seen in company with them. They who marry their maids, or others of meaner
rank then themselves, often so deal with them: esteeming them but as servants
and mean persons though they be their wives. But it has been. 6.
before showed, that wives by marriage are advanced to their husbands dignity,
how mean soever they were before.

. 54. Of husbands Treat. 3.. 23. 29. 33.
allowing their wives to bestow on others, as they see good occasion.
So far ought the provident care of an husband for his wife to extend, as she
may have (beside things needful to her self) to bestow on such as it is
requisite for her to give unto: as namely, on children and servants in the
house, and others also out of the house. For so much is noted in Salomons
description Pro. 31. 15. etc. Verse. 21. Uers. 28.
of a good wife; She gives meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens:
all her household is clothed with scarlet (namely, by her ordering and disposing
the matter.) Her children rise up and call her blessed, as for her general
carriage in the family, so for her particular favors bestowed on themselves. As
for Verse. 20.
others out of the house, it is also noted, that she stretches out her hand to
the poor, and reaches forth her hands to the needy. These things she did by
virtue of that power and liberty which her husband gave her: as appears by
two points there noted:

1. In that before any mention is made of those things Verse. 11.
which she did, it is said, The heart of her husband does safely trust in her.

2. In that, after all her good deeds are reckoned up, it is Uers. 28.
said, Her husband praises her.

After this pattern it is meet that other husbands (whose wives are wise and
faithful) should deal with their wives: that in the house they might have the
more honor of children and servants: and that out of the house they might give
the better trial of their charity.

For considering the many excellent promises that are made to works of mercy
and charity, and the many terrible threatenings that are denounced not only
against such as exercise cruelty, but also against such as show no mercy:
considering also that wives together with their husbands, are heirs of the 1
Pet. 3. 7.
grace of life, it is very needful yea even necessary, that they should
manifest their faith by some work of mercy and charity. Now unless her
husband do give unto her something at her own discretion to bestow on others,
true and through try all of her merciful and charitable mind cannot be made.
If she give of that which her husband has reserved to himself, as her giving
is unlawful, so she may be thought liberal, not because she is merciful, but
because notwithstanding her liberality she parts with nothing of her own:
yea though she have a general consent to give as she sees cause of the common
goods of the family, yet is not that so sure and sound a trial of her charity,
and mercifulness, as if she had something of her own which she might retain
or give away as pleases her self; and what she gives not away, lay up as her
own stock proper to her self. For there is naturally such a self love in
man, and a desire to keep that which is proper to ones self, that he is very
loath to part with any of it, unless conscience and grace alter this
corruption of nature, and so move him readily to lay out something on
charitable uses. But otherwise of that which in whole or in part belongs to
another (be that other, husband, parent, master, friend, or any else) he is
easily moved to be liberal and bountiful: a man will willingly cut a large
thong (as we speak) out of another leather.

It is known that many children and servants, who, when they come to be
possessers of their own, are very niggards and misers, have been liberal of
their parents and masters goods unto the poor. Yea parteners in a stock will
be much more forward in giving away that which is common with another, then
that which is proper to each of them. The truest trial of a merciful and
charitable heart lies in the distribution of that which is proper to ones
self.

It is therefore meet upon this very ground, that an husband should according
to his ability let his wife have some stock, and portion of her own, free to
her self to dispose as she sees good: intimating unto her that the principal
end why he provides so plentifully for her, is, that she may show forth the
fruits of her faith by some works of charity: and exhorting her so to do.
Many religious, wise, kind husbands thus do: some giving quarterly allowance
in money to their wives, others giving their wives power to receive a certain
portion of rent out of certain lands or houses; others making their wives an
absolute estate of some inheritance, and suffering them to receive the profits
and revenues thereof; others giving them certain fees of their offices, or of
their trade; others, that are poor, suffering them to work for themselves,
and dispose their earnings as they see cause: some one way, some another: every
one in his place best knows the means how to gratify his wife in this
kind: it shall be sufficient for me to have laid down the general rule.

. 55. Of husbands too great straitness over their wives.
Contrary is their strait-handednesse to their wives, who allow them no more
then may be for their own private use. They think it a great matter and as
much as an husband is bound to do, to let her have apparel, meat and drink,
and such necessaries as are befitting her rank, but all other overplus they
think needless. Thus their wives are not only deprived of means to gain
respect of their children and servants at home, and to gratify such as are
obedient and ready to do service to them, but also to perform such works of
mercy as both opportunity requires, and also their conscience moves them to
do. Yea many wives of rich husbands are brought to great shame hereby, in that
being in places where there is just occasion of contributing to some charitable
use, and by reason of their rich and costly apparel it is expected they should
be bountiful, they have not any thing at all to bestow. The fault of some
husbands in this respect is great many ways. As 1. in that they bring shame
and grief to their wives, whom they ought with all tenderness to respect. 2.
In that they dishonor their own places: for they who take notice of this
straitness to their wives, will be ready to judge them both covetous, and
unkind. 3. The omitting of that work of mercy which their wives should have
done shall be laid to their charge: they shall hear that dreadful doom; Go
ye cursed into everlasting fire, for I was an hungered and ye fed me not etc.
and if they answer, When saw we thee an hungered etc. it shall be replied, In
that ye suffered not your wives to do it, you did it not.

Thus much of the extent of an husbands provident care for the good of his
wife. It follows to speak of the continuance thereof.

. 57. Of an husbands care to provide for his wife so long as she shall live.
The continuance of an husbands provident care for his wife must be so long as
she lives, yea though she out-liue him: not that he can actually when he is
dead provide for her, but that he may before his death so provide for her, as
she may have wherewithal to maintain her self, and to live according to that
place whereunto by him she is advanced: at least that he leave her not only so
much as he had with her, but something more also in testimony of his love to
her, and care for her. Husbands have the example of Christ to press this duty
upon them: for when he went away from his Church here on Ephesians 4. 8.
earth, he left his spirit, which furnished it with gifts as plentifully, as if
Christ had still remained with her, if not more abundantly.

For the better performance of this duty, husbands which die before the wives,
must observe among other things two especially.

1. That plainly and expressly they declare their mind and Husbands before they
die must make their will even for their wives good.
will before they die, lest their wives should be circumuented and defrauded of
that which they intended them. Thus did David upon the motion of Bathshebah, he
settled his estate, and caused Bathshebahs son to be actually crowned before
he himself gave up the Ghost: which he did, as for other weighty reasons, so
in particular for his wives good, as may be gathered from that reason she
alleged to the King in these 1 King. 1. 21. Husbands on their deathbed must
commend their wives to some faithful friend. Job. 19 26, 27. Reason. Truest
trial of love at departure.
words; Else when my Lord the King shall sleepe-with his fathers, I shall be
reputed vile.

2. That he request some faithful friend in his steed to be an helper unto
her; (as Christ commended his mother unto his disciple John) which will be
needful in regard of her weakness, by reason of her sex, and want of
experience to manage such affairs especially as are out of the house.

At the time of a man's departure out of this world from his wife, will the
truest trial of his affection to his wife be given: for many that bear their
wives fair in hand while they live with them, at their death show that there
was no soundness of affection in their heart toward them: all was but a mere
show for some by-respects.

. 58. Of husbands neglect of their wives future estate.
Contrary are diverse practices of unkind husbands. For Contrary. 1. A wilful
inability.


1. Some through improuidence, unthriftiness and prodigality, disable
themselves from doing good to their wives after their death; and so leave their
wives nothing, or (that which is worse then nothing) in debt, and with a great
charge of children. That care which husbands ought to have of their wives
should make them think before hand of the time to come, and even for their
wives sake be somewhat the more diligent, thrifty, and provident, and cut off
many unnecessary expenses, else their sin is doubled. 1. By a needless
wasting their estate. 2. By neglecting their wives.

2. Others by fawning, or forcing means draw their wives 2 Making away their
wives ioynter, or any other right.
to yield up that interest they have in money, goods, house or land by ioynter,
inheritance, or any other way, and yet make them no sufficient recompense in
another kind: but at their death leave their wives in a far worse estate
then they were in before marriage, beside a greater charge then they had before.
As this is a great part of unkindness, so also a maine point of injustice.

3. Others grudging against the laws under which they 3. Defeating of thirds.
^iue for providing for a wife by thirds or otherwise, use all the ^raudulent
means they can to deprive her of that which otherwise the law would lay upon
her. The civil politic awes of the place where we live ought to be the rule
of our civil actions (so far as they are not repugnant to Gods word) and we
ought for conscience sake to be subject unto Romans 13. 5.
them. Besides an husband ought (though the law forced him ^ot) to leave at
least the thirds to his wife, as a testimony of his love to her, and care for
her: so as this also is a dou^le fault. 1. A transgression of the law. 2. A
note of vn^indnesse.

4. Orthers having aged and sickly wives, or otherwise 4. Making no will.
^hinking that their wives may, or rather hoping that their ^iues will die
before themselves, put off the making of their wills of purpose that they might
not put in their wives thirds, but dispose them some other way. Besides that
these husbands show no good affection toward their wives, they provoke God to
disappoint them of their hopes: and so he does oftentimes: for he takes them
away before their wives, and so takes them away, as having no time to make
their will, not only their wives enjoy their thirds (which they so much desired
to avoid) but also some other (whom of all in their life time they misliked)
seize upon the other two parts.

. 58. Of an husbands protecting his wife from danger.
Having showed how an husband is to provide things needful for his wife: It
remains to show how he is to protect her from things hurtful.

In regard of that protection which an husband owes his wife, he is called the
veil of her eyes: which phrase as it implies Genesis 20 16.
Subjection on the wives part, so also Protection on the husbands: to protect
one, is as it were, to cover them, namely, from danger; to be negligent and
careless of them, is, as it were, to lay them open to danger. The same duty is
implied under another like phrase of spreading his wing over his wife. Ruth 3.
9.
The metaphor is taken from winged fowls, which to keep their young ones from
hurt, use to spread their wings over them: this phrase and metaphor is also
attributed to God, to Ruth 2. 12.
set forth his protection.

But most pertinent to this purpose is the title, Treat. 1.. 15. and treat. 3..
73.
Saniour, given to an husband in relation to his wife.

For this end the Lord who subjected a woman unto her husband, gave to his sex
greater strength, courage and boldness then to hers, that he might protect her
which is the weaker vessel. In this duty of protection Christ shows himself
an excellent pattern and president unto husbands.

The better to perform this duty, an husband must be careful,

1. To prevent, as much as he may, such dangers as his wise is like to fall
into.

2. To recover her out of such as she is fallen into.

For this purpose did David carry his wives into Gath, lest, if 1 Samuel 27. 3.
they were left in Israel, Saul should work them some mischief: and again,
when they were taken by the Amalakites, he recovered and 30. 18.
them.

According to that danger whereunto wives are subject, must an husbands care of
protecting his wife be manifested.

1. If she be in danger to be seduced and enticed, as Euah was, A wife must be
kept from being seduced.
by any evil instruments of the devil, as Jesuits, Priests, Friars, profane,
blasphemous, lascivious, or riotous persons; his care must be either to keep
them away that they come not at her, or to put them away from her so soon as
he can: he may not suffer them to harbor in his house.

2. If by any slight she be drawn from his house, he must A wise stolen away
must be fetched home. Judge. 19. 2. 2 San. 3. 13, 14. 1 Samuel 30. 18. A wives
credit must be maintained.
seek her, and fetch her again, as the Leuite did his wife: or cause her (if
he can) to be brought home again, as David caused Michal to be brought:
especially if they be taken away by force, as Ahinoam, and Abigail, David's
wives, were.

3. If she be unjustly slandered, he is to maintain her credit and reputation
as much as his own: as Christ accounts himself despised, when his Church
is, so must he. This care must he See Treat. 2. Part 2.. 31. etc.
have of his wives credit, even after her death, as well as while she lives.

4. What other mischief so ever is intended or practiced against Luke 10. 16.
A wife must be defended against strangers, servants, and children. Est. 7. 7,
8. etc.
her, he must be a tower of defense to protect her, (as Ahoshuerosh was to
Ester against Haman) and that not only against strangers without the house, but
also against children and servants in the house. Children grown to years,
that are stout and stubborn, will be ready to rise up against their mother,
especially if she be a mother in law, because she is the weaker sex: the
countenance of a father for the most part keeps most in awe. Wherefore the
husband must be an help to his wife, and maintain her honor against them:
yea though they be children of a former wife.

. 59. Of an husbands maintaining his wife against children of a former venture,
and servants.
Object. Mothers in law often prove unkind, and unjust stepmothers, and deal
unmercifully with their husbands children: must an husband in such cases assist
his wife against his children?

Answ. The protection, I speak of, is in case a wife be wronged, then her
husband is to do what he can to right her (as we speak.) But if she be the
wrong-doer, he may by no means boulster her up against his children, and so
make their wrong the greater. Yet so far ought he to respect his wife, as by
all the fair means he can, to labor to pacific her mind, and turn her
heart toward them: and if he observe her heart to be clean alienated from
them, then to put them forth to be brought up in some other place, and so to
take away from her the object of her displeasure, that he and she may live more
quietly together. For if a man must forsake father and mother, he must also
forsake children, and cleave to his wife. Peace and unity betwixt man and wife
must of all other be kept inviolable. Though thou cast away Licet omnia
proijcias, nihil molestius continget quam non habere beneuolam domi vxorem:
peccatum nullum magis dolendum inueneris, quam cum vxore seditionem habere.
Chrysostom. ho^. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. Genes. 16. 6. and 21. 14.
all, nothing can happen more troublesome to thee then not to have a quiet wife
at home. Thou can find no sin more grievous then to have contention with a
wife.

If a wife must be maintained against the stubbornness of children, much more
against the insolency of servants: for which purpose the example of Abraham is
recorded, whose servant might have a privilege above others, because he had
made her his bedfellow; yet when she waxed insolent against her mistress,
first he put her into her mistresses hand to do to her as it pleased her; and
afterward he cast her out of his house.

. 60. Of neglecting to maintain their wives.
Contrary is a dissolute carelessness of husbands, who care no more to help
and succor their wives then any other.

1. Some more fear to offend their wives then they care to do Contrary,

them good, and in that respect they let any sort of people come to their wives
that are welcome to them. If Magistrates in a Commonwealth shall answer for
suffering seducers to come into their dominions to deceive their people, much
more shall husbands answer for suffering them to come and deceive their wives.
1. Because they have a greater charge over their wives then Magistrates over
their people. 2. Because wives ought to be dearer to husbands then people to
Magistrates. 3. Because they may sooner epsy them in their house, then
Magistrates in the Commonwealth. 4. Because they may be much more easily kept
out of an house, then out of a Commonwealth, or a City.


2. Others care not whither their wives wander: and if they 2. In suffering

husbands: though this may be a just punishment on wandering wives, yet is it
not just for husbands so to deal with them. If Christ our husband should so
deal with us, we should soon be lost: for we often go astray like wandering
sheep, but he is that good shepherd, who seeks after the lost sheep until
he Luke 15. 4.

a wife will turn to the man's dishonor: for as a virtuous wife is a crown to

rule of contraries, an infamous wife is a shame to her husband. If therefore
not for his wives sake, yet for his own sake a man ought not too carelessly
pass over the ill reports which are raised against his wife.

usage done unto their wives, nor will hear any complaint that they make unto
them: yea if they see them misused, they will either not seem to see it, or
but smile at it, and so go their way, and suffer their wives to right
themselves as well as they can. As this beseems not any Christian to suffer
his neighbor to be wronged, (for it is noted as a commendable matter in Moses,
that Exodus 2. 13.
when he saw two Hebrews striving together, he took his part that had wrong
done to him, and reproved the other) so much ^esse an husband, to whose
safeguard his wife is committed. Nature teaches us that the head is as much
affected with a wrong ^one to the body, as to it self: so ought an husband.
5. In boulstring up children or servants against wives.


5. As the wrong which is done by those who are in subjection ^n the house
under the wife, is greater then that which is done by ^trangers: so is the
husbands fault the greater in suffering it: for ^e has more power over them in
his house, then over others. Si illam quae secundum post te locum obtinet
contumelia afficis, non parum tui principatus honori derogas. Chrysostom. loc. cit.
What then may we think of such, as either by their conniuence, ^r by taking
part against their wives, suffer both children and ser^ants to insult over
them? Assuredly those husbands themselves will find some smacke of the bitter
and evil fruit thereof: ^^d that not only by that great discontent which their
wives must ^eeds take thereat; but also by that contempt which will follow on
their own persons, both by their wives (who cannot think them meet heads to
govern others) but also by their children and servants, who thereby will take
occasion to wax proud, and presumptuous against him. By despising the weaker,
men grow by little and little to despise the stronger. This men of wisdom and
experience well know: whereupon in Commonwealths and Policies governed by wise
men, the authority of inferior Magistrates is vpheld and maintained:
superior Magistrates will not suffer them who are in authority under them to
be despised: for it is well known, that it tends not to the honor and ease
only, but to the safety also of the supreme Magistrate, to have the power and
authority of inferior Magistrates respected, and not trampled under feet. It
argues therefore both want of affection, and of discretion and understanding
in husbands, to suffer child, servant, or any other in the house, to insult
over their wives, who are joint governors with them over the house.

. 61. Of an husbands first beginning to love his wife.
The general matter together with the particular kinds of husbands duties
being thus far handled, The manner also of performing them is to be delivered.

To instruct an husband in the manner of performing his duties to his wife, the
Apostle lays down two patterns, 1. Christ, verse. 25. 2. Our selves, verse.
28.

As Christ loves his Church, and as we love our selves, so must men love their
wives.

That we may the better follow these patterns, we must distinctly note how
Christ loves his Church, and how we The manner of an husbands love set forth
by Christ's manner of loving his Church in six branches. 1. Christ first loves
the Church.
love our selves.

The love of Christ to his Church is commended unto us in six several points:
which are

1. The order 4. The quality thereof. 2. The truth 5. The quantity 3. The
cause 6. The continuance

I. For the Order, Christ began to love his Church: he mafested his love to her
before she loved him: as the air heated by the Sun is hot, and a wall on
which the Sunbeams smite, gives a reflection of heat back again: so the
Church, as it were heated and warmed at heart by the sense of Christ's love,
loved him, as the Apostle expressly notes, (We love him 1 John 4. 19.
because he loved us first:) and the Church her self acknowledges saying,
Because of the savor of thy good ointments Cant. 1. 2.
(wherewith we are revived, and cheered) the virgins love thee.

There is in us by nature no spark of love at all: if Christ Husbands must by
their love provoke their wives to love. Pro. 2. 17. (...)
by his loving of us first, did not instill love into us, we could no more love
him then a living bird rise out of a cold egg, if it were not kept warm by
the dammes sitting upon it.

Thus must an husband first begin to love his wife. His place of eminency, and
authority requires, that he should be to his wife, a guide, which title is
expressly given to him by the holy Sicaput est vir, praecedere debet in omnibus
bonis factis vxorem suam, vt illa imitetur virum, and sequatur caput suum. Aug.
de december chor. c. 3.
Ghost, to teach him to go before her, and by his example to instruct, and
incite her to do her duty. What a shame would it be for a man who is the
Image and glory of God, the head of his wife, in the same place to her that
Christ is to his Church, to be provoked by his wives wiue-like carriage (she
being the weaker vessel, under him, to learn of him) to love her? Treat. 1..
10.
Reasons there be to stir up a wife to endeavor to prevent her husband in
doing her duty, which if she do, it is the greater glory to her; but this
pattern of Christ should stir him much more to strive to go before her.

. 62. Of husbands repaying unkindness for love.
Contrary, is their disposition, who having loving and dutiful wives, are
notwithstanding nothing moved to love them again: but are as unkind and
churlish as if they had the most ^eeuish, and perverse wives that could be. But
what shall we say of such as love their wives the less, yea and hate them for
their forwardness to love, and (in testimony of true love) to perform all
good duty? What, but that they are very devils ^ncarnate? For it is the devils
property to overcome good with cuill. These make the doctrine of a wives
subjection to seem harsh, and a careful performance thereof, an heavy burden.
Never shall they partake of Christ's love, that in their place ^ew themselves so
unlike to Christ.

. 63. Of the Treat. 3.. 57. 2. Christ loves in truth.
truth of husbands love.
II. The truth of Christ's love was manifested by the fruits thereof to his
Church: He gave himself for it. It was therefore not in word only, no nor only
in heart, but in deed also. Thus his love proved profitable, and beneficial to
his Church, which thereby was cleansed, and made a glorious Verse. 26, 27.
Church. Had he only borne a tender compassion and pitiful affection toward
it, or labored only with comfortable and sweet words to uphold and succor it,
it had still lain polluted with sin, in the power of the devil, and under
Gods wrath, and so received no profit and benefit at all.

So must husbands love their wives in truth and in deed. Husbands must love in
deed.
1 Ioh. 3. 18.
Such a love is required of a man to his brother: much more therefore to his
wife, who is not only a sister (as 1 Cor. 9. 5.
the Apostle expressly styles her) but nearer then sister, mother, daughter,
friend, or any other whatsoever. This therefore serves to press the practice
of all the forenamed duties appertaining to an husband.

. 64. Of husbands dissimulation.
Contrary is their dissimulation and hypocrisy, who make great show of much
love, and pretense of earnest affection, using many outward complements, but
fail when they come to the truest trial, the deed. Some like suitors or
wooers, will promise mountains, but not perform moul-hills: others will coll
and kiss their wives much, but trust them with nothing, nor provide for them
things requisite: there be that will weep much when their wives are sick, yet
not afford physic and such like things for their recovery: yea many will
carry a fair face all their life long toward their wives, and at their death
leave them nothing to live by.

Hence it is that many who by others are accounted to be very kind husbands,
are by their wives found to be far otherwise. If trial be made of husbands
love by their practice and performance of the forenamed duties, it will be
found that they for the most part come as far short in love, as wives in
subjection.

. 65. Of the freeness of husbands love.
III. The cause of Christ's love, was his love, as Moses notes, 3. Christ
loves freely. Deuteronomy. 7. 7, 8.
He set his love on you, because he loved you. His love arose only, and wholly
from himself, and was every way free: as there was nothing in the Church,
before Christ loved her to move him to love her, so can there be nothing that
he could hope for afterward, but what himself bestowed. Indeed he delights
in that righteousness wherewith, as with a glorious robe, she is clothed; and
with those heavenly graces, wherewith as with precious Jewels she is decked:
but that righteousness, and those graces are his own, and of his free gift,
He presents it to himself a glorious Church. Ephesians. 5. 27. Husbands love must be
free.


In imitation hereof husbands should love their wives, though there were
nothing in wives to move them so to do, but only that they are their wives:
yea though no future benefit could after be expected from them: true love has
respect to the object which is loved, and the good it may do thereunto, rather
then to the subject which loves, and the good that it may receive. For love
seeks not her own. 1 Cor. 13. 5.


Christ's love in this branch thereof should further move husbands to do what
lies in their power, to make their wives worthy of love: thus will it be in
truth said, that they dwell with their wives according to knowledge: and thus
will their 1 Pet. 3. 7.
^oue appear to be as Christ's love, free.

. 66. Of husbands loving for advantage.
Contrary is their love which is only for their own content and advantage.
Many can love no further then they may have ^ome bait to allure their
affections, as beauty, wealth, honor, ^r the like by-respects; or at least
hope of some inheritance or ^ortion above that which they have, or of some
favor that they ^xpect from their wives friends. This cannot be a true sound
^^ue: such a man may be thought to love his wives beauty, ^^heritance, and
friends rather then his wife. This love cannot last.

. 67. Of the purity of husbands love.
IIII. Christ's love for the quality is an holy, pure, chaste, 4. Christ's love
pure. Ephesians. 5. 26, 27.
^^ue: as he himself is, so is his love, as is evident by the ^^fect thereof:
for it moved him to sanctify and cleanse his Church, to make it a glorious
Church without spot: he did therefore no way pollute or defile his Spouse: and
that his love might the better appear to be chaste love, cast only upon one
Spouse and not many, he united all his Saints together by the 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13
bond of his Spirit, and made them all one body.

Hereby husbands must learn so to be affected toward Husbands love must be
chaste. Heb. 13. 4.
their wives as may stand with holiness, and chastity: though much love be
required, yet it may not ouer-flowe those banks. Marriage is honorable and a
bed undefiled. It must therefore be used as an undefiled thing. This indeed
appertains to the wife as well as to the husband. But because he is the head,
and guide of his wife, and ought to be as a pattern and president before her,
as Christ is before him, therefore is it more specially applied to him. The
purity of an husbands love here spoken of, has a double use,

1. It restrains an husbands love to his own wife. There is a general
Christian love whereby all occasions of doing good are taken, with which an
husband may, and ought to love others: and a particular matrimonial love,
whereby he is moved to prefer his wife before all, and to have his heart set
and fixed on her, and so proper and peculiar to her.

2. It orders and moderates his love, so as it turns not into sinful lust,
whereby that estate, (which in it self by virtue of Gods ordinance, is holy)
is polluted.

. 68. Of husbands lightness.
Contrary, is not only adultery, whereof we have spoken Treat. 2. part. 2.. 5,
8.
before, but also wantonness, lightness, and uncleanness with his wife. For
many intemperate and unchaste husbands, giving the raines to their headstrong
lusts, manifest as much vnseemlinesse and plain filthiness in their words,
gestures, and actions (to say nothing of their thoughts which are not seen) to
their wives, as other do to strumpets and harlots which is a most shameless
thing, and I am even ashamed ^ mention: but because it is mentioned, let such
know, the they shall be accounted among such whoremongers and adul^rers Heb.
13. 4.
as God will judge.

. 69. Of husbands loving their wives more then themselves.
The quantity of Christ's love cannot be expressed: for the 5 Christ's love
extended to the giving of himself
measure of it was above measure. Ephesians. 5 25.
He gave himself for his Church, and in that respect he calls himself that
John. 10. 11.
Good shepherd that gave his life for his sheep. and 15. 13.
Greater love then this has no man. What will not he do for his spouse, that
gave his life for her?

This may seem to be too high a strain, and pitch of love for an husband to
attain unto: a matter wherein he is to How husbands must love their wives more
then themselves. 1 John. 3. 16.
^eaue his pattern, and not to follow Christ: but yet S. John adds even this
extent to the love of our brethren: We ought says he) to lay down our lives
for the brethren: therefore by ^ust consequence for our wives. But that this
extent be not stretched too far, and husbands cast into a pit of needless
^erill, two cautions must be noted,

1. That there be an absolute necessity, to bring us to this Cautions about an

^raite of parting with our life: which is, when the good we ^ime at in the
behalf of our wives cannot any other way be ^ffected, but by venturing our
life. There was no other way ^^ redeem the Church, but by the blood of Christ.

2. That the good we intend in this case to our wives be of ^reater value then
our temporal life: as is the good of her ^ule, the saving of it. Thus the
Apostle says, I will most gladly bestowed for your souls. Which mind men
must much more 2 Cor. 12. 15.
^rie toward their wives. It was for our salvation that Christ ^ue himself.

. 70. Of husbands unkindness.
Contrary is their unkindness that prefer every trifle of ^^eir own before
the good of their wives: their profit, their ^easure, their promotion, clean
draw away their hearts and ^^fections from their wives. If any extraordinary
charge must ^ laid out, or pains taken for their wives good, little love ^ll
then appear: whereby it appears that there was no true ^^d sound love settled
in their hearts toward their wives. As ^ld and other like metals are tried by
the fire, so love by ^^ictions and crosses.

. 71. Of combats in pretense of wives honor.
Contrary in another extreme is the ouer-bold and ouer-heady pretended manhood
of such husbands as upon every jealous surmize and slight report, are ready to
make challenges of fight, and to enter into single combats and duels, on
pretense of maintaining their wives honor. This being no warrantable course of
righting a wrong, no honor can redound to the wife thereby, but much dishonor
and danger to the husband. If he prevail over his adversary and kill, he is
made guilty of murder thereby, and so reproach and shame must needs come to
himself, wife, and whole family: if he be overcome and slain, she may be
reputed more guilty then she was before. And often it falls out that God in
just judgment gives over the challenger into his adversaries hand, because he
has undertaken so indirect a course.

. 72. Of husbands Treat. 3.. 6. 6 Christ's love perpetual.
Constancy in love.
VI. The continuance of Christ's love was without date: Ioh. 13. 1.
Having loved his own, he loved them unto the end. His love was constant (not
by fits, now loving, then hating) and Hos. 2. 19.
everlasting (never repenting thereof, never changing or altering his mind) no
prouocations, no transgressions could ever make him forget to love, and cease
to do that good which he intended for his Church: note what he said to her

lovers, yet return again to me: and again, My mercy shall not depart away.

For his love rests not on the desert of his Church, but on the
unchangeableness of his own will. As this manifested Christ's love to be true
sound love, so it made it profitable and beneficial to the Church, which,
notwithstanding her many frailties, by virtue hereof is glorified.

This last branch must be added to all the former branches Husbands must be
constant in their love.
of an husbands love, or else they will be all in vain and to no purpose. This
gives the truest trial of sound love. Such was the love betwixt David and
Jonathan: the soundest love that ever was, betwixt party and party. This
brings the greatest glory to the party which loves: and the greatest
benefit to the party which is loved. That a man's love may thus remain firm
and inviolable,

1. He must be sure to lay a good foundation; he must ground his love on Gods
ordinance: and love his wife in regard of the matrimonial bond which knitteth
them together, and that near union which thence arises; and so it will last
so long as that knot lasts.

2. He must further support and strengthen it with an inviolable resolution to
be changed and altered with no provocation, but rather to pass by all
infirmities; indeauouring in love to redress them if possibly he can: if not,
to bear with them.

. 73. Of husbands variableness.
Contrary is their variableness, whose love is ready to turn as a weather
cock with every blast of a contrary wind: now ^ender-hearted, then again
hard-hearted: now smiling, then ^owring: now giving this and that favor, then
denying every thing, even such things as are needful.

Many whose love was as hot as fire while their wives were ^oung, or their
friends lived, or while they pleased them, when those occasions are taken away,
prove in their love as cold ^s ice.

Again others by some continuance in doing good to their wives, think it a
burden: and waxing weary clean leave off their former good course; which
plainly shows that they never truly and entirely loved their wives.

By this pattern of Christ here propounded to husbands, ^e have on the one
side a good direction to teach us how to ^^ue our wives, as has been
particularly declared; and on the ^ther side, matter of humiliation, in that it
shows us how ^^re short we come of our bounden duty. Howsoever, wives ^ay
most complain of their burden, because it is a Subjection ^hereunto by nature
we are all loath to yield: yet I am sure See Treat. 1.. 10.
^^e heauiest burden is laid upon the husbands shoulders: and ^uch more easy
it is to perform the part of a good wife, then a good husband.

Quest. Is not the former pattern sufficient? Is this latter more excellent,
or more perfect?
Answ. Christ's example is a full, complete, perfect, and To Christ's example,
the pattern of ones self is added.
every way sufficient pattern; far more excellent then this of a man's self:
this is not annexed to add any thing to that, or in regard of the excellency
hereof, but only in regard of our dullness, to make the point somewhat more
plain and perspicuous. 1. Because it is more sensible.
For this pattern is more sensible and better discerned. Every one knows how
he loves his own body: but few or none know how Christ loves his Church.
Besides, 2. Because it is more imitable.
that example of Christ may seem too high and excellent for any to attain
unto, even inimitable; therefore to show that he requires no more then a man
may perform, if he will set himself with care and conscience to do his duty,
he adds the pattern of ones self; that which one does to his body, if he
will, he may do to his wife.

No direction can be taken from this latter pattern, but The pattern of
loving ones self sets forth the same things that Christ's love does.
might be referred to the former, as most of the former (though in a far
meaner manner) may be referred to the latter. For the love which a man bears
to himself is true, and entire without all dissimulation: the most dissembling
wretch in the world (who in his dealings with other men does nothing uprightly)
nor will nor can dissemble with himself; though other men shall never know the
depth of his heart, yet the spirit 1 Cor. 2. 11.
which is in him, even himself, knows it: so as this pattern also presses
truth and sincerity on husbands in their affection toward their wives: of all
other they may not dissemble and deal doubly with them; but let them know the
entireness of their affection toward them: and see they neither faune o^
them, nor flatter them. They which pretend great love to their wives in show
only, offend against nature it self. As the foresaid love of a man's own self
is for manner entire and true, so also free not forced: and for measure as
great as possibly i^ can be, and for continuance, constant, and so like to
Christ love. But there are two points especially to be considered in the love
of ones self which above others are most sensibly discerned Man is tender
toward himself.
in this pattern. 1. Tenderness. 2. Cheerfulness.

No other man will or can so tenderly handle a man's hand arm, leg or any
other part of his body, as himself: he is very sensible of his own smart.

The metaphors which the Apostle uses in these words, He nourishes and
cherishes it, do lively set forth this tenderness: Ephesians. 5. 29.
for they are taken from fowls and birds which very charily, and tenderly
houer over their young ones, covering them all over with their wings and
feathers, but so bearing up their bodies as no weight lies upon them.

Thus ought husbands with all tenderness, and mildness Husbands must deal
tenderly with their wives.
to deal with their wives, as we have before noted in many particulars: only
this example of a man's self I thought good to set before husbands, as a lively
pattern wherein they might behold a president without exception, going before
them, and whereby they might receive excellent direction for the better
performing of the particulars before noted.

Again, no friend, no parent, no other party will or can so Man is cheerful
in doing himself good.
willingly and cheerfully do any kindness for one, as a man for himself.
This among other is one especial point which the law aims at, when it
enioynes a man to love his neighbor Leu. 19. 18.
as himself, namely, as willingly and readily as himself. Whatsoever a man
does for himself he does much more cheerfully then for another. There needs
no other proof then experience. Let men take notice of their own mind and
disposition when they do things for themselves, and this will be as clear as
the light when the Sun shines forth at ^oone day.

Such an affection ought husbands to have to their wives: Husbands must be
cheerful in seeking their wives good.
they ought more willingly and cheerfully to do any thing ^or their wives
then for parents, children, friends or any other. Though this cheerfulness be
an inward disposition of the ^eart, yet may it be manifested by a man's
forwardness and ^^adinesse to do his wife good: when his wife shall no sooner
desire a kindness, then he will be ready to grant it: as ^ooz says to Ruth, I
will do to thee all that thou requirest; yea, Ruth 3. 11.
by any means he may know that this or that will be be^oofull to her, though
she desire it not, yet to effect it for her: which was the mind of the said
Booz to Ruth, as the history ^^ many particulars shows.

Contrary is the disposition of those husbands who so grudgingly, repiningly,
and discontentedly do those things which they do in their wives behalf, as
their wives had rather they were not done at all. The manner of doing them
causes more grief to tender hearted wives, then the things themselves can do
good.

Hitherto of the manner which husbands ought to observe in performing their
duties. The reasons to enforce the same remain to be handled.

any thing: especially if it be the example of some great one, a man of place
and renoune.

But who greater then Christ? What more worthy pattern? If (as was Treat. 3..
74.
showed) the example of the Church be of great force to move wives to be
subject to their husbands, the example of Christ must needs be of much greater
force to move husbands to love their wives. A great honor it is to be like
unto Christ: and his example is a perfect pattern.

Two things there be which in Christ's example are especially Two things in
Christ's pattern provoke husbands to love their wives.
to be noted to move husbands to love their wives.

1. That great inequality which is betwixt him and his spouse.

2. That small benefit which he reapeth by loving her.

For the better discerning of that inequality, the greatness of 1. The great
inequality betwixt Christ and his spouse.
Christ on the one side, and the meanness of the Church on the other, are duly
to be weighed.

Christ's greatness is in Scripture set forth by comparing him with creatures,
and the Creator. Compared with creatures he is far more excellent then the
most excellent, as the Apostle by many arguments proves in the first chapter
to Hebr. that whole chapter is spent in proof of this point: And in another
place it is said that Ephesians. 1. 21.
He is set far above all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and
every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which is to
come.

Compared with the Creator he is no whit inferior to him, but Phil. 2. 6.
equal: Heb. 1. 3.
Being the brightness of glory, and the express image of his person: and that
Job. 1. 1, 3.
word of whom it is said, In the beginning was the word, and the word was with
God, and the word was God: All things were made by him etc. So as he is the
very Creator himself, eternal, infinite, incomprehensible. Thus is Christ's
greatness inexplicable.

The meanness of the Church is as low on the other side: she is a creature,
fashioned out of the earth, proceeding from the loins of corrupt Adam, not
only finite, but in it self vile and base: The Prophet Ezec. 16. 1. etc.
Ezechiel does set her forth in her lively colors as she is in her self.
Compared therefore unto Christ she is Isa. 40. 17.
nothing, less then nothing. What equality, what proportion can there then be
betwixt Christ and her?

But if man and woman be compared together, we shall find a near equality:
and that both in the points of their humiliation, and also of their exaltation.
In regard of the former, they are both of the same mould, of the same corrupt
nature, subject to the same infirmities, at length brought to the same end. In
regard of the latter the best and greatest privileges are common to both of
them: they are both made after the same image, redeemed by the same price,
partakers of the same grace, and heirs together of the same inheritance.

Quest. What is then the preferment of the male kind? What is the excellency
of an husband?
Answ. Only outward and momentany. Outward, in the things of this world only:
for Gal. 3. 28.
in Christ Jesus they are both one. Momentany, for the time of this life only:
for Mat. 22. 30.
in the resurrection they neither marie, nor are given in marriage, but are as
the Angels of God in heaven: then all subjection of wives to husbands cease.

To conclude this point, the inequality betwixt Christ and the Church, and
equality betwixt man and wife being such as has been declared; seeing Christ
vouchsafes to love his Church, ought not man thereby be moved to love his wife?

The other point concerning the small benefit which Christ 2. The small benefit
that Christ reapeth by loving his Church.
reapeth by his Church, will yet further enforce the point: for illustration
whereof we will note the great benefit which man reapeth by his wife.

The benefit which Christ reapeth from the Church is in one word nothing. For
Christ is in himself All-sufficient: he neither needs any thing, nor can
receive any thing: Job 35. 7.
If thou be est righteous, what give thou to him? Or what receives he of
thine hand? Yet abundantly he bestows all manner of gifts, temporal, and
spiritual, earthly and heavenly. It was not therefore his own good that he
respected in loving the Church, but her good: for he being 1 Timothy 3. 16.
God became man; being Lord of heaven and earth, he took upon him Phil. 2. 6,
7.
the form of a servant; being 2 Cor. 8 9.
rich he became poor: having the Reu. 1. 18.
Keys of hell and of death, and being Act. 3. 15.
the Lord of life, he Phil. 2. 8.
humbled himself, and became obedient unto the death: thus to show love to his
Church he left much for her sake, but received nothing of her.

But the benefit which man reapeth from a wife is very great: for Genesis 2. 18.
It was not good for a man to be alone: in so much as Pro. 18. 22.
He who finds a wife finds a good thing; and that in all the points of
goodness, a profitable thing, a comfortable thing, a delightful thing. They
know not the benefit of the married estate, who See Treat. 2. Part. 1.. 27.
prefer single life before it, especially if the married estate be ordered by
Gods word, and man and wife careful to perform their own duty each to other.

To apply this point also, and to bring it to the conclusion: Christ's example
remoueth all pretenses which men make for not loving their wives.
If Christ who can receive nothing from the Church notwithstanding love her,
ought not men much more to love their wives, who many ways receive much good
from them, and without whom they cannot well be?

This example of Christ is the rather to be noted, because it clean wipeth
away all those false colors, and vain pretenses which many allege as
reasons, to show that there is little reason they should love their wives: some
of their pretenses are these.

1. Their wives are of a far meaner rank then 1. Object.
themselves; should they then perform duty to their inferiors? They commonly
who marry their kitchen maids, or others far under their degree, allege
this pretense.

Answ. I might reply, That marriage aduanceth a wife to the degree of her
husband: and that it was his own folly to marry one so mean: but for the
purpose and point in hand, let any tell me, whether the supposed disparitie
betwixt them and their wives, be in any degree comparable to that which is
betwixt Christ and the Church: yet Christ thinks not much to do duties of
love to his Church.

2. There is nothing in their wives worthy to be loved. 2. Object.


Answ. This very thing, that such an one is thy wife, is matter enough to make
her worthy of love. But what was there in the Church to make her worthy of
Christ's love? If it be said that she is endued with many excellent graces,
which make her amiable in Christ's sight: I answer, that of her self she has
none of those graces, Christ has bestowed them upon her, and so made her
^miable: and thus ought thou to endeavor by using all good means thou can
to make thy wife answerable to thy love: but howsoever, to love her.

3. Their wives give just occasion to be hated by reason of their 3. Object.
beeuishnesse, stoutnesse, insolency, and other like intolerable ^ices.

Answ. No occasion may seem just to move an husband to hate his wife: nor any
vice seem to him intolerable: with goodness he ^^ught to overcome evil. If
notorious sins seemed intolerable to Christ, or that he thought any occasion
just to cause hatred, many that are of his Church would often draw his hatred
upon them: but Christ hates never a member of his Church.

4. There is no hope that ever I shall receive any help of my 4. Object.
wife, or benefit from her.

Ans. There is little charity in such as can conceive no hope: for ^ue hops
all things: but yet the case so stands with Christ. The 1. Cor. 13. 7.
Church is so utterly unable to help or benefit him, as he may justly ^y, he
cannot hope to receive any thing from her. Christ loves the church for her own
good, not for his; so ought husbands. Thus if Christ's example be well weighed,
and observed of husbands, it will ^ford matter enough to remove every doubt or
scruple raised to ^enate their affections from their wives. Fitly therefore
has the Apostle set it before husbands, both to direct them how to love their
wives, and also to move them so to do.

. 76. Of a man's love to himself, a motive to provoke him to love his wife.
To the same purpose that Christ's example tends, tends also the pattern of
a man's self. Great is the affection that a man bears to himself, to his
own flesh, his own body: he never hates, but ever loves himself: no sore,
no disease, no pain, no stinch that the flesh brings to a man, can make him
hate it: but rather all manner of infirmities do make him the more to pity,
tender, and cherish it. This is a work of nature: the most heathenish, and
barbarous, that ever were, do it. Now a wife being to a man as his body and
his flesh (for they two are one flesh) and God having commanded men to love
their wives as their own bodies, these conclusions will necessarily follow
from this motive:

1. He that loves not his wife is more carried with the instinct of nature,
then with the express charge of the God of nature. Natures instinct moves him
to love his body. But Gods express charge moves him not, to love his wife.

2. He that loves not his wife is worse then an infidel and a barbarian, yea
then a very beast: for all these love their own bodies, and their own flesh:
but a wife (by Gods ordinance) is as ones body, and his flesh.

3. He that loves his wife loves himself: the Apostle himself verse. 28.
in these very words lays down this conclusion: from whence by the rule of
contraries this also will follow, He that loves not his wife, loves not
himself.

4. He that loves not his wife cannot but bring woe and mischief upon
himself. For the damage and mischief which follows on a wife, through any
neglect of duty on her husband part, follows also on him: as the mischief
which follows on the body through any negligence of the head, lights also
on the head.

If these be not motives sufficient to provoke an husband to love his wife, I
know not what can be sufficient.

The fifth Treatise. Duties of Children.
. 1. Of the general Heads of Childrens duties.
EPHESIANS. 6. 1. Children obey your Parents in the Lord: for this is right. 2.
Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise.) 3.
That it may be well with thee: and thou may live long on the earth.
THe second couple in a family are Parents. Children.


In laying down their duties, the Apostle begins with children: his
direction, and instigation unto them is laid down in the three first verses of
the sixth chapter: wherein 1. He declares their duty. 2. He adds reasons to
enforce the same.


In laying down their duty he notes three points. 1. Wherein it consists,
(obey, honor.) 2. To whom it is to be performed (your parents.) 3. After what
manner it is to be done (in the Lord.)


The reasons used by the Apostle are four. 1. The place of parents (in the
Lord.) 2. The aequitie of the thing (this is right.) 3. The charge of God
(Honor thy father, etc.) 4. The reward promised (That it may go well, etc.)


Under this word (obey) which the Apostle uses, and that word (honor) which
the law uses, are all those duties comprised, which any where thorowout the
whole Scripture are enjoined to children.

We will therefore set them down in some order, and handle them distinctly one
after another. 1. The Fountain of childrens duties is to be searched out. 2.
The Streams that flow from thence are to be observed.


The Fountain is an inward disposition of the heart compounded of love and
fear.

The Streams issuing from thence extend unto parents, both while they are
living, and also when they are dead.

Childrens duties which are to be performed to their parents while they live,
have respect to their Authority. Necessity.

The Authority of parents requires of children Reverence. Obedience.

Their Necessity requires Recompense.

The duties which children owe to their parents deceased, respect their Body.
Credit.

Their Body with decency must be buried.

Their Credit with honor must be maintained.

. 2. Of Childrens love to their Parents.
I make the fountain of childrens duties to be a mixed and compound
disposition, in respect of that authority and affection which is mixed
together in parents. The authority of parents requires fear in children: and
their affection, love. So entire and so ardent is parents affection toward
their children, as it would make children too bold and insolent if there were
not authority mixed therewith to work fear: and so supreme and absolute is
their authority over them, as it would make children like slaves to dread
their parents, if a fatherly affection were not tempered therewith to breed
love. But both these joined together make a very good composition: love like
sugar sweetneth fear, and fear like salt seasoneth love: and thus, to join
them both together, it is a louing-feare, or a fearingloue, which is the ground
of childrens duties.

Where Christ forbids an excessive love in children to Mat. 10. 37.
their parents, he implies that parents are a fit object for children to love
(so as their love be well moderated:) yea he implies that it is an affection
even by nature ingraffed in children to love their parents. Joseph is commended
unto children as a worthy pattern in loving his father, and that from his
youth till the decease of his father: in testimony whereof in his younger
years he brought to his father the evil report of his Genesis 37. 2.
brethren, whereby he incurred their envy and hatred, which he would never
have done, if he had not loved his father: and having been long absent from
his father, when by Gods providence there was offered an occasion for him to
meet with his brethren, one of his first questions to them was about their
father: Genesis 43. 7.
and hearing that he was living, he thought it not enough to send him food for
his need, but must also needs see his face, Genesis 45. 9.
and have him dwell with him: and while his father was in the way he went out
to meet him, and at first sight fell on his neck, Genesis 46. 29.
and wept a good while (a token of great affection.)

That love which naturally parents bear to their children, Reasons. 1. Equity.
ought in equity to breed in children a love to their parents. For love
deserves love: and most unworthy are they to be loved, who cannot love again.
The love of parents above all others is to be answered with love on childrens
part to the uttermost of their power, because it is free, great, and constant.

Besides, there is a necessity of love in children to their parents, 2
Necessity.
lest for want thereof, their subjection (which of all others ought to be most
free) should turn into slavish servitude.

This ought children the rather to labor after, because by nature they are
nothing so prone to love their parents, as their parents are to love them. Love
is weighty, and, as weighty things, it descends. Children therefore with
conscience of duty must labor to make supply of this defect, and help nature
by grace. I deny not but naturally there is in children a greater love to
their parents, then to others: yet in comparison of the heat of parents love to
them, their love to their parents is but cold. Wherefore as the heat of the Sun
shining much and long on a stone wall, draws a reflection of heat from that
wall: so the hot beams of parents love, which with feruency and constancy is
cast on children, ought to provoke and stir up children to send forth a
reflection of love on their parents.

Two extremes are contrary to this affection of love.

One is want of natural affection, which is a vice most odious (...). Romans 1.
30. 2 Timothy 3. 3.
and abominable in all, but most of all in children. The Apostle reckons this
among the most heighnous vices that be.

The other is hatred and despite of parents: a vice more then monstrous, and
unnatural. From thence comes mocking and cursing of parents, whereof we
shall afterward hear.

. 3. Of a childs fear of his parent.
To the forenamed duty of love, must fear be added, which is a childs awful
respect of his parent.

This awful respect arises from an honorable esteem which a child in his
judgment and opinion has of his parent, as he is his parent; and from it
proceeds on the one side, a desire and endeavor in all things to please the
parent, and on the other side a loathnesse to offend him.

In this respect the fear of a child is opposed to the fear of a slave. For
a childs fear being mixed with love, has respect to the offense which a
parent may take; but a slaves fear, which is ordinarily mixed with hatred,
has respect to nothing but the punishment which his master may inflict upon
him. The forenamed fear is so proper to children, as that awful respect which
the Saints bear to God, is called a See Treat. 1.. 4.
siliall or child-like fear.

This fear in a child is an especial branch of that Exo. 20. 12.
honor which the law requires of children to their parents: and it is in Leu.
19. 3.
express terms enjoined to children by the law. That phrase which God uses
of Miriam ( Number. 12. 14.
If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven
days?) shows that there ought to be such a fear of the parent in a childs
heart, as should work shame in it when the parent is offended.

A worthy pattern we have hereof in Genesis 27. 12.
Iaakob, who was loath to gain the blessing with offense of his father.

This fear keeps love in compass: and restrains a child Reasons. 1.

to his parent. For as the heart is affected the carriage will be ordered.

Contrary hereunto is that light, or (which is more abomi^nable) Contrary,
light and base esteem of parents.
that base and vile esteem of parents, which is in the heart of many children:
especially if parents be poor, of low degree, unlearned, ignorant, or subject
to any infirmities. It cannot be but that Genesis 9. 22.
Cham had too light, if not a base esteem of his father, when he derided him.
A true filial fear would have restrained him from that extreme.

Wherefore to breed and cherish this fear, and to prevent, How to breed and
cherish a filial fear.
^r redress the contrary extreme, let children well inform themselves of
their parents place and authority, how they are in Gods stead, and a means
under God of their childrens being: children have received their very substance
from the sub^tance of their parents. In which respect though they should ^eeme
contemptible to others, yet not to their children.

Thus much of a childs inward disposition toward his parent. The
manifestation thereof must be by his outward carriage: and that in two things;
Reverence, and Obedience: both which respect a parents authority.

. 4. Of a childs Reverence in refraining speech before his parent, and in
hearkening to his parent.
The outward reverence which children owe to their pa^^nts consists partly in
their speech, partly in their carriage.

For refraining speech two virtues are requisite Silence. Patience.

Patience in hearkening to their parents.

The two branches of silence, in forbearing to speak (espe^^^lly when parents
are speaking, or till parents give leave to their children to speak,) and in
breaking off speech, when parents come into the place where children are
speaking, are tokens of great reverence. Thus children testify that there are
some in place whom they much respect and honor. Job does thus set forth the
respect which Princes and others did bear to him in his prosperity, The
Princes (says he) refrained Job. 29. 9, 10.

of childrens patience in enduring Children must patiently hearken to their
parents speech. Verse. 25.
their parents speech; which Job also notes in these words, Unto me men gave
ear, and waited, and kept silence. Though parents in their speech seem to be
long and tedious, yet must children endure it.

And it is very needful that patience be added to silence, because many
parents in tender love of their children, and earnest desire of their good,
think they can never speak enough in instructing and admonishing them. The
many exhortations Genesis 49. 2. Pro. 1. 8, and 4. 1. and 7. 1.
given in Scripture unto children to hear, hearken, give ear, give heed,
mark, and observe the words of their parents, do imply the forenamed silence
and patience: for they who Iam 1. 19.
ought to be swift to hear must be slow to speak. I deny not but much more
is intended under those phrases, namely, obedience: yet must these also be
presupposed: for he that will not in silence patiently hearken to his parents
while they speak, will much less obey what they say.

Contrary to silence is sauciness (as we speak) and overmuch Contrary, 1.
boldness of speech.
boldness in children, when, without due respect of their parents presence,
they will be prating of this thing or that thing: insomuch as if strangers
should come into the room where such children are, they would not think that
their parents were in presence; or if they knew it, they might well think that
such children bear little respect to their parents.

Contrary to patience in hearing, is fretting and murmuring 2. Impatient

against parents (if at least their speech be any whit long) an^ flinging or
slinking away before they have done. These faults are the greater, if children
by their loquacitie, or impatiencie hinder or interrupt their parents speech
when they are giving any admonition or instruction: for thus they show both too
light a respect of their parents: and also too little regard of the means of
their own good.

Father unto himself, as a title of great dignity.

Object. This title is so proper to God, as Matt. 23. 9.
We are to call none ^n earth Father.
Answ. This is not simply to be taken of the title it self, but of the mind
of him that gives or affects that title.

If it be affected or given to obscure Gods Fatherhood, or to make a man a
Father of himself without dependence on God, ^r reference to him, who is
properly the father of all, it is an ^mpious and sacrilegious title. But
otherwise lawful and warrantable.

In Scripture the title Father is given to all degrees of dignities among men,
as to 1 Samuel 24. 12.
Kings, 2 Kin. 5. 13.
Captains, and other chief Governors, to Judge. 18. 19.
Priests, 2 King. 6. 21.
Prophets, 1 Cor. 4. 15.
Apostles, and other 1 Timothy 5. 1.
Ministers. In the fifth commandment all superiors are compri^ed under it,
therefore Father is a title of great honor: and ^y the rule of relation Mother
is a title of as great honor to ^^e female sex. Religious and dutiful
children have ever used ^^ give those titles to their parents. My Father, says
Genesis 22. 7.
Isaak to Abraham, and and 27. 18.
Iaakob to Isaak. 1 King. 2. 20.
My Mother, says Solomon to ^athsheba. I find also the title of Matt. 21. 30.
Sir or Lord, used: a title (...). Genesis 31. 35. (...)
^f honor.

2. By using few words before their parents: and those few 2. By few words.
^ot without just occasion, being first spoken to by their pa^^nts, or having
leave of them, or making known to them me needful matter: at least not
against their parents liking, as their parents should be offended thereby. And
if they ^bserue their parents to be unwilling to hear them speak any ^ore of
such and such a matter, then ought they to lay their hands upon their mouths,
as Isaak (Genesis 22. 7.) and Iaakob (Genesis 27. 12.) This is a token of great
respect.

3. By meek and humble speeches. Such was the speech of 3. By humble speech.
1 Samuel 19 4.

seriously busied, or in company, or in passion. When 1 Samuel 19. 6.
Saul was out of passion, how well did he accept Ionathans Apology for David?
but and 20. 30.
in his passion, how ill did he take it? This wise observing of fit opportunity
shows great reverence.

their parents they shall be spoken unto. Eli was as a father to Samuel:
therefore when 1 Samuel 3. 4, 6,
Samuel thought that Eli called him, he presently and readily answered, Here am
I: and when Eli was instant to know what the Lord had said to him, 18.
Samuel told him every whit, and held nothing from him. Mat. 21. 30.
The younger son (noted in the parable) showed a sonne-like reverence in giving
a willing and ready answer to his father, though he failed in his obedience, by
not performing what he promised.

. 6. Of the vices in children contrary to the forenamed reverence in speech.
Contrary to those branches of reverence in speech are, Contrary, 1. Scorning
to acknowledge a parent.


1. Pride: when children scorn to give the title of Father, or Mother, to
their parents. This is the mind of many who have gotten more wealth or honor,
then ever their parents had. In public especially such children most refuse
to give those titles. Solomon was not so minded. He being a great king, sitting
upon his throne, in sight and hearing of all his people that were about him,
called Bathsheba Mother. 1 King. 2. 20.


If children had that regard to the honor of their parents which they should,
they being themselves in places of honor and dignity, would the rather openly
call their parents Father and Mother, that they might be known to be the
father and mother of so eminent a person.

2. Loquacity, and too much importunity, or rather impudency 2. Too much
importunity.
in speech, when children having to do with their parents, can never have done
(as we speak) but must needs v^^ matters to the very uttermost. Many parents
are often much provoked hereby. It skilleth not that the child have the right,
especially in a matter of no great consequence. For reverence sake the child
must forbear, at least for a time. And if the matter of difference be weighty,
as in points of religion, the child must either take some other opportunity of
better informing his parent, or else get some other wise friend to do it.

3. Stoutnesse, when children answer their parents as if they 3. Stout answers.
Ne filius cum patre quoquo modo expostulet, cum lex interdixit, tum anteleges
ipsa natura. Greg. Naz. in senten. Matt. 21. 29. Luke 15. 29.
were their equals: giving word for word. It does as ill become children to
answer again, as servants (to whom the Apostle has expressly forbidden it,
Tit. 2. 9.) Both law and nature forbids children to be provoked hereunto, by
any thing that their parents say or do; how great then is their fault who give
scornful and stout words to their parents when they are no way provoked, as
the elder son noted in the pa^able, and the elder brother of the prodigal
child?

4. Indiscretion, when children have no respect to any time, business, or
temper, of their parents in speaking to them, and 4. Unseasonable speech.
Ephesians. 6. 4.
so, much provoke them. It is laid down as a caveat to parents, that they
provoke not their children to wrath. How much more must children observe that
cauear?

5. Stubbornness, when children pout, loure, swell, and give 5. Stomachfull
silence.
^o answer at all to their parents. This is too common a fault in children, and
many parents are much offended and grieved ^hereat. We heard. 4.
before of a childelike silence which was ^ery commendable, and a token of
great reverence; but this is worthy of much blame, a token of great
undutifulness; and carefully to be avoided, as that to be practiced.

. 7. Of childrens reverend speeches of their parents.
So true and entire ought that reverend respect to be which children bear to
their parents, as their speech not only to them before their faces, but also of
them behind their backs, must (...) so framed both for matter and manner,
when they have any ^^casion to fall into speech of their parents, as all that
hear ^^em may note them to bear a reuererend respect to their ^^rents.
Direction for children how to speak of their parents.


As a general direction for the better performing of this ^^ty, let children
speak nothing of their parents that they would be loath should come to their
parents ear. More particularly, let them speak of those things which most
tend to their commendation, that so (as Christ said of his father John 8. 49.
) they may honor their parents. Let other things be buried in silence so much
as in them lies. And if others speak of matters disgraceful to their
parents, let them interpret in the better sense things doubtful, and, so far
as they may, extenuate things evident, and sharply reprove them that slander
their parents. This is that blessing which children owe to their parents, for
neglecting whereof the wiseman taxes children saying, There is a generation
that does not bless their Prou. 30. 11.
mother.

Contrary to that kind of blessing is discovering of parents Childrens
irreverent speeches of their parents.
infirmities, noted in cursed Genesis 9. 22.
Cham, and broaching untruths of them, noted in impious 2 Samuel 15. 3.
Absalom, and mocking and cursing them Prou. 30. 11.
expressly condemned. The reward whereof is by Leu. 20. 9.
Gods law death: yea a shameful and ignominious death, for the Pro. 30. 17.
Ravens of the valley shall pluck out his eyes, and the young Eagles shall eat
it: Genesis 40. 19.
which phrase sets forth the end of a notorious malefactor that is hanged.

. 8. Of a child's reverend carriage to his parent.
As the speech, so the carriage of children toward their parents must be
seasoned with reverence: for 1. This is a fruit, and proof of filial fear as
well as that. 2. Of the two, this is the surer evidence: for actions are better
signs of the disposition of the heart then words. 3. Fair words joined with
contrary deeds, cannot but be accounted merely complementall and
hypocritical. 4. Where there is a contrariety betwixt words and deeds, the one
will be a witness against the other, and that man's condemnation the greater.
Childrens reverence to their parents manifested, 1. by meeting them.



Wherefore let all reverence be manifested in childrens behavior to their
parents, and that in these and such like instances.

1. If a parent be coming to a child, and the child observe it, let him
haste to meet his parent: so did Genesis 46. 29.
Joseph to his father, and 1 King. 2. 19.
Solomon to his mother. Which two examples are the rather to be noted, because
both were in eminent place: one a great governor, the other a king.

2. Let such child-like obeisance be performed as becomes 2. By obeisance to
them.
the age and sex, either in going to, remaining before, or going from a parent:
as uncovering the head, bending the knee, bowing the body, standing up, with
the like. The two forenamed eminent persons, Genesis 48. 12.
Joseph and 1 King. 2. 19.
Solomon, bowed, the one to his father, the other to his mother.

3. Let the countenance, and gesture of the body be so soberly 3 By well
composing the countenance.
and modestly ordered in the presence of the parent, as may argue due respect.

4. Let the upper place, and hand be given to parents: and 4. By giving the
upper hand.
if occasionally a child be above his parent, let him come below him. For that
is a manifest token of inferiority and subjection. What makes men to strive
for the upper hand, but because they would be accounted better then those with
whom they strive? But that ought not to be the mind of children to their
parents.

Quest. What if children be in estate more wealthy, or honorable then their
parents, are they then to give the hand to them?
Answ. No honor is comparable to the dignity of fatherhood: it gives a
greater eminency to the parent over his child, then any other honor can to
the child over his parent. I grant that a child may by some office, and
outward dignity be so advanced above his father, as other men may more honor
and reverence the child, and give the upper place to him: and for order sake
the child may and ought to take it in company: but when they are alone, the
child must rather reverence the father.

5. According to the custom of the time and place wherein 5. By asking
blessing.
they live, let children ask their parents blessing.

. 9. Of childrens asking their parents blessing, whether it be lawful or no.
Some doubt is made of this duty both in regard of the thing it self, and also
of the gesture of kneeling used in the performance thereof: I will therefore
distinctly prove both.

For the thing, it is noted of Iaakob that he carried sauory meat to his
father, that he might bless him: and of Joseph, that Genesis 27. 19.
he went to his father, and carried his two sons with him, Genesis 48. 1. etc.
that his father might bless both him and them: for which end the twelve
sons of Iaakob assembled to their father. Genesis 49. 1. etc. How the blessings
which the patriarchs gave their children are patterns to others.


Object. These were extraordinary examples: the Patriarchs were endued with the
spirit of prophecy, whereby they revealed to their children what their estate
should be in the times to come: for knowledge whereof their children came to
them.

1. Answ. Their blessings were more then predictions of things to come: they
were confirmations and assurances to the Sea Treat. 6.. 58.
children that God would indeed perform that blessing which their parents had
pronounced. For they sustained a double person: the person of a Prophet, and of
a father; as prophets they foretold things to come: as fathers they obtained
the blessings pronounced, and an assurance thereof to their children, Heb. 11.
20.
and that by faith and prayer.

2. Answ. Though all parents cannot with such an extraordinary spirit assure
unto their children any distinct particular blessing, yet the faithful prayer
of parents is an especial, and ordinary means to obtain a blessing from God
upon their children: and that because of Gods promise which extends Genesis 17. 7.
Act. 2. 39.
it self not only to fathfull parents, but also to their seed. Wherefore as
the children of the patriarchs came to their fathers to be assured of some
extraordinary blessing, so may other children go to their parents as a means
to obtain an ordinary blessing. It is noted of Eliah that by an extraordinary
spirit in prayer he obtained extraordinary matters: Yet Iam. 5. 17.
the Apostle sets forth that example to all Christians as a motive to stir
them up in faith to pray for ordinary blessings. But for further clearing of
this point, note the phrase (...)
used in the fifth commandment as a reason to move children to honor their
parents: this it is word for word, That they may prolong thy days, etc. how
can parents prolong their childrens days, but by begging that blessing of God?
See Treat. 6.. 4. Prou. 15. 8. How wicked parents may bless their children.
The prayers then of parents are a great blessing to children, and children
ought to seek this blessing of their parents.

Object. If parents be wicked, their prayer is abomination: what blessing then
can children look for from wicked parents?

Answ. Though God hear not wicked parents in love and goodness to themselves,
yet for the good of their children he may and will hear them: and that the
rather to maintain a reverend respect of parents in the heart of their
children. For asking a blessing is an acknowledgement of superiority and
authority, according to that of the Apostle, The less is blessed Heb. 7. 7.
of the greater.

Concerning the gesture of kneeling, it is answerable to the It is lawful for
children to kneel to their parents. Genesis 48. 12.
gesture which of old was used by Gods people in like case: of Joseph it is
said that he bowed down himself with his face to the earth.

Object. Kneeling is a gesture proper to Gods worship.
Answ. It is not so proper, but that it may be used in civil cases: else
Christ would have reproved the young man for kneeling before him as well as for
calling him good: for he conceived Mar. 10. 17.
Christ to be but a mere man, and the worship he did him was but civil.

It is not simply the gesture, but the occasion of the gesture, the mind of
him that performs it, and the end why he performs it that makes it divine,
or civil. Cornelius fell down before Peter with conceit of some divine
excellency in him, and was not allowed: his manner of worshipping was divine.
The iaylor fell down before Paul and Silas in acknowledgement of some outward
eminency in them, and was not reproved: his manner of worshipping was merely
civil. The same gesture may be performed to different persons with a different
respect. A child may kneel to his parent, and to the king. Yet it follows
not that he makes his parent a king. Neither will it follow that by kneeling
to his parent he makes him a God, because men kneel to God.

. 10. Of the vices contrary to childrens reverend gesture toward their parents.
Contrary to the forenamed branches of reverend gesture, are, Irreverent
gestures of children.


1. Rudeness and unmannerliness, when children know not how to put difference
betwixt their parents and strangers, but can 1. Rudeness.
suffer their parents to come to them, and they abide in their place and not
stir to meet them.

2. Disdainful stateliness, when they think much to stand 2. Stateliness.
bare-headed any while in their parents presence. It falls out many times,
that when parents and children are together before their betters, they will
show more reverence then these: for the father will stand, and be uncovered,
when the son sits down and puts on his hat, upon conceit that his father
does more reverence then is meet: but if it were so, yet the son for the
fathers sake should stoop somewhat the lower.

3. Wantonness and boldness, when children are ouer-familiar 3. Boldness.
with their parents: toying and gigling upon every light occasion. This kind
of carriage cannot but much tend to the disgrace and dishonor of parents. For
what can they who behold it think, but that such children have been too much
cockered and ill nurtered?

4. Ambition, when children are so ambitiously desirous of place, 4. Ambition.
especially in company, as rather then be under some whom they suppose to be
at least their equals, they will be above their parents. This often falls out,
when parents being of a lowly mind, give place to such as their children,
being of a lofty mind, think meaner then themselves. Now rather then they
will be under their inferiors (as they suppose) they will be above their
parents. A point of great insolency. Such ought to be the respect of a child
to his parent, as he should debase himself below those that are his
inferiors, rather then exalt himself above his parent. As with other men, for
peace sake, in many cases, a man must depart from his right; so especially with
his parent, in case of superiority. Would not every one that knows what
honor a child owes to a father, condemn that child's ambition, that should so
stand upon the place and hand, as to take them of his parent?

5. An ouer-nice and erroneous opinion of those, who think it 5. Refusing to
ask blessing.
unmeet for any child to ask their parents blessing. Their own conceit more
swayeth them, then the continuali approved practice of Gods people in all ages:
not unlike him whom Solomon says to be wiser in his own conceit, then seven
men that can render Pro. 26. 16.
a reason. Others, though they do not so generally disa^ow this duty, yet
they think it meet only for young children: not considering of what years,
stature, and state, Joseph was, when he performed it.

As for those, who think it not unlawful, yet carelessly neglect it, they
little consider the benefit of a parents blessing. Profane Esau shall another
day rise up in judgment against them. He Gen 27. 34. Heb. 12 17.
beggd and beggd again and again, and that with a loud cry and salt tears, a
blessing of his father.

Thus much of childrens reverence. Their obedience follows.

. 11. Of childrens obedience.
The obedience of children does most prove the authority of parents, and is
the surest evidence of the honor a child gives to his parent: therefore is
it Ephesians. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20.
by name in the text expressed, and all other duties are comprised under it.
Reverence without obedience is a mere mockage, nothing at all acceptable. Of
the two, a child were better fail in the former: instance the Matt. 21. 31.
parable of the two sons. Reverence in comparison of obedience is but a
complementall honor. Obedience is a true real honor; the surest trial of a
dutiful child. Obedience is a duty so proper to children, as the Apostle
applies it to them as a proper attribute, saying, 1 Pet. 1. 14.
as obedient children fashion not, etc. The example of Christ is herein set
before us as a pattern: Luke 2. 5 1.
he was subject to his parents. Solomon counts the neglect thereof a Pro. 23.
22.
despising of a parent.

Contrary is disobedience and rebellion: the greatest impeachment Disobedience
most contrary to parents authority.
of parents authority that can be. For to what end is authority over those
who resist it, and rebel against it? The 2 Timothy 3. 2.
Apostle reckons disobedient children among the lewdest persons that be: and
sets forth their disobedience by Tit 1. 6. (...).
a metaphor taken from untamed, headstrong beasts, that will not be brought
under the yoke: the word therefore is not unfitly translated unruly: and it is
somewhat answerable to an Deuteronomy. 13. 13. (...) ex non and profuit. Hier. absque
iugo. quasi (...)
Hebrew phrase given to disobedient children, viz. sons of Belial, which is
according to the notation as much as sons without profit; or, as some will
have ^it, sons without yoke, that is, such children, as refusing to be in
subjection unto parents, are no way profitable, but work much mischief, and
cause great grief. The Deuteronomy. 21. 18, etc.
punishment which by Gods law was appointed to disobedient and rebellious
children, was a public shameful death.

. 12. Of childrens forbearing to do things without consent of parents.
That children may the better know their duty in this respect, The parts of a
child's obedience.
I will distinctly set forth, both the parts, and also the extent of a child's
obedience: 1. Wherein it consists. 2. How far it extends.


The general parts wherein it consists are two:

1. A forbearance from doing things without consent of parents. Of the several
ways whereby consent may be given, see Treat. 3.


2. A performance of such things as parents will have done.

The former of these is a duty whereunto children are must bound while they
are under their parents government. For that. 19. Number. 30. 17.
time the consent of parents is not only meet, but necessary: and that for
these reasons.

1. Children are as the goods of their parents, wholly in their power, to be
ordered and disposed by them. On this ground Satan having all that Job had put
into his hand, took liberty over Job 1. 12, 19.
his children as well as over his goods and chattell.

2. Children while they be under government, (even the eldest that are heirs)
differ nothing from servants. Galat. 4. 1.


3. By Gods law given to the Jews, parents had power to sell Exodus 21. 7.
their children.

4. Parents had power to disanull such things as children had done. Instance
the case of a vow made to God, which was one of Number. 30. 4.
the most inviolable things that one could do.

Contrary is the opinion and practice of many, who hold parents consent at the
most but a matter of conueniencie: that it is good, if children will, to have
their parents consent: if they have it not, the matter is not great: their
contracts or other things which they do, are as firm, and good, without, as
with their consents. If this were so, wherein is the authority of a parent
more then of a wise experienced friend? It is meet, and good to have such an
ones consent.

But that the power of parents, and duty of children in this point, may the
better be seen, I will exemplify it in five particular cases. 1. Entering into
a calling. 2. Making marriage. 3. Disposing of goods. 4. Ordering apparel. 5.
Making vows.

. 13. Of consent of parents for childrens entering into a calling.
I. That children ought to have the consent of their parents in making choice
of their calling, and not place themselves as they please, is evident by the
approved practice of the Saints recorded in Gods word. Genesis 28. 2.
Iaakob was sent by his parents to Laban to be educated under him. 1 Samuel 16.
11, 19.
David was appointed by his father to keep sheep: when Saul was desirous to
have David attend upon him, he sent to Ishai, David's father, for him. In that 1 Samuel 17. 17.
Ishai was ^o careful to send provision to his three eldest sons that followed
Saul to the war, we may well think, that they went to the war with his
consent. It is noted of Jer. 35. 7.
Ionadab, that he appointed his ^onnes to dwell in tents, and that accordingly
they did so, and are ^ommended and rewarded for this their obedience. It is
collected ^oth by Justin. Mart. in Dial. cum Tryph. contr. Iud.
ancient and Erasm. paraphr. in Mar. 6. Bez annot. in Mar. 6.
later Divines, that our Lord Jesus Christ Basil. lib. de vit. solit. cap. 15.
Theod. Eccl. hist. l. 3. 6. 23.
(...) his younger years, before he began to exercise his public ministry,
occupied himself in his fathers trade: and that this was ^^e thing wherein he
manifested his subjection to his parents. This collection is made by comparing
Luke 2. 51. (where his sub^^ction is noted) with Mar. 6. 3. and Mat. 13. 55.

Equity requires that parents should have an hand in placing ^^th their
children, because they brought them forth into the ^orld, and brought them up
with much care, pains, and charge, ^hile they were young, and till they were
fit for a calling.

Besides, Godhath laid it as a charge upon parents, that they ^ould see their
children well trained up: great reason therefore 1. Equity.

charge. Bellarm. de Mon. lib. 2. cap.


. 14. Of the unlawfulness of childrens entering into religious orders without
consent of parents.
Contrary is the opinion of Papists, who say, that children may 36. Licet
filijs ingredi religionem inuitis parentibus.
^er into religious orders, not only without consent, but also a^^^nst the
mind and good like of their parents. Whereby they (...) not only patronize
apparent disobedience in children, against the express word of God; but also
disable children from helping their parents in case of necessity: for both
which Christ rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees in a like case.

Object. Papists do grant that if parents be in such necessity, Conditio est,
vt parents non sint in tali necessitate, vt sine siliorum auxilio viuere non
possint. Tunc enim tenentur ex praecepto Dei parentibus adesse. Bellarm. loc.
cit.
as they cannot live without their childrens help, their children may not by
entering into any religious order forsake their parents. For they are bound by
the law of God to succor their parents.

Answ. 1. This caution has been extorted from them by evidence of argument
taken from Gods word, and pressed by their adversaries.

2. It touches not the principal argument taken from Gods precept, which they
make of none effect by this their tradition.

3. Though parents be not at that present, when children first enter into their
religious order, in such extreme need, yet they may be afterward. But after
that children are once entered, they hold it utterly unlawful that children for
any necessity of the parent, should attend upon them for their succor.

Object. Children being entered into religious orders may Eos iuvant quomodo
religiosos decet, nimirum precibus apud Deum. Bellarm. ibid.
help them, as becomes religious persons, by their prayers to God.

Answ. 1. This is iumpe the Pharisees Corban, whereof Christ makes mention,
Mar. 7. 11. and whereby he notably discovers the hypocrisy of the Pharisees,
who made pretense of religion, an hinderance to that obedience which God
required of children.

2. To pray for that which a man indeuoureth not to do, when he may do it, is
a plain mocking of God.

The arguments which they allege for confirmation of their erroneous opinion,
are taken from extraordinary examples, or from mystical resemblances, as 1.
Abraham's leaving his fathers house. Genesis 12. 1. Deuteronomy. 33. 9.
2. Leuies speech of his father and mother, who said, I have not seen him. 3.
The advice given to the royal Queen, Forget thy fathers Psalm. 45. 10.
house. 4. The trial of our love of Christ by loving him more Mat. 10. 37.
then father or mother. 5. Christ's forbidding one that followed him to go and
Luke 9. 60.
bury his father.


Answ. 1. For Abraham's example, 1. it cannot be proved that he left his fathers
house without the consent of his father. 2. He was then married, and so of
another house. 3. He had Genesis 12. 1.
an express particular charge of God to leave his fathers house, even as he
had to sacrifice his son. Except the like charge can be showed, his example
makes nothing to the purpose.

2. For Leuies speech, 1. It was noted by Moses in relation Exo. 32. 26, etc.
to a particular zealous fact of the Levites in executing the vengeance of the
Lord, and so to be reckoned among such extraordinary things as are not
exemplary. 2. That which moved the Levites to make no difference betwixt their
parents and others, was the Lords cause: their parents and kindred as well as
others had notoriously sinned against God, and in that respect the Levites took
no notice of them. But they are not such parents which Papists teach children
to forsake, but any parents. Now what consequence is this; Some children have
been Gods Ministers in executing just punishment on their wicked parents,
therefore children may enter into such places as shall exempt them from helping
any parents, though well deserving? 3. The Levites had an express charge for
that which they did: but that which Papists infer from their Exo. 32. 27.
example does make the commandment of God of none effect. Mat. 15. 6.


3. For the Psalm. 45. 10.
advice to the Queen, 1. It is mystically to be taken. 2. If it should be
literally taken, it is to be taken as given to her after marriage, when she was
out of her parents government. 3. It has relation to the Genesis 2. 24.
law of marriage, and implies not a simple forsaking of parents, but a
preferring of a husband before them.

4. For the loving of father and mother more then Christ, (...). It does not
necessarily imply a forsaking of our parents: ^or we may love Christ more then
them, and yet perform ^uty to them. 2. If they be forsaken, it must be in
opposition to Christ, that either Christ or they must be forsaken, in that if
we cleave to them they will draw us from Christ.

5. For Christ's forbidding one that followed him to go and bury his father:
1. It was because of an extraordinary calling which he had. 2. It is set down
as a pattern to Ministers, to show that they should especially attend upon
their proper function, and leave other secular matters to be performed by such
as can perform them well enough. To apply it to childrens forsaking of
parents, is to pervert the sense of it.

Thus we see to how little purpose the forenamed arguments are alleged to
prove that erroneous opinion of childrens entering into religious orders without
their parents consent. I might further show how irreligious their pretended
religious orders be, and so show how unlawful it is to enter into them, even
with consent of parents: but that makes nothing to the point in hand.

. 15. Of the unlawfulness of childrens traveling, and binding themselves
prentises without consent of parents.
Contrary also to the forenamed part of childrens obedience, is the practice of
such children as travel, and seek their fortunes (as they speak) without
consent of parents, like the Prodigal child, if not worse: for it is likely
that he forced Luke 15. 12, etc.
from his father a general consent, in that he obtained of him his portion of
goods. These usually bring great grief to their parents, and many times make
them fear more then is cause, as old Iaakob feared, when he knew not what was
become of Genesis 37. 35.
his son.

Among those aberrations may be reckoned a custom in this land more usual
then lawful, for children to bind themselves prentises without consent of
parents: to which fault they who take indentures of such children, or otherwise
covenant with them without knowledge of their parents consent, make themselves
accessory. Arguments to prove that children may not marie without parents
consent.


. 16. Of parents consent to the marriage of their children.
II. That children ought to have their parents consent unto their marriage is
without all question evident. For

1. God himself has given us herein a pattern: He first brought the woman to
the man (Genesis 2. 22.) whereby he would show that he who gave a being to the
woman, had a right to dispose her in marriage: which right parents now have: for
from them under God, children receive their being. In this case parents stand
in Gods room, and are as it were Gods hand to join their children in marriage.

2. God has given express laws concerning this point. To omit that general
moral law, Honor thy father and thy mother (which, as it is the ground of all
other duties appertaining to children, so of this also) the authority and
charge which God by his law (Deuteronomy. 7. 3) has laid upon parents, to give their
daughters to husbands, and to take wives for their sons, has the force of a
law to bind children from taking wives or husbands, without or against their
parents consent. This law was not proper to the Jews only; but as a branch of
the moral law it is pressed upon Christians, 1 Cor. 7. 36. 37.

To this may be added the judicial law (if it be to be accounted merely
judicial) of a parents power in giving his daughter, or refusing to give her
in marriage to him that had defloured her, Exo. 22. 17.

3. Answerable to the law has been the practice of Gods Saints recorded and
approved in Scripture. Isaak married the wife which his father provided (Genesis
24. 67.) Iaakob both obeyed his father in going to Labans house for a wife
(Genesis 28. 2.) and also when he came to Laban asked his daughter of him (Genesis
29. 18. etc.)

Though Sampson saw a daughter of the Philistims which Non est virginalis
pudoris eligere maritum: electionem mariti parentibus deferat. Ambr. de Patr.
l. 1. c. 9.
pleased him well, yet would he not marry her before he had his parents
consent, Judge. 14. 2.

4. These words of Thamar (2 Samuel 13. 13.) Speak unto the King (who was her
father,) for he will not withold thee from me, show that children were not
wont to be married without consent of parents: Which is further confirmed by
this oath of the Israelites, There shall not any of us give his daughter

ad eccles. Affric.
unto Benjamin to wife, Judge. 21. 1.

5. Filij sine consensu parentum rite and iure nubere no^ possunt. Tertul. ad
vxor. l. 2.
The ancient fathers of the Church have in their ages taught children this
duty, and pronounced marriages of children without consent of parents, to be
unlawful.

patres. Ovid. Metam. 4. Me parenti potius quam amori obsequi oportet. Teren. in

heathen have observed the equity hereof. Though Shechem loved Dinah, and had
defloured her, yet would he not mary her without the consent of his and her
father, Genesis 34, 3. etc. Ismael had learned as much either by the instruction
he had received out of Abraham's house, or else by the light of nature; for he
stood to the choice which his mother made for him, Genesis 21. 21.

7. Though Council. Trid. decr. de reform. matr. c. 1.
Papists in other cases make the authority of parents to be of no effect, yet
in this case they count it utterly unlawful for children to marry without or
against their parents consent: and have thereupon made Canons against it.

Many Divines of good note and name have judged such marriages as have been
made simply without, or directly against parents consent (especially if parents
have just cause of exception against those marriages) to be of no force till the
parent be brought to ratify them: and in many Churches upon due examination of
the matter, they use to account them as no marriages. Experience has manifested
the boldness of many children in setting light by their parents consent in
those places where marriages once consummated are ratified, Hoc fieri debere and
ciuilis and naturalis ratio suadet. Justin. Instit. l. 1. tit. 10. Digest. l.
23. tit. 2
and made indissoluble, though they have been made simply without or directly
against parents consent. Many children think, though it be unlawfully done,
yet being done it shall stand. Whereupon if they doubt of their parents
consent, they will cast how to get their marriage consummate, so as their
parents may not know of it to hinder it before it is done: and after it is
done, impudently resolve to bear out as well as they can, the storm of their
parents displeasure. To prevent such contempt of the power of parents, and to
establish that authority which God has given them over their children,
marriages without or against parents consent as aforesaid, are in many Churches
made void.

. 17. Of the equity of the point, and reasons why children should have their
parents consent unto their marriage.
1. By marriage children are put from their parents: for The reasons alleged.
Genesis 2. 24.
Man must leave his Father and Mother, and cleave unto his wife. Is it not then
great reason that they from whom children 12. may be applied to this particular.
had their being, and by whom they have been maintained and trained up till
the time of their marriage, should have notice of that kind of leaving them, and
consent thereto?

2. A parents power by the marriage of his child is passed over to the husband
or wife of the child. And shall such a power be taken away without consent of
parent?

3. Children for the most part being heady and rash for want of experience; and
seeking more to satisfy their present carnal desire, then to provide a good
lasting help for themselves: but parents by the instinct of nature loving
their children as well as children love themselves, and having by much
experience better understanding of a meet help, and better able to use their
discerning gift in this case, because it is not their own case, and yet the
case of one whom they love as themselves, and to whom they wish as much good as
to themselves; is it not meet even for the child's good, that in a matter of
such moment as marriage, the parent should have a stroke?

. 18. Of a child's carriage in case a parent provide an unfit mate or none at all.
Quest. What if parents urge their children to marry such Whether parents may
force their children to marry, or no.
as they can not affect and love: must children therein against their mind and
liking yield obedience?

Answ. If there be no just exception against the party commended, they ought
with the uttermost of their power to endeavor See Treat. 6.. 54.
to bring their affection to the bent of their parents will: and as an help
thereunto, be persuaded that their parents are as careful of their good as
they themselves are, and wiser then themselves: yea above all they ought to
make instant prayer unto God (in whose hand man's heart is to turn it Prou. 21.
1.
whither soever he will) that he would be pleased to alter the course of their
affection, and to settle it on the party whom their parent has chosen for
them; if at least they see no just cause to the contrary. But if
notwithstanding all the means that they can use, they still find their heart
altogether auerse, they may in a reverend manner entreat their parent to
forbear to press that match, and to think of some other.

2. Quest. What if the parent be negligent, and in due time provide no fit
match, may not the child provide one for himself?

Answ. A parents negligence is not a sufficient pretext to make a child cast
off that subjection which he owes to his parent. Yet I deny not but that a
child knowing where a fit match is to be had, may make known as much to his
parent (as Sampson did) and crave both his consent and help thereunto. Judge.
14. 2.
And if his parent give no ear to his humble suit, he may use the mediation of
his kindred or other friends. Yea if necessity require that the child be
married, and his parent add wilfulness to negligence, and will not be moved
at all, neither by the humble suit of his child, nor by the earnest
solicitation of any friends, means may be made to the Magistrate (who is in
Gods place over the parent as well as over Qui liberos iniuria prohibuerint
ducere vx eres vel nubere, per praesides cogantur in matrimonium collocare Di
est. lib. 23. tit. 2. 19.
the child, and ought to afford relief unto the child) and what the
Magistrate does in that case is as good a warrant to the child as if the
parent had done it.

The like means may be used if a parent be an Idolater, Heretic, or Atheist,
and will not yield that his child be married to any but to one of his own
profession and disposition.

. 19. Of the sin of Children in marrying without their parents consent.
Contrary is the mind and practice of such children as over lightly esteeming
their parents power, take matches of their own choice: and that sometimes
privily without giving any notice at all to their parents: and sometimes most
rebelliously against their parents mind and charge: not much unlike those who
in the old world are condemned for taking wives of all that Genesis 6. 2.
they chose (which was one branch of that wickedness for which the world was
drowned) or rather like Esau who took Genesis 26. 35.
such wives as proved a grief to his parents. What blessing can be expected to
fall upon such marriages? or rather what curse may not be feared to follow them?
Gods law is transgressed thereby: his Image in parents despised, that which is
more proper to them then any goods; or fraudulently, or violently taken from
them: their souls grieved thereat: and they See more mischiefs following such
marriages,. 21.
often provoked to cast off their children, and curse their marriages. Now Gods
curse does often follow the just curse of a parent.

. 20. Of objections for childrens marrying without parents consent, answered.
1. Object. Though Iaakob married one wife according to his parents direction,
yet he married other three (at least the two maids) without their consent.

1. Answ. Iaakobs example in marrying more wives then one is not justifiable.

2. Answ. Iaakob had a general consent of his parents to Genesis 28. 2.
take a wife of the daughters of Laban: if therefore his marying of two wives
had been lawful, neither this nor that daughter had been taken without all
consent of his parents. As for the two maids of whom he had children, neither
of them was his wife: for long after they had children they are called his
maids, Genesis 32. 22.
and distinguished from his wives.

2. Object. Servants may mary without their masters consent: why then not
children without their parents?

1. Answ. See Treat. 8.. 17.
It is not lawful for servants so to do while the ^ate of their covenant
lasts.

2. Answ. Though the servitude of a servant be greater ^hen of a child, yet a
parent has in many respects a greater ^ower over his child, then a master
over his servant. The ^ower which a master has is by a mutual covenant
betwixt him and his servant, and by the voluntary subjection of a ser^ant unto
his master. But the power of a parent is by the bond of nature, in that a
child has his being from his parents. Be^ides, this subjection of a child to
his parents in case of marriage, is not for servitude but See the third reason
in. 17.
for the good of the child.

3. Object. Children marry for themselves and not for their parents, why then
should parents consent be so much stood upon?

1. Answ. Though they marie not for their parents, yet they marie See the
second reason in. 17. Psalm. 127. 3.
from their parents: by marriage they are freed from the power of their parents.

2. Answ. Children are not their own: they are the inheritance of the Lord:
the Lord has given them to parents as an inheritance: a child therefore may
no more marry for himself without consent of parents, then alienate his
parents goods for himself.

. 21. Of stealing children from parents for marriage sake.
To the. 19.
forenamed sin, and to the vengeance thereof, do they make themselves
accessory, who fraudulently allure, or violently take away children to marry
them otherwise then their parents would. This is a worse kind of felony then
stealing away the goods of a man. For children are much more properly a man's
own, then his goods: and dearer to him then any goods can be: yea and so much
more highly to be esteemed, by how much reasonable creatures are to be
preferred before senseless, and sensual things. Our Anno 4. and 5. Phil. and
Mar. stat. 8.
statute law expressly condemns this, and imposes a severe punishment on such
as shall offend therein. And justly do such offenders deserve to be severely
punished, both in regard of the heinousness of the sin, and also in regard
of the many Mischiefs arising from marriages without parents consent.
mischiefs which follow thereon, as, Alienation of parents affection from
their children, Disinheriting heirs, Enmity betwixt the friends of each party
so married, Litigious suits in law, Ruin of families, and (if the personages,
whose children are married without their parents consent, be great and noble)
Disturbance of whole towns, cities, and nations. Instance the destruction of
the Shechemites Genesis 34. Causa mali tanti coniux. Virg. Aeneid. 6. Qui rapta
longum cum coniuge bellum Attulit in patriam. Ovid. Met. l. 12. lege. Hor.
Carm. l. 1. Od. 15.
This is said to have been the cause of the ten years war betwixt the
Grecians and Troianes, and of the ruin of Troy.

. 22. Of ministers sin in marying children without parents consent.
Such ministers also as through Carelessness, not taking due account of the
parties whom they marie, whether they have their parents consent or no; or
through bribery, being hired by reward, do marie such children as they know
have not their parents consent; do in an high degree make themselves accessory
to the. 19.
forenamed sin. Their fact is as bad as the fact of the principals
themselves. Their solemnization of such marriages emboldneth both the parties
that are so married, and also all the persons that are present thereat. They
highly dishonor Gods holy ordinance, in that bearing the person of God they
say of such as God has forbidden to be so joined together, Those whom God has
joined together let no man put asunder. If ministers had not their hand in such
unlawful marriages, they could not be made: for our Church ratifieth no marriage
but what is made by a minister. Wherefore some minister or other is guilty of
this foul sin, whenever any child is married without consent of parents.
Well therefore does our Church (to prevent this sin) expressly forbid
ministers to marie any without parents consent: and inflict a severe censure on
them that shall offend therein.

. 23. Of childrens forbearing to dispose any of their parents goods without
consent.
A third branch of the subjection of children in forbearing to do any thing
without their parents consent, is about their parents goods.

That children though living in their parents house, ought not without their
parents consent to dispose their goods, is evident by the extent of their
obedience, in all things.

In that Isaak was pleased to send Iaakob to Padan Aram without any great
provision, it seems that Iaakob made conscience of taking any thing privily,
but went as his father sent him Genesis 32. 10.
with his staff. And the Genesis 31. 36.
apology which he made to Laban his father in law concerning things taken away,
shows that he held it unlawful for children privily to convey ^way their
parents goods. What is my trespass? what is my sin? (says he) what have
thou found of all my household stuff?

Does he not hereby imply, that if Labans daughters had taken away any of their
fathers goods, it had been a trespass and sin?

The Apostle says of the heir (who of all the children may Reasons. 1.
Children under parents are as servants.
seem to have the greatest right) that as long as he is a child (that is,
under the government of his parents) he differs nothing from a servant,
though he be Lord of all. If he differ not from a servant, what right can he
have at his pleasure Gal. 4. 1.
to dispose his parents goods? Has a servant any such right?

It is very requisite that children herein should be tied to their parents
consent, both for the good of parents, and of children themselves.

Of parents, that they may know what they have, or have 2. Good of parents.
not, and accordingly order their expenses. How can parents tell what they
have, if children privily without their knowledge purloin and dispose their
goods?

Of children, that their lavish humor might by this means 3. Good of children.
be restrained: (for youth is much prone beyond moderation to spend, if it have
wherewithal) and that their parents may the better lay up for them. 2 Cor. 12.
14.


. 24. Of the sin of children in purloining and wasting their parents goods.
Contrary is both the opinion and practice of many It is a sin for children.
children.

For opinion, many think and say, that whatsoever is their 1. To mutter at
their parents allowance.
parents, is theirs also: and thereupon being through the watchful eye and
provident care of their parents restrained from ouerlauish spending, or from
laying out any thing with their own hands, they murmr against that restraint.

Knowledge and persuasion of their subjection in this case, would be a good
means to suppress that repining humor.

For practice, 2. Privily to purloine their parents goods. Genesis 31. 19. Who
counsel children to convey away parents goods are accessory to theft.


1. Some privily take away and purloine what goods, money, wares or any thing
else they can come by of their parents. This the holy Ghost accounts plain
theft: for Rachel having privily taken away her fathers idols, the Scripture
says that she stole them.

Hereunto do they make themselves accessory, who counsel and encourage
children so to do: as many busibodies, and deceitful persons advise
daughters, when God has taken away their mothers, to take away linen, and
other-like household stuff from their father, pretending that their father may
marie another wife, who will carry all away: And upon like pretense also
persuade sons when their fathers die, to convey away what they can from their
mother. But such pretenses are no sufficient warrant unto children to deceive
their parents. It were better for children to be deprived of their parents
goods, then to enjoy them with such deceit: for they will be like that bread
which is sweet to a man, and afterward his Pro. 20. 17.
mouth is filled with gravel.

2. Others riotously spend their portion, like the prodigal 3. Wastfully to
spend. Luke 15. 13.
child, and run into debt, and so make their parents either to pay it, or to
leave them to the law. Many Scholars at the Universities, Gentlemen at Innes
of Court, and such children as are somewhat liberally trained up in their
parents, or other friends houses, do much offend herein. Little does this
excess and riot differ from the forenamed kind of theft: and ordinarily it
brings as many mischiefs as that does.

3. Some also be so ungracious and ungrateful, that being 4. To defeat their
parents of their goods cunningly.
come to years, and their parents grown old, seek to defeat their parents of
all they have, and to bring their parents under them, to be ordered by them:
laboring to get possession of all before their parents be dead, or before they
be willing to resign any such right unto their children. Such were 2 Samuel 15.
10. etc.
Absalom, and Adoniah. How highly displeasing such practices are to God, the
vengeance which fell upon the pates of 1 King. 1. 5. etc.
those two Brethren in evil, traitorous, and disloyal children, does show.

All such children as seek after the forenamed, or any other like means to
defraud their parents, do very ill repay their parents care over them, and
more like Barbarians, then Christians, recompense evil for good: they often
bring poverty and ignominy upon their parents and themselves: they are worse
then other thieves, because they are more dearly accounted of, and more freely
trusted: yea they are a very bad example to servants in the house, or subjects
in the commonwealth.

. 25. Of childrens contentedness to be apparelled after their parents mind
and liking.
IIII. A fourth branch of the foresaid subjection of children is about their
apparel, that it be no other, then may stand with their parents good liking.
It is noted that Israel Genesis 37. 3.
made Joseph a coat, does not the particular mentioning of that circumstance
show, that parents must have the ordering of their childrens apparel? Which is
also intimated in the reason given of Tamars garment of diverse colors, namely
because 2 Samuel 13. 18.
with such garments were the kings daughters, that were virgins, apparelled.
And whereas Rebekah had the keeping of her Genesis 27. 15.
son Esaus clothes, it appears that his clothes were to the mind of his
parents: else he would have hid them from them: for further confirmation
whereof it is noted that his apparel was pleasing to his father.

Contrary is the vainglorious humor of many children, Childrens sin in
apparelling themselves to the grief, and disgrace of their parents.
who to the grief and discredit of their parents, apparel themselves both
against the mind, and also above the ability, and unbeseeming the place and
calling of their parents. Among others, many ministers children bring much
discredit on their parents hereby. Let all such proud Youths note how the Lord
has threatened to visit even Kings children that are clothed Zeph. 1. 8.
with strange apparel.

. 26. Of childrens forbearing to bind themselves to do any thing against
their parents consent.
V. The fifth and last branch wherewith I will exemplify the forenamed
subjection of children, shall be that which is expressly noted in the law,
namely a childs binding of it self by a vow.

The law gives the parent power to disanull his childs Number. 30. 4.
vow. It is therefore a childs duty to abstain from vowing without his
parents consent.

Contrary are such vows as Papists allure children to make, Unlawful vows of
children.
namely, vows of continency, perpetual virginity, regular obedience,
voluntary poverty, with the like.

Though by these they be not drawn to forsake their parents (which. 14.
before we proved to be utterly unlawful:) and though these in their nature
were lawful (which they are not, because they are against Gods law and
ordinance, and against Christian liberty, and savor too rankly of Iudaisme,
yea of a worse superstition,) yet without parents consent might they not be
made.

As unlawful are oaths, and other like means, whereby children bind
themselves to the performance of such indifferent things, as their parents are
not willing they should do. What does this but bring a snare upon the
consciences of children, and cause a necessity of breaking one of Gods
commandments? either the third, in breaking their vow or oath; or the fifth, in
disobeying their parents.

. 27. Of childrens active obedience.
The affirmative and active part of a child's obedience, consists in yielding
himself pliable to his parents will; which must be added to the forenamed
negative and passive part of obedience in forbearing to do things without
consent of parents, for manifestation of a true child-like affection and
disposition toward the parent. Passive obedience may arise from mere
fullennesse, and stoutnesse of stomach. For there are many who will forbear to
do this or that without consent of parents, because they are loath to ask
their consent: they had rather have their own wills crossed in the things they
desire, then be made subject to their parents will. What does this argue, but a
stout stomach, and a disdainful heart? Besides, to forbear the doing of an
unlawful thing, is but to abstain from evil. But it is required of
Christians Psalm. 34. 14.
to do that which is good, as well as to abstain from that which is evil.
This is it which is commended in Iaakob: he did not only forbear to take such
a wife as would be a grief to his parents (wherein his Genesis 26. 34, 35.
brother Esau had offended) but also obeyed his parents in Genesis 28. 2. and 29.
18.
taking such a wife as they willed him to take.

This general point we will exemplify in four particular instances, namely,
in a child's obedience to his parents commandments, instructions, reproves,
corrections.

. 28. Of childrens obedience to their parents commandments.
I. What lawful commandments soever parents give to their children, they must
be ready to the uttermost of their power to obey. Ephesians. 6. 1.
Obey your parents, says the Apostle to children.

Parents, by virtue of their place, have power and authority to command:
Children therefore must obey, or else that power is to no purpose.

To demonstrate this by some particulars:

1. If a parent call his child, or send for him, he must readily A child must
come at the parents call.
come, yea though he know not the occasion. Eli was in place of a parent to
Samuel, whereupon the child supposing that Eli called him, 1 Samuel 3. 5, etc.
ran to him once, and again and again. and 16. 12.
David when he was sent for by his father out of the field to be anointed King,
knew not the occasion, yet came. Genesis 49. 1.
The twelve sons of Iaakob, though men grown, yet called for by their
father, assembled themselves together before him.

2. If a parent be disposed to send his child any whither, or of A child must
go at his parents word.
any errand, though it be far off, and may seem somewhat troublesome, yet he
ought to go, and do it. The. 27.
forenamed example of Genesis 28. 5.
Iaakob, the example also of and 37. 14.
Joseph (being sent to see whether it were well with his brethren) and of the
and 42. 2, 3.
ten sons of Iaakob (being sent by their father into Egypt,) and of 1 Samuel
17. 17,
David (sent to visit his brethren in the host) are in this case commended by
the holy Ghost. Of David it is noted, that 20.
he arose up early and went as Ishai had commanded him: which sets forth his
ready obedience.

3. If a parent require his child to attend upon him, he must A child at
command must attend upon the parent.
also do that. When Abram was going up to the top of Moriah his will was that
his servants should tarry behind, and that his son Isaak should attend him,
and carry the wood for the sacrifice, and accordingly Isaak obeyed. Genesis 22. 6.


4. If a parent inioyne any task, or commit any business to A child must do
the message his parent will have him do.
his child, he ought faithfully to perform it. This kind of faithful
obedience is commended in Genesis 50. 5.
Joseph, in the Ier. 35. 8.
Rechabites, and in 1 Samuel 17. 20.
David, with many others. Joseph, by reason of his great place, might not go
out of Egypt, yet to perform that which his father enjoined him, he asked
leave. The Rechabites were tempted to break their fathers charge, yet they
would not. David when he was sent by his father, from the sheep which were
committed to his custody, was careful to leave them with a keeper: 1 Samuel 17.
20.
and again, when a Bear at one time, and a Lion at another came verse. 34.
to the flock, he put his life in hazard to preserve the flock: all these
circumstances are thus noted, to set forth the great care that these children
had to discharge that charge which their parents had committed to them.

. 29. Of childrens disobedience to their parents commandments.
Contrary is a rebellious disposition in children, manifested by these and such
like practices,

1. By refusing to be at their parents call; or coming (as we speak) at
leisure, and making their parents wait for them.

2. By a lazy, sluggish pretending of vain and frivolous excuses, when their
parents would send them of an errand, like that sluggard, who says, Prou. 22.
13.
A lion is without, I shall be slain in the streets. Such pretenses are as and
10. 26.
vinegar to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes.

3. By scorning to wait on their parents; and in that respect they will slinke
out of doors, and absent themselves, when they imagine their parents will use
their service in that kind: they forsooth will not be their parents servants:
and impious conceit.

4. By refusing to do what their parents inioyne them to do, and require at
their hands, like Matt. 21. 30.
the younger son, that went not to work in the vineyard at his fathers
command. Such children for the most part offend herein, as through pride think
the business enjoined to them too mean, and base to do. Had David, or the
daughters of Reguel been of this mind, the one would 1 Samuel 16. 13, 21. and
17. 15.
not have returned to his fathers sheep, after he was anointed to be King over
Israel, and after he had been called to the Court; and the other would not
have watered their fathers sheep, especially Exo. 2. 16, 17.
among such rude and biosterous clownes, as without all respect to their place
and sex, would drive them away.

. 30. Of childrens obedience to their parents instruction.
II. Such wholesome instructions as parents give their children for the well
ordering of their carriage, children ought conscionably ^o obey: a point which
Pro. 1. 8. 9. and 4. 1.
Solomon much presses: My son, says ^he, hear the instruction of thy
father, and forsake not the law of thy another, etc. And to move children the
rather to do so, he sets before them Pro. 4. 3.
his own example, showing that he required no more of them then himself had
performed. Exo. 18. 24.
Moses, though grown to years, and a prince among his people, testified his
obedience to his father in law hereby.

1. Parents have an express commandment to instruct their Reasons. 1. Parents

children (as we shall Treat. 6.
after show.) Great reason therefore that their children hear and obey them
therein. The good instructions of any one are to be regarded, much more of
parents.

directions they can unto them, even what themselves have learned of others, or
observed by their own experience: in this respect, Solomon styles him Prou.

their children observe their instruction: for Prou. 10. 1.
a wise son makes a^glad father. Now this is a thing which children ought to
aim at, Prou. 27. 11.
to rejoice their parents heart. Esau is taxed for Genesis 26. 35.
grieuing his parents.

Contrary is their proud and foolish humor, who think they need no
instruction, their parents are too jealous of them, they are wise enough of
themselves; if their parents would but let them alone, they should do better:
thus they show themselves impious against God, rebellious against their
parents, and injurious to themselves. Such were 1 Samuel 2. 25.
Elies, and Genesis 19. 14.
Lots sons. Now note the vengeance that fell upon them.

. 31. Of childrens patience to their parents reproof.
III. The obedience of children must further Treat. 3.. 47, etc.
The reasons alleged, and the directions given concerning a wives subjection
to her husbands reproof, may fitly be applied to this part of childrens
obedience. Here therefore the same order is observed, and the several points
confirmed by proofs pertinent to children.
extend it self to their parents reproof: and that by patient bearing all
manner of reproves, and by amending what is justly reproved. That shame,
whereof the Lord speaks, which should be in a child, Number. 12. 14.
when her father has spet in her face, that is, by some outward sign
manifested his anger, implies a child's patient bearing of a parents reproof.
This patience in a child must be manifested to his parent, whether his
reproof be mild or bitter, just or unjust. In this respect a child must more
consider the person who reproves, then the matter or manner of the reproof.
Iaakobs reproof of Joseph, for his dreams which came of God, was unjust: Genesis
37. 10.
the manner of uttering it, with many short pauses, and that interrogatiuely,
implies some tartness: yet such was his patience, as we read not of one
discontented word that he gave. But most memorable is the patience of Jonathan
in this kind. His father Saul's 1 Samuel 20. 30, etc.
reproof of him was directly unjust, and out of measure bitter: yet with what
patience did he bear it? all that he replied was to make some little apology
for David: he replied nothing against his fathers opprobrious speeches.

Great wisdom may be learned by this patience: for so may a Reason. Wisdom
learned.
child better judge of his parents reproof, whether it be just or no. Though
it be unjust, yet thereby may he observe what is displeasing to his parents: at
least he may observe his parents infirmity, and so know the better how to
carry himself toward them.

Contrary is the practice of such children, as upon every reproof of their
parents are ready to * answer again. Our parents See.. 6.
are wayward, say they, who can bear them? If none else could bear them, yet
should children: for parents ordinarily bear such waywardness, and
untowardness at their childrens hands, especially while they are young, as
none else would or could.

Quest. If a parent be mistaken in a matter, and unjustly reprove his child,
may the child make no answer?
Answ. Yes, he may, so he do it mildly, reuerendly, and seasonably: not too
peremptorily crossing or thwarting his parent.

Object. Christ took up his mother very roundly for reproving Luke 2. 49.
him unjustly.
Answ. Christ as God-man was greater then his mother, and in that respect with
authority blamed her for her unjust reproof. The Virgin Marie was not
ignorant thereof, and therefore was silent.

. 32. Of childrens readiness to amend what is justly reproved by their parents.
If a child be justly for his fault reproved by his parents, See Treat. 3.. 48.
both conscience toward God, and obedience to his parent, requires that he
readily redress that which is amiss. Unless amendment of the thing justly
reproved be added to patient bearing of reproof, that patience can be no
better accounted of, then dissimulation, and plain mockage. When the father
Exo. 18. 17.
in law of Moses told him, that what he did was not well, he forthwith amended
it.

But contrarily many lewd and ungracious children continue to go on in their
wicked courses, though their parents again, and again rebuke them for it.
Just was Elies reproof of his children, but yet no amendment followed. Now
note the inference made thereupon by the holy Ghost, They obeyed 1 Samuel 2. 25.
not the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them: whereby is
implied, that to despise the just reproof of parents is an evident sign, and
forerunner of Gods heavy judgment. Solomon calls the child which will hear
no rebuke, a Scorner, Pro. 13. 1.
which notes out a most obstinate sinner that cannot be reclaimed, and in that
respect is scorned of the Lord. Pro. 3. 34.


. 33. Of Childrens submission to their parents correction.
IIII. Correction is a real reproof, a reproof in the highest degree, even
the seuerest kind of reproof: so as by subjection hereunto great trial of
obedience is made. By the same means must a childs submission to his parent
in this kind of reproof be manifested, as in the former: namely,

1. By bearing patiently the correction which his parent shall give him.

2. By amending readily that for which he is justly corrected.

The former of these is noted by the Apostle as a ruled case, a matter not to
be denied, in these words, Heb. 12. 9.
We have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them
reverence. One special part of this reverence is a patient suffering:
therefore he inferres thereupon, ought we not to be in subjection? etc.

The latter is set forth by Solomon under an effect which follows upon the
performance thereof: for having advised a parent to correct his child, he
adds this reason, Pro. 29. 17.
He shall give thee rest, yea he shall give delight unto thy soul: how can
this rest, and delight be given, but by the childs amendment of that for which
he is corrected? A parent takes no delight in the pain, and smart of his
child, but in the fruit that follows thereupon. As a childs transgression
is Genesis 26. 35.
a grief, and vexation to the parent, so his amendment causes rest and
delight. Now this effect follows not simply upon correction, but upon the
good use thereof which is made by the child. It lies therefore in the child,
and so lies upon him as a duty, to give this rest and delight to his parent
by amending the fault for which he is corrected, as he brought grief to him by
provoking him to use correction. Thus shall neither parent repent the
inflicting, nor the child repent the enduring of correction.

That a child may attain to this degree of obedience, he Direction for well
using correction.
must duly consider both the Cause whereby his parent is moved to correct him,
and also the End which he aims at therein. The cause is the Pro. 13. 24.
love he bears to his child. The end which he aims at, is his childs and
22. 15.
good. If these motives work not obedience, what can?

. 34. Of refusing, or abusing correction.
Contrary is disdain on the one side, and obstinacy on the other. Disdain,
when children scorn to be corrected by their parents: and in that respect when
by all the means they can use, they cannot avoid it, they will mutter and
murmr, fret and fume, rage and rave against their parents, and despise and
hate them for it. Obstinacy, when they will be no whit bettered thereby, but
still run on in their leaud courses, and rather wax the worse for being
corrected. This may be counted the highest pitch of a childs rebellion: for
this is the last means which a parent can use to reclaim his child from
desperate courses. If this prevails not, the law of God requires, Deuteronomy. 21.
18. etc
that a parent should give up his child into the hand of the Magistrate, that
he may be put to death.

Hitherto of the distinct branches of childrens Obedience.

The Extent thereof follows.

. 35. Of childrens conforming their judgments to their parents.
The extent of childrens obedience is only implied in this Epistle to the
Ephesians, but it is expressed (Col. 3. 20) in these words, Children obey your
parents (...).
IN ALL THINGS. A large extent, but not simply to be taken without any
limitation: for the Apostle himself notes a restraint in these words, Ephesians. 6.
1. (...).
In the Lord. So far forth as children transgress not any of Gods
commandments in obeying their parents, they ought to obey. This is to obey in
all things, in the Lord.

Treat. 3.. 63, 64, etc. The extent of childrens obedience.
The extent of childrens duties being the very same that was of wives duties:
and the restraint also the same, that order which was there observed shall here
also be kept. Only other proofs more pertinent to childrens place, shall be
brought to confirm those general propositions which may be applied to any
inferiors. Many general reasons there alleged for proof of the propositions
shall here be omitted. Wherefore compare this place with that.

Thus we see that parents authority is very large: there is no restraint of it
but Gods contrary command, whereof a child must be assured, if he refuse to
obey his parent in any thing.

It is not enough for a child to say I have thus long, and in thus many things
obeyed my parent, I hope in some things if I have mine own will, I may be
excused. No: All things comprise more then many things. Wherefore Many are not
enough. And though Gods will be exempted, yet is not thine own will exempted:
though thou may do nothing against Gods will, yet thou ought to do many
things against thine own will, if it be contrary to thy parents.

Two things are to be labored after by children for attaining to this extent
of obedience in all things.

1. They must labor to bring their judgment and will to the bent of their
parents: to think that meet and convenient for them to do which their parents
will have them do. Though Isaak thought it somewhat strange that he should
Genesis 22. 6, 7.
carry wood up to an hill to offer sacrifice where was nothing for a burnt
offering, yet it being the will of his father that he should do so, he thought
it meet enough for him to do so.

This subjection of judgment and will is to be yielded in all the particular
cases of obedience which were. 13. 14. etc.
before propounded, as in their calling, marriage, apparel, allowance, etc. So
as children are to think that kind of calling, that particular match, that
apparel, and that allowance to be meetest for them, which their parents
think meet.

If the judgment be persuaded of the meetnesse of a thing, Reason.
and the will inwardly brought to yield unto it, outward obedience will more
readily and cheerfully be yielded thereunto.

Contrary is the ouerweining conceit which many children Childrens
ouer-weining conceit of their own judgment above their parents, causes much
mischief.
have of their own judgment and will, who think they can better discern
what is fit and meet for themselves, then their parents. They imagine their
parents to be too strict and precise, or too suspicious and jealous, or too
covetous and worldly. This makes them take what callings, what matches, what
apparel, what allowance they think best; whence many mischiefs arise, which
would all easily be avoided, if they would lay down that presumptuous conceit,
and labor to observe the forenamed direction.

. 36. Of childrens yielding to practice at their parents command, such things
as in their judgments they cannot think very meet.
2. Though children cannot in their judgments think that which their parents
require to be the fittest and meetest, yet being pressed thereto by the
peremptory command of their parents, in practice they ought to yield unto it,
saying to their parents as Peter to the Lord, Nevertheless at thy word I will
do this, Thus did Genesis 27. 6. etc.
Iaakob yield to Rebekah: he thought by doing that which his mother bid him, he
should seem a ^^ocker to his father, yet she urging him, he did it.

Quest.
May not a child, yielding better reason then his parent, refuse to do what
he thinks unmeet, or at least for^eare to do what he is commanded, till he
be better informed ^f the meetnesse thereof?

Answ. With reverence and humility he may render his reason why he thinks it
not meet, and desire his parent not to urge it upon him.

(This did Genesis 43. 3.
Judah one of the sons of Iaakob, and is not blamed for it:) and parents
ought in such a case to yield to their children (as Verse. 11.
Iaakob did.) But yet if in things indifferent, parents be otherwise minded
then their children, and will have their children yield to them, they must
yield.

For, 1. In in different things the command of a parent is a warrant to the
child, by reason of this extent (all things:) so as the parent may sin in
commanding that, in doing whereof the child may not sin. Who can clear
Rebeckah of sin in commanding Iaakob to deceive his father? yet I take it,
that Iaakob cannot justly be blamed for obeying.

2. Children do thus manifest an high esteem of their parents, and very great
respect toward them: they show how desirous they are to please them, and how
fearful to offend them. When the will of parent and child consent, there is
no such trial.

3. By this means peace and love is better preserved betwixt parent and
child: a parents anger is stopped, the effects thereof avoided, and many other
mischiefs prevented, which often fall out when inferiors refuse to yield to
their superiors who have authority over them.

Contrary is their preposterous peremptorines who will do A fault for children
to be too peremptory -against their parents command.
nothing against their own mind and will, though their parents require it never
so much. This phrase ( Genesis 43. 5.
If thou will not send, we will not go down) which Judah used to his father,
though in a good cause, was too peremptory for a child. They who obstinately
refuse to do those things which are against their own mind, must needs come
short of this extent, Obey in all things. Yea they show that what they do is
rather for their own sakes because they like it, then for their parents sake.
What obedience then may that be thought to be? Yet this is all the obedience
which many children will yield. If they think not that which their parents
require to be meet, nor fair, nor foul means shall move them to do it;
whereby many children do much provoke their parents. Let such children know,
that it is every way more safe for them at the instant command of their parent
to do that which they conceive to be unmeet, then peremptorily to disobey
their parents, which is more then unmeet, even unlawful.

. 37. Of the restraint of childrens obedience.
The restraint of childrens obedience is expressed in this clause, in the Lord:
which phrase affords a necessary limitation Heb. 12. 9. (...).
in obeying their parents, who are but parents of our flesh, men and women,
subject to err in their commandments, and to require such sinful things as
their children may not with a good conscience perform. The limitation then
which the forenamed clause (in the Lord) affords, is this,

Children must perform no other obedience to their parents, then may stand
with their obedience to God. The reasons rendered by the Apostle prove as much:
This is right, this is well pleasing to Ephesians. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20.
the Lord. But to obey parents against the Lord is neither right nor
wellpleasing to the Lord.

If therefore parents command their children to do any thing See the two pair
of cautions annexed to like limitations of a wives obedience, Treat. 3.. 51.
and 52. and apply them to these 1 Samuel 19. 11. etc.
limitations of childrens obedience.
which the Lord has forbidden them, they ought not to do it. On this ground
did Michal well in suffering her husband David to escape out of the hands of
Saul her father. I justify not her manner of carrying the matter, with
untruths, and false tales; but her refusing to yield to her fathers mind and
will is justifiable, and that in two respects.

1. In that the difference was betwixt her husband and father. Now Genesis 2. 24.
and 3. 16.
by Gods law a wife is to yield to her husband rather then to her father.

2. Because she knew her father sought to slay him: if then she had delivered
him into the hands of her father, she had made her self accessory to murder.
In this latter respect Io^^athan also did well in refusing to fetch David at
his fathers 1 Samuel 20. 31, 32.
command.

Thus if a father command his child to go to Mass, to forswear himself, to
marry an Idolater, to steal, to lie, or to commit any other sin forbidden by
God, the child ought not to obey: those things cannot be done in the Lord.

Again if parents forbid their children the doing of any necessary duty
commanded of God, the child ought to do it notwithstanding the parents
inhibition. We may well think that Ahaz who set himself so violently to
deface the holy things of God, to profane his ordinances, and to shut up the
doors of Gods House, gave strait charge to his son that he 2 Chr. 29. 3. etc.
should not repair them again; yet Hezekiah so soon as he had power did
repair all.

If a parent forbid his child to go to the Protestants Churches, to hear a
Sermon, to pray in a known tongue, to give just weight, and measure, to speak
the truth when he is called to witness it, with the like; he must be of
Daniels mind, Dan. 6. 10.
and notwithstanding that prohibition, do the things which God requires.

. 38. Of childrens sin in yielding to their parents against God.
Contrary to this limitation is on the one side a flattering eie-seruice in
many children, who care not what they do, be 1. Eye service.
it good or evil, lawful or unlawful, so they may please their parents
thereby: and on the other side a slavish fearfulness, 2. Fearfulness.
which makes them so to dread their parents as they fear not God at all: they
will rather choose to sin and so provoke Gods wrath, then do any thing
whereby their parents wrath may be provoked. It is a brand set upon evil kings
that they Kin. 22. 52.
walked in the ways of their fathers, and mothers: and did wickedly 2 Chr. 22.
4.
as they counseled them. Wherefore the following and obeying of their parents
in evil was so far from extenuating their sin, as it did rather aggrauate
the same. The preferring of father and mother before the Lord Christ shows
that such a child is Matt. 10. 37.
not worthy of Christ: In comparison of Christ Luke 14. 26.
Father and mother must be hated. But that undue and vnchristian-like respect
of parents above Christ, is it that makes so many young Papists, young
swagerers, swearers, Motives to provoke children to prefer God before their
parents.
liars, deceitful persons, and lewd livers.

For avoiding the two forenamed extremes let thine heart be filled with a true
fear of God, and withal consider the difference betwixt our earthly parents
and our heavenly Father. They are but parents Heb. 12. 9.
of our flesh, he is the Father of spirits. Luke 12. 4, 5.
They can but touch the body, he can cast body and soul into hell. They are
but a while over us, he for ever. Their authority is subordinate to his, his
supreme and absolute of it self. They can give but a light temporary reward;
he, an eternal weight of glory. They cannot shelter us from his wrath, he can
from theirs.

Hitherto of such duties of children as respect their parents authority, such
as respect their necessity follow.

. 39. Of childrens Recompense.
The general head whereunto all the duties which children owe to their parents
in regard of their Necessity, is in one word Recompense, which is a duty
whereby children endeavor as much as in them lies, to repay what they can for
their parents kindness, care, and cost toward them, and that in way (...).
Arist. Ethic. l. 8. c. 14.
of thankfulness; which makes a child think he cannot do too much for his
parent, and well may he think so, for a parent does much more for his child
before it is able to do for it self, then the child possibly can do for the
parent. So as if the parents authority were laid aside, yet the law of equity
requires this duty of Recompense: so also does the law of piety and charity.
Wherefore of all other Duties this is most due. 1 Timothy 5. 4. (...).
It is in express terms given in charge to children by the Apostle, who
wills them to learn to requite their parents.

Contrary is neglect of parents in their need, which is more It is monstrous
ingratitude for children to neglect their parents.
then monstrous ingratitude. As all ingratitude is odious to God and man, so
this most of all, and yet very many are guilty thereof. In them the proverb is
verified that love is weighty. For it is the property of weighty things to fall
down apace, out to ascend slowly, and that not without some violence. Thus
love from the parent to the child falls down apace, ^ut it hardly ascends
from children to parents. In which respect another proverb says, One father
will better nourish nine children, then nine children one father. Many children
in his kind do no more for their parents, then for strangers. They either
consider not how much their parents have done for them; or else they conceit
that what their parents did, was of mere duty, and needs no recompense. Fie
upon such barbarous and inhumane children!

. 40. Of infirmities whereunto parents are subject.
The rule of the forenamed recompense is on the one side A rule of recompense.
the parents Necessity, and on the other, the childs Ability. So as in every
thing wherein a parent needs his childs help, the child to his power must
afford his best help. Beyond ones power nothing can be expected. Ultra posse
non est esse.


A parents Necessity may be through Natural infirmities. Casual extremities.

Natural infirmities are Inward. Outward.

Inward Infirmities are weakness of judgment, slipperinesse of memory,
violence of passion with the like; whence proceed frowardness, testiness,
suspiciousnesse, jealousy, fear, grief, etc.

Outward Infirmities are such as arise from some instant temptation, as were
Genesis 9. 21.
Noah's and and 19. 33.
Lots drunkenness; and 19. 33.
Lots and 2 Samuel 11. 4.
David's uncleanness; Genesis 12. 13.
Abraham's and and 26. 7.
Isaakes dissimulation; and 37. 34, 35.
Iaakobs and 2 Samuel 18. 33.
David's excessive lamentation, etc.

Some of these latter, which may seem most heinous and odious sins, are then
to be accounted infirmities, when they who commit them make not a sport of
them, nor delight to live and lie in them, as swine to wallow and lie in the
mire: but only at some times, through some temptation, as it were unawares,
fall into them; and after they are committed they are themselves more ashamed
of them, and more grieved for them, then any other that see them, or hear of
them.

In regard of the natural infirmities of parents, the duty of children is
both to bear with them, and also to cover them so far as they can.

. 41. Of childrens bearing with their parents infirmities.
Children bear with their parents infirmities when they do not the less
reuerendly esteem their place, or person, nor perform the less duty to them
because of their infirmities.

This is the first particular branch of recompense. For children in their
younger and weaker years are subject to many infirmities: if parents had the
less respected them for their infirmities, and from thence had taken occasion
to neglect them, and would not have borne with them, surely they could not have
been so well brought up. That great patience, long-sufferance, and much
forbearance which parents have showed toward their children, requires that
children in way of recompense show the like to their parents as occasion is
offered. It was a great infirmity in Isaak to prefer Esau a profane child,
before Iaakob a religious child, especially against Gods express word
concerning Iaakob; yet Iaakob respected not his father a whit the less for it,
as appears by his Genesis 27. 12.
fear to offend him, and by his and 28. 5.
readiness to obey him. and 37. 10.
Iaakobs unjust reproof of Joseph was no small infirmity, and yet how much
Joseph reverenced and every way respected his father the history following
shows. Saul's infirmities were far more and much greater then any of theirs,
yet what duty and faithfulness did Jonathan his son perform to him, even
to their deaths? for 1 Samuel 31. 2.
he died with him.

We have herein the pattern of Christ himself: how great infirmity did his
mother bewray, when ouer-rashly she rebuked him being about a good work, a
bounden duty, his Fathers business? yet immediately thereupon it is noted that
he went down with his parents, and was subject to them: which Luke 2. 51.
manifests the honor he gave to his mother, notwithstanding her infirmity.

Contrary to this duty do they, who take occasion from their parents
infirmities to think basely of their person and A child may not despise a
parent for any infirmity.
their place, and thereupon grow careless in duty, either refusing to do any
duty at all, or else doing it carelessly, grudgingly, disdainefully, and
scornefully. Absalom made a supposed infirmity of his father the ground of his
rebellion. Had 2 Samuel 15. 3.
his pretense been true, yet had it not been a sufficient cause for him to
disgrace, and rise against his father, as he did. The law that threatens Gods
vengeance against such children as mock at their father, or despise to obey
their mother, makes Pro. 30. 17.
no exception of parents infirmities.

. 42. Of childrens covering their parents infirmities.
Children cover their parents infirmities both by passing by them (as we
speak) and taking no notice of them, and also by concealing them from others
as much as they can. The Scripture notes it to be a property of love to cover
a multitude 1 Pet. 4. 8.
of sins: now in whom should love abound, if not in children? And who should
more manifest this property of love then children?

Of passing by and concealing from others a parents infirmity, we have a worthy
pattern in Shem and Iaphet: when Noah their father being drunken lay uncovered
in the midst of his tent, they went backward (that they might not themselves
Genesis 9. 23.
see their fathers infirmity) and covered his nakedness (that others might not
see it.) The blessing which upon this occasion was then promised to them and
their posterity, shows how acceptable this duty was to God.

Contrary was Chams practice, who discovered, and made A Sin for a child to
discover a parents infirmity.
known his fathers nakedness. The curse thereupon denounced against him,
shows how odious that sin was unto God. Too many there be of Chams cursed
brood, who blaze abroad their parents infirmities, and make such things known
of them, Genesis 9. 22. Verse. 25.
as otherwise would not be known: whereby they bring much dishonor and shame
upon their parents (which can be no honor Parent is imprecatione nihil
perniciosius excogitari potest. Plato de Leg. lib. 11.
to the children,) and withal a curse from their parents on themselves, which
the heathen accounted very dreadful.

More contrary was Absoloms practice, who raised a most malicious slander of
his father, and thereby alienated his subjects hearts from him. Too many
Absolom-like seek to raise a supposed More then monstrous for a child to
raise a slander of a parent.
reputation and honor to themselves by vilifying and disgracing their parents:
but let them note Absoloms end. Assuredly, if they hold on in that course, the
like, or a worse, shall be their end.

. 43. Of childrens bearing with their parents casual necessities. 2 Samuel 15. 3.

Casual extremities, are all manner of crosses which by the providence of God
are laid upon a man: whether upon his body, as blindness, lamenesse,
sickness, etc. or on his person, as captivity, banishment, imprisonment, etc.
or on his estate, as pouerrie, penury, etc. In all these, children must bear
with their parents, as in the forenamed infirmities; neither less reuerendly
esteem of them, nor perform the less duty because of them. These are such
necessities, as are not sinful in themselves; and therefore in regard of
these, parents are much more to be borne withal. Though Isaak were blind, yet
did not Iaakob a whit the less respect Gen 27. 1. Ruth 1, 16, 21.
him. Though Naomi were poor, yet Ruth her daughter in law continued to do a
child's duty and service unto her.

Contrary is the unnatural disposition of such children, as Unnatural to
despise a parent for any casual infirmity.
take occasion from these casual necessities of their parents to despise them.
God has made an express law against despising those who are by any outward
defects impotent, as deaf, blind, etc. If no person may despise another, for

their parents. They are worse then Cham that do so, and may look for an
heavier curse.

. 44. Of childrens releeuing their parents according to their need.
Besides bearing with parents necessities, in such cases as parents stand in
need of their childrens relief and succor, they must afford it them. In
sickness they must visit them, as Genesis 48. 1.
Joseph visited his father. In time of mourning, they must comfort them, as and
37. 35.
the children of Iaakob. In want, they must provide things needful for them,
as and 42. 8.
the sons of Iaakob, who went up to buy food for their father; and as and 47.
12.
Joseph, who sent for Iaakob into Egypt, and there nourished him. It is noted
of Ruth 2. 18.
Ruth, that she did not only gleane for her mother a poor woman, but also
reserved some of that food which was given to her self to eat, for her. In
time of danger they must do what they can for their protection and
preservation, as 1 Samuel 22. 3, 4.
David had in this respect an especial care of his father and mother. Yea, if
God be pleased to Vetustissima lex erat inscripta mentibus omnium, vt liberi si
hoc officij grauentur impendere quod pulli ciconiarum reponunt suis parentibus,
velut impij conijciantur in vincula. Erasm. Instit. Matrim.
take children out of this world before their parents, and their parents be
succourlesse, they must take what order they can for the well-being of their
parents after their own departure, as John 19. 27.
Christ, who commended his mother to his disciple John a little before his
death. These and such like duties are particular branches of recompense, and
are all comprised under that 1 Timothy 5. 4. (...).
requital, which the Apostle requires of children: And they are but a small
part of requital of all the pains, care, and charges, that parents have been
at with their children. Yea, this only thing, that parents have brought forth
children into the world, can children never sufficiently requite. Nature has
taught thus much, not only unto heathen men, but also unto the unreasonable
creatures. Among other unreasonable creatures, the example of the Arist. Plin.
Suidas.
Storke is worthy to be noted: for it is recorded of that kind, that when the
dammes are old, the young ones feed them; and when through age, they are ready
to faint in their flying, the young ones will help; and when they are past
flying, the young ones carry them on their backs. The (...) Sin of Pharisees
in freeing children from relieuing their parents.
Greek name of a Storke is taken from that word, which signifies, to requite
a parents kindness: or else this word is taken from that name: they are both
of the same notation.

Contrary is the opinion of Pharisees, who thought that children by
consecrating their substance to the Temple, might be freed from this duty of
recompense to parents, which is the mystery of that Hebrew word Mar. 7. 11.
Corban. They made a mere pretext of piety to God, a cause of manifest
impiety against parents. Christ gives this verdict of them, that verse. 13.
they make the word of God of none effect. See. 14. 1. Sin of children in
denying relief to parents.
Papists are of the same opinion, and so under the same censure.

Contrary also is their practice, who having the goods of this world, suffer
their parents to want. 1 Ioh. 3. 17. Iniquissimum est patre^ egere, cum filius
sit in facultatibus. Digest. lib. 25. tit. 3.. 5.
S. John says, that the love of God dwells not in him, who shuts up his
compassion from his brother in that case; how then can it dwell in such a
child? Not they only who suffer their parents to starve, offend in this
extreme, but they also who suffer them to live poorly, and basely, when
themselves Luke 16. 19. 2. In bringing parents into extremities.
Diues-like fare delicately, and go gorgeously attired every day.

In an higher degree do they offend, who bring their parents to such
extremities, as to poverty by their lavish spending; to prison by importuning
them to be their sureties; to excessive grief by their mischievous practices,
as Genesis 37. 34. 3. In striking parents.
the sons of Iaakob.

But what shall we say of such graceless children, as dare strike their
parents? Exodus 21. 15. 4. In murdering parents.
Gods law accounts such a child unworthy of life, and adiudgeth him to death.

Nay, what may be said of father-quellers, and mother-quellers? There was of
old no particular law made against them, because it is, supposed, that no
child can be so unnatural and inhumane. In imitation whereof Solon cum
interrogaretur, cur nullum supplicium constituisset. in eum qui parentem
necasset, respondit, se id neminem facturum putasse. Cic. pro Ros. Amer.
Solon, that wise lawmakers among the heathen, made no law against them: and
his reason being asked, he answered, that he thought no child would commit
such a fact.

When afterward such inhumane impiety was manifested in the world, the Civil
Law ordained this punishment; Si quis parentus fata propera uerit, neque
gladio, neque ignibus, neque vlli alij solenni poenae subiugetur, sed insutus
culeo cum cane, and gallo gallinaceo, and vipera, and simia, vel in vicinu^
mare, vel in amnem proijciatur, etc. Justin. Cod. l. 9. tit. 17. Cur voluerint
parricidas insui in culeum viuos, atque ita in flumen deijci, docet Cicero pro
Ros. Amer. Ad famam filij attinet, vt videatur honorem debitum patri defuncto
praestitisse. Cic. Philip. 9.
If any shall kill his parent, let him not be put to the sword, nor fire, nor
any other usual punishment: but let him be sowed in a sack with a dog, and a
cock, and a viper, and an ape, and cast into the next sea, or river; that
while life is in him, he may begin to want all use of the elements, and be
deprived, while he lives, of the air, and when he is dead, of the earth.

This sin having been committed among the heathen, the Apostle reckons it
up among other most notorious and barbarous sins, 1. Tim. 1. 9. As murder is
one of those sins, which the earth can least bear, and which cries loudest
to heaven for vengeance; so among the several kinds of murder, this is the
most unsupportable, and crying.

Thus much of the duties of children, which they are to perform while their
parents live. It remains to speak of those which they are to perform when
their parents are dead.. 45. Of childrens care to bury their parents being
dead.
The duties which children owe to their parents after they are dead, concern
the Body of their deceased pare^t. Credit

It is the duty of children to bring the bodies of their parents deceased,
with such decency and honor, as may be answerable to the place and reputation
wherein they lived.

So as both the thing it self, and the manner of doing it, is to be observed.
Burial a means to maintain hope of resurrection.


The thing it self, namely Burial of the corpse of such as are deceased, has
ever been in use in Gods Church: and it has been used as a means to
maintain our hope of the resurrection of our bodies. Many of the heathen, who
never dreamt of the resurrection, Constituere pyras: huc corpora quisque su^rum
More tulere ^a^rum, subject sieve ignibus, etc. Virg. Aeneid. 11.
were wont to burn the dead bodies of their friends: other heathen learned
this manner of burial from the Church, though they knew not the mystery
thereof. It is more clear then needs be proved, that Gods people, from the
beginning of the world, have performed this duty of burial to their friends;
but it is not pertinent to the point in hand, to insist upon the general: that
it belongs especially to children to procure this duty to be performed, is now
the point to be proved, which is readily done by the approved examples of Genesis
25. 9.
Isaak, and 35. 29.
Iaakob, and 50. 7.
Joseph, and others expressly recorded in Scripture.

And great reason there is for it: for

1. It is a testimony of great love and good respect to the party 1. Reason.
deceased. Now who should manifest more love, and greater respect then a child?

2. It is a kind of 1 King. 14. 13. 2 King. 22. 20.

be buried: as on the other side, it is a Ier. 22. 19. 1 King. 21. 23, 24. Psalm
79. 3.
curse threatened against obstinate sinners, not to be buried. In this respect,
2 Samuel 2. 5.
David blesses the men of Iabesh Gilead for burying Saul, and acknowledges it
a kindness done to Saul. Now who ought rather to procure a blessing, and do a
kindness to parents, then children, who are often blessed through their parents
means?

ground (for no carkase will be more loathsome then a man's if it lie unburied)
children, who are most bound to cover their parents deformity, are in this
respect bound to bury their corpse. Sin of children to neglect their parents
dead corpse.


Contrary is their practice whose minds are so set on their parents goods, as
they clean neglect their bodies. So soon as their parents breath is out of
their body, they so busy themselves about the things which they have left
behind them, as their corpse is ready to stink before care be taken for the
burial of it. Yea, some will purposely keep their parents corpse above ground
till they be exceeding noisome, for receiving some revenues, or debts, or other
accounts, which must be paid before the corpse be buried. If their corpse must
needs for sometime be kept above ground, let them be imbalmed, or so used as
they may not savor. They who are careless hereof, show that they respect
their parents wealth Sin of children entering upon their parents estate before
they are dead. 1 King. 1. 5.
more then his person and honor.

In which respect they also heinously transgress, who are so greedy of their
parents estate, as they must needs prevent his departure, and like Adoniah
enter upon their fathers estate, and take possession of his goods before breath
is out of his body: whereby they do often cause great disquietnesse to him that
would depart in peace.

Again, others bearing an inward grudge and secret hatred Sin of children

against a brother, or other kinsman, whom their parent entirely loved, and in
that respect durst not meddle with him in their parents lifetime, so soon, as
their parent is dead, pick a quarrel with the party hated, and so disturb
and hinder their parents funeral. Such a plot Esau intended: but God defeated
Genesis 27. 41.
it, whereby it appears that God is displeased therewith.

. 46. Of the decency wherewith children ought to see their parents buried.
The manner after which children ought to see their parents buried, must be
with such decency as is agreeable to the commendable custom of the country
and Church where their parents die, and with such honor as is in some measure
answerable to the estate, and place of their parents while they lived (at least
if it be not above the means that the parent has left, or above the ability
of the child that makes the solemnity.) Joseph was a great Governor in
Egypt, by reason whereof his father when he came thither was highly accounted
of: accordingly Genesis 50. 7.
with great honor did he carry him to his grave.

There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed decency Contrary, 1. Too
sumptuous funerals.
and honor. One is an ouerlauish and prodigal sumptuousness and solemnity
at their parents funeral, far above the estate, and far beyond the means
which the parent has left, and ^arre also above the estate and ability of the
child himself. ^ome by the needless solemnity of their parents funeral are
^^ far cast into debt, as they are never able to recover themselves again,
and so bring more dishonor to their parents by ^he weakness of their childs
estate, then honor by the so^^mnitie of the funeral: there may be great
honor, and much decency in a funeral, where is not extraordinary char^es:
instance Steuens funeral. Act. 8. 2.


The other extreme is too base and private a manner of 2. Too base funerals.
^urying their parents, much unbeseeming both their parents and their own
estate, and means; which arises from a mixture ^f pride, and covetousness
possessing their hearts. Pride ma^eth them have no solemnity at all, because
couerousnesse will not suffer them to exceed in their solemnity. Hence it
comes to pass that they choose out strange places where neither their parents
or selves are known, and the dead of the night that none may epsy them; and
appoint an uncertain time, that no friend may accompany them. God often meets
with such proud, covetous children in their kind, and causes them with like
dishonor to be brought to their graves.

. 47. Of childrens paying their parents debts after their death.
As children must have respect to the body of their parents Childrens respect
to the credit of their deceased parents.
deceased, so also to their credit and name, which is a thing of greater
account, and honor: a thing wherein they may bring a kind of blessing to
their parents and make them live after their death.

Parents themselves cannot do any thing when they are dead to preserve the
same: children therefore being the living Image of their parents must endeavor
to do it.

Three things there be which children must make conscience of, even in regard
of their deceased parents credit, and reputation; one, to pay their debts:
another, to suppress ill rumors: a third, to imitate their good example.

I. If the estate of parents, their goods or lands come to their children,
their duty is to pay their debts, so far as they can: especially if by law
those debts may be recovered at their hands. For what law may force others to
do in equity and Justice, conscience must move good children to do in
charity, and recompense to their parents. The holy Ghost makes it a Psalm. 37.
21.
note of a wicked man to borrow and not to pay. Wherefore to wipe away that blot
from the name of a parent deceased, children must be ready in this kind to do
what the parent himself, if he were living, would, or should do. Yea if
children of themselves be well able, though their parents left not sufficient
to pay all their debts, they ought to pay them. Herein especially a childlike
affection is manifested to the parent.

Contrary is their practice who strive to get all they can of their parents,
and yet make no conscience of paying any debts at all, unless law force them
thereto. What they do in this case cannot be thought to be done for their
parents sake, but rather for their own sake. Many so little respect their
parents credit in this kind, as they privily conueigh away and utterly
conceal much of their parents estate, of purpose to defeat Creditors: which
as it is a part of apparent injustice, so it is a cause of opening the mouths
of men against their parents, to their discredit and shame.

. 48. Of childrens suppressing evil reports against their parents deceased.
* The direction given before concerning childrens speech. 7.
of their parents behind their backs, may fitly be applied also to the care
which children ought to have of the speeches and reports which are made of
their parents after their departure. It follows as from the less to the
greater, that what children do for their parents credit in absence behind
their backs, they must much more do when they are dead: for then there is no
hope, no possibility that parents should do any thing to right their own
wrong in that kind: it lies therefore upon children to do it.

Do not they clean contrary, who take occasion from the departure of their
parents, both to open their ears to receive any ill reports of them, and also
to open their mouths to speak ill of them: then blazing abroad all their
infirmities, and stretching their ill reports of their parents beyond the lists
of truth. Ill birds they are that so bewray their own neast. They know that
their parents being dead can have no notice thereof: whereby they show what
little piety to God or parent is in their heart. But there is an everliving,
all-seeing, and all-knowing Father that takes notice of all: who beside other
^engeance will cause such measure to be meated out to them, ^s they mete to
their parents. There is no one thing wherein this proverb, (With what measure
you mete it shall be measured Mat. 7. 2.
^o you again) is more often verified then in childrens ingra^itude Quaecunque
parentibus stipendia intuleris, eadem ipse a filiis expecta. Thal. Miles. apud
Di^g. Laert. l. 1.
to their parents. All ages have given many instances thereof. (The very
heathen observed it.) Which shows Gods great indignation against it.

. 49. Of childrens imitating their parents good example.
If parents have been persons of good carriage in their life time, as
religious toward God, just in their dealings with men, merciful to such as
stood in need of their help, doing much good in their place, and so ended
their days with much credit; it is an especial means to maintain and
continue this their credit, for children to walk in their steps, and to
endeavor to be like them.

Thus is a blessed memory of their parents kept fresh and green (as we
speak) though their bodies be rotten. For when they who knew the parents
behold the like good qualities and actions in their children, they will thereby
be put in mind of the parties deceased, and say, Oh how such parents yet live!
behold a lively, and living Image of them. Thus did Solomon, Asa, Iehosaphat,
Hezekiah, Josiah and such like good Kings which came of the stock and lineage
of David, keep the memory of their father David, fresh, fair, and flourishing
(long after his body was rotten) as is evident by these and such like phrases,
He walked in the ordinances of David his 1 King. 3. 3.
father: he walked in all the ways of David his father: he did 2 King. 22. 2.
that which was right as David his father, etc. There can be no 1 King. 15. 11.
better monument of a parents piety, honesty, and virtue, then a childs
lively representation of the same. Wherefore Nullum monumentum clarius
relinquere potuit, quam effigiem morum suorum, virtutis, constantiae, pietatis
filium. Cic. Philip. 9.
as a motive to stir up children to walk in the good ways of their parents,
God has promised to show mercy to thousands of them that love him and keep
his commandments, that is, such as having religious and righteous parents
walk in their steps.

Contrary are both those that are unlike good parents, and those that are like
evil parents. The former sort do much impeach and dishonor the reputation of
their parents, as Rehoboam, who by his foolish rigorous and unjust carriage,
made the people speak contemptuously of David. 1 King. 12. 16.


The latter sort continue in memory the evil name, and the shame of their
parents, and cause them to stink more and more: as the sons and successors
of Jeroboam, who following his idolatrous course, made it the more remembered,
and caused this blur to remain in his style from age to age, Jeroboam which
made Israel to sin. 1 King. 15. 26.


As they stop the current, and hinder the passage of the blessing of righteous
parents: so these propagate, and open a way for the curse of unrighteous
parents.

. 50. Of the superstitious duty enjoined by Papists to children after their
parents decease.
To the two forenamed duties of burying the corpse, and preserving the credit of
parents, Papists add a third, and Heathen a fourth, whereof neither are
warrantable by Gods word, but directly contrary thereto.

That which Papists add is, that children after their parents Bellar. Tom. 2.
Contr. 3. De Purgator. l. 2. c. 16. etc.
death ought to procure Diriges, Masses, Pardons, Releases, and such like toies
for them, and make continual prayers to free them out of Purgatory, and bring
them to rest in heaven: of the vanity of these prayers, and folly of the other
toies I have In whole armor of God Treat. 3.. 39. 40. in Ephesians. 6. 18.
elsewhere spoken.

The Scripture expressly teaches that after death the soul goes to the place
appointed for it, of endless bliss or woe: so as there is no means of
altering the one, or helping forward the other.

. 51. Of the unlawfulness of childrens seeking to revenge their parents wrongs.
That which Heathen add, is, that children after their parents Seneca in
Agame^. Poetae tradiderunt filios patris vlciscendi causa supplicium de matre
sumpsisse, idque deorum iussis, atque oraculis fecisse. Cic. pro. Sex. Ros.
death revenge such wrongs as have been done to them in their life time. And
they press this so far upon children, as they affright them with their
parents Ghost, saying, that if they neglect to revenge their parents wrongs,
their Ghost will follow them, and not suffer them to live in quiet, but molest
them continually. This conceit arises from the corruption of nature, which is
exceeding prone to revenge: but it is expressly forbidden in Scripture, in these
and such prohibitions, Resist not evil, Romans 12. 17,
Recompense to no man evil for evil. 19.
Avenge not Mat. 5. 39.
our selves etc. Yet some in justification thereof allege 1 King. 2. 5. 8.
Da^ids charge to Solomon of taking vengeance on Ioab and She^^ei, after his
death.

Answ. The charge which David gave, and Salomons execution thereof, was no
matter of private revenge, but only a lawful execution of justice which
children may and ought to do. Just reasons there were to move David to put off
the execution of justice upon the one and the other so long. 2 Samuel 3. 39.
Ioab was too mighty to have execution done on him in David's time: and Shemeis
and 19. 23.
offense was committed in the time of David's humiliation, which made him swear
that he would not himself take Vengeance of him. Besides, Solomon executed
justice on the one and the other, not for the wrongs they did to his father,
but for other crimes which they committed in his time: only their former
offenses were remembered to aggrauate the matter.

Thus farrc of childrens duties. The manner of performing them follows to be
declared.

. 52. Of the manner of performing childrens duties.
That clause which 37.
noted out the limitation of childrens duties, affoordeth also an excellent
direction for the manner of performing them. It is this, in the Lord: that is,
Children must so perform their duty to their parents as they would or should
perform it to the Lord.

More particularly it implies these six points: How children obey their
parents in the Lord.


1. That their duties be performed in conscience, or for conscience sake, which
is all one as for the Lords sake: for the Lord only is Judge of the conscience
and has power over it. Thus 1. By obeying for the Lords sake. Romans 13. 5. 1
Pet. 2. 13. Col. 3. 20.
must subjects perform duty to magistrates: much more children to parents. The
reason which the Apostle rendereth in these words, This is wel-pleasing to the
Lord, shows that children in obeying their parents must labor to approve
themselves to God.

2. Their duties must be in sincerity, which is when children 2 In sincerity.
pretend in show to do no more, then in truth and heart they mean: Whatsoever
ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord, says Col. 3. 23.
the Apostle. Parents use to deal with none more heartily then with their
children: accordingly must children deal with parents.

3. They must be performed cheerfully, with a willing and 3. With
cheerfulness.
ready mind: for the Lord loves cheerfulness. Herein lies a maine
difference betwixt a filial and servile, a child 2 Cor. 9. 7.
like and slauelike obedience. 4 With reuetence.


4. They must be performed reuerendly as to them which bear the Image of God.
Hereof we spoke. 3.
before.

5. They must so be performed, as in performing them no 5. In the fear of God.
sin be committed against God. Hereof also we spoke. 37. and 38.
before.

6. Constancy must be added to all other virtues. For as the 6. With
perseverance.
Lord himself is constant in all his ways and works, so he expects that
children should be in the duties which he requires at their hands. He that
begins well, and holds not on, loses all the glory of his good beginning.

If the examples of all good children commended in Scripture be well weighed,
we shall find their duties, so far forth as they were acceptable to God,
performed after the foresaid manner, in all the branches thereof.

. 53. Of the aberrations of children in the manner of their obedience.
Contrary are these aberrations.

1. When children perform their duties on by-respects: Faults in the manner of
doing duty. 1. By-respects.
for fear of parents wrath, and the punishment following thereon: for hope and
expectation of greater portion and allow^nce: upon instant persuasion of
friends, with the like: these respects simply in themselves are not for the
Lord.

2. When they perform them only outwardly in show, 2. Complementall.
complementally while parents are in presence, or may know thereof. This is not
with respect to God who seareheth the ^eart.

3. When they perform them grudgingly, mutteringly, 3. Rudely.
disdainfully: as if their parents authority were an usurped ^ower and not
given them of God. Is this in the Lord?

4. When they perform them rudely and unmannerly: 4. Grudgingly.
his shows they consider not the glory of Gods Image shi^ing in their parents.

5.. 38.
When they care not how they sin against God, so 5. Only to please man.
^^ey may please their parents.

6. When, as if they repented of what they have well done, 6. Vnsetledly.
^^ey refuse to do any more duty to their parents. They wax ^eary, thinking
that God has laid too heavy a burden upon ^^em. Many show themselves more
dutiful in their young^^ then in their riper years. That which makes
children ^eary in doing duty, is commonly the great and long need of ^^eir
parents, as long sickness, long impotency, long poverty, with the like. It
appears that such children look only on their parents as men, which, as they
imagine, can never recompense their pains and cost: they look not to God who
is able abundantly to recompense all. These therefore perform not their duty
in the Lord.

. 54. Of the equal respect that children are to bear to both parents.
As the distinct duties of children have been set forth, so I think it
requisite to declare distinctly who the parties be to whom those duties are to
be performed. These principally are the natural parents, both Father and
Mother. Secondarily such as are in the place of parents.

The first point then to be noted is, that children bear an equal respect to
both their natural parents, and perform duty to both alike. The law expressly
mentions both, Honor thy Father and thy Mother. Well may we think that
there was some just and urgent cause, that the law which so briefly under as
few words as well could be, compriseth exceeding much matter, should expressly
mention father and mother, when as there is one word, parent, which includes
both. Now what other reason can be rendered then the point in hand?

It is worthy to be noted, how the Apostle contenteth not himself to have
named parents, which implies both, but also annexeth the express words of the
law, which in particular sets down, father and mother. It is expressly set
down of Iaakob that he obeyed his father and his mother. Among other Genesis 28.
7.
penmen of Scripture Solomon expressly mentions both father and mother, even
almost twenty several times in Prou.

Many reasons there be to enforce this point.

1. Both parents are under God a like means of their childrens Reasons.
being. Children come out of the substance of both alike.

2. The care and pains of both for the good of the children is very great: I
know not of whether the greater. The mothers pains and care in bringing forth
the child is indeed the greater, and it may be also the greater in bringing up
the child, especially while it is young, at least if she give it suck her
self: yet afterward the fathers exceeds in providing fit calling,
sufficient means of maintenance, yea and portion or inheritance for it, and
that after he himself is dead. Thus one way or other the child is equally
bound to both: and accordingly Gods law makes no difference betwixt them.

Object. The wife is subject to her husband: therefore a child ought to
prefer his father before his mother.
Answ. Though there be a difference betwixt father and Both parents to be of
like account with children.
mother in relation of one to another, yet in relation to their children they
are both as one, and have a like authority over them. Now children are not to
look to that difference that is betwixt their parents in that mutual relation
that is betwixt husband and wife, but to that authority which both parents have
over their children: and so to carry an equal respect to both.

2. Object. What if the fathers and mothers disposition Direction for a child
when one parent commands one thing, the other another.
be contrary: and the one command what the other forbids.
Answ. The thing commanded or forbidden must be observed: if it be about a
thing simply good or evil, lawful, or unlawful, then the parent which would
have the thing lawful to be done, or unlawful to be for borne (though it be
the mother) must be obeyed: for in this case she is backed with Gods authority.
But if the matter be merely indifferent, then I doubt not but the father must
be obeyed: yet so as the child no way show any contempt to his mother, but
with all reverence and humility make it known to her that it is best both for
her-selfe and himself, that his father be obeyed. But if the fathers contrary
authority be not interposed, or if the father be dead, then is a mother as
simply and absolutely to be obeyed in all things, as a father.

. 55. Of pretenses alleged to obey father rather then mother.
Contrary on the one side is their childish fondness who so wholly respect
their mother, and seek to please her, as they little regard their father,
unless through fear they be forced thereto: and on the other side, their
scornful spirit who only bear respect to their father, and altogether
neglect their mother, if not despise her. For the most part, of the two, the
mother is less regarded. The reasons whereof I take to be these following,
whereunto I will annex particular means to remove the seeming force of those
reasons, as antidotes or remedies unto them.

1. The mother by reason of her sex is commonly the weaker, and subject to more
infirmities.

Answ. Children ought rather to look upon their mothers place and authority,
then their person and infirmity: so these would no whit impair their respect
of the other.

2. The mother is more indulgent and tender to her children: and uses more
familiarity toward them: now familiarity Familiaritas parit contemptum. Teren.
in Andr.
breeds contempt.

Answ. This is the abuse of familiarity: love should breed love: and love must
be ordered according to the condition of the parties loving, and loved. As
children with one eye behold the affection of the mother, so with another they
should behold Gods image in the mother; and then (that which is. 2, 3.
noted as the ground of all childrens duty) a louing-feare would be wrought in
their heart, which would cast out all contempt.

3. The mother has not that power to reward or revenge that a father has.

Answ. 1. This is not to obey in the Lord. No outward respect should move the
child to obey his parents so much as conscience to God-wards. If children duly
considered God, how he has made no difference, but commanded them to obey both
alike, and how he is able abundantly to reward, and severely to revenge, that
reason would be no reason.

4. The mother is subject to the father.

Answ. This was removed. 54.
before.

As a general answer to these and all other such pretenses as can be alleged,
let it be noted that the Lord does not only in express terms charge children
to fear their mother, but also (the more to press this point) sometime
sets the mother in the first place, thus; Ye shall fear every man his
mother, Leu. 19. 3.
and his father: which is not so to be taken as if the mother of the two were
the more excellent (in this respect the father for the most part is first
named) but because it is the truest trial of a childs subjection to be
subject to his mother. He that willingly and conscionably subiecteth himself
to her, who is in relation to her husband the inferior, in sex the weaker, in
condition subject to more infirmities, in her affections less moderate, in
power less able to reward, or to punish, will much rather (no doubt) subject
himself to his father.

. 56. Of the difference of childrens subjection to natural parents, and to
such as only are in the place of parents.
Beside natural parents, there are others by God so set over children, as they
owe in conscience child-like duty unto them. These in general are such as are
in the place of parents, and so perform, or at least ought to perform, the
duty of parents to children.

They are of two sorts.

1. Such as are joined to a natural parent in marriage, commonly called
Step-fathers, and step-mothers, or fathers in law, and mothers in law.

2. Such as have the government and tuition of children committed to them,
commonly called Guardians, Tutors, Governors: yea also foster-fathers, and
foster-mothers.

Quest. Is the same duty in every respect due to those who are in place of
parents, as to natural parents themselves?
Answ. Not so. There is such a prerogative appertaining to natural parents
from whom children have received their being, that many things wherein children
by an absolute necessity De necessitate.
are bound to them, are bound unto the other who are but in place of parents,
only by the law of honesty, of meetnesse and De honestate.
conueniency. Whence it comes to pass that such things as being done by
children rebelliously without, or against the consent of natural parents prove
mere nullities, will stand in force though they be done without or against the
consent of such as are only in the place of parents: instance contracts made
about goods, lands and such other things as parents retain a right in:
whereunto many good Divines add See. 16.
contracts of marriage, of calling and the like.

Yet notwithstanding seeing in conscience we are bound to those things which
the law of honesty, and conueniency requirety (for whatsoever things are
honest, just, and of good report, Phil. 4. 8.
are to be done) great is that duty which children owe to those who are in
place of parents.

. 57. Of childrens subjection to fathers and mothers in law.
Fathers and mothers in law are to be ranked in the first degree of those who
are in the place of natural parents. Very good proof there is in Scripture
for childrens subjection to them. The respect which Moses bear to his father
in law, Exo. 18. 7. Ruth. 1. and 2. Luke 2. 51.
and Ruth to her mother in law, and Christ himself to his supposed father, are
commended for this very purpose. Subjection is noted in Christ's example:
Reverence in Moses: Recompense in Ruths.

The marriage bond makes man and wife one flesh: whereupon 1. Reason.
the natural parent that marieth another, makes that other one with him, and
in that respect is as a parent to the children, and by them ought to be
accounted so.

The law of God makes it plain in^^st for a son to uncover Leu. 18. 8, 17.
the shame of his mother in law, or for a father in law to uncover the shame of
his daughter in law. Whereby it appears that fathers and mothers in law, are
by Gods law in the very place and steed of natural parents to their children,
and accordingly as natural parents are to be honored.

Besides it is a great honor which a child does to his natural 2. Reason.
father or mother to respect such as they have made one flesh with themselves,
as they do their own parent. So as to honor a father, or mother in law, is
to honor a natural parent.

Contrary is the mind and carriage of most children. Very few bear a reverend,
dutiful, and child-like respect to stepfathers, and step-mothers: but for the
most part despise them in heart, grumble at them in speech, and are very
undutiful in their behavior: whence it comes to pass that they bring much
grief to their natural parent, and often cause much discord and dissension
betwixt their natural, and step-parent^ being herein set on work by Satan,
who labors what he can to disunite those whom God has nearly united
together and made one flesh. Lamentable experience shows that the second,
third, or any after-mariages are seldom so comfortable and peaceable as the
first: especially if either the one, or other, or both have children. The cause
thereof, for the most part, is in children, who brook not fathers or mothers
in law.

Object. Nature cannot so well brook a step-parent, as a natural parent.
Answ. 1. If not so well, yet despise them not: there is a difference betwixt
extremes.

2. Conscience and religion ought to alter corrupt nature. Look to Gods
ordinance: and let Gods fear possess thine heart, that that may bring thee to
do what nature cannot.

2. Object. Fathers and Mothers in law seldom respect their husbands or wives
former children.
Answ. This objection more beseems the mouth of a barbarian then a Christian.
The Gospel teaches to be subject not 1 Pet. 2. 18. Romans 12. 21.
only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward: and not to be overcome
of evil, but to overcome evil with goodness.

The Scripture reckons such as rise up against their parents Mic. 7. 6.
in law, among such as rise up against their natural parents: showing thereby
that the impiety of those, is as blameworthy, as the impiety of these.

. 58. Of childrens subjection to Guardians, Tutors, etc.
For childrens subjection to Governors, Guardians, and Tutors, the Apostle
says that a child is under them. If by the law Galat. 4. 2.
children are under them, they ought in equity to be subject to them. It is
expressly noted of Esther, even after the King had chosen her for his wife, that
she did the commandment of Mordecai Esth. 2. 20.
(who was as a Guardian to her) like as when she was brought up with him. A
memorable pattern for this purpose. What pretenses might she have made to have
cast off all manner of subjection? Mordecai was but her cosen: she was now
advanced above him: a wife she was, and so subject to her husband: yea a Kings
wife, and so her self a Queen: yet she was subject, and her subjection
commended. We read that the children of the Prophets much 2 Kin. 2. 15, etc.
and 6. 1.
respected Elisha, did reverence to him, and were obedient to him, because he
was as a father and tutor unto them: in which respect also Elisha was as a
child subject to Eliah, whom he called 2 King. 2. 12.
father.

Guardians, Tutors, and such like ouer-seers of children, have a parents charge
laid upon them, as we shall Treat 6.. 74, etc.
after show: great reason therefore that child-like duty should be yielded to
them. Their honor must be answerable to their charge and care.

Contrary is the conceit of many lawless children, whose parents being dead,
or they being sent and placed abroad out of the government of their parents,
think they are clean free from all government, and may live as they list.
Their practice being correspondent to this opinion, they run into all riot,
and in time bring themselves to utter ruin. It is the overthrow of many
children, that they regard not their Guardians, Tutors, and Governors: and God
in judgment brings many such refractarie children to some fearful and
shameful end or other. Let children therefore be wise, and not take too much
liberty to themselves.

Thus far have been handled the duties of children in their several kinds,
the manner of performing them, and the parties to whom they are to be
performed. It remains to speak of the reasons which the Apostle alleges to
enforce those duties.

. 59. Of the place of parents, whereby children ought to be moved to obey them.
The reasons which the Apostle uses to move children to perform their duty
are four: The first is taken from the place of the parent. The second from the
equity of the thing. The third from Gods express charge. The fourth from Gods
promise.


I. The place of a parent is noted forth by this phrase, IN THE LORD: which as
it affords a ^. 37.
limitation, and gives a. 52.
direction to children, so it adds a spur unto them, to stir them up to
perform their duty: for it shows that parents are to then children in the
Lords steed: as an evidence thereof has God Liberis suis pater Dei vice est.
Greg. Naz. ad Vitit.
communicated to them this glorious and honorable title (FATHER) which is See.
5.
proper and peculiar to himself. Now then parents being to their children in
Gods steed, and by virtue of their place bearing Gods image, children in
obeying their parents, obey God; in refusing to obey them, refuse to obey God.
A strong motive is this first motive. For who is so void of religion, but will
think it most meet, that God should be honored? or who so impious, as to
refuse to yield duty to God? Here then children may learn in one maine point
how to honor the Lord, and show themselves children of God. And let them here
by know, that disobedient and undutiful children, that resist the authority
of parents, resist the ordinance of God, and receive to themselves Romans 13. 2.
damnation.

. 60. Of the equity whereby children should be moved to obey their parents.
II. The second reason in these words, for this is right, though it be not of
greater force, yet is it more plainly and expressly noted to be a reason, as the
causall particle (for) prefixed before it, shows. It is a general reason
drawn from common equity; a reason which may move all sorts, even Infidels
and Pagans: therefore much more Christians.

In saying, It is right, he implies three things.

1. That it is agreeable to all law. To the law of God, which Right implies
three things. 1. It is agreeable to all law.
is the fountain of equity. To the law of Nature, which proceeds from thence.
And to the law of Nations, which is answerable in many respects. The forenamed
proofs out of Gods word, show it to be agreeable to Gods law. The precepts
which heathen men have given of this point, show it to be agreeable to the law
of nature. And the many Constitutions of Lawmakers, in all ages, show it to be
agreeable to the law of nations.

2. That the place of parents requires as much. For RIGHT 2. It is due by
virtue of parents place.
requires that every one have his own, that which is his due. It being
therefore right, that children obey their parents, that duty ^s due to them.

3. That parents deserve as much: for right presupposes de^ert. 3. It is a
debt.
That which is done of right, is done by way of recompense. The cause of this
desert, is the love which parents bear to children, the pain, pains, care,
and cost they have been at, in bringing them forth, and bringing them up.

These things being implied under right, note what follows from the force of
this reason,

1. Disobedient and undutiful children, transgress against Gods law, against
common equity of all nations, and against light ^f nature: so as they are
unworthy of the name of Christians, ^hey are worse then Infidels, yea worse
then the brute beasts.

2. They have no respect to the place of their parents, they disgrace the image
of God, which their parents by virtue of their place carry, and they disturb
that comely order and degree, which God has set among men.

3. They ill repay their parents care and pains for their good, and show
themselves both ungrateful and unnatural: which are two most monstrous and
odious sins.

. 61. Of Gods accepting childrens obedience.
The forenamed reason is by this same Apostle in another place thus set down,
This is well-pleasing to the Lord. By comparing Coloss. 3. 20.
that place with my text, I observe, that

What is right is well-pleasing to the Lord. And again, What is well-pleasing
to the Lord is right.

These two propositions, are (as we speak in Schools) conuertible and
reciprocal; either of them true of the other every way. Wherefore the Apostle,
in another place, joins them both together. For having exhorted children to
recompense their parents, he says, That is good and acceptable before God.
(...).
Good or 1 Timothy 5. 4.
honest is in effect the same that (...).
right.

This shows, that dutiful children, as they do that which is good, or
honest, and right unto their parents; so also therein they highly please God:
so as they may be sure not to lose thereby. At Gods hand they shall receive a
reward, though their parents should little regard their dutifulness. Thus God
dealt with Iaakob. His father in law ill repaid his faithfulness: but God
looked Genesis 31. 7, etc. verse 42.
upon him, and abundantly recompensed all his pains.

This shows again, that undutiful children, as they do not that which is
right, but rather wrong unto their parents; so they highly displease God: they
may be sure therefore not to escape unpunished, though their parents, through
overmuch indulgencie, should let them alone: instance the two impious children
of Elie, Hophni and Phinehas: and the two rebellious children of 1 Samuel 2. 34.
2 Samuel 18. 9. 1 King. 2. 25.
David, Absalom, and Adoniah.

This therefore adds force to the second reason, and moves children to do
right to their parents, by obeying them, as they respect God, his good
pleasure, or displeasure: as they look for recompense, or fear vengeance from
him.

. 62. Of Gods charge, how inviolable a bond it is to tie children to obey their
parents.
III. The third drawn from Gods charge is not only in express terms noted,
but for more weight the very words of the moral law are quoted (Honor thy
father and thy mother:) and it is added, that this is a commandment, yea the
first commandment, and that with promise, all which is for amplification of
the point.

Here then consider we 1. The reason it self. 2. The amplification thereof.

From the reason that it is Gods charge, I gather these three points.

1. That it is no arbitrary matter left to childrens discretion Childrens
obedience to parents is, 1. No arbitrary thing.
whether they will obey their parents or no: but a matter whereunto in
conscience they are bound, even as they owe allegiance to God himself the
great lawgiver: so as in neglecting duty to parents, children sin even
against God himself: for the same God who has commanded us to honor
himself, has commanded us to honor father and mother.

2. That this is a perpetual and a general law: a law whereunto 2. An
eternal law, and general to all children.
all children of all times, places, sexes, estates and degrees always have
been, still are, and ever shall be bound. For the moral law is of that
extent: it is general for all persons: perpetual for all times. Therefore no
children may think to be exempted from it.

Quest. What if children be grown to years, and not under their parents
government?
Answ. There may be some difference both in some parts of subjection, and also
in the manner of subjection betwixt such children as remain under their
parents government, and such as are freed from it: but yet so long as a child
has a parent, of what age or estate so ever he be, he owes an honor unto his
parent. Genesis 47. 12. and 48. 12. and 50. 5.
Joseph when he was a great Governor of Egypt, a man grown, having wife and
children, yet performed the honor of reverence, obedience, and recompense unto
his father. 1 King. 2. 19. 3. Indispensable.
Solomon when he was in an higher place then Joseph, even an absolute King, did
the honor of Reverence to his mother.

3. That no man can give children any dispensation, or ex emption from their
duty to parents. If any may, he must be either the lawmakers himself, or one
greater then he, one that has power over him. Now God is the author and giver
of that law, God spoke all these words, etc. But is any greater then Exo. 20. 1.
God? has any power over him? Who then can dispense with children in this
kind?

Hence then I infer these two conclusions.

1. That the Popes dispensation is nothing worth: they who make it to be of
force, must make him greater then God, which is a horrible blasphemy.

2. Though parents themselves should not exact duty of their children, yet
children were bound to perform duty to them, because of Gods charge. To this
therefore are children to look. This shows that there is no less pain
hanging over the heads of the transgressors of this charge, then the curse of
the law, eternal condemnation.

. 63. Of the title FIRST given to the fifth commandment.
In the amplification of the forenamed reason, the Apostle styles the
commandment of honoring parents the first with promise, as to show that it is
the first which has a particular promise annexed to it; so it is the first
that God gave of any duty to be performed unto man. The very order of the
decalogue manifests the truth hereof. The reason is clear: Honor due to
parents is the ground of all the duties required in the second table: for if
duty be not performed to such as we are bound unto by some peculiar bond, may
we think that it will be performed to such as we are bound unto at large? Now
of all to whom we are first and most bound, and to whom we owe our first duty,
our parents are the persons. They therefore who are rebellious against their
parents, and refuse to do their duty to them, will hardly perform duty to
any other. Little hope that a disobedient child will prove a profitable member
in Church or commonwealth. Absalom, who was a rebellious child, proved but a
traitorous subject: and Hoph^^ and Phineas that refused to hearken to the voice
of their father, proved but sacrilegious Priests. Wherefore if any precept of
the second table be conscionably to be observed (as all are, for the same
lawmakers gave all, and Christ has said that the second table is like the
first) then is this of honoring father Mat. 22. 39.
and mother, among the rest, and above the rest to be observed, at least if
difference of observing any may be made,

But this particle (first) being set down, not simply but with a connection of
promise with it (The first with promise) we are duly to consider the promise
thereof: whence a fourth reason arises.

. 64. Of Gods promise moving children to obey their parents.
The fourth reason taken from Gods promise, is both generally propounded and
particularly exemplified. Propounded in this clause (first with promise.)
Exemplified in the third verse.

For the General. Gods promise made to the performance of any duty, cannot but
be a strong motive to stir us up to perform it. Men hereby do stir up,
and provoke one another Promise of reward a great motive.
to perform any thing. Thus Kings when they would feign have their subjects
do this or that, promise such and such rewards unto them: Thus masters incite
their servants, parents their children, and one man another. If the promises of
men encourage us to perform the things which they give us in charge, how much
more ought the promise of God? Men How Gods promise is a stronger motive then
any man's.
^re deceitful, and may deal doubly, pretending one thing with their mouths,
and intending another with their heart, and never mean to perform what they
promise: But God is faithful and true: his words are as deeds: his promises as
performances; so as he never makes show of more then he means ^o perform.
Again, man's power is limited; though he truly ^^tend what he promises, yet in
the performance he may fail ^ither in that he knew not his own power, but
thought when ^e made the promise he could have done more then in the e^ent he
finds he can do; or in that he is after wards by some occasion hindered, or
disabled. But Gods power cannot be so ^aitned, or hindered. Besides, men may be
taken away before ^etime of performing their promise is come: but God ever
^^eth, and changes not. If then man's promises be any moves to any thing, much
more Gods who ever remains the ^me. Betwixt God and man there is no
proportion, no com^rison. How Gods promise commends Gods love.


This motive does exceedingly commend Gods fatherly indulgencie toward us, and
the earnest desire he has of our good. For he has such power and authority
over all his creatures, that the very knowledge of his will ought to provoke
them to perform any duty which he shall command: and if they obey not, he
might presently execute vengeance upon them. But considering that we are his
children, and need many allurements to draw us on by little and little, he
accordingly deals with us. He stands not wholly and only upon his
authority, but adds promises thereto: (for this is a commandment with
promise.) If notwithstanding all this, children refuse to obey their parents,
may not the Lord justly expostulate the matter with them, as sometimes in
another case he did with the Israelites, and say, Judge between me and these
children: Isa. 5. 3, 4.
what could I have done more that I have not done? I gave them an express
charge to honor their parents: I laid it down in the first place as a maine
and principal charge: to encourage them to keep it, I added a promise of good
to redound to themselves: what could I do more? Do not they justly deserve
vengeance that regard none of these? Thus, in that this is a commandment with
promise, we see how children disobedient to their parents are both rebellious
against God in regard of the commandment which they transgress, and injurious
to themselves in regard of the promise which they make to be void and of no
effect. Of this particular promise see more in the first treatise,. 97, 98, etc.

The sixth Treatise. The Duties of Parents.
. 1. Of the heads of Parents duties.
EPHESIANS. 6. 4. And ye Fathers provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them
up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
NExt to childrens, follow Parents duties, which the Apostle lays down in
this fourth verse: where he notes, 1. The duties 2. The parties 1. That are to
perform the duties, Fathers. 2. To whom they are to be performed, Children.



The duties are set down, 1. By prohibition. 2. By precept.

The prohibition notes out one extreme, which is overmuch rigor, (Provoke not
to wrath)

The inference of the precept upon the prohibition notes out another extreme,
which is ouer-much-remisnesse.

The precept it self enioyneth to parents three duties. 1. To nourish
children, namely with food, apparel, and other like necessaries (Nourish
them.) 2. To nurture them, namely with good discipline (In nurture.)


3. To instruct them, namely in the ways of God (And admonition of the Lord.)

Nature teaches Unreasonable Creatures to do the First Ciuility Reasonable
Men Second Piety Christians Third.

To these heads may all the several points which I shall deliver concerning
parents duties, be referred.

That Parents may the better discern how one duty follows another, I will
proceed in this order.

1. The fountain of all duties, shall be declared. 2. The streams that issue
thence,

The streams shall be divided into two rivers.

In the first are those general duties that are continually to be done.

In the second, such particular duties as are to be applied to the several
ages of children.

There are two principal general duties. 1. Faithful prayer to God. 2.
Upright walking with God.


All the particulars may be comprised under this one head, A provident care.
And this has respect, 1. To the Infancy of children, 2. To their Youth, 3. To
the time of their placing forth, 4. To the time of parents departing out of
this world.


. 2. Of that Love which parents owe to their children.
The Fountain of parents duties is Love. Tit. 2. 4.
This is expressly enjoined to them. Many approved examples are recorded hereof:
as Genesis 22. 2.
Abraham's, and 25. 28.
Isaacks, Ibid.
Rebekahs, and others.

Great reason there is why this affection should be fast fixed in the heart of
parents toward their children. For great is that pain, pains, cost, and
care, which parents must undergo for their children. But if love be in them,
no pain, pains, cost, or care, will seem too much. Herein appears the wise
providence of God, who by nature has so fast fixed love in the hearts of
parents, as if there be any in whom it abounds not, he is counted unnatural.
If love did not abound in parents, many children would be neglected and lost.
For if parents look not to their children, who will? If none look to them,
they must needs perish: for they are not able to help themselves. As God by
nature has planted love in all parents, so Christians ought even for
conscience sake, to nourish, increase, and blow up this fire of love, that they
may thereby be made more forward to do every duty with cheerfulness. The
more fervent love is, the more readily will every duty be performed. As I have
heretofore laid down Love a fountain of wives, husbands, and childrens
duties; so must I continue my course, and set it forth as the fountain of
parents duties. For the Scripture has noted it as a duty belonging to all and
every of them: and therefore I might not omit it in any of them. Yet let not
any thereupon think, that the same point is often handled, and repeated again
and again. For according to the several parties, and the several relation
they have to others, there are several fruits of love: even as the same
moisture of the earth causes several and diverse fruits, according to the
several kinds of plants that receive that moisture. Compare the several
places, where this general duty of love has been handled, and you will find
the manner of handling to be different, and to afford new matter.


Object. As too much fire is dangerous, so too much love.
Answ. True. Wherefore as in other things, so in this, the golden mean must be
kept. No duty so holy and necessary, ^ut may be perverted. Let the extremes
be avoided, and the mean will better be kept.

. 3. Of the contraries to love.
The extreme contrary to love in the defect is want of natural Want of
natural affection in parents.
affection, which is reckoned in the Romans 1. 30. Tit. 3. 3.
catalogue of notorious ^^nnes. Though love of children be by nature engraven
in man's heart, yet many clean put it out through covetousness, ^^st,
vainglory, superstition, idolatry, and other vices: whereby it comes to
pass that in stead of the good which they ^ould do for their children, they
bring much mischief upon them. Some spare not the precious life of their
children. Among these, barbarous idolaters do most exceed in this kind of
unnatural cruelty, sacrificing their children, and offering them up to devils.
To this the great bloud-sucker Satan of old brought not only the heathen, who
being ignorant of God did service to the devil, but also the 2 King. 16. 3.
and 21. 6. Ezekiel. 16. 20.
Israelites to whom Jehovah the true God made himself known, and expressly
Leu. 18. 21.
forbid this cruelty, and that and 20. 2.
under pain of death. Behold how superstition and idolatry blind the eyes of
men. Purc. Pilgr. in Americ. cap. 7. and cap. 11.
They who have been among the Sauadges in Virginea, Florida, India, and other
like places testify that such cruelty is used to this day. And it is rendered
as a maine reason why, notwithstanding such spacious places as they have, they
increase no more in multitude, because many of their children from time to time
are offered up in sacrifice.

Reasonable men herein show themselves more unreasonable then unreasonable
beasts, which do what possibly they can to preserve their young ones.

Though not so high, yet too high on this ladder of unnaturalness Haters of
children for piety.
do they climb, who hate their children, and that (which makes the sin to be
out of measure sinful) for piety and integrity; as many Popish and profane
parents, who have children truly religious: and in that respect ought so much
the more to be loved.

The extreme in the excess is too much doting upon children: Doting on
children.
as they do who so vnmeasurably love them, as they make reckoning of nothing
in comparison of children. Even God himself is lightly esteemed, his worship
neglected, his word transgressed, all duty to others omitted, their own
souls forgotten through care of children. Is not this mee^^ apish kindness?
for Apes kill their young ones with hugging. This is no love, but plain
dotage. But what may be said of those that are so hellishly enamoured with
their children as to commit incest or buggery with them?

. 4. Of Parents praying for their children.
The first and best stream which issues out of the forenamed fountain of
love is faithful and fervent prayer. This extends it self to all things, at
all times, thorowout the whole course of the childs life. It is the first and
it is the last duty which parents ought to perform to their children: 1 These
5. 17. (...).
even that which they must do without intermission; Pray without ceasing.

Though prayer be a general duty which all Christians owe Prayer a peculiar
duty of parents.
one to another, yet after a peculiar manner does it appertain to parents: and
of all others they are most bound to it. For the promise which God makes to a
parent is extended to his seed and children, as these and such like Scriptures
show, Genesis 17. 7.
I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed: Deuteronomy. 5. 29.
That it may be well with them and with their children: Act. 2. 39.
The promise is unto you, and unto your children. Parents therefore with most
assurance of faith may call upon God for their children. For Gods promise is
the ground of faith: so far as Gods promise is extended, so far our faith
may and ought to extend it self. Hence has arisen the commendable custom of
childrens asking Treat 5.. 9.
their parents blessing: which intimates a desire that parents would pray for
Gods blessing on them.

This duty of prayer must be performed before parents have children (that they
may have some, as Genesis 25. 21.
Isaak, 1 Samuel 1. 10. Paulam ante votis quam vtero concepisti. Hier. ad 1 aet.
Annah and others did Genesis 25. 21.
) and so soon as children are conceived, especially if they observe them to be
quick in the womb (as Genesis 25. 22.
Rebekah did) and again when they are borne (as Luke 1. 64.
Zachariah did) and thorowout the whole course of their life (as Job. 1. 5.
Job did) and when they are going out of this world, and leaving their children
(as Genesis 27. 4.
Isaak did.)

There is no one thing wherein and whereby parents may do more good for their
children, then in and by true prayer. God has sanctified prayer as a means to
receive all needful blessing from himself the fountain of all blessing. If
therefore Gods blessing be of use to children (what Atheists are they that
believe it not?) then also is prayer by which it is obtained.

. 5. Of vices contrary to parents praying for their children.
The very neglect of this duty is a sin contrary to the duty Parents
neglect of prayer.
it self: and many parents there be that stand guilty of this sin. Some
think it needless to pray for a child before it be borne, not considering
that in sin it is conceived. When it is borne they refer this duty to the
midwife, whereas it properly appertains to the father. After it is grown to
any ripeness, they put it off to the child to pray for it self. And when
they are on their deathbed, they think it enough if they can pray for their
own souls. Such parents show little true love to their children: but less
faith in God.

But what may we say or think of such impious parents as Parents imprecations
against children.
fear not to make fearful imprecations against their children? God often in
wrath and vengeance hears such imprecations to the woe of parent and child:
whereby he shows his great indignation against them for the same.

. 6. Of parents endeavoring to be righteous that they may leave Gods blessing
to their children.
Another general branch proceeding from parents love to their children, is,
that for their childrens sake they endeavor to walk uprightly before God, and
to please him. This I do the rather note, because I find the reward promised
to righteous parents to be extended unto their children Psalm. 1. 12. 2.
The generation of the righteous shall be blessed, says David. And Solomon,
Pro. 20. 7.
Blessed shall his children be after him: and again, and 13. 22.
The good man shall give inheritance unto his childrens children. Deuteronomy. 5. 29.
This motive is therefore urged by the holy Ghost to provoke parents unto all
righteousness.

Thus does the Lord extend the reward of righteous parents unto their children
to show his great good liking, and high approbation of righteousness. Read
for this purpose, 1 King. 11. 34. and 2 King. 10. 30.

1. Object. Ezec. 18. 20.
The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself.

Answ. That is meant rather of a man's personal righteousness, and grace it
self which is not communicated to children, then of the fruit thereof: That
faith in Christ, fear of God, obedience to Gods word, or any other personal
grace which is in righteous parents, shall not justify or save their children.
For the just shall live by his own faith. Yet this hinders Hab. 2. 4.
not but that the benefit and blessing of righteous parents may fall upon their
children according to the extent of Gods promise.

2. Object. By experience we find it verified, that the children of some
righteous parents are cursed: and the Scripture gives us many examples
thereof: as Genesis 4. 11.
Cain, and 9. 25.
Cham, 2 Samuel 18. 15.
Absalom, and others like them.

1. Answ. Such children by their unworthy, and degenerat carriage make
forfeiture of Gods covenant and 1 Samuel 2. 30.
so deprive themselves of the benefit thereof.

2. Answ. Many good reasons may be given why God should sometimes alter his
course, and withold his blessings from the children of his servants. As

1. Lest Gods gifts and blessings should otherwise seem to come rather by
natural propagation from the parent, then by free donation from God.

2. Lest parents should thereby be drawn to neglect the means of good
education.

3. Lest children also themselves, trusting too much to their parents
righteousness, should take too much liberty, and wax licentious.

4. Lest Gods free election should seem hereby to be restrained.

3. Object.
If this be so, what motive can it be unto parents to labor after
righteousness for their childrens sake?

Answ. Though God do reserve in himself a freedom to order his blessings as
it pleases him, and to bestow them upon whom he will: and thereupon sometimes
blesses the child of a wicked parent (instance 2 Chr. 28. 27.
Hezekiah) and denies his blessing to the child of a righteous parent
(instance 2 Samuel 13. 14, 29. Relinque bonam filijs memoriam magis quam diuitias
multas. Bas sermon. in Scrip. loc.
Ammon) yet in that it is a very usual course with him to extend his blessing
(according to his promise) to the children of the righteous, it is a strong
motive to such as desire the good of their children, the rather for their
childrens sake to endeavor after righteousness: for thus do they use the
means which by Gods word is warranted and sanctified for procuring Gods
blessing to their children. Leave therefore a good memory to thy children
rather then much wealth.

. 7. Of the preposterous course which covetous and unjust parents take for the
good of their children.
Contrary is the course of such parents as by unrighteous means think to
provide well for their children. For many do not only too carkingly, and
distrustfully moile and toil to scrape together great masses of money, or
great store of land, or other stocks for their children, neglecting duties of
piety and mercy, but also by unjust and wrongful courses defraud others to
make their children rich. So common is this undue course of providing for
children, as thence has arisen this proverb, Happy are those children whose
parents go to the devil. A cursed proverb. For what other thing can it
intend, but this, that they who fear not God, nor take care for their own
saulation, will have most respect to the outward estate of their children, and
be most careful to make them great, and rich in this world? Wherein note how
many ways they bewray their notorious folly.

1. They prefer the outward estate of their children before the eternal
salvation of their own souls. Yea and before God himself.

2. They place the happiness of their children in the goods of this world;
Pro. 23. 5.
then which nothing more vain.

3. They make themselves drudges to their children, and so debase themselves
below that dignity which by reason of Gods image on them, appertains to them.

4. They with much pains, care, grief, and fear are long gathering that
which their children in short time most riotously and prodigally will lavish
out.

5. They make themselves vassals to Satan and seek by him to be made rich:
whereas indeed Tro. 10. 22.
it is the blessing of God that makes rich. Thus they take a wrong course to
get wealth. If it be said that many are thus made rich, I answer, that as Hos.
13. 11. Ne liberos praetexas. Qui enim filium fecit, and te fecit: qui etiam
tibi occasiones nutriend praebet, and filio praebebit vitae subsidia. Basil.
loc. ^it.
God gave a King to Israel, so he gives wealth to them, in wrath: and in
wrath will he take it away.

6. They bring Gods curse into their house, and leave it unto their children:
So as these are the riches that are reserved to the owners thereof for their
evil. Let not therefore care for children draw thee to any coueteous or unjust
courses: but know that he who made thy son made thee also, and he who
affoorded thee means of nourishment, will also afford thy children sufficient
succor.

. 8. Of Parents providence for their children. How far parents providence
extends it self.

The head, whereunto all the particular duties, which parents owe to their
children, may be referred, is A provident care for their childrens good. This
extends it self to all times, and to all things.

To all times, as to the infancy, youth, and man-age of their children: and
that not only while parents live, but after their departure.

To all things, namely, tending both to the temporal good of their children,
and also to their spiritual good.

Children are of the very substance of their parents, and therefore ought
parents so far to seek their childrens good as their own.

The patterns of holy parents recorded and commended in Scripture, do lively
set forth this provident care.

But this general we will exemplify in the particulars: and in order declare
how parents must provide both for the temporal, and also for the spiritual
good of their children in every degree of their age.

They who at any time in any thing are negligent and careless of their
childrens good, offend in the contrary to this general duty. The heinousness
of which offenses will appear in the particulars.

. 9. Of a mothers care over her child while it is in her womb.
The first age of a child is the infancy thereof. I will therefore first show
how therein parents must procure the temporal good of their children, and then
their spiritual good.

The first part of a child's infancy is while it remains in the mothers
womb. Here therefore the duty lies principally upon the mother: who so soon
as she perceives a child to be conceived in her womb, ought to have an
especial care thereof, that (so much as in her lies) the child may be safely
brought forth. ( Grauidae corpora curare debent. Men's item earum quietem
desiderat. Quae enim procreantur a matre in cuius aluo continentur, alimentum
capiunt, vt a terra ea-quae gignantur ex ea. Arist. Pol. lib. 7.
The heathen Philosophen, by light of nature, observed this to be a duty; and
prescribed it to mothers.) A mother then must have a tender care over her self
when she is with child: for the child being lodged in her, and receiving
nourishment from her (as plants from the earth) her well-being tends much to
the good and safety of the child: but the hurt that comes to her, makes
the child the worse, if it be not a means to destroy it. Why was the charge
of Judge. 13. 4.
abstaining from wine, strong drink, and unclean things, given to Manoahs
wife, but because of the child which she conceived?

In this case there is a double bond to make mothers careful of themselves. 1.
Their own, 2. Their child's good.


Husbands also in this case must be very tender over their wives, and helpful
to them in all things needful, both in regard of that duty which they owe to
their wives, and also of that they Judge. 13. 11, etc.
owe to their children. Why was Manoah so desirous to hear himself the
forenamed direction which the Angel gave to his wife? and why did the Angel
again repeat it to him, but to show it belonged to him to see her observe it?

They who through violence of passion, whether of grief, or Contrary.
anger, or through violent motion of the body, as by dancing, striving, 1. To
miscarry through negligence.
running, galloping on horseback, or the like: or through distemper of the
body, by eating things hurtful, by eating too much, by too much abstinence,
by too much bashfulnesse in concealing their desires and longings (as we
speak) cause any abortion or miscariage, fall into the offense contrary to the
forenamed duty. If women were persuaded that in conscience they are bound to
the forenamed duty, they would, I think, be more careful of themselves. For
if through their default, they themselves or their child miscarry, they make
themselves guilty of that miscariage: if both miscarry, they make themselves
guilty of the blood of both; at least in the court of conscience before God.

But they who purposely take things to make away their children 2. To make away
a child in the womb. Omne quod formatam animam a Deo accepit vindie abitur si
iniusle interimatur. Constit. Apost. l. 7. c. 4.
in their womb, are in far higher degree guilty of blood: yea even of
wilful murder. For that which has received a soul formed in it by God, if
it be unjustly cast away, shall be revenged.

So far forth as husbands are careless of their wives being with child,
denying them things needful, they are accessarie to the hurt, which the woman,
or child takes, guilty of the sin, and liable to the judgment.

. 10. Of providing things needful for the child, so soon as it is borne: and
of cruelty contrary thereunto.
The next degree of a child's infancy, is while it is in the swaddling bands,
and remains a sucking child. In this also the care especially lies upon the
mother: yet so as the father must afford what help he can.

The first duty here required is, that sufficient provision of all things
needful for a child in that weakness be before hand provided. What the
particulars be, women better know, then I can express. For me, it is
sufficient, to lay down the duty in general: which is commended unto us in
that worthy pattern of the Virgin Marie, who though she were very poor, and
forced to travel far, and brought to bed in a strange place, where she was
so little respected, as she was not afforded a place meet for a woman in her
case, but was feign to content her self with a stable in a common Inn, yet
she provided for her child. For it is said, She wrapped him in swaddling
clothes, Luk 2. 7.

Contrary is the practice of such lewd and unnatural women, as leave their
newborn children under stalls, at men's doors, in Church porches, yea many
times in open field. It is noted as a point of unnaturalness in the Ostrich,
to leave her eggs in the earth, and in the dust: in which respect she is said
to be hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers, Job 39. 14,
16. Much more hardened are the foresaid lewd women. The Eagle is Iniquiffima
volucris Aquila dicitur, quiae taedio nutriendi pullum quem genuit, ipsa fugat.
Tales parents ij sunt, qui liberos suos infantes exponunt. Basil. Hexam. hom.
8. Necare videtur qui partum abijcit, and qui publicis locis misericordiae
causa, quam ipse non habet, exponit. Digest. l, 25. tit. 3.. 4. 1 Pet. 2. 2.
counted an unnatural bird, because she thrusts her young ones, which she
has brought forth, out of her nest. Are not then such mothers much more
unnatural? They often lay their children forth in public places, for others to
show that mercy, which they themselves have not. The Civil Law judges this to
be a kind of further.

. 11. Of giving suck to children.
Among other needful things, the milk of the breast is fit for ^oung babes,
and with it they are to be nourished. I think none ^oubt of the equity of
this. It has in all ages, and in all coun^ies, been accounted the bestfood
that can be for young babes. The metaphor, which S. Peter uses, taken from
young infants in these words, As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
the lord) confirms as much. So does also the desire which such ^nfants have
to the milk of the breasts: and the ability, and ^omptnesse which is in them
to suck: and Gods providence in ^using a woman's breasts to yield forth such
milk: and the constant manner of nourishing little infants after this manner,
commended in the Scriptures: and (to conclude) the natural instinct which many
unreasonable creatures have thus to nourish their young ones.

They who on mere curiosity (where no urgent necessity requires) try
whether their children may not as birds be nourished without suck, offend
contrary to this duty; and reject that means which God has ordained as the
best: and so oppose their shallow wit to his unsearchable wisdom.

. 12. Of mothers giving suck to their own children.
Of nourishing children with brest-milke, there is no great question: therefore
I have with a touch passed it over. The chiefest question of doubt is
concerning the party who is bound to this duty; namely, whether the mother be
bound to do it her self or no.

Many strong arguments there be to press it upon the consciences Postquam
ablactaueris came, etc. dixit Hier. ad Laetam de filia sua.
of mothers, and to show that (so far as they are able) they are bound to
give suck to their own children. Some are taken from the light of Gods word;
and some from the light of nature.

Gods word does in many places by just consequence imply, that it is a bounden
duty: in other places it does expressly commend it by the practice of holy
women: and again in other places it takes it for a granted truth, and ruled
case, not to be denied.

1. The consequences whereby the word implies this duty are these:

1. In the blessing given to Joseph thus speaks old Iaakob, God shall bless
thee with the blessing of the breasts, and of the Genesis 49. 25.
womb. By the blessing of the womb, what can be meant, but children? By the
blessing of the breasts, what, but milk, whereby those children are nourished?
As if he had said; I will bless thee with such women, as shall both bear thee
children, and also give suck to them which they bear. The consequence then is
this: As it is a blessing to have children of a true lawful wife; so to have
those children nursed of the same wife their mother.

Object. They have the blessing of breasts that have other women to nurse their
children.
Answ. By the same reason it may be said, they have the blessing of the womb
who have strange women to bear them children. But the joining of these two
branches of blessing together, shows that both must be taken in the same
kind: so that as the blessing of the womb is to have children of a man's wife,
so the blessing of the breasts is to have them nursed of his wife. If it be a
blessing for the woman which bears the child to give it suck, then mothers
are bound to perform this duty.

2. It is denounced as a curse, that women shall have a barren Ose. 9. 14.
womb and dry breasts. If it be a curse for women to have dry breasts, then
may not women wittingly make them dry: which all mothers do, that give not
suck to their children.

3. Manoahs wife being promised to bear a son, had this charge given her,
Drink no wine, nor strong drink. etc. those things were especially hurtful
for her milk. It is therefore implied thereby, that she should so order her
diet, as she might well nurse her child, and have good milk for him.

4. God by his good providence brought it to pass, that the mother of Moses
(though she were forced to cast out her Exo. 2. 7, etc.
child) should nurse her own child. Yea the mother her self was desirous to
do it, and therefore appointed her daughter ^o watch who should take it up.
These two circumstances ^mplie that it appertains to a mother to nurse her
children.

5. The Apostle lays this down as a note of a good woman, 1. Tim. 5. 10.
who in her place has been careful to do her duty, and thereupon fit to
do service in Gods Church (If she have (...).
^ourished her children, or word for word, If she have fed her children.) Now
the proper food for young babes is breast-milk, which, by the Apostles rule,
the mother must give.

6. The same Apostle commands mothers to love their Tit. 2. 4.
children. How can a mother better express her love to her ^oung babe, then by
letting it suck of her own breasts? As his is a testimony of love, so it is a
means of preserving and increasing love: for daily experience shows that
mothers ^ue those children best to whom they themselves give suck.

Sum these several consequences together, and we ^all find the duty in
question to be very strongly enforced hereby. 1. As a blessing it is promised,
that mothers shall give suck to the children that they bear. 2. As a curse it
is threatened, that women shall not be able to give suck. 3. An Angel gave
direction to a mother so to carry her self as she might have store of good
milk for the child which she should bear. 4. God by his special providence
manifested that the proper mother was the best nurse for a child. 5. It is the
note of a good woman to perform this part of her particular calling, namely to
nurse her own child. 6. Women ought to do all the best duties of love that
they can to their children.


Therefore mothers ought to nurse their own children. II. Some of the most
worthy patterns, in whose example this duty is commended to mothers, are
these.

1. Sarah gave suck to Isaak. This example is to be noted Genesis 21. 7.
especially of the greater sort: as rich men's wives, honorable men's wives, and
the like. For Sarah was an honorable woman, a princess, a rich man's wife, a
beautiful woman, aged and well grown in years, and a mistress of a family.

Are not these excuses pretended by many mothers for not nursing children
themselves?

2. The virgin Mary gave suck to Jesus. This example is to be noted especially
of the meaner sort, for the virgin Man was young, poor, persecuted, forced to
remove and fly with her child from country to country. Are not these
excuses pretended by other mothers?

These two patterns do not only commend the duty, but also strippe all
mothers that are negligent therein, of all excuse.

To these may be added the examples of 1 Samuel 1. 22.
Annah, of Psalm. 22. 9.
David's mother, and of many others. What if also I add the example of that
true, natural, affectionate mother who stood before Salomons throne to plead
for her child? she thus says of her self, 1 King. 3. 21.
I arose to give my son suck, etc. If this had not been a good motherly
duty, she would not then and there have pleaded it.

III. The places of Scripture which take this duty for a matter granted, and
for a ruled case, are such as these.

1. Where Sarah says, Who would have said to Abram that Genesis 21. 7.
Sarah should have given children suck? In this phrase she sets forth Gods
blessing in giving Abram a son by her. Now in that she expresses the
blessing under this phrase of giving suck, she takes it for grant, that the
mother which bears children must give them suck.

2. Where David says, thou did make me hope upon my Psalm. 22. 9.
mothers breasts, he does not only imply that his mother gave him suck, but
by the phrase makes it a ruled case that the child which suckes must hang
upon the mothers breast.

3. Where Solomon says, O that thou were as my brother that Cant. 8. 1.
sucked the breasts of my mother, he takes if also for grant, that brothers
and sisters, as they come out of the same womb, so they should suck the same
breasts, even the breasts of her out of whose womb they came, their own
mothers breasts.

4. Where the woman said to Christ, Blessed is the womb that Luke 11. 27.
bare thee, and the paps which thou have sucked, she takes it for grant (as it
was an usual practice in those days) that the ^aps of that woman, whose womb
bear him, gave him Ipsa suggerit natura matribus ipsis lactandos esse suos
foetus. Idoirco enim animanti enixae lactis alimentum omni praebuit* Sapiens
vero etiam prouidentia mammas foeminis binas effinxit, etc. Plut. de Justit.
lib. In ijs animantibus quae lacte aluntur, omnis fere cibus lactescere
incipit. Cic. de Not. D.
^ucke.

These arguments we have from the light of Gods word: other we may have from
Gods works and the light of nature, as

1. God has given to women two breasts fit to contain and hold milk: and
nipples unto them fit to have milk drawn from them. Why are these thus given?
to lay them ^rth for ostentation? There is no warrant for that in all Gods
lord. They are directly given for the child's food that comes out of the
womb; for till the child be borne, there is ^o milk in the breasts: anon
after it is borne, milk ordinari^^ flows into the breasts: yea a great part
of the meat which ^^ey eat turns into milk. They make this admirable work
^f Gods providence to be in vain, that dry up this spring, ^^d suffer not
their children to partake of the benefit of it.

2. That nourishment whereon the child fed in the mo^^ers womb, and whereby
it was there sustained, turns into milk, and comes into the breasts when
the child comes out of the womb. Whence we may gather, that of all women's
milk, that woman's milk is fittest for the child, out of whose womb the
child came.

3. Together with the milk passes some smacke of the Matter Bernardi liberos
suos alienis vberibus nutriendos committere refugiebat, quasi cum lacte materno
materni quodammodo boni infundens eis naturam. Guil. Abb. de vit. Bern. l. 1.
c. 1.
affection and disposition of the mother: which makes mothers to love such
children best as they have given suck unto: yea and often times such children as
have sucked their mothers breasts, love their mothers best: yea we may observe
many who have sucked others milk, to love those nurses all the days of their
life.

4. Other things are nourished by the same that they are bred. The earth out of
which plants grow, ministers nourishment to the said plants: trees that bring
forth fruit yield sap to that fruit, whereby it grows to ripeness:
unreasonable creatures, and among them the most savage wild beasts, as Tigers
and Dragons, yea sea monsters give suck to their young ones; whereupon the
Prophet says of women that give not suck Lam. 4. 3.
to their Children, that they are more cruel then those seamonsters, Like the
Ostriches in the wilderness: for the cruel Ostrich, and the hateful Cucco
are the two kind of creatures which are noted to leave their young ones for
others to nourish; the Ostrich leaves her eggs in the dust: the Cucco leaves
hers in other birds nests. Other creatures (if nature afford them not milk and
dugges, as to birds it does not) feed their young ones other ways, yet by
themselves.

5. Shall I add another argument which daily experience confirms, namely
Gods blessing upon this motherly duty: Matres maiore studio and cura nutrient,
nempe ex ipsis visceribus diligunt liberos suos. Cum nutrices vtpote quae
mercedem ament, charitatem praebeant subditiciam. Plut. de Instit. lib.
commonly such children as are nursed by their mothers, prosper best. Mothers
are most tender over them, and cannot endure to let them lie crying out,
without taking them up. and stilling them; as nurses will let them cry and
cry again, if they be about any business of their own. For who are commonly
chosen to be nurses? even poor country women which have much work to do,
and little help; and so are forced to let the child lie and cry, many times
till it burst again. Children nursed by their mothers are for the most part
more cleanly, and neatly brought up, freer from diseases; not so many die; I am
sure not so many through negligence cast away. The number of nurse children
that die every year is very great. It has been observed in many country
villages, that the most part, that from time to time die there, are nurse
children. Are not mothers that might have nursed their own children if they
would, accessory to the death of those that are cast away by the nurses
negligence?

On these and other like reasons heathen women, and very Arist. Oecon. l. 2. c.
3. Plutarch. loc. citat. A. Gellius Noct. Attic. comment. li. 12. cap. 1.
savages, have in all ages been moved to nurse their own children: and some
heathen Philosophers have urged and pressed the necessity of this duty. Never
was it more neglected, then among those that bear the name of Christians.

Let mothers know of what rank or degree so ever they be, that (out of the
case of necessity) they have no warrant to put forth their children to others
to nurse. We read not in all the Scripture of any holy women that ever did it.

. 13. Of the objections for putting children forth to nurse.
Object. Many nurses are mentioned in Scripture, as Rebekahs Genesis 24. 59. 2 Samuel 4. 4. 2 King. 11. 2.
nurse, Mephibosheths nurse, Ioash his nurse, and others.
1. Answ. Such nurses mentioned in Scripture were commonly dry nurses.
Rebekahs nurse went with her before she was married: how can it be thought that
she was a milch nurse? Could they tell when Rebekah should have a child? or
when Genesis 35. 8.
he had one, that Deborah (the nurse there mentioned) should have milk for
her? It is said that Naomi became nurse to Ruths Ruth 4. 16. and 1. 12.
^hilde: now Naomi was old, long before this she was past ^hild-bearing,
without an husband for many years: how then was it possible that she should
give suck? She was therefore a ^rie nurse, as other nurses mentioned in
Scripture.

2. Answ. The mothers of those children which are said to ^aue nurses (if those
nurses were milch-nurses) might be ^ead: or if living, not able to give suck
for want of milk, ^ipple, or for some other like defect: or if able, sin in
putting forth their children.

3. Answ. Though it be said that there were nurses, yet is no where said, that
a mother put forth her child to suck.

2. Object. Pharohs daughter put forth the child which she Exodus 2. 7.
^^oke for her own to nurse.
Answ. She bare not this child, nor was the natural mother of it, so as this
is nothing to the purpose. Yea it makes against the obiectors, in that the
true mother of this child nursed it.

3. Object. The metaphor taken from nurses is often used, Number. 11. 12. 1 These. 2.
7.
and applied to God, and to Gods ministers.
1. Answ. The using of a thing by way of comparison and resemblance does not
simply justify it: instance the parable of the unjust steward, and of a
thief. Luke 16. 1. etc. Reu. 15. 16.


2. Answ. The metaphor may be taken from a dry nurse as well as a milch nurse:
for the comparisons are not used of giving suck, but of bearing and carrying
in arms, as dry nurses use to carry children.

3. Answ. The metaphors are most fitly taken from mothers that are nurses to
their own children.

4. Object. Many mothers have not such skill in giving suck as nurses have.
Answ. Let them learn seeing it is their duty.

5. Object. Mothers that are of great wealth and high place cannot endure the
pain of nursing, nor take the pains in handling young children as they must
be handled.
1. Answ. The greatest that be must set themselves to do that duty which God
requires at their hands, though it be with pain and pains. Note Sarahs
example before recorded.

2. Answ. By this it appears, that if other women could bear their children
in the womb nine months, and endure the pain of travel for them, they would
hire them to do it. But seeing they do the one (namely bear and bring forth
their own children with hard labor) why should they not do the other? If
they say there is an unavoidable necessity of bearing and bringing forth their
children; I answer, that conscience ought to move them to nurse those children,
which necessity forces them to bring forth. God by this latter o^ nursing
children makes trial of women whether they will for conscience sake, do that
duty which they may if they will put off. But because God knew that many will
do no more then necessity lays upon them, he has made it a matter o^
impossibility for women to bear and bring forth their children by another.

3. Answ. If women would with cheerfulness set themselves to perform this
duty, much of the supposed pain and pains would be lessened.

4. Answ. Though they put not forth their children to nurse, they may for their
ease entertain a nurse, so they give suck themselves.

6. Object. A mother that has a trade, or that has the care of an house, will
neglect much business by nursing her child: and her husband will save more by
giving half a crown a week to a nurse, then if his wife gave the child
suck.
Answ. No outward business appertaining to a mother can be more acceptable to
God then the nursing of her child: this is the most proper work of her
special calling, therefore all other businesses must give place to this, and
this must not be left for any other business.

As for the husbands saving by putting the child forth to nurse, no gain may
give a dispensation against a bounden duty.

7. Object. It will break tender fair women, and make them look old too
soon.
1. Answ. Gods ordinance must not give place to women's ^^icenesse. Sarah was
fair and old: The Virgin Mary was fair and young.

2. Answ. Drying up a woman's milk will more break her, then her childs
sucking of it: for it is a means both of better health, and also of greater
strength, as to bear children, so to give them suck. Barren women and bearing
women which put forth their children to suck, are most subject to sickness
and weakness. The drawing forth of a woman's milk by her child is a means to
get and preserve a good stomach, which is a great preservative of good health.

8. Object. Husbands are disturbed in the night time, and hindered of their
sleep by their wives giving suck to their children.
1. Answ. By this reason neither mothers nor other nurses which have husbands,
should give suck to children.

2. Answ. Seeing children come from the loins of the father, as well as out of
the womb of the mother, they must be content to endure some disturbance as
well as their wives, and so much the rather that they may the more pity their
wives, and afford unto them what help they can.

9. Object. Many husbands will not suffer their wives to nurse their children
themselves.
Answ. Because it is a bounden duty, wives must use all the means they can by
themselves or others to persuade their husbands to let them perform it: they
must take heed that they make not this a pretext to cover their own sloth,
and lothnesse to this duty: they may not make themselves accessarie to their
husbands fault by providing a nurse, and sending the child away themselves: if
their husbands will stand upon their authority, and be persuaded by no means
to the contrary, they must be mere patients in suffering the child to be
taken away.

10. Object. Many poor women maintain their house by nursing other folks
children.
Answ. If they were not that way employed, they might take pains in some other
thing. But the gain of one may not make another neglect her duty.

11. Object. Some mothers cannot give suck, they have no milk: others cannot
very well, in that they have no nipples, or they have sore breasts, or are
sickly, or it may be that they have such a disease, as the child, if it should
suck of their milk, would draw to it self, and so the sucking might prove
very dangerous to the child.

1. Answ. God requires no impossibilities: wherefore in propounding the duty I
put in this caution (so far as they are able.)

2. God requires mercy, and not sacrifice: if therefore in Hos. 6. 6. Matt.
9. 13.
truth it be so that the mothers giving suck to the child will be dangerous
to her self or to the child, she may and ought to forbear: for giving suck
is but as sacrifice to preventing of danger, which is mercy. But women must
take heed that they pretend not inability, and danger without just cause. Some
are themselves the cause of wanting milk because they will not let it be
drawn down; or because they will not use means (for means there are) to get
and increase milk. There are means also to raise nipples where the breasts
are very flat. Refusing to give suck many times causes some sickishnesse in a
woman, and sore breasts, which might be prevented with the childs sucking. If
the forenesse be only in the nipples, a mother with enduring a little more
pain may safely give the child suck. Many mothers have given their children
suck when blood has run by the mouth of the child by reason of sore
nipples, and yet both mother and child done very well.

12. Object. Diverse children being nursed by the mother have died one after
another.
Answ. Due and through search must be made by those that are skillful: and if
any cause be found in the mother, then the rule holds, Mercy and not
sacrifice: but if none can be found, the issue must be referred to Gods
providence: and the uncertain even must not be an hinderance to a known duty.

Thus the answering of the forenamed objections makes the point so much the
more clear.

. 14. Of the fathers duty in encouraging his wife to nurse her child.
The duty which on a fathers part in this respect is required, is that he
encourage his wife, and help her with all needful things for the performance
of this duty. It is noted of Elka^ah, that he suffered his wife to tarry at
home while she gave suck to her son, and would not force her to go up to
the tabernacle as his other wife did, but gave her all the ease and content he
could, saying to her, Do what seems thee good. 1 Samuel 1. 23.
And of Abraham it is noted, that after Sarah had done giving the child suck,
he made a great feast, even the day that Genesis 21. 8.
Isaak was weined: one end whereof was to testify his rejoicing for Gods
blessing on her motherly duty so well performed.

. 15. Of the faults contrary to a mothers nursing her child.
Contrary to this duty do all such mothers offend, as for any by-respects
when no necessity requires put forth their children to be nursed by others. 1.
Some do it for ease and quiet, because they cannot endure to have their sleep
broken, or to hear their child wrangle and cry. 2. Others do it for
niceness, because they are loath to open their breasts, or to soil their
clothes. 3. Others upon pride, conceiting that their beauty would be impaired,
and they look old too soon. 4. Others upon gain, because they can have a
child cheaper nursed abroad then at home, where, at least, they must hire a
maid the more. 5. Others upon pleasure, that they might more freely ride
abroad, and meet their Gossips. 6. Others upon other by-respects: all which do
argue much self-love: little love to their child, and little respect to God.
They can be counted but halfe-mothers: for nursing a child is as much as
bearing and bringing it forth.


. 16. Of a fathers fault in hindering his wives nursing of her child.
To the forenamed fault of mothers do all such fathers make themselves
accessory, as forbid their wives to nurse their children, or are a grief to
them by their complaints of trouble, disquiet and expense: or afford not things
needful, or do not encourage them all they can to do it. The mothers both
pain and pains is the greatest: it is in comparison but a small thing that
fathers can endure therein. Their fault therefore must needs be the greater, if
any way they be an occasion of their childs putting forth to nurse: which I
have the rather noted, because husbands for the most part are the cause that
their wives nurse not their own children: and that partly by suffering, and
partly by egging them on to put out their children. If husbands were willing
that their wives should perform this duty, and would persuade and encourage
them thereto, and afford them what helps they could, where one mother now
nurseth her child, twenty would do it.

. 17. Of parents joint care about their childrens Baptism.
There is a further duty to be performed of parents to their children even in
their infancy, and that is in regard of their spiritual good, which is this,

Parents ought to procure that their children be rightly baptized in due
season.

This is indeed a common duty appertaining to both parents, but most
principally to the father, and that for two reasons.

1. The father is the chief and principal Governor, and has the greatest
charge: accordingly he ought to have the greatest care even in such matters as
are common to both.

2. The mother at that time by reason of her travel and delivery is weak, and
not in case to have her head much troubled with many cares; much less able her
self to take order for such weighty matters. Only the husband is to make
known to his wife (if she be not extraordinarily weak) what his purpose is
concerning the place, time, manner, and other like circumstances of baptizing
the child, and to advise with her about the name, witnesses, and such like
points. And if the husband be too backward and negligent, the wife ought so
far as she is able to put him in mind of his duty therein, and to stir
him up by her self or some other to perform it.

. 18. Of the reasons to move parents to see their children baptized.
That parents are bound to procure Baptism for their children these reasons
declare.

1. The commandment of God concerning circumcising Veraciter conijcere
possumus quid valeat in parvulis baptismi sacramentum ex circumcisione, etc.
Aug. de Bap. l. 5. c. 24. Genesis 21. 4. Luke 1. 59. and 2. 21. Ios. 5. 5.
^hildren: in the room whereof Baptism succeeds now under the Gospel (Col.
2. 11, 12.) Gods commandment to ^his duty was first given to Abraham: and
that for himself and all his posterity to observe (Genesis 17. 10.) After this it
was ^n the law laid down as a positive statute, Leu. 12. 3.

2. The practice of the Jews in a faithful and constant ob^^ruance of this
ordinance: as of Abraham; of Zachary and ^lizabeth: of Joseph and Mary, and
many others.

Object. The children which were borne in the wilderness were not circumcised.
Answ. They had no abiding place in the wilderness, but were ever and anon
removing: so as it would have been dangerous for the children to have been
circumcised: in that extraordinary case this rule took place, I will have
mercy and Mat. 12. 7.
not sacrifice.

3. The practice of Christians, who believing were themselves Act. 16. 15, 33.
and their whole household baptized. Under whole household children must needs be
comprised.

4. Christ's embracing and blessing such children as were Mat. 19. 13.
brought to him: and rebuking those that would have kept them from him.

5. The promise of God made to them: for seeing God is so Genesis 17. 7. Act. 2.
39.
gracious as to extend his promise to our children: our care must be to procure
the seal which God offers for the confirmation of that promise.

6. The right they have to Gods Kingdom. Baptism is an Mat. 19. 14.
evidence of that their right. It is parents duty to get them that evidence. If
children have just title to any lands and revenues, or to any earthly honors
and dignities, parents will do what they can to make that title sure unto them
even in their infancy: much more careful should they be to make that rich and
glorious inheritance, which is in heaven reserved for them, as sure unto them
as they can: now no better means for the effecting of this then Baptism.

7. Their conception and birth in sin. Children drew contagion Psalm. 51. 5.
from their parents: therefore great reason it is that their parents should see
them washed with the water of regeneration.

8. The comfort which from the performance of this duty will arise to
Christian parents, yea and to the children also themselves when they come to
the age of understanding. When parents behold the covenant of God surely sealed
and confirmed to their children, they cannot (if at least they bear any love
to their children) but much rejoice therein. And it must needs also much
comfort the child when (being of understanding) he shall know that from his
infancy he has carried the seal and pledge of his regeneration.

9. The constant continued custom of the true catholic Consuetude matris
Ecclesiae in
Church, which ever since the Apostles time has afforded the baptizandis
paruulis nequaquam spernenda est. Aug. de Genesis l. 10. c. 23.
sacrament of baptism to children.

. 19. Of Parents procuring their children to be rightly baptized.
There being such forceable motives to stir up parents to perform the duty,
(which motives show it to be a weighty duty) I will further show how this
duty ought to be performed.

Two things in childrens baptism ought to be observed. 1. That it be rightly
done. 2. That it be seasonably done.


In the right performance thereof, some things are necessary, and some
expedient.

Things of necessity are these especially:

1. That the child be baptized by a Minister of the word. Matthew. 28. 19. Ioh.
3. 5.


2. That it be baptized with the element of water: the only element sanctified
to this purpose.

3. That the form prescribed by Christ (Matthew. 28. 19.) be In Patrem, and in
Filium, and in Spiritu^ Sanctu^ baptizamur, vt Trinitatis vnu^ appareat
sacramentum: sed in vno nomine quod intelligitur Deu^. Hier. in Ephesians. 4.
used, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
whereby the unity of the Godhead, and trinity of Persons is plainly set forth.

4. That the proper rite be used of applying the water to the body of the
child, so as at least the face of the child may be sprinkled therewith.

Things of expediencie are,

1. That the child be baptized in a public place, where Gods people
ordinarily meet together, being set apart for the worship and service of God.

2. That such a time be chosen out, as an assembly of Saints may be there
present.

These two circumstances are the rather to be observed, because Baptism is one
of the solemn parts of Gods public worship; a pledge of our incorporation
into the body of Christ, and communion of his Saints, and therefore with the
more solemnity, (as a matter of great moment) before many witnesses, with the
assistance of the faithful prayers of an assembly of Saints, to be performed.

. 20. Of Parents care to give a fit name to their child at his Baptism.
A third matter of great expediencie about a child's baptism, is, that Parents
be careful in giving a fit name.

It belongs to Parents to give the name to their child: for so Parents must
give the child's name.
holy parents (whose pattern in Scripture is in this respect commended unto
us) have done from time to time: and for their warrant to do it, it is worthy
to be noted, that when God was pleased to appoint a name to a child, he gave
in charge to the Parent so to name him, saying to him, Genesis 17. 19. Matthew. 1.
21. Luke 1. 13.
Thou shall call his name thus and thus.

It is also evident, that the time of Baptism is the fittest time for giving
the name. Luke 1. 59. and 2. 21.
Under the Law, childrens names were given at their Circumcision: and so under
the Gospel it has in all ages been used: and that for these reasons. 1. That
their names may be a testimony of their baptism. Why the name is given at
baptism.
2. That so often as they hear their names, they may be put in mind of their
baptism. 3. That they might know how by name they are given to Christ to be
his soldiers, and therefore there must be no starting from him. 4. That they
may also be assured, that being baptized with water and the spirit, by name
they are registered in heaven.


Now because names are so solemnly given, and of so good use, Fit names to be
given.
most meet it is that fit names should be given to children. And for proof
hereof, let the names which in Scripture are recorded to be given by God
himself, and by such holy men and women as were guided by his spirit, be
observed; and we shall find them to be holy, sober, and fit names.

For direction to parents in this duty, I will set down some sorts and kinds
of names as be fit, and beseeming Christians.

1. Names which have some good signification: and among them such as are
warranted by the Scripture, as John (the grace of God) Jonathan (the gift of
God) Andrew (manly) Clement (meek) Simeon (obedient) Hannah (gracious) Prudens
(wise) and such like: that thus their name may stir them up to labor after
the virtue signified thereby.

2. Names which have in times before us been given to persons of good note,
whose life is worthy our imitation, as Isaak, David, Peter, Marie, Elizabeth,
and such like: that the names may move them to imitate those worthies.

3. Names of our own ancestors and predecessors, to preserve a memory of the
family: which appears to have been an ancient practice even among Gods
people, in that the friends would have had Zachariahs son named Zachariah;
and when the Luke 1. 59, etc.
mother had just cause to name him John, they answer, none of thy kindred is
called by this name.

4. Usual names of the country, which custom has made familiar, as Henry,
Edward, Robert, William, and such like among us.

. 21. Of Parents care in bringing their children to be baptized in due season.
Though Christians are not so strictly tied to a set day, as the Jews were to
the eight day; yet from that strict direction given to the Jews, we may well
gather, that it is not meet for Christians to defer the baptizing of their
children beyond eight days: for a young child of that age may with more ease,
and less danger, be baptized, then circumcised.

The most seasonable time I take to be the day whereon Gods Read the rubric
before the form of administering Baptism in our Common Prayer book.
people use in the place where the child is borne, publicly to assemble
together to worship God next after the birth of the child, if at least it fall
not out within two or three days after, which is somewhat with the soonest
both for mother and child.

Whether we respect the honor of God (the riches of whose mercy is lively set
forth in the sacrament of baptism) or the good of our child (which in that
sacrament receives a pledge and seal of that rich mercy of God) Baptism is
of great consequence: and therefore the first season of performing it to be
taken. For parents by their diligence and due speed therein, give evidence both
of their zeal to Gods glory, and also of their earnest desire of the child's
spiritual good.

. 22. Of Parents faults in neglecting their childrens Baptism.
Contrary to the forenamed duty of Parents about well baptizing their
children, are many aberrations, as

1. The corrupt opinion of Anabaptists, who deny the lawfulness of baptizing
children. The arguments before noted are sufficient to stop their mouths.

2. The practice of Separatists (coming too near to Anabaptisme) who
excepting against the ministry and orders of our Church, do what they can to
keep their children from that Sacrament. And to that end carry their wives
ready to be delivered unto a strange place, where they are not known, and anon
after they are delivered, privily convey wife, child, and all away, that so
the Magistrate may not, against their will, cause their child to be baptized:
and having no ministry of their own, nor means to convey the child over
sea, keep it many years unbaptized. Where is the evidence of their faith in
Gods promise, of their Christianorum filij si baptisma non receperint, scelus
refertur ad eos qui dare noluerint: maxim eo tempore quo contradicere non pote
rant qui accepturi erant. Hier. ad Laet.
respect to Gods ordinance, and of their desire of their child's spiritual
good? Though it be a great wrong to children to be kept from baptism, yet the
sin lies on such parents as procure not baptism for their children:
especially at that age when their children cannot gainsay it.

3. The perverse opinion and practice of certain ancient heretics, who in
stead of baptizing children with water, had them branded with an hot iron. They
grounded their error on a false interpretation of this phrase (he shall baptize
with the Holy Ghost and with fire.) Seleuciani baptismum in aqua non accipiunt.
Aug. de Haer. 59. Chemnit. harm. Euang. cap. 16.


Answ. 1. They err in taking this word (fire) literally and properly, which
was meant mystically and metaphorically.

2. They err in applying that to the outward action of a Minister, which was
meant of the inward operation of Christ. By this their misinterpretation they
thwart the maine scope of him who first used that phrase, which was to manifest
the difference betwixt Sine mysterio Trinitatis quicquid in vnam aut alteram
personam accipitur imperfectum est. Hier. in Joel. 2.
all other Ministers and Christ Jesus.

4. The opinion and practice of those, who use other forms of Baptism,
besides this, (In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.) Their opinion and practice is grounded on certain concise phrases used
by the Apostles: such as these, Baptized in the name of Jesus Christ: In the
name of the Lord: In Act. 2. 38. and 10. 48. and 19. 5.
the name of the Lord Jesus, etc.

Answ. Those phrases rather set forth the very substance and inward matter of
Baptism, then the form thereof.

5. Their opinion and practice, who care not by whom their children are
baptized, whether heretics, idolaters, laics, or women: Little do they
regard the comfort of conscience, and strength of faith, that arises from
this; that a lawful Minister in Gods room and name, as Gods ambassador,
puts the seal of God to his covenant.

6. The practice of those as (I know not upon what niceness or state) must
have their children baptized at home in their private house. This manner of
baptising takes away much from the honor of that high ordinance, which ought
to be done with all the seemly solemnity that may be.

7. Their practice who bring their child to Church to be baptized, accompanied
only with the Midwife, and three witnesses. It were almost as good be baptized
in a private house: for it is not the walls of the Church, but the assembly of
Saints, that adds to the honor of the Sacrament, and is most of all to be
respected.

8. Their practice who upon state, or for great witnesses, or such by-respects
put off the baptising of their children longer then is meet, some, two or three
weeks, some, two or three months, some longer: whereby they show too light
esteem of this Sacrament, in that they prefer mere complementall
circumstances before a matter of so great moment. God often shows his just
indignation against such, in taking away their ^hildren unbaptized before the
time set down by them for baptism be come.

9. Their practice who care not what heathenish, idolatrous, Lasciua nomina
paruulis baptizandis imponenda non sant. Ioh. de Bur.
^idiculous names they give to their children. What respect ^oe they show
either to God in whose name their child is ^aptised, or to the holy Sacrament
it self, or to the congrega^ion of Saints before whom the name is given, or to
the child ^^ self who all his life is to carry that name?

. 23. Of parents providing things needful for the life and health of their
children.
Hitherto of the duties of parents respecting their childrens Infancy. Such as
respect their childhood follow.

The childhood of a child is ^eckoned from the time that it ^eginneth to be of
any discretion and understanding till it be ^t to be placed forth: even so Many
distinguish the whole course of a man's life into four parts. 1. Childhood 2.
Youth. 3. Man-age 4. Old Age.
long as ordinarily it lives under the parents government.

The duties which parents for this time must perform to their children may be
drawn to these two heads. 1. Care to bring them up. 2. Care to place them
forth.


For their well training up, respect must be had both to their temporal and
also to their spiritual good.

Two things are required of parents, in regard of the temporal good of their
children. 1. To nourish them well. 2. To nurture them well.


Children must be well Fed. Taught.

Childhood from his birth to 14. years.

Youth from 14 to 25.

Man-age from 25. to 50.

Old age from thence to his death.

But for better distinguishing the duties which parents are to perform, I
follow not so accurate a division, but rather distinguish the degrees of age
according to the times wherein new duties are to be performed: and therefore I
make a distinction betwixt infancy and childhood.

Feed them in discipline, says the Apostle.

Under nourishment are comprised all needful things for (...). In prole
attenditur vt amanter suscipiatur, benign nutriatur, religiose educetur. Aug.
de Genesis ad lit. l. 9. c. 7. Refectionis tempus, and mensura, and qualit as
pueris competenter discernantur. Basil. Ascet. c. 15.
health and life: which parents ought to provide for their children, as

1. Food, which Christ takes for a ruled case. Whence he draws his argument
to show that God will provide for his children. What father (says he) if his
son ask him bread would give him a stone, etc. Mat. 7. 9, 10, 11.

2. Apparel, for it is expressly noted, that Israel made his son a coat, (Genesis
37. 3.)

3. Recreation, which in young children especially is needful for their
health. In that Zachary chap. 8. verse. 5. told the Jews, and that in way of
blessing, that boys and girls should be playing in the streets, he implies
that it is a lawful and meet thing, which parents should permit unto their
children. But yet the time, and measure, and kind of recreation must be well
ordered.

4. Means for recovery of health when they are sick: for this end was it,
that 1 King. 14. 2.
Jeroboam sent his wife to the Prophet, in behalf of his son who was sick:
that Ioh. 4. 47.
the Ruler came to Christ for his son also who was at point of death; and
that many others came to him for their sons and daughters being ill.

Whatsoever other things are needful, parents to their power 1 Timothy 5. 8.
must provide for their children: else the Apostle counts them worse then
Infidels.

Both equity and necessity require thus much of parents.

Equity, in that children owe all their pains and service to their parents
while they are under them, and are wholly at their command, and in that regard
have no means to provide needful things but by their parents help. Parents
therefore in all right must herein be helpful to them.

Necessity, in that, if the life and health of children be not well provided
for, no duty, no service can be expected at their hands.

. 24. Of parents too much niggardliness, and carelessness toward their
children.
There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed provident 1. Contrary,
Covetousness Non est boni parentis qucm procrearit, and eduxerit, cum non and
vestire and ornare. Cic. de Orat. Nonne ipsae ferae foetus suos arctissime
amant? Nihilne fando de pardis, apris, boumque armentis audijsti, quanto cum
tremore eorum saluti consulant? Greg. Naz. ad Ueial.
care of parents for their childrens good:

In the defect, Covetousness.

In the excess, Lavishness.

Some parents so far fail in the defect, as they almost starve their
children through want of necessaries: not affording them sufficient wholesome
food, nor meet and comely appa^ell, but suffer them to go tagged and ragged
like beggars ^rats: if they be sick, God may recover them if he please, but
the parents will use no means when they are well, they afford them no time of
refreshing themselves by any recreation, but ^uer-strictly hold them in. There
is not only want of charity, ^ut plain unnaturalness in such parents: even
more then in ^^e most cruel beasts. For the wild beasts do with much
ten^ernesse provide for their young ones.

. 25. Of parents too much lavishness and indulgency upon their children.
Others surpass as much in the excess, feeding them too ^^intily: attiring
them too garishly: tending them too cockeringly: and letting them spend too
much time in sport and play. Many and great are the mischiefs that follow
thereupon: as

1. They who are in their childhood daintily fed, and too much pampered,
besides that for the most part they are most sickly, they will in time grow so
squeamish, and choice of meats, as their parents shall not know what to provide
for them, or when to give it them: The full soul loatheth an honey Pro. 27. 7.
comb: yea if a stranger comes to the table, where such a child sits, he
may soon observe that he has been too daintily fed. If at first children be
fed with ordinary moderate diet, they will afterward both be in better health
and liking, and also more contentedly, and thankfully accept whatsoever shall
be provided for them. But excess breeds diseases both in body and mind.

2. Vanity in apparel does also much corrupt young children: for there is in
them even from the cradle a natural disposition to outward bravery: now for
parents to pranke them up, what is it but to blow up the fire of that vanity,
and make it arise into such a flame as in time may much scorch the parents
themselves, and utterly consume the children: and yet how usual a fault is
this? how monstrously do many parents offend therein? what foolish fashion is
used of the greatest swaggerers, and lightest strumpets, which they will not
bring their children unto, and that when their children are not able to
discern betwixt stuffes or colors? what can this proclaim but parents pride
and folly? Proud maids are many times the instruments of pranking up children
(especially when they are little ones) more then is meet: but yet the blame
lies on parents for suffering it.

3. Tending children too cockishly makes them too long children, and too
tender: and often alters a good constitution of body. Some are so overmuch
tender of their children, as if a child never so little complain, or refuse
the meat (though for daintiness or fullness) the Physician must presently be
sent for, and the Apothecary sent unto, and the child with supposed and apish
kindness made much worse.

4. Too much sport makes them wild, rude, unfit to be trained up to any good
calling, and spends their spirits, and wastes their strength too much. Yet
many parents care not how much time their children spend in sport, and how
little in learning: they think it duls their children too much to be held to
school, or to any learning: whereas indeed too much play infatuates them more,
and learning would much sharpen their wits.

. 26. Of well nurturing children.
I refer good nurture in part to the temporal good of children, because (as
afterward we shall hear in the particulars) it is an especial means of the
outward temporal welfare of the child even in this world. Unless this be
added to nourishing, wherein do reasonable men and women exceed unreasonable
beasts? the most cruel beasts that be are very tender (as we heard before)
toward their young ones, nourishing them, and providing all things needful
for them till they can shift for themselves. But as God has given to man a
reasonable soul, an understanding head, capacity, docility and aptness to
learn, so ought parents to make use of those parts and gifts, lest for want of
using them, in time they be lost: and so children prove little better then
bruits. In this respect the proverb is true, better be unfed then untaught.
Experience shows that good education is better then a great portion. The Holy
Ghost does very much press this point on parents, as we shall after hear in
the particulars. For I will handle these three points. 1. The kinds of
nurture. 2. The time when it is to be done. 3. The means of well doing it.


. 27. Of parents neglect in nurturing children.
Contrary to good nurture is too much liberty: which often brings much woe, and
utter ruin upon children: it is the greatest enemy that can be of good
education, and the nurse of all vice Yet many parents care not to let their
children live as they list: all the care they take, is that they be fed and
apparelled. This is a common fault both of rich, and of poor parents. The rich
pretend that their children need no education, because they have enough to
leave them: not knowing that education is an especial means to make them
keep and well use that enough. The poor pretend that they are not able to
bring up their children to any thing: not considering that the Lord by his
providence has so ordered the affairs of men, that as there are fit
employments for the greatest, so also Si parentum incuria filij in
intemperantiam labentur, genitores rei animarum illarum fient. Constit. Apost.
l. 4. c. 11. I. The kinds of nurture.
for the meanest, which without much cost may be used. The fault therefore
wholly rests in the negligence of parents. And if thereupon children fall
into any riot, their parents shall answer for it.

. 28. Of parents teaching their children good manners.
The nurturing of children before mentioned consists 1. In teaching them good
manners. 2. In training them up to a good calling.


Not only heathen men, and other moralists which were but mere natural civil
men, but also the Holy Ghost himself has prescribed many rules of good
manners, and much urged and pressed the same.

1. The word (...). See Treat. 1.. 110.
nurture mentioned by the Apostle in this text which we have in hand, implies
as much: and the phrase which Solomon uses, Pro. 22. 6.
Train up a child in the way he should go: that is, teach him how to order
the course of his life.

2. The many Leu. 19. 32. Pro. 25. 6. Luke 14. 8.
precepts of reuerencing our superiors, and carrying our selves with respect
one to another, are rules of good manners. Hereof there be very many in
scripture.

3. Those rules are Genesis 23. 7. and 43. 33. Job 32. 4, 6.
commended by many examples of holy men recorded in Scripture.

4. Such as have Job 30. 1, 12. Luke 14. 7.
failed in the rules of good manners, and rudely carried themselves, are
reproved by the Holy Ghost.

Neither is it without good reason that this point is so set forth. For

1. Good manners are a very comely and seemly thing. But 1. Cor. 14. 40.
it beseems Christians to do all things decently. That decency is not only
to be applied to the affairs of Gods Church, but also to the whole course of
our life, in which respect we are commanded to walk (...). Rom 13. 13. 1 These.
4. 12.
decently, that is, to order all our actions and the whole course of our life
mannerly.

2. They are a thing of good report, and that both to parents and children: Now
we must do all things that are of good report. Phil. 4. 8.


3. They work a kind of delight, and love, and admiration, in those that
behold them, as is noted of the Queen of 1 King. 10. 5.
Sheba when she beheld the comely carriage of Solomon's servants: and of the
Egyptians when they beheld the orderly Genesis 43. 33.
sitting of Joseph's brethren.

4. They are an outward ornament to piety and religion, and make it to be much
more respected: in which respect S. Peter exhorts believing wives well to
order their conversation 1 Pet. 3. 1.
before infidel husbands: and S. Paul exhorts all sorts of christians to
walk decently toward them that are without. 1 These. 4. 12.


The Holy Ghost having thus urged the point of good manners, we may not think
it a mere complementall matter, and a needless point, but a bounden duty.

. 29. Of the objections against good manners.
1. Object. Religion and grace consists not in good manners: many that have
not a spark of Gods fear in their hearts, are able to carry themselves in
their outward behavior very orderly and mannerly.

Answ. Though grace consist not wholly in it, yet cannot grace well be without
it: it is a great ornament and comeliness thereunto. And though mannerlinesse
may be severed from a fear of God, yet Gods fear will not be severed from it.
Restraining grace may be in him who has no renewing grace: but renewing grace
presupposes restraining grace, even as reason presupposes sense, though sense
may be without reason. If such as fear not God can carry themselves comely and
mannerly, what a shame is it for such as seem to fear God, not to do so?
shall not those be a witness against these?

2. Object. Good manners are an hinderance to grace: they who are most diligent
in teaching or practicing the one, are commonly most negligent in the other.

Answ. This is a mere cavil. Sure I am that grace is no hinderance to good
manners. If any make good manners an hinderance to grace, it is their fault.

3. Object. Good manners to grace are as mint, annise and cummin, to the great
and weighty things of the law.

Answ. Grant it to be so: yet seeing both may stand together, why should they
be severed? Christ's rule is this, These things ought ye to have done, and not
to leave the other undone. Matt. 23. 23.


4. Object. Many that make great show of religion are very rude, and unmannerly.

Answ. If there be only a show of religion in them, no marvel that they have
no manners. If some examples of such as are truly religious and want good
manners should be showed, their pattern is no president, much less can it
prove that to be no duty which Gods word has set down for a duty. Many that
well perform some duties, much fail in other duties. Who almost follows
Gods word as he should in every thing?

. 30. Of parents suffering their children to be rudely brought up.
Contrary to parents care in teaching their children good manners, is
dissoluteness: when parents suffer their children to grow up in rudeness, not
caring how they carry themselves at home or abroad, toward their parents, or
toward others. Rude bringing up makes children to be of a crooked, perverse,
stubborn, churlish, furly, doggish disposition; as on the other side, good
nurture in this kind breeds in genuity, amiablenesse, courtesy, and
kindness. If such as are rudely brought up be children of professors of the
true religion, they bring a stain upon their profession: yea they dishonor
God, as if he were the author of unmannerliness and confusion, against which
the Holy Ghost protests: and they make 1 Cor. 14. 33.
themselves and their children a scorn in the eye and mouth of profane
persons, who will be ready to point and say, Behold the children of professors,
how rudely they are brought up, and ill taught: they have not so much as good
manners in them.

For avoiding this blemish, Schoolmasters and all such as Admonition to
Schoolemasters.
have the charge of trayning up young children, must bean help to parents in
teaching children good manners.

. 31. Of parents training up their children to some good calling.
The second branch of good nurture is a training up of children unto a good
calling. This charge (train up a child in Pro 22. 6.
the way that he should go^) directly condeth to this purpose. This duty has
from the beginning of the world been performed by parents, and their
performance thereof commended by the holy Ghost. Adam brought up his sons to
several callings: one was a Genesis 4. 2.
keeper of sheep, another a tiller of ground. The like is noted of Genesis 37. 12.
Iaakobs sons, Genesis 29. 9.
Labans, and Exo. 2. 16.
Reguels daughters, 1 Samuel 16. 7.
Ishas son, and many others.

Much good may from hence arise to parents themselves, to their children, and
to the people and places where such children Benefits of a good calling.
shall live.

1. A good calling is an especial means for children to maintain themselves
and family, to relieve those that stand in need, to ease their parents, and (if
the need of parents require it) to relieve and maintain them.

2. It is that way wherein Gods Angels have a charge to Psalm. 91. 11.
keep them while they walk in it.

3. It is a means wherein and whereby they may be serviceable to the common
wealth where they live.

4. It is the best place wherein the general duties of Christianity may be
most manifested, and best performed.

5. It is the best ordinary means that can be prescribed to keep a child
from the vanities of youth, from immoderate pursuit of pleasures, from
unlawful games, from idleness, from ill company, and such like evils; which,
as they are sins in themselves, so occasions and prouocations to other most
^grieuous and enormous sins, and prove to be the very ^bane of youth.

Object. Many parents have good lands to leave to their children: what need is
there of a calling to such?
Answ. 1. Much land may soon be consumed by such as have not skill well to use
it.

2. Maintenance is but one end of a calling, and that not the chiefest and most
principal.

3. More good may be done by skill in a calling, then by great store of land.

4. We are borne for others as well as for our selves: it is not therefore
sufficient to say I have enough to maintain my self.

. 32. Of parents care in choosing a fit calling for their children.
The point in general being declared to be a duty, I will Directions for
choice of callings. 1. General principles are to be taught.
add some directions for the better performing of it.

1. Children are to be trained up in those things which are the ground work of
all callings, as reading, writing, and principles of learning. Whatsoever the
particular calling be, these will be of great use to any one. Many that have
not been taught them at first, would give much for them afterward. Parents at
the first might teach their children those things with much ease and small
charge, which afterward cannot be Non sunt contemnenda quasi parua, sine
quibus magna constare non possunt. Hier. ad Laet. 2. The calling must be
lawful.
so well learned, partly for want of leisure, and partly because the parts of
those who are grown in years are not so fresh and fit to learn, as in
childhood they were. Those things are not to be contemned as small, without
which great things cannot stand.

2. The calling whereunto children are trained up must be lawful, approved by
Gods word, and not against the general rules thereof: so may they keep a good
conscience in the exercise thereof.

3. The calling must be fit for the child that is trained up 3. The calling
must be fit for the childs ability.
to it. As there are diverse callings, so there are diverse abilities of sundry
children: some are fittest for callings of wit and learning: others for
callings that require an able and strong body. Wherein the wise disposing
providence of God is much commended: for thus are men much more useful one to
another. Now for choice of a fit calling, a child's best ability wherein
especially it consists, whether in the exercise of mind or of body, is duly
to be observed: and also his inclination, to what calling he is most disposed.

4. Among fit callings (for there may be many) that which 4. The best callings
must be preferred. 1 Cor. 12. 31.
is best and the most excellent is to be preferred. To this purpose not unfitly
may I apply that of the Apostle, ccuet earnestly the best gifts.

On this ground let parents be exhorted to train up such Children to be
trained up to the ministry.
children as they find fit, to the great and weighty calling of the ministry:
no calling wherein any may do more good, and wherein (if they be able and
faithful Ministers) they can receive more comfort and contentment. This
exhortation is the more to be regarded, because in comparison of those who are
trained up to other callings, so few are trained up to this.

33. Of parents faults contrary to their duty of training their children up to
a calling.
On the contrary, many parents much offend in not training up their children to
a calling as they should. And the offense in this kind is committed many
ways. As

1. When parents suffer their children to live like little masters at home, and
pass over all their youth in idleness. Thus they prove very drones, and
caterpillars in the common wealth: if they have a patrimony, they soon waste
it: if they have none, they often prove either thieves or beggars: they are fit
for all companies: the readiest prey for the devil that can be: for they are
like the house empty, swept and garnished, which Mat. 12. 44.
when the evil spirit espieth, he presently enters into it with seven other
spirits worse then himself.

The wise lawmakers among the heathen is said to order Solon legibus cauisse
legitur, vt filius, quem parents nullam artem docuissent, non cogeretur illos
alere senio confectos, aut ad inopiam redactos. Eras. Instit. Matrim.
that the child which by his parents had been taught no Art, should not be
forced to nourish them though they were old or poor. This I all eage not to
justify the law (for it is against the Christian rule of ouercomming evil
with goodness) but to show how the very heathen judged the neglect of this
duty a great fault in parents.

2. When parents neglect to teach their children in their childhood the
general and common grounds of all callings: some upon niggardliness; others
upon carelessness. Thus poor men make their children unfit for many means,
whereby they might well maintain themselves: and rich men make theirs unfit
for magistracy, and for good society. Yea poor and rich are thus nousled up
the more in ignorance, and made the more unfit to profit by the preaching of
the word, and other means of spiritual edification.

3. When parents bring up their children in unwarrantable and unlawful
callings, as to be of popish and idolatrous orders; to attend upon papists; to
be stage-plaiers, keepers of dice-houses, etc. Some (which is horrible to
think of) train up their daughters to be common strumpets: and some Phoenices
Veneri donum dabant de prostitatione filiarum, antequam iungerent eas viris.
Aug de Ciu. D. l. 4 c. 10. vide Lud. Uiu. in hunc loc. Recte dicuntur parents
filios daemoniorum sacrilegijs obligare conantes, spir taliter homicidae. Aug.
Epist. 23.
(which is yet more horrible) train up their children to be sorcerers and
witches. How can they in these keep a good conscience, when the very works of
their calling are sin? Is not this to thrust them headlong into hell? They
who thus bind their children to the devils sacrileges are spiritual
murderers of them.

4. When parents have no respect at all to the fitness of the calling: as when
they train up children of able bodies, but dull and slow capacity, of a
stuttering tongue and other like imperfections, to learning, wherein they prove
very dunces, and lose all their time, or are not able to make use of the
learning which they have: or when they train up children which have a great
inclination to learning, and are very fit thereunto, in some other trade,
which, after many years speut therein, they are forced to leave.

5. When parents only seek after the most gainful trade, and never think to
educate their children most to the honor of God. How can such expect Gods
blessing upon the means used for their childrens good? Hence is it that among
Papists so many are trained up to Ecclesiastical orders and functions: and so
few among Protestants. For there is very great maintenance and revenues for
such among Papists: but little in comparison among Protestants: Infans tibi
est? ab infantia sanctitate imbuatur: abipsis vnguiculis Spiritui consecre tur.
Greg. Naz. Orat. 40. in S. Bapt. Lege Hier. Epist. ad Laet.


. 34. Of parents teaching their children piety.
The spiritual good of children, and that in their childhood, is to be
procured by parents as well as their temporal. Wherefore Parents must train
up their children in true piety. This is expressly commanded in my text under
this phrase admonition of the Lord. Under the law God did both simply Deuteronomy. 4.
9. and 6. 7 and 11. 19. Psalm. 78. 5, 6.
command it, and that very often, and also ordained diverse outward Exo. 12 26.
and 13. 14.
rites, and caused many visible and extraordinary Ios 4. 6, 7, 21.
monuments to be set up, that thereby children might be occasioned to ask of
their parents the mystery of them, and that parents from that inquiry of
their children might take occasion to Deul. 6. 20.
teach them the ordinances of the Lord.

This express charge of the Lord is further commended by that practice which
holy parents from time to time have yielded thereunto: instance the examples of
Genesis 18. 19.
Abraham, Pro. 4 4.
David, and 31. 1.
Bathsheba, 2 Timothy 1. 5. Reasons. 1. Benefit of piety.
Lois and Eunice, with many others.

1. Piety is the best thing that a parent can teach his child: for as reason
makes a man differ from a beast; and as learning and civility makes a wise
and sober man differ from savages and swaggerers; so piety makes a sound
Christian much more to differ from the most civil and well ordered natural
man that can be. Learning, civility, calling, portion, are all nothing without
piety. Now it is an especial point of wisdom, to seek the best good that we
can, as for our selves, so also for our children: yea this is an evident sign
of a parents true love of his child.

2. There is a necessity that children be taught piety, because 2. Necessity
of piety. Fiunt non nascuntur Christiani. Hier. ad Laet.
they are not borne but made Christians: by nature they are utterly destitute
of all piety: for by nature every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is
only evil continually (Genesis 6. 5.) and in that respect man is borne like the
wild ass colt (Job 11. 12.) so as a man were better be unborn then not
taught piety.

3. The charge and office of parents binds them to teach their 3. Charge of
parents.
children piety: for they are by God made watchmen over their children: if
therefore their children live and die in impiety through their parents
negligence, their blood shall be required at their parents hands: instance the
example of 1 Samuel 3. 13.
Elie.

Object. This duty appertains to Ministers. Why Parents as well as Ministers
are bour^d to teach piety.

Answ. 1. God has given an express charge hereof to parents, as we heard
before.

2. In the family a parent is all in all over his child: a King, a Priest,
and a Prophet. Therefore that which a Minister is to do for matter of
instruction in the Church, a parent must do at home.

3 Children have need of daily instruction: the parents pains in this kind
must be added to the Ministers: and both are little enough.

4. Parents having more familiarity with their children then Ministers, must
needs better know their capacity, and their disposition: and so may better
know after what manner to instruct them: whether to give them milk or strong
meat, whether to deal mildly or roughly with them.

5. Instructions from parents are commonly more kindly accepted then from
others: and children will the better relish them, when they come from their
parents. They say that a plant will best grow in the soil out of which it
first sprung: so instructions coming from those who both brought us forth, and
first brought us up, are like to do most good.

6. There is no such means to breed love in a child's heart, as to be an
instrument of bringing piety thereinto. Now who should more seek the true love
of a child then a parent? In this respect a parent is more bound to this duty
then a Minister.

7. It is impossible, that a Minister, who, it may be, has many hundred
children under his charge, should well instruct them all: It is therefore
requisite, that each parent look to his own children.

As these distinct answers satisfy the objection, so they serve as so many
more reasons to enforce the duty: wherefore to proceed in adding other reasons,

4. Great equity there is that parents teach their children piety, 4. Equity.
because they Psalm. 51. 5.
conceived and brought them forth in iniquity. If they suffer them to lie and
die in that corrupt estate, they are more cruel then the Ostrich and Dragon.

5. Children are most properly Gods: Ezec. 16. 20, 21.
borne to God: he is the 5. Gods children.
most proper parent of them: in comparison of God, fathers and mothers of the
flesh are but nurses. They must therefore nurture them in the admonition of the
Lord.

6. Piety is that, which of all other things, will make the child 6. Cause of
obedience.
most obedient, and grateful to his parents: for thus there is a double bond
to bind him: 1. his birth. 2. his new birth: especially when the cause of the
one has been also the cause of the other.

7. Nothing can more settle the heart of a wise parent on his 7. Comfort of
parents on their deathbed.
deathbed concerning his children, then assurance that piety is planted in
them: for then may he with stronger confidence commend them to Gods providence,
and with greater assurance expect his blessing upon them after he is dead.

8. Parents, by teaching their children piety, are an especial 8. Propagation
of piety.
means of propagating true religion from age to age, and from generation to
generation. No better means can be thought of. For if all parents were
careful of their duty in this kind, as there is a succession of children,
and thereby a preservation of mankind, so there would be a succession of those
that fear God, and thereby a preservation of true religion. My children that
are taught by me, may be fathers of children, and so teach that to their
children, which they have learned of me: yea after them may grandchildren prove
fathers of other children, and they teach their children the same, and so from
age to age others after them. This is the means on our part: and in our time
we must do our part: and for those who come after us, leave the issue to God.

Not only the great benefit of this point, but also the too much neglect
thereof, in most families, has moved me the longer to insist on it, and the
more forcibly to press it. For the better performing thereof, I will add some
directions.

. 35. Of directing parents how to teach their children true piety.
1. Whatsoever principle of piety, parents do teach their children, 1.
Principles of piety to be all taken out of Gods word.
they must be sure that it be grounded on Gods word: thus much this phrase
(admonition of the Lord) implies.

Thus shall parents be sure to feed them with good wholesome spiritual food,
such as shall make to their spiritual nourishment, and eternal life. In this
respect principles of religion grounded on Gods word are called sound, or
wholesome, or healthful words: 2 Timothy 1. 13. (...).
and that both in regard of their matter and substance, and also in regard of
their effect; they cause and preserve good, sound, spiritual health. We know
that natural men have a care to give their children such food as is wholesome
for their body: (for will a father Mat. 7. 9, 10, 11.
that is evil, give his child a stone, or a serpent, and not that which is
good?) Conscience must move religious parents, to have the like care of the
souls of their children, as nature teaches all parents to have of their
bodies. If parents be careful to draw those principles, wherein they instruct
their children, out of Gods word, they shall be sure not to poison their souls
with any error, heresy, superstition, or idolatry.

2. When children begin to read, let them read the holy Scripture: 2. Let
children at first read the Scripture.
so was Timothy trained up from a child (2 Timothy 3. 15.) Thus will children
suck in religion with learning: for there is a secret virtue lurking in the
holy Scripture (which is Gods own word) more then in any books of men: so as
through Gods Sacrae Scripturae nominibus vtantur, and loco fabularum selectae
illis historiae narrentur, and sententijs prouerbialibus ex Solomone
instituantur. Basil. Ascet. c. 15. 3 Catechize children daily. Deuteronomy. 6. 7.
blessing there may by this means be an inward work of grace in children even
in their young years. Besides, no books are more easy then many parts of
Scripture; and no histories more admirable and delightful, then the histories
of the Scripture. It is the advice of an ancient Father, that young children be
made acquainted with the words and names of holy Scripture: and that, in stead
of tales and fables, choice histories of the Bible be made known to them: and
that they be instructed in the Proverbs of Solomon.

3. Let children be catechized constantly from day to day: rehearse them
continually unto thy children, says the Law. That which is daily done, is in
Scripture said to be done continually: as the sacrifice which was daily offered
was called a continual offering. Here let this caveat be noted, that in giving
this spiritual food, parents deal with their children, as skillful nurses and
mothers do in feeding infants: they will not at once cram more into their
mouths, then their stomach is able to digest, but they will rather often feed
them with a little: so it is not meet, that parents be too tedious; that will
but dull a child's understanding, and breed wearisomnesse, and make it loath to
be again instructed: but precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon
line, line upon line, Isa. 28. 10.
here a little, and there a little. Thus shall they learn with case and
delight: and this being often performed, in time a great measure of knowledge
will be gained thereby. If a vessel have a little mouth, we use not to fill it
by pouring whole paile-fuls upon it, for so all may be spilt, and it receive
little or nothing: but we let the liquor fall in by little and little,
according to the capacity of the mouth; so is nothing lost, and the vessel
filled the sooner. Thus are children to be dealt withal.

4. To the set times of catechizing children, let other occasions 4. Take all
occasions from sensible things to make a spiritual use.
of teaching them piety be added: as at table, by resembling the spiritual
food of their souls, to that corporal food, whereby their bodies are
nourished: when they are walking abroad, by showing them the stars, how they
remain steadfast in their course; the trees, how they bring forth fruit in
their season; how all things are for the use and benefit of man, and thereupon
make spiritual uses: note the direction which for this purpose the Law gives
to parents, Thou shall talk to thy children of my words, Deuteronomy. 6. 7.
when thou sit in thine house, and when thou walk by the way, and when
thou lie down, and when thou risest up.

5. Let parents open to their children the mysteries of those 5. Open the
mysteries of the rites of the Church. Exo. 12. 26. and 13. 14.
outward rites which God has ordained in his Church, as of Preaching,
Baptising children, administering the Lords Supper, ceasing from work on the
Lords day, with the like. This was expressly commanded under the law. Visible
rites are great helps to the weak understanding of children, when they are
plainly opened and applied: yea they are also especial means of keeping in
memory the mysteries contained under them: as course threads or wiars are means
to preserve pearls put upon them. So often as they see the rites they will be
put in mind of the mysteries implied under them.

6. To this may be referred a declaration of such great and 6. Let Gods great
works be declared.
admirable works as God in former times has done for his Church: especially
such works as have been done in their time: and if any memorials be remaining
of them, make them known to children. This direction was also given under Jos.
4. 6, 21.
the law, concerning the monuments which were set up of the great deliverances
that God gave to his people. In particular when the day of the
gunpowder-treason is solemnized, parents ought to teach their children the
occasion of solemni^ing that day. And as God does any great works of mercy ^r
of judgment, point them out to children. When there is great famine, plague,
or any mortality, instruct children in ^he causes thereof: when victory,
plenty, peace, or the like, ^ach children from whence these come. Outward
sensible things do best work upon children.

7. Let religious school masters be chosen for children: so^^ewise 7. Let
religious masters be chosen.
other masters to whom children are put forth: and religious houses where they
are placed. Hannah commended ^er first borne child to old Eli, a good,
religious high Priest. 1 Samuel 1. 25. Magister probae aetatis, and vitae, atque
eruditionis est eligendus. Hier. ad Laet.
^(...)^ masters themselves be religious, there is good hope that they will
instruct in piety such as are under them: which if they ^oe, what an help will
that be to parents? If both parents and masters join therein, it must needs be
very profitable to ^e children. If parents should fail, yet might masters make
a ^ood supply.

8. Let parents be to their children a good pattern and example 8. Be an
example.
in piety. I and my house (says Ios. 24. 15.
Joshua) will serve the Lord: he sets himself first as a guide to the rest.
Psalm. 101. 2. Nihil in te and in Patre suo videat, quod si fecerit peccet.
Mementote vos parents virginis, magis eam exemplis doceri posse, quam voce.
Hier. ad Laet.
I will walk in mine house with a perfect heart, says David, whereby he would
make himself an example, as to others of his family, so to his children.
Example is a real instruction, and adds a sharp edge to admonition. Much
more shall a religious parent do by practice then by precept. For children are
much inclined to follow their parents: let them go before, children will soon
follow after. Practice is an evident proof of the necessity of the precept
delivered.

. 36. Of Parents faults contrary to their duty of teaching their children
piety.
Many are the aberrations contrary to the forenamed care of teaching piety. For

1. Most parents care only for the temporal and civil good of their children:
so their children may be well fed and clothed, and brought up in some
profitable calling, whereby they may well maintain themselves in this world,
little thought is Job non tantum pro corpore filiorum sollicitus erat, sed plus
de anima cogitabat. Orig. in Job. lib. 1.
had, or care taken for their spiritual life in this world, or eternal life
in the world to come. Wherein are these parents better then heathen? Job was
otherwise minded: he was more careful for their souls then for their bodies.

2. Many are so far from teaching piety, as they teach their children
profaneness, pride, riot, lying, deceit, and such like principles of the
devil. It had been better for such children to have lived among wild beasts,
then under such parents. As the children hereby are thrust headlong to hell, so
their blood shall be required of their parents.

3. Others think it enough that their children be taught a religion, but what
religion it skilleth not. Such are they as having rich kindred but popish,
commend their children to the education of such kindred, in hope of some
temporal benefit, that their children may reap from them. If they were as
careless of their childrens bodies, they would be accounted little better then
murderers: and is not the soul more precious then the body?

4. So far are many from catechizing their children and that daily, as they
teach them not so much as the Lords prayer, the Belief, and the ten
Commandments. Wherein Papists shall rise up in judgment against them, that
are very diligent in teaching their children, Pater noster, Aue Maria, and such
like Latin principles, as the children cannot possibly understand.

5. Few use the forenamed outward helps, as the holy rites appointed of God,
the great and glorious works of God, his extraordinary works of mercy or
judgment, to instruct their children thereby. As they themselves care not to
take notice of any such thing, so they care not whether their children do it
or no.

6. So much do some prefer a little pelf before the true Alexander and in
moribus, and in incessu l. eonidis paedagogi sui non potuit carere vitijs,
quibus adbuc paruulus fuit infectus. Hier. ad Laet.
good of their children, as they care not to what schoolmaster they put their
children, be he profane, or popish, or unlearned, especially if he be a
kinsman, or one of their friends. Few will so do in case of their health or
outward estate: but will rather get the best Physician, or the best Lawyer that
they can. Children often learn such evil qualities of their schoolemasters as
they can never shake off again.

7. Many prove very bad patterns to their children, and give very ill example
by profanensse, riotousnesse, swearing, drinking, playing at unlawful games,
etc. These parents as they brought forth their children in sin, so they lead
them on forward to hell. Their evil example is not only an hinderance to the
good instruction of others, but also makes all their own counsels (if at any
time they do give any good counsel) to be in vain: for the left hand of
evil example Parents non educant filios in eruditione domini quia solliciti
non sunt pro salute vel perditione eorum. Orig. loc. citat.
soon pulls down more then the right hand of instruction can build again.

To conclude, those parents whose children are not brought up in the
instruction of the Lord, show plainly that they regard neither the salvation or
damnation of their souls.

. 37. Of instructing children so soon as they are capable.
Hitherto of the Kinds of nurture. The Time thereof follows.

In handling the time of II. The Time of nurture. Nurture must be begun betimes.
good nurture, I will show 1. When it ought to be begun. 2. How long it ought to
be continued

1. Parents ought to begin to nurture their children so soon as they are
capable of any instruction. Even as young birds are taught by their dammes to
fly so soon as their wings can carry them. Pro. 22. 6.
Train up a child (says Solomon) that is, while he is young and tender: and
again, and 13. 24. (...) maneinde in Picl (...) mane facere, id est, mature.
He that loves his child nurtureth him be times. Thus was Samuel sent when he
was very young to be trained up under Eli, (1 Samuel 1. 24.) and Solomon was
instructed by his father when he was tender, (Pro. 4. 3.) and Timothy was
taught the Scriptures 2 Timothy 3. 15. (...). Puer recens natus. Reasons. 1. Evils
prevented.
from a young child, or infant.

There are both privative, and positive reasons to press this point.
Privative, in regard of the mischiefs that may be prevented thereby. Positive,
in regard of the good that may be gained thereby.

1. Many are the evils which children by nature are prone unto, even as rank
ground is subject to bring forth many weeds: for Genesis 8. 21.
the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth: and Pro. 22. 15.
foolishness is bound in the heart of a child. If therefore they be not well
nurtured betimes, what can be looked for, but the fruits of evil, and folly.
But timely nurture will prevent such fruits, and be an excellent preservative
against their own natural corruption, against Satan's temptations and against
the allurements or discouragements of the world

2. Continuance in evil makes children obstinate, and 2. Continuance in evil
makes inflexible. 1 Samuel 2. 25.
inflexible therein. Elies sons being suffered to go on in wickedness till
they came to ripeness of years, would not afterward harken to the voice of
their Father. What creature can be tamed, if it be not begun with while it is
young?

3. When children first begin to be capable of instruction 3. Young children
most pliable.
they are most pliable to follow the direction of their parents as is evident
by the ordinary course of nature in all things Clay, wax, and such other things
while they are soft receive any impression: twigs while they are tender are
bowed any way: birds and beasts are easily tamed when they are young: corn
sown betimes brings a timely and plentiful harvest.

4. That which in childhood is learned, is longest retained: 4. What first
learned best remembered. Prou. 22. 6. Quo sem^lest imbuta recens seruabit od^rem
Testa diu. Hor.
Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not
depart from it. A vessel longest keeps that savor with which at first it is
seasoned: and by experience we may note old men best to remember the things
which in their childhood they learned: yea by well educating children from
their infancy much labor may afterward be spared: for constant use of virtue
brings it unto a law. Si liberis ab ipsis statim initijs leges optimas
imponamus, minimum posthac laborabimus. Consuetudo ipsa virtutis in legem
transiet. Chrysostom. in 1. Tim. Hom. 9.


Object. To teach children while they are young, is but as to teach a Parrot or
such like unreasonable creatures: they may learn what is taught them, but they
cannot conceive it.

1. Answ. Though children have not so deep an apprehension while they are
young, as they have when they come to riper years, yet so soon as they are
capable of instruction, they do much better conceive what is taught them, then
unreasonable creatures can do.

2. Though that were granted, yet it would not thereupon follow, that it is
better not to be taught while they are young. For, first it is better that they
should be framed and squared to a good course, before they can discern betwixt
good and evil, ^hen be suffered to run on in evil, till they get an habit
^herein; which after it is got, will hardly be cast off. Secondly, by teaching
them before they can well conceive, their apprehension is much helped. What may
be the reason that ^hildren of kings, and great men are commonly of more
understanding at 12. or 14. years of age, then poor and mean ^ens children
at 17. or 18. but that they are sooner, and beter instructed? Thirdly, as by
age their understanding comes to more and more ripeness, they will more and
more ^^nceiue that which at first they did not so well understand. Then
scholars first learn their Latin rules, they learn them ^eerely by rote,
without understanding the meaning of them, Obsequentes facite filios vestros ab
infantia, attendentes ne in vos potestantem habeant praeter vestram sententiam.
Constit. Apost. l. 7. c. 4.
^t afterward come to make very good use of them. Where^^ children are to be
instructed betimes even for the benefit at may be after reaped, as corn is
sown in winter to receive ^^op the harvest following: and to prevent the
mischiefs at may fall out, lest they get head over their parents against ^ir
mind.

. 38. Of mothers peculiar care in nurturing young children.
By the way let mothers especially note this point of timely nurture, as a
point in peculiar appertaining to them. The Compare 2 Timothy 1. 5. with 3. 15.
grandmother Lois, and mother Eunice, first taught Timothy, Prou. 31. 1.
Bathsheba taught Solomon when he was young. Often does Solomon warn children
and 1. 8. and 6. 20.
not to forsake their mothers teaching.

Whereby he implies that mothers should teach their children especially while
they are young: which duty so belongs to a mother, as Prou. 29. 15.
Solomon lays the blame, and shame of the neglect thereof upon her: on the
other side the honor of well nurturing children redoundeth especially to the
mother. To this purpose is it, that the 1 King. 15. 2, 10.
particular names of the mothers of the kings are recorded in Scripture:
intimating thereby that mothers were a maine cause of the piety, or impiety of
such children. Solomon and Absalom had both one father, but diverse mothers. May
we not well think that Salomons mothers care to instruct him was an especial
means of his piety: and that Absoloms mothers neglect of this duty, was some
cause of his impiety? It is expressly noted of Ahaziahs mother, that she was his
counselor to do wickedly, which made him so wicked 2 Chro. 22. 3.
as he was. Home-experience confirms as much: for if father and mother be of
diverse religions, most of the children will follow the mother. For while
children are young, their mother is most in their sight: she feeds, she
apparelleth them, she tends them when they are not well, (when the Shunemites
child being ill, said to his father, my head, my head, he said to his servant,
carry him to his mother.) Her precepts therefore 2 King. 4. 19.
and practice in that respect are best heeded by the children, and she has the
best opportunity to persuade them to what she likes best: so as what they
learn in their younger years, commonly they learn of their mothers: and that
which then they learn, for the most part sticks most close unto them, and is
longest retained by them, as was noted. 37.
before.

I have not thus in particular pressed this point upon mothers, as if I
exempted fathers from all care of nurturing their children in the beginning:
for in my text the Apostle named Fathers: and Solomon says, that his father
taught him eue^ while he was tender: and David felt the smart of neglecting hi^
other children. It is therefore (as has before been proved) a joint duty
belonging to both. Fathers therefore must do their best endeavor, and see that
mothers do theirs also, because he is a governor over child, mother, and all.

. 39. Of letting slip the best time for nurture.
Contrary is the negligence of most parents, who let the best years wherein
their children are most docible pass over in wantonness, vanity, and folly:
and so lose that which can never be recovered again, most precious time. Hence
is it that when they go about to reclaim their children, they find them
exceedingly perverse and headstrong: much like to a strong big arm of a
tree, which if a man go about to straiten, he cannot easily make it bow: and
though it bow, yet will it not continue to stand as he would have it: nay it
may be that it will rather break then bow much. Such a branch was Adoniah. It
is apparent that in his childhood he was not well nurtured, for his father
would not displease him from his childhood. 1 King. 1. 6.


The fathers putting off this duty to the mother, and the mothers putting it
off to the father, is a great cause of the neglect thereof. Were both of them
persuaded that it belonged to them both, and in that respect would to their
power be helpful each to other, children would much better be instructed.

. 40. Of parents continuing to nurture their children.
As parents must begin betimes to nurture their children, so they must hold on
therein, as long as they retain any government over them: yea so long as they
remain to be parents unto them. Some difference there may be in the manner of
performing this duty: for children are to be used as children: and they who are
grown in years, and of riper understanding, accordingly to be dealt withal:
yet still must parents have a care of their well doing. The word used in my
text and translated Children, is a general word which in Scripture and other
(...).
writers is used to set forth all sort of children, of what sex, of what age,
of what degree soever they be. In handling the duty of children we Treat. 5..
62.
showed, that children owed a subjection to parents so long as they lived
together: wherefore by the rule of relation, so long also an authority
remains in parents over their children, and accordingly they ought to have a
fatherly care for their good. On this ground Eli did well in admonishing 1 Samuel
2. 25. Job 1. 5. Hoc faciebat ille beatus vir, non semel, aut secundo, neque
vno anno, aut duobus, sed sic faciebat Job omnibus diebus vitae eorum. Orig. in
Job lib. 1.
his children after they were married: his fault was that he went not far
enough in doing his duty: somewhat he did, but not all that he should and might
have done. Job is commended for the care he had over his children when they
were grown in years: for day by day he sent for them and sanctified them: and
that after they had several houses of their own, and dwelt apart: and this
all their days.

For the performance of that which is now urged, parents must so carry
themselves from time to time toward their children, as they ever keep the
reins in their own hands, and Direction.
retain a power to curb their children as they see occasion. They may, as
their children grow up in years, slaken the reins more and more, but never
let them clean go, and cast them loose on their childrens neck.

. 41. Of parents folly in letting go all their power over their children.
Contrary is their folly who put themselves in their childrens power, and let
go all their authority over them. Many Aegre reprendas quod sinis consuescere.
Hier. ad Laet.
parents that have thus done, having by woeful experience found the mischief
and inconvenience that has followed thereupon, have much repented their folly,
and used means of redress, but all too late. For a mischief is much more
easily prevented then redressed. All the power that David had could not hold in
Absalom after he was permitted to have 2 Samuel 15. 1.
horses, and chariots, and men at his command. If David, as he begun, had
continued to keep him within a compass, and still held him under, all the
treasonable plots which he put in execution, might easily have been prevented.
Our times afford too many examples of parents folly in this kind, and of the
mischiefs following thereupon.

Of Time of nurture thus far. The means thereof follow.. 42. Of adding
admonition to instruction.
The means of helping forward the good work of nurture III. The means of
nurture.
are especially two. 1. Frequent admonition. 2. Due correction.


Both of them are implied in this text: one in the word translated admonition,
which (according to the notation of the (...). See Treat. 1.. 120.
Greek word) is a putting of a thing into the mind, an urging and pressing of
it: the other in the word translated nurture. (...). See Treat. 1.. 119.


Now both these are to be joined together, as being very helpful each to
other. For admonition without correction is like to prove but mere vanity: and
correction without admonition will be too much austerity.

The duty which the first of these sets forth, is this,

Parents must often whet instruction upon their children: they Annuncia,
praecipe, impera, suade eis, etc. Aug. de salut. docum. cap. 29.
may not think it enough to tell their children what they ought to do, but to
instruction they must add admonition: and, as it were, beat into their
childrens heads the lessons which they teach them: that so they may make a
deeper impression in their hearts. Thus shall their instructions be like the
words of the wise which are as nails fastened, or fast knocked Eccl. 12. 11.
in: they remain firm where they are once fastened, and cannot easily be
plucked out: for as many blows do knock a nail up to the head (as we speak)
so many admonitions do settle good instructions in a childs heart, and cause
that the heart be established in that which is taught, Heb. 13. 9.
which is a thing to be labored after. The general exhortation of being 2 Timothy 4. 2.
instant in season and out of season may be applied to this purpose: but more
pertinently that Deuteronomy. 6. 7. (...) Acuit. in Piel acuit valde, vel frequenter.
Metaphora ducta a gladio, qui dum acuitur saepius impellitur ad cotem. Vatab.
in annot. in hunc loc. vide Treat. 1.. 120.
direction which is in particular given to parents of whetting Gods words upon
their children.

To this purpose is it that Solomon uses to double his instructions, and urge
them again and again, as Pro. 1. 8.
hear the instruction, forsake not the law: and 2. 1, 2. Direction.
receive my words, hide my commandments within thee: incline thine ears,
apply thy heart, etc. yea of the repeateth the very same precepts.

The apprehension of children is fickle, and their memory weak: if they be but
once, or seldom, or slightly instructed, that which is taught will soon slip
away, and do little or no good.

For the better performing of this duty, parents must think of the best
means they can to fasten their instructions upon their children: and observe
their inclination and disposition, and see with what they are most moved.
Constant exhortations, and powerful persuasions are comprised under
admonition, which in their kinds, as occasion requires, are to be used.

. 43. Of parents wearisomnesse in instructing their children.
Contrary is the practice of those parents who soon wax weary in instructing
their children. The Apostle lays it down as a general caveat in good duties
that we wax not Gal. 6. 9.
weary: if in no good thing we must wax weary, shall parents wax weary in doing
good to their children? Yet how many be there that having once taught their
children, think they have done duty enough in that kind: if their children
will take it, they may. They are loath to take too much pains in often urging
the points which they have taught them.

Thus that teaching vanishes away: and so it falls out, as we say in the
proverb, as good not at all as never the better. This is one point wherein old
Eli failed: for he gave very good instruction to his children: but because he
there stayed, neither was that accepted of God as a sufficient discharge of his
duty, nor were his children any whit bettered thereby. If this were a fault in
him notwithstanding his children were come to years of discretion, and to
ripeness of understanding, how much greater is the fault in those whose
children are but young?

Object. If a child take not instruction at first, he is but of an untoward
and perverse disposition: all the pains that can be taken will be lost.

Answ. It may be childishness rather then perverseness, or some imperfection,
rather then obstinacy. Considering the necessity of good nurture, no pains may
be thought too much. There is more perverseness, and untowardness i^ such
parents as wax weary in doing this duty, then in such children as at first are
not wrought upon: for this is a means ordained of God to cure this
untowardness.

. 44. Of parents reproving their children.
The other means of helping nurture is correction.

Which is of two sorts; Verbal, by Words. Real, Blows.

The former is reprehension: and it must always go before the latter, which
is most usually and properly called Correction.

Reprehension is a kind of middle thing betwixt admonition and correction: it
is a sharp admonition, but a mild correction.

It is the rather to be used because it may be a means to prevent strokes and
blows, especially in ingenuous, and good natured children (for Pro. 17. 10.
a reproof enters more into him that is wise, then a hundred stripes into a
fool) and because it may be used, when it is not so meet to use strokes and
blows: as when children are grown to man-age.

The many good fruits which the holy Ghost notes to proceed from due reproof
do show that it is a duty whereof parents ought to make conscience as they
desire to promote the good of their children: and so much the rather because
many good fruits redound to the parents that reprove, as well as to the
children reproved. In regard of their good who are reproved, it is said, Pro.
6. 23.
Reproves for instruction are the way of life: they cause and 15. 32.
understanding; and make and 15. 5.
prudent. In regard of their good who reprove, it is said, and 24. 25.
To them that rebuke shall be delight (that is, much comfort and matter of
rejoicing, so as they shall not need to repent what they have done) and a
blessing of good shall come upon them, that is, either a blessing of good men,
who will bless, praise and commend them: or a blessing of good things, and
that from the Lord who will reward them for this conscionable performance of
their duty.

Upon these grounds Genesis 9. 25. and 34. 30. and 49. 4.
holy men have not spared to rebuke their children as there was occasion.
Though 1 Samuel 2. 23. Eli dum filijs molestus esse seuera increpatione recusat,
and illos and seipsum ^na perdidit, Chrysostom. in 1 Timothy hom. 9. 1 King. 1. 6.
Eli did somewhat in this duty, yet because he was not more severe therein, ^he
brought destruction both upon himself and his children.

The direction noted. 40. and 47. and Treat. 4.. 35. may be here applied.

. 45. Of parents cockering their children.
Contrary is their too much doting on children, who are ^oth to give them a
foul word. David (though otherwise a ^very wise man) herein manifested much
folly, for he displeased ^ot Adoniah at any time in saying, why have thou done
so? and like enough it is, that also he so cockered his other rebellious son
Absalom. Note the fearful issue that followed thereupon both to father and
children. Though their father would not displease them, yet they cared not to
displease their father, yea to grieve his heart, and vex his soul. The like
may all foolish doting parents look for at their childrens hands. For first
parents by neglect of this duty highly displease God: therefore in just
revenge will God give their children over to Omnia quae deliquerint filij, de
parentibus requiruntur qui non erudierint silios suos. Orig. in Job. lib. 1.
displease and vex them. Secondly, neglect of reproof is a means to make
children rude, presumptuous, rebellious, and so careless to please their
parents. Yea all things where in children offend through want of education
shall be required at their parents hands.

. 46. Of correcting children.
The latter and more proper kind of correction which is by stripes and blows
is also a means appointed by God to help the good nurture and education of
children. It is the last remedy which a parent can use: a remedy which may do
good when nothing else can.

It is by the holy Ghost both expressly commanded, and also very often pressed
under these and such like phrases, Pro. 19. 18.
Ch^sten thy son: and 29. 17.
correct thy son: and 23. 13.
withold not correction from the child: Verse. 14.
thou shall smite him with the rod. Were there no other motive, this were
sufficient. Gods charge was such a motive to Abraham, as at it he would have
sacrificed his son: Genesis 22. 2, 3.
and wilt not thou at Gods command correct thy child?

It is further commended by Gods own example, which is not only set forth in
some particular instances, but by his general constant dealing with all, and
that as an especial token and fruit of his love. For whom the Lord loves he
chasteneth, Heb. 12. 6, 8.
and scourges every son whom he receives. If ye be without chastisement
whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons. Let this example
of God be well weighed, for it is of great weight. Who can better tell what
kind of dealing is fittest for children then God? Who can better nurture
children then God? Who does more truly aim at, and procure the good of
children then God? Yea who does more tender children then God? If God the
father of spirits in wisdom and love thus deal with his children, fathers of
the flesh may not think by the contrary to show wisdom or love. Their wisdom
will be folly, their love hatred. Upon these grounds it is taken for a thing
granted, that parents (who tender the good of their children as they should)
do chastise their children as need requires: for it is said, that the Pro. 3.
12.
Lord corrects whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.
If parents used it not, this were no good inference to say, as a father:
again, as a thing without controversy it is said, Heb. 12. 9.
we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us.

The grounds of the equity of this duty, respect partly the Reasons to move
parents to correct.
children corrected, and partly the parents that correct. In regard of
children, it freeth them from much evil, and works in them much good.

Correction is as physic to purge out much corruption 1. Benefits of
correction to the parties corrected.
which lurketh in children, and as a salve to heal many wounds and sores made
by their folly. In which respect Solomon says, that Pro. 22. 15.
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction
shall drive it far from him: and again, and 20. 30.
The blewnesse of a wound is a purging medicine against evil: so do stripes
the inward parts of the belly. In regard of the inward operation of this
physic, correction is further said to preserve a child from death, ( Pro.
23. 13.
if thou beatest him he shall not die) and that not only from temporal death
(as many children are thus preserved from the Magistrates sword) but also from
eternal death ( Verse. 14.
thou shall deliver his soul from hell.) Note this ye cockering parents, whose
overmuch lenity is very great cruelty. For may we not justly count him a
cruel parent, that should suffer diseases, boiles, sores, and wounds to
remain, increase, and fester in his child, and give him no physic, nor
apply any plasters, or medicines to him? Nay rather who sees his son
running into a flaming fire, or deep water, and would not hold him back? Even
so cruel, and more cruel are they, who suffer their children to run on in
evil, rather then correct them.

Object. Who can endure to make his own child smart, and to put him to pain?
Answ. The future fruit is more to be considered, then the present pain.
Potions, pills, and corasiues, are fulsome, bitter, and painful; but because
there is a necessity of using them, and great mischief is prevented by the
use of them, wise parents will not forbear them for the sensible bitterness,
and pain. Fitly does the Apostle thus answer that objection, No chastning for
the Heb. 12. 11.
present seems to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless, afterward it
yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness. This may be applied to parents
corrections as well as to Gods.

The good which correction brings to children, is by Solomon noted in this
and such like phrases, The rod gives wisdom: Pro. 29. 15.
for it makes children observe, what is good, and what evil; what
commendable, and what blameworthy: and accordingly to do the good, and leave
the evil, which is a great point of wisdom.

Object. Instruction will better do this.
Answ. Instruction may give them more knowledge, but it is correction which
brings them to practice what they know, which is the Matt. 7. 24.
chiefest point of wisdom.

In regard of parents, due correcting of their children both freeth them of
many inconveniences, and also brings to them 2. Benefits of correcting to him
that corrects.
much quiet.

1. It spares them much pains. For many admonitions often repeated, and
inculcated again and again, will not make many children so much to heed
wholesome and good advice, as a little correction. They are much more sensible
of smart, then of words.

2. It preuenteth much grief, shame, and vexation: for Pro. 17. 25.
a foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare
him. But it is and 22. 15.
the rod of correction that drives away foolishness, and so preuenteth that
grief and bitterness.

3. It freeth them from the guilt of their childrens sin, so as they are not
accessarie thereto, as Sam. 3. 13.
Eli was. For correction is the last remedy that a parent can use: if by that
he can do no good, it is presupposed that he has done his uttermost endeavor:
in which respect, though the child die in his sin, yet the parent has
delivered his own soul.

The quiet which is brought to parents by correcting their children, is thus
noted out by Solomon, Pro. 29. 17.
Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest, yea he shall give delight unto
thy soul. For children well nurtured, and by correction kept in a filial awe,
will so carry themselves, as their parents may rest somewhat secure, and not
disquiet themselves (as they do with children set at liberty) yea, as trees
well pruned, and ground well tilled, they will bring forth pleasant and
abundant fruit; and so their parents will have just cause to rejoice in them.

. 47. A direction to parents in correcting their children.
For well using this biting corasiue of correction, parents must have respect
to the matter for which they do correct, and to their manner of correcting.

In regard of the matter, these three things must be noted. Three things noted
in the matter, for which correction is to be given.


1. That they be sure there is a fault committed: that so there be just cause
of correcting: else more hurt then good will proceed from thence. If a corasiue
be laid where there is no sore, it will make one. If correction be unjustly
given, it may provoke to wrath, but will do little good. This is it wherein
earthly fathers are taxed, and made unlike to God, for that many times they
correct after their own pleasure: which is a point of great injustice. Heb.
12. 10.


2. That the fault be made known to the child corrected: and he apparently
convinced thereof. Correction must be for instruction, which cannot be, except
the child know why he is corrected: for it is all one to him, as if he were
corrected for no fault, if he know not his fault. God thus a first proceeded
with the serpent, Genesis 3. 11, etc.
with Eve, and with Adam. Thus Judges proceed in punishing malefactors. Yea
thus will men deal with a dog. Should they not much more with a child?

3. That the faults be such especially, as the parents can show to their
children (if at least they be of so much discretion) to be against Gods word;
as swearing, lying, pilfring, and the like: for 1. these are most dangerous
faults, and therefore more carefully to be purged out. 2. the child corrected
will thus be the better euicted of his fault, the more condemn himself, and
more contentedly bear the correction.

In regard of the manner of correcting, four general, and four Four general
rules for the manner of correcting.
particular rules are to be observed.

The general rules are these.

1. An eye must be had to Gods manner of correcting his children, and in
particular of Gods correcting the parent himself: no better general direction
can be given: for Gods pattern is a perfect rule.

2. Prayer must be made by parents for themselves and for their children: for
themselves, to be directed in doing it: for their children, to be bettered by
it. Thus will good Physicians in ministering physic. In all duties is prayer
to be used; especially in this: for a parent is ready, partly through his own
intemperate passion, and partly through the child's impatiencie, to fall into
one extreme or other. This is not to impose upon all, whenever they take up
the rod, to go and make a solemn prayer, but to lift up the heart for
direction and blessing.

3. Correction must be given in love. All things must be done in 1 Cor. 16. 14.
love: much more this, that carries a show of anger and hatred. In love they
will give physic to their children, and splinter a joint, if need be. God
corrects his children in love: so must Reu. 3. 19.
parents. Love will make them do it with tenderness and compassion.

4. Correction must be given in a mild mood, when the affections Nunquam,
iratus qui accedit ad poenam, mediocritatem tenebit, Cic. Offic. lib. 1. Ier.
10. 11. Four particular rules for the manner of correcting.
are well ordered, and not distempered with choler, rage, fury, and other like
passions. Disturbed passions cast a mist before the understanding, so as a man
cannot discern what is enough, what too much. When passion is moved,
correction must be deferred. God corrects in measure.

The particular rules are these.

1. Due order must be kept. Correction by word must go before correction by
the rod. Reu. 3. 19. Vt ad vrendum and secandum medici, sic nos ad castigandu^,
raro, inuitique veniamus, nec vnquam nisi necessario, sinulla reperietur alia
medicina. Cic. Offic. lib. 1.
I rebuke and chasten, says the Lord. Thus a parent will show that he takes
no delight in smiting his child: it is necessity that forces him thereunto.
Thus a parent shows himself like to God, who does not punish willingly, Lam.
3. 33. Physicians, when they minister strong physic, will give a preparatiue:
rebuke may be as a preparatiue. Good and pitiful Chirurgions will try all
other means before they come to lance and seere.

2. Due respect must be had to the party corrected: if he be young and tender,
the lighter correction must be used. Solomon often mentions a rod, as meetest
for a child; for that is the lightest correction. So if the child be of a
flexible and ingenuous disposition, soon sneapt, the correction must
accordingly be moderated. If he be well grown, and withal be stout, and
stubborn, the correction may be more severe.

3. Due respect must be had to the fault: Sins directly Cauendum ne mayor
poena, quam culpa sit. Cic. loc. citat.
against God, open, notorious, scandalous sins, known sins, sins often
committed, in which they are grown up, and whereof they have gotten an habit,
are with greater severity to be corrected.

4. A parent must behold his own faults in correcting his childs: so more
compassion will be wrought in him.

. 48. Of parents too much indulgency.
Contrary to this duty of correcting are two extremes. 1. Too much lenity. 2.
Too much severity.


Many so cocker their children, as they will suffer them to Qui non corripiunt
filios suos, and eorum animas igni inextinguibili in interitum tradunt, and
semetipsos in furorem iudicij dem^rgunt. Orig. in Job. lib. 1. 1 Samuel 2. 29.
run into any misdemeanour, rather then correct them. They cannot endure to
hear their children cry: and therefore their children must be pleased in all
their humors and evil desires. These parents bring shame to themselves, and
mischief upon their children: for God is often forced to correct such. Heavy are
Gods corrections: and often light on parent and child both: as appears by the
judgment on Eli and his sons: for such parents make themselves accessory to
their childrens sins: yea also to the judgments laid upon their children.
God says of such parents, that they honor their children above God. It is
therefore a fond indulgency which makes parents regard neither Gods honor,
nor their own or childrens safety.

Mothers for the most part offend herein, who are so far from performing this
duty themselves, as they are much offended with their husbands if they do it.
And to proclaim their folly to all the world, they cannot commit their
children to a Tutor or Schoolmasters, but with a strait charge, that they
correct them not.

Object. Correction makes children sots and blocks.
Answ. If Gods spirit deserve to have more credence then such foolish women,
that objection is most false, for we heard. 46.
before how correction gives wisdom, and drives out foolishness.

2. Object. Mothers may be the more borne with herein, because with long
trouble they did bear, and with great travel bring forth their children.

Answ. That may be a good motive for them to seek the true good of their
children, that so their trouble and travel may not be in vain: but not to
uphold them in the broad way that leads to destruction.

. 49. Of parents too much severity in correcting their children.
They who offend in the other extreme of severity, of the Patres non oportet
asperos esse circa filios. Cyp. Testim. l. 3. c. 71.
two are the more unnatural parents; they offend directly against the first
branch of this text (Provoke not to wrath.) Nothing more provoke then
immoderate severity: for

1. It argues no love in the parent, but rather hatred, at least wrath, and
other such like distempered affections.

2. It softeneth not the childs heart, but hardens it rather. Uerendum ne,
si parents ob quaevis errata filios coarguant, frontem tandem ipsi perfricent.
Greg. Naz. ad Vital.


3. It makes him dull, and stupid, and clean peruerteth the right and true
end of correction.

4. It often makes a child think of doing some mischief to his parent or
himself.

That parents may the rather take heed of this extreme, I will briefly note
wherein excess in severity is showed.

It is showed, when correction is given

1. For no fault. In this case, though correction be never so light, it is too
severe.

2. For small faults, in wrath and fury, though the stripes be few and light,
yet the parents behavior is too much severity.

3. To children that are young and tender, or soft, mild and ingenuous, as if
they were in some years, the most obstinate and perverse that could be.

4. Too often: for every thing done amiss: whereas parents Multa quae vident
parents videre se dissimulent; multa se minime audisse fingant quae auribus
infixa habent. Greg. Naz. ad Vital.
should seem not to see or hear many things which they see, and hear.

5. Too sorely: so as the child is lamed, or some way so hurt as he shall
feel it as long as he lives.

. 50. Of Parents care in providing fit callings for their children.
Having laid down such duties of parents as especially respect the childhood
of children, I proceed to lay forth such as have respect to their riper years
wherein they are to be placed forth.

Here we are to note 1. The kinds of those duties. 2. The means of performing
them.

The kinds may be drawn to two heads.

1. Providing fit places and callings for them to exercise their gifts.

2. Providing fit marriages for them.

We heard. 31.
before how children were to be trained up, and fitted to some good calling
even in their childhood. Now further, when by virtue of good education they are
enabled to discharge the functions and duties of a calling, and by years they
are well grown up, so as it is time they should be set to some particular
calling:

Parents ought to provide fit callings for their children, and fit Fit callings
to be provided.
places for them to exercise the gifts which by nature or education they have
gotten. For example, If children have been brought up in learning, parents
must use what lawful and honest means they can to settle them in such a place
and course as they may profess and exercise their gifts, according to their
several kinds, be it Divinity, Law, Physic, or the like: or if they have
been brought up in any trade, to provide that they may set up (as we speak)
and exercise their trade. The two first children that ever were borne of woman,
Genesis 4. 2.
Cain and Abel, were placed forth in several callings; and without doubt their
places were so ordered by their parents. The like may be gathered out of these
phrases, and 25. 27.
Esau was a man of the field, and Iaakob dwelt intents. 1 Samuel 8. 1.
It is noted of Samuel, that he made his two sons Judges. Had they been as
faithful in well using their places, as their father was careful in providing
them, they might have lived well themselves, and done much good to others.
Ishai having many sons, had a care hereof: for 1 Samuel 17. 13.
he sent his three eldest sons to the war; and placed them in a soldiers
course of life: and. 16. 11.
his youngest he made a shepherd, which was in those days and places a
calling of greater reckoning then now it is with us.

1. Thus shall they make use of that ability whereunto by The benefits of a
fit calling.
their parents providence, and their own diligence they have attained:
otherwise that ability may soon be lost. Does not daily experience show that
many who have been well trained up by their parents in learning, so far as
they have been fit to have entered into the ministry, for want of place and
imploiment, have in time so forgotten all, as if they had never been trained
up in learning: and so in other sciences.

2. Thus come they to do much more good in Church or Commonwealth: till men
be placed in distinct callings, they are but fitting and preparing for future
times. I deny not but that both Church and Commonwealth may reap much
benefit by the pains and labor of the younger sort, who are trained up under
others: but most properly are they counted members of the Church and
Commonwealth, and actual instruments of the good thereof, who have some
particular distinct calling, whereby they do good to others.

3. Thus they come to live of themselves, and to be able to relieve others
also. All the time of their education, they are commonly at the charge of
others: at least, though by their pains they may gain much, yet the gain
returns to others: they themselves for the most part have but a bare
maintenance, meat, drink and cloth (as we say:) little have they to lay up for
themselves for the time to come, or to give to others for the present.

4. They thus come to train up others against after times, as they themselves
have been trained up: whereby a continual and perpetual succession of all
kinds of callings, is from time to time preserved: and thus Family, Church,
and Commonwealth vpheld and maintained. In short time would all callings and
functions utterly decay, if a continual supply were not thus made.

. 51. Direction for parents in providing callings for their children.
Two especial cautions are to be observed by parents in Cautions in providing
callings.
providing callings for their children.

1. That such callings be provided as their children have been trained up
unto, and are in some measure fitted and enabled to perform the duties
thereof: as to provide a Ministers place for him that has been brought up in
learning and studied divinity: so in other callings such, as their children may
be their crafts-masters therein. Thus shall their children do the more good
therein, both to others and themselves. Bezaleel and Aholiab were chosen to
build the tabernacle because they were filled with wisdom to work all manner
of work: likewise Exodus 35. 35.
the servants of Hirom were chosen to hew Cedar trees for the temple, because
among the Jews there were not any that 1 King. 5. 6.
could skill to hew timber, like unto the Sidonians. Pharaoh was careful to
have men of actiuity rulers over his cattle. Genesis 47. 6.


2. That such means be used for providing a calling as parents in using them
may with faith call upon God for his blessing. They that by lawful means are
brought into a calling whereunto they are fitted, are set therein by God, as is
implied by this phrase, as God has called every one, etc. A lawful entrance
into a calling is a matter of great moment: he that so enters may in a right
use thereof cast himself upon Gods blessing, and with strong confidence expect
the same, saying as the Prophet did, Lord I have not thrust in my self thou
Ier. 17. 16.
know.

. 52. Of the extremes contrary to a parents lawful care in providing fit
callings for his children. 1. Extreme in the defect.

The extreme in the defect contrary to a parents provident care in providing a
fit calling, is, a careless neglect of children after they are well educated,
a leaving them to shift for themselves. Imitari noli crudelitatem earum auium
quibus vngues aduncisunt: hi cum suos senserint foetus volandi iom potestatem
consequutos esse, alis eos verberantes ac impingentes nidis pellunt, nullamque
prorsus erga illos extrusos curam d^inceps adhibent. Basil. Hexam. hom. 8.
It is noted of the ravenous fowls that have sharp talents, that so soon as
they perceive their young ones to be able to fly, they will flap and beat them
with their wings, and drive them out of their nests, and after that take no
further care of them. We may not be like such cruel birds: reason and religion
teaches us otherwise. Good education is a good duty, but not a parents whole
duty: the stay which is here made, may make all the former care and pains to
be of little ^^se.

Object. This is to be left to Gods providence.
Answ. Means rightly used are subordinate to Gods providence, and by them does
God manifest his providence and bring his counsel to pass: to neglect means
is to thwart and cross the divine providence. It is therefore well done to
rely on Gods providence: but ill done to neglect the means of effecting it.
Gods blessing is best discerned in the use of means.

The extreme in the excess is a preposterous greediness in 2. Extreme in
excess.
parents to bring their children to a calling. This is manifested two ways.

1. When they care not how fit their children be for the 1. Unfit caling.
place, so it be a place of gain and honor. Experience shows that this is
the bane of Church and commonwealth. Hereby it falls out in the politic
body, as it would in a natural body; if the hand should take upon it to see,
or the leg to hear, or the foot to taste, what could from thence be expected
but ruin to the body? Tradesmen often undo themselves, their families and
friends, by undertaking such trades as they have no skill in, or whereof they
are not crafts-masters. The more excellent the calling is, the more mischief
is done by this greedy preposterousnesse. This extreme is so much worse then
the former, as it is worse to do much hurt, then no good.

2. When they make no conscience of the means which 2. Undue entrance.
they use to bring their children into callings: but by unlawful means
purchase their desires: as, by Simony to procure an ecclesiastical function
(whence often follows also perjury) or by bribery to procure an office.

These indirect means take away difference betwixt fitness and unfitness of
persons: for the unfittest that be may by money purchase a place. Besides,
though children be never so (...) for these callings, yet there is little hope
of any blessing from God, when the first entrance is without him: yea against
his will and word. Who can think that God has placed such a^ one in his
place? if God have not placed him, with what faith can he seek a blessing?
with what hope can he expect a blessing? Much terror is by this means brought
to many men conscience: and they are often in a great strait, not knowing whether
it be fittest for them to retain, or relinquish the^^ What is to be done after
one is unlawfully settled in a fit calling.
place.

But by the way to resolve that doubt, if one that has unlawfully entered be
fit for the performance of his place, it then safest for him to seek pardon
for the former offense, and reconciliation with God, and upon true and unfeigned
repentance to hold the place (if at least the law under which he lives
establish him therein) and be so much the more faithful in the discharge of
the duties thereof.

. 53. Of parents care in providing fit marriages for their children.
God has further laid a charge upon parents to provide marriages Date operam vt
cum ad adulta^ aetatem filij peruenerint matrimenio iungantur. Constit. Apost.
l. 4. c. 11. lege Chrysostom. in 1. Tim. hom. 9.
for their children: for thus says the Prophet in the name of the Lord unto
parents, Ier. 29. 6.
Take wives to your sons, and give your daughters to husbands: and thus the
Apostle, 1 Cor. 7. 36.
If any man think that he behaueth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she
pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let them marry. This
direction was given in times of persecution, when by reason of the present
necessity it was better not to marry: if then a parent ought to be careful
(need requiring) to provide a marriage for his daughter, much more ought he in
times of peace. Holy parents commended by the Holy Ghost have been careful in
performing this duty, as Genesis 24. 4.
Abraham, and 28. 2.
Isaak, Rut. 3. 1.
Naomi, and others: yea Genesis 21. 21.
Hagar had learned this duty in Abraham's house. But the perfect pattern (which
surpasses all other examples) is of and 2. 18.
God himself, who provided a fit match for his Luke 3. 38. Reasons.
son Adam.

1. Children may not marry without consent of parents, (as was Treat. 5.. 16,
17.
before showed) Parents therefore must be careful in time to provide for them.

2. Parents are to children in Gods place: they must therefore take upon them
this care of God.

3. Marriage is the means which the Lord has sanctified to preserve our bodies
chaste and undefiled: as parents therefore desire to keep their children from
uncleanness and pollution, they must take care that this means be used. Not
only holy Apostles, but also Liberos qui voluptatibus nimis sunt dediti dabis
operam vt coniugio astringas: vinculum enim hoc est tutissimum inventutis.
Plut. de Instit. lib.
heathen Philosophers, and that by the light of nature, have found this to be
the fittest course.

4. This also is a means as to Genesis 1. 28.
increase the commonwealth, and Mal. 2. 15.
preserve an holy seed, and to erect new families, so to continue parents own
houses and name.

. 54. Direction to parents in providing marriages.
Two cautions are to be observed of parents in providing marriages for their
children.

1. That the match which they provide be meet: so said God when he was about to
provide a match for Adam, I will Genesis 2. 18.
make him an help meet for him. Therefore See Treat. 2. Part. 1.. 9, 10 etc.
the match provided must not be too near of kin, of a contrary religion, of
too unequal an age, of too great disparity in estate. These things will hinder
love, and cause disdain and hatred of one another.

2. Though the match may seem meet in the parents eye, yet he may not force
his child thereto. Could a fitter match have been found out for Rebekah then
Isaak? yet Rebekahs friends Genesis 24. 57. What to be done if children like not
such a match as parents think meet. Non cogitur filius-familias vxorem ducere.
Digest. l. 23. c. 2.. 21.
asked her consent. I deny not but parents may use all manner of fair means
to move their children to yield to that which they see good for them: but if
they cannot move them to yield, to refer the matter to God, and not against
their childrens minds to force them. When God had made a most meet match for
Adam, he brought her to the man: namely to see how he would like her. For the
nearest bond of all is betwixt man and wife; a man must leave father and
mother, and Genesis 2. 22. Sacra in hoc negotio parentibus authoritas esse debet:
sed tenenda est media ratio, vt sponte ac mutuo consensu inter se contrahant
parts. Call. in Genesis 24. verse. 57.
cleave unto his wife; man and wife must always live together: great reason
therefore that at the first joining them together there be a mutual liking of
one another, lest ever after there be a perpetual dislike: and though the
authority of parents ought in this case to be inviolable, yet a middle course
is so to be held, as the parties may willingly with a mutual consent join
themselves together.

. 55. Of the extremes contrary to parents care in providing fit marriages for
their children.
The extreme in the defect is, when parents carelessly let their children pass
the flower of their age: and never consider whether need require that they
should mary or no. Their children may sit long enough before they seek out a
match for them, unless it be brought to them: and when one is offered though
it be never so fit, yet except they may make an advantage thereof to
themselves, they will hardly yield to it. Thus they make their children to
seek out marriages for themselves, and without their consent to make them up:
or else to live in discontent, Si filij innupti feruore aetatis in
consuetudinem sornicandi inciderint, vos parents in die iudicij rationem deo
estis reddituri. Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 11.
if not in uncleanness. By the carelessness of parents in this respect are
children often made a prey to the devil: whereof at the day of judgment parents
shall give an account to God.

The extreme in the excess is, See Treat. 2. Part. 1.. 2.
when parents through a covetous desire to get great and rich matches for their
children, marie them before they be of years of discretion to like or dislike,
to know what is meet or unmeet; or able to perform even the essential duties
of marriages: seldom do such unlawful marriages prosper.

In a like excess do they offend who for outward advantages match their
children to such as by nature are unfit for marriage, to idiots, to See Treat.
2. Part. 1.. 11, 12.
idolaters, to profane persons, or they care not to whom. And if their children
like not these matches, they will do to the uttermost of their power what they
can to force them thereunto. Many mischiefs ordinarily fall out upon such
marriages, as utter dislike betwixt husband and wife, continual complaining one
of another, inquiring after divorce, or any other separation, wishing, yea
practicing one another death. To all these mischiefs do parents, the cause
thereof, make themselves accessory.

. 56. Of parents providing a stock for callings and marriages of their children.
An especial outward means whereby parents may be the better enabled to
provide fit callings and marriages for their children, is, before hand to lay up
some stock, or competent portion for their children. This is comprised under
that general provision, whereof he that is careless is counted by the Apostle
1 Timothy 5. 8.
worse then an insidell: but more expressly is it noted in these words, 2 Cor.
12. 14.
Parents ought to lay up for their children: and commended in Genesis 25. 5, 6.
Abraham's example.

While children are under their parents they have no means to lay up for
themselves: for all their service is for their parents. But in regard of the
times wherein we live, it is needful for setting up in a good calling, and for
obtaining a fit match, that children have some stock and portion. It lies
therefore upon the parents, and their duty it is to provide it.

Object. Christ forbids to lay up treasures on earth. Man. 6 19. expounded.

Answ. If the scope of that place be rightly marked, it will appear that
Christ there forbids not simply the thing it self, but

1. The mind of him that lays up: namely when it is filled full of carking,
and distrustful thoughts: fearing that in the time to come he shall not have
sufficient. To this purpose does Christ propound Gods providence over fowls
and Verse. 26, 28.
lillies.

2. The manner of laying up, when temporal things are preferred before
spiritual and heavenly: therefore he adds this precept, but lay up treasures
in heaven, etc. Uers. 20.


3. The measure, when men never think they have laid up enough: but scrape
what they can come by justly or unjustly; and spare more then needs, even
things necessary, from themselves and others, to make a great stock and
portion for their children. The word of (...). Direction for laying up portions.
treasuring up (which Christ there uses) implies an immoderate measure.

Among other needful cautions for parents to be observed in laying up for
their children, these three are especially to be noted.

1. That justly they come by that which they lay up: and lay nothing toward a
child's portion which is any way unjustly gotten; for the treasures of
wickedness profit nothing: they may Pro. 10. 2.
prove a fire to consume parents themselves, their children, their house, and
whole posterity.

2. That they covet not too much to make their children rich, and for that
purpose live meanly and basely themselves, yea and deprive themselves of many
necessaries. An egregious Eccl. 5. 12.
point of folly is this, which Solomon has much taxed.

3. That all needful duties of charity to the poor, and of justice to the
Church and commonwealth be performed, and pretext of laying up for children
hinder none of these.

. 57. Of the extremes contrary to a parents providing portions for his children.
The extremes contrary to the forenamed duty are these:

1. When parents live at the uttermost extent of their estate, and from time to
time spend all their revenues or all their gains, and so are scarce able to
make even at quarter day, or years end. What stock or portion can they lay up
for children?

2. When parents live above their estate, and spend riotously their ordinary
gains, or revenues, and for other necessary affairs are forced to run into
debt. Many are so far from helping their children in this kind, as they are
maine hinderance unto them, urging their eldest son especially who is their
heir, to be bound for them, and so lay such a burden on his back, as (to use
the common phrase) they make it crack again.

3. When parents have enough for themselves and their children, and yet so
couetously dote upon their wealth, as they will not bestow a groat to help
them in calling and marriage, but say they keep all for them. What a wretched
and foolish disposition is this, that they should still lay up more and more
for their children, and yet refuse to bestow any part thereof upon them in
their greatest need, when it might redound to their greatest benefit? God often
meets with such covetous misers, and crosses their purposes, by making
strangers to enjoy that which they greedily hoorded up.

. 58. Of parents last speech to their children.
The last duty which parents owe to their children, is, when they cease to be
parents: that is, when they are going out of this world. Their duty at that
time in general is to do what lies in them, that it may go well with their
children after their departure. Both See. 6.
the reasons which are often urged by the Holy Ghost, to stir up parents to yield
obedience to God, taken from extent of Gods blessing (in this kind of phrase,
Pro. 20. 7.
Blessed shall their children be after them) and Gods Deuteronomy. 5. 29.
promises made to that purpose do prove as much.

For the better performing of this duty, three general points, tending both
to the temporal, and also to the spiritual good of children, are to be
observed: and two particular points most tending to their temporal estate.

The three generals are these. 1. Good direction. 2. Faithful prayer. 3. A
wise choice of some friends to be as parents to them.


1. Parents on their deathbed to leave good lessons to their children.
For direction. When parents observe their time to draw near, they ought to
commend some wise and wholesome precepts unto their children, the better to
direct them in their Christian course. So did Genesis 28. 2, 4.
Isaak, and and 49. 1. etc.
Iaakob.

Ob. These Patriarchs had an extraordinary spirit of prophesying, and by
virtue thereof foretold their children things to come.

Answ. See Treat. 5.. 9.
They sustained a double person: one of a prophet, another of a father: as
prophets, they had an extraordinary spirit; as parents, they performed
ordinary duty: by their extraordinary spirit, they foretold things to come:
the ordinary duty which they performed, was to direct their children how to
carry themselves in those times to come. For their prophesies were not only
predictions, but also instructions, to direct and teach them what to do. What
they did by an extraordinary spirit in extraordinary things, we must do in
ordinary duties by the ordinary spirit of understanding and wisdom which the
Lord gives us. But the direction which Genesis 28. 2. etc.
Isaak gave to Iaakob, when he sent him to Laban, was no extraordinary
prophecy: nor that which 1 Chro 28. 9.
David, when he was old, gave to Solomon: and again, 1 King. 2. 2, 3, etc.
when he lay on his deathbed. Now these things are thus written for our
imitation. And great reason there is to imitate those holy men in these things.
For

1. The words of a dying parent are commonly most regarded: his last words do
make a deep impression ( Genesis 50. 16.
this do the brethren of Joseph press upon him.) If ever therefore there be a
time seasonable for a parent to give good instructions to his children, then is
the time when parents are clean departing from their children.

2. Thus shall a parent manifest his true affection, and earnest desire of his
childrens good: for now they cannot think that he seeks his own ease, and
profit, more then their good: as at other times some will be ready to say of
their parents instructions and admonitions, Our parents know what is good for
themselves.

That the last words of parents may be the more seasonably and Direction.
profitably delivered to their children, they must note, on the one side, what
evils their children are most prone unto, what temptations they are most
assaulted withal, what snares they are most like to fall into; and on the
other side, what virtues and graces are most needful for them, and wherein
they fail most, and accordingly they must order and frame their last words.
Note for a pattern herein Genesis 28, 2, etc.
Isaaks counsel to Iaakob, when he sent him to Laban, and thought he should
never see him again: and 1 King. 2. 2, 3.
David's to his son Solomon.

. 59. Of Parents last blessing to their children.
II. Concerning the prayers of parents for their children, I noted it. 4.
before to be a general duty never to be omitted: yet here in particular I
mention it again, because a parents blessing consists therein especially:
and then is the most proper time for parents to bestow a blessing on their
children, as Genesis 28. 3.
Isaak, and 48. 15.
Iaakob, 1 Chro. 29. 19.
David, and others did. Let parents therefore as they commend their own souls
into Gods hand, so commend their children unto Gods grace and blessing. Gods
providence is a good inheritance: many children do thereby exceedingly
prosper, though they have but small outward means; whereas others that have
great means used for their good, come to ruin; Gods curse following them. Now
no such means can be thought of to procure Gods blessing, or to withold his
curse, as the faithful prayers of parents for their children; especially when
parents are leaving their children, and going to God.

. 60. Of parents care to commend their children to some faithful friends.
III. The third general point of making choice of some faithful friends to
commend their children unto, is especially in behalf of such as are not of
sufficient age and discretion to look to themselves, or to those weighty
affairs which belong unto them. The friends, which in this case are made
choice of, ought to be such as the parents themselves by good experience have
found to be honest, wise, faithful, and loving to them and theirs; whom
parents are to set in their own place for the good of their children. This
means did David use when he was old in the behalf 1 Chro. 22. 17. and 28. 21.
of his son Solomon. Many children have found much help thereby. Such may
make a good supply of the departure of parents. These are so much the more
needful, by how much the more unstable, and unbridled youth is; and by how
much the less able children are to help and guide themselves.

. 61. Of parents neglect of their children for the time to come.
Contrary to a parents providence for the good of his children after his
departure, is the carelessness of parents for the time to come. They think the
world is gone with them when they are gone, and therefore they will take no
thought for the future times that shall be after them; as if it were enough for
every one to look to his own time. There may seem to be more self-love in
such parents then love of their children, in that their care determines with
their own time, and extends not it self to the time and continuance of
their children. Hence is it, that not a word of direction and exhortation
comes out of their mouths to their children when they are departing, no
blessing that they will leave behind them, no friends shall be deputed by
them, to be as parents to their children. Let God provide, say they. But where
there is a referring of matters to Gods providence, without the use of those
means which God has warranted and commended by his word, there can be little
hope that God should take care of that which is so commended to him. Such men
do not in faith depend upon Gods providence, but make the very name thereof a
pretext to cast off that care, which God as a bounden duty requires of them.
As there is little love of their children in such parents, so there is less
zeal of Gods glory: for a parents care of his childrens welfare, especially of
their continuing to fear and serve the Lord after their own departure out of
this world, is an especial means of preserving Gods fear in the world, and
propagating it from age to age: so as this neglect is a greater fault then many
are aware of.

. 62. Of parents making a Will before they die.
The two particular things to be observed by parents for manifestation of their
provident care over their children for the time to come, even after their
departure, especially in regard of their temporal estate, are these, 1. That
they make a will. 2. That they leave their estates to their children.


1. It has been an ancient commendable practice both among A Will to be made.
Gods people, and others also, that have been guided with common civility,
when they who have any estate, wax old, or sick, and have any occasion of
expecting death offered unto them, to make their last Will and testament. This
is set forth in the old Testament under this phrase (Put thy house in order.) A
duty it is expressly 2 King. 20. 1.
commanded by God: and that not without good reason. For

1. A parents Will is an especial means to settle peace among children after
his departure, and to make them content with that allowance which he has set
out unto them, because by the Will they know it was their fathers pleasure they
should have such and such a portion. If controversies should arise, yet a Will
is a means for the law speedily to determine the same without any tedious and
chargeable suits: for the Apostle takes it for a ruled case, that no man
disanulleth or adds any thing to a mans' testament. Gal. 3. 15.


2. After a parent has made his Will, he may the more quietly settle himself
for heavenly contemplations, and preparations to death: and think of such good
instructions as are most fit to give as his farewell to his children: and the
more willingly expect the moment of his dissolution: and the more patiently
submit himself to the very stroke of death.

In performing this duty, a man must both observe a fit time, Direction.
and also take good advice. The fit time is while his understanding is good,
and his memory perfect: so as he may call to mind his debts, what he owes,
and what is owing to him: as also what goods he has to bestow, and with
discretion and wisdom order his estate. And because through the cauils which
many unconscionable lawyers and others are like to make, his true meaning may
be perverted, it is meet to have the advice of such as can in distinct words
and phrases so express his meaning, as they shall be free from exception.
Matters of weight are wisely to be managed.

. 63. Of neglecting to make a Will.
Contrary is the daily practice of too many parents who are not willing to make
any will at all: or else on vain hope that they may live longer, and when they
are sick, upon conceit that they may recover, or at least longer continue to
enjoy the use of their understanding and memory, put off the making of their
Will till it be too late: and so die without Will, or make such a Will as
ministers more matter of suit, then if they had no Will at all; either because
doubt is made whether he that made it had his understanding and memory or no:
or because his Will is so abrupt and ambiguous, as his meaning cannot be
known. The mischiefs that follow these neglects, Inconvenience of dying
without a Will.
are many. As 1. Discredit to the party deceased. 2. Contentions among his
suruiuing children. 3. Wasting a great part, if not his whole estate, in suits
of law. 4. Defeating many creditors of their due debt.


The reason which makes many to put off the making of their Will is a foolish
conceit, that if a man's Will be once made, then he must needs die out of hand.
But what ground have men for any such conceit? If sickness grow upon a man, so
long as his Will is unmade his mind is unsettled, his mind being unsettled, the
physic that is ministered to him cannot so kindly work; so as his death may
be the more hastened for not making a Will. Besides, if his speech fail before
his understanding, the thought that then he shall die without a Will may so
perplex him, as his departure will be very unquiet and troublesome.

. 64. Of parents leaving their estate to their children when they die.
It was. 56.
before showed that parents were to lay up a portion for their children against
their entrance into a calling, and marriage: There is a further duty required
when they are going out of the world, namely that they leave their whole estate
The estate of parents to be left to their children.
to their children. (Where I say whole, I exempt not works of charity, nor
payment of debts, which is a point of justice, but I include more then is given
as portions or stocks in their life time.) That estate especially which
parents have received from their progenitors are they most bound to leave unto
their children. It is expressly recorded that Abraham gave all Genesis 25. 5.
that he had to Isaak. Gods law did provide for this among the Jews: for a man
might not sell his land to cut it off from Leu. 25. 23.
his posterity. This was it that made Naboth refuse to sell his vineyard to
Ahab, as his answer implies, God forbid that I 1 King. 21. 3.
should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee: because it was the
inheritance of his fathers, that is, he had received it from them, he thought
it unlawful to deprive his children of it. This phrase (if children, then
heirs) takes it for a granted Romans 8. 17.
truth that children have a right to their parents estate: and if they have a
right thereto, they may not be defeated thereof.

God gives wealth unto parents but for their life time: in which time they are
but as Guardians unto Gods children, and are accountable to God: so as they
have not an absolute power to do with it what they will, but according to the
directions of the great Lord and Master they must use it, reserve it, and leave
it.

For this end parents must order their manner of living according Direction.
to that portion which the Lord has appointed unto them, and by his providence
bestowed upon them; they must (as it is said in the proverb) cut their coat
according to their cloth. Of the two it is much better for parents to live
under, then above their means. Provided that they neglect no duty of charity,
or justice: nor through miserableness and niggardliness carry themselves
unbeseeming the place wherein God has set them, and estate which he has
bestowed upon them. He that lives somewhat under his means, has opportunity
to lay up portions for other children (if he have many) and to reserve his
inheritance entire to his eldest (beside many other good works of charity as
God shall offer occasion) which he that lives above his means cannot do.

. 65. Of the inconveniences which improuident parents bring their children unto
after their death.
Contrary to this branch of a parents providence, are many courses of
improuident parents: For

1. Some parents lavish and bezell out all their estate in their own life
time, making it to determine in their persons. Unworthy they are to receive any
inheritance from ancestors. Their fault is double.

1. In spending prodigally above their estate.

2. In wronging their children, and depriving them of their right: for
particular persons succeding one another are but as diverse linkes of a
continued family, which are by Gods providence added one to another: this
chain is not to be broken at any man's pleasure; but for the preservation
thereof, that which has been received of the predecessors, must be left to
the successors.

2. Others leave their estate to their children, but so encumbered with debts,
bonds, recognizances, and statutes, as their children were better be without
it, then have it. For the having it makes them live at an answerable rate, and
brings many burdens upon them: besides, the debts wherein they stand obliged
make them as Pro. 22. 7.
servants to their creditors: and in time they must be forced to sell all, or
as captives lie in prison.

3. Others though they deal not so hardly with their children, yet they deal
too hardly by peeling and polling their inheritance as much as they can: they
will not forbear to make any present gain that they can, though it tend never
so much to the prejudice and damage of their children after them: as they who
cut down all the timber and wood that they can, and take out all the heart of
their land.

4. Among these may be reckoned such parents as by mere negligence suffer
things to go to decay for want of timely reparations: whereby it comes to
pass, that such damages as in the parents time might have been prevented
with laying out a few shillings, cannot be renewed with many pounds.

5. Such also as care not in their life time to clear the titles of those
things which they leave to their children: but leave all things so unsettled and
litigious, as it often costs children more in suit of law to maintain the
inheritance which their parents leave them, then the inheritance is worth: and
yet after all their pains and cost lose the inheritance too: whereas the
parent that knew more then the child can, might with small pains and charge
have well settled and cleared all.

These are mischiefs that many children have been brought into by the
improuidence of their parents: which are the rather to be made known, that
such as come after, may prove the more provident for their children.

. 66. Of parents impartial respect to all their children.
Hitherto of parents duties. The persons to whom those duties are to be
performed, are distinctly to be considered.

The parties to whom parents are to perform all the forenamed duties are
expressed under this word (Children) which (...).
has not any special respect to prioritie of birth, to constitution of body,
to affection of parent, or any such thing, as if first borne, proper,
beautiful, darling, or the like children were only meant, but all that are
begotten and borne of parents, all their children are meant. Whence I observe,
that Parents ought to have an impartial respect to all their children, and
perform duty indifferently and equally to all. We have for proof hereof Gods
pattern, who accounts all his children dear or beloved children. The Greek
word translated (...). Ephesians. 5. 1.
dear is very emphaticall: it is properly attributed to an only child: the
seventy that translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek, do with this word
interpret that phrase, Only Son: Genesis 22. 2. (...). Hesychius (...) exponit
(...). Plutarchus dicit (...) vocari (...).
for where in Hebrew it is thus said to Abraham, take thy son, thine only
one, they thus translate it, take thy son, thy dear one, or thy beloved one.
Other Greek authors do so attribute the same word to an only child, yea also
and to an only eye: as when a man has but one eye they call it a beloved eye.
This word then shows that God so respects all his children, as if all were
but one, all a firstborn, all a darling child. So rare a virtue this
impartial respect is (rare in the excellency of it, rare also in the
scarcity of it) as thorowout the Scripture I can scarce find a perfect
pattern thereof Arist. Rhet. 1. vocat vnicum oculum (...).
among the sons of men. Many may be given of the contrary, as we shall after
hear. But the more rare it is, the more we must labor after it, that so we
may resemble Gods fatherhood.

1. All our children come from our own substance and Reasons.
bowels. Why then should we respect one child above another, more then we do
one eye, or one ear above another? We are as tender over one as over another,
though it may be we have more use of one then of another.

2. All our children are alike committed to us by God: the same precepts and
directions given for all alike: the like account to be given for all. If a King
should commit many of his children to one nurse, would not he be offended (and
that justly) if she should put such a difference betwixt them, through a
foolish partiality, as to respect some, and neglect others?

. 67. Of parents preferring a dutiful child before a disobedient child.
Object. What if one child be more pious to God and parent, another more
rebellious, may not a parent respect that more then this?

1. Answ. He may take notice of their different carriage, and accordingly
reward the one, and punish the other, and yet carry an equal desire of doing
good to both of them alike: for the punishing of the rebellious child is a
parents duty; an evidence of love, and a means of doing him good.

2. Answ. It is no partiality to like grace and goodness in a child, and for
grace and goodness sake to love his child so much the more, as also for
impiety and obstinacy in rebellion to have his heart the more alienated from
his child: this is rather a virtue in a parent. Partiality is when on by and
undue respects one child is preferred before another.

. 68. Of the prerogative of the firstborn son.
Quest. May not a parent prefer his firstborn child, and heir before his
other children?
Answ. We must put difference betwixt a fathers disposing his estate upon his
children, and the ordering of his affection toward them. A parents affection,
and care of good education, and desire of true good, and faithful prayers to
God, may be as great toward his younger children, as toward his eldest son
and heir, and yet may he bestow the greatest patrimony upon the heir: which
is no partiality.

2. Quest. Is it then just and equal that the eldest son should have a
greater patrimony then any of the rest?
Answ. It is most just and equal. For

1. God has so appointed it: yea Deuteronomy. 21. 17.
he made this to be one of the prerogatives of the firstborn, to have a
double portion. Upon this ground 1 Chr. 5. 2.
Joseph, who was the firstborn of the true wife, had a double portion; and as
a testimony thereof his posterity made two tribes.

2. The laws of all nations do order as much.

3. Our law gives the whole inheritance of freeholds to the eldest son: in
which respect it is due unto him. For in civil and temporal matters this rule
is true, we live by law. I take it to be a matter of conscience for a parent to
leave that to every child which by law is due to him. Neither is it without
good reason that the law ordains that a parents whole estate of freehold land
should descend: for

1. There is an excellency in the first borne, as is evident by Iaakobs speech
to his eldest son, Genesis 49. 3.
thou art my first borne, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the
excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power. And thereupon Exodus 13. 2.
God took the first borne as peculiar to himself.

2. Houses and families by this means are vpheld and continued from age to
age. How needful it is for the establishment of a commonwealth that families
should thus be continued, is evident both by experience to all such as have but
half an eye to see wherein the stability of a common wealth consists, and
also by the many laws which God ordained among the Jews for this purpose: as

1. That Leu. 25. 23.
no land should be quite cut off from a family.

2. That Verse. 25.
if any through poverty were forced to sell his land, the next of kin was to
buy it.

3. That Verse. 28.
if a man that had sold his land, could by no means redeem it again, at the
year of Iubilee he was to have the possession of it again.

4. That Number. 36. 8.
if daughters were heirs they should not marry out of their fathers tribe: and
this reason is given, that every man may enjoy the inheritance of his fathers.

Object. By leaving the whole inheritance to the eldest, he may be made a
Gentleman, and all the other beggars.
Answ. In this respect parents ought to be so much the more provident for their
other children, in training them up to callings, or laying up portions, or
settling other estates upon them beside the maine inheritance, or in taking
order that comp^ent portions be raised out of the inheritance of the eldest
son, ^n case God take them away before they have otherwise pro^ided for their
children.

Out of this answer may a third reason be gathered, to show that it is a
behouefull law for the commonwealth that the heir should have all the land.
For this law makes parents more careful in training up their younger sons
to sundry callings which are profitable to a commonwealth. If every child
should have a part of his fathers lands, they would all so depend thereupon, as
none of them would exercise themselves to such callings as are means of men's
maintenance.

. 69. Of parents partiality toward some children.
Contrary to the forenamed duty of a parents equal respect to all his
children, is partiality in fathers and mothers, manifested sundry ways. For

1. Many parents have their darling children, to whom so Iniquissima volucris
aquila in educanda sua prole dicitur esse. Pullorum enim alterum alis percussum
abigit: alterum solum vti suum educat. Basil. Hexaem. hom. 8.
much affection is showed, as in comparison none is showed to others. When some
are hugged in the bosom, others are neglected as if they were none of their
own, but basely borne. The unnaturalness of the eagle is noted in this kind,
that she flaps and drives out of the nest one of her young ones, and feeds
only the other as her own. From such partiality in parents proceed many
mischiefs: as these,

1. They give occasion to such as observe it, to suspect that those children
who are so little respected, are none of their own.

2. They cause envy, malice, and much contention to arise among children. When
Joseph's brethren saw that their father Genesis 37. 4.
loved him more then all them, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably
unto him.

3. They provoke God to inflict some judgment on those children that are so
cockered, and preferred before the rest: that so they may the better see their
folly.

This sin of parents partiality is so much the greater, when upon outward
respects they prefer the wicked and ungodly children before pious and
gracious children. Isaak herein much failed, for Genesis 25. 28.
he loved Esau (a Heb. 12. 16.
profane wretch) because he did eat of his Venison.

2. Other parents so set themselves to raise their house, as a^ their care is
to advance their eldest son, by education, by liberal allowance, and by
leaving all they have to him: and i^ the mean while neglect their younger
children. Though (as was noted. 68.
before) the maine inheritance may justly without show of partiality be left to
the heir, yet to be careful only for him, and to neglect the other, sauoureth
rank of partiality. It is most agreeable to natural reason, that as life is
given to all Consentaneum est rationi naturae vt aeque tribuere cuique vitam,
sic etiam viuendi facultates praestare. Basil. loc. citat.
children, so means of maintaining life should be given to all.

3. In the number of partial parents may they be reckoned, who unjustly
disinherit their first borne. For the inheritance of right belonging to them,
and they not deserving to be disinherited, assuredly it is some by respect or
other which makes parents prefer the younger before the elder: and this is
plain partiality. This kind of partiality is commonly in such parents as have
had children by several wives. Sometimes dislike of a former wife makes a
father dislike the children he has by her, and through dislike to disinherit
the heir by her. God gave the Jews an express law against this kind of Deu.
21. 15. etc.
partiality.

Sometimes again a gripulous seeking of advantage to themselves makes parents
to disinherit the right heir: as when a man after he has buried the mother of
his first borne, hearing of another woman which is of great wealth, makes suit
for her. She refuses because he has an heir of a former wife. He to remove
that block enters covenant to make the son which he has by her (if he
have any) his heir: hereupon the marriage is consummate: his second wife
brings forth a son: he for his covenant sake disinheriteth the first heir.
An unjust, and unlawful practice.

. 70. Of the causes for which the firstborn may be disinherited.
Quest. May not then a firstborn son be disinherited?
Answ. Yes, The Scripture notes two causes wherein the firstborn may be put
from the inheritance.

1. If he be illegitimate: for such an one has no good title: The son of the
bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, Genesis 21. 10.
says Sarah, and that justly. To like purpose say the sons of Gileads wife to
Iephthah, Thou shall not inherit in our fathers house, Judge. 11. 2.
for thou art the son of a strange woman. Just was that blame which Iotham
laid upon the men of Shechem for making Abimelech Judge. 9. 18.
the base son of Ierubbaal King: and just was Gods vengeance upon them for
that wrong done to Ierubbaals legitimate children.

2. If he be notoriously wicked. Thus Genesis 49. 4. 1 Chro. 5. 1.
Ruben for committing abominable incest lost his birthright.

Many particular crimes are reckoned up by the Sum. Syluest. part. 1. Tract* de
haered.
civil Lawyers, which would be too long here to recite.

. 71. Of the duty of fathers and mothers in law.
The extent of this title (Fathers) is in the last place to be Who are in place
of parents.
considered. Not only natural parents themselves, but also all that are in
their place are comprised under it. As they who are in the place of parents, 1.
By the bond of marriage. 2. By propinquity of blood. 3. By voluntary appointment.


The first sort are fathers and mothers in law: who are so reckoned either by
the marriage of parents themselves, or by the marriage of their children.

That man or woman which is married to a parent that had children before their
marriage, is in the place of a natural parent: thus Joseph was a Luke 2. 48.
father to Jesus, and Genesis 25. 1.
Keturah a mother to Isaak. So again the natural parents of that son that
has married a wife, or of that daughter that is married to an husband, are in
the place of parents to the wife of their son, and to the husband of their
daughter. Thus Exodus 18. 1.
Iethro was a father to Moses, and Ruth 3. 1.
Naomi a mother to Ruth.

All these are to account their children in law (that is, the Parents in law to
perform like duties as natural parents.
children of their husband and wife, or the wives of their sons, and the
husbands of their daughters) as their own natural children, and according to
the age and place of these children to perform the forenamed duties, and every
way to seek their good (except in such duties as after a peculiar manner
belong to natural parents, as nursing to a natural mother, leaving the
inheritance to a natural parent.)

For a pattern hereof take the forenamed examples of Joseph and Naomi. What
natural parents could do more for their own children then Joseph did for
Jesus, and Naomi for Ruth? The history notes how Joseph took care to have his
wives child Luke 2. 21, 22.
circumcised, and presented in the temple: how he Mat. 2. 14.
fled from place to place to preserve the child's life: how Luke 2. 48.
perplexed he was when he thought the child was lost: how he Uers. 51.
trained him up in his own house. The history also notes how Ruth 1. 22.
Naomi brought Ruth her sons wife into her own country, and retained her
with her self, and and 2. 22.
directed her whither to go, and and 3. 1.
what husband to have, and and 4. 16.
became a nurse to her child.

1. Marriage makes man and wife one flesh: in which respect Reasons.
they ought to have one mind, and the same affections, as mutually each to
other, so jointly to the children of each other. On which ground also the
husband and wife of a child, being one flesh with the child, ought as the
child to be respected. On this ground God counts the Saints his Ephesians. 5. 1.
(...).
dear children, because they are 2 Cor. 11. 2.
espoused to his natural son.

2. To respect the children of an husband or wife as their own, is a great
evidence of entire love to the husband and wife. And to respect the husband and
wife of a child is a great evidence of love to the child it self. If the
worlds proverb hold true (love me and love my dog) how much more true is this
Christian rule, love me and love my child: or love me and love mine husband:
or love me and love my wife.

3. This also is an especial means to kindle and preserve mutual love
betwixt man and wife, who have children of former husbands and wives: as also
betwixt parents and children.

. 72. Of the perverse carriage of fathers and mothers in law to their children.
Contrary is the carriage of most fathers and mothers in law: especially of
those who are married to husbands or to wives that had children before marriage:
so far they are from performing the forenamed duty, as rather they envy at
the prosperity of their husbands and wives children: and secretly endeavor to
hinder it in what they can: and cunningly leeke to alienate the natural
parents affection from them: whence Senecae Hippolytus.
fearful tragedies have been made, and lamentable mischiefs have followed.
What other reason can be given hereof Ovid. Metamorph. l. 15. sab. 45.
but a plain instigation of the devil, who thus labors to disunite those
whom God has joined together? For avoiding this snare note the mischiefs that
follow from thence.

1. Such parents sin against Gods ordinance: and as Eve, lean more to Satan's
suggestion then to Gods direction.

2. They alienate the hearts and affections of one from another: not only from
their children, but from themselves.

3. They provoke their children in law to contemn and despise them, and to
yield no duty unto them.

Hence note into what an hell unkind fathers and mothers in law do cast
themselves. If this were duly weighed, I think they would be otherwise minded.
But the god of this world does so blind their eyes with self-love, and with
envy, that they cannot see the mischiefs whereinto they implunge themselves.

This is a point the more to be weighed, because the fault here taxed is so
common, and has in all ages been too common. Lurida terribiles miscent
aconita nouercae. Ovid. Metam. l. 1. fab. 4.
What grievous complaints have in former times been made, and still are made
by children against fathers and mothers in law? Whence also direful
imprecations have followed. Let widowers and widows that have children
seriously think of it before hand: and be the more circumspect in taking a
second or third husband or wife: and after they are married let them take heed
of Satan's snares: and let conscience of duty more prevail with them, then
corruption of nature.

. 73. Of the faults of parents to their childrens husbands and wives.
Many parents to the husbands and wives of their children do also much
transgress and swerve from their duty: for

1. They will show much more respect to their own children then to the
children of their husbands or wives: as by coming to their daughters when
their husbands are abroad, and never but then: and sending for their sons to
their house, but not for their wives.

2. In all differences they will take part with their own children, though it
be in the worse part, and show great partiality.

3. They will often give very ill counsel: aduising their sons to keep their
wives short: aduising their daughters not to be too subject to their husbands,
yea privily to purloine from their husbands.

4. If they live with their children, they will so pry into every thing that
their childrens husband or wife does, and show such suspicion and iealously in
every thing, as they cannot but cause much discord: and hence it often comes to
pass, that either parent and child, or husband and wife must be parted: they
cannot all in peace live together.

These faults I thus note, that they may the more carefully be avoided.

. 74. Of their duty who are in stead of parents to Orphants.
The next sort of those who are in stead of parents, are those who in blood and
kindred are next to parents: as grandfathers, grand-mothers, uncles, aunts,
elder brothers, or sisters, their husbands or wives, and cosins.

These commonly are counted to be in the place of parents, The next of kin to
Orphants to be as natural parents.
when God takes away natural and immediate parents from their children: so as
they are parents to Orphants.

The duties which were prescribed to natural parents appertain to them
(except. 71.
before excepted.) Their duty is to see these Orphants well educated, well
placed in some good calling, well married, and (if the Orphants be left
destitute of means) well provided for.

Mordecai is a worthy president and pattern for this kind of parents. Est. 2.
7.
He brought up Esther his uncles daughter (for she had neither father nor
mother) he took her for his own daughter: when she was taken from him, Verse.
11.
he went to know how she did, and what should become of her: and Verse. 20, 22.
Chap. 4. verse. 13.
he gave her advice from time to time how to carry her self. Let such as are
parents to Orphants take this example as a direction, and as a motive to
perform the other duties prescribed to natural parents as need requires, and
occasion is offered.

God by his providence taking away natural parents commits their Orphants
as a charge to the next of kin: that as their natural parents brought them
forth, these should bring them up: therefore for their recompense let them
look to God, (who takes upon himself to be Psalm. 68. 5.
a father of the fatherless) and for their encouragement remember the reward
which Mordecai received of the Lord: yea also let them remember the blessing
that God bestowed upon Esther. God does often so bless the means used for the
education of Orphants, as they who take the care thereof have no cause to
repent their pains and cost, but rather have much matter of comfort, joy and
thanksgiving.

. 75. Of the common neglect of Orphants.
Too too common is the contrary disposition of most kinsmen, and kinswomen;
they think they are bound to none but their own children, and if they have no
children, to none at all. Many are of Ruths kinsmans mind, they fear to mar
Ruth 4. 6.
their own inheritance. Though they be themselves exceeding rich, and spend
much in apparel, pastimes and housekeeping, yet they can suffer the Orphants
of their poor kindred to want, and to beg for need.

This is it that makes the loss of natural parents to be so much the
greater. And herein many Christians are more inhumane then the heathen: which
the Apostle implies, where he faith, they are worse then infidels: for
Orphants next of kin 1 Timothy 5. 8.
are to be reckoned among those whom the Apostle terms a man's (...).
OWN.

. 76. Of the duty of Guardians.
The last sort of those who are in place of parents, are such as have the
charge of children committed to them by voluntary appointment of parents, or
are chosen by children themselves, or by the magistrate when parents are dead,
or lunatike, or any other way impotent, and unable to train up their own
children.

Of these care and conscience is rather required, then cost and charges: for
commonly both their charges are allowed, and their pains recompensed.

They who by reason of the death or impotency of natural parents have the
charge of children committed to them, are commonly called Guardians: of whom
two general duties are required.

1. That they look to their Pupils good education. 2. That they preserve their
patrimony and inheritance.
For their education, the directions given before to natural parents are to be
observed by them.

For preservation of their patrimony, they must do for their Pupils what they
would do for their own children; and so carry themselves, as with good
conscience they may give that account to their Pupils, or any other, which the
law requires.

The two forenamed duties, are the rhaine ends for which Guardians are chosen:
in performing whereof, if they be faithful, great redress will be made of the
untimely death of parents; and notwithstanding parents die before their
children be of discretion to manage their estate, yet will their houses and
families be maintained, and young heirs kept from cunnie-catchers and cheaters.

It is noted of John, who had the mother of Jesus commended Ioh. 19. 27.
to him, that he took her to his own home: whereby is implied his provident
care for her good.

. 77. Of the fraud of Guardians.
Contrary is the practice of most Guardians, who take Pupils Tutela ad
vtilitatem eorum qui commissi sunt, non ad little quibus commissa, gerenda est.
Cic. Offic. l. 1.
for their own advantage, and make a prey of them. The heathen could say, that
Guardianship is to be performed for the benefit of the Pupil, and not of the
Guardian. Yet among Christians is the forenamed fault of Guardians.

1. There are few children (that have not natural parents to look to their
good education) but are exceedingly neglected therein, and brought up very
rudely and licentiously: yea many times too sparingly and ^iggardly for diet,
apparel, and other needful things, though they have sufficient to discharge
all that shall be laid out upon them.

2. The maine estate and patrimony of many Pupils is much impaired: and if
they have lands, as much waste is made upon them as possibly can be: and when a
reckoning is to be given, it shall be a large, unjust, and most unconscionable
reckoning of the Guardian can but get a general release, it is all that the
caueth for.

3. Marriages are after a for forced upon many Pupils: and such matches put upon
them as they cannot like; yea such as are no way fit for them, neither for
estate, nor years, nor proportion of body, nor qualities of mind.

Little do these Guardians think of that account where unto they shall be
brought an other day before the Lord, who styles himself the Psalm. 10. 14.
helper of the fatherless, and who beholds mischief to requite it.
Fearful is that judgment which the Lord has Exo. 22. 22, etc.
threatened against those that oppress the fatherless. Let not therefore
unjust Guardians think, that the gain they get wrongfully from their Pupils
shall prosper: but rather let them look for Gods curse upon their own
children, and goods.

If such as parents themselves have upon their deathbeds committed their
children unto, in confidence of their faithfulness, shall deal deceitfully
with their Pupils, their sin is doubled, and trebled. For 1. They violate the
bond of friendship, faithfulness, and trust reposed upon them. 2. They sin
directly against justice. 3. Most monstrously they transgress the rules of
charity.


. 78. Of the duty of Schoolemasters and Tutors.
Among those who are by voluntary appointment set in the place of parents, are
Schoolemasters and Tutors to be reckoned. The authority and charge of a parent
is for a time committed to them: therefore for that time they ought to perform
a parents duty.

Their duty is appropriated to education: it appertains not to them to
maintain the children committed to them: they are rather themselves by their
pains that way maintained.

All the duties which were before comprised under nurture, belong to
Schoolemasters and Tutors. More particularly they are to instruct children in
three things. 1. In learning. 2. In civility, and good manners. 3. In true
piety, and religion.


I shall not need to speak more of these points then has. 28, 34.
before been delivered: only to provoke them to be diligent in well nurturing
children in those three points, let the benefit of good Schoolemasters and
Tutors be well noted.

Schoolemasters commonly cast the first seed into the hearts of The benefit of
a good Schoolmaster.
children: they first season them: as the seed is, such will the crop be: as
the first seasoning is, so will the savor continue to be. If they sow no good
seed at all, what harvest can be looked for? If they sow a corrupt seed of
rudeness, licentiousness, profaneness, superstition, and any wickedness,
the crop must needs be answerable thereto. But if they sow the good seed of
learning, civility, and piety, there is great hope of a good crop.

Hence it follows that they are of great use, and may bring much good, not
only to the children themselves, and their parents, Scholas and phrontisteria
virorum and mulierum philosophiae ethnicae addictorum constru^ it. Nicep. eccl.
hist. l. 10. c. 21. The benefit of a good Tutor.
but also to the Church and Commonwealth. Julian the Apostat was not ignorant
hereof: and therefore endeavoring to root Christianity out of the world, he
suffered no man that professed himself a Christian, to teach a school: but in
stead of Christian Schoolemasters, he set up in every part of his dominions,
heathenish Schoolemasters.

Tutors, to whose government young scholars, that are sent to the
Universities, are committed, have to deal with children in their riper years;
even when the time of settling them in a course is come: the very time wherein
much good may be done to children, or else wherein they may be utterly
perverted. There will be little hope of bowing them, and drawing them into
another course after they be freed from the government of a Tutor. Tutors
therefore, as they have need of great wisdom, so of good conscience, that they
may have the greater care of their Pupils, and take the greater pains in
teaching them the three forenamed points, learning, civility, and piety. A
good Tutor may do much to repair the negligence, and amend the defects of a
Schoolmaster: but there remain none to redress the failings of a Tutor:
children for the most part are past redressing, when they cease to have a Tutor.

. 79. Of the negligence of Schoolemasters and Tutors.
The vices contrary to the forenamed duty of Schoolemasters, are these.

1. Unskilfulnesse. Many that are more fit to be taught then to teach, take
upon them this weighty calling. Some have not sufficient learning: some again
are rude, and know not themselves good manners: and some know not the first
principles of the oracles of God. No good can be expected from these.

2. Covetousness. All that many seek, is to multiply the number of their
scholars, and to get as much as they can for boording, and teaching: they aim
more at their own gain then at their scholars profit. Children are not like
to thrive well under them.

3. Negligence. Many are loath to take the pains of a Schoolmaster, and
thereupon come as little into the school as they can: take every small
occasion to be gone again: care not how much their children play: if they be
able to hire a poor Usher, all the burden shall be cast upon him. Little is
that fruit that can be looked for from them.

4. Want of piety. Many skillful and painful Schoolemasters, under whose
teaching children come forward exceeding well in learning, think it nothing
appertains to them to teach the grounds of religion, so as they altogether
neglect piety. Assuredly they want it themselves: for were their own hearts
seasoned with true piety, their consciences would move them to teach it to
their children. The things of the kingdom of God are like unto ^eauen, which
seasoneth the whole batch of dough with that season and savor which it self
has. When children spend almost all their time with their Schoolemasters, of
whom should they learn it, if not of them? What blessing can be hoped from the
pains of such Schoolemasters?

I might to these add the overmuch remissness of some (whereby children get
too great an head) and the too great severity of others, either in frequencie
of correcting, as if they delighted therein; or in the measure thereof, as if
they had to do with beasts, whereby they affright children, make them dull,
yea and impudent also. But these extremes were. 48, 49.
before handled.

The common fault of Tutors is altogether to neglect their Pupils. Many think
a Tutor to be a meeretitular matter: no more to be required of them but to
bear the very name; and to undertake that the College be discharged for their
Pupils diet. This conceit, and the practice answerable thereunto, is the
blemish and bane of the Universities. Many children well trained up in
schools, utterly lose the benefit of all their former education when they are
sent to the University, because their Tutors altogether leave them to
themselves: and so they are made a prey to idle and lewd companions. By reason
hereof many parents are utterly discouraged to send their children to the
University.

The seventh Treatise. Duties of Servants.
. 1. A Resolution of the Apostles direction to Servants.
EPHESIANS. 6. 5. Servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart, as unto
Christ. 6. Not with eie-seruice, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. 7. With good will doing service,
as to the Lord, and not to men. 8. Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man
does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
THe third and last couple of a family are -- Masters. Servants.

The direction which the Apostle gives to servants, is in this text set down.

Therein he 1. Declares their duties. 2. Adds motives to perform them.

I. In declaring servants duties he notes -- 1. The kinds of them. 2. The
manner 3. The extent

1. The kinds of servants duties are noted in two words, -- Obey, verse. 5.
Serve, verse. 7.

2. The manner is set down Affirmatively, verse. 5, 7. Negatiuely, verse. 6, 7.

1. Affirmatively by showing what graces are requisite: to which purpose he
reckons up four particulars. 1. Fear and trembling. 2. Singleness of
heart. 3. Conscience to Christ.


4. Good will. Under which are comprised -- 1. Cheerfulness. 2. Readiness. 3.
Diligence. 4. Faithfulness.

2. Negatiuely, by showing what vices are to be avoided, and these are two
especially,

1. Eie-seruice, which is opposed to doing of things -- as Christ's servants.
from the heart.

2. Men-pleasing, which is opposed to doing the will of God.

3. The extent of servants duties is noted in these four phrases, -- 1.
Masters after the flesh, verse. 5. 2. As to Christ, verse. 5. 3. As servants of
Christ, verse. 6. 4. Doing Gods will, verse. 6.

II. The motives which the Apostle uses are partly -- Implied. Expressed.

They are implied three ways. 1. By declaring the place of a Master (as to
Christ.) 2. By noting out the honor of their service (as servants of Christ.)
3. By showing the ground of servants subjection (Gods will.)


The motive expressed is the Recompense which seruans shall have for their
pains largely laid forth, verse. 8.

Therein these distinct points are noted in order. 1. The assurance thereof
(knowing.) 2. The ground thereof, taken from a general rule (whatsoever good
thing any man does.) 3. The particular application thereof (whether bond or
free.) 4. The kind thereof (the same shall he receive.) 5. The author and
giver thereof (of the Lord.)


. 2. Of the lawfulness of a masters place and power.
In handling servants duties I will proceed according to the order propounded.
In the first place therefore I will note out the kinds of servants duties.

For finding out the kinds, I will observe the method followed in handling
childrens duties. Note then 1. The Fountain of servants duties. 2. The
Streams that issue from thence.


The Fountain rests partly in the opinion, and partly in the affection of
servants.

In their Opinion they must be informed and resolved that the Servants must be
informed of the lawfulness of a masters authority.
place of a master and a servant is lawful and warrantable: that God
ingenerall ordained degrees of superiority and inferioritie, of authority and
subjection: and in particular gave to masters the authority which they have,
and put servants in that subjection wherein they are. Till the judgment be
resolved hereof, nor reverence, nor obedience will be yielded as it ought. For
Reverence has reference to Eminency and superiority: and Obedience to
Authority and power. Who will reverence or obey him whom he takes to be his
equal? This was the ground of the conspiracy of Corah, Dathan and Abiram,
that they thought Numb. 16. 3.
Moses and Aaron took too much upon them, and lift themselves up above the
congregation of the Lord. Wherefore I will here note the grounds of a masters
authority, and servants subjection. Grounds of masters and servants places.


1. God has given express commandment unto masters to govern their
servants: and unto servants to be subject to their masters. Exo. 20. 10.
In the fourth commandment God gives a charge to masters over their servants,
to see that they do no manner of work. And the Angel bids Hagar Genesis 16.
9.
humble her self under her mistress hands. And here servants are commanded to
obey their masters.

2. Many directions are given both to masters and servants in regard of their
different places how to carry themselves one to another. Read for this purpose
the many laws which Moses prescribed to both: the many counsels which Solomon,
in his proverbs especially, gives also to both: and particularly the
directions of this and other Apostles.

3. Saints in all ages have been set in these places: some in the places of
masters, and some in the places of servants: and according to the place wherein
God has set them, they have performed their duty: masters the duties of
masters, and servants the duties of servants.

4. The many parables which Christ uses taken from the power which masters
have and exercise over their servants, and the subjection which servants yield
to their masters, show that the authority of the one, and subjection of the
other, are things without question granted and not denied.

5. God has made many promises of reward both to masters, and servants, that
conscionably perform the duties of their place: and has made many threatenings
against the one and the other that are negligent therein.

All these grounds are so clearly and plentifully noted in the Scripture, that
any one who is any whit acquainted therewith may know them to be so. Were there
no other arguments then this text which I have in hand, it were enough to
confound all gainsaiers: and to move such as believe the rather Serui cum
crediderint plus dominis carnalibus seruire debent. Cypr. Testim. l. 3. c. 72
See Treat. 1.. 123.
for their faith and profession sake to serve their masters after the flesh.

. 3 Of the Anabaptists arguments against the authority of masters, and
subjection of servants.
Contrary to this first ground of servants subjection is the opinion of
Anabaptists, who teach that all are alike, and that there is no difference
betwixt masters and servants. Their reasons, whereby they would make show to
prove their unreasonable opinion, are these.

1. Object. Masters are either Infidels or Christians, and so servants either
one or other. If masters be Infidels, and servants Christians, how unmeet is it
that Christians should be subject to Infidels? and if master and servant be
both Christians, they are brothers: but brothers are equals, and neither
subject to other.

Answ. Rule and subjection are matters of outward policy, they tend to the
outward preservation of Church, Commonwealth, and family, in this world: but
faith, piety, and such graces are inward matters of the soul, tending to a
better life.

These being thus different, one that is more excellent in the one, may be
inferior in the other. Yea though there be an equality in the one, namely, in
spiritual things, yet there may be a disparity in the other, namely, in civil
and temporal matters. And though Saints may be far inferior to infidels in
outward estate, yet they are not a whit the less glorious before God. The
honor proper and peculiar to Saints is inward, not visible to the carnal eye
of a natural man.

2. Object. It is against nature for one to be servant, especially a
bond-seruant to another. Prima seruitutis causa peccatum est, etc. Verum and
poenalis seruitus ea lege ordinatur, qua naturalem ordinem conseruari iubet,
etc. Aug. de Ciu. Dei l. 19. c. 15.

Answ. To grant that it is against that absolute and perfect nature wherein at
first God created man, and that it came in by sin, yet is it not against that
order and course of nature wherein God has now settled man. God has turned
many punishments of sin to be bounden duties; as subjection of wife to
husband, and man's eating bread in the sweat of his brow.

3. Object. It is the prerogative of Christians to be Gal. 3. 28.
all one: but subjection of servants to masters is against that prerogative.
Answ. That prerogative is merely spiritual: for in Christ all are one, as
they are members of Christ, which is a spiritual body: not as they are members
of a politic body. A politipue inequality is not against a spiritual
equality.

4. Object. This subjection is against the Gal. 5. 1.
liberty that Christ has purchased for us, and wherewith he has made us free.
Answ. It is not. For that liberty is from the curse and rigor of the moral
law: from the ceremonial law and the rites thereof: from Satan, sin, death,
and damnation: but not from those degrees which God has established betwixt
man and man, for the good of mankind.

5. Object. We are expressly forbidden to be 1 Cor. 7. 23.
servants of men.
Answ. To be a servant in that place is not simply to be in subjection See
Treat. 1.. 124, 125, 126.
under another, and to do service unto him, but to be so obsequious to a man,
so addicted to please him, and so subject to his will, as to do whatsoever he
will have done: to regard nothing but his pleasure: to prefer it before Gods
word and will. It is not therefore the thing it self, but an excess therein
which is there forbidden.

. 4. Of a servants fear of his master.
The other part of that fountain, from whence the duties Servants ought to
fear their masters.
of servants flow, rests in the affection: and it is in one word Fear: which
is an awful dread of a master. An awe in regard of his masters place: a dread
in regard of his masters power. An awe is such a reverend esteem of his
master, as makes him account his master worthy of all honor: which 1 Timothy 6.
1.
S. Paul expressly inioyneth servants to do. A dread is such a fear of
provoking his masters wrath, as makes him think and cast every way how to
please him. This is it which the Apostle here intimates under these two words,
fear and trembling. In both these respects S. Peter commands servants to be
subject in all fear. 1 Pet. 2. 18.


So proper is this fear to a servant in relation to his master, as where it is
wanting, there is a plain denial of his masters place and power; which God
intimates under this expostulation, If I be a master, where is my fear? that
is, you plainly Mal. 1. 6.
show that you account me not your master, because in your heart there is no
fear of me.

This fear will draw servants on, cheerfully to perform all duty: the more
it abounds, the more desire and endeavor there will be to please, and to give
good contentment (and this is a point commanded to servants, to please well in
all things:) Tit. 2. 9.
yea it will glad the heart of a servant to see his service prosper well:
hereof we have a worthy pattern in Abraham's servant, Genesis 24.
whose care to do his business, as his master would have it, and prayer for
Gods assistance therein, and thanks for Gods blessing thereon, shows an
awefull respect which he bare to his master.

Again, on the other side, this fear will keep men from of fending their
masters (which was one reason that moved Joseph not to yield to his mistress)
and in this respect it may Genesis 39. 8.
prevent many mischiefs which their masters offense and wrath might bring upon
them.

One especial means to breed and preserve this fear in servants, is, a due
consideration of the ground of their masters Direction.
place and power: which is Gods appointment: God has placed them in his stead,
and in part given them his power: they are the Deputies and Ministers of God,
and therefore in Scripture the title ( (...) Genesis 24. 9. (...). Ephesians. 6. 5.
Lord) is after a peculiar manner given to them. What makes subjects stand in
awe of inferior Magistrates? Is it not because they bear the Kings person,
and have authority and power given unto them of the King?

. 5. Of the extremes contrary to servants fear of their masters.
Two extremes are contrary to this seruant-like fear.

1. In the excess a slavish fear: when they fear nothing but Slavish fear
in servants.
the revenging power of their master: the staff or the cudgel, as we speak:
so they may avoid that, they care not whither their master be pleased or no.
This makes them often to wish that their masters had no power over them: or that
they were dead. This was that fear which possessed the heart of that
unprofitable servant, who said to his master, I knew thee that Mat. 25. 24, 25.
thou art an hard man, and I was afraid. Such servile servants will never be
profitable.

2. In the defect, a light esteem and plain contempt of Servants despising
their masters. Mal. 1. 6.
masters. That this is contrary to fear is evident by that opposition which
God makes betwixt them in these words, If I be a master, where is my fear, o
ye that despise my name? As if he had said; Hereby ye show that ye fear me not
as a master, because ye despise me. This sin of despising masters is expressly
1 Timothy 6. 2.
forbidden: and for it was Genesis 16. 6.
Hagar dealt hardly withal. When masters are poor, mean, weak, aged, or
otherwise impotent, then proud servants are prone to despise them: which
argues a base mind, showing that they respect their masters power more then
his place: the poorest and weakest have the same place and authority over
servants, that the richest and strongest have; all bear Gods image alike: but
disdainful proud servants show that they regard not Gods image at all.

. 6. Of servants reverence in speech.
The two maine streams which issue out of the forenamed fountain, are --
Reverence. Obedience.

Reverence is manifested in Speech. Carriage.

In Speech by Refraining Speech. Well ordering

Servants reverence in refraining speech is manifested 3. ways.

1. By sparing to speak, without just cause in their masters presence or
audience: This phrase ( 1 King. 10. 8.
they stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom) spoken of Salomons
servants, shows that they were slow to speak and swift to hear in their
masters presence.

2. By forbearing to reply when they observe their masters unwilling that they
should speak any more. Thus did Peter forbear when his master gave him this
short answer, John 21. 22.
What is that to thee?

3. By attending to that which their masters shall deliver to them: for
servants ought to show such a respect to their masters speaking to them, as
Samuel did to God, when he said, 1 Samuel 3. 10.
Speak for thy servant hears. The titles of Lord and Servant do show, that
this speech is taken from the duty of servants. The notation of the (...). See
Treat. 1.. 96, 124.
Greek word used by the Apostle, and translated Obey, implies as much. This
reverence did Abraham's Genesis 24. 9.
servant show to his master, when he gave him a charge about choosing a wife
for his son.

Servants for well ordering their speech unto their masters must observe five
cautions.

1. That they have just occasion to speak: and that is either when their
masters require them to speak (as Mat. 16. 14.
the disciples) or when they see it behouefull for their masters that they
should speak. In such cases speech argues reverence, as well as silence in
other cases. The general points which were before delivered of the reverence
of Treat. 3.. 13.
wives to their husbands, and of Treat. 5.. 4. 5. etc.
children to their parents, may be applied to servants: and pressed upon them
as an argument from the less to the greater thus, If wives (who in many things
have a joint authority with their husbands) and children (who are not in so
servile a degree subject to their parents, as servants to their masters) must
manifest their inward fear of their husbands and parents by outward reverence,
much more must servants to their masters. To declare the force of this
consequence so much the more, let it be noted that the Apostle adds another
kind When behouefull for servants to speak to masters.
of word here, then he did before, either in wives or childrens duties, namely
See Treat. 1.. 124.
trembling.

Quest. In what cases may it be behouefull for masters that their servants
speak to them?
Answ. 1. When they know any thing that may be profitable for their masters,
they ought to declare it, though they be not asked: as 2 King. 5. 3.
that maid which told her mistress Naamans wife, that there was a Prophet in
Samaria that could deliver him of his leprosy.

2. When masters through ignorance, passion, or such like cause, refuse to do
that which their servants know to be good for them, they ought to persuade
their masters to do it; as Naamans servants persuaded their master to wash
himself in 2 King. 5. 13.
Jordan as the Prophet advised him.

3. When servants are not fully instructed in those things which they ought to
do for their master, they ought to ask of him what is to be done, as the
disciples who said to their master, where will thou that we prepare for thee to
eat the Mat. 26. 17.
passover?

4. When some scruple arises in their minds about any charge that their master
shall give them, they may inquire of their master, as Abraham's servant when he
said, what if the woman Genesis 24. 5.
will not come with me?

5. When their master unjustly suspecteth any evil of them, they may speak to
clear their own innocence, as David 1 Samuel 24. 10.
did to Saul.

A second caution for servants well ordering their speech is, Directions for
servants well framing their speech to masters.


That the very form and manner of their speech when they have just occasion to
speak to their masters, do savor of reverence: for which purpose let these
particulars be noted.

1. That servants give reverend titles to their masters.

It was in an honorable respect of their master that the servants of Naaman,
called him Father. In Scripture. 4.
one of 2 King. 5. 13.
Gods titles is attributed to masters, as Lord.

2. That their words be few, no more then must needs, even when they have
occasion to speak: as may be gathered out of the forenamed examples alleged
to show when servants might and ought to speak.

3. That all their words spoken to their master be meek, mild and humble:
note for this purpose how the children of the Prophets framed their speech to
their master. 2 King. 6. 2. etc.


1. They humbly beg leave for themselves to go to Jorden.

2. They entreat him to go, in these words, vouchsafe I pray thee to go with
thy servants.

3. When one of them had lost the head of his hatchet, as if he durst not be so
bold as to speak to his master to get it him again, he refers the thing to
his good pleasure, saying, Alas master it was but borrowed.

A third caution is,

That they observe a fit season to speak to their master: as when he is at
leisure to hear them: (thus it is noted of the disciples that when their
master was alone they propounded their questions unto him) or when his mind is
quiet, not Mar. 4. 10.
troubled with passion (thus when David observed that Saul's mind was somewhat
pacified toward him, by that speech he used, Is this thy voice my son David,
then he took occasion more freely to speak to him.) 1 Samuel 26. 17.


A fourth caution is,

That they give a ready and present answer to their master. This is often
commended in Peter, that when Christ propounded any question to his disciples,
he would presently and Mat. 16. 16. Ioh. 6. 68.
readily answer.

A fifth caution is,

That all their speeches and answers to their master be true, not daring to
tell a lie unto them: this argues a very reverend respect of a master. When
Eli demanded of Samuel what the Lord had said to him, Samuel told him every
whit and hid nothing from him. And when David bid the woman of Tekoah 1 Samuel 3.
18. 2 Samuel 14. 18, 19.
not to hide the thing that he should ask her from him, she told him the whole
truth. There is a double bond to tie servants hereunto.

1. Their conscience toward God, who is a God of truth. 2. Their respect to
their masters with whom they ought to deal faithfully.
Lastly, a servants reverence ought to be manifested by his speech of his
master even behind his back: speaking good of him, and no evil: this part of
reverence also did Abraham's servant show to his master. Thus shall they show
themselves Genesis 24. 35, etc.
good, true-hearted, faithful servants, and not parasites.

. 7. Of the vices contrary to a servants reverence in speech.
Offenses contrary to the forenamed Reverence of servants to their masters are
these.

1. Sauciness and boldness in servants when they have no more respect to
their masters presence then to any others, but are full of prate, and loud in
speech before their master, or in the room next to him, where they may be
heard as well as if they were in the same room: much offense is thus often times
given to masters.

2. Importunity in speaking, and replying again and again, though their
masters do not only show their dislike thereof, but also expressly charge them
to speak no more. Scolding maids that will have the last words of their
mistress much offend herein. This is directly against the Apostles prohibition
to servants, that they answer not again. Tit. 2. 9.


3. Impatiency, when they cannot endure to hear their master make an end of
his speech, but either they will interrupt him, or fling away.

4. Stoutnesse, when (as Solomon notes) though they understand, Pro. 29. 19.
they will not speak: though they know very well that it is their masters
pleasure they should speak, yea though they are bidden to speak, yet their
stout stomach, and sullen heart will not suffer them to speak: no though it be
never so behouefull for their masters: if they know that their master goes on
in a course very prejudicial to him, yet will not they tell him of it: nay if
their master unjustly suspect any evil of them, they will let him abide in
that iealously rather then speak to clear themselves: and if their master do
not expressly appoint them from time to time what to do, they will never ask:
nor if they be doubtful of that which he gives them in charge, will they
further inquire to be resolved thereof. This kind of silence, in these and
such like cases, argues more doggednesse then dutifulness.

5. Disdain, when they See. 5.
scorn to give the title Master to him that is set over them, because he is a
poor and mean man.

6. Arrogance, when their words are high and lofty against their master,
pretending that they are as good as he, though for a time they be under him.
Clerks, prentises, waiting women, and such like, being borne of gentlemen, and
men of good degree, are for the most part guilty of this fault: the reason is,
because their birth and parentage makes them forget their present place and
condition; or else (which is worse) makes them wilfully presume above it.

7. Muttering and murmuring upon every occasion of discontent: whereby it
comes to pass that they often provoke much wrath (for grievous words stir up
anger.) Pro. 15. 1.


8. Unseasonable interruption of their master: speaking to him when he is
seriously occupied in some weighty business (as they who told Christ of his
mother and brethren when he was preaching) or unseasonably speaking unto him
while he Mar. 3. 32.
is in passion, whereby they often bring much mischief upon themselves.

9. Answering their master at their own leisure, suffering him to call, and
call again and again. This does Job complain of, saying, I called my servant
and he gave me no answer. Job 19. 16.


10. Flapping their master in the mouth with a lie: like Gehazi, who, when he
had lewdly fetched money and apparel of Naaman, and his master asked him where
he had been, said with a fair face, Thy servant went no whither. Let the
judgment 2 King. 5. 25.
executed on him make all servants take heed of the like sin. For Lying is in
it self an heinous sin: yet so much the more heinous when it is told to one
that has authority over us, and by reason thereof stands in Gods place.

Lastly, Evil language of their master behind his back. This is a sin,
though that which is spoken to a masters disgrace be true: for the infirmities
of a master ought rather to be covered, then revealed and laid open by a
servant. How monstrous a sin is it then, to raise slanderous reports against
a master which are untrue? This was Zibas sin against Mephibosheth his
master. 2 Samuel 16. 3.


Hitherto of servants Reverence in speech to their masters.

Their Reverence in carriage follows.

. 8. Of servants reverend behavior to their masters.
For manifestation of a servants reverence in carriage toward his master, three
things are especially required. 1. Dutiful obeisance. 2. Respectfull
behavior. 3. Modest apparel.


I. Such dutiful and submissiue obeisance and courtesy, as beseems their sex
and place, and that according to the most usual 1. Servants obeisance to their
masters.
custom of the country and place where they are, must servants perform to
their masters, as they have occasion to go to them, to come from them, to
receive any charge of them, or to bring any message unto them. Where Isaak
says in his blessing given to Iaakob, Be lord over thy brethren, and let thy
mothers sons bow Genesis 27. 29.
down to thee, by that phrase of bowing down, he notes the condition of a
servant, and withal implies a servants duty: on this ground, when the
children of the Prophets saw that the spirit of Eliah rested on Elisha, they
taking it for an evident sign that God had made him a governor and master
over them, they came to 2 King. 2. 15.
meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.

II. Answerable to a servants obeisance must be his whole behavior 2. Servants
dutiful behavior before their masters.
before his master, seasoned and ordered with such modesty and humility, as
may manifest an honorable respect to his master: as

1. To stand in his masters presence; which testifies a readiness to perform
any service which his master shall appoint him to do: this was one thing
noted, and commended by the Queen of Sheba in Solomon's servants: she saw their
1 King. 10. 5, 8.
standing, and said, happy are these thy servants that stand before thee.
Whereas it is said that she saw also their sitting, that phrase shows a
seemly order which they observed even when they were out of his presence, by
giving and taking their right and due place.

2. By uncovering their heads in their masters presence: this in our days, and
in the parts of the world where we dwell, is in the male kind a sign and
token of subjection.

3. By sobriety and modesty both in countenance, and in the whole disposition
of body, especially when servants are in their masters presence: for to
compose countenance and whole body soberly, because of the presence of one,
argues a reverend respect of that person, for whose sake that sobriety is
showed.

III. The apparel also which servants wear must be so fashioned 3. Servants
seemly apparel.
and ordered, as it may declare them to be servants, and under their masters,
and so it will argue a reverend respect of their masters. One end of apparel,
is to show a difference betwixt superiors and inferiors, persons in
authority and under subjection. It pleased the Holy Ghost to note this
particular (and their 1. King. 10. 5.
apparel) as an obseruable point in Solomon's servants.

. 9. Of the faults of servants contrary to reverence in carriage.
The carriage of many servants toward their master is clean contrary to the
forenamed reverence. For

1. Some through rudeness, and want of good bringing up, 1. Rudeness.
come to their masters, and go from them, as to and from their fellows: no
testimony of reverence by any obeisance: they know not how to give it: whereby
they dishonor their parents, and manner of education.

2. Others, if at first coming to their master they give some 2. Too much
familiarity.
salutation, yet, through too much familiarity with them, all the day after
they will carry themselves fellow-like, scarce uncovering their heads in their
masters presence, not enduring to stand long before him, but either setting
themselves down, or slinking away when they should be in presence. Doubtless
from this overmuch familiarity arose this proverb, Good morrow for all day.
This unmannerly familiarity is commonly in such servants, as have poor and
mean masters: for rich and great men's servants can be so full of courtesy, as
not a word shall be spoken by their masters to them, or by them to their
masters, but the knee shall be bowed withal: they can stand hour after hour
before their masters, and not once put on their hat: if they be walking after
their masters, their master shall not turn sooner then their hat will be off,
and that so often as he turns or speaks to them. Why should rich masters have
so much reverence showed to them, and poor masters none at all? Do not the
poor bear Gods image as well as the rich? Does Gods word make any difference
betwixt rich and poor? Does it say, Serve rich masters with fear and
trembling? Surely it is the corruption of man's heart, which makes this
difference. Servants naturally more regard their masters outward ability, then
inward authority: the honor which the world conferreth on men, more then the
honor which God conferreth: for God has given as much honor and authority
to a poor master as to a rich, in that he is a master.

Servants commonly most fail in this duty of reverence toward their masters
there where they should most of all show it, namely, in the courts of God, and
assembly of Gods people, where the very Angels are present to behold our seemly
carriage: thus they cause the ministry of the word to be evil spoken of, and
thereby make their sin so much the more heinous.

3. Exceeding great is the fault of servants in their excess in apparel. 3.
Pride.
No distinction ordinarily betwixt a man's children and servants: nay none
betwixt masters and their men, mistresses and their maids. It may be while men
and maids are at their masters and mistresses finding, difference may be made:
though even then also, if they can any way get wherewithal, they will do what
they can to be as brave as they can. But if once they be at their own finding,
all shall be laid out upon apparel, but they will be as fine as master or
mistress: if not so costly, yet in show as specious and brave. New fashions
are as soon got up by servants as by masters and mistresses. What is the end
of this, but to be thought as good as master or mistress? If the Queen of
Sheba were now living, she would as much wonder at the disorder of servants in
these days, as then she wondered at the comely order of Solomon's servants. Let
these proud servants look to it: for if God have threatened to visit Princes
children that walk in strange apparel, Zeph. 1. 8.
can servants that so walk think to go scot-free?

Thus much of servants reverence.
Their obedience follows.
. 10. Of servants obedience.
No inferiors are more bound to obedience then servants: it is their maine,
and most peculiar function, to obey their masters. It is therefore here in my
text expressly mentioned (Servants obey your masters) and all other duties are
comprised under it. Treat. 3.. 17.
The reasons alleged to move wives and children to obey, ought much more to
move servants. Treat. 5.. 11.


They who are contrary minded, who are rebellious, and disdain to be under the
authority of another, and are ready to say of their Master, We will not have
this man to reign over us, are fitter Luke 19. 14.
to live among Anabaptists, then orthodoxall Christians. For to what end is the
lawfulness of authority acknowledged, if subjection be not yielded unto it?
of the two a man were better be blinded with error, then not obey the truth
which he knows.

In handling this point of obedience, I will follow the same order, which I did
in laying forth the obedience of wives and children, and consider

1. The parts of servants obedience wherein it consists. 2. The extent
thereof, how far it reaches.
The parts are two,

One negative. Another affirmative.
The negative is to abstain from doing things of their own head, without or
against their masters consent.

The affirmative is readily to yield to do that which their masters would they
should do.

. 11. Of servants forbearing to do things without their masters consent.
Servants ought to forbear doing of things on their own heads without or
against consent of their masters, because while the time of their service
lasts, they are not their own, neither ought the things which they do, to
be for themselves: both their persons and their actions are all their masters:
and the will of their master must be their rule and guide (in things which are
not against Gods will.) The rite used under the Law of boaring a servants ear,
implied as much. David therefore alluding unto Exo. 21. 6.
that rite, says to God (both of himself, and also of Christ, whom under a
type he prefigured) mine ears have thou boared; and from thence infers that
he would do the will of God. We have Psalm. 40. 6.
a notable pattern hereof in Abraham's servant, who in a business committed to
his charge propounds such scruples as came Genesis 24. 5.
into his head to receive direction from his master therein, lest he should be
forced to do something of his own head without particular warrant from his
master.

This general will the better be cleared, if it be exemplified in some
particulars. Take therefore these instances gathered out of the Scriptures of
things which servants may not do without their masters consent.

1. Servants may not go whither they will. The phrase which the Centurion
uses (I say to one go, and he goes) implies, that except his master bid him
go, he ought not to go. Mat. 8. 9.


2. They ought not to do their own business and affairs. It is noted of
Iaakob being Labans servant, that, though he Genesis 30. 35, 36.
had flocks of his own, yet he fed his masters flocks, and committed his
own to his sons.

3. They ought not to do what business they list themselves. Ahimaaz had a
great desire to carry the news of Absoloms 2 Samuel 18. 19, etc.
death to David: yet without the leave of Ioab his Captain and master he would
not do it. The good mistress gives the portion to her maids, namely, the
portion of work: Pro. 31. 15.
that therefore must they do which she gives them to do. The servants of the
Centurion did every one as by their master Mat. 8. 9. Mat. 25. 16, 17.
they were enjoined: and the servants that had talents committed to them looked
each of them to their own talent.

4. They ought not to mary while the time of their covenant for service
lasts, unless their master give consent thereto. The law of God thus sets
forth the lawful marriages of servants, If his master have given him a wife:
whereby is implied; Exo. 21. 4.
that if a servant mary, it must be with his masters consent.

Object. The Apostle, without exception of servants says, to avoid fornication
let every man have his wife, etc. 1 Cor. 7. 2.

Answ. He there shows what means the Lord has sanctified to every one to
avoid fornication, but he does not thereby give liberty to every one headily
to use that means against that order which God has set down.

2. That precept is given to such as are Sui iuris.
in their own power: for of children he says, that 1 Cor. 7. 36, etc.
parents must see what is meet or not meet for them.

3. That which servants are to gather from thence is, if need so require, to
make known their desire to their master, and to use all the good means they
can by themselves or others to obtain their masters consent.

5. They ought not to dispose their masters goods at their own pleasure, no
not for charitable uses. The Steward which Luke 16. 1, 2.
wasted his masters goods was justly put out of office for it. Yea he is called
unjust for disposing some of them for his own verse. 8.
future maintenance; therefore it was a point of justice and unlawful.

Object. The Lord commended him therein.
Answ. He commended his wisdom, not his injustice: his provident care for the
time to come, not the means of providing for himself. In regard of his
general providence he is commended: in regard of the particular means by
deceiving his master, he is called unjust.

6. They may not before their couenanted time be expired go away from their
master. When Genesis 30. 26.
Iaakob after long service had a mind to be gone, he asked leave, and because
his uncle and master would not willingly let him go, he tarried still.

Object. Afterward and 31. 20.
Iaakob privily stole away from his master.
Answ. 1. His couenanted time was out. 2. He had an express warrant from God
to be gone. 3. His manner of going away is not to be justified, and in that
respect it is no good pattern.

. 12. Of the unlawful liberty which servants take to themselves.
Contrary to the forenamed limitations of servants liberty are these, and such
like lewd and licentious pranks as follow.

1. When servants watch their times to go whither they list, and their master
not know it: as when their masters are seriously employed, or abroad, or in
bed. Thus that lewd servant Gehazi watched his time to run after Naaman,
thinking that 2 King. 5. 20.
his master should not know it.

2. When being bound to their masters service, they do their own business,
and seek their own profit; and that without their masters leave. This
aggrauated Gehazi his privy stealing and withdrawing himself from his master,
that he went to receive gifts for himself. Many such lewd servants there be,
that knowing such and such friends of their master, who will be ready to do
any kindness for them, will use their masters name to borow money, or get some
other favor, and never let their-masters know of it.

3. When servants will choose their own work, and do that which likes
themselves best, or else do nothing at all. Thus where many servants be in one
house together, if they be not in such places as they like themselves, they
will mumble, and grumble, and do nothing well.

4. When servants, especially maid-seruants, that are bound, do purposely mary
to free themselves: because our laws do free a maid that is married from her
service to master and mistress.

5. When they are liberal of their masters goods in giving them away. Some
think that because they are of the house, they may dispose the things of the
house upon charitable uses. But pretense of charity is no excuse for
injustice. Servants may give notice to their masters or mistresses, that there
are in the house such and such things meet to be given away, or that there are
such and such poor folks that stand in great need: but privily without any
consent at all, they may not give away any thing of their masters.

6. When upon discontent they run away from their masters. The two servants of
Shemei which run from their master 1 King. 2. 39. Philem. ver. 12. Genesis 16. 9.
are taxed for it by the holy Ghost. One simus that run from his master is sent
back again by S. Paul: and Hagar is sent back by an Angel.

Object. What if master and mistress be sharp, rigorous, and cruel.
Answ. An Angel from heaven gives one answer, (Submit Genesis 16. 9.
thy self under her hands:) And an Apostle gives another, Be subject with all
fear to the froward: for conscience toward 1 Pet. 2. 18, 19.
God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

These faults are thus noted, that servants taking notice of them, may the more
carefully avoid them.

. 13. Of servants obedience to their masters commandments.
The affirmative and active part of servants obedience, consisting in a ready
yielding to that which their masters will have done, has respect (as the like
kind of childrens obedience) to the Commandment, Instruction, Reproof, and
Correction of their master.

I. A master having power to command his servants, it is What masters command,
servants must do.
a duty of servants to obey their master therein. The particular work which
appertains to a servant by virtue of his place is to have an eye to his
master, to see what he requires at his hands. David thus describes the
property of good servants, Their eyes look to the hand of their master. That
looking, as it Psalm. 123. 2.
implies an expectation of relief and succor, so also a readiness to
receive and execute any thing from them that they would have done. The
Centurion commends this duty Mat. 8. 9.
in the example of his servants, who every one of them did what their master
commanded them to do. It is further commended in the examples of Genesis 24. 9.
Abrams servant, 1 King. 18. 43.
Eliahs servant, and many others. Note how far the Lord Christ exacteth this
duty of servants; Luke 17. 7, 8.
Though a servant has been all day plowing (a laborious and wearisome work)
yet when he comes home, his master commanding him to dress his supper and
wait, he must do it. By all these proofs it appears, that if a master bid
his servant, come, go, do this, or that, he must obey.

The contrary hereunto is the highest degree of disobedience, Contrary.
Refusing to be at command. 2 Samuel 19. 26.
as when servants refuse to be at their masters command, and to do what they
charge them to do: as Ziba, who being commanded to saddle his masters Ass,
went away and did it not: and Jobs servants, who being called would not answer.
Job 19. 16.
Of all other offenses this does most provoke masters: for it is a plain
contempt of their authority.

. 14. Of servants harkening to their masters instructions in matters of their
calling.
II. As a master has power to command, so his duty it is to See Treat. 8..
21, 38.
instruct his servants in the way of righteousness, and in that civil course
of life wherein he is to walk. The duty then of servants it is, in both to
hearken and be obedient unto them.

1. Such servants as are under masters to learn their trade, are bound many
ways to hearken to them.

1. That for the time they may do the better service to their masters.

2. That by learning a trade or skill in any good calling they may be the
better able when the time of their service is out to maintain themselves, to
teach other servants which shall be under them, and to do the more good in the
place where they shall live.

3. That thus they may the better discharge a good conscience in that
particular place wherein God has set them.

Contrary is the idle, sluggish, dull disposition of many servants, who by
reason of their carelessness and untowardness in doing that which they are
taught, vex and grieve their masters, yea and make them weary of instructing
them. Many prentises spend all the time of their prentiship without reaping any
good at all: they never prove their crafts masters: so many in the country
live under good husbands, many Clearks under good Lawyers, many maids under
good houswiues, and that many years together, yet through their negligence get
no good at all, whereas if they would have been attentive and careful, they
might have learned much. Enemies these are to their masters, to themselves, to
the city and country where they live, and to their friends and parents,
especially if they have any alive.

. 15. Of servants harkening to their masters instructions in piety.
Such servants as have religious masters who are careful to Obedience of
servants to pious instructions.
instruct their household in the way of righteousness, ought to be obedient to
their instructions: so were Iosuahs servants, (or else could not Iosuah have
undertaken for them Ios. 24. 15.
as he did) and the servants of that Ruler of whom it was said that himself
believed c John 4. 53.
and all his house: and the servants of Lidia, and of the Iay^er, concerning
whom it is said, Acts 16. 15,
She was baptized and her household: 34.
he believed in God and all his house. Under these words house and household,
none doubts but that servants are comprised.

Now then if the servants of these had not hearkened and yielded to the
instructions of their master and mistress, would they have believed in him in
whom their masters believed, or been baptized when their mistress was? The
like may be gathered out of this phrase, Romans 16. 5. Philem. v. 2.
The Church in their house: for thereby is implied that all in the house were
of the same faith that their master and mistress were. It is expressly noted of
the Act. 10. 7.
Soldier that waited continually on Cornelius, that he was a devout man,
whereby it is presupposed that he hearkened to his masters instructions: for it
is noted of the master also, that Verse. 2.
he was a devout man and feared God.

The benefit which redoundeth to servants by obeying such instructions, is
unspeakable: much more good may be got by following the spiritual directions
of religious masters, then the witty and commodious directions of the wisest
statesmen, and the skilfullest artists, or tradesmen that be: so as there is a
double bond to bind servants to obey this kind of instructions: 1. The bond
of duty. 2. The bond of profit and benefit to themselves.


. 16. Of Servants faults contrary to obedience in matters of religion.
Notwithstanding the forenamed duty be so behouefull to servants, yet of all
other duties is it by many least thought to be a duty, and most neglected, the
clean contrary for the most part being practiced, as may appear by these
particulars.

1. Many servants are of so impious a mind, as of all masters Contrary, 1.
Loath to serve religious masters.
they will not serve such as are religious, and make conscience to instruct
their servants in the way to salvation: they had rather serve profane masters,
mere worldlings, and very Papists. For why? any thing better agrees to
corrupt nature then to be kept within the bounds of religion: few like the
strait gate and narrow way that leads to life: for the god of this world so
blinds men's eyes, that they cannot see the blessing of life at the end of
this way, they only see the straitness of it: or if they should see it a far
off, yet they so savor the things of the flesh, and of this present evil
world, as they would not regard that which is so far off. Now religious
masters will endeavor what they can to keep all their servants in that narrow
way; but irreligious masters will suffer them to follow the sway of their own
corruption, to swear, to profane the Sabbath, and spend that whole day in
sleeping, sporting, eating and drinking: to go to bed without prayer, or
catechizing, or reading the word of God, and so to rise again and go about
their business: to which holy duties, such devout masters as Cornelius was,
will hold their servants.

2. Others that are placed by their friends under such devout 2. Mutter against
them being in service.
masters, or not knowing before hand the disposition of their masters, have
themselves couenanted with them to be their servants, after they have been a
while in the house, think their masters house a prison to them, muttering and
murmuring against their strait keeping in, as they deem it: and being called
in to any religious exercise, they will be ready to say, I was not hired for
this, neither am I bound to you herein, set me about your work and I will do
it.

3. Some again are the more negligent and dissolute in their 3. Negligent
because masters religious.
business, because their masters are religious. It is a common complaint, that
profane, worldly masters shall have more service then religious and godly
masters, yea though these give better wages, diet and lodging then those. Many
think the fault hereof to be in the master: but assuredly for the most part
the fault is the corrupt disposition of servants, that esteem pleasure in
sin, and liberty thereunto more then wages, diet, and lodging: whereby they
show themselves impious against God, ungrateful to their masters, injurious to
themselves. Let this perverse disposition be noted, that the rule of the
Apostle very pertinent to this point, may be the better observed, They 1 Timothy
6. 2.
that have believing masters let them not despise them, but rather do them
service, because they are faithful and beloved.

. 17. Of servants obedience to reproof and correction.
The same directions may serve for yielding to reproof and correction: for
they may both be brought to one head: and in the general they do both agree.
For reproof is a verbal correction, and correction is a real reproof.

The obedience which servants in regard of these must show to their masters is
twofold.

1. Patiently to bear all manner of reproof and correction.

2. Readily to amend that for which they are justly reproved or corrected.

For the first of these, servants have an express precept, enforced 1 Pet. 2.
18. etc.
by many reasons in these words, Servants be subject to your masters with all
fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. For this is
thank worthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering
wrongfully. For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye take
it patiently? but if whey ye do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently,
this is acceptable with God. Here we see,

1. That correction is patiently to be borne by servants: if correction, then
much more reproof.

2. That though correction be iniustly inflicted, yet it is patiently to be
endured: therefore much more when it is deserved.

3. That buffeting and that of a froward master is to be borne: therefore much
more lighter correction of a good and gentle master. Joseph patiently endured
Psalm. 105. 18.
fetters, and iron chains, and Genesis 39. 20.
imprisonment inflicted upon him most unjustly, even for his faithfulness to
his master. Great was the recompense which God made unto him: and assuredly God
will recompense all the wrong, pain, and grief, that in this case shall be
endured for conscience sake. For the Apostle says, that this is thankworthy,
that is, worthy of praise and commendation, and so worthy of recompense and
reward. Again he says that it is acceptable to God, so as God will recompense
it, though men may account it but baseness and blockishnesse: yea though
unjust masters may thereupon take occasion the more to trample upon, and insult
over their servants.

To these motives I may add the rule of our Christian profession (which is
also intimated by the Apostle in these words, 1 Pet. 2. 21.
Even hereunto were ye called.) For our Christian calling requires all men to
Romans 12. 19.
give place unto wrath: Matt. 5. 39.
To turn the other cheek when one is smitten: Romans 12. 21.
To overcome evil with goodness. 1 Pet. 2. 21.
If all Christians must show such patience to all men, even their equals: how
much more servants to masters? The Apostle commends to servants the example
of Christ in this case: he was reviled and much he suffered, and that most
injuriously, and yet patiently did he bear all: if servants thus suffer with
him, they also shall reign with him.

. 18. Of the extremes contrary to servants patient bearing of reproof and
correction.
Patient bearing of rebuke and blows, seems an hard saying to most servants:
they cannot endure to hear it: for their mind and carriage is clean contrary
thereunto.

1. Some being but reproved, though justly, are ready to answer again, and to
chop word for word: a sin Tit. 2. 9. (...).
expressly forbidden. It seems by the Apostles express mentioning of it, that
answering again has been an old evil quality in servants.

Object. If a master unjustly reprove his servant, and the servant answer not
again, he wittingly suffers his master to continue in his error, and so
makes himself accessory to his masters sin.

Answ. There is difference betwixt a spightfull, reuengefull contradicting of
that which is spoken, and an humble, mild, reverend, seasonable apology for
that which is unjustly censured. This is lawful: but that is forbidden.

2. Others scorn to be corrected: which disdain they manifest many ways: as

1. By muttering, and saying they came not for that end. But though that were
not the maine end of their subjection, yet is it a means to keep them under
subjection: and therefore to be endured by them.

2. By running away, as See. 12.
Hagar.

3. By struggling and striving with their master or mistress: and taking the
staff or wand by the end: or by holding the hands of those that correct them.

Object. Shall I suffer my self wrongfully to be beaten, when I can help my
self and hinder it?
Answ. 1. Servants may not be their own Judges whether their correction be
just or unjust: for men are so prone to sooth themselves and to extenuate the
evil actions which they do, as if they be not corrected till they think it
just, they would never be corrected.

2. To endure punishment (that I may use Saint Peter's word) is not otherways
thanke-worthy. If justly thou be punished, thou have but thy desert. If
forcibly so as thou can not resist, necessity makes thee bear it. The
sturdiest thieves that be, being pinnied, suffer themselves to be turned over,
because they see a necessity. But Christ (whose 1 Pet. 2. 21.
example in this case is set before servants) Mat. 26. 53.
could have freed himself but would not. If servants endure for conscience
sake, they will not resist, though they be able.

3. Others if they be smitten by master or mistress, will give as much as they
receive, they will smite again: a practice unbeseeming any Christian, but most
unseemly for Christian servants: who manifest thereby a despite of Gods image
and power in their masters.

4. Others are so possessed with a devil, as they will seek all the revenge
they can, if they be corrected: whence it comes to pass that some hot,
heady, hardy youth, stick not to challenge their masters into the field: and
others, more maliciously minded, secretly endeavor to take away the life of
their masters. Many that have not the opportunity to practice such villainies,
do notwithstanding in their hearts wish their masters destruction, and make
most fearful imprecations against them; whereby they make themselves guilty
of blood before God.

. 19. Of servants amending that for which they are justly reproved or corrected.
More then patience is required of them that are deservedly rebuked or
corrected for their faults: namely See more of this point Treat. 5.. 33. and 34.
repentance, and amendment. Thus shall the smart and pain which servants
endure, be as good physic unto them, and turn to their good. True amendment
of former faults may make one a better servant then he was before he committed
those faults: witness that which Saint Paul says of Onesimus, Philem. verse.
11.
in time past he was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and me.

Contrary is their disposition, who notwithstanding all rebuke and correction
go on still in their evil and lewd courses: and continue to provoke their
master more and more, and so make them add blow unto blow, and stroke unto
stroke, till they have no hope of them, but are forced to put them out of
doors. This comes either from a scornful, disdainful stomach (for Pro. 13.
1.
a scorner hears not rebuke) or from a base, servile, stupid, blockish,
brutish nature, that is not moved with any smart or pain, like a restie jade
that will not stir though he be whipped or beaten never so much. Pro. 26. 3.
Solomon implies thus much by putting into one leash an horse, an ass, and a
fool: meaning by a fool a scornful, blockish servant: to whose back a rod
is as a whip to an horse: of such a fool he says, that Pro. 17. 10.
an hundred stripes enter not into him: and again, Pro. 27. 22.
Though thou should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet
will not his foolishness depart from him.

But what shall we say of such as for rebuke and correction are the worse?
What, but that shame, beggary, and some ignominious death or other is like to
befall them.

Hitherto of the kinds of servants duties. The next point respects the
manner of performing them.

. 20. Of serving with trembling.
The Manner how servants ought to perform their duties is noted in four
phrases:

The first whereof is this, with fear and trembling. I.


Fear is both as a fountain from whence all other duties flow: and also as a
sauce to season them all.

Commonly the season and savor of waters comes from the fountain: which
Saint James implies, where he says, no fountain does yield salt water and
fresh: for if the fountain be Iam. 3. 12.
salt, the streams issuing from thence will be salt: and fresh, if the
fountain be fresh: so if fear be seated in the heart of servants, all their
obedience and submission will be seasoned therewith. Let therefore servants
here learn by their manner of performing all their duties, to declare that
there is a true seruant-like fear seated in their hearts. Hereof I shall need
say no more then what has been. 4.
before delivered.

The other word See Treat. 1.. 124.
trembling added to fear, adds emphasis, showing that it is no small fear
that is required of servants: and it gives them to wit that their masters
having a power to punish them, they must so carry themselves as they provoke
not their master to wrath, but be very careful and circumspect to avoid his
displeasure, that they give him no just occasion of offense. This care had that
servant of David which first espied Absalom hanging in a tree, and told Ioab
thereof: 2 Samuel 18. 12.
he so feared the displeasure of the king his master, as to gain a thousand
shekels of silver he durst not kill Absalom. The like is noted of Obadiah, who
was afraid to tell his master Ahab where Eliah was, left his master might have
thought he had mocked him, if the Spirit had carried Eliah away. 1 King. 18. 9.
etc.


This trembling fear is needful in regard of the small love that servants
commonly bear to their masters. There are not those motives to stir up love
in servants to their masters, as in children to their parents: except therefore
through awe and dread they be kept in compass, they will exceedingly
transgress: and because this is so needful, servants must labor to nourish
it, as a means to keep them from overmuch boldness.

Contrary on the one side is a proud despising of a masters authority (saying,
if not with their mouths, yet in their heart, as Gaal of Abimelech, who is he
that we should serve him? or as those that despised the government of Christ
their master, Judge. 9. 28.
Luke 19. 14.
we will not have this man to reign over us: and again, Psalm. 2. 3.
let us break his bonds asunder, and cast away his cords from us.) And on the
other side a wretched carelessenesse, not fearing any punishment before they
feel it: like to many desperate thieves that no whit fear the power of the
Judge, but desperately say, we have but one death to pay. The authority of God
himself is despised, and his revenging hand is lightly regarded by such proud
and desperate servants: so as their sin is no small sin.

. 21. Of serving with sincerity.
The second branch concerning the manner of servants performing their duty is
in these words, in singleness of heart, 11.
so as all must be performed with an honest and upright heart: whatsoever ye
do, do it heartily, says the Apostle to servants Col. 3. 23.
in another place. Thus did Joseph in singleness of heart serve his master:
instance his refusing to abuse his mistress in Genesis 39. 11, 12.
a private chamber when she desired it, and no other body was in the house.
Happy were it for masters to have such servants: then might they take no more
care then Potiphar did, but put Genesis 39. 6.
all that they have into their servants hands. Neither would this rare virtue
in servants be only profitable to their masters, but also very comfortable to
themselves, and bring them much peace of conscience.

Contrary is hypocritical service: when servants have a heart, and a heart,
making shew-of one heart outwardly, and have another, even a clean contrary
heart within them. Such Psalm. 12. 2.
an one was Gehazi, who came in and stood before his master, as if he had
performed some good service for his master, when 2. King 5. 25.
he had most highly dishonored him: and such an one was Judas who carried as
fair a face to his master as any of the disciples, and yet was an arrant
traitor: for when he was thought to go out to buy provision for his master, he
went to John 13. 29.
betray him.

All eye-seruice is contrary to the forenamed singleness of heart: when
servants are diligent so long as their masters eye is on them: Eye service.
like little children that will do any thing their mother will have them do,
while her eye is upon them; but nothing, when her back is turned. The world is
full of such eye-seruing servants, who while their masters are present, will be
as busy as Bees: but if he be away, then either idling at home, or gadding
abroad, or nothing but wrangling, and eating, and drinking with the drunken;
like that lewd servant whom Christ notes in the parable Matthew. 24. 49.
Let the judgment denounced against him be noted of such servants.

. 22. Of serving for conscience sake.
The third branch of the manner of servants performing III. Sit seruus non vt
seruus ad oculum, sed vt domini studiosus. Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12.
their duty is in these words, as unto Christ, as the servants of Christ,
doing the will of God, as to the Lord: all which do set forth a good
conscience, or such service as is performed for conscience sake, or for the
Lords sake, which is all one: because the conscience has an eye only to the
Lord, to his will, and to his ordinance. Though there were no other motive in
the world to move them to obey their masters, yet their conscience to God would
move them. Such was Joseph's manner of serving his master, as the reason which
he himself renders to his mistress shows, How can I do this great
wickedness, and sin against God? The Genesis 39. 9.
prayer which Abraham's servant made to God, and the thanks Genesis 24. 12, 27.
which he rendered to him for blessing his journey, show, that he served his
master for the Lords sake. It is more clear then needs be proved, that such
was Iaakobs service to his master. This is the rather to be noted of Christian
servants, because herein lies the greatest difference betwixt believing
servants, and others: others may serve with fear and trembling, in singleness
of heart, and with good will; but only Saints do service as to Christ for
conscience sake: If this be not that which only they aim at, yet assuredly
they do chiefly and principally aim at it: which makes them not to content
themselves with doing the thing, but to endeavor to do it after the best
manner that they can, so as God may best accept thereof: whereby as they
approve themselves to God, so they do much good to their masters, and bring
much comfort unto their own souls.

Contrary is the mind of most, who do all the service which Service on
by-respects.
they do on by-respects: they may perform much duty, and it may be do much
good to their masters; and thereupon they may get good wages at their masters
hands, and extraordinary recompense also, and live in much quiet under them:
but no reward can they look for at Gods hands: so as I may say to such
servants, as Christ said to those who did all to have glory of men, They have
their reward. Matthew. 6. 2.


. 23. Of servants willingness to perform their duty.
The fourth branch respecting the manner of servants performing IIII.
their duty, is noted in this phrase, with good will. This good will of a
servant to his master, has respect partly to the disposition of the servant,
and so it implies willingness and cheerfulness; Service to be done
cheerfully.
and partly to the benefit of the master, and so it implies faithfulness.

Of willingness to do that duty which belongs to a servant, Christ Jesus
(who Phil. 2. 7.
took upon him the form of a servant) has made himself a worthy pattern.
Psalm. 40. 8.
I delight to do thy will, says he to him that sent him: and again, Joh. 4.
34.
My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. Does
not a man eat his meat willingly, with delight and cheerfulness? even so did
Christ the work of him that sent him. So cheerfully did Iaakob serve his
Uncle Laban, that Genesis 29. 20.
seven years seemed to him but a few days.

Object. The reason thereof was the love he had to Rachel.
1. Answ. This was one reason, but not the only reason: had he not borne good
will to his Uncle and Master, as well as love to his wife, the time might have
seemed tedious enough: but both meeting together, made the time pass away the
better.

2. Answ. If the love he had to Rachel made him do his service so cheerfully:
then if servants love God, for whose sake they ought to do their service, it
will cheerfully be done.

1. That which the Apostle applies to giving of alms (2 Cor. 9. 7.) may be
extended to all manner of duties which God requires, God loves
cheerfulness: that work therefore which is not seasoned therewith God
regards not.

2. As cheerfulness makes God the better to like the work, so it makes the
work much more easy to him that does it. Our common proverb notes as much,
Nothing is hard to a willing mind.

3. Apostolus seruos monet dominis suis ex animo cum bona voluntate seruire, vt
scilicet si non possunt a dominis liberi fieri, suam seruitutem ipsi quodammedo
liberam faciant. Aug de Ciu. Dei, l. 19. c. 15. Direction.
Let there be cheerfulness in a servants mind, and he is as free as his
master: for such a servant is the Lords freeman (1 Cor. 7. 22.) and when he
cannot be made free of his master, he does after a manner make his service free.

Have an eye to God, to his acceptance, and remuneration, and it will quicken
thy spirit. Man's reward makes poor men glad of work, and cheerful in doing
their work: it is as sugar to sharp wine. Tradesmen, Physicians, Lawyers, all
sorts of men, are by gain drawn on with great willingness to take great
pains. Should not Gods recompense of our pains make us much more willing?
Surely it would, if we had such an eye of Heb. 11. 26.
faith as Moses had, thereby to see the recompense of reward which he saw.

Contrary is heaviness of spirit, and discontentednesse of mind, Contrary,
Discontentednesse.
when servants do their service lowringly, grudgingly, by compulsion (as
Bears are brought to a stake) and of necessity, as slaves in a galley. Such
service must needs be untowardly done: but though outwardly it be well done,
yet can the doer have little comfort therein, because God accepts it not.

. 24. Of servants quickness and diligence in their service.
Servants, in testimony of their willingness and cheerfulness, must be both
quick and diligent in their service: for these are effects of willingness.
Quickness has respect to the time of doing a thing. Diligence to the pains
that is taken about it.

He that is quick in his service takes up no more time about Quickness.
one thing then must needs; but is ready to do one thing after another; and
thus does much more service. It is expressly noted of Rebekah, that she Genesis 24.
18, 20.
hasted, and let down her pitcher: and hasted and emptied her pitcher, and ran
again to the Well. And Abraham's servant having made what speed he could to the
place whither he was sent, Genesis 24. 33.
would not eat till he had told his errand: after he had told it, if he had not
sped, verse. 49.
he would not have delaied time, but have gone again forthwith: when he had
well dispatched all, verse. 56.
he would not stay upon any complements, but hasted away to his master. 2 Samuel
18. 23.
Ahimaaz strove with Cushi who should soonest bring their message to their
master: and Ahimaaz outstript Cushi, for he had a very willing mind to do the
business. The manner of charge which Elisha gave to his servant, implies all
the speed he could make: it was this, 2 King. 4. 29.
Gird up thy loins, go thy way: if thou meet any by the way, salute him not:
and if any salute thee, answer him not again.

He that is diligent in his service, will not only be quick for the Diligence.
time, but also hold on, and employ all the labor and pains that he can for
the well effecting of that which he is to do. That general charge laid upon
all men, in particular appertains to a servant ( Genesis 3. 19.
In the sweat of thy face thou shall eat bread) and that which Solomon notes (
Eccl. 9. 10.
what soever thine hand finds to do, do it with thy might.) Great was
Iaakobs diligence (for he says of himself in doing his masters business,
Genesis 31. 40.
In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep
departed from mine eyes.) Great also was the diligence of those shepherds, that
Luke 2. 8.
kept watch over their flock by night: and of Mat. 25. 16, 17.
those servants, that by their pains doubled the talents which were committed
to them. As diligence is by these and many like examples commended unto us, so
is it further set forth by the many promises which are made unto it, as, Pro.
10. 4.
The hand of the diligent makes rich: and 12. 14.
The recompense of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him: verse. 24.
The hand of the diligent shall be are rule: and 14. 23.
In all labor there is profit.

The work which servants are by their master appointed to do, is to them the
work of God: whereupon the Apostle says to servants as well as to others, 1
Cor. 7. 17.
as God has called every one, so let him walk: but the work of God is to be
done with all diligence: for Jer. 48. 10.
Cursed is he that does the work of the Lord negligently.

Contrary is the idleness, laziness, slothfulness, and sluggishnesse
Idleness.
of servants. These are faults too too common. Solomon much inueigheth against
these vices, setting them forth in their kind, and setting down the many
mischiefs that follow thereupon.

Thus he deciphereth them; Pro. 26. 13, 14, 15.
The slothful man says, there is a Lion in the way (that is, he pretends
unlikely danger) As the door turns upon the hinges, so a slothful man upon
his bed. The slothful hides his hand in his bosom, it grieueth him to bring
it again to his mouth. and 24. 33.
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.

These are the mischiefs which he notes to come from idleness and sloth, and
10. 4.
Poverty, and 12. 24.
Servitude, and 13. 4.
Fruitless wishes and desires, and 19. 15.
Hunger, and 20. 4.
Beggerie, and 21. 25.
Death. And to show what small joy or comfort masters may have in slothful
servants, he compares them to vinegar and smoke, which are as irksome to the
teeth and eyes as can be: and 10. 26.
As vinegar (says he) is to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so is the
sluggard to them that send him. And because many idle packs think and say they
do no hurt, he further says, that and 18. 9.
He that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster: in
which respect Christ styles a slothful servant, Mat. 25. 26, 30.
a wicked and unprofitable servant: and gives him the portion of those who do
much hurt.

How lightly soever many servants esteem idleness and sloth, the truth is,
that it is a plain theft. For the best service that servants can do, is due
to their master: and they ought to be as diligent in their masters work, as if
it were their own. So as it is not enough to avoid idleness in doing nothing
at all, but they must take heed that they be not slothful in doing something:
for as good not at all, as never a whit the better.

I have the further pressed this point, because it is noted as a blemish in
such servants as profess religion to be most lazy and negligent, least
sedulous and diligent. Much of that time which they should spend about their
masters business (which is their particular calling) they spend in prating
about state, and Church-businesse, (matters not belonging to them.) Thus they
make their masters weary of their service; and by reason thereof they are often
shifted from house to house, and as rolling stones, gather no moss: they
neither learn skill, whereby they may, when they are of themselves, maintain
themselves, and do good to others: nor lay up any stock or portion, as others
which are diligent do: yea they get such an habit of idleness, as they can
never shake it off again: for they who are slothful being under masters,
seldom prove diligent when they are for themselves. In these is Solomon's
proverb verified, The talk of the lips tends only to penury. Pro. 14. 23.


. 25. Of servants faithfulness.
It was. 23.
before noted, that the good will here required of servants to their masters
had respect to the profit and benefit which servants by their service might
bring to their masters: and in that respect it compriseth faithfulness under
it, Faithfulness (I say) whereby servants do well discharge that trust which
is committed to them. Expressly it is commanded to servants, Tit. 2. 10.
To show all good faithfulness, and 1 Cor. 4. 2.
it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful. The phrase which is
used of Moses, Heb. 3. 5.
He was faithful as a servant, shows that faithfulness by a kind of
propriety appertains to a servant: and Mat. 25. 21.
where Christ coupleth these two, good and faithful, he gives us to
understand that a servants goodness consists in his faithfulness.

Great is the benefit that by servants faithfulness will redound both to
master and servant.

The benefit which comes to the master, Solomon notes in this proverb, As
the cold of snow (is very acceptable, comfortable Pro. 25. 13.
and profitable) in the time of harvest (when men are even sweltered with heat)
so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul
of his masters: and again in this, A faithful ambassador is health, that is,
he brings safety to his master. Pro. 13. 17.


The benefit which redoundeth to the servant himself by his faithfulness
Christ notes in this his approbation, and remuneration thereof, Well done thou
good and faithful servant, Mat. 25. 21.
thou have been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many
things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. Every servant shall be called to
his account: if not by his master on earth, yet by his master in heaven: he
will say to every one, Give an account of thy stewardship: now then if servants
have not been Luke 16. 2.
faithful, what other discharge can they look for, then that which the
wicked, slothful, and unprofitable servant (who hid his talent in a napkin)
received, namely this, Cast ye the Mat. 25. 30.
unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth. Let all unfaithful servants note this: for to faithfulness is
contrary all unfaithfulness, as negligence, deceit, theeuery, treachery, and
such like vices. Much damage, disgrace, and vexation is brought by such
servants to masters: and better it had been that they never had come into a
man's house.

But that the point of faithfulness may be the better discerned, and observed,
I will exemplify it in seven particulars whereabout it ought especially to be
exercised, which are, 1. The Goods, 2. The Businesses and affairs, 3. The
Counsels and secrets, 4. The other servants, 5. the Children, 6. The Bedfellow,
7. The Person of their master or mistress.

. 26. Of servants faithfulness about their masters goods.
Two things are required of servants to testify their faithfulness about
their masters goods. 1.
1. A safe keeping of them. 2. An increasing of them.


1. Whatsoever is committed by masters unto their servants, they must so
carefully preserve, as it be not lost, spoiled, or impaired Servants must well
preserve their masters goods.
under their hands, whether they be things within doors, or without. I may to
this purpose not unfitly apply that charge unto servants which in another case
the Apostle gave to Timothy, 1 Timothy 6. 20. (...).
Keep that which is committed to thy trust: the Metaphor is taken from
servants, and so shows what is their duty. Great was Joseph's faithfulness
in this kind, which made his master Genesis 39. 4.
put all that he had into his hand. So great was Iackobs faithfulness, that
and 31. 38, 39.
in twenty years his masters ewes and she Goats, being under his hand, cast
not their young, nor the Rams were devoured: if any thing were torn of
beasts, he brought it not to his master, but bare the loss of it himself. If
servants epsy any damage or hurt done by others to their masters goods, they
must redress it, if they can, or at least make it known to their masters,
that he may give order for the redressing of it: as the servants of him that
sowed good seed among which tares were sowed, mentioned Mat. 13. 27.
in the parable.

Masters that put servants in trust, securely go about other affairs, and
look not themselves to those goods which are under their servants custody,
which is to be presupposed they would do, if they trusted not their servants.
Great reason therefore it is that servants be careful of those things which
are so committed to them.

2. They ought further to do what lies in them to advance Servants must
endeavor to increase their masters estate. Genesis 30. 30. Mat. 25. 16, 17.
their masters estate, and to increase his stock. The little which Laban had
was by Iaakobs faithfulness in this kind increased unto a multitude. The
talents which were committed to the two faithful servants were by their
industry increased to as many more. So as it is not sufficient for servants
not to impair their masters estate, but they must better it: for he that kept
safe his masters talent, and gave him his own again, was counted an
unprofitable servant, and received the doom of wasters.

Most masters take servants for their advantage and benefit, for it is but
little ease for a master to provide diet and lodging for many servants, and to
give them wages, if they reap no profit and benefit by them.

. 27. Of servants carelessness over their masters goods.
Contrary to servants fidelity in safe keeping their masters goods committed
to their charge is Carelessness and negligence in suffering loss and damage
come to their masters as in the fields, when they look not to his senses and
gats: or neglect his cattle so as they be stolen, or suffer diseases to grow
upon them, or give them not fodder and water in due season. Or in the house,
when they leave doors or windows open, and thieves come in and take away, or
hook out their masters goods: or carelessly leave the fire, or let candles
burn so as the house may be see on fire: or suffer household stuff, and
apparel to lie till it be moth-eaten or otherwise spoiled: or suffer any thing
in the house to be broken: or victual to lie in corners moulding, or to be
cast up and down for dogs and cats. When Christ so increased the bread and
fish, wherewith many thousands were fed, that many fragments were left, he bid
his disciples gather up what remained, and rendered this reason, that nothing be
lost. The damage which may come by John 6. 12.
servants carelessness, may be more then ever they can be able to make
satisfaction for: and therefore they ought the more carefully to prevent it.

. 28. Of servants fraud.
Contrary to the other branch of servants faithfulness in increasing their
masters estate, is all manner of theft and fraud, whether it be by retaining
that which is due to their masters, or by purloining from them that which they
have. Tit. 2. 10. (...).
The Apostle expressly forbids servants to purloine. The word translated
purloine, is the same whereby the fraud of Ananias is set forth, who Acts 5. 2.
(...).
kept back part of the price of a possession which they sold: so as thereby is
forbidden not only open and manifest stealth, as pilfering money out of their
masters purse, chest, or counter; or conueying away their corn, wares, or any
other goods: but also putting more into the account of expenses then has been
expended, or into the account of debts less then is due (as the unjust
steward, who for a debt of an hundred measures of oil put in fifty, and for
an hundred of Luke 16. 6, 7.
wheat put in fourscore) or spending more then needs, or bringing in ill
company into the house when their masters are absent, and entertaining them on
their masters cost, or concealing part of the price which has been taken for
any wares, or borowing money in their masters names, or taking greater fees
then their masters wot of, or receiving bribes or gifts which their masters
refuse (as Gehazi) or hiring others to do their work upon their masters cost,
or inueagling away their masters 2 King. 5. 22.
customers, or purloining away other men's goods committed to their masters
trust (as Tailors servants, who thereby both much discredit their masters, and
also hinder their custom.)

Object. What if masters detain their servants wages? may they not by privy
means right themselves?
Answ. A masters sin is no warrant to make servants answer sin with sin.
The law is as open for servants as for masters: if not, Gods ears are open for
their complaints: he can and will redress all, or here or hereafter. Genesis 31.
42.
Note Iaakobs example. Many make this a just pretense: but whether it be just
or no, it is not safe to open this gap of deceit.

These and such like kinds of deceit are the more heinous sins because of
that trust which masters repose in servants: for they violate both the bond of
justice, and of fidelity also. If a servant imbezill or defraud his master of
any of his 21. Of Hen. 8. Stat. 7. And 5. of Eliz. Stat. 10.
goods to the value of forty shillings, he is adjudged a felon by our statute
law.

. 29. Of servants faithfulness in the businesses which they are to dispatch
for their masters.
In the businesses which masters commit to the care of II.
their servants to be dispatched by them, they must do their best endeavor
that all may prosper under their hands: as it is noted of Joseph, Genesis 39. 2.
he was a prosperous man: we have not only a pregnant proof, but also an
excellent direction for this point, in the Genesis 24.
example of Abraham's servant, who was very faithful in dispatching the
business of fetching a wife for Isaak: therein let these particulars be noted.

1. He feared God: the whole carriage of that business testifies as much.
There is a double bond to tie servants hereunto: one in respect of themselves,
that in the thing which they do they may be accepted of God: another in
respect of their masters, that their masters business may prosper under their
hands: God prospers such as fear him, in all things they take in hand:
instance the examples of Genesis 30. 27.
Iaakob, and 39. 2.
Joseph, and 1 Samuel 18. 14.
David.

2. He Genesis 24. 12.
called upon God to prosper his endeavors: now prayer is the best means that
possibly can be used to obtain any blessing from the Lord. Without it all our
endeavors are vain ( Psalm. 127. 2.
It is in vain to rise up early and sit up late, and to eat the bread of
carfulness, except Gods blessing accompany all.)

3. He Genesis 24. 27.
gave thanks when he saw the Lord begin to prosper that he took in hand:
thanksgiving for the beginning of a blessing, is an effectual means for
continuance of that blessing: yea it is also an effectual means to move God
to prosper other things that we take in hand: so as, if servants desire to
prosper in all the affairs which they undertake for their masters, they must
render thanks for the first success which he has given, and so for the
second, third, fourth, and for every success.

4. He took all the opportunities he could: Genesis 24. 17, 23.
when he saw a maid to inquire of, he ran to her, and inquired what was
behouefull for his matter: when he had ground to think she was the maid, Verse.
22.
he presented gifts to her: Verse. 33.
so soon as he was brought to the house, he falls upon the matter for which he
came, even before he did eat any thing: after matters to his liking were
concluded, he makes no tarrying, but with all speed carries the maid to Isaak.
In a word, he omitted nothing that in the uttermost of his wisdom he conceived
to be behouefull for that matter: more he could not have done, if the matter
had wholly concerned himself. I shall need no further to urge this point, then
by setting this pattern before servants.

Contrary is their disposition who care not whether the things which they do
for their master prosper or no: if they have taken any pains therein, so as
their master cannot say they have altogether neglected it, there is all that
they care for. If it succeed not well, they will say they are not in Gods place
to make every thing which is done to prosper. But though the whole blessing
rest in God, yet has he sanctified means for obtaining his blessing (as
faith, prayer, thanksgiving, and the like) which because they use not, they
fail in this point of faithfulness. Nay further, they use those things which
do mainly hinder and keep away Gods blessing, and in stead thereof bring a
curse upon all they do, as profaneness, uncleanness, drunkenness, and all
manner of riotousnesse, yea despising Gods word and holy ordinances,
reproaching his Saints, taking his name in vain by swearing, forswearing, and
blaspheming, lying, also backbiting, pilfering, and other like vices. These
irreligious and wicked servants, as they sin against God and their own
souls, so also against their master: it is not for masters profit to keep
such servants.

. 30. Of servants faithfulness in keeping their masters secrets, and
concealing their infirmities.
By reason of that near bond which is betwixt master III.
and servants, and their near and continual abiding together, and the many
imploiments which masters have for their servants, servants come to know many
of their masters secrets: faithfulness therefore requires to keep them
close. Provided that they be not such secrets as tend to the dishonor of God,
or to the danger of the Commonwealth and Church, no nor of a private person:
for 1 Samuel 20. 12.
Jonathan is commended for discovering the mischief which Saul had secretly
intended against David.

For proof of the point, note what Solomon says, Pro. 11. 13.
He that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter: namely, a secret matter.
Note also how faithful Ier. 38. 27.
Jeremiah was in keeping Zedekiahs counsel: though the Princes enquired after
it, yet would he not reveal it to them.

To this head is to be referred a faithful concealing of masters infirmities:
for the best that be are subject to many: and servants which are under their
masters roof continually waiting on them, cannot choose but epsy many: if
herein servants be not faithful, masters were better be without servants in
their houses.

Contrary to keeping close the secrets of masters, is blabbing abroad all such
things as servants know concerning their masters: which is too common a fault:
for when servants of diverse houses men or maids meet together, all their talk
for the most part is of their masters and mistresses, whereby it comes to
pass that all the secrets of an house are soon known about the whole town
or city. Solomon styles such an one a talebearer: A talebearer, says he,
reuealeth secrets: or, he that Pro. 11. 13. and 20. 19.
reuealeth secrets is a talebearer: for many of Solomon's proverbs are
conuertible, they may be turned either way. Now note how Solomon notes out the
mischiefs that tale-bearers work: The words of a talebearer are as wounds,
(they wound the precious name and credit of a man) and they go down into the
innermost Pro. 18. 8.
part of the belly, that is, they do, as it were, strike through the very heart
of a man. Again he notes them to be the cause of all strise, and to raise
discord betwixt chief friends: and in Pro. 16. 28. Pro. 26. 20.
that respect fitly resembles them to wood which is the very fuel of fire.
What enemies then are such servants to an house? They are even as treacherous
spies, the most dangerous enemies that be. Thus we see that this is no light
sin: yet is it so much the more odious when masters and mistresses
infirmities (the publishing whereof may much impair their credit) are made
known.

. 31. Of servants faithfulness in helping one another.
Where many fellow servants are together, faithfulness requires that one be
helpful to another in what they may; IV.
as by good example, good counsel, encouragement in good courses, disswasion
from lewd and wicked practices, peace and unity, with the like. The Lord Christ
expressly calls such an one a faithful servant, and pronounces him blessed.
Mat. 24. 45, 46.


Example and advice of ones equal prevails much with another, so as a fellow
servant may in this kind do more good then the master himself: and if by his
means he bring his fellow servants to be faithful, his own faithfulness is
doubled and trebled; and his master receives a double and treble benefit
thereby: namely the benefit of this good servants faithfulness, and the
benefit of all the other servants faithfulness whom he has made faithful.

Contrary is their practice who by their ill example corrupt Mat. 24. 49.
their fellows (as that evil servant, who, when his master was away, did eat
and drink with the drunken, that is, did cause Genesis 37. 18, etc.
others to be drunken with him) or by ill counsel draw one another on to evil
(as the sons of Iaakob, who when they saw Joseph a far off, said one to
another, Behold this dreamer Mat. 24. 49.
comes, come now and let us slay him, etc. and as they, who, when they saw
their masters son, said among themselves, This is the heir, come let us kill
him, and let us seize on his inheritance) or are ever quarrelling with their
fellows, and smiting them (as that forenamed evil servant whom the Lord
threatens to cut off) or dissuade one another from obedience and subjection
(as they who said, Let us break their bonds Psalm 2. 3.
asunder, and cast away their cords from us; and as Sheba, who said, we have no
part in David: every man to his tents O Israel.) 2 Samuel 20. 1.
These faults are very rife among servants: whence it comes to pass that
there are so few good, and so many bad servants: too true is this proverb, One
skabbed sheep mars a whole flock. Let there be in a great family one servant
that is profane, proud, riotous, stout, rebellious, or otherwise vicious, and
all will soon be like him.

Among other parts of unfaithfulness in this kind one of the most monstrous
(which yet is too too frequent) is to allure one another to uncleanness, and
men and maids to defile one another. We showed. 11.
before, that it was unlawful for servants during the time of their service to
marie without their masters consent: how abominable then is it to defile one
another? The sin is doubled being betwixt servants: for as it is a beastly
sin in it self, so in the forenamed respect it is greatly dishonorable to
their master and his house: besides that the maid so defiled is often disabled to
do her service well: nay many times the charge of the child lies upon the
master. Thus shame and dishonor, grief and vexation, loss and damage all
meet together, the more to gall and pierce him to the very heart. Is not this
then a great part of unfaithfulness? Deserves it not to be severely punished,
and that openly, and publicly with shame and smart too, tht others may take
warning thereby? Many use means to escape the revenging hand of man: but
though they escape man's hand, they shall be sure to meet with Gods heavy
vengeance: whoremongers God will judge. Daily experience shows what misery
Heb. 13. 4.
such wretches bring themselves unto, and how God meets with them, and that
most fearfully.

. 32. Of servants faithfulness about their masters children.
Great faithfulness may servants manifest to their masters V.
in and about their children: as while they are young and not able to look to
themselves, to be tender over them, and well to tend them: maids especially
neatly to handle and look to them, and cleanly to bring them up: and they that
have a particular charge of them, to seek their good in every thing they can,
and give them their due portion: and (because children are much in servants
company) to use in their hearing such speech as may minister grace to them, and
to teach them good things, and (when they grow to some ripeness of years) to
bear a reverend respect to them, and esteem them their betters because they
are their masters children. It is noted of Abraham's servant, that he called his
masters Genesis 24. 65.
son, Master.

Children are dear to parents: the honor and kindness done to them they
account as done to themselves: this kind of faithfulness therefore must needs
be highly esteemed by masters in their servants: and assuredly it is a great
means to work a good respect in masters toward them.

Yet Contrarily do many servants carry themselves toward Points of
unfaithfulness in servants about their masters children.
their masters children, as is apparent by these particulars.

1. Some in their carriage are very hoggish and churlish to their masters
children when their parents are out of sight.

2. Others are very careless of them, and tend them very sluttishly, not
caring how they go: whereby they often procure great displeasure from their
master and mistress.

3. Others get from their masters children what they can: and deprive them of
their allowance, turning it to their own gain.

4. Others exceedingly corrupt their masters children with their filthy and
corrupt communication: teaching them to swear, blaspheme, and use all manner
of unclean speeches: thus is that proverb verified, evil communications 1
Cor. 15. 33.
corrupt good manners. Children often times in their young years learn such ill
language and behavior of lewd servants, as their parents can never get them to
leave again: so as they may curse the day that ever such servants came into
their house.

5. Others allure them to stage-plaies, to dice-houses, and other like places,
which are the very bane of youth: and draw them to spend in riot such allowance
as their parents allow them, yea and beyond that allowance, so as they run in
debt, and get such an habit of spending, as at length they make away their
whole estate.

6. Others inueagle their affections: and often draw them to folly and
uncleanness. This filthy kind of unfaithfulness is so much worse then that
which was. 31.
before noted betwixt fellow servants, by how much nearer and dearer children
are to their parents then servants to their masters.

7. Others that dare not commit this abominable wickedness, stick not to do
that which is little better, namely to draw them on to be contracted, yea and
married to them often times, and that privily without consent of their parents:
whereby parents affections are often so alienated from their children, as they
will not acknowledge them for children, but clean cast them off. These are the
fruits of this lewd kind of unfaithfulness in servants.

. 33. Of servants faithfulness in regard of their masters, or mistresses
bedfellow.
So faithful ought servants to be to their masters and VI.
mistresses, that if one of them should labor to use a servant in any manner
of deceit to the other, the servant ought not to yield. As if a master should
move his maid privily to take away jewels, plate, money, linen, or any such
thing as is in her mistress custody. It skilleth not that the master has the
chiefest power over all the goods: a secret taking of them away without the
priuity of the mistress in whose custody they are, is in the servant deceit,
and a point of unfaithfulness. Much less ought any servants be moved by their
mistress privily to take away their masters corn, wares, or any goods for her
private use. Of the two this is the greater part of unfaithfulness.

If such deceit ought not to be used about any goods, much less about the body
of master or mistress. As if a master should allure his maid to commit folly
with him, or a mistress her man, both their conscience to God, and also their
faithfulness to their master or mistress should make them utterly to refuse
it, and to give no place to any such temptation. Genesis 39. 7. etc.
Joseph is propounded as a pattern herein: and against the suggestion of his
mistress he renders the two forenamed reasons: his conscience to God in these
words, how can I do this great wickedness and sin against God? His
faithfulness to his master in these, He has not kept back any thing from me
but thee, how then etc.

To this head may be referred servants faithfulness in making known to their
master the sin of his wife, and to their mistress the sin of her husband,
especially if it be such a sin as may tend to the ruin of the family, and
that by the knowledge thereof, the party that is not blinded and besotted with
the sin, but rather free from it, may be a means to redress it. Thus 1 Samuel
25. 14.
Nabals servants made known to Abigail the churlishness of Nabal toward
David's servants: by which means the mischief intended against the house was
prevented. Thus if servants know that their master intends some mortal
revenge against another, to tell his wife thereof in time, may be great
faithfulness: or if they know their mistress has appointed to go away
privily from her husband, to tell him of it, is a part of faithfulness. This
may be applied to many other like cases.

The contrary is yielding to masters or mistresses in any point of deceit one
against another: whereunto servants are too prone, because they think to be
boulstred out by the authority of the party that sets them on work to
deceive. But no authority can be a warrant for any deceit, or wickedness.

. 34. Of servants faithfulness about their masters persons.
Masters and Mistresses are flesh and blood as well as servants, VII.
and so subject to weakness, sickness, old age, and other distresses, wherein
they may stand in great need of servants help: servants therefore must be
faithful in affording them the best help that they can. Saul's servants did a
part of faithfulness to their master, when, he being vexed with an evil
spirit, 1 Samuel 16. 16.
they inquired after means to ease him. So did David's servants, when he being
bedred, 1 King. 1. 2.
they sought out one to cherish him. It was a point of faithfulness in Naamans
2 King. 5. 3.
maid, to tell her mistress of a means whereby her master might be cured of
his leprosy: and in his verse. 13.
servants, to persuade him to use the means prescribed by the Prophet.

Contrary is a servants ungrateful and inhumane leaving of his master in his
time of need, as the servants of Job did: for when the hand of God lay heavy
upon him, and all his goods were taken from him, and his body full of sore
boiles, Job 19. 15, 16.
they that dwelt in his house, and his maids counted him for a stranger: and he
was an aliant in their sight: he called his servant, and he gave him no answer.
So did 2 Samuel 19. 26.
Ziba leave Mephibosheth in his greatest need: and Mat. 26. 56.
the Disciples fly from their master Jesus Christ. But what shall we say of
those that take occasion from their masters impotencie to murder him
themselves, as 2 Samuel 4. 6.
Rechab and Baanah; or to betray him to his enemies, as Mat. 26. 15.
Indas betrayed the Lord Christ? what, but that such traitorous servants may
look for such ends.

. 35. Of the means to make servants faithful.
Among many other means to make servants faithful to their master, and
careful to perform other duties sincerely, willingly, cheerfully, and
diligently, as has before been noted, this is one of the most general,
namely, that servants, in all things they do for their master, make their
masters case their own, and so do for him as they would for themselves, or as
they would have their own servants do for them. The general rule of the Law
is, Leu. 19. 18.
Love thy neighbor as thy self; and Mat. 7. 12.
whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you even so to them. If
thus every man must respect another, yea though he be a stranger, then much
more must servants respect their master, because all that they can do is after
an especial manner as a debt due to their masters: in which respect Christ
says, that when they have done all that is Luke 17. 10.
commanded, they have but done their duty.

This I have the rather noted, because the practice of most servants is
contrary thereunto. For while they work for their masters, they will cry out
that they are ouer-burdened, and tired with that work which they will easily
go through withal when they work for themselves. They that while they work
for their master, must be called to it again and again, and forced to stand
to it, and to hold out till it be done, what pains will they take, how early
will they rise, how late will they sit up, how diligent will they be for
themselves? When Iourneymen receive increase of wages according to the work
which they do, they will dispatch more then a prentise that has but cloth,
food, and lodging. Again, many that in their masters goods are very lavish,
and wastfull, when they come to before themselves are very sparing, saving, and
provident. What do these things argue but that servants do not bear to their
masters that mind which they should: they do not for them as they would do
for themselves. Very requisite it is therefore that the forenamed general rule
be observed.

Hitherto of the several kinds of servants duties, and of the manner of
performing them. It remains to speak both of the extent of their duties, and
also of the restraint of that extent.. 36. Of servants endeavor to make their
judgment agree with their masters.
The extent of servants duties is in my text only implied under this indefinite
particle (Obey) (which being not restrained to any particulars, must be extended
to every thing) but in other places it is expressly laid down in these general
terms, Col. 3. 22.
Obey in all things, Tit. 2. 9.
Please well in all things. It is not therefore sufficient that servants
perform their duties well in some things, they must do it in all things, yea
in things that may be against their own mind and liking, if their master will
have it so. For this end let servants note these two rules. The same extent and
restraint Extent of servants duties.
that was Treat. 3.. 63, etc. and Treat. 5.. 35.
before noted in laying forth the duties of other inferiors, is here also to be
observed in the duties of servants: for therein they all agree. The same rules
therefore that were before set down, may here again be applied. I refer the
reader to those places for a more large amplification of the generals: and here
I will content my self with adding such particular proofs as are most proper
and pertinent to servants.

1. That they labor to bring their judgment to the bent of their masters
judgment, and to think that meet and good which Servants must labor to bring
their judgment to agree with their masters.
he does. Thus the Judge. 19. 11, 12, etc.
servant of the Leuire which thought it meetest to turn into one of the Cities
of the Iebusites to lodge there, because the day was far spent, when he saw his
master to be of another mind, yielded to him. So did Luke 19. 25, etc.
those servants yield to their master, who at first thought it unmeet that he
that had ten talents should have one piece more: and Mat. 13. 28, etc.
those servants also, that at first thought it meet that the tares should be
plucked up from the wheat. This rule is to be observed in the particular points
before delivered, as the work which servants do, and the manner of doing it,
their apparel, their allowance, yea and in the correction which their master
gives them, and the rest.

Contrary is that great conceit which many servants have of Servants conceit of
their own wit.
their own judgment, wit, and wisdom, thinking themselves wiser then their
masters; as Gehazi, who opposing his own wit to his masters wisdom, said, 2
King. 5. 20.
Behold my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands
that which he brought: but as the Lord lives, I will run after him, and take
somewhat of him. This was also a fault in 2 King. 2. 16.
the children of the Prophets, that would not rest on Elishas judgment, but
importuned him against his mind to send some to seek the body of Eliah. This
self-conceit is the cause of many mischiefs: as of discontentednesse at the
work their master appoints them, and at the allowance of meat and drink
which they have; of much liberty they take to themselves, of pride in
apparel, and other vices before noted: if the forenamed rule were duly
observed, many of those mischiefs would be avoided, and much better obedience
yielded.

. 37. Of servants yielding to do such things at their masters command, as they
cannot think to be most meet.
The second rule which servants must observe is this, that

Though they cannot in their judgment think that fit to be done which their
master will have done, yet upon his peremptory command they must yield to the
doing of it: It appears by Peter's answer to Christ that he did so, for being
commanded to let down his net for a draught, thus he answers, Master, we
have toyled all the night, and have taken nothing (here he shows that Luke 5.
5.
his opinion was that it would be in vain to let down their nets)
nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net (here is his obedience
against his opinion.) More clear is the example of Ioab for this purpose: when
the King commanded him to number the 2 Samuel 24. 2, etc.
people, he declared that he thought it a very unmeet thing to do, by this
phrase, Why does my Lord the King delight in this thing? yet against his
judgment he yielded to the Kings peremptory command, for it is said, that the
Kings word prevailed against Ioab.

Object. This is no fit example, because Ioab sinned in obeying.
Answ. Ioab cannot justly be charged with sin, because it was not simply
unlawful to number the people. David's sin was not in the act of numbering the
people, but in his mind which moved him to do it: for there was no just cause
to do it: only pride and curiosity moved him, as may be gathered out of his
own reason in these words, that I may know the number of the people. To do
such a thing only to know it, was curiosity. But why would he know it? surely
on a proud conceit that he had so many worthies, so many Captains, so many men
of war.

Out of Ioabs example servants may here learn in humility and reverence to
render some reasons to move their master not to press upon them that which
they think to be unmeet; but yet if their master will not hearken to their
reasons, but stand upon his authority, his word must prevail.

Contrary is their peremptorinesse, who by no means will be drawn to do any
thing at their masters command, which they themselves think not most meet to
be done. Such an one is that fool whom Solomon thus describes, Though thou
should Pro. 27. 22.
bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his
foolishness depart from him. These fools bring much mischief upon their own
pates in disobeying their masters: for exceedingly they provoke his wrath who
has power to take vengeance of them. Neither let them think to receive
comfort in their suffering, because they refuse an unmeet thing, for meetnesse
is not a sufficient warrant against unlawfulness. To disobey in a thing which
lawfully may be done, is unlawful: if therefore the pretext be only an unmeet
thing, meetnesse is preferred before lawfulness, and unlawfulness less
accounted of then vnmeetnesse.

. 38. Of servants forbearing to obey their master against God.
That the extent of servants obedience be not too far stretched, Restraint of
the extent of servants duties
the Apostle sets down an excellent limitation thereof: and that in these
four phrases, As unto Christ, As the servants of Christ, Doing the will of
God, As to the Lord; all which do show that the Obedience which servants yield
to their master See the cautions, Treat. 3.. 51, 52, etc.
must be such as may stand with their obedience to Christ. So that if masters
command their servants never so peremptorily to do any unlawful thing, that
is, any thing forbidden by Gods Nolite fieri serui hominum, i. nolite eis
parere cum turpia praecipiunt. Chrysostom. in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. Exo. 1. 17.
word, they may not yield to it. The midwiues of the Hebrew women did well in
refusing to do any thing to help forward the murderous practices of the King
of Egypt in slaying all the male-children of the Hebrews: it is expressly said,
that they feared God and did not as the King commanded them: so as their
disobedience in this kind was a token of their fear of God. In this case
Joseph is commended for not hearkening to his mistress: and the servants of
Saul for refusing to slaie the Genesis 39. 9. 1 Samuel 22. 17.
Lords Priests at their masters command. Thus if a master should command his
servant to kill, to steal, to forswear himself, to lie, to use false
measures and weights, to go to mass, or do any other unlawful thing, he
ought not obey him.

Again, if masters forbid their servants to do that which Seruis competit vt
obediant dominis in ijs quibus mandato Dei nihil derogatur. Basil.
God has commanded them to do, they must, notwithstanding their masters
prohibition, do it. The Rulers of Israel forbid the Apostles to preach, yet
because Christ had commanded them to preach, they would not forbear: nor would
Daniel forbear to pray to God, though the King and Nobles Ethic. defin. 75.
Act. 4. 19. Dan. 6. 10.
by express decree forbad him. So if a profane or popish master shall forbid
his servant to go to Church, or to hear the word, or to take the Sacrament,
or to dwell with his wife if he be married, or to make restitution of that which
he has fraudulently gotten, or any other bounden duty, herein they must say,
we ought to obey God rather then men. For when masters Act. 5. 29.
command and forbid any thing against God, they go beyond their commission,
and therein their authority cease.

Contrary to this restraint is both a parasiticall pleasing of masters: and
also a base fear of them. It is the property of a Ais? aio. Negas? nego.
Terent. in Eun.
parasite to say what a master will have him say, and deny what he will have
him deny, and so to do what he will have him to do. Doeg that fawning dog at
Saul's word slew all the Lords 1 Samuel 22. 18.
Priests: and Absoloms servants at his word killed Amnon: for 2 Samuel 13. 28, 29.
all the reason which they had to commit that murder was this speech of their
master, have not I commanded you? So prone are servants to sooth their masters,
as there is no sin so horrible which at their masters command they will not
be ready to do. Thus is that verified which the Prophet long since foretold,
Isa. 24 2.
like master like servant, like mistress like maid. It is also the property
of base fearful servants to do nothing but what their master will have them
do, and to forbear any duty, though never so necessary, that he forbids
them to do. What duty more necessary then prayer? We are commanded to pray
continually: yet the servants of Darius were content to 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17. Dan. 6.
7, etc.
forbear that duty thirty days together, because it was against the decree
of their Lord and King. The like is noted of the people in Christ's time, they
durst not make open profession of Ioh. 7. 13. and 9. 22.
Christ for fear of the Jews. So in our days many servants there be that
dare not make profession of the Gospel, nor go to Church, nor read the word,
nor perform other holy religious duties, which they know to be bounden duties,
for fear of their masters. Had not then the Apostle just cause to strike so
much upon this string as here he has done, expressly forbidding eie-seruice,
man-pleasing, and doing service to men, namely in opposition to God?

. 39. Of servants choosing good masters.
As a just consequence following from the forenamed extent and restraint of
servants duties, I may further gather these two lessons for servants.

1. It is very behouefull that servants make choice of good masters: at least
if it be in their power to choose.

2. It is behouefull that they continue and abide under good masters: at least
if they continue servants, and abide under any masters.

That these consequences justly follow as aforesaid, is evident: for seeing
servants are bound to obey in all things which are not against God, and must
obey in nothing but what is in the Lord, it is very requisite that servants be
under such masters as bear the Image of God in the inward disposition, and
grace of their heart, as well as in their outward function and place: and will
go along with God in using their authority, commanding nothing but what a
servant may do with a good conscience, and without transgressing against God:
and forbidding nothing that God has bound a servant to do. There will be
comfort in serving such masters: and our obedience to them will be obedience to
God. Such masters therefore must be chosen. Yea and with such must servants
abide, (if not with the very same, yet with such as they are, of the same
disposition) for if they go to other, their former comfort will be taken away,
and their servitude will seem so much the more miserable, by how much more
knowledge and experience they have had of the benefit of their former liberty
(for Qui fidelem habet dominum, saluo eius dominio, diligat vt patrem.
we may well call service under unconscionable masters servitude, and in
opposition thereunto, service under religious masters, liberty.) He therefore
that has a master that is faithful, due respect had to his authority, must
love him as a father, and Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12.
so abide with him.

For choice of good masters, note what is Exo. 12. 38.
recorded of many of the Egyptians and other people: they left their own
country, and went out with the Israelites: what should move them but
conscience of the true God whom they knew that Israel served? Now many of these
went out as servants, as may be gathered from those many Leu. 25. 45. Deuteronomy. 5.
14. and 12. 18. and 23. 15. and 23. 7.
laws which were made in the behalf of servants that were strangers, and in
special that were Egyptians. The knowledge which Ruth 1. 16.
Ruth had that Naomi her mother in law served the true God, moved her to leave
her own country, and to go as a servant with Naomi.

For abiding with good masters we have a worthy pattern in the twelve
Disciples. Ioh. 6. 66. etc.
When many of Christ's Disciples at large, went back, and walked no more with
him, Christ asking the twelve whether they also would go away, Peter in the
name of all the rest answered, Lord to whom shall we go? Thou have the words
of eternal life.

Contrary is the mind and practice of many servants: they never inquire after
the religious disposition of their master, nor care though he be popish, or
profane, so they may have good wages, diet and lodging: and yet by this means,
if at least there be any spark of Gods fear in their heart, they cast
themselves upon many sore temptations, and bring themselves into many hard
straits, and dangerous snares. And, if God open their eyes to see that wretched
condition whereinto they have implunged themselves, they will be forced to cry
out and complain as David did, when he was in foreign countries where he
could not freely serve his God, Psalm. 120. 5.
Woe is me that I soiourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar.

Much more contrary is their mind and disposition who refuse to serve
religious masters, and shun them most of all: or being in their service are
never quiet till they be out of it again. Of these we spoke. 16.
before.

Hitherto have we dealt about servants duties. The reasons which the Apostle
renders to enforce those duties remain to be declared.. 40. Of the first
motive, the place of masters.
The first reason which the Apostle uses to enforce servants I.
duties is implied under this phrase, as to Christ; it intimates the place of
a master, which is to be in Christ's stead. In this respect the title Lord is
given to a master. The word which the Apostle uses in Greek is that which in
the new testament (...).
answers to that proper Hebrew name of God Jehovah, and it sets forth the
absolute sovereignty of God, and power over all creatures: Matt. 28. 18.
which power Because the Father has given to his son as Mediator, God-man,
he is called the 1 Cor. 8. 6. (...).
one or only Lord: and because masters by virtue of their office and place
bear Christ's image, and stand in his stead, by communication of Christ's
authority to them, they are called Lords, yea also Psalm. 82. 6.
Gods (for that which a Magistrate is in the Commonwealth a master is in the
family)

Hence it follows that servants in performing duty to their master perform
duty to Christ, and in rebelling against their master they rebel against
Christ; as the Lord said to Samuel of the peoples rejecting his government,
they have not rejected 1 Samuel 8. 7.
thee, but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them. Is not
this a strong motive to provoke servants to all duty, and to restrain them
from rebellion? if it be well weighed what Christ is, it cannot be but a
weighty reason. For though masters should neither reward their good service,
nor revenge their ill service, yet will Christ do both.

. 41. Of the second motive, the place of servants.
The second reason is implied under this phrase, as servants II.
of Christ: it notes the place of a servant: which though it may seem to be a
mean and base place, yet is it indeed an honorable place. Men count it an
honor to be servants to a King: but Christ is higher then all Kings. On this
ground the Apostle says, Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: 1
Cor. 7. 21, 22.
and that upon this reason, He that is called in the Lord being a servant, is
the Lords freeman. This reason is to be noted against the conceit that most
have of a servants place, that it is so mean and base as there can be no
honor nor comfort in doing the duties thereof. But that is a foolish, and
unjust conceit: look to Christ the highest master, and there is as much
honor, and comfort in doing the duties of the lowest servants place, as of the
highest masters.

. 42. Of the third motive, Gods will.
The third reason is implied under this phrase, doing the III.
will of God, which declares the ground of servants subjection. God in his
word has plainly made it known that it is his pleasure that they who are
under the authority of masters should obey them, therefore as servants would
please God, they must obey: if they refuse to obey, they thwart the will of
God. This also is a motive of moment: for Gods will is that mark which every
one ought to aim at, and it is much urged by the Holy Ghost, as a general
reason to all duty in these and such like phrases, 1 These. 4. 3.
This is the will of God, 1 Pet. 2. 15.
So is the will of God: upon which ground we are exhorted to Ephef. 5. 17.
understand, and to Romans 12. 2.
prove what is the will of God.

Good reason there is to press this reason: for

1. Gods will is the very ground of goodness: things are therefore good
because they are agreeable to Gods will: Gods will gives the very being to
goodness.

2. Gods will is a rule to square all our actions by, even as the kings
statutes and proclamations are to his subjects.

3. It is a perfect rule (the law of the Lord is perfect) so as we Psalm. 19. 7.
may be sure not to swerue, if we hold close thereunto.

4. It is a sufficient rule, it will give every one (and among other, servants)
direction how to carry themselves in every thing they take in hand, yea in
every thing that appertains to them. For, Gods word is given to make us
perfect, thoroughly 2 Timothy 3. 17.
furnished unto all good works.

5. It is a good warrant to justify us in all our actions: so as, going along
with it, we need not care what any man can say against us. If a man be sure
that he have statute law, or the kings proclamation on his side, he is bold.

From this reason which is of such weight, I gather two propositions to add
force to this motive.

1. That servants obey their masters, is no arbitrary matter, but a necessary
duty: not left to his will whether he will do it or no, but a thing whereunto
he is bound: and that not only by civil constitutions of men, but also by a
divine institution of God: so as it is not only a matter of civil policy, but
also of conscience, to be done for conscience sake.

2. That no creature can dispense with servants, so as they should be exempted
from doing their duty to their master. If they could, they were greater then
God, and their will above Gods will. Among creatures, masters themselves are to
be reckoned: now because it is Gods will that servants should be in subjection,
their masters cannot exempt them from it. Masters may let them go free: but
retaining them as servants, they cannot exempt them from a servants subjection.
Wherefore though masters be careless in exacting duty, yet let servants be
conscionable in yielding duty, because it is Gods will.

. 43. Of the fourth reason, the reward of good service.
The fourth reason is plainly and largely expressed in these IIII.
words, Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the Sciat seruus Deum
redditurum seruitutis mercedem. Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12. Col. 3. 24.
same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. The general
sum whereof is a Declaration of the reward of good service. To which purpose
says the Apostle to servants in another place, Of the Lordye shall receive a
reward.

This first is to be noted to add force to the former reasons. For if any
ask, what if masters stand in Christ's stead, what makes that to the purpose?
surely it makes much to move servants: because masters stand in his room who
will reward that which is done for his sake.

If again they ask, what benefit is it to be Christ's servant? it may be
answered, very great: for Christ will reward all his servants.

If further it be asked, what is gotten by doing Gods will?

Answ. Even that which all aim at, reward for service.

As this adds weight to all the other reasons, so is it in it self a weighty
reason, as weighty as any can be to our corrupt nature. Hope of reward is it
which makes all sorts of people to take the pains which they do in their
several places. But having Treat. 1.. 127.
before handled this general point of reward, I will here more distinctly show
what kind of reward it is wherewith the Lord will recompense the good service
of faithful servants.

Gods reward is both of temporal and eternal blessings.

The temporal blessings which heretofore God has bestowed What reward God
gives to good servants.
on faithful servants, and which on that ground other like servants may
expect, are these especially.

1. He will move masters to respect such servants, as he moved Est. 6. 3.
Ahash-verosh to recompense the fidelity of Mordecai.

2. If masters fail therein, he will move strangers to recompense them: as he
moved Genesis 39. 21.
the Iaylor to favor Joseph when his master had cast him in prison: and and
41. 40.
Pharaoh to advance him to great dignity.

3. To draw the hearts of their masters and others the more unto them, he will
make the things which they take in hand to prosper. Thus did he bless Gen 39.
2.
Joseph, and and 24. 56.
Abraham's servant.

4. In dealing for themselves he will bless their labors, as he blessed Genesis
30. 43.
Iaakobs.

5. He will, when they come to keep servants, provide such servants for them,
as they were to their masters. Genesis 43. 23.
In Egypt God blessed Joseph with a faithful servant. David, who 1 Samuel 17. 34.
ventured his life to save his fathers sheep, had 2 Samuel 21. 17. and 23. 15.
many servants that ventured their lives for him.

To this purpose may be applied that proverb which Christ often uses, Luke 6.
38.
with what measure ye mete shall it be measured to you again.

The eternal reward is expressed in this phrase, Col. 3. 24.
the reward of the inheritance, for that inheritance is meant which Christ
mentions in this clause, Mat. 25. 34.
Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
beginning of the world, and Saint Peter in this, 1 Pet. 1. 4.
an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away,
reserved in heaven. What can be more said? What shall not be undergone for this
reward? How willingly do prentises pass over their prentiship in hope of a
temporary freedom of an earthly city? Genesis 29. 20.
Many years service were but as a few days to Iaakob because he liked his
reward. But behold here a greater reward, which we must needs like much better.
If this be not sufficient to move servants to all duty, I know not what can be
sufficient.

The eighth Treatise. Duties of Masters.
. 1. Of the heads of Masters duties.
EPHESIANS. 6. 9. And ye Masters do the same things unto them: forbearing
threatening: Knowing that your Master also is in heaven: neither is there
respect of persons with him.
IN the last place the duties of masters are declared by the Apostle, and that
in this verse, where he notes, 1. The kinds of their duties. 2. A Reason to
enforce the same.


The kinds are set forth Generally (do the same things.) Particularly
(forbearing threatening.)

The reason is taken from that subjection wherein masters are to an higher
master (knowing that your master also.) And it is amplified, 1. By the equal
subjection of masters and servants to that master (your also.) 2. By the place
where that master is (in heaven.) 3. By his property, in this phrase (neither
is there respect of persons with him.)


Because the several duties of masters are here but pointed at, and infolded
under general terms, I will (as in former treatises has been done) propound
a distinct order, whereby we may the better find out their duties, and handle
them one after another.

All may be drawn unto these two heads. 1. Care in choosing good servants. 2.
Conscience in well using them.


For well using their servants, masters must have an eye to their place, and
authority: and in respect thereof, 1. Wisely maintain their authority. 2.
Rightly manage the same.


The well managing of their authority is generally noted in this phrase, do
the same things: but more particularly in Col. 4. 1.
another place referred to these two branches 1. Justice. 2. Equity.


Of these in order.

. 2. Of masters choosing good servants.
The first thing that a man, who takes upon him to be a master, must take care
of, is to entertain good servants into his service. Psalm. 101. 6.
Mine eyes (says David) shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me: he that walks in a perfect way he shall serve me. What does
this phrase (mine eyes shall be upon the faithful) imply, but that he will
diligently and carefully inquire after such: yea mine eyes (says he) not
another man's eyes: he would not put all the trust upon others: he would
himself make what proof and trial he could. Such an emphasis has this
phrase (mine eyes) where Job 19. 27.
Job says; whom I shall see for my self, and mine eyes shall behold, and not
another for me.

1. Servants are of all other things (except wife and children) Reasons.
of best and greatest use. If then men be careful in well choosing other
things, as houses, land, household stuff, horses, and all manner of cattle (as
men are very circumspect therein) should they not be much more careful in well
choosing servants?

2. Thus will masters show that they seek, and aim at the good of their
family: yea and in their family at the good of Church and commonwealth: for
good members of a family are likeliest to prove profitable to Church and
commonwealth.

3. When good servants are chosen, there is hope of receiving the more good
from them, and doing more good unto them. They will be pliable to all good
admonition, docible by all good instruction, serviceable in all things they
take in hand.

Object. A master may make a bad servant to become a good one.
Answ. There is a great hazard and venture therein, especially if they be
grown to ripe years: no creature is easily tamed, or brought from the
natural course it has taken, after it is grown up: a bough that has grown
crooked many years together will hardly be made straight. It is not in man's
power to make a bad servant good: neither can man expect Gods blessing therein,
when he observes not a right course warranted by God.

Quest. What course is fittest for choice of servants? Direction for choosing
of servants.

1. If they be young, see how they have been from their infancy educated.
Great is the benefit of good education: and much good may be expected from
thence: for it is the means which God has sanctified for good.

But if they be grown to ripe years, choose such as fear God, such were they
upon whom Psalm. 101. 6.
David cast his eyes.

On this ground did Philem. verse 10.
Saint Paul advise Philemon to take Onesimus again, because grace was then
wrought in his heart.

1. Gods fear is the ground of all good obedience and Why such servants as
fear God are to be chosen.
faithfulness: note the examples of such good and faithful servants as are
commended in Scripture, and you shall find them all to fear God.

2. Such will not only be diligent in their work, but they will also
faithfully call upon God to prosper those things which they take in hand in
their masters behalf, instance the example of Genesis 24. 12.
Abraham's servant.

3. God will have such respect unto those servants which fear his name, as for
their sakes to bless their masters house. Thus was Genesis 39. 5.
Potiphars house blessed for Joseph's sake.

2. Make some trial of their fitness to that calling, work and service
whereunto thou shall put them. From such there may be hope of profit and
benefit by their service. Genesis 29. 14.
Laban made trial of Iaakob a month before he couenanted for any long
continuance.

3. Take such especially as are of mean and poor estate, and know not how to
maintain themselves but by service. Thus will a double work of charity be
done therein: and thus may thou look for better service: for commonly such
are most industrious, and most obedient to their masters.

Object. When men have taken all the care they can in their choice, they may be
deceived.
Answ. 1. Then much more likely is it, that if they be careless therein, they
shall be deceived.

2. Diligent, and wise search, is a means to find out the disposition and
ability of servants.

3. If having used the means men be deceived, they may have the more comfort
in bearing the cross, because they have not wittingly or carelessly pulled it
upon themselves.

. 3. Of masters carelessness in choosing servants.
Contrary is their carelessness, who are ready to receive any into their house,
even Atheists, Papists, swearers, swaggerers, profane wretches, unclean
persons, and such like, against whom David protests, he would not have him
that works deceit to dwell in Psalm. 101. 7.
his house; nor him that tells lies to tarry in his sight. They who
entertain such, make their houses to be cages of unclean birds, seminaries of
wicked persons, and unprofitable members: for one scabbed sheep is enough to
infect a whole flock. No marvel though many mischiefs fall upon such a
family: for a man were as good bring so many Snakes and Adders into his house,
as such persons: yea with them is brought Gods curse. Can any good then be
looked for? Such foolish masters regard neither themselves, nor their household:
no nor yet Church or Commonwealth. If none would entertain such, it might be
a means to make them alter their condition.

Many are not only careless in choosing good servants, but also except against
such as are religious; thinking it a matter of reproach to entertain them. By
which conceit they often put away Gods blessing from their house.

Others so stand upon a great portion of money with a prentise, or a clerk, or
other servant, as they will take none but rich men's children. Whence it comes
to pass, that this point (which is a great point) of charity is neglected:
persons most unfit for service are entertained, and such many times as scorn
to do service. Thus their masters grow weary of them: the servants lose their
time: never prove to be their crafts-masters: and their parents repent the
giving of such a portion with them.

. 4. Of masters maintaining their authority.
After that masters have chosen good servants, their duty is well to use them:
which by reason of the difference betwixt masters and servants cannot be well
done, except masters wisely maintain their authority. A master therefore must
be able 1 Timothy 3. 4. (...).
well to rule his own house: this is a duty which the Apostle in particular
requires of a Bishop, who is master of an house, but it appertains in
general to all masters of families. Women also who by virtue of their places
are mistresses, are commanded 1 Timothy 5. 14. (...).
to guide the house, or to rule, and perform the part of a mistress therein.
It was the Mat. 8. 9.
Centurions commendation, that having servants under him, he had them at his
command.

1. Gods image and authority, which a master carries, is thus preserved.

2. Thus shall a master have much better service done. Not one servant of a
thousand, that is not kept under authority, will do good service. A like
duty to this was enjoined to an husband in relation to a wife, Treat. 4.

. 4. Some of the reasons, directions, and other points there handled, may be
here applied. Read it therefore.
For this end three things are to be observed. Direction.


1. That masters carry themselves worthy of their place, and worthy of that
honor which is due to them: which may best be done by making themselves a
pattern of such good things as in their places appertain to them. Jos. 24. 15.
I and my house will fear the Lord, says Iosuah: he would not only put them
to it, but he also would do it, he would go before them. I will behave my
self wisely, I will walk within my house with a perfect heart, says Psalm.
101. 2.
David.

2. That masters keep their servants in awe and fear. 1 Timothy 3. 4.
Children must be kept in subjection: much more servants.

3. That masters do the things which they do in their carriage toward their
servants with authority: Command, forbid, rebuke (to use Tit. 2. 15.
the Apostles phrase) with all authority. The manner of speech which the
Centurion used to his servants ( Mat. 8. 9.
go, come, do this) savor of authority. So the Church taking upon her the
person of a mistress, uses a word of authority, Cant. 3. 5.
I charge you not to do this.

. 5. Of masters making their authority to be despised.
The aberrations in the defect contrary to the forenamed duty How masters lose
their honor.
and point of wisdom, are many: as

1. When masters carry themselves basely and abiectly before 1. By baseness.
their servants: being light in their behavior, foolish in their carriage,
given to drunkenness, uncleanness, lewd company, and other vices. Nabal was
such an one: for his servant could say of him, 1 Samuel 25. 17.
He is a son of Belial. David, though he did not give himself over to such
foul sins as these are, yet he often failed in an unseemly carriage before his
servants, as when 1 Samuel 21. 13.
he changed his behavior, and fained himself mad, and scrabled on doors, and
let his spittle fall down upon his beard: and again, 2 Samuel 19. 3, 5.
when he gave such reins to his passion, for the death of his traitorous son
Absalom, as his people being ashamed stole away from him, and Ioab his servant
was forced roundly to tell him of it, saying, thou have shamed this day the
faces of all thy servants, etc.

Mistresses often lose their authority by conspiring with their servants to go
abroad, take away goods, gossip, and do such other like things privily without
their husbands consent: they make themselves thereby slaves to their servants,
not daring to do any thing which may offend their servants, lest they should
discover to their masters such lewd pranks as their Mistresses did.

2. When masters are too remiss and sheepish: entreating and 2. By remisnes.
praying their servants to do such things as they ought to command and require
at their hands: and if it be not done, all their remedy is patience, or else
to do it themselves. Howsoever this might be counted meekness, and
gentleness toward equals and strangers, over whom we have no authority, yet
toward servants it is too base remissness: yea it is a relin quishing of that
power which God has given, and whereof God will take an account.

3. When masters suffer their servants to be their companions, 3. By
familiarity.
playing, drinking, reuelling with them, and saying (as it is in the proverb)
hail fellows met. Thus servants often take liberty to presume above their
master: for men are naturally prone to ambition; and, if an inch be given, they
will take an ell. They who in this kind so far debase themselves, as to give
their servants power over their own body, do make both themselves, and their
true lawful bedfellow to be despised: themselves, in that such servants as are
so made one flesh, will think to keep in awe such a master or mistress, as
they have known, through fear of revealing that sin: their bedfellow, in
that such servants will think to be maintained, and boulstered up by the
master or mistress, whom they have so known. On this ground was Genesis 16. 3, 4.
Sarah despised in the eyes of Hagar her maid.

4. When masters are ouer-ruled by their servants to do any 4. By letting go
the reins.
unjust or unlawful thing: as 2 Chro. 14. 17.
Ioash, who by his servants was drawn to idolatry: and Ier. 38. 5.
Zedekiah, who gave the Prophet Jeremiah into his servants hands, using this
base and abject speech, Ier. 38. 5.
The King is not he that can do any thing against you. Thus will servants
soon prove masters: and if they once come to this high pitch to rule, rather
then to be ruled, they will quickly prove intolerable. For Pro. 30. 22.
this is one of the four things noted by the Wiseman, which the earth cannot
bear, namely, a servant when he reigns: and Eccl. 10. 5, 7.
this is one of those evils which proceed from rulers, that servants ride upon
horses, that is, are advanced above their place and degree: whence it
follows, that Eccl. 10. 5, 7.
Governors walk as servants upon the earth, they are dejected below their
place and degree. It falls out in this case betwixt servants and masters, as
betwixt scoales, or balances; if the weights that use to lie in one balance
to keep it down be taken away, it will suddenly fly up, and so the other
balance will be kept down.

. 6. Of masters too great rigor.
The contrary in the excess is too great rigor and aufterity manifested in
look, speech, and actions.

1. In look, when a master cannot cast a good eye on his servant. Genesis 31. 2,
5.
Iaakob was much discountenanced by the countenance of his master. Many masters
by their continual frowning brows, and fiery eyes, do much terrify their
servants.

2. In speech, when masters cannot give a good word to their servants, but if
they be moved never so little, cast upon them all the reproachful names that
they can call to mind: little thinking of this fearful doom, Mat. 5. 22.
Whosoever shall say, thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

Thus did Saul manifest a malicious and mischievous mind against Jonathan and
David by the foul language he gave. Some have such a froward and perverse
tongue, as they can never speak directly to their servants: but if they
command or forbid a thing, they will do it after such a manner as their
servant can scarce tell what they mean: and this not only when their servant
has offended them, but in their best mood. So shrewish are others, as their
tongues seldom lie still: but they are ever chiding upon every small occasion:
whereby it comes to pass that their servants are no more moved with it, then
the Doves, and Stares that continually abide in Belfraies, are moved with the
ringing of bells. Such bitterness also is mixed with the childings of many, as
they belch out of their black mouths, most direful imprecations. What can be
said of such tongues, but that they are Iam. 3. 6.
set on fire of hell? As other aberrations wherein masters are reproved, are to
be applied to mistresses, so this especially. For mistresses do commonly most
offend in shrewishness of speech.

3. In actions, when masters are too frequent, and too furious Quamuis dominus
seruo praestet, tamen se aequalem iudicet quatenus homo existit. Constit.
Apost. l. 4. c. 12.
strikers: striking their servants on every occasion, not caring how they
strike. In these and other like evidences of too much austeritie and plain
arrogance masters forget that they are men. Though for outward order a master
be more excellent then a servant, yet as a man he ought to judge himself
equal. This extreme can be no good means to maintain authority: but it is a
plain abuse thereof. Masters ought so Serui colant potius te quam timeant.
Senec. epist. 47.
to carry themselves as their servants may rather reverence, then dread them.

. 7. Of masters commanding power restrained to things lawful. Extent of
masters power.

That a master may the better know how to maintain his authority, I will
distinctly declare the extent of his power, and that in these four
particulars, 1. In Commanding. 2. In Correcting. 3. In ordering the marriage of
their servants. 4. In disposing their person.

Within the lists of these two virtues Justice and Equity (whereunto all the
duties which masters owe their servants shall. 20, 21, etc.
afterward be referred) must the commanding power of masters be bounded. 1.
Justice requires two things, 1. A restraint of masters commandments. 2. An
execution thereof.



The restraint is unto Gods law, that a master command nothing against it, but
what is agreeable to it. Abishai would Nothing unlawful to be commanded by
masters. 1 Samuel 26. 9.
feign have had David's warrant to have killed Saul: but David was so far from
commanding him to do it, as he kept him from it.

Masters are but subordinate ministers under God: they must therefore command
nothing against his law. As a Judge, high-Sheriffe, and all other officers
under the King, must make the Kings law the ground of all those things which
they require of the Kings subjects: so masters must make Gods law the ground of
all those things which they require of their servants, who are also the
servants of Christ. Besides, to what purpose is it to command that which a
servant may and must refuse to do? But in no Treat. 7.. 38
unlawful thing may he obey.

. 8. Of masters presuming above their authority.
Contrary is the arrogancy and presumption of many masters, who make their
own will the rule of their servants obedience. This must needs be a leaden
rule, which may be bowed this way, that way, and every way, because of the
flexible and variable humor of man. Hence is it that many most vile and
horrible things are commanded, because they are agreeable to the commanders
humor. Absalom bid his servants commit a most detestable murder upon his own
brother, and note how he presses it, Have not I commanded you? 2 Samuel 13. 28.


More presumptuous is he that takes upon him to be the The Popes presumption.
great commander of all Christians, the Pope of Rome, and other masters and
governors of Jesuits, Friars, Monks, and other like orders, who command such
as are under their authority to commit treasons, raise rebellions, kill Kings,
and do other like execrable villainies.

And to justify the Pope from whom all inferior governors receive their
power, and by whose will they must be ruled, these blasphemous positions do
Papists hold of his power, He can do all things of right as God. He is as God
having Extrauag. de mayor. and obed. Alban. in lib. de potestat. Pap. and
Eccles. Gratian. in Decret. did. 40.
on earth fullness of power. If he shall draw with him innumerable souls of
men into hell, yet none may say to him, what do thou? Does not the Apostles
2 Thessalonians. 2. 4. In Ecclesia cath. semper creditum est Romans Pontificem posse sua
authoritate leges far, quae in conscientia obligent. Bellar. de Romans Pontif.
l. 4. c. 15.
description of that man of sin, the son of perdition, agree to him of whom
those things are spoken? Is he not in Papists account, as God, showing himself
that he is God? Which is further confirmed by that power which they give him of
making laws to bind the conscience, and coining new articles of faith.

Not only popish, but profane masters also too much exceed in this presumptuous
use of their power above their power: as they who enjoin their servants to
kill, to steal, to swear, to forswear, to lie, to give false measures, and
weights, to go to mass, to profane the Sabbath, with other like sins. In
all these, and all other things like to these, being against Gods law, masters
have no power to command: they go above their commission: and shall
accordingly answer for it.

. 9. Of masters commanding servants to do their duty.
2. The execution of a masters commanding power consists in those things
which God has enjoined as bounden duties. These a master by virtue of his
authority must command his servants to do: as to worship God, to sanctify
his Sabbath, to be diligent and conscionable in his calling, with other like
duties, which God compriseth under these words, the way of the Lord,
righteousness and judgment: and says that he knew that Abram would command
his household to do them. Genesis 18. 19.


The charge given to masters in the fourth commandment concerning servants,
(thou nor thy man-seruant, nor thy maidseruant) Exo. 20. 10.
proves as much. Josiah is commended for causing his 2 Chr. 34. 32.
people to stand to the covenant of God. On this ground if a master have
servants that are papists, separatists, or profane persons, he ought to command
them, and cause them to go to the holy ordinances of God.

It is one of the principal ends why God has given power and authority to
some over others, that by their authority they may cause them which are under
them to observe the commandments of God: even as inferior officers have
authority given them, to see the Kings laws kept.

. 10. Of the sin of masters in suffering servants to neglect their duty.
It is contrary to that commanding power which God has given to masters, to
suffer their servants to omit, and neglect those bounden duties which God has
commanded them: as if a servant be so popish or profane as to refuse to go to
the word, or Sacrament, or to perform any duty whereunto he is bound, to let
him alone. Though they themselves do those duties, and though they do not
hinder and keep their servants from doing them, yet if they cause not their
servants also to do them, they make themselves accessarie to their servants
sin.

Object. Every man's conscience is free, and cannot be forced; therefore masters
may not compel servants to such things as are against their conscience.

Answ. Though the conscience be free to a man, and out of another power, yet
their outward actions are not free: and though faith, piety, righteousness,
nor any grace can be forced into men, yet they may be forced to use the means
which God has sanctified for the breeding and increasing of them. Though they
cannot be forced to have a religious and righteous heart, yet they may be
forced to do religious and righteous duties: or if a master cannot force
these, yet he may and ought to do his uttermost endeavor: by which means
though he cannot free his servant from death, yet he shall free his own soul
from the guilt of his death.

. 11. Of a masters wisdom in ordering things indifferent.
Equity has respect to those things which are in a masters power to command
or not command: such are all civil actions as concern himself, concerning
the particulars whereof God has given no direct charge for an absolute
performance of them: as to go of such an errand, to do such a message, to
dispatch such a business. Concerning these things I may say of a masters
power, as the Apostle does of a parents power in 1 Cor. 7. 36, 37.
another case; If he sees it meet to be done, and commands his servant to
do it, he does well, he sins not. If he sees it not meet to be done, and
commands it not, he does also well, he sins not. Of this kind of things
speaks the Centurian, Matt. 8. 9.
where he says, I say to one, go, to another, come, to a third, do this.

The mark which masters must aim at in commanding or forbidding these, must
be expediency: for all things that are 1 Cor. 10. 23.
lawful, are not expedient. Expediency depends much upon circumstances, and
consequences which may follow upon the doing of any thing: in observing whereof
the wisdom of him who has power to have a thing done, or not done, especially
appears. When David suffered not Hushai his good friend, 2 Samuel 15. 33, 34.
and wise counselor, to go with him when he fled from Absalom, but bid him
return to the city and there abide, he had an eye to the good consequence
that might follow thereupon. And when Ioab commanded Cushi rather then Ahimaaz
to 2 Samuel 18. 20, 21.
carry the news of Absoloms death, he had an eye to the meetnesse of the
persons, and to the kind of message.

To apply this to our purpose, Equity requires that masters (in commanding
things indifferent, which they have power to command or not to command) have an
eye to their servants ability, sex, age, disposition, conscience, and other
like circumstances, that the thing which they command be somewhat agreeable to
them, not above their ability, not unbeseeming their sex, not unfitting their
age, not thwarting their disposition, not against their conscience.

. 12. Of masters offense against expediency.
It is contrary to equity for a master to regard only himself, and his own
mind, even in things that are lawful. Paul was not 1 Cor. 10. 33.
of this mind, when he said, He sought not his own profit: no nor his own
will. Expediency and inexpediency were great motives unto him, to forbear
things which were otherwise lawful: yet little is this regarded by many: for

1. Many command things to the very uttermost of their servants strength, if
not above it, (as Pharaoh) or else things dangerous, Exodus 5. 7.
which may bring much mischief upon them. David 2 Samuel 23. 17.
was touched in heart for moving only by a wish his servants to fetch him water
with the danger of their lives.

2. Others against comeliness put men to do maids works, and maids to do
men's work.

3. Others upon mere partiality keep under old and good servants, and
prefer much younger before them.

4. Others will forcibly make servants do things against their natural
disposition, as to handle, yea and eat such things as they cannot endure to
touch or see.

5. Others in doubtful matters will urge and press them against their
conscience.

Howsoever in these and other such like things not unlawful, servants ought to
do what they can to satisfy their masters command, if he be peremptory in
urging them: yet ought not a master to be too peremptory in pressing his
authority and power.

. 13. Of the power of masters to correct their servants.
The second point wherein a masters power consists is correction: which may
be given by looks, words, or deeds.

By a man's look his anger and wrath against another is manifested. (...)
In Hebrew the same word signifies a face, and wrath: because wrath soonest
shows it self in a man's face. It is noted of Cain, that being very wrath his
countenance fell Si quis in domo per inobedientiam domesticae paci aduersatur,
corripiatur seu verbo, seu verbere, sea quo. libet alio genere poenae iusto
atque licito. Aug. de Ciu. Deil. 19. c. 16.
down, Genesis 4. 5. Now the manifestation of a masters wrath against his servant
is a correction.

But words whether of rebuke, or threatening, do much more declare the same.
This phrase which Solomon uses Pro. 29. 19. (a servant will not be corrected
with words) shows that there is a correction by words: and though it be
negatiuely propounded, yet does it not imply that correction by words is not to
be used to a servant, but rather, if thereby he be not moved, that blows must
be added thereto: which is a correction by deeds, whereof Christ makes mention
in the parable of those servants that according to the greatness of their
fault are Luke 12. 47.
to be beaten with many stripes. It is therefore in a masters power to correct
his servant with stripes, or blows. Which being so, I will show, 1. How far
his power herein extends. 2. How it is to be ordered.


. 14. Of the restraint of masters power: that it reaches not to their servants
life.
Concerning the extent of a masters power in correcting his servant, this
question is to be resolved, Whether a master have power for any fault to take
away his servants life.

Answ. His power reaches not so far, as is evident by these reasons.

1. There is no precept, nor approved example, nor any other warrant out of
Gods word for it. The Jews had great power over such servants as were
strangers: Of them they might Leu. 25. 44, 45, 46.
buy bondmen and bond-maids: they might have them for a possession: and take
them for an inheritance for their children after them, to be bondmen for ever:
they might be put to the most toyling, droyling, base, and abject works that
they had, as drawing water, hewing wood, and the like; but yet their masters
Ios. 9. 27.
had not power over their lives.

2. A master might not dismember his servant: if unawares he did smite out an
eye or tooth of his servant, he must make a recompense: which was to let him
go free. Much less therefore Exodus 21. 26.
might he take away his servants life.

3. If a servant died under his masters hand when he corrected him, though he
intended not wilfully to murder him, that master was to be punished. It was not
therefore lawful for Exodus 21. 20.
a master wittingly to kill a servant.

4. The power of life is proper to the public magistrate, who does all things
in open public places, that so there may be many witnesses of his just
proceeding. If masters had this power, many might privily be put to death, and
no man know for what cause, as it is in popish inquisitions.

5. Si Dominus seruum ceciderit, vel lethale vulnus inflixerit, reus homicidij
sit. Justin. Cod. l. 9. tit. 18.
The approved laws of men make it wilful murder for a master to slay his
servant wittingly, though the servants fault be never so heinous. Neither the
authority of the master, nor desert of the servant, shall exempt the master
that slays his servant from the guilt and punishment of felony.

Object. In ancient times masters had this power.
Answ. They never of right had it, though some might exercise it. Among Gods
people it was never exercised in any age of the world. That liberty which was
taken, was among the heathen: and yet among them as polities came to be more
Apud Gentes animaduertere possumus Dominis in seruos vitae, necisque potestatem
fuisse. Sed hoc tempore nullis hominibus qui sub imperio nostro sunt, licet
fine causa legibus cognita in seruos suos supra modum saeuire Nam ex constit.
Antonini qui sine cause seruum suum occiderit, non minus puniri iubetur, quam
si alienum seruum occiderit. Justin. Jnstit. l. 1. Tit. 8. Domini mitiores esse
debent. Cypr. Testim. l. 3. c. 73.
and more ciuilly governed, that usurped liberty by the laws of Magistrates
was much restrained: and when Emperors and Kings became Christians, it was
utterly taken away.

Object. If a man take an enemy by war, he has power to kill him.
Answ. If in the time of the war he slay him not, but then spare him, and
take him as a captive, and make him his servant, though but a bondslaue, he
has not power of his life.

. 15. Of masters excess in correcting servants.
Contrary to their just and due power do they, who in their rage stab their
servants, or otherwise make them away: yea they also who so unmercifully and
vnmeasurably beat them with rod, cudgel, or any other thing, as death follow
thereupon: for many there be who having once begun to strike, know not when
to cease, but lay on as if they were striking stocks and blocks, and not their
own flesh. God foresaw that masters were prone to such cruelty, and therefore
Deuteronomy. 25. 3.
set a stint number of stripes, which none that beat another might exceed.

Among these may be reckoned such desperate masters as in their mood will
strike their servant with any thing that comes next to hand, be it heavy,
cragged, hard, or sharp, they care not ( Pro. 26. 18.
As a mad man who casts firebrarnds, arrows, and death.) These things may
endanger a servants life, if not, they may break his head, or otherwise wound,
bruise, and lame him.

It is beyond a masters power by any correction to impair life, health, or
strength of his servant, or any way in his body to disable him from doing that
which otherwise he might have been able to do.

If masters, no not for punishment of any sin, may not take away or endanger
the life of his servant, what may we think of such masters, as without any
fault of their servants, cause them to be made away by putting them upon some
desperate attempt, either to maintain their own quarrel, or for some other
unjust end? 2 Samuel 11. 15.
David dealt thus with Uriah: but afterward he Psalm. 51. 14.
sorely repented this part of injustice. At another 2 Samuel 23. 15, etc.
time when three of his servants had fetched him water, which he longed for,
with ieopardy of their lives, though in safety they returned, yet his heart
smote him for his longing, and he would not drink of that water because they
had ventured their lives to fetch it.

But what may we say of such masters, as cause their servants for their sakes
to commit felony, murder, treason, rebellion, and such other things, as cause
the public magistrate to vnsheath his sword against them, and cut them off? We
noted this. 8.
before to be a grienous fault in regard of the unlawfulness of the thing:
here further we may note it to be much more heinous in regard of the mischief
that follows thereupon, which is the loss of their servants life: so as thus
they make themselves accessory to a detestable sin, and guilty of the blood
of their servant.

. 16. Of masters ordering that correction they give to their servants.
2. That masters may well order that correction which they give to their
servants, difference must be put betwixt the age, sex, disposition, and faults
of those whom they correct.

1. Masters ought not to be so forward to strike such as are grown in years,
as the younger sort. Years bring understanding, and a rebuke will make one of
understanding more sorry for a fault, and more careful to amend it, The
direction prescribed to parents (Treat. 6.. 47.) for well ordering that
correction which they give to their children, may in many points be here fitly
applied. Read it. then blows: smart more works upon the younger sort. But if
notwithstanding their years they be stout, and will not regard words, their
stoutnesse. must be beaten down with blows. Pro. 19. 25, 29.
Smite a scorner, says the wise man: and again, Judgments are prepared for
scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.

Seeing servants in years are in this case to be corrected, it is further
requisite to put a difference betwixt the kind or measure of correction which
is given to them, and to the younger sort: if they be corrected as children,
they may either make a toy of it, or the more disdain at it. Pro. 20. 30.
Heris in famulos saeuitia adhibenda est, si aliter teneri non possunt. Cic.
Offic. l. 2.
Blewnesse, wound, and stripes piercing into the inward parts of the belly, are
a purging medicine against evil, to stout servants of ripe years.

2. If there be a master and mistress joint governors over an house, it is
fittest for the master to correct men-seruants, the mistress maids. Seruam
verberare viro maximae ignominiae est. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
Abraham put his maid over to Sarah in such a case. Yet if a maid should wax
stout, and mannish, and turn against her mistress, she being weak, sickly,
with child, or otherwise unable to master her maid, the master may and must
beat down her stoutnesse and rebellion: Exo. 21. 20.
so much did the law of God permit.

3. If servants be of an ingenious disposition, willing and forward to do that
which belongs unto them, sorry when they have committed a fault, and careful
to amend their faults, many things may be passed over in them, which must be
corrected in others. To this may be applied the counsel of the wiseman, Take
no heed to all the words that are Eccl. 7. 21.
spoken.

4. Correction must be measured according to the greatness -- Adsit Regula
peccat is quae poenas irroget aequas: Nec scutica dignum horribili sectere
flagello. Horat. l. 1. Sat. 3.
of the fault punished, and the circumstances whereby the fault may justly be
aggrauated. The servant that knew his masters will and did it not shall be
beaten with many stripes: But he that knew not and did commit things worthy of
stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes, Luke 12. 47, 48.

Many aberrations are daily committed contrary to every branch of this
direction, in that masters and mistresses in exercising this part of their
power are carried away with passion, and do that which they do in this kind
after their own pleasure. Thus they turn a duty into sin, and by undue
correcting of their servants provoke God to correct them in his wrath, either
here or in the world to come.

. 17. Of masters power over their servants in and about their marriage.
The third point to be noted concerning a masters power over his servant, is
about his servants marriage. Sundry questions are moved about this point, which
I will briefly resolve.

1. Quest. Have masters power to order and dispose their servants marriage as
they please?
Answ. No, not without the free consent of the servants themselves: for
marriages must be made with the free consent of the parties that are married.

Object. The law implies that a master has power to give Exo. 21. 4.
his servant a wife, for it shows whose those children shall be that are
borne to that servant, to whom a master has given a wife.

Answ. 1. That law is to be understood of such servants as being strangers were
bond-slaues, over whom masters had a more absolute power then over others.

2. The masters power of giving did not simply force the servant to marie the
party so given: but restrained the servant from marying any other then whom the
master should give.

2. Quest. Is not a masters power in the matter of marriage as great over a
servant, as a parents over a child?
Answ. No. See the reason Treat. 5.. 20.

3. Quest. May a master deny his servant liberty to marie?
Answ. Yea, for the time that the servant has couenanted to be a servant with
his master. For that time a servant is part of his masters goods, and
possessions. As bond servants were a masters possession for ever: so couenanted
servants are his possession for the time of their covenant. When God gave the
devil leave to seize on all that Job had, by virtue of that Job 1. 15, 16.
permission he seized on all kinds of Jobs servants bond and free, as well as
on his goods: which he could not have done, if Jobs servants had not been as
his goods.

Yet notwithstanding if servants shall make it known to their master, that
necessity requires they should marie, such respect ought to be had to the
chastity even of servants, as in this case I may use the phrase with the
Apostle uses in reference to children, Let them be married. 1 Cor. 7. 36.


4. Quest. What if servants marie without consent of masters, is that marriage
nullified thereby?
Answ. No. The marriage being otherwise rightly performed, Quod fieri non debet
factum valet.
remains a firm marriage: though the servants in so doing have sinned: for
which their master may justly punish them.

5. Quest. May a master keep his servants so married without his consent from
their bed-fellowes?
Answ. He may exact the whole time of his covenant for service: but that power
which by the bond of marriage husbands and wives have over one another bodies,
suffers 1 Cor. 7. 3, 4.
them not to be altogether separated one from another. Besides, our law freeth
a maid-seruant when she is married, from her masters covenant.

. 18. Of masters rigor in forcing marriages on servants: or in separating man
and wife.
Contrary to a masters power do they, who force their servants to marie whom
they like not: as when a master has defloured his maid, to cover his shame he
will make one of his servants marie her.

They also do contrary to their power who seek to separat their servants that
are married from their bedfellow: some will keep the man at his house day and
night from his wife, and so the wife from her husband: others will send one of
them into remote parts of the land, where the other shall not know: yea others
will be sure to keep them one from another, for they will send one of them
beyond sea for many years together, if not for ever. These practices are
against the law of marriage, and too rigorous and unjust.

. 19. Of masters power to dispose their servants persons.
The fourth point to be noted of a masters power over his servants respects
their persons, which so properly belong to a master for the time of their
service, as he may not only keep them himself for his own service, but also
pass them over, and give, or sell them to another. By Gods law not only Leu.
25. 39, 44.
strangers, but Jews also might be sold for servants.

The customs and statutes of our land do also permit masters Masters care in
putting off servants.
to make over their servants from one to one: and on their deathbeds to
bequeath them to whom they will, even as their goods and possessions.

That this power be not abused, in the executing thereof, masters must
principally respect the good of their servants: and for that end put them over
to fit masters, such masters as may do them good and not evil, all the time
of their abode with them, and service under them.

Contrary hereunto do they, who aim merely at their own advantage, not
caring to whom they put over their servants, so they may make gain thereby.
Some will sell them, namely, when they have them beyond sea, to Turks and
Infidels; some to Papists, and other Idolaters; some to profane persons; some
to cruel inhumane beasts; some to men of unlawful trades; some to men of no
trades. Such masters as make their servants over to such as these are, or like
to these, shall answer for all the wrong is done to them.

. 20. Of masters well managing their authority.
This Apostle in Coloss. 4. 1. (...).
another place gives this charge to masters, Give unto your servants that
which is just and equal.

By doing these two things masters shall well manage their authority.

Justice respects the place, and service of servants. Difference betwixt just
and equal dealing.


Equity respects their mind, and manner of doing service.

All servants, in that they are servants, and do their masters work, must
have that which of right belongs to servants. This is Justice.

Such servants as bear an especial love and liking to their masters, doing
service not by constraint, or with eye-seruice, as men-pleasers, but in
singleness of heart with good will, and all good faithfulness, seeking to the
uttermost of their power, their masters good, must be accordingly respected and
dealt withal. This is Equity. As the Apostle compriseth Justice under this
phrase (do the same things) for service give due recompense: so more
especially he compriseth Equity under it: for servants good will and more then
usual respect of their masters, let masters return good will, and more then
ordinary respect to servants. S. Peter notes these two virtues under two
other words, good, 1 Pet. 2. 18.
gentle: A masters goodness has relation to Justice: his gentleness to
Equity.

. 21. Of masters endeavoring the salvation of their servants.
That Justice which is required of masters respects the soul, body, and
estate of their servants.

In respect of their souls good, masters must seek the spiritual I. Iusti
patres secundum haec temporalia bona, filiorum sortem a seruorum condition
distinguebant: ad Deum autem colendum, in quo aeterna bona speranda sunt,
omnibus domus suae membris pari dilectione consulebant. Aug. de Ciu. Dei l. 19.
c. 15.
edification of their servants. When Zacheus first believed, Christ said,
Salvation is come to this house (Luke 19. 9.) why to this house, rather then to
this person, but because he knew that Zacheus would do the duty of a good
master, and seek the salvation of his household? Herein must masters bear an
impartial respect to all in their house: as the holy Fathers, who though about
temporal goods they put difference betwixt the place of children, and
condition of servants; yet in serving God, wherein eternal happiness is
looked for, they did with an equal respect provide for all the members of
their house. The proofs alleged for servants obedience to masters care in
this point, do show that this duty appertains to masters. See Treat. 7.. 15.

The respect which masters owe to God, themselves, their servants, the Church,
and Commonwealth where they live, requires as much.

1. God has commanded as much (Deuteronomy. 6. 7.) as this charge implies, Thou
shall talk of my Laws when thou sit in thine house: and God has
manifested his approbation thereof, by commending Abraham for commanding his
children and household to keep the way of the Lord, Genesis 18. 19.

2. Masters themselves reap great benefit by a faithful discharge De salute
eorum qui in domo tua sunt sollicitus, ac peruigil existas, quia pro omnibus
tibi subiectis ratione^ Domino reddes. Aug. de salut. docum. cap. 29.
of this duty: and that both by discharging a good conscience to God, (who
requires this at their hands, in that he has made them prophets and priests
in their house, as well as kings; and will require an account of them for all
that are under their government:) and also by bringing their servants to do
more faithful service to them. For there is no such means to stir up
servants to do all good duty, as the fear of God planted in their hearts.
That servant that shall find true grace either first wrought, or further
increased in him by his mastersmeanes, will think him self so beholding to
such a master, as he shall never be able to make any sufficient recompense, and
therefore will endeavor to do what good service he can in way of thankfulness:
he will not only be faithful and diligent in his business, but he will call
upon God to prosper his service for his masters good, and to recompense that
kindness which his master has done to him.

3. No earthly thing that a master can do for his servant (be it portion of
money, preferment to any place of profit or credit, or skill in a good trade
and calling) can be comparable to the edifying of a servant in grace.

4. Servants well instructed in piety are likeliest to prove most profitable
not only to the family, but also to the Church and Commonwealth where they
live.

That masters may the better edify their servants,

1. They must daily instruct them in the principles of religion, Directions for
edifying servants.
and all duties of piety: admirable is the profit which will arise from a
daily and constant use of religious exercises: though but a little time be
spent at once, yet will much knowledge be gained by a frequent use of them.
This duty is so much the more necessary, because public Ministers cannot
take such particular notice of every servant in their Parishes, as masters may
in their families.

2. Masters must cause their servants to go to the public ministry of the
word, and worship of God, to be further built up thereby, and confirmed in
their faith. Masters under the Law were Exo. 12. 44.
commanded to let their servants eat of the Passover, which was a solemn
sacrament. The Law which enioyneth all males to appear Deuteronomy. 16. 16.
on the solemn feast days before the Lord, implies that servants also should
go. This duty must especially be performed on the Lords day: for the charge
given to masters in the fourth commandment for sanctifying that day, is
extended to servants in these words, Thou, nor thy man-seruant, nor thy
maid-seruant.

3. Masters, beside instructing servants at home, and causing them to go to
Church, must take an account of their profiting, both by the public, and also
by the private means of edification. Otherwise they shall not know how to
order their manner of instructing them: when to give them milk, and when
strong meat.

4. To make the means more effectual and profitable, they must to instruction
add prayer. Means, without Gods blessing upon the means, are nothing. As
they observe any grace wrought in their servants, they must be thankful unto
God for the same, and pray for the increase of it.

. 22. Of masters neglecting to edify their servants.
Contrary is the mind and practice of most masters: they think if they allow
their servants sufficient diet, lodging, and clothing, or wages according to
their covenant, they have done all that they need to do: and answerably they
do no more: wherein they show themselves no better then the heathen. For do
not the heathen so?

Object. At first taking of a servant no more was couenanted.
Answ. There are two covenants whereunto a master stands bound: one with God;
the other with his servant. Though his covenant with his servant requires no
more then some temporal commodities, yet Gods covenant requires spiritual
edification. Many masters are so greedy of their servants work, as they are
loath to afford any time, at morning or evening, for religious exercises: they
think by their servants labor to thrive, and think not of Gods blessing
which makes rich. Some go so far therein, as they keep their servants from
the public worship of God, even on the Lords day. Thus it comes to pass,
that servants, who came ignorant and profane to a master, after long abode with
him, so go away as they came. Many that themselves make some conscience of
fearing God, much fail herein: they regard not to teach their servants the
fear of God, whereby they deprive themselves of much blessing, and pull Gods
curse upon their persons and houses.

. 23. Of allowing servants sufficient food.
In regard that servants have not bodies of brass, or steel, II.
but of flesh and blood as all others, masters that have the benefit of their
strength and ability of their bodies, must be careful of nourishing, and
cherishing them: and that both in health, and sickness.

For preserving servants health, respect must be had to their Food, Clothing,
Labor, Rest.

A due provision of food for servants is commended in Solomon's Sufficient food
to be allowed to servants. Pro. 31. 15. and 27. 27.
good house-wife, who gives meat to her household. And in the direction which
he gives to householders, in these words, Let the milk of thy goats be
sufficient for thy food, and for the food of thy family.

The food which masters provide for their servants must be for quality, good
and wholesome; for quantity, sufficient to preserve health and increase
strength; for time, given in due season. It is noted that the hired servants of
the father of the Luke 15. 17.
prodigal child had bread (by bread according to the Scripture phrase is
meant all kind of needful wholesome food: in which sense it must needs be
there taken, because it is opposed to husks, which are not very wholesome,
fitter for swine then men) yea they had bread enough. It is further noted of
that good steward who was, as a master, ruler over the household, that Luke 12.
42.
he gave the household their portion of meat in due season.

Quest. May not servants be stinted of their food?
Answ. In regard of superfluity they may and ought to be stinted, but not in
regard of sufficiency. It is not meet that all servants should have as much as
they can devour: for then many of them would do but little work: but most
meet it is that every one should have as much as is needful for strength, that
so he may be the better able to do and endure his work: the Greek word
translated in the Luke 12. 42. (...).
place before quoted portion, implies as much.

There is a double bond to tie masters to perform this duty: one in regard of
themselves: the other in regard of their servants.

Masters themselves shall have the profit and benefit of the health and
strength of their servants: for their own sakes therefore it is requisite to
afford them sufficient food. Men that desire to have their work well done by
their beasts, or in their journey to be well carried to the end thereof, will
be careful that their beasts shall be well fed.

But beside this, considering the health and strength of servants is spent in
their masters business, justice requires that their health and strength
should be repaired and preserved by them.

. 24. Of defect and excess in allowing servants food.
There are two extremes contrary to this duty. One of those that are too
niggardly, and (as we speak) miserable in the allowance of food to their
servants: and that sometimes in the quantity, when servants bellies are too
much pinched: even so as their bodies are weakened for want of food. The
Prodigal child was thus served: these are both unjust and injurious Luke 15.
16.
masters: unjust to their servants: injurious to their servants, and themselves
too. Sometimes again such miserable masters offend in the quality of that
food which they give to their servants, as when it is kept too long, and grown
musty, moldy, or otherwise unsavory: or when the worst kind of food, for
cheapnesse sake, is bought, even such as is scarce fit for man's meat: the more
abundance that there is of such stuff, the more loathsome it is.

Lastly, though I think it not meet to bind masters unto set hours for their
servants meals (Christ affords a greater Luke 17. 7, etc.
liberty unto masters, in the parable of a masters usage of his servant after
he came from his work) yet there may be a fault, as there is, in many masters,
in keeping their servants too long from meat, not suffering them to interrupt
their work for meat sake, but to tarry for their supper till ten a clock at
night, when they give over work: surely this cannot be good for the bodies
health and strength.

Another extreme do such masters fall into, as bring up their Pro. 29. 21.
servants too delicatly. Solomon has expressly taxed such, and notes that this
mischief is like to follow thereupon, he shall have him become his son at
the length: such a servant will forget his place, scorn to be as a servant,
but aspire to be as his masters child, which is next to a masters mate.

. 25. Of masters care about their servants apparel.
A wise care for servants clothing is also commended in the example of
Solomon's good housewife, She is not afraid of the snow for her household, that
is, for the coldest season in winter, for all her household are clothed with
Pro. 31. 21. (...)
double garments: that is, with such clothing as is fit for cold weather.

Fit and decent apparel is both a means of preserving health, and also a
matter of good report, tending to the credit of a master. Yet contrary is the
humor of many: they care not how tagged and ragged their servants apparel is:
insomuch as many servants have neither comely nor warm apparel.

The Hebrew word is often used for scarlet. But according to the proper notation
of it, it signifies things doubled: which I take to be most pertinent to this
place, and therefore I have so translated it. The Kings translators have noted
as much in the margin.

This point concerns those masters especially that find their servants (as
we speak) and provide all things for them: as in old time masters did for most
servants, and as now they do for prentises whether male or female. If servants
by covenant be at their own finding for apparel, masters are not so strictly
bound therein: yet they must have a care that their servants fall neither into
the one extreme of too base, slouen-like, or sluttish apparel, nor into the
other of too garish, or too costly apparel. Masters having authority over
their servants, must keep them in order and good compass, and have respect to
decency in this as in other things. For apparel is one of those outward
signs whereby the wisdom of masters and mistresses in well governing their
servants is manifested to the world. If therefore servants be attired unseemly
for their place and ability, all that see them will think their masters and
mistresses are of such a mind as the servants are, or at least too remiss and
careless of their government.

. 26. Of moderating servants labor.
Though labor and pains be proper to a servants place, yet he may be so put
unto it, as the health and strength of his body may be impaired thereby. For
the well ordering of this therefore a duty lies upon masters: and that in two
things especially.

1. That they well moderate the labor whereunto they put their servants, so as
they may be able for the time to undergo it, and to endure so long as their
time of labor is appointed. It was a good reason which Saul rendered to keep
David from 1 Samuel 17. 33.
entering combat with Goliath, because (as he thought) David was not able to
fight against the Philistim, David being a youth, and Goliath a man of war.

And indeed if David's faith had not exceeded the strength of his body, it had
been unmeet to have put David to that task.

They which are put to things above their ability, are like to fail, and
sink under the burden of them.

It is contrary hereunto to put servants to such hard taskes as impair their
strength, endanger their lims, and venture their lives. Saul shall rise up in
judgment against such: for he supposing that it was too hard a task for David
to undertake combat with Goliath, was loath to put him to it. David exceedingly 1 Samuel 17. 33.
failed herein, when he gave direction that Vriah should be set in the
forefront of the hottest battle, and yet the General 2 Samuel 11. 15,
with his strength to retire from him. Many servants being put to services
above their strength, either lose their lives thereby, or (as we speak) are
never their own men again.

It is also a fault in this kind, to put servants to such toiling Memineris
seruos homines esse. Cato. Exo. 1. 13, 14.
works as are fitter for beasts then men: or to oppress them with too much
work, as the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites. Let Gods hearing the cry of
those servants so oppressed, and revenging their oppressors for it, make all
masters take heed and 3. 7.
of the like cruelty.

. 27. Of affording servants fit means for their work.
2. The other thing required of masters for well ordering their servants work
is, that they afford their servants things needful, and behouefull for that
work whereunto they are put: which mind was commendable in Saul, who assaied
if his 1 Samuel 17. 38.
armor might be fit for David when he was to go against Goliath. To reckon up
all the particulars were an infinite task: every several trade and work has
proper means of help appertaining to it: this general direction may be
sufficient to move masters to apply it to the particular works and services
whereunto they put their servants. Fit means are such an help, as that which
with them may easily be done, without them can hardly, if possibly at all be
done.

It is contrary hereunto to deal with servants as the Egyptians did with the
Israelites, exacting work at their hands, and Exo. 5. 7.
not affording them means to do it: whereby many times they exact
impossibilities. Some will have much work done in the night time, and not
afford candle light: so in other particulars.

. 28. Of affording seasonable rest to servants.
Intermission, ease, and rest from labor at seasonable times, is as needful
and requisite, as food and apparel. The reason which God renders of the
fourth commandment shows that masters ought to afford rest to their
servants: it is this, that Deuteronomy. 5. 14.
thy servant may rest.

Without intermission and rest the body cannot endure labor: it will wax
weak, faint, and utterly unable to continue: but, as labor decaieth strength,
so rest repaireth it.

There are two especial times of rest, which servants may not be denied. 1.
The rest of the night. 2. The rest of the Lords day.


The first is ordinary for all living creatures: for it was one Servants must
rest in the night time.
principall-reason why God caused the light of the Sun to be withdrawn from
the face of the earth, that the inhabitants thereof might rest from their
labor. Until the evening man Psalm. 104. 23.
goes forth unto his labor and work. Time of darkness is more fit for rest
then work. Let not this be so taken as if no work were to be done, after the
light of the day is taken away: (then would but little work be done in the
depth of winter, when the days are short: and then would not God have afforded
artificial lights) but to show that difference must be made betwixt the day
and night: and that the night is afforded for that time wherein men are most to
rest.

The other time of rest (being the Sabbath day) is by divine Servants must rest
on the Lords day. Genesis 2. 3.
institution. It was sanctified unto man in the time of Adams innocence, when
he stood as a public head and stock of all mankind. The very name Sabbath,
(which in Hebrew signifies rest) and the express prohibition of doing any
work on that day, do show that it is a day of rest: and that one end thereof
was for servants to rest therein, is evident by the reason thereof, that thy
servant may rest. So as there is a double bond to tie masters to afford rest to
their servants on the Lords day: 1. The bond of piety to God. 2. The bond of
charity to servants: for in that God did think it meet for servants to rest
one day in seven, we ought to Masters who afford not time enough of sleep to
servants offend.
think that it is needful and behouefull for them.


. 29. Of denying seasonable rest to servants.
Contrary to both the forenamed times of rest do many masters offend: as
first, they who make their servants watch too long at night, and again, rise
too soon in the morning, not affording so much time of rest and sleep as is
needful for refreshing their bodies, and repairing their strength: whereby it
comes to pass that (beside the wrong done to their poor servants) their
work cannot be done so well.

Object. It is said of the forenamed good houswife, that her Pro. 31. 18.
candle is not put out by night.
Answ. That is a tropicall speech: and somewhat hyperbolicall. The word night
is put for a part thereof. The phrase only implies vigilance, showing that she
is not, as many, in the evening betimes in bed, and in the morning late up; but
late down and early up. This phrase (she rises while it is yet night) Verse.
15.
used before, shows that that which I have noted, is the true sense. If not
putting out her candle by night, should imply a sitting up all night long, how
could it be said that she rises up?

Quest. What time may be thought sufficient to afford sleep How long time for
sleep to be allowed.
unto servants?
Answ. As the same quantity of food is not ouer-strictly to be proportioned to
all alike, so nor the same continuance of sleep. Yet by experience it has
been observed that for sound and healthy bodies, five hours is the least time
that may be allowed, and seven hours is time sufficient for any.

. 30. Of masters offense in keeping servants from the rest of the Lords day.
2. Against the rest of the Lords day, do too too many masters offend: as

1. By keeping servants at their ordinary work on that day.

2. By sending them up and down on that day on many errands, as to gather up
debts, or to do such other services as they are loath to afford time for on
other days.

3. By making that the greatest day of pains and labor, namely to such as are
in the kitchen, or have any other business about feasts: for the Lords day is
by many ordinarily made a day of feasting.

4 By keeping them up too late on Saturday nights: even till one of the clock.
Many that make some conscience of the Lords day use to offend herein: for that
their servants might not work on that day, they keep them up till the very
moment that they think the Sabbath begins: but herein they commit a double
fault: one in not allowing their servants sufficient time of rest: another in
making them unfit through want of sleep to do the holy services of the Lords
day.

. 31. Of allowing time of recreation to servants.
Concerning times of recreation, I may say as the Apostle does in another case,
I have no commandment of the Lord, 1 Cor. 7. 25.
namely express commandment to press upon the conscience of masters any set
time for recreation: yet questionless it is very meet that servants should
have some times to refresh themselves this way: for recreation rightly used is
a great means to put life, and add spirit, to youth especially. With work
and business not only men's bodies, but their minds also are occupied and
employed: herein the labor and travel of men differs from the labor of
beasts: for refreshing therefore both of body and mind is good and moderate
recreation needful. But I refer this point to the wise consideration of
masters themselves, who may better by their own observation discern what in
this kind is fittest, then we prescribe.

. 32. Of masters care over their servants in sickness, and after death.
Masters provident care for the good of their servants is not to be restrained
to the time of their health, but to the time of their sickness also, if it
please God to visit them while they are in service. Wherefore all things
needful are in this case to be provided for them by their master. First
spiritual comfort for their soul, that so they may the better bear their
infirmity: then such things as may for the present give them ease and
refreshing, and also, if it please God to add his blessing, work a recovery.
The care of the Centurion for his sick servant is Matt. 8. 6.
in Scripture commended: he did as much for his servant as he could have done
for his son: The King of Arams care also 2 King. 5. 6.
was in this kind commendable: he did not forbear to write to his enemy, and
to make himself beholding to him, in the behalf of his servant that was
leprous.

If the servant have been formerly a faithful, diligent, and Reasons. 1.
Recompense.
profitable servant, recompense requires as much. For it is a most unkind,
and inhumane part to deny that servant succor in sickness, who in health
has been profitable to his master.

But if a master be careful of his sick servant, affording unto 2. Future
benefit.
him the best means he can for his ease, and recovery, and that servant,
through Gods blessing upon the means, recover, he will, if he have any spark
of goodness in him, hold himself so obliged to his master, as he shall never
be able to make sufficient recompense: and thereupon be moved to use all the
diligence he can for his masters good: so that a master may reapebenefit to
himself by this kind of kindness.

But though the servant that is sick have in former time 3. Charity.
been unprofitable, and there be little hope of future benefit by him, yet for
charity sake, and in subjection to Gods disposing providence, whereby that
servant is fallen sick in his masters house, must he in that case be well
looked unto. If the Samaritan Luke 10. 33, 34.
did well in taking care of a mere stranger out of his house, because he saw
him succourlesse, surely that master which neglects his servant that is sick
in his house, does very ill.

1. Quest. What if he be not a couenanted servant for a set time, but a
Iourney-man at will, or one that works by the day or week?
Answ. Though a master be not so much bound to such an one, yet if he fall
sick in his house, he may not in that case thrust him out of doors, unless
he know where he may be well provided for.

2. Quest. What if a master be poor, and not able to provide that which is
requisite for a sick person?
Answ. If the sick person have friends and kindred that are better able, they
must provide for him: if not, the Church must help: but it is the masters
duty, to make the sick man's case known to his friends, or to the Church.

If, after all good means are used for recovery, the servant Servants that
die, to be decently buried.
die, his master must see the last duty in some seemly manner, performed for
him, which is Christian burial. Herein lies a maine difference betwixt the
usage of men's bodies which after death shall be raised again, and beasts that
utterly perish. Iaakobs care of burying his mothers nurse is expressly
mentioned, Genesis 35. 8.
in way of commendation.

. 33. Of neglect of servants in sickness: and when they are dead.
Many masters much offend in the contrary to the forenamed duties. For

1. Some, when they observe their servants begin to be sick, will put them out
of their houses, and leave them to shift for themselves, as that cruel
Amalekite who left his sick servant 1 Samuel 30. 13.
abroad in the fields. But note the vengeance of God which followed thereupon:
The leaving of that sick servant in that case was the occasion of the
destruction of that master and all his company. By that means they were
discovered to their enemies.

2. Others, when they cannot remove their sick servants out of their house,
will suffer them there to lie succourlesse, and to perish for want of things
needful. Many rich men that are able to provide well enough for them, will
send them to some out, back room, and take no more care for them. In this
kind many of them show more kindness to a dog, or other beast that is not
well, then to a servant. An inhumane part.

3. Others, that seem not so inhumane, deal too hardly with their servants in
such a case: they will afford them things needful, but all at the poor
servants cost: and if those servants have not present money, they will cut it
off their wages if they recover health to do them service. Is this to undo
the heavy burdens? Or is it not to lay burden upon Isa. 58. 6.
burden?

4. Others, that are at some charges for their servants sickness, do so
mutter at their servants, and fling out such discontented speeches (namely,
that they took them for their work, and not to keep them in their bed: to
get some thing by them, not to be at such cost with them: or that they make
themselves more sick then needs: they may rise, if they will, (with many other
like discontented speeches) that the poor sick servants are more grieved and
troubled with their masters discontent, then with their sickness: and often
moved to strive above their strength to rise, even when death is seasing upon
them, and so hasten the approach of death.

5. Many that may be careful enough of the bodily estate of their servants in
sickness, See.. 21, 22.
have no respect at all to the spiritual comfort of their souls, they neither
give them a word of comfort themselves, nor send for minister or any other to
do it: but let them in this respect lie, and die as beasts. Of all points of
unmercifulness this is the greatest: and most unbeseeming Christians.

6. Others, if their servants die, will scarce afford them a winding sheet, but
say, let any one that will, bury them for their clothes.

Notice is to be taken of these in humane cariages, that the detestation of
them may make other masters more tender hearted toward their servants.

. 34. Of masters providing for the future estate of servants.
Next to the Soul, and Body of servants, masters must have some care of their
estate: and that not only to keep them while they are in their service, but
also to endeavor and provide that they may live of themselves, and do good to
others. When shall I provide for mine own house? says Iaakob to his Genesis 30.
30.
master. Which expostulation shows that this is a masters duty.

Contrary is the mind of most masters: for in entertaining servants they think
of nothing but serving their own turn. Whence it comes to pass that when
masters die many servants are put to very hard shifts. Some forced to beg,
others moved to filch and steal. Thus caterpillars are nourished to annoy the
commonwealth.

That I may not be thought to lay the care of parents on masters, and to equal
servants with children, I will note out four particulars which will show what
manner of care and providence it is that is here required of masters in regard
of their servants estate.

One is, that masters accustom their servants to pains.

Another is, that they exercise them in some useful calling.

A third is, that they give them sufficient wages.

A fouth is, that after sufficient service they suffer them to provide for
themselves.

. 35. Of well employing servants.
That charge which the master gave to his servants when he was going abroad
(occupy till I come) shows that masters Luke 19. 13.
must keep their servants exercised and employed about some business or
other: which is also implied under this part of a good mistresses commendation,
she gives a portion to her maidens, Pro. 31. 15.
meaning a portion of work. As there is never an idle member in a natural
body, but every one is employed, so should it be in a family.

1. Thus servants being, while they are in subjection, inured to pains, they
will be more industrious when they are of themselves: yea they will both more
willingly undergo, and more easily go through matters which require pains and
diligence. Use makes perfect.

2. Thus will masters themselves, and others afterward receive the more profit,
and greater benefit by them.

3. Thus will many temptations be avoided, and evils prevented: continual
employment to the corrupt nature of man is as a running stream which carries
away all the mud and filth in a brook, so as none setleth there.

It is contrary hereunto to harbor idle-packes in a man's Contrary.
house: to give meat, and drink, and lodging to such as do no work at all.
The Apostle expressly commanded, That if 2 These. 3. 10.
any man would not work, neither should he eat.

These are not only a prey to the devil, but also instruments of the devil,
by which he works much mischief: for these are they that are most ready to
discover the secrets of an house, to be tatling of every thing that is done, to
sort themselves with all companies, and not content to do no good themselves,
disturb, interrupt, and draw away such as are busy at their work.

. 36. Of exercising servants to a calling.
Though it be a good thing to keep a servant always occupied and employed,
yet for the benefit of the servant it is further requisite, that his employment
be about some settled matter, whereabout he may also exercise himself when he
is out of service. This especially concerns such as have taken Masters must
teach their prentises their trade.
prentises. They must teach them their trade. 1. For that end are prentises
bound to masters. 2. The covenants on the masters part require as much. 3. The
good which thence is like to come to the master himself, his prentise, and
others, will recompense the pains.


Other servants also must be tied to a work which may be a means of
maintenance: as in a great house, to offices about that house: in the country,
to husbandry: in offices about the law, to some employment therein; and so in
other callings.

It is contrary hereunto for masters to envy their prentises the mystery of
their trade: to employ them from time to time about messages, and errands, and
such things as tend only to the masters present need, but cannot be profitable
for the servants in time to come. These are like old, grown, broad trees,
which keep all the sunshine from the shrubs that grow under them, and so keep
them down from growing.

Object. Prentises will be as iuy to the trees about which they cling, soon
ouer-topping them, and foking all the life out of them: they will hinder their
masters trading, and get away all his custom, if they be too expert in his
trade.

Answ. 1. This is but a mere surmise. It implies that such masters as fear
that which is pretended, deal not so currently, and faithfully with their
customers as they should; or else how could they surmise that wise chapmen
would leave one of whom they have had long and good experience, to go to a new
beginner?

2. Daily experience shows that God by his providence so orders men's
affairs, that masters who from time to time train up and send forth many
prentises well exercised and skillful in their trade, do hold on, yea and
increase in their own dealings and gain which they get thereby; and yet
withal their prentises also come well forward. Why should any masters so
distrust Gods providence, as to be afraid to make their prentises skillful in
their trade?

3. When masters by death or otherwise give over trading, how shall trades be
continued, if masters be so envious, and distrustful? What if their masters
had so dealt with them? And what if all masters should so deal? For what one
does in such a case, he must presuppose that all may do.

In this kind also do such mistresses offend as keep their maids many years
together to drudgery work, and never teach them, nor afford them means or
leisure to learn points of huswifery, things whereby they may get better
maintenance for themselves.

Such masters and mistresses use their servants as beasts, only for their own
turn, without any respect to the servants good: whereby they pervert the maine
end of that relation betwixt master and servant, which is a mutual and
reciprocal good to pass from the one to the other.

. 37. Of appointing to every servant his particular function.
For the better exercising of servants unto some calling, let these Directions
for fitting servants to some function.
directions be noted.

1. That masters appoint to their servants their proper and peculiar work,
that they may know what to do, and wherein to exercise themselves. And if
there be many servants in one house, to set unto every one their distinct
function. The phrase before noted of the good mistress (she gives a portion
to her maidens) Pro. 31. 15.
proves thus much. This was one thing which the Queen of Sheba observed and
admired in Solomon's house, the standing of 1 King. 10. 5.
his servants, namely, every one in his own place, at his own task. To this
purpose it is noted, that the great master gave to Matt. 25. 15.
each of his servants their distinct talents. It is thus in the body natural:
every member is not only employed, but also employed 1 Cor. 12. 8. etc. Quod
plurimorum commune est, in eo procurando minima diligentia adhibetur. Rerum
enim propriarum maximam curam habent, communium autem minorem. Arist. de Repub.
l. 2. c. 3.
in his own function: the eye in seeing, the ear in hearing, the foot in
standing or going, and so the rest. It is thus also in Christ's mystical body:
one has the spirit of wisdom, another of knowledge, another of faith, and so
in other gifts. Thus also ought it to be in a family where are many servants.

This is an especial means to make every one the more diligent and faithful.
For when every one has his particular work, they know, that they in
particular are to give an account thereof: so as if it be not done, or ill
done, they shall bear all the blame: if done, and well done, they shall have
all the praise.

2. Thus shall every one be made skillful and expert in some thing, by
continual attending upon it, and exercising themselves therein.

. 38. Of disorder in families through masters negligence.
The great disorder which is in many families is contrary hereunto: for there
are many masters that having sundry servants do look that all things should
be well done, and yet appoint no particular place or work to any one; but
think and say, that every one should be forward to do every thing; and when
they find Praeter alias causas eosunt in rebus communibus negligentiores, quod
eus alijs curae esse existiment: quemadmodum euenire solet in ministerijs
servilibus. Arist. loc. citat.
not things done to their mind, they fret and fume, and complain that they
keep so many servants, and yet nothing well done. Such servants are not free
from all blame: but surely the masters have greatest cause to complain of
themselves, and of their own disorder in governing. For their negligence in
appointing no set work to their servants, is the cause that all is neglected.
For where many things to be done are left to many servants, one will put off
this, and another that, and say it belongs not to them. Thus is it verified,
that what is spoken to all is spoken to none: and that general charges, are no
charges.

. 39. Of masters ouerseeing the ways of their servants.
The second direction is, that masters use inspection over their servants, and
have an eye upon their servants, to see how they spend their time, and dispatch
the business committed to them. The good mistress looks well to the ways
of her household. This Pro. 31. 27. Ruth 2. 4.
is noted of Booz, that he went to his field to see what his reapers did.

The eye of a master is a great motive to make a servant diligent and
faithful: for thus he knows that both his diligence, and also his negligence
shall be seen, and accordingly dealt withal. Hence arose that proverb, The
eye of the master makes the horse Oculus Domini pascit equum. Matt. 24. 48.
fat. The conceit which the evil servant had that his master delayed his
coming, and so could not see what he did, made him so unfaithful as he was.

If a masters place will bear it, it is behouefull that he be present with his
servants, and as a good president go before them. It is recorded of the good
mistress, that she rises and gives a Pro. 31. 13, 15.
portion to her maids: she is with them her self; she works willingly with
her hands. This note of difference is put betwixt a provident thriuing master,
and a dissolute careless master: This man says to his servants, go ye: but
that man says, go we; or thus, go sirs, and ga'w sirs.

It is contrary hereunto to let all go (as we speak) at six and Contrary,
carelessness.
seuens; and never to see what servants do. How can such expect that their
servants should be diligent in doing that which tends to their masters good,
when they themselves are negligent in ouerseeing that which tends to their
own good? Such masters as give themselves to gaming, and following their
pastimes all day long, do much offend herein. So also such mistresses as spend
all the morning in lying a bed and dressing themselves (a custom clean
contrary to that which is noted of the good mistress) Prou. 31. 15.
and at noone when they come out of their chamber, chide and brawle, because
things are not more forward.

. 40. Of provoking servants to their duty both by fair and foul means.
The third direction is, that masters use what means they can to provoke and
stir up their servants to be diligent and faithful: as in the first place,
exhortation, admonition, persuasion, promises of reward, with other like fair
means. Such were the means which Saul used to make his servants faithful
unto him, when he said, Will the son of Iesse give every one of you fields,
and vineyards, 1 Samuel 22. 7.
etc. had the thing which he expected from them been good, this manner of
dealing with them had been commendable. But if fair means prevail not, then
they may and ought to See. 13.
rebuke, threaten, and correct their servants.

And if servants be impudent in sinning, and neither fair nor foul means
will reclaim them, they must then be thrust out of doors. Note what the
master in the parable said to his servant, Thou may be no longer steward: to
which purpose David also Luke 16. 2. Psalm. 101. 7.
said, He that works deceit shall not dwell within mine house: he that
tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.

When Ismael grew a scoffer at Gods word, Abraham thrust Genesis 21. 9. etc.
him and his mother out of doors, and that by Gods appointment. The parable of
cutting down the fruitless figtree may fitly be applied to this point: and
the reason also there rendered (why combereth it the ground?) Why should
incorrigible servants Luke 13. 7. etc.
take up the room of good servants? yea why should they remain to insect and
pervert other servants?

Object.
This is so far from helping servants in their estate, as it may prove their
utter undoing.

Answ. 1. They have then none justly to blame but themselves, Justice (in case
of necessity) must have her course, though through the iniquity of man some
mischief follow thereupon.

2. The execution of this on some, may make others better look to themselves.

3. It may make them that are thrust out to be the more dutiful under another
master, or more diligent in another course of life.

Contrary is their course who observe no course, or order A servant is not for
every offense to be thrust out of doors.
in drawing on their servants to do their duty, but begin with that which
should be last: nay only use that remedy which should not be used, unless no
remedy will serve the turn, which is to turn their servants out of doors for
every small occasion. No instruction, persuasion, admonition, rebuke,
threatening is used by many when their servants have offended, but this
thunderbolt cast at them, be gone, get you out of doors. If this were taken
notice of as a fault, longer might servants tarry in an house then ordinarily
they do: and more good might master and servant reap one from another: yea
and the secrets of an house be better kept; for the often chopping and changing
of servants is it that makes all things done privately in houses to be blazed
up and down.

. 41. Of paying servants their wages.
A third thing required of masters in respect of the estate of their servants,
is to give them their just wages: even this is included under that general
precept, Romans 13. 7.
render to all their dues: and more particularly expressed in the example of
Matt. 20. 8.
that master who hired laborers into his vineyard and at the end of their
work gave them every one their wages: yea there is an express Deuteronomy. 24. 15.
law to this purpose.

Object.
These places concern laborers hired by the day.

Answ. Servants are in the same rank: and the ground for both is the same: for
both work for wages. Yea the argument will more strongly follow from the less
to the greater thus, If a labourer and servant for a day must have his wages
justly paid, much rather a servant, and labourer for a year and years.

1. A masters covenant requires as much: if there were no other bond, yet that
bond whereby he voluntarily binds himself, tyeth him in conscienc thereto.
Among the fruits of the Spirit Gal. 5. 22.
S. Paul reckons Faith, meaning thereby fidelity in keeping promise and
covenant.

2. Common equity and justice requires as much: for wages is as due for
labor, as money for wares. Christ takes it for an undeniable principle, that
Luke 10. 7.
the labourer is worthy of his hire: so also does 1 Timothy 5. 18.
the Apostle.

This duty is to be performed to such as are hired for wages: of them that are
found all things by their master, I spoke. 23, 25.
before.

In giving servants their wages these three things are to be Direction for
giving wages.
observed.

1. That there be a sufficient competency of wages allowed: even so much at
least as may serve to provide such necessaries as are fit for a servant: for
there is great reason, that he that works should live of his work.

2. That it be given in due season. Leu. 19. 13. Deuteronomy. 24. 15.
God would not have the laborers hire be unpaid one night after it was due.
The time couenanted by a servant for his wages, is the seasonable time: then he
expects it: to that time he puts his occasions of using it: at that time
therefore it ought to be given him.

3. That it be paid to the full, according to the covenant: the masters
promise, and the servants need require as much.

. 42. Of masters injustice about their servants wages.
Injustice contrary to the forenamed duty of due paying their servants wages
is many ways committed.

1. When masters do altogether detain their servants wages: Deuteronomy. 24. 15.
Jam. 5. 4.
this is a crying sin, which enters into the ears of God.

2. When they make their servants ask for their wages again and again, even
till they be ashamed: yea to stay and wait for it till they be forced to sigh
unto God: or else to filch and steal to supply their necessities: though these
masters have not a purpose utterly to defraud their servants of their due, yet
the putting them off, and delaying to pay it, puts servants, that for the
most part have but from hand to mouth, unto great straits: which the Lord well
knew: and therefore Leu. 19. 13. Deuteronomy. 24. 15.
expressly forbad the detaining of a servants hire one night. This therefore is
a point not only of unkindness, but also of injustice.

3. When masters alter and change the couenanted wages, and seek to diminish
it, as Genesis 31. 41.
hard-hearted Laban did: they show thereby that they repine at their servants
welfare, and seek only themselves.

. 43. Of suffering servants to provide for themselves.
A fourth thing required of masters in regard of their servants estate is, that
after sufficient service done they suffer their servants to provide for
themselves. This Iaakob required of Laban as a most equal and reasonable
matter, saying, Genesis 30. 30.
when shall I provide for mine own house also? (as was. 34.
before noted in the general.) This has respect especially unto such servants
as have been a long time with masters as apprentises, and spent their time,
labor, and pains only and wholly for their masters good. Exodus 21. 2. Deuteronomy.
15. 12.
Gods law took express order for such, that after certain years service
they should go free. So do also the laws of our land, especially the orders
of London.

Herein lies a maine difference betwixt servants (who are under subjection,
and held to work for their own good) and beasts (which are only for man's
service, and good.)

They therefore who are of a contrary mind, keeping servants Contrary.
as long as possibly they can, even all their life long unto hard labor, and
under servitude, deserve to be served with beasts rather then men and women.
This kind of masters rigor to their servants is in particular noted to be
Ier. 34. 16, 17.
one of the causes of that great indignation of God against the Jews, whereby
he was provoked to give them over, as captives to their enemies.

. 44. Of kindness to be showed to good servants.
As masters must give that which is just to all servants, so that which is. 20.
equal to them that deserve it: that is, they must be of an answerable mind
and disposition to good, honest, loving, kind, faithful servants, who stand
not so much upon that which is exacted, as upon that which they are able to do
for their masters, and in that respect, as they see occasion do often times much
more then is exacted, or expected. Goodness requires goodness; good will,
good will; and this is to do the same things. This kind of Equity consists
in these and such like particulars.

1. Masters must well esteem of such good servants: and have them in high
account. Genesis 15. 2, 3.
Abram accounted his old good faithful servant as his child, and till he had
a child thought of making him his heir. Great was that esteem which Potiphar
Qui vere patresfamilias sunt, seruis in familia sua tanquam filijs consulunt.
Aug. de Ciu. Dei, l. 19. c. 16.
had of Joseph, when of a bondslaue he made him ouerseer over his house, Genesis
39. 4. Why is the title Father given to masters, (2. King. 5. 13.) and the
title Sons to servants, (Ios. 7. 19. and 1 Samuel 24. 16.) but to show that
servants should bear a child-like affection to their masters, and that masters
should bear a fatherlike affection to such servants?

2. Masters must take notice of the goodness, and kindness of such servants:
and manifest as much, both by giving them due praise, and a good reward: both
which are noted in the pattern of that great master who said, well done thou
good Matthew. 25. 21.
and faithful servant, thou have been faithful over a few things, I will
make thee ruler over many things. Thus will those good servants be the more
encouraged to hold on, and others will be moved to imitate them. This
encouragement does the Apostle give to all under authority, do that which is
good, and Romans 13. 3.
thou shall have praise of the same. Which phrase implies that governors
ought to praise those that do well.

3. If such servants be accused of any heinous crime, masters must not rashly
give credit thereto, but rather thoroughly sift, and examine the matter. Herein
Potiphar exceedingly Genesis 39. 19.
failed, and by that means lost such a servant as he could never get again.
If a good servant do by occasion slip, and commit a fault, his master ought in
wisdom either to take no notice of it: or with some mild admonition pass it
over: and not deal with him as with a lewd, graceless servant.

4. When such servants (their couenanted time being expired) depart, their
masters must not let them go away empty: Deuteronomy. 15. 13.
but help them in their marriage (as Moses his master did) or Exodus 2. 21.
in their setting up, as the great master, who made his wise and faithful
servant ruler over all his goods. Matthew. 24. 47.


. 45. Of unkind dealing with good servants.
Unworthy they are of good and kind servants who are of a contrary mind: as
many masters are For

1. Some make no difference betwixt servants: but esteem of bad and good all
alike: they think that the best servants do but their duty, therefore no
extraordinary respect is to be borne toward them. But it is a point of wisdom
sometimes to account a duty as a kindness: especially when good will of heart
is joined with outward performance of duty.

2. Others think it policy to take no notice of any servants extraordinary
faithfulness and diligence to praise and reward the same, lest it puff them
up too much. But there is much more fear of servants fainting, and waxing
weary of doing good if they have no encouragement, then of growing insolent by
encouragement.

3. Others will be more ready to check and rebuke such for every slip, and for
failing in any thing, then others: because others less regard their rebuke:
whereby they show want of wisdom in well managing their authority.

4. Others when their servants are about to go away, or to marry, or to set
up, will seek some occasion or other to fall out with them, of purpose to send
them away empty. Many will carry a fair face toward profitable servants till
the time of recompense comes, and then begin to frown, as Laban Genesis 31. 2.
did. Yea so far are some masters from seeking the prosperity of faithful,
wise, diligent, skillful servants, as they will hinder Sic cum inferiore viuas,
quemadmodum tecum superiorem velles viuere. Senec. epist. 47.
them in what they can, and keep them down: fearing lest as their servants
rise, they themselves should decay and fall. These are both unkind, and
ungrateful masters. Would masters be so dealt with by their superiors? Thou
ought so to live with thy inferior, as thou would have thy superior
live with thee.

Hitherto of masters duties. The reasons to move them to perform their duties
follow.

. 46. Of the subjection under which masters are.
Ephesians. 6. 9. Knowing that your master also is in heaven: neither is there
respect of persons with him.


There is in general but one reason alleged by the Apostle, to provoke
masters to do their duties, but it is so laid down as it compriseth other
forcible reasons under it.

The principal reason is taken from the subjection wherein masters are.

The other reasons are taken from the description of that authority under which
masters are: for it is such an authority, as,

1. In relation to it there is no difference betwixt master and servant.

2. It is far surpassing all dignities on earth.

3. It is moved with no outward respect of any thing.

The first reason which declares the subjection of masters, in that they have
a master over them, puts them in mind of that account which they are to
make, and reckoning which they are to give of the well using of their
authority, and of their carriage toward such as are under them. For they are
but as stewards over fellow servants: every one of them therefore shall hear
this charge, give an account of thy stewardship. Luke 16. 2.


In this respect this reason is both as a spur, and as a curb unto masters.

As a spur, to prick them on forward conscionably to perform all those duties
which are required of them: for they have a master that will take notice
thereof, and reward them for it. As they approve, and recompense the good
service which their servants do: so much more will their master approve and
recompense them if they do well. Do masters therefore look that their
servants should perform their duty? let them then perform theirs: for there
is the same reason of both. Let this be applied to all the particular duties
before mentioned.

It is also as a curb, to restrain masters from doing any thing to their
servants but what they can be able to justify unto their own master. With
this curb did God hold in the Israelites, saying, Leu. 25. 43.
Thou shall not rule over thy servant with rigor, but shall fear thy God.
Joseph was held in with it, when he said, Genesis 42. 18.
This do and live, for I fear God. And Nehemiah, when he said, Neh. 5. 15.
The former Governors were chargeable to the people, but so did not I because
of the fear of God. And Job, when he said, Job 31. 13, 14.
If I did despise the cause of my servant, when God visits, what shall I
answer him? Think of this o masters, when you are about to exact any thing of
your servants that is not lawful or meet, when you are incensed and in passion
stirred up to strike your servants unjustly or cruelly, when you detain from
them any thing that is their due, when you lay more on them then they are able
to bear, when any way you wrong or oppress them: think and say with your
selves, can this be justified? how shall we be able to hold up our head to our
master when he calls us to account? What stronger motive to do all duty?
what stronger restraint from all injustice and rigor? The conceit which many
have that they are free, under none, to give no account, makes them both
negligent of their own duty, and insolent over others; as Pharaoh, who said,
Exodus 5. 2.
Who is the Lord that I should obey him? and Sennacherib, who said, 2 Chr. 32.
15.
Shall your God deliver you out of mine hands? and Nebuchadnezzar, who said,
Dan. 3. 15.
Who is that God that shall deliver you out of mine hands? Note the issue of
this insolency. Pharaoh after many extraordinary plagues laid on him and his
people, Exodus 14. 28.
was drowned in the red sea with all his host. Isa. 37. 36, 38.
Sennacherib after his host was destroyed, was slain by his own sons. Dan.
4. 30.
Nebuchadnezzar became a very bruit. But to let these abominable blasphemers
pass, there be many masters who, though they utter not with their mouths such
execrable blasphemies, yet by their carriage toward their servants show
themselves to be little better minded, in that they make their own will a rule
to their servants, and will have them do such things as are unmeet and
unlawful, using their servants as slaves, or rather as beasts. Let all such
masters know that they have a master.

. 47. Of the equality betwixt masters and servants in relation to God.
The second reason in this particle also (your master also) declares an
equality betwixt masters and servants in relation to God. As God is the masters
of servants, so he is the master of masters also. As servants are the Lords 1
Cor. 7. 22.
freemen, so masters are the Lords servants. In this respect they who are made
rulers, and they who are under them, are called Matt. 24. 49. ^ominus fidelem
habens seruum di'igat vt fra^rem propter fidei societatem salua sibi seruitute.
Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12. Dominum patrem familiae appellauerunt, seruos
familiares. Se^ec. Epist. 47.
fellow servants. For howsoever in outward dignity there is great difference
betwixt master and servant, yet as the servants of God they are of a like
condition, and in many things may be accounted equal: especially if both be of
the same faith, and so brethren in Christ. This is another spur and curb too.

A spur in that God will the more kindly accept that goodness which masters
do to their servants, because it is done to Gods servants.

A curb, in that servants shall be heard before God as well as masters, for he
is the master of both.

Many think that all the kindness which is showed to servants is lost,
because they are so mean as they are able to make no recompense. But their
master is able.

Others think, their servants can never take any revenge of them, and
thereupon use them as they list. But the master of servants, who is also the
master of masters, can take vengeance, even such as shall make masters sorely
repent all the wrong they have done.

If masters did duly weigh this point, that, howsoever in regard of outward
government there be some difference betwixt them and their servants, yet before
God they are as fellow servants, would they be ouer-rigorous and cruel? would
they not be kind and gentle?

. 48. Of Gods being in heaven, how it is a motive to provoke masters well to
respect their servants.
The third reason (taken from the place of God, in heaven) declares the
surpassing excellency of that great master, who is the common master of
masters and of servants: and it adds an edge to the former motives.

1. It shows that though the wrong which masters do to their servants be
within the walls of their house, so as no mortal eye can see it, yet God who
is in heaven sees it: and though servants cannot be admitted into the courts
of men to make their complaint, yet heaven is open to them; to that great
master that is in heaven they may have access when they will. That which made
the evil steward deal hardly with his fellows, was the conceit Mat. 24. 48.
which he had of his masters absence. But no such conceit can they have of this
great master, who know that he is in heaven, and Pro. 15. 3.
that as heaven is over every place, so the eyes of the Lord are in every
place, and behold the evil and good: he sees all the good, and all the evil
that masters do to their servants.

2. It shows that the kindness which the Lord will repay, and the vengeance
which he will inflict, is infinitely greater then the good or evil that
masters can do to their servants, even as heaven i, higher then earth, and as
he that is in heaven is greater then they that are on earth. Do thou
therefore, who art a master on earth, rejoice, or grieve the soul of thy
servant? God in heaven can much more make glad or sad thy soul. Do thou
therefore desire the favor, or fear the frowns of thy master in heaven? show
favor to thy servant on earth, and forbear threatening. Remember the infinite
disparitie betwixt thy mastership and Gods, and this will the more move thee to
deal with thy servant, as thou would have God deal with thee.

3. It shows that there is much more reason we should take notice of our
servants, of their pains, of their diligence, and of their faithfulness, then
that God should take notice of ours: and less reason that we should scorn, or
neglect our servants, then God scorn or neglect us. For there is far greater
difference betwixt God and us, then betwixt us and our servants. We and our Vis
tu cogitare istum quem seruum (...) vocas, exijsdem seminibus ortum, eodem
fruicoelo, aeque spirare, aeque viuere, aeque mori. Senec. Epist. 47.
servants are all of the earth, of the same mould, nature, and disposition,
subject to the same passion, and to the same dissolution. (The heathen observed
as much.) But God is in heaven, eternal, unchangeable, every way surpassing
glorious. How can we then look to be respected of this master, if we respect
not our servants? O masters, in all your dealings with your servants, remember
your master is in heaven.

. 49. Of Gods impartial respect of all.
The fourth reason (in these words, neither is there respect of persons with
him) declares Gods just and equal manner of proceeding with all men, of what
rank and degree soever. God will do the same things to all sorts of masters
that they do to their servants. To the consideration of this impartial
justice of God does the Apostle call masters, both because of that outward
power which they have over their servants, and also because for the most part
masters are backed with the power and authority of magistrates on earth, who in
matters of difference betwixt master and servant are ordinarily partial,
respecting masters more then servants.

But let masters here learn to cast off all such fond conceits, and foolish
hopes. Though they be higher in place, have more wealth, and better friends
then their servants, and though men who have carnal eyes may thereby be much
moved to respect them, yet will not God go an hairs breadth from justice for
the whole world. If the greatest man that ever was in the world should have a
servant that were the meanest that ever was, and a case betwixt that master and
that servant should come before God, God would not any whit at all lean to
that master more then to the servant. If the greatest that be abuse the
meanest, they shall not escape. Wherefore, O masters, give no just cause of
complaint to any servant.

The Apostles manner of setting down these points, noted in this word
(knowing) implies that ignorance of God, of that authority which he has over
masters, of that equality which in relation to God is betwixt masters and
servants, and of Gods heavenly excellency, and impartial respect toward all,
makes masters to abuse their power, by neglecting all duty, and insulting and
tyrannizing over their servants: wherefore you that have heretofore been
ignorant of these points, now take knowledge of them; and you that know them,
often call them to mind: and do that which becomes good masters, Knowing that
your master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him.
