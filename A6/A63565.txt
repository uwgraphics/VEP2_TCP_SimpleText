SO powerful a Temptation is pernicious Wealth unto the Covetous mind, and
thirst of Gain so Charms their Senses that as a Lethargy it quite overspreads
their Reason till stupefied at such a Rate, as Men not well knowing what they
do for if they did, it is sure they would be more cautious of their safety, than
to run headlong upon the fatal Piles of Ruin and destruction not minding the
close snares of Death laid to entrap their hasty Feet stop them in their full
Career, nor those prying Anticks Fate has set in the broad way that leads to
desolation, and the Ghastly Courts where horror dwells, but blinded with the
vain hopes of safety and escape; they boast of their adventurous Rashness or
pernicious Fully even on the brink of vast Eternity and Gap of separation from
this mortal Life, and smile disdainfully upon the upon the Glittering Sword
that angry Justice draws to cut them off and make them cease to be on Earth, as
almost Monthly examples though various in effects can witness to the World, of
which number this we now shall treat of is not the least for all desperate
minded wretches to have rega^d unto and be forewarned by timely preventing the
selfsame fate.

Thomas Pardue a notorious Offender, whose many Crimes and Villainous exploits
would be too many to repeat in this small. Tract, therefore we only shall make
mention of those particular or which he was Arraigned Condemned, and now
Executed at Followeths. First, for that he in the Company of John Bigs, J^hn
E^ias, J^hn Ralphs, Clement Snell, already Executed, committed a Robbery upon
the house of Mr. Benning of Wilsdom in the County of Middlesex, who living in a
house some distance from Neighbors, this Gang h^d intelligence by their
Emisar^e^ or Scouts that he was a rich Man, and always kept good store of Plate
and Moneys in his house, and farther, that at such a tune he was to be at
London, and that he would continue there all night, with a relation of all the
Room and convenient places for hiding and concealing money, plate, or such like,
which they at that time pretended much to want, by reason they had a Customer,
for such commodities, who had been lately with them, and were very importunate
for them to proceed upon some enterprise of great worth, so that according to
their intelligence they went, and by lying in a Wood which was in sight of the
house, conducted thither by one Evans yet in Newgate, they could plainly
discern who passed in or out of the house so that long they had not lain in
Ambush before they saw Mr. Benning take ^orse for London, upon which they
concluded, all the rest that they had been informed was true; whereupon, as
soon as it was dark, three of them went and knocked at the Door, whereupon the
Maid of the House asked who was there, they replied Friends so that the Maid
thinking they had been Neighbors, opened the Door, which being no sooner done,
but they rushed in violently, and held open the Door till the rest of their
Gang came in, so that all being enterred, they bound the Family consisting of
four persons, the Mistress of the house two men and the Maid, but upon second
thoughts they loosed the Maid, to show them the Rooms, and light them the
Candle, whilst they plundered, so that having searched what places they
pleased, they did not much fail in their expectations, for in moneys and Plate,
they got to the vallue of 250 pound, after that they compelled the Maid to
fetch them what Victuals there was in the house, and sat down at the Table, and
there drinking several healths, they took their fatal repast for the space of
four hours or thereabouts and then departed, with their Booty, and glad of so
rich a prize, which exceeded their expectations, but as this Prisoner reported
Evan: who impeached them, was not actually in the Robery, but upon some
distaste, or through fear left them in the Wood, thus was the first exploit,
the next was upon the house of one William Charles of Tatnam-Court, in the
Parish of Pancridg, where entering his House, and calling for Drink they desired
the Master of the house's Company, who refused to come, whereupon they
concluded to call for Wine, saying, that no doubt would bring him; the which
accordingly succeeded; but he no sooner came, but one of the Company starting
up, asked him if he knew not Hind, to which he answering no, one of them with
an Oath, replied that they were of his Profession and wanted moneys, thereupon
some of them bound him, and the rest went and seized upon his Wife, his
Daughter, and an old woman that lodged there, and after they had secured them
began to plunder, but failed in their expectation for they could not meet with
any thing of considerable vallue, yet seized several parcels of Goods to the
vallue of five or six pounds; several of the Gang being taken and executed, the
Party now the subject of our discourse fled, but Bigs beforementioned and one
Newel having broke the Goal of Newgate, meeting him upon their Ramble, they
could not forget their old employ, but fell to it afresh, (so infatigate are
those sort of people, that they can as soon put off themselves as leave their
Villainies; and after having committed many Robberies in the North of England,
were returning again for London, but at St. Albans being suspected for loose
persons were apprehended and the last Sessions upon their. Trials found Guilty,
according to Law received the dreadful Sentance of death Bigs and Newel were
executed with the other Prisoners and Pardue for some Reasons reprieved till
this day.

During the respited time most graciously allowed for his Repentance, and
making his peace with his Creator, he behaved himself very resolutely, not as a
Man droping into Eternity ought, but as if grown desperate with the sense of
Death he knew not what he did, yet often musing on his present-State, he would
seem somewhat to relent bu presently again fall into Contempt of Life and storm
at those that came to see him, saying that though his accusers had taken his
Life, they should not have his Soul, or words to that effect. Being asked where
they had disposed of the Goods they took from Mr. Benning, his answer was, that
they were sold by one of the Company already executed, to a party living in or
near Charterhouse-Lane but he was not at the delivery of them, and so could not
glue any particular account, but said that there was blood enough already paid
for them, or to that effect, in the Morning when he was helped into the Cart he
looked very cheerful, but at the place of Execution when Death looked Ghastly on
him he began to change, looked pale, and desired all present to take warning by
his sad end, and not be deluded or persuaded as he had been, to close with the
like unlawful practices.

Robert Gale the Broaker who received Sentence of Death with the test, for
receiving a Stone horse and a Mare of John Bigs, and Thomas Newel before
mentioned, which they stole in Buckingham-shire, and giving them forty
shil1lings for them, after his long Respit, and his great Repentance, Received
his Majesty's most Gracious Reprieve. And we hope this will be a warning not
only to him, but to all that deal in that unlawful way that for the future they
will beware how they encourage Thieves and Villains by receiving or purchasing
those Goods which they by violence or fraud do take from honest and industrious
men.

FINIS.
